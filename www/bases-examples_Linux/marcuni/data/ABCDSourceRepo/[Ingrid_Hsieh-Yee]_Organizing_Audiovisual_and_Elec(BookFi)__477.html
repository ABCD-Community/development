<p>Preface Preface
</p>
<p>Sound recordings and videorecordings have become important components
of many library collections. Increasingly, libraries have collected computer files
and multimedia. Many libraries have also started collecting Internet resources.
The cataloging of these materials, however, is not covered in depth by all library
and information science programs. Those interested in this subject rely on special
workshops to gain some knowledge in this area. This book was developed to
meet the increasing need for assistance in cataloging these materials.
</p>
<p>Cataloging rules for sound recordings and videorecordings remain
stable, and new guidelines have been published to supplement Chapter 9 (Com-
puter files) of Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition (AACR2R) for the
description of interactive multimedia and Internet resources. This book illustrates
these standards with examples and uses fully cataloged records to explain cata-
loging issues specific to each type of material. The objective is to help students,
librarians, educators, and anyone new to these media to gain competency in cata-
loging them. The book is designed either for self-study or for classroom use.
Readers can study the subjects at their own pace, and educators may find the text
useful for courses on media cataloging, advanced cataloging, and the cataloging
of Internet resources.
</p>
<p>Chapter One explains the relationship between information organi-
zation and cataloging and discusses how librarians have been organizing the
types of material covered in this book. Chapter Two provides an overview of the
cataloging process to prepare readers for the other chapters. Chapters Three
through Seven cover the cataloging of sound recordings, videorecordings, com-
puter files, interactive multimedia, and Internet resources. Each of these chapters
begins with an introduction&mdash;followed by a discussion, with examples, of cur-
rent standards for descriptive cataloging, choice of access points, and subject
analysis&mdash;and concludes with analyses of 10 bibliographic records. Options for
arranging audiovisual and electronic resources are included in the appropriate
chapters. Chapter Eight discusses the changing information environment and
places cataloging in this context. The book contains a list of cataloging resources
on the Web. A supplementary Web site to facilitate access to important cataloging
tools and recent updates on the treatment of audiovisual and electronic resources
is available on the &ldquo;Textbook Supplements&rdquo; page of the Libraries Unlimited
Web site (http://www.lu.com.textsupp.html).

<p>PREFACE</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Items cataloged for this book came from public, academic, and special
libraries. The author created records according to the current standards and pre-
sented the records in the MARC format. All access points were checked against
the name and subject authority files on OCLC PRISM. New names were estab-
lished according to AACR2R. Some records were found in PRISM and revised to
meet the current standards.
</p>
<p>The author and her colleagues reviewed literature of cataloging to
gain an understanding of how rules have evolved for the selected audiovisual
and electronic resources. To keep current with issues related to electronic resources,
the author monitored several listservs, including Autocat, Diglib, InterCat,
Lita-L, Metamarda-l, USMARC, and Web4Lib. In addition, the author monitored
electronic journals such as D-Lib Magazine and Current Cites and electronic
newsletters such as LC Cataloging Newsline and ALCTS Network News. The
archives of Autocat were reviewed for discussion on relevant issues. To under-
stand how libraries arrange the selected media for access, the author visited libraries
in the Washington Metropolitan areas. To gain a broader perspective, the author
conducted a survey of the 100 largest public and academic libraries.
</p>
<p>As a teacher of cataloging for nearly a decade, my goal is and has always
been to give students enough practical details to perform original cataloging and
to provide them with the principles of cataloging to adapt to a changing informa-
tion environment. In addition to the immediate goal of helping readers gain some
competency in cataloging selected types of material, I hope that readers will also
recognize that the future of cataloging lies in the application of cataloging principles.
The future of our profession depends on lifelong learning and collaboration with
other information professionals. Librarians have successfully integrated sound
recordings and videorecordings into their services. If history is our guide, catalogers
will turn the challenges posed by electronic resources into opportunities and help
make libraries an essential player in the future information environment.

<p>Acknowledgments
</p>
<p>The preparation of this book involved many people. I would like to thank the
librarians who allowed me to use their collections and helped me understand
how audiovisual and electronic resources are organized for library services. Their
dedication and expertise are impressive. They include Beth Picknally Camden,
Adele R. Chwalek, Genevieve Clemens, Lawrence E. Clemens, Brooke W. Harding,
Ruth Hennessy, Patricia J. Herron, Meredith Horan, Carleton L. Jackson, Patti
Patterson, Rick Provine, Chiyono Sata, Jackie Shieh, Allison Mook Sleeman,
Judith Thomas, Patricia E. Wallace, and Lauren S. Windisch. My gratitude also
goes to Edward Gaynor, Rebecca Guenther, Sherry Kelley, Daniel Pitti, and
David Seaman who shared their knowledge of metadata development and appli-
cations with me.
</p>
<p>A research grant from The Catholic University of America supported
this research. Dr. Elizabeth Aversa, then dean of the School of Library and Infor-
mation Science, was very encouraging and helpful. My colleagues at the School
provided much-needed moral support&mdash;their friendship and encouragement are
greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p>Many students were generous with their help and time. Scott Davidson,
Honora Nerz, and Craig McGrath helped me gather data, monitor listservs, and
prepare bibliographies. Michael Smith and Connie Lee helped me to update the
URLs. Liselle Drake and Connie Lee provided much help in proofreading the
text and correcting the indexes. Michael Smith helped me to create the Web site
for this book.
</p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge the staff at Libraries Unlimited for their
work in producing this book. Edward Kurdyla, managing editor; Mary Cullen,
project editor; and Pamela J. Getchell, typesetter; were flexible and very helpful.
I also wish to thank Ron Maas, who was instrumental in the development of this
project.
</p>
<p>Last but not least, my appreciation goes to my husband, who has pro-
vided tremendous support for me. His love and encouragement have given me
the determination to press on. I could not have completed this project without him.

<p>Organization of Information and Cataloging
</p>
<p>Cataloging is the cornerstone of librarianship. Some people perceive it nar-
rowly as a subject that involves rigid rules and forced logic. But it is cataloging
that enables patrons to search, browse, and access information. Cataloging provides
the bibliographic structures that support reference services and ensure effective
and efficient collection management. An understanding of how cataloging relates
to information organization will prove helpful as librarians integrate information
of all formats into collections.
</p>
<p>■THE INFORMATION TRANSFER CYCLE
The Information Transfer Cycle
</p>
<p>Cataloging is a form of information organization, as well as a critical
part of the information transfer cycle. As Figure 1.1 shows, information transfer
is cyclical. A potential author can begin at the Access stage by researching for
materials for a project. The author will consult information tools, computerized
and human, to locate known items, to search for works on selected subjects, to
find out what experts have said about the topics, to determine the relevancy of re-
trieved items, and to request access to relevant items. At the Synthesis stage, the
author takes time to review those items, discards irrelevant ones, synthesizes
relevant literature, develops theses and antitheses, adds personal insight, and
moves on to the Creation stage. When a work is complete, it is sent forward to
peer reviewers or editors. When the work passes review, it becomes available to
the public. The Information Organization stage begins next. The work could be
included in a directory such as Books in Print. It could be indexed by an abstract-
ing and indexing service or listed in a bibliography. In a library, the work is most
likely to be cataloged. Descriptive information, access points, subject indicators
(descriptors, subject headings, classification or similar devices) would be pro-
vided, and the item would be placed on the shelf for access. After such treatment
the item is ready for the Access stage, and the cycle continues.
</p>

<p>Different methods of information organization result in different
outputs&mdash;a directory, an index, a bibliography, or a catalog. But the objectives are

<p>similar&mdash;to identify, to discover, to select, and to obtain a work. If Information
Organization is removed from this cycle, the gap between creators and users of
information becomes very costly to bridge. Patrons will have to spend much time
and energy determining what is available, searching for the desired items, and
evaluating the relevancy of everything they happen to find. This is, in fact, the
current predicament of Internet users. In spite of the large number of search engines
and directories, users still have to sift through a lot of materials to find something
satisfactory&mdash;many have found nothing useful after extended exploration.
</p>
<p>■THE PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION
ORGANIZATION
</p>
<p>The Principles of Information Organization
</p>
<p>Organizing information for access is a major concern of library and
information science professionals. Various methods have been developed to
organize different types of information for access, resulting in tools such as cata-
logs, indexes (print and online), abstracts, finding aids, bibliographies, and path-
finders. The large number of such tools gives the impression that these methods
are very different and cover separate parts of the information universe. But these
tools all serve the important functions advocated by Charles A. Cutter in his
Rules for a Dictionary Catalog in 1904: identifying, collocating, evaluating, and
locating functions.1 The importance of such functions were underscored by an
IFLA report that describes finding, identifying, selecting, and obtaining access
as the functional requirements of bibliographic records.2 While their procedures
may be different, these bibliographic tools, in fact, apply the same principles.
The principles have been shared but rarely articulated. Taylor3 and Hagler4 are
</p>
<p>2 ■ Organization of Information and Cataloging</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>probably the first writers to successfully describe the important principles of
information organization. Drawing on their ideas, a full set of the principles of
information organization can be set forth as follows.
</p>
<p>Principle One:
Definition of Scope and Selection Criteria
</p>
<p>The first principle for organizing information, regardless of the method
an organizer chooses, is the definition of the tool&rsquo;s scope. While it is desirable to
have one tool that organizes the entire information universe, that tool does not
exist, nor would it be feasible to do so. The part of the information universe a tool
covers could be the holdings of one archive, materials in a selected subject area,
or resources relevant to a particular user community. Many factors should be
considered when one defines the coverage of an information organization tool.
Knowledge of users&rsquo; information needs is the most critical factor.
</p>
<p>With information on user needs, the organizer then can develop selec-
tion criteria and begin searching the information universe for appropriate resources.
In a library, activities entailed by the first principle are usually in the domain of
the collection development department. The recent dramatic growth of elec-
tronic resources, however, has resulted in the increased participation of reference
staff and cataloging staff in this process.
</p>
<p>Principle Two:
Creation of Representation
</p>
<p>Once resources have been identified for coverage, the next concern is
the creation of a representation, or surrogate. The step is necessary because it is
generally believed that a representation is better than the source material itself
for access purposes. For example, instead of having an entire research report
available for searching, a record of the work with author, source, and subject infor-
mation can be created to make searching more efficient.
</p>
<p>The procedure for creating a representation varies by tools, but two
objectives are common to all. First, the representation should contain enough detail
to identify a resource. Second, it should include sufficient information to distin-
guish one resource from another.
</p>
<p>To ensure consistency in representation creation, various standards
have been created. Indexing agencies have guidelines on how to describe resources,
and citation style manuals offer similar advice. For cataloging purposes, the key
standards are the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd ed., 1998 revision
(AACR2R) and the MARC format standards.
</p>
<p>The Principles of Information Organization ■ 3</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Principle Three:
Analysis for Access
</p>
<p>Related to representation creation is the analysis of a resource for access.
The goal of this principle is to ensure that a tool serves the evaluation and collo-
cation functions. The organizer typically identifies people or organizations who
are responsible for, or have contributed substantially to, the intellectual content
of a work. Depending on the tools, authors, co-authors, and editors are likely
candidates to be selected as access points. Series titles, journal titles, and related
works have also been included as access points.
</p>
<p>In addition, the organizer analyzes the subject matter, or the &ldquo;about-
ness,&rdquo; of a work to inform users of its content. Indexers assign descriptors, abstrac-
tors create abstracts, bibliography compilers prepare annotations, and catalogers
assign subject headings. Some tools also make use of classification codes or
product codes. The objective is to enable users to conduct subject searches and
select from similar items.
</p>
<p>Besides non-subject and subject access points, authority control also
is needed to facilitate access and ensure collocation. Most tools strive to control
synonyms, homographs, and variant spellings, and to represent the relationships
of concepts in their subject authority lists. But not all tools make an effort to control
non-subject access points. The lack of consistency in non-subject access points,
as experienced in some online databases, becomes a burden on the searcher and
negatively affects access.
</p>
<p>Principle Four:
Organization of Resources and
</p>
<p>Their Representations
</p>
<p>The final principle is to decide how resources and their representa-
tions will be organized for access. If resources are owned locally, some kind of
location notation such as a call number is provided. The objective is to facilitate
retrieval of the needed item and to provide collocation on the shelf so that users,
especially shelf browsers, can select from similar items.
</p>
<p>If resources are located remotely, some mechanism such as a hyper-
text link can be provided for online access. Many online services have well-
established document delivery services and some have made full-text available
online on request, too.
</p>
<p>This principle also applies to the organization of representations.
This step is critical because it affects access to resources, especially in an online
environment. Unlike the manual environment where a user can thumb through
pages or drawers of cards, online tools provide few physical cues to users. The
screen display of representations informs the user of what is available. It then be-
comes critical that the order of the elements in a representation and the screen
display of multiple items be carefully designed. A successful design presents
</p>
<p>4 ■ Organization of Information and Cataloging</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>collocation on the screen and enable users to make good use of the resources
covered by the tool.
</p>
<p>■THE PRINCIPLES AND CATALOGING
The Principles and Cataloging
</p>
<p>As one of many methods for information organization, cataloging
closely follows the principles described above. A brief discussion of how these
principles are applied in cataloging and a summary of the standard procedure of
cataloging follow. The purpose is to prepare users new to cataloging for the work
in the next few chapters. Users familiar with cataloging procedures may find this
a good way to refresh their memory of the subject.
</p>
<p>In a library, the collection development staff usually performs the selec-
tion of resources, thus carrying out Principle One. Cataloging typically begins
after items arrive. In many libraries newly arrived items are searched in biblio-
graphic utilities such as Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) to determine
if records exist. If such records are found, copy cataloging procedures are fol-
lowed. If not, catalogers perform original cataloging on the items. Cataloging
consists of several major steps: description, assignment of access points, subject
analysis, authority control, MARC record creation, and contributing records to a
bibliographic utility. The purpose of descriptive cataloging is to create a repre-
sentation for an item. The representation must contain enough details for an item
to be identified and to be distinguished from others. This step puts Principle Two
into practice.
</p>
<p>The assignment of access points and the process of subject analysis
result in access points, subject and non-subject, for the bibliographic record.
Authority work is performed on all access points to ensure consistency and to
enhance retrieval. Thus, Principle Three is applied.
</p>
<p>The actual items and their representations are then processed for access.
They are assigned call numbers and placed on shelves, while their representa-
tions are put into machine-readable format and parsed for further manipulation.
Catalogers and system designers have decided how elements of the representa-
tions are displayed, and how multiple items are organized and displayed on
screen.5 This step puts Principle Four into practice.
</p>
<p>■ORGANIZING AUDIOVISUAL
AND ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
</p>
<p>Organizing Audiovisual and Electronic Materials
</p>
<p>Libraries have always organized, provided access to, and preserved
information that is believed to be meeting the needs of their users. The format in
which information is presented has expanded from physical to virtual, but the focus
of librarians continues to be on organizing information for access. Recent studies
have reported the proliferation of nonprint collections in libraries. In a survey of
</p>
<p>Organizing Audiovisual and Electronic Materials ■ 5</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Canadian libraries, Weihs and Howarth found that 93.7 percent of responding li-
braries have collected one or more types of nonprint media. Videorecordings were
the most frequently collected medium, followed by microforms, sound recordings,
cartographic material, computer software, and film, all owned by more than 50
percent of the libraries surveyed.6 A survey of the largest 100 American academic
and public libraries also found videorecordings to be the most popular medium
(collected by 99.3 percent of responding libraries) and sound recordings are
close behind (98.6 percent). Computer files are popular as well (96.6 percent)
and Internet resources are making an inroad (77.2 percent).7 Regarding the
method for organization, the Canadian study reported 75.1 percent of libraries
with nonbook collections used AACR2R to catalog all or part of their collections.
The U.S. study found a higher percentage of full cataloging activities among the
large libraries owning media&mdash;97.9 percent of the responding libraries fully cata-
loged their sound recording collections, 95.1 percent fully cataloged videos,
88.6 percent fully cataloged computer files, and 61.6 percent fully cataloged
Internet resources. Data suggest that AACR2R rules for sound recordings, video-
recordings, and computer files are accepted as the standards for cataloging such
materials.
</p>
<p>The latest additions to library collections are Internet resources. Their
organization remains a work in progress. Many librarians believe libraries
should integrate Internet resources into their collection because users demand
access8 and some valuable materials are available only on the Internet. Internet
resources are of varying quality, but librarians can add value to such resources
through careful selection and organization.9 From bookmarking to full catalog-
ing, librarians have attempted to impose order over parts of the Internet. Some
rely on simple grouping of resources, while others provide rating information
(e.g., Argus Clearinghouse10) or employ control vocabularies for better access&mdash;
for example, INFOMINE organizes resources with modified LC subject headings,11
</p>
<p>The Scout Report Signpost uses LC classification and subject headings,12 and Beyond
Bookmarks includes many projects that use classification schemes.13 Some projects
focus on a particular audience or a subject area (e.g., Kids Click!14 and SunSite&rsquo;s
Digital Library page15), while others have broader scope (e.g., Sailor16). An effort
that has the potential for organizing Internet resources on a larger scale is cata-
loging. The dynamic nature, volatility, and large number of Internet resources
have caused many to question the validity of cataloging Internet resources.17
</p>
<p>Some catalogers have worried that the Internet resources would be difficult to
catalog because they are hard to examine.18 But if evaluation criteria are applied,
the number of resources to be cataloged will become manageable,19 and new
technology and technique such as PURL (persistent URL) will address the problem
of link maintenance.20 The InterCat project has created an experimental catalog to
show that cataloging is a sensible solution to the management of Internet resources
if the resources are carefully selected and if libraries cooperate in this venture.21
</p>
<p>Although Internet resources are different from print resources, the
principles of bibliographic access can be applied to them. Mandel and Wolven
have discussed how these principles can be applied with the help of the latest
</p>
<p>6 ■ Organization of Information and Cataloging</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>technology and techniques such as Z39.50, field 856, encoding standards and
metadata.22 Projects such as InterCat and CATRIONA23 have demonstrated that
cataloging Internet resources is feasible. More libraries are actively including such
materials in their catalog. Chances are that libraries will be able to find reasonable
solutions to the organization of Internet resources because they have done so with
other formats of information successfully. In the 1960s and 1970s the concern was
about new nonprint resources such as sound recordings and videorecordings. In
the 1980s microcomputer files dominated catalogers&rsquo; attention. In the 1990s
Internet resources have presented catalogers with challenges and opportunities.
</p>
<p>■PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK
Purpose of This Book
</p>
<p>This book was developed to meet an increasing interest in cataloging
sound recordings, videorecordings, computer files, interactive multimedia, and
Internet resources. While the AACR2R rules for sound recordings and videore-
cordings remain stable, new guidelines have been published to supplement
Chapter 9 (Computer files) of AACR2R. This book uses examples to illustrate
the current standards and analyzes fully cataloged records to explain cataloging
considerations specific to each type of material. The objective is to help students,
catalogers, educators, and anyone new to these media gain competency in cata-
loging them. The book is designed both for self-study and for classroom use.
Readers can study the subjects at their own pace, and educators may find the text
useful for courses on media cataloging, advanced cataloging, and the cataloging of
Internet resources. Chapter Two provides an overview of the cataloging process,
which students new to cataloging will need to be prepared for the next few chap-
ters. Students and catalogers with some knowledge of monograph cataloging can
use this material to refresh their memory of the subject. Those familiar with
monograph cataloging can skip ahead to the chapters covering the specific media.
Chapters Three to Seven are devoted to the cataloging of sound recordings,
videorecordings, computer files, interactive multimedia, and Internet resources,
respectively. Each chapter begins with an introduction, followed by a discussion
of current standards and examples for descriptive cataloging, choice of access
points, and subject analysis. Each chapter concludes with analyses of 10 fully
cataloged records. The records were created according to the current standards
for descriptive cataloging and subject analysis. All the access points were
checked against the name and subject authority files on OCLC PRISM. New
names were established according to AACR2R.
</p>
<p>■CONCLUSION
Conclusion
</p>
<p>Libraries have successfully integrated new types of material into
their collections by developing sensible solutions to organize such materials.
</p>
<p>Conclusion ■ 7</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The best way to organize sound recordings, videorecordings, computer files, inter-
active multimedia, and Internet resources is to become familiar with the standards.
Then improvements can be made. Changes in technology will be continuous, which
will make the task of information organization both challenging and exciting. To
operate well in a changing information environment, librarians can take comfort
in knowing they have the proven principles of information organization. Those
principles, if applied intelligently and coupled with new technology and tech-
niques, will help them manage and organize information in all formats.

<p>Cataloging: An Overview
</p>
<p>■TREATMENT OF NONPRINT RESOURCES
Treatment of Nonprint Resources
</p>
<p>The cataloging of nonprint resources has evolved over time. Weihs
presented a historical perspective on bibliographic control of nonbook materials,1
</p>
<p>Intner2 and Frost3 detailed the development of cataloging rules for nonprints, and
Maillet described efforts to provide subject access to film and video.4 Among the
issues debated, uniformity in bibliographic access and equality in physical access
were the most critical. Uniformity in bibliographic access refers to the applica-
tion of the same cataloging rules to all types of material. This practice results in an
integrated catalog where users can retrieve items of interest regardless of their
format. Advocates of this omnimedia approach believe it would make retrieval
easier for users and encourage the use of nonprint resources.5 But opponents
have cited unique qualities of nonprints and recommended special treatment.6
</p>
<p>The cost of full cataloging has also caused concern and led libraries&rsquo; to adopt the
departmentalized approach, which separates nonprints from the book collection
and from the catalog. After several major changes, acceptable cataloging rules
have emerged and most libraries have adopted the omnimedia approach. A 1989
survey, for instance, reported that 73 percent of American libraries serving popula-
tion over 25,000 fully cataloged their nonprints.7 A 1995 report of the cataloging
practice of Canadian libraries of various types found 89.7 percent of libraries
owning sound recordings cataloged them, with 72.6 percent of them following
Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition (AACR2); 89.3 percent of li-
braries owning videorecordings cataloged them, with 72.1 percent of them follow
AACR2; and 70.9 percent of libraries owning computer files cataloged them, with
63.4 percent using AACR2.8 A 1998 study of the largest 100 public and aca-
demic libraries found more than 95 percent of responding libraries fully cata-
loged sound recordings and videorecordings.9 The integrated approach seems to
have been prevalent among large libraries, especially when sound recordings and
videorecordings are concerned. The omnimedia approach has been endorsed by
many practitioners and researchers.10
</p>
<p>Equality in physical access is a less settled issue. The goal is to pro-
vide the same access to print and nonprint resources, and one major approach is
intershelving all types of material. Patrons benefit from this approach because all
materials are organized under one system, and all works on the same subject are
collocated on the shelf. This approach may also attract new patrons and increase
use of the library.11 Concerns for security, maintenance, and space, however,
have led some libraries to adopt other methods for arranging nonprint resources.
</p>

<p>TWO � CATALOGING:
AN OVERVIEW</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For instance, Scholtz indicated that genre classification, not classification by
Dewey Decimal Classification or Library of Congress Classification, was popular
among public libraries.12 A 1998 study of top 100 public and academic libraries
found public librarians expressing a commitment to browsing and 99 percent
shelved sound recordings by format, while 94 percent shelved videorecordings
by format.13
</p>
<p>■DESCRIPTION
Description
</p>
<p>Current cataloging rules reflect a strong interest among librarians to
integrate various types of resources into the catalog. This chapter presents descrip-
tive cataloging rules and subject analysis approaches applicable to sound recordings,
videorecordings, computer files, interactive multimedia, and Internet resources.
Special issues related to these types of material are discussed in the chapters de-
voted to the specific media.
</p>
<p>To ensure consistency in record creation and to support international
sharing of bibliographic records, catalogers follow the Anglo-American Cata-
loguing Rules (AACR), which are based on the International Standard Biblio-
graphic Description (ISBD) and the Paris Principles. The current standard is the
revised edition of the second edition of AACR, commonly known as AACR2R.
AACR2R incorporates many changes to the second edition and the Library of
Congress&rsquo;s interpretations to the rules. Because of the emergence of new types
of resources, new guidelines have been developed to describe interactive multi-
media14 and Internet resources.15 Library of Congress Rule Interpretations16 con-
tinues to be an important tool for clarifying the application of AACR2R.
</p>
<p>The USMARC format continues to be the main guideline for catalogers.
Bibliographic utilities have developed their own MARC guidelines, too. Since
OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) is one of the most popular bibliographic
utilities, the OCLC guidelines for MARC records are followed in this book.
</p>
<p>The goal of descriptive cataloging is to create a bibliographic record
with sufficient details for an item to be identified and distinguished from others.
Part I of AACR2R is devoted to this effort. Chapter 1 presents general rules that
can be applied to materials of all formats, and is followed by chapters on specific
media. The structure of Chapter 1 is used in all other chapters in Part I. For example,
Chapter 1 stipulates eight areas for description:
</p>
<p>Area 1. Title and Statement of Responsibility (MARC field 245)
</p>
<p>Area 2. Edition (MARC field 250)
</p>
<p>Area 3. Material Specific Details
</p>
<p>Area 4. Publication, Distribution, Etc. (MARC field 260)
</p>
<p>Area 5. Physical Description (MARC field 300)
</p>
<p>12 ■ Cataloging: An Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Area 6. Series (MARC field 4xx)
</p>
<p>Area 7. Notes (MARC field 5xx)
</p>
<p>Area 8. International standard numbers (MARC fields 020 or 022)
</p>
<p>And the same rule structure is repeated in chapters on specific media in Part I.
For instance, Rule 1.4 instructs catalogers to transcribe information related to the
publisher, Rule 2.4 explains how to transcribe the place, name, and date of a
book publisher, and Rule 6.4 provides instructions on how to record the place,
name, and date of a sound recording publisher. Catalogers consult Chapter 1 and
also the chapter dealing with the medium being cataloged. The parallel structure
in the rules simplifies the use of AACR2R.
</p>
<p>The next section summarizes Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of AACR2R to
give readers an overview of the basics of cataloging.
</p>
<p>Rules for Descriptive Cataloging
</p>
<p>Levels of Description
</p>
<p>Following Charles A. Cutter&rsquo;s model, AACR2R allows three levels
of description. The first level is brief and contains few basic elements to identify
an item (see 1.0D1 for example). Libraries with limited resources sometimes
adopt this level of description to make their holdings known to users. The second
level of description has been considered the standard level of cataloging. It in-
cludes the eight areas stipulated by 1.0B1 and contains elements listed under
1.0D2. Most libraries catalog their materials by this level of specification. The
third level of description offers far more details than the second level and is often
used for materials of local significance or rare book materials.
</p>
<p>Chief Source and Prescribed
Sources of Information
</p>
<p>In describing any type of publication, the cataloger looks for the
chief source of information first. The chief source is specified at the beginning of
each chapter in Part I of AACR2R to ensure consistency in cataloging. Informa-
tion in the chief source of information is preferred to information from other areas
of the item. For each area of the description AACR2R prescribes one or more
sources. The cataloger should use square brackets for information taken from
outside the prescribed sources.
</p>
<p>Area 1. Title and Statement of
Responsibility (MARC field 245)
</p>
<p>Description ■ 13</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>245 _ _ Title proper $h [GMD] : $b other title information / $c
statement of responsibility ; subsequent statement of
responsibility.
</p>
<p>Area 1 includes several elements, and the order of the elements and the punctua-
tion pattern are shown above. In this area the main task is to record the title
proper verbatim, following exactly its wording, order, and spelling, but not nec-
essarily its punctuation or capitalization. The objective is to show users how the
title is presented in the chief source.
</p>
<p>If a general material designation (GMD) is used, it follows the title
proper in square brackets. A GMD is useful for indicating the medium of any
nonprint materials. Libraries in Australia, Canada, and the United States use
terms on List 2 provided in AACR2R, and the Library of Congress makes use of
only a small number of these terms, including computer file, filmstrip, kit, micro-
form, motion picture, slide, sound recording, transparency, and videorecording
(CSB 44: 10).
</p>
<p>Other title information is transcribed according to the same rules for
the title proper. Statements of responsibility appearing prominently are tran-
scribed, and people performing different functions for the item, such as authors
and editors, are separated by semicolons.
</p>
<p>Area 2. Edition (MARC field 250)
</p>
<p>250 Edition statement / $b statement of responsibility
relating to the edition.
</p>
<p>If an edition statement is found on the item, it is transcribed using abbreviations
in Appendix B and numerals in Appendix C of AACR2R. If a statement of re-
sponsibility is related to one particular edition, it is transcribed after the edition
statement.
</p>
<p>250 Definitive ed. / $b edited, with an introduction, by
Susan Sontag.
</p>
<p>One caveat about the edition statement is that it should be a formal
statement found on the item. The cataloger should not infer an edition from an
item. For example, &ldquo;first published in America in 1988&rdquo; should not be inter-
preted as the first American edition.
</p>
<p>Area 3. Material Specific Details Area
</p>
<p>Only four types of materials&mdash;cartographic materials, music, com-
puter files, and serials&mdash;make use of this area. Some microforms also have this

<p>Area 4. Publication, Distribution, Etc. (MARC field 260)
</p>
<p>260 Place of publication : $b Name of publisher, $c Date
of publication.
</p>
<p>The place of publication is transcribed as it appears. The first place of publica-
tion is always transcribed, using abbreviations from Appendix B. The name of
country, state, province, etc. is added in square brackets if it is necessary to dis-
tinguish between places or identify a place.
</p>

<p>[S.D.]
</p>
<p>If the name of a larger jurisdiction appears with a place name in the prescribed
source, the Library of Congress adds it to Area 4 even though it may not be nec-
essary for identification purpose. If the name of a larger jurisdiction does not appear
with a place name in the prescribed source, the Library of Congress adds it in square
brackets when there is a need to distinguish between places or identify a place.
</p>
<p>In the prescribed source: Indianapolis, Indiana
Transcribed by LC as: Indianapolis, Ind.

Transcribed by LC as: San Francisco
</p>
<p>If the first place of publication is not in the home country of the cata-
loging agency or if the layout or typography suggests another place to be more
important, then a second place of publication should be added.
</p>
<p>In the prescribed source: Toronto London Chicago
A US library will transcribe: Toronto ; Chicago
</p>
<p>The name of the publisher should be recorded in the shortest possible
form that is recognizable internationally. Reference tools such as Books in Print
are good sources to determine to what extent the name of a publisher can be
shortened. Initial articles and terms such as &ldquo;limited&rdquo; and &ldquo;incorporated&rdquo; are
dropped. If in doubt, the cataloger should not shorten a publisher&rsquo;s name.
</p>
<p>If a publisher responsible for an item is a subordinate unit of a parent
organization, the name of the division, not that of the parent organization, should
be recorded.

</p>
<p>The publication date of the edition in hand is the third element for
Area 4. Publication date is preferred to copyright date or printing date. If a publica-
tion date is not available, the cataloger records the copyright date. If a copyright
date is not available, a printing date is used. AACR2R offers an option to include
both the publication date and the copyright date if they are different. The Library
of Congress decided in 1989 that it would not apply this option to monographs or
print serials.

</p>
<p>300 Extent : $b Other details ; $c Dimensions + $e
Accompanying material.
</p>
<p>The extent of an item is recorded as the number of physical units in Arabic numerals
and the specific material designation. For books the cataloger records the number
of pages, such as &ldquo;320 p.&rdquo; For nonprint materials, the cataloger should consult the
.5B subrules in the relevant chapter. For example, for sound recordings (covered
in Chapter 6 of AACR2R), consult 6.5B.
</p>
<p>If playing time is available, it follows the physical units description
in parentheses.

<p>If other physical details of an item are available, they are included as
the second element in the field 300. Examples include color, tracks, recording
methods, and playing speed. For dimension of the item, the cataloger will need
to consult rules in the relevant chapters.
</p>
<p>300 1 sound disc (62 min.) : $b digital, stereo. ; $c 4 3/4 in.
</p>
<p>Accompanying material can be included in the record in several
ways. A common approach is to provide the number of physical units in Arabic
numerals and a descriptive term of the material at the end of Area 5.
</p>
<p>300 1 sound disc (62 min.) : $b digital, stereo ; $c 4 3/4 in.

</p>
<p>490 _ Series title.
</p>
<p>490 _ Series title as it appears in the item [not to be used
for added entry]
</p>
<p>830 _ Series title as added entry.
</p>
<p>Series titles are usually found in the chief source or other prescribed
sources. A series title should be transcribed according to the same rules for tran-
scribing title proper. If the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) appears
on the item, it is transcribed in Area 6. The number of an item within a series is in
Arabic form. Abbreviations in Appendix B are used and the numbering appears
as the last element in Area 6.
</p>
<p>Other title information is rarely included in the transcription of Area
6. The statement of responsibility is usually not included in Area 6, however,
AACR2R instructs that if a statement of responsibility is needed to identify a series,
it can be included. The Library of Congress interprets this to mean adding state-
ments to titles which are meaningless by themselves (CSB 22: 16), for example,
Occasional papers / National Geological Society.
</p>
<p>Series information can be entered in the 440 field if it is to serve as an
added entry; otherwise 490 is used. When a series title is to be used as an added
entry but in a form different from that on the item, both 490 and 830 are used. In
this case, the series title on the item is recorded in 490, and the series title to be
used as an access point is recorded in 830.

<p>Area 7. Notes (field 5xx)
</p>
<p>Notes supplement information formally presented in the first six areas
of a record. Some notes provide identifying information, some indicate the nature
of an item, while others offer background information such as the intended audi-
ence. Rules under 1.7 cover various types of notes the cataloger may want to pro-
vide. The notes for specific types of materials can be found in chapters on
specific media.
</p>
<p>Notes serve at least two major purposes:
</p>
<p>1. They offer additional information about an item that cannot be
recorded in one of the first six areas.
</p>
<p>2. They justify the provision of additional access points.
</p>
<p>The content of a note can be taken from any suitable source. Quotations
can be used in notes. For quotations not taken from the chief source of informa-
tion the cataloger will need to indicate the source:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceedings of a Symposium on Hypertension&rdquo;--T.p. verso.
</p>
<p>Notes providing general information about an item as a whole are
presented first. The rest of the notes are presented in the same order as the eight
areas specified by AACR2R. Some of the more popular notes are:
</p>
<p>1.7B1. Nature, scope, or artistic form (field 500)
</p>
<p>1.7B2. Language of the item and/or translation or adaptation (field 546)

<p>The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or International

standard number is available, the one describing the item in hand should be
recorded first. Both AACR2R and the Library of Congress allow the option of
including additional standard numbers with qualification added.

</p>
<p>Assignment of Access Points
</p>
<p>Part II of AACR2R is based on the Paris principles. Chapter 21 stipu-
lates how access points should be selected, and Chapters 22 to 25 offer details for
developing headings. The chief source of information of the item being cata-
loged is the main source for potential access points. Other statements that appear
prominently (i.e., in the prescribed sources for the first two areas of the type of
materials cataloged) should be considered as well.
</p>
<p>Personal authorship: AACR2R defines a personal author as &ldquo;the
person chiefly responsible for the creation of the intellectual or artistic content of
a work&rdquo; (21.1A1, p. 312). The choice of access points follows the tradition of
honoring individuals responsible for a work, and catalogers&rsquo; rule of three applies.
That is, if there are no more than three authors involved in the creation of a work,
all three authors will be assigned access points, with the first one as the main access
point if no indication of principal authorship is available. But if more than three
authors are involved, then the main access point is the title and only the first named
author is used as an access point. The rule of three applies to editors as well.
</p>
<p>Corporate bodies: AACR2R defines a corporate body as &ldquo;an organi-
zation or a group of persons that is identified by a particular name and that acts,
or may act, as an entity&rdquo; (21.1B1, p. 312). The rules for using corporate bodies as
the main access point have evolved and become more stringent. A work must
emanate from one or more corporate bodies and must belong to one of the six
categories of materials for it to be entered under a corporate body (see 21.1B2 for
details). In case of doubt, AACR2R encourages catalogers not to use a corporate
body as the main access point.
</p>
<p>Description ■ 19</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Title as the main access point: There are only four occasions when title
becomes the main access point:
</p>
<p>1. When there are more than three authors (see 21.6C2) or when
the authorship is unknown (see 21.5).
</p>
<p>2. When the item being cataloged is a collection of works by
many people or corporate bodies (see 21.7).
</p>
<p>3. When the item emanates from a corporate body but does not
belong to any of the six categories stipulated by Rule 21.1B2.
</p>
<p>4. When the item is a sacred scripture of a religious group (see
21.37).
</p>
<p>AACR2R also stipulates how adapters, illustrators, revisers, com-
mentators, translators, and persons being honored by a work should be used as
access points (see 21.9-21.15). In addition, it offers guidelines for determining
access points for artworks, musical works, and sound recordings (see 21.23).
Rules under 21.29 provide general rules for added entries and Rules under 21.30
include specific rules on when to assign individuals, corporate bodies, titles, and
series as added entries. Rule 21.29C gives catalogers the authority to make an
added entry &ldquo;if some catalogue users might suppose that the description of an item
would be found&rdquo; under the added entry (p. 354). Rule 21.29F also states that if the
description does not clearly indicate why an added entry is made, a note should be
provided. AACR2R DOES NOT specify the order of added entries in a descrip-
tion, but an LC interpretation (21.29:CSB 12) gives the order of added entries:
</p>
<p>1. Personal name;
</p>
<p>2. Personal name/title;
</p>
<p>3. Corporate name;
</p>
<p>4. Corporate name/title;
</p>
<p>5. Uniform title (all instances of works entered under title);
</p>
<p>6. Title traced as Title-period;
</p>
<p>7. Title traced as Title-colon, followed by a title;
</p>
<p>8. Series.
</p>
<p>Within each group the added entries should follow the order in which the data
appear in the bibliographic description. Nonprint materials are often the results
of many individuals&rsquo; efforts, and it is not unusual for a work to have many added
entries. Rules relevant to the selected resources in this book and the Library of
Congress&rsquo;s interpretations to them are discussed in later chapters.
</p>
<p>20 ■ Cataloging: An Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Chapters 22 to 26 cover headings for persons, headings for geo-
graphic names, headings for corporate bodies, uniform titles, and references.
With the help of the Library of Congress Name Authority Files (LCNAF), cata-
logers can simplify authority work substantially. But for names not found in
LCNAF, catalogers will need to consult Chapters 22 to 26 to establish headings.
</p>
<p>■ SUBJECT ANALYSIS
Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>Catalogers analyze the content of materials to enable users to search
and evaluate these materials. Subject analysis can be performed using controlled
vocabulary or natural language. In the library environment controlled vocabu-
lary such as subject headings or descriptors are regularly assigned to indicate the
aboutness of materials. In addition, catalogers have used another form of con-
trolled vocabulary, classification numbers, or codes, for this purpose. No matter
which form of controlled vocabulary they use, catalogers must perform authority
control on the indexing terms to control for synonyms, homographs, and variant
spellings, and to represent the relationships among authorized terms.
</p>
<p>The objectives of subject analysis are to indicate the content of a
work and to collocate works on the same subject. Before choosing the language
for subject indexing and deciding the extent to which an item should be analyzed,
the cataloger needs to know the intended users of the catalog. Serious researchers
may appreciate scientific language and in-depth indexing, while public library users
will prefer less technical terminology and less exhaustive indexing. Because it
covers a wide range of subjects and contains many headings, many research,
academic and large public libraries have used the Library of Congress Subject
Headings. Sears List of Subject Headings has been more prevalent in small and
medium-sized public libraries and school libraries. Regardless of the specific
differences between these authority lists, the same principles of subject catalog-
ing apply. David Judson Haykin, a well-regarded chief of the Library of Con-
gress&rsquo;s subject division in the 1950s, had discussed these principles,17 and Lois
Mai Chan has elaborated on the subject cataloging principles and practices of the
Library of Congress.18 These principles include user and usage, literary warrant,
uniform heading, unique heading, specific entry and co-extensivity, internal
consistency, and stability. If these principles are applied to a local environment
in creating local subject headings, catalogers must always keep users in mind,
using the terminology appropriate to the users&rsquo; intellectual level. In addition,
catalogers should make sure one subject is represented by one heading and address
problems of synonyms, variant spellings, different phrasings, and homographs.
Catalogers need to create headings that are specific to the subjects they repre-
sent, and the headings should be directly accessible. For example, if the cata-
loger needs to establish a heading for a particular kind of flower such as lilies,
then &ldquo;lilies,&rdquo; which is the most specific heading, should be created, not something
less direct like &ldquo;Botany--Flower--Lilies.&rdquo; In addition, catalogers need to maintain
</p>
<p>Subject Analysis ■ 21</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>form and structural consistency among analogous headings and keep them stable
within a subject system.
</p>
<p>The first step in subject analysis is to determine the subject of a work.
Catalogers examine the title, author&rsquo;s preface, table of contents, and the bibliog-
raphy, if necessary. The containers, accompanying materials, and &ldquo;README&rdquo;
files (for computer files only) often provide useful information on the subject of
sound recordings, videorecordings, and computer files. For Internet resources,
meta tags in the HTML header and &ldquo;About this page&rdquo; type of links often shed
light on the subject of a page. Once the subject is determined, the next step is to
translate the subject into authorized headings. The procedures for subject cata-
loging are detailed in the Library of Congress Subject Cataloging Manual,19 and
H180 in particular offers specific instructions. The guidelines can be summarized
as follows:
</p>
<p>Summative approach: Catalogers should identify topics of a work
and try to find headings that will summarize the contents. This practice
has a long tradition in cataloging and is rooted in the manual environ-
ment. Due to advances in technology, many catalogers have urged
the Library of Congress to provide more in-depth analysis. The
guideline now allows catalogers to assign up to 10 subject headings.
</p>
<p>Substantial treatment required: Only topics treated substantially in a
work should be assigned subject headings. The general rule is if a
topic takes up at least 20 percent of a work, then it should be repre-
sented by a heading.
</p>
<p>Specific and direct headings: Following the principle of co-
extensivity, catalogers should assign specific and direct headings to
represent the content of a work. For a work about dolphins, the most
specific and direct heading is &ldquo;dolphins.&rdquo; For a work about mammals,
the most specific and direct heading is &ldquo;mammals.&rdquo; The Library of
Congress also discourages catalogers from assigning specific head-
ings and general headings at the same time, with few exceptions. So
catalogers should not assign both mammals and dolphins to either of
the works above.
</p>
<p>Aspects of a topic: Because LC subject headings are highly precoor-
dinated, catalogers are urged to find appropriate phrase headings or
subdivisions to represent aspects of a topic. In addition to the subdi-
visions listed in the authority list, there are pattern headings to follow
and free-floating subdivisions to use. If two or more topics are in a
work, catalogers should consider the relationship of these topics in
choosing headings. If more than three topics are in a work and they
constitute the whole of a broader subject, a heading for the broad
subject is used. But if these topics do not constitute the whole of a
broader subject, then catalogers should assign a heading for each
topic. Assigning subject headings takes practice. Various handbooks
provide good exercises.20
</p>
<p>22 ■ Cataloging: An Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Another method to represent subject analysis work is by classifica-
tion number. The Library of Congress Classification scheme (LCC) and the
Dewey Decimal Classification scheme (DDC) have been the two dominant sys-
tems. Both systems are discipline-based, hierarchical, and enumerative. Based
on the principle of literary warrant, LCC reflects the collection of the Library of
Congress and continues to expand as the collection grows. DDC was initially
based on a classification of W. T. Harris, which was based on an inverted order
of Francis Bacon&rsquo;s classification of knowledge,21 but has evolved to accommodate
new subjects&mdash;for instance, the expansion of numbers, 004-006, for computer
science. With more than 20 major classes, LCC has been popular in research,
academic, and large public libraries. DDC has a more compact structure and
contains only 10 major classes, but its history, reputation, and structure have
made it a popular system outside the United States.
</p>
<p>The procedure for assigning classification number is the same regard-
less of the format of the material being cataloged. The cataloger identifies the
main thrust of the work (e.g., teaching ecology in elementary schools), deter-
mines the discipline in which the topic is treated (e.g., education [300]), then focuses
on the corresponding class (e.g., elementary education in specific subjects
[372.3-372.8]) to find the most specific classification number for a work (e.g.,
natural study [372.357]). The Library of Congress does not assign class numbers
to audiovisual media and special instructional materials but has provided alter-
nate class numbers in brackets to films, sound recordings, slide sets, and so on to
aid catalogers outside of LC.22 Nonprint materials are classified in the same manner
as print materials. Table 1 of DDC includes provisions for some formats (e.g.,
encyclopedias, periodicals, handbooks) but the medium or form of a work is usually
not represented in DDC numbers, rather, it is recorded elsewhere in the biblio-
graphic record.23 After the classification number has been assigned, the cataloger
usually assigns an author number to provide further subdivision within the same
subject. This author number is often called the Cutter number because the numbers
are from Cutter tables. LCC has its own Cutter table, while DDC can be used
with any Cutter tables. Date of publication is also added to make the call number
complete. Call numbers in most American libraries serve as the addresses of
works on the shelves.
</p>
<p>■MARC FORMAT
MARC Format
</p>
<p>Bibliographic records created according to AACR2R and assigned
subject headings and classification numbers will then be coded in the MAchine-
Readable Cataloging (MARC) format to support searching and manipulation of
these records. The Library of Congress developed the LC MARC format in the
1960s, which evolved into the USMARC.24 USMARC includes five formats for
the encoding of five types of data&mdash;bibliographic, authority, holdings, commu-
nity information, and classification data. The Library of Congress maintains
these standards and provides documentation for them. The format catalogers use
</p>
<p>MARC Format ■ 23</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>most frequently is the bibliographic format. But bibliographic utilities, such as
the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) and the Research Library Informa-
tion Network (RLIN), have also developed guidelines specific to their environ-
ment, and catalogers will need to consult those guidelines to conform to their
input standards.
</p>
<p>A USMARC record contains a leader, a directory, control fields, variable
control fields, and variable fields.25 The leader is the first 24 characters of the record
and each position encodes information necessary for computer processing. The ele-
ments encoded include record status, type of record, bibliographic level, encoding
level, and others. The directory refers to a block of data following the leader that
lists the tags in the record and their respective starting positions. The directory is
constructed by computer based on cataloging information. All control fields begin
with the digit 0 (0XX) and are used to encode information such as Library of
Congress control numbers (010), International Standard Book Numbers (020),
and classification numbers (082, 050, etc.). The variable control fields are
tagged 00X. They can contain a single data or a series of data. For instance, the
007 field for sound recording has more than 10 subfields. Field 008, the field of
&ldquo;Fixed-Length Data Elements,&rdquo; is very valuable because its 40 characters can be
used to identify and retrieve records that meet the search criteria of the user.
Field 008 is format specific and not repeatable. Bibliographic utilities like
OCLC have added labels to the fixed field elements and place the block of infor-
mation at the top of their bibliographic records, but others display it differently.
The variable fields contain descriptive cataloging data and access points and are
the parts most users see on their online catalogs, often with labels supplied by the
system vendors.
</p>
<p>Each variable field begins with a three digit tag, followed by two indi-
cators, then appropriate subfields. The variable fields correspond closely to elements
and areas specified by AACR. The following scheme illustrates the relationship
of MARC fields to areas in AACR:
</p>
<p>Variable field AACR
1XX Main entry (except for title main entry)
245 Area 1. Title and statement of responsibility
250 Area 2. Edition statement
260 Area 4. Publication place, publisher, date
300 Area 5. Extent of item
4XX Area 6. Series
5XX Area 7. Notes
6XX Subject added entries
7XX Non-subject added entries
</p>
<p>24 ■ Cataloging: An Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The tags are displayed according to the first digit, but within each group (2xx,
4xx, 5xx, etc.), the order of the tags is stipulated by AACR. The USMARC pro-
vides the scheme for content designation, but it is AACR that specifies the data
elements (the content) and the order of the elements in the bibliographic record.
Throughout this book records will be presented in the MARC format excluding
the fixed field and many of the 00X fields, except when these fields are necessary
to illustrate cataloging practices.
</p>
<p>Prior to Format Integration catalogers had seven MARC biblio-
graphic formats from which to choose. Based on the primary characteristics of a
work, the cataloger selected the appropriate format to encode the item, and sec-
ondary but important characteristics could not be represented. For instance, for a
videorecording serial, the cataloger had to choose between a serials format and a
videorecording format. To correct such problems, reduce the cost of maintaining
seven bibliographic formats, and remove the need to create new formats when
new forms of intellectual expression appear, the Library of Congress and the
MARBI (Machine-Readable Bibliographic Information) Committee of the
American Library Association began exploring the integration process in the
early 1980s.26 When Format Integration was completed in March of 1996, many
fields and values became obsolete and new ones were added to make most of the
fields and codes valid for all forms of material. Many of the changes affect serial
catalogers, but changes such as the creation of field 006, &ldquo;field-length data element&mdash;
additional material characteristics,&rdquo; and the use of field 246 for variant titles affect
the entire cataloging community. An appendix to Update No. 1 of the USMARC
Format for Bibliographic Data summarizes the changes.27
</p>
<p>Field 006 is probably one of the most important results of Format Inte-
gration. By using several 006 fields, catalogers are able to represent multiple aspects
of a work or the characteristics of accompanying material. There are seven types
of 006 fields, including 006 for books, serials, maps, music, visual materials,
computer files, and archival materials. This field has 18 character positions and
is optional and repeatable. Field 006 has a tree structure by which the form of the
material (the first code) determines what other data elements are allowed for
subsequent character positions. For instance, if the first element is coded &ldquo;a&rdquo; for
monographs, then the following data elements are allowed:
</p>
<p>Books Format 006 Information
T006: a Ills: Audn: Form: Cont: Gpub:
Conf: 0 Fest: 0 Indx: 0 Fict: 0 Biog:
</p>
<p>This example illustrates that 006 uses the same mnemonics as the fixed field.
OCLC provides prompts for data input for this field. Field 006 has no indicator
values or subfield codes, and data elements are identified by their position. In the
OCLC system brackets are used to present this field. For example, if a Web page
is basically textual, the book format workform is used to create a record, and the
008 field for the book format will be used (with the &ldquo;Type&rdquo; coded as &ldquo;a&rdquo;) . To reflect
the fact that the work is a Web page, the cataloger will enter &ldquo;n006 com&rdquo; (without
the quotation marks) and press &lt;F11&gt;, and a screen for 006 input will appear:

T006: m Audn: File: u GPub:
</p>
<p>After the cataloger enters the appropriate codes&mdash;using &ldquo;m&rdquo; for the first element
to specify computer file, and &ldquo;d&rdquo; for File to specify this is primarily a text
file&mdash;field 006 will appear on the record this way:28
</p>
<p>006 [m d ]
</p>
<p>Elements in 006 use the same codes for the fixed field elements (except for &ldquo;s&rdquo; in
T006 for serials).
</p>
<p>In creating a MARC record the first decision catalogers must make is
about the appropriate 008 field for the item being cataloged. To help catalogers
make this decision a model for selecting the 008 field is provided below.
</p>
<p>26 ■ Cataloging: An Overview
</p>
<p>MODEL for Selecting 008 Field29
</p>
<p>If an item is basically textual
</p>
<p>Type of record (position 06 in the Leader) = a (language material), p
(mixed material) or t (manuscript language material)
</p>
<p>Bibliographic level (position 07 in the Leader)  =  any valid code
</p>
<p>008  =  Book, serial (depending on Leader 06/07 codes), or mixed
material
</p>
<p>006  =  any applicable to main item or accompanying material
</p>
<p>If an item is basically nontextual
</p>
<p>Type of record (position 06 in the Leader) = c (printed music), d (manu-
script music), e (printed map), f (manuscript map), g (pro-
jected medium), i (nonmusical sound recording), j (musical
sound recording), k (two-dimensional nonprojectable
graphic), m (computer file), o (kit), or r (three-dimensional ar-
tifact or naturally occurring object)
</p>
<p>Bibliographic level (position 07 in the Leader)  =  Any valid code
</p>
<p>008  =  Music, map, visual material, or computer file
</p>
<p>006  =  any applicable to main item or accompanying material</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>So a book accompanied by a computer disk will be coded as follows:
</p>
<p>Type of record  =  a Bibliographic level  =  m
008 for the Book format will be used
</p>
<p>006 for the Computer File format will be used to cover the
accompanying disk.
</p>
<p>A computer program accompanied by a manual, however, will be coded as follows:
</p>
<p>Type of record  =  m Bibliographic level  =  m
008 for the Computer File format will be used
</p>
<p>006 for the Book format will be used to cover the
accompanying manual.
</p>
<p>The use of 006 fields is further discussed in Chapter 7, where items of multiple
characteristics are more common than the other chapters. It should be pointed
out that 006 and 007 serve different purposes. Field 006 describes additional
characteristics of an item or the characteristics of accompanying material, while
field 007 describes the physical characteristics of the item or the material accom-
panying it. The use of field 007 is discussed in relevant chapters.
</p>
<p>Other important changes of Format Integration include the addition of
field 856 (Electronic Location and Access) for remote access electronic resources,
and subfield $v (form subdivision) to designate specific kinds or genres of material.
Details of field 856 are included in Chapter 7, the chapter for Internet resources.
The objective of form subdivision is to enable online catalogs to provide better
display of records and assist users in searching. Subfield $v became valid after
Format Integration in 1996, and the Library of Congress issued guidelines on
form subdivisions and the use of subfield code $v in the fall of 1998.30 The guide-
lines instruct catalogers to code a subdivision as $v (form subdivision) when it
indicates what an item is, and to code it as $x (topical subdivision) when it char-
acterizes what an item is about. See, for example,
</p>
<p>650 0 Biology $v Periodicals.
[assigned to a journal on biology. $v indicates the form of this
publication.]
</p>
<p>650 0 Biology $x Periodicals.
[assigned to a work that discusses biology journals.]
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress began implementing subfield $v in February, 1999 and
has created authority records for subdivisions. All records include usage instruc-
tion, and two records are created for subdivisions that can be used as topical and
form subdivisions. Taylor presented an educational forum31 on subdivision $v at
the 1999 ALA midwinter meeting and has maintained a site on the implementa-
tion of form subdivisions.32 Sha has a Web page that lists free-floating form sub-
divisions from the Library of Congress Subject Headings.33

<p>■ARRANGEMENT
Arrangement
</p>
<p>The physical arrangement of materials, especially electronic resources,
may not necessarily follow the call numbers. In fact, while many libraries assign
subject headings to electronic resources to support subject collocation on their
online catalogs, many of them have developed in-house systems to shelve nonprint
resources. These systems are developed to address the concerns for the security
and preservation of nonprint resources. But with the growth of electronic resources,
the demand for easy access from users will likely become stronger. It is clearly
challenging to organize sound recordings, videorecordings, computer software,
multimedia, and Internet resources for easy local and remote access. Factors to
consider in organizing and arranging audiovisual and electronic resources will
be discussed in the chapters on these media.

<p>Sound Recordings
</p>
<p>Chapter 6 of AACR2R covers sound recordings in various formats, including
disc (long playing records and compact discs), tape (open reel-to-reel, cassettes,
cartridges), rolls, and sound recordings on film (excluding those designed to accom-
pany films). Advanced technology and convenience have led to the popularity of
sound cassettes and compact discs (CDs), which are noted for their sound quality
and durability. Most examples in this chapter are for sound cassettes and CDs.
</p>
<p>Sound recordings pose several challenges for catalogers:
</p>
<p>1. Unlike print publishers, who have a fairly standard pattern for
presenting information on the title page, publishers of sound
recordings tend to vary in their presentation of information on
the item and its label, which are designated the chief source of
information by AACR2R.
</p>
<p>2. Sound recordings are frequently accompanied by textual materials
and come in a container. Details on sound engineers, graphic
designers, illustrators, and others often appear in various parts of
a sound recording, making it difficult to determine which infor-
mation to transcribe.
</p>
<p>3. Physical description of sound recordings involves more elements
than print publications and requires more attention to the descrip-
tion of the physical characteristics.
</p>
<p>4. The publication place is often missing in sound recordings,
which means the cataloger may need to consult reference tools
for the information.
</p>
<p>Decision on access points can also be challenging because of the large number of
people involved in the creation of a sound recording. Fortunately AACR2R offers
fairly specific guidelines for these areas in Chapter 21.
</p>
<p>■MARC FIELDS FOR SOUND RECORDINGS
MARC Fields for Sound Recordings
</p>
<p>The MARC2 Concise Bibliographic Format1 and OCLC&rsquo;s Biblio-
graphic Formats and Standards2 provide details on codes and tags and are valu-
able resources for creating MARC records. Because of the large number of
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>THREE � SOUND RECORDINGS</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>codes for fixed field elements, records in this chapter do not include fixed field
information. But field 007, required for sound recording, is introduced to illus-
trate how physical characteristics of sound recordings are encoded. Field 007 for
the sound recording format has 13 subfields, many of them mandatory. Three
subfields (j, k, and l) are for archival cataloging of sound recordings. Subfield a
is coded &ldquo;s&rdquo; for sound recording, codes for the rest of the subfields are listed in
Bibliographic Formats and Standards, an online version is also available.3 Infor-
mation in field 300 is the basis for coding field 007, so it is important to record
field 300 correctly according to AACR2R. Because sound cassettes and compact
discs are popular media for sound recordings, the following examples present
subfields common to cassettes and compact discs.
</p>
<p>007 s $b special material designation $d speed $e playback chan-
nels $f groove width $g dimensions $h tape width $i tape

<p>■DESCRIPTION
Description
</p>
<p>Rules for Descriptive Cataloging
</p>
<p>Chief Source and Prescribed Sources of Information
</p>
<p>AACR2R stipulates the same chief source of information for all types
of sound recordings&mdash;the physical item (the disc, the reel, the cassette, the car-
tridge, etc.) and the &ldquo;label,&rdquo; which is permanently affixed to the item. If an item
has labels on both sides, both labels should be treated as part of the chief source.
</p>
<p>If no information can be found from the chief source, catalogers may
take information, in this order of preference, from accompanying textual material,
container, or other sources. If sound data and textual data are both available, the
cataloger should use textual data.
</p>
<p>The same eight areas of bibliographic description for print materials
are used in describing sound recordings. The prescribed sources of information
for each area (Rule 6.0B2) are as follows:
</p>
<p>245 (Area 1) Chief source of information
</p>
<p>250, 260, 4xx (Areas 2, 4, 6) Chief source of information,
accompanying textual
information and container
</p>
<p>300, 5xx, 020, 022 (Areas 5, 7, 8) Any source
</p>
<p>6.1. Title and Statement of Responsibility
(MARC field 245)
</p>
<p>The title of a sound recording should be transcribed exactly as to
wording, spelling, and order, but the punctuation and capitalization may vary.
This rule, 6.1B1, is the same as 1.1B1. Here are a few examples:
</p>
<p>Men are from Mars, women are from Venus
</p>
<p>Morning aire
</p>
<p>James Joyce&rsquo;s Chamber music [a book of poems by Joyce]
</p>
<p>Diana Ross greatest hits
</p>
<p>6 sonatas, BWV 1030-1035
</p>
<p>The first word of the title proper must be capitalized but not necessar-
ily the rest of the title. Proper names should be capitalized and the first word of
another title, such as &ldquo;Chamber music,&rdquo; should be capitalized.
</p>
<p>34 ■ Sound Recordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>General Material Designation (GMD): For sound recordings in all
formats the GMD is &ldquo;sound recording.&rdquo; Terms such as CD, sound cassette or LP
are not used. In the physical description area the cataloger provides more details
on the format, which is represented by specific material designation (SMD).
</p>
<p>Statement of Responsibility: For this element, AACR2R instructs the
cataloger to record only writers, composers, and collectors of field materials if
these names appear prominently. &ldquo;Prominently&rdquo; means the names must appear in
the chief source, accompanying textual materials, or container of a sound recording.
Performers of popular, rock, and jazz music, who do more than perform or inter-
pret a piece of music (for example, who also compose or arrange it), are recorded
in the statement of responsibility. But performers of classical music or narrators
are usually recorded in the note area. The Library of Congress has strict guide-
lines for this: &ldquo;The rule allows performers who do more than perform to be
named in the statement of responsibility. Accept only the most obvious cases as
qualifying for the statement of responsibility&rdquo; (CSB11). Here are a few examples:
</p>

<p>Description ■ 35</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Some sound recordings contain several works but lack a collective title.
AACR2R allows catalogers to describe the item as a unit or create separate records
for each titled work (6.1G). The Library of Congress instructs its catalogers to
describe the item as a unit (CSB 11) and not to apply the other option (CSB 47).
</p>
<p>In describing an item without a collective title, if all the works are by
the same person, the cataloger should transcribe the works in the order in which
they appear in the chief source and separate them with semicolons (6.1G and
1.1G3). For instance,
</p>
<p>Disc label: Ludwig van Beethoven
</p>
<p>Sonata No. 8 in C minor,
Op. 13 &ldquo;Pathetique&rdquo;
Sonata No. 23 in F minor,
Op. 57 &ldquo;Appassionata&rdquo;
Sonata No. 14 in C sharp minor,
Op. 27 No. 2 &ldquo;Moonlight&rdquo;
CLAUDIO ARRAU, piano
</p>
<p>Transcribed as:
</p>
<p>100 1 Beethoven, Ludwig van, $d 1770-1827.
</p>
<p>245 10 Sonata no. 8 in C minor, op. 13 $h [sound
recording]: $b pathetique; sonata no. 23 in F
minor, op. 57 : appasionata ; sonata no. 14 in C
sharp minor, op. 27 no. 2 : moonlight / $c
Ludwig van Beethoven.
</p>
<p>511 0 Claudio Arrau, piano.
</p>
<p>6. 2. Edition (MARC field 250)
</p>
<p>The edition statement of sound recordings should be recorded as in-
structed in 1.2B. Abbreviations and numerical notations in Appendices B and C
of AACR2R should be consulted.
</p>
<p>250 Remastered original sound track ed.
</p>
<p>6.3. This area does not apply to sound recordings.
</p>
<p>36 ■ Sound Recordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.4. Publication, Distribution, Etc. (MARC field 260)
</p>
<p>The prescribed sources for this area are, in the order of preference,
the chief source of information, accompanying textual material, and container.
Information taken from other sources must be placed in brackets. Because many
sound recordings lack the place of publication, the cataloger often needs to consult
reference sources for this information. The following titles are good starting points:
</p>
<p>Billboard International Buyer&rsquo;s Guide. New York: Billboard Publi-
cations, 1970-
</p>
<p>Musical America: International Directory of the Performing Arts.
Great Barrington, Mass.: ABC Leisure Magazines, 1974-
</p>
<p>Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll. New York : Rolling Stone
Press (current edition).
</p>
<p>The name of a larger jurisdiction may be added to identify the name
of a city if necessary. When the name of a larger jurisdiction appears with a place
name in the prescribed source, Library of Congress adds it to Area 4 even though
it may not be necessary for identification purpose.

</p>
<p>The name of the publisher is transcribed in the shortest form possible.
If the publisher&rsquo;s name on the item is different from that on the container, the
cataloger should prefer the information on the label. If a company&rsquo;s name and its
subdivision, trade name, or brand name appear in a sound recording, AACR2R
instructs the cataloger to record the name of the smaller unit. But if the trade
name seems to be a series title, it should be transcribed as such (6.4D3).

</p>
<p>The date of publication is recorded as instructed in 1.4F. Sound re-
cordings sometimes carry two copyright dates. &ldquo;c&rdquo; represents the copyright date
of textual data, while &ldquo;p&rdquo; represents the copyright date of the sound data. The
current preferred practice is to use &ldquo;p&rdquo; for the date of publication. If the recording
date is different from the publishing date, the cataloger records the publishing
date in the 260 field and the recording date in a note in field 518.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>260 New York, N.Y. : $b RCA Victor, $c p1988.
</p>
<p>518 Recorded in September, 1987 in London, England.
</p>
<p>6.5. Physical Description (MARC field 300)
</p>
<p>300 Number of special material designation (total
playing time) : $b other details ; $c dimension.
+ $e accompanying material.
</p>
<p>The prescribed source of this area is the entire work. AACR2R gives catalogers
several terms as specific material designations: sound cartridge, sound cassette,
sound disc, sound tape reel, and sound track film. Cassette and reel can be added
to &ldquo;sound track film&rdquo; and the name of an instrument can be added to roll (such as
&ldquo;piano rolls&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>The total playing time of a sound recording should be recorded
(6.5B2). If the playing time of each part is listed, the cataloger may add the parts
up and round the total to the nearest minute. If no playing time is readily avail-
able, do not record it.
</p>
<p>The second element of Area 5, other physical details, includes several
subelements (6.5C1): (1) type of recording (analog or digital), (2) playing speed,
(3) groove characteristics (of analog discs), (4) track configuration (of sound
track films), (5) number of tracks (on tapes), (6) number of sound channels, and
(7) recording and reproduction characteristics.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Type of recording&rdquo; refers to the way the sound is encoded and the
type of playback equipment needed. It is a critical element. &ldquo;Analog&rdquo; and &ldquo;digital&rdquo;
are the typical terms for this subelement.
</p>
<p>Playing speed, groove characteristics, and number of tracks are not
recorded if the information is standard for a particular medium. The number of
sound channels, however, is always transcribed if the information is readily
available. &ldquo;Mono,&rdquo; &ldquo;stereo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;quad&rdquo; are the three most common terms for
this subelement (6.5C7).
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress instructs its catalogers to record the record-
ing and reproduction characteristics whenever the information is necessary for
selecting playback equipment (CSB 8). &ldquo;Dolby processed&rdquo; is one of the most
common terms recorded for this subelement. Many CDs have notations such as
ADD or DDD that indicate the type of recording, the type of equipment used in
mixing and editing, and the type of equipment used in mastering the disc. Such
information is not recorded in the 300 field. As CDs become more prevalent,
some libraries are including the ADD type information in their record. Since
they are not allowed to enter this information in the 300 field, some libraries
have included it in the &ldquo;Compact disc&rdquo; note.
</p>
<p>38 ■ Sound Recordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The dimensions for rolls, cartridges, and cassettes are not recorded if
they are standard size. Discs are measured in inches, according to the standard
measurement of the recording industry. An analog disc is usually 12 inches,
while a CD is 4 3/4 inches. A note is provided when a sound disc is a CD.
</p>
<p>Details of accompanying material are added to the end of Area 5. The
location of the accompanying material, however, is typically recorded in the
note area.
</p>
<p>300 2 sound cassettes (60 min., 20 sec.) : $b analog,
stereo. + $e 1 booklet (20 p. : ill. (some col.) ; 8 cm.)
</p>
<p>300 1 sound disc (52 min.) : $b digital ; $c 4 3/4 in.
</p>
<p>500 Program notes on container.
</p>
<p>500 Compact disc (DDD).
</p>
<p>6.6. Series (MARC field 4xx)
</p>
<p>Details for this area can be taken from the chief source of informa-
tion, accompanying textual material, or container, in that order of preference.
Series title should be recorded as instructed in 1.1B1. Wording, spelling, and order
of the title should be followed, but not necessarily for punctuation or capitalization.
Field 440 is used to record series information if the series is traced, otherwise
field 490 is used. If a series is traced in a form different from the one on the item,
catalogers typically use field 490 to record the series title as it appears and field
830 to record the traced form.
</p>
<p>6.7. Notes
</p>
<p>Notes serve two purposes:
</p>
<p>1. They provide additional information about a work that cannot
be recorded elsewhere in the record.
</p>
<p>2. They justify the provision of additional access points.
</p>
<p>Notes are to be recorded in the order specified in 6.7B, but the order can be
changed if one note is considered more important than others. Notes on the nature
and scope of the sound recording as a whole are presented first. Other notes follow
the order of the eight areas of bibliographic description.
</p>
<p>Many types of notes are covered by 6.7B and several notes are com-
monly provided for sound recordings. They include variations in title, perform-
ers, time and/or place of recording, additional physical descriptions, location of
accompanying material, audience, other formats, summary, contents, and pub-
lisher&rsquo;s numbers.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Variant Title (MARC field 246): Titles different from the title proper
should be recorded in notes with added entries provided. Field 246 is used for
this purpose. The first indicator specifies if a note and an added entry should be
produced, and the second indicator specifies the type of variant title.
</p>
<p>245 10 Concertos for cello.
</p>
<p>246 18 Cello concertos [&ldquo;1&rdquo; &ldquo;8&rdquo; will create a title added
entry and a note: Spine title: Cello concertos.]

</p>
<p>246 1 $i Title on container: $a Piano sonatas [subfield i

variant title.]
</p>
<p>Performers (MARC field 511): Performers not named in the state-
ment of responsibility area are recorded in the note area if the information is con-
sidered necessary. AACR2R instructs catalogers to record the names of
performers, the role they play, or the medium they perform. This information is
entered in field 511 and the first indicator value is &ldquo;0&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>511 0 Seiji Ozawa, conductor; Boston Symphony Orchestra.
</p>
<p>History of Recording (MARC field 518): The date of recording is
usually noted in field 518.
</p>
<p>518 Recorded April 6 and 7, 1987, at St. Timothy Church,
Toronto.
</p>
<p>Physical Description (MARC field 500): AACR2R allows a note of
&ldquo;analog recording&rdquo; for a digital disc made from an analog original, and a note of
&ldquo;digital recording&rdquo; for an analog disc made from a digital original. Nowadays
many CDs bear three-letter codes such as ADD and DDD. Many libraries have
included this information with the &ldquo;compact disc&rdquo; note in the 500 field.
</p>
<p>Other Formats (MARC field 530): If a sound recording is known to
be available in other formats, the information is recorded in field 530. Catalogers
may consult the Schwann catalog to find this information, but should not do exten-
sive research to locate such information.
</p>
<p>Summary (MARC field 520): Summary notes are usually provided
for nonmusical recordings because it gives users a good idea of the item without
actually playing it. Summary notes are entered in field 520.
</p>
<p>Contents (MARC field 505): Contents of a sound recording are fre-
quently recorded for music recordings and some nonmusical recordings. By list-
ing the works of a recording, the cataloger offers users an understanding of the
collected work and enables them to select the item. If duration of each titled
work is available, the information should be included.
</p>
<p>40 ■ Sound Recordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Publisher&rsquo;s number (MARC field 028): Publisher&rsquo;s numbers for
sound recordings are useful identifiers. Although it is listed as the last type of
note, this information appears as the first note in printed catalog cards. Subfield b
is used for the name of the record company. The following 028 field with a second
indicator 2 will generate a note saying &ldquo;Publisher no.: RCA Victor 7774-2-RC.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>028 0 2 7774-2-RC $b RCA Victor
</p>
<p>6.8. Standard Number and Terms of Availability Area
(field 020 or 022)
</p>
<p>The cataloger should record international standard numbers such as
International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or International Standard Serial
Number (ISSN) in field 020 or 022, if the information is readily available. Other
numbers should be recorded in the note area.
</p>
<p>Enhanced CDs
</p>
<p>Many musicians have combined video or multimedia in their record-
ings to present background information about their songs, concerts, and personal
interests. A fairly standard practice is to create an &ldquo;Enhanced CD,&rdquo; which is a
regular audio CD with a multimedia CD-ROM track. To play an Enhanced CD,
one needs an audio CD player for the audio portion of the disc and a computer for
the multimedia CD-ROM track. Because an Enhanced CD involves the use of a
computer, the treatment of this type of material is covered in Chapter Five.
</p>
<p>Assignment of Access Points
</p>
<p>Three chapters of AACR2R provide guidelines for assigning access
points to sound recordings. Chapter 21 of AACR2R presents rules on how to select
access points, and Rule 21.23 is devoted to sound recordings. Chapter 22 covers
the construction of proper headings, and Chapter 25 focuses on formulating uni-
formed titles, which are commonly assigned to musical works.
</p>
<p>21.23A. The Work of One Person
</p>
<p>The principles of authorship specified in Chapter 21 apply to sound
recordings. 21.23A states that the sound recording of a work by a single person
(composer, writer, artist) should be entered under that person. Performers, readers,
or narrators are assigned as additional access points.

<p>21.23B. Two or More Works by the Same Person(s)
or Body (bodies)
</p>
<p>Two or more works by the same person will be entered under the
name of the person. Recordings of music may need uniform titles to bring vari-
ous renditions of the work together. Chapter 25 focuses on uniform title and the
cataloger should search OCLC Authority File to ensure proper form is used.
Added entries are usually provided for principal performers.

<p>21.23C. Collections with Collective Title
</p>
<p>A sound recording containing the works by two or more people is en-
tered under the principal performer. LCRI 21.23C (CBS 45) clarifies that &ldquo;per-
former&rdquo; refers to a person or corporate body whose performance is on the sound
recording. It also states that a conductor is not a member of the group he or she
conducts, and a member of a performing group should not be considered a separate
performer.

</p>
<p>21.23D. Collections Without Collective Title
</p>
<p>If a sound recording contains the works by two or more people and
lacks a collective title, the main access point depends on the participation of the
performers. If the performer goes beyond performance, execution, and interpre-
tation, the item should be entered under the heading of the principal performer.
Rock, jazz, and popular music recordings tend to belong to this category.
</p>
<p>But if the performer&rsquo;s participation is limited to performance, execu-
tion, and interpretation, the item should be entered under the heading appropriate
to the first work. Added entries are made for other works and performers.
</p>
<p>21.29D. Added Entries
</p>
<p>LCRI 21.29D (CBS 45) provides guidelines for the selection of
added entries for sound recordings. It recommends that catalogers make added
entries for all named performers, with six exceptions:
</p>
<p>1. If a corporate body is selected as an access point, no added entries
should be provided for individual members of the group. A
conductor and accompanist should not be considered members
of the body he or she conducts or accompanies. So it is accept-
able to select conductors and accompanists as added entries. If
a person&rsquo;s name appears with a corporate body, the cataloger
needs to determine if the corporate name includes this person&rsquo;s
name. If so, no added entry should be assigned. Otherwise, this
person can be selected as an added entry.
</p>
<p>2. If the chorus and the orchestra of an opera company perform in
an opera and are named along with the name of the parent body,
only the parent body should be selected as the added entry.
</p>
<p>Description ■ 43</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3. No added entry should be made for a performer whose role is
minor or a performer who is chosen as the main entry.
</p>
<p>4. If many performers perform the same function (e.g., actors in a
drama), only those given prominence in the chief source are
selected as added entries.
</p>
<p>5. If number four does not apply, performers given prominence in
other parts of the work should be selected.
</p>
<p>6. If number five also does not apply, performers given the most
important functions (the principal roles) should be selected as
added entries.
</p>
<p>■ SUBJECT ANALYSIS
Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>In assigning subject headings, Library of Congress treats all works
on the same subject in the same way regardless of their medium. Catalogers
therefore analyze sound recordings in the same way they analyze print materials
and assign headings&mdash;according to the general guidelines provided by LC Sub-
ject Cataloging Manual (H 180). Because nonprint materials are much harder to
browse and users tend to rely on the catalog for subject information about them,
catalogers tend to assign more subject headings to them. But no special form
subdivision is assigned to bring out the format.
</p>
<p>Juvenile Sound Recordings
</p>
<p>The only exception is juvenile materials, which include materials in-
tended for children and young adults from preschool through 16. For materials
with the intellectual level code a, b, or c in &ldquo;Audn&rdquo; in the fixed field, subdivision
&ldquo;--Juvenile sound recordings&rdquo; is added to the topical headings. For instance, a
sound cassette on nutrition for teenagers will be assigned a heading: Nutrition--
Juvenile sound recordings. If a work is coded f (for special audiences) and is
clearly juvenile in nature, this subdivision can be assigned also. This subdivision
can be used for fictional or factual treatment of a topic.
</p>
<p>Sound recordings cover all types of topics, and music and literature
are two of the more popular subject areas. So the subject cataloging practices for
works of literature and works of music are briefly introduced here. The follow-
ing discussion is based on the Subject Cataloging Manual and Chan&rsquo;s descrip-
tion of these topics.4
</p>
<p>44 ■ Sound Recordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Music5
</p>
<p>Many valid music headings are not listed in Library of Congress
Subject Headings because the Library of Congress has issued standard citation
patterns for catalogers to establish music headings appropriate for the item being
cataloged. Catalogers should consult H1160 of the Subject Cataloging Manual
for the citation patterns. Library of Congress also designates the phrase heading
[Medium or form for instrumental music], Arranged as free-floating to cover
a wide range of music (e.g., Piano music, Arranged). Free-floating subdivisions
can be found under Operas (the pattern for music composition, including musical
form, medium, style, music for special occasions, and others) and Piano (the
pattern for musical instruments). (See H1161.) H1160 includes free-floating pe-
riod subdivisions for headings for music compositions and explains the assign-
ment of these subdivisions.
</p>
<p>The practice of the Library of Congress is to treat musical sound record-
ings in the same way as other musical works. For instrumental music, headings are
usually assigned for musical form (e.g., Sonatas; Suites), medium of performance
(e.g., Flute music; Piano music), and performing group (e.g., Orchestra music;
Quintets). For vocal music, headings are assigned for form (e.g., Chants; Operas),
voice range (e.g., High voice; Men&rsquo;s voices), number of vocal parts (e.g., 4
parts), and accompanying medium (e.g., Piano). If topical headings are appropriate,
they can be assigned with music subdivisions. Keats, John, 1795-1821--Musical
settings, for instance, is assigned to a work in which the writings of Keats have
been set to music.
</p>
<p>If a sound recording includes works in different musical forms, a
heading is assigned to represent the form of each work. A recording of Vivaldi&rsquo;s
concertos for cello that includes two forms of concertos will be assigned a head-
ing for each form: Concertos (Violoncello with string orchestra) and Concertos
(Bassoon, violoncello with string orchestra).
</p>
<p>A musical work for a specific dance form is assigned a heading for
the dance form (e.g., Tangos) and headings for the medium and other appropriate
topics. SCM H1917 details the treatment of music of ethnic groups, national groups,
and non-Western art music.
</p>
<p>Literature6
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings lists four types of headings
for works of and about literature, including literary form headings (e.g., Poetry),
topical headings for themes, characters, or features in literary works (e.g., Peace--
Fiction), headings with form and topic combined (e.g, Mystery and detective stories),
and other topical headings. Sound recordings of literature tend to include collec-
tions of literary works or individual literary works. For collections of two or more
independent works by different authors, literary form headings are assigned. If a
collection has a theme, a topical heading with a form subdivision is also assigned.
</p>
<p>Subject Analysis ■ 45</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For instance, American poetry--19th century; and Love--Poetry are assigned to a
collection of several 19th century American poets&rsquo; works. Although subdivision
&ldquo;--Collected works&rdquo; is free-floating, it cannot be used with literary form head-
ings. Subdivision &ldquo;--Collections&rdquo; is not free-floating and can be used with very
few literary form headings, including Drama, Fiction, Literature, and Poetry.
</p>
<p>For collected works by an individual literary author, the practice is to
assign no literary form heading unless the literary form headings combine
form and topic (e.g., War poetry) or the form heading is highly specific (e.g.,
Radio stories). Topical headings with a literary form subdivision, if appropriate,
are assigned.
</p>
<p>For individual works of poetry or drama by an individual literary
author, the practice is to assign no major literary forms (e.g., English poetry), but
form headings that include a topic (e.g., War poetry) or highly specific form
headings (e.g., Nursery rhymes) can be assigned. Appropriate topical headings with
subdivisions &ldquo;--Poetry&rdquo; or &ldquo;--Drama&rdquo; can be assigned if appropriate. Children&rsquo;s
poems or plays are assigned literary form headings for children&rsquo;s literature (e.g.,
Children&rsquo;s plays).
</p>
<p>For individual works of adult fiction, children&rsquo;s fiction, or young
adult fiction, no form headings are assigned. Topical headings with subdivision
&ldquo;--Fiction&rdquo; are assigned to only three types of fiction: biographical fiction (e.g.,
Joyce, James, 1882-1941--Fiction), historical fiction (e.g., Holocaust--Fiction),
and animal stories (e.g., Animals--Fiction; Pigs--Fiction).
</p>
<p>The August 1998 version of SCM H1790 indicates that Library of
Congress has begun a cooperative program with OCLC to provide increased
subject access to fiction as recommended by ALA&rsquo;s Guidelines on Subject Access
to Individual Works of Fiction, Drama, Etc.7 Under this program OCLC adds
headings for topic, setting, characters and genre to update LC records. Genre and
form headings taken from the Guidelines are coded gsafd in subfield $2.
</p>
<p>Both Library of Congress Classification and Dewey Decimal Classi-
fication classify topical sound recordings for adults and those for juveniles in the
same manner as other topical materials. The most specific class number should
be assigned, and Cutter numbers are used to subarrange materials. In LCC juvenile
materials are classed with a number for &ldquo;Juvenile works&rdquo; under the appropriate
heading, if it is available. Otherwise, the number for &ldquo;General works&rdquo; is used.
DDC&rsquo;s Table 1 has a provision for intended audience but the audience aspect is
usually not represented by the class number.
</p>
<p>LCC places juvenile belles lettres in PZ5-90 and juvenile fiction,
folklore, etc. in English are placed in PZ5-PZ10.3, with unique Cutter numbers
assigned to authors. If necessary, work letters from the title are used to subar-
range works by the same author (e.g., the work letters for Freddy the Detective
are &ldquo;Fr&rdquo;). The work letters include a capital letter and one or more lowercase let-
ters. The same class number is assigned to editions of the same work, and the
publication date is used to distinguish the editions. Work letters are not used if a
work has a title main entry and if a work is not written in English. Except for col-
lections of juvenile literature that are classed in 808.899282, DDC does not have
</p>
<p>46 ■ Sound Recordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>specific numbers for juvenile belles lettres. Cutter numbers from the Cutter tables
and work marks from the title are often used to subarrange materials assigned the
same DDC number.
</p>
<p>■ARRANGEMENT
Arrangement
</p>
<p>While subject headings provide collocation on the catalog, call num-
bers provide a reasonable extent of collocation on the shelves. The assignment of
classification number, however, is not directly related to how sound recordings
are shelved. If a library is committed to an integrated catalog, sound recordings
should be shelved with other types of material. But intershelving works of differ-
ent media is challenging. Weihs offers detailed instructions on intershelving, but
she also acknowledges the cost of such an effort.8 Preservation and security con-
cerns also make intershelving all media less appealing. For these reasons libraries
have developed many ways to organize sound recordings.9 Major factors the
organizer must consider are ease of browsing, ease of access, security, preservation,
and equipment. Four methods and their strengths and limitations are described
below.
</p>
<p>Intershelving with Dummies
</p>
<p>Because sound recordings come in several formats and publishers do
not have standards for packaging these works, intershelving sound recordings
can be difficult. One solution is to create dummies for the recordings and place
them on the shelves with the rest of the collection. When a user finds the dummy,
he or she can bring it to the librarian to exchange for the recording. This approach
has several benefits. It collocates works on the same subject on the shelves for
easy browsing. It uses only one shelving system and should cause little confusion
for users. The sound recordings are less likely to be damaged because they are
kept in a place only librarians can access. If special equipment is needed to play a
recording, the librarian will be able to point that out to the user or provide the
equipment if the library has it. As with any system, intershelving has some draw-
backs. One is that the user will not have the opportunity to examine the physical
item before asking for it. Another drawback is that the user will not be able to
browse the entire sound recording collection. A more serious drawback is that
when access to items is mediated through a librarian, full access to items may be
discouraged, especially items of more controversial topics.
</p>
<p>Arrangement ■ 47</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Case Display for Browsing
</p>
<p>To encourage browsing, some public libraries have tried displaying
cassette and CD cases without their contents. When a user desires an item, he or
she will give the librarian the number on the case. This method of organization is not
strongly tied to the catalog, supports browsing, and allows users to examine the cases.
It also has advantages for security and preservation reasons. But the library will
need to have more storage space for sound recordings&mdash;an area for the case display
and an area for storing the physical items. Another challenge is that the arrange-
ment of the cases must be logical to facilitate browsing. Because sound recordings
can be arranged by title, author, composer, principal performer, type of music,
etc., it is not a simple task to arrange these materials or to maintain the order of
cases in the display area. Some libraries have resorted to placing cases in a
locked display case to maintain the order of the cases. That method, however,
limits the user&rsquo;s access to the cases.
</p>
<p>Shelving by Format
</p>
<p>Another popular approach is to shelve sound recordings by the medium,
with sound cassettes in one area and CDs in another. Within each category the
items are subarranged according to the nature or type. For example, music CDs
are stored together and color-coded by music type (red for rock music, green for
jazz, and so on); musical cassettes are similarly treated and stored in a separate
area; while nonmusical cassettes are subarranged by type with &ldquo;B&rdquo; designating
biography and subdivided by Cutter number, and other codes for different categories.
This arrangement is very good for browsing and encourages direct access. The
limitations are that the items tend to be touched by many users, the subgroupings
within the same medium may not be very explicit, and users interested in various
presentations of the same subject will have to check several media areas. Security
and preservation of the items will present difficulties as well.
</p>
<p>Shelving by Size
</p>
<p>Although this may sound impractical, shelving by size has been used
in closed stacks with success. Works are shelved according to their size and assigned
an accession number. The benefits of this arrangement include space saving,
easy shelf maintenance, and quick retrieval once the access number is found in
the catalog. The drawback is the collection becomes unusable without the catalog.
Subject collocation on the shelves and browsing are impossible, and no users can
access the stacks. This approach favors the security and preservation of sound
recordings at the expense of direct user access.

<p>Each of these methods has its strengths and limitations. In devising
ways to organize sound recordings for access, the organizer will need to consider
the needs of the intended users first. Is browsing important to these users? Is it
likely they will want to examine the physical items? Are they likely to search the
catalog first? How good is the online catalog? Does the library expect heavy use
of sound recordings? Can the library afford to replace damaged items frequently?
Answers to these questions should guide the decision on how to organize sound
recordings for access.

<p>Discussion for Figure 3.1
</p>
<p>&bull; Type: Code i is used for a non-musical sound recording.
</p>
<p>&bull; 007: Subfields common to sound cassettes are included. Code s in
$e indicates stereo, code c in $i refers to 4-track which is standard,
code c in $m is for Dolby processed material, and code e in $n in-
dicates the analog format of the sound.
</p>
<p>&bull; 020: The ISBN is on the container.
</p>
<p>&bull; 028: Publisher&rsquo;s number is entered in subfield a, subfield b is for the
label name. The second indicator 2 will produce a note for this number.
</p>
<p>&bull; 100: The work of a single author is entered under the author.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: Although &ldquo;Simon &amp; Schuster&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sound Ideas&rdquo; do not ap-
pear right next to each other on the cassette label, their relationship
is made clear on the label. The phrase &ldquo;Simon &amp; Schuster Sound
Ideas&rdquo; appears with the publisher&rsquo;s number on the container. &ldquo;Si-
mon &amp; Schuster Sound Ideas&rdquo; is therefore used as the name of the
publisher. The copyright date of the sound recording (p1992) is
transcribed in subfield c.
</p>
<p>&bull; 300: The approximate running time, sound channel information,
and the recording characteristics are on the container. Because the
dimension of the cassettes is standard, subfield c is not used.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: This text appears prominently on the container. Because the
quotation is not from the chief source, its source is indicated.
</p>
<p>&bull; 511: Even though the narrator is the same as the author, this note is
necessary to identify the narrator. Since the author is the main en-
try, no added entry needs to be created for her.
</p>
<p>&bull; 520: Summary note is usually provided for nonmusical recordings
to inform users of the content of the work.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650: A topical heading for the subject content of this work. No
special form subdivision is assigned to bring out the format.

<p>&bull; Chief source of information: Both sides of the disc constitute the
chief source.
</p>
<p>&bull; Type: Code j is used for a musical recording.
</p>
<p>&bull; 007: Subfields common to sound discs are included. Code s in $e
refers to stereo sound, code e in $g indicates the dimension of the
disc (12 inches), and code e in $n identifies the analog format of
the sound.

</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The copyright date for the music and the copyright date for
the recording are both present, but only the one for the sound re-

</p>
<p>&bull; 505: The duration of each piece is listed on the labels, so the dura-
tions are recorded in the contents note. Only the first words of the
titles are capitalized.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650: For instrumental music, the LC practice is to assign headings
for the musical form, medium of performance, and/or performing
group. Guitar music specifies the medium of performance for this

<p>Videorecordings
</p>
<p>Like the treatment of print resources, the cataloging of videos involves taking
data from the chief and prescribed sources for the description of eight areas, assign-
ing access points, and the analysis of subject contents. There are several major
challenges in cataloging videos:
</p>
<p>1. Video producers do not present information in a standard for-
mat, which makes it hard for catalogers to determine where the
title frames begin and end. This lack of a standard frequently
means that catalogers must check beginning frames and end
frames to make sure appropriate information is included.
</p>
<p>2. Many people are often involved in the creation of a video. The
authorship is so diffuse that it can be difficult to select access points.
</p>
<p>3. Containers of videos generally present a great deal of informa-
tion. Some of this information is different from the information
on the video, which makes it necessary for catalogers to deter-
mine what to record and how to accommodate the differences.
</p>
<p>4. Some videos are now presented on videodiscs or DVD and re-
quire special equipment.
</p>
<p>5. Production information is usually provided, and catalogers of-
ten have to make a judgment call as to what types of notes to
provide for this type of information. The subject analysis of
videos also requires a slight variation in how subject headings
are assigned, which makes it difficult for catalogers not familiar
with the use of format headings.
</p>
<p>These challenges can be addressed through a careful examination of
the video and its container. Videorecordings tend to contain plenty of informa-
tion. To assist readers in finding information useful for cataloging purposes, the
next section describes areas with pertinent information.
</p>
<p>■TECHNICAL READING
OF VIDEORECORDINGS
</p>
<p>Technical Reading of Videorecordings
</p>
<p>71
</p>
<p>FOUR � VIDEORECORDINGS</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1. Title frames and end credits frames: These areas usually pro-
vide information on the people involved in the creation of the
videorecording, including production firm, title proper, pro-
ducers, directors, lead actors, supporting actors and technical
staff. Catalogers should keep in mind that only people with
&ldquo;overall responsibility&rdquo; for the work should be included in the
statement of responsibility area (field 245, $c). These people
will also be assigned as access points. In addition, lead actors
will be recorded in field 511, while important technical staff
will be recorded in field 508. These names are usually used as
added entry headings.
</p>
<p>2. Container label: This area often presents information on title,
production firm, distributor, catalog number, series informa-
tion, playing time, rating, sound, and copyright information.
The information on the label can be useful for fields 245, 028,
260, and 300.
</p>
<p>3. Box or case of the videorecording: Because the box or case is not
the preferred chief source of information, the information pre-
sented on the box or case should be verified in the chief source.
This area, however, usually captures important information on
the item and can be used to speed up the cataloging process. For
example, in film videos, the lower part of the back of a
box/case usually presents information that is almost identical
to that presented on the title and credit frames. Producer, dis-
tributor, rating, sound, captioning, and playing time are usually
included in this area also. In the front of the box/case, lead actors
are usually listed. The spine of the box has publisher information
and stock number. This information is typically recorded in
field 028.
</p>
<p>While the information in this area cannot be tran-
scribed without verification, it does provide catalogers a short
list of very important data. After these data are verified in the
prescribed sources, they should be transcribed.
</p>
<p>4. DVD main menu: The latest medium, DVD, has a main menu
that provides several choices. The &ldquo;CAST&rdquo; entry can be used to
verify people responsible for the work. Lead characters, direc-
tor, screenplay writers, and other key people are usually listed
here.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Language&rdquo; entry will show the languages in
which the video is dubbed. This information should be tran-
scribed in a 546 note. The &ldquo;subtitles&rdquo; entry will show in which
languages the caption can appear. The main menu also lists
</p>
<p>72 ■ Videorecordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>additional materials on the disk, such as documentary or direc-
tor&rsquo;s commentary.
</p>
<p>Similar to the box/case of a film video, the back of a
DVD box often has the information presented on the DVD&rsquo;s
main menu. This can speed up the process of cataloging. This
area tends to include information on rating, color, playing time,
sound characteristics, and closed-captioning.
</p>
<p>■MARC FIELDS FOR VIDEORECORDINGS
MARC Fields for Videorecordings
</p>
<p>The MARC fields commonly used to encode videorecordings are
listed below. Field 007 is required for all types of videorecordings, and 028 is
used to present a publisher&rsquo;s number.
</p>
<p>MARC fields often used to encode videorecordings are:
</p>
<p>028 42 number $b production firm
</p>
<p>245 _ _ Title $h [videorecording] / $c statement of people
responsible for the overall production of the video.

<p>Chief Source of Information
</p>
<p>AACR2R stipulates the chief source of information for videos should
be the title and credit frames, or the labels on the container (cassette, disc, etc.) if
the container is an integral part of the item. If the desired information cannot be
found in these sources, other sources can be used, including accompanying
material, container (case), and other sources. In such instances a source note
should be provided.

</p>
<p>246 30 First episode
</p>
<p>500 Title from cassette label.
</p>
<p>Since the information on the cassette label is more complete, it is transcribed for
the title field. When the title proper is not taken from the preferred chief source
(i.e., title frame), a note is provided to clarify this point.
</p>
<p>Prescribed Sources of Information
</p>
<p>The prescribed sources of information for each of the seven areas of
the description of videorecordings are summarized below:
</p>
<p>245 (Area 1) Chief source of information
</p>
<p>250, 260, 4xx (Areas 2, 4, 6) Chief source, accompanying
material, container
</p>
<p>300, 5xx, 02X (Areas 5, 7, 8) Any source
</p>
<p>Information taken from non-prescribed sources should be recorded in square
brackets.
</p>
<p>7.1. Title and Statement of Responsibility
(MARC field 245)
</p>
<p>A common problem in transcribing title proper is that the title frames
are usually preceded or followed by the names of performers, producers, and so
on. In such cases, LCRI 7.1B1 (CSB 13) recommends that these names not be
considered part of the title proper.

<p>Statement of Responsibility: Many people are involved in the creation of
a video or a film. LCRI 7.1F1 (CSB 36) indicates that only person(s) or body(ies)
with overall responsibility for the work should be entered in the statement of re-
sponsibility area. People in this category typically include producers, directors,
and writers. People responsible for part of the work are covered by notes. In the
Silence of the Lamb example, actors with major roles are recorded in a note, while
the screenplay writer, the producers, and the director are entered in Area 1.

<p>When many individuals are listed in the credit area, it can be difficult
to determine who has the overall responsibility and should be recorded in Area 1.
It can also be challenging to determine which actors play &ldquo;major roles&rdquo; in a
video. Fortunately the label or the container often provides some clues on this
matter. Especially for actors, the container tends to list only the major characters,
suggesting that these individuals should become access points.

<p>7.4 Publication, Distribution, Etc.
(MARC field 260)
</p>
<p>The prescribed sources for this area are the chief source, the accom-
panying material and the container. The name of the publisher and that of the dis-
tributor, if known, are recorded in this area. If several dates appear on an item or
different dates are listed for different parts of an item, catalogers should use a
date that covers the entire work if possible. If this is not possible, the latest date is
used. If distributor information is available, the name and place of the distributor,
releasing agency, etc. can be recorded in this area also (1.4D, 7.4D). Subfields a
and b can be repeated for this area.

PBS Video [distributor], $c c1989.
</p>
<p>For videos of feature films, the publication date of the video is re-
corded in subfield c of field 260, while the date of the original film is recorded in
the edition and history note (7.7B7).
</p>
<p>7.5 Physical Description (MARC field 300)

</p>
<p>In addition to videocassettes and videorecordings, other videomediums include
videodisc and DVD. Videodisc has two distinct formats, CAV (constant angular
velocity) and CLV (constant linear velocity). CAV is the preferred format for in-
teractive videodisc applications because the frames are laid down in concentric
circles and each frame has its own 360-degree track on the videodisc, making it
possible for laser readers to randomly access the frames.3 Information on CLV is
laid down in one continuous spiral, making the format appropriate for long, con-
tinuous video plays.4 DVD stands for digital videodisc. It expands the optical
storage capacity of CD-ROM into the multi-gigabyte range to support applica-
tions such as digital video. The DVD Forum identifies three levels of DVD stor-
age capacity: a 4.7 GB standard for single-layer DVD, an 8.5 GB standard for
dual-layer, and a 17 GB standard for floppy disks designed to record on both
sides of a dual-layer system.5 Major film studios have released feature films on
</p>

<p>DVD. Encyclopedias and games with video and surround sound are also popular
applications of DVD. DVDs require their own player. The attraction of such a
player is that it can read both CD-ROM titles and audio CDs.
</p>
<p>Data for this area can be taken from any source. The information usu-
ally appears on the label or the container. For videodiscs (CAV and CLV) and
DVD, the specific material designation is &ldquo;videodisc.&rdquo; Information about the
type of player, special sound effects, and so on are usually recorded in field 538 as
system requirements. The &ldquo;sound&rdquo; element indicates whether a video has sound,
but it does not indicate the quality of the sound, such as &ldquo;stereo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dolby sur-
round,&rdquo; which is typically recorded in a note.

<p>538 CAV, standard play; THX digital sound, Dolby

</p>
<p>7.6 Series (MARC field 4xx)
</p>
<p>The prescribed sources for this area are the chief source, the accom-
panying material, and the container. This information usually appears prominently
on the container or the first few frames of a video.
</p>
<p>440 0 Eyewitness video series
</p>
<p>440 0 Storyteller&rsquo;s classics
</p>
<p>440 0 Yoga with Linda Arkin
</p>
<p>440 0 At time of diagnosis
</p>
<p>When an item belongs to a series, it is typically cataloged for itself, with an
added entry created for the series. This practice is sometimes applied to
multiple-part items, and should be done according to the library&rsquo;s policy.
</p>
<p>Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, for instance, includes six
parts, each with its own title. Catalogers have at least two ways to treat these
items. Option one is to catalog these six items as a set under the collective title,
provide a content note listing the six parts, and provide analytical added entries
for the six titles. This practice is common for parts with a collective title.
</p>
<p>80 ■ Videorecordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A second way to catalog this item for libraries that do not own all
parts of a work, is to catalog each item and use the collective title as a series title
to link the parts owned by the library together. While both approaches are accept-
able, a rule of thumb is to see if the second approach would result in six records
with nearly identical information. If so, Option One should be applied.
</p>

<p>7.7 Notes
</p>
<p>Fields 546, 500, 508, 511, 538, 520, 505, and 521 are frequently used
in the cataloging of videorecordings. Information for Area 7 can be taken from
any source. The rules of 7.7 specify the order of these notes.
</p>
<p>Language (MARC field 546): Languages can be associated with
videorecordings in many ways. Subtitling and closed captioning are common.
Some videos include signing or audio description on a second audio track of the
video. Such information is usually listed on the container and/or on the main
menu. Such information should be recorded in 546 field and coordinated with
the fixed-field element &ldquo;Lang&rdquo; and field 041.
</p>
<p>Example: For a bilingual program presented in Italian and English
</p>
<p>Transcribed as: Lang: ita

</p>
<p>Source of Title Proper (MARC field 500): If the title proper is not
taken from the chief source of information, a 500 note should be provided to indi-
cate the source.
</p>
<p>Variant Title (MARC field 246): Titles other than the title proper are
recorded in field 246, and the first indicator can be coded to produce a note and a
title added entry.

<p>Statement of Responsibility (MARC field 511, 508): Two major
notes for statement of responsibility include field 511, which records players,
performers, narrators, hosts or presenters of a videorecording, and field 508,
which records people who contribute to the artistic or technical production of a
videorecording. People named in field 511 should play major roles in a video,
and those listed in field 508 should have major contribution to the production of
the video. The wording and the order in which names appear in the credit frames
suggest the importance of these names. Information on the carrier (cassette or
videodisc) and the container may be helpful, too.

<p>Edition and History (MARC field 500): This type of note describes
the edition being cataloged or the history of a videorecording. Many videos or
feature films contain information on the original movie release.
</p>
<p>500 Originally produced for PBS television in 1986.
</p>

to indicate the location of accompanying material. It is also used to described
accompanying material that is not described elsewhere in the record.

</p>
<p>Audience (MARC field 521): If the intended audience or the intellec-
tual level of a videorecording is found in the item, its container, or accompany-
ing material, a 521 note should be provided. Rating information is also recorded
in 521. If the first indicator is blank, a print constant &ldquo;Audience&rdquo; will be displayed;
if it is 8, no print constant will be displayed.

<p>Other Formats (MARC field 530): If the item also appears in other
physical formats, the information is presented in a 530 note.
</p>
<p>530 Also available on videodisc.
</p>
<p>Summary (MARC field 520): To inform users of the content of an
item, catalogers should prepare a brief, objective summary. The Subject Cata-
loging Manual instructs catalogers to use summaries to determine which topics
will be assigned subject headings, so it is important to prepare an informative
and unbiased summary for each item cataloged.
</p>
<p>Contents (MARC field 505): The parts included in a videorecording
can be presented in a formal note in field 505 or an informal note in field 500. If
each part has its own statement of responsibility, the statement can be added. To
make the parts searchable, an enhanced contents note can be created, with the
second indicator coded &ldquo;0.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>Assignment of Access Points
</p>
<p>The assignment of access points to videorecordings is the same as
that to print materials, except for musical videorecordings. Videorecordings usu-
ally do not have a personal author as the main entry because they tend to include the
intellectual and artistic work of many people. In addition, videorecordings also
tend not to have a corporate body as the main entry because a work will have to
be emanated from the body and belong to one of the six categories of material
named in Rule 21.1B2. Most videorecordings have title as the main entry.
</p>
<p>LCRI 21.23C (CSB 45) recommends that Rules 21.23C1 and 21.23D
be applied to videorecordings that are &ldquo;collections of music performed by a prin-
cipal performer.&rdquo; Sarah Brightman in Concert, for instance, contains performances
by Brightman of a selection of songs. Applying Rule 21.23C1 to this video, the
cataloger will select Sarah Brightman as the main entry. Rule 21.23D covers videos
containing works by several people without collective title.
</p>
<p>LCRI 21.29 (CBS 45) also provides guidance on the selection of
added entries for videorecordings. These guidelines are similar to those for
sound recordings and are summarized below:
</p>
<p>1. Catalogers should make added entries for all openly named
persons or corporate bodies that contributed to the creation of
the work.
a. But if a production company, unit, etc., has been made an
</p>
<p>added entry, no entries should be made for persons such as
producers, directors, and writers unless their contributions
are significant. If no production company is present,
added entries should be made for producers, directors, and
writers. Added entries are made for other persons only if
they made significant contribution to the work.
</p>
<p>b. If a person is the main entry heading, make no added entries
for other people unless they are true collaborators.
</p>
<p>86 ■ Videorecordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. All corporate bodies named in the publication, distribution,
etc., area should be traced.
</p>
<p>3. All featured players, performers, and narrators should be
traced, but not group members. If a person&rsquo;s name appears with
a group, do not consider him a member of the group. If several
players are involved, make added entries for those given
prominence in the chief source. If this criterion does not apply,
make added entries for each if there are no more than three.
</p>
<p>4. Make added entries for persons serving as interviewers, inter-
viewees, lecturers, etc., who are not selected as the main entry.
</p>
<p>■ SUBJECT ANALYSIS
Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings
</p>
<p>Catalogers have been concerned about the limitations of authority
lists such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings and the Sears List of Sub-
ject Headings for the subject analysis of nonprint materials. Weihs pointed out
in 1987 that LCSH did not incorporate new topics fast enough and the terms
were not specific enough for the indexing of nonprint materials.6 Intner stated in
1992 that precision and retrieval remained problematic because many LCSH
terms could be used as topical headings and form headings.7 Furthermore, LC&rsquo;s
principle of literary warrant, a principle to use LC collection as the basis for estab-
lishing headings, also precluded LC from adding new terms for works it did not own.8
</p>
<p>The National Moving Image Database Standards Committee of the National
Center for Film and Video Preservation at the American Film Institute published
Moving Image Materials: Genre Terms (MIM) in 1988;9 and Miller described
the use of MIM and LCSH in their catalog to illustrate the compatibility con-
cerns.10 As Intner pointed out, LCSH has remained the main source for subject
headings because of a strong interest in integrating nonprint resources into the
catalog, the benefit of record sharing, LC&rsquo;s effort to revise and augment the tool,
and the high cost of developing and maintaining a new list.11 Intner and Studwell
extracted descriptors pertaining to motion pictures, television, and videorecord-
ings from the 13th edition of LCSH (1990) and made it easier for catalogers to
use the terms and to decide if new terms ought to be developed locally.12
</p>
<p>The cataloging policy has also been a matter of concern. ALA published
Guidelines on Subject Access to Individual Works of Fiction, Drama, Etc. in 1990.13
</p>
<p>The ALA Guidelines recommend four types of subject access that are valuable
for searchers, including form/genre access, access for characters or group of
characters, access for setting, and topical access. The current Library of Con-
gress policies for visual materials have similar treatments for motion pictures
that can be extended to videorecordings. These policies are summarized below.

<p>Fiction Films (SCM H2230)
</p>
<p>Videos that are feature films are assigned:
</p>
<p>1. topical headings with the subdivision &ldquo;--Drama&rdquo; (use the sub-
division &ldquo;--Juvenile films&rdquo; for juvenile fiction films),
</p>
<p>2. form headings indicating genre (e.g., Western films) or tech-
nique (e.g., Silent films), and
</p>
<p>3. either the form heading &ldquo;Feature films&rdquo; (for films at least 40
minutes long) or &ldquo;Short films&rdquo; (for films less than 40 minutes
long).
</p>
<p>The first two types of headings are assigned if appropriate, while the third head-
ing is required. If all three types of headings are assigned to a work, the headings
should be arranged in the order presented above.

<p>Films prepared with captions or sign language for viewing by the
hearing impaired should also be assigned the heading, &ldquo;Films for the hearing
impaired&rdquo; or &ldquo;Videorecordings for the hearing impaired.&rdquo; But films with subtitles
in other languages should not be assigned such headings if the subtitles are
meant as translation and not as an aid for the hearing impaired.
</p>
<p>Films prepared with audio description for the visually handicapped

</p>
<p>Classification Numbers
</p>
<p>In assigning numbers from DDC and LCC, the cataloger should focus
on the content of the videorecordings instead of the format. Topical videorecord-
ings should be assigned the most specific number available in the classification
schedule for the topics and no special number is assigned to bring out the format.
Videorecordings of feature films and literary works intended for entertainment
are classed with PN1997 A2-Z8 in LCC, and subarranged by Cutter number
from title. Special topics for motion pictures are classed under 1995.9 A-Z, with
.C55 for comedy, .F36 for fantastic films, and .S26 for science fiction films.
Videorecordings of juvenile belles lettres are classed in PZ5-PZ90, and those
written in English are classed in PZ5-PZ10.3. PZ7 is for American and English
juvenile belles lettres, 1870-, PZ8 for fairy tales, PZ8.1 for folklore, PZ8.3 for
verses for children and stories in rhyme, and PZ 10.3 for animal stories.
PZ5-PZ10.3 includes unique Cutter numbers assigned to literary authors to
subarrange materials. Work letters from the title (ignoring the initial article) can
be added to subarrange works by the same author.14 Date can also be added to dis-
tinguish editions of the same work.
</p>
<p>90 ■ Videorecordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In DDC topical videorecordings are also assigned the most specific
number available in the schedule. Table 1 of DDC, the standard subdivision,
supports catalogers to add numbers to represent some forms (e.g., dictionaries,
directories), but in general the form aspect of a work is usually ignored when one
assigns a classification number.15 For videorecordings of feature films, DDC has a
number (791.4372) for single films, which can be subarranged by Cutter number
of film title. Videorecordings of literary works are classed in the literature class.
Works by and about individual literary authors are grouped together. Class num-
bers for such works usually consist of numbers for the main class, language,
form, and period. For instance, Fitzgerald&rsquo;s Great Gatsby will be classed in
813.54 [813.54 = 8 (literature) + 1 (American literature in English) + 3 (Fiction)
+ 54 (1945-1999)]. 808.89 is designated for collections for and by specific kinds
of persons. With the help of Table 3-C, catalogers can build a number for collec-
tions of juvenile literary works (808.899282).
</p>
<p>■ARRANGEMENT
Arrangement
</p>
<p>The use of classification numbers does not necessarily affect the
physical arrangement of a video collection. Although shelving videorecordings
with the other types of material makes it easier for users to browse and access the
collection, security and preservation concerns cause many libraries to separate
videorecordings from other types of material. Here are a few popular approaches
for arranging videorecordings.
</p>
<p>Closed Stacks
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;closed stacks&rdquo; arrangement is popular among academic libraries
for several reasons. First, some of the videorecordings are educational materials
that would be expensive to replace. Second, the major function of academic media
centers is to support curricula, so these centers are strongly interested in ensuring
the condition, security, and availability of materials for educators. Many, in fact,
do not circulate videorecordings to students because of licensing restrictions. In
closed stacks, because materials are stored in a secure and controlled environment,
it becomes easier to take inventory of the collection, to maintain and preserve the
materials, and to control access. But users cannot browse the stacks, and the collec-
tion cannot be used without the catalog.
</p>
<p>Arrangement ■ 91</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Libraries using DDC or LCC numbers often add &ldquo;Video&rdquo; to their
classification numbers to remind users that the items are videorecordings. In
such libraries, items in the closed stacks will be arranged by classification numbers.
But closed stacks tend to encourage arrangement by accession number, size, or type,
resulting in libraries creating full bibliographic records for videorecordings but
assigning special numbers (e.g., Video A12) to them. The reason is that shelving
by accession number is more efficient for inventory control and retrieval but
wastes space. Shelving by size, on the other hand, saves space and supports
quick retrieval if the catalog is good. Some libraries arrange items by format, so
videocassettes, videodiscs, and films are stored in separate areas, and items
within each group are arranged with its own sequence of accession numbers.
This approach also requires strong support from the catalog.
</p>
<p>Shelving by Format, Type, Etc.
</p>
<p>Many public libraries encourage browsing by storing videorecord-
ings in an area separate from the other materials. The video collection is still
fully searchable in the catalog. These libraries put a special term (e.g., video,
videocassette) on top of the call number to identify them, and use some kind of
classification number to subarrange them. Depending on the nature and size of
the collection, some libraries use standard classification schemes such as DDC
and LCC, while others devise their own categories (e.g., &ldquo;B&rdquo; for biography; &ldquo;F&rdquo;
for feature films), and subarrange materials by Cutter numbers. This method collo-
cates materials and supports browsing.
</p>
<p>A variation to this approach is to arrange videorecordings by their
type. That means documentaries, videos of feature films, juvenile videos, and
topical videos are arranged separately. This method is appropriate if a library has
many items of each type. But if the videos are not classified and items of each
category are arranged by title, as in some libraries, browsing becomes somewhat
limited. For example, although it is fine to browse feature film videos by title, it
is not easy to browse topical videos by title&mdash;Saving Our Environment and
Green Earth cover the same subject but are far apart alphabetically. Users will
have to rely on the catalog to collocate these videos. One may wonder if public
libraries would take this approach a step further and subarrange feature film videos
by genre. A common response to this inquiry is that the videos public libraries
purchase are selected to meet the needs of their community and they have no
intention to compete with video stores. Indeed, many videos in public libraries
are educational and topical videos.
</p>
<p>92 ■ Videorecordings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Other Possibilities
</p>
<p>The method of &ldquo;intershelving with dummies&rdquo; discussed in Chapter
Three is also a possibility for arranging videorecordings because the size of
videorecordings is fairly standard. The same benefits and drawbacks also apply.
Interested readers may turn to Chapter Three for a discussion of this method.

<p>&bull; 020 &amp; 028: The ISBN and the publisher number are taken from the

</p>
<p>&bull; 090 &amp; 092: PS1541 is for 19th century American poets; 811.4 is a
number for works by and about literary authors. 811.4 is built from
811 (American poetry) and 4 (1861-1899).
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: The video has a title screen stating simply &ldquo;Emily Dickinson.&rdquo;
The statements of responsibility are taken from the opening credits
and the end credits. Young and Janows are transcribed here because
they have overall responsibility for the creation of this work.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The place of publication is taken from the container. The date
of publication requires reconciliation. While the program was
produced in 1988, the date on the cassette is 1986, and the video-
cassette was produced in 1995. Since what we have in hand is the
video, the 1995 copyright date is used.
</p>
<p>&bull; 440: &ldquo;Voices &amp; visions&rdquo; is prominently listed on the container and
the item itself. The end credits indicate that this is a series.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: The format of the video is always included in this field. Some
libraries include the format information in the first element of field
300 (e.g., 1 videocassette (VHS)). That is a local decision.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: Lawrence Pitkethly is well-known for his series, so the fact is noted.
</p>
<p>&bull; 520: A brief and objective summary of a video gives users an idea
of its content. Information on the container is usually useful for
this purpose.
</p>
<p>&bull; 600 &amp; 650: Since Dickinson is the subject of this video, she is en-
tered in field 600, and a topical heading for her occupation is also
provided and subdivided by Biography.
</p>
<p>&bull; 700s: LCRI to 21.29 recommends that when a production com-
pany is an added entry, no added entries are made for producers,
directors, writers, etc. Since the production company is traced in
710, the director and the producer are not traced. If a library
chooses to trace the producers and the director, it could justify that
decision if the contribution of these people is believed to be sig-
nificant. The same LCRI also recommends that added entries be
made for people serving as interviewees, delivering lectures or
discussing their ideas. So the four poets are traced in the order in
which their names appear in the bibliographic description.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710 fields: The production firm and the video distribution firm are
traced.

</p>
<p>&bull; 245 &amp; 508: The statement of responsibility includes the produc-
tion company only because a long list of individuals is included in
the end credits, and information on the people with overall respon-
sibility is not exactly the same as that on the container. Because of
this uncertainty, information on the producer, director, and writer
is included in field 508 instead of field 245.
</p>
<p>&bull; 440: The series information appears on the tape and the container.
Several titles of this series are listed on the container suggesting
that &ldquo;Sesame Street home video&rdquo; is a series title.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650s: Form headings are assigned. Closed-captioning is repre-
sented by a heading.
</p>
<p>&bull; 700s &amp; 710s: LCRI 21.29 recommends that when a production
company is made an added entry, no added entries are made for the
producers, directors, writers, etc. So no personal names are traced,
but the production firm, Children&rsquo;s Television Workshop is
traced. Authority work is done on all access points.
</p>
<p>&bull; 730: The television series is traced to link related works.

<p>&bull; 028: Publisher&rsquo;s number is entered in field 028, the first indicator
4 indicates video and the second indicator 2 will produce a note for
this number.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: The statement of responsibility was taken from the beginning
screens and the end credits.
</p>
<p>&bull; 300: The playing time on the cassette label is &ldquo;57 min.&rdquo; but it is de-
scribed as 60 minutes on the container. Since the cassette label is
considered a more preferable source for information, &ldquo;57 min.&rdquo; is
used in this field. The phrase, &ldquo;b&amp;w sequences,&rdquo; is included with
the second element to indicate that the video is not entirely colored.
The playing time is encoded in the fixed field element, Time.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: A note of publishing history indicates this video was origi-
nally a television episode. It clarifies the nature of this work, links
it to the original series, and provides an explanation for an added
entry for the original series.
</p>
<p>&bull; 520: The summary states that this video is an examination of the
Children&rsquo;s Aid Society&rsquo;s success and failure in relocating or-
phaned children. It clarifies the nature of the video and justifies the
provision of an added entry for the society.

<p>Discussion for Figure 4.6
</p>
<p>&bull; Fixed field: Code c in Tech indicates this video includes animation
and live action.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: Statement of responsibility is taken from the end credits. The
corporate bodies&rsquo; role in the creation of this item was copied and
presented first. Individuals with overall responsibility are entered
next.
</p>
<p>&bull; 490s: Items in these series seem to relate to each other only by
common physical characteristics (videos) and the numbering sug-
gests stock control, so the series are not traced (Rule 21.30L1).
</p>
<p>&bull; 511: Indicator 3 will produce a print constant, &ldquo;Narrator:&rdquo; for this
note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650s: The first 650 field is required for videos that are closed-
captioned. The other two topical headings reflect the contents of
the video. No appropriate form subdivisions are available to bring
out the format.
</p>
<p>&bull; 700s: The contribution of these individuals is significant, so they
are traced.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710s: Corporate bodies contributing to the production of this work
are also traced.

<p>Discussion for Figure 4.7
</p>
<p>&bull; Fixed field: The video is intended for adults, so code e is used in
Audn.
</p>
<p>&bull; 020: Each volume has its own ISBN, which is entered in its own
020 field.
</p>
<p>&bull; 043: When a work has a geographic focus, which is represented by
the subject headings, an 043 field can be added. The country code
is taken from the OCLC-MARC code list.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: This is a three-volume work and each volume has its own title.
This work can be cataloged as a multi-volume set or each volume
can be cataloged for itself and be linked to other volumes in this
work by a series title. Because the information on the chief source
is the same on all the volumes, it is better to catalog this work as a
three-volume set. Since field 511 is for information about performers
and field 508 for people who contribute to the production of the
video, the information about the creator and the producer are entered
in these fields instead of in the statement of responsibility.
</p>
<p>&bull; 246: A variant title is provided because it appears on the container
and users are likely to search for this item by it. The first indicator
1 will generate a note and an added entry for the title. The subtitle
of the title proper is also a likely candidate for variant title. If it is
traced, the indicators for 246 should be 10 and the initial article is
not entered, according to OCLC input guidelines.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The program was produced in 1991 and copyrighted by Pipher
Films, Inc., but the video was produced in 1992 and copyrighted to
GoodTimes Home Video, so 1992 is used as the date of publication.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: A production history note is entered in field 500.
</p>
<p>&bull; 505: If parts of a work have their own titles, those titles can be
listed in a formal contents note, 505. If it is desirable to make these
titles searchable, an enhanced 505 field can be used, with a second
indicator 0.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710s: The production company and the corporate body mentioned
in Area 4 are traced.

<p>Discussion for Figure 4.8
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: This work consists of three volumes and the same actors appear
in each of them, but each volume has its own director and produc-
tion team. Since the three volumes constitute one work, subfield c
of field 245 transcribes only the information that is common to the
volumes. The containers highlight persons whose contributions
are more significant than others, and that information is transcribed
in field 508.
</p>
<p>&bull; 300 &amp; 538: The sound information is recorded in subfield b of
field 300, but the characteristics of the sound are entered in field
538 together with the video format.
</p>
<p>&bull; 511s: The first 511 field uses indicator 3 to explain the role of
Fonda as the narrator. The second 511 field list the cast members,
so indicator 1 is used.
</p>
<p>&bull; 505: An enhanced contents note is created, with the second indicator
0, the numbering encoded in $g and the title encoded in $t to make
each title searchable.
</p>
<p>&bull; 700s: The producers and writers are traced for their contribution to
the entire work, and the narrator is traced also. These added entries
are arranged in the order in which the names appear in the biblio-
graphic description.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710s: The production company and the corporate body mentioned
in area 4 are traced according to LCRI 21.29.

</p>
<p>&bull; Fixed field: Because this work is R rated, code e (adults) is used in
Audn.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245 &amp; 508: One of the major challenges in cataloging films is to
determine which corporate bodies and individuals among the
many listed in the credits should be transcribed in Area 1. The
practice is to record those with overall responsibility for the work.
If there are others whose contribution is important, they are re-
corded in field 508.
</p>
<p>&bull; 300: The specific material designation for DVD is videodisc. The
presence of sound is recorded in subfield b, but the quality of the
sound is recorded in field 538.
</p>
<p>&bull; 546: Two language notes are combined.
</p>
<p>&bull; 511: Only lead performers are recorded in field 511. Indicator 1 is
for cast members.
</p>
<p>&bull; 508: This field records people whose contribution to the film is
important but not important enough for them to be recorded in
Area 1. Catalogers can exercise their judgment in determining if
these persons should be traced.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500s: These two notes are about the history of this work. They are
typical of videos of feature films.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500s: The quotation notes explain how this work differs from the
others. Since the quotations are not from the title screens, their
sources are indicated.
</p>
<p>&bull; 521: Rating information is recorded in field 521, indicator 8 is used
so that no print constant will be displayed with this information.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650s: Following SCM H2230, a genre heading, a required form
heading, and a heading for closed-captioned films are assigned to
this work.
</p>
<p>&bull; 700s: The writer, producer, director, cast members, and other con-
tributors are traced. They are presented in the order in which their
names appear in the bibliographic description. The name-title
added entry is the last of this group because of the order of added
entries specified by LCRI 21.29 (CBS 45).

<p>Discussion for Figure 4.10
</p>
<p>&bull; Fixed field: Since this film is of interest to many age groups, code
g is used in Audn for an item of general interest. The date of the
video was inferred from an accompanying material, so code p
(multiple date) is used in DtSt and two dates are entered in Dates,
the first is the publication date and the second the original date.
</p>
<p>&bull; 028: The publisher&rsquo;s number is entered in field 028 with first indicator
4 for video and second indicator 2, which will generate a note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 090 &amp; 092: PZ7 is used for juvenile belles lettres since 1870. A
complete call number will include a Cutter number by the author,
P.L. Travers, work letters from the title word, Mary, and a date of
publication. In DDC single films can be classed in 791.4372 and
further arranged alphabetically by film title.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: Because many individuals were mentioned in the item, it is
appropriate to list the name of the production company in subfield
c and leave the names of these people in field 508. The name of the
company, Walt Disney Company, is recorded here to indicate this
is a corporate body.
</p>
<p>&bull; 250: The edition statement is taken from the container.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The production firm and the distributor are listed on the box,
but the location of Walt Disney Home Video is not provided, so
the place is presented in square brackets. The publication date of
the video is inferred from an accompanying material, so it is entered
with a question mark in square brackets.
</p>
<p>&bull; 440: The series information appears on the item, the container, and
the box.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: The format and sound characteristics are on the box.
</p>
<p>&bull; 511: Major cast members are recorded in field 511.
</p>
<p>&bull; 508: Several people who contributed to this work are recorded in
field 508 but not all of them are traced.
</p>
<p>&bull; 521: The rating information is entered in field 521 with an indicator
8 so that no print constant will be displayed with the information.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650s: This film represents several types of films, all of which are
represented by subject headings.

<p>Computer Files
</p>
<p>Library collections of computer files have grown by type and number since
the 1960s, and the development of microcomputers in the 1980s contributed to
rapid proliferation of computer programs and data files.1 A recent survey found
that 100 percent of the academic library respondents collect computer files, and
93 percent of the public library respondents collect computer files.2 As computer
files become increasingly popular among users, the need to organize them for
access becomes stronger. One of the major challenges in cataloging computer
files is the lack of uniformity in the information that comes with the work. Some
computer files have extensive documentation and tip sheets, while others keep
all information on the files and the cataloger needs to install or decompress the
files to locate bibliographic information. A related problem is the lack of equip-
ment to read the files. While most libraries will not purchase computer files not
readable on their existing machines, some files carry introductory materials in
portable data format (PDF) that requires the use of Adobe Acrobat. If this soft-
ware is not available, the cataloger will have to download it from the Internet and
install it on his or her machine. Some knowledge of computer applications and
file structure, therefore, becomes important to catalogers. A more serious con-
sideration for catalogers is the need to reconcile information from various
sources. The title screen(s), disk label, container, and accompanying material
may carry similar information, thus catalogers often need to determine which
source to use for the necessary information. For instance, a &ldquo;README&rdquo; file may
list the system requirements of a program, while the container highlights some of
the machinery needed to run it. Similarly, a file may carry a publication date,
while its documentation carries a different date, and the container has a third
date. Cataloging rules cover problems like these, but it is also a challenge to keep
up with the changing standards.

<p>FIVE � COMPUTER FILES</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Cataloging rules for computer files have evolved with technology.
The second edition of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules was published in
1978 when data and program files were stored and manipulated in mainframe
computers. As collections of microcomputer files grew in the early 1980s, cata-
logers realized the inadequacy of the rules designed for machine-readable data
files. In 1984, in response to the need for guidance in cataloging microcomputer
files, ALA published the Guidelines for Using AACR2 Chapter 9 for Cataloging
Microcomputer Software3 and the British Library published a report, Study of
Cataloguing Computer Software: Applying AACR2 to Microcomputer Pro-
grams.4 The recommendations were subsequently debated and revised into
Chapter 9 of the 1988 revision of AACR2. Olson&rsquo;s report on how the rules were
developed and approved by various national and international bodies illustrates
the thoughtful process of rule revision.5 The rationale for the major changes in
Chapter 9 is explained by Weihs.6 In 1990 the first edition of the ISBD (CF) In-
ternational Standard Bibliographic Description for Computer Files was published
by its sponsor, the International Federation of Library Associations&rsquo; Sections on
Cataloguing and on Information Technology. It focused on software programs
and machine-readable databases.7 Many of its recommendations have been in-
corporated into the latest AACR2R.
</p>
<p>Technology in the late 1980s made it possible for creators to com-
bine text, sound, music, graphics, video, and other forms to present their ideas.
Multimedia applications have soared in the 1990s, and catalogers, once again,
realized rules for microcomputer files could not cover multimedia properly. As a
result, in 1994, ALA published the Guidelines for Bibliographic Description of
Interactive Multimedia.8 A bigger challenge presented itself in the 1990s when
the World Wide Web, with its user-friendly graphical interface, became widely
popular. The here-today-and-gone-tomorrow nature of Web resources caused
serious concerns about their organization. Some have questioned the wisdom in
cataloging the Web9 while others have affirmed the role of libraries in providing
access to information.10 A set of guidelines were developed for the InterCat project,
an experiment to determine whether cataloging rules and MARC format could
accommodate Web resources, and Olson&rsquo;s Cataloging Internet Resources: A
Manual and Practical Guide11 (2nd ed.) has become the standard for cataloging
Web resources. In the international arena the International Federation of Library
Associations&rsquo; Sections on Cataloguing and on Information Technology decided
in 1994 to review ISBD (CF) to determine how well it could cover interactive
multimedia, remote electronic files, new developments in optical technology,
and files in various formats. The result is the 1997 publication of ISBD for Elec-
tronic Resources (ER).12 Many recommendations of ISBD (ER) are likely to be
incorporated into cataloging standards in the future.
</p>
<p>In this chapter the cataloging rules for computer files are discussed.
Rules for multimedia are covered in Chapter Six and rules for remote access files
are described in Chapter Seven.

MARC Fields for Computer Files
</p>
<p>The MARC fields commonly used to encode computer files are
listed below. Field 006 is required if the Type element is not coded &ldquo;m.&rdquo; It is also
required for electronic serials. Field 007 records additional physical characteris-
tics and is required for all computer files.
</p>
<p>Common MARC fields for encoding computer files are:

<p>MARC Fields for Computer Files ■ 123</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Since the completion of format integration in the spring of 1996 cata-
logers are able to code bibliographic information consistently across formats.
OCLC&rsquo;s Bibliographic Formats and Standards (http://www.oclc.org/oclc/bib/
toc.htm) contains changes that resulted from format integration. Two major
changes are related to computer files and deserve attention.
</p>
<p>In the USMARC Update no. 3, code &ldquo;m&rdquo; for Type of Record (&ldquo;Type&rdquo;
in OCLC fixed field) was substantially narrowed to cover only computer soft-
ware, numeric data, computer-oriented multimedia, and online systems or services.
Such computer files will have a Type code &ldquo;m&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Type of Computer File&rdquo;
(&ldquo;File&rdquo; in OCLC fixed field) element will indicate the nature of the file. Thirteen
values have been defined for the &ldquo;Type of Computer File&rdquo; element, including code
a for numerical data, code b for computer program, code c for graphic data, code
d for text documents, code e for bibliographic data, code f for font, code g for
game, code h for sound, code i for interactive multimedia, code j for online sys-
tem or service, code m for combination of files and others. OCLC announced in
February 1998 that it would implement the changes, and issued OCLC Guide-
lines on the Choice of Type and BLvl for Electronic Resources13 in March 1998 to
assist catalogers in coding electronic resources. These guidelines were revised in
October 1999 and became Cataloging Electronic Resources: OCLC-MARC
Coding Guidelines.
</p>
<p>Another change is the addition of field 006, one of the results of
MARC format integration. Field 006 is an optional field that can be used to code
items that have material in more than one format&mdash;a book accompanied by a
CD-ROM, for instance. In such a case, the MARC format for monograph will be
used and a 006 field is added to code the electronic aspect of the CD-ROM.
</p>
<p>[on the monograph format]
</p>
<p>245 00 Web page design cookbook / $c William Horton ...

</p>
<p>300 xx, 649 p. : $b ill. ; $c 28 c,. + $e 1 computer optical
disc (ill : 4 3/4 in.).
</p>
<p>and this item will have an 006 com field as follows:
</p>
<p>T006: m AuDn: g File: c GPub:
</p>
<p>Code m in T006 indicates computer file, code g in AuDn indicates general audience,
and code c in File indicates graphic files. Because of this 006 field, searchers
qualifying their search statement to computer file format will be able to retrieve
this item.
</p>
<p>Field 006 has been defined for books, serials, visual materials, mixed
materials, maps, scores, sound recordings, and computer files.
</p>
<p>124 ■ Computer Files</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>006 and electronic serials: Field 006 is also used with electronic serials.
Since February 1998 the national standards recommend that the serial format be
used for language-based electronic serials and that the computer aspect be repre-
sented by a field 006. For instance,
</p>
<p>[on a serial format, with code a (language material) in Type, code
s (serial) in Blvd]
</p>
<p>245 00 Proceedings of the ... ACM Conference on digital
libraries ...
</p>
<p>This item will have an 006 com field:
</p>
<p>T006: m AuDn: File: d GPub:
</p>
<p>These codes indicate the item being cataloged is a computer file (&ldquo;m&rdquo;), no audi-
ence is specified (&ldquo;blank&rdquo;), and the file is textual in nature (&ldquo;d&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Field 007 is for additional physical characteristics. After format inte-
gration field 007 is required for computer files. The subfields and codes include
(see OCLC bibliographic format for details) five elements:
</p>
<p>Subfield a: computer file Code: c
</p>
<p>Subfield b: physical format Codes: 11 codes (e.g., disks
(j), discs (o))
</p>
<p>Subfield d: color characteristics Codes: 7 codes (e.g., multi-
colored (c), grey scale (g))
</p>
<p>Subfield e: size Codes: 10 codes (e.g., 3 1/2 in.
(a), 4 3/4 in. (g), 5 1/4 in. (o))
</p>
<p>Subfield f: sound characteristics Codes: 3 codes (e.g., silent
(blank), sound (a))
</p>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<p>A CD-ROM database with grey scale and sound
</p>

<p>■DESCRIPTION
Description
</p>
<p>Rules for Descriptive Cataloging
</p>
<p>Rules in Chapter 9 cover published and unpublished computer files,
which include computer programs and data files of all types. These files can be
encoded on any types of physical carriers, including magnetic disks, optical discs,
cartridges, cassettes, reels, and many others. These rules cover computer files that
are accessible directly on a workstation, on a local area network, or on the Internet.
This chapter focuses on the cataloging of computer files that are accessible locally.
</p>
<p>Chief Source of Information
</p>
<p>In the course of revising cataloging rules, catalogers learned that
cataloging records based on title screen(s) and those based on external sources
were quite different, so it was decided that internal sources should be preferred.
According to Chapter 9, the title screen(s) is the chief source of information for
computer files. If no title screens are available, catalogers may take information
from other internal sources such as the main menus, the &ldquo;about&rdquo; sub-menu, or
program statements. If different amounts of information are presented in these
sources, AACR2R recommends that the source with the most complete informa-
tion be used as the chief source.

</p>
<p>If no internal sources present the information needed, the following
sources can be used, in order of preference: the physical carrier or its labels, in-
formation provided by the publisher or creator (often referred to as &ldquo;documenta-
tion&rdquo;), or information on the container. The source of the title proper is always
recorded as a 500 note.

<p>If a work consists of several physical parts that do not contain a collective title,
but the container or its label has a collective title, catalogers may use the con-
tainer or its label as the chief source. If the information needed is not found in the
chief source or the alternate sources described above, catalogers may use, in the
order of preference, other published description of the file or other sources to de-
scribe the item.
</p>
<p>Prescribed Sources of Information
</p>
<p>The prescribed sources for each of the eight areas of the biblio-
graphic record are summarized below:
</p>
<p>245, 250, 260, 4xx Chief source (the internal sources),
(Areas 1, 2, 4, 6) the carrier or its labels, information
</p>
<p>from the publisher, and the
container
</p>
<p>256, 300, 5xx, 02x Any source
(Areas 3, 5, 7, 8)
</p>
<p>Information taken from outside the prescribed sources is to be enclosed in square
brackets.
</p>
<p>9.1. Title and Statement of Responsibility
(MARC field 245)
</p>
<p>Title proper is transcribed as instructed in 1.1B. The source of the title
is a required note (in the 500 field). Catalogers need to keep in mind that there are
several possible sources of title proper. If a work has a title screen, a title proper
is usually presented there. For works without a title screen, likely sources include
the &ldquo;README&rdquo; file, &ldquo;VolInfo&rdquo; file, the &ldquo;About this program&rdquo; option from the
pull down menu of the &ldquo;HELP&rdquo; page, and many others. When a file is open in
Macintosh machines the Apple icon has an option for &ldquo;About [this file]&rdquo; which
often provides the title screen or similar information. When internal sources are
not helpful, catalogers can rely on external ones such as the disc label, documen-
tation, container, etc., to locate information needed for this area.
</p>
<p>Description ■ 127</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When a title begins with the phrase &ldquo;Welcome to ...&rdquo; catalogers need
to consider if the phrase is an integral part of the title. If it is not, the phrase is not
included in the title proper.
</p>
<p>Title screen: Welcome to Clinical Practice Guidelines on CD-ROM
</p>
<p>Transcribed as:
</p>
<p>245 00 Clinical practice guidelines on CD-ROM $h

</p>
<p>But when a title is preceded by a phrase that indicates the involvement of a cor-
porate body or a person, that phrase is included in the title proper transcription,
according to LC Rule Interpretation 7.1B (CSB 13). A variant title is typically
provided for the part following this phrase.
</p>
<p>Title screen: Microsoft presents Dragon Games
</p>
<p>Transcribed as:
</p>
<p>245 00 Microsoft presents dragon games $h [computer file]
</p>
<p>246 30 Dragon games
</p>
<p>General Material Designation (GMD): The general material desig-
nation for all computer files is &ldquo;computer file&rdquo; regardless of the type or size of
the carrier or the location of the file. The only exception is that &ldquo;interactive multi-
media&rdquo; is the GMD for interactive multimedia because it is so designated by the
1994 ALA Guidelines. Many catalogers have expressed a need for a better GMD
for Internet resources, and ISBD (ER) has recommended &ldquo;electronic resource.&rdquo;
Some libraries have adopted &ldquo;electronic resource&rdquo; locally, but the term has yet to
be approved by the Joint Steering Committee for Revision of AACR.
</p>
<p>Statement of Responsibility: Statement of responsibility is recorded
only if it is prominently presented in the chief source. Persons or bodies respon-
sible for the content of the file should be recorded in Area 1. Persons contribut-
ing to the preparation or production of the file and those sponsoring the creation
of the file are usually recorded in notes. Such notes are useful in justifying the
provision of added entries. Information not taken from the chief source should
be enclosed in square brackets.

</p>
<p>9.2. Edition (MARC field 250)
</p>
<p>When a file experiences changes in the intellectual or artistic content, a
separate bibliographic record is created. To determine the presence of an edition
statement, catalogers should look for words such as &ldquo;edition, issue, version, release,
level, update&rdquo; (9.2B2). Appropriate abbreviations and numerals from Appendices
B and C in AACR2R should be used to transcribe an edition statement.
</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish the edition of a computer file from the
edition of an operating system. Only formal edition statements of computer files
are recorded, and multiple edition statements are recorded in one 250 field. If the
source of an edition statement is different from that of the title proper, a note
should be provided. This is because information on the disk label, container, or
accompanying material may be different from internal information. Sometimes
publishers update a file without updating the documentation, sometimes the
other way around. So if the source of an edition is different from that of the title
proper, AACR2R recommends a note be given.

<p>Some computer files are available for IBM PCs and Macintoshes. A statement
such as &ldquo;Macintosh version&rdquo; is considered an edition statement. But if a file simply
states &ldquo;Poetry writing for Macintosh,&rdquo; no edition statement should be inferred.

<p>9.3. File Characteristics (MARC field 256)
</p>
<p>Area 3 records the content information of the file(s) being cataloged. If
information on the type of files, number of records, number of statements, or bytes
that constitute the content of the files is readily available, it should be recorded.
</p>
<p>Currently acceptable file designations include computer data, com-
puter program(s), and computer data and program(s). These statements are obvi-
ously not specific enough. They can be enhanced by terms listed for the &ldquo;Type of
Computer Files&rdquo; element. For example, if a file is basically textual, &ldquo;computer
text data&rdquo; can be used.
</p>
<p>256 Computer text data and program.
</p>
<p>256 Computer program (1200 statements)
</p>
<p>256 Computer data (10 files : 250 records each)
</p>
<p>CONSER participants do not use field 256, but LC has used this field
in its non-serial records. If the information is available, it is a good practice to include
it. Catalogers should know that for computer files that are accessed remotely,
field 256 is required. ISBD (ER) has developed a long list of new terms for this
area.14 If ISBD (ER) is incorporated into AACR, more descriptive terms such as
computer newsletter, computer game, and computer spreadsheet program will
be available.
</p>
<p>9.4. Publication, Distribution, Etc.
(MARC field 260)
</p>
<p>The formal publishing statement found in the item is transcribed.
Rules for this area are the same as Rules 1.4. Catalogers record the first place of
publication, use the shortest possible form for the publisher&rsquo;s name (as long as
the shortest form does not cause any confusion), and record the date of publica-
tion that applies to the item being cataloged. Distributor information, if available
and important, is recorded in Area 4, and catalogers may add a term to clarify the
role of a distributor. If several dates are found on a computer file, the date that
applies to the item as a whole is used. If several copyright dates are present, the
latest one is recorded. For unpublished files, the place of publication and the
publisher&rsquo;s name are left blank and only the date of creation is recorded.

</p>
<p>300 Extent of item : $b sound, color ; $c dimensions + $e
accompanying material.
</p>
<p>The first element records the number of physical units of the carrier.
These specific material designations include computer cartridge, computer cas-
sette, computer disk (for magnetically encoded disks), computer optical disc (for
optically encoded discs such as CD-ROM), and computer reel. The 1998 revision
of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules uses &ldquo;computer optical disc&rdquo; instead
of &ldquo;computer laser optical disc&rdquo; for CD-ROM.
</p>
<p>If a file contains sound or color, &ldquo;sd.&rdquo; and &ldquo;col.&rdquo; are recorded for the
second element. The dimension of the physical carrier is recorded in inches. The
size of floppy disks is either 5 1 4 in. or 3 1 2 in., while the standard size of optical
discs is in 4 3 4 in.
</p>
<p>300 2 computer disks ; $c 3 1/2 in.
</p>
<p>300 1 computer optical disc : $b sd., col. ; $c 4 3/4 in.
</p>
<p>Libraries vary in the amount of information they provide for accom-
panying materials. Generally, details about an accompanying material are pro-
vided if the material is substantial. The following practices are common.
</p>
<p>300 1 computer disk : $b sd., col. ; $c 3 1/2 in + $e 1 user&rsquo;s

<p>9.7. Notes
</p>
<p>Notes are important to computer files because they help users assess
the files without running the files. AACR2R stipulates the order in which notes should
be recorded, whereas CONSER Guidelines instruct participants to enter notes by
field number in numerical order. Libraries can select the approach that is most
helpful to their users. In this section AACR2R prescribed order for notes is followed.
</p>
<p>9.7B1a. Nature and Scope Note (MARC field 500): Information
about the nature and scope is always presented first. If this information is not
clear from the rest of the record, a note should be provided.
</p>
<p>500 Statistical program with graphic capabilities.
</p>
<p>9.7B1b. System Requirements (MARC field 538): This information
is critical because it helps users decide if they have the right setup to run a file.
This note usually includes the following data elements in the order given:
</p>
<p>538 System requirements: Make or model of computer;
memory required; operating systems; software
requirements; required or recommended character-
istics of peripherals.
</p>
<p>538 System requirements: IBM PC compatible; 4 MB
RAM; Windows 3.1 or later; double-drive CD-ROM.
</p>
<p>This string of data may seem confusing, but the note is actually easy to
prepare. Information on system requirements often appears on the container, the
user&rsquo;s guide, or internal sources such as the &ldquo;README&rdquo; file. Publishers usually list
the system requirements somewhere in the item. Catalogers may need to rearrange
the order of the elements to conform to the order listed above.
</p>
<p>If the requirements for several platforms are the same, only one note
is needed:
</p>
<p>538 System requirements: Windows or Macintosh; 8 MB
RAM; CD-ROM.
</p>
<p>But if the requirements are platform specific, a note is provided for
each platform:
</p>
<p>538 System requirements for Windows: 133 MHz Pentium
computer; 24 MB RAM; Windows 95 or 98; high
color (65,535 colors) capable 2 MB video card; 8X
CD-ROM drive ; sound card and mouse.
</p>
<p>538 System requirements for Macintosh: Power MAC
100 MHz; 32 MB RAM; OS 7.6; thousands of colors/
640x480 screen resolution.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.7B1c. Mode of Access (MARC field 538): This note is especially
important for remote access files. Previous cataloging practice included the host
site of the files. Current practice presents only the information on how the files
can be accessed.
</p>
<p>538 Mode of access: Company intranet.
</p>
<p>538 Mode of access: World Wide Web.
</p>
<p>9.7B3. Source of Title Proper (MARC field 500): The source of title
proper is always recorded for computer files.
</p>
<p>500 Title from title screen.
</p>
<p>500 Title from disc label.
</p>
<p>9.7B4. Variant Title (MARC field 246): After format integration, title
variants are entered in field 246. Such titles can appear in different parts of the
chief source or other parts of an item (such as cover title, spine title, running title,
and caption title). The first indicator dictates the production of a note and an
added entry, and the second indicator specifies the type of variant title.
</p>
<p>245 00 History of ships &amp; navies $h [computer file].
</p>
<p>246 30 History of ships and navies
</p>
<p>246 30 Ships and navies
</p>
<p>To produce a special display for a variant title, catalogers should enter
the source in subfield i and the variant title in subfield a.
</p>
<p>246 1 $i Container title: $a Web publishing with HTML
</p>
<p>will produce a note: Container title: Web publishing with HTML and a title
added entry: Title: Web publishing with HTML.
</p>
<p>9.7B6. Statement of Responsibility (MARC field 500): People and
corporate bodies involved in the creation of the file but not included in Area 1 are
entered here.
</p>
<p>500 Developed by Pixel Technology.
</p>
<p>500 Designed by Iris Magic, Inc.
</p>
<p>9.7B7. Edition and History (MARC field 500): The source of the edition
statement, if different from that of the title proper, should be presented in a note.

in field 521 if the information is formally presented. Information can appear in a
formal statement or an image indicating the age groups intended. If the rating
source is present, it can be included. Catalogers should not use personal evalua-
tion as audience note.
</p>
<p>521 Ages 9+
</p>
<p>521 8 ESRB rating: ages 13+
</p>
<p>When the first indicator is blank, a print constant &ldquo;Audience:&rdquo; is displayed with
the data. When indicator 8 is used, no print constant is displayed.
</p>
<p>9.7B17. Summary (MARC field 520): A succinct, objective state-
ment of the contents of a file can be very useful for users. If a description in the
file summarizes the contents well, quote it as the summary.

<p>520 A shareware telecommunications program for the
Macintosh. It supports ZModem, YModem, Xmodem,
Kermit and CIS B-Plus/Quick-B file transfers, VT100
&amp; ANSI-BBS emulation, including colors, and an
efficient scroll back buffer.
</p>
<p>9.7B18. Contents (MARC field 505): The title of parts of an item can
be listed in field 505 if they can help users understand the contents of the item. If
there are too many parts, a partial list can be provided. If it is desirable to make the
individual titles searchable, a second indicator 0 can be used to create an enhanced
content note.

</p>
<p>Enhanced CD
</p>
<p>Many vocal artists have combined video or multimedia in their record-
ings to present background information about their songs, concerts, and personal
interests. A fairly standard practice is to create an &ldquo;Enhanced CD,&rdquo; which is a
regular audio CD with a multimedia CD-ROM track. To play an Enhanced CD,
one needs an audio CD player for the audio portion of the disc and a computer for
the multimedia CD-ROM track. Publishers usually label Enhanced CDs promi-
nently on the disc, the case, or the documentation to encourage sale. Because
audio CD players cannot access the multimedia CD-ROM track, some publishers
include a warning on the disc or the case: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play track one. Track one will
play silence or static on audio CD players. Macintosh System 7 or Microsoft
Windows 3.1 required (or greater).&rdquo; Details of the system requirements for the
multimedia track and installation instructions are usually included in the &ldquo;READ
ME&rdquo; file on the Enhanced CD.
</p>
<p>The cataloging of Enhanced CDs is the same as that of regular CDs,
except for the following parts. First, the cataloger usually provides a note to indi-
cate the item is an Enhanced CD. It can be a 500 note (e.g., An Enhanced CD.), a
520 note (An Enhanced CD of ten songs and a CD-ROM multimedia presenta-
tion), or a 505 note (1. CD-ROM Multimedia presentation -- 2. Elsewhere -- 3.
Plenty.). Second, the cataloger records the system requirements of the multime-
dia track in a 538 field, following Rule 9.7B1b. Third, the cataloger records the
characteristics of the multimedia CD-ROM track in a computer file 006 field so
</p>
<p>Description ■ 135</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>that the item can be retrieved as a computer file. Finally, the cataloger uses a
computer file 007 field to record the physical characteristics of the multimedia
CD-ROM. Field 007 is required for all computer files. For example,
</p>

<p>Because this CD is musical, a workform for musical sound recording is used.
The code in &ldquo;Type&rdquo; is &ldquo;j&rdquo; (musical sound recording), and code &ldquo;m&rdquo; (a nonserial
item) is used in &ldquo;Blvl.&rdquo; Code &ldquo;j&rdquo; in &ldquo;Type&rdquo; enables this item to be searched as a
musical sound recording.
</p>
<p>Field 006 represents the computer characteristics of this item, with &ldquo;m&rdquo;
specifying this is a computer file, and code &ldquo;h&rdquo; in &ldquo;File&rdquo; indicating sound file.
Because of code &ldquo;m&rdquo; in the 006 field, this item can be retrieved as a computer
file. The first 007 field (a sound recording 007 field) records the characteristics
of the sound recording, and the second one (a computer file 007 field) describes
the physical characteristics of the computer aspect of this item. A 500 note iden-
tifies the item as an Enhanced CD. Field 538 records the system requirements,
listing the elements according to the order specified by Rule 9.7B1b&mdash;model,
memory, operating system, software, peripherals.
</p>
<p>Electronic Serials
</p>
<p>Serial publications have appeared in CD-ROM and computer disk
formats, but more and more publishers are placing their serials on the Internet.
According to a standard directory for serials on the Internet, electronic journals
have increased from 27 titles in 1991 to 2,459 titles in 1997.15 Some of these titles
have print counterparts, while others are available online only. The CONSER
Cataloging Manual provides authoritative guidance for the cataloging of remote
access serial files,16 and the treatment of such files are included in Chapter Seven
of this book. For serials on CD-ROM or other types of electronic carriers, catalogers
need to consult Chapter 9 (for computer files) and Chapter 12 (for serials) of
AACR2R. There are many complex cases in serial cataloging. The following sec-
tion summarizes the most typical approach. Readers interested in more examples
should consult Liheng and Chan&rsquo;s excellent guide for serial cataloging.17
</p>
<p>The chief source of information for printed serial is the title page, or
title page substitute, of the first issue, or the earliest available issue. Similarly, in
cataloging direct access electronic serials, catalogers begin with the title screen
of the first issue or the earliest available issue. If no title screen is available, other
internal sources such as main menu or program statements can be used. If no inter-
nal sources present the information needed, the following sources can be used, in
order of preference: the physical carrier or its labels, information provided by the
publisher or creator (often referred to as &ldquo;documentation&rdquo;), or information on
the container. The source of the title proper is always recorded in a 500 note.
</p>
<p>The description of direct access electronic serials is more similar to
the description of monographic computer files than different, and many rules
discussed above can be applied to such electronic serials. The differences, how-
ever, should be noted. First, CONSER participants do not use field 256. Second,
as typical to printed serials, the frequency of a serial is entered in field 310 and its
numeric or chronological designation is entered in field 362. If the description is
based on the earliest available issue, a 500 note: &ldquo;Description based on: ...&rdquo; is
</p>
<p>Description ■ 137</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>provided. A typical MARC record for a direct access computer file serial with-
out print counterpart therefore looks as follows:

</p>
<p>But if a print counterpart of the serial exists and it shares the same title
with the electronic version, a uniform title with a qualifier is used to distinguish
the title of the electronic version from the print title:
</p>
<p>245 00 Multimedia technology. &lt;= for the print title
</p>
<p>130 0 Multimedia technology (CD-ROM)   &lt;= for the
electronic version
</p>
<p>245 00 Multimedia technology $h [computer file]
</p>
<p>In addition, a 530 note is added to indicate the existence of another version and a
776 field is used to enter the title of the print version and link the two versions.
For instance,
</p>
<p>530 Also available in print version.

<p>Assignment of Access Points
</p>
<p>Chapter 21, Choice of Access Points, applies to the selection of access
points for computer files also. If a personal author is responsible for a work, the
author is the main entry. If a corporate body meets the requirements of Rule
21.1B2, it is selected as the main entry. Since the creation of a computer file often
involves many people, most computer files have title as the main entry.
</p>
<p>Rules 21.29 and 21.30 provide guidelines for selecting added entries.
Corporate bodies named in the publication, distribution, etc., area are usually
good candidates for added entries. But no headings should be assigned for the
program language, the make and model of computer for which the computer file
is designed, or the operating system required for a computer file. Such informa-
tion is included in the note for system requirements (field 538), which can be
made searchable if a library chooses to do so. Earlier records in bibliographic
utilities may include 753 fields for these elements, but that practice was discon-
tinued by the Library of Congress in 1996.
</p>
<p>■ SUBJECT ANALYSIS
Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings
</p>
<p>American Library Association published Guidelines on Subject Access
to Microcomputer Software18 in 1986 to aid the subject analysis of computer
files. The three principles of the Guidelines continue to be valid:
</p>
<p>1. The entire record (descriptive cataloging, subject cataloging,
and classification) should provide the access needed by the user.
</p>
<p>2. Sound practices of subject analysis and classification should be
followed to avoid unwieldy files and useless shelf arrange-
ments caused by grouping materials together by form alone.
</p>
<p>3. One must ensure that adequate subject headings and linkages
exist in Library of Congress Subject Headings, and that Library
of Congress Classification and Dewey Decimal Classification
have adequate provisions for the subjects covered by micro-
computer software. Where standard headings are inadequate,
libraries should develop and document their own according to
sound principles of subject analysis.
</p>
<p>LC&rsquo;s practice reflects many recommendations of the ALA Guide-
lines. Subject Cataloging Manual (SCM) instructs that the principles regarding
the number of headings assigned and the specificity of headings (H180) should
be applied to the subject analysis of computer files.19 SCM H2070 recommends
that when cataloging a computer program, catalogers should assign at least one
</p>
<p>Subject Analysis ■ 139</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>topical heading to indicate the subject or genre of the software and add the free-
floating subdivision &ldquo;--Software&rdquo; to the topical heading. But catalogers should
not assign a heading for the named computer program. For instance,
</p>
<p>245 00 Songworks $h [computer file]
</p>
<p>650 0 Composition (Music) $v Software
</p>
<p>The heading of a program should be assigned only to works about
the program. This practice is explained later.
</p>
<p>SCM H2070 also advises that catalogers assign no headings for the
program language, the make or model of the computer, or the operating systems
of a computer file because such information is usually recorded in the descrip-
tive cataloging part of a bibliographic record.
</p>
<p>Subdivisions such as &ldquo;--Computer programs&rdquo; and &ldquo;--Software&rdquo; are
frequently used in describing computer files, but there is also confusion over their
assignment. According to SCM, the free-floating form subdivision &ldquo;--Software&rdquo;
should be used under each heading assigned to a work. Computer programs in-
tended for children no higher than the 8th grade should be assigned &ldquo;--Juvenile
software.&rdquo; This practice applies to materials with the intellectual level code a, b,
or c in Audn and those coded f (for special audiences) but is clearly juvenile in
nature.
</p>
<p>But catalogers should not assign the subdivision &ldquo;--Computer pro-
grams&rdquo; to software because this subdivision is not a form subdivision and is used
only for works about computer programs.
</p>
<p>In cataloging works about software, the practice of Library of Con-
gress is to assign a heading (usually a uniform title) for the named computer pro-
gram and a topical heading with the subdivision &ldquo;--Computer programs&rdquo; to
indicate this is a work about the named computer program. For instance,
</p>
<p>245 00 Beginner&rsquo;s guide to Songworks. [a book about this
program.]
</p>
<p>630 00 Songworks
</p>
<p>650 0 Composition (Music) $x Computer programs.
</p>
<p>SCM H2070 offers details on how to establish headings for named computer
programs.
</p>
<p>The subdivision &ldquo;--Databases&rdquo; is also frequently associated with
computer files. SCM H1520 defines a database as &ldquo;a collection of logically inter-
related data stored together in one or more computerized files, usually created
and managed by a database management system&rdquo; (p. 1). Before assigning this
subdivision catalogers need to examine the file to determine if it is truly a data-
base. For instance,
</p>
<p>140 ■ Computer Files</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>245 00 Solutions T-PRO database $h [computer file].
</p>
<p>650 0 Chemicals $v Databases.
</p>
<p>650 0 Poisons $v Databases.
</p>
<p>If a file cannot be viewed, catalogers should consider if the item has been pre-
sented as a database or if accompanying materials indicate the coding and struc-
ture of the data. To a work about databases on a subject, &ldquo;--Databases&rdquo; is
assigned as a topical subdivision (entered under subfield x).
</p>
<p>In addition, SCM stipulates that for two special categories of material
the subdivision &ldquo;--Databases&rdquo; should not be assigned. If the computer files are
&ldquo;essentially textual in nature&rdquo; (H1520, p. 3), catalogers are advised to assign
only the subject headings appropriate for the textual material. Conference pro-
ceedings, full-text databases, literary works, and articles belong to this category.
For instance,
</p>
<p>245 00 Poetry in motion $h [computer file]
</p>
<p>520 Includes original texts of poems by 24 contemporary
poets. Also contains the poets&rsquo; performance and
interviews.
</p>
<p>650 0 American poetry $y 20th century $x History and
criticism.
</p>
<p>650 0 Poetry, modern $y 20th century.
</p>
<p>The other category includes works for reference, such as &ldquo;directories,
bibliographies, catalogs, dictionaries, encyclopedias, indexes, or other similar
types&rdquo; (H1520, p. 6). Catalogers should assign the appropriate form headings or
form subdivision under the subjects. For example,
</p>
<p>245 00 ACM electronic guide to computing literature $h
[computer file].
</p>
<p>650 0 Computer science literature $v Indexes.
</p>
<p>Subject Analysis ■ 141</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Furthermore, for collections of non-textual data that are not encoded for data
management, SCM also advises against using the subdivision &ldquo;--Databases.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Classification Numbers
</p>
<p>While many libraries use authority lists such as LCSH to assign sub-
ject headings, the classification of computer files is less uniform. A recent survey
found 70 percent of large academic libraries classify computer files by LCC,
while 64 percent of large public libraries classify them by DDC.20 There are
many other different arrangements among libraries.
</p>
<p>Both LCC and DDC treat computer files the same as other materials,
and files are classed with the area of applications. For instance, a computer pro-
gram for accounting is classed with accounting instead of with computer science.
The practice of the Library of Congress is to class a software &ldquo;in the same
number in which a book about that software would be classed&rdquo; (SCM F710).21 If
&ldquo;Special programs, A-Z&rdquo; is listed under the appropriate number, computer files
are classed there. In most cases, computer files are classed in the number for &ldquo;Data
processing&rdquo; or its equivalent under the appropriate topic. DDC has expanded the
range for computer science materials and offered instructions for the use of
004-006.
</p>
<p>Arrangement
</p>
<p>Weihs and Intner both advocate an integrated approach to make
computer files browsable.22 Other benefits include ease of circulation control, aid
to collection selection, and support for collection evaluation. The use of the same
classification scheme is also useful for closed stacks because the scheme gives
users and staff an arrangement pattern to follow. Weihs details procedures to inter-
shelve computer files with the rest of the collection23 and suggests the use of
dummies if libraries prefer to shelve computer files elsewhere. But some libraries
choose to shelve them separately from other materials because computer files
are subject to climatic and handling problems. For security reasons, some place
computer files in closed stacks or treat them much like reserve materials.24
</p>
<p>142 ■ Computer Files</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Circulation of computer files is a related concern. For books accom-
panied by electronic materials, public libraries tend to shelve them with the
books and circulate them like books. But some academic libraries prefer to place
the electronic materials in a separate area to ensure their integrity and security,
and patrons need to check out the electronic materials while they check out the
books. As for computer files, many large academic libraries load popular files on
library computers or networks to encourage access and circulate less popular titles.
Some libraries do not circulate computer files at all, and patrons have to make a
request for files to be loaded on a network to be used. Similarly, some public
libraries only allow in-house use of computer files so that patrons can have expert
assistance if needed and the security of the file and the security of the library&rsquo;s
network are ensured. Some libraries, however, have found success in circulating
software and electronic materials that accompany books.25

<p>Discussion for Figure 5.1
</p>
<p>&bull; File, 007: Code b in File indicates this is a computer program.
Field 007 is required for all computer files. The codes specify that
this is a computer file (&ldquo;c&rdquo;) on a magnetic disk (&ldquo;j&rdquo;) with no color
(&ldquo;n&rdquo;) and is 3 1 2 in. in diameter.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: Like most computer files this item has a title main entry. The
general material designation &ldquo;computer file&rdquo; follows the title
proper immediately, so the other title information is recorded after
the subfield h for GMD.
</p>
<p>&bull; 250: This is an example of edition statements that include infor-
mation on the type of computer for which a file is intended. Be-
cause the source of this statement is different from that of the title
proper, a 500 note is created and included below.
</p>
<p>&bull; 300: The file is on a magnetically encoded disk, so &ldquo;computer
disk&rdquo; is used to describe the physical carrier. Because the user&rsquo;s
guide is substantial, details of this item are provided.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: Information on system requirements is one of the first notes
to be presented. The information appears on the container and the
user&rsquo;s guide, but these two sources do not have exactly the same
information. Since the user&rsquo;s guide provides fuller information, it
is used as the source for the information on system requirements.
The source does not list the information in the order specified by
AACR2R, and the elements are rearranged to conform to that order.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The source of the title proper is a required note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: This note is provided because the source of the edition state-
ment is different from that of the title proper.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650: LC Subject Cataloging Manual advises that when cataloging
a software program, catalogers should assign a topical heading for the
program with &ldquo;software&rdquo; as the form subdivision. No headings for
the name of the program should be assigned. Following the latest
guidelines in encoding form subdivision, &ldquo;software&rdquo; is entered under
subfield v.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710: Publisher of the program is traced per 21.1B3.

<p>Discussion for Figure 5.2
</p>
<p>&bull; File, 007: Code &ldquo;b&rdquo; specifies this is a software program. Field 007
describes the physical characteristics of this item: computer file
(&ldquo;c&rdquo;), optical disc (&ldquo;o&rdquo;), and 4 3 4 in. (&ldquo;g&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: When a title appears in different forms in different sources,
the fuller form is used. On the disc label &ldquo;for Macintosh &amp; Windows&rdquo;
follows the title proper closely, so it is transcribed as the other title
information in subfield b.
</p>
<p>&bull; 250: The edition statement appears on the title screen and is tran-
scribed accordingly. &ldquo;5.0&rdquo; on the title screen may be interpreted as
an edition statement. But since this information is transcribed as
part of the title proper, it is not treated as an edition statement here.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: Publisher information is found in the pull-down menu from
the title screen, so it is not bracketed.
</p>
<p>&bull; 300: When there are several accompanying materials, all of them are
recorded in one subfield e. There is no prescribed order for enter-
ing accompanying materials.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: Since the system requirements are platform specific, two 538
notes are provided. The information is taken from the installation
instruction and the elements are rearranged so that computer type
is presented first, followed by memory requirements, operating
systems, software requirements, and peripherals. &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo;
system information is included in this note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650: Two topics describe the purpose of this program, so two topical
headings are assigned, with &ldquo;software&rdquo; as the form subdivision.

<p>Discussion for Figure 5.4
</p>
<p>&bull; This computer file employs texts and images to illustrate its sub-
jects and connects related information with hypertext links. But it
is not considered an interactive multimedia file because the navi-
gation patterns are essentially linear. It has a &ldquo;tree-and-branch&rdquo;
structure that requires users to explore each level sequentially. As
a result, this item is treated as a computer file.
</p>
<p>&bull; File: Code &ldquo;m&rdquo; stands for combination of file types and is used
because the item has text, graphics, and a limited search program.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The information is located within the file, so it is not presented
in brackets.
</p>
<p>&bull; 520: The note indicates the source of this file&rsquo;s content and new
features provided in the electronic version. This information should
help users to determine if the electronic version is useful to them.

<p>&bull; 650: The subject is easy to determine. Form subdivision is entered
in subfield v.

<p>Discussion for Figure 5.5
</p>
<p>&bull; Similar to the previous title, this item uses multimedia (sound,
text, image, and video) to present information. Although the con-
tainer states that this is an &ldquo;interactive CD-ROM comic book,&rdquo; the
parts of the file are not interconnected, nor can users explore the
file at will. Because of the linear paths provided, this item is
treated as a computer file.
</p>
<p>&bull; File, 007: Code &ldquo;m&rdquo; indicates several file types are included. The
codes of 007 specify that this computer file (&ldquo;c&rdquo;), on an optical
disc (&ldquo;o&rdquo;), multicolored (&ldquo;c&rdquo;), on a 43 4 in. disc (&ldquo;g&rdquo;), and has
sound (&ldquo;a&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: The title proper is transcribed as stated by Rule 1.1B1, with
the wording recorded exactly but not the capitalization. Because
users may look for this item under &ldquo;spiderman,&rdquo; a 246 field is pro-
vided for it.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The place of publication cannot be located, so &ldquo;s.l.&rdquo; (sino
loco) is used. Information on the distributor is included. Since the
location of the distributor is available, it is coded in field 260.
</p>
<p>&bull; 440: The container lists X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Iron Man as
the other CD-ROM comic books available and urges potential
buyers to &ldquo;get them all.&rdquo; &ldquo;Marvel CD-ROM Comics&rdquo; is therefore
interpreted as a series title. In case of doubt, an alternative treat-
ment is to present it as a quotation note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: Two notes are provided because the system requirements are
platform specific. The elements are rearranged to follow the order
specified by AACR2R.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The company developing the product is quoted here. Because the
information is not taken from the chief source, its source is recorded.
This note will make it clear to users why Pixel Technologies is
traced.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: This statement appears in large print on all sides of the con-
tainer. Since it seems important, it is presented as a quotation note
with the source noted.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710: The corporate bodies are traced per 21.1B3 for their involve-
ment in the production of this item.

<p>Discussion for Figure 5.6
</p>
<p>&bull; This item is a collection of computer games. Although it makes
use of sound and graphics and gives players scores, players have to
explore the games in a linear fashion. So this item is cataloged as a
computer file.
</p>
<p>&bull; File, 007: Code &ldquo;g&rdquo; indicates the file contains games. The codes of
field 007 shows that this is a computer file (&ldquo;c&rdquo;), on an optical disc
(&ldquo;o&rdquo;), multicolored (&ldquo;c&rdquo;), 4 3 4 in. in diameter (&ldquo;g&rdquo;), and includes
sound (&ldquo;a&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: Because &ldquo;smart games&rdquo; and &ldquo;challenge 1&rdquo; appear in different
font sizes, they are transcribed as title proper and other title infor-
mation. A variant title is provided to enable users to find this item
under a similar title.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: Information about Area 4 is found in the file. The distributor&rsquo;s
information is added and encoded in the second subfield b.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: Two notes are provided because the system requirements are
specific to the type of computers. The elements in the source have
to be rearranged to follow the order specified by AACR2R.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: A 500 note is provided for this &ldquo;MAC/PC CD-ROM&rdquo; because
it appears on the disc.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The statement about &ldquo;over 300 games ...&rdquo; appears promi-
nently on three sides of a container. It is presented as a quotation
note to help users identify this item.
</p>
<p>&bull; 521: The intended audience is clearly identified on the container,
so the statement is recorded in this note. The audience group in-
cludes secondary (&ldquo;d&rdquo;) and adult (&ldquo;e&rdquo;), two of the audience groups
listed for the Audn element in the fixed field. Following the OCLC
input standards, the code for the higher level is used for the Audn
element.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The &ldquo;P/N ...&rdquo; number is on the disc and seems important, so it
is presented in a 500 note. If it can be determined that this number
is the publisher&rsquo;s stock number, the information can be presented
in field 037. According to 9.7B, the note for number is one of the
last notes in a record.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650: This is a software of computer games, so form subdivision
--Software is used.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710: The publisher and distributor are traced per 21.1B3.

<p>Discussion for Figure 5.7
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Type&rdquo; and &ldquo;File&rdquo;: This item employs texts and videos to illustrate
the beauty and power of poetry. Users select a poet and are able to
access the poet&rsquo;s reading, the text as performed, the text as published,
and an interview with the poet. Users can play and pause the video
clips as desired. The navigation routes, however, are predetermined
and linear. For this reason the item is cataloged as a computer file.
To reflect the fact that the item contains text data, moving images,
and programs for navigation, the &ldquo;File&rdquo; element is coded &ldquo;m.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; 007: The codes indicate the characteristics of the optical disc,
which is multicolored and has sound.
</p>
<p>&bull; 020: More and more computer files have been assigned ISBN and
the number often can be found on the container, as this one was.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: Ron Mann, the person who developed and directed this project,
appears prominently on the disc label and is therefore recorded in
subfield c of the 245 field and assigned as the main access point
(field 100). The names of the selected poets appear on the table of
content screen, but such information is not recorded in a 500 note
because there are 24 of them. Many people associated with the
technical production of the work are listed on the &ldquo;credits&rdquo; screens
but are not recorded in a note because there are too many of them.
</p>
<p>&bull; 256: &ldquo;Computer data and program&rdquo; is used to indicate that the item
contains data and a program to exploit the data.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: Information on the place of publication and publisher appears
at the end of the credits screens. Copyright information on the
credits screen includes:
</p>
<p>&copy;Text of each poem by its author
</p>
<p>&copy;Motion picture footage, Sphinx Production, 1982, 1992, 1994
</p>
<p>&copy;Software design, The Voyager Company, 1992, 1994
</p>
<p>Since the computer file brought the texts and videos together, the latest
copyright date for the software design is used as the publication date.
</p>
<p>&bull; 300: &ldquo;Computer optical disc&rdquo; indicates the carrier is an optically
encoded disc. The user&rsquo;s guide is included in this field as an
accompanying material.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: Two notes are provided because the system requirements are
specific to the type of computers. The elements in the source have
to be rearranged to follow the order specified by AACR2R.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The note for numbers borne by a file is usually one of the last
notes given.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650: As a collection of literary works, this item is assigned literary
form headings.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710: The publisher is traced per 21.1B3.

<p>&bull; Type, File, GPub: Because this item is mainly textual, Type is
coded &ldquo;a&rdquo; and an 006 field is added to represent the computer as-
pect, with code d in File indicating textual data and code f in GPub
indicating the file is produced by a federal agency.
</p>
<p>&bull; 043: When a geographic name is used in the subject heading, field
043 can be added to indicate the geographic focus of the item. The
seven-character code is taken from the OCLC-MARC geographic
area codes list.
</p>
<p>&bull; 086: The SuDocs number of an item, if known, is presented in
field 086. The &ldquo;0&rdquo; value for the first indicator explains that the
source of the Government Document number is the Superinten-
dent of Documents Classification system.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245 &amp; 246: The title proper is recorded according to the layout of
the information on the disc label. Since an alternative title is found
on the container, a 246 field is used to record that title. Subfield i
specifies the source of the title and subfield a the form of the alter-
native title.
</p>
<p>&bull; 256: The guidelines are mainly textual, so &ldquo;computer text data&rdquo; is used.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The date of publication is derived from the publication
number on the container, so it is bracketed.
</p>
<p>&bull; 490 &amp; 830: LC name authority file confirms this is a series, so the
series title on the item is recorded in field 490, and the authorized
form is entered in 830.
</p>
<p>&bull; 520 &amp; 505: Field 520 summarizes the contents while field 505 lists
the parts of the file. A medical library may find both notes useful,
whereas a public library or an academic library may find field 520
adequate.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710: The issuing agency is traced as per 21.1B3.

<p>&bull; Fixed field, 007: Code g in File indicates computer game. Code e
in Audn is used because &ldquo;ages 13+&rdquo; covers at least two audience
groups listed for the Audn element, and OCLC input standards in-
struct that the higher group should be used to code this element.
Codes in field 007 describe physical characteristics of this item:

<p>&bull; This item contains texts, images, and sound, and links related in-
formation for user exploration. But the navigation paths are linear.
So this item is cataloged as a computer file.
</p>
<p>&bull; File: Code &ldquo;m&rdquo; (combination) is used to indicate that the file includes
several types of files.
</p>
<p>&bull; 090, 092: The LCC number is for this particular museum. The

<p>Discussion for Figure 5.11
</p>
<p>&bull; Chapters 12 (for serials) and Chapter 9 (for computer files) of
AACR2R are consulted for the cataloging of electronic serials.
Since February 1998 the national standards stipulate that
language-based electronic serials be cataloged on serials format
and that field 006 be used to describe the computer aspect of the
file. Field 007 is also used to provide additional details on the
characteristics of a computer file.
</p>
<p>&bull; Fixed field: Code &ldquo;s&rdquo; in BLvs stands for serial; code &ldquo;p&rdquo; in SrTp
(serial type) stands for periodical; code &ldquo;q&rdquo; in Freq refers to quar-
terly publication; and code &ldquo;r&rdquo; in Regl indicates regular publica-
tion. For serials two dates are provided, the beginning date and
ending date of the publication.
</p>
<p>&bull; 006: Code &ldquo;m&rdquo; in T006 indicates computer file, and code &ldquo;m&rdquo; in
File indicates the file contains several file types.
</p>
<p>&bull; 007: The codes specify that the file is on an optical disc (&ldquo;o&rdquo;) with
a diameter of 4 3 4 in. (&ldquo;g&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The description of a serial should be based on the first issue
and the beginning date of publication is recorded in subfield c of
field 260.
</p>
<p>&bull; 310: This field specifies the frequency of the serial.
</p>
<p>&bull; 362: This field records the information about the numerical/
chronological designation of a publication when the first issue is
available.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The source of the title proper is always recorded for computer
files.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650s: Topical headings with subdivision --Periodicals are assigned
to indicate the subject coverage of this serial. LC Subject Cataloging
Manual advises that for electronic serials that are reference-type
of works, the subdivision --Database should not be assigned
(H1580.5). Both LC and NLM have established &ldquo;electronic jour-
nal&rdquo; as a subject heading. But &ldquo;electronic journal&rdquo; is not a form
heading yet.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710: The publisher is traced per 21.1B3.

<p>Interactive Multimedia
</p>
<p>Cataloging rules for computer files have evolved since the publication of
the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules in 1978. While the rules for cataloging
of computer files had stabilized in the late 1980s (notably Chapter 9 of
AACR2R), the inadequacy of these rules in describing interactive multimedia
became obvious. After years of deliberation and discussion, American Library
Association published Guidelines for Bibliographic Description of Interactive
Multimedia to assist catalogers in describing interactive multimedia.1 These
Guidelines supplement the second edition, 1988 revision of the Anglo-American
Cataloguing Rules. Catalogers are to consult Chapter 9 of AACR2R and the
Guidelines when cataloging interactive multimedia. Where the two differ cata-
logers should prefer the 1994 Guidelines.
</p>
<p>Interactive multimedia resources make use of computer technology,
video technology, and sound technology to present a work that combines two or
more media formats (text, images, or sound) and support users&rsquo; nonlinear navi-
gation within the work. The 1994 Guidelines provide a definition of interactive
multimedia and instructions on how to identify the chief and prescribed sources of
information, and information related to areas 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. They stipulate that
an interactive multimedia can reside in one or more physical carriers or be retriev-
able via computer networks. Two characteristics are essential for determining
whether a work is an interactive multimedia. First, it should support &ldquo;user-
controlled, nonlinear navigation&rdquo; (p. 1) by computer technology. Second, the
item should make use of two or more media. Specifically, the guidelines recom-
mend that catalogers consider the following issues:
</p>
<p>1. The use of sophisticated computer technology in the work. The
cataloger needs to determine if a work requires the use of a micro-
computer, a Level III or higher videodisc player, or sophisticated
computer technology, because such technology is required in
interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>2. The level of interactivity. The cataloger can determine the levels
of interactivity built into the work by its designer by reading
documentation and using the work.
</p>
<p>3. The support for nonlinear navigation. Nonlinear navigation refers
to a user&rsquo;s ability to explore the work by hyperlinks or other simi-
lar features and to retrieve information &ldquo;freely or randomly&rdquo; (p. 3).
</p>
<p>171
</p>
<p>SIX � INTERACTIVE
MULTIMEDIA</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The cataloger can obtain this information by reading documen-
tation or descriptive materials for the work or testing the work.
</p>
<p>4. Hardware requirements. System requirements often reveal the
nature of a work. Any requirement for sound boards, video
playback programs (such as QuickTime), a videodisc player, or
a multimedia computer suggests that a work is an interactive
multimedia.
</p>
<p>5. Descriptive phrases. Words such as interactive media, multimedia,
new media, and hypermedia, may suggest an interactive multi-
media work. But the presence of such words should not be taken
literally. The cataloger should always consider if a work contains
the two defining characteristics mentioned above: user-controlled
nonlinear navigation and the use of two or more media.2
</p>
<p>In addition, the Guidelines list several types of material that should not be con-
sidered interactive multimedia. They include &ldquo;textual or graphic applications
software programs ... computer-assisted instruction (CAI), database manage-
ment systems, graphical user interface systems (GUI), children&rsquo;s books which
present text, audio and/or graphics in linear fashion, primarily textual databases
with some graphics or images, and video games employing predetermined soft-
ware paths&rdquo; (p. 4). The Guidelines also warn against treating works that were
published and cataloged separately earlier as a set and regard them as interactive
multimedia. After considering the above issues and reviewing the categories that
should not be considered interactive multimedia, if the cataloger has any doubt
about the nature of a work, it should not be treated as interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>The major challenge in cataloging interactive multimedia is to deter-
mine if a work is indeed interactive multimedia. The Guidelines offer helpful in-
structions, but the application of the rules still requires judgment. It is usually
easy to identify the number of media contained in a work, but the interactive aspect
requires actual interaction with the work. Another difficulty is that sometimes
different parts of a work present the same type of information differently. For in-
stance, &ldquo;Macintosh&rdquo; appears at the head of the title on the disc, but it is &ldquo;Macintosh
version&rdquo; on the container, and &ldquo;Macintosh edition&rdquo; on accompanying material.
The cataloger will need to determine whether these statements are meant to specify
the type of computer required to run the program or to indicate a new edition.
</p>
<p>■MARC FIELDS FOR INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA
MARC Fields for Interactive Multimedia
</p>
<p>The MARC fields commonly used to encode interactive multimedia are
the same as those for computer files. The Type element is almost always coded
&ldquo;m&rdquo; for non-serial interactive multimedia because such works contain more than

<p>Chief Source of Information
</p>
<p>Unlike other media, the chief source of information for interactive
multimedia is the entire work, which according to the Guidelines, includes inter-
nal sources such as title screens or title frames and external sources such as carrier
labels, container, and printed or online accompanying textual materials. Cata-
logers should look for &ldquo;information that applies to the work as a whole and that
includes a collective title&rdquo; (p. 4). If these sources present information in varying
fullness, the source with the most complete information is preferred.
</p>
<p>If these sources do not present the needed information, catalogers
may take information from other published description of the work (this source
is preferred) or other sources such as the publisher&rsquo;s brochures.
</p>
<p>The source of the title proper for an interactive multimedia should always
be recorded in a note (field 500). This practice is consistent with the treatment of
computer files in AACR2R.
</p>
<p>Prescribed Sources of Information
</p>
<p>The prescribed sources of the areas are summarized below:
</p>
<p>245, 250, 260, 4xx (Areas 1, 2, 4, 6) Chief source (the entire
work)
</p>
<p>300, 5xx, 02X (Areas 5, 7, 8) Any source (chief source,
published description,
other sources.)
</p>
<p>Area 1. Title Proper and Statement of Responsibility
(MARC field 245)
</p>
<p>The chief source of information should include a title for the entire
work. When several forms of the title appear in the chief source, the Guidelines
recommend that the fullest title be used as the title proper. If this is not possible,
the cataloger should select as title proper the title that best represents the work.

</p>
<p>The edition statement that applies to the item as a whole is entered in
field 250. If it is not clear whether a statement covers the entire work, it is re-
corded in a note. Because different parts of a multimedia may carry different in-
formation, the Guidelines require that the source of the edition statement be
recorded in a note. Some catalogers have combined the edition source note with
the source note for the title proper.

<p>Area 3. File Characteristics (MARC field 256)
</p>
<p>Currently computer data, computer programs, and computer data and
program(s) can be used in this field. Because interactive multimedia by defini-
tion must includes two or more types of media, &ldquo;computer data and program&rdquo; is
frequently used for this area, even though they are clearly not specific enough
about the nature of the files. ISBD (ER) has listed many more descriptive terms
for file characteristics. If adopted in the next version of the standard cataloging rules,
terms such as computer games will become available for better description.
</p>
<p>Area 4. Publication, Distribution, Etc.
(MARC field 260)
</p>
<p>The place of publication and the name of the publisher should be recorded
according to AACR2R. As for the date information, the Guidelines recommend
the use of the latest date. When the dates of parts of the work appear in a work,
the cataloger should consider all dates as applying to the entire work and use the
latest date in Area 4. The most typical date seen on interactive multimedia is the
copyright date.
</p>
<p>Area 5. Physical Description (MARC field 300)
</p>
<p>300 Number of specific material designation : $b sound,
color, etc. ; $c dimension + $e accompanying material.
</p>
<p>The specific material designations for interactive multimedia depend on the type
of physical carrier used to store the information. Files created with older technology
may have &ldquo;videodisc&rdquo; as the carrier, whereas more recent interactive files tend to
be stored on laser optical disc. Rules 9.5 list several SMDs for computer files.
The Guidelines recommend that &ldquo;disc&rdquo; be used for computer optical disc such as
CD-ROM and &ldquo;disk&rdquo; be used for disks that are magnetically encoded. If a work
is on one physical carrier, the rules for physical description in Part I of AACR2R
(rules x.5 of the appropriate chapters) should be followed.

$e 1 user guide.
</p>
<p>If a work has multiple physical carriers, methods (a) and (b) of rule
1.10C2 of AACR2R should be used. This means the cataloger has two options:
(a) to describe the carriers in one 300 field or (b) to provide a separate statement
for each carrier (repeating the 300 field as necessary). Method (c) of 1.10C2
should not be used.

</p>
<p>The cataloger should keep in mind that interactive multimedia may
be retrievable through computer networks. But for any work that is available
only remotely, no area 5 should be provided. This practice is consistent with the
treatment of remotely accessed computer files in Chapter 9 of AACR2R.

<p>Area 7. Notes
</p>
<p>While notes are optional for interactive multimedia, they are very
important for users to understand the work. The order of the notes is the same as
that specified by Rules 9.7. Catalogers should note that CONSER participants
enter notes in numerical order. Before they make an effort to present the notes in
proper order, catalogers should know how notes are processed by their local online
system to avoid unnecessary frustration. The notes that are commonly provided
for interactive multimedia are discussed below.
</p>
<p>System Requirements (MARC field 538): If a work is on one physical
carrier, one system requirements note is given. This note is one of the most im-
portant ones for interactive multimedia and is often presented first. Following
AACR2R the Guidelines specify the elements and their order as follows:
</p>
<p>the make and model of computer(s) or videodisc player to run the files;
</p>
<p>the memory required;
</p>
<p>the operating system;
</p>
<p>the software requirements (and the programming language);
</p>
<p>the kind and characteristics of any required or recommended peripherals.
</p>
<p>538 System requirements: Macintosh LC II; 4 MB RAM;
System 7.0 or above; 13&rdquo; or larger 256 color
monitor; CD-ROM drive.
</p>
<p>If a work can be played on several systems, a separate note is provided
for the requirements of each system:
</p>
<p>538 System requirements for Macintosh: Mac LC III or
higher (040 recommended); 8 MB RAM; double-
speed CD ROM drive; 13&rdquo; monitor or larger.
</p>
<p>538 System requirements for PC: MPC 386 DX or higher
(486 recommended); 8 MB RAM; double-speed CD
ROM drive; sound card; SVGA monitor.
</p>
<p>If a work is on several physical carriers, the cataloger can record system
requirements for the carriers in one note or list the requirements for each carrier
individually, repeating field 538 as needed.
</p>
<p>538 System requirements: 386 16 Mhz IBM compatible
computer; 4 MB RAM or better; 3.5&rdquo; 1.44 MB floppy
drive and hard disk (3 MB) ; MS-DOS 5.0 or higher ;
Microsoft windows 3.1 ; MCI Laserdisc drivers for
Windows ; printer optional.

computer; 4 MB RAM or better; 3.5&rdquo; 1.44 MB floppy
drive and hard disk (3 MB); MS-DOS 5.0 or higher;
Microsoft windows 3.1; printer optional.
</p>
<p>538 System requirements: MCI Laserdisc drivers for
Windows.
</p>
<p>Mode of Access (MARC field 538): If an interactive multimedia is
only available remotely, this note should be given. The old practice to include
the address of the site that hosts the file has been discontinued.
</p>
<p>538 Mode of access: Internet.
</p>
<p>Languages (MARC field 546): If an item involves more than one
language, that should be noted in field 546 and coordinated with the &ldquo;Lang&rdquo; ele-
ment in the fixed field and field 041.
</p>
<p>Lang: eng
</p>
<p>041 engfre
</p>
<p>546 Text in English and French.
</p>
<p>If special language provision is provided for a particular group, the
information is presented in field 546 also.
</p>
<p>546 Closed-captioned.
</p>
<p>Source of Title Proper (MARC field 500): This is a required note.
</p>
<p>500 Title from title screen.
</p>
<p>500 Title from disc label.
</p>
<p>Variant Titles (MARC field 246): Variations to the title proper, if im-
portant, should be recorded in field 246 so that additional access points can be
provided. Because interactive multimedia usually appear on several carriers and
variant titles can appear in documentation or on container, it is not uncommon
for such files to have several 246 fields.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Statements of Responsibility (MARC fields 500, 511, 518): If the
statement of individuals responsible for the entire work is lengthy, an optional
treatment is to record such a statement in a note. Individuals responsible for only
aspects or parts of the work may be given in a note if the cataloger consider them
important. Performances in motion pictures, videorecordings, and sound record-
ings that are part of the interactive multimedia, if judged to be important by the
cataloger, may be given in the note area. In these instances, fields 511 (for cast)
or 508 (for production credits) should be used.
</p>
<p>508 Programmer, Daniel Beer; producer, Paul Benedetti.
</p>
<p>Edition and History (MARC field 500): If an interactive multimedia
includes materials published before, that information should be given in a note.
The source of the edition statement is always noted. Some catalogers have com-
bined this note with the note for the source of the title proper.

<p>Physical Description (MARC field 500): Important physical details
of the work that are not included in area 5 should be given in a note. Sound char-
acteristics such as stereo can be recorded in a 500 note.
</p>
<p>Summary (MARC field 520): A succinct, unbiased summary of the
content of an interactive multimedia should be prepared unless the rest of the
record provides enough details.
</p>

</p>
<p>180 ■ Interactive Multimedia</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Contents (MARC field 505): If the parts of an interactive multimedia
are individually named, a contents note can be given to present such information.
Catalogers can make the titles searchable by tagging the second indicator 0.
</p>
<p>505 0 History -- Great dreadnoughts -- Famous liners --
U.S. Navy -- British Navy -- Freighters -- WWII -- Great
sailing ships -- Cruise ships.
</p>
<p>Assignment of Access Points
</p>
<p>The Guidelines recommend that catalogers follow rules in Part II of
AACR2R. The main entry for interactive multimedia works tend to be the title
because there are usually many people or bodies involved in the creation. Per-
sons or bodies responsible for the entire content of the work may be assigned the
main entry depending on the number of persons or bodies involved. If there are
more than three persons or bodies involved and the principal responsibility is not
attributed to any one, then title should be the main entry. Added entries should be
assigned according to Rules 21.29 and 21.30 of AACR2R. If a person is responsible
for only parts of the work, and if that responsibility is considered important, an
added entry can be made for that person.
</p>
<p>■ SUBJECT ANALYSIS
Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>Interactive multimedia are treated in the same manner as other materials
when analyzed for subject. Instructions in SCM for the assignment of subject
headings (H180) apply to this type of material. For topical multimedia, appropriate
topical headings are assigned and form subdivision &ldquo;--Interactive multimedia&rdquo;
are used. The form subdivision is usually the last element in a subject heading
string. If a form subdivision is used, it should be used with all topical headings
assigned to a work.
</p>
<p>245 00 History of ships &amp; navies $h [interactive multimedia].
</p>
<p>650 0 Ships $x History $v Interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>650 0 Navies $x History $v Interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>610 10 United States. $b Navy $x History $v Interactive
multimedia.
</p>
<p>Since interactive multimedia are a kind of computer file, the classifica-
tion and shelf arrangement of interactive multimedia are the same as the organi-
zation of computer files. Readers are referred to Chapter Five for a discussion of
the classification and arrangement of computer files.

<p>Discussion for Figure 6.1
</p>
<p>&bull; This item combines texts, images, and sound, and supports random
access to words, phrases, and concepts, so it is cataloged as an
interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>&bull; Type, 007: All interactive multimedia files make use of computer
technology and are recorded on the computer format (code &ldquo;m&rdquo; in
Type). Field 007 describes physical characteristics of this item:
computer file (&ldquo;c&rdquo;), optical disc (&ldquo;o&rdquo;), colored (&ldquo;c&rdquo;), 4 3 4 in. in
diameter (&ldquo;g&rdquo;), and with sound (&ldquo;a&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>&bull; 245 &amp; 246: The title proper is transcribed according to Rule 1.1B1.
Since &ldquo;talking dictionary&rdquo; is more prominent by typography, a
variant title is provided for it. Indicator 3 will produce an added
entry but not a note for this title, indicator 0 explains this title is
part of the title proper.
</p>
<p>&bull; 250: Although the copyrights of several parts of this work are
found in the &ldquo;copyrights&rdquo; page, there is no edition statement that
covers the entire work. So no edition statement is provided.
</p>
<p>&bull; 256: The item contains data files and programs to search them, so
this phrase is used.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: Place of publication is found on the item under &ldquo;readme&rdquo; and
also on the back of the container. SoftKey is a unit within the
Learning Company that produced this file, so it is recorded as the
publisher (see Rule 1.4D2 and examples). Several parts of this
item have their own copyright date, but only the date that covers
the entire work is recorded in subfield c.
</p>
<p>&bull; 300: The number of SMD is recorded in subfield a, sound and color
characteristics in subfield b, dimensions in subfield c, and accompa-
nying materials in subfield e.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: This file can run on two different platforms, so a 538 field is
created for each platform. The requirements are re-arranged to fol-
low the order specified by the Guidelines. The original wording,
&ldquo;18 MB of free hard disk space if the dictionary is to reside on the
hard disk,&rdquo; is revised for this note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The note for the source of the title proper is a required note.
&bull; 520: An objective summary is recorded to indicate the content of
</p>
<p>the file and its features.
&bull; 500: This number appears on the disc label, so it is presented as a
</p>
<p>quotation note. If it is verified to be a stock number, it can be entered
in field 037 (e.g., 037 AMH744CE-CD $b SoftKey International).
</p>
<p>&bull; 650: Subdivision --Interactive multimedia is a form subdivision,
and is coded as subfield v, according to the latest practice.
</p>
<p>&bull; 700:Aname-titleaddedentryisprovidedperRule21.30G1forrelatedwork.
&bull; 710: The corporate body is traced per 21.30E.

<p>Discussion for Figure 6.2
</p>
<p>&bull; This item combines text, images, videos, and sound to present a
reference tool on wine. The parts are carefully linked by hypertext
and users can explore the file at will and access topics randomly
from the search program. So this item is cataloged as an interactive
multimedia.
</p>
<p>&bull; 007: The codes indicate that this is a computer file (&ldquo;c&rdquo;) on an opti-
cal disc (&ldquo;o&rdquo;) that is multicolored (&ldquo;c&rdquo;), 43 4 in. in diameter (&ldquo;g&rdquo;)
and contains sound (&ldquo;a&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>&bull; 245 &amp; 246: Title on the title screen is chosen over the title on the
disc label because it has fuller information. To enable users to
search by the disc label title, it is presented in field 246. Indicator 1
will produce a note explaining the source of this title and an added
entry for this title.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The place of publication is found outside of the chief source,
so it is bracketed. &ldquo;Microsoft Home&rdquo; appears on the disc label and
the user&rsquo;s guide. LC name authority file identifies this as the imprint,
so it is entered in subfield b and traced by field 710.
</p>
<p>&bull; 505: Titles of parts of the work are listed to indicate its contents.
Since these headings are clear in showing the file&rsquo;s contents, no
summary note (field 520) is used.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650: Form subdivision --Interactive multimedia is coded in sub-
field v.
</p>
<p>&bull; 700: As the host of this program, Clarke is traced.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710: The corporate body is traced per 21.1B3.

<p>&bull; 245: The title screen and the disc label essentially present the same
title proper except that a title on the title screen includes the original
creator of the file. Because this phrase is not an integral part of the title
proper, a 246 field is not provided for this alternate form of the title.
</p>
<p>&bull; 250: The edition statement is found on the title screen.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: World Library is listed as the earlier copyright owner of this
work, while SoftKey has the 1997 copyright, so SoftKey is recorded
as the publisher. Information about World Library is included in a
500 note later.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The disc label was chosen as the source of the title proper be-
cause the information there is clearer than that on the title screen.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: A separate note is provided for the source of the edition statement.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: A note is provided to indicate that World Library, Inc. is the
original creator of this product. Such information is usually not in-
cluded but since World Library is prominently presented on the title
screen, it is recorded.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The number appears on the disc label and is recorded because
it can be helpful for identifying the item. If it can be verified to be
the stock number of the publisher, this information can also be pre-
sented in a 037 note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710: World Library, Inc. is traced because it appears on the title
screen and contributes to the creation of this work.

As a result, this item is cataloged as an interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>&bull; 246: The title on the container is prominent and users may search

indicating the source of this title and subfield a the variant title.
Following OCLC input guidelines, the initial article is not recorded

<p>Discussion for Figure 6.5
</p>
<p>&bull; This item contains a database of planet images, text and video to
illustrate NASA&rsquo;s effort in planetary exploration. Files in the data-
base are linked and users can interact with the files as they wish.
This item is therefore cataloged as an interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>&bull; Fixed field: GPub is coded &ldquo;f&rdquo; because this file is produced by a
federal agency. The stated audience group includes several age
groups listed for the &ldquo;Audn&rdquo; element. Following OCLC guidelines,
the highest age group, adult (&ldquo;e&rdquo;), is used to code this element.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: The layout of the information on the disc label suggests that
NASA Planetary Data System is responsible for the creation of
this file. This information is confirmed by a voice introduction of
the file. So this statement is recorded in subfield c of field 245. The
full name of NASA is in smaller font and serves to clarify the
name of the agency, so it is not transcribed here.
</p>
<p>&bull; 246: This information appears on the back cover of the container, so it is
recorded in field 246 in case users search for this item by this title. Sub-
field i indicates the source and subfield a records the alternative title.
</p>
<p>&bull; 250: Version information is on the disc label.
&bull; 260: The file lists the unit for users desiring further information, but
</p>
<p>provides no information on place of publication. Since the place of
publication is uncertain, it is followed by a question mark and bracketed.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: Full information on system requirements is included in the
volinfo.txt file which explains the purpose, scope, and coding
structure of the file.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: Because the source of the title proper and that of the edition
statement are the same, the notes are combined into one.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: &ldquo;Educational CD-ROM&rdquo; appears on the disc label and indi-
cates the purpose of this file, so it is quoted as a note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 516: Information on file formats is found in the volinfo.txt file.
Since this information is not presented elsewhere in the record, it
is recorded in field 516, the field for file characteristics.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The statement of dedication is quoted because it appears
prominently on the disc label. Since this item is not a Festschrift,
no added entry is provided for Dr. William L. Quaide.
</p>
<p>&bull; 521: The audience information is presented in field 521 and used
to code the Audn element in the fixed field.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500s: A technical specification and two numbers appear on the disc
label. Each is presented as a quotation note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650: The volinfo.txt file explains how the data are organized and
encoded in the file; this information makes it clear that this file is a
database. Subdivision --Databases is therefore assigned to the
topical heading, Planets.
</p>
<p>&bull; 710: The unit responsible for this file is traced per 21.1B3. The form
of the agency&rsquo;s name is established according to Rules 24.18 and 24.19.

</p>
<p>&bull; This item contains flight simulation programs, photos, descrip-
tions of military aircrafts, and weapon systems and sound infor-
mation. Navigation paths can be controlled by users. It is therefore
cataloged as an interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245 &amp; 246: In Area 1 each piece of other title information is pre-
ceded by a colon. Because of the layout and the meaning of these
two pieces of other title information, two 246 fields are used to
create added entries. Indicator 3 will produce an added entry, and
indicator 0 explains the title is a part of the title proper. Following
OCLC input guidelines, the initial article is not recorded.
</p>
<p>&bull; 250: Edition statement is found in the user&rsquo;s guide.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: Information about the distributor is taken from a promotion
sheet, so it is entered in brackets.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538s: The file can be played on three types of computers, so three
separate 538 fields are used to record the system-specific requirements.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500s: Both source notes are required for interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>&bull; 650s: Form subdivision --Interactive multimedia is assigned to

<p>Discussion for Figure 6.7
</p>
<p>&bull; This item contains text, images, and video clips. Contents are
linked for nonlinear exploration. It is therefore cataloged as an inter-
active multimedia.
</p>
<p>&bull; 043: When a place name is used in the subject headings, field 043
can be used to indicate the geographic area covered. The seven-
character code is taken from the OCLC-MARC geographic area
codes list.
</p>
<p>&bull; 090 &amp; 092: DS558 is for general works about the involvement of
foreign country in Vietnam conflict. The DDC number is built
from the number for the participation of specific country in the
Vietnam War (959.70433) and the number for the United States
(73).
</p>
<p>&bull; 245: AACR2R stipulates that statement of responsibility be tran-
scribed in the form it appears, so &ldquo;from&rdquo; and &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; are recorded in
the statement of responsibility.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: This item can run on two platforms, so two separate 538
fields are used to record the platform-specific requirements.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: &ldquo;Windows and Macintosh CD-ROM&rdquo; appears prominently
on the disc label and indicates the CD-ROM is designed for both

<p>&bull; 650: The file is about U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Since
LCSH does not have a heading for this subject, two headings are
assigned. Form subdivision --Interactive multimedia is assigned

<p>Discussion for Figure 6.8
</p>
<p>&bull; This item is based on Frantzich&rsquo;s textbook and enhances it with
images, photos, videos, and games. Users can play political games,
test the timelines, and use hypertext links to access information.
Because the file can be explored nonlinearly, this item is cataloged
as an interactive multimedia.
</p>
<p>&bull; 043: When a geographic name is used in the subject heading, field
043 can be added to indicate the geographic focus of the item. The
seven-character code is taken from the &ldquo;USMARC Code List for
Geographic Areas.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; 100: Frantzich appears prominently on the title screen and the re-
lationship between this interactive multimedia and a textbook is
made clear on the title screen as well. So Frantzich is presented as
the main entry heading.
</p>
<p>&bull; 245 &amp; 246: The title on the title screen is fuller than that on the disc
label, so it is transcribed in field 245. The disc label title is pre-
sented in 246, with subfield i indicating the source and subfield a
the alternative title. Indicator 1 will produce a note and an added
entry.
</p>
<p>&bull; 250: The edition statement is taken from the disc label and the
source of this statement is noted in field 500 below.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: Place of publication and date of publication are taken from
the user&rsquo;s manual. Since the chief source for interactive multimedia
is the entire work, no square brackets are needed.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The basis of this interactive multimedia&rsquo;s content is presented
in a quotation note because that is the most efficient way to convey
this information.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: Information about Lunaria appears on the container but the
role of this company is not further explained, so the quotation note
is provided to indicate the involvement of Lunaria, but Lunaria is
not traced.
</p>
<p>&bull; 700: A name-title added entry is provided for a related work (Rule

<p>Internet Resources
</p>
<p>The rapid growth of electronic resources, and Internet resources in particular,
has contributed to libraries&rsquo; change of their operating philosophy from owner-
ship to access. Users are relying more and more on the Internet for their informa-
tion needs. For instance, a study of faculty and students found that 83.2 percent of
the respondents have used the Internet for information related to academic studies
and 73.8 percent have used it for information not related to academic studies.1 In
response, libraries are offering access to Internet resources and actively collecting
resources of value to their communities. An ALA study of academic libraries,
for instance, discovered that 87 percent of respondents from doctorate-granting
institutions have provided access to Internet resources by their home pages.2 A
recent survey showed that 97 percent of large academic libraries and 59 percent
of large public libraries have collected Internet resources.3 The need to organize
Internet resources is a concern to all types of libraries.
</p>
<p>Internet resources are different from prints and other nonprint materials
in a number of ways. They are dynamic and subject to change. In addition, they
can be interactive and can contain multimedia. But the main attraction of Internet
resources is the hyperlink capability that links related resources for presentation.
One major problem of these resources is that they are unstable due to network
traffic or change of file name or location. There are also too many resources of
questionable quality. Because cataloging used to be applied to static objects and
Internet resources have been growing exponentially, many have questioned the
wisdom of cataloging Internet resources4 and information professionals have
continued to search for ways to organize such resources.5 But after the initial
skepticism and much discussion,6 the consensus is that cataloging is a good way
to integrate Internet resources into collections&mdash;as long as the resources have
been carefully evaluated and judged valuable to users. Cataloging rules have been
developed, tested, and revised. Encoding standards have improved to ensure bet-
ter indexing and retrieval of such resources. Major tools needed for cataloging
Internet resources include:

</p>
<p>For subject analysis catalogers should consult the latest Library of Congress
Subject Headings, Library of Congress Classification, and Dewey Decimal
Classification. Library of Congress subject cataloging manuals for subject head-
ings and classification are helpful also.
</p>
<p>But before cataloging begins, a few questions need to be answered.Internet Resources
</p>
<p>1. Which resources should be selected and cataloged? Who should
make the decision? Many libraries catalog resources they subscribe
to, such as electronic journals. In addition, libraries also catalog
items recommended by users and approved by collection devel-
opment librarians; and resources recommended by the staff, includ-
ing bibliographers, subject specialists, collection development
librarians, catalogers, and reference librarians. The evaluation
criteria are similar to those for print resources, with newer criteria
such as network capability and graphic design recommended.7
</p>
<p>2. What should be the unit or the level of analysis? Should an entire
Web site be cataloged or would it be more helpful to catalog in-
dividual Web pages on that site? The answer lies in the nature
of the Web pages and the site and should be based on users&rsquo;
needs. Sometimes it is appropriate to catalog an entire site as a
whole, sometimes it is better to catalog few Web pages on a site.
</p>
<p>204 ■ Internet Resources</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>There are also occasions to use both approaches. Some libraries
follow the &ldquo;two-click&rdquo; rule to make sure users do not need to go
through several levels to get to a page.8
</p>
<p>3. Is the item a monograph or a serial? AACR2R defines a serial
as &ldquo;a publication in any medium issued in successive parts
bearing numeric or chronological designations and intended to
be continued indefinitely&rdquo; (p. 622). Many Internet resources
are not treated as monographs because they are updated frequently,
nor as serials because they do not meet the definition of
AACR2R. Hirons and Graham explained the complex seriality
issue and suggested &ldquo;ongoing publications&rdquo; as a better descrip-
tion of Web resources such as home pages and resources that
are updated continuously.9 Hirons completed a report on seriality
for the Joint Steering Committee for Revision of AACR.10 The
report has important implications for the revision of AACR
and is sure to generate much discussion. The Library of Con-
gress&rsquo;s Draft Interim Guidelines treat ongoing publications as
monographs and apply the rules for loose-leaf publications to
them.11 OCLC follows the same practice and cautions that
while a print publication is cataloged as a serial, its online version
may be treated as a monograph because it is continuously updated.
To help catalogers in determining the nature of resources, OCLC
has identifies several remotely accessed electronic resources as
monographs.12 Because of the importance of this message, the
categories are listed verbatim here:
</p>
<p>&bull; Databases (including directories, A&amp;I services, etc.)
&bull; Electronic discussion groups (e.g., SERIALIST)
&bull; Electronic discussion group digests (e.g., AUTOCAT digest)
&bull; Gopher servers (e.g., LC-MARVEL)
&bull; Online public access catalogs (e.g., OCLC, RLIN)
&bull; Online services (e.g., America Online)
&bull; Web sites (e.g., the CONSER home page)
</p>
<p>4. Should catalogers follow the one record approach or the separate
record approach? Some electronic resources have print coun-
terparts, while others are available online only. For the former
the cataloger has the options of creating a new record for the
electronic version or adding relevant information to the record
for the print form. CONSER allows the single record approach,
but recommends catalogers to create separate records.13 OCLC
also prefers catalogers to follow the separate record approach.14
</p>
<p>Graham and the CONSER Working Group recently completed
a report on these two approaches.15 They explained when the
</p>
<p>Internet Resources ■ 205</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>one-record approach is appropriate and discussed the pros and
cons of both approaches on the basis of factors such as patron
convenience, expense, and maintenance.
</p>
<p>The one-record approach enables libraries to cata-
log resources quickly and make them available to users with
less cost, less staff time, and less record maintenance. It may
also facilitate access by informing patrons of the existence of
several formats of the same item. A major drawback is patrons
may be confused by seeing the print and the electronic versions
represented by the same record. The advantage of the separate-
record approach is that there is less confusion over what a record
represents, but the cost of creating a separate record is inevitable.
A recent survey found that 72 percent of the responding academic
and public libraries have taken the one-record approach,16 per-
haps for economic reasons. Examples of these approaches are
discussed in the section on field 530.
</p>
<p>5. Another issue to consider is how to catalog aggregators that
provide access to many resources. Project Muse, for instance,
provides full-text access to journals published by the Johns
Hopkins University Press. Should a collection-level record be
created? Are item-level records needed? Depending on avail-
able resources and the capabilities of local systems, libraries
may make their own decision.

<p>■MARC FIELDS FOR INTERNET RESOURCES
MARC Fields for Internet Resources
</p>
<p>The MARC fields commonly used to encode ongoing monographs
or serials accessible via the Internet are listed below. Field 006 is required if the
Type element is not coded &ldquo;m.&rdquo; It is also required of electronic serials. Field 007
records additional physical characteristics and is required for all computer files.

</p>
<p>776 _ Additional physical form entry.
</p>
<p>856 _ _ Electronic location and access.
</p>
<p>Step 1: In creating MARC records for Internet resources in OCLC,
first determine the primary characteristic of an item and use that to select a work-
form. Except for language materials (coded &ldquo;a&rdquo; in &ldquo;Type&rdquo;), the &ldquo;Type&rdquo; code
alone will determine which fixed field will be used for coding.
</p>
<p>MARC Fields for Internet Resources ■ 207</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Step 2: If the &ldquo;Type&rdquo; code is &ldquo;a,&rdquo; the cataloger will need to determine
if the item is a monograph or a serial. This will result in the coding of the &ldquo;Blvd&rdquo;
element. For language materials, the codes in &ldquo;Type&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blvd&rdquo; will determine
which fixed field is used for the record. A Web page that is primarily textual, for
instance, will have code &ldquo;a&rdquo; in &ldquo;Type&rdquo; and code &ldquo;m&rdquo; in &ldquo;Blvd&rdquo; (for monograph).
So the 008 field for book will be used for the record. A model for selecting field
008 is presented in Chapter Two (p. 26).
</p>
<p>Step 3: The cataloger then determines if the item has other character-
istics that are not covered by the fixed field and should be represented by one or
more 006 fields. A common example is an electronic journal. Since the new defi-
nition of code &ldquo;m&rdquo; in &ldquo;type of record&rdquo; is much narrower than before according to
Update no. 3 to USMARC, the cataloger will code &ldquo;Type&rdquo; as &ldquo;a&rdquo; (language
material), &ldquo;Blvd&rdquo; as &ldquo;s&rdquo; (serial), and select the serial fixed field for the record.
006 field is added for the computer aspect.
</p>
<p>Step 4: The cataloger determines if the item has other physical char-
acteristics that need to be recorded. If so, field 007, physical characteristics fixed
field, is used.
</p>
<p>File: This element specifies the type of computer file being cata-
loged, and the types cover computer data files and program files. Eleven types
have been identified and encoded. They include numeric data (&ldquo;a&rdquo;), computer
program (&ldquo;b&rdquo;), graphic data (&ldquo;c&rdquo;), text files (&ldquo;d&rdquo;), bibliographic data (&ldquo;e&rdquo;), font
(&ldquo;f&rdquo;), game (&ldquo;g&rdquo;), sound (&ldquo;h&rdquo;), interactive multimedia (&ldquo;i&rdquo;), and online system
or service (&ldquo;j&rdquo;), and a combination of data and programs (&ldquo;m&rdquo;). These types are
more explicit than the file characteristics presented in field 256 and can be incor-
porated into field 256 if appropriate. For instance, if &ldquo;File&rdquo; is coded &ldquo;h&rdquo; for a
sound file, &ldquo;computer sound data&rdquo; can be used in the 256 field.
</p>
<p>Field 006: This field is used when an item has multiple characteris-
tics and when an item is a nontextual serial. As far as Internet resources are con-
cerned, field 006 is mandatory if &ldquo;Type&rdquo; is not coded &ldquo;m&rdquo; and if the item being
cataloged is a serial computer file. This field has 18 character positions for cod-
ing special aspects of the item that cannot be coded in field 008. Field 006 has a
tree structure by which the form of the material (the first element coded) deter-
mines what other data elements are allowed for subsequent character positions.
For instance, if the first element is coded &ldquo;a&rdquo; for monographs, then the data elements
for Books Format 006 are used:
</p>
<p>Books Format 006 Information
</p>
<p>T006: a Ills: Audn: Form: Cont: GPub:

</p>
<p>208 ■ Internet Resources</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>OCLC provides prompts for data input. Field 006 has no indicator values or sub-
field codes, and data elements are identified by their position. In the OCLC sys-
tem brackets are used to present this field. For example, if a Web page is
basically textual, the workform for monograph is used to create a record, and the
&ldquo;Type&rdquo; is coded &ldquo;a.&rdquo; To represent the computer aspect of this item, the cataloger
enters &ldquo;n006 com&rdquo; (without the quotation marks) and presses &lt;F11&gt;, then a
screen for Computer Files Format 006 input will appear:
</p>
<p>Computer Files Format 006 Information
</p>
<p>T006: m Audn: File: u GPub:
</p>
<p>A computer text file will be coded and displayed as: 006 [m d ]
where &ldquo;m&rdquo; represents a computer file and &ldquo;d&rdquo; textual data.
</p>
<p>Field 007: Required for all computer file. Five subfields are used in
OCLC:
</p>
<p>$a = Class of material; code &ldquo;c&rdquo; for computer files
</p>
<p>$b = Specific material designation, including codes for tape
cartridge, magnetic disc, and optical disc. Use &ldquo;r&rdquo; for remote
access files.
</p>
<p>$d = Color
</p>
<p>$e = Dimensions
</p>
<p>$f = Sound.
</p>
<p>If an element applies to the file being cataloged, but the needed information is
not available, code &ldquo;u&rdquo; (unknown) is used. But if an element does not apply to
the file being cataloged, then code &ldquo;n&rdquo; (not applicable) is used. For remote access
files, for instance, $e will be coded &ldquo;n&rdquo;.

<p>Rule 9.0B1 designates the title screen(s) of computer files as the
chief source. For electronic serials, the chief source is the title screen of the first
issue or the earliest available issue. If the title screen is not available, catalogers
may take any formal statements in the publication that provide information on
the title, publisher, and/or designation of the serial. CONSER also recommends
that catalogers consider journal home page, publisher&rsquo;s statement page, volume
contents page, etc. while creating a record.17

<p>The &ldquo;About&rdquo; link is another potential source for a more detailed ex-
planation of the purpose of the Web page and the people and corporation bodies
responsible for its creation. In recent years Web page creators have used meta
tags to include information on author, description, and keywords to make it easier
for search engines to index their pages. In Netscape catalogers can view meta
tags by pulling down the &ldquo;VIEW&rdquo; menu and selecting &ldquo;Page Source.&rdquo; In Internet
Explorer catalogers pull down the &ldquo;VIEW&rdquo; menu and selecting &ldquo;Source&rdquo; to see
the HTML source code. The author information presented in the HTML source
code, however, should be verified at the Web site because it frequently refers to
the person responsible for the markup of a page instead of the contents.
</p>
<p>For example, a meta tag for the CATCMB site presents the following
information: &lt;meta name  =  &ldquo;Author&rdquo; content  =  &ldquo;Bernard A.
Lynch&rdquo;&gt;
</p>
<p>Since this information is not on the title screen and Lynch does not
appear to be responsible for the contents of this site, it is recorded in a note in-
stead of the subfield c of field 245. Libraries vary in their decision to provide an
added entry for a Webmaster. Some consider Webmasters to be editors and trace
them, while others do not because they believe Webmasters do not contribute to
the intellectual contents of a work. The resource is transcribed as:

<p>Some Web pages have titles that include phrases such as &ldquo;Welcome to.&rdquo; Treat-
ment of such phrases varies by library. If information on the Web page indicated
the title proper is the part following the phrase, it is recorded in field 245. The
&ldquo;Welcome to&rdquo; title may be given as a variant title. If a Web page clearly identifies
an author and a Webmaster who was responsible for the markup of the page, the
author information in entered in $c of field 245, and the Webmaster is recorded
in a 500 note. Occasionally the Webmaster information will be included in
places such as the &ldquo;about&rdquo; link or the &ldquo;Developers&rdquo; link. So catalogers will want
to check out those links. The decision to provide added entry for the Webmaster
is a local one.

<p>Area 2. Edition (9.2, MARC field 250)
</p>
<p>AACR2R is liberal in defining the edition statement of computer
files. If a file has any wording indicating the existence of the same information in
different form, it can be interpreted as an edition statement. Olson&rsquo;s guide states
that in case of doubt, a statement can be treated as an edition statement. Edition
statements do not appear very often in Internet resources, however. Catalogers
should look for words such as edition, version, and release as an indication of the
presence of an edition statement. For example, the electronic version of a historical
text is so noted in field 250 because the edition statement appears prominently.

<p>Some resources indicate the version of software needed to read the files. This
should not be interpreted as the edition statement for the files.
</p>
<p>An update statement indicates when a Web resource was last revised.
Libraries vary in their treatment of this information. Some consider it an edition
statement and enter it in field 250, while others use a note for the update state-
ment or add it to the note for title proper source. The objective is to indicate
which version was used for cataloging purposes. A recent practice, recom-
mended by a rule interpretation to Rule 12.7B3 for electronic serials (CSB 79)
and endorsed in the CONSER Cataloging Manual, is to include viewing date in
the source note for title proper. This serves a similar function and seems to be
used by more and more libraries.

</p>
<p>The cataloging community has been sensitive to the importance of edition and a
practice encouraged by AACR2R and OCLC is to create a new bibliographic record
for each new edition. This practice, however, cannot be applied to Internet resources
because such resources undergo continuous changes. The new practice above is
a good compromise.
</p>
<p>Area 3. File Characteristics
(9.3, MARC field 256)
</p>
<p>This field is required for Internet resources. Currently three phrases
are used for this field, including &ldquo;computer data,&rdquo; &ldquo;computer program,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;computer data and program.&rdquo; If more specific information is available, it can be
used with these phrases. For example, &ldquo;computer sound data&rdquo; and &ldquo;computer
text data&rdquo; can be used for files containing a particular type of data. The inade-
quacy of the three phrases listed above is obvious and ISBD (ER) has proposed
an expanded list of terms for file characteristics.
</p>
<p>Description ■ 213</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CONSER guidelines indicate that field 256 is not used with elec-
tronic journal. AACR2R Chapter 12 specifies that for serial Area 3 typically includes
numeric or chronological designation and field 362 is used for this purpose.

</p>
<p>Area 4. Publication, Distribution, Etc. (9.4, MARC field 260)
</p>
<p>All Internet resources are considered published, and the publication
information is recorded in Area 4. Unlike print resources, Internet resources are
not always published by commercial printing houses. Web pages can reside on
the Web server of an organization, a government agency, a company, or an edu-
cational organization. The place of publication is often not readily available, and
any information supplied by the cataloger will need to be presented in square
brackets. If no publisher is clearly named, but there is evidence that the item
emanates from a particular organization, that organization can be considered the
publisher and the location of the organization the place of publication.20
</p>
<p>Assigning a date to Internet resources can be a challenge because
most of these resources are dynamic in nature and many have multiple copyright
dates and update statements. AACR2R is usually followed to select the date of
publication. For static publications that are not expected to change, a closed entry
is used. Many government documents, articles, and conference proceedings
have finite dates and are recorded as such.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Area 5. Physical Description.
Field 300 is not used for Internet resources.
</p>
<p>Area 6. Series (MARC fields 4XX):
Series title information is similar to that for print resources.
</p>
<p>Area 7. Notes.
</p>
<p>Area 7 is one of the most important areas for Internet resources because
catalogers tend to use notes to provide a detailed description of such resources.
The notes may include description of the resource or information on a resource&rsquo;s
creation, content, location, its relationship with other resources, the system required
to access it, and many other characteristics. Field 500 is used for many of these
purposes. AACR2R stipulates that the notes are to be presented in the order specified
under 9.7, but AACR2R also allows notes that are most important to users to be entered
first. The AACR2R order of notes follows the order of the eight areas for biblio-
graphic description. CONSER, however, instructs catalogers to enter notes in the
order of the tag number. Local systems may rearrange the order of the notes, and
catalogers should be aware of how their local system processes their notes.
</p>
<p>Notes that are common to Internet resources include:
9.7B1a. Scope and Nature of the File (MARC field 516). Information
</p>
<p>such as type of file, format, or genre of a remote access computer file is recorded
in field 516, if it is not clear from the rest of the record. Information on multiple
formats is also recorded in field 516.
</p>
<p>516 Text in PDF and images in JPEG format.
</p>
<p>516 Numeric (statistics)
</p>
<p>516 Electronic journal articles available in HTML format;
selected articles available in PDF format.
</p>
<p>516 PDF, PostScript, and TIFF formats available for printing .
</p>
<p>For serials, serial frequency is recorded (Rule 12.7B1) in filed 310.
</p>
<p>310 Updated daily.
</p>
<p>310 Quarterly
</p>
<p>9.7B1b. System Requirements (MARC field 538): For resources accessed
remotely, this note indicates the program(s) and/or other devices needed to access
the resources.

</p>
<p>9.7B1c. Mode of access (MARC field 538): A required note to indicate
how the file can be accessed. Field 856 provides the address of the file, so this note
in field 538 is usually brief. The old practice to enter host address is discontinued.
</p>
<p>538 Mode of access: World Wide Web.
</p>
<p>538 Mode of access: FTP and Gopher via the Internet.

coordinated with the &ldquo;Lang&rdquo; element in the fixed field and with the 041 field.
</p>
<p>546 Text in English and German.
</p>
<p>9.7B3. Source of Title Proper (MARC field 500): This is a required
note. Typically sources of title proper are title screen, main menu, &ldquo;readme&rdquo; file,
&ldquo;about&rdquo; link, HTML header or HTML source code, TEI header, and others. A recent
practice is to add the last viewing date to this note to inform users which version
of the file was used to create the bibliographic record.

the author information is not included in Area 1 because the information is not
on the title screen, it is recorded in a 500 field to justify the selection of access
points. Information on sponsors is entered in field 536.
</p>
<p>500 Authors: Lou Bernard and Richard Light.

<p>9.7B7. Edition and History (MARC field 500): AACR2R stipulates
that if the source of the edition statement is different from that of the title proper,
a note should be provided. In addition, Information about the edition and its his-
tory, if important, can be presented in a 500 note.

&ldquo;Audience:&rdquo; will display before the note if the first indicator is blank. Rating infor-
mation is also entered in field 521. If indicator 8 is used, no print constant will be
displayed. Catalogers should not impose personal judgment on the intellectual

<p>If a record for a print publication exists and an online version becomes available,
the cataloger has two choices:
</p>
<p>218 ■ Internet Resources</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1. Single record approach:
</p>
<p>a. Add a 530 field to the print record to indicate the availability
of the online version.
</p>
<p>b. Add a 856 field to indicate the location of the online version.
</p>
<p>c. Add a 740 field if the title of the online version differs
from that of the print version.
</p>
<p>d. Optionally, a computer file 007 field may be added for the
online version.
</p>
<p>245 00 Management of digital resources.
</p>
<p>530 Also available in online version.
</p>
<p>856 41 $u http://www.mdr.com/
</p>
<p>[Explanation: The second indicator (&ldquo;1&rdquo;) of 856 indicates
the URL is for an electronic version of the item (the print
one) represented by the record.]
</p>
<p>2. Separate record approach:
</p>
<p>a. Create one record for the online version.
</p>
<p>b. To the online record add a 530 field to indicate the avail-
ability of the print version and a 776 field to link to the record
of the print version.
</p>
<p>c. To the print record add a 530 field to indicate the availability
of the online version, a 776 field to link to the online version,
and an 856 field to indicate the location of the online version.
</p>
<p>d. Add a 730 field if the title of the online version differs from
that of the print version.

</p>
<p>9.7B17. Summary (MARC field 520): This note describes the purpose
and/or contents of an item and may serve to provide linkage to related resources.
The statement should be concise and objective. To create a formal note, the first
indicator is &ldquo;blank&rdquo; and a display constant &ldquo;Summary:&rdquo; will be displayed. If an
informal note is desired, value &ldquo;8&rdquo; is used for the first indicator. When an item has
a clear statement of its objectives, it is acceptable to create a quote note with it.

<p>9.7B18. Contents (MARC field 505): This note complements the
summary note. It informs users of the contents of a resource by listing the main
headings from a Web page. The first indicator value &ldquo;0&rdquo; will produce a display
constant &ldquo;Contents:&rdquo;.

<p>9.7B20. Restrictions on Access (MARC fields 506 and 590): This
note specifies how access to the file is restricted.
</p>
<p>506 Restrictions on access: Site subscription required.
</p>
<p>506 Some files restricted to CUA users only.
</p>
<p>Information on local access is recorded in field 590.
</p>
<p>590 Electronic access sponsored by VIVA, the Virtual
Library of Virginia.
</p>
<p>Electronic Location and Access (MARC field 856): This field was
developed to provide the address of a file that is accessed remotely. Many sub-
fields are allowed, and there is no prescribed order for entering the subfields.
The first indicator specifies the access method (gopher, ftp, telnet, http, etc.),
while the second indicator indicates the relationship between the file listed in
field 856 and the item represented by the bibliographic record. In 1998 MARBI
(Machine-Readable Bibliographic Information) approved changes to field 856
by adding a new value (&ldquo;4&rdquo; = http) for the first indicator. OCLC began imple-
menting these changes on March 16, 1998. LC will implement these changes in
the future. 21
</p>
<p>If the file listed in field 856 and the item represented by the record are
the same, which is usually the case when the item is an electronic resource, the
second indicator value &ldquo;0&rdquo; is assigned. Subfield u presents the Uniform Resource
Locator in a standard syntax and can be repeated if necessary.

<p>856 40 $u http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/856guide.html
</p>
<p>But when the file listed in field 856 is a part of the item represented by
the record, the second indicator value is blank and a subfield 3 is used to record infor-
mation about the part. This method is used most often when we have a collection -
level record and field 856 is used to list the constituent parts of the collection.
</p>
<p>A common situation is mirror sites. Sites that are considered of interest
to global audience tend to be mirrored in various countries. Catalogers will need to
verify the contents of the mirror sites before recording the URLs of those sites. These
URLs are recorded to provide users alternate access to the same information.

<p>Internet resources can also be accessed by gopher, FTP, telnet, e-mail,
and other methods. These methods can all be recorded in field 856. Details of the
subfield codes can be found at the MARC21 site and the OCLC input standards
site. Typical subfields for e-mail, ftp, telnet, and http are included below to illus-
trate the use of field 856.
</p>
<p>E-mail: An e-mail message is sent to a processor at a host site and an
instruction is usually included for the host to process the request. To send an e-mail
request, users need to know the host site (subfield a), the processor (subfield h),
and the instruction for the processor (subfield i).

</p>
<p>[This note instructs users to subscribe to the DIGLIB discussion
group by sending a message &ldquo;subscribe DIGLIB your name&rdquo; to
listserv@infoserv.nlc-bnc.ca. Subfield z is a public message to be
displayed, subfield h lists the part appearing before the @ sign,
and subfield a lists the host name, the part appearing after the @
sign. Subfield i contains the command for the processor. There is
no prescribed order for entering the subfields.]
</p>
<p>FTP: Information at FTP sites is stored in files and in directories. To
access such information users need to know the host of an FTP site (subfield a),
the directory name (subfield d), and the file name (subfield f). If information
about password and logon is needed for access, subfield k is used for password
and subfield l for logon instruction.

<p>Subfield u is designed for the uniform resource locator, which has a
standard syntax for locating Internet resources using existing Internet protocols.
Catalogers may use subfield u instead of several subfields to represent the address
of an item. For instance, the next two 856 fields represent the same FTP file:
</p>
<p>856 10 ftp.sunet.se $d /pub/music/pictures/Beatles/ $f

<p>Special characters: URLs sometimes include special characters
such as the underscore (_) and the tilde (~). Because some local online catalogs
cannot recognize these characters, the current practice is to enter the hexadecimal
value of these characters preceded by a percent sign. Use %5F for spacing under-
score and %7E for spacing tilde. For example: http://www.oneday.com/~travel/
should be entered as http://www.oneday.com/%7Etravel/.

<p>Remote Access Electronic Serials
</p>
<p>The CONSER Cataloging Manual provides the most authoritative
guidance for the cataloging of electronic serials.25 There are in fact more similarities
than differences between the cataloging of print serials and that of electronic
serials. Several steps are similar. For example, the chief source is the title screen(s)
of the first issue or the earliest available issue. The numerical/chronological
</p>
<p>Description ■ 223</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>designation of the first issue is recorded, and if the first issue is not available, a
note &ldquo;Description based on:&rdquo; should be entered in field 500. The frequency of the
serial is recorded if known.
</p>
<p>In addition, following CONSER practice, notes in records for regular
serials and electronic serials are arranged in numerical order.
</p>
<p>Importance differences between print and electronic serial records
include:
</p>
<p>1. The 006 field is required of all records for electronic serials.
For a language-based electronic serial, the serials format is
used for the record and a 006 field is added to cover the com-
puter file characteristics. For a non-language-based electronic
serial, the primary characteristic (sound or computer file, for
example) decides the fixed field format for the record, and a
006 field is added to indicate the serial aspects of the item.
(This is the result of a new definition of &ldquo;type of record&rdquo; code
&ldquo;m,&rdquo; which was implemented in early 1998 and has a narrower
scope for code &ldquo;m&rdquo;.)
</p>
<p>2. The source of the title proper of a remote access electronic
serial is always presented in a 500 note, with the last viewing
date included in parentheses.
</p>
<p>3. A uniform title qualified by the physical medium is used when
the electronic version and its counterpart in another format
have the same title.
</p>
<p>4. A 516 field is used to record the formats in which the file is
available (e.g., PDF format and ASCII format).
</p>
<p>5. A 530 field is used to indicate the availability of the serial in
other forms.
</p>
<p>6. A 538 field is used to indicate mode of access.
</p>
<p>7. 856 field or fields is used to indicate access method(s).
</p>
<p>Two records are included here to illustrate some of these similarities
and differences:

</p>
<p>Fixed field, 006, 007
</p>
<p>&bull; This record reflects the current practice of using the serials format
for electronic serial (coded &ldquo;s&rdquo; in BLvl). Several fixed field ele-
ments are unique to this format, including S/L (successive/latest
entry, code 0 for successive entry), SrTp (serial type, code p for
periodical), Freq (frequency, code q for quarterly), Regl (regularity
of the serial, code r for regular), DtSt (publication status, code c
for current, and ISSN (International Standard Serial Number, code
1 for presence of an ISSN). The Dates element usually includes the
beginning date and closing date of a serial. A 006 field is used to
indicate the computer file characteristics, with code m represent-
ing a computer file, code d textual data. A 007 field is required for
computer files, and the codes identify this item as a computer file
(code c) that is accessed remotely (code r), multicolored (code c), and
no dimensional elements apply (code n).
</p>
<p>Variable fields
</p>
<p>&bull; 130: The uniform title is the print title qualified by the physical
medium. It serves to tell the two titles apart.
</p>
<p>&bull; 310 &amp; 362: Frequency note and the note for numerical designation
are the same for print and electronic serials.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The source of title for a remote access electronic serial is always
recorded and the last viewing date included.
</p>
<p>&bull; 516: This field records the type, file, or format of a title.
</p>
<p>&bull; 530: This field indicates the existence of a print version.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538s: A system requirement note and a mode of access note are
common to remote electronic serials.
</p>
<p>&bull; 776: This note links this title to the print title, and the ISSN of the
print title is included.
</p>
<p>&bull; 856: The note records the location of the item, with the indicator 4
identifying http as the access method, and the indicator 0 indicating
that the file at this location is the one represented by the bibliographic
record.

<p>Explanation
</p>
<p>Fixed field, 006, 007
</p>
<p>&bull; This record reflects the current practice of using the serials format
for electronic serial (coded &ldquo;s&rdquo; in BLvl). Several fixed field ele-
ments are unique to this format, including S/L (successive/latest
entry, code 0 for successive entry), SrTp (serial type, code p for
periodical), Freq (frequency, code b for every two months), Regl
(regularity of the serial, code r for regular), DtSt (publication
status, code c for current, and ISSN (International Standard Serial
Number, code 1 for presence of an ISSN). The Dates element usually
includes the beginning date and closing date of a serial. A 006
field is used to indicate the computer file characteristics, with code
m representing a computer file, code d textual data. A 007 field is
required for computer files, and the codes identify this item as a
computer file (code c) that is accessed remotely (code r), multicolored
(code c), and no dimensional elements apply (code n).
</p>
<p>Variable fields
</p>
<p>&bull; 037: Like print serial records, this field replaces field 265 for the
recording of subscription address of a publisher.
</p>
<p>&bull; 362: The numerical designation of the first online issue is recorded,
with the chronological designation in parentheses, and an open entry
is used in subfield c of field 260. Because this title continues a print
publication, the volume number does not begin with number one.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The source of title for Internet resources is a required note
that is presented in field 500 and the last viewing date is included
in parentheses.
</p>
<p>&bull; 516: This note records the nature of this publication and its file
characteristics.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538: A required note for all Internet resources.
</p>
<p>&bull; 610 &amp; 650s: Because the serial covers activities of the Association
as well as subjects of interest to its members, subject access is pro-
vided through the corporate body and the topics. A form heading,
&ldquo;periodicals&rdquo; (coded subfield v), is assigned to all subject access
points.
</p>
<p>228 ■ Internet Resources</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; 780: The immediate predecessor of this title is recorded to link related
titles together. The ISSN, LC Card number, and OCLC number of
the predecessor are included in appropriate subfields.
</p>
<p>&bull; 856: The note records the location of the item, with indicator 4
identifying http as the access method, and the indicator 0 indicating
that the file at this location is the one represented by the bibliographic
record.
</p>
<p>Assignment of Access Points
</p>
<p>Rules for the selection of access points apply to print and electronic
resources alike. Personal names, corporate bodies, and titles can serve as main
entries if the criteria are met. Web pages created by individuals often have their
creators as the main entry, and compilers of subject guides are considered
authors. Resources issued or hosted by a corporate body that belongs to one of
the six categories enumerated in Rule 21.1B2 will have the corporate body as the
main entry. Title becomes the main entry when authorship is diffuse or unknown,
when a work is under editorial direction, when a work is the sacred scripture of a
religious group, or when a work is issued by a corporate body but the corporate
body is not the main entry. Uniform title is selected as the main entry when it is
necessary to bring together various manifestations of a work. According to
LCRI 25.5B, a computer file serial that is also published in another format is not
considered a reproduction, so a uniform title qualified by the medium should be
used to describe the item. CONSER indicates the term &ldquo;online&rdquo; may be sufficient
to distinguish the electronic version from the other version.22

</p>
<p>130 0 Journal of child psychology (Online)
</p>
<p>245 00 Journal of child psychology $h [computer file]
</p>
<p>Rules 21.29 and 21.30 guide the selection of added entries. Individuals
or corporate bodies that are named prominently and contribute to the creation,
publication, and access to a remote access serial can be selected as added entries.
Webmasters or Web page creators, for example, can be added entries if their
contribution is significant. This information is often found in an &ldquo;about this
page&rdquo; link or similar links. Some Webmasters include their name in the meta tag
as &ldquo;author&rdquo; (meaning author of the Web page), which should not be interpreted
</p>
<p>Description ■ 229</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>as the person responsible for the intellectual content of the work. The corporate
body that hosts a Web page is often made an added entry. Title is usually an
added entry when it is not the main entry. In addition, added entries are made for
related works. For instance, if a work is the electronic version of a print publication,
besides indicating that in a note, the cataloger will want to provide an added entry
for the original work. If a personal author is known, it will be a 700 entry; if the
item has a title main entry, a 730 entry will be used. Analytical added entries can
also be made.

<p>■ SUBJECT ANALYSIS
Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>In assigning subject headings catalogers should treat Internet resources
the same as other types of material. Principles regarding the specificity and the
number of heading to be assigned also apply to Internet resources (see SCM
H180). Subject information of these resources can often be learned from the title,
subtitle, table of contents, &ldquo;about&rdquo; link, hyperlinks, and the metadata in the
source code. Regardless of how resources are accessed (by gopher or by FTP, for
instance), the same headings should be assigned to resources on the same sub-
ject. It should be noted that subdivision &ldquo;--Computer network resources&rdquo; is not a
form subdivision and should not be assigned automatically to indicate that an
item is an electronic resource. It is often used under a topical heading for a col-
lection of electronic resources on a topic. Library of Congress does not have a
form subdivision such as &ldquo;electronic resources&rdquo; to describe Internet resources,
but it has &ldquo;electronic journals&rdquo; now for remote access computer file serials.
</p>
<p>The decision to classify Internet resources was controversial because
classification numbers tend to be associated with the location of a work. Since
libraries do not physically own Internet resources, some catalogers were reluc-
tant to classify them. But many catalogers and researchers have pointed out the
importance of classification for browsing and searching, and the benefit for col-
lection development and management.23 The DESIRE project analyzed several
classification schemes for their retrieval power and concluded that classification
could be an efficient way for searching electronic resources.24
</p>
<p>230 ■ Internet Resources</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The classification of Internet resources is the same as that of other
resources. After the cataloger determines the main thrust of a work, the most
specific number is assigned, including building a number that is not listed in the
selected classification schedule. Many libraries add &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; to their call num-
bers to alert users that these resources are not on site, while others list &ldquo;Internet&rdquo;
in their location field for it to be displayed right next to the call number. Some
have used terms such as electronic journal, Web site, and Online U.S. document
to sort search results.

</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The University appears in Area 1, so it is referred to as &ldquo;The

entry is used.
</p>
<p>&bull; 506: Information about restriction of access is entered in field 506.
The emulation information is included here because it is related to
the information in this note. An alternative place for the emulation
information is field 538.
</p>
<p>&bull; 520 &amp; 505: Sometimes it is appropriate to include a summary and
a detailed contents note.
</p>
<p>&bull; 856s: The first 856 is for the main site, so the second indicator is
&ldquo;0.&rdquo; Indicator &ldquo;1&rdquo; refers to a version of the item represented by the
bibliographic record and is used to indicate mirror sites.

<p>Discussion for Figure 7.4
</p>
<p>&bull; Type, 006, 007: This site includes several types of data, but text is
the predominant type, so Type is coded &ldquo;a&rdquo; for language material.
Field 006 is added to represent the computer aspect, and code d in
File indicates the site is mainly textual. Field 007 describes the
physical characteristics of the file: computer file, remote access,
multicolored, and dimensions not applicable.
</p>
<p>&bull; 100 &amp; 245: The authors are prominently listed in the chief source,
so the first author is selected as the main entry.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: The place of publication is taken outside of the page, so it is
entered in square brackets. An open entry is used because this is an
ongoing publication.
</p>
<p>&bull; 516: This note makes explicit the nature of information on this
site.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: Webmaster information is from the &ldquo;developers&rdquo; link. The
description there indicates his role is important, so an added entry
is made for this person.
</p>
<p>&bull; 536: Funding information is entered in 536 this note also explains
why an added entry is made for this corporate body.
</p>
<p>&bull; 505: Contents note lists titles of parts of a work. Only the main
headings are included.
</p>
<p>&bull; 700s: The co-author and the Webmaster are traced for their contri-
bution to this item.

</p>
<p>&bull; 245 &amp; 246: The corporate body is transcribed as part of the title
proper, but a variant title is provided for the portion following the
corporate body to make it searchable. Indicator 3 specifies that no
note will be produced, but an added entry will be made for the
variant title. Indicator 0 indicates the variant title is portion of the
title proper. For the second 246 field the second indicator is blank
because there is no appropriate code to indicate it is the same title
with the acronym spelled out.
</p>
<p>&bull; 256: The resources at this site include text files and conversion
programs, so a statement is presented to specify the characteristics
of these files.
</p>
<p>&bull; 260: Since this resource is an ongoing publication, an open entry is
used.
</p>
<p>&bull; 270: Contact information is entered in field 270; subfield m is for
email address.
</p>
<p>&bull; 500: The note for the last update is optional. Some libraries have
treated such information as an edition statement, while others have
presented it as a quotation note. The purpose is to indicate which
version of the Web page was used to create the bibliographic record.
If a library adds the date a page was last viewed to the record, this
note may not be as useful or necessary.

<p>Discussion for Figure 7.6
</p>
<p>&bull; Type, 006, 007: This site is predominant textual, so Type is coded
&ldquo;a&rdquo; for language material. Field 006 is added to represent the com-
puter aspect, and code d in File indicates the site is mainly textual.
Field 007 describes the physical characteristics of the file: com-
puter file, remote access, multicolored, and dimensions not
applicable.
</p>
<p>&bull; 043: When a subject has a geographic focus, field 043 can be
added. The code is taken from the OCLC-MARC geographic area
codes list.
</p>
<p>&bull; 246: The first indicator (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) specifies that no note will be pro-
duced but an added entry will be made for the variant title. This is
necessary because a note with the author&rsquo;s name is presented as a
500 note later. The second indicator is blank because there is no
appropriate code to indicate this type of variant title.
</p>
<p>&bull; 256: The file number and the bytes information are readily avail-
able, so they are recorded in Area 3.
</p>
<p>&bull; 538s: The first 538 specifies the machinery needed to access the
file, and the second explains how to access file. Detailed instruc-
tions are provided in case users prefer to retrieve the files this way.
The URLs in the 856 fields provide easier access.
</p>
<p>&bull; 530: This note indicates the availability of the file in other formats.
</p>
<p>&bull; 856s: The file can be accessed in two ways, so two 856 fields are
provided.

<p>&bull; 856s: Two 856 fields are used to record the two access methods.
The gopher one is simpler, with the first indicator blank because
there is no specific indicator value assigned for gopher access. The
second indicator shows the file represented by this 856 field is the
one represented by the bibliographic record. The URL of the file is
presented in subfield u. Information for e-mail access is more
complex. The first indicator &ldquo;0&rdquo; names e-mail as the access
method, $z presents the information for public display, $f is the
file name, $h is the processor for the request and usually precedes
the at sign in the host address, and $i is the instruction for the remote
host to process a request. There is no prescribed order for entering
subfields in field 856.

<p>8&mdash;Cataloging and the Changing Information EnvironmentCataloging and the Changing Information Environment
</p>
<p>Advances in information technology have affected creators, publishers, and
users of information in many ways in the 1990s. In response to such changes, in-
formation professionals have explored several options for organizing electronic
resources. These topics are presented in this chapter to provide a context for a
discussion of the future of cataloging and that of catalogers.
</p>
<p>■CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION
ENVIRONMENT
</p>
<p>Changes in the Information Environment
</p>
<p>Scholarly Communication
</p>
<p>A large part of the information transfer cycle described in Chapter Two
continues to apply in the current information environment, but advanced tech-
nology has shortened the distance between the stages. For instance, creators of infor-
mation previously had to go through an elaborate review and quality control process
to publish their works. Now the time between creation and publication is shorter
because electronic submission is commonplace, the review cycle is shorter (again
due to electronic communication), and electronic editing and production are faster
than before. In addition, peer-reviewed e-journals grew from seven titles in 1991
to 1,049 in 19971 and researchers now have more channels for publications.
</p>
<p>Moreover, Web technology affects the information creation stage
because it enables people to communicate through new formal and informal
channels. Creators can receive and exchange ideas through e-mail, chat rooms,
newsgroups, and listservs, and thus benefit from online discussions as well as
completed reports. They can also publish as much as they wish informally be-
cause anyone with a Web address is a potential author. Such a free flow of infor-
mation and the new ease of publishing created the rapid growth of information
on the Web, but exacts a toll on receivers&rsquo; time and energy. The quantity and the
quality of Web information are such that information users find it difficult to
search for relevant quality resources or to digest or manage received informa-
tion. That&rsquo;s why David Shenk calls for ways to ensure the quality of information2
</p>
<p>and Paul Waddington reports an urgent need for better information organization
and management in the business world.3
</p>
<p>Furthermore, technology has empowered creators by making it easier
for them to communicate by means other than text. Books accompanied by CD-
</p>

THE CHANGING
INFORMATION
ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ROMs, sound recordings with &ldquo;Enhanced CD,&rdquo; and Web sites enriched with
sound, video, and images illustrate how creators and publishers have combined
formats into new forms of intellectual expression. The emergence of multimedia-
embedded electronic journals on the Internet suggests that scholarly communi-
cation has entered a new phase. Humanities scholars have recognized that infor-
mation technology presents new opportunities for research in their fields and
many have actively experimented with integrating sound, image, text, and other
media into their work.4 And the growth of electronic information centers and
digital libraries is also likely to stimulate scholars&rsquo; interest in combining multiple
formats for research presentation.5
</p>
<p>The implications of these changes for catalogers are twofold. First,
the increasing volume of Web resources highlights the importance of the selection
and evaluation of information. Assessing the accuracy, authority, objectivity,
and currency of electronic resources, especially those on the Web, will continue
to be challenging and time-consuming. But this filtering effort by information
organizers will save users from fruitless searching on the Web and elsewhere,
especially when the filtering is performed with a solid understanding of the
needs of a user community. Evaluation criteria for print resources have been
expanded to cover electronic resources,6 and new techniques such as collaborative
filtering can alert users of resources used by other users with similar interest.7
</p>
<p>Second, the amount of information available and the multiple for-
mats in publications will challenge catalogers to describe file formats adequately
and efficiently. Catalogers will need some knowledge of file formats to deter-
mine if additional equipment or software is required to run a work that consists
of several media. In addition, new ways to organize electronic resources need to
be explored. Project Aristotlesm, for instance, lists Web sites that experiment with
automated categorization or organization of Web resources.8 It is also necessary
to examine the information creation stage and information organization stage.
The University of Virginia, for instance, has established a procedure to generate
bibliographic records from information submitted by thesis authors.9
</p>
<p>Information Users
</p>
<p>The large amount of information available challenges information
seekers and heightens the need for information organization. Recent studies
found that not one single search engine can perform a complete search of the
Internet and that search engines retrieve many overlapped items and some
unique items.10 A 1998 university survey found that more than 86 percent of students
and faculty spent 11 minutes to more than 30 minutes on searching in order to
find satisfactory results on the Internet.11 Although users learn to live with the
limitations of existing engines, the need for a powerful search tool is apparent.
The catalog adds value to collected resources by saving users&rsquo; time and effort in
searching and evaluating resources. Such value-adding processes can certainly
be extended to electronic resources.
</p>
<p>256 ■ Cataloging and the Changing Information Environment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Web technology also enables any users with an Internet connection
to access a library&rsquo;s catalog. So the diverse background of users, their location,
their purposes, and their information-seeking behavior all need to be taken into
account when catalogers decide which data elements to include in bibliographic
records. For instance, to serve remote users of the catalog well, catalogers would
include technical information or requirements specific to a resource so that off-
site users would know if they have the necessary setup to use the resource. In ad-
dition, more and more users expect information tools to provide not only biblio-
graphic access but also physical access through virtual display of the actual
contents. So the catalog needs to support that need as well.
</p>
<p>The implications for catalogers are that they must have an efficient
way to produce resource descriptions that can assist users in searching, identifying,
selecting, and accessing resources.12 In addition to traditional cataloging elements,
field 856, the field for electronic location and access, has supported access by
linking bibliographic records to Web resources. Efficient resource description,
however, remains a challenge. MARCit, a commercial software, offers a cata-
loging template for quick description of Web resources,13 but still requires much
human effort. The OCLC CORC Project tests the extent to which a cooperative
catalog for Web resources can be created through machine harvesting and analysis
of resources.14
</p>
<p>A related issue is that many tools have been available in the net-
worked environment for users to find and manage information&mdash;search engines,
databases, online catalogs, e-mail services, and database management systems,
to name a few. As libraries make the online catalog the hub for information dis-
covery, it is important that the catalog be compatible with other tools so that it
can provide maximum support for users. Many online catalogs can display in
several formats (MARC, ASCII, HTML, etc.), offer users several options for
saving and processing their search results, and link users to resources accessible
on the World Wide Web. These are all steps in the right direction.
</p>
<p>Publishing
</p>
<p>Advanced technology has prompted publishers to move more and
more print resources into electronic format. The latest international periodical
directory reports that 10,332 serial titles are available exclusively online or in
addition to a paper version.15 A recent library marketing survey found that many
libraries anticipate a substantial part of their budget increase to be spent on elec-
tronic media, and publishers also expect libraries to focus more on electronic
media.16 While publishers are concerned about authentication and rights man-
agement17 and new technological standards for electronic resources and audio-
visual materials are in development, the implication for catalogers is that more
nonprint resources produced according to new standards and in varying pack-
ages will need to be organized. In addition to describing rights restrictions and
system requirements of electronic resources, catalogers must decide how to catalog
</p>
<p>Changes in the Information Environment ■ 257</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>an aggregator such as IDEAL (International Digital Electronic Access Library)
from the Academic Press that includes the full-text of 175 journals. Would
collection-level records for such items be sufficient? Would item-level records
be necessary? How many item-level records should be provided? And how
should the item-to-item relationship and the item-to-collection relationships be
represented?
</p>
<p>Similarly, more and more libraries and institutions are developing
their own digital collections. Besides the same decisions about record level and
relationship, the issue of encoding local collections for display and retrieval
must be addressed. Catalogers will need to decide if they will assume the responsi-
bility for encoding objects or to form an alliance with staff specialized in encod-
ing to streamline the cataloging of digitized materials.
</p>
<p>■RESPONSES FROM THE
LIBRARY COMMUNITY
</p>
<p>Responses from the Library Community
</p>
<p>Practical Solutions
</p>
<p>The library community has responded to such changes in a number
of ways. Individually many libraries have mounted subject guides, most of them
well organized and with annotations, to present resources they have selected for
their users. This process adds value to the resources by reducing users&rsquo; searching
time. To compensate for the fixed order, linear structure of most subject guides,
librarians have combined database design and Web technology. Cornell University&rsquo;s
gateway (http://campusgw.library.cornell.edu/gateway.html), for instance, allows
users to search keywords against resource types to generate a list of information
tools for further exploration. Similar services are provided by Virginia Military
Institute&rsquo;s SourceFinder (http://www.vmi.edu/sourcefinder/) and at Dickinson
College (http://library.dickinson.edu/db_index.html). This approach simplifies the
maintenance of links to electronic resources and allows users to customize subject
guides as needed. Another method to keep subject guides current and dynamic is to
embed search statements in them and run the search statements against a data-
base whenever subject guides are viewed. The Pathfinder module of OCLC&rsquo;s CORC
Project (Cooperative Online Resource Catalog) offers this feature. The CORC
Project also provides links between the CORC database and the Pathfinder module
and enables subject guide creators to identify relevant Web resources and import
them into a pathfinder.
</p>
<p>Another solution is that more and more libraries have cataloged elec-
tronic resources, especially Web resources. This practice reflects an evolving
view of the catalog, which used to refer to the collection of one library. In 1995
and 1996 AutoCat, a listserv for catalogers, had lively discussions on how to
control Web resources&mdash;cataloging or indexing.18 Most participants preferred
that the online catalog represent resources selected for the users, regardless of
</p>
<p>258 ■ Cataloging and the Changing Information Environment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the location of such resources. And this approach has been found feasible. After
a thorough analysis of the characteristics of resources on the Internet OCLC
launched the InterCat project to assess if the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules
and the MARC format would be adequate for cataloging Web resources.19 The
results include an experimental catalog that has continued to grow and a set of
guidelines for cataloging Internet resources.20
</p>
<p>In addition, librarians have also experimented with other metadata
standards in their efforts to control digital collections. Libraries such as the Uni-
versity of Virginia Library have extracted information from TEI headers and
EAD headers to generate bibliographic records for their online catalogs. Several
libraries have begun using Dublin Core to organize media, and the University of
Michigan has developed a search engine that supports searching by Dublin Core
elements (http://www.images.umdl.umich.edu). University of Washington has
mapped metadata from various sources to Dublin Core and created an integrated
service that can search 14 media collections individually or simultaneously (see
http://content.library.washington.edu).
</p>
<p>Theoretical Analysis
</p>
<p>In addition to these practical solutions, the library community has
also examined the theoretical aspects of cataloging in the hope that the underpinning
of cataloging can be strengthened and a solid theory of cataloging will enable
catalogers to organize information of any formats. Heaney applied the object-
oriented model to the MARC record and proposed the development of an object-
oriented cataloging code.21 Green proposed applying the entity-relationship
model to create large bibliographic databases.22 Tillet offered a taxonomy of biblio-
graphic relationships.23 In 1997 the International Conference on the Principles and
Future Development of AACR was held in Toronto to examine the principles
and structures of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules.24 Topics such as the
logical structure of AACR, the definition of &ldquo;work,&rdquo; the principles of AACR, access
points, and beyond MARC are presented. The Joint Steering Committee (JSC)
for Revision of Anglo-American Cataloging Rules has taken the recommenda-
tions from the Conference to develop an action plan and has put forward the final
report on the logical structure of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules and a report
on seriality for review and comment.25 In 1998 the International Federation of Library
Associations issued a final report on the functional requirements for biblio-
graphic records.26 When feedback from the cataloging community is received,
the JSC will decide which recommendations will be incorporated into the next
version of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules.
</p>
<p>Another major rule revision that will have far-reaching impact, if
adopted, is the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD) for
</p>
<p>Responses from the Library Community ■ 259</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Electronic Resources (ER).27 Sanberg-Fox and Byrum described how the ISBD
for Computer Files was revised into the ISBD for Electronic Resources (ER) and
highlighted significant differences from AACR2R in describing electronic re-
sources.28 ISBD (ER) covers the treatment of interactive multimedia and Internet
resources, expands the list of internal sources, makes explicit the prescribed sources
for each area, replaces the GMD &ldquo;computer file&rdquo; with &ldquo;electronic resources,&rdquo; expands
the list of file designations for Area 3, and offers many other changes useful for
describing electronic resources. The Committee on Cataloging: Description and
Access (CC:DA) of the Association for Library Collections and Technical Services
(ALCTS) has analyzed the implications of ISBD (ER) and identified AACR2R
rules that have been affected by ISBD (ER).29 If Chapter 9 of AACR2R incorpo-
rates changes proposed by ISBD (ER), the cataloging of electronic resources is
likely to be easier in the future.
</p>
<p>Metadata
</p>
<p>In addition to the above efforts, people outside of the cataloging
community have developed standards, sometimes with the help of librarians, to
organize electronic resources important to their user communities. Such stan-
dards are considered &ldquo;metadata&rdquo; because they refer to data about data (i.e.,
information-bearing entities). The objectives of metadata are for users to iden-
tify, describe, and locate the referenced entities and for managers to control the
entities&rsquo; authenticity, use patterns, access rights, contents, and so on.30 Although
the cataloging community may have been alarmed at first when the discussion of
metadata became widespread, it soon became clear that cataloging records is one
type of metadata. The question is whether cataloging can represent complex re-
sources sufficiently and meet the objectives of metadata. As catalogers refine
cataloging rules and the methods of record creation, it has become clear that
some awareness of other metadata is important because the display and indexing
of digital collections require encoding details that are not covered by the MARC
format. The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), for instance, was developed in 1987
by humanities scholars, publishers, archivists, and librarians to mark up literary
texts.31 TEI encoding enables full-texts to be displayed. Users can browse a text,
jump to any section of it, search it, or search across several texts. As an SGML
DTD (Document Type Definition), TEI makes display and searching of elec-
tronic texts a reality and facilitates the sharing of electronic texts. While catalogers
may not need to know how to tag a poem or a chapter, they do need to have some
understanding of the metadata embedded in the TEI Header because this area
contains useful information for cataloging purposes. The TEI Header includes
information on the file, encoding practice, source, and revision history of a text. It
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>can be displayed with an electronic text, and has been used as the basis for catalog-
ing by many libraries. The University of Virginia, for instance, has established a
procedure for cataloging records to be derived from the TEI header.32 To explore
the relationship of TEI to XML and to MARC a &ldquo;TEI and XML in Digital Libraries
Workshop&rdquo; was held in June of 1998. As a result, a &ldquo;Best Practices TEI&rdquo; page
was published to show how TEI elements correspond to MARC fields and how
catalogers can extract such elements to create MARC records.33 In late 1998 the
CC:DA Task Force on TEI issued a final report to aid the cataloging community
in understanding the implications of TEI.34
</p>
<p>Dublin Core (DC) is probably the metadata standard that has received
the most attention from the library community. This is because it is easy to under-
stand, extensible to Web resources in any formats, and interoperable with other
standards.35 The standard originated from a meeting at OCLC in Dublin, Ohio,
and many countries around the world have participated in its development. In
September 1998 the standard was issued as an Internet Engineering Task Force
Information RFC (Request for Comments)36 and may gain broad acceptance in
the future.
</p>
<p>DC includes 15 core elements that are similar to MARC record ele-
ments but require no cataloging expertise to create. Each of the elements is op-
tional and repeatable. The original intent of DC was for authors of Web
resources to provide the elements so that machine indexing and searching can be
easily performed. Search engines such as AltaVista and Infoseek have supported
searching by DC elements but it is not clear to what extent DC has been accepted
by Web authors.
</p>
<p>The library community, in fact, has experimented more than regular
Web authors in creating DC. Several tools are available to facilitate the creation
of DC elements, among them the DC Generator and the Dublin Core Metadata
Template are well-known.37 These elements can be edited and embedded in the
HTML head area of Web resources to make them searchable. A Nordic Web Index
was also set up to illustrate how DC can be used for retrieval purposes.38 Many
libraries around the world have implemented DC-based projects and data con-
version information is available at the NORDIC site and the DC home page. The
following table illustrates the relationship of DC elements to MARC structure:

<p>Note that the mapping between DC and MARC is not necessarily
one-to-one. And if DC is extended, through qualifiers, to support more complex
descriptions, the conversion will involve more MARC fields. The Nordic Metadata
Project&rsquo;s DC to MARC converter (http://www.bibsys.no/meta/d2m/) illustrates
the process and the USMARC office has issued a report on the conversion of
Dublin Core to MARC, and to GILS.39
</p>
<p>The latest major research effort in Dublin Core is the OCLC CORC
Project, which aims to create a catalog of Web resources through cooperation
and machine assistance.40 Using Mantis (http://purl.oclc.org/mantis) to generate
and extract metadata, CORC supports automatic creation of DC records, quick
conversion between DC and MARC, online editing in DC and MARC with
source page displayed in a frame or a separate window, automatic assignment of
Library of Congress subject headings and Dewey Decimal Classification num-
bers, assignment of subject keywords by WordSmith, authority control, and out-
put in MARC, HTML, and XML formats. It also supports pathfinder generation
and management. Plans to support other metadata such as TEI and to extend DC
to locally digitized materials are in the works. The enthusiasm for CORC shows
</p>
<p>262 ■ Cataloging and the Changing Information Environment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>that the library community has realized the importance of cooperative efforts in
information organization and access. Since DC is international in scope, applicable
to all subjects, and mappable to other metadata standards, it is likely to be the
metadata that will affect how electronic resources are organized in the changing
information environment.
</p>
<p>Other metadata standards are narrower in scope but valuable for the
discovery and management of selected types of material. Encoded Archival De-
scription (EAD), for instance, has been developed to encode archival finding
aids;41 and Government Information Locator Service (GILS) is for access to in-
formation resources produced by federal government agencies.42 Media-specific
metadata standards have also been developed. A well-known example is the Instruc-
tional Management Systems (IMS) metadata that describe learning resources
such as multimedia courseware and PowerPoint presentations.43
</p>
<p>The rapid development of standards is overwhelming to anyone
interested in information organization. As the leader of the cataloging community,
the CC:DA of ALCTS has made serious efforts to help catalogers to understand
metadata and its implications. A Task Force Report on TEI was issued in the fall
of 1998;44 a CC:DA Task Force on Metadata has been appointed; and a listserv,
Metamarda-L, has been created to facilitate the work of the Task Force. The four
working groups respectively examined the resource description needs of library,
built a conceptual map of the resource description landscape, defined &ldquo;meta-
data,&rdquo; &ldquo;interoperability,&rdquo; and &ldquo;metadata schema,&rdquo; and identified prototypes that
made use of metadata.45 MARBI (Machine-Readable Bibliographic Information),
an interdivisional committee of the American Library Association, is another group
that has actively addressed the needs to describe and control electronic resources.
For example, at its 1999 midwinter meeting the group discussed the merit of making
field 856 repeatable, the value of URN, and the merit of having URL information
in fields other than field 856. Attending MARBI meetings or reading their minutes
is a good way to keep current with changes in the cataloging field.46
</p>
<p>Tension Between Metadata and
Cataloging Practice
</p>
<p>While many libraries catalog Web resources and even draw on portions
of metadata to create bibliographic records, tension between metadata, espe-
cially Dublin Core, and cataloging exists. Many catalogers are concerned
whether Dublin Core will replace cataloging and what other implications Dublin
Core may have for the future of information organization. On more than one oc-
casion Dublin Core advocates have mentioned the liberation from cataloging
rules as a major benefit of having metadata (see, for example, the Nordic Meta-
data Project report at http://linnea.helsinki.fi/meta/nmfinal.htm). But opponents
such as Michael Gorman have pointed out that simplicity is accomplished at the
expense of details and specificity.47
</p>
<p>Responses from the Library Community ■ 263</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Furthermore, as expressed by some CORC participants, guidelines are
needed for the implementation of the Dublin Core standard. To ensure consistent
implementation and sharing of metadata, issues such as the levels of description,
the definition of chief source of information and prescribed sources of information,
the choice of access points, the semantics of the elements (such as how to record a
name or a publication date), and many other issues must be addressed. The Univer-
sity of Chicago&rsquo;s guidelines for using Dublin Core (http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/
Annex/TechSvcs/dcguidelines.html) could serve as the basis for developing input-
ting standards for Dublin Core. Gorman proposes to control electronic resources
by creating records of varying details depending on the importance of re-
sources.48 His four levels of treatment&mdash;full cataloging records, enriched Dublin
Core records, minimal Dublin Core records, and keywords&mdash;provide a helpful
example for specifying the levels of cataloging for electronic resources. As these
two examples illustrate, the cataloging community can and should contribute to the
development of metadata guidelines. That is the best approach to ensure appropriate
organization of electronic resources.
</p>
<p>Catalogers will also want to keep an open mind about metadata&rsquo;s poten-
tial. The effort at the University of Washington to map data elements from various
image collections to Dublin Core demonstrates how catalogers can apply their
knowledge of cataloging to the creation of a metadata dictionary. The project also
makes explicit how services can be enhanced by combining cataloging knowl-
edge with sophisticated tools such as the CONTENT software suite. Electronic
resources present opportunities for catalogers to reexamine how they organize
information. The efforts by librarians so far suggest many librarians have affirmed
the value of systematic human analysis of electronic resource and recognized the
benefits in drawing on sophisticated technology and &ldquo;agents&rdquo; to enhance services.
</p>
<p>■THE FUTURE OF CATALOGING
AND CATALOGERS
</p>
<p>The Future of Cataloging and Catalogers
</p>
<p>The future of cataloging and catalogers is closely tied to the future of
libraries. Many believe the libraries of the future will be &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; libraries
that integrate new forms of intellectual and artistic expression into existing collec-
tions and provide strong bibliographic structures that guide users to resources in
any formats, whether they are locally owned or not, and support users&rsquo; interaction
with recorded knowledge and information.49 As libraries evolve, catalogers will
need to expand the current bibliographic structures to accommodate resources
that combine different media. To prepare for such tasks, catalogers will need to
become familiar with cataloging rules for such resources first. Then they should
draw on their experience in organizing such resources and their knowledge of
the creation, transfer, and use of information to propose ways to improve the
cataloging of these resources.50 By sharing ideas and experience in professional
organizations such as ALCTS and IFLA, catalogers will help bring about rule
</p>
<p>264 ■ Cataloging and the Changing Information Environment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>revisions and changes in cataloging practices. When a strong bibliographic
structure is in place to support international cooperation in organizing and shar-
ing information resources, the future of cataloging will be further secured.51
</p>
<p>In addition, catalogers need to work with other professionals to develop
or identify appropriate standards and methods for information organization.
Digital technology has made it possible for archivists, special collections directors,
museum specialists, scientists, and others to present their collections electronically,
whether on the Internet or on CD-ROM or DVD. If catalogers are not involved in
the planning and implementation of a digital collection, the task of organizing
digital objects will become more difficult later. Catalogers have much to offer to
other professionals. The principles of cataloging are applicable to digital materials,
and cataloging concepts such as collocation, access points, authority control,
controlled vocabulary, and subject analysis are highly relevant to the organization
of digital materials.52 Sharing their cataloging expertise with other professionals,
catalogers will help others understand critical issues related to resource descrip-
tion and access. Likewise, understanding the purpose and perspectives of other
professionals, catalogers will be able to help others in improving standards and
accomplishing their objectives through cataloging, metadata, or other methods
of information organization.
</p>
<p>As more and more digital libraries are taking shape, an inevitable
question is: Will cataloging and catalogers be needed in digital libraries? Tech-
nology enthusiasts may prefer heavy reliance on technology to create and manage
a digital library, but it is humans who make decisions on what technology will do
and how technology will carry out instructions. As Levy observed, order is critical
for the stability and usability of digital collections, and cataloging efforts, enhanced
and facilitated by technology, are critical to bring about order.53 The organization
of digital resources requires that one considers which resources will be cataloged
and how much detail should be included in records so that information resources
can be identified, discovered, evaluated, and accessed. These goals of cataloging
remain the same in the digital environment, but the procedures will evolve. For
instance, if future resources have metadata embedded in them, the cataloging
process may become simplified. Catalogers will have many areas to apply their
expertise. They can, for example, help define how electronic resources, commer-
cially and locally produced, will be described for access; how resources created
by different standards and embedded with different metadata will be integrated
into the collection; how the collection will be maintained for access; and how to
provide interactivity in the system for users to take full advantage of the library&rsquo;s
resources.

<p>■CONCLUSION
Conclusion
</p>
<p>Cataloging involves technology, yet technology continues to cause
concerns over the future of cataloging. When bibliographic utilities became
available in the 1960s, the fear that machines would replace catalogers loomed
large but was never realized. In the 1980s paraprofessionals performed most of
copy cataloging, while catalogers were busy preparing data for online catalogs,
thus technology seemed less threatening than before. But the economic situation
in the first half of 1990s led to reduced support for cataloging and large-scale
outsourcing was implemented in some institutions. The growth of the Internet
caused further concerns that cataloging might be inadequate for describing dynamic
Web resources and that search engines would render cataloging unnecessary.
But catalogers reaffirmed their belief in the principles of cataloging and the
objectives of the catalog, and addressed the challenges directly by developing
guidelines for interactive multimedia and Internet resources. Now new forms of
intellectual expression, growth of digital collections, proliferation of standards,
and users&rsquo; expectation and demand for virtual displays have posed new challenges
to libraries. As librarians seek to redefine their roles in the changing information
environment, the need to organize electronic resources for access becomes more
urgent. Catalogers have proven that they can successfully integrate new formats such
as sound recordings, videorecordings, and computer files into the bibliographic
structure. Recent efforts in the cataloging community suggest that catalogers are
meeting the new challenges directly. Catalogers&rsquo; knowledge of information
organization and commitment to produce helpful tools for users will help librarians
secure their future in the next century.
