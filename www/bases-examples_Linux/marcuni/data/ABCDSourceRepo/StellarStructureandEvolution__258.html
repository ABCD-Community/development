<p>Preface to the First Edition
</p>
<p>The attempt to understand the physics of the structure of stars and their change in
</p>
<p>time &ndash; their evolution &ndash; has been bothering many physicists and astronomers ever
</p>
<p>since the last century. This long chain of successful research is well documented
</p>
<p>not only by numerous papers in the corresponding journals but also by a series of
</p>
<p>books. Some of them are so excellently written that despite their age they can still
</p>
<p>be recommended and not only as documents of the state of the art at that time.
</p>
<p>A few outstanding examples are the books of Emden (1907), Eddington (1926),
</p>
<p>Chandrasekhar (1939), and Schwarzschild (1958). But our science has rapidly
</p>
<p>expanded in the last few decades, and new aspects have emerged which could not
</p>
<p>even be anticipated, say, 30 years ago and which today have to be carefully explored.
</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that our ambition is to present a complete account
</p>
<p>of the latest and most refined numerical results. This can well be left to the large
</p>
<p>and growing number of excellent review articles. This book is intended rather to
</p>
<p>be a textbook that will help students and teachers to understand these results as far
</p>
<p>as possible and present them in a simple and clear manner. We know how difficult
</p>
<p>this is since we ourselves have tried for the largest part of our scientific career to
</p>
<p>understand &ldquo;how the stars work&rdquo; &ndash; and then to make others believe it. In these
</p>
<p>attempts we have found that often enough a simplified analytical example can be
</p>
<p>more helpful than the discussion of an exceptionally beautiful numerical solution.
</p>
<p>Thereforewe do not hesitate to includemany simple considerations and estimates, if
</p>
<p>necessary, even at the expense of rigour and the latest results. The reader should also
</p>
<p>note that the list of references given in this book is not intended to represent a table
</p>
<p>of honour for the (known and unknown) heroes of the theory of stellar structure; it is
</p>
<p>merely designed to help the beginner to find a few first paths in the literature jungle
</p>
<p>and presents those papers from which we have more or less randomly chosen the
</p>
<p>numbers for figures and numerical examples (There are others of at least the same
</p>
<p>quality!).
</p>
<p>The choice of topics for a book such as this is difficult and certainly subject
</p>
<p>to personal preferences. Completeness is neither possible nor desirable. Still, one
</p>
<p>may wonder why we did not include, for example, binary stars, although we are
</p>
<p>obviously interested in their evolution. The reason is that here one would have had
</p>
<p>vii</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>viii Preface to the First Edition
</p>
<p>to include the physics of essentially non-spherical objects (such as disks), while
</p>
<p>we concentrate mainly on spherical configurations; even in the brief description of
</p>
<p>rotation the emphasis is on small deviations from spherical symmetry.
</p>
<p>This book would never have been completed without the kind and competent
</p>
<p>help of many friends and colleagues. We mention particularly Wolfgang
</p>
<p>Duschl and Peter Schneider who read critically through the whole manuscript;
</p>
<p>Norman Baker, Gerhard Börner, Mounib El Eid, Wolfgang Hillebrandt,
</p>
<p>Helmuth Kahler, Ewald Müller, Henk Spruit, Joachim Wambsgan&szlig;, and many
</p>
<p>others read through particular chapters and gave us their valuable advice. In fact it
</p>
<p>would probably be simpler to give a complete list of those of our colleagues who
</p>
<p>have not contributed than of those who helped us.
</p>
<p>In addition we have to thank many secretaries at our institutes; several have left
</p>
<p>their jobs (for other reasons!) during the five years in which we kept them busy.
</p>
<p>Most of this work was done by Cornelia Rickl and Petra Berkemeyer in Munich
</p>
<p>and Christa Leppien and Heinke Heise in Hamburg, while Gisela Wimmersberger
</p>
<p>prepared all the graphs. We are grateful to them all.
</p>
<p>Finally we wish to thank Springer-Verlag for their enthusiastic cooperation.

<p>Preface to the Second Edition
</p>
<p>Twenty years after its first publication, this textbook is still a major reference for
</p>
<p>scientists and students interested in or working on problems of stellar structure and
</p>
<p>evolution. But with the incredible growth of computational power, the computation
</p>
<p>of stellar models has to large extent become a standard tool for astrophysics. While
</p>
<p>the early computations were restricted to single choices for mass, compositions and
</p>
<p>possibly evolutionary stage, by nowmodels for the whole parameter space exist. The
</p>
<p>first edition of this book was restricted to a few examples for low- and intermediate-
</p>
<p>mass star evolution and lacked the broader view now being possible. There are even
</p>
<p>semi-automatic stellar evolution codes that may be used remotely via the Internet.
</p>
<p>However, stellar evolution programs should not be used without a thorough
</p>
<p>understanding of the stellar physics. Therefore, a textbook concentrating on the
</p>
<p>foundations of the theory and explaining in detail specific phases and events in the
</p>
<p>life of a star is very much needed to allow scientifically solid modelling of stars.
</p>
<p>This is the reason why this book deserved a second edition.
</p>
<p>Much to our regret, A. Weigert passed away two years after publication of the
</p>
<p>first edition. He left a gap that cannot be filled. Given the above mentioned need for
</p>
<p>a second edition and the requirement to add up-to-date stellar models, it was decided
</p>
<p>to have A. Weiss join R. Kippenhahn in preparing the new edition.
</p>
<p>The two authors of this book came to discriminate between the eternal truth
</p>
<p>and the mutable parts. The latter ones refer to the current state of modelling and
</p>
<p>knowledge obtained from numerical models and their comparison to observations.
</p>
<p>Such chapters were updated, extended, or added. As far as possible, the stellar
</p>
<p>models shown were specifically calculated for this purpose, with the present, much
</p>
<p>evolved version of the original code by Kippenhahn, Weigert, and Hofmeister. The
</p>
<p>numerical results are therefore much more homogeneous and consistent than in the
</p>
<p>first edition.
</p>
<p>The eternal truth concerns the aforementioned basic physics and their under-
</p>
<p>standing. These parts of the book have been left almost untouched, since the authors
</p>
<p>(and those readers who were consulted) did not see any reason to change them.
</p>
<p>The authors are indebted to many friends and colleagues who gave their advice
</p>
<p>or comments, with respect to both necessary changes and the new text passages.

<p>Coordinates, Mass Distribution,

</p>
<p>1.1 Eulerian Description
</p>
<p>For gaseous, non-rotating, single stars without strong magnetic fields, the only
</p>
<p>forces acting on a mass element come from pressure and gravity. This results
</p>
<p>in a spherically symmetric configuration. All functions will then be constant on
</p>
<p>concentric spheres, and we need only one spatial variable to describe them. It seems
</p>
<p>natural to use the distance r from the stellar centre as the spatial coordinate, which
</p>
<p>varies from r D 0 at the centre to the total radius r D R at the surface of the star.
In addition, the evolution in time t requires a dependence of all functions on t: If we
</p>
<p>thus take r and t as independent variables, we have a typical &ldquo;Eulerian&rdquo; treatment
</p>
<p>in the sense of classical hydrodynamics. Then all other variables are considered to
</p>
<p>depend on these two, for example, the density % D %.r; t/:
In order to provide a convenient description of the mass distribution inside the
</p>
<p>star, in particular of its effect on the gravitational field, we define the function1
</p>
<p>m.r; t/ as the mass contained in a sphere of radius r at the time t (Fig. 1.1). Thenm
</p>
<p>varies with respect to r and t according to
</p>
<p>dm D 4�r2%dr � 4�r2%v dt: (1.1)
</p>
<p>The first term on the right is obviously the mass contained in the spherical shell of
</p>
<p>thickness dr (Fig. 1.1), and it gives the variation of m.r; t/ due to a variation of r at
</p>
<p>constant t; i.e.
</p>
<p>@m
</p>
<p>@r
D 4�r2%: (1.2)

</p>
<p>The last term in (1.1) gives the (spherically symmetric) mass flow out of the

<p>1.2 Lagrangian Description
</p>
<p>It will turn out that, in the spherically symmetric case, it is often more useful to
</p>
<p>take a Lagrangian coordinate instead of r , i.e. one which is connected to the mass
</p>
<p>elements. The spatial coordinate of a given mass element then does not vary in time.
</p>
<p>We choose for this coordinate the above defined m: to any mass element, the value</p>

<p>1.2 Lagrangian Description 5
</p>
<p>m (which is the mass contained in a concentric sphere at a given moment t0) is
</p>
<p>assigned once and for all (see Fig. 1.1).
</p>
<p>The new independent variables are then m and t; and all other variables are
</p>
<p>considered to depend on them, for example, %.m; t/: This also includes the radial
</p>
<p>distance r of our mass element from the centre, which is now described by the
</p>
<p>function r D r.m; t/. Since there is certainly no singularity of % at the centre, we
have here m D 0, while the star&rsquo;s total mass m D M is reached at the surface
(i.e. where r D R/: This already shows one advantage of the new description
for the (normal) case of stars with constant total mass: while the radius R varies
</p>
<p>strongly in time, the star always extends over the same interval of the independent
</p>
<p>variable m W 0 � m � M: Although real stars do lose mass, for example, by stellar
winds or due to gravitational interaction in binary systems, over short timescales the
</p>
<p>assumption of constant mass is justified nevertheless. In any case, the range of m
</p>
<p>never changes by more than a factor of a few.
</p>
<p>As just indicated, there will certainly be no problem concerning a unique
</p>
<p>one-to-one transformation between the two coordinates r and m: We then easily
</p>
<p>find the connection between the partial derivatives in the two cases fromwell-known
</p>
<p>formulae. For any function depending on two variables, one of which is substituted
</p>
<p>by a new one (r; t ! m; t), the partial derivatives with respect to the new variables
are given by

<p>Let us apply the first of (1.5) tom. The left-hand side is then simply @m=@m D 1,

<p>derivative of hydrodynamics. It describes the change of a function in time when
</p>
<p>following a given mass element, for example, the change of a physical property
</p>
<p>of this mass element. The conservation laws for time-dependent spherical stars
</p>
<p>give very simple equations only in terms of this substantial time derivative. In
</p>
<p>terms of a local time derivative, .@=@t/r , the description would become much more
</p>
<p>complicated since the &ldquo;convective&rdquo; terms with the velocity .@r=@t/m [corresponding
</p>
<p>to the first term on the right-hand side of the second equation (1.5)] would appear
</p>
<p>explicitly.
</p>
<p>1.3 The Gravitational Field
</p>
<p>It follows from elementary potential theory that, inside a spherically symmetric
</p>
<p>body, the absolute value g of the gravitational acceleration at a given distance r
</p>
<p>from the centre does not depend on the mass elements outside of r . It depends only
</p>
<p>on r and the mass within the concentric sphere of radius r , which we have calledm:
</p>
<p>g D Gm
r2
; (1.8)
</p>
<p>whereG D 6:673�10�8 dyn cm2 g�2 is the gravitational constant. So the gravitating
mass appears only in the form of our variablem:
</p>
<p>Generally, the gravitational field inside the star can be described by a gravita-
</p>
<p>tional potential ˚ , which is a solution of the Poisson equation
</p>

<p>The vector of the gravitational acceleration points towards the stellar centre and may

<p>in spherical coordinates be written as g D .�g; 0; 0/with 0 &lt; g D jgj. It is obtained
from ˚ by the vector relation g D �r˚ , where in our spherically symmetric case,
only the radial component is non-vanishing:

<p>Conservation of Momentum
</p>
<p>Conservation of momentum provides the next basic differential equation of the
</p>
<p>stellar-structure problem.We will derive this in several steps of gradually increasing
</p>
<p>generality. The first assumes mechanical equilibrium (Sect. 2.1), the equation of
</p>
<p>motion for spherical symmetry follows in Sect. 2.4, while in Sect. 2.5 even the
</p>
<p>assumption of spherical symmetry is dropped. In Sect. 2.6 we briefly discuss general
</p>
<p>relativistic effects in the case of hydrostatic equilibrium.
</p>
<p>2.1 Hydrostatic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>Most stars are obviously in such long-lasting phases of their evolution that no
</p>
<p>changes can be observed at all. Then the stellar matter cannot be accelerated
</p>
<p>noticeably, which means that all forces acting on a given mass element of the star
</p>
<p>compensate each other. This mechanical equilibrium in a star is called &ldquo;hydrostatic
</p>
<p>equilibrium&rdquo;, since the same condition also governs the pressure stratification, say,
</p>
<p>in a basin of water. With our assumptions (gaseous stars without rotation, magnetic
</p>
<p>fields, or close companions), the only forces are due to gravity and to the pressure
</p>
<p>gradient.
</p>
<p>For a given moment of time, we consider a thin spherical mass shell with (an
</p>
<p>infinitesimal) thickness dr at a radius r inside the star. Per unit area of the shell, the
</p>
<p>mass is % dr, and the weight of the shell is �g% dr. This weight is the gravitational
force acting towards the centre (as indicated by the minus sign).
</p>
<p>In order to prevent the mass elements of the shell from being accelerated in this
</p>
<p>direction, they must experience a net force due to pressure of the same absolute
</p>
<p>value, but acting outwards. This means that the shell must feel a larger pressure Pi
at its interior (lower) boundary than the pressure Pe at its outer (upper) boundary
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 2.1). The total net force per unit area acting on the shell due to this pressure
</p>
<p>difference is

<p>We have dealt up to now with the distribution of matter, the gravitational field, and
</p>
<p>the pressure stratification in the star. This purely mechanical problem yielded two
</p>
<p>differential equations, for example, with m as independent variable (a choice not

</p>
<p>Let us see whether solutions can be obtained at this stage for the problem as stated
</p>
<p>so far.
</p>
<p>We have only two differential equations for three unknown functions, namely
</p>
<p>r; P; and %. Obviously we can solve this mechanical problem only if we can express
</p>
<p>one of them in terms of the others, for example, the density % as a function of P . In
</p>
<p>general, this will not be the case. But there are some exceptional situations where %
</p>
<p>is a well-known function of P and r or P andm. We can then treat the equations as
</p>
<p>ordinary differential equations, since they do not contain the time explicitly.
</p>
<p>If such integrations are to be carried out starting from the centre, the difficulty
</p>
<p>occurs that (2.6) are singular there, since r ! 0 for m ! 0, though one can easily
overcome this problem by the standard procedure of expansion in powers of m; as
</p>
<p>given later in (11.3) and (11.6).
</p>
<p>A rather artificial example that can be solved by quadrature is % D %.m/; in
particular % = constant in the homogeneous gaseous sphere.
</p>
<p>Physically more realistic are solutions obtained for the so-called barotropic case,
</p>
<p>for which the density is a function of the gas pressure only: % D %.P /: A simple
example would be a perfect1 gas at constant temperature. After assuming a value
</p>
<p>Pc for the central pressure, both equations (2.6) have to be solved simultaneously,
</p>
<p>since %.P / in the first of them is not known before P is evaluated.
</p>
<p>As we will see later (for instance, in Sects. 19.3 and 19.8), there are also cases
</p>
<p>for which no choice of Pc yields a surface of zero pressure at finite values of r . In
</p>
<p>the theory of stellar structure there is even a use for these types of solution.
</p>
<p>Among the barotropic solutions is a wide class of models for gaseous spheres
</p>
<p>called polytropes. These important solutions will later be discussed extensively
</p>
<p>(Chap. 19). Barotropic solutions also describe white dwarfs, i.e. stars that really
</p>
<p>exist (Sect. 37.1).
</p>
<p>But in general the density is not a function of pressure only but depends also on
</p>
<p>the temperature T: For a given chemical composition of the gas, its thermodynamic
</p>
<p>behaviour yields an equation of state of the form % D %.P; T /: A well-known case
is that of a perfect gas, where

</p>
<p>number of atomic mass units per particle; in the case of ionized hydrogen, � D 0:5
(see Sect. 4.2).
</p>
<p>1Throughout this book we will use the terms perfect and ideal gas synonymously, as they describe
</p>
<p>the same physical concept.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 2 Conservation of Momentum
</p>
<p>Once the temperature appears in the equation of state and cannot be eliminated
</p>
<p>by means of additional conditions, it then becomes muchmore difficult to determine
</p>
<p>the internal structure of a self-gravitating gaseous sphere. The mechanical structure
</p>
<p>is then also determined by the temperature distribution, which in turn is coupled to
</p>
<p>the transport and generation of energy in the star. This requires new equations, with
</p>
<p>which we shall deal in Chaps. 4 and 5.
</p>
<p>2.3 Simple Estimates of Central Values Pc; Tc
</p>
<p>The hydrostatic condition (2.5) together with an equation of state for a perfect gas
</p>
<p>(2.7) enables us to estimate the pressure and the temperature in the interior of a star
</p>
<p>of given mass and radius.
</p>
<p>Let us replace the left-hand side of (2.5) by an average pressure gradient (P0 �
Pc/=M; where P0.D 0/ and Pc are the pressures at the surface and at the centre.
On the right-hand side of (2.5) we replacem and r by rough mean valuesM=2 and

<p>R=2; and we obtain

<p>2.4 The Equation of Motion for Spherical Symmetry 13
</p>
<p>Modern numerical solutions (Chap. 29) give Pc D 2:4 � 1017 dyn/cm2, Tc D 1:6 �
107K.
</p>
<p>So we can expect to encounter enormous pressures and very high temperatures
</p>
<p>in the central regions of the stars. Moreover, our assumption of a perfect gas turns
</p>
<p>out to be fully justified for these values of P and T .
</p>
<p>2.4 The Equation of Motion for Spherical Symmetry
</p>
<p>Our equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (2.5) is a special case of conservation of
</p>
<p>momentum. If the (spherical) star undergoes accelerated radial motions, we have to
</p>
<p>consider the inertia of the mass elements, which introduces an additional term. We
</p>
<p>confine ourselves here to the Lagrangian description .m; t as independent variables),
</p>
<p>which is especially convenient for spherical symmetry.
</p>
<p>We go back to the derivation of the hydrostatic equation in Sect. 2.1 and again
</p>
<p>consider a thin shell of mass dm at the distance r from the centre (Fig. 1.1). Owing
</p>
<p>to the pressure gradient, this shell experiences a force per unit area fP given by
</p>
<p>(2.1), the right-hand side of which is easily rewritten in terms of @P=@m according
</p>
<p>to (1.7):
</p>
<p>fP D �
@P
</p>
<p>@m
dm: (2.13)
</p>
<p>The gravitational force per unit area acting on the mass shell is, with the use of (1.8),

D �Gm
</p>
<p>r2

</p>

</p>
<p>If the sum of the two forces is not equal to zero, the mass shell will be accelerated
</p>
<p>according to
</p>
<p>dm
</p>
<p>4�r2
@2r

</p>
<p>@t2
D � @P
</p>
<p>@m
� Gm
4�r4
</p>
<p>: (2.16)
</p>
<p>The signs in (2.16) are such that the pressure gradient alone would produce an
</p>
<p>outward acceleration (since @P=@m &lt; 0), while the gravity alone would produce
</p>
<p>an inward acceleration.
</p>
<p>Equation (2.16) would give exactly the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (2.5)
</p>
<p>if the second time derivative of r vanished, i.e. if all mass elements were at rest
</p>
<p>or moved radially at constant velocity. Moreover, the term on the left-hand side is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14 2 Conservation of Momentum
</p>
<p>certainly unimportant if its absolute value is small compared to the absolute values
</p>
<p>of any term on the right, i.e. if the two terms on the right-hand side cancel each
</p>
<p>other nearly to zero. Then the hydrostatic condition is a very good approximation,
</p>
<p>and the configuration moves through neighbouring near-equilibrium states. In this
</p>
<p>sense we are allowed to apply the simpler hydrostatic equation to a much wider
</p>
<p>class of solutions than those fulfilling the strict requirement @2r=@t2 D 0. To
illustrate this further we assume a deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium such that,
</p>
<p>for example, in (2.16), the pressure term suddenly &ldquo;disappears&rdquo;. The inertial term on
</p>
<p>the left would then have to compensate the gravitational term on the right. We now
</p>
<p>define a characteristic time-scale �ff for the ensuing collapse of the star by setting
</p>
<p>j@2r=@t2j D R=�2ff. Then we obtain from (2.16) R=�2ff � g, or
</p>
<p>�ff �
�
R
</p>
<p>g
</p>
<p>�1=2
: (2.17)
</p>
<p>This is some kind of a mean value for the free-fall time over a distance of order
</p>
<p>R following the sudden disappearance of the pressure. We can correspondingly
</p>
<p>determine a timescale �expl for the explosion of our star for the case that gravity
</p>
<p>were suddenly to disappear: R=�2expl D P=%R, where we have replaced @P=@r by
P=R after writing 4�r2.@P=@m/ D .@P=@r/=% (P and % are here average values
over the entire star). We then find that
</p>
<p>�expl � R
� %
P
</p>
<p>�1=2
: (2.18)
</p>
<p>Since .P=%/1=2 is of the order of the mean velocity of sound in the stellar interior,
</p>
<p>one can see that �expl is of the order of the time a sound wave needs to travel from
</p>
<p>the centre to the surface.
</p>
<p>If our model is near hydrostatic equilibrium, then the two terms on the right
</p>
<p>side of (2.16) have about equal absolute value and �ff � �expl. We then call this
timescale the hydrostatic timescale �hydr, since it gives the typical time in which a
</p>
<p>(dynamically stable) star reacts on a slight perturbation of hydrostatic equilibrium.
</p>
<p>With g � GM=R2; we obtain from (2.17) up to factors of order 1 that

<p>�hydr �
�
R3
</p>
<p>GM
</p>
<p>�1=2
� 1

.G N%/�1=2: (2.19)
</p>
<p>In the case of the Sun we find the surprisingly small value �hydr � 27min. Even in
the case of a red giant (M � Mˇ; R � 100Rˇ/, one has only �hydr � 18 days,
while for a white dwarf (M � Mˇ; R � Rˇ=50), the hydrostatic timescale is
extremely short: �hydr � 4:5 s. In most phases of their life the stars change slowly
on a timescale that is very long compared to �hydr. Then they are very close to
</p>
<p>hydrostatic equilibrium and the inertial terms in (2.16) can be ignored.</p>

<p>mass M � encloses a gas of mass m� in a box. G� D gM � is the weight of the
piston in a gravitational field described by the gravitational acceleration g. A is the
</p>
<p>cross-sectional area of the piston and h its height above the bottom. Then V D Ah
is the volume of the gas, while its density is % D m�=V:
</p>
<p>In the case of hydrostatic equilibrium, the gas pressure P adjusts in such a way
</p>
<p>that the weight per unit area is balanced by the pressure:

<p>The Virial Theorem
</p>
<p>3.1 Stars in Hydrostatic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>While the virial theorem generally plays a relatively minor role in physics, it is
</p>
<p>of vital importance for the understanding of stars. It connects two important energy
</p>
<p>reservoirs of a star and allows predictions and interpretations of certain evolutionary
</p>
<p>phases.
</p>
<p>If we multiply (2.5) by 4�r3 and integrate over dm in the interval Œ0;M &#141;, i.e.
</p>
<p>from centre to surface, we obtain on the left-hand side an integral which can be
</p>
<p>simplified by partial integration:

<p>@m
P dm ; (3.1)
</p>
<p>where the term in brackets vanishes, since r D 0 at the centre and P = 0 at
the surface. With (1.6) the integrand of the last term in (3.1) is reduced to 3P=%.
</p>
<p>Therefore, after multiplication by 4�r3 and integration, (2.5) gives

<p>20 3 The Virial Theorem
</p>
<p>is necessary to expand all mass shells into infinity, and it is released when the stellar
</p>
<p>configuration forms out of an infinitely distributed medium.
</p>
<p>We see that Eg varies if the configuration undergoes expansion or contraction: if
</p>
<p>all mass shells inside the configuration expand or contract simultaneously, then Eg
increases or decreases, respectively. And the same must be true for the integral on
</p>
<p>the right of (3.2). Note that these radial motions must be slow compared to �hydr in
</p>
<p>order that hydrostatic equilibrium is always maintained, otherwise (3.2) would not
</p>
<p>hold.
</p>
<p>In order to understand the meaning of the term on the right of (3.2) we first
</p>
<p>assume a perfect gas. Then

<p>P
</p>
<p>%
D &lt;
�
T D .cP � cv/T D .&#13; � 1/cvT; (3.4)
</p>
<p>where cP ; cv are the specific heats per unit mass (and wemake use of&lt;=� D cP�cv
and replace cP =cv by &#13; ). For a monatomic gas &#13; D 5=3, and we have
</p>
<p>P
</p>
<p>%
D 2

u ; (3.5)
</p>
<p>where u D cvT is the internal energy per unit mass of the perfect gas. Therefore
(3.2) can be written as
</p>
<p>Eg D �2Ei (3.6)
</p>
<p>with the total internal energy of the star
</p>
<p>Ei WD
Z M
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>u dm : (3.7)
</p>
<p>Equation (3.6) is the virial theorem for a perfect monatomic gas. For a general
</p>
<p>equation of state we define a quantity � by
</p>
<p>�u WD 3P
%

<p>For a perfect gas � D 3.&#13; � 1), in the monatomic case &#13; D 5=3, and therefore
� D 2. For a pure photon gas, P D aT 4=3; and u% D aT 4 (a = radiation density
constant), giving � D 1. If � is constant throughout the star, (3.2) leads to the more
general virial theorem:
</p>
<p>�Ei C Eg D 0 : (3.9)

<p>We now define the total energy W of our configuration,

<p>In the case of � D 1 .&#13; D 4=3) the total energy vanishes.
But in general W , Eg, and Ei are coupled. A change of the total energy of
</p>
<p>the configuration is then connected with a change of its internal energy and with
</p>
<p>expansion or shrinking. A gas of finite temperature must radiate and W must
</p>
<p>decrease. Let L be the luminosity of the star, i.e. the total energy loss per unit time
</p>
<p>by radiation; then conservation of energy demands that .dW=dt/ C L D 0, so that
with (3.11) we obtain

</p>
<p>D �� � 1

<p>dt
: (3.12)
</p>
<p>We have seen that PEg &lt; 0 for contraction of all mass shells (where the dot denotes a
derivative with respect to time t). For a perfect gas (3.12) gives L D � PEg=2 D PEi,
which means that half of the energy liberated by the contraction is radiated away
</p>
<p>and the other half is used to heat the star .L &gt; 0; PEi &gt; 0). The surprising fact that
a star heats up while losing energy can be described by saying that the star has a
</p>
<p>negative specific heat (cf. the gravothermal specific heat defined in Sect. 25.3.4).
</p>
<p>We have to keep in mind that it is the luminosity that causes the shrinking:
</p>
<p>a configuration in hydrostatic equilibrium has a finite temperature and therefore
</p>
<p>radiates into the (cold) universe.
</p>
<p>3.2 The Virial Theorem of the Piston Model
</p>
<p>Let us consider the situation for the piston model of Sect. 2.7 for the case of a perfect
</p>
<p>gas. Assuming M � � m�; we define Eg WD CG�h, where the free additional
constant is chosen such that Eg D 0 for h D 0. Hydrostatic equilibrium (2.33) with
m� D Ah% and (3.4) demands that
</p>
<p>hG� D P

m� D .&#13; � 1/cvT m� : (3.13)
</p>
<p>The internal energyEi of the gas is Ei D cvTm�, and we find that
</p>
<p>Eg D .&#13; � 1/Ei ; (3.14)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22 3 The Virial Theorem
</p>
<p>which is the virial theorem for the piston model. Differentiatingwith respect to time,
</p>
<p>with &#13; D 5=3, results in
dEg
</p>
<p>dt
D 2
3
</p>
<p>dEi
</p>
<p>dt
: (3.15)
</p>
<p>Hence we see that in contrast to the situation in stars, a reduction of Eg is connected
</p>
<p>with cooling of the gas. Indeed the piston can only sink if the gas cools.
</p>
<p>This different behaviour comes from the fact that the gravitational field is
</p>
<p>assumed to be constant here. In order to demonstrate this we now assume
</p>
<p>the weight G� to be a function of h and differentiate (3.13) with respect
to h W
</p>
<p>G�.1CG�h / D .&#13; � 1/
dEi
</p>
<p>dh
(3.16)
</p>
<p>with G�h WD .d lnG�=d lnh). Indeed, if G�h D 0 (constant gravity), we see that Ei
increases with h. If, however,G� decreases sufficiently with increasing h (such that
G�h &lt; �1), then Ei increases with decreasing h; corresponding to the behaviour of
stars. In fact in an expanding star eachmass shell also loses weight with increasing r .
</p>
<p>3.3 The Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz Timescale
</p>
<p>Returning now to consider stars, since according to (3.12) L is of the order of
</p>
<p>jdEg=dtj, we can define a characteristic time-scale
</p>
<p>�KH WD
jEgj
L
</p>
<p>� Ei
L
</p>
<p>(3.17)
</p>
<p>called the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz timescale (after the two physicists who estimated this
</p>
<p>as the evolutionary timescale for a contracting or cooling star).
</p>
<p>A rough estimate for jEgj is
</p>
<p>jEgj �
Gm2
</p>
<p>Nr �
GM2
</p>
<p>2R
; (3.18)
</p>
<p>where quantities with a bar indicate mean values for m and r (which we have
</p>
<p>replaced byM=2 and R=2/: Then we have
</p>
<p>�KH �
GM2
</p>
<p>2RL
: (3.19)
</p>
<p>For the Sun, with L D 3:827 � 1033 erg/s, we find �KH � 1:6 � 107 years. In the
early days of astrophysics the source of stellar energy was still uncertain, and it
</p>
<p>was suggested, among other proposals, that the Sun &ldquo;lived&rdquo; from its gravitational
</p>
<p>energy Eg. Our estimate shows that this can work only for some 10
7 years, after
</p>
<p>which time it would have contracted to a very condensed body.As it became obvious</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.4 The Virial Theorem for Non-vanishing Surface Pressure 23
</p>
<p>that the Sun has been radiating in roughly the same way for some 109 years, the
</p>
<p>contraction hypothesis had to be abandoned. But there are phases in a stellar life
</p>
<p>when Eg is the main or even the only stellar energy source (Chap. 28); then the star
</p>
<p>evolves on the timescale �KH. A more detailed discussion of the evolution of a star
</p>
<p>in time appears in Sect. 4.5.
</p>
<p>3.4 The Virial Theorem for Non-vanishing Surface Pressure
</p>
<p>One often needs the virial theorem for gaseous spheres imbedded in a medium of
</p>
<p>finite pressure. In this case, at the surface .m D M/,P D P0 &gt; 0 instead of P D 0.
Consequently the first term on the right of (3.1) does not vanish at the surface, and
</p>

= the atomic mass unit). Note that we here use the gas constant with a dimension
</p>
<p>(energy per K and per unit mass) different from that in thermodynamic text books
</p>
<p>(energy per K and per mole). This has the consequence that here the molecular
</p>
<p>weight � is dimensionless (instead of having the dimension mass per mole); it is
</p>
<p>simply the particle mass divided by 1 amu.
</p>
<p>In the deep interiors of stars the gases are fully ionized, i.e. for each hydrogen
</p>
<p>nucleus, there also exists a free electron, while for each helium nucleus, there are
</p>
<p>two free electrons. We therefore have a mixture of two gases, that of the nuclei
</p>
<p>(which in itself can consist of more than one component) and that of the free
</p>
<p>electrons. The mixture can be treated similarly to a one-component gas, if all single
</p>
<p>components obey the perfect gas equation.
</p>
<p>We consider a mixture of fully ionized nuclei. The chemical composition can be
</p>
<p>described by specifying all Xi ; the weight fractions of nuclei of type i; which have

<p>By introducing the mean molecular weight, we are able to treat a mixture of perfect
</p>
<p>gases as a uniform perfect gas. We just have to replace the molecular weight in
</p>
<p>(4.22) by the mean molecular weight. In the case of pure (fully ionized) hydrogen
</p>
<p>with XH = 1, �H = 1, ZH = 1, we have � D 1=2, while for a fully ionized helium
gas (XHe = 1, �He = 4, ZHe = 2), we find � D 4=3.
</p>
<p>Equation (4.27) can be easily modified for the partial gas consisting of the ions
</p>
<p>only, or equivalently, for the case of a neutral gas where all the electrons are still in
</p>
<p>the atom. In (4.25) we just have to replace 1 + Zi by 1 and we find

<p>Here we have dealt with the cases of full ionization and of no ionization at all. In

<p>At this point we also define the mean molecular weight per free electron �e; a

<p>4.4 Energy Conservation in Stars
</p>
<p>By l.r/ we define1 the net energy per second passing outward through a sphere
</p>
<p>of radius r . The function l is zero at r D 0, since there can be no infinite energy
source at the centre, while l reaches the total luminosity L of the star at the surface.
</p>
<p>In between, l can be a complicated function, depending on the distribution of the
</p>
<p>sources and sinks of energy.
</p>
<p>The function l comprises the energies transported by radiation, conduction, and
</p>
<p>convection, transport mechanisms with which we shall deal in Chaps. 5 and 7. Not
</p>
<p>included is a possible energy flux by neutrinos, which normally have negligible
</p>
<p>interaction with the stellar matter (see below). Included in l are only those fluxes
</p>
<p>which require a temperature gradient.
</p>
<p>Consider a spherical mass shell of radius r; thickness dr; and mass dm, as
</p>
<p>indicated in Fig. 4.1. The energy per second entering the shell at the inner surface
</p>
<p>is l , while l C dl is the energy per second leaving it through the outer surface.
The surplus power dl can be provided by nuclear reactions, by cooling, or by
</p>
<p>compression or expansion of the mass shell.
</p>
<p>1In many textbooks our function l is denoted by Lr :</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>32 4 Conservation of Energy
</p>
<p>We first consider a stationary case in which dl is due to the release of energy
</p>
<p>from nuclear reactions only. Let " be the nuclear energy released per unit mass per
</p>
<p>second; then
</p>

D ": (4.43)
</p>
<p>In general " depends on temperature and density and on the abundance of the
</p>
<p>different nuclear species that react, described in detail in Chap. 18.
</p>
<p>If we relax the condition of time independence, then dl can become non-zero
</p>
<p>even if there are no nuclear reactions. A non-stationary shell can change its internal
</p>
<p>energy, and it can exchange mechanical work .P dV / with the neighbouring shells.
</p>
<p>Instead of (4.43) we write
</p>
<p>dq D
�
" � @l
</p>
<p>@m
</p>
<p>�

Let us now turn to the problem of neutrino losses. These can be formed in
</p>
<p>appreciable amounts in a star either as a by-product of nuclear energy generation or
</p>
<p>by other reactions. Stellar material is normally transparent to neutrinos and therefore</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.5 Global and Local Energy Conservation 33
</p>
<p>they can easily &ldquo;tunnel&rdquo; the energy they have to the surface. This is the reason we
</p>
<p>have excluded the energy flux due to neutrinos from l . The only mass elements
</p>
<p>affected by the neutrinos are at the place of their creation, where they act as an
</p>
<p>energy sink; hence "� is used to represent the energy taken per unit mass per second
</p>
<p>from the stellar material in the form of neutrinos. In general, the energy lost by
</p>
<p>neutrinos in nuclear reactions is already taken into account in the net energy Q

<p>As mentioned at the beginning of Sect. 4.4, the boundary values of l are l D 0 at the

the right-hand side of (4.48) may be positive or negative; l can even become larger

<p>since part of it is used to expand the star ."g &lt; 0); and strong neutrino losses can
</p>
<p>make l &lt; 0 in certain parts of the stellar interior (see Sect. 33.5).
</p>
<p>The energy per second carried away from the star by neutrinos is often called the

<p>�n � �KH � �hydr ; (4.60)
</p>
<p>which is not only true for the Sun, but for all stars that survive by hydrogen
</p>
<p>and helium burning. We emphasize this point, since under these circumstances
</p>
<p>the equation of energy conservation (4.46) can be simplified. As an illustration,
</p>
<p>we assume that the star changes its properties considerably within the timescale

</p>
<p>instance, be due to exhaustion of nuclear fuel or artificial &ldquo;squeezing&rdquo; of the
</p>

<p>In the case � � �KH, the terms in (4.63) and (4.64) are small compared to those

<p>be neglected (j"gj � "), and the energy equation is @l=@m D ", as in (4.43). This
occurs if, for instance, the consumption of hydrogen and helium steers the evolution,

<p>models which are said to be in complete equilibrium (i.e. mechanical and thermal

<p>equilibrium).
</p>
<p>In the case � � �KH, the right-hand sides of (4.63) and (4.64) are large compared
to those of (4.61) and (4.62). Therefore in (4.46) the last two terms containing the
</p>
<p>time derivatives must (at least very nearly) cancel each other, which means that
</p>
<p>dq=dt � 0, or the change is nearly adiabatic. Note that a relatively small deviation
from the strict adiabatic change can still be of the order "; and therefore "g cannot be
</p>
<p>neglected in the energy equation. An example for this case is a star pulsating with
</p>
<p>the timescale � D �hydr � �KH (see Chaps. 40 and 41). The variable luminosity of a
pulsating star, for instance, is not due to changes of " but of "g.
</p>
<p>Here we have assumed the simplest case, namely that the star changes more or
</p>
<p>less uniformly. The situation can be much more complicated if, for example, only
</p>
<p>parts of the star are affected and local timescales have to be considered which may
</p>
<p>be quite different.</p>

</p>
<p>Transport of Energy by Radiation
</p>
<p>and Conduction
</p>
<p>The energy the star radiates away so profusely from its surface is generally
</p>
<p>replenished from reservoirs situated in the very hot central region. This requires
</p>
<p>an effective transfer of energy through the stellar material, which is possible owing
</p>
<p>to the existence of a non-vanishing temperature gradient in the star. Depending on
</p>
<p>the local physical situation, the transfer can occur mainly via radiation, conduction,
</p>
<p>and convection. In any case, certain &ldquo;particles&rdquo; (photons, atoms, electrons, &ldquo;blobs&rdquo;
</p>
<p>of matter) are exchanged between hotter and cooler parts, and their mean free path
</p>
<p>together with the temperature gradient of the surroundings will play a decisive role.
</p>
<p>The equation for the energy transport, written as a condition for the temperature
</p>
<p>gradient necessary for the required energy flow, will supply our next basic equation
</p>
<p>for the stellar structure.
</p>
<p>5.1 Radiative Transport of Energy
</p>
<p>5.1.1 Basic Estimates
</p>
<p>Rough estimates show important features of the radiative transfer in stellar interiors
</p>
<p>and justify an enormous simplification of the formalism.
</p>
<p>Let us first estimate the mean free path `ph of a photon at an &ldquo;average&rdquo; point
</p>
<p>inside a star like the Sun:
</p>

the value for electron scattering, � � 0:4 cm2 g�1 (see Chap. 17). Using this and the

<p>mean density of matter in the Sun, N%ˇ D 3Mˇ=4�R3ˇ D 1:4 g cm�3, we obtain a
mean free path of only
</p>
<p>`ph � 2 cm ; (5.2)
</p>
<p>i.e. stellar matter is very opaque.
</p>
<p>The typical temperature gradient in the star can be roughly estimated by
</p>
<p>averaging between centre (Tc � 107K) and surface (T0 � 104K):
</p>
<p>�T
</p>
<p>�r
� Tc � T0
</p>
<p>Rˇ
� 1:4 � 10�4Kcm�1 : (5.3)
</p>
<p>The radiation field at a given point is emitted from a small, nearly isothermal sur-
</p>
<p>rounding, the differences of temperature being only of order �T D `ph.dT=dr/ �
3�10�4K. Since the energy density of radiation is u � T 4, the relative anisotropy of
the radiation at a point with T D 107K is 4�T=T � 10�10. The situation in stellar
interiors must obviously be very close to thermal equilibrium, and the radiation very
</p>
<p>close to that of a black body. Nevertheless, the small remaining anisotropy can easily
</p>
<p>be the carrier of the stars&rsquo; huge luminosity: this fraction of 10�10 of the flux emitted
from 1 cm2 of a black body of T D 107K is still 103 times larger than the flux at the
solar surface (6 � 1010 erg cm�2 s�1/. Radiative transport of energy occurs via the
non-vanishing net flux, i.e. via the surplus of the outwards-going radiation (emitted
</p>
<p>from somewhat hotter material below) over the inwards-going radiation (emitted
</p>
<p>from less-hot material above).
</p>
<p>5.1.2 Diffusion of Radiative Energy
</p>
<p>The above estimates have shown that for radiative transport in stars, the mean
</p>
<p>free path `ph of the &ldquo;transporting particles&rdquo; (photons) is very small compared
</p>
<p>to the characteristic length R (stellar radius) over which the transport extends:
</p>
<p>`ph=Rˇ � 3 � 10�11. In this case, the transport can be treated as a diffusion
process, which yields an enormous simplification of the formalism. We derive the
</p>
<p>corresponding equation by analogy to those for particle diffusion. A more rigorous
</p>
<p>derivation can be found in any textbook about radiation transport, for instance, in
</p>
<p>Chaps. 2 and 8 of Weiss et al. (2004).
</p>
<p>The diffusive flux j of particles (per unit area and time) between places of
</p>
<p>different particle density n is given by

<p>of the photons will there become comparable with (and finally larger than) the

<p>down, and one has to solve the far more complicated full set of transport equations

</p>
<p>5.1.3 The Rosseland Mean for ��

<p>The above equations are independent of the frequency �IF and l are quantities
integrated over all frequencies, so that the quantity � must represent a &ldquo;propermean&rdquo;

<p>the Rosseland mean is formally the harmonic mean of �� with the weighting

<p>from atomic physics.
</p>
<p>In order to see the physical interpretation of the Rosseland mean, we rewrite

<p>(5.13) with the help of (5.14)&ndash;(5.16):
</p>
<p>F � D �

</p>

rT : (5.21)
</p>
<p>This shows that, for a given point in the star (% and rT given), the integrand in
</p>
<p>(5.19) is at all frequencies proportional to the net flux F � of energy. The Rosseland
</p>
<p>mean therefore favours the frequency ranges of maximum energy flux. One could
</p>
<p>say that an average transparency is evaluated rather than an opacity&ndash;which is
</p>
<p>plausible, since it is to be used in an equation describing the transfer of energy
</p>
<p>rather than its blocking.
</p>
<p>One can also easily evaluate the frequency where the weighting function @B=@T
</p>
<p>has its maximum. From (5.15) one finds that, for given a temperature, @B=@T �
x4ex.ex � 1/�2 with the usual definition x D h�=kT . Differentiation with respect
to x shows that the maximum of @B=@T is close to x D 4.
</p>
<p>The way we have defined the Rosseland mean �, which is a kind of weighted
</p>
<p>harmonic mean value, has the uncomfortable consequence that the opacity � of a
</p>
<p>mixture of two gases having the opacities �1; �2 is not the sum of the opacities:
</p>
<p>� &curren; �1 C �2.
Therefore, in order to find � for a mixture containing the weight fractions X of
</p>
<p>hydrogen and Y of helium, the mean opacities of the two single gases are of no use.
</p>
<p>Rather one has to add the frequency-dependentopacities �� D X��HCY��He before
calculating the Rosseland mean. For any new abundance ratio X=Y the averaging
</p>
<p>over the frequency has to be carried out separately.
</p>
<p>In the above we have characterized the energy flux due to the diffusion of photons
</p>
<p>by F . Since in the following we shall encounter other mechanisms for energy
</p>
<p>transport, from now, on we shall specify this radiative flux by the vector F rad.

<p>Correspondingly we shall use �rad instead of �, etc.</p>

<p>42 5 Transport of Energy by Radiation and Conduction
</p>
<p>5.2 Conductive Transport of Energy
</p>
<p>In heat conduction, energy transfer occurs via collisions during the random thermal
</p>
<p>motion of the particles (electrons and nuclei in completely ionized matter, otherwise
</p>
<p>atoms or molecules). A basic estimate similar to that in Sect. 5.1.1 shows that in
</p>
<p>&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; stellar matter (i.e. in a non-degenerate gas), conduction has no chance of
</p>
<p>taking over an appreciable part of the total energy transport. Although the collisional
</p>
<p>cross sections of these charged particles are rather small at the high temperatures in
</p>
<p>stellar interiors (10�18 � � � 10�20 cm2 per particle), the large density . N% D 1:4 g cm�3
in the Sun) results in mean free paths several orders of magnitude less than those for
</p>
<p>photons; and the velocity of the particles is only a few per cent of c: Therefore the
</p>
<p>coefficient of diffusion (5.5) is much smaller than that for photons.
</p>
<p>The situation becomes quite different, however, for the cores of evolved stars
</p>
<p>(see Chap. 33), where the electron gas is highly degenerate. The density can be as
</p>
<p>large as 106 g cm�3. But degeneracy makes the electrons much faster, since they are
pushed up close to the Fermi energy; and degeneracy increases the mean free path
</p>
<p>considerably, since the quantum cells of phase space are filled up such that collisions
</p>
<p>in which the momentum is changed become rather improbable. Then the coefficient
</p>
<p>of diffusion (which is proportional to the product of mean free path and particle
</p>
<p>velocity) is large, and heat conduction can become so efficient that it short-circuits
</p>
<p>the radiative transfer (see Sect. 17.6).
</p>
<p>The energy flux Fcd due to heat conduction may be written as
</p>
<p>Fcd D �kcdrT : (5.22)
</p>
<p>The sum of the conductive flux Fcd and the radiative flux Frad as defined in (5.9) is
</p>
<p>F D Frad C Fcd D �.krad C kcd/rT ; (5.23)
</p>
<p>which shows immediately the benefit of writing the radiative flux in (5.9) formally
</p>
<p>as an equation of heat conduction. On the other hand, we can just as well write the
</p>
<p>conductive coefficient kcd formally in analogy to (5.10) as
</p>
<p>kcd D
4ac
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>T 3
</p>
<p>�cd%
; (5.24)
</p>
<p>hence defining the &ldquo;conductive opacity&rdquo; �cd. Then (5.23) becomes

<p>which shows that we arrive formally at the same type of equation (5.11) as in the
</p>
<p>pure radiative case, if we replace 1=� there by 1=�rad C 1=�cd. Again the result
is plausible, since the mechanism of transport that provides the largest flux will</p>

</p>
<p>in which conduction effects are now included. Note the difference in definition
</p>
<p>and meaning of rrad and of rad introduced in (4.21), which concerns not only
their (in general different) numerical values. As just explained, rrad means a
spatial derivative (connecting P and T in two neighbouring mass shells), while
</p>
<p>rad describes the thermal variation of one and the same mass element during its
adiabatic compression. Only in special cases .d lnT=d lnP/ and rad will have the
same value, and we then speak of an &ldquo;adiabatic stratification&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>We will use rrad also in connection with more general cases (other modes
of energy transport like convection as in Chap. 7, deviation from hydrostatic
</p>
<p>equilibrium). It then means the gradient to which a radiative, hydrostatic layer
</p>
<p>would adjust at a corresponding point (same values of P; T; l;m), or simply an
</p>
<p>abbreviation for the expression on the right-hand side of (5.28), which is valid only

<p>for hydrostatic equilibrium and as long as an effective � as in (5.25) can be defined.

<p>If we put the right-hand side equal to zero, then (5.30) has the form of the equation of

<p>1987) . There exists a vast amount of mathematical theory associated with this
</p>
<p>equation, especially for the case where � is constant. For example, one can define
</p>
<p>an initial-value problem with given T D T .x/ at t D 0. How, then, does this initial
temperature profile evolve in time? There are classical methods for determining
</p>
<p>T D T .x; t/ for t &gt; 0. One of the basic results is that one can start with an
exciting temperature profile T .x/; for instance, one which resembles the skyline
</p>
<p>of Manhattan or the panorama of the Alps, and after some time, the temperature
</p>
<p>profile always looks like the landscape of Nebraska: T .x; t/ approaches the limit
</p>
<p>solution T D constant after sufficient time.
One can easily estimate the timescale over which (5.31) demands considerable
</p>
<p>changes of an initially given temperature profile, the timescale of thermal adjust-
</p>
<p>ment, by replacing in (5.31) @T by 4T , @x by a characteristic length d , and @t
by �adj:
</p>
<p>�adj D

</p>
<p>�
d 2 ; (5.32)
</p>
<p>where d is a characteristic length over which the (initially given) temperature
</p>
<p>variation changes. Obviously, only temperature profiles with variations over small
</p>
<p>distances can change rapidly in time.
</p>
<p>The inhomogeneous term on the right of (5.30) is a source term. It takes
</p>
<p>into account that energy can be added everywhere by nuclear reactions or by
</p>
<p>compression. In the case of the rod it would correspond to extra heat sources adding
</p>
<p>heat at different values of x: Similarly to (5.32) we can derive a characteristic time

<p>considered a characteristic time of thermal adjustment of a star or &ndash; in other words &ndash;
</p>
<p>the time it takes a thermal fluctuation to travel from centre to surface.
</p>
<p>In spite of the indicated equivalence of �adj and �KH, it is often advisable
</p>
<p>to consider �adj separately, in particular if it is to be applied to parts of a star
</p>
<p>only. For example, we will encounter evolved stars with isothermal cores of very
</p>
<p>high conductivity (Chap. 33). The luminosity there is zero so that formally the
</p>
<p>corresponding �KH becomes infinite. The decisive timescale that in fact enforces
</p>
<p>the isothermal situation is the very small �adj. The difference can be characterized
</p>
<p>as follows: how much energy may be transported after a temperature perturbation
</p>
<p>is often much more important than how much energy is flowing in the unperturbed
</p>
<p>configuration.
</p>
<p>5.4 Thermal Properties of the Piston Model
</p>
<p>We now investigate the thermal properties of the piston model discussed in Sects. 2.7
</p>
<p>and 3.2 by first assuming that the gas of mass m� in the container is thermally
isolated from the surroundings. If the piston is moved, the gas changes adiabatically,
</p>
<p>i.e.
</p>
<p>dQ D m�duC PdV D 0 ; (5.35)
</p>
<p>dQ being the heat added to the total mass of the gas. For a perfect gas the energy
</p>
<p>per unit mass is u D cvT; and for adiabatic conditions, with V D Ah, this leads to
</p>
<p>dQ D cvm�dT C PA dh D 0 : (5.36)
</p>
<p>We now relax the adiabatic condition in three ways. First, we allow a small leak
</p>
<p>through which heat (but no gas) can escape from the interior (gas at temperature T )
</p>
<p>to the surroundings (at temperature Ts/ see Fig. 2.2. The corresponding heat flow
</p>
<p>will be �.T�Ts/, where� is a measure of the heat conduction at the leak indicated in
Fig. 2.2. Second, in order to make the gas more similar to stellar matter, we assume
</p>
<p>the release of nuclear energy with a rate ": Third, we assume that a radiative energy
</p>
<p>flux F penetrates the gas and that the energy �Fm� is absorbed per second. The
energy balance of the gas in the stationary case then can be expressed by
</p>
<p>"m� C �Fm� D �.T � Ts/ : (5.37)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>46 5 Transport of Energy by Radiation and Conduction
</p>
<p>In general the heat dQ added to the gas within the time interval dt is
</p>
<p>dQ D Œ"m� C �Fm� � �.T � Ts/&#141;dt ; (5.38)
</p>
<p>and, if we compare (5.36) and (5.38), we find that

</p>
<p>dt
D "m� C �m�F � �.T � Ts/ : (5.39)
</p>
<p>This is the equation of energy conservation of the gas.
</p>
<p>If we assume " D � D 0, then (5.39) has only one time-independent solution:
T D Ts. What is the timescale of this adjustment of T ?
</p>
<p>The two time derivatives on the left-hand side of (5.39) give the same estimate
</p>
<p>for � ; indeed a change of h occurs only as a consequence of, and together with, the
</p>
<p>change of T . For our rough estimate we can therefore replace the left-hand side of
</p>
<p>(5.39) by cv�Tm
�=T where�T D jT � Tsj:
</p>
<p>cvm
��T=� � �jT � Tsj : (5.40)
</p>
<p>For the timescale by which �T decays we obtain
</p>
<p>�adj � cvm�=� ; (5.41)
</p>
<p>which is the time it takes the gas to adjust its temperature to that of the surroundings.
</p>
<p>This timescale for our piston model plays a role similar to the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz
</p>
<p>timescale in stars. For sufficiently small � (sufficiently large �adj), we have �hydr �
�adj, similar to the situation in stars, where �hydr � �KH.</p>

</p>
<p>Stability Against Local, Non-spherical
</p>
<p>Perturbations
</p>
<p>We have based our treatment on the assumption of strict spherical symmetry,
</p>
<p>meaning that all functions and variables (including velocities) are constant on
</p>
<p>concentric spheres. In reality there will arise small fluctuations on such a sphere,
</p>
<p>for example, simply from the thermal motion of the gas particles. Such local
</p>
<p>perturbations of the average state may be ignored if they do not grow. But in a star
</p>
<p>sometimes small perturbations may grow and give rise to macroscopic local (non-
</p>
<p>spherical) motions that are also statistically distributed over the sphere. In the basic
</p>
<p>equations the assumption of spherical symmetry can still be kept if we interpret the
</p>
<p>variables as proper average values over a concentric sphere.
</p>
<p>However, these motions have to be considered carefully because they can have a
</p>
<p>strong influence on the stellar structure. They not only mix the stellar material but
</p>
<p>also transport energy: hot gas bubbles rise, while cooler material sinks down, i.e.
</p>
<p>energy transport is by convection, something which is known to play an important
</p>
<p>role in the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Whether convection occurs in a certain region of a star obviously depends on the
</p>
<p>question whether the small perturbations always present will grow or stay small: a
</p>
<p>question of stability. We shall derive criteria which tell us whether stellar material
</p>
<p>at a certain depth is stable or not. Depending on the physical conditions one can
</p>
<p>make different simplifying assumptions which lead to different stability problems.
</p>
<p>The following dynamical problem covers most of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; cases in stars.
</p>
<p>6.1 Dynamical Instability
</p>
<p>The kind of stability we are discussing here is based on the assumption that the
</p>
<p>moving mass elements have no time to exchange appreciable amounts of heat
</p>
<p>with the surroundings and therefore move adiabatically. This type of stability (or
</p>
<p>instability) is called dynamical. We will soon learn that there are other types of
</p>
<p>instability.

<p>48 6 Stability Against Local, Non-spherical Perturbations
</p>
<p>First, we consider the possibility that the physical quantities (temperature,
</p>
<p>density, etc.) may not be exactly constant on the surface of a concentric sphere
</p>
<p>but rather may show certain fluctuations. In the global problem of stellar structure,
</p>
<p>one then has only to interpret the previously used functions as proper averages. For
</p>
<p>the local description, we shall simply represent a fluctuation by a mass &ldquo;element&rdquo;
</p>
<p>(subscript e) in which the functions have constant, but somewhat different, values
</p>
<p>than in the average &ldquo;surroundings&rdquo; (subscript s). For any quantity A we define the
</p>
<p>difference DA between element and surroundings1 as
</p>
<p>DA WD Ae � As : (6.1)
</p>
<p>One can easily imagine an initial fluctuation of temperature, for example, a slightly
</p>
<p>hotter element with DT &gt; 0. Normally one could then also expect an excess of
</p>
<p>pressure DP. However, the element will expand immediately until pressure balance
</p>
<p>with the surroundings is restored, and since this expansion occurs with the velocity
</p>
<p>of sound, it is usually much more rapid than any other motion of the element.
</p>
<p>Therefore we can assume here (and in the following) that the element always
</p>
<p>remains in pressure balance with its surroundings:
</p>
<p>DP D 0 : (6.2)
</p>
<p>Consequently the assumed DT &gt; 0 requires that, for a perfect gas with % �
P=T;D% &lt; 0, i.e. the element is lighter than the surrounding material, and
</p>
<p>the buoyancy forces will lift it upwards: temperature fluctuations are obviously
</p>
<p>accompanied by local motions of elements in a radial direction.
</p>
<p>So, we can also take a radial shift �r &gt; 0 of the element as the initial
</p>
<p>perturbation for testing the stability of a layer. Consider an element that was in
</p>
<p>complete equilibrium with the surroundings at its original position r but has now
</p>
<p>been lifted to r C�r (cf. Fig. 6.1). In general its density will differ from that of its
new surroundings by

</p>
<p>A finite D% gives the radial component Kr D �gD% of a buoyancy force K
(per unit of volume), where g again is the absolute value of the acceleration of
</p>
<p>gravity. If D% &lt; 0, the element is lighter and Kr &gt; 0, i.e. K is directed upwards.
</p>
<p>This situation is obviously unstable, since the element is lifted further, the original
</p>
<p>perturbation being increased.
</p>
<p>1Note that we use the subscript s, which is different from s used for the specific entropy in other

<p>r C�r
</p>
<p>If on the other hand D% &gt; 0, then Kr &lt; 0, i.e. K is directed downwards. The
</p>
<p>element, which is heavier than its new surroundings, is drawn back to its original
</p>
<p>position, the perturbation is removed, and the layer is stable. As the condition for

</p>
<p>Unfortunately this criterion is highly impractical, since it requires knowledge of
</p>
<p>density gradients that do not appear in the basic equations. It is therefore preferable
</p>
<p>to turn to temperature gradients as used in the equations of radiative and conductive
</p>
<p>transport. In order to evaluate .d%=dr/e correctly, we would have to take into
</p>
<p>account the possible energy exchange between the element and its surroundings.
</p>
<p>For simplicity let us here assume that no such exchange of energy occurs, i.e. that
</p>
<p>the element rises adiabatically. This is very close to reality for the deep interior of
</p>
<p>a star (see Chap. 7).
</p>
<p>In order to transform the gradients of % into those of T , we write the equation of

</p>
<p>material. In both cases they are spatial derivatives in which the variations of T and�

<p>with depth are considered and P is taken as a measure of depth. The quantity re
describes the variation of T in the element during its motion, where the position
</p>
<p>of the element is measured by P: In this sense re and rad are similar, since
both describe the temperature variation of a gas undergoing pressure variations;
</p>
<p>on the other hand, rrad and r� describe the spatial variation of T and � in the
surroundings.

<p>With the definitions (6.10) the condition (6.9) for stability becomes

<p>6.1 Dynamical Instability 51
</p>
<p>In (5.27) and (5.28) we defined rrad, which describes the temperature gradient for
the case that the energy is transported by radiation (or conduction) only. Therefore in
</p>
<p>a layer that indeed transports all energy by radiation the actual gradient r is equal
to rrad. Let us test such a layer for its stability and assume the elements change
adiabatically: re D rad; the radiation layer is stable if
</p>
<p>rrad &lt; rad C

</p>
<p>ı
r� ; (6.12)
</p>
<p>a form known as the Ledoux criterion (named after Paul Ledoux) for dynamical
</p>
<p>stability. In a region with homogeneous chemical composition, r� D 0, and one
has then simply the famous Schwarzschild criterion for dynamical stability (named
</p>
<p>after Karl Schwarzschild):
</p>
<p>rrad &lt; rad : (6.13)
</p>
<p>If in the criteria (6.12) and (6.13) the left-hand side is larger than the right, the
</p>
<p>layer is dynamically unstable. If they are equal, one speaks of marginal stability.
</p>
<p>The difference between the two criteria obviously plays a role only in regions
</p>
<p>where the chemical composition varies radially. We will see that such regions occur
</p>
<p>in the interior of evolving stars, where heavier elements are usually produced below
</p>
<p>the lighter ones, such that the molecular weight � increases inwards (as the pressure
</p>
<p>does) and r� &gt; 0. Then the last term in inequality (6.12) obviously has a stabilizing
effect (' and ı are both positive). This is plausible since the element carries its
</p>
<p>heavier material upwards into lighter surroundings and gravity will tend to draw it
</p>
<p>back to its original place.
</p>
<p>If these criteria favour stability, then no convective motions will occur, and the
</p>
<p>whole flux will indeed be carried by radiation, i.e. the actual gradient at such a
</p>
<p>place is equal to the radiative one: r D rrad. If they favour instability, then small
perturbations will increase to finite amplitude until the whole region boils with
</p>
<p>convective motions that carry part of the flux&ndash;and the actual gradient has to be
</p>
<p>determined in a manner described in Chap. 7. This instability can be caused either
</p>
<p>by the fact that rrad has become too high (large flux or very opaque matter), or else
by a depression of rad; both cases occur in stars. And, finally, in a twilight zone,
where one of the two criteria (6.12) and (6.13) says stability and the other one says
</p>
<p>instability, strange things may happen (see, for instance, Sects. 6.3 and 30.4.2).
</p>
<p>Note that (6.12) and (6.13) are strictly local criteria, which means good and bad
</p>
<p>news. They are very practical since they can be evaluated easily for any given place
</p>
<p>by using the local values of P; T; % only, without bothering about other parts of
</p>
<p>the star. And in most cases this will give satisfactory answers. In critical cases,
</p>
<p>however, this may not be sufficient. Strictly speaking, convective motions are not
</p>
<p>only dependent on the local forces (which are solely regarded by the criteria),
</p>
<p>but must be coupled (by momentum transfer, inertia, the equation of continuity)
</p>
<p>to their neighbouring layers. And in extreme cases the reaction of the whole star</p>

<p>52 6 Stability Against Local, Non-spherical Perturbations
</p>
<p>against a local perturbation should be taken into account. An obvious example is the
</p>
<p>precise determination of the border of a convective zone, where elements that were
</p>
<p>accelerated elsewhere &ldquo;shoot over&rdquo; until their motion is braked. We will come back
</p>
<p>later to such problems when they arise (see Sect. 30.4.1).
</p>
<p>We can immediately derive a qualitative relation between the different gradients.
</p>
<p>They are best visualized in a diagram such as Fig. 6.2, where lnT is plotted
</p>
<p>against lnP (decreasing outwards) for an unstable layer violating the Schwarzschild
</p>
<p>criterion. In such a diagram, an adiabatic change follows a line with slope rad, the
changes in a rising element are given by a line with slopere, while the stratifications
in the surroundings and in a radiative layer are shown by lines with slopes r and
rrad, respectively.
</p>
<p>Suppose we have convection in a chemically homogeneous layer (r� D 0). The
criterion (6.11) must be violated, i.e. r &gt; re. If some part of the flux is carried
by convection, then the actual gradient r &lt; rrad, since only a part of the total
flux is left for radiative transfer. Consider a rising element that has started from a
</p>
<p>point with P0; T0. In Fig. 6.2 this element moves downwards to the left along the
</p>
<p>line with slope re. Since r &gt; re, the element (although cooling) will obviously
have an increasing temperature excess over its new surroundings (the temperature
</p>
<p>of which changes with r). Therefore it will radiate energy into its surroundings,
which means that the element cools more than adiabatically: re &gt; rad. Combining
these inequalities, we arrive at the relation illustrated in Fig. 6.2:
</p>
<p>rrad &gt; r &gt; re &gt; rad : (6.14)
</p>
<p>The fact that re must always be between rad and r of the surroundings shows that
the criteria (6.12) and (6.13) are also to be used in near-surface regions, where the
</p>
<p>rising elements lose much of their energy by radiation.
</p>
<p>6.2 Oscillation of a Displaced Element
</p>
<p>In a dynamically stable layer a displaced mass element is pushed back by buoyancy.
</p>
<p>When coming back to its original position, it has gained momentum and will
</p>
<p>overshoot and therefore start to oscillate. In the following we shall discuss this
</p>
<p>oscillation.
</p>
<p>Consider a mass element lifted from its normal (equilibrium) position in the
</p>
<p>radial direction by an amount�r (see Fig. 6.1). There it has an excess of densityD%
</p>
<p>over its new surroundings given by (6.3), which for balance of pressure .DP D 0)

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>54 6 Stability Against Local, Non-spherical Perturbations
</p>
<p>We see immediately what happens in an unstable layer. If the Ledoux criterion
</p>
<p>(6.12) [or the Schwarzschild criterion (6.13) for r� D 0] is violated, then (6.18)
gives !2ad &lt; 0, such that !ad is imaginary and the time dependence of �r is given
</p>
<p>by the factor exp(�t) with a real � &gt; 0. Instead of oscillating, the displaced element
</p>
<p>moves away exponentially.
</p>
<p>6.3 Vibrational Stability
</p>
<p>In a dynamically stable layer an oscillating mass element has, in general,DT &curren; 0.
If DT &gt; 0, it will lose heat to its surrounding by radiation; if DT &lt; 0, it will
</p>
<p>gain heat. This means it will not move adiabatically. We consider the deviation
</p>
<p>from adiabaticity to be small, which means that the thermal adjustment time of
</p>
<p>the element is large compared to the period of the oscillation; then the temperature
</p>
<p>excess of the element can be written as

</p>
<p>Dynamical stability means that D%=�r &gt; 0 and therefore (6.11) is fulfilled. If the
</p>
<p>layer is chemically homogeneous, then r� D 0, and (6.11) becomes re � r &gt; 0,
such that (6.19) gives DT &lt; 0 for �r &gt; 0. Above its equilibrium position the
</p>
<p>element is cooler than the surroundings and receives energy by radiation. This
</p>
<p>reducesre�r;D%, and the restoring force, such that the element is less accelerated
back towards the equilibrium position. The result will be an oscillation with slowly
</p>
<p>decreasing amplitude. Formally this radiative damping shows up as a small positive
</p>
<p>imaginary part of ! in (6.17) after the exchange of heat with the surroundings is
</p>
<p>included in (6.16). The oscillatory part (real part of !/ is still very close to the
</p>
<p>adiabatic value (6.18).
</p>
<p>If the stable layer is inhomogeneous with r� &gt; 0, it can be that with (6.11)
re � r &gt; 0 also (both criteria for stability are fulfilled), i.e. we find again that
DT &lt; 0 for �r &gt; 0 and radiative damping as before. However, we can also
</p>
<p>imagine a situation with re � r &lt; 0 in spite of (6.11) for large enough r�. Then
DT &gt; 0 for �r &gt; 0 according to (6.19), and the lifted element, being hotter
</p>
<p>than its surroundings, will now lose energy by radiation. This increases re � r,
D%, and the restoring force, and the element will oscillate with slowly increasing
</p>
<p>amplitude. This is an over-stability, or vibrational instability. The difficulties in this
</p>
<p>strange situation are obvious [it being the above mentioned twilight zone between
</p>
<p>the two criteria (6.12) and (6.13)]. The growing oscillation may lead to a chemical
</p>
<p>mixing of elements and surroundings and thus decrease, or eventually even destroy,
</p>
<p>the stabilizing gradient r�. But then again, it is not clear whether in such critical</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.4 The Thermal Adjustment Time 55
</p>
<p>situations a local analysis suffices at all. The reaction of other layers of the star
</p>
<p>might provide enough damping to suppress the over-stability.
</p>
<p>With these considerations it follows that we have to distinguish between dynami-
</p>
<p>cal stability and vibrational stability. The first applies to purely adiabatic behaviour
</p>
<p>of the moving mass, while the second takes heat exchange into account. A layer
</p>
<p>with a temperature gradient r such that the Ledoux criterion is fulfilled but the
Schwarzschild criterion is not, i.e.
</p>
<p>rad &lt; r &lt; rad C
'
</p>
<p>ı
r� ; (6.20)
</p>
<p>is dynamically stable but vibrationally unstable.
</p>
<p>A dynamical instability grows on a timescale given by .HP =g/
1=2; while in the
</p>
<p>case of a vibrational instability, the growth of amplitude is governed by the time it
</p>
<p>takes a mass element to adjust thermally to its surrounding, i.e. by the fraction of the
</p>
<p>total energy of the moving element lost by radiation per unit time. In the following
</p>
<p>we shall estimate this timescale �adj.
</p>
<p>6.4 The Thermal Adjustment Time
</p>
<p>Let us consider a mass element with DT &gt; 0, i.e. one that will radiate into the
</p>
<p>surroundings. Superposed onto the radial energy flux F ; carrying energy from the
</p>
<p>stellar interior to the surface, there will be a local, non-radial flux f , carrying
</p>
<p>the surplus energy of the element to its surroundings. According to (5.9) and
</p>
<p>(5.10), the absolute value f of the radiative flux from the element due to its excess
</p>
<p>temperature will be

<p>Suppose our element to be a roughly spherical &ldquo;blob&rdquo; with diameter d: We will
</p>
<p>approximate the temperature gradient in the normal direction by @T=@n � 2DT=d .

</p>
<p>Here we can replace @T=@t by @.DT /=@t , since the temperature of the (large)
</p>
<p>surroundings scarcely changes, owing to radiative losses of the blob. Furthermore,
</p>
<p>let V=S � d=6 (as for a sphere); then one obtains from (6.22) and (6.23) that

<p>The second equation follows from a comparison of (6.22)&ndash;(6.24).We see that �adj is
</p>
<p>roughly the excess thermal energy divided by the luminosity, i.e. an equivalent to the
</p>
<p>Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz timescale for a star (3.17). For sufficiently large elements that are
</p>
<p>far enough from a region of marginal stability, one has �adj � 1=!ad, which means
that the radiative losses give only a small deviation from adiabatic oscillations, as
</p>
<p>discussed in Sect. 6.2.
</p>
<p>6.5 Secular Instability
</p>
<p>Even a small exchange of heat between a displaced mass element and its surround-
</p>
<p>ings can lead to another kind of instability, which is called thermal or secular
</p>
<p>instability. We first discuss this qualitatively with an experiment which can easily
</p>
<p>be carried out with water and kitchen equipment.
</p>
<p>In a glass jar containing cold fresh water we carefully pour over a layer of
</p>
<p>warm salty water. The salt increases the specific weight of the upper layer, but the
</p>
<p>warmth shall be enough to reduce (despite the salt content) its specific weight to
</p>
<p>below that of the underlying fresh water. If, owing to a perturbation, a blob of salty
</p>
<p>water is pushed downwards, buoyancy will push it back, i.e. the two layers are then
</p>
<p>dynamically stable.
</p>
<p>But the buoyancy acts as a restoring force only as long as the element stays warm
</p>
<p>during its excursion into the cold layers. On the timescale by which it loses its excess
</p>
<p>temperature, the buoyancy diminishes and the element moves downwards because
</p>
<p>of its salt content. Indeed if one watches the two layers for some time, one can see
</p>
<p>(especially if the salty water is coloured) that small blobs of salty water slowly sink,
</p>
<p>a phenomenon called salt-fingers. It is an instability controlled by the heat leakage
</p>
<p>of the element. This is secular instability. It can not only occur in glass jars, but also
</p>
<p>in stars!
</p>
<p>Consider a blob of stellar matter situated in surroundings of somewhat different,
</p>
<p>but homogeneous, composition, i.e. D� &curren; 0, but r� D 0 (Such a situation can
occur, for example, if two homogeneous layers of different compositions are above
</p>
<p>each other and a blob from one layer is displaced into the other.). The blob is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.5 Secular Instability 57
</p>
<p>supposed to be in mechanical equilibriumwith its surroundings, i.e.DP D D% D 0.
This requires, however, a temperature difference according to (6.5):
</p>

DT
</p>
<p>T

</p>
<p>�
: (6.26)
</p>
<p>For D� &gt; 0, for example, the blob is hotter and therefore radiates towards the
</p>
<p>surroundings; the loss of energy under pressure balance .DP D 0) leads to an
increased density and the blob sinks until again D% D 0. Equation (6.26) is still
valid and, since D�, is unchanged, DT &gt; 0 as before, and so on. Obviously the
</p>
<p>blob will slowly sink (or rise for D� &lt; 0) with a velocity v� such that DT always
</p>
<p>remains constant according to (6.26).
</p>
<p>Owing to radiation, the temperature of the blob changes at the rate&ndash;DT=�adj [see
</p>
<p>(6.24)].While sinking or rising it changes also because of the adiabatic compression
</p>
<p>(or expansion) that occurs as a result of the change of pressure, even in the absence
</p>
<p>of energy exchange. The rate of change of DT can then immediately be written as

<p>Using this and (6.26), together with the condition @.DT /=@t D 0 [which follows

</p>
<p>homogeneous region], we can solve (6.26)&ndash;(6.28) for the velocity and obtain

<p>In this case of thermal instability, therefore, the blob sinks (v� &lt; 0 for D� &gt; 0)
</p>
<p>through a dynamically stable surrounding (rad &gt; 0) with the adjustment timescale
for radiative losses.
</p>
<p>The idea of blobs finding themselves in strange surroundings .D� &gt; 0) is not
</p>
<p>far-fetched. Secular instabilities of the kind discussed here can occur in stars, for
</p>
<p>example, of about one solar mass. After hydrogen has been transformed to helium
</p>
<p>in their cores, their central region is cooled by neutrinos, which take away energy
</p>
<p>without interacting with the stellar matter. The temperature in these stars, therefore,
</p>
<p>is highest somewhere off-centre and decreases towards the stellar surface as well as
</p>
<p>towards the centre. If, then, helium &ldquo;burning&rdquo; is ignited in the region of maximum
</p>
<p>temperature, the newly formed carbon is in a shell surrounding the central core
</p>
<p>(Sects. 33.4 and 33.5). This carbon-enriched shell has a higher molecular weight
</p>
<p>than the regions below: carbon &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; will grow and sink inwards. In later</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>58 6 Stability Against Local, Non-spherical Perturbations
</p>
<p>evolutionary phases, other nuclear reactions, such as neon burning, may ignite off-
</p>
<p>centre, and heavier fingers of material may sink.
</p>
<p>6.6 The Stability of the Piston Model
</p>
<p>Our piston model (Sects. 2.7 and 5.4) shows a stability behaviour in many respects
</p>
<p>similar to that of the blobs.
</p>
<p>We start with the two equations that together with the equation of state describe
</p>
<p>the time dependence of the piston model. These are (2.34) and (5.39), where we
</p>
<p>assume for the sake of simplicity that " D � D 0. The equilibrium state is given by
T D Ts and G� D PA.
</p>
<p>In order to investigate the stability we denote the equilibrium values by the
</p>
<p>subscript &ldquo;0&rdquo; and make small perturbations of the form
</p>
<p>h.t/ D h0.1C xei!t /
</p>
<p>P.t/ D P0.1C pei!t/
</p>
<p>T .t/ D T0.1C #ei!t/ (6.30)
</p>
<p>with jxj; jpj; j#j � 1. We therefore neglect quadratic and higher-order expressions
in these quantities.
</p>
<p>From mass conservation %h = constant and from the perfect gas equation
</p>
<p>P � %T , we obtain
</p>
<p>p D # � x : (6.31)
</p>
<p>We now introduce (6.30) into (2.34) and obtain after linearization and using
</p>
<p>G� D PA
M �h0!
</p>
<p>2x C P0Ap D 0 ; (6.32)
</p>
<p>which with g D P0A=M � and with (6.31) can be replaced by

</p>
<p>while the corresponding perturbation and linearization of (5.39) gives
</p>
<p>i!P0Ah0x C .i!cvm�T0 C �T0/# D 0 : (6.34)
</p>
<p>The two linear homogeneous equations (6.33) and (6.34) for x and # can be solved
</p>
<p>if the determinant vanishes. This condition gives an algebraic equation of third order
</p>
<p>for the eigenvalue !:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.6 The Stability of the Piston Model 59
</p>
<p>The problem becomes simple if we assume that the trapped gas changes
</p>
<p>adiabatically, i.e. if � D 0. Then (6.34), with m�=.Ah0/ D %0 and with the perfect
gas equation, yields
</p>
<p>&lt;
�cv
</p>
<p>x C # D 0 ; (6.35)
</p>
<p>and with &lt;=� D cP � cv (4.33) and cP =cv D &#13;ad (4.37) it follows that
</p>
<p>.&#13;ad � 1/x C # D 0 : (6.36)
</p>
<p>Setting the determinant of the equations (6.33) and (6.36) to zero gives the
</p>
<p>eigenvalue for the adiabatic motion:
</p>
<p>! D ˙!ad; !ad D .&#13;adg=h0/1=2 : (6.37)
</p>
<p>Since ! is real, the adiabatic motion is an oscillation with frequency ! and constant
</p>
<p>amplitude. Therefore in the language of Sect. 6.1 our perfect gas piston model is
</p>
<p>dynamically stable. Note that 1=!ad is of the order of the hydrostatic timescale �hydr
defined in Sect. 2.7.
</p>
<p>How do non-adiabatic effects change the picture? With the � term in (6.34) we
</p>
<p>have, instead of (6.36),
</p>
<p>.&#13;ad � 1/x C
�
1C a
</p>
<p>i!
</p>
<p>�
# D 0 ; (6.38)
</p>
<p>with a D �=.cvm�). Setting the determinant of (6.33) and (6.38) equal to zero now
gives a cubic equation in !: In general ! will be complex.
</p>
<p>We assume � to be small, so that the oscillation frequency must be close to
</p>
<p>the adiabatic value and we can put ! D !ad C �, with j�j � j!adj: If we
neglect higher terms in � and �, we find from the vanishing determinant of the
</p>
<p>system of homogeneous linear equations (6.33) and (6.38) and after some algebraic
</p>
<p>manipulation that

<p>since the exponents of (6.30), i! D i!adCi�, have a negative real part that decreases
the amplitude on a timescale �adj: The piston model with a leak is vibrationally
</p>
<p>stable.
</p>
<p>The cubic equation for ! must have a third root, which we find easily by
</p>
<p>assuming that it describes an evolution so slow that the inertia term in (2.34) can
</p>
<p>be neglected (This has to be checked later.). Then (6.33) has to be replaced by

</p>
<p>which according to (6.31) is equivalent to p D 0. Indeed if the evolution is so slow
that there is always hydrostatic equilibrium, the pressure is given by the (constant)

The third root gives an exponential decay in time of the initial perturbation, the
</p>
<p>timescale being comparable with �adj. If � is sufficiently small and the evolution
</p>
<p>slow, the assumption that the inertia term is negligible is justified.
</p>
<p>Our result (6.41) means that any deviation from thermal equilibrium

<p>Transport of Energy by Convection
</p>
<p>Convective transport of energy means an exchange of energy between hotter and
</p>
<p>cooler layers in a dynamically unstable region through the exchange of macroscopic
</p>
<p>mass elements (&ldquo;blobs&rdquo;, &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo;, &ldquo;convective elements&rdquo;), the hotter of which
</p>
<p>move upwards while the cooler ones descend. The moving mass elements will
</p>
<p>finally dissolve in their new surroundings and thereby deliver their excess (or
</p>
<p>deficiency) of heat. Owing to the high density in stellar interiors, convective
</p>
<p>transport can be very efficient. However, this energy transfer can operate only if
</p>
<p>it finds a sufficient driving mechanism in the form of the buoyancy forces.
</p>
<p>A thorough theoretical treatment of convectivemotions and transport of energy is
</p>
<p>extremely difficult. It is the prototype of the many astrophysical problems in which
</p>
<p>the bottleneck preventing decisive progress is the difficulty involved in solving the
</p>
<p>well-known hydrodynamic equations. For simplifying assumptions, solutions are
</p>
<p>available that may even give reasonable approximations for certain convective flows
</p>
<p>in the laboratory (or in the kitchen). Unfortunately, convection in stars proceeds
</p>
<p>under rather malicious conditions: turbulent motion transports enormous fluxes
</p>
<p>of energy in a very compressible gas, which is stratified in density, pressure,
</p>
<p>temperature, and gravity over many powers of ten. Nevertheless, large efforts have
</p>
<p>been made over many years to solve this notorious problem, and they have partly
</p>
<p>arrived at promising results. Canuto (2008) summarizes the state of the art of models
</p>
<p>for the underlying Navier-Stokes equations, which in the field of oceanography
</p>
<p>and atmospheric sciences have had great success, and which aim at modelling
</p>
<p>the fluctuations around an average state. None of these so-called Reynolds stress
</p>
<p>models, however, has reached a stage where it could provide a procedure easy
</p>
<p>enough to be handled in everyday stellar-structure calculations, and at the same time
</p>
<p>would describe the full properties of convection accurately enough. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, full two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations have also made
</p>
<p>large progress, thanks to the impressive advances in supercomputer technology and
</p>
<p>efficient numerical algorithms (see the review by Kupka 2008). They give valuable
</p>
<p>hints to the true nature of convection and often serve as numerical experiments
</p>
<p>to test the dynamical methods. Nevertheless, these numerical simulations are still
</p>
<p>limited in their size and thus can follow convection in most cases only for a limit

<p>time and only for thin convection zones. But even if these restrictions can be
</p>
<p>foreseen to get relaxed with time, such full hydrodynamical simulations will never
</p>
<p>be used in full stellar evolution models, as they would unnecessarily follow the star&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>evolution on a dynamical timescale, which is so much shorter than the dominant
</p>
<p>nuclear one. Therefore, we limit ourselves exclusively to the description of the old
</p>
<p>so-called &ldquo;mixing-length&rdquo; theory. The reason for this is not that we believe it to
</p>
<p>be sufficient, but it does provide at least a simple method for treating convection
</p>
<p>locally, at any given point of a star. Moreover, empirical tests of the resulting stellar
</p>
<p>models show a surprisingly good agreement with observations. And, finally, even
</p>
<p>this poor approximation shows without any doubt that in the very deep interior of a
</p>
<p>star, a detailed theory is normally not necessary.
</p>
<p>Note that in the following we are dealing only with convection in stars that
</p>
<p>are in hydrostatic equilibrium. We furthermore assume that the convection is time
</p>
<p>independent, which means that it is fully adjusted to the present state of the
</p>
<p>star. Otherwise, a convection theory for rapidly changing regions (time-dependent
</p>
<p>convection) has to be developed.
</p>
<p>Equation (5.28) gives the gradient rrad that would be maintained in a star if the
whole luminosity l had to be transported outwards by radiation only. If convection
</p>
<p>contributes to the energy transport, the actual gradient r will be different (namely
smaller). It is the purpose of this section to estimate r in the case of convection.
</p>
<p>7.1 The Basic Picture
</p>
<p>The mixing-length theory goes back to Ludwig Prandtl, who in 1925 modelled
</p>
<p>a simple picture of convection in complete analogy to molecular heat transfer:
</p>
<p>the transporting &ldquo;particles&rdquo; are macroscopic mass elements (&ldquo;blobs&rdquo;) instead of
</p>
<p>molecules; their mean free path is the &ldquo;mixing length&rdquo; after which the blobs dissolve
</p>
<p>in their new surroundings. Prandtl&rsquo;s theory was adapted for stars by L. Biermann.
</p>
<p>There exist different variations and formulations of the mixing-length theory in the
</p>
<p>literature. Two widely used versions are those by Böhm-Vitense (1958) and Cox
</p>
<p>(see Weiss et al. 2004). We follow here the former one.
</p>
<p>The total energy flux l=4�r2 at a given point in the star consists of the radiative
</p>
<p>flux Frad (in which the conductive flux may already be incorporated) plus the
</p>
<p>convective flux Fcon. Their sum defines according to (5.28) the gradient rrad that
would be necessary to transport the whole flux by radiation:

4acG
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>T 4m
</p>
<p>�P r2
rrad: (7.1)
</p>
<p>However, part of the flux is transported by convection. If the actual gradient of the
</p>
<p>stratification is r, then the radiative flux is obviously only

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.1 The Basic Picture 63
</p>
<p>Note that r is not yet known; in fact, we hope to obtain it as the result of this
consideration. The first step is to derive an expression for Fcon.
</p>
<p>Consider a convective element (a blob) with an excess temperature DT over its
</p>
<p>surroundings. It moves radially with velocity v and remains in complete balance
</p>
<p>of pressure, that is, DP D 0 [see (6.2) and Fig. 6.1]. This gives a local flux of
convective energy
</p>
<p>Fcon D %vcPDT; (7.3)
</p>
<p>which we can take immediately as the correct equation for the average convective
</p>
<p>flux, if we consider vDT replaced by the proper mean over the whole concentric
</p>
<p>sphere. One should be aware that this &ldquo;proper mean&rdquo; comprises most of the
</p>
<p>difficulties for a strict treatment. We adopt the following simple model.
</p>
<p>All elements may have started their motion as very small perturbations only, that
</p>
<p>is, with initial values that can be approximated by DT0 D 0 and v0 D 0. Because
of differences in temperature gradients and buoyancy forces, DT and v increase
</p>
<p>as the element rises (or sinks) until, after moving over a distance `m; the element
</p>
<p>mixes with the surroundings and loses its identity. `m is called the mixing length.
</p>
<p>The elements passing at a given moment through a sphere of constant r will have
</p>
<p>different values of v and DT since they have started their motion at quite different
</p>
<p>distances, from zero to `m. We assume, therefore, that the &ldquo;average&rdquo; element has
</p>
<p>moved `m=2 when passing through the sphere. Then,

</p>
<p>Let us now summarize what we have achieved and describe what is still lacking.
</p>
<p>To start with the latter, we have obviously not yet used any physics that could
</p>
<p>determine the mixing length `m. Since we do not know a reasonable approach
</p>
<p>for this, we shall simply treat `m as a free parameter and make (more or less)
</p>
<p>plausible assumptions for its value (This is typical for all versions of the mixing-
</p>
<p>length approach and in fact also for many others that seem to be less arbitrary at a
</p>
<p>first glance.). In any case, the heat transfer mainly operates via the largest possible
</p>
<p>elements, and they can scarcely move over much more than their own diameter
</p>
<p>before differential forces destroy their identity.
</p>
<p>Now, however, the prospect looks quite favourable: we have obtained the five
</p>
<p>equations (7.1), (7.2), (7.6), (7.7) and (7.11), which we can solve for the five quanti-
</p>
<p>ties Frad; Fcon; v;re, and r, if the usual local quantities .P; T; %; l;m; cP ;rad;rrad,
and g) are given.</p>

<p>7.2 Dimensionless Equations 65
</p>
<p>7.2 Dimensionless Equations
</p>
<p>For a simpler treatment of the five equations obtained from the mixing-length theory,
</p>
<p>we define two dimensionless quantities:

<p>U WD 3acT

</p>
<p>cP%2�`2m
</p>
<p>s
8HP
</p>
<p>gı

</p>
<p>W WD rrad � rad : (7.13)
</p>
<p>The meaning of U will become clear later; that ofW is obvious. Note that both can
</p>
<p>be calculated immediately for any point in the star when the usual variables and the
</p>
<p>mixing length `m are given.
</p>
<p>If v is eliminated with the help of (7.6), then (7.11) becomes
</p>
<p>re � rad D 2U
p
r � re: (7.14)
</p>
<p>Eliminating Frad; Fcon from (7.1), (7.2) and (7.7) and using (2.4) and (6.8),
</p>
<p>we arrive at
</p>
<p>.r � re/3=2 D
8
</p>
<p>9
U.rrad � r/ : (7.15)
</p>
<p>We have thus replaced the set of five equations by the two equations (7.14) and
</p>
<p>(7.15) for r and re, and we will now even reduce them to one final equation.
Rewriting the left-hand side of (7.14) as (r � rad/ � .r � re/, one sees
</p>
<p>immediately that this is a quadratic equation for (r � re/1=2 with the solution
p
r � re D �U C � ; (7.16)
</p>
<p>where � is a new variable given by the positive root of
</p>
<p>�2 D r � rad C U 2 : (7.17)
</p>
<p>In (7.15), we insert (7.16) on the left-hand side, eliminate r on the right-hand side
with (7.17), and obtain
</p>
<p>.� � U /3 C 8U

.�2 � U 2 �W / D 0 : (7.18)
</p>
<p>So we have arrived at a cubic equation for � that can be solved for any given
</p>
<p>set of parameters U and W: It turns out that (7.18) has only one real solution.
</p>
<p>The resulting �, together with (7.17), then gives the decisive quantity r, that is,
the average temperature gradient to which the layer settles in the presence of
</p>
<p>convection.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>66 7 Transport of Energy by Convection
</p>
<p>Other characteristic quantities of the convection are then also easily calculable,
</p>
<p>for example, the velocity v from (7.6) and (7.14).
</p>
<p>We note for completeness that the cubic equation (7.18) should be solved
</p>
<p>numerically and not by the analytical formulae for the solution of third order
</p>
<p>equations, because the individual terms appearing therein can be many magnitudes
</p>
<p>larger than the root of the formula.
</p>
<p>7.3 Limiting Cases, Solutions, Discussion
</p>
<p>For a given difference W D rrad � rad, the convection depends decisively on the
value of U: Let us write (7.2) as Frad D �radr, and (7.7) as Fcon D �con.r �re/3=2.
Then, U , defined in (7.12), is essentially the ratio of the &ldquo;conductivities&rdquo;: �rad=�con.
</p>
<p>The dimensionless quantity U can also be written in terms of the time �ff it takes
</p>
<p>a mass element to fall freely over the distance HP . With �ff D .2HP =g/1=2 and
(6.25), we have

<p>U � �ff

</p>
<p>where we have ignored a factor 3=.8ı1=2/, which is of order 1. One normally
</p>
<p>assumes that `m � d , and therefore, U � �ff=�adj.
The quantity U is also related to another dimensionless quantity � defined by

</p>
<p>; (7.20)

</p>
<p>radius `m=2; cross-section A; volume V; lifetime �l D `m=v, and thermal energy

<p>7.3 Limiting Cases, Solutions, Discussion 67
</p>
<p>For an average element, � gives the convective energy flowing throughA relative to
</p>
<p>the radiative energy loss per second. It is a measure for the efficiency of convection.
</p>
<p>Large values of � (small U / are typical for very dense matter, where radiation
</p>
<p>losses are relatively unimportant compared to the convective flux. In regions of
</p>
<p>small density, however, the radiative losses can be so large that even very violent
</p>
<p>movements are ineffective for energy transport; the elements then lose nearly all of
</p>
<p>their excess heat through radiation to the surroundings, and cool down to DT � 0.
In this case, � is very small (i.e. U is very large). The meaning of � can also be
</p>
<p>represented in terms of two typical timescales for the elements, namely, lifetime and
</p>
<p>adjustment time: in the second equation (6.25), replace DT by (7.4) and solve for
</p>
<p>r � re. This expression is then divided by (7.22) giving
</p>
<p>� D r �rere � rad
D 2�adj
</p>
<p>�l
: (7.24)
</p>
<p>Let us consider the limiting cases for very large and very small U (or � /: One
</p>
<p>should keep in mind that all gradients are finite; except for rrad, they are all smaller
than unity. And for the discussion in terms of � , one can easily rewrite (7.14) and
</p>
<p>(7.15) with the help of (7.20).
</p>
<p>U ! 0 (or � ! 1): Equation (7.14) gives re ! rad, and thus, (7.15) yields
r ! rad. A negligible excess of r over the adiabatic value is sufficient to transport
the whole luminosity. This is the case in the very dense central part of a star. Here,
</p>
<p>we do not need to solve the mixing-length equations (r D rad is known), and the
uncertainties of this theory do not arise.
</p>
<p>U ! 1 (or � ! 0): In (7.15), the gradients on the left-hand side must be finite,
and therefore on the right-hand side,r ! rrad. Convection is ineffective and cannot
transport a substantial fraction of the luminosity. Therefore, F ! Frad, and the
gradient r is again known without further calculations. This is the case near the
photosphere of a star.
</p>
<p>The situation is difficult where the two limiting cases do not apply, for example,
</p>
<p>in the upper part of an outer convective envelope. There the equations of the mixing-
</p>
<p>length theory have to be solved, and they will yield a value for r somewhere
between rad and rrad, the convection being said to be superadiabatic.
</p>
<p>The following gives a more detailed discussion of the solutions of (7.18), which

<p>The corresponding straight line lg W D 2 lg U C 0:033 (dot-dashed line in
Fig. 7.1) is below and parallel to that for � D 1.
</p>
<p>The meaning of the different regions in Fig. 7.1 is now quite clear. Below and left
</p>
<p>of a line of sufficiently small x (say, x D 10�2/, we have nearly r D rad; above
that line, the convection is superadiabatic. Not too far to the right of the line � D 1,
the efficiency is so small that r � rrad.
</p>
<p>For an estimate for the interior of a star, let us assume a perfect monatomic gas
</p>
<p>with ı D � D 1; cP =&lt; D 5=2 and a mixing-length `m D HP . For an average
point in a star like the Sun, we may take r D Rˇ=2;m D Mˇ=2; T D 107K,
� D 1 cm2 g�1 and % D 1 g cm�3. Then, we obtain U � 10�8, which is so far to
the left in Fig. 7.1 that, for reasonable values of W D rrad � rad (say between 1
and 102/, r � rad � 10�5 : : : 10�4. For the central region of the Sun, % and � are
larger by factors of 102 and 10, respectively. Then, U � 10�13, and (for the same
values of W / the difference r � rad is even smaller by a factor 103 or more, that
is, &lt; 10�7. The stratification of such convective zones is indeed very close to an
adiabatic one, and we can simply set r D rad, independent of the uncertainties of
the theory (The situation is difficult only near the interface between convective and
</p>
<p>radiative zones, where one should have a smooth transition between the two modes
</p>
<p>of transport.).
</p>
<p>Convective elements in such dense layers are so effective (� � 106 : : : 109/ that
they can transport the whole luminosity with surprisingly little effort. Compared
</p>
<p>with the surroundings, they only need very small excesses of the T gradi-

<p>The Reynolds number decides whether the flow of an incompressible viscous

<p>Here, � is the viscosity of the fluid and `m and v are the typical distance elements

<p>of the small velocities of convective elements, the Reynolds number is � 1, since
the flow extends over such a large distance `m: The situation is quite different for</p>

<p>convection near the surface of the star, where the density is low. This gives small
</p>
<p>effectivity and positive lg U: Here, the cubic equation for � (or x/ has to be solved
</p>
<p>for each point to find the proper r for that place, and the results are affected by the
uncertainties of the theory.
</p>
<p>In any case, we use the resulting value of r in the transport equation written in
the form

<p>P

r : (7.32)
</p>
<p>(Here, we have replaced dP/dm by the right-hand side of the hydrostatic equation
</p>
<p>since the theory is suitable only for hydrostatic equilibrium.) For convection in the
</p>
<p>very deep interior, r D rad, where rad is given by (4.21), while for envelope
convection, we take r as given by the solution of the mixing-length theory. And we
can even take the same equation (7.32) for transport by radiation, if we set r D rrad
(compare Sect. 5.2).
</p>
<p>Aside from the more or less effective (and more or less well-determined)
</p>
<p>transport of energy, turbulent convection, if it occurs, has a side effect that is
</p>
<p>important for the life of the star: it mixes the stellar matter very thoroughly and
</p>
<p>rapidly compared to other relevant timescales, and thus, it contributes directly to the
</p>
<p>long-lasting chemical record of the star&rsquo;s history.
</p>
<p>7.4 Extensions of the Mixing-Length Theory
</p>
<p>The mixing-length theory, as described above, has many open and hidden
</p>
<p>assumptions. Most prominent is the mixing length itself, usually expressed as the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;mixing length parameter&rdquo; ˛MLT, which is the mixing-length in units of the pressure
</p>
<p>scale heightHP . It is generally assumed that ˛MLT is both constant within a star and
</p>
<p>does vary neither with stellar mass, composition, nor with evolutionary stage. Its
</p>
<p>value is not known better than that from general physical arguments, it should be of
</p>
<p>order 1. To determine a reasonable numerical value, a comparison of the effective
</p>
<p>temperature or radius of stellar models with observed stars is done, preferentially
</p>
<p>in the case of the Sun. This yields values for ˛MLT between 1.5 and 2.0. Ludwig
</p>
<p>et al. (1999) have done a comparison with numerical simulations of convection and
</p>
<p>found only a weak dependence of the order of 20% on stellar parameters for stars
</p>
<p>of solar metallicity.
</p>
<p>But there are even more hidden parameters and assumptions. The theory
</p>
<p>contains, for example, several mean values entering the equations from (7.4) on.
</p>
<p>For (7.10), we assumed a certain geometrical form of the blobs to obtain the ratio
</p>
<p>of surface to volume. Different formulations of the mixing-length theory may make
</p>
<p>different assumptions for all this. Therefore, the mixing-length parameter may not
</p>
<p>be directly comparable between such different formulations.
</p>
<p>The most basic limitation in all these variants of the theory is the assumption of
</p>
<p>one single size (and form) for the convective elements. The theory of turbulence,
</p>
<p>numerical simulations, laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations all</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.4 Extensions of the Mixing-Length Theory 71
</p>
<p>show that this is certainly not the case. Instead, numerical simulations and helioseis-
</p>
<p>mology showed that convection often operates by extended funnel-like downdrafts
</p>
<p>and turbulent updrafts. Convective energy is thus realistically not transported in
</p>
<p>laminar flows of blobs of identical size and energy content, but by turbulent elements
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;eddies&rdquo;) of all sizes. Fcon can therefore not be calculated as in (7.3) but rather
</p>
<p>results from an integration over the full spectrum of convective eddies.
</p>
<p>Canuto and Mazzitelli (1991) developed and presented an extension of the
</p>
<p>mixing-length theory, in which the full turbulent kinetic energy spectrum is taken
</p>
<p>into account. This &ldquo;full spectrum turbulence&rdquo; theory (FST) can be formulated in
</p>
<p>much the same way as the mixing-length theory, which is the limiting case for a
</p>
<p>ı-function like energy spectrum. It also results in a cubic equation to be solved.
</p>
<p>Canuto and Mazzitelli use the formulation of Cox and Giuli (Weiss et al. 2004,
</p>
<p>Chap. 14, and eq. 14.82); in this formulation, the cubic equation reads
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>4
� 03 C � 02 C � 0 � 1
</p>
<p>U 2
.rrad � rad/ D 0; (7.33)
</p>
<p>where we have replaced already some terms by quantities of our own formulation.
</p>
<p>� 0 is defined as
</p>
<p>2� 0 C 1 D
�
1C r �rad
</p>
<p>U 2
</p>
<p>�1=2
(7.34)
</p>
<p>and corresponds to the convective efficiency.
</p>
<p>After modelling the convective flux in the FST model, (7.33) is modified by
</p>
<p>multiplying the � 03-term with a function ˝.� 0/, which is the new turbulent
convective flux relative to that of the mixing-length theory. ˝ rises monotonically
</p>
<p>from 0 to 1 for � 0 going from � 0 � 0 to � 0 ! 1 and can be approximated by an
analytical fitting function.
</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb convective fluxes in this theory are larger than predicted by the
</p>
<p>mixing-length theory in case of efficient convection, and superadiabatic regions are
</p>
<p>narrower but more superadiabatic. The temperature gradient in the solar convection
</p>
<p>zone predicted by the FST model agrees much better with that obtained in numerical
</p>
<p>simulations than it does in the mixing-length case. The numerical value for the
</p>
<p>mixing length parameter in this case is around 0.7.</p>

<p>The Chemical Composition
</p>
<p>8.1 Relative Mass Abundances
</p>
<p>The chemical composition of stellar matter is obviously very important, since it
</p>
<p>directly influences such basic properties as absorption of radiation or generation of
</p>
<p>energy by nuclear reactions. These reactions in turn alter the chemical composition,
</p>
<p>which represents a long-lasting record of the nuclear history of the star.
</p>
<p>The composition of stellar matter is extremely simple compared to that of
</p>
<p>terrestrial bodies. Because of the high temperatures and pressures, there are no
</p>
<p>chemical compounds in the stellar interior, and the atoms are for the most part
</p>
<p>completely ionized. It suffices then to count and keep track of the different types
</p>
<p>of nuclei.
</p>
<p>We denote by Xi that fraction of a unit mass which consists of nuclei of type i:
</p>
<p>This requires that X
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>Xi D 1 : (8.1)
</p>
<p>The chemical composition of a star at time t is then described, if for the rel-
</p>
<p>evant nuclei the functions Xi D Xi .m; t/ are given in the interval [0, M&#141;
of m:
</p>
<p>The commonly used particle number per volume, ni , of nuclei with mass mi , is
</p>
<p>related to the mass abundances by
</p>
<p>Xi D
mini
</p>
<p>%
: (8.2)
</p>
<p>Usually, one does not need to specify very many Xi because most elements are
</p>
<p>either too rare or play no relevant role, or their abundances remain constant in time.
</p>
<p>In fact, for many purposes, it is even sufficient to specify only the mass fractions of
</p>
<p>hydrogen, helium, and &ldquo;the rest&rdquo; with the notation
</p>
<p>X � XH; Y � XHe; Z � 1 � X � Y : (8.3)

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>74 8 The Chemical Composition
</p>
<p>This requires additional conventions about the relative distribution of the elements
</p>
<p>in Z, collectively called &ldquo;metals&rdquo;, in particular the amount of C, N, and O, which
</p>
<p>are important for hydrogen burning.
</p>
<p>Young stars throughout, and most stars in their envelopes, contain an over-
</p>
<p>whelming amount of hydrogen and helium: X D 0:65 : : : 0:75, Y D 0:30 : : : 0:25,
Z D 0:05 : : : 0:0001.
</p>
<p>Of course, nuclear reactions will eventually change this simple picture drasti-
</p>
<p>cally. For example, if many competing reactions occur simultaneously, or if one is
</p>
<p>interested in such aspects as isotopic ratios, one may have to specify a large number
</p>
<p>of differentXi . Only if inverse ˇ decay, the big equalizer in late stages of evolution,
</p>
<p>has destroyed all elements does the composition then return to utmost simplicity&ndash;
</p>
<p>just neutrons (Chap. 38).
</p>
<p>The advantages of the use of m instead of r as independent variable become
</p>
<p>particularly evident when we have to describe the chemical composition. If we
</p>
<p>took Xi.r; t/ instead, any expansion would immediately lead to a change of all the
</p>
<p>functions Xi ; this holds, of course, for all functions depending on the chemical
</p>
<p>composition.
</p>
<p>8.2 Variation of Composition with Time
</p>
<p>8.2.1 Radiative Regions
</p>
<p>In radiative regions, there is no exchange of matter between different mass shells, if
</p>
<p>we can neglect diffusion. Then, the Xi can change only if nuclear reactions create
</p>
<p>or destroy nuclei of type i in the mass element under consideration.
</p>
<p>The frequency of a certain reaction is described by the reaction rate rlm, that is,
</p>
<p>the number of reactions per unit volume and time that transform nuclei from type l
</p>
<p>into type m (see Chap. 18). The reaction itself will in most cases involve more than
</p>
<p>just one mother and one daughter nucleus, but for simplicity, we characterize it by
</p>
<p>one index only. In general, an element i can be affected simultaneously by many
</p>
<p>reactions, some of which create it (rj i) and some of which destroy it (rik). These
</p>
<p>reaction rates give directly the change per second of ni . Then, with (8.2), we have

nucleus of type i is created or destroyed per reaction, the corresponding terms in the
</p>
<p>sums have simply to be normalized by the number of nuclei of type i involved.).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.2 Variation of Composition with Time 75
</p>
<p>The reaction p ! q in which one nucleus of type p is transformed may be
connected with a release of energy epq : In the equation of energy conservation,
</p>
<p>we have used the energy generation rate " per unit mass, which normally contains
</p>
<p>contributions from several different reactions. The " are simply proportional to the
</p>
<p>reaction rates:
</p>
<p>" D

</p>
<p>%
</p>
<p>X

</p>
<p>rpq epq : (8.5)
</p>
<p>Let us introduce the energy generated when one mass unit of type p nuclei is
</p>
<p>transformed into type q:
</p>
<p>qpq D
epq
</p>
<p>mp
: (8.6)
</p>
<p>For simple cases, it is convenient to rewrite (8.4) in terms of the "; which already
</p>
<p>occur in the equation of energy conservation. If all reactions give a positive
</p>
<p>contribution to ", then instead of (8.4), we can write
</p>
<p>@Xi

<p>@t

</p>
<p>qj i

X
</p>
<p>k
</p>
<p>"ik
</p>
<p>qik
: (8.7)
</p>
<p>If I different nuclei are simultaneously subject to nuclear transformations, equa-
</p>
<p>tions (8.4) or (8.7) form a set of I differential equations, technically called a
</p>
<p>&ldquo;nuclear reactions network&rdquo;. One of them could be replaced by the normalization
</p>
<p>(8.1), such that we need only I � 1 of them to complete the basic equations of our
problem. Technically, however, this is not advisable, as (8.1) can then serve as an
</p>
<p>independent consistency check: if the set of differential equations is solved correctly,
</p>
<p>mass must be conserved.
</p>
<p>Note that for simple cases, it may even suffice to consider just one of these
</p>
<p>equations. For example, if hydrogen burning is to be taken into account only by
</p>
<p>way of an overall generation rate "H (giving the sum over all single reactions), then
</p>
<p>the only equation needed is
@X

</p>
<p>qH
(8.8)
</p>
<p>with @Y=@t D �@X=@t , where qH is the energy release per unit mass when
hydrogen is converted into helium.
</p>
<p>In Sect. 4.6, we defined the nuclear timescale for a certain burning, �n D En=L.
One can actually define a nuclear timescale for each type of nuclear burning since
</p>
<p>each nuclear energy reservoir is proportional to an integral of Xi � dm over the
whole star, where Xi refers to the element consumed by the reactions; therefore, �n
is equivalent to �Xi , the timescale for the exhaustion of the element i:</p>

<p>76 8 The Chemical Composition
</p>
<p>8.2.2 Diffusion
</p>
<p>Certain microscopic effects can also change the chemical composition in a star.
</p>
<p>If gradients occur in the abundances of chemical elements, then concentration
</p>
<p>diffusion tends to smooth out the differences. Even in chemically homogeneous
</p>
<p>stellar layers, heavier atoms can migrate towards the regions of higher temperature,
</p>
<p>owing to the effect of temperature diffusion. Also, the pressure gradient in a
</p>
<p>stratified layer causes the heavier particles to diffuse towards the region of higher
</p>
<p>pressure, that is, pressure diffusion. The detailed statistical theory of diffusion is
</p>
<p>derived in Burgers (1969), Chapman and Cowling (1970), and Choudhuri (1998).
</p>
<p>We start with the simplest case: concentration diffusion. Let c be the concen-
</p>
<p>tration of particles of a certain species, that is, the number density of particles of
</p>
<p>that type divided by the number density of all particles, and j D be the &ldquo;flux of
</p>
<p>concentration&rdquo;; then, Fick&rsquo;s first law states that
</p>
<p>jD D �Drc ; (8.9)
</p>
<p>where D is the diffusion coefficient (We will derive (8.9) later.). With j D D cvD,
where vD is the diffusion velocity, one has

<p>if the coefficients kT and kP are properly specified. In order to do that we first
</p>
<p>consider the combined effects of concentration and temperature diffusion.
</p>
<p>We assume rT to be perpendicular to the x&ndash;y plane in a Cartesian coordinate
</p>
<p>system; then the flux of particles of a certain type in the Cz direction due to the
statistical motion of the particles is determined by the density n and the mean

velocity and vD &gt; 0 means that hydrogen diffuses in the direction of lower
</p>
<p>temperature, i.e. &ldquo;upwards&rdquo; in the star. For the central region of the Sun (T � 107K,
% � 100 g cm�3/ one finds that ` � 10�8 cm and D � 6 cm2 s�1, and with a
characteristic length-scale S � Rˇ � 1011 cm, the characteristic timescale �D
(according to (8.14)) there becomes �D � 1013 years. Although �D is much larger
than the age of the universe and therefore the effects of concentration and tempera-
</p>
<p>ture diffusion seem to be astrophysically irrelevant for the Sun, diffusion does have
</p>
<p>enough influence on stellar evolution such that high-precision observations require
</p>
<p>models that include its effect. This will become evident in the case of the standard
</p>
<p>solar model (see Chap. 29). We will therefore briefly discuss the situation. If a layer
</p>
<p>is homogeneous, then there is no concentration diffusion, but the hydrogen particles
</p>
<p>diffuse towards the regions of lower temperature. This causes an outward increase
</p>
<p>of nH which in turn triggers concentration diffusion acting against the temperature
</p>
<p>diffusion (sign(@cH=@z) = �sign(@T=@z)) until both types of diffusion compensate
each other.
</p>
<p>We now turn to pressure diffusion, which is the cause of what is often called
</p>
<p>&ldquo;sedimentation&rdquo; or &ldquo;gravitational settling&rdquo;. A statistical consideration similar to
</p>
<p>that used to make temperature diffusion plausible also shows that there is diffusion
</p>
<p>in isothermal layers with a non-vanishing pressure gradient. The reader is again
</p>
<p>referred to Chapman and Cowling (1970), or any of the other standard textbooks. In
</p>
<p>a way similar to that for kT an expression for kP in (8.15) can also be obtained.
</p>
<p>We here confine ourselves to the discussion of the final outcome of this process
</p>
<p>of pressure diffusion, i.e. the state of final equilibrium for an isothermal layer in
</p>
<p>hydrostatic equilibrium in a gravitational field pointing towards the �z direction.
Let us assume that the material consists of two components .i D 1; 2) of perfect
gases of different molecular weights �i and partial pressures Pi . Then there exist
</p>
<p>two pressure-scale heights HPi D �d z=d lnPi with which (6.8) can be written in
the form

</p>
<p>where dPi=d z D �g%i and Pi D &lt;%iT=�i are used. The particle densities are
proportional to the Pi , which are here approximately proportional to exp .�z=HPi /.
Therefore the component with the higher�i falls off more sharply in the z direction
</p>
<p>than that with smaller �i , so that in a very simplified way, one can say that the
</p>
<p>heavier component has &ldquo;moved below&rdquo; the lighter one. This is the final state,
</p>
<p>which would be brought about by pressure diffusion alone even if the species were
</p>
<p>originally in a completely mixed state. Of course, in reality, the two other types of
</p>
<p>diffusion would also act and therefore influence the final state.
</p>
<p>Estimates show that not only jkT j but also jkP j is of order one. Therefore it
normally takes rather a long time before an appreciable separation occurs in stars.
</p>
<p>Although in general we will ignore the effect of diffusion in this book, it can be very
</p>
<p>relevant in certain special cases. Equation (8.12), using (8.15), can be formulated in
</p>
<p>terms of relative mass fractions Xi instead of particle concentrations and for the

<p>This formulation follows the one by Thoul et al. (1994), and the T 5=2 factor results

<p>from a convenient definition of the diffusion constants called AP , AT , and Ak here.
</p>
<p>In this description the concentration Ci is defined as ci=ce , i.e. as the usual particle
</p>
<p>concentration in units of the electron concentration. Note that the concentration
</p>
<p>diffusion is taken as a sum over all species, since the concentration of species i
</p>
<p>may also change due to the diffusion of all other elements. The sum actually has not
</p>
<p>to be taken over all species as mass and charge conservation reduce the number of
</p>
<p>independentAk by two. Here we have taken out helium and electrons.
</p>
<p>When diffusion is to be taken into account, proper evaluation of the diffusive
</p>
<p>constants D (or A in (8.25)) for the various types of diffusion is necessary. This
</p>
<p>involves correct treatment of the interaction forces between the particles and will be
</p>
<p>quite sophisticated. Two widely used sources for calculating the diffusion constants
</p>
<p>are Paquette et al. (1986) and Thoul et al. (1994), both using a method described
</p>
<p>in the book by Burgers (1969). This method is also sketched in Weiss et al. (2004).
</p>
<p>An improvement by applying quantum corrections was introduced by Schlattl and
</p>
<p>Salaris (2003). In general these diffusive speeds or constants are considered to be
</p>
<p>accurate to 20%. There is an additional effect not discussed here: Coupling of the
</p>
<p>radiation field to partially ionized atoms results in a net upward force, counteracting
</p>
<p>the downward sedimentation. This sort of diffusion is called radiative levitation and
</p>
<p>can lead to strong variations in surface element abundances, in particular for those
</p>
<p>elements with rich energy level systems. A derivation of the relevant coefficients
</p>
<p>was given by Richer et al. (1998).</p>

(Fig. 8.1). Inside that interval all Xi D X i are constant. At the boundaries one can
generally have a discontinuity, such that the &ldquo;outer&rdquo; valuesXi1 andXi2 are different
</p>
<p>from the &ldquo;inner&rdquo; values&ndash;which are simply X i . But m1 and m2 can change in time,

</p>
<p>Mass Loss
</p>
<p>So far we have always assumed that stars have constant total mass. This is, however,
</p>
<p>not at all the case. The Sun is losing mass via the solar wind at a rate of about
</p>
<p>10�14Mˇ=year. While this mass loss is so slow that it can savely be ignored, other
stars may have mass loss rates of up to 10�8Mˇ=year or even beyond. The highest
mass loss rates for single stars are known for very massive stars (M &amp; 50Mˇ) and
for stars of intermediate mass (around 5Mˇ) in a very late stage of their evolution.
In addition, stars in binary systems can lose (and gain) mass at any rate due to the
</p>
<p>gravitational interaction between the two components.Mass loss can therefore range
</p>
<p>from being totally irrelevant for the evolution of a star up to reducing the mass by
</p>
<p>up to 50% or more.
</p>
<p>For completeness, we add that the nuclear processes, which provide the
</p>
<p>overwhelming part of the radiation lost from the stellar surface, imply a conversion
</p>
<p>of matter to energy and therefore lead to a reduction of the stellar mass, too. For the
</p>
<p>Sun, this is of the same order as the solar wind, and can therefore be safely ignored.
</p>
<p>This is also true for all other stars either because this effect is very small, anyhow,
</p>
<p>or because stellar wind mass loss is much larger.
</p>
<p>Evidence for mass loss and estimates of its size come from the direct detection
</p>
<p>of circumstellar matter and from spectral signatures, such as Doppler shifts and
</p>
<p>spectral line shapes. Wind velocities can range from a few to a few thousand km/s.
</p>
<p>Physically, stellar winds result in many cases from the interaction of the
</p>
<p>photons emitted from the photosphere with atoms, molecules, or dust grains in
</p>
<p>the atmosphere. It is therefore a complicated radiation-hydrodynamics problem,
</p>
<p>which, in addition, may depend on chemical processes, too. An example for the
</p>
<p>latter are winds from very cool stars, which depend on the coupling of radiation to
</p>
<p>dust grains. Their formation is a complicated chemical process depending strongly
</p>
<p>on temperature and density in the stellar atmosphere, which may be subject to
</p>
<p>regular variations due to stellar pulsations. High mass loss rates are often associated
</p>
<p>with pulsations in extended stellar envelopes. In some cases, solid physical models
</p>
<p>exist, which describe the mechanisms for stellar winds. This is particularly true for
</p>
<p>winds from hot stars (so-called radiation-driven winds) and for dust-driven winds
</p>
<p>of cool stars with carbon-rich chemistry. For the observational evidence and for

<p>84 9 Mass Loss
</p>
<p>introductions to stellar wind theories, we refer the reader to the reviews &ldquo;Winds
</p>
<p>from hot stars&rdquo; by Kudritzki and Puls (2000), &ldquo;Mass loss from cool stars&rdquo; byWillson
</p>
<p>(2000), and &ldquo;Dust driven winds&rdquo; by Sedlmayer and Dominik (1994).
</p>
<p>Since a full theoretical model for any stellar wind is not available, and would
</p>
<p>not be reasonable to be used in modelling stellar evolution, and since most
</p>
<p>information about stellar mass loss still results from observations, empirical mass
</p>
<p>loss formulations are used in the models. They have all been obtained from
</p>
<p>observations of some class of stars, and therefore differ from each other. Therefore,
</p>
<p>different mass loss formulae have to be used for different type of stars. None of
</p>
<p>them is very accurate, but in most cases, it suffices to have the correct order of
</p>
<p>magnitude of mass loss and its dependence on the global properties of the star.
</p>
<p>We now introduce a few such empirical mass loss formulations, which are widely
</p>
<p>used in stellar evolution calculations.
</p>
<p>The most famous mass loss formula of all is that of Reimers (1975), obtained
</p>
<p>from red giants with heavy element abundances similar to those in the Sun. Reimers
</p>
<p>showed that the dependence of the mass loss rate on basic stellar parameters can be
</p>
<p>expressed by the simple fitting formula
</p>
<p>PMR D �4 � 10�13�
L
</p>
<p>gR
� gˇRˇ
Lˇ
</p>
<p>: (9.1)
</p>
<p>The unit of PM is Mˇ/year. This formula reflects the intuitive expection that mass
loss increases with luminosityL, and decreases with a deeper gravitational potential
</p>
<p>well gR D GM=R. The parameter � was introduced later to use Reimers&rsquo; formula
for other types of stars, too. It usually varies between 0.2 and 1.0 and is lower for
</p>
<p>metal-poor stars, indicating a weaker coupling of the photons to the gas if fewer
</p>
<p>heavy elements are present.
</p>
<p>Reimers&rsquo; formula has no strong theoretical justification, but seems to be a useful
</p>
<p>estimate for the order of magnitude of mass loss from cool stars. It has been
</p>
<p>modified from time to time to take into account a more detailed dependence on
</p>
<p>stellar parameters. One of the latest of such modifications, which is fitting better to
</p>
<p>recent mass loss determinations, is that of Schröder and Cuntz (2005), which is

: (9.2)
</p>
<p>For very cool and luminous stars on the asymptotic giant branch, which
</p>
<p>experience an almost catastrophic mass loss event with mass loss rates up to
</p>
<p>10�4Mˇ=year, a simple and useful formula has been derived by Blöcker (1995),
based on observations and dust-driven wind theories. There are more sophisticated
</p>
<p>theoretical or empirical mass loss functions (see Sect. 34.6), but Blöcker&rsquo;s is in most
</p>
<p>cases sufficient for an estimate:
</p>
<p>PMB D �4:83 � 10�9 PMR.M?=Mˇ/�2:1.L=Lˇ/2:7 (9.3)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9 Mass Loss 85
</p>
<p>There are two variants of this formula, in which for M? either the initial or the
</p>
<p>present mass of the star is used. Since (9.3) is only a rough estimate of the actual
</p>
<p>mass loss, this is acceptable.
</p>
<p>Finally, we add a formula fitting empirical mass loss rates for hot stars of spectral
</p>
<p>type O and B, obtained by Lamers (1981):
</p>
<p>PML D �1:48 � 10�5
�
</p>
<p>L
</p>
<p>1; 000Lˇ
</p>
<p>�1:42 �
R
</p>
<p>30Rˇ
</p>
<p>�0:61 �
30Mˇ
M
</p>
<p>�0:99
(9.4)
</p>
<p>A more physical discussion of mass loss from hot stars can be found in the
</p>
<p>mentioned review by Kudritzki and Puls (2000).
</p>
<p>Obviously, all these formulae contain, in some form or other, the basic depen-
</p>
<p>dence on M , R, and L by Reimers. Sometimes a dependence on chemical
</p>
<p>composition is added. It is generally assumed that PM � X1=2res , where Xres denotes
the mass fraction of all elements other than hydrogen and helium.
</p>
<p>Equations (9.1)&ndash;(9.4) already indicate that the main effect of mass loss is simply
</p>
<p>to reduce the total mass of a star. This has to be taken into account in stellar
</p>
<p>modelling and will be discussed in Sect. 12.5.</p>

<p>convection in the outer layers. Note that the expression on the right-hand side

<p>of (10.4) assumes hydrostatic equilibrium. This does not matter in the case of
</p>
<p>radiative transport, since the local adjustment time of the radiation field is very
</p>
<p>short, and the convection theory of Chap. 7 is valid only for stars in hydrostatic

<p>equilibrium. Otherwise another convection theory valid in rapidly changing regions
</p>
<p>would have to be used. Additional criteria such as (6.12) and (6.13) distinguish

<p>In the system (10.1)&ndash;(10.5) one can distinguish certain subsystems, i.e. (10.1)

</p>
<p>Under normal conditions (�n much larger than the other timescales; see Sect. 10.2)
</p>
<p>they can be decoupled from the spatial parts (10.1)&ndash;(10.4), which describe the

<p>material functions on the right-hand sides of (10.1)&ndash;(10.5) to be replaced with the
</p>
<p>help of the corresponding equations (10.7)&ndash;(10.14), i.e. by functions of P; T;Xi .
</p>
<p>For I different types of nuclei being affected by reactions, (10.1)&ndash;(10.5) form a set
</p>
<p>of 4 C I differential equations for the 4 C I variables r; P; T; l; X1; : : : ; XI . We
therefore have the same number of equations and unknown variables.
</p>
<p>The independent variables are m and t: If we assume that the total mass of the
</p>
<p>star does not change in time (i.e. no gain nor loss of mass) and if we define the time
</p>
<p>at which evolution starts as t D t0, then we are looking for solutions in the intervals
</p>
<p>0 � m �M; t � t0 : (10.15)
</p>
<p>In the full problem we are confronted with a set of non-linear, partial differential
</p>
<p>equations. As usual, physically relevant solutions require the specification of
</p>
<p>boundary conditions (here at m D 0;m D M ) and of initial values [e.g. Xi.m; t0)].
The boundary conditions will be dealt with in Chap. 11. In order to see more
</p>
<p>clearly which initial values have to be specified we replace the two terms with time
</p>
<p>derivatives of P and T in (10.3) by one term containing the change of the entropy
</p>
<p>s;�T @s=@t , according to (4.47). Obviously the full problem requires specification
of the functions r.m; t0/; Pr.m; t0/; s.m; t0/, and Xi .m; t0/.
</p>
<p>After proper initial values and boundary conditions are specified, together with
</p>
<p>the stellar mass M , the problem is to find solutions of the basic equations, i.e. the
</p>
<p>unknown variables as functions of m and t: A solution r.m/; P.m/; : : : ; Xi.m/ for
</p>
<p>a given time t in the interval [0,M ] is called a stellar model. But before we discuss
</p>
<p>in more detail how solutions of our set of differential equations can be obtained, we
</p>
<p>first discuss simplifications of the full problem.
</p>
<p>10.2 Timescales and Simplifications
</p>
<p>There are three types of time derivatives in our set of equations. To each of them
</p>
<p>belongs a certain characteristic timescale. In Sect. 2.4 the term .@2r=@t2/=4�r2 in
</p>
<p>(2.16)&ndash;the dynamical version of (10.2)&ndash;was used to derive �hydr. From the time
</p>
<p>derivatives in (10.3) we have derived �KH in Sect. 3.3. The time derivatives in (10.5)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92 10 The Differential Equations of Stellar Evolution
</p>
<p>define chemical timescales �Xi which were shown to be equivalent to �n [see (4.59)]
</p>
<p>at the end of Sect. 8.2.1.
</p>
<p>In Sect. 2.4 we showed that the inertia term in (10.2) can be neglected if the
</p>
<p>evolution is slow compared to �hydr. Therefore, if the evolution of a star is governed
</p>
<p>by thermal adjustment or by nuclear reactions (�KH � �hydr and �n � �hydr), the
equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (10.2) is appropriate. The star then evolves
</p>
<p>along a sequence of states of hydrostatic equilibrium. As initial conditions, the
</p>
<p>functions s.m; t0/ and Xi.m; t0) have to be specified in this approximation.
</p>
<p>If the star evolves on the timescale �n � �KH, then according to the discussion in
Sect. 4.4, the time derivatives in the energy equation can also be neglected and (10.3)
</p>
<p>is reduced to
@l
</p>
<p>@m
D "n � "�: (10.16)
</p>
<p>The star now evolves along a sequence of states in which it is not only in hydrostatic
</p>
<p>equilibrium but also thermally adjusted. We call this complete (mechanical and
</p>
<p>thermal) equilibrium. The only initial values to be given in this case are the
</p>
<p>Xi.m; t0/:
</p>
<p>In complete equilibrium the basic equations split into two parts: the &ldquo;structure
</p>
<p>equations&rdquo; (10.1), (10.2), (10.16) and (10.4) contain only spatial derivatives while
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;chemical equations&rdquo; (10.5) contain only time derivatives. Therefore, if at a
</p>
<p>certain time t D t0 the Xi .m; t0) are given, the structure equations can be taken as a
set of four ordinary differential equations describing the structure of the star at t0.
</p>
<p>Complete equilibrium is a good approximation for stars in many important
</p>
<p>evolutionary phases, for example, the stars on the main sequence. But even without
</p>
<p>complete equilibrium the full set of equations is usually split into two parts: the
</p>
<p>spatial part solved as a boundary value problem for a given chemical composition
</p>
<p>Xi.m; t0/, and the time-dependent initial-value problem of the chemical changes.
</p>
<p>These two parts are solved in two different, alternating steps with different
</p>
<p>numerical schemes. This introduces a basic problem of inconsistency: consider the
</p>
<p>spatial problem to be solved at time t0, with some chemical stratification given.
</p>
<p>Once the solutions for r.m/, T .m/, P.m/, and l.m/ have been found, some layers
</p>
<p>may be convective. Therefore, the chemical stratification for which the solution was
</p>
<p>determined may be altered by convective (or, more general, by any kind of) mixing,
</p>
<p>and the solution will not be consistent with the real chemical composition. The
</p>
<p>mixing is done only in the second step, after the spatial problem is solved, over
</p>
<p>a time step 4t , and after this step, the physical variables are again not a solution
of the new Xi.m; t0 C 4t/, etc. Of course one can control the severeness of this
inconsistency by keeping 4t small, but one should be aware of its fundamental
nature. Another problem arises if the structure variables are kept constant over the
</p>
<p>time step 4t . In nuclear burning regions, for example, temperature and density are
usually rising with time. Therefore, they would be underestimated in the nuclear
</p>
<p>reactions if kept constant over 4t , and so would be the chemical changes due to
nuclear burning. This effect leads to an overestimate of main-sequence lifetimes.
</p>
<p>Again, it can be minimized by using very small values for 4t , or by a clever
prediction how T and � (and other quantities) may change during a time step.</p>

</p>
<p>Boundary Conditions
</p>
<p>As usual in mathematical physics, the boundary conditions constitute an important
</p>
<p>part of the whole problem, and their influence on the solutions is not easy to foresee.
</p>
<p>This is connected with the fact that the boundary conditions for the problem of
</p>
<p>stellar structure cannot be imposed at one end of the interval [0,M ] only but rather
</p>
<p>are split into some that are given at the centre and some near the surface of the
</p>
<p>star. The central conditions are simple, whereas the surface conditions implicate
</p>
<p>observable quantities and a completely different, much more complicated transport
</p>
<p>equation. It is therefore advisable to get some feeling about their influence on the
</p>
<p>stellar structure. We discuss these problems for the case of complete equilibrium.
</p>
<p>11.1 Central Conditions
</p>
<p>Two boundary conditions can be immediately written down for the centre, defined
</p>
<p>by m D 0. Since the density % must go to a reasonable, finite, and non-vanishing
value (there can be no singularity and no cavity in the centre), we must have r D 0.
And since the energy sources also remain finite (positive or negative), l must vanish
</p>
<p>at the centre as well:
</p>
<p>m D 0 W r D 0; l D 0: (11.1)
</p>
<p>This was the simple part. Unfortunately nothing is a priori known about the central
</p>
<p>values of pressure Pc and temperature Tc, so the conditions (11.1) still allow a two-
</p>
<p>parameter set of solutions, obtained by outward integrations starting with arbitrary
</p>
<p>Pc; Tc; and r D l D 0.
It is useful to know the behaviour of the four functions r; l; P; T in the vicinity
</p>
<p>of the centre,m! 0, for a given time t D t0. The equation of continuity (10.1) may
be written as

<p>11.2 Surface Conditions 95
</p>
<p>11.2 Surface Conditions
</p>
<p>The strict surface conditions are rather complicated and unwieldy. For rough
</p>
<p>estimates one might therefore prefer to use a crude approximation, provided that
</p>
<p>it is simple.
</p>
<p>An extreme step in this direction would be to take the naRıve &ldquo;zero conditions&rdquo;
</p>
<p>m!M W P ! 0; T ! 0: (11.10)
</p>
<p>These at least reflect correctly the fact that, in the outermost region of the star, P
</p>
<p>and T go to very small values compared to those in the interior. But, of course, in
</p>
<p>reality, there is a gradual and rather extended transition to the finite values of P; T
</p>
<p>of the diffuse interstellar medium.
</p>
<p>The next step is to find a sphere that we can reasonably call the &ldquo;surface&rdquo; of the
</p>
<p>star and that defines the total stellar radius r D R: The theory of stellar atmospheres
suggests the use of the photosphere, from where the bulk of the radiation is emitted
</p>
<p>into space, and which is found where the optical depth � of the overlying layers,
</p>

</p>
<p>% dr; (11.11)
</p>
<p>is equal to 2/3. Here we have defined a mean opacity N�, averaged over the stellar
atmosphere. In hydrostatic equilibrium the pressure at this level is given by the
</p>
<p>weight of the matter above. We can well approximate the gravitational acceleration
</p>
<p>by the constant value g0 D GM=R2; since the bulk of the matter in these layers is
anyway very close to the photosphere. Then

</p>
<p>and if we eliminate here the integral over % by that in the second equation (11.11),
</p>
<p>we find with � D 2=3 that

</p>
<p>The temperature at the photosphere is equal to the effective temperature TrDR D Teff

<p>L D 4�R2� T 4eff: (11.14)
</p>
<p>Here � D ac=4 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant of radiation. Teff is thus the
temperature of that black body which yields the same surface flux of energy as
</p>
<p>the star.
</p>
<p>In (11.11) we have replaced � by an average value. As we usually have detailed
</p>
<p>knowledge about the opacity, an obvious improvement is to take into account the
</p>
<p>pressure (or density) and temperature dependency of �. This requires knowledge
</p>
<p>about the temperature stratification in the atmosphere. One common approach is to</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>which obviously results in T D Teff for � D 2=3.
Equation (11.11) can be transformed into a differential equation for the radius,

<p>dr=d� D �1=.�%/, and with dP=dr D �g% we obtain

<p>dP

</p>
<p>(11.16)
</p>
<p>which is to be integrated from � D 0 to � D 2=3 with the boundary condition
P.� D 0/ D 0. The Eddington approximation (11.15) is used to determine �.P; T /.
For the gravitational acceleration on the right-hand side of (11.16) we can savely use
</p>
<p>GM=R2. We thus obtain an improved value for PrDR. This approach is called the
Eddington grey atmosphere because of the use of the Eddington approximation and
</p>
<p>the Rosseland mean for the opacity, and it is indeed used in stellar evolution codes,
</p>
<p>which solve the stellar structure equations (10.1)&ndash;(10.5) fromm D 0 to m D M .
The photospheric conditions (11.13) and (11.14) or (11.16) and (11.14) represent
</p>
<p>two relations between the surface values (m!M ) of the functions P; T; r; l . They
are certainly a better approximation for the surface conditions than (11.10). Their
</p>
<p>severest defect is that they refer to a level where the assumption made for deriving
</p>
<p>the transport equation (5.12) (small mean free path of the photons) breaks down.
</p>
<p>At this level, one should use the more complicated transport equation for stellar
</p>
<p>atmospheres. Indeed such attempts have been made, and full stellar atmosphere
</p>
<p>models are connected to those of the stellar interior at a suitable optical depth.
</p>
<p>Examples are the work by Schlattl et al. (1997) for the solar case and VandenBerg
</p>
<p>et al. (2008) for low-mass stars.
</p>
<p>Quite generally, the correct surface conditions can be formulated as follows: the
</p>
<p>interior solution should fit smoothly to a solution of the stellar-atmosphere problem.
</p>
<p>Let us put this into a more mathematical form.
</p>
<p>The transition between interior and outer (atmospheric) solutions is made at a
</p>
<p>certain mass value mF, the &ldquo;fitting mass&rdquo;, which should be far enough in to ensure
</p>
<p>that the interior equations are still valid there. On the other hand,mF should still be
</p>
<p>close enough toM that, for simplicity, we can always use thermally adjusted outer
</p>
<p>solutions with constant l D L. The smallerM �mF, the less energy can be stored
or released in these outer layers.
</p>
<p>For the stellar-interior problem, we consider the mass M and the chemical
</p>
<p>composition to be given. The theory of stellar atmospheres tells us that for given
</p>
<p>M and Xi.M/, there is a two-parameter set of possible atmospheric solutions,
</p>
<p>the parameters being, for example, R and Teff, or R and L [which are connected
</p>
<p>by (11.14)]. Any one of these possible atmospheric solutions can be extended
</p>
<p>by integration downwards to mF and may yield there the four &ldquo;exterior&rdquo; values
</p>
<p>r D rexF ; P D P exF ; T D T exF ; l D lexF D L.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.2 Surface Conditions 97
</p>
<p>The outer boundary conditions now require for m D mF that one quartet
rexF ; : : : ; l

F obtained from an outer solution has to match the corresponding values
</p>
<p>r inF ; : : : ; l

</p>
<p>rexF D r inF ; P exF D P inF ; T exF D T inF ; lexF D l inF : (11.17)
</p>
<p>These four simultaneous fits are in principle possible, since the solutions have
</p>
<p>enough degrees of freedom: the interior solution has two (we can vary the
</p>
<p>central values Pc and Tc/, and the outer solution also has two (variation of R
</p>
<p>and L/: The fact that both solutions have two degrees of freedom is reflected
</p>
<p>in the following alternative representation, which is often used in numerical
</p>
<p>computations. Imagine that many outer integrations are carried out for many
</p>
<p>pairs of parameters R and L: At m D mF, they yield the four functions

<p>lexF D L: The first one is certainly well behaved, and we can invert it without
complications, obtaining R D R.rexF ; L). This is now used to replace the argument
R in the functions P exF and T

<p>11.3 Influence of the Surface Conditions and Properties
</p>
<p>of Envelope Solutions
</p>
<p>We confine ourselves here to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stars in complete (mechanical and thermal)
</p>
<p>equilibrium. For the outer envelope of such a star, it is characteristic that l and m
</p>
<p>vary very little over wide ranges of r (This is because " is negligible and % is very
</p>
<p>small; for example, only about 10% of the solar mass lies outside r D Rˇ=2.). This
allows the derivation of approximate solutions that demonstrate the influence of the
</p>
<p>outer layers on the interior solution.
</p>
<p>11.3.1 Radiative Envelopes
</p>
<p>Since m varies so little in the envelope, it seems advisable to take another
</p>
<p>independent variable, for which we may choose the pressure P , since it varies
</p>
<p>monotonically with m. The equation of radiative transport is derived from (5.12)
</p>

</p>
<p>Comparing this with (11.26) and (11.27), we see that in Fig. 11.2, the solutions
</p>
<p>with C &gt; 0 lie above that with C D 0 and that they have a smaller slope, r &lt;
2=8:5. The layers are therefore all the more radiative. For P 2 � C equation (11.25)
becomes T 8:5 � BC = constant. This shows that towards the surface these solutions
tend to a constant (and rather high) T: Three of them (for 3 different values C1 &lt;
</p>
<p>C2 &lt; C3 of C/ are illustrated by solid lines on the left of Fig. 11.2. On each line,
</p>
<p>one point corresponds to the photosphere with T D Teff. Obviously we will find
such radiative-envelope solutions below the photospheres with Teff larger than some
</p>
<p>critical value (close to 104K). Towards the interior, P will finally increase so far
</p>
<p>that P 2 � C in (11.25) and the solution approximates closely that for C = 0. Since
all solutions with C &gt; 0 asymptotically approach the solution C D 0, the precise
starting values at the surface do not greatly influence the solution in the deep interior.

<p>11.3 Influence of the Surface Conditions and Properties of Envelope Solutions 101
</p>
<p>which with (11.26) and (11.27) shows that these solutions lie below the curve for
</p>
<p>C D 0 and that their slope is larger, r &gt; 2=8:5. A discussion quite analogous to
that for C &gt; 0 shows immediately that these solutions have the structure indicated
</p>
<p>in Fig. 11.2 by the dotted line. They bend downwards from the line C D 0, become
gradually steeper, and tend vertically to a finite P for T ! 0 (With a proper scaling
of the coordinates the curvesC &gt; 0 andC &lt; 0 are simply symmetric with respect to
</p>
<p>the line C = 0.). However, the assumption of radiative transport breaks down when
</p>
<p>convection sets in, which is the case for r D rad (see Sect. 6.1). This is close to 0.4
in the interior of not too massive stars, while ionization effects near the surface can
</p>
<p>make it considerably smaller (see Chap. 14). This limit is derived by equating the
</p>
<p>right-hand side of (11.26) with rad:
</p>
<p>T 8:5 D 0:235rad
BP 2: (11.30)
</p>
<p>For constant rad this corresponds to a straight line given by lgT = (2 lgP C lgB
C lg(0.235/rad))/8.5. For rad D 0:4 this lower border for radiative solutions is
plotted in Fig. 11.2 (dashed line). Near the surface, ionization effects decrease rad
considerably below 0.4, and therefore the border line should be curved upwards in
</p>
<p>its lowest part.
</p>
<p>11.3.2 Convective Envelopes
</p>
<p>The radiative solutions with C &lt; 0 extending from the interior have to be terminated
</p>
<p>at the broken line in Fig. 11.2 given by (11.30), where convection sets in, and have
</p>
<p>to be replaced in the outer regions by solutions valid for convective transport. Three
</p>
<p>such convective solutions are shown as solid lines in the lower part of Fig. 11.2. In
</p>
<p>order to construct them we have to consider their slope d lgT/d lgP (= r). As long
as the solutions stay in regions of high enough density, convection is very effective
</p>
<p>(cf. Sect. 7.3) and the slope is equal to the adiabatic gradient rad.
We can start the convective solutions near the border of convection with a slope
</p>
<p>given by r D rad = 0.4. With decreasing temperature the curves come into regions
where the most abundant elements (hydrogen and helium) are no longer completely
</p>
<p>ionized (see Chap. 14). For hydrogen this occurs around T D 104K, depending
somewhat on P (cf. the dependence of the Saha equation on the electron density).
</p>
<p>Partial ionization depresses rad appreciably below 0.4 such that the curves with a
slope r D rad are less steep and closely approach one another.
</p>
<p>Finally the curves come into regions of such low density that convection is
</p>
<p>ineffective and the stratification is over-adiabatic, r &gt; rad (Chap. 7). Correspond-
ingly the curves in Fig. 11.2 become rather steep until they reach the photospheric
</p>
<p>point. Unfortunately the precise slope r in the over-adiabatic part can only be
calculated from a convection theory, with all its uncertainties. Anyway, convective
</p>
<p>envelopes start at cool photospheres, and with decreasing Teff, the convection</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>102 11 Boundary Conditions
</p>
<p>gradually reaches deeper into the interior. Small variations (due to numerical or
</p>
<p>physical uncertainties) of Teff or of the over-adiabatic part lead to curves that are
</p>
<p>widely separated in the interior.
</p>
<p>11.3.3 Summary
</p>
<p>Making a few simplifying assumptions, we have been able to derive conve-
</p>
<p>nient solutions for the temperature-pressure stratification of stellar envelopes,
</p>
<p>i.e. for the layers below the photosphere. In the case of radiative envelopes,
</p>
<p>the assumptions concerned �;m; and l . An opacity law like (11.21) is cer-
</p>
<p>tainly a poor approximation if one takes the same values of a; b; �0 for too
</p>
<p>wide a range, or for very different envelopes. The discussions can, however,
</p>
<p>be easily repeated for different values of a; b; �0 [e.g. a D 0; b D 0; �0 D
0:2.1 C XH), as in the case of electron scattering, Sect. 17.1] giving essentially
similar results. The assumption l D constant certainly holds for T &lt; 106K, where
nuclear burning is negligible, though the assumption m D constant D M breaks
downmuch earlier. But, even if we stress these assumptions somewhat by extending
</p>
<p>the solutions too far inwards, we will still obtain the correct qualitative behaviour.
</p>
<p>Radiative envelopes are found below all hot photospheres (T &gt; 9; 000K).
</p>
<p>Towards the deep interior these solutions converge rapidly to the solution with
</p>
<p>C D 0. The interior is therefore relatively insensitive to details of the outer boundary
conditions, in particular to the photospheric details.
</p>
<p>Below cool atmospheres there are convective envelopes, which extend farther
</p>
<p>downwards the smaller Teff is. This suggests that a minimum value of Teff might
</p>
<p>exist where the whole star has become convective (cf. the Hayashi line, Chap. 24).
</p>
<p>The inward extension of the convective part depends rather sensitively on the precise
</p>
<p>position of the photosphere and the details of the over-adiabatic layer. Small changes
</p>
<p>in even the outer solution, which are otherwise rather unimportant, can exert a
</p>
<p>remarkable influence on the interior, and the same is true for the uncertainties in
</p>
<p>the treatment of superadiabatic convection.
</p>
<p>11.3.4 The T�r Stratification
</p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to know how T D T .r/ increases below the photosphere.
From the definition of r � d lnT=d lnP we have dT D TrdP=P , where we
replace dP by using the hydrostatic equation in the form

f D 5:4 � 106K. This large value of f provides for a very rapid increase of T
below the photosphere. Within only 2% of the radius, T has reached 105K. And
</p>
<p>at r � 0:8R (where m � 0:99M still) the temperature exceeds 106K, which also
shows that the &ldquo;average&rdquo; T for all mass elements of the star is well above 106K.</p>

</p>
<p>Numerical Procedure
</p>
<p>For realistic material functions no analytic solutions are possible, so that one
</p>
<p>depends all the more on numerical solutions of the basic differential equations.
</p>
<p>Consequently the activity and the number of results in this field has increased with
</p>
<p>the numerical capabilities. The growth of computing facilities by leaps and bounds
</p>
<p>since the 1960s may be illustrated by a remark of Schwarzschild (1958): &ldquo;A person
</p>
<p>can perform more than twenty integration steps per day&rdquo;, so that &ldquo;for a typical
</p>
<p>single integration consisting of, say, forty steps, less than two days are needed&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The situation has changed drastically since those days when the scientist&rsquo;s need for
</p>
<p>meals and sleep was an essential factor in the total computing time for one model.
</p>
<p>Nowadays one asks rather for the number of solutions produced per second. And
</p>
<p>these modern solutions are enormously more refined (numerically and physically)
</p>
<p>than those produced 40 years ago. This progress has been possible because of
</p>
<p>the introduction of large and fast electronic computers and the simultaneous
</p>
<p>development of an adequate numerical procedure connected with the name of
</p>
<p>L.G. Henyey. His method for calculating models in hydrostatic equilibrium is now
</p>
<p>generally used and will be described later. For more details and for further references
</p>
<p>see Kippenhahn et al. (1967). If inertia terms with Rr &curren; 0 become important, one
needs a so-called &ldquo;hydrodynamic&rdquo; procedure (see Sect. 12.3).
</p>
<p>12.1 The Shooting Method
</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see that the appropriate choice of a numerical procedure is
</p>
<p>anything but a trivial matter. Consider the simplest case, the calculation of a model
</p>
<p>in complete equilibrium at a given time, for given mass M and given chemical
</p>
<p>composition Xi .m/. The &ldquo;spatial problem&rdquo; can then be separated and is described
</p>
<p>by the structure equations (10.1), (10.2), (10.4) and (10.16). The naRıve attempt
simply to integrate them from one boundary to the other would encounter the
</p>
<p>difficulty that the boundary conditions are split, one pair being given at the centre,

</p>
<p>the other at the surface. Moreover, a test calculation starting with trial values
</p>
<p>Pc; Tc at the centre has little chance of meeting the correct surface conditions.
</p>
<p>Outward integrations differing only a little near the centre have the tendency to
</p>
<p>diverge strongly when approaching the surface (see Sect. 11.3). The reason is
</p>
<p>that for radiative transport (10.4) with (10.6) contains the factor T �4. For inward
integrations starting with trial values R;L at the surface another divergence occurs
</p>
<p>near the centre owing to the singularity produced by the factor r�4 in (10.2).
A compromise between these two possibilities is a fitting procedure often used
</p>
<p>in earlier, non-automized computations. Outward and inward integrations were both
</p>
<p>carried to an intermediate fitting point, where they were fitted smoothly to each
</p>
<p>other by a gradual variation of the trial values Pc, Tc and R;L: The simultaneous
</p>
<p>fit of four variables (r; P; T; l) is, in principle, possible, since one can vary four
</p>
<p>free parameters .Pc; Tc; R;L/ in the partial solutions. The fitting point is preferably
</p>
<p>chosen to be at the interface between physically different regions. For example,
</p>
<p>one takes the border between a convective central core and a radiative envelope, or
</p>
<p>between regions of different composition.
</p>
<p>Fitting methods turned out to be unsuitable for calculating large series of
</p>
<p>complicatedmodels. For these purposes they were generally replaced by the Henyey
</p>
<p>method. There are, however, certain applications where a fitting method is still
</p>
<p>unsurpassed, for example, if one wishes to find all possible solutions for given
</p>
<p>core and envelope parameters. Another application is the generation of the very
</p>
<p>first model for an evolutionary sequence, since the relaxation methods, which will
</p>
<p>be introduced in the next section, always need a trial model for finding a solution.
</p>
<p>For chemically homogeneous stars the shooting methods are well suited to construct
</p>
<p>such initial models.
</p>
<p>12.2 The Henyey Method
</p>
<p>This method is very practical, especially for solving boundary-value problems
</p>
<p>where the conditions are given at both ends of the interval. A trial solution for
</p>
<p>the whole interval is gradually improved upon in consecutive iterations until the
</p>
<p>required degree of accuracy is reached. In each iteration, corrections to all variables
</p>
<p>at all points are evaluated in such a way that the effect of each of them on the whole
</p>
<p>solution (including the boundaries) is taken into account. In a generalized Newton&ndash;
</p>
<p>Raphson method, corrections are obtained from linearized algebraic equations.
</p>
<p>For spherical stars in hydrostatic equilibrium we have the partial differential
</p>
<p>equations (10.1)&ndash;(10.5) together with boundary conditions at the centre and at
</p>
<p>the surface. In addition the proper initial values have to be specified as well as
</p>
<p>the stellar mass M: The general structure of the system of equations suggests
</p>
<p>that one should treat two subsystems separately and alternately. First, the system
</p>
<p>(10.1)&ndash;(10.4) is solved for given Xi.m/, then (10.5) is applied to a small time step
</p>
<p>�t; after which (10.1)&ndash;(10.4) is solved for the new values of Xi .m/, and so on.
</p>
<p>In modern language such an approach is called operator splitting. In this way one</p>

<p>12.2 The Henyey Method 107
</p>
<p>can construct a whole evolutionary sequence of models (But one should be aware
</p>
<p>of the fundamental inconsistency inherent to this approach, which was discussed in
</p>
<p>Chap. 10.). We now describe in detail the first of these two steps, the solution of the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;spatial system&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>If there is complete equilibrium ( Rr D PP D PT D 0), the initial values to be given
are theXi .m/, so that we can treat them as known parameters for any point. Accord-
</p>

</p>
<p>(10.1), (10.2), (10.4) and (10.16) can be replaced by their dependencies upon P

</p>
<p>(10.4) and (10.16) for the four unknown variables r; P; T; l in the interval [0, M ]
</p>
<p>(whereM is also thought to be given).
</p>
<p>The case of hydrostatic equilibrium (Rr D 0) but thermal non-equilibrium
. PP &curren; 0, PT &curren; 0) is almost equivalent, the only difference being the additional term
"g in (10.3), which contains the partial derivatives PP and PT : This requires as initial
values for the earlier time t0 � �t not only the Xi.m/ but also T .m/ and P.m/
(See the remarks on possible initial values in Chap. 10.). Assume that we take them
</p>
<p>from a &ldquo;foregoing&rdquo; solution, calling these given functions P �.m/; T �.m/. At any
point m D mj , we denote the variables by Pj ; Tj and replace the time derivatives
PPj ; PTj by

.Pj � P �j /; PTj D

</p>
<p>The given values of �t; P �j ; T

j can now be considered known parameters. Then
</p>
<p>PPj ; PTj are functions of Pj ; Tj only, as is the case with all material functions, and
therefore we can also consider "g to be replaced by the function "g.P; T ), and the
</p>
<p>situation is as before with the complete equilibrium models: we again have the
</p>
<p>four ordinary differential equations (10.1)&ndash;(10.4) for the four unknown variables
</p>
<p>r; P; T; l , but with a somewhat different right-hand side of (10.3).

next step is discretization, i.e. we proceed from the differential equations (12.2)
</p>
<p>to corresponding difference equations for a finite mass interval [mj ; mjC1&#141;: Let us
denote the variables at both ends of this interval by upper indices, for example,

<p>The difference equations (12.4) and (12.1) represent a linearization of the differ-
</p>
<p>ential equations and are therefore an approximation, the accuracy of which has to
</p>
<p>be controlled. Obviously, the smaller �t and �mj D mj � mj�1, the better the
approximation. In practical circumstances the spatial discretization is not constant
</p>
<p>throughout the stellar model, but depends on the changes of the physical variables.
</p>
<p>A good approach is to choose�mj for each j such, that all variables change by less
</p>
<p>than a predefined upper limit between points j and j � 1. That maximum change
will differ between variables and has to be determined by numerical experiments
</p>
<p>reducing it to a limit from where on the numerical solution no longer depends on the
</p>
<p>�mj significantly. Apart from this basic control algorithm there are more advanced
</p>
<p>methods, which, for example, take into account not only the slope but the curvature
</p>
<p>of the functions T .m/, P.m/ (Wagenhuber and Weiss 1994). The advantage of this
</p>
<p>method is that it is sensitive to deviations from linear behaviour. It places many grid
</p>
<p>points where the variables are a strongly non-linear function ofm, while it uses very
</p>
<p>few in the opposite case. Wagenhuber called this the curvature method, as opposed
</p>
<p>to the simpler gradient method.
</p>
<p>It is possible to exclude the outermost envelope of the star from the iteration
</p>
<p>procedure, since time-consuming computations may be necessary for this part (e.g.
</p>
<p>partial ionization and superadiabatic convection). With sufficient computing power
</p>
<p>this is no longer a necessity, however. Another situation where this would be

<p>advisable is when fully realistic atmospheres are to be connected to the interior
</p>
<p>of the star, since the diffusion approximation (10.6) is not valid at m D M but at
some deeper layer where the optical depth � � 1. The lower boundary of such an
atmosphere then provides the upper boundary of the interior model. As described
</p>
<p>in Sect. 11.2 the outer boundary conditions are imposed at a fitting mass mF, which
</p>
<p>may have the special value m D M and may have the upper index j D 1, and they
are formulated by the two equations (11.18) that relate the variables y11 ; : : : ; y

</p>
<p>require several iterations, since the numerical solution of (12.13) has only limited

<p>If a time sequence of models is to be produced, one can now change the

<p>new P �.m/; T �.m/]. The new model for t C �t is then calculated by the Henyey
method in the same manner as for the model for t:
</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that the iteration procedure for improving the
</p>
<p>approximations really does converge. In fact often enough one finds divergence if
</p>
<p>the chosen approximation is too far from the solution; then the required corrections
</p>
<p>are so large that one cannot neglect the second-order terms when evaluating
</p>
<p>ıBi ; ıA
j

<p>wrong corrections.
</p>
<p>What happens, on the other hand, if we take a given precise solution as the &ldquo;first
</p>
<p>approximation&rdquo;? It fulfils (12.8) such that the right-hand sides of (12.14) vanish.
</p>
<p>Equation (12.14) is then a system of homogeneous linear equations, which for det
</p>
<p>H &curren; 0 has only the trivial solution ıyji D 0: in this (normal) case, there is no other
solution (&ldquo;local uniqueness&rdquo; as mentioned in Sect. 12.6). If, however, det H D 0,
then we obtain solutions ıy

i &curren; 0, i.e. other solutions for the same parameters.
</p>
<p>In this somewhat pathological situation the &ldquo;local uniqueness&rdquo; of the solution is

</p>
<p>The Henyey matrix and its determinant are obviously important quantities.
</p>
<p>This concerns also their connection with the stability properties (see Sect. 12.6).
</p>
<p>It is worthwhile noting the general structure of H; which turns out to be very
</p>
<p>simple. This is most easily demonstrated by considering the simple &ldquo;three-layer

<p>borders on neither of these two boundaries, so that the full generality of possible

<p>zero, since some basic equations do not depend on all variables [e.g. (10.16) does not

<p>contain y1 D r]. Outside the dotted area there are only zero elements, because the
first-order scheme (12.13) connects only neighbouring points. The Henyey matrix

<p>therefore has non-vanishing elements only in overlapping blocks along the main

<p>algorithms for computing det H and inverting the matrix through elimination

</p>
<p>evolution codes is that by Henyey et al. (1964), which was described in all details
</p>
<p>by Kippenhahn et al. (1967). The basic idea is to express the corrections of the

innermost one), for which the corrections are determined by matrix inversion, and
</p>
<p>from which on then all the other corrections can be calculated by going backwards
</p>
<p>again. The Henyey method has K inversions of matrices of size 4 � 8 instead of
straightforwardly inverting the Henyey matrix of size K � K . It therefore grows
only linearly&ndash;instead of quadratically&ndash;with increasing number of grid points.
</p>
<p>12.3 Treatment of the First- and Second-Order
</p>
<p>Time Derivatives
</p>
<p>When devising a numerical scheme for solving our partial differential equations
</p>
<p>one can choose many details more or less arbitrarily without greatly affecting the
</p>
<p>results. This concerns questions such as the prescription for averaging between
</p>
<p>spatial mesh points, and the definition of the variables; these can be, for example, the
</p>
<p>physical quantities themselves, their logarithms, or any other functions describing
</p>
<p>them properly.
</p>
<p>Concerning the manner in which the time derivatives are approximated, one
</p>
<p>distinguishes between explicit and implicit schemes that are known to behave
</p>
<p>differently, in particular when one is dealing with second-order time derivatives.
</p>
<p>Forward integration in time, starting from given initial values, can require time steps
</p>
<p>of various length, and the results can be unstable with respect to small numerical
</p>
<p>errors. In Sect. 12.2 we encountered examples of both types of scheme:
</p>
<p>An explicit scheme was indicated in the case of the chemical equations (10.5).
</p>
<p>Consider the time interval between tn (at which all variables qn are supposed
</p>
<p>to be known) and tnC1 (for which the variables qnCl are to be calculated). We
may use (10.5) simply in order to calculate time derivatives PXni of the chemical
composition from the known reaction rates rnik and densities %
</p>
<p>n: The composition
</p>
<p>for tnCl is then evaluated asXnC1i D Xni C�t PXni before the other variables for this
time are derived. In fact theXnC1i are used as fixed parameters when calculating the
solution at tnC1 by iteration. Such a procedure is relatively simple, and in general,
the results can be sufficiently accurate if the time steps are kept small enough.
</p>
<p>However, there is no guarantee to prevent unphysical solutions in explicit methods.
</p>
<p>For example, if PXni is sufficiently negative even a small time step might lead to a
negative XnC1i . To prevent this, an implicit treatment is indicated. If PXi depends
on the chemical abundances itself, as is the case for the nuclear reactions (10.5),
</p>
<p>the abundance at tnC1 is used on the right-hand side, too. This constitutes a set of
implicit equations, which need to be solved by inversion methods, but which are
</p>
<p>numerically stable. An easy way is by writing XnC1i D Xni C�t PXni D Xni C�Xni
and linearizing the equations in the �Xni , neglecting all higher terms. The resulting
</p>
<p>system of equations is linear in �Xni and can be solved by one matrix inversion.
</p>
<p>However, the quality of the linearization again depends on the size of �t . Such</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>114 12 Numerical Procedure
</p>
<p>implicit schemes are generally used to solve networks of nuclear reactions, where
</p>
<p>the terms PXni may vary by many order of magnitudes.
In the set of structure equations (10.1)&ndash;(10.4) to be solved at time tnC1i for given
</p>
<p>XnC1i the energy equation (10.3) contains the time derivatives of PP and T . With
respect to these an implicit scheme was used in Sect. 12.2. According to (12.1) the
PP and PT are replaced by (P nC1�P n/=�t and (T nC1�T n/=�t , respectively. These
time derivatives are therefore considered to depend also on the variables at time tnC1
</p>
<p>and are evaluated together with them in the iteration procedure. In principle one
</p>
<p>could also have used an explicit method. For example, replace PP and PT in (10.3) by
the time derivative of the entropy s and use this equation only in order to evaluate
</p>
<p>Psn at time tn: Then, as in the case of the chemical composition, the solution for tnC1
is calculated for a given, fixed entropy snC1 D snC�t Psn from the other equations.
</p>
<p>It is well known that, for differential equations that involve first-order derivatives
</p>
<p>in time and first- (or higher-) order spatial derivatives, implicit methods allow larger
</p>
<p>time steps for a given spacing in mass; for explicit difference schemes the time step
</p>
<p>has to be kept small to avoid numerical instability (For details see, for instance,
</p>
<p>Richtmyer and Morton 1967.).
</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the so-calledhydrodynamical problem, which arises when the
</p>
<p>inertial term in the equation of motion cannot be neglected. Then in addition to the
</p>
<p>first-order time derivatives in (10.3) there is a second-order time derivative in (10.2),
</p>
<p>as in (2.16). One usually introduces the radial velocity
</p>
<p>v D @r
@t
</p>
<p>(12.16)
</p>
<p>of the mass elements as a new variable, with which (10.2) becomes
</p>

<p>@m
D � Gm
</p>
<p>4�r4
� 1
4�r2
</p>
<p>@v
</p>
<p>@t
: (12.17)
</p>
<p>When using (12.16) and (12.17) instead of (2.16) one has again to deal with first-
</p>
<p>order time derivatives only. These can be replaced by ratios of differences, and one
</p>
<p>can use an explicit or an implicit scheme as before, the explicit being simpler but
</p>
<p>demanding smaller time steps. However, this is not the only choice to be made. For
</p>
<p>example, within the framework of an explicit method, the different variables can be
</p>
<p>defined at different times (say, the radius values at tn; tnC1; : : :, and the velocities at
the intermediate times tn�1=2; tnC1=2; : : :). Furthermore, one may devise a scheme
which treats the mechanical equations explicitly but is implicit with respect to the
</p>
<p>time derivatives in the energy equation (10.3).
</p>
<p>The presence of the second-order time derivatives changes the properties of the
</p>
<p>equations and the behaviour of the numerical procedure considerably. Whenever an
</p>
<p>explicit scheme is used, the time steps have to be kept small in order to fulfil the
</p>
<p>Courant condition, according to which the time step �t must not exceed �r=vs,
</p>
<p>where �r is the thickness of the smallest mass shell and vs is the local velocity of
</p>
<p>sound.</p>

<p>12.4 Treatment of the Diffusion Equation 115
</p>
<p>12.4 Treatment of the Diffusion Equation
</p>
<p>The diffusion equation (8.25) contains first-order derivatives in time and second-
</p>
<p>order derivatives in space for the N chemical species. It may be supplemented by
</p>
<p>the nuclear reactions of (10.5), and by the additional term for diffusive convective
</p>
<p>mixing (8.28) to achieve a consistent treatment of &ldquo;burning and mixing&rdquo;, but these
</p>
<p>terms do not change the nature of the equations further.
</p>
<p>The left-hand side of (8.25) can again be written as .Xi.t C �t/ � Xi .t//=�t ,
andXi .tC�t/ is the quantity to be determined. As with the nuclear reactions (10.5)
discussed in 12.3, an implicit scheme is to be preferred for sake of numerical
</p>
<p>stability, implying that on the right-hand side Xi.t C �t/ is used, too. This
constitutes at each grid point a set of N implicit equations, which can be solved
</p>
<p>either through linearization or iteration. However, in contrast to the situation we
</p>
<p>found for the nuclear network, these sets of equations are now coupled between grid
</p>
<p>points due to the spatial derivatives of the diffusion equation.
</p>
<p>These second-order spatial derivatives of, for example, lnT , are calculated in two
</p>
<p>steps. First, the first-order derivative for grid point j is approximated in the standard
</p>
<p>way by
</p>
<p>� lnT j
</p>
<p>�rj
D lnT
</p>
<p>j � ln T j�1
rj � rj�1 (12.18)
</p>
<p>and similarly for j C 1. Then the second-order derivative at grid point j can be
calculated from

; (12.19)
</p>
<p>where Nrj is a suitable mean value for r in the interval .j; j C 1/. In the simplest
case it is the arithmetic mean and thus the denominator in (12.19) reduces to
</p>
<p>.rjC1 � rj�1/=2. All other quantities in (8.25) appearing in front of the first-order
derivatives, such as AT .i/, also have to be taken as mean quantities for the second
</p>
<p>derivative in analogy to (12.19).We note that the spatial derivatives are defined here
</p>
<p>at each grid point, contrary to the system of equations (12.3), where the derivatives
</p>
<p>were defined for the shell between j and j C 1. One may imagine that the shells
now are centred at a grid point, extending halfway to the neighbouring ones. The
</p>
<p>advantage of this definition is that the diffusion equations are defined at the same
</p>
<p>location as the nuclear network equations.

<p>In this way, the discretized equations for the N elements at the M � 2 grid

<p>system of equations is similar to (12.13) with the exception that three instead of

<p>two neighbouring grid points are connected. It is therefore obvious that the Henyey
</p>
<p>method will be applicable again, the only difference being that the block matrices
</p>
<p>are now of dimensionN � 3N .
The missing two equations to complete the system for the N elements result
</p>
<p>from the boundary conditions at j D 1 and j D M , which follow from mass
conservation. We follow here the formulation by Schlattl (1999), where also more
</p>
<p>technical details concerning the solution of (8.25) can be found.

<p>In (12.23), the linear expansion (11.3) of m at the centre was used to compute

We finally add that Schlattl (1999) justifies the Eulerian formulation for the
</p>
<p>diffusion equations, as opposed to our otherwise preferred Lagrangian one, with

<p>the necessity for very dense spatial resolution in situations of shallow convective

<p>12.5 Treatment of Mass Loss 117
</p>
<p>12.5 Treatment of Mass Loss
</p>
<p>The mass loss formulae (9.1)&ndash;(9.4) describe only how the stellar mass reduces with
</p>
<p>time due to stellar winds. Therefore, the treatment in stellar evolution calculations is
</p>
<p>very simple. Over a time step �t , during which the chemical composition changes
</p>
<p>as described in Sect. 12.3, the stellar mass will change according to
</p>
<p>M.t C�t/ DM.t/ ��M.t/ DM.t/ � PM.t/�t ; (12.24)
</p>
<p>where PM.t/ is the mass loss rate evaluated according to (9.1) or any other similar
prescription, using the stellar parameters at time t .
</p>
<p>In terms of the mass grid established in Sect. 12.2 a simple removal of all grid
</p>
<p>points i with mi � M.t/ � �M.t/ can be done. Such a procedure, of course,
ignores all effects of accelerating matter and moving it out of the star&rsquo;s gravitational
</p>
<p>potential. To treat this correctly, however, a hydrodynamical method with an open
</p>
<p>outer boundary would be needed, which in most cases is not necessary. Consider the
</p>
<p>energy spent to remove mass from the stellar surface to infinity. This is, according
</p>
<p>to (1.13), GM=R per mass unit of the stellar wind. Multiplying with the mass loss
</p>
<p>rate we obtain the result that . PMGM/=R erg/s are needed. For the Sun this amounts
to 1:2 � 1027 erg/s, which is only 10�7 of the solar luminosity, and can therefore be
safely ignored. For a very evolved red giant with very strong mass loss the energy
</p>
<p>spent for expelling mass can reach values up to 0.001 or even 1% of the stellar
</p>
<p>luminosity.
</p>
<p>While the simple removal of grid points is correct in terms of mass distribution
</p>
<p>and chemical composition, it is not taking into account thermal effects. Imaging
</p>
<p>a mass layer that was deep inside the stellar envelope now suddenly being the
</p>
<p>outermost one, since all overlying layers were expelled. It will be hotter than the
</p>
<p>surface layers have been before and temperature and pressure will not be that of a
</p>
<p>photosphere. Thermal relaxation will therefore set in. While the Sun is losing mass
</p>
<p>continuously, its surface temperature is constant. This is because the timescale for
</p>
<p>mass loss, �ML � M= PM is of the order of 1014 years and therefore much longer
than even the nuclear timescale. As long as �ML � �KH the outermost layers will
quickly expand and restore the previous photospheric conditions. The adjustment,
</p>
<p>of course, vanishes with increasing depth. Numerical schemes are therefore trying
</p>
<p>to take this into account: while grid points are removed due to mass loss, the
</p>
<p>thermal structure of the star remains almost unperturbed. In the opposite case, when
</p>
<p>�ML . �KH, the layers uncovered by mass loss indeed have no time to change
</p>
<p>their temperature (pressure can be adjusted, since �hydro is still much shorter). This,
</p>
<p>however, may happen only in binary systems during extrememass transfer episodes.
</p>
<p>In such cases, a hydrodynamical treatment of the complete system is indicated,
</p>
<p>anyhow.</p>

<p>118 12 Numerical Procedure
</p>
<p>12.6 Existence and Uniqueness
</p>
<p>As every numerical scheme, the Henyeymethod sometimes does not converge easily
</p>
<p>to a solution, and there are cases when it seems to oscillate between two solutions.
</p>
<p>While in most cases this is a purely numerical issue, resulting for example from
</p>
<p>insufficiently accurate derivatives, one wonders whether there could also be deeper
</p>
<p>mathematical reasons. This relates to questions about the existence and uniqueness
</p>
<p>of the solution. It is closely connected to the determinant of the Henyey matrix,
</p>
<p>as det H D 0 obviously does not allow an inversion for determining the ıyi and
detH � 0 will lead to numerical problems during the inversion.
</p>
<p>An old problem is whether, for stars in complete equilibrium and of given
</p>
<p>&ldquo;parameters&rdquo; (stellar mass M and chemical composition Xi ), there exists one,
</p>
<p>and only one, solution of the basic equations of stellar structure. From simple
</p>
<p>considerations concerning uncomplicated cases, answers to this question were given
</p>
<p>in the 1920s by Heinrich Vogt und Henry Norris Russell; however, there is no
</p>
<p>mathematical basis for this so-called Vogt&ndash;Russell theorem, and when by numerical
</p>
<p>experiments multiple solutions for the same parameters were found to exist it had
</p>
<p>to be abandoned. The conditions under which uniqueness is violated, and why, have
</p>
<p>therefore been investigated. A linearized treatment (concerning &ldquo;local&rdquo; uniqueness)
</p>
<p>is easier to understand, whereas non-linear results refer to the &ldquo;global&rdquo; behaviour
</p>
<p>of the solutions and require a more involved mathematical apparatus. Relevant
</p>
<p>work concerning these issues was done by Kähler (1972, 1975, 1978). For another
</p>
<p>representation, particularly of the linear problem, see Paczyński (1972).
</p>
<p>The mathematical discussion is usually restricted to models in complete or
</p>
<p>at least hydrostatic equilibrium and analyses the behaviour of solutions under
</p>
<p>(infinitesimally) small changes of the parameters. Mathematical conditions can be
</p>
<p>formulated when a solution is locally unique, which can be translated into the
</p>
<p>statement that the evolution&ndash;considered as being a change of parameters (chemical
</p>
<p>composition and/or entropy) with time&ndash;follows a unique sequence of solutions.
</p>
<p>However, there is no general statement about when such conditions are fulfilled. The
</p>
<p>condition for having a locally unique solution is equivalent to detH &curren; 0. But even
if this condition is fulfilled, there still might be multiple, well-separated solutions.
</p>
<p>If one of them is unstable, the star switches to the stable one when perturbed. This
</p>
<p>is related to the general stability of stars.
</p>
<p>Behind the mathematical question there is thus also interest concerning the
</p>
<p>predicted evolution of stars. For example, after learning that often more than one
</p>
<p>solution exists, that solutions can disappear, or that new solutions appear in pairs,
</p>
<p>one might begin to wonder whether the star really &ldquo;knows&rdquo; how to evolve. But we
</p>
<p>should keep in mind that normally the star will be brought into one particular state
</p>
<p>(corresponding to a certain solution) according to its history. And if the equations
</p>
<p>indicate that the evolution approaches a &ldquo;critical point&rdquo;, then this means in general
</p>
<p>only that the approximation used breaks down. For example, if an evolutionary
</p>
<p>sequence calculated for complete equilibrium comes to a critical point beyond
</p>
<p>which continuation is not possible, then the difficulties are normally removed by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.6 Existence and Uniqueness 119
</p>
<p>allowing for thermal non-equilibrium. Correspondingly if hydrostatic models that
</p>
<p>are not in thermal equilibrium evolve to a critical point, the difficulties are usually
</p>
<p>removed after the introduction of inertia terms. An example would be the reaction
</p>
<p>of a star when reaching the Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar limit (Sect. 30.5), where two
</p>
<p>existing solutions of complete equilibriummerge. The star easily switches from one
</p>
<p>to the other by leaving thermal equilibrium.
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, it was found that indeed several solutions for the same set of
</p>
<p>parameters (stellar mass M and chemical composition Xi ) exist but that they are
</p>
<p>widely separated and a star&rsquo;s evolution proceeds along a well-defined sequence of
</p>
<p>locally unique solutions.</p>

</p>
<p>Properties of Stellar Matter
</p>
<p>In addition to the basic variables .m; r; P; T; l) in terms of which we have
</p>
<p>formulated the problem, the differential equations of stellar structure (Sect. 10.1)
</p>
<p>also contain quantities such as density, nuclear energy generation, or opacity. These
</p>
<p>describe properties of stellar matter for given values of P and T and for a given
</p>
<p>chemical composition as indicated in (10.7)&ndash;(10.14) and are quantities that certainly
</p>
<p>do not depend on m; r; or l at the given point in the star. They could just as well
</p>
<p>describe the properties of matter in a laboratory for the same values of P; T; and
</p>
<p>chemical composition. We can therefore deal with them without specifying the star
</p>
<p>or the position in it for which we want to use them. In this chapter we shall discuss
</p>
<p>these &ldquo;material functions&rdquo;, and we start by specifying the dependence of the density
</p>
<p>% on P; T; and the chemical composition. This is described by an equation of state,
</p>
<p>which is especially simple if we have a perfect gas. We already discussed this case
</p>
<p>in Sect. 4.2. But radiation and ionization also influence the pressure and the internal
</p>
<p>energy. We therefore have to include them.</p>

<p>The Perfect Gas with Radiation
</p>
<p>13.1 Radiation Pressure
</p>
<p>The pressure in a star is not only given by that of the gas because the photons in
</p>
<p>the stellar interior can contribute considerably to the pressure, and therefore our
</p>
<p>discussion of the perfect gas of Sect. 4.2 has to be extended. Since the radiation is
</p>
<p>practically that of a black body (see Sect. 5.1.1), its pressure Prad is given by

<p>Prad D

</p>
<p>whereU is the energy density and a is the radiation density constant a D 7:56464�
10�15 erg cm�3 K�4. Then the total pressure P consists of the gas pressure Pgas and
radiation pressure Prad:

<p>For ˇ D 1 the radiation pressure is zero, while ˇ D 0 means that the gas pressure
is zero. The definition (13.3) can also be used if the gas is not perfect.
</p>
<p>Two other relations which can be derived by differentiation of (13.3) are
</p>
<p>sometimes useful:

<p>Ionization
</p>
<p>In Sect. 4.2 and Chap. 13 we assumed complete ionization of all atoms. This is
</p>
<p>a good approximation in the very deep interior, where T and P are sufficiently
</p>
<p>large, but the degree of ionization certainly becomes smaller if one approaches the
</p>
<p>stellar surface, where T and P are small. In the atmosphere of the Sun, for instance,
</p>
<p>hydrogen and helium atoms are neutral. When a gas is partially ionized the mean
</p>
<p>molecular weight and thermodynamic properties such as cP depend on the degree
</p>
<p>of ionization. It is the aim of this section to show how this can be calculated and
</p>
<p>how it influences the properties of the stellar gas.
</p>
<p>14.1 The Boltzmann and Saha Formulae
</p>
<p>We consider the atoms of a chemical element in a certain state of ionization,
</p>
<p>contained in a unit volume of gas in thermodynamic equilibrium. They are
</p>
<p>distributed over many states of excitation, which we denote by subscript s, and these
</p>
<p>different states can be degenerate such that the state of number s consists in reality
</p>
<p>of gs substates. The number gs is the statistical weight. Consider in particular the
</p>
<p>atoms of a certain element in state s and in the ground state s D 0, separated by
the energy difference  s , and the transition between both, say, by emission and
</p>
<p>absorption of photons. In equilibrium, the rate of such upward transitions is equal to
</p>
<p>that of downward transitions. This gives as the ratio between the numbers of atoms
</p>
<p>in the two states:
ns
</p>
<p>n0
D gs
g0
</p>
<p>e� s=kT : (14.1)
</p>
<p>Equation (14.1) is the well-known Boltzmann formula, which governs the distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of particles over states of different energy.
</p>
<p>Instead of referring to the atoms in the ground state, we want to compare the
</p>
<p>atoms of state s with the number n of all atoms of that element:

</p>
<p>We can also use the Boltzmann formula to determine the degree of ionization,
</p>
<p>but there are differences between excitation and ionization that require attention.
</p>
<p>Excitation concerns ions and bound electrons distributed over discrete states only.
</p>
<p>In the case of ionization the upper state consists of two separate particles, the
</p>
<p>ion and the electron; and the free electron has a continuous manifold of states.
</p>
<p>After ionization, say by absorption, the electron &ldquo;thrown out&rdquo; can have an arbitrary
</p>
<p>amount of kinetic energy, and recombination can occur with electrons of arbitrary
</p>
<p>kinetic energy.
</p>
<p>We say an atom is in the r th state of ionization if it has already lost r electrons.
</p>
<p>The energy necessary to take away the next electron from the ground state is �r .
</p>
<p>After ionization this electron is in general not at rest, but has a momentum relative
</p>
<p>to the atom of absolute value pe. Then p
2
e=.2me/ is its kinetic energy; therefore
</p>
<p>relative to its original bound state the free electron has the energy �r C p2e=.2me/,
while the state of ionization of the atom is now r C 1.
</p>
<p>Let us consider as the lower state an r-times ionized ion in the ground state. The
</p>
<p>upper state may be that of the (r C 1) times ionized ion plus the free electron with
momentum in the interval Œpe; pe C dpe&#141;. The number densities of ions in these two
states are nr and dnrC1. The statistical weight of the upper state is the product of
grC1 of the ion and of dg.pe/, the statistical weight of the free electron. Transitions
upwards and downwards occur between the two states with equal rates. In the case
</p>
<p>of thermodynamic equilibrium the Boltzmann formula (14.1) applies and gives

<p>This is the Saha equation (named after the physicist Meghnad Saha) though it is still

<p>14.2 Ionization of Hydrogen

<p>In order to see the consequences of the Saha equation we shall apply it to a pure

n0 C n1
</p>
<p>; (14.18)
</p>
<p>i.e. n1=n0 D x=.1� x/. If the gas is neutral, then x D 0; if it is completely ionized,
x D 1. Also the left-hand side of (14.17) can be replaced by xPe=.1 � x/, and if
n D n0 C n1 is the total number of hydrogen atoms, then we can relate the partial
pressure of the electrons to the total gas pressure:

</p>

<p>1C xPgas (14.20)

</p>
<p>h3
.kT /5=2 e��H=kT : (14.21)
</p>
<p>Here �H D 13:6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen. Now with (14.21) we have
come up with a quadratic equation for the degree of ionization that can be solved if
</p>
<p>T and Pgas are given. If radiation pressure is important, it is sufficient to give T and
</p>
<p>the total pressure P , and then Pgas can be obtained from (13.2).
</p>
<p>In order to compute the degree of ionization, the partition function has to be
</p>
<p>known. For this we need the statistical weights of the different states of excitation,
</p>
<p>which are given by quantum mechanics. Since the higher states contribute little to
</p>
<p>the partition function, we may approximate it by the weight of the ground state,
</p>
<p>u0 � g0;0 D 2, while for ionized hydrogen, u1 D 1 (see, for instance, Cox, 2000,
pp. 2&ndash;34).
</p>
<p>We now give some numerical examples. In the solar photosphere we have in cgs
</p>
<p>units Pgas D 1:01 � 105; T D 5; 779K, and we obtain x D 5 � 10�5, while in
a deeper layer with Pgas D 3:35 � 1012; T D 7:17 � 105K, hydrogen is almost
completely ionized: x D 0:985.
</p>
<p>Since in (14.21)KH increases with T and decreases with Pgas, and since the left-
</p>
<p>hand side increases with x, one can see that the degree of ionization increases with
</p>
<p>temperature and decreases with the gas pressure. This can be easily understood:
</p>
<p>with increasing temperature, the collisions become more violent, the photons more
</p>
<p>energetic, and the processes of &ldquo;kicking off&rdquo; the electrons from the atoms more
</p>
<p>frequent. If, on the other hand, the temperature is kept constant but the pressure
</p>
<p>increases, then the probability grows that the ion meets an electron and recombines.
</p>
<p>In Chap. 4 we have defined the mean molecular weight � for a mixture of gases
</p>
<p>and have seen that it is different for ionized and non-ionized gases. Therefore mean
</p>
<p>molecular weights depend on the degree of ionization.
</p>
<p>In order to determine � for the hydrogen gas having the degree of ionization x,
</p>
<p>we define the number E of free electrons per atom (neutral or ionized), which is
</p>
<p>here simply
</p>
<p>E D ne
n
</p>
<p>D x : (14.22)
</p>
<p>Remember that �mu; �0mu, and �emu are defined as the average particle masses
</p>
<p>per free particle, per nucleus, and per free electron, respectively. This means that the
</p>
<p>density can be written as
</p>
<p>% D .nC ne/�mu D n�0mu D ne�emu : (14.23)</p>

</p>
<p>(14.24) also holds for a mixture of gases.
</p>
<p>14.3 Thermodynamical Quantities for a Pure Hydrogen Gas
</p>
<p>Many thermodynamic properties depend on the degree of ionization. We here
</p>
<p>indicate roughly how the formulae can be derived for the relatively simple case
</p>
<p>of the pure hydrogen gas. This is not because of its importance, but rather because
</p>
<p>the treatment is quite analogous to that in the much more involved case of mixtures.
</p>
<p>The gas is supposed to be perfect, since partial ionization usually occurs only in the
</p>
<p>stellar envelope, where effects of degeneracy can be neglected.
</p>
<p>In Sect. 4.1 we defined the quantity ı D �.@ ln%=@ lnT /P . In the case of pure
hydrogen obeying the perfect-gas equation we have ı D 1 for x D 0 and x D 1,
since � is constant in both cases (Remember that we wished to incorporate in ˛ and
</p>
<p>ı the changes of � due to partial ionization, while ' should be reserved for changes
</p>
<p>of� due to changing chemical composition.). For partial ionization, x varies with T ,
</p>
<p>and therefore ı is given by a complicated expression. From the perfect-gas equation
</p>
<p>% � �P=T and (14.24) with �0 = constant we find
</p>
<p>ı D 1C 1
1C E
</p>

@E
</p>
<p>@ lnT
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>P
</p>
<p>; (14.25)
</p>
<p>which also holds for a mixture of gases. For pure hydrogen E D x and we need
the derivative of x, which can be obtained by differentiation of the Saha equation
</p>
<p>(14.21). This gives

<p>�
: (14.26)
</p>
<p>While the mean molecular weight as given by (14.24) depends only on the degree
</p>
<p>of ionization, ı depends also on T , and if in addition radiation pressure is taken
</p>
<p>into account, one has to add terms proportional to (1 � ˇ)/ˇ to the right-hand sides
of (14.25) and (14.26).

<p>As a next step in the general problem we consider a gas of hydrogen and helium

<p>with weight fractions X; Y respectively. This is important for stellar envelopes and
</p>
<p>shows the difficulties which arise if mixtures are treated. We now have six types of
</p>
<p>particles: neutral and ionized hydrogen; neutral, ionized, and double ionized helium;
</p>
<p>and electrons. There are three types of ionization energy: �0H for hydrogen and

<p>0
H D 13:598 eV, �0He D 24:587 eV,

internal energy, each helium atom in the first stage of ionization the energy �0He and

<p>each helium atom completely stripped of its two electrons the energy �0He C �1He.

</p>
<p>helium. But this is to be expected, since a hydrogen ion can also recombine with free
</p>
<p>electrons that originally came from helium, since it has no prejudices concerning the
</p>
<p>origin of a captured electron.
</p>
<p>The coupling of the three Saha equations (14.35) makes an analytical treatment

<p>impossible: the degrees of ionization have to be obtained numerically. In general,</p>

<p>numerically by evaluating the xri for neighbouring arguments, though one has to
</p>
<p>be careful if the radiation pressure is not negligible. The derivatives of the xri
are needed for constant total pressure P , whereas the argument for evaluating
</p>
<p>the degrees of ionization is the gas pressure. One therefore has to choose the
</p>
<p>neighbouring arguments Pgas and T such that P D Pgas C Prad = constant. The
general theory of ionization and, in particular, the influence on the thermody-

<p>14.6 Limitation of the Saha Formula 137
</p>
<p>14.6 Limitation of the Saha Formula
</p>
<p>In the derivation of the Saha formula we have assumed thermodynamic equilibrium.
</p>
<p>This is certainly fulfilled in the interior of stars, and the Saha formula is even a
</p>
<p>sufficient approximation for many atmospheres as long as one can assume so-called
</p>
<p>LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium),which is the case when collisions dominate
</p>
<p>over radiative processes. One cannot apply it for non-LTE, as, for example, in the
</p>
<p>solar corona.
</p>
<p>But even in the deep interior of a star, where local thermodynamic equilib-
</p>
<p>rium is certainly a very good approximation, the naRıve application of the Saha
formula gives wrong results. For instance let us apply it to the centre of the Sun
</p>
<p>(Pc � Pgas D 2:32 � 1017 dyn/cm2, Tc D 1:57 � 107K) and assume for simplicity
pure hydrogen (X D 1); then (14.21) gives for the degree of ionization xH D
0:80. This would mean that 20% of the hydrogen atoms are neutral. Indeed, for
</p>
<p>sufficiently high temperatures, the exponential in the Saha formula can be replaced
</p>
<p>by 1, and x1H decreases inwards with KH if r � d lnT=d lnPgas &lt; 2=5, as can be
seen from (14.21).
</p>
<p>The solution of this paradox has to do with the decrease of the ionization energy
</p>
<p>with increasing density. Let us consider ions at a distance d from each other:
</p>
<p>their electrostatic potentials have to be superimposed in order to obtain their total
</p>
<p>potential (Fig. 14.2). Obviously the higher quantum states of the ions are strongly
</p>
<p>disturbed, and the ionization energy is reduced for high density. This should be
</p>
<p>taken into account in the Saha formula, which would then give a higher degree of
</p>
<p>ionization. Furthermore, the neighbouring ions allow only a finite number of bound
</p>
<p>states. This has the consequence that in the partition function as given by (14.15)
</p>
<p>one has to sum over a finite number of excited states only.
</p>
<p>In order to estimate roughly at which density these effects become important, we
</p>
<p>consider a pure hydrogen gas. If the mean distance between two atoms is d , then
</p>
<p>there will be no bound states if the orbital radius a of the electron is comparable
</p>
<p>with, or larger than, d=2. With
</p>

</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>4�nH
</p>
<p>�1=3
; (14.43)
</p>
<p>where a0 D 5:3 � 10�9 cm is the Bohr radius, � the quantum, number and nH the
number density of the atoms, we obtain from the condition a &lt; d=2 (which must
</p>
<p>be fulfilled for a bound state) that

</p>
<p>This allows a rough estimate of the principal quantum number of the highest bound
</p>
<p>state. In the centre of the Sun, with %c � 150 g/cm3, we have nH � %c=mu �
1026 cm�3, and therefore �2 &lt; 0:13, which means that even the ground state of
hydrogen does not exist. Therefore all hydrogen atoms will be ionized.</p>

<p>more elaborate models are used to solve this problem. An example is the hydrogen&ndash;

</p>
<p>For simplified stellar-model calculations one may use the Saha formula for the

<p>The Degenerate Electron Gas
</p>
<p>15.1 Consequences of the Pauli Principle
</p>
<p>We consider a gas of sufficiently high density in the volume dV so that it is
</p>
<p>practically fully pressure ionized (Sect. 14.6). Here we shall deal with the free
</p>
<p>electrons, of number density ne. If the velocity distribution of the electrons is given
</p>
<p>by Boltzmann statistics, then their mean kinetic energy is 3kT=2. In momentum
</p>
<p>space px ; py; pz each electron of a given volume dV in local space is represented by
</p>
<p>a point, and these points form a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; which is spherically symmetric around the
</p>
<p>origin. If p is the absolute value of the momentum .p2 D p2x C p2y C p2z ), then the
number of electrons in the spherical shell Œp; pCdp&#141; is, according to the Boltzmann
distribution function,

</p>
<p>Consider a reduction of T with ne D constant. Then themaximumof the distribution
function, which is at pmax D .2mekT/1=2; tends to smaller values of p, and the
maximum of f .p/ becomes higher, since ne is given by

f .p/dp. This is
</p>
<p>indicated in Fig. 15.1 by the thin curves. But with this classical picture we can come
</p>
<p>into contradiction with quantum mechanics, since electrons are fermions, for which
</p>
<p>Pauli&rsquo;s exclusion principle holds: each quantum cell of the six-dimensional phase
</p>
<p>space (x; y; z; px ; py ; pz) cannot contain more than two electrons (here x; y; z are
</p>
<p>the space coordinates of the electrons with dV D dxdydz). The volume of such a
quantum cell is dpxdpydpzdV D h3, where h is Planck&rsquo;s constant. Therefore in the
shell [p; pCdp] of momentum space there are 4�p2dpdV=h3 quantum cells, which
can contain not more than 8�p2dpdV=h3 electrons. Quantum mechanics therefore

</p>
<p>in Figs. 15.2 and 15.5)
</p>
<p>as indicated by the heavy parabola in Fig. 15.1, giving an upper bound for f .p/.
</p>
<p>One can immediately see that the Boltzmann distribution for ne = constant is
</p>
<p>in contradiction with quantum mechanics for sufficiently low temperatures. The
</p>
<p>same holds for T D constant and sufficiently high density, since the Boltzmann
distribution is proportional to ne. We therefore have to include quantum-mechanical
</p>
<p>effects if the temperature of the gas is too low or if the electron density is too high,
</p>
<p>in order to avoid the distribution function exceeding its upper bound. One then says
</p>
<p>that the electrons become degenerate.
</p>
<p>We first consider an electron gas of temperature zero, i.e. all the electrons have
</p>
<p>the lowest energy possible.
</p>
<p>15.2 The Completely Degenerate Electron Gas
</p>
<p>The state in which all electrons have the lowest energy without violating Pauli&rsquo;s

</p>
<p>For the equation of state we need the pressure, which by definition is the flux

</p>
<p>d� having a normal vector n, as indicated in Fig. 15.3. An arbitrary unit vector s,
</p>
<p>together with n, defines an angle # .
</p>
<p>Let us determine the number of electrons per second that go through d�
</p>
<p>into a small solid angle d˝s around the direction s. We restrict ourselves to
</p>
<p>electrons for which the absolute value of their momentum lies between p and
</p>
<p>p C dp. At the location of the surface element there are f .p/dpd˝s=.4�/
electrons per unit volume that have the right momentum (i.e. the right value

<p>On the other hand if x � 1, then vF=c is very close to one: the bigger x, the more

</p>
<p>almost all electrons are relativistic.

<p>15.4 Partial Degeneracy of the Electron Gas
</p>
<p>For a finite temperature, not all electrons will be densely packed in momentum space
</p>
<p>in the cells of lowest possible momentum. Indeed, if the temperature is sufficiently
</p>
<p>high, we expect them to have a Boltzmann distribution. Further, there must be a
</p>
<p>smooth transition from the completely degenerate state (as discussed in Sects. 15.2
</p>
<p>and 15.3) to the non-degenerate case.
</p>
<p>The most probable occupation of the phase cells of the shell Œp; p C dp&#141;
in momentum space is determined by Fermi&ndash;Dirac statistics (see Landau,
</p>
<p>Lifshitz, vol. 5, 1980):

<p>1C eE=kT� (15.28)
</p>
<p>(where the so-called degeneracy parameter  will be discussed later). The first
</p>
<p>factor gives again the maximally allowed occupations for this shell; see (15.2).
</p>
<p>However, for p � pF, there are fewer electrons in the shell than in the case
of complete degeneracy: the second factor is smaller than one; it is a &ldquo;filling</p>

</p>
<p>trarily small, and from (15.32) we infer that for a given electron density this
</p>
<p>is the case for high temperatures. We know that then f .p/ must become the

<p>this limit  is a function of ne=T

<p>Again, (15.39) and (15.41) define an equation of state for the electron gas. If T

<p>where F2 and F3 are defined by (15.38). For strong degeneracy ( ! 1) the first
term of the expansion (15.43) is introduced into (15.45) and (15.46), and elimination

</p>
<p>No analytical approach is known for the case of partial degeneracy if the electron

<p>gas is only moderately relativistic, because the relation between E and p cannot be
</p>
<p>approximated by a simpler expression and in the integrals (15.29) and (15.30) the

<p>full relation (15.6) has to be taken; hence the problem has to be treated numerically.
</p>
<p>However, to do this efficiently, no general integration scheme should be used for
</p>
<p>the many integrations needed to calculate the equation of state at the many mesh
</p>
<p>points of a stellar model, but instead optimized methods adapted to the special form
</p>
<p>of the integrals should be used. The integrals can, for instance, be determined by
</p>
<p>using Laguerre polynomials as an approximation of the integrand (Kippenhahn and
</p>
<p>Thomas 1964). This method was extended to higher accuracy by Pichon (1989),
</p>
<p>who also discusses alternative schemes of numerical integration. A very efficient
</p>
<p>and convenient method was developed by Gong et al. (2001), who also provide
</p>
<p>a ready-to-use computer code, available from the publisher of that paper, which
</p>
<p>conveniently also computes the derivatives of the Fermi integrals, needed for the
</p>
<p>Henyey method of Chap. 12. This code was also used to compute the values of
</p>
<p>Table 15.1. Alternatively, Blinnikov et al. (1996) have extended the approach of

<p>The Equation of State of Stellar Matter
</p>
<p>In Chap. 15 we dealt with degeneracy of arbitrary degree for the electron gas. We
</p>
<p>now discuss the combined effect of all components of stellar matter, starting with
</p>
<p>the ion gas.
</p>
<p>16.1 The Ion Gas
</p>
<p>In the non-degenerate case, electron pressure Pe D nekT and ion pressure Pion D
nionkT are of the same order of magnitude; they are even equal in the case of
</p>
<p>ionized hydrogen with ne D nion. For sufficiently low temperature or sufficiently
high density the ions can become degenerate, too. If they are Fermi particles such
</p>
<p>as protons, they will behave in phase space like the electrons, so that, for Pion and
</p>
<p>nion, relations such as (15.29)&ndash;(15.31) hold if the mass of the ions mion is used
</p>
<p>instead of me, and  is now the degeneracy parameter for the ions. Again the
</p>
<p>transition between perfect-gas behaviour and degeneracy is roughly at  D 0. We
write (15.39) in the form
</p>
<p>nj
</p>
<p>T 3=2
D constant .mj /3=2F1=2. /; (16.1)
</p>
<p>where nj and mj refer to either electrons or ions. Suppose that the electron gas has
</p>
<p>a certain value of  D  � for ne D n�e . An ion gas of the same temperature has
the same degeneracy parameter  D  � for nion D .mion=me/3=2n�e � 8 � 104n�e .
Therefore the ions require much higher densities to become degenerate. For the
</p>
<p>interior of normal stars one can assume that even if the electrons are degenerate
</p>
<p>the ions still obey Boltzmann statistics; thus, because of the Pauli principle, the
</p>
<p>degenerate electrons have much higher momentum than the non-degenerate ions,
</p>
<p>and the electron pressure is much larger than the pressure of the ions: P D Pion C
Pe � Pe.

<p>152 16 The Equation of State of Stellar Matter
</p>
<p>Even when the ion gas does not contribute noticeably to the pressure, it provides
</p>
<p>the main contribution to the mass density %. This has already been taken into account
</p>
<p>by relating ne to % D ne�emu, for example in (15.39). Furthermore, the ions can
influence the thermodynamic properties of the plasma considerably.
</p>
<p>One should be aware that, for certain types of stars, the treatment of the ions
</p>
<p>is not as simple as described here, since they can be subject to rather complicated
</p>
<p>interactions, for example, those indicated in Sects. 16.4 and 16.5.

</p>
<p>We will derive rough borders between these different regimes.
</p>
<p>Let us first consider the lines  D constant for given �e in this diagram. In
the non-relativistic regime, (15.39) shows that  is constant for T � %2=3, i.e. on
straight lines of slope 2/3 in the lg%&ndash;lgT plane. In the relativistic regime  D
constant for T � %1=3 according to (15.45), i.e. on straight lines with slope 1/3.

</p>
<p>one can see, the interior regions of the Sun avoid the area in the diagram where
</p>
<p>radiation pressure is important, as well as that of degeneracy. However, we will
</p>
<p>have to deal with other cases in which the equation of state is more complicated.
</p>
<p>This concerns highly evolved stars, but also unevolved stars of very low mass (For

<p>a review see Van Horn 1986.).

<p>16.3 Thermodynamic Quantities
</p>
<p>With the implicit form (16.2) and (16.3) and with the expression (16.4) for the
</p>
<p>internal energy we are in principle able to determine ı; cP ; and rad. Since in
general no analytic methods are known one can try to determine the thermodynamic
</p>
<p>quantities numerically. Here we just give them for some limiting cases for which
</p>
<p>analytic expressions can be derived. For the sake of simplicity we neglect the effects
</p>
<p>of radiation and we suppose the ions to be a perfect gas.</p>

<p>16.3 Thermodynamic Quantities 155
</p>
<p>In the cases of complete degeneracy of a non-relativistic or an extremely
</p>
<p>relativistic electron gas, it is obvious from equations (15.23) and (15.26) that the
</p>
<p>quantities ˛; ı as defined in (4.2) and (4.3) are ˛ D 3=5; ı D 0, or ˛ D 3=4; ı D 0

<p>low temperatures, in which case the Coulomb interaction of the ions must be

<p>considered: instead of moving freely, the ions tend to form a rigid lattice, which
</p>
<p>minimizes their total energy. This occurs when the thermal energy 3kT=2 becomes
</p>
<p>comparable with the Coulomb energy per ion of charge�Ze. If we define a volume
Vion per ion by nionVion D 1 (where nion is the number density of ions) and a mean

of the ions is negligible and that they try to form a conglomerate that has a lower

<p>More detailed considerations (see, for instance, Shapiro and Teukolsky 1983)

</p>
<p>16.5 Neutronization
</p>
<p>If in a plasma the electrons have sufficient energy, they can combine with the protons
</p>
<p>to form neutrons. If mn and mp are the masses of neutron and proton, then the
</p>
<p>electron must have the total energy Etot &gt; E
� D c2.mn � mp/. At low densities
</p>
<p>the neutron will decay within 11min back into a proton&ndash;electron pair, where the
</p>
<p>electron has the total energy E� and a kinetic energy E�kin D E� �mcc2; however,
the situation can be different if the gas is completely degenerate and the phase space
</p>
<p>is filled up to the (kinetic) Fermi energy EF. If the Fermi energy EF exceeds E
�
kin,
</p>
<p>the electrons released do not have enough energy to find an empty cell in phase
</p>
<p>space, and the neutrons cannot decay, i.e. the Fermi sea of electrons has stabilized
</p>
<p>the neutrons.
</p>
<p>In order to estimate under which conditions this occurs we write the rela-
</p>
<p>tion (15.6) between E and p in the form
</p>
<p>p D 1
c
.E2 �m2ec4/1=2 : (16.27)
</p>
<p>If we put E D Ekin C mec2 D EF C mec2 D c2.mn � mp/ D 1:294 � 106 eV,
we can determine the corresponding Fermi momentum pF from (16.27) and obtain
</p>
<p>x D pF=.mec/ � 2:2. Then, according to (15.15) and taking % D �emune with
�e D 2, we find % � 2:4 � 107 g cm�3. Therefore, if a proton&ndash;electron gas is
compressed to a density above this value, then the gas undergoes a transition into a
</p>
<p>neutron gas (&ldquo;neutronization&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>For stellar matter the situation is more complicated, since at sufficiently high
</p>
<p>densities the plasma contains heavier nuclei, and not just protons. The nuclei
</p>
<p>capture electrons (inverse ˇ decay) and become neutron-rich isotopes. This requires
</p>
<p>much higher electron energies than those just estimated, since the neutrons in the
</p>
<p>nucleus are degenerate and the new ones have to be raised above the Fermi energy.
</p>
<p>Correspondingly higher plasma densities are required to provide the electrons with
</p>
<p>the necessary energy. If the nuclei become too neutron rich they start to break up,
</p>
<p>releasing free neutrons. The density at which this &ldquo;neutron drip&rdquo; starts is of the order
</p>
<p>of several 1011g cm�3, but the exact value depends on the nuclear model one is using
in detailed calculations. Hillebrandt (1991) gives %drip � 3 � 1011 g cm�3, Pethick
and Ravenhall (1991) estimate %drip � 3:5 � 1011 g cm�3.
</p>
<p>Let us briefly consider the effect on the equation of state. Up to %drip the total
</p>
<p>pressure P � Pe is provided by relativistic electrons. With further increases of %,
the number density ne increases by less than an amount proportional to %, owing
</p>
<p>to the capture of some electrons. Therefore the pressure rises by less than %4=3.
</p>
<p>Consequently &#13;ad � .d lnP=d ln%/ad is reduced below 4/3, which can be seen in
Fig. 16.2, where the slope of the curve P D P.%/ is suddenly reduced for log % &amp;
11.7. At still higher % the increasing number of free neutrons contribute gradually
</p>
<p>more to P .</p>

<p>With increasing % the neutrons become increasingly degenerate&ndash;as a perfect

<p>becomes important, and the details of the equation of state are very uncertain, for
</p>
<p>example, depending on rather badly known properties of the particles. For more
</p>
<p>details see Sects. 37.2 and 38.1 and Shapiro and Teukolsky (1983).
</p>
<p>16.6 Real Gas Effects
</p>
<p>Although the stellar plasma can to a great extent be treated as a perfect gas, the
</p>
<p>assumptions for a perfect gas are not truly fulfilled: there are interaction forces,
</p>
<p>such as the Coulomb force, acting between the constituents, and atoms and ions
</p>
<p>cannot always be considered to be pointlike. Therefore an accurate equation of state
</p>
<p>has to include such effects.
</p>
<p>We already encountered pressure ionization in Sect. 14.6, which is a consequence
</p>
<p>of the spatially overlapping energy levels, which leads to interacting ionic potentials.
</p>
<p>We noted that there is no good theory to treat this in a simple way, but that one has to
</p>
<p>modify the Saha equation somehow to avoid its wrong behaviour at high pressure.
</p>
<p>A good theory for pressure ionization has to work with quantum-mechanical
</p>
<p>atomic models. The effect of pressure ionization is increasingly important for cool,
</p>
<p>dense stars of low mass (M &lt; 1Mˇ) and gas planets. Saumon et al. (1995) have
developed an equation for state for dense gases, which, due to the complexity of the
</p>
<p>problem, is limited to hydrogen-heliummixtures. This and other modern equations
</p>
<p>of state are provided in tabular form, for example, as tables of P.�; T / and u.�; T /
</p>
<p>for various chemical mixtures. The thermodynamic quantities, which are or use</p>

<p>160 16 The Equation of State of Stellar Matter
</p>
<p>derivatives of P and u, are either computed from the tables, or are provided as
</p>
<p>tables, too.
</p>
<p>Another interaction becoming important at low temperatures, when molecules
</p>
<p>are able to form, are the classical van der Waals forces, which are attractive forces of
</p>
<p>electrically neutral, but polarized particles. Their consideration leads in the simplest
</p>
<p>approximation to the equation of state for a real gas
</p>
<p>.P C n2a/.1 � nb/ D nkT: (16.28)
</p>
<p>The meaning of the additional terms n2a and nb is easy to understand: nb is
</p>
<p>the effect of volume reduction due to the finite size of the particles, which leads
</p>
<p>therefore at given temperature to a pressure increase. The second term, n2a, is the
</p>
<p>effect of the attractive forces, which result in a reduction of the gas pressure P .
</p>
<p>a and b are parameters depending on the microscopic properties of the gas particles.
</p>
<p>An equation of state of this type results in phase transitions, which indeed were
</p>
<p>found in the equation of state of Saumon et al. (1995) (For a derivation of (16.28)
</p>
<p>see Weiss et al. 2004.).
</p>
<p>In Sect. 16.4, we discussed crystallization, which is due to the electrostatic
</p>
<p>interaction between ions at high densities, in the limit of �C � 1. At the other
extreme, when �C � 1, the gas is close to being a perfect one, but not quite so.
Consider an ionized gas, which consists of positively charged ions and unbound
</p>
<p>electrons. As long as these are not degenerate, they can move freely and will feel
</p>
<p>the Coulomb forces in the plasma. In particular, ions will attract electrons and it is
</p>
<p>plausible that clouds of electrons gather around ions such that from a sufficiently
</p>
<p>large distance the ion electron cloud will appear as being electrically neutral. This
</p>
<p>picture of electron shielding (in the weak limit) requires low particle densities,
</p>
<p>because the inter-ion distances must be larger than the typical electron cloud size.
</p>
<p>The physical effect is usually treated within the Debye&ndash;Hückel theory (Landau and
</p>
<p>Lifshitz 1980, Chap. 78; Weiss et al. 2004, Chap. 17.15), which we will encounter
</p>
<p>in detail in Sect. 18.4. Here it suffices to state that based on a shielded Coulomb

</p>
<p>Opacity
</p>
<p>In this chapter we deal with the material function �.%; T /. While for the equation
</p>
<p>of state it was possible to use certain approximations (for instance, that of a perfect
</p>
<p>gas) without introducing too much error, this is almost impossible for the opacity.
</p>
<p>Although there are similar approximations (such as those for electron scattering
</p>
<p>or free&ndash;free transitions) they never hold for the whole star and are used only in
</p>
<p>simplifying approaches. Therefore, nowadays, when solving the stellar-structure
</p>
<p>equations, one uses numerical opacity tables for different chemical mixtures, which
</p>
<p>give �.%; T / in the full range of % and T .
</p>
<p>In the followingwe describe the basic processes that contribute to the opacity and
</p>
<p>give approximate analytic formulae without deriving them from quantum mechan-
</p>
<p>ics. The reader who wants to learn more of the methods by which opacities are
</p>
<p>computed is referred to Weiss et al. (2004) and to the original papers quoted there.
</p>
<p>17.1 Electron Scattering
</p>
<p>If an electromagnetic wave passes an electron, the electric field makes the electron
</p>
<p>oscillate. The oscillating electron represents a classical dipole that radiates in other
</p>
<p>directions, i.e. the electron scatters part of the energy of the incoming waves.
</p>
<p>The weakening of the original radiation due to scattering is equivalent to that by
</p>
<p>absorption, and we can describe it by way of a cross section at frequency � per unit
</p>
<p>mass (which we called �� in Sect. 5.1). This can be calculated classically giving the
</p>
<p>result

</p>
<p>where re is the classical electron radius, X the mass fraction of hydrogen, and the
</p>
<p>constant is in cm2 g�1. The term �emu arises because �� is taken per unit mass; and
�e is replaced by (4.30). Since �� does not depend on the frequency,we immediately
</p>
<p>obtain the Rosseland mean for electron scattering:

</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Thomson scattering&rdquo; just described neglects the exchange of momentum
</p>
<p>between electron and radiation. If this becomes important, then �� will be reduced
</p>
<p>compared to the value given in (17.1), though this effect plays a role only at temper-
</p>
<p>atures sufficiently high for the scattered photons to be very energetic. In fact during
</p>
<p>the scattering process the electron must obtain such a large momentum that its
</p>
<p>velocity is comparable to c, say v &amp; 0:1c for (17.2) to become a bad approximation.
</p>
<p>The momentum of the photon is h�=c, which after scattering is partly transferred to
</p>
<p>the electron,mev � h�=c. Therefore relativistic corrections (&ldquo;Compton scattering&rdquo;)
become important if the average energy of the photons is h� &amp; 0:1mec
</p>
<p>2. For h� we
</p>
<p>take the frequency at which the Planck function has a maximum; then according to
</p>
<p>Wien&rsquo;s law this is at h�D 4:965 kT , and the full Compton scattering cross section
has to be taken into account if T &gt;0:1mec
</p>
<p>2/(4.965k), or roughly T &gt;108K. In fact
</p>
<p>even at T D 108K Compton scattering reduces the opacity by only 20% of that
given by (17.2).
</p>
<p>17.2 Absorption Due to Free&ndash;Free Transitions
</p>
<p>If during its thermal motion a free electron passes an ion, the two charged particles
</p>
<p>form a system which can absorb and emit radiation. This mechanism is only
</p>
<p>effective as long as electron and ion are sufficiently close. Now, the mean thermal
</p>
<p>velocity of the electrons is v � T 1=2, and the time during which they form a system
able to absorb or emit is proportional to 1=v � T �1=2; therefore, if in a mass element
the numbers of electrons and ions are fixed, the number of systems temporarily able
</p>
<p>to absorb is proportional to T �1=2.
The absorption properties of such a system have been derived classically by
</p>
<p>Kramers, who calculated that the absorption coefficient per system is proportional to
</p>
<p>Z2��3, whereZ is the charge number of the ion. We therefore expect the absorption
coefficient �� of a given mixture of (fully ionized) matter to be
</p>
<p>�� � Z2%T �1=2��3 : (17.3)
</p>
<p>Here the factor % appears because for a given mass element the probability that two
</p>
<p>particles are accidentally close together is proportional to the density.
</p>
<p>For the determination of the Rosseland mean � of this absorption coefficient
</p>
<p>we make use of a simple theorem which can be easily proved by carrying out the
</p>
<p>integration (5.19): a factor �˛ contained in �� gives a factor T
˛ in �. With this and
</p>
<p>with (17.3) we find
</p>
<p>�ff � %T �7=2 : (17.4)
</p>
<p>All opacities of the form (17.4) are called Kramers opacities and give only a
</p>
<p>classical approximation. One normally multiplies the Kramers formula (17.4) by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.3 Bound&ndash;Free Transitions 165
</p>
<p>a correction factor g, the so-called Gaunt factor, in order to take care of the
</p>
<p>quantum-mechanical correction (see, for instance, Weiss et al. 2004). In (17.4)
</p>
<p>we have still omitted the factor Z2 which appears in (17.3). In general, one has
</p>
<p>a mixture of different ions, and therefore one has to add the contributions of the
</p>
<p>different chemical species. The (weighted) sum over the values of Z2 is taken
</p>
<p>into the constant of proportionality in (17.4), which then depends on the chemical
</p>
<p>composition. For a fully ionized mixture a good approximation is given by
</p>
<p>�ff D 3:8 � 1022.1CX/Œ.X C Y /CB&#141;%T �7=2 ; (17.5)
</p>
<p>with the numerical constant in cgs. The mass fractions of H and He are X and
</p>
<p>Y , respectively. Here the factor 1 C X arises, since �ff must be proportional to
the electron density&ndash;which is proportional to .1 C X/%. The term .X C Y / in the
brackets can be understood in the following way: there areX=mu hydrogen ions and
</p>
<p>Y=.4mu/ helium ions. The former have the charge number 1, the latter the charge
</p>
<p>number 2. But since �� � Z2 [see (17.3)], when adding the contributions of H and
He to the total absorption coefficient, we obtain the factor X=mu C 4Y=.4mu/ D
.X C Y /mu. Correspondingly the term B gives the contribution of the heavier
elements:
</p>
<p>B D
X
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>XiZ
2
i
</p>
<p>Ai
; (17.6)
</p>
<p>where the summation extends over all elements higher than helium and Ai is the
</p>
<p>atomic mass number.
</p>
<p>17.3 Bound&ndash;Free Transitions
</p>
<p>We first consider a (neutral) hydrogen atom in its ground state, with an ionization
</p>
<p>energy of �0, i.e. a photon of energy h� &gt;�0 can ionize the atom. Energy
</p>
<p>conservation then demands that

</p>
<p>2 ; (17.7)
</p>
<p>where v is the velocity of the electron released (relative to the ion, which is assumed
</p>
<p>to be at rest before and after ionization).
</p>
<p>If we define an absorption coefficient a� per ion .a� D ��%=nion/, we expect
a� D 0 for � &lt; �0=h and a� &gt; 0 for � � �0=h. Classical considerations similar
to those which lead to the Kramers dependence (17.3) of �� for free&ndash;free transitions
</p>
<p>give a� � ��3 for � � �0=h. Quantum-mechanical corrections can again be taken
into account by a Gaunt factor (see, for instance, Weiss et al. 2004). The absorption
</p>
<p>coefficient of the hydrogen atom in its ground state has a frequency dependence
</p>
<p>as given in Fig. 17.1a. But if we have neutral hydrogen atoms in different stages
</p>
<p>of excitation, the situation is different: an atom in the first excited stage has an</p>

<p>�� is a sawtooth function, as indicated in Fig. 17.1b. In order to obtain �� for a certain

<p>coefficients a� , weighted with their relative abundances, are to be summed. To

<p>one has to sum the functions a� for all species in all stages of excitation and all

<p>source of opacity are bound&ndash;free transitions of neutral hydrogen atoms, in which

<p>a small contribution to the overall opacity; however, the absorption lines in stars are
</p>
<p>strongly broadened by collisions, and as one can see in Fig. 17.3, they can occupy
</p>
<p>considerable regions of the spectrum. Bound&ndash;bound absorption can become a major
</p>
<p>contribution to the (Rosseland mean) opacity if T &lt;106K. It can then increase
</p>
<p>the total opacity by a factor 2, while for higher temperatures (say T � 107K)
the contribution of bound&ndash;bound transitions to the total opacity is much smaller
</p>
<p>(10%). Calculation of the absorption coefficients due to bound-bound transitions
</p>
<p>obviously requires detailed knowledge about the energy levels of all atoms and ions,
</p>
<p>all mechanisms that lead to line broadening, and of all the transition probabilities.
</p>
<p>In addition, occupation levels and ionization levels have to be known, which links
</p>
<p>the calculation of opacities closely to that of the equation of state. Such calculations

<p>have again to be done in separate calculations by specialists in atomic physics.</p>

<p>17.5 The Negative Hydrogen Ion
</p>
<p>Hydrogen can become a source of opacity in another way, by forming negative
</p>
<p>ions: a neutral hydrogen atom is polarized by a nearby charge and can then attract
</p>
<p>and bind another electron. This is possible since there exists a bound state for a
</p>
<p>second electron in the field of a proton, though this second electron is only loosely
</p>
<p>bound&ndash;the absorption of photons with h� &gt; 0:75 eV is sufficient for its release.
</p>
<p>This energy is very small compared to the 13.6 eV ionization energy for neutral
</p>
<p>hydrogen and allows photons with � &lt; 1655 nm (infrared) to be absorbed, giving
</p>
<p>rise to a bound&ndash;free transition. The photon energy goes into the ionization energy
</p>
<p>and kinetic energy of the free electron in the same way as indicated in (17.7). The
</p>
<p>number of negative hydrogen ions in thermodynamic equilibrium is given by the
</p>
<p>Saha formula (14.17), where the ionization potential �r is the binding energy of

<p>the second electron. Replacing the partition functions by the statistical weights, we

</p>
<p>17.6 Conduction
</p>
<p>Electrons, like all particles, can transport heat by conduction. Their contribution to
</p>
<p>the total energy transport can normally be neglected compared to that of photons,
</p>
<p>since the conductivity is proportional to the mean free path `, and in normal (non-
</p>
<p>degenerate) stellar material `photon � `particle.
However, conduction by electrons becomes important in the dense degenerate
</p>
<p>regions in the very interior of evolved stars, as well as in white dwarfs. The reason
</p>
<p>is that in the case of degeneracy, all quantum cells in phase space below pF are
</p>
<p>filled up, and electrons, when approaching ions and other electrons, have difficulty
</p>
<p>exchanging their momentum. This is equivalent to saying that &ldquo;encounters&rdquo; are rare
</p>
<p>or that the mean free path is large. In Sect. 5.2 we saw that the contribution to
</p>
<p>conduction can be formally taken into account in the equation of radiative transport
</p>
<p>by defining a &ldquo;conductive opacity&rdquo; �cd, as in (5.24). If �rad is the Rosseland mean of
</p>
<p>the (radiative) opacity, then conduction reduces the &ldquo;total&rdquo; opacity �, as can be seen

<p>The thermal conductivity of the electron component of a gas is mainly determined

<p>be important. Analytic formulae can be found in Weiss et al. (2004), while tables of

<p>17.7 Molecular Opacities
</p>
<p>For temperatures below� 10; 000K the formation of molecules in the envelopes of
cool stars becomes increasingly important. Due to their rich system of energy levels,
</p>
<p>corresponding to the various states of rotational and vibrational excitation, they are
</p>
<p>important absorbers. They contribute significantly to the opacity below � 5; 000K
and begin to dominate it for T . 3; 000K. The importance of any absorber for the
</p>
<p>Rosseland mean opacity depends primarily on its absorption properties and not so
</p>
<p>much on its abundance. This is even more true for molecules and is the reason why
</p>
<p>Ti, which is three orders of magnitudes less abundant than oxygen, dominates&ndash;along
</p>
<p>with the water molecule&ndash;the opacity in the form of TiO as long as there is enough
</p>
<p>oxygen available for its formation. This is normally the case, unless there is more
</p>
<p>carbon than oxygen, in which case the oxygen is bound in CO molecules. In that
</p>
<p>case, other carbon molecules, such as C2, CN, or C2H2, dominate.
</p>
<p>Obviously, molecular opacities depend on atomic abundances, on the formation
</p>
<p>and stability of the various molecules, and finally on their energy level spectrum.
</p>
<p>This problem is sufficiently complicated that it can again be treated only in
</p>
<p>separate calculations including atomic and molecular physics, thermodynamics,
</p>
<p>and chemical processes. The results are again made available in tabular form
</p>
<p>for the stellar modelling. The largest sets of such tables has been provided by
</p>
<p>Alexander and Ferguson (Alexander and Ferguson 1994; Ferguson et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>The calculations consider more than 30 elements, over 50 molecules, and some 800
</p>
<p>million atomic and molecular lines. In addition, absorption by dust grains is also</p>

using data for atomic, molecular, and dust opacity from Ferguson et al. (2005)

</p>
<p>stellar atmospheres only.
</p>
<p>Figure 17.5 shows the total Rosseland opacity for a mixture with 70% hydrogen
</p>
<p>and 1% of metals. The varying density of the grid lines reflects the density of the
</p>
<p>.R; T / points computed for the table [In this and the following, similar figures,
</p>
<p>the quantity R D %=T 36 (with T6 D T=106K) has been used as this has become
customary in the opacity community. This quantity is roughly constant in large parts
</p>
<p>of main-sequence stars. This R must not be confused with the stellar radius and is
</p>
<p>used with this meaning in this chapter only.]. In regions of many different opacity
</p>
<p>sources the opacities were calculated at many temperatures and densities. At higher
</p>
<p>temperatures, atomic absorption dominates; the steep rise to the right is mainly
</p>
<p>caused by the H� ion. The &ldquo;shoulder&rdquo; around lgT D 3:4 and lowR is caused by the
first formation of molecules, such as CO, NO, and H2. The first sharp rise at lower
</p>
<p>temperatures after we passed the minimum around lgT D 3:3 is due to formation
of TiO and H2O, which is followed by a slight decrease in � once temperatures are
</p>
<p>too low to allow many excited states in the molecules. The various maxima at even
</p>
<p>lower temperatures are caused by different grains appearing and disappearing. For
</p>
<p>example, the one around lg T D 3:1 is due to Al2O3 and CaTiO3. Solid silicates and
iron grains form at even lower temperatures. Each of these features is also present
</p>
<p>at higher densities, but then already occurring at higher temperatures.
</p>
<p>Such low temperatures, where molecular or even dust absorption dominates, are
</p>
<p>usually found in stars only in convective envelopes. However, the outermost parts
</p>
<p>of these envelopes are highly superadiabatic (Chap. 7), such that r . rrad, and
therefore the opacities determine the temperature stratification even in this case.</p>

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Rogers and Iglesias 1992; Iglesias and Rogers 1996).

<p>The dominant absorption mechanisms at different parts of the model are discussed in the text. The

<p>continuation towards higher temperatures is shown in Fig. 17.7
</p>
<p>17.8 Opacity Tables
</p>
<p>In view of the complexity of modern opacity calculations, the basic considera-
</p>
<p>tions of Sects. 17.1&ndash;17.6 are not sufficient for calculating accurate stellar models.
</p>
<p>Instead, specialized groups have published extensive tables of opacities for different
</p>
<p>chemical mixtures over a wide range of temperatures and densities. Each group,
</p>
<p>however,may specialize on one specific aspect. TheOpacity Project (Mendoza et al.
</p>
<p>2007) and the Livermore OPAL group concentrate on atomic absorption important
</p>
<p>for higher temperatures (Fig. 17.6); the Wichita group (Alexander and Ferguson)
</p>
<p>on molecular and dust absorption for temperatures below 104K, and finally Itoh,
</p>
<p>Pothekin, and others on electron conduction. These various sources then have to be
</p>
<p>combined to opacity tables covering the whole stellar structure. Indeed, the low-and
</p>
<p>high-temperature opacities, which are shown in Figs. 17.5 and 17.6, agree very well
</p>
<p>in the overlapping temperature range. The conductive opacities can finally be added
</p>
<p>by use of (17.13).
</p>
<p>In Fig. 17.7 we give a graphical representation of such a combined opacity
</p>
<p>table for a mixture with a metal fraction of 0.01 and a hydrogen content of 0.70.
</p>
<p>Figures 17.6 and 17.5 show the corresponding individual parts for the same mixture.
</p>
<p>Indeed one sees that, over the whole range of arguments, �.R; T / is a rather
</p>
<p>complicated function. In order to give a feeling for the parts of the plotted surface
</p>
<p>that are relevant to stars, we discuss a model of the present Sun, which is plotted
</p>
<p>in Fig. 17.7 (thick solid line). We are using only the T � % structure; the chemical</p>

<p>opacities as in Fig. 17.4. The latter is a steeply declining function of % (orR) and can be seen &ldquo;from
</p>
<p>below&rdquo; in the back of the figure. Electron scattering provides the flat region in the right foreground.
</p>
<p>The thick solid line represents the T � % structure of a solar model (for details see text)
</p>
<p>composition of the Sun is in fact quite different from that of the table. For example,
</p>
<p>in the solar centre, X � 0:34, and at the surface, the composition is X D 0:737,
Y D 0:245, and Z D 0:018. Nevertheless, the main features are still visible. Note
also, that R indeed is rather constant throughout the solar interior, although % varies
</p>
<p>by eight orders of magnitude.
</p>
<p>The model starts with the photospheric values lg T D 3:76, lg % D �6:58 (in
cgs), or lgR D 0:14. The corresponding point lies on the left end of the thick solid
line in Fig. 17.7 and on the rising slope on the right of Fig. 17.5, where molecular
</p>
<p>opacities are still contributing. On moving deeper into the Sun the opacity sharply
</p>
<p>increases owing to the onset of hydrogen ionization, which provides the electrons
</p>
<p>for H� formation as described in Sect. 17.5, and the opacity rises by several powers
of 10 until it reaches a maximum value. This occurs when an appreciable amount of
</p>
<p>hydrogen becomes ionized and is not available for H� formation, because the factor
1 � x in (17.11) reduces the opacity. In the regions below, bound&ndash;free transitions
become the leading opacity source and still further inwards free&ndash;free transitions
</p>
<p>take over. There a simple power law seems to be a good approximation, as indicated
</p>
<p>in (17.4). Note that in the logarithmic representation the opacity surface for a power
</p>
<p>law is just a plane. Equation (17.4) therefore corresponds to a tangential plane which
</p>
<p>osculates the opacity surface. The line for the interior remains in the domain of free&ndash;
</p>
<p>free transitions. The region of dominant electron scattering is the horizontal plateau</p>

</p>
<p>In order to find the value of �.%; T;Xi/ for a given point with %0; T0; Xi0 in a star,

<p>one has to interpolate in different opacity tables (for different compositions Xi ) for

</p>
<p>only for different .X; Y; Z/ combinations, but also for different relative metal ratios
</p>
<p>within the Z-group. When combining opacities from different sources, as is almost
</p>
<p>always necessary, tables for identical metal mixtures are preferable, and great care
</p>
<p>in the interpolation has to be taken.
</p>
<p>Note finally, that the temperature and density range even of the combined opacity
</p>
<p>table is limited. In particular the high density limit is critical as low-mass stars have
</p>
<p>structures that reach high densities at rather low temperatures. The reason for the
</p>
<p>lack of available opacity data lies in the equation of state: this is the region where
</p>
<p>complicated non-ideal gas effects (Sect. 16.6) prevent an accurate calculation of the
</p>
<p>thermodynamic state of the gas, and therefore the calculation of opacities becomes
</p>
<p>impossible. In practical stellar evolution calculations, such a situation asks for the
</p>
<p>creativity of the modeller to somehow supplement the missing data.</p>

<p>Nuclear Energy Production
</p>
<p>We shall limit ourselves here to a very rough summary of the most important
</p>
<p>features of nuclear reactions in stars. This will suffice completely for the consid-
</p>
<p>eration of the main band of stellar structures, while the study of particular aspects
</p>
<p>of nuclear astrophysics anyway requires the consultation of specialized literature
</p>
<p>(see Clayton 1968, or Iliadis 2007). For example, we will only deal with energy
</p>
<p>production of equilibrium nuclear burning, i.e. we will neglect the effects occurring
</p>
<p>when the timescale of a rapidly changing star becomes comparable to that of an
</p>
<p>important nuclear reaction. On the other hand, we will also briefly touch on such
</p>
<p>topics as electron screening or neutrino production, about which a certain minimum
</p>
<p>of information seems to be indispensible for general discussions.
</p>
<p>We begin with a few historical comments. That thermonuclear reactions can
</p>
<p>provide the energy source for the stars was first shown by R. Atkinson and
</p>
<p>F. Houtermans in 1929, after G. Gamow discovered the tunnel effect. Later, two
</p>
<p>important discoveries were published almost simultaneously in 1938: H. Bethe
</p>
<p>and Ch. Critchfield described the pp chain, and C.F. von Weizsäcker and Bethe
</p>
<p>independently found the CNO cycle. The reactions of helium burning were then
</p>
<p>described in 1952 by E.E. Salpeter. Finally, a classic paper summarized the state of
</p>
<p>the art in 1957, &ldquo;Synthesis of the Elements in Stars&rdquo; (Burbidge et al. 1957).
</p>
<p>18.1 Basic Considerations
</p>
<p>Most observed stars (including the Sun) live on so-called thermonuclear fusion. In
</p>
<p>such nuclear reactions, induced by the thermal motion, several lighter nuclei fuse
</p>
<p>to form a heavier one. Before this process, the involved nuclei j have a total mass
</p>
<p>(
P
Mj ) different from that of the product nucleus .My/. The difference is called
</p>
<p>the mass defect:

</p>
<p>It is converted into energy according to Einstein&rsquo;s formula
</p>
<p>E D �Mc2 (18.2)
</p>
<p>and is available (at least partly) for the star&rsquo;s energy balance. An example is the
</p>
<p>series of reactions called &ldquo;hydrogen burning&rdquo;, where four hydrogen nuclei 1H with
</p>
<p>a total mass 4 � 1:0079mu (atomic mass units, physical scale) are transformed into
one 4He nucleus of 4.0026mu. Atomic masses are given for the neutral atoms, i.e. for
</p>
<p>the nucleus plus all electrons. However, since the electron mass is only 1=1823mu,
</p>
<p>we will assume that masses of nuclei are the same as the atomic masses. Obviously
</p>
<p>2:9�10�2mu per produced 4He nucleus have &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; during the fusion of the
four protons, which is roughly 0.7% of the original masses and which corresponds
</p>
<p>to an energy of about 27.0MeV according to (18.2). As usual in nuclear physics, as
</p>
<p>the unit of energy, we take the electron volt eV (1 eV D 1:6018 � 10�12 erg) with
the following equivalences:
</p>
<p>1 keV bD 1:1606 � 107K ;
931:49MeV bD 1mu : (18.3)
</p>
<p>The Sun&rsquo;s luminosity corresponds to a mass loss rate ofLˇ=c2 D 4:26�1012 g s�1,
which appears to be a lot, especially if it is read as &ldquo;more than four million metric
</p>
<p>tons per second&rdquo;. If a total of 1 Mˇ of hydrogen were converted into 4He, then
the disappearing 0.7% of this mass would be 1:4 � 1031 g, which could balance the
Sun&rsquo;s present mass loss by radiation for about 3 � 1018 s� 1011 years.
</p>
<p>The deficiency of mass is just another aspect of the fact that the involved nuclei
</p>
<p>have different binding energies EB. This is the energy required to separate the
</p>
<p>nucleons (protons and neutrons in the nucleus) against their mutual attraction by
</p>
<p>the strong, but short-range nuclear forces. Or else, EB is the energy gained if they
</p>
<p>are brought together from infinity (which starts here at any distance large compared
</p>
<p>with, say, 10�12 cm, the scale of a nuclear size).
Consider a nucleus of massMnuc and atomic mass numberA (the integer &ldquo;atomic
</p>
<p>weight&rdquo;): it may contain Z protons of mass mp and .A �Z/ neutrons of mass mn.
Its binding energy is then related to these masses by (18.2):
</p>
<p>EB D Œ.A �Z/mn CZmp �Mnuc&#141;c2 : (18.4)

<p>f D EB

</p>
<p>which is also called the binding fraction. With the exception of hydrogen, typical
</p>
<p>values are around 8MeV, with relatively small differences for nuclei of very
</p>
<p>different A. This shows that the short-range nuclear forces due to a nucleon mainly
</p>
<p>affect the nucleons in its immediate neighbourhood only, such that with increasing</p>

<p>smoothed over the wiggles
</p>
<p>which are due to the nuclear
</p>
<p>shell structure and pair effects
</p>
<p>A, a saturation occurs rather than an increase of f proportional to A. An idealized
</p>
<p>plot of f against A is shown in Fig. 18.1 (The real curve zigzags around this
</p>
<p>smoothed curve as a consequence of the shell structure of the nucleus and pair
</p>
<p>effects.).
</p>
<p>With increasing A; f .A/ rises steeply from hydrogen, then flattens out and
</p>
<p>reaches a maximum of 8.5MeV at AD 56 .56Fe), after which it drops slowly
with increasing A. The increase for A&lt;56 is a surface effect: particles at the
</p>
<p>surface of the nucleus experience less attraction by nuclear forces than those in
</p>
<p>the interior, which are completely surrounded by other particles. And in a densely
</p>
<p>packed nucleus, the surface area increases with radius slower than the volume (i.e.
</p>
<p>the number A) such that the fraction of surface particles drops. With increasing A,
</p>
<p>the number Z of protons also increases (The addition of neutrons only would
</p>
<p>require higher energy states, because the Pauli principle excludes more than two
</p>
<p>identical neutrons, and the nuclei would be unstable.). The positively charged
</p>
<p>protons experience a repulsive force which is far-reaching and therefore does not
</p>
<p>show the saturation of the nuclear forces. This increasing repulsion by the Coulomb
</p>
<p>forces brings the curve in Fig. 18.1 down again for A &gt; 56.
</p>
<p>Around the maximum, at 56Fe, we have the most tightly bound nuclei. In other
</p>
<p>words, the nucleus of 56Fe has the smallest mass per nucleon, so that any nuclear
</p>
<p>reaction bringing the nucleus closer to this maximum will be exothermic, i.e. will
</p>
<p>release energy. There are two ways of doing this:
</p>
<p>1. By fission of heavy nuclei, which happens, for example, in radioactivity.
</p>
<p>2. By fusion of light nuclei, which is the prime energy source of stars (and
</p>
<p>possibly ours too in the future).
</p>
<p>Clearly, both reach an end when one tries to extend them over the maximumof f ,
</p>
<p>which is therefore a natural finishing point for the stellar nuclear engine. So if a star
</p>
<p>initially consisted of pure hydrogen, it could gain a maximum of about 8.5MeV per</p>

<p>nucleon by fusion to 56Fe, but 6.7MeV of these are already used up when 4He is
</p>
<p>built up in the first step.
</p>
<p>In order to obtain a fusion of charged particles, they have to be brought so close to
</p>
<p>each other that the strong, but very short-ranged, nuclear forces dominate over the
</p>
<p>weaker, but far-reaching, Coulomb forces. The counteraction of these two forces
</p>
<p>leads to a sharp potential jump at the interaction radius (Fig. 18.2):
</p>
<p>r0 � A1=31:44 � 10�13cm (18.6)
</p>
<p>(the &ldquo;nuclear radius&rdquo; of the order of femtometer, 1fm D 10�13cm). For distances
less than r0, the nuclear attraction dominates and provides a potential drop of
</p>
<p>roughly 30MeV, while &ldquo;outside&rdquo; r0, the repulsive Coulomb forces for particles with
</p>
<p>chargesZ1 and Z2 yield

</p>
<p>The height of the Coulomb barrier ECoul .r0/ is typically of the order
</p>
<p>ECoul.r0/ � Z1Z2MeV : (18.8)
</p>
<p>If, in the stationary reference frame of the nucleus, a particle at &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; has kinetic
</p>
<p>energy E1, it can come classically only to a distance r1 given by E1 D ECoul.r1/
from (18.7), as indicated in Fig. 18.2. Now, the kinetic energy available to particles
</p>
<p>in stellar interiors is that of their thermal motion, and hence the reactions triggered
</p>
<p>by this motion are called thermonuclear. Since in normal stars we observe a slow
</p>
<p>energy release rather than a nuclear explosion, we must certainly expect the average
</p>
<p>kinetic energy of the thermal motion,Eth, to be considerably smaller thanECoul.r0/.
</p>
<p>For the value T � 107K estimated for the solar centre in Sect. 2.3, according to
(18.3), kT is only 103 eV, i.e. Eth is smaller than the Coulomb barrier (18.8) by
</p>
<p>a factor of roughly 103. This is in fact so low that, with classical effects only, we</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.2 Nuclear Cross Sections 179
</p>
<p>can scarcely expect any reaction at all. In the high-energy tail of the Maxwell&ndash;
</p>
<p>Boltzmann distribution, the exponential factor drops here to exp .�1000/ � 10�434,
which leaves no chance for the &ldquo;mere&rdquo; 1057 nucleons in the whole Sun (and even
</p>
<p>for the � 1080 nucleons in the whole visible universe)!
The only possibility for thermonuclear reactions in stars comes from a quantum-
</p>
<p>mechanical effect found by G. Gamow: there is a small but finite probability of
</p>
<p>penetrating (&ldquo;tunnelling&rdquo;) through the Coulomb barrier, even for particles withE &lt;
</p>
<p>ECoul.r0/. This tunnelling probability varies as
</p>
<p>P0 D p0E�1=2e�2�� I � D
�m
2
</p>
<p>�1=2 Z1Z2e2
&bdquo;E1=2 : (18.9)
</p>
<p>Here &bdquo; is h=2� and m the reduced mass. The factor p0 depends only on the
properties of the two colliding nuclei. The exponent 2�� is here obtained as the
</p>
<p>only E-dependent term in an approximate evaluation of the integral over &bdquo;�1Œ2m
.ECoul � E/&#141;1=2, which is extended from r0 to the distance rc of closest approach
(where E D ECoul). For Z1Z2 D 1 and T D 107K, P0 is of the order of 10�20 for
particles with average kinetic energyE and steeply increases with E and decreases
</p>
<p>with Z1Z2. Therefore, for temperatures as &ldquo;low&rdquo; as 10
7K, only the lightest nuclei
</p>
<p>(with smallest Z1Z2) have a chance to react. For reactions of heavier particles,
</p>
<p>with larger Z1Z2, the energy, i.e. the temperature, has to be correspondingly larger
</p>
<p>to provide a comparable penetration probability. This will result in well-separated
</p>
<p>phases of different nuclear &ldquo;burning&rdquo; during the star&rsquo;s evolution.
</p>
<p>18.2 Nuclear Cross Sections
</p>
<p>Consider a reaction of the nucleusX with the particle a by which the nucleus Y and
</p>
<p>the particle b are formed:
</p>
<p>aCX ! Y C b ; (18.10)
</p>
<p>represented by the notation X(a, b)Y. The reaction probability depends on nuclear
</p>
<p>details, some of which can be illustrated with the following simplified description.
</p>
<p>After penetration of the Coulomb barrier, an excited compound nucleus C � may
form containing both original particles (The level of excitation is dependent on the
</p>
<p>kinetic energy and binding energy brought along by the newly added particle.). C �
</p>
<p>may decay after a short time, which will still be long enough for the added nucleons
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;forget&rdquo;&ndash;owing to interactions within the compound nucleus&ndash;their history, a
</p>
<p>process for which only � 10�21 s is necessary. The decay then depends only on
the energy. C � can generally decay via one of several &ldquo;channels&rdquo; of different
probability: C � ! X C a;! Y1 C b1;! Y2 C b2; : : : ;! C C &#13; . The first of
these would be the reproduction of the original particles, while the last indicates a
</p>
<p>decay with &#13; -ray emission; the others are particle decays where the b1; b2; : : : may
</p>
<p>be, for example, neutrons, protons, and ˛ particles. Compared to these, a decay</p>

<p>Fig. 18.3 Schematic sketch of energy levels in a compound nucleus C� formed by particles X
</p>
<p>and a. The zero of E is here taken as corresponding to zero velocity of X and a at infinity. For
</p>
<p>initial particle energy E1, the reaction would be non-resonant, while for E2, the particles X and
</p>
<p>a find a resonance in the compound nucleus. Emin is the minimum excitation energy above the
</p>
<p>ground level for particle emission
</p>
<p>with electron emission has negligible probability (ˇ decay times being of order
</p>
<p>1 s or larger). Outgoing particles will obtain a certain amount of kinetic energy,
</p>
<p>which (just as the energy of emitted &#13; rays) will be shared with the surroundings,
</p>
<p>though an exception here are the neutrinos, which leave the star without interaction
</p>
<p>(Sect. 18.7). The possibility that a given energy level of C � can decay via a certain
channel requires fulfilment of the conservation laws (energy, momentum, angular
</p>
<p>momentum, nuclear symmetries).
</p>
<p>It is very important to know the energy levels of the compound nucleus C �,
which can be of different types. LetEmin be the minimum energy required to remove
</p>
<p>a nucleon from the ground state to infinity with zero velocity (to the level E D 0
in Fig. 18.3). This corresponds to the atom ionization energy discussed in Chap. 14.
</p>
<p>Levels below Emin can obviously only decay by electromagnetic transitions with
</p>
<p>the emission of &#13; rays, which are relatively improbable, and hence their lifetime �
</p>
<p>is large; these are &ldquo;stationary&rdquo; levels of small energy width � , since
</p>
<p>� D &bdquo;

; (18.11)
</p>
<p>as follows from the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. These levels correspond to the
</p>
<p>discrete, bound atomic states.
</p>
<p>The compound nucleus will not, however, immediately expel a particle if its
</p>
<p>energy is somewhat above Emin, since the sharp potential rise holds it back, at
</p>
<p>least for some time. Eventually it can leave the potential well by the tunnelling
</p>
<p>effect (which was, in fact, predicted by Gamow for explaining such outward escapes
</p>
<p>of particles from radioactive nuclei). So there can be &ldquo;quasi-stationary&rdquo; levels
</p>
<p>above Emin that have an appreciably shorter lifetime � (and are correspondingly
</p>
<p>wider) than those below Emin, since they can also decay via the much more
</p>
<p>probable particle emission. This probability will clearly increase strongly with
</p>
<p>increasing energy, which results in corresponding decreases of � and increases</p>

<p>18.2 Nuclear Cross Sections 181

</p>
<p>motion of the reacting
</p>
<p>particles, with resonances at
</p>
<p>E1 and E2
</p>
<p>of � , see (18.11). Above a certain energy Emax the width � will become larger
</p>
<p>than the distance between neighbouring levels, and their complete overlap yields a
</p>
<p>continuum of energy states, instead of separated, discrete levels.
</p>
<p>The possible existence of quasi-stationary levels above Emin requires particular
</p>
<p>attention. Consider an attempt to produce the compound nucleus C � by particles
XCa with gradually increasing energyE of their relative motion at large distances.
The reaction probability will simply increase with the penetration probability (18.9),
</p>
<p>if E is in a region either without quasi-stationary levels or between two of them. If,
</p>
<p>however, E coincides with such a level, the colliding particles find a &ldquo;resonance&rdquo;
</p>
<p>and can form the compound nucleus much more easily. At such resonance energies
</p>
<p>Eres, the probability for a reaction (and hence the cross section �) is abnormally
</p>
<p>enhanced, as sketched in Fig. 18.4, with resonant peaks rising to several powers of
</p>
<p>ten above &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. The energy dependence of the cross section therefore has a
</p>
<p>factor which has the typical resonance form:
</p>
<p>�.E/ D constant 1
.E � Eres/2 C .� =2/2
</p>
<p>: (18.12)
</p>
<p>At a resonance, the cross section � for the reaction of particles X and a can nearly
</p>
<p>reach its maximum value (geometrical cross section), given by quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>as ��-2, where �- is the de Broglie wavelength associated with a particle of relative
</p>
<p>momentum p:
</p>
<p>�- D &bdquo;
p
</p>
<p>D &bdquo;
.2mE/1=2
</p>
<p>: (18.13)
</p>
<p>Here the non-relativistic relation between p and E is used, and m is the reduced
</p>
<p>mass of the two particles. Themeaning of ��-2 is clear because according to quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics, the particles moving with momentum p &ldquo;see&rdquo; each other not as a precise
</p>
<p>point but smeared out over a length �-. The dependence of � on E can now be seen
</p>
<p>from the relation
</p>
<p>�.E/ � ��-2P0.E/�.E/ ; (18.14)
</p>
<p>where �- is given by (18.13). For E values well below the Coulomb barrier,
</p>
<p>P0 can be taken from (18.9) with a pre-factor p0DE1=2Coul.r0/ expŒ32mZ1Z2e2r0=
&bdquo;2/1=2&#141;. In the range of a single resonance, �.E/ is given by (18.12), while far</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>182 18 Nuclear Energy Production
</p>
<p>away from any resonances, �! 1. In any case, with or without resonances, �
is proportional to �-2P0, which depends on E as shown by (18.9) and (18.13).
</p>
<p>Therefore one usually writes
</p>
<p>�.E/ D SE�1e�2�� ; (18.15)
</p>
<p>where all remaining effects are contained within the here-defined &ldquo;astrophysical
</p>
<p>factor&rdquo; S. This factor contains all intrinsic nuclear properties of the reaction under
</p>
<p>consideration and can, in principle, be calculated, although one rather relies on
</p>
<p>measurements.
</p>
<p>The difficulty with laboratory measurements of S.E/&ndash;if they are possible at all&ndash;
</p>
<p>is that, because of the small cross sections, they are usually feasible only at rather
</p>
<p>high energies, say above 0.1 MeV, but this is still roughly a factor 10 larger than
</p>
<p>those energies which are relevant for astrophysical applications. Therefore one has
</p>
<p>to extrapolate the measured S.E/ downwards over a rather long range of E . This
</p>
<p>can be done quite reliably for non-resonant reactions, in which case S is nearly
</p>
<p>constant or a very slowly varying function of E [an advantage of extrapolating
</p>
<p>S.E/ rather than �.E/&#141;. The real problems arise from (suspected or unsuspected)
</p>
<p>resonances in the range over which the extrapolation is to be extended. Then
</p>
<p>the results can be quite uncertain. Only in underground laboratories, where the
</p>
<p>experiments are shielded from cosmic rays by hundreds of meters of solid rock,
</p>
<p>it is sometimes possible to measure the nuclear cross sections of at least a few
</p>
<p>nuclear reactions at energies as low as 10&ndash;30keV, i.e. at energies relevant for nuclear
</p>
<p>processes in stellar interiors. The first such measurement was done by Junker et al.
</p>
<p>(1998) in the Gran Sasso Laboratory and concerned the 3He.3He; 2p/4He reaction
</p>
<p>(18.62) of the hydrogen burning chains (Sect. 18.5.1). Such experiments sometimes
</p>
<p>lead to the discovery of resonances, but more importantly reduce the uncertainties
</p>
<p>of the cross sections considerably, and confirm the near constancy of S.E/ at the
</p>
<p>relevant energies.
</p>
<p>18.3 Thermonuclear Reaction Rates
</p>
<p>Let us denote the types of reacting particles, X and a, by indices j and k
</p>
<p>respectively. Suppose there is one particle of type j movingwith a velocity v relative
</p>
<p>to all particles of type k. Its cross section � for reactions with the k sweeps over a
</p>
<p>volume �v per second. The number of reactions per second will then be nk�v if
</p>
<p>there are nk particles of type k per unit volume. For nj particles per unit volume the
</p>
<p>total number of reactions per units of volume and time is
</p>
<p>Qrjk D njnk�v : (18.16)
</p>
<p>This product may also be interpreted by saying that njnk is the number of pairs
</p>
<p>of possible reaction partners, and �v gives the reaction probability per pair and</p>

</p>
<p>second. This indicates what we have to do in the case of reactions between identical
</p>
<p>particles .j D k/. Then the number of pairs that are possible reaction partners is
nj .nj � 1/=2 � n2j =2 for large particle numbers. This has to replace the product
njnk in (18.16) so that we can generally write

</p>
<p>Now we have to allow for the fact that particles j and k do not move relatively
</p>
<p>to each other with uniform velocities, which is important since � depends strongly
</p>
<p>on v. Excluding extreme densities (as, e.g. in neutron stars) we can assume that
</p>
<p>both types have a Maxwell&ndash;Boltzmann distribution of their velocities. It is then
</p>
<p>well known that also their relative velocity v is Maxwellian. If the corresponding

<p>below the &amp;100 keV available to most laboratory experiments. With increasing T;
</p>
<p>E0 increasesmoderately, while the maximumheight of the peakH0 D e�� increases
very steeply owing to the decreasing � .
</p>
<p>The width of the effective energy range is described by �E, which is the full
</p>
<p>width of the Gamow peak at half maximum (see Fig. 18.5), i.e. between the points
</p>
<p>with height 0.5 e�� . Equating this to the integrand in the first form of (18.30), we

<p>According to (18.34), this is always below unity, and therefore one has a well-

<p>The most striking feature of thermonuclear reactions is their strong sensitivity to

is about the most strongly varying function treated in physics, and this temperature
</p>
<p>sensitivity has a clear influence on stellar models. Also, since small fluctuations

<p>of T (which will certainly be present) must result in drastic changes in the energy
</p>
<p>production, we have to assume that there exists an effective stabilizing mechanism
</p>
<p>(a thermostat) in stars (Sect. 25.3.5).
</p>
<p>We may easily see how the large � values are related to the change of the Gamow
</p>
<p>peak with T : the value h�vi is proportional to the integral J in (18.30), and this is
given by the area under the Gamow peak, which is roughly J � �E �H0.H0 D e��

strongly with T . In fact it is this height H0 which provides the exponential e

<p>�� in
the expressions for h�vi and is therefore responsible for the large values of �.
</p>
<p>We should briefly mention a few corrections to the derived formulae for the
</p>
<p>reaction rates. The first concerns inaccuracies made by evaluating the integral
</p>
<p>in (18.24) with constant S and with an integrand approximated by a Gaussian. This

<p>plays a role only at very high densities; it will be treated separately in Sect. 18.4.
</p>
<p>Concerning resonant reactions we shall only remark that the situation depends

<p>very much on the location of the resonance. For example, the integral in (18.24)

<p>We have seen that the repulsive Coulomb forces of the nucleus play a decisive role
</p>
<p>in controlling the rate of thermonuclear reactions. Therefore any modification of

<p>It is clear that beyond a certain distance an approaching particle will &ldquo;feel&rdquo; a neutral

</p>
<p>isolated charge of the target nucleus.
</p>
<p>The first step is to consider the polarization that the nucleus of charge CZe
produces in its surrounding. The electrons of charge �e are attracted and have a
slightly larger density ne in the neighbourhood of the nucleus; the other ions are
</p>
<p>repelled and have a slightly decreased density ni in comparison with their average

<p>18.5 The Major Nuclear Burning Stages
</p>
<p>Although no chemical reactions are involved, one usually calls the thermonuclear
</p>
<p>fusion of a certain element the &ldquo;burning&rdquo; of this element. Owing to the properties of
</p>
<p>thermonuclear reaction rates, different burnings are well separated by appreciable
</p>
<p>temperature differences. A review of the cross sections for all possible reactions
</p>
<p>in the major burning stages shows that only very few reactions occur with non-
</p>
<p>negligible rates during a certain phase. The most important ones will be listed below.
</p>
<p>Their important properties, such as the astrophysical factors S0, correction factors
</p>
<p>to (18.32), or energy release Q, can be found in the literature (e.g. Caughlan and
</p>
<p>Fowler 1988; Harris and Fowler 1983; Adelberger et al. 2011; Angulo et al. 1999).
</p>
<p>TheQ values usually contain all of the energymade available to the stellar matter
</p>
<p>by one such reaction. This includes the energies of the &#13; rays that are either directly
</p>
<p>emitted or created by pair annihilation after eC emission. Excluded, however, is the
energy carried away by neutrinos, since they normally do not interact with the stellar
</p>
<p>material.
</p>
<p>A whole &ldquo;network&rdquo; of all simultaneously occurring reactions (8.7) has to be
</p>
<p>calculated if one is interested in details such as the isotopic abundances produced
</p>
<p>by the reactions or if the star changes on a timescale comparable with that of one of
</p>
<p>the reactions. The total " is then obtained as a sum of (18.23) over all reactions, and
</p>
<p>one has to ensure the correct bookkeeping of the changing abundances of all nuclei
</p>
<p>involved. We have encountered nuclear reaction networks also in Sect. 12.3.
</p>
<p>If one is interested only in the energy production, often, a much simpler
</p>
<p>procedure suffices in which only the rate for the slowest of a chain of subsequent
</p>
<p>reactions is calculated, since it determines essentially the rate of the whole fusion
</p>
<p>process. An example of such a &ldquo;bottleneck&rdquo; is the 14N reaction in the CNO cycle
</p>
<p>(see below). Then (18.23) has to be used for this reaction, but with Q equal to the
</p>
<p>sum of all energies released in the single reactions.
</p>
<p>In this section, all formulae for "will be given in units of erg g�1s�1, % in g cm�3,
and T in the dimensionless form Tn D T=10nK. As usual we denote byXj the mass
fraction of nuclei with mass number A D j .</p>

<p>18.5 The Major Nuclear Burning Stages 193
</p>
<p>18.5.1 Hydrogen Burning
</p>
<p>The net result of hydrogen burning is the fusion of four 1H nuclei into one 4He
</p>
<p>nucleus. The difference in binding energy is almost exactly 27.0MeV, correspond-
</p>
<p>ing to a mass defect of about 0.7 per cent. This is roughly 10 times the energy
</p>
<p>liberated in any other fusion process, though not all of this energy is available to
</p>
<p>stellar matter. The fusion requires the transformation of two protons into neutrons,
</p>
<p>i.e. two ˇC decays, which must be accompanied by two neutrino emissions
(conservation of lepton number). The neutrinos carry away 2 : : : 30 per cent of the
</p>
<p>whole energy liberated, the amount depending strongly on the reaction in which
</p>
<p>they are emitted.
</p>
<p>There are different chains of reactions by which a fusion process can be
</p>
<p>completed and which in general will occur simultaneously in a star. The two main
</p>
<p>series of reactions are known as the proton&ndash;proton chain and the CNO cycle.
</p>
<p>The proton&ndash;proton chain (pp chain) is named after its first reaction, between two
</p>
<p>protons forming a deuterium nucleus 2H, which then reacts with another proton to
</p>
<p>form 3He:
</p>
<p>1H C 1H ! 2HC eC C � ;
2H C 1H ! 3HeC &#13; : (18.61)
</p>
<p>The first of these reactions is unusual in comparison with most other fusion
</p>
<p>processes. In order to form 2H, the protons have to experience a ˇC decay at the
time of their closest approach. This is a process governed by the weak interaction
</p>
<p>and is very unlikely. Therefore the first reaction has a very small cross section.
</p>
<p>The completion of a 4He nucleus can proceed via one of three alternative
</p>
<p>branches (pp1, pp2, pp3) all of which start with 3He. The first alternative requires
</p>
<p>two 3He nuclei, i.e. the reactions in (18.61) have first to be completed twice. The
</p>
<p>other alternatives require that 4He already exists (either it is present because of its
</p>
<p>primordial abundance, or because it was already produced earlier by this burning
</p>
<p>process). The branching between pp2 and pp3 exists, since 7Be can react either with
</p>
<p>e� or with 1H. All possibilities can be seen from the following scheme:

<p>194 18 Nuclear Energy Production

<p>Owing to the different energies carried away by the neutrinos, the energies

<p>released to the stellar matter differ for the three chains. They are QD 26:50.pp1),

<p>pp2 and pp3 branches.
</p>
<p>Three reactions in (18.62) release neutrinos, which are given names according to
</p>
<p>the element being processed in these reactions: pp-, 7Be-, and 8B-neutrinos. If they
</p>
<p>are the only lepton emitted, then their energy is well defined. The 7Be-neutrinos
</p>
<p>carry away 0.863MeV in 90% of the reactions, and 0.386MeV in the remaining
</p>
<p>10%, depending on the energy state of 7Li produced. If the neutrinos are emitted
</p>
<p>along with a positron (eC), the two leptons share the energy, and a spectrum of
neutrino energies results. The upper limits are 0.423MeV for the pp-neutrinos and
</p>
<p>15MeV for those of the 8B reaction. The average values are 0.267 and 6.735MeV
</p>
<p>respectively.
</p>
<p>The relative frequency of the different branches depends on the chemical com-
</p>
<p>position, the temperature, and the density. The 3He&ndash;4He reaction has a 14% larger
</p>
<p>reduced mass, a 4.6% larger � , and thus a slightly larger temperature sensitivity
</p>
<p>� than the 3He&ndash;3He reaction, cf. (18.34) and (18.39). With increasing T, pp2 and
</p>
<p>pp3 will therefore dominate more and more over pp1 (say above T7 � 1) if 4He is
present in appreciable amounts. And with increasing T , the relative importance will
</p>
<p>gradually shift from the electron capture (pp2) to the proton capture (pp3) of 7Be.
</p>
<p>The energy generation in the pp chain should be calculated at small T (say below
</p>
<p>T6 � 8) by calculating all single reactions and their influence on the nuclei involved.
For larger T , there will be an equilibrium abundance established for these nuclei
</p>
<p>(equal rates of consumption and production) and one can simply take the whole "pp
as proportional to that of the pp1 branch, which in turn may be calculated from the
</p>
<p>rate of the first reaction 1H + 1H:

</p>
<p>where "pp and % are in cgs and f11 is the shielding factor for this reaction. The factor
</p>
<p> corrects for the additional energy generation in the branches pp2 and pp3 if there
</p>
<p>is appreciable 4He present (see Fig. 18.7). For gradually increasing T; starts with
</p>
<p>the value 1 and can then increase to values close to 2 (at T7 � 2), at which point
pp2 takes over, since then each 1H&ndash;1H reaction gives one 4He (compared to every
</p>
<p>second such reaction in the branch pp1). After this maximum,  decreases again to
</p>
<p>about 1.5 where pp3 has taken over owing to its Q being much smaller than those
</p>
<p>of the other branches.
</p>
<p>The formulation of the energy generation " as given in (18.63) is an analytical
</p>
<p>fit to measured and tabulated values, based on T -dependences of non-resonant
</p>
<p>reactions and resonances. They may vary from group to group; the one used here is

<p>taken from Angulo et al. (1999).</p>

The CNO cycle is the other main series of reactions in hydrogen burning. It

<p>requires the presence of some isotopes of C, N, or O, which are reproduced in a

<p>manner similar to catalysts in chemical reactions. The sequence of reactions can be

<p>(18.64)
</p>
<p>The main cycle (CNO-I; upper 6 lines of this scheme) is completed after the
</p>
<p>initially consumed 12C is reproduced by 15NC 1H. This reaction shows a branching
via 16O into a secondary cycle (CNO-II; connected with the main cycle by dashed
</p>
<p>arrows), which is, however, roughly 103 times less probable. Its main effect is that
</p>
<p>the 16O nuclei originally present in the stellar matter can also take part in the cycle,
</p>
<p>since they are finally transformed into 14N by the last three reactions of (18.64).
</p>
<p>The decay times for the ˇC decays are of the order of 102 : : : 103 s. As usual, a
network of all simultaneous reactions has to be calculated for lower temperatures,

<p>rapid changes, or if a detailed knowledge about the abundances of all nuclei involved
</p>
<p>is desired.
</p>
<p>As in the case of the pp chains, two protons have to be converted in effect to

<p>neutrons in the process, which will release two neutrinos per new helium nucleus.</p>

</p>
<p>18.5.2 Helium Burning
</p>
<p>The reactions of helium burning consist of the gradual fusion of several 4He into
12C, 16O, : : : . This requires temperatures of T8 &amp; 1, i.e. appreciably higher than
</p>
<p>those for hydrogen burning, because of the higher Coulomb barriers.
</p>
<p>The first and key reaction is the formation of 12C from three 4He nuclei, which is
</p>
<p>called the triple ˛ reaction (or 3˛ reaction). A closer look shows that it is performed
</p>
<p>in two steps, since a triple encounter is too improbable:
</p>
<p>4He C 4He � 8Be ;
8Be C 4He ! 12CC &#13; : (18.66)
</p>
<p>In the first step, two ˛ particles temporarily form a 8Be nucleus. Its ground state is
</p>
<p>nearly 100 keV higher in energy and therefore decays back into the two ˛&rsquo;s after a
</p>
<p>few times 10�16 s. This seems to be a very short time at a first glance, but it is roughly
105 times larger than the duration of a normal scattering encounter. The probability
</p>
<p>for another reaction occurring during this time is correspondingly enhanced. In
</p>
<p>fact the lifetime of 8Be is sufficient to build up an average concentration of these
</p>
<p>nuclei of about 10�9 in the stellar matter. The high densities then ensure a sufficient
rate of further ˛ captures that form 12C nuclei [the second step in (18.66)]. Both
</p>
<p>these reactions are complicated owing to the involvement of resonances. The energy
</p>
<p>release per 12C nucleus formed is 7.274MeV. This gives an energy release per unit
</p>
<p>mass that is 10.4 times smaller than in the case of the CNO cycle (where only four

<p>instead of 12 nucleons are processed): E3˛ D 5:8 � 1017 erg g�1. The resulting

<p>within this uncertainty range as a result of new measurements. Kunz et al. (2002)

<p>In each reaction 16O .˛; &#13;/ 20Ne, an energy of 4.73MeV is released. The rate is

</p>
<p>Summarizing, we can say that during helium-burning reactions, (18.66)

</p>
<p>by "He D "3˛ C "12;˛ C "16;˛. If the initial 4He is transformed into equal amounts of

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.5 The Major Nuclear Burning Stages 199
</p>
<p>The general course of helium burning is always according to the following
</p>
<p>scheme: initially, when burning sets in at temperatures around 108K, the triple-
</p>
<p>˛ reaction is dominating, both because of a larger cross section and of the
</p>
<p>carbon and oxygen abundances, which are low in comparison to that of helium.
</p>
<p>With progressing conversion of helium to carbon, the 12C(˛; &#13; )16O becomes more
</p>
<p>competitive. The increasing temperature is supporting this.When the helium content
</p>
<p>gets low, the fact that the triple-˛ reaction is proportional to the third power of
</p>
<p>the helium abundance disfavours it increasingly, such that the burning of carbon
</p>
<p>is larger than its creation by triple-˛ reactions, and its abundance decreases again,
</p>
<p>while simultaneously that of 16O increases. The final abundances of 12C and 16Owill
</p>
<p>thus depend on the competition between the reactions (18.69) and the exhaustion
</p>
<p>of 4He particles. This depends mainly on the 12C(˛; &#13; )16O rate: if it is higher, the
</p>
<p>destruction of 12C will set in earlier and a higher O:C ratio will result. Overall,
</p>
<p>the outcome of helium burning is O:C � 1:1&ndash;2:1. Neon production is comparably
unimportant.
</p>
<p>18.5.3 Carbon Burning and Beyond
</p>
<p>For a mixture consisting mainly of 12C and 16O (as would be found in the central
</p>
<p>part of a star after helium burning), carbon burning will set in if the temperature
</p>
<p>or the density rises sufficiently. The typical range of temperature for this burning is
</p>
<p>T8 � 5 : : : 10.
Here (and in the following types of burning) the situation is already so difficult
</p>
<p>that one often has to rely on rough approximations and guesses, or on complete
</p>
<p>nuclear networks. The first complication is that the original 12CC12C reaction
produces an excited 24Mg nucleus, which can decay via many different channels
</p>
<p>(the last column givesQ/1MeV):
</p>
<p>12CC 12C ! 24Mg C &#13; ; 13:931
! 23Mg C n ; �2:605
! 23Na C p ; 2:238
! 20Ne C ˛ ; 4:616
! 16O C 2˛ ; �0:114
</p>
<p>(18.72)
</p>
<p>The relative frequency of the channels is very different, and depends also on the
</p>
<p>temperature. The &#13; decay (leaving 24Mg) is rather improbable, and the same is
</p>
<p>true for the two endothermic decays (23MgC n and 16O C 2˛). The most probable
reactions are those which yield 23NaCp and 20NeC˛. These are believed to occur
at about equal rates for temperatures that are not too high (say T9 &lt; 3).
</p>
<p>The next problem is that the produced p and ˛ find themselves at temperatures
</p>
<p>extremely high for hydrogen and helium burning and will immediately react with
</p>
<p>some of the particles in the mixture (from 12C up to 24Mg). They may even start</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>200 18 Nuclear Energy Production
</p>
<p>whole reaction chains, such as 12C(p; &#13; )13N(eC�)13C(˛; n)16O, where the neutron
could immediately react further. All these details would have to be evaluated
</p>
<p>quantitatively in order to find the average energy gain and the final products. For
</p>
<p>a rough guess one may assume that on average, Q � 13MeV are released per
12C&ndash;12C reaction (including all follow-up reactions). Then (Caughlan and Fowler

</p>
<p>with " and % in cgs and with T9a D T9=.1C0:0396T9/. The screening factor fCC can
become important (see Fig. 18.6), since this burning can start in very dense matter.
</p>
<p>The end products may be mainly 16O, 20Ne, 24Mg, and 28Si.
</p>
<p>For oxygen burning, 16OC16O, the Coulomb barrier is already so high that the
necessary temperature is T9 &amp; 1. As in the case of carbon burning, the reaction can
</p>
<p>proceed via several channels:
</p>
<p>16OC16O ! 32S C &#13; ; 16:541
! 31P C p ; 7:677

</p>
<p>(18.74)
</p>
<p>Most frequent is the p decay, followed by the ˛ decays. Again, all released p; n;
</p>
<p>and ˛ are captured immediately, giving rise to a multitude of secondary reactions.
</p>
<p>Among the end products, one will find a large amount of 28Si. For an average energy
</p>
<p>Q � 16MeV released per 16OC16O reaction, the energy generation rate is roughly

</p>
<p>For T9 &gt; 1, one also has to consider the possibility of photodisintegration of
</p>
<p>nuclei that are not too strongly bound. Here the radiation field contains a significant
</p>
<p>number of photons with energies in the MeV range, which can be absorbed by
</p>
<p>a nucleus, breaking it up, for example, by ˛ decay. This is a complete analogue
</p>
<p>of photoionization of atoms, and, in equilibrium, a formula equivalent to the Saha
</p>
<p>formula [see (14.11)] holds for the number densities ni and nj of the final particles

<p>18.6 Neutron-Capture Nucleosynthesis 201
</p>
<p>where Q is the difference in binding energies between the original nucleus and
</p>
<p>its fragments. .Q corresponds to the ionization energy �; however, it is about
</p>
<p>102 : : : 103 times larger because of the much stronger nuclear forces.) The pro-
</p>
<p>portionality factor contains essentially the partition functions of the three types of
</p>
<p>particles. Equilibrium is usually not reached, and the details are very complicated
</p>
<p>and may differ from case to case, which is also true for the amount of energy
</p>
<p>released or lost.
</p>
<p>The photodisintegration itself is, of course, endothermic. But the ejected particles
</p>
<p>.Xj / will be immediately recaptured. The capture can lead back to the original
</p>
<p>nucleus Xij , i.e. the reaction would be Xij � Xi C Xj , or it can lead to quite
different, even heavier, nuclei Xjk that are more strongly bound than the original
</p>
<p>one Xj C Xk ! Xjk. The latter case would be exothermic and can outweigh the
endothermic photodisintegration in the total energy balance.
</p>
<p>An example is neon disintegration, which in stellar evolution occurs even before
</p>
<p>oxygen burning:
</p>
<p>20NeC &#13; !16OC ˛ ; Q D �4:73MeV : (18.77)
</p>
<p>It dominates over the inverse reaction (known from helium burning) at T9 &gt; 1:5.
</p>
<p>The ejected ˛ particle reacts mainly with other 20Ne nuclei, yielding 24MgC&#13; . The
net result will then be the conversion of Ne into O and Mg:
</p>
<p>2 20NeC &#13; ! 16OC24 MgC &#13; ; Q D C4:583MeV : (18.78)
</p>
<p>Another example is the photodisintegration of 28Si, which may be the dominant
</p>
<p>reaction at the end of oxygen burning. Near T9 � 3, 28Si can be decomposed by the
photons and eject n; p; or ˛. There follows a large number of reactions in which the
</p>
<p>thereby created nuclei (e.g. Al, Mg, Ne) will also be subject to photodisintegration,
</p>
<p>leading to the existence of an appreciable amount of free n; p; and ˛ particles. These
</p>
<p>react with the remaining 28Si, thus building up gradually heavier nuclei, until 56Fe is
</p>
<p>reached. Since 56Fe is so strongly bound, it may survive this melting pot as the only
</p>
<p>(or dominant) species. So, forgetting all intermediate stages, we would ultimately
</p>
<p>have the conversion of two 28Si into 56Fe, which can be called silicon burning.
</p>
<p>For T9 &amp; 5, photodisintegration breaks up even the
56Fe nuclei into ˛ particles
</p>
<p>and thus reverses the effect of all prior burnings. Such processes can occur during
</p>
<p>supernova explosions (see Chap. 36).

<p>In Fig. 18.9 we show the solar abundances of elements. As on earth, we find all
</p>
<p>elements from hydrogen to lead and uranium in the Sun. The nuclear burning we
</p>
<p>discussed so far is able to produce only elements up to iron, since the creation of
</p>
<p>elements heavier than the &ldquo;iron peak&rdquo; is endothermic, and the electrostatic repulsion</p>

<p>Fig. 18.9 The abundances (particle number fractions) of elements in the Sun, normalized to a
</p>
<p>value of 106 for 28Si
</p>
<p>for charged particle reactions is increasing with nuclear charge. The various peaks
</p>
<p>in this figure reflect the stability of isotopes against further addition of neutrons and
</p>
<p>protons and are due to the structure of the nuclei, easily explained in the shell model
</p>
<p>of nuclear physics. In particular isotopes with even and equal numbers of neutrons
</p>
<p>and protons, such as 12C or 40Ca, are very stable and therefore more abundant than
</p>
<p>neighbouring ones. If nuclear shells are closed, the stability is even higher, similar
</p>
<p>to the noble gases in atomic physics. Such isotopes are called &ldquo;magic nuclei&rdquo; with
</p>
<p>&ldquo;magic&rdquo; numbers of protons or neutrons. 16O is a &ldquo;double-magic&rdquo; nucleus.
</p>
<p>During hydrostatic burning phases, the elements beyond the iron peak can be
</p>
<p>produced only if other reactions with lighter nuclei provide enough energy and,
</p>
<p>most easily, if the reactions are processing by the capture of neutrons, since they
</p>
<p>are electrically neutral. Adding neutrons leads initially to heavier isotopes of the
</p>
<p>same element, which become the more unstable the more neutrons they have. The
</p>
<p>decay proceeds by emission of an electron, which is temperature-insensitive and
</p>
<p>therefore is acting as a kind of nuclear clock. ˇ-decay times can reach from minutes
</p>
<p>to millions of years, and are getting shorter with increasing neutron excess. The
</p>
<p>decay leads to the creation of a new element of the same mass but with the charge
</p>
<p>being increased by one.

</p>
<p>The laboratory half-life time of the Cs isotopes is given. It can be appreciable shorter at stellar
</p>
<p>temperatures. 134Cs and 136Cs are so-called branching points, and the relative abundances of
</p>
<p>isotopes in the various branches allow conclusions about the temperature at the s-process site (after
</p>
<p>Busso et al. 1999)
</p>
<p>neutron-capture time is long compared to the ˇ-decay time, the process is called the
</p>
<p>slow neutron-capture process or simply the s-process, and the reaction path remains
</p>
<p>close to the line of ˇ-stability in the nuclear chart; if it is rapid, such that the first
</p>
<p>reaction in (18.79) is repeated several times, it is called the r-process. Subsequent
</p>
<p>neutron captures and ˇ-decays will lead to the creation of the heavy elements. The
</p>
<p>astrophysical site for the r-process is not clearly identified, but is probably to be
</p>
<p>found in supernova explosions or similar energetic events. The s-process is certainly
</p>
<p>taking place in stars of intermediate mass (M � 2 � � � 5Mˇ) in an advanced phase of
evolution (Sect. 34.3). In the atmospheres of such stars, short-lived isotopes of heavy
</p>
<p>elements (most importantly 99Tc with a half-life time of only 211,000years) have
</p>
<p>been found, which could only have been created in the stars themselves. Although
</p>
<p>the s-process may drain energy from the star, it is in fact unimportant for the energy
</p>
<p>budget and the structure of stars, mainly due to the extremely low abundances (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.9) with respect to the elements participating in the burning stages discussed
</p>
<p>earlier in this chapter. Figure 18.10 shows part of the s-process path in the Cs-Ba
</p>
<p>region of the nuclear chart. 138Ba has a magic neutron number (82) and therefore is
</p>
<p>very stable and abundant (Fig. 18.9).
</p>
<p>The necessary condition for the s- and r-process is the presence of neutrons.
</p>
<p>Since free neutrons are both unstable and are easily captured by other nuclei, a
</p>
<p>constant source of neutron production is needed. Considering the burning phases
</p>
<p>of Sect. 18.5, we realize that only protons and ˛-particles were involved. The
</p>
<p>generation of neutrons is indeed a very rare event in a star&rsquo;s life. However, in
</p>
<p>Sect. 18.5.3, we already mentioned that during carbon burning, the various reaction
</p>
<p>channels may lead to whole chains of subsequent reactions, one of them resulted
</p>
<p>in 13C.˛; n/16O. Indeed, this is one of the two neutron sources identified, the other
</p>
<p>being 22Ne.˛; n/25Mg, the end reaction of the sequence 14N.˛; &#13;/18O.˛; &#13;/22Ne,
</p>
<p>which is operating at temperatures of about 4 � 108K. Such temperatures are
encountered during helium burning in massive stars, where the neon source may
</p>
<p>produce s-process elements.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>204 18 Nuclear Energy Production
</p>
<p>The alternative carbon source for neutrons apparently requires the simultaneous
</p>
<p>presence of protons and ˛-particles as well as temperatures above 2 � 108K for
the ˛-capture. However, at these temperatures, usually all protons are already burnt
</p>
<p>to helium, and the amount of 13C is very low, since the overwhelming carbon
</p>
<p>isotope is 12C from helium burning. The solution is to bring fresh hydrogen into
</p>
<p>hot layers of freshly produced 12C but to keep the abundance of protons so low that
</p>
<p>no further CNO processing to 14N is happening. Such a situation can be achieved
</p>
<p>by complicated sequences of mixing processes between the helium-burning regions
</p>
<p>of a star of intermediate mass and its hydrogen-rich envelope. We will discuss this
</p>
<p>in Sect. 34.3. In full stellar models, the neutron densities achieved range from 106
</p>
<p>to 1010 cm�3.
The neutron-capture cross section is inversely dependent on velocity (or temper-
</p>
<p>ature):

<p>� � 1
v
; (18.80)
</p>
<p>therefore h�vi in (18.21) is actually close to a constant (�v) times the integral
over f .E/ and only slightly dependent on the stellar plasma temperature, except
</p>
<p>for nuclei close to magic neutron numbers, where � may be lower by an order
</p>
<p>of magnitude or more. It generally lies in the range of 100 to 1000mb (1 b =
</p>
<p>10�24 cm2).
We define
</p>
<p>h�i WD h�.v/vi=vT ; (18.81)
</p>
<p>where vT D .2kT=�n/1=2 is the thermal velocity in the system of a nucleus A and
a neutron n, �n being the reduced mass of it. h�i corresponds approximately to the
cross section measured at that relative velocity. The rate equation for a nucleus with
</p>
<p>mass A and density nA is then

<p>dnA
</p>
<p>dt
D �h�.v/viAnnnA C h�.v/viA�1nnnA�1 : (18.82)

<p>dnA

<p>dt
D vT nn.��AnA C �A�1nA�1/ : (18.83)
</p>
<p>Since the neutron density nn may vary with time, we define

</p>
<p>so we obtain
</p>
<p>dnA
</p>
<p>d�
D ��AnA C �A�1nA�1 : (18.85)
</p>
<p>This equation is self-regulating: assume that initially nA is very small. Then nA will

<p>grow due to the positive second term in (18.85). This will also increase the first</p>

</p>
<p>term until the right-hand side vanishes and nA has reached a stationary value. The

nn.t/dt; (18.86)
</p>
<p>is called the neutron exposure and reflects the integrated flux of neutrons with

<p>thermal velocities. Its dimension is that of an inverse area and typically of order
</p>
<p>mb�1. It is the decisive quantity determining the overall abundances of elements
produced by neutron captures, and how far the s- or r-process can proceed. The
</p>
<p>relative abundances of isotopes produced then reflect the cross section � .
</p>
<p>The synthesis of neutron-capture elements has to be computed with huge nuclear
</p>
<p>networks consisting of hundreds of isotopes and even more reactions. Simplified

<p>models assuming a distribution of neutron exposures on a single initial seed nucleus,

<p>Neutrinos require special consideration because their cross section �� for interaction
</p>
<p>with matter is so extremely small. For scattering of neutrinos with energy E� ; one
</p>
<p>has roughly �� � .E�=mec2/210�44 cm2. Neutrinos in the MeV range then have

<p>with % in cgs. For &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stellar matter with %� 1 g cm�3, (18.89) would give a
mean free path of the neutrinos of `� � 100 parsec, and even for % D 106 g cm�3,
one has `� � 3000Rˇ.
</p>
<p>Therefore it is safe to say that neutrinos, once created somewhere in the central
</p>
<p>region, leave a normal star without interactions carrying away their energy. This
</p>
<p>neutrino energy has then to be excluded from all other forms of energies (e.g.
</p>
<p>that released by nuclear reactions), which are subject to some diffusive transport
</p>
<p>of energy according to the temperature gradient.
</p>
<p>The situation can be completely different, however, during a collapse in the final
</p>
<p>evolutionary stage. The density can reach nuclear values, and for %D 1014 g cm�3,
(18.89) gives only `� � 20 km. Considering the fact that neutrinos can then be
rather energetic (which increases �� appreciably) one sees that many of themwill be
</p>
<p>reabsorbed within the star. Then it is necessary to consider a transport equation for
</p>
<p>neutrino energy and to evaluate the amount of momentum the interacting neutrinos
</p>
<p>deliver to the overlying layers (see Sect. 36.3.3).
</p>
<p>Only electron neutrinos play a role in stellar interiors, and these can be created
</p>
<p>in quite different processes inside a star. We first recall those processes involving
</p>
<p>nuclear reactions, which have already been mentioned (Sect. 18.5) in connection
</p>
<p>with certain nuclear burnings. In this special case one usually allows for the neutrino
</p>
<p>energy loss by a corresponding reduction of the released energy [This means that
</p>
<p>in (10.3) "n is reduced and no separate "� term is needed.].
</p>
<p>We already encountered this situation in the case of hydrogen burning
</p>
<p>(Sect. 18.5.1), where two neutrinos per fresh helium nucleus are created. The energy
</p>
<p>loss due to the escaping neutrinos depends on the particular chain or cycle by which
</p>
<p>the burning proceeds, but on average the energy yield per cycle is 25MeV or
</p>
<p>� 4 � 10�5 erg. The generation of one solar luminosity .Lˇ � 4 � 1033 erg s�1/
by hydrogen burning implies thus a production of about 2 � 1038 neutrinos per
second. Those neutrinos coming directly from the central region of the Sun yield
</p>
<p>a flux of roughly 1011 neutrinos per cm2 each second at the distance of earth. For
</p>
<p>experiments measuring the solar neutrinos see Sect. 29.5.
</p>
<p>There are also neutrino-producing nuclear reactions that are not connected with
</p>
<p>nuclear burnings. For example, at extreme densities, degenerate electrons can be
</p>
<p>pushed up to energies large enough for electron capture by protons in nuclei of
</p>
<p>chargeZ and atomic weight A W e� C .Z;A/! .Z � 1;A/C �.
Another interesting example is the so-calledUrca process. For a suitable nucleus
</p>
<p>.Z;A/; an electron capture occurs which is followed by ˇ decay:
</p>
<p>.Z;A/C e� ! .Z � 1;A/C � ;
</p>
<p>.Z � 1;A/! .Z;A/C e� C N� : (18.90)
</p>
<p>The original particles are restored, and two neutrinos are emitted. There are obvious
</p>
<p>restrictions on the nuclei .Z;A/ suitable for this process: they must have an isobaric
</p>
<p>nucleus .Z�1, A/ of slightly higher energy that is unstable to ˇ decay. A possible
example would be 35 Cl .e�; �/35S (endothermic with Q D �0:17MeV), followed</p>

</p>
<p>that, as the only recognizable net effect, similar losses, little by little, occur with
</p>
<p>visitors&rsquo; money.). Details depend very much on the stellar material. If appropriate
</p>
<p>nuclei for this are present, the energy loss will increase with % and T .
</p>
<p>The following processes occur without a nuclear reaction. These purely leptonic
</p>
<p>processes were predicted as a consequence of the generalized Fermi theory of weak
</p>
<p>interaction, which allows a direct electron&ndash;neutrino coupling, such that a neutrino
</p>
<p>pair can be emitted if an electron changes its momentum. It is clear that such
</p>
<p>processes may be reduced by degeneracy if the electrons do not find enough free
</p>
<p>cells in phase space.
</p>
<p>Several processes of this type can be important for stellar interiors. Figure 18.11
</p>
<p>shows the approximate regions of the %� T plane where this is the case. Generally,
the energy loss rates are complicated functions of density and temperature. They
</p>
<p>are calculated from theories of weak interaction and the results obtained as tables,
</p>
<p>for which approximative analytical fitting formulae are derived, which themselves
</p>
<p>are too complicated to be reproduced here. A compilation of results is given by Itoh
</p>
<p>et al. (1996); a somewhat simpler fitting formula for plasma neutrinos was derived
</p>
<p>by Haft et al. (1994).

<p>Simple Stellar Models
</p>
<p>While accurate stellar models have to be computed with numerical programmes, for
</p>
<p>a deeper understanding of stellar properties, general rules and dependencies, and
</p>
<p>approximative relations, simple stellar models are very useful. They are often based
</p>
<p>on simplifications of the material functions discussed in Part III or by assuming
</p>
<p>similarity relations between stars. The polytropes of Chap. 19 were essential for the
</p>
<p>earliest models of stellar interior but have now gone out of fashion. Nevertheless, we
</p>
<p>present the definition and the basic properties for those interested in simple models.
</p>
<p>The homology relations of Chap. 20 are formulated very generally; one usually finds
</p>
<p>them in more simplified versions, where they are used to derive simple relations
</p>
<p>like the mass-luminosity-relation for main sequence stars. Simple relations also are
</p>
<p>useful in clarifying popular misconceptions about stars, such as the assumption that
</p>
<p>the solar luminosity depends on the nuclear reaction rates (see Sect. 20.2).
</p>
<p>In the later sections of this part it will become evident how useful simplified
</p>
<p>models can be to capture basic principles of stellar structure and evolution. Of
</p>
<p>course, all these are obtained with high accuracy from numerical solutions, but
</p>
<p>understanding them is a different issue.</p>

already encountered examples for simpler cases. If % does not depend on T , i.e.

<p>where K; &#13; , and n are constant. A relation of the form (19.3) is called a polytropic
</p>
<p>relation.K is the polytropic constant and &#13; the polytropic exponent (which we have
</p>
<p>to distinguish from the adiabatic exponent &#13;ad). One often uses, instead of &#13; , the
</p>
<p>polytropic index n, which is defined by
</p>
<p>n D 1
&#13; � 1 : (19.4)
</p>
<p>Obviously for a completely degenerate gas the equation of state in its limiting cases
</p>
<p>has the polytropic form (19.3). In the non-relativistic limit (15.23) we have &#13; D 5=3,
n D 3=2, while for the relativistic limit (15.26) holds, so that &#13; = 4/3, n D 3. For
such cases, where the equation of state has a polytropic form, the polytropic constant
</p>
<p>K is fixed and can be calculated from natural constants.
</p>
<p>But there are also examples for a relation of the form (19.3) where K is a free
</p>
<p>parameter which is constant within a particular star but can have different values
</p>
<p>from one star to another.
</p>
<p>Let us consider an isothermal ideal gas of temperature T D T0 and mean
molecular weight �. Its equation of state % D �P=.&lt;T / can be written in the form
(19.3), with K D &lt;T0=�; &#13; D 1; and n D 1. Here K is not fixed but depends on
T0 and �, and if we then use (19.3) in the stellar-structure equations, we are free to
</p>
<p>giveK any (positive) value for a certain star.
</p>
<p>In a star that is completely convective the temperature gradient (except for that
</p>
<p>in a region near the surface, which we shall ignore) is given, to a very good
</p>
<p>approximation, by r D .d lnT=d lnP/ad D rad (see Sect. 7.3). If radiation
pressure can be ignored and the gas is completely ionized, we have rad D 2=5
according to (13.12). This means that throughout the star T � P 2=5, and for an
ideal gas with � = constant, T � P=%, and therefore P � %5=3. This again is a
polytropic relation of the form (19.3) with &#13; D 5=3, n D 3=2. But now K is not
fixed by natural constants; it is a free parameter in the sense that it can vary from
</p>
<p>star to star.
</p>
<p>The homogeneous gaseous sphere can also be considered a special case of the
</p>
<p>polytropic relation (19.3). Let us write (19.3) in the form
</p>
<p>% D K1P 1=&#13; I (19.5)
</p>
<p>then &#13; D 1 (or n D 0) gives % D K1 D constant.
These examples have shown that we can have two reasons for a polytropic
</p>
<p>relation in a star. (1) The equation of state is of the simple form P D K%&#13; , with a
fixed value ofK . (2) The equation of state contains T (as for an ideal gas), but there
</p>
<p>is an additional relation between T andP (like the adiabatic condition) that together
</p>
<p>with the equation of state yields a polytropic relation; then K is a free parameter.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we assume a polytropic relation for an ideal gas, this is
</p>
<p>equivalent to adopting a certain relation T D T .P /. This means that one fixes
the temperature stratification instead of determining it by the thermo-energetic
</p>
<p>equations of stellar structure. For example, a polytrope with n D 3 does not</p>

</p>
<p>an ideal gas and have r D 1=.nC 1/ D 0:25.
</p>
<p>19.2 Polytropic Stellar Models
</p>
<p>With the polytropic relation (19.3) (independent of whether K is a free parameter
</p>
<p>or a constant with a fixed value), (19.1) can be written as

<p>If &#13; &curren; 1 (the case &#13; D 1; n D 1, corresponding to the isothermal model, will be
treated in Sect. 19.8), (19.6) can be integrated:

<p>where we havemade use of (19.4) and chosen the integration constant to give˚ D 0
at the surface (% D 0). Note that in the interior of our model, ˚ &lt; 0, giving there
% &gt; 0. If we introduce (19.7) into the right-hand side of the Poisson equation (19.2),

</p>
<p>This is the famous Lane&ndash;Emden equation (named after J.H. Lane and R. Emden).
</p>
<p>We are only interested in solutions that are finite at the centre, z D 0. Equa-
tion (19.10) shows that we then have to require dw=d z � w0 D 0. Let us assume we
have a solution w.z/ of (19.10) that fulfils the central boundary conditionsw.0/ D 1
and w0.0/ D 0; then according to (19.9) the radial distribution of the density is
given by

Pc D K%&#13;c .
</p>
<p>Before trying to construct stellar polytropic models we shall discuss some of the
</p>
<p>mathematical properties of the solutions w.z/ of (19.10).
</p>
<p>19.3 Properties of the Solutions
</p>
<p>The Lane&ndash;Emden equation has a regular singularity at z D 0. In order to understand
the behaviour of the solutions there, we expand into a power series:
</p>
<p>w.z/ D 1C a1zC a2z2 C a3z3 C : : : ; (19.12)
</p>
<p>with a1 D w0.0/; 2a2 D w00.0/; : : : . Since the gravitational acceleration jgj D
d˚=dr � dw=d zmust vanish in the centre, we have a1 D 0. Inserting (19.12) into
the Emden equation (19.10), by comparing coefficients one finds
</p>
<p>w.z/ D 1 � 1
6
z2 C n
</p>
<p>120
z4 C : : : ; (19.13)
</p>
<p>where again we have excluded the isothermal sphere n D 1. Equation (19.13)
shows that w.z/ has a maximum at z D 0.
</p>
<p>Only for three values of n can the solutions be given by analytic expressions. The
</p>
<p>first case is
</p>
<p>n D 0 W w.z/ D 1 � 1
6
z2 ; (19.14)
</p>
<p>and we have already mentioned that this corresponds to the homogeneous gas
</p>
<p>sphere. Indeed % D %cwn gives constant density for n D 0. The two other cases are

</p>
<p>The surface of the polytrope of index n is defined by the value z D zn; for which
% D 0 and thus w D 0. While for n D 0 and n D 1 the surface is obviously reached
for a finite value of zn; the case n D 5 yields a model of infinite radius. It can be
shown that for n &lt; 5 the radius of polytropic models is finite; for n � 5 they have
infinite radius. This also holds for the limiting case n D 1 (cf. Sect. 19.8).
</p>
<p>Apart from the three cases where analytic solutions are known, the Emden
</p>
<p>equation (19.10) has to be solved numerically, beginning with the expansion (19.13)
</p>
<p>for the neighbourhood of the centre. Here the solution starts with zero tangent and
</p>
<p>w D 1 and decreases outwards. This can be seen from (19.13) and is illustrated in
Fig. 19.1.
</p>
<p>For a given value of n &lt; 5 the integration comes to a point zwherew.z/ vanishes,
</p>
<p>i.e. % D 0. This value of z, which corresponds to the surface of the polytrope, will
be called zn. From (19.14)&ndash;(19.16) one finds z0 D
</p>
<p>p
6; z1 D �; z5 D 1. It is a
</p>
<p>general property of the solutions that zn grows monotonically with the polytropic
</p>
<p>index n. Table 19.1 gives some values of zn and the values of certain functions at
</p>
<p>z D zn which will later turn out to be useful for the construction of models.
So far, we have discussed only solutions that are regular at the centre. But
</p>
<p>solutions with a singularity at z D 0 can also be important if one uses them for stellar
regions outside the centre. Let us, for instance, consider a star that is convective in
</p>
<p>its outer layer, while in the inner part, the energy may be transported by radiation.
</p>
<p>If the convective envelope is adiabatic, with r D rad D 2=5, it is polytropic and
therefore % � w3=2 and P � w5=2. But it is unimportant whether this solution is
finite at the centre, since anyway the equations do not hold in the radiative interior.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>218 19 Polytropic Gaseous Spheres
</p>
<p>On the other hand, one may have to fit a polytropic central core to an envelope
</p>
<p>with different properties. In this case the polytropic solution has to be regular at the
</p>
<p>centre, but its behaviour for w D % D 0 is unimportant, since it is used only up to
the core surface where % and P are non-vanishing. In the following we mainly deal
</p>
<p>with complete polytropes, which have a polytropic relation of the form (19.3) from
</p>
<p>surface to centre.
</p>
<p>19.4 Application to Stars
</p>
<p>We now construct polytropic models for a given index n &lt; 5 and for given values of
</p>
<p>M and R. This will turn out to be possible as long asK is not fixed by the equation
</p>
<p>of state. We first derive some more relations for polytropes.
</p>
<p>From (10.1) and (19.11) it follows that

</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>wnz2d z ; (19.17)
</p>
<p>where we have made use of relations (19.9) and of the fact that r3=z3 is constant
</p>
<p>and can be brought in front of the integral. According to the Lane&ndash;Emden equation
</p>
<p>(19.10) the integrand wnz2 on the right is a derivative and can immediately be
</p>
<p>integrated, so that the integral becomes �z2dw=d z. We obtain
</p>
<p>m.r/ D 4�%cr3
�
�1
z
</p>
<p>dw
</p>
<p>d z
</p>
<p>�
; (19.18)
</p>
<p>where the simultaneously appearing z and r are related to each other by r=z D
1=A D R=zn. For the special case of the surface, we have
</p>
<p>M D 4�%cR3

z
</p>
<p>dw
</p>
<p>d z
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>zDzn
: (19.19)
</p>
<p>The quantity in brackets can be derived from Table 19.1 for several values of n:
</p>
<p>If we introduce the mean density N% WD 3M=.4�R3/, we find

</p>
<p>d z
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>zDzn
: (19.20)
</p>
<p>The right-hand side of this equation depends only on n: for n D 0 it is 1&ndash;as one
can see from (19.11). The higher n; the smaller N%=%c, which means the higher the
density concentration, as can be seen in Table 19.1.
</p>
<p>We now have all the means at hand to construct the whole polytropic stellar
</p>
<p>model for given values of n, M , and R for the case that K is not fixed by the
</p>
<p>equation of state.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.5 Radiation Pressure and the Polytrope n D 3 219
</p>
<p>If n is given, a numerical solution of the Lane&ndash;Emden equation (19.10) yields
</p>
<p>the functions w.z/;w0.z/ and the values of zn and of �zn=.3dw=d z/n. If we now use
M and R to determine the mean density N%, (19.20) gives %c. On the other hand, we
know the constantA D z=r D zn=R by which we adjust the dimensionless z scale to
the r scale. We therefore know the density distribution in the model %.r/ D %cwn.z/
from (19.11).With %c and the constantAwe can determineK from (19.9) and obtain
</p>
<p>the pressure distribution P.r/ D K%.nC1/=n D K%.nC1/=nc wnC1. The local mass m
then follows from (19.18) and the (known) relation between the z scale and the r
</p>
<p>scale. The whole mechanical structure is now determined. It has to be emphasized
</p>
<p>that this method of constructing models for given values of n;M; and R is only
</p>
<p>applicable ifK is a free parameter, otherwise the problem would be overdetermined
</p>
<p>(The case thatK has fixed value will be discussed in Sect. 19.6.).
</p>
<p>As an example we try to construct a polytropic model of index 3 for the Sun
</p>
<p>(M D 1:989 � 1033g, R D 6:96 � 1010 cm). For n D 3 Table 19.1 gives z3 D
6:897; %c= N% D 54:18. The mean density becomes N% D 1:41 g cm�3; consequently
the central density %c D 76:39 g cm�3 and, further,A D z3=R D 9:91�10�11. From
(19.9) we find K D 3:85 � 1014 and consequently Pc D 1:24 � 1017 dyn/cm2. For
the ideal gas equation with � D 0:62 corresponding to X � 0:7, Y � 0:3 we find
for the temperature Tc D 1:2 � 107K. A proper numerical solution of the full set
of stellar-structure equations for a chemically homogeneous model of 1Mˇ gives
Tc D 1:5�107K. We see that a polytropic estimate with n D 3 comes considerably
closer to the honestly computed value than our crude estimate in Sect. 2.3.
</p>
<p>19.5 Radiation Pressure and the Polytrope n D 3
</p>
<p>We consider here only the case thatK is a free parameter. In the example at the end
</p>
<p>of the previous section we approximated the Sun by a polytrope of n D 3. This is
formally equivalent to the assumption of an ideal gas (P � %T ) together with a
constant temperature gradient r D 1=4.T � P 1=4/. We will now show that this
polytropic relation with n D 3 can also be obtained by a certain assumption on the
radiation pressure. For an ideal gas with radiation pressure

into (19.21). This gives</p>

</p>
<p>which indeed is a polytropic relation with n D 3 for constant ˇ. Here the polytropic
constantK is again a free parameter, since we can choose ˇ in the interval 0, 1.
</p>
<p>In Sect. 19.10 we shall apply this to very massive stars. They are fully convective
</p>
<p>(r D rad) and dominated by radiation pressure.
Relation (19.23) goes back to A.S. Eddington, who obtained it for his famous
</p>
<p>&ldquo;standard model&rdquo;. He found that the full set of stellar-structure equations (including
</p>
<p>the thermo-energetic equations) could be solved very simply by the assumption
</p>
<p>�l=m D constant throughout the star. One then obtains ˇ D constant and therefore
the polytropic relation (19.23).
</p>
<p>19.6 Polytropic Stellar Models with Fixed K
</p>
<p>As a typical example we have already mentioned the non-relativistic degenerate
</p>

<p>expression there is no room for the choice of a free parameter as in (19.23). Although
</p>
<p>n D 3=2 is a particularly interesting case, we shall derive our relation for general
values of the polytropic index with n &lt; 5.
</p>
<p>Let us see how to construct a model with index n for a given value of %c. The
</p>
<p>functionsw.z/ and w0.z/ can be considered known from an integration of the Emden
equation. Then % D %cwn is known as a function of z. According to (19.9) the

</p>
<p>We see that for given K and n there is a one-dimensional manifold of models only,
</p>
<p>the parameter being either M or R (or %c), whereas there was a two-dimensional
</p>
<p>manifold (M and R as parameters) when K was a free parameter.
</p>
<p>Consider again the case of the non-relativistic degenerateX electron gas, which is
</p>
<p>not too bad an approximation for white dwarfs of small mass. With n D 3=2, (19.28)
gives R � M�1=3 and the surprising result that the larger the mass the smaller
the radius (This is made plausible by simple considerations in Sect. 37.1.). The
</p>
<p>model will shrink with increasing mass and should finally end as a point mass for

<p>infiniteM . But long before this, our assumed equation of state will not be valid any
</p>
<p>more, since from (19.27) we see that %c is proportional to�M 2. For ever-increasing
densities the electrons will become relativistic (see Sect. 16.2), and the equation of
</p>
<p>state (15.23) has to be replaced by (15.26). This means a transition from a polytrope
</p>
<p>n D 3=2 to one with n D 3 (and a different, but also given, polytropic constantK).
In this case we shall encounter a new problem, hinted at by the exponent in (19.28).
</p>
<p>19.7 Chandrasekhar&rsquo;s Limiting Mass
</p>
<p>In Sect. 19.6 we have seen that a polytropic model in which the pressure is provided
</p>
<p>by a non-relativistic degenerate electron gas reaches higher central and mean
</p>
<p>densities with growing total mass M . But with increasing density the electrons
</p>
<p>become gradually more relativistic. This starts in the central region where the
</p>
<p>density is highest, the outer parts remaining non-relativistic. Although we know
</p>
<p>that the transition between equations of state (15.23) and (15.26) does not occur
</p>
<p>abruptly, but smoothly via the more general equation of state (15.13), one can
</p>
<p>imagine that an idealized stellar model consisting of degenerate matter can be
</p>
<p>constructed by fitting two regions smoothly together: a (relativistic) polytropic core
</p>
<p>with n D 3 surrounded by a (non-relativistic) polytropic envelope with n D 3=2.
Indeed Chandrasekhar constructed his first white-dwarf model in this way.
</p>
<p>Let us consider how this idealized model changes with growing mass M . At
</p>
<p>smallM the whole model is still non-relativistic. The relativistic core will occur for
</p>
<p>%c &amp; 10
6 g cm�3 (Fig. 16.1) and gradually encompass larger parts of the model as %c
</p>
<p>increases. One would therefore expect the model finally to approach the state where
</p>
<p>all its mass (except a small surface region) is relativistic, so that a polytrope of index
</p>
<p>n D 3 would describe the whole model properly; however, there is a difficulty. As
one can see from (19.27) the mass does not vary with central density in the case of
</p>
<p>a polytrope of index n D 3 if K is fixed. In this case, (19.27) givesM D C1:</p>

</p>
<p>We therefore can expect that our series of models constructed by fitting an n D 3=2
envelope to an n D 3 core finds its end at a critical total massM D MCh as given by
(19.30). Or in other words our models of increasing central density tend to a finite
</p>
<p>mass and approach zero radius for %c ! 1. Of course, this final state is physically
unrealistic, since the equation of state is changed by different effects at very high
</p>
<p>density (see Chaps. 16, 37 and 38).
</p>
<p>Although we have discussed the problem only from the standpoint of poly-
</p>
<p>tropic models, the result for MCh remains numerically the same if one uses
</p>
<p>Chandrasekhar&rsquo;s more general equation of state (15.13) (compare the treatment in
</p>
<p>Sect. 37.1. The reason is that for extremely high density, (15.13) approaches the
</p>
<p>polytropic relation (19.3) with &#13; D 4=3 or n D 3.
It is surprising that the limiting mass not only is finite, but that it is so small that
</p>
<p>many stars exceed it. But their equation of state is not dominated by degenerate
</p>
<p>electrons, and therefore Chandrasekhar&rsquo;s limiting mass (19.30) has no meaning
</p>
<p>for them. White dwarfs seem to be formed of material where all the hydrogen
</p>
<p>is transformed into helium, carbon, or oxygen, such that we expect �e D 2 and
therefore MCh D 1:46Mˇ. Indeed no white dwarf has been found which exceeds
this mass.
</p>
<p>In the above considerations we have approached the relativistic degenerate
</p>
<p>polytrope by way of a sequence with %c ! 1 (and consequentlyR! 0). However,
this polytrope is a particular case: we have already mentioned that according to
</p>
<p>(19.27)M and %c are then no longer coupled. In other words, for M D MCh, the
central density can be arbitrary (and therefore also the radius R), i.e. there is a
</p>
<p>whole series of relativistic degenerate polytropes (having %c or R as parameter) that
</p>
<p>all have the same massMCh. This is a case of neutral equilibrium (see Sect. 25.3.2).

there can be no such stars, but polytropes with n D 1 can be used in order to

<p>In the interval 0 � ˇ � 1 the left-hand side is a monotonically decreasing function

<p>Supermassive stars are therefore dominated by radiation pressure. One conse-

and the star becomes convective with r D rad. This can also be seen from
an extrapolation of the main-sequence models towards large M (Sect. 22.3). The

<p>The supermassive star polytropes have a free K , which means that M can be
</p>
<p>chosen arbitrarily (in contrast to the relativistic degenerate polytrope of the same
</p>
<p>index, whereK andM were fixed). For each mass, .1 � ˇ/=.�ˇ/4 can be obtained
from (19.56), and then (19.53) gives the corresponding value ofK . But if the mass is

<p>given, there still exists an infinite number of models for differentR. This is possible
</p>
<p>in spite of the fact that K is already determined by M : since according to (19.55)
</p>
<p>%c � N% � M=R3, (19.54) shows K to be independent of R. This is typical for the
polytropic index n D 3.

<p>Equation (19.59) shows that for an adiabatic change .ds D 0/ of a given mass
element % � T 3, and thereforewith (19.57)P � %4=3 or &#13;ad D 4=3. Then � D 1 and
(19.52) gives the total energy of the modelW D 0. The supermassive configuration
is in neutral equilibrium. No energy is needed to compress or expand it. In Chap. 25
</p>
<p>we will find that &#13;ad D 4=3 corresponds to the case of marginal dynamical stability.
There a simple interpretation is given for this peculiar behaviour.

The time-dependent solution discussed here has to be understood in the following
</p>
<p>way. Let us consider a polytrope with n D 3 in equilibrium; then the equilibrium
is independent of radius. We have already seen that the total energy is W D 0
independent of the radius, see (19.52). Therefore the polytrope n D 3 is indifferent
to radial changes. If we now assume that suddenly the pressure is slightly reduced
</p>
<p>say, because the constantK is slightly diminished, then the gaseous sphere begins to
</p>
<p>contract. This contraction can be described by the two equations (19.75) and (19.76).
</p>
<p>The solution of the first gives the behaviour in time (19.79), while the second is used
</p>
<p>to derive the modification of the Lane&ndash;Emden equation due to the inertia terms. The
</p>
<p>parameter � is a measure of the deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium, caused by
</p>
<p>the assumed reduction of K .

<p>Homology Relations
</p>
<p>In physical problems it often happens that from one solution others can be obtained
</p>
<p>by simple transformations. When comparing different stellar models that are
</p>
<p>calculated under similar assumptions (concerning parameters or material functions),
</p>
<p>one therefore expects to find similarities in the solutions. It would be very helpful if
</p>
<p>we could find simple analytic expressions that transform one solution into another.
</p>
<p>It would then only be necessary to produce one numerical solution in order to
</p>
<p>find new ones by a transformation. There is indeed often a kind of &ldquo;similarity&rdquo;
</p>
<p>between different solutions, which is called homology, though the conditions for
</p>
<p>this are so severe that real stars will scarcely match them. There are a few cases,
</p>
<p>however, for which homology relations offer a rough, but helpful, indication for
</p>
<p>interpreting or predicting the numerical solutions. We indicate this in two examples,
</p>
<p>the main-sequencemodels and the homologous contraction. Except for this classical
</p>
<p>homology there is another type of homology, which applies to certain red giants (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 33.2).
</p>
<p>20.1 Definitions and Basic Relations
</p>
<p>When comparing different models (say of masses M andM 0, and radii R and R0)
one considers in particular homologous points at which the relative radii are equal:
</p>
<p>r=R D r 0=R0. We now speak of homologous stars if their homologous mass shells
.m=M D m0=M 0) are situated at homologous points. To be more precise, let us
consider all radii as functions of the relative mass values �, which are the same for
</p>
<p>homologous masses:
</p>
<p>� WD m=M D m0=M 0: (20.1)
</p>
<p>We can then write the homology condition as

<p>for all �. In homologous stars the ratio of the radii r=r 0 for homologous mass shells
is constant throughout the stars. Going from one homologous star to another, all
</p>
<p>homologous mass shells are compressed (or expanded) by the same factor R=R0
</p>
<p>(Note that therefore any two polytropic models of the same index n are homologous
</p>
<p>to each other.).
</p>
<p>Since both models have to fulfil the stellar-structure equations, the transition
</p>
<p>has, of course, consequences for all other variables. We derive these by comparing
</p>
<p>two homologous stars of massesM andM 0 and of two different compositions that
are supposed to be homogeneous and represented by the mean molecular weights
</p>
<p>� and �0. The ratio of these basic parameters will be called

<p>x D M=M 0I y D �=�0: (20.3)
</p>
<p>The variables in the two models are always considered functions of the relative mass
</p>
<p>variable � and may be called r; P; T; l (for M;�), and r 0; P 0; T 0; l 0 (for M 0; �0),
respectively. We try the following &ldquo;ansatz&rdquo;: for homologous mass values � (which

<p>We start with homologous main-sequence models. Since they evolve within the

<p>long nuclear timescale, one can use (10.2), neglecting the inertia term, as well as the

<p>time derivatives in the energy equation (10.3). Let us assume that in these two stars
</p>
<p>in complete equilibrium (hydrostatic and thermal) the energy transport is radiative.
</p>
<p>The basic equations to be fulfilled are then (10.1), (10.2), (10.4) and (10.16) together

<p>20.2 Applications to Simple Material Functions

<p>20.2.1 The Case ı D 0
</p>
<p>A special situation arises for the case that the density is independent of T; i.e.
</p>
<p>ı D 0 in (20.10). The equation of state then is polytropic, the polytropic index
being n D ˛=.1 � ˛/; and we must recover the typical properties of polytropic
stars (see Sect. 19.3). This can, in fact, be easily verified. To start with, the first two
</p>
<p>equations of system (20.13) (which represent the mechanical part) can be solved
</p>
<p>independently of the rest (the thermo-energetic part). For ı D 0we find from (20.15)
and (20.17) that A D .4˛ � 3/�1 and z1 D .2˛ � 1/=.4˛ � 3/. The first of (20.12)
gives for homologous stars of equal composition (y D 1) the mass-radius relation
</p>
<p>R �M z1 : (20.18)
</p>
<p>For a non-relativistic degenerate electron gas, one has ˛ D 3=5, which gives the
exponent z1 D �1=3 as already obtained in Sect. 19.6.
</p>
<p>20.2.2 The Case ˛ D ı D ' D 1; a D b D 0
</p>
<p>Further discussion of the above homology solutions will concentrate on the simplest
</p>
<p>case, an ideal gas (˛ D ı D ' D 1) with constant opacity (a D b D 0) [cf. (20.10)].
This extremely rough approximation to reality suffices for outlining some general
</p>
<p>properties of main-sequence stars (The assumption of homology introduces a much
</p>
<p>severer limitation on the results.).
</p>
<p>From (20.15)&ndash;(20.17), one finds

</p>
<p>t1 D 1 � z1; t2 D 1 � z2;
</p>
<p>s1 D 3; s2 D 4: (20.19)
</p>
<p>The first surprising result concerns the exponents of the luminosity, s1 and s2. In
</p>
<p>this simple case the square brackets in the equations for s1 and s2 in (20.15) and
</p>
<p>(20.16) vanish, and s1 and s2 become simple constant numbers. In particular, they
</p>
<p>are independent of � and �, i.e. of the special mode of energy generation. In fact
</p>
<p>the energy equation [giving the third of (20.13)] has no influence on the luminosity,
</p>
<p>which is determined by hydrostatic equilibrium, the equations of state, and radiative
</p>
<p>energy transfer only. The model has to adjust so that the energy sources (") provide</p>

The expression for t1 in (20.19) means that

<p>which simply reflects the virial theorem (thermal energy � potential energy). Of

<p>Tc �M 1�z1 ; %c �M 1�3z1 : (20.25)

<p>The values in Table 20.1 show that for increasingM;Tc increases relatively slowly,

<p>while %c decreases. This trend is especially pronounced for CNO burning, where
</p>
<p>Tc scarcely changes at all, typical variations being Tc � M 0:2 and %c � M�1:4

</p>
<p>20.2.3 The Role of the Equation of State
</p>
<p>The procedure by which the homology solutions were obtained shows that their
</p>
<p>existence rests entirely on the fact that the right-hand sides of (20.5) contain only
</p>
<p>products of the variables, but no sums. This property is destroyed if the material
</p>
<p>functions, instead of being products of powers of P and T , contain additive terms
</p>
<p>as is in general the case with the equation of state. The simplest example is the
</p>
<p>addition of radiation pressure to an ideal gas such that P D &lt;%T=� C aT 4=3:</p>

<p>No strict homology relations are then possible. But one can try to make rough
</p>
<p>approximations.
</p>
<p>One usually writes the corresponding equation of state as

<p>as that of � and we would find R � ˇz2 ; P � ˇp2 ; T � ˇt2 ; L � ˇs2 . In reality ˇ

</p>
<p>Now, ˇ is generally not constant inside a star [except for the polytrope n D 3
as treated in Sect. 19.5; compare with the identical relation (19.56)], but we can
</p>
<p>consider (20.28) as a relation betweenM and some kind of mean value of ˇ. One
</p>
<p>then sees that ˇ decreases strongly with M; i.e. the contribution of the radiation

<p>pressure to P increases with mass. Quite similarly we can write

</p>
<p>20.3 Homologous Contraction
</p>
<p>Now we briefly consider the homologous contraction. This may apply to a chemi-
</p>
<p>cally homogeneous star of given mass in hydrostatic equilibrium, if its radius is not
</p>
<p>fixed by an M�R relation but changes in time. Let us assume that consecutive
models are homologous to each other. An example in which this assumption is
</p>
<p>fulfilled is the contraction of a polytrope that does not change its polytropic index n:
</p>
<p>The solution of the Lane&ndash;Emden equation for given n yields the mass value m as
</p>
<p>a unique function of z only, where z is Emden&rsquo;s dimensionless radius variable, i.e.
</p>
<p>z � r=R (see Sect. 19.2). Therefore the mass elements remain at homologous points,
since their values of z do not change in time.
</p>
<p>Homologous mass shells (� = constant) are here simply those which have the
</p>
<p>same value of m; since the normalizing factor M remains constant. The radius of
</p>
<p>any such shell is supposed to change by a rate Pr D @r=@t . In two neighbouring
models, separated by a time interval �t , we have the values r and r 0 connected by
r 0 D r C Pr�t . This gives

</p>
<p>Simple Models in the U &ndash;V Plane
</p>
<p>There are stars in which the nuclear energy generation proceeding close to the centre
</p>
<p>creates such a high energy flux that the whole central region is convective. These
</p>
<p>stars can be described by models with a convective core and a radiative envelope.
</p>
<p>In later stages of stellar evolution the nuclear fuel in the central region of the star is
</p>
<p>exhausted and nuclear burning takes place only at the surface of a burned-out core.
</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances these models with shell burning can be described by
</p>
<p>a core that is isothermal, since no energy has to be transported there, and that is
</p>
<p>surrounded by a radiative envelope. In both cases a core solution of one type has to
</p>
<p>be fitted to an envelope solution of another type. In the following we shall deal with
</p>
<p>a classical fitting procedure which in the past was often used to construct models
</p>
<p>for such stars (see Schwarzschild 1958; Wrubel 1958) and which gives valuable
</p>
<p>insight into some of their general properties. Moreover, procedures like this can be
</p>
<p>helpful in certain special cases where the usual, iterative numerical methods are not
</p>
<p>practicable.
</p>
<p>21.1 The U &ndash;V Plane

</p>
<p>A solution which is regular in the stellar centre has the central valuesU D 3, V D 0,
as can easily be seen: a small sphere around the centre has the massm D 4�r3%c=3;
so that there U ! 3 and V � r2 ! 0. Near the surface the numerical value of U
becomes very small (as % does), as well as P=% .� T for the ideal gas or � %&#13;�1
for polytropes). Therefore V becomes very large.

<p>in the U &ndash;V plane spirals into the point U D 1, V D 2, which represents the
surface .z D 1). The spiral of the isothermal gaseous sphere unwinds and reaches
higher and higher values of V if degeneracy becomes important. In the limit case
</p>
<p>of complete non-relativistic degeneracy, the image curve approaches that of the
</p>
<p>polytrope n D 3=2 of Fig. 21.1.
The U &ndash;V plane has often been used to construct simple stellar models by
</p>
<p>fitting core and envelope solutions. Clearly this is most profitable when the core
</p>
<p>is polytropic with given index n and therefore all possible cores are represented by

<p>a single, known curve in the plane. This is the case for stars with convective cores

<p>The first equation has been integrated (the integration constant being chosen in such

<p>a way that y D t D 0 at the surface). This is used for eliminating y from (21.11)
and (21.12), which then give the second equation (21.15).
</p>
<p>The two ordinary differential equations (21.15) are integrated by separation of
</p>
<p>the variables. The solutions can be used near the surface down to a safe distance
</p>
<p>from the singularity. From there on the normal equations (21.11) and (21.12) can be

<p>numerically integrated inwards.

<p>Obviously one obtains a one-parameter set of solutions, the parameter being C .
</p>
<p>Three such envelope solutions in the U &ndash;V plane are shown in Fig. 21.3a. All of
</p>
<p>them come from the upper left and miss the central boundary condition (U D 3,

have to fit them to a core solution (compare also with Sect. 12.1). From (21.11) and

near the centre. In fact r is small near the surface and increases inwards until it
reaches the critical value rad (see Fig. 21.3b). Further inwards the Schwarzschild
criterion (6.13) requires convection and the radiative-envelope solutions are no

<p>21.3 Fitting of a Convective Core
</p>
<p>In order to obtain a model with a convective core inside a radiative envelopewe have
</p>
<p>to fit the solutions of Sect. 21.2 with a polytropic solution of n D 3=2 starting at the
centre (U D 3, V D 0). The fit has to be done at the point where the envelope</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.3 Fitting of a Convective Core 249
</p>
<p>solution reaches r D rad. Joining all these points on the different envelope
solutions (different C ) gives a line r D rad in the U &ndash;V plane, which intersects
the core polytrope at the fitting point U �; V �: The envelope solution through this
point has the value C D C �: Because of the condition that the gradient r is also
continuous there, the solutions for core and envelope are tangential to each other, as
</p>
<p>can be seen in Fig. 21.3a. At the fitting point the variables of the envelope solution
</p>
<p>may be q�; y�; x�; t�, while the core polytrope has the variables z�;w�.
Let us assume a certain value for the mean molecular weight � in the envelope.
</p>
<p>The fit has fixed C D C �; which according to (21.13) gives a relation between
L;R; andM: But L is determined by the energy generation in the core, for which

<p>the envelope solution (where l D constant was assumed).</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>250 21 Simple Models in the U &ndash;V Plane
</p>
<p>Models of this type were first constructed by Cowling (1935). They have the
</p>
<p>advantage that l appears in the structure equations only for the envelope where it is
</p>
<p>constant (D L).
</p>
<p>21.4 Fitting of an Isothermal Core
</p>
<p>In stellar evolution we shall have to discuss models with an isothermal helium core
</p>
<p>surrounded by a hydrogen-rich envelope. The luminosity is generated in a thin shell
</p>
<p>at the interface. This will be idealized by assuming a discontinuity of l (from 0 to L)
</p>
<p>at the interface.
</p>
<p>Let us discuss here a model in which � is continuous at the interface so that the
</p>
<p>image curve in the U &ndash;V plane is continuous at the fit.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 21.4 we have plotted envelope solutions together with the isothermal-
</p>
<p>core solution for an ideal gas. Along each envelope curve the value of q decreases
</p>
<p>inwards. We have also plotted some lines q D constant. As one can see from the
figure there are no fits possible with q &gt; qmax � 0:38, i.e. when more than 38% of
the total mass lies within the isothermal core. For given q &lt; qmax a fit is possible.
</p>
<p>An example for a fit at q � 0:3 is shown in Fig. 21.4. One can show that such
a fit determines a model completely for given M . Physically more realistic is a
</p>
<p>model in which � is higher in the core than in the envelope, which we idealize by
</p>
<p>a jump of � at the interface. Then the curve in the U � V plane is discontinuous,
fulfilling the conditions (21.7) at the interface (�1 &gt; �2). If one tries to fit core
</p>
<p>and envelope with this condition, and say �1=�2 D 1:333=0:62, one finds that qmax
is considerably smaller: no fits are possible at q &gt; qmax � 0:1. This gives the
Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar limit for isothermal cores consisting of an ideal gas (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 30.5) enclosed by the stellar envelope.</p>

<p>Chapter 22
</p>
<p>The Zero-Age Main Sequence
</p>
<p>We consider here a sequence of chemically homogeneous models in complete
</p>
<p>(mechanical and thermal) equilibrium with central hydrogen burning. All of them
</p>
<p>are composed of the same hydrogen-rich mixture, while the stellar mass M varies
</p>
<p>from model to model along the sequence.
</p>
<p>These models can represent very young stars which have just formed from the
</p>
<p>interstellar medium, and in which the foregoing contraction (see Chap. 28) has
</p>
<p>raised the central temperature so far that hydrogen burning has started. This provides
</p>
<p>a long-lasting energy source, and consequently the stars change only on the very
</p>
<p>long nuclear timescale �n. Within the much shorter Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz timescale
</p>
<p>(see Sect. 3.3), the stars will &ldquo;forget&rdquo; the details of their thermal history long before
</p>
<p>the nuclear reactions have noticeably modified the composition. The only nuclear
</p>
<p>changes that have taken place during the previous phase are the burning of the
</p>
<p>light elements deuterium, lithium, beryllium and boron in the largest part of the
</p>
<p>star, and the conversion of carbon to nitrogen in the centre. The latter reactions
</p>
<p>consume approximately 1% of the protons in the stellar core; the former ones are
</p>
<p>orders of magnitude less important due to the very low abundances of the mentioned
</p>
<p>elements. This is why one can reasonably treat them as homogeneous models in
</p>
<p>thermal equilibrium. The now-beginning evolution, in which hydrogen is slowly
</p>
<p>consumed in the stellar core, has such a long duration that most visible stars are
</p>
<p>presently found in this phase. Our homogeneous models define its very beginning,
</p>
<p>and their sequence is therefore more precisely called the zero-age main sequence
</p>
<p>(ZAMS), since one usually counts the age of a star from this point on.
</p>
<p>22.1 Surface Values

<p>Homogeneous, hydrogen-burning equilibrium models can be very easily calculated

<p>several masses between 0.1

</p>
<p>elements amount only to 0:02 of the mass.1 This is a chemical composition typical
</p>
<p>for the younger population of stars found in the spiral arms of the Milky Way. The
</p>
<p>metallicity Z is slightly higher than that of the Sun.
</p>
<p>Figure 22.1 shows the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram for the models in the wide
</p>
<p>range of stellar masses from 0.1Mˇ to more than 50Mˇ: L and Teff increase
with increasing M , thus forming the ZAMS, which coincides more or less with
</p>
<p>the lower border of the observed main-sequence band. The slope of the ZAMS
</p>
<p>below � 0:6Mˇ depends sensitively on the equation of state, the opacities, and
the atmospheric boundary conditions.
</p>
<p>The important mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations for these models are
</p>
<p>shown in Figs. 22.2 and 22.3 by the solid lines. In both cases they should constitute
</p>
<p>a lower envelope to the distribution of stars, since radius as well as luminosity
</p>
<p>are increasing during the main-sequence evolution and mass remains constant or
</p>
<p>decreases slightly. Those objects in Fig. 22.2 clearly detached from the bulk of
</p>
<p>objects are stars that have already developed off the main sequence and therefore
</p>
<p>have considerably larger radii. Note the very good agreement with theory, although
</p>
<p>the stars shown do not have identical composition and, in particular, not exactly
</p>
<p>that of the models. Points below the theoretical sequence may also be due to
</p>
<p>measurement errors. As predicted already by the simple homology relations for
</p>
<p>main sequence models [see (20.20) and (20.21)], R increases slowly, and L

<p>1Note that we will also use the notation X , Y , and Z for the mass fractions of hydrogen,

</p>
<p>From the slopes of the curve in Fig. 22.2 we find roughly � D 0:56 and 0.79 in the
upper and lower mass ranges, respectively. In the range of small values ofM , there
</p>
<p>is a pronounced maximum of the slope aroundM D 1Mˇ, indicating a remarkable
deviation from homologous behaviour in this range. With decreasing effective
</p>
<p>temperature these models have outer convective zones of strongly increasing
</p>
<p>extension (cf. Sects. 11.3.2, 11.3.3 and Fig. 22.7). This tends to decrease R, in
</p>
<p>addition to other effects.
</p>
<p>Also the slope of the M � L relation in Fig. 22.3 varies with M . Over the
whole mass range plotted, the average of � is about 3.37. For M D 1 : : : 10Mˇ
the average exponent is 3.89, while in the larger range M D 1 : : : 50Mˇ it is
3.35. The decreasing slope towards largerM is an effect of the increasing radiation
</p>
<p>pressure (see below and Sect. 20.2.3).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>254 22 The Zero-Age Main Sequence
</p>
<p>Let us consider the way in which the variation of the exponents � and � influences
</p>
<p>the slope of the main sequence in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram. EliminatingM
</p>
<p>from the two relations (22.1), we find immediately that
</p>
<p>R � L�=n : (22.2)
</p>
<p>We introduce this into the relation L � R2T 4eff and obtain for the main sequence in
the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram the proportionality
</p>
<p>L � T �eff; � D
4
</p>
<p>1 � 2�=� : (22.3)
</p>
<p>We have seen that for large stellar masses, � decreases and � remains about constant
</p>
<p>with further increasingM: Equation (22.3) then gives an increase of �, which means
</p>
<p>that the main sequence must become gradually steeper towards high luminosities.
</p>
<p>We should mention that these two relations belong to the rare instances for which
</p>
<p>a reasonable quantitative test of the theory is possible. Even here one is rather
</p>
<p>restricted, since it is extremely difficult to obtain sufficiently precise measurements
</p>
<p>of R;L; and M . From this point of view, the M � R relation should be the
more reliable one. In Figs. 22.2 and 22.3 a selection of the best observed main-
</p>
<p>sequence double stars are plotted (Andersen 1991; Malkov et al. 2006). When
</p>
<p>comparing the scattering in the two diagrams one should note that Fig. 22.3 has
</p>
<p>an appreciably more compressed ordinate. The theoretical curves map out roughly
</p>
<p>the lower border of the measured values. They would be shifted slightly upwards,
</p>
<p>for example, by the assumption of a smaller hydrogen content. However, we have
</p>
<p>compared zero-age main-sequence stars with real stars of varying composition
</p>
<p>here. In view of the uncertainties and difficulties involved in theory as well as in
</p>
<p>observation, one can scarcely expect a better fit, particularly when considering the
</p>
<p>enormous range of values involved (a factor 250 inM , nearly 8 powers of 10 in L).
</p>
<p>22.2 Interior Solutions
</p>
<p>The behaviour of the interior may be illustrated by characteristic variables as
</p>
<p>functions of m=M . They are plotted in Fig. 22.4 for two stellar masses in order
</p>
<p>to demonstrate typical dependencies of the solutions onM .
</p>
<p>The density % (Fig. 22.4a) increases appreciably towards the centre where we
</p>
<p>have %c � 102 g cm�3 for 1 Mˇ, i.e. roughly a factor 109 larger than in the
photosphere. For 10Mˇ, the central density is smaller by more than a factor 10.
The inward increase of % indicates a very strong concentration of the mass elements
</p>
<p>towards the centre, illustrated in Fig. 22.4b. For 1Mˇ; the inner 30% of the radius
(i.e. only 3% of the total volume) contains 50% of the mass; and in the outer 50%
</p>
<p>of R (i.e. 88% of the volume) only about 15% ofM can be found.</p>

<p>The temperature (Fig. 22.4c) also increases towards the centre. For 1 Mˇ, the
central value of 1:36 � 107 K is a factor 2,400 larger than the photospheric value.
Values of T &gt; 3 � 106K extend to m � 0:95M , so that the average T value
(averaged over the mass elements) is roughly 7:7 � 106 K. In a 10Mˇ star, T has
slightly more than twice the values of corresponding mass elements for 1Mˇ.
</p>
<p>The behaviour of T is necessarily reflected by that of the rate of energy
</p>
<p>generation due to hydrogen burning (Fig. 22.4d). The dependence of " on T
</p>
<p>(cf. Sect. 18.5.1), together with the T gradient, yields a strong decrease of " from the

<p>centre outwards. In the 1Mˇ star, " has dropped by a factor 102 from the centre to
m D 0:6M , and still further outward it is quite negligible. This is particularly well

<p>Tc D 3 � 107 K, the dominant energy source is the CNO cycle (instead of the pp
chain in 1Mˇ). The much larger T dependence of " gives an even more pronounced
concentration of " towards the centre (Fig. 22.4d). In the innermost 30% of M; "
</p>
<p>drops by about a factor 103 (as compared to a factor 10 in the same interval of
</p>
<p>1Mˇ). This corresponds to an " with an exponent of T roughly three times larger.
Further outwards, where T is low enough for the pp chain to dominate, the slope of
</p>
<p>" becomes the same in both stars. In the 10Mˇ star, 90% of the total luminosity is
generated within the innermost 10% of the mass (Fig. 22.4e).
</p>
<p>We have seen that in spite of all similarities there are characteristic differences
</p>
<p>between the interior solutions for different values ofM . Some of these can be found
</p>
<p>in the plot of the central values of temperature and density (Fig. 22.5). This diagram
</p>
<p>exhibits at least qualitatively another prediction of the homology considerations
</p>
<p>in Chap. 20: with increasing M , there is a slight increase of Tc together with a
</p>
<p>substantial decrease of %c. Between M D 2Mˇ and 50Mˇ the differences are
� lgTc D C0:28 and � lg%c D �1:43. The striking change of the curve around
1:3Mˇ is a direct consequence of the transition from the CNO cycle to the pp-
chains as the dominating energy source. AtM D 1:4Mˇ, the CNO cylce dominates
at the centre, which reaches the critical temperature of lgTc D 7:25 (Fig. 18.8),
while atM D 1:9Mˇ the pp-contribution to the total energy production has fallen
below 50% (see also Fig. 22.6). From the homology relations (20.25) and Table 20.1

<p>certainly influence the centre, since they have a less pronouncedmass concentration
</p>
<p>than radiative regions. Note that both flat parts of the Tc � %c curve in Fig. 22.5
belong to models in which the central part is convective (cf. Fig. 22.7). At the lowest
</p>
<p>masses the stars are fully convective and follow the relations for a polytrope of index
</p>
<p>n D 3=2 (Chap. 19 and Sect. 24.2).
In the upper range of masses degeneracy is negligible, while it becomes increas-
</p>
<p>ingly important towards smallerM owing to the increasing density. Below 0.5Mˇ,
say, other deviations from the ideal gas approximation also become important in the
</p>
<p>equation of state, for example, electrostatic interaction between the ions.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the radiation pressure Prad must increase towards larger M
</p>
<p>owing to the increasing T , since Prad � T 4. At M D 1Mˇ, radiation contributes
only the negligible fraction of a few 10�4 to the total central pressure. This fraction
becomes about 1% at 4Mˇ, while in the centre of the 50Mˇ star, Prad contributes
no less than 1/3 to the total pressure (see Fig. 22.5).
</p>
<p>Another effect of the growing Tc, which also occurs around 1 Mˇ, is the
transition from the pp chain to the CNO cycle as the dominant energy source
</p>
<p>(compare also Fig. 18.8). For models in the transition region from M D 1 Mˇ
to 3 Mˇ, Fig. 22.6 shows the contribution of "CNO to the local energy generation
rate as a function of l=L. The integral over such a curve gives the fraction of L due
</p>
<p>to burning in the CNO cycle. This amounts only to a few percent forM D 1:2Mˇ.
In the 1:6Mˇ star, the CNO cycle already contributes 65% at the centre, and nearly
one half of the total luminosity. It clearly dominates the whole energy generation
</p>
<p>for 1:8Mˇ and more massive stars.</p>

<p>258 22 The Zero-Age Main Sequence
</p>
<p>22.3 Convective Regions
</p>
<p>Knowledge of the extension of convective regions is very important in view of their
</p>
<p>influence on the ensuing chemical evolution. A rough overview can be obtained
</p>
<p>from Fig. 22.7, wherem=M and lgM=Mˇ are ordinate and abscissa. For any given
stellar mass M along a line parallel to the ordinate it is indicated what conditions
</p>
<p>we would encounter when drilling a radial borehole from the surface to the centre.
</p>
<p>In particular, one can see whether the corresponding mass elements are convective
</p>
<p>or radiative. Aside from the stars of smallest mass (M &lt; 0:25Mˇ), we can roughly
distinguish between two types of model:
</p>
<p>convective coreC radiative envelope (upper main sequence);
</p>
<p>radiative coreC convective envelope (lower main sequence).
</p>
<p>The transition from one type to the other again occurs nearM D 1Mˇ.
The distinction between convective and radiative regions is made here by
</p>
<p>using the Schwarzschild criterion (see Sect. 6.1), which predicts convection if the
</p>
<p>radiative gradient of temperature rrad exceeds the adiabatic gradient rad (The
gradient r� of the molecular weight appearing in the Ledoux criterion is zero
in these homogeneous models. Possible effects of overshooting will be discussed
</p>
<p>in Chap. 30.). The variation of these gradients (together with that of the actual
</p>
<p>gradient r) throughout the star is plotted in Fig. 22.8 for M D 1Mˇ and 10Mˇ.
For the abscissa, lg T is chosen, since this conveniently stretches the scale in the
</p>
<p>complicated outer layers.
</p>
<p>Let us start with the simpler situation concerning the convective core. When
</p>
<p>comparing Fig. 22.8a, b, we see that the convective core in the more massive models
</p>
<p>is caused by a steep increase of rrad towards the centre. The reason for this is that
the dominating CNO cycle , with its extreme temperature sensitivity, concentrates
</p>
<p>the energy production very much towards the centre (cf. the curve l=L D 0:5 in
Fig. 22.7, and Fig. 22.4e). Therefore we find in these stars very high fluxes of energy
</p>
<p>(l=4�r2) at small r , which produce large values of rrad. Figure 22.7 shows a
remarkable increase in the extent of the convective core for increasingM . The core
</p>
<p>covers as much as 65% of the stellar mass in a star of 50Mˇ, an increase caused by
the increasing radiation pressure (cf. Sect. 22.2 and Fig. 22.5), which depresses the
</p>
<p>value of rad well below its standard value of 0.4 for an ideal monatomic gas [see
(13.12)]. In the centre of the 50Mˇ model, roughly 1/3 of P is radiation pressure,
and rad � 0:27. From Fig. 22.8b it is clear that a depression of rad in the central
region will shift the intersection with rrad (i.e. the border of the convective core)
outwards to smaller T . When we increase M to much larger values still, the top
</p>
<p>of the convective core will finally approach the surface such that we should obtain
</p>
<p>fully convective stars. We then approach models of the so-called supermassive stars
</p>
<p>(see Sect. 19.10).</p>
<p/>

<p>22.3 Convective Regions 259
</p>
<p>Fig. 22.7 The mass values m from centre to surface are plotted against the stellar mass M for
</p>
<p>the same zero-age main-sequence models as in Fig. 22.1. &ldquo;Cloudy&rdquo; areas indicate the extension of
</p>
<p>convective zones inside the models. Two solid lines give them values at which r is 1/4 and 1/2 the
</p>
<p>total radius R: The dashed and dotted lines show the mass elements inside which 50% and 90%
</p>
<p>of the total luminosity L are produced
</p>
<p>Fig. 22.8 The grey solid lines show the actual temperature gradient r D d lnT=d lnP over the
temperature T (in K) inside two zero-age main-sequence models of 1Mˇ (left panel) and 10Mˇ
(right panel). The corresponding adiabatic gradientsrad (dotted lines) and radiative gradients rrad
(dashed lines) are also plotted, and the location of the ionization zones of hydrogen and helium are
</p>
<p>indicated (arrows). The chemical composition of the models is the same as for those of Fig. 22.1
</p>
<p>In less massive stars, the pp chain with its smaller temperature sensitivity
</p>
<p>dominates. This distributes the energy production over a much larger area, so that the
</p>
<p>flux and rrad are much smaller in the central region, which thus remains radiative.
Outer convective envelopes can generally be expected to occur in stars of low
</p>
<p>effective temperature, as the discussion of the boundary conditions in Sect. 11.3.2
</p>
<p>has already shown. When studying the different gradients in the outer layers of
</p>
<p>cool stars (Fig. 22.8a), one finds a variety of complicated details. The variation
</p>
<p>of rad clearly shows depressions in those regions where the most abundant</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>260 22 The Zero-Age Main Sequence
</p>
<p>elements, hydrogen (T &amp; 104 K) and helium (T � 105 K), are partially ionized
(see Chap. 14). The most striking feature is thatrrad reaches enormous values (more
than 105/. This is due to the large opacity �, which here increases by several powers
</p>
<p>of 10 (cf. Chap. 17). Therefore the Schwarzschild criterion indicates convective
</p>
<p>instability: the models have an outer convective zone. In the largest part of it,
</p>
<p>the density is so high that convection is very effective and the actual gradient r
is close to rad. Convective transport becomes ineffective only in the outermost,
superadiabatic part, where r is clearly above rad. Scarcely anything of all these
features appears in the hot envelope of the 10Mˇ star (Fig. 22.8b). rrad remains
nearly at the same level; even the photosphere is too hot for hydrogen to be neutral,
</p>
<p>and only the small dip from the second He ionization is seen immediately below
</p>
<p>the photosphere. This causes such a shallow zone with convective instability that
</p>
<p>only for special cases, depending on the detailed chemical composition, convective
</p>
<p>motions set it.
</p>
<p>The outer convection zone gradually penetrates deeper into the star with decreas-
</p>
<p>ing Teff. Its lower border finally reaches the centre at M . 0:25Mˇ (left end
of Fig. 22.7), such that the main-sequence stars of even smaller masses are fully
</p>
<p>convective.
</p>
<p>22.4 Extreme Values of M
</p>
<p>The ZAMS ends at extreme low and high mass values. Only in recent years
</p>
<p>detailed calculations for main-sequence stars of very lowM have become available.
</p>
<p>The difficulties of modelling them lie in particular in the fact that the input
</p>
<p>physics is complicated and the available data not very reliable. This concerns the
</p>
<p>notorious problem of the treatment of convection, as well as the opacity values
</p>
<p>for mixtures containing many molecules. Both these effects are important in very
</p>
<p>cool envelopes. Complications for the interior structure are equally severe. They
</p>
<p>arise, for example, from the difficult treatment of particle interaction in the low-
</p>
<p>temperature high-density regime and influence the equation of state and the electron
</p>
<p>screening of nuclear reactions. Progress has been made in the equation of state
</p>
<p>under such conditions (Sect. 16.6), in the treatment of the opacities (Sect. 17.8) and
</p>
<p>the calculation of the atmospheric structure. The latter is very important since stars
</p>
<p>below� 0:2Mˇ are fully convective (Fig. 22.7) and their interior structure therefore
depends very much on the outer boundary conditions (Fig. 11.2).
</p>
<p>Quite another problem concerns the relevance of the calculated equilibrium
</p>
<p>models for real, evolving stars. At the low central temperatures in models of
</p>
<p>extremely small masses, for example, the time for reaching equilibrium burning
</p>
<p>can become exceedingly long. A preceding phase in which the original 3He is
</p>
<p>burned may be at least equally important, but this 3He content is very uncertain.
</p>
<p>And below about M D 0:1Mˇ, even the original contraction leads so far into
electron degeneracy that hydrogen burning is no longer ignited (refer to Chap. 28).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.5 The Eddington Luminosity 261
</p>
<p>In this sense one may speak of the &ldquo;lower end of the main sequence&rdquo; at this
</p>
<p>mass value. Disregarding this evolutionary argument, however, one can ask whether
</p>
<p>solutions for main-sequence models (homogeneous, hydrogen burning, complete
</p>
<p>equilibrium) exist down to arbitrary small values ofM: It turns out that such models
</p>
<p>end to exist at M � 0:08Mˇ. Real stars simply fail to provide all the luminosity
from nuclear burning alone and need thermal energies to supply the rest of the
</p>
<p>energy. Such objects are called brown dwarfs and are no longer considered as
</p>
<p>&ldquo;real stars&rdquo;. Details about very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, their physical
</p>
<p>properties and how they are modelled, can be found in the review by Chabrier and
</p>
<p>Baraffe (2000). Although they are extremely faint, they are now routinely found
</p>
<p>with large telescopes. A decisive test to confirm that a &ldquo;star&rdquo; is indeed a brown
</p>
<p>dwarf is the lithium test: going down in mass along the main sequence, stars become
</p>
<p>fully convective. Any change in element abundances due to hydrogen burning is
</p>
<p>therefore reflected in the surface abundances. This includes lithium, which, as part
</p>
<p>of the pp2 chain (18.62), is destroyed due to proton captures at temperatures above
</p>
<p>�2:5 � 106 K. Its surface abundance is therefore very low on the lower main
sequence, as it is almost completely destroyed throughout the star. If the mass is
</p>
<p>however low enough such that the critical temperature is not reached even at the
</p>
<p>centre, lithium can survive and &ldquo;reappears&rdquo; for the very faintest main-sequence
</p>
<p>stars. The mass at which such low central temperatures are reached is � 0:06Mˇ,
which is lower than the 0:08Mˇ, which denotes the transition from stars to brown
dwarfs. The lithium test has lead to the first definite detection of brown dwarfs.
</p>
<p>In the direction towards largeM , on the other hand, the sequence of equilibrium
</p>
<p>models can principally be continued up to the &ldquo;supermassive&rdquo; stars (see Sect. 19.10).
</p>
<p>Long before they are reached, however, an instability occurs which sets in between
</p>
<p>M � 60 and 100Mˇ (depending on the composition). It is a vibrational instability
caused by the so-called " mechanism (see Sect. 41.5) and supported by the large
</p>
<p>amount of radiation pressure. Such stars, instead of sitting quietly at their proper
</p>
<p>place on the main sequence, will start to oscillate with growing amplitude. This
</p>
<p>may go so far as to throw off matter from the surface, until the mass is reduced
</p>
<p>below the critical value for the instability.
</p>
<p>22.5 The Eddington Luminosity
</p>
<p>For massive, hot stars there exists another physical limit for hydrostatic stabil-
</p>

</p>
<p>Other Main Sequences
</p>
<p>The simplicity and the importance of the results obtained for the main sequence
</p>
<p>suggest the extension of this concept to stars of quite different composition. We
</p>
<p>can then describe a main sequence as any sequence of homogeneous models with
</p>
<p>various massesM in complete equilibrium, consisting (mainly) of a certain element
</p>
<p>which burns in the central region. In this sense, the (normal) main sequence as
</p>
<p>treated before is a special case and is more precisely called the hydrogen main
</p>
<p>sequence (H-MS). In a further step of generalization, we will even drop the
</p>
<p>assumption of chemical homogeneity, thus arriving at the so-called generalized
</p>
<p>main sequences (GMS) (Sect. 23.3). Of course, compared with the H-MS, the other
</p>
<p>sequences are far less important for real, observed stars. But their properties yield
</p>
<p>valuable information for understanding certain types of evolved stars, for example.
</p>
<p>The numerical models shown in this chapter have been calculated with an older
</p>
<p>equation of state and simpler opacities. Also, the chemical composition for the
</p>
<p>hydrogen-rich models differs from that used in the last chapter and is for a slightly
</p>
<p>higher (D 0:021) metallicity. But since we will discuss fundamental properties of
stars in this section, these details are of no relevance.
</p>
<p>23.1 The HeliumMain Sequence
</p>
<p>The helium main sequence (He-MS) contains chemically homogeneous equilibrium
</p>
<p>models that consist almost completely of He (with the usual few per cent of heavier
</p>
<p>elements) and have central helium burning. In principle, one could imagine them
</p>
<p>to be the descendants of perfectly mixed hydrogen-burning stars (however, perfect
</p>
<p>mixing during evolution is very improbable). Or they may represent the remnants
</p>
<p>of originally more massive stars that have developed a central helium core and then
</p>
<p>lost their hydrogen-rich envelope.
</p>
<p>In the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram (Fig. 23.1) the He-MS is situated far to the
</p>
<p>left of the (normal) H-MS at fairly high luminosities. If we compare the same stellar

</p>
<p>sequence (H-MS; XH D 0:685; XHe D 0:294), the helium main sequence (He-MS; XH D 0,
XHe D 0:979), and the carbon main sequence (C-MS; XH D XHe D 0; XC D XO D 0:497). The
labels along the sequences give stellar massesM (in units ofMˇ). Three lines of constant stellar
</p>
<p>radius (R in units of Rˇ) are plotted (dashed)
</p>
<p>massM on each sequence, we see that the helium stars have smaller radii and much
</p>
<p>higher luminosities. The remarkable difference in L for given M is particularly
</p>
<p>well illustrated by the M � L relations in Fig. 23.2. The main cause is certainly
the difference in the mean molecular weight �, which is 0.624 for the mixture used
</p>
<p>for the stars on the H-MS and 1.343 for the helium stars. If everything else were the
</p>
<p>same and the models were homologous, then we would expect from (20.20) for stars
</p>
<p>with the same M a difference in luminosity given by � lgL D 4� lg� D 1:33.
This is in fact very nearly the shift between the twoM � L relations in Fig. 23.2 at
M D 10Mˇ, while forM D 1Mˇ, we even have � lgL � 2:5.
</p>
<p>The interior structure resembles roughly that of models on the upper H-MS.
</p>
<p>The extreme temperature sensitivity of helium burning concentrates the energy
</p>
<p>production into a small central sphere where the large energy flux produces a
</p>
<p>convective core. This contains about 0:27M in the 1Mˇ star, and nearly 0.7M for
10Mˇ. The increase of the convective core is again a consequence of the increasing
radiation pressure: it contributes 1.5% to the total pressure in the centre of the 1Mˇ
star, 18% for 5Mˇ, and 32% for 10Mˇ, which is very much more than for the
corresponding stars on the H-MS (6 � 10�4, 0.018, and 0.063, respectively). The
difference is due to the fact that helium burning requires temperatures roughly six
</p>
<p>times higher, as can be seen in Fig. 23.3, which shows the central values of T and %.
</p>
<p>The high radiation pressure provides relatively large amplitudes of pulsation in the
</p>
<p>central region. This again produces a vibrational instability due to the " mechanism,</p>

sequence of stable helium-burning stars to terminate at aboutM � 0:3Mˇ.
</p>
<p>23.2 The Carbon Main Sequence
</p>
<p>The next major step in the nuclear history of a star is carbon burning. Thus, we
</p>
<p>now consider a carbon main sequence (C-MS) consisting of homogeneous models
</p>
<p>in complete equilibrium that have central carbon burning. Except for the usual
</p>
<p>admixture of a few per cent of heavy elements, the composition can be either pure
12C, or a mixture of 12C and 16O in equal amounts, which represents roughly the
</p>
<p>end products of stellar helium burning (For both assumptions the basic results, in
</p>
<p>particular the luminosities, are not too different, since the molecular weights are
</p>
<p>nearly the same.). The models of the C-MS are not so much used for describing
</p>
<p>homogeneous carbon stars, but rather for the purpose of surveying carbon-burning
</p>
<p>cores in highly evolved stars.
</p>
<p>In the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram (Fig. 23.1) the C-MS is at Teff &gt; 10
5 K even
</p>
<p>to the left of the He-MS. For equal masses, models on the C-MS have remarkably
</p>
<p>smaller R and larger L. The M � L relation for carbon stars is � lgL � 0:5
above that for helium stars (Fig. 23.2) because of the larger mean molecular weight
</p>
<p>(� lg� � 0:11).
The interior solutions of carbon stars have similar properties to those of the
</p>
<p>helium stars, for example, large convective cores and an appreciable amount of
</p>
<p>radiation pressure. In a model of M D 3:5Mˇ, the convective core encompasses
about 45% of the total mass, and the radiation pressure contributes more than 20%
</p>
<p>to the central pressure. Figure 23.3 shows that, according to the requirements of
</p>
<p>carbon burning, the central temperatures are between 5 and 8�108K. But the central
density is even more increased compared to helium stars. Therefore appreciable
</p>
<p>degeneracy of the electron gas is already found in carbon stars around 1Mˇ. And
the sequence of stars with a stable carbon burning terminates at masses in the range
</p>
<p>M � 0:9 : : : 0:8Mˇ. The exact value of this limiting mass depends somewhat on
the assumptions in the physical parameters. A well-known uncertainty comes, for
</p>
<p>example, from neutrino losses, which can become noticeable in these very hot and
</p>
<p>dense stars (Sect. 18.7). Large neutrino losses have the tendency to increase the
</p>
<p>lower limit ofM for stable carbon burning. Figure 23.3 shows that in all three main
</p>
<p>sequences the limiting mass occurs at roughly the same degree of degeneracy of the
</p>
<p>electron gas ( � 4:5). The C-MS and the He-MS have a much simpler structure
than the H-MS, which is affected by the complications occurring near 1Mˇ, namely
the transition from convective to radiative cores and the growth of outer convection

<p>zones with decreasing Teff.</p>

</p>
<p>23.3 Generalized Main Sequences
</p>
<p>The logical next step in extending the concept of main sequences is to drop the
</p>
<p>condition of chemical homogeneity. This is suggested by the chemical evolution we
</p>
<p>encounter in all stars: the conversion of hydrogen to helium by nuclear reactions
</p>
<p>(which are concentrated towards the centre) produces a central helium core, while
</p>
<p>the outer envelope retains its original hydrogen-richmixture. If the temperatures are
</p>
<p>high enough, helium burning will occur around the centre, and hydrogen burning
</p>
<p>continues in a so-called shell source, i.e. a concentric shell starting at the bottom
</p>
<p>of the hydrogen-rich envelope. Based on this picture, different types of significant
</p>
<p>sequences may be defined. We will limit ourselves in the following to the simplest
</p>
<p>case, which nevertheless finds useful applications.
</p>
<p>For these generalized main sequences (GMS), we consider models in complete
</p>
<p>equilibrium, with a chemical profile as shown in Fig. 23.4: a central helium core
</p>
<p>of massMHe, i.e. of the mass fraction q0 D MHe=M; is surrounded by an envelope
of mass .1 � q0/M with the usual hydrogen-rich mixture of unevolved stars. At
the interface of the two regions, the hydrogen content XH changes discontinuously
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;step profile&rdquo;), while the hydrogen content in the envelope as well as the small
</p>
<p>admixture of heavier elements in both regions is assumed to be fixed at some
</p>
<p>reasonable values. The energy is supplied by central helium burning and (possibly)
</p>
<p>by an additional hydrogen burning in a shell source at q0.
</p>
<p>Each of these models is characterized by two parameters, the stellar massM , and
</p>
<p>the relative core mass q0. We then obtain a generalized main sequence by keeping
</p>
<p>q0 constant and varyingM as a parameter. For each value of q0 there is one GMS.
</p>
<p>In the evolution the value of q0 is not constant: q0 can slowly increase because of
</p>
<p>the shell source burning, and it can increase by mass loss from the surface. We will
</p>
<p>therefore consider GMS of various values of q0.
</p>
<p>The upper limit is obviously q0 D 1, implying that the &ldquo;core&rdquo; encompasses the
whole star, which is then a homogeneous helium star. The GMS for q0 D 1 is
therefore identical with the well-known He-MS discussed in Sect. 23.1.
</p>
<p>For values of q0 slightly below 1, the GMS are shifted appreciably to the right in
</p>
<p>the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram (Fig. 23.5). They have already passed the H-MS
</p>
<p>for q0 � 0:9 : : : 0:85, depending on the value ofM . In other words, the addition of a
relatively small hydrogen-rich layer on top of a helium star will remarkably increase
</p>
<p>its radius and decrease Teff.
</p>
<p>This behaviour changes completely if q0 drops below a certain value, which
</p>
<p>is about 0:8 : : : 0:7, depending on M . Figure 23.5 shows that the GMS are then
</p>
<p>compressed towards a limiting line far to the right-hand side of the Hertzsprung&ndash;
</p>
<p>Russell diagram. This will turn out to be the Hayashi line, a limit for all stars in
</p>
<p>hydrostatic equilibrium (Chap. 24). The closest approach to it is found roughly for
</p>
<p>the GMS with q0 D 0:5. For even smaller q0, the GMS move slowly back to the
left in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram. We conclude that the upper part of this
</p>
<p>diagram can be covered at least once by these GMS, i.e. by very simple equilibrium
</p>
<p>models depending on two parameters (M;q0) only.</p>

sequences plotted here cover only the range from q0 D 1 (helium main sequence) to q0 D 0:2. For
comparison, the limiting case of the hydrogen main sequence (q0 D 0, dashed) is shown. Models
with a stellar massM D 5 (inMˇ) are indicated by solid dots, M D 2 by open circles, M D 1
by triangles, andM D 0:5 by squares (After Giannone et al. 1968)
</p>
<p>Let us compare models with the same M on different GMS. If we connect
</p>
<p>their points in Fig. 23.5, we obtain curves such as those plotted in Fig. 23.6 for
</p>
<p>two values of M . This shows that the luminosity remains roughly constant in
</p>
<p>the range q0 D 1 : : : 0:7. This is caused by two opposite effects nearly cancelling
each other: when we decrease q0 at M D constant,MHe decreases, which reduces
the luminosity of the core, LHe; approximately as given by theM � L relation for
the He-MS (Fig. 23.2, if here we takeMHe forM ). At the same rate, the mass of the</p>

</p>
<p>envelopeM.1 � q0/ increases, which gives an increasing energy production LH of
the hydrogen shell source, such that the total luminosity L D LHe CLH can remain
almost constant. The situation changes when q0 drops below, say, 0.7. The &ldquo;helium
</p>
<p>luminosity&rdquo; LHe then decreases so strongly that it is compensated no longer by the
</p>
<p>increase of LH, which eventually dominates L completely.
</p>
<p>Not only the cases q0 D 0 and q0 D 1which give the ZAMS and the heliummain
sequence, but also the cases in between sometimes give insight how stars behave,
</p>
<p>for instance, in the case where in a close binary system mass flows from one star to
</p>
<p>its companion. If a primary of, say, one solar mass evolves it forms a helium core, so
</p>
<p>it resembles a star on a generalized main sequence with a certain value of q0. While
</p>
<p>the evolution goes on q0 grows while simultaneously the star becomes a red giant.
</p>
<p>If before the onset of helium burning the surface of it comes close to the companion
</p>
<p>(to be more precise: when it fills the Roche lobe), mass flows from the red giant
</p>
<p>onto the surface of the still unevolved secondary until only the helium core is left
</p>
<p>and the original primary after thermal adjustment has become a star of the helium
</p>
<p>main sequence. In the HR diagram the star has moved from the Red Giant branch to
</p>
<p>the helium main sequence while its value of q0 has grown during the mass loss.</p>

</p>
<p>The Hayashi Line
</p>
<p>We have seen that convection can occur in quite different regions of a star. In this
</p>
<p>section we consider the limiting case of fully convective stars, i.e. stars which
</p>
<p>are convective in the whole interior from centre to photosphere, while only the
</p>
<p>atmosphere remains radiative.
</p>
<p>The Hayashi line (HL) is defined as the locus in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell
</p>
<p>diagram of fully convective stars of given parameters (mass M and chemical
</p>
<p>composition). Note that for each set of the parameters, such as mass or chemical
</p>
<p>composition, there is a separate Hayashi line. These lines are located far to the right
</p>
<p>in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram, typically at Teff � 3; 000 : : : 5; 000K, and they
are very steep, in large parts almost vertical.
</p>
<p>From the foregoing definition one may not immediately realize the importance of
</p>
<p>this line. However, the HL also represents a borderline between an &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; region
</p>
<p>(on its left) and a &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; region (on its right) in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell
</p>
<p>diagram for all stars with these parameters, provided that they are in hydrostatic
</p>
<p>equilibrium and have a fully adjusted convection. The latter means that, at any
</p>
<p>time, the convective elements have the properties (for instance the average velocity)
</p>
<p>required by the mixing-length theory. Changes in time of the large-scale quantities
</p>
<p>of the stars are supposed to be slow enough for the convection to have time to adjust
</p>
<p>to the new situation; otherwise one would have to use a theory of time-dependent
</p>
<p>convection. Since hydrostatic and convective adjustment are very rapid, stars could
</p>
<p>survive on the right-hand side of the HL only for a very short time.
</p>
<p>In addition, parts of the early evolutionary tracks of certain stars may come close
</p>
<p>to, or even coincide with, the HL. It is certainly significant for the later evolution of
</p>
<p>stars, which is clearly reflected by observed features (e.g. the ascending branches of
</p>
<p>the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagrams of globular clusters). One may even say that the
</p>
<p>importance of the HL is only surpassed by that of the main sequence. It is all the
</p>
<p>more surprising that its role was not recognized until the early 1960s when the work
</p>
<p>of Hayashi (1961) appeared. The late recognition of the HL may partly be because
</p>
<p>its properties are derived from involved numerical calculations. In the following we
</p>
<p>will use extreme simplifications in order to make some basic characteristics of the
</p>
<p>HL plausible.

</p>
<p>24.1 Luminosity of Fully Convective Models
</p>
<p>Let us consider the different ways in which the luminosity is coupled to the pressure-
</p>
<p>temperature stratification of radiative and convective stars.
</p>
<p>For regions with radiative transport of energy, we can write the &ldquo;radiative
</p>
<p>luminosity&rdquo; lrad D 4�r2Frad according to (7.2) as
</p>
<p>lrad D k0radr; (24.1)

</p>
<p>If a stratification of P and T is given, then the luminosity lrad is obviously
</p>
<p>determined and can be easily calculated from (24.1).
</p>
<p>For convective transport of energy by adiabatically rising elements we can write
</p>
<p>accordingly from (7.7) the convective luminosity as
</p>
<p>lcon D k0con.r � rad/3=2 (24.3)

<p>Here we have made use of the hydrostatic equation and the definition (6.8) of the

<p>pressure scale height. The mixing length `m was defined in Sect. 7.1.
</p>
<p>In principle, we can again assume the luminosity to be determined using (24.3)
</p>
<p>for a given P�T stratification. In practice, however, we would never be able to
calculate lcon from this equation for the stellar interior, since it would require the
</p>
<p>knowledge of the value of r with inaccessible accuracy. The point is that lcon is
not proportional to the gradient r itself but rather to a power of the excess over
the adiabatic gradient, r�rad, which may be as small as 10�7 for very effective
convection (see Sect. 7.3). Therefore the convective conductivity k0con must be very
high, since large luminosities lcon are carried. This may be looked at in another way:
</p>
<p>by solving (24.3) for r and writing
</p>
<p>r D rad.1C '/; (24.5)

<p>24.2 A Simple Description of the Hayashi Line 273

<p>Therefore one usually neglects this correction in the case of effective convection and
</p>
<p>takes simply
</p>
<p>r D rad; (24.7)
</p>
<p>which is equivalent to assuming an infinite conductivity k0con. Then de facto the
luminosity is decoupled from the T�P structure.
</p>
<p>In order to fix the luminosity of a fully convective star, we have to appeal to the
</p>
<p>only region where the gradient is sufficiently non-adiabatic. This is the radiative
</p>
<p>atmosphere and a layer immediately below where the convection is ineffective,
</p>
<p>i.e. strongly superadiabatic. We have seen that then the transport of energy is
</p>
<p>essentially radiative (in spite of violent convective motions), and we can again use
</p>
<p>(24.1). By this argumentation one arrives at the statement that the structure of the
</p>
<p>outermost layers determines the luminosity of a fully convective star. This means,
</p>
<p>on the other hand, that such stars are very sensitive to all influences and uncertainties
</p>
<p>near their outer boundary.
</p>
<p>Of course, if the energy production is prescribed, one would rather say that the
</p>
<p>outer layers have to adjust to this value of L (for this point of view, see Sect. 24.5).
</p>
<p>24.2 A Simple Description of the Hayashi Line
</p>
<p>In order to derive some typical properties of the HL analytically, we shall use an
</p>
<p>extremely crude model for fully convective stars (Further refinements of the picture,
</p>
<p>though possible, would not be worth the large additional complications involved.).
</p>
<p>We have seen that nearly all of the interior part of convective stars has an
</p>
<p>adiabatic stratification, such that d ln T=d lnP D rad. We shall assume that
this simple relation between P and T holds for the whole interior up to the
</p>
<p>photosphere, i.e. we neglect the superadiabaticity in the range immediately below
</p>
<p>the photosphere. We also neglect the depression of rad in those regions near the
surface where H and He are partially ionized (see Figs. 11.2 and 14.1). We thus
</p>
<p>simply assume rad to be constant throughout the star&rsquo;s interior, say rad D 0:4,
which is the value for a fully ionized ideal gas. With these simplifications we
</p>
<p>certainly introduce errors in the P�T stratification. However, they will be nearly
the same for neighbouring models, and we can hope to obtain at least the correct
</p>
<p>differential behaviour.
</p>
<p>We then have for the whole interior the simple P�T relation
</p>
<p>P D CT 1Cn; (24.8)
</p>
<p>i.e. the star is polytropic with an index nD 1=rad � 1D 3=2, and we can use
the earlier results for such stars (see Chap. 19). The constant C is related to the
</p>
<p>polytropic constant K defined in (19.3). With P D &lt;%T=�, one finds C D
K�n.&lt;=�/1Cn. K and C are constant only within one model, but vary from star</p>

<p>to star, which means that we do not have a mass-radius relation. From (19.9) and

<p>(19.19) it follows that

<p>K � %1=3c A�2 � %1=3c R2 �M 1=3R; (24.9)

we suppose to have a radiative atmosphere with a simple absorption law of the form

<p>Integration of the hydrostatic equation through the atmosphere yields the photo-

<p>We now fit this to the interior solution by setting P D P0; T D Teff in (24.8)
and then eliminating P0 with (24.12). For given values of M and � this yields a
</p>
<p>relation between R and Teff, or between R and L, since L � R2T 4eff. Thus, any
value of R corresponds to a certain point in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram. The
</p>
<p>interior solutions form a one-dimensional manifold, since the constant C contains
</p>
<p>the free parameter R for given M [and given �, see (24.10)]. In the Hertzsprung&ndash;
</p>
<p>Russell diagram this is reflected by a one-dimensional manifold of points defining
</p>
<p>the Hayashi line.
</p>
<p>The fitting procedure is illustrated in Fig. 24.1. Each interior solution of the form

</p>
<p>We now need typical values for the exponents a and b in the atmospheric absorption
</p>
<p>law (24.11). An important property of fully convective stars can immediately be
</p>
<p>concluded from the discussion in Sect. 11.3: such stars must have very low values
</p>
<p>of Teff, i.e. the Hayashi line must be far to the right in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell
</p>
<p>diagram. For atmospheres this means that in most parts T . 5 � 103 K, and H�
absorption will provide the dominant contribution to �. If hydrogen is essentially
</p>
<p>neutral, the free electrons necessary for the formation of H� ions are provided by
the heavier elements (see Sect. 17.5). A very rough interpolation gives a ' 1; b ' 3.
With these values (24.16) yields the coefficients
</p>
<p>A D 0:05; B D 0:2: (24.17)
</p>
<p>According to (24.15), the slope of the Hayashi line in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell
</p>
<p>diagram is @ lgL=@ lgTeff D 1=A. Since A � 1, we conclude that the Hayashi
line must be very steep. The value of B � @ lg Teff=@ lgM means that the Hayashi
line shifts slightly to the left in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram for increasing M.
</p>
<p>These qualitative predictions, although derived from very crude assumptions, are
</p>
<p>fully supported by the numerical results (see Fig. 24.3).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>276 24 The Hayashi Line
</p>
<p>Let us consider once more the reason for the steepness of the HL. At the
</p>
<p>photosphere the pressures P0i of the interior solution (24.8), (24.10) and P0a of
</p>
<p>the atmospheric solution (24.12) vary for constantM as

<p>� baC1
eff
</p>
<p>R
2
</p>
<p>aC1
</p>
<p>: (24.18)
</p>
<p>First of all, we expect a very steep HL for small positive values of a. In fact, for
</p>
<p>a D 1=3, P0i and P0a have the same dependence on R; then Teff does not vary with
R (and L), and the line is vertical. If this is not quite fulfilled, the fit P0i D P0a
requires the smaller variations of Teff with varying R, the more different the two
</p>
<p>exponents of Teff in (24.18) are, i.e. the larger b.
</p>
<p>The basic approximations made were to neglect the depression of rad in ion-
ization zones and to ignore superadiabatic convection. The dotted line in Fig. 24.1
</p>
<p>indicates how these effects change the P�T structure relative to a simple polytrope.
One sees that they tend to increase the effective temperature. The precise value of
</p>
<p>Teff obviously depends on the detailed structure of the outermost envelope. The
</p>
<p>extension and the depth of the ionization zones and the superadiabatic layers change
</p>
<p>systematically with L: This has the consequence that, in better approximations, the
</p>
<p>coefficient A in (24.15) changes sign at L ' Lˇ. It is positive for smaller L; and
negative for larger L; so that the HL is convex relative to the main sequence.
</p>
<p>Another important conclusion is that the whole uncertainty which remained in
</p>
<p>the mixing-length theory of ineffective convection must occur as a corresponding
</p>
<p>uncertainty in the precise value of Teff for the HL.
</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the chemical composition enters into the position of the HL
</p>
<p>in two ways. The interior is affected, since the polytropic constant C depends on �
</p>
<p>via C 0 [see (24.10)], and the outer layers are particularly affected via the opacity �.
</p>
<p>24.3 The Neighbourhood of the Hayashi Line
</p>
<p>and the Forbidden Region
</p>
<p>We now consider stars in hydrostatic equilibrium that are close to, but not exactly
</p>
<p>on, their HL. Certainly the stars cannot be fully convective with an adiabatic
</p>
<p>interior (otherwise they would be on the HL). Their interior is then no longer a
</p>
<p>simple polytrope. They do not even have to be chemically homogeneous, since
</p>
<p>they are not fully mixed by the turbulent motions. We must therefore expect that an
</p>
<p>analytical treatment will be muchmore complicated.We will nevertheless try to give
</p>
<p>some simple arguments which may help to make the numerical results plausible.
</p>
<p>In the following, we treat models with a fixed value of M and the same chemical
</p>
<p>composition (at least in their outer layers).</p>

<p>24.3 The Neighbourhood of the Hayashi Line and the Forbidden Region 277
</p>
<p>An important indication can be obtained from the discussion of the envelope
</p>
<p>integrations in Sect. 11.3. When integrating inwards into models with different Teff
(but with the same parameters M and � and, say, the same L), we will reach a
</p>
<p>radiative region the earlier, the larger Teff . In other words, in models left of the HL
</p>
<p>we will encounter a radiative region before reaching the centre. In these regions, the
</p>
<p>gradient r &lt; rad. Let us consider some average Nr obtained by averaging over the
whole interior (where we again neglect the complications in the outermost parts of
</p>
<p>the envelope). On the HL we have Nr D rad. In a model to the left of the HL the
radiative part decreases the average value such that Nr &lt; rad. This suggests that we
would have to allow Nr &lt; rad in models to the right of the HL.
</p>
<p>In order to prove this we treat models with a constant gradient r D Nr in the
interior and vary Nr slightly around rad. We then have again polytropic stars with
slightly different n (around 3/2). The interior solution is written as
</p>
<p>P D CnT 1Cn; (24.19)
</p>
<p>where Nr D .1C n/�1 and, similarly to (24.10),

<p>We extend relation (24.19) to the photosphere (P D P0; T D Teff), where we again
eliminate P0 by (24.12) and R by the relation R D c2L1=2T �2eff . This gives the locus
in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram. The factor of proportionality in (24.12) may
</p>
<p>be called c1. Choosing for simplicity a D 1; b D 3 in the opacity law, we obtain

<p>on and close to the HL with L D M D � D 1. The variation of lgTeff with n
is then only due to the variation of the last three terms in (24.22). One finds that</p>

<p>278 24 The Hayashi Line
</p>
<p>Fig. 24.2 (a) In the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram, the Hayashi line (n D 3=2, heavy line)
is indicated, together with some neighbouring lines for interior polytropes with n &gt; 3=2 and

<p>value of R
</p>
<p>@ lgTeff=@n &gt; 0: the stars move to the right in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram
</p>
<p>with decreasing n (i.e. increasing Nr).
Thus, we have to expect the following situation (see Fig. 24.2): left of the HL
</p>
<p>we have Nr &lt; rad and some part of the model is radiative. On the HL, the model
is fully convective with Nr D rad. Models to the right of the HL should have
Nr &gt; rad, which means that they should have a superadiabatic stratification in their
very interior (aside from the outermost zone of ineffective convection).
</p>
<p>The mixing-length theory has shown that a negligibly small excess of r overrad
suffices in order to transport any reasonable luminosity in the deep interior of stars.
</p>
<p>Then, what happens with a star that by some arbitrary means (e.g. initial conditions)
</p>
<p>has been brought to a place to the right of the HL, such that some region in its
</p>
<p>deep interior has remarkably large values of r � rad &gt; 0&lsaquo; The results are large
convective velocities vconv � .r � rad/1=2 and corresponding convective fluxes
[cf. (24.3)]. These cool the interior and heat the upper layers rapidly until the
</p>
<p>gradient is lowered to r � rad and the star has moved to the HL. This will happen
within the short timescale for the adjustment of convection.
</p>
<p>Another possibility for a star being situated to the right of its HL is, of course, that
</p>
<p>it is not in hydrostatic equilibrium (which is assumed for the interior solution). But
</p>
<p>a deviation from this equilibrium will be removed in the timescale for hydrostatic
</p>
<p>adjustment, which is even shorter.
</p>
<p>Therefore the HL is in fact a borderline between an &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; region (left)
</p>
<p>and a &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; region (right) for stars of given M and composition that are in
</p>
<p>hydrostatic equilibrium and have a fully adjusted convection.</p>

<p>24.4 Numerical Results
</p>
<p>There are many results available giving the position of Hayashi lines for stars of
</p>
<p>widely ranging mass and chemical composition and for different assumptions in the
</p>
<p>convection theory. The latter concerns in particular the ratio of mixing length to
</p>
<p>pressure scale height used for calculating the superadiabatic envelope.
</p>
<p>Figure 24.3 shows typical results of calculations for stellar masses of up to
</p>
<p>1:1 Mˇ. One sees that indeed the HLs plotted here are very steep, the exact slope
depending mainly on L: The dependence on M (lower panel) is roughly given by</p>

</p>
<p>@ lgTeff=@ lgM � 0:1, i.e. we find the expected weak increase of Teff with M [cf.
(24.22)]. The dependence on chemical composition (top panel) is, however, very
</p>
<p>different from that given by (24.23), which yields ˛3 D 0:5. It predicts only a slight
decrease in Teff, when increasing the metallicity from 10
</p>
<p>�4 to 0:02, as in the left
panel of the figure. In that case lg� changes from �0.229 to �0.226, and lg Teff
should increase by� 0:002. The numerical result instead is @ lgTeff=@ lg� � �26,
i.e. with increasing molecular weight Teff is strongly reduced!
</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier the chemical composition enters in several ways. A very
</p>
<p>important factor certainly is the opacity in the atmosphere. For Teff . 5; 000K the
</p>
<p>dominant absorption is due to H�, and � then is proportional to the electron pressure,
which in turn is proportional to the abundance of the easily ionized metals. It turns
</p>
<p>out that a decrease of their abundance (usually comprised inZ) by a factor 10 shifts
</p>
<p>the HL by � lgTeff � C0:05 to the left in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram. This
explains the large effect of changing the composition seen in Fig. 24.3. However,
</p>
<p>Fig. 24.4 shows that roughly the same shift can be obtained by the comparatively
</p>
<p>small increase of lm=HP from 1 to 1.5. The uncertainty of the convection theory,
</p>
<p>therefore, severely limits our knowledge of the HL.
</p>
<p>The typical S-shape of the numerical Hayashi tracks in Fig. 24.3 are the result
</p>
<p>of the sign change of coefficient A in (24.15), which was mentioned at the end of
</p>
<p>Sect. 24.2. At the lowest end of the Hayashi tracks the models develop a radiative
</p>
<p>core and begin to bend back to the main sequence, where they end once nuclear
</p>
<p>burning has started at the centre, supplying the energy radiated from the surface.
</p>
<p>This is the situation discussed in Sect. 24.3.
</p>
<p>Thus, the HLs are far away from the main sequence in the upper part of the
</p>
<p>diagram, and approach it in the lower part. This fact will turn out to influence the
</p>
<p>evolutionary tracks of stars of differentM . Recall that the main-sequence stars were
</p>
<p>found to be fully convective for M . 0:25Mˇ (see Sect. 22.3). This obviously
means that the corresponding Hayashi lines cross the main sequence there.</p>

<p>24.5 Limitations for Fully Convective Models 281
</p>
<p>24.5 Limitations for Fully Convective Models
</p>
<p>In order to describe the HL, we have considered models for which the convection
</p>
<p>was postulated to reach from centre to surface. This provided a polytropic interior
</p>
<p>structure with typical decoupling from the luminosity. We have not yet asked
</p>
<p>whether the physical situation will in fact allow the onset of convection throughout
</p>
<p>the star. This depends on the distribution of the energy sources.
</p>
<p>According to the Schwarzschild criterion (6.13), a chemically homogeneous
</p>
<p>layer will be convective if
</p>
<p>rrad � rad; (24.24)
</p>
<p>where the radiative gradient [see (5.28)] is
</p>
<p>rrad �
�lP
</p>
<p>T 4m
: (24.25)
</p>
<p>If the energy sources were completely arbitrary, we could choose their distribution
</p>
<p>so that (24.24) is violated at some point and the model could not be fully convective.
</p>
<p>A trivial example would be a central core without any sources, with the result that
</p>
<p>there l D 0; i.e rrad D 0. Then the core must be radiative. On the other hand,
we have the best chance of finding convection throughout a star of given L if the
</p>
<p>sources are highly concentrated towards the centre (in the extreme: a point source),
</p>
<p>which gives almost l D L everywhere.
We consider a contracting polytrope (see Sect. 20.3) without nuclear energy
</p>
<p>sources, which is of interest for early stellar evolution. According to (20.41) the
</p>
<p>energy generation rate is then only proportional to T; which means a rather weak
</p>
<p>central concentration. For the sake of simplicity we even go a step further and
</p>
<p>assume constant energy sources with
</p>
<p>l
</p>
<p>m
D L
M
</p>
<p>D constant: (24.26)
</p>
<p>We again use the opacity law (24.11) and the polytropic relation (24.8) with n D 1:5
(corresponding to r D rad D 0:4). Equation (24.25) then gives
</p>
<p>rrad �
L
</p>
<p>M
C 1CaT b�4C2:5.1Ca/: (24.27)
</p>
<p>For a typical Kramers opacity with a D 1; b D �4:5 this becomes rrad � T �3:5.
Indeed, for all reasonable interior opacities, rrad has a minimum at the centre and
increases outwards. Therefore the centre is the first point in a fully convective star
</p>
<p>where rrad drops below rad (and a radiative region starts to develop) if L decreases
below a minimum value Lmin.
</p>
<p>The constant C depends onM and R as given by (24.10), and T � Tc � M=R
after (20.24). Introducing this into (24.27) we obtain</p>

<p>rrad � LM b�5C2.1Ca/R�bC4�4.1Ca/: (24.28)

<p>Let us again set a D 1, b D �4:5, which gives
</p>
<p>rrad � LM�5:5R0:5: (24.29)
</p>
<p>For models on the HL, the effective temperatures vary only a very little and we

<p>rrad � L1:25M�5:5: (24.30)
</p>
<p>For any given value of M the luminosity reaches Lmin if the central value of rrad
has dropped to 0.4. According to (24.30), Lmin depends onM as
</p>
<p>Lmin �M 4:4: (24.31)
</p>
<p>This minimum luminosity (down to which models of the specified type on the
</p>
<p>HL remain fully convective) decreases strongly with M: The decrease is in fact
</p>
<p>steeper than that given by theM � L relation of the main sequence. This provides
the possibility that the HL for very small M can cross the main sequence without
</p>
<p>reaching Lmin.
</p>
<p>Note, however, that strictly speaking a &ldquo;minimum luminosity&rdquo; always refers to a

<p>Stability Considerations
</p>
<p>Even the most beautiful stellar model is not worth anything if one does not know
</p>
<p>whether it is stable or not. Stability is discussed again and again throughout this
</p>
<p>book. Here we review the different types of stability considerations necessary for
</p>
<p>stars. We intend to make the basic mechanisms and concepts plausible rather than
</p>
<p>present the full formalism; the reader will find this, for example, in the review article
</p>
<p>by Ledoux (1958).
</p>
<p>25.1 General Remarks
</p>
<p>It is not easy to give a very general concept of stability that is applicable to all
</p>
<p>possible cases. Different definitions are discussed in La Salle and Lefschetz (1961).
</p>
<p>We may use, for example, the following: let the solution of a system of (time-
</p>
<p>dependent) differential equations be a set of functions y1.t/, y2.t/; : : : which we
</p>
<p>comprise in the symbol y.t/. We define a &ldquo;distance&rdquo; between two such solutions
</p>
<p>ya.t/; yb.t/ by
</p>
<p>jjya.t/ � yb.t/jj WD
X
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>h

yai .t/ � ybi .t/
</p>
<p>�2i
: (25.1)
</p>
<p>We then call the solution ya.t/ stable at t D t0 if for any t1 &gt; t0 and for any
small positive number ı there exists a small positive number ı such that any other
</p>
<p>solution yb.t/ having the distance jjya.t0/ � yb.t0/jj &lt; ı at t D t0 will keep a
distance jjya.t1/ � yb.t1/jj &lt; ".
</p>
<p>This definition in plain words says that a solution is stable at a given point
</p>
<p>t0 if all solutions that at t D t0 are in its neighbourhood remain neighbouring
solutions. The problems we are interested in can be reduced to first-order systems
</p>
<p>in time. Therefore the above definition of neighbouring solutions also guarantees
</p>
<p>neighbouring derivatives.

<p>284 25 Stability Considerations
</p>
<p>Fig. 25.1 An example of stability in mechanics. A ball on a surface under the influence of gravity
</p>
<p>(a) in stable and (b) in unstable equilibrium. In (c) the motion starting at point A is stable, but,
</p>
<p>starting with zero velocity at point B; the motion is unstable
</p>
<p>One normally is familiar with stability problems in mechanics. We recall a few
</p>
<p>simple examples, the first being the freely rolling ball on a curved surface which is
</p>
<p>concave in the direction opposite to gravity (see Fig. 25.1a). One solution is that of
</p>
<p>equilibrium, where the ball rests in the lowest position. The initially neighbouring
</p>
<p>position is obtained by a small perturbation, say, by a slight horizontal displacement.
</p>
<p>The ball will then move about the equilibrium position, but it will never increase its
</p>
<p>distance above its initial value: the equilibrium position is stable and friction would
</p>
<p>merely restore the ball to its equilibrium position. In the case of a convex surface
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 25.1b) the equilibrium is unstable, since after a small displacement the ball
</p>
<p>will move further and further from the equilibrium position. While these examples
</p>
<p>deal with the stability of an equilibrium in which the solution is time independent,
</p>
<p>our general definition also concerns time-dependent solutions. The motion of a ball
</p>
<p>rolling on the surface in Fig. 25.1c can be stable or unstable. The motion is stable if
</p>
<p>it starts with zero velocity at a point A above B (non-periodic motion), or below B
</p>
<p>(periodic motion). But a motion starting exactly at B with zero velocity and ending
</p>
<p>at rest at C is unstable: a slight perturbation of the initial conditions can either
</p>
<p>produce a periodic motion (the ball never overcomes the summit C ) or cause the
</p>
<p>ball to roll beyond C and never come back.
</p>
<p>When considering the influence of friction, one may naı̈vely expect that it
</p>
<p>stabilizes an otherwise unstable motion, since it uses up energy. But the following
</p>
<p>example will show that friction can also produce instability.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.2 Stability of the Piston Model 285
</p>
<p>We again consider the ball in the spherical bowl (Fig. 25.1a). But nowwe assume
</p>
<p>that the bowl is rotating with an angular velocity ! around a vertical axis through
</p>
<p>the minimum. Without friction no angular momentum can be transferred to the ball
</p>
<p>which therefore does not know anything of rotation and behaves as in the non-
</p>
<p>rotating case: the lowest position is stable. If there is friction, however, and the ball is
</p>
<p>&ldquo;kicked&rdquo; out of its lowest (equilibrium) position, it will take up angular momentum
</p>
<p>from the rotating bowl. For sufficiently large ! the ball goes to a new equilibrium
</p>
<p>position outside the axis around which it rotates with ! and where the tangential
</p>
<p>components of centrifugal and gravity forces balance each other. The lowest position
</p>
<p>has obviously become unstable by the inclusion of friction.
</p>
<p>25.2 Stability of the Piston Model
</p>
<p>Closer to stars than the above mechanical examples is the piston model introduced
</p>
<p>in Sect. 2.7, since it also incorporates thermal effects. We consider the stability of
</p>
<p>an equilibrium solution with a certain constant height h:Will a solution originating
</p>
<p>from a small displacement of the piston remain in its neighbourhood? This stability
</p>
<p>problem has already been discussed in Sect. 6.6, where we made approximations
</p>
<p>appropriate for the illustration of the stability of convective blobs. We now improve
</p>
<p>the model by adding some complications typical of stars.
</p>
<p>25.2.1 Dynamical Stability
</p>
<p>In this case one assumes that there is no heat leakage, no nuclear energy generation,
</p>
<p>and no absorption, i.e. " D � D � D 0 in (5.39). Therefore the entropy of the gas
remains constant during the displacement of the piston. In Sect. 6.6, we investigated
</p>
<p>the resulting (adiabatic) oscillations of the model around the equilibrium position,
</p>
<p>though with constant weight G� only. We now allow G� to vary with height
ŒG� D G�.h/&#141; as we did in Sect. 3.2. This can be achieved, for instance, by putting
the piston model into an inhomogeneous gravitational field. Then the equation of

<p>which replaces (6.37). Recall that the perturbation changes with time as ei!t . We
</p>
<p>see that !ad is a real number only as long as &#13;ad &gt; �G�h . In this case the small
perturbation is followed by a periodic oscillation which remains small for all times.
</p>
<p>It is therefore stable in the sense of our definition of stability at the beginning of
</p>
<p>this paragraph. But if &#13;ad &lt; �G�h , then !ad is imaginary and one of the eigenvalues
! gives an amplitude growing exponentially in time: the equilibrium solution is
</p>
<p>unstable (We will see in Sect. 25.3.2 that for stars the analogue of &#13;ad &gt; �G�h is
&#13;ad &gt; 4=3.).
</p>
<p>25.2.2 Inclusion of Non-adiabatic Effects
</p>
<p>We now drop the assumption of strict adiabaticity. Non-adiabatic changes were
</p>
<p>previously included in Sect. 5.4 (refer also to the last part of Sect. 6.6). The energy
</p>
<p>equation of the piston model (5.39) includes the non-adiabatic terms for nuclear
</p>
<p>generation ", absorption �, and heat leakage �. We consider " and � as functions of

<p>288 25 Stability Considerations
</p>
<p>or decrease in time, depending on the sign of �r. Because of j�rj � !ad these
changes take place over a time much longer than the oscillation period, actually on
</p>
<p>a scale corresponding to �adj in (5.41). This type of stability behaviour is called the
</p>
<p>vibrational stability (compare Sect. 6.6). If the oscillation grows in time, the solution
</p>
<p>leaves the neighbourhood of equilibrium, which therefore is unstable.
</p>
<p>We now turn to the third root of (25.12) or (25.14), which occurs necessarily
</p>
<p>with the dissipative terms eP ; eT . Instead of solving the third-order equation (25.14),
</p>
<p>we will follow some heuristic arguments. The addition of non-adiabatic terms has
</p>
<p>changed the rapid oscillations only to the extent that their amplitude varies on long
</p>
<p>timescales (of the order of ��1r ). We now look for the existence of a third solution
changing with this long timescale only. Then the inertia terms can be neglected and,
</p>
<p>consequently, the terms with �3 and �2 disappear in (25.14). The solution of (25.14)
</p>
<p>for this so-called secular stability problem is

<p>eT
</p>
<p>u0
: (25.16)
</p>
<p>For sufficiently small non-adiabaticity eT , we can achieve j�secj � !ad, and
neglecting the �2 and �3 terms in (25.14) was justified. If �sec &lt; 0, any perturbation
</p>
<p>will decay within a kind of thermal adjustment time �adj � ��1sec and the equilibrium
is secularly stable. But if �sec &gt; 0, then it will grow on that timescale (independently
</p>
<p>of vibrational stability): The equilibrium is secularly unstable.
</p>
<p>We have now found the three well-known types of stability behaviour: dynami-
</p>
<p>cal, vibrational, and secular stability . This classification is possible since j!adj �
j!secj, which is equivalent to saying that �hydr � �adj. From one type of stability
one cannot draw any conclusions about the behaviour of another type, for example,
</p>
<p>a dynamically stable model can still be vibrationally or secularly unstable. If the
</p>
<p>model were dynamically unstable, the other instabilities would be of no interest
</p>
<p>since the model would move out of equilibrium long before any other instability
</p>
<p>can develop.
</p>
<p>We will find more or less the same behaviour in stars where also �hydr � �adj �
�KH. However, there we cannot solve the eigenvalue problem analytically any more.
</p>
<p>This is the reason why we dwelt in such length on the stability of the piston model.
</p>
<p>25.3 Stellar Stability
</p>
<p>For the problem of stellar stability a very general definition, like that given at the
</p>
<p>beginning of Sect. 25.1, has to be taken with care. For example, a star may be stable
</p>
<p>in one phase (e.g. on the main sequence) and later on become unstable (e.g. in
</p>
<p>the Cepheid phase). At any stage of evolution the solution (the stellar model) is
</p>
<p>obtained for certain parameters, for instance, a certain chemical composition or
</p>
<p>a certain distribution of entropy. It is reasonable to ask whether this solution is
</p>
<p>stable in the following sense: Does a small perturbation decay rapidly compared</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.3 Stellar Stability 289
</p>
<p>to the change of the parameters of the model (e.g. its chemical composition)? Then
</p>
<p>we would call the model stable. Therefore, the question of the Cepheid stability
</p>
<p>is irrelevant for the stability of its main-sequence progenitor since the chemical
</p>
<p>composition is different. The solution for a certain phase of evolution, in general,
</p>
<p>is obtained by solving approximate equations. For example, complete equilibrium
</p>
<p>may be assumed in the case of the main sequence, while only the inertia terms are
</p>
<p>dropped for the evolution through the Cepheid phase. If such approximate models
</p>
<p>approach an instability in the run of their evolution, the neglected time derivatives
</p>
<p>become important and have to be taken into account. In general, then, the solution
</p>
<p>obtained from better approximations tells us in which direction the evolution really
</p>
<p>goes.
</p>
<p>25.3.1 Perturbation Equations
</p>
<p>We want to investigate the stability of a stellar model in complete equilibrium for
</p>
<p>given input parameters M and chemical composition. Let the model be described
</p>
<p>by r0.m/, P0.m/, T0.m/, l0.m/, which solve the time-independent stellar structure
</p>
<p>equations. We test its stability by investigating how a neighbouring (perturbed)
</p>
<p>solution evolves in time. We here restrict ourselves to spherically symmetric
</p>
<p>perturbations which depend on m and t in such a way that the perturbed variables
</p>
<p>become
</p>

</p>
<p>where the absolute values of x; p; # , and � are � 1. These variables have to fulfill
the time-dependent equations (10.1)&ndash;(10.4). As an example let us introduce (25.17)
</p>
<p>into the equation of motion (10.2). If we linearize with respect to p and x; this

</p>
<p>Equations (25.19)&ndash;(25.22) are four linear homogeneous differential equations of
</p>
<p>first order for the variables p; #; x; � which have to obey certain boundary
</p>
<p>conditions corresponding to those of the unperturbed solutions. They have to be
</p>
<p>regular in the centre and to be fitted to an atmosphere. We will deal with the
</p>
<p>boundary conditions in Chaps. 40 and 41, where they are shown to be equivalent
</p>
<p>to four linear homogeneous equations. Therefore, solutions exist only for certain
</p>
<p>eigenvalues of !; which have to be found numerically. There exists an infinite
</p>
<p>number of eigenvalues for which the system can be solved. For each eigenvalue
</p>
<p>!� one obtains a set of eigenfunctions p�.m/, #�.m/, x�.m/, ��.m/.
The term with !2.� Rr) in (25.19) comes from the inertial terms in the equation
</p>
<p>of motion, while in (25.21), the term with i!.� PP ; PT / is due to the time derivatives
in the energy equation. The two corresponding timescales are �hydr and �adj D �KH.
Since �hydr � �KH, we have a situation similar to that described for the piston model
in Sect. 25.2. Correspondingly, in general, we can speak of dynamical, vibrational,
</p>
<p>and secular stability.
</p>
<p>There are, however, more complicated cases where this classification of stability
</p>
<p>behaviour is not possible. For example, the relevant thermal timescale may not be
</p>
<p>that of the whole star but a much shorter one for a small subregion. If the char-
</p>
<p>acteristic wavelength of a thermal perturbation is short enough, the corresponding
</p>
<p>adjustment time can become comparable or shorter than �hydr (of the whole star).
</p>
<p>Another example is the case of a dynamically stable model which evolves in such a
</p>
<p>way that it approaches marginal stability (!ad ! 0). Then the oscillations become
so slow that they certainly will not be adiabatic anymore: 1=!ad � �KH (although
�hydr � �KH still).
</p>
<p>25.3.2 Dynamical Stability
</p>
<p>Since in Chap. 40 we will treat this problem thoroughly, we merely present some
</p>
<p>general results here. Instead of solving all four equations (25.19)&ndash;(25.22), one
</p>
<p>can consider oscillations taking place on the timescale �hydr. Since �hydr � �adj,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.3 Stellar Stability 291
</p>
<p>the temperature of the matter changes almost adiabatically. Instead of solving
</p>
<p>(25.21) and (25.22) one just replaces # by prad in (25.20). Therefore (25.19) and
(25.20) present two equations for p and x with the eigenvalue !2. As we will see
</p>
<p>in Chap. 40 the eigenvalue problem is self-adjoint. Then there exists an infinite
</p>
<p>series of eigenvalues !2n which are real. (!n is either real or purely imaginary).
</p>
<p>Therefore, they either correspond to periodic oscillations (!2n &gt; 0) or exponentially
</p>
<p>decreasing/increasing solutions (!2n &lt; 0). The same behaviour was found for the
</p>
<p>adiabatic case of the piston model. But now, with an infinite number of eigenvalues,
</p>
<p>stability demands that for all eigenvalues !2n &gt; 0, while even a single eigenvalue
</p>
<p>with !2n &lt; 0 is sufficient for instability.
</p>
<p>How a star behaves after it is adiabatically compressed or expanded depends on
</p>
<p>the numerical value of &#13;ad. This can be most easily seen in the case of homologous
</p>
<p>changes. Let us consider a concentric sphere r D r.m/ in a star of hydrostatic
equilibrium.
</p>
<p>The pressure there is equal to the weight of the layers above a unit area of the
</p>
<p>sphere, as shown by integrating the hydrostatic equation:
</p>
<p>P D
Z M
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>Gm
</p>
<p>4�r4
dm: (25.23)
</p>
<p>We now compress the star artificially and assume the compression to be adiabatic
</p>
<p>and homologous. In general, after this procedure, the star will no longer be in
</p>
<p>hydrostatic equilibrium.
</p>
<p>If a prime indicates values after the compression, then homology demands that
</p>
<p>the right-hand side of (25.23) varies like .R0=R/�4 [cf. (20.37)] where R is the
stellar radius, while adiabaticity and homology demand that the left-hand side varies
</p>
<p>as
</p>
<p>.%0=%/&#13;ad D .R0=R/�3&#13;ad (25.24)
</p>
<p>according to (20.9). Therefore, if &#13;ad D 4=3, the pressure on the left-hand side
of (25.23) increases stronger with the contraction than the weight on the right:
</p>
<p>The resulting force is directed outwards, and the star will move back towards
</p>
<p>equilibrium: it is dynamically stable.
</p>
<p>For &#13;ad &lt; 4=3 the weight increases stronger than the pressure and the star would
</p>
<p>collapse after the initial compression (dynamical instability). For &#13;ad D 4=3, the
compression leads again to hydrostatic equilibrium: One has neutral equilibrium.
</p>
<p>The condition &#13;ad &gt; 4=3 corresponds to the dynamical stability condition &#13;ad &gt;
</p>
<p>�G�h for the piston model (Sect. 25.2.1).
In Chap. 40 we will see that &#13;ad D 4=3 is also a critical value for non-homologous
</p>
<p>perturbations. If &#13;ad is not constant within a star, for instance, because of ionization,
</p>
<p>then marginal stability occurs if a certain mean value of &#13;ad over the star reaches the
</p>
<p>critical value 4/3.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that radiation pressure can bring &#13;ad near the critical value
</p>
<p>4/3 (see Sect. 13.2). This is the reason why supermassive stars are in indifferent
</p>
<p>equilibrium, i.e. they are marginally stable (see Sect. 19.10).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>292 25 Stability Considerations
</p>
<p>The critical value 4/3 depends strongly on spherical symmetry and Newtonian
</p>
<p>gravitation. The 4 in the numerator comes from the fact that the weight of the
</p>
<p>envelope in Newtonian mechanics varies as � r�2 and has to be distributed over
the surface of our sphere, giving another r�2. The 3 in the denominator comes
from the r3 in the formula for the volume of a sphere. Therefore, effects of general
</p>
<p>relativity change the critical value (see Sect. 38.2) of &#13;ad and make the models less
</p>
<p>stable. Since we have assumed spherical symmetry in deriving the critical value of
</p>
<p>&#13;ad, rotation changes it, too. It can decrease the critical value of &#13;ad and make the
</p>
<p>models more stable.
</p>
<p>25.3.3 Non-adiabatic Effects
</p>
<p>The inclusion of non-adiabatic effects in a dynamically stable model brings us
</p>
<p>to the question of its vibrational and secular stability (A dynamical instability
</p>
<p>makes a perturbation grow so rapidly that any other possible instability of vibra-
</p>
<p>tional or secular type is irrelevant because of their much longer timescales.).
</p>
<p>Vibrational stability means an oscillation with nearly adiabatic frequency but with
</p>
<p>slowly decreasing (stability) or increasing amplitude (instability). Such oscillations
</p>
<p>describe the behaviour of pulsating stars and therefore are treated in detail in
</p>
<p>Chap. 41.
</p>
<p>Secular (or thermal) stability is governed by thermal relaxation processes. In
</p>
<p>general these proceed on timescales long compared to �hydr and, therefore, the inertia
</p>
<p>terms in the equation of motion can be dropped. This means that the term � !2 in
(25.19) can be omitted. Equations (25.19)&ndash;(25.22) together with proper boundary
</p>
<p>conditions can then be solved, yielding an infinite number of secular eigenvalues
</p>
<p>!sec. Normally they are purely imaginary (as in the case of the piston model). This
</p>
<p>is what one expects from a thermal relaxation process, such as in the problem
</p>
<p>of diffusion of heat. It is therefore all the more surprising that in certain cases
</p>
<p>a few complex eigenvalues occur (Aizenman and Perdang 1971). The oscillatory
</p>
<p>behaviour here comes from heat flowing back and forth between different regions in
</p>
<p>the star (Obviously this could not occur in the single layer of the piston model.). If
</p>
<p>instead of ! we again use � WD i!, the system (25.19)&ndash;(25.22) has real coefficients.
Therefore the eigenvalues � , if complex, appear in conjugate complex pairs. Again,
</p>
<p>the sign of the real part of � (the imaginary part of !/ distinguishes between secular
</p>
<p>stability or instability.
</p>
<p>The most important application of the secular problem to stellar evolution
</p>
<p>concerns the question whether a nuclear burning is stable or not. Secular instability
</p>
<p>in degenerate regions leads to the flash phenomenon, while in thin (nondegenerate)
</p>
<p>shell sources, it results in quasiperiodic thermal pulses.
</p>
<p>In order to make the secular stability of a central burning plausible, we treat a
</p>
<p>simple model of the central region, assuming homologous changes of the rest of the
</p>
<p>star. Other secular instabilities which occur in burning shells or which are due to
</p>
<p>nonspherical perturbations will be discussed later (Sects. 33.5 and 34.2).</p>

</p>
<p>25.3.4 The Gravothermal Specific Heat
</p>
<p>Let us consider a small sphere of radius rs and mass ms around the centre of a star
</p>
<p>in hydrostatic equilibrium. If the sphere is sufficiently small, then P at rs and the
</p>
<p>mean density in the sphere are good approximations for the central values Pc, %c.
</p>
<p>Suppose that, as a reaction to the addition of a small amount of heat to the central
</p>
<p>sphere, the whole star is slightly expanding and let the expansion be homologous.
</p>
<p>Then any mass shell of radius r after expansion has the radius r C dr D r.1C x),
where x is constant for all mass shells. If after the expansion the pressure in the
</p>
<p>sphere is Pc C dPc, then, similarly to (20.34) and (20.37), the resulting changes of
%c and Pc are

</p>
<p>4˛ � 3#c: (25.27)
</p>
<p>According to the first law of thermodynamics the heat dq per mass unit added to the

<p>central sphere is
</p>
<p>dq D duC Pdv D cPTc.#c � radpc/ WD c�Tc#c; (25.28)

: (25.29)
</p>
<p>This quantity has the dimension of a specific heat per mass unit. Indeed, dT D
dq=c� gives the temperature variation in the central sphere if the heat dq is added.
In thermodynamics we are used to defining specific heats with some mechanical
</p>
<p>boundary conditions, for example, cP and cv: For c
� the mechanical condition is
</p>
<p>that the gas pressure is kept in equilibrium with the weight of all the layers with
</p>
<p>r &gt; rs. This c
� is called the gravothermal specific heat.
</p>
<p>For an ideal monatomic gas (a D ı D 1;rad D 2=5), as we have approximately
in the central region of the Sun, one finds from (25.29) that c� &lt; 0. This is
fortunate, since if in the Sun the nuclear energy generation is accidentally enhanced
</p>
<p>for a moment (dq &gt; 0), then dT &lt; 0, the region cools, thereby reducing the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>294 25 Stability Considerations
</p>
<p>overproduction of energy immediately. Therefore the negative specific heat acts
</p>
<p>as a stabilizer. At first glance it seems as if the decrease of temperature after an
</p>
<p>injection of heat contradicts energy conservation. But one has also to take into
</p>
<p>account the Pdv work done by the central sphere. Indeed, while the centre cools
</p>
<p>(#c &lt; 0), the whole star expands, since elimination of pc and d%c=%c from (25.25)
</p>
<p>and (25.26) gives x D �ı#c=.4˛ � 3/, which in the case ˛ D ı D 1 yields
x &gt; 0. It turns out that, if heat is added to the central sphere, more energy is used
</p>
<p>up by the expansion, and therefore some must be taken from the internal energy.
</p>
<p>This behaviour is essentially connected with the virial theorem (see Sect. 3.1). A
</p>
<p>corresponding property can be found for the piston model by assuming a variable
</p>
<p>weight G� of the piston as in Sect. 3.2.
For a nonrelativistic degenerate gas (ı ! 0; ˛ ! 3=5) equation (25.29) gives
</p>
<p>c� &gt; 0: the addition of energy to the central sphere heats up the matter, which can
lead to thermal runaway.
</p>
<p>25.3.5 Secular Stability Behaviour of Nuclear Burning
</p>
<p>Having derived a handy expression for dq, we shall now use it in the energy balance
</p>
<p>of the central sphere considered in Sect. 25.3.4. Energy is released in the sphere by
</p>
<p>nuclear reactions and transported out of it by radiation (we assume here that the
</p>
<p>central region is not convective). In the steady state gains and losses compensate
</p>
<p>each other. Let " be the mean energy generation rate, and ls the energy per unit time

<p>The sign of the bracket tells us whether for dTc &gt; 0 the additional energy production

whether in this case the sphere heats up .c� &gt; 0) or cools .c� &lt; 0). Normally "T

</p>
<p>This criterion is normally fulfilled. The only &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; term is �T , which can be

suffices to fulfill (25.37), since the other terms are positive.

<p>Any temperature increase dTc &gt; 0 would cause a large additional energy

</p>
<p>stable manner, the negative gravothermal specific heat acts like a thermostat. This,
</p>
<p>for example, is the case in the Sun.
</p>
<p>We go back to (25.35) for the general equation of state. Since normally "T

<p>Obviously D &lt; 0 indicates stability, D &gt; 0 instability. Since "T &gt; 0 and, for an

<p>ideal gas, c� &lt; 0, the quantityD is negative: The nuclear burning is stable.
For a nonrelativistic degenerate gas we have ı D 0, ˛ D 3=5. Therefore, c� &gt; 0
</p>
<p>andD &gt; 0: Any nuclear burning with a sufficiently strong temperature dependence
</p>
<p>will then be unstable. This is the reason, for instance, why in the central regions
</p>
<p>of a white dwarf there can be no strong nuclear energy source [as first shown by
</p>
<p>Mestel (1952)]; the star would be destroyed by thermal runaway, or at least heat up
</p>
<p>until it was not degenerate and then expand. Of course, then it would no longer be
</p>
<p>a white dwarf. The same instability is also responsible for the phenomenon of the
</p>
<p>so-called flash (compare Sect. 33.4) which occurs if a new nuclear burning starts
</p>
<p>in a degenerate region. Note that the appearance of 4˛ � 3 in the denominator in
several equations, including (25.29) for c� and (25.35), does not become serious
even if ˛ ! 3=4 for partial nonrelativistic degeneracy, since the singularity can
be removed from the equation which one obtains if c� is inserted in (19.35) by
multiplication with 4˛ � 3.
</p>
<p>From (25.38) one can draw another conclusion. Let us assume that in the central
</p>
<p>region of a star there is no nuclear burning but that energy losses by neutrinos
</p>
<p>(Sect. 18.7) are important. The nuclear energy production in the star may take place
</p>
<p>in a concentric shell of finite radius. Part of this energy flows outwards, providing
</p>
<p>the star&rsquo;s luminosity, while part of it flows from the shell inwards towards the centre
</p>
<p>where it goes into neutrinos. The maximum temperature then is in the shell and
</p>
<p>not in the stellar centre. In Sect. 33.5 we shall see that this really can be the case
</p>
<p>in models of evolved stars. If we now again look at (25.38), we have to be aware
</p>
<p>that ls &lt; 0. If "T &gt; 0, as it is for neutrino losses (see Sect. 18.7), all the above
</p>
<p>conclusions are contradicted because of the different sign of ls: The equilibrium is
</p>
<p>stable if c� &gt; 0, i.e. for degeneracy, but unstable if c� &lt; 0, which is the case for an
ideal gas.
</p>
<p>All our discussions here were based on the assumption of homologous changes
</p>
<p>in the stellar model. Although stars clearly never change precisely in such a simple
</p>
<p>way, it turns out that the above conclusions describe qualitatively correctly the
</p>
<p>secular stability behaviour of stars. Deviations from homology only influence
</p>
<p>the factors [e.g. in the bracket in (25.36)], thus modifying the exact position of
</p>
<p>the border between secular stability and instability.</p>

</p>
<p>The Onset of Star Formation
</p>
<p>Stars form out of interstellar matter. With modern telescopes and instruments this
</p>
<p>can nowadays be observed directly and in many phases of the formation process.
</p>
<p>Indeed a homogeneous cloud of compressible gas can become gravitationally unsta-
</p>
<p>ble and collapse. In this section we shall deal with gravitational instability and then
</p>
<p>discuss some of its consequences. But before we do so it may be worth comparing
</p>
<p>this instability with those discussed in Chap. 25. For gravitational instability the
</p>
<p>inertia terms are important as well as heat exchange of the collapsing mass with its
</p>
<p>surroundings. But it is not a vibrational instability, since the classification scheme
</p>
<p>of Chap. 25 holds only if the free-fall time is much shorter than the timescale of
</p>
<p>thermal adjustment. As we will see later, just the opposite is the case here, during
</p>
<p>the earliest phases of star formation.
</p>
<p>26.1 The Jeans Criterion
</p>
<p>26.1.1 An Infinite Homogeneous Medium
</p>
<p>We start with an infinite homogeneous gas at rest. Then density and temperature
</p>
<p>are constant everywhere. However, we must be aware that this state is not a well-
</p>
<p>defined equilibrium. For symmetry reasons the gravitational potential ˚ must also
</p>
<p>be constant. But then Poisson&rsquo;s equation r 2˚ D 4�G% demands % D 0. Indeed
the gravitational stability behaviour should be discussed starting from a better
</p>
<p>equilibrium state, as we will do later. Nevertheless we first assume a medium
</p>
<p>of constant non-vanishing density. If we here apply periodic perturbations of
</p>
<p>sufficiently small wavelength, the single perturbation will behave approximately
</p>
<p>like one with the same wavelength in an isothermal sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium
</p>
<p>(which is a well-defined initial state).

<p>on the right-hand side of (26.16) can differ.
</p>
<p>For our special choice of perturbations the case of instability can be described as

</p>
<p>26.1.2 A Plane-Parallel Layer in Hydrostatic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>We have already mentioned the contradictions connected with the assumption of an
</p>
<p>infinite homogeneous gas as initial condition. One way out of this difficulty is to
</p>
<p>investigate the equilibrium of an isothermal plane-parallel layer stratified according
</p>
<p>to hydrostatic equilibrium in the z direction. Perpendicular to the z direction
</p>
<p>all functions are constant, the layer extending to infinity. This defines a one-
</p>
<p>dimensional problem: %0; P0; T0 depend only on one coordinate, say z. Poisson&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>equation then is

<p>d z2

<p>while hydrostatic equilibrium, dP0=d z D �%0d˚0=d z, can be written with (26.4)

</p>
<p>homogeneous gas.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.2 Instability in the Spherical Case 303
</p>
<p>In order to investigate the stability of this disc one defines cartesian coordinates
</p>
<p>x; y in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis and considers perturbations of the form
</p>
<p>%1 � f .z/ exp Œi.kx C !t/&#141;. Since the perturbations do not depend on y the layer
collapses in the x-direction to a set of plane-parallel &ldquo;sticks&rdquo; in y-direction in the
</p>
<p>case of instability. We shall not go into the details of the stability analysis, which
</p>
<p>has been described by Spitzer (1968). The result is that again there is a critical wave

</p>
<p>kJ D

</p>
<p>H
D Œ2�G%0.0/&#141;
</p>

</p>
<p>vs
(26.22)
</p>
<p>and that instability occurs for wave numbers k &lt; kJ, while perturbations with
</p>
<p>k &gt; kJ remain finite. This is very similar to what we have obtained in the
</p>
<p>homogeneous case, as can be seen by comparing (26.22) and (26.14). The difference
</p>
<p>in the numerical factors is due to the different geometry.
</p>
<p>The two cases discussed above have in common that for smaller wave numbers
</p>
<p>(larger wavelengths and therefore larger amounts of mass involved in the resulting
</p>
<p>collapse) the equilibrium is unstable, while for larger wave numbers, it is stable. In
</p>
<p>hydrostatic equilibrium the force due to the pressure gradient and the gravitational
</p>
<p>force cancel each other. In general this balance is disturbed after a slight compres-
</p>
<p>sion. If only a small amount of mass is compressed, the pressure increases more
</p>
<p>than the force due to gravity, and the gas is pushed back towards the equilibrium
</p>
<p>state. This is the case if a toy balloon is slightly compressed. Only the increase of
</p>
<p>pressure counts, since the gravity of the trapped gas is negligible. The same is true
</p>
<p>for the compressions which occur in sound waves where gravity plays no role. But
</p>
<p>if a sufficient amount of gas is compressed simultaneously, the increase of gravity
</p>
<p>overcomes that of pressure and makes the compressed gas contract even more.
</p>
<p>26.2 Instability in the Spherical Case
</p>
<p>In order to investigate the Jeans instability for interstellar gas in a configurationmore
</p>
<p>realistic than the two examples of Sect. 26.1, we now consider an isothermal sphere
</p>
<p>of finite radius imbedded in a medium of pressure P � &gt; 0. The sphere is supposed
to consist of an ideal gas. The structure of the sphere can be obtained from a solution
</p>
<p>of the Lane&ndash;Emden equation (19.35) for an isothermal polytrope. The solution is cut
</p>
<p>off at a certain radius where P has dropped to the surface pressure P D P �. The
stratification outside the sphere is not relevant as long as it is spherically symmetric
</p>
<p>with respect to the centre, since then there is no gravitational influence of the outside
</p>
<p>on the inside. Its only influence will be via the surface pressure, which we assume
</p>
<p>to be constant during the perturbation.
</p>
<p>The essential points of this problem can be easily seen if one discusses the virial
</p>
<p>theorem for the sphere, as described in Sect. 3.4. Since our sphere of mass M and
</p>
<p>radius R is isothermal, its internal energy is Ei D cvMT . For the gravitational
energy we write Eg D ��GM 2=R, where � is a factor of order one. It can be</p>

example, its value would be 6/7; for the homogenous sphere with n D 0, � D 3=5,
and for an n D 3 polytrope (see Sect. 19.4) it is 1.5. Here, however, we use it as a
general factor that depends on the actual density distribution within the sphere. With
</p>
<p>these expressions and with � D 2 [ideal monatomic gas; (3.8)] the virial theorem
(3.21) can be solved for the surface pressure P0 giving

</p>
<p>The first term on the right is due to the internal gas pressure, which tries to expand
</p>
<p>the sphere. It is proportional to the mean density. The second term is due to the
</p>
<p>self-gravity of the sphere, which tries to bring all matter to the centre.
</p>
<p>At this point we introduce two scaling factors for radius and pressure which allow

<p>306 26 The Onset of Star Formation
</p>
<p>The scaling values % D 10�19 g cm�3 and T D 10K are typical for the conditions
in star-forming clumps within interstellar clouds. We assumed that all hydrogen
</p>
<p>is in molecular form and helium is neutral, and therefore � � 2:3. We thus obtain
MJ � 1:1Mˇ as the typical mass of a clump of molecular gas fromwhich stars form
because of the Jeans instability. The typical Jeans mass for the molecular cloud as
</p>
<p>a whole, with % � 10�24 g cm�3 and T � 100K, would be around 105Mˇ, which
indeed is in the range of molecular cloud masses. However, it is believed that not
</p>
<p>the cloud as a whole collapses, but rather that turbulence within the cloud leads to
</p>
<p>overdense condensations with the conditions outlined above, which then collapse
</p>
<p>due to the Jeans instability and which may fragment further to form stars of even
</p>
<p>lower mass.
</p>
<p>Equation (26.31) exists in various forms, which differ in the numerical factors.
</p>
<p>This can be the result of different assumptions about �, or � not being equal to
</p>
<p>2. For example, for a bimolecular gas, it would be 6/5. Sometimes also half of the
</p>
<p>Jeans wavelength �J is used instead of Rm. All this can amount to a variation of the
</p>
<p>typical Jeans mass by a factor of a few.
</p>
<p>We have already shown, following (26.16), that the timescale for the growth of
</p>
<p>the instability is � � .G%/�1=2, the free-fall time. This is of course also valid for
the present spherical case. For a density of % � 10�19 g cm�3, the collapse takes
place on a timescale of some 105 years. During collapse, � becomes shorter, since
</p>
<p>the density increases.
</p>
<p>This timescale � is long compared to that for thermal adjustment �adj. Since the
</p>
<p>cloud is optically thin, �adj is the internal energy per unit mass divided by the rate of
</p>
<p>energy losses owing to radiation. For typical neutral hydrogen clouds, Spitzer (1968)
</p>
<p>and Low and Lynden-Bell (1976) estimate a loss� of the order 1 erg g �1 s�1. With
T D 10K we find �adj � cvT=� � 10 years. Comparison with the free-fall time
of some 105 years shows that the collapse proceeds in thermal adjustment (which
</p>
<p>turns out to mean that it is almost isothermal). In Sect. 26.3 we will show where this
</p>
<p>breaks down. As a rough estimate a molecular cloud is optically thin for particle
</p>
<p>densities below 10�10cm�3, or mass densities below 10�14 g cm�3, and optically
thick, if the density is higher.
</p>
<p>So far, the external pressure P � has not entered our discussion, because we have
asked for the maximum pressure for given massM at the cut-off radius R. If P.R/
</p>
<p>is given by the external pressure P �, one can turn around the question and ask
for the maximum mass an isothermal sphere of given T andM can have before it
</p>
<p>has to collapse. Such a sphere is called Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and the critical mass,
</p>
<p>the Bonnor-Ebert massMBE, is given here without derivation (Ebert 1955; Bonner

<p>26.3 Fragmentation 307
</p>
<p>26.3 Fragmentation
</p>
<p>For a long time it was believed that large molecular clouds of 104 � � � 105Mˇ
were collapsing because they exceeded their Jeans mass. To actually form stars
</p>
<p>of much lower mass from such clouds, fragmentation into smaller clumps, which
</p>
<p>are collapsing faster than the cloud as a whole, is required. Due to progress of
</p>
<p>theories, numerical simulations, and observations of molecular clouds the picture
</p>
<p>has changed. Molecular clouds are highly turbulent, with supersonic motions of gas
</p>
<p>streams depositing kinetic energy into the cloud, stabilizing it against gravitational
</p>
<p>collapse. The same shock waves, on smaller scales, result in a local compression
</p>
<p>of gas. This process is called gravoturbulent cloud fragmentation (Mac Low and
</p>
<p>Klessen 2004) and leads to overdense gas filaments and clumps. Some of them
</p>
<p>remain gravitationally bound and may collapse if they exceed their Jeans mass.
</p>
<p>Even then, the question remains whether out of clumps of several solar masses
</p>
<p>many stars of lower mass can form, or how stars with masses below 1Mˇ are
formed. Under what circumstances can fragments of a collapsing cloud become
</p>
<p>unstable and collapse faster than the cloud?
</p>
<p>At first glance it seems to be a natural mechanism for producing collapsing
</p>
<p>objects with masses smaller than the initial MJ. Indeed, if a clump collapses
</p>
<p>isothermally, then MJ decreases as %
�1=2. If, however, the gas were to change
</p>
<p>adiabatically, then for a monatomic ideal gas, rad D .d ln T=d lnP/ad D 2=5
or T � P 2=5, and from P � %T , the temperature would change as T � %2=3,
and therefore MJ � T 3=2%�1=2 � %1=2 . So the Jeans mass would grow during
an adiabatic collapse. But already in Sect. 26.2 we have seen that under interstellar
</p>
<p>conditions the thermal adjustment timescale is much shorter than the free-fall time,
</p>
<p>which is of the order .G%/�1=2, and this also holds when the density increases
during collapse. One can therefore assume the collapse to be isothermal rather than
</p>
<p>adiabatic. Then the Jeans mass becomes smaller than the mass of the originally
</p>
<p>collapsing cloud. If it has dropped, say, to one half its original value, the clump can
</p>
<p>split into two independently collapsing parts. This kind of fragmentation can go on
</p>
<p>as long as the collapse remains roughly isothermal. It will stop as soon as matter
</p>
<p>becomes opaque and the heat gained by gravothermal contraction can no longer
</p>
<p>be radiated away (Note that in principle it is not justified to apply the concept of
</p>
<p>the Jeans mass to an already collapsing medium, since it has been derived for an
</p>
<p>equilibrium state. But we may do it for order-of-magnitude estimates.).
</p>
<p>What are the final products of this fragmentation process? Will the collapsing
</p>
<p>clump finally fall apart into a swarm of clumplets of planetary masses or even
</p>
<p>smaller? Even detailed multidimensional simulations of the hydrodynamics and
</p>
<p>thermodynamics of this complicated process cannot follow it in all details. But
</p>
<p>we may just estimate when the thermal adjustment time of the fragments becomes
</p>
<p>comparable with the free-fall time. Then the collapse can certainly not be isothermal
</p>
<p>anymore and must approach an adiabatic one. As we have seen, then the Jeans mass
</p>
<p>no longer decreases with increasing %. This means that subregions of the fragments
</p>
<p>do not fall together on their own and fragmentation stops.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>308 26 The Onset of Star Formation
</p>
<p>For a detailed estimate, one has to know the radiation processes that cool the
</p>
<p>gas during collapse. One can then find how long the gained work �Pdv can be
radiated away, as is done in modern radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of star
</p>
<p>formation. Instead, we give a rough estimate of the mass limit of fragmentation
</p>
<p>based on simple physical arguments, following Rees (1976), without specifying the
</p>
<p>detailed radiation processes.
</p>
<p>The characteristic time of the free-fall of a fragment is .G%/�1=2, and the total
energy to be radiated away during collapse is of the order of the gravitational energy
</p>
<p>Eg � GM 2=R (see Sect. 3.1), where M and R are the mass and radius of the
fragment. Therefore the rate A of energy to be radiated away in order to keep the
</p>
<p>fragment always at the same temperature is of the order

<p>temperature (This implies approximate thermal equilibrium, which is not too bad

<p>an assumption for the final stage of fragmentation, where matter starts to become

<p>26.3 Fragmentation 309
</p>
<p>Let us assume that the temperature T of the smallest elements is 10K and,
</p>
<p>further, that appreciable deviations from isothermal collapse occur when the
</p>
<p>radiation losses have to exceed 10% of the maximal possible (black-body) radiation
</p>
<p>losses (f D 0:1). We then find from (26.37) that M � 0:001Mˇ. This rough
estimate is surprisingly close to the mass of the smallest optically thick, pressure-
</p>
<p>supported protostellar cores that were found in numerical simulations. These objects
</p>
<p>in fact grow in mass by accretion from the surrounding clump.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that our result is dependent on the chemical composition
</p>
<p>because the efficiency of cooling is higher the more heavy elements with rich
</p>
<p>spectral line systems are present. In particular for stars of the first generation, which
</p>
<p>are formed shortly after the Big Bang (also called Population III stars), cooling
</p>
<p>is very inefficient and proceeds mainly via hydrogen molecules, which are even
</p>
<p>dissociated easily at temperatures around 2,000K. As a consequence, the smallest
</p>
<p>condensations in a collapsing cloud of primordial material is of the order of 100Mˇ
(see Bromm and Larson 2004 for a review on first stars).
</p>
<p>In the above considerations a number of complicating effects have been ignored.
</p>
<p>The role of magnetic fields is manifold. They may stabilize clouds against collapse,
</p>
<p>as long as there are ions in the gas, but are usually found to be too weak to do
</p>
<p>so. However, they may help to mediate the angular momentum problem, which
</p>
<p>is due to the fact that the initially present angular momentum in the cloud works
</p>
<p>against gravitational collapse. Magnetic fields may allow the transport of angular
</p>
<p>momentum away from collapsing clumps. Nevertheless, matter does not accrete
</p>
<p>spherically onto the smallest condensation objects, but accumulates in an accretion
</p>
<p>disc around it. Disc, protostellar object, and surrounding matter interact in a
</p>
<p>complicated way through matter in- and outflow, where magnetic fields and angular
</p>
<p>momentum influence the geometrical shape and efficiency. Magnetic fields also
</p>
<p>appear to help in keeping clumps together, after the effects of turbulence, which
</p>
<p>has created them in the first place, have faded. Zinnecker and Yorke (2007) as well

</p>
<p>The Formation of Protostars
</p>
<p>The Jeans criterion derived in the foregoing section follows from a first-order per-
</p>
<p>turbation theory and gives conditions under which perturbations of an equilibrium
</p>
<p>stage will grow exponentially. But the linear theory does not give information, for
</p>
<p>instance, about the fully developed collapse, to say nothing about the final product.
</p>
<p>For this, one has to follow the perturbation into the non-linear regime. We first
</p>
<p>begin with some very simple cases, assuming always spherical symmetry for the
</p>
<p>collapsing cloud.
</p>
<p>27.1 Free-Fall Collapse of a Homogeneous Sphere
</p>
<p>If, according to the Jeans criterion, a gaseous mass has become unstable and the
</p>
<p>collapse has started, gravity increases relatively more than the pressure gradient.
</p>
<p>The collapse is more and more governed by gravity alone, which is easily seen from
</p>
<p>the following arguments. For spherical symmetry, the gravitational acceleration is
</p>
<p>of the order GM=R2, whereM and R are the mass and radius of the cloud. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, an estimate of the acceleration due to the pressure gradient is

<p>The ratio of gravitational force to pressure gradient is therefore �M=.RT /, which
during isothermal collapse increases as 1=R. Consequently we here neglect the gas

</p>
<p>The free collapse of a homogeneous sphere can be treated analytically. At a
</p>
<p>distance r from the centre the gravitational acceleration is Gm=r2, where m is the

Of course, before the centre is reached the pressure will become relevant as the

<p>gas becomes opaque and T increases. Then the free-fall approximation has to be
</p>
<p>abandoned, and finally the collapse will be stopped.
</p>
<p>27.2 Collapse onto a Condensed Object
</p>
<p>As the collapsing cloud becomes opaque the heating will first start in the central
</p>
<p>parts, since radiation can escapemore easily from gas near the surface. Therefore the
</p>
<p>collapse will be stopped first in the central region. In order to see what then happens
</p>
<p>we consider a core which has already reached hydrostatic equilibrium, surrounded
</p>
<p>by a still-free-falling cloud. We emphasize that usually matter carries angular
</p>
<p>momentum, which is conserved, with the result that matter is first accumulated in
</p>
<p>an accretion disc around the central object, from where it finally flows onto the
</p>
<p>accreting body. This fact is ignored here.
</p>
<p>Now let M be the mass of the core. For the sake of simplicity we neglect the
</p>
<p>self-gravity of the free-falling matter. The simplest case is that for the steady state.
</p>
<p>This would mean that the core is surrounded by an infinite reservoir of matter from
</p>
<p>which a steady flow rains down. Then the mass flow with absolute radial velocity v,

<p>27.3 A Collapse Calculation
</p>
<p>The collapse of an unstable interstellar cloud can in principle be followed numer-
</p>
<p>ically. We will describe the first, meanwhile classical collapse calculations of a
</p>
<p>spherical, homogeneous cloud of one solar mass by Larson (1969). Although in the
</p>
<p>meantime three-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations have become possible,
</p>
<p>Larson&rsquo;s work is nicely illustrating basic effects and remains conceptionally very
</p>
<p>instructive. Modern one-dimensional calculations (e.g. Ogino et al. 1999) of
</p>
<p>collapsing Bonnor-Ebert spheres (see Sect. 26.2) give in fact results very similar
</p>
<p>to Larson&rsquo;s original models. The mass fractions of hydrogen, helium, and heavier
</p>
<p>elements were taken to be X D 0:651, Y D 0:324, and Z D 0:025, respectively.
The boundary conditions assumed that the surface of the sphere remained fixed. The

</p>
<p>For the absorption properties of a gas at extremely low temperatures, other effects
</p>
<p>than those due to atomic absorption and scattering discussed in Chap. 17 have to be
</p>
<p>considered. As long as they exist, dust grains are the dominant source of opacity.
</p>
<p>With increasing temperature (above 1,000K) the dust particles evaporate. Then
</p>
<p>the collapsing material becomes more transparent, the opacity being dominated by
</p>
<p>molecules (Sect. 17.8).
</p>
<p>With (27.17)&ndash;(27.21), one has five equations for the five unknown variables
</p>
<p>m.r , t), v.r , t), P.r , t), T .r , t), and l(r , t), while %; �, and u are given material
</p>
<p>functions of, say,P and T . The equation of state is assumed to be that of an ideal gas
</p>
<p>(including effects of dissociation and ionization). The numerical solution now has to
</p>
<p>be determined with one of the methods described in Sect. 12.3. The outer boundary
</p>
<p>condition at r D R in these calculations is v.R; t/ D 0. Since the equations show
a singularity at the centre, one has to demand as inner boundary condition that
</p>
<p>the solutions remain regular there. The initial conditions are v.r; 0/ D 0, while
P.r; 0/ and T .r; 0/ are constant, and therefore l.r; 0/ D 0. The initial values were
T .r; 0/ D 10K, %.r; 0/ � 10�19 g/cm3. It should be noted that then almost all
hydrogen is in molecular form. These are exactly the conditions we used for the
</p>
<p>derivation of the typical Jeans mass for a realistic collapsing clump in Sect. 26.2.
</p>
<p>In order to have instability at the beginning, the cloud of one solar mass must be
</p>
<p>sufficiently dense and therefore small. Instability was found numerically by Larson
</p>
<p>(1969) for R &lt; 0:46GM�=.&lt;T /. The close resemblance to the critical radius
(26.27) for homologous collapse should be noted. The calculations began with a
</p>
<p>slightly compressed cloud with R D 1:63� 1017 cm. With the density 10�19 g cm�3
the free-fall time is 6:6 � 1012 s � 210; 000 years, according to (27.10), where we
already estimated such a value.
</p>
<p>In the following we describe the different phases of the collapse.
</p>
<p>27.4 The Optically Thin Phase and the Formation
</p>
<p>of a Hydrostatic Core
</p>
<p>In the very first phase the whole collapsing cloud remains optically thin and
</p>
<p>therefore nearly isothermal with T � 10K.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>316 27 The Formation of Protostars
</p>
<p>When the instability evolves into the non-linear regime the collapse becomes
</p>
<p>non-homologous, which is not surprising in view of the outer boundary condition.
</p>
<p>It holds the outer layers of the sphere at a fixed radius while the inner part is
</p>
<p>free to collapse. Indeed during collapse the density increases rapidly in the central
</p>
<p>part, while it remains practically constant in the outer regions. A small central
</p>
<p>concentration, once formed, will necessarily enhance itself. The free-fall time of
</p>
<p>a certain mass shell at distance r from the centre is of the order ŒG N%.r/&#141;�1=2, where
N%.r/ is the mean density inside the sphere of radius r . If N% increases towards the
centre, then the (local) free-fall time decreases in this direction. Therefore the inner
</p>
<p>shells fall faster than the outer ones, and the central density concentration becomes
</p>
<p>even more pronounced.
</p>
<p>The calculations show that the density distribution&ndash;starting from % D constant&ndash;
approaches the form % � r�2 over gradually increasing parts of the cloud (see
Fig. 27.1). It is not surprising that it does not follow (27.14), since there we have
</p>
<p>made assumptions (steady state, a free fall determined only by the gravity of a
</p>
<p>central object, ignoring gas pressure) which are not fulfilled here.
</p>
<p>The density profiles in Fig. 27.1 can be described as follows. A smaller and
</p>
<p>smaller homogeneous mass collapses more and more rapidly, continuously leaving
</p>
<p>behind more matter in the inhomogeneously contracting envelope. There the
</p>
<p>timescale of collapse remains much larger because (1) the density is smaller and
</p>
<p>(2) pressure gradients brake the free fall.
</p>
<p>The collapse of the homogeneous central part resembles a free fall as long as
</p>
<p>the matter can get rid of the released gravitational energy via radiation. The central
</p>
<p>region becomes opaque once a central density of 10�13 g cm�3 is reached. Now the
further increase of density in the centre causes an adiabatic increase of temperature.
</p>
<p>As a consequence the pressure there increases until the free fall is stopped.
</p>
<p>This leads to the formation of a central core in hydrostatic equilibrium sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by a still-falling envelope. Immediately after the core has reached hydro-
</p>
<p>static equilibrium, its mass and radius are 1031 g and 6 � 1013 cm, similar to the
values estimated in Sect. 26.3 for the Jeans mass at the end of fragmentation, and
</p>
<p>the central values are %c D 2 � 10�10 g cm�3, Tc D 170K. The free-fall velocity
at the surface of the core is 75 km/s. With increasing core mass and decreasing core
</p>
<p>radius, the velocity of the falling material exceeds the velocity of sound in the core
</p>
<p>surface regions. Therefore a spherical shock front is formed which separates the
</p>
<p>supersonic &ldquo;rain&rdquo; from the hydrostatic interior. In this shock front the falling matter
</p>
<p>comes to rest, releasing its kinetic energy. If all the energy released is radiated away
</p>
<p>(which is approximately the case), the luminosity of the accreting core is given by
</p>
<p>(27.15).
</p>
<p>In certain respects the hydrostatic core resembles a star. But while the surface
</p>
<p>pressure is virtually zero for a star, here it has to balance the pressure exerted by
</p>
<p>the infalling material. If ve and %e are the velocity relative to the shock front and the
</p>
<p>density of the falling gas just above it, respectively, and if Pi is the surface pressure,
</p>
<p>then conservation of momentum demands that</p>

</p>
<p>p. 320) according to which the quantity P C%v2 must have the same values on both
sides of the front. In (27.22) P is neglected outside the front and v inside.
</p>
<p>Another difference between an accreting core and a real star is that the accretion
</p>
<p>energy is released in a thin surface layer, while in a star, the energy source is in the
</p>
<p>deep interior.
</p>
<p>At first glance one would expect the whole core to be isothermal. But while mat-
</p>
<p>ter is raining down on its surface the core is contracting. This has the consequence
</p>
<p>that Laccr as given by (27.15) increases for PM � constant (since M grows and
R decreases). Since during contraction gravitational energy is released in the deep
</p>
<p>interior of the core, there must be a finite temperature gradient in order to transport
</p>
<p>this energy outwards. The diameter of the accreting core in hydrostatic equilibrium
</p>
<p>is already comparable to the dimensions of the solar system (see Fig. 27.2).
</p>
<p>27.5 Core Collapse
</p>
<p>The accreting hydrostatic core heats up in its interior. We have to keep in mind
</p>
<p>that the gas consists mainly of hydrogen that at low temperatures is in molecular
</p>
<p>form as H2. When the central temperature reaches about 2,000K, the hydrogen</p>

</p>
<p>interface between the core, which is in hydrostatic equilibrium, and the still freely falling envelope.
</p>
<p>(b) When the core has become dynamically unstable owing to dissociation of H2, a second collapse

</p>
<p>fronts are characterized by steep (positive) slopes in the velocity curve
</p>
<p>molecules dissociate. The equilibrium between molecular and atomic hydrogen
</p>
<p>is governed by an equation similar to the Saha equation (see Sect. 14.1). Like
</p>
<p>ionization, dissociation influences the specific heat, since not all the energy injected
</p>
<p>into a gas goes into kinetic energy, a fraction being used to break up the molecules
</p>
<p>into atoms. This decreases &#13;ad. For hydrogen molecules there are f D 5 degrees
of freedom, three belonging to translation and two to rotation around two possible
</p>
<p>axes. Consequently &#13;ad D .f C 2/=f D 7=5 D 1:40: This is much closer to the
critical value 4=3 D 1:33 (see Sect. 25.3.2) than in the case of a monatomic gas
.&#13;ad D 5=3 D 1:667/. Only a slight reduction of &#13;ad owing to dissociation therefore
brings it below the critical value 4=3. Then the hydrostatic equilibrium becomes
</p>
<p>dynamically unstable, and the core starts to collapse again.
</p>
<p>In Larson&rsquo;s calculations this happened when the core has, compared to the initial
</p>
<p>values, twice the mass and half the radius. It collapses as long as the gas is partially
</p>
<p>dissociated. When almost all hydrogen in the central region is in atomic form,
</p>
<p>&#13;ad increases above 4=3 (approaching the value 5=3 for a monatomic gas) and the
</p>
<p>collapsing core forms a dynamically stable subcore in its interior. This core, which
</p>
<p>is generally called protostar has an initial mass of 1:5 � 10�3Mˇ and an initial
radius of 1:3Rˇ. Its central density is 2�10�2 g cm�3 and the central temperature is</p>

is illustrated in Fig. 27.2b, c. As a consequence of the second collapse the density
</p>
<p>below the outer shock front decreases, and the outer shock finally disappears. More
</p>
<p>recent calculations by Masunaga et al. (1998) and Masunaga and Inutsuka (2000),
</p>
<p>which follow the collapse of a 1Mˇ clump through the whole sequence outlined
above, confirm it to high degree. Their calculations include a better treatment of
</p>
<p>the radiative transport and can follow the collapse for a longer time due to a higher
</p>
<p>spatial resolution. Themain differencewith respect to Fig. 27.2c is that the velocities
</p>
<p>at the second shock front reach final values a factor of 10 higher than shown here,
</p>
<p>while the first shock front has already disappeared. The density profile is, however,
</p>
<p>very similar to that of Larson&rsquo;s original calculation.
</p>
<p>The evolution of the centre of the 1Mˇ cloud, as it results from the radiation-
hydrodynamical simulation by Masunaga and Inutsuka (2000), starting from the
</p>
<p>original Jeans instability, is given in Fig. 27.3. The curve starts on the left during
</p>
<p>the isothermal collapse. After the matter has become opaque, T rises adiabatically.
</p>
<p>The slope is at first close to 0.4 (corresponding to &#13;ad D 1:4 for H2), but then
becomes considerably less owing to partial dissociation (&#13; D 1:1), and finally
approaches 2=3 (corresponding to &#13;ad D 5=3 for a monatomic gas).
</p>
<p>The central compression is adiabatic as long as the accretion timescale �accr
of the core (or of the innermost core, if there are two) is short compared to its

<p>the accretion rate will diminish and consequently �accr will grow. When it exceeds

<p>320 27 The Formation of Protostars
</p>
<p>Fig. 27.4. Sketch of the mass flow within a collapsing protostellar sphere. From the original cloud,
</p>
<p>matter is accreted onto the protostar that sits at the centre of the figure. Because of angular
</p>
<p>momentum conservation, most of it accumulates in an accretion disc. Part of the matter finally
</p>
<p>falling onto the star is however ejected in a bipolar jet along the axis of rotation. The jet also
</p>
<p>may gain additional material directly from the disc due to heating of the inner disc (According to
</p>
<p>Zinnecker and Yorke 2007)
</p>
<p>constant mass. We shall discuss its further evolution with constant M in the next
</p>
<p>section.
</p>
<p>We repeat once more that these calculations were made without considering the
</p>
<p>fact that the angular momentum of the prestellar cloud leads to the formation of an
</p>
<p>accretion disc. Most of the matter falling onto the central protostar has first circled
</p>
<p>the star in this disc.
</p>
<p>At the same time the protostar may start to lose mass due to stellar winds and
</p>
<p>bipolar outflows and jets. All this has already been revealed by observations. The
</p>
<p>interaction between cloud, protostar, and disc is complicated and also depends
</p>
<p>on the presence of magnetic fields. This phase has to be investigated by three-
</p>
<p>dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations (Banerjee and Pudritz 2007). The

<p>situation is illustrated in Fig. 27.4.

<p>60Mˇ. The tracks start at the lower right, where the thermal radiation of the clouds is in the
</p>
<p>infrared, and they finally approach the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS, dot-dashed). In the case
</p>
<p>of 60Mˇ, part of the mass of the envelope is blown away so that a star of only 17Mˇ settles
</p>
<p>down on the main sequence. The corresponding Hayashi lines are indicated by broken lines (After
</p>
<p>Appenzeller and Tscharnuter 1974, 1975a,b)
</p>
<p>results shown in this figure are quite old, the newer calculations by Wuchterl and
</p>
<p>Tscharnuter (2003) have confirmed the overall picture very well. To an outside
</p>
<p>observer the collapsing cloud remains an infrared object as long as the envelope is
</p>
<p>opaque to visible radiation. The evolutionary track, therefore, starts extremely far
</p>
<p>to the right in this diagram. This, of course, is no contradiction to the statements
</p>
<p>about a forbidden region to the right of the Hayashi line (Chap. 24) since the falling
</p>
<p>envelope (including the &ldquo;photosphere&rdquo;) is far from being in hydrostatic equilibrium.
</p>
<p>Even if we could see the already hydrostatic core, we would not observe a normal
</p>
<p>star, since its boundary conditions are still perturbed by infalling matter.
</p>
<p>The thinning out of the envelope has several effects: the first is that it becomes
</p>
<p>more transparent, and the photosphere (� D 2=3) moves downwards until it
has reached the surface of the hydrostatic core. With decreasing radius of the
</p>
<p>photosphere, Teff must increase in order to radiate away the energy. In the whole
</p>
<p>first phase (through the maximum of L in the evolutionary tracks of Fig. 27.5) the
</p>
<p>luminosity is produced by accretion: L D Laccr � PM . With decreasing PM , the
luminosity L decreases until it is finally provided by contraction of the core.
</p>
<p>It is generally found that for low-mass stars accretion onto the protostar stops
</p>
<p>well before central temperatures for hydrogen ignition is reached. For massive stars,
</p>
<p>however, accretion continues while central hydrogen burning has already set in.
</p>
<p>Therefore, when the newborn star finally separates from its surrounding cloud and
</p>
<p>becomes visible it has already consumed part of its hydrogen fuel and has evolved on
</p>
<p>the main sequence. Massive stars are therefore unlikely to be found on the ZAMS.
</p>
<p>Another effect is the influence of accretion on the boundary conditions of the
</p>
<p>core. Strong accretion heats up the surface of the core so much that the core is
</p>
<p>nearly isothermal and the ram pressure %ev

<p>that the fate of such a sphere is mainly determined by the equation of state.
</p>
<p>28.1 Homologous Contraction of a Gaseous Sphere
</p>
<p>A star which has not yet reached the temperature for nuclear burning has to supply
</p>
<p>its energy loss by contraction. This is a consequence of the virial theorem and of
</p>
<p>energy conservation as discussed in Sect. 3.1.We have seen, in particular, that part of
</p>
<p>the released gravitational energy goes into internal energy,while the rest supplies the
</p>
<p>luminosity [see (3.12)]. The characteristic timescale is �KH, as shown in Sect. 3.3.
</p>
<p>In the following we will be concerned with the centre of the star. For this we
</p>
<p>can use the relations of Sect. 20.3, which hold for any mass shell of a homologously
</p>
<p>contracting star. The equation of state (for fixed chemical composition) was written
</p>
<p>there as d%=% D ˛dP=P �ıdT=T . According to (20.34) and (20.38), the variation
of the central temperature, dTc, is related to the variation of the central density, d%c,

below it the arrows point downwards
</p>
<p>Here the slope is 1/3, a contracting ideal gas heats up (the latter conforms with the
</p>
<p>conclusions drawn from the virial theorem in Sect. 3.1). The same slope also holds
</p>
<p>for non-negligible radiation pressure (ˇ &lt; 1) as can be seen if (13.7) is introduced
</p>
<p>into (28.1). In Fig. 28.1 the evolutionary track of a (homologously) contracting ideal

<p>gaseous sphere is a straight line with slope 1/3. This necessarily leads closer to
</p>
<p>the regime of degeneracy, which is separated from that of ideal gas by a line of
</p>
<p>slope 2/3 [see (16.6) and Fig. 16.1]. The onset of degeneracy changes ˛ and ı

<p>and decreases the slope of the arrows in Fig. 28.1. In the limit of complete non-

<p>relativistic degeneracy one has ˛ ! 3=5 and ı ! 0. What happens to a sphere
which is contracting and becomes more and more degenerate? Then ˛ will pass

For the sake of simplicity let us first ignore the fact that nuclear reactions set in
</p>
<p>at certain temperatures. Obviously, the evolutionary track of a contracting gaseous
</p>
<p>sphere in the lg %c&ndash;lgTc diagram depends very much on the starting point at the left-
</p>
<p>hand border, as can be seen from Fig. 28.2. If a stellar centre starts there sufficiently
</p>
<p>low it will reach a maximum temperature and begin to cool again after entering the
</p>
<p>domain of degeneracy. But if it started on the left at a sufficiently high temperature,
</p>
<p>it will never be caught by degeneracy and thus will continue to heat up.
</p>
<p>Which types of spheres do reach a maximum temperature, and which types have
</p>
<p>the privilege of heating up forever? This depends on the mass of the sphere. In order
</p>
<p>to show this we consider two homologous spheres of an ideal gas with masses M
</p>
<p>and M 0 D M=x and radii R and R0 D R=z. Then, according to (20.9), %c=%0c D
xz�3; Pc=P 0c D x2z�4, and therefore, for an ideal gas, Tc=T 0c D x=z. If we now
compare states in which the two spheres have the same central density (xz�3 D 1),

<p>1Since the dash-dotted line in Fig. 28.1 gives the impression of delineating a hill, this kind of
</p>

</p>
<p>evolution of homologously contracting stellar cores.</p>

</p>
<p>we have Tc=T
0
c D x2=3 D .M=M 0/2=3. This means that in Fig. 28.2 the evolutionary
</p>
<p>tracks of larger masses are above those of smaller masses. Consequently it is the less
</p>
<p>massive spheres which will finally be forced by degeneracy to cool off after having
</p>
<p>reached a maximum central temperature, being smaller the smaller the mass.
</p>
<p>This has immediate consequences for the nuclear reactions, which we have
</p>
<p>ignored up to now. We know that a nuclear burning in a wide range of densities
</p>
<p>occurs at a characteristic temperature: hydrogen burning near 107K and helium
</p>
<p>burning at 108K (Since here we are discussing early phases of stellar evolution, we
</p>
<p>exclude the pycnonuclear reactions, which occur at extremely high densities only;
</p>
<p>see Sect. 18.4). One can therefore expect that a contracting sphere below a certain
</p>
<p>critical mass may never reach the temperature of hydrogen burning, since its central
</p>
<p>temperature never reaches 107K. This is the case forM3 in Fig. 28.2.
</p>
<p>This important result deduced from simple homology considerations is also
</p>
<p>manifested in computer calculations of more realistic stellar models. Although the
</p>
<p>cores formed in the protostar phase do not contract completely homologously, their
</p>
<p>centres evolve in the lg %&ndash;lg T plane very similarly. Protostars of mass less than
</p>
<p>about 0:08Mˇ never ignite their hydrogen and thus never become main-sequence
stars. These are the brown dwarfs we already introduced in Sect. 22.4. Here we
</p>
<p>have encountered an evolutionary aspect of the lower end of the main sequence:
</p>
<p>protostars born with too little mass never reach the state of complete equilibrium by
</p>
<p>which the main-sequence models are defined. Even if some nuclear reactions have
</p>
<p>started, they are so slow at these low temperatures that equilibrium abundances (rate
</p>
<p>of destruction = rate of production) of the involved nuclei are not reached even in
</p>
<p>the lifetime of the galaxy.
</p>
<p>We shall see later that analogous considerations can be used to explain critical
</p>
<p>masses for the ignition of each higher nuclear burning in contracting cores of
</p>
<p>evolved stars. Helium burning is not reached by stars of an initial mass below
</p>
<p>approximately 0:5Mˇ; for carbon burning, it has to be above 6Mˇ. And masses
above� 8Mˇ will never be caught by degeneracy in this way (see Sect. 35.2).
</p>
<p>28.2 Approach to the Zero-Age Main Sequence
</p>
<p>We have seen that a contracting star of more than 0.08Mˇ ignites hydrogen in
its centre and becomes a star on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). While the
</p>
<p>luminosity of the star was originally due to contraction, it now originates from
</p>
<p>nuclear energy. These two energy sources are quite differently distributed in the star.
</p>
<p>According to (20.41), "g �T is not so much concentrated towards the centre, while
hydrogen burning with "pp �T 5 and "CNO �T 18 has strong central concentration.
Clearly the transition from contraction to hydrogen burning requires a rearrange-
</p>
<p>ment of the internal structure. The protostar becomes a zero-age main-sequence star
</p>
<p>with properties very close to those described in Chap. 22. The difference arises from
</p>
<p>the fact that some nuclear reactions, for example, the proton captures on 2H, 7Li, or
12C, start at temperatures lower than those of core hydrogen burning.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.2 Approach to the Zero-Age Main Sequence 327
</p>
<p>The way in which nuclear reactions take over the energy production can now
</p>
<p>be followed by detailed numerical models following the approach to the main
</p>
<p>sequence of contracting protostars. We first discuss the results for one solar mass.
</p>
<p>Some reactions of the CNO cycle as given in (18.64) become important before the
</p>
<p>central temperature has reached that of equilibrium hydrogen burning (where the
</p>
<p>participating nuclei have equilibrium abundances). At a central temperature of about
</p>
<p>106K, all the 12C that had been in the interstellar cloud will burn into 14N via the
</p>
<p>reactions of the first three lines in (18.64). However, the following 14N.p; &#13;/15O
</p>
<p>reaction is much slower&ndash;and therefore often called the bottleneck reaction&ndash;such that
</p>
<p>the full CNO cycle cannot be completed. Once switched on, this process will take
</p>
<p>over the energy generation and stop the contraction. Because of the high temperature
</p>
<p>sensitivity of ", the energy is released close to the centre. Consequently the energy
</p>
<p>flux l=4�r2 is large, and a convective core that contains almost 10% of the total
</p>
<p>mass develops. At the same time, the first reactions of the pp chain become relevant,
</p>
<p>transforming H into 3He [see the first two lines of (18.62)]. With decreasing 12C
</p>
<p>the pp reactions become more important, and 3He can be destroyed by 3He+3He
</p>
<p>and 3He+4He [the two reactions in the third line of (18.62)]. As a consequence the
</p>
<p>concentration of 3He reaches a maximum at m D 0:6M . Outside, the temperature
is too low to form 3He, while inside, 3He is used up to form 4He. This characteristic
</p>
<p>shape of the 3He abundance curve remains throughout the main-sequence evolution
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 29.3). With the depletion of 12C in the central region the convective core
</p>
<p>disappears and the pp chain becomes the dominant energy source.
</p>
<p>The situation is similar for more massive stars. But then instead of the pp
</p>
<p>chain, the CNO cycle finally takes over and the abundance of 12C becomes that of
</p>
<p>equilibrium. For stars ofM &gt; 1:5Mˇ the effect of pre-main-sequence 12C burning
can even be seen in the computed evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell
</p>
<p>diagram: there seems to be another, relatively short-lived main sequence to the right
</p>
<p>of the ordinary (hydrogen) main-sequence. Contracting protostars stay there until
</p>
<p>their 12C fuel is used up before they move on to the main sequence. This somewhat
</p>
<p>prolongs the time a protostar needs to reach the ZAMS.
</p>
<p>The numbers quoted here are from pre-main-sequence evolution calculations that
</p>
<p>ignore the detailed results of Chap. 27. They start out with a cool protostar on the
</p>
<p>Hayashi line and follow the ensuing quasi-hydrostatic contraction until the model
</p>
<p>reaches the hydrogen main sequence. The errors introduced by this simplification
</p>
<p>are not too large and certainly become negligible towards the end of pre-main-
</p>
<p>sequence contraction when the thermal history of accretion is forgotten by the star.
</p>
<p>This has to do with the fact that, whatever the thermal history of the protostar, its
</p>
<p>structure has adjusted to thermal equilibrium after a Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz time. Since
</p>
<p>the main-sequence timescale (which is relevant for the ensuing evolution) is much
</p>
<p>longer, the stars settle on the ZAMS quite independently of their past.Whatever their
</p>
<p>detailed history, tracks of protostars of the same mass and chemical composition
</p>
<p>lead to the same point on the ZAMS.
</p>
<p>We now turn to the question of how rapidly stars of different M approach the
</p>
<p>ZAMS. Decisive for this is the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz timescale �KH � cv NTM=L. The
mean temperature NT does not vary too much withM , since Tc is anyway just below</p>

<p>corresponding ZAMS luminosity, since the evolutionary tracks in their final parts
</p>
<p>are at about that luminosity (see Fig. 27.5). Then L �M 3:5 and �KH �M�2:5. This
means that massive protostars reach the ZAMS much faster than their low-mass
</p>
<p>colleagues.
</p>
<p>In the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagrams of very young stellar clusters one finds that
</p>
<p>only massive stars are on the main sequence, while the low-mass stars lie to the
</p>
<p>right of it. As an example we show in Fig. 28.3 the case of NGC 602 (Cignoni et al.

</p>
<p>years (Myrs). From comparison with low-mass pre-main-sequence evolutionary
</p>
<p>tracks and isochrones2 it is obvious that many stars have not yet reached the main
</p>
<p>sequence. Similar cases in the MilkyWay are the Pleiades (80Myrs) and NGC 2264
</p>
<p>(5Myrs). It seems that, because of their longer �KH, these stars are still in the
</p>
<p>contraction phase and have not yet begun with nuclear burning. Among them are
</p>
<p>flare stars (UV Ceti stars), Herbig AE/BE, and T Tauri variables. The cause of their

</p>
<p>From the Initial to the Present Sun
</p>
<p>There is evidence on Earth that the Sun has shone for more than 3,000 million years
</p>
<p>with about the same luminosity. From radioactive decay in different materials of
</p>
<p>the solar system, one nowadays assumes that it was formed 4.57 Gigayears (Gyrs;
</p>
<p>109 years) ago. Since then, the Sun has lived on hydrogen burning, predominantly
</p>
<p>according to the pp chain, and its interior has been appreciably enriched in 4He. In
</p>
<p>the following we show how a model of the present Sun can be constructed.
</p>
<p>29.1 Known Solar Data
</p>
<p>Although the Sun is a very ordinary star of average mass and in a quiet state of
</p>
<p>main-sequence hydrogen burning, it is a unique object for stellar evolution theorists.
</p>
<p>For no other star so many quantities are known with comparable accuracy obtained
</p>
<p>by so many different and independent methods. From Kepler&rsquo;s laws and known
</p>
<p>distances within the solar system we can derive its mass and radius as well as
</p>
<p>the total luminosity. This yields the effective temperature by application of the
</p>
<p>Stefan-Boltzmann law. Neutrino experiments on Earth (see Sect. 29.5) allow the
</p>
<p>determination of conditions in the innermost energy producing core. And the art
</p>
<p>of (helio-)seismology has returned with high accuracy the run of the sound speed
</p>
<p>throughout most of the solar interior, the helium content of the outer convective
</p>
<p>envelope, and its depth. These quantities restrict the modelling of the present Sun
</p>
<p>and allow a comparison with stellar evolution theory at a degree of precision which
</p>
<p>is almost unique in astrophysics. Table 29.1 summarizes the fundamental solar
</p>
<p>parameters and the method to derive them. Note that the rather large uncertainty
</p>
<p>in the solar mass is the result of the uncertainty in Newton&rsquo;s constant of gravity G.
</p>
<p>Kepler&rsquo;s third law returns their combination,GMˇ, with a precision of 10�7!
There is still one significant uncertainty in the solar quantities, and this is
</p>
<p>the present surface (or convective envelope) composition. The determination by
</p>
<p>Grevesse and Noels (1993) was considered to be very close to the real com-
</p>
<p>position, as it also agreed very well with meteoritic values in those elements

</p>
<p>that can be compared. However, new analyses of the solar spectrum (Asplund
</p>
<p>et al. 2005, 2009), done with sophisticated three-dimensional, non-LTE radiation-
</p>
<p>hydrodynamics methods, returned (see Table 29.2) much lower values in particular
</p>
<p>for the volatile elements C, N, and O, which cannot be measured accurately in
</p>
<p>meteorites. The difference is a reduction of the total amount of metals relative to
</p>
<p>hydrogen, (Z=X ), by 30%! The latest revision by Asplund et al. (2009) for the solar
</p>
<p>element composition resulted in somewhat higher abundances than the 2005 values
</p>
<p>but still distinctively lower than the Grevesse and Noels numbers. Consequently, the
</p>
<p>structure of solar models using the 2009 abundances lies between the two other
</p>
<p>cases, which we will present in the following. This issue is not yet settled, but
</p>
<p>since the solar composition is the yardstick for all abundance determinations in
</p>
<p>astrophysics, the outcome will certainly be of great importance.
</p>
<p>As we will see, the older abundance data yielded solar models in very good
</p>
<p>agreement with helioseismology. The lower abundances deteriorate this. In the
</p>
<p>following we will present a standard solar model based on the older Grevesse and
</p>
<p>Noels (1993) abundances, since such a model appears to be closer to the real solar
</p>
<p>structure, even if this could be due to coincidence.
</p>
<p>A standard solar model is derived under the assumptions of spherical symmetry
</p>
<p>and hydrostatic equilibrium, ignoring effects of rotation and the influence of
</p>
<p>magnetic fields. Convection is usually treated in mixing-length theory, and no
</p>
<p>overshooting is assumed. The only effect beyond these most basic assumptions is
</p>
<p>the inclusion of atomic diffusion, since it turned out that models which disregarded
</p>
<p>this disagree more with seismic results. This is true for both sets of solar abundances
</p>
<p>mentioned above.
</p>
<p>A solar model has to match the solar radius, luminosity, and surface abundance
</p>
<p>of metals at the solar age. The evolution is started from the pre-main-sequence
</p>
<p>hydrostatic contraction until the solar age. The mass can be kept fixed because mass
</p>
<p>loss is known to be unimportant.</p>

</p>
<p>29.2 Choosing the Initial Model
</p>
<p>While the observations yield information about the mass abundance Z of heavier
</p>
<p>elements, it is difficult to determine spectroscopically the helium content Y of
</p>
<p>the solar surface. One therefore uses Y as a free parameter. This is actually the
</p>
<p>initial helium content Yi, which will change during the evolution due to the effects
</p>
<p>of nuclear burning and diffusion. Its value cannot be compared directly with an
</p>
<p>observed value. Sedimentation&ndash;the main effect of diffusion&ndash;will also lead to a
</p>
<p>reduction of Z=X with time. Therefore also the initial metallicity Zi has to be
</p>
<p>chosen such that after 4.57 Gyr the present Z=X is obtained. Furthermore, there
</p>
<p>is no information about the mixing length `m to be used in the convection theory
</p>
<p>(see Chap. 7). One normally expresses `m in units of the local pressure scale height
</p>
<p>HP and treats the dimensionless quantity `m=HP as another free parameter.</p>

<p>Fig. 29.1 Finding a model that for given values of Z D 1�X �Y describes the present Sun. For
arbitrary values of Y , `m one obtains a ZAMS model at A, from where it shifts along the broken
</p>
<p>and dotted arrow as a result of independent changes of Y and `m, respectively. Based on this, one
</p>
<p>guesses the values of Y; `m that yield the model at B . Its evolution is calculated from age zero .B/
</p>
<p>to t D 4:57 � 109 years (C ). The guessed values Y; `m are modified until C coincides with D
(present Sun)
</p>
<p>We now sketch the way to obtain a solar model using some simplifications.
</p>
<p>These are not done in numerical calculations, but they allow us to use properties
</p>
<p>of simplified models. We first ignore diffusion. Then .Z=X/i is known from the
</p>
<p>present photospheric abundances. We now start the construction of an initial solar
</p>
<p>model with trial values of Yi and `m=HP . Since the model changes only on the (long)
</p>
<p>nuclear timescale, it can well be approximated by assuming complete equilibrium.
</p>
<p>This means that in addition to the inertia term in (10.2) the time derivatives in the
</p>
<p>energy equation (10.3) can be neglected. The evolution can then be followed from
</p>
<p>the ZAMS until a time of 4:57 � 109 years after the onset of hydrogen burning
has elapsed. During this time interval the molecular weight in the central regions
</p>
<p>increases owing to the enrichment of helium. Consequently, the luminosity increases
</p>
<p>slightly, as can be expected from the homology relation (20.20) according to which
</p>
<p>the luminosity should increase like �4. (The fact that the solar evolution is not
</p>
<p>homologous changes the result only quantitatively.) At the same time, the point
</p>
<p>in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell (HR) diagram moves slightly to the left. If our choice of
</p>
<p>the free parameters were correct, the model after 4:57 � 109 years should resemble
the present Sun. But, in general, this will not be the case, and the evolutionary track
</p>
<p>will miss the image point of the present Sun. One therefore has to adjust the two
</p>
<p>free parameters in order to end up with the present Sun.
</p>
<p>A variation of the mixing length changes the radius slightly, but turns out to have
</p>
<p>almost no influence on the luminosity. Therefore, while varying `m, the initial model
</p>
<p>will move almost horizontally (Fig. 29.1). If, on the other hand, Yi is changed, the
</p>
<p>mean molecular weight � varies. With increasing helium content, � also increases,
</p>
<p>and since the computed models roughly behave as the homologous models of
</p>
<p>Sect. 20.2.2, the image point of the model moves to the upper left on a line below
</p>
<p>the main sequence [see the arguments after (20.23)].
</p>
<p>Since small changes in the two parameters do not modify the form of the
</p>
<p>evolutionary track very much, the whole track makes an approximately parallel</p>

</p>
<p>the standard assumptions for the input physics, is often called a &ldquo;standard solar
</p>
<p>model&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Table 29.3 gives an overview of the partial derivatives @y=@x in the vicinity of the
</p>
<p>final, calibrated solar model, where y corresponds to the solar observable (rows) and
</p>
<p>x to the model parameter (columns). The values were obtained from the solar model
</p>
<p>calculations presented in the next section. While the absolute numbers depend a lot
</p>
<p>on the individual calculation, the relative ratios are very similar for all solar model
</p>
<p>calibrations. Clearly, the initial helium content affects mostly the luminosity and the
</p>
<p>mixing length the radius of the solar model. The initial metallicity Zi has not only
</p>
<p>an obviously direct effect on Z=X but also, due to the change of �, on luminosity.
</p>
<p>The values of the initial Y and `m=HP , which after 4:57 � 109 years lead to the
present Sun, depend sensitively on the details of the computations, for instance, on
</p>
<p>the opacities used and the equation of state applied.
</p>
<p>29.3 A Standard Solar Model
</p>
<p>After the procedure to compute a standard solar model has been outlined, we now
</p>
<p>show the results of such a detailed computation. The final model agrees with the
</p>
<p>present solar luminosity and effective radius (Table 29.1) to 1 part in 104 or better
</p>
<p>and has Z=X D 0:0245 according to the analysis of Grevesse and Noels (1993),
from which also the chemical composition (Table 29.2) was taken. The effect of
</p>
<p>diffusion was included. Up-to-date tables for the equation of state (Sect. 16.6) and
</p>
<p>the opacities (Sect. 17.8) were used, the latter for the same metal composition of
</p>
<p>Grevesse and Noels (1993). The calculation starts with a homogenous pre-main-
</p>
<p>sequence model, since the assumption of a homogenous ZAMS model in complete
</p>
<p>equilibrium would already be too inaccurate (see Sect. 28.2).
</p>
<p>All modern stellar evolution codes using the same physical input data are able
</p>
<p>to produce a standard solar model that reproduces known properties of the Sun at a
</p>
<p>similar accuracy and agree very well with each other.
</p>
<p>The evolution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is shown in Fig. 29.2. It begins
</p>
<p>with a fully convective, contracting pre-main-sequencemodel. At an age of 1.7Myr</p>

</p>
<p>the present age. Ages in million years are indicated along the track. Notice the drastic slowdown
</p>
<p>of the evolution as soon as the nuclear timescale has become the dominant one and the rapid
</p>
<p>pre-main-sequence evolution on thermal timescales during the hydrostatic contraction along the
</p>
<p>Hayashi line. The main-sequence evolution and the phase immediately preceding it are magnified
</p>
<p>in the inset for clarity. The zero-age main sequence of Fig. 22.1 is shown as well. Since the solar
</p>
<p>composition is not exactly the same, the evolutionary path of the Sun is slightly offset from this
</p>
<p>ZAMS
</p>
<p>the centre begins to become radiative; at that time logL=Lˇ has already dropped to
0.163. The evolution slows down considerably in the following. At 28.3Myr and a
</p>
<p>luminosity of logL=Lˇ D �0:038 and logTeff D 3:748 a transient convective core
begins to develop due to the strongly peaked energy release of the CN conversion.
</p>
<p>It lasts for about 120Myr at which time the luminosity minimum has been reached.
</p>
<p>From there on the evolution proceeds on the very long nuclear timescale as the very
</p>
<p>short linear part of the track that ends at the solar position.
</p>
<p>The initial homogeneous composition of this standard solar model is Xi D
0:7058, Yi D 0:2743, and Zi D 0:0199. Z=X therefore was initially 0.0282 and
has dropped at the photosphere to 0.0245 due to the settling of all heavier elements
</p>
<p>and the corresponding increase of hydrogen in the convective envelope. This effect
</p>
<p>is visible in Fig. 29.3, where the hydrogen and metal content X and Z as functions
</p>
<p>of m=M are plotted; the final surface hydrogen abundance is 0.7377 and that of
</p>
<p>metals 0.0181. They are higher, respectively lower than the initial ones because of
</p>
<p>the sedimentation of all elements heavier than hydrogen below the thin convective
</p>
<p>envelope. This leads to the sudden increase of hydrogen abundance to the higher
</p>
<p>and constant value in the convectively mixed outermost layers. Accordingly, the
</p>
<p>abundance of metals (dashed curve in Fig. 29.3) decreases at the beginning of the
</p>
<p>convective envelope.
</p>
<p>In the central region of the present Sun, quite an appreciable percentage of the
</p>
<p>original hydrogen has already been converted into helium. The central value of X
</p>
<p>has dropped to 0.338. The abundance of 3He, also shown in Fig. 29.4, displays
</p>
<p>the characteristic shape discussed in Sect. 28.2 due to its evolution towards an
</p>
<p>equilibrium value within the pp chain.</p>

<p>in the homogeneous model were 0.7058, respectively 0.0199. The increase in X and the decrease
</p>
<p>in Z in the outermost regions is due to the effect of diffusion
</p>
<p>Some details of the solar structure are shown in Fig. 29.4. The left panel shows
</p>
<p>the concentration of mass. More than 80% are contained within 40% of the solar
</p>
<p>radius or just 6.4% of the volume. Temperature rises over two orders of magnitude
</p>
<p>within the outermost 20% of the radius, but then only by another factor of ten
</p>
<p>until the centre. Pressure and density profiles have a similar shape like that of
</p>
<p>temperature. In the right panel the strongly peaked energy generation is shown,
</p>
<p>which results in the fact that over 90% of the total luminosity are reached already at
</p>
<p>r=Rˇ D 0:2, corresponding to a mass coordinate of only 0.3. Note the similarity of
the solar structure to that of the 1Mˇ ZAMS model of Fig. 22.4. Although the Sun
has burnt hydrogen for almost 5 billion years, it still has the shape of a young star.
</p>
<p>Had we used the abundances of Asplund et al. (2005; middle column in
</p>
<p>Table 29.2) with the corresponding present value for Z=X of 0.0165, the structure
</p>
<p>of that solar model would hardly be distinguishable from the one shown in Fig. 29.4.
</p>
<p>However, initial and present composition would be different: the initial abundances
</p>
<p>in that case are Xi D 0:7261, Yi D 0:2599, and Zi D 0:0140, and the present solar
surface values are X D 0:7578, Y D 0:2297, and Z D 0:0125.
</p>
<p>The outer convective zone of our standard solar model reaches down to a

and the corresponding mass is 0:9761Mˇ.
</p>
<p>The temperature gradients r; rad, and rrad as defined in Chaps. 5&ndash;7 are plotted
in Fig. 29.5. In the near-surface regions where lgP &lt; 5:0, one finds rrad &lt; rad and
the layer is stable (Fig. 29.5a). Then convection sets in where rrad exceeds rad. In
the outermost part of the convective zone the convection is very ineffective and r
is close to rrad, according to the considerations in Sect. 7.3. But r does not follow</p>

<p>29.4 Results of Helioseismology
</p>
<p>It is not surprising that one can produce models for the present Sun which have
</p>
<p>the correct position in the HR diagram, since three free parameters, Yi, `m and Zi,
</p>
<p>can be varied to adjust the quantities L, R, and Z=X . Therefore obtaining a solar
</p>
<p>model with the right age at the right position in the HR diagram and the right surface
</p>
<p>composition is not much of a test of stellar evolution theory.
</p>
<p>At present there are two observational tests to compare the solar interior with
</p>
<p>model calculations. One are solar neutrino experiments, which will be discussed in
</p>
<p>the next section. They test the conditions at the solar centre, where nuclear reactions
</p>
<p>take place. The other one allows an almost complete &ldquo;view&rdquo; of the solar interior
</p>
<p>and is based on the investigation of non-radial solar oscillations, commonly called
</p>
<p>helioseismology. We shall deal with such oscillations later (see Sect. 42.4). For the
</p>
<p>moment it is sufficient to state that the frequencies of thousands of non-radial solar
</p>
<p>oscillation modes, measured with extremely high precision, depend in particular on
</p>
<p>the sound speed profile throughout the Sun. In the following we discuss the most
</p>
<p>important results for the solar interior.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Fig. 29.5 Some properties of the model for the present Sun described in the text. (a) The
</p>
<p>temperature gradients in the outer layers, against the pressure P (in dyn cm�2/. In the outermost
</p>
<p>layers the actual gradient r (gray-shaded line) coincides with rrad (dashed line), which then,
however, goes up to values above the range of the ordinate. The strong depression of rad (lower
short-dashed line) for lg P &gt; 5 is due to hydrogen ionization. (b) The same curves as in (a) but
</p>
<p>with compressed scales, such that the whole interior of the model is covered. rrad is still out of the
range for almost all of the outer convective zone. The depression of rad is caused by the ionization
of H, He, and HeC (at values of lgP around 6, 8, and 10). Note that the centre of the Sun is close
</p>
<p>to convective instability. (c) The convective velocity v in units of the local velocity of sound, vs, in
</p>
<p>the outer convective zone of the Sun
</p>
<p>The first one is that the transition from the nearly adiabatic temperature gradient
</p>
<p>to the radiative one at the bottom of the convective zone leaves a significant change
</p>
<p>in the slope of the square of the sound speed divided by the gravitational acceleration
</p>
<p>(Gough 1986). This allows a very accurate determination of the bottom of the
</p>
<p>convective envelope, which is at 0:713˙ 0:001Rˇ. The solar model of Sect. 29.3
has exactly the same depth of the convective zone. The solar model with the newer
</p>
<p>abundance determination, in contrast, is convective to 0:731Rˇ. This would favour
the older abundances, provided that the physical input (equation of state, opacities,
</p>
<p>diffusion theory) is correct.
</p>
<p>The second envelope quantity that can be determined by seismology is the
</p>
<p>envelope helium content and is based on the fact that the quantity �1, defined
</p>
<p>in (13.18), depends on the chemical composition and therefore allows the
</p>
<p>determination of the helium abundance as the ionization of helium modifies �1.</p>

<p>Fig. 29.6. The difference in sound speed c between that of the standard solar model computed in
</p>
<p>this chapter (&ldquo;model&rdquo;) and that determined by helioseismology (&ldquo;sun&rdquo;; grey shaded line). Using
</p>
<p>the more recent abundance determination by Asplund et al. (2005) results in a larger difference
</p>
<p>(dotted line). The vertical line denotes the lower boundary of the convective envelope
</p>
<p>The result is Y D 0:246 ˙ 0:005, where for the error we have also considered
possible systematic uncertainties. Again, the solar model with older abundances
</p>
<p>agrees with this value, having Y D 0:244, while the alternative model results in a
lower value for helium of Y D 0:230.
</p>
<p>Finally, the sound speed profile throughout most of the solar interior can be
</p>
<p>determined. The difference with respect to the standard solar model is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 29.6 for both determinations of the solar abundances. As before, the older
</p>
<p>one results in a model closer to the seismic results, even if the reasons for this
</p>
<p>good agreement are not clear. The uncertainty of the seismic sound speed is below
</p>
<p>0.002 for r=Rˇ between 0.2 and 0.7. Towards the centre it is increasing due to the
small number of modes extending into the core, and in the outermost layers it is
</p>
<p>larger because of the uncertainties concerning the damping of oscillations in the
</p>
<p>atmosphere. Therefore the only significant deviation of the solar model sound speed
</p>
<p>profile from the seismically determined one is the maximum of the grey line just
</p>
<p>below the convective envelope.
</p>
<p>Although the discrepancy between model and seismic data appears to be large for
</p>
<p>the alternative model, one should keep in mind that the agreement is still within one
</p>
<p>per cent everywhere. Ignoring the effect of diffusion in the solar model calculation,
</p>
<p>which, when looking at its effect in Fig. 29.3, appears to be rather small, would result
</p>
<p>in a very similar discrepancy between model and seismic result. Overall, helioseis-
</p>
<p>mology confirms that stellar evolution theory can reproduce the structure of the Sun
</p>
<p>with an accuracy that is much higher than usually found in astrophysical situations.
</p>
<p>29.5 Solar Neutrinos
</p>
<p>Some of the nuclear reactions of the pp chain, as well as of the CNO cycle, produce
</p>
<p>neutrinos (Sect. 18.5.1). In addition, there are also neutrinos due to the very rare pep
</p>
<p>and hep reactions</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>

</p>
<p>the latter one being the trivial way to produce 4He after the reactions of (18.61),
</p>
<p>but it is occurring in only 10�8 of all cases. However, the energy of the emitted
neutrino is close to 10MeV, and it is therefore necessary to consider this reaction.
</p>
<p>As already discussed in Sect. 18.7, the neutrinos leave the star practically without
</p>
<p>interacting with the stellar matter. The energy spectrum of neutrinos from ˇ decay
</p>
<p>is continuous, since the electrons can take part of the energy away, while neutrinos
</p>
<p>released after an inverse ˇ decay are essentially monochromatic. Therefore most
</p>
<p>reactions of the pp chain have a continuous spectrum, while the pep-reaction (29.1)
</p>
<p>and the electron capture on 7Be (18.62) have a line spectrum. Since 7Be can decay
</p>
<p>into 7Li either in the ground state or in an excited state, this reaction gives two
</p>
<p>spectral lines. The neutrino spectrum of the Sun as predicted from the reactions of
</p>
<p>the pp chain, computed from our standard solar model, is given in Fig. 29.7. In
</p>
<p>order to obtain the neutrino spectrum of the present Sun one cannot use the simple
</p>
<p>(equilibrium) formulae (18.63) and (18.65), but must compute the rates of all the
</p>
<p>single reactions given in (18.62), (18.64) and in addition the reactions of (29.1) in a
</p>
<p>nuclear network.
</p>
<p>Since the solar neutrinos can leave the Sun almost unimpeded they can in
</p>
<p>principle be measured in terrestrial laboratories and thus be used to learn directly
</p>
<p>about conditions in the innermost solar core. This difficult task indeed has been
</p>
<p>undertaken since 1964, when John Bahcall and Raymond Davies began to plan for
</p>
<p>an underground neutrino detector in a mine in Homestead, North Dakota. Forty
</p>
<p>years later the experiments finally have confirmed the standard solar model, and
</p>
<p>R. Davies received the Nobel Prize for his work. The time in between, however, was
</p>
<p>characterized by the &ldquo;solar neutrino problem&rdquo;. The history of solar neutrino physics
</p>
<p>and the resolution of the problem is summarized in detail in Chap. 18 of the textbook
</p>
<p>by Weiss et al. (2004) and in Bahcall and Davies (2000).1
</p>
<p>The solar neutrino problem consisted in the fact that since the first results from
</p>
<p>the so-called chlorine experiment by Davies there was a lack of neutrinos compared
</p>
<p>to solar model predictions. The chlorine experiment is sensitive to neutrinos with
</p>
<p>energies above 0.814MeV and therefore, as can be seen in Fig. 29.7 mainly to the 8B
</p>
<p>neutrinos, with some contribution from pep, hep, and 7Be neutrinos. The experiment
</p>
<p>is based on the reaction 37Cl C � ! 37Ar, where the decays of radioactive argon
nuclei are counted. The rate of neutrino captures is commonly measured in solar
</p>
<p>neutrino units (SNU). One SNU corresponds to 10�36 captures per second and per
target nucleus. The predicted counts amount to 7.5 SNU for the chlorine experiment,
</p>
<p>the measurements averaged over several decades to only 2:5˙0:2 SNU. The deficit
could indicate that the solar centre is cooler than in the models.

</p>
<p>To improve the experimental evidence, additional experimentswere started. First,
</p>
<p>another kind of radiochemical detector using gallium in the detector fluid measured,
</p>
<p>due to a much lower energy threshold, the majority of neutrinos, including those

<p>from the pp-reaction. Later, electron-scattering detectors were developed, which

<p>are sensitive to the highest energies only, but which provide directional information

<p>about the neutrino source (For these detectors the hep-neutrinos of (29.1) have to be

<p>Evolution on the Main Sequence
</p>
<p>30.1 Change in the Hydrogen Content
</p>
<p>In the main-sequence phase, the large energy losses from a star&rsquo;s surface are
</p>
<p>compensated by the energy production of hydrogen burning (see Sect. 18.5.1).
</p>
<p>These reactions release nuclear binding energy by converting hydrogen into helium.
</p>
<p>This chemical evolution of the star concerns primarily its central region, since the
</p>
<p>energy sources are strongly concentrated towards the centre (Sect. 22.2).
</p>
<p>Somewhat larger volumes are affected simultaneously if there is a convective
</p>
<p>core in which the turbulent motions provide a very effective mixing. If the extent of
</p>
<p>convective regions and the rate of energy production "H for all mass elements are
</p>
<p>known, the rate of change of the hydrogen content XH can be calculated according
</p>
<p>to Sect. 8.2.3.
</p>
<p>The situation is particularly simple for stars of rather small mass (say 0:1Mˇ &lt;
M . 1Mˇ) that have a radiative core. In the absence of mixing, the change of XH
at any given mass element is proportional to the local value of "H. After a small time
</p>
<p>step �t , the change of hydrogen concentration is �XH � "H�t everywhere (with a
well-known factor of proportionality). Following the chemical evolution in this way
</p>
<p>over many consecutive time steps, one obtains &ldquo;hydrogen profiles&rdquo; [i.e. functions
</p>
<p>XH.m/] as shown in Fig. 30.1. At the end of the main-sequence phase, XH ! 0 in
the centre.
</p>
<p>With the change in the hydrogen profile also a change in the energy generation
</p>
<p>rate "H takes place (Fig. 30.2). Initially, it has a maximum at the centre, since there
</p>
<p>temperature is highest and the abundance of hydrogen almost the same everywhere
</p>
<p>in the core. However, in the course of evolution, though temperature rises in
</p>
<p>the centre, the hydrogen abundance drops, and after some time, the maximum "H,
</p>
<p>which depends on both of these quantities, is larger outside the centre. This can
</p>
<p>be seen first for the model of 8:2 � 109 years (dotted line in Fig. 30.2). When the
centre is completely depleted of hydrogen, "H D 0 there and the energy generation
profile looks like the strongly peaked (solid) line, corresponding to the final model of

<p>in which core hydrogen burning has reduced the hydrogen content. It leads to a

<p>steepening of that profile and to a narrowing of the burning shell. Hydrogen burning
</p>
<p>is now even for this 1Mˇ star proceeding via the CNO cycle.
In more massive stars, the helium production is even more concentrated towards

<p>the centre because of the large sensitivity to temperature of the CNO cycle. But

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>This simple scenario is seriously complicated, particularly for rather massive

<p>stars, by two uncertainties in the theory of convection (convective overshoot and

<p>346 30 Evolution on the Main Sequence
</p>
<p>30.2 Evolution in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell Diagram
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the main-sequence phase the models are located in the HR
</p>
<p>diagram on or near the ZAMS as described in Chap. 22. Numerical solutions show
</p>
<p>that their positions change relatively little during the long phase in which hydrogen
</p>
<p>is exhausted in the central region. A typical evolutionary track (for a 7Mˇ star of
the same population I mixture as before) is given in Fig. 30.5a. Starting from point
</p>
<p>A on the ZAMS, the luminosity increases by about � lgL D 0:240 to point B
and about � lgL D 0:059 from B to C . The rise of L is due to the increasing
mean molecular weight when 1H is transformed to 4He, in accordance with the
</p>
<p>prediction of the homology relations [see, e.g. (20.20)]. The evolution from B to C
</p>
<p>is so fast that � increases only a very little in this short time interval. From the
</p>
<p>change of r for different values of m (see Fig. 31.3) one clearly sees that the star
</p>
<p>evolves non-homologously, which ultimately is because the chemical composition
</p>
<p>changes only in the central region. The solutions show that the effective temperature
</p>
<p>decreases fromA toB by� lgTeff � �0:089 and then increases again to pointC by
� lgTeff � 0:038. This corresponds to an increase of the radius by � lgR � 0:299
(A to B) and a decrease by � lgR � 0:047 (B to C ). Point B is reached after
about 3:67 � 107 years, roughly when the central hydrogen content has dropped
to XH � 0:05. At point C , when XH D 0 in the centre, the age is 3:74 � 107
years.
</p>
<p>The evolutionary tracks are very similar for all stellar masses for which the
</p>
<p>hydrogen content is exhausted in a convective core of appreciable mass, i.e. on the
</p>
<p>whole upper part of the main sequence (see Fig. 30.5b). The increments of lgL from
</p>
<p>A to B and from A to C become somewhat larger for larger values ofM , while the
</p>
<p>changes of lg Teff remain about the same. The structure of the evolutionary tracks
</p>
<p>is different for smaller masses which have radiative cores. This can be seen in the
</p>
<p>lower part of Fig. 30.5b. Of particular interest is the star withM D 1:2Mˇ, since it
barely develops a convective core of only 0:05Mˇ. This is also visible in the shape
of its track in the Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell diagram, which appears to be a transition
</p>
<p>between those for lower and higher masses.
</p>
<p>A common feature of all evolutionary tracks described here is that they point in
</p>
<p>some direction above the ZAMS. This is the case only for an evolution producing
</p>
<p>chemically inhomogeneousmodels (composed of a helium core and a hydrogen-rich
</p>
<p>envelope). In an evolution assuming complete mixing of the whole model, � would
</p>
<p>have a constant spatial distribution and would increase in time. Then the star would
</p>
<p>evolve below the ZAMS, in accordance with the discussion after (20.23). Aside
</p>
<p>from all details, the observations (e.g. cluster diagrams) show that evolved stars are
</p>
<p>in fact above and to the right of the ZAMS, i.e. the stars obviously develop chemical
</p>
<p>inhomogeneities in their interior. This conclusion is very important, in particular,
</p>
<p>for the theory of stellar rotation. It excludes, for example, a complete mixing by the
</p>
<p>large-scale currents of rotationally driven meridional circulations (Chap. 44).</p>

<p>30.3 Timescales for Central Hydrogen Burning
</p>
<p>The time �H a star spends on the main sequence while burning its central hydrogen
</p>
<p>depends onM . This is because its luminosity L increases so strongly withM . Let
</p>
<p>us consider this timescale:
</p>
<p>�H D
EH
</p>
<p>L
; (30.1)
</p>
<p>where EH is the nuclear energy content that can be released by central hydrogen
</p>
<p>burning. As a rough estimate, we assume that the same fraction of the total mass of
</p>
<p>hydrogenMH in the star is consumed in all stars. Then we have EH � MH � M .
Since L does not vary very much in this phase, we take the M &ndash;L relation of the
</p>
<p>ZAMS, L � M � [cf. (22.1)]. Introducing these proportionalities into (30.1), we
have for the dependence of �H onM
</p>
<p>�H.M/ �

<p>L
�M 1��: (30.2)
</p>
<p>For an average exponent in theM &ndash;L relation of, say, � D 3:5, one has �H �M�2:5,
i.e. a strong decrease of �H towards larger values ofM .
</p>
<p>Of course, the numerical results are influenced and modified by a variety of

<p>clusters, by which it is confirmed.Assume that all stars of such a cluster were formed
</p>
<p>at the same time, i.e. that they now have the same age �cluster. We must then conclude
</p>
<p>that all stars with masses larger than a limiting massM0 have already left the main-
</p>
<p>sequence region, while stars with M &lt; M0 are still on the main sequence. M0 is
</p>
<p>given by the condition �cluster D �H.M0/. This is the basis for the age determination
of such clusters.
</p>
<p>30.4 Complications Connected with Convection
</p>
<p>The seemingly nice and clear picture of the main-sequence phase as described
</p>
<p>above is unfortunately blurred by the notorious problem of convection.Questionable
</p>
<p>points include the precise determination of those regions in the deep interior in
</p>
<p>which convective motions occur and therefore the extent to which the chemical
</p>
<p>elements are mixed. The mixing influences the later evolution, since the chem-
</p>
<p>ical profile, which is established and left behind, is a long-lasting memory. We
</p>
<p>briefly mention two problems, the first of which concerns all main-sequence stars
</p>
<p>having convective cores, while the second occurs only in the more massive of
</p>
<p>these stars.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>30.4 Complications Connected with Convection 349
</p>
<p>30.4.1 Convective Overshooting
</p>
<p>We consider the situation in the surroundings of the outer boundary of a convective
</p>
<p>core of mass Mbc, as calculated without allowance for overshooting. This means
</p>
<p>that here we have defined the boundary to be at the position of neutral stability, i.e.
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>rrad D rad (30.3)
</p>
<p>according to the classical criterion (6.13). (Without much loss of generality, we may
</p>
<p>here treat a chemically homogeneous layer, for example, in the model for a ZAMS
</p>
<p>star.) Complete mixing and a nearly adiabatic stratification with r D rad C ".0 &lt;
" � 1/ is assumed in the convective region belowMbc, while no mixing and r D
rrad is assumed for the radiative region aboveMbc (cf. Chaps. 6 and 7, in particular
Sect. 7.3).
</p>
<p>This model implies an obvious problem: the boundary between the regimes in
</p>
<p>which convective motions are present .v &gt; 0/ and absent .v D 0/ is determined
by the criterion (30.3), which essentially relies on buoyancy forces, and therefore
</p>
<p>describes the acceleration Pv rather than the velocity v (cf. Sect. 6.1). Rising
elements of convection are accelerated until they have reached Mbc; the braking
</p>
<p>starts only beyond this border, which is passed by elements owing to their inertia.
</p>
<p>The situation is the same as if we were to hope that a car would come to a full stop
</p>
<p>at the very point where one switches from acceleration to braking. The only way to
</p>
<p>substantiate this would be to try it (once) right in front of a hard and solid enough
</p>
<p>wall.
</p>
<p>Simple estimates (e.g. Saslaw and Schwarzschild 1965) indeed give the impres-
</p>
<p>sion that there is such a hard wall for elements passing the border Mbc. We have
</p>
<p>seen in Sect. 7.4 that in the deep interior of the star the elements rise adiabatically
</p>
<p>such that re D rad. From (7.5) we then see that the buoyancy force kr acting on an
element is
</p>
<p>kr � r � rad ; (30.4)
</p>
<p>with a positive factor of proportionality. Below the border, kr is small and positive
</p>
<p>(small acceleration) since r � rad is extremely small and positive (�10�6). In
contrast to this, the braking above the border is by orders of magnitude more
</p>
<p>efficient. We have assumed that there r is equal to rrad, which drops rapidly below
rad (in Fig. 22.8b by about 0.1 within a scale height). So the force kr due to r�rad
soon reaches rather large and negative values: therefore an overshooting element
</p>
<p>can be stopped within a negligible fraction of the pressure scale height.
</p>
<p>A significant overshoot, therefore, could result only if the braking were sub-
</p>
<p>stantially reduced (the &ldquo;wall&rdquo; softened). A possibility for this was outlined by
</p>
<p>Shaviv and Salpeter (1973), who pointed to the recoupling of the overshoot on the
</p>
<p>thermal structure of the layer. Consider the temperature excess DT of a moving
</p>
<p>element (re D rad) over the surroundings (gradientr). According to (7.4), we have
DT � r � rad, and DT becomes negative above the border, i.e. the overshooting
elements become cooler than the surroundings, which results in a cooling of the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>350 30 Evolution on the Main Sequence
</p>
<p>upper layers and an increase of the gradient r. We may describe it in terms of the
convective flux (positive, if it points outwards), which according to (7.3) is
</p>
<p>Fcon � v �DT (30.5)
</p>
<p>(with positive factors of proportionality). Above the border, the upward motion
</p>
<p>.v &gt; 0/ of cooler elements .DT &lt; 0/ represents a negative Fcon. In order to
</p>
<p>maintain a constant total flux
</p>
<p>F D Fcon C Frad D
l
</p>
<p>4�r2
; (30.6)
</p>
<p>with Fcon &lt; 0, the radiative flux Frad must become larger than the total flux F . From
</p>
<p>(7.1) and (7.2) we immediately have
</p>
<p>Frad
</p>
<p>F
D rrrad
</p>
<p>; (30.7)
</p>
<p>which shows that r &gt; rrad for Frad &gt; F . The increase of r, however, reduces the
absolute values of r � rad and of the braking force kr compared with the situation
without overshooting; the elements can penetrate farther into the region of stability
</p>
<p>than originally estimated, etc.
</p>
<p>To find out whether or not this provides an appreciable amount of overshooting
</p>
<p>is a difficult problem and one that is still far from being solved. In order to find
</p>
<p>the point where the velocity v vanishes, one needs a self-consistent and detailed
</p>
<p>solution (including velocities, fluxes, gradients) for the whole convective core.
</p>
<p>This can only be obtained by using a theory of convection, the uncertainties of
</p>
<p>which now enter directly into the interior solution of the star. Even if we want
</p>
<p>to apply the mixing-length theory, the procedure is not clear. Instead of the usual
</p>
<p>local version of the theory, one needs a non-local treatment. At a given point, for
</p>
<p>example, the velocity of an element or its temperature excess depends not only on
</p>
<p>quantities at that point, but on the precise amount of acceleration (and braking)
</p>
<p>which the element has experienced along its whole previous path. All prescriptions
</p>
<p>for evaluating this and for averaging quantities like v or DT are as arbitrary as the
</p>
<p>choice of the mixing length. In fact any detailed modelling of the convective core
</p>
<p>by a mixing-length theory is necessarily ambiguous. For example, it encounters
</p>
<p>the difficulty that a core extends over less than a pressure scale height [the local
</p>
<p>expression of which, HP D �dr=d ln P , becomes 1 at the centre according
to (11.7)]. Different authors using different prescriptions have arrived at answers
</p>
<p>ranging from virtually no overshoot to rather extensive overshoot; and all of them
</p>
<p>have been questioned (see Renzini 1987). In the following we present a physically
</p>
<p>motivated treatment by Maeder (1975). Figure 30.7 shows the typical run of some
</p>
<p>characteristic functions as obtained from such calculations for M D 2Mˇ and
˛ D `m=HP D 1. Below the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; border of stability (rrad D rad), one has
typically r �rad � C10�4 which is enough to accelerate the convective elements</p>

<p>of ˛, because the velocity of the convective elements depends on the mixing length

</p>
<p>hydrogen burning in a 7Mˇ star calculated with such overshooting for different ˛
(The limit case ˛ D 0 is the model calculated without overshooting.). The influence
of overshooting on the evolutionary tracks is shown in Fig. 30.8b. The consequences
</p>
<p>of an increased helium core at the end of this phase are an increased luminosity, an
</p>
<p>increased age (by about 25% for ˛ D 1) due to the enlarged reservoir of nuclear
fuel, and lower effective temperatures reached during the main-sequence evolution.
</p>
<p>This leads to a broadening of the upper main-sequence compared to calculations
</p>
<p>without overshooting. Indeed, the observed width of the upper main-sequence is

<p>one test to estimate the amount of overshooting from convective cores in massive
</p>
<p>stars (Maeder and Meynet 1991). However, if such overshooting occurs, its main
</p>
<p>effect will show up only later, during the phase of helium burning (see Sect. 31.4).

<p>As mentioned at the beginning of Chap. 7 efforts to develop more realistic

</p>
<p>Up to the present time two standard methods for modelling overshooting are
</p>
<p>being used in numerical calculations. The first one is based on a simple extension
</p>
<p>of the convectively mixed region above the boundary defined by the Schwarzschild
</p>
<p>criterion. This extension lov is parametrized in terms of the local pressure scale
</p>
<p>height at the boundary
</p>
<p>lov D ˛ovHP : (30.8)
</p>
<p>The parameter ˛ov is typically of order 0:1 � � � 0:2 for modern stellar models. It has
no relation to the mixing-length parameter ˛MLT, and is most often determined
</p>
<p>by fitting models to observed colour-magnitude diagrams (e.g. Stothers and Chin
</p>
<p>1992). For the overshooting region the assumption r D rad is usually made. One
sometimes speaks of &ldquo;convective penetration&rdquo; instead of overshooting. Strictly
</p>
<p>speaking, the temperature gradient should be at least slightly subadiabatic, otherwise
</p>
<p>convective elements would not be decelerated.

<p>(adopted from Pietrinferni et al. 2004). The dashed line is obtained from stellar models without
</p>
<p>overshooting, and the solid line for models with overshooting, treated in the approach of (30.8),
</p>
<p>with a parameter ˛ov of about 0.1. The &ldquo;hook&rdquo; at the end of the main-sequence can be reproduced
</p>
<p>correctly only with overshooting taken into account. Note that the isochrone age is 3.2Gyr for this
</p>
<p>case, while it is lower (2Gyr) for the case without overshooting to balance the fact that in this case
</p>
<p>main sequence luminosities are lower. Except for the turn-off region the two isochrones are almost
</p>
<p>identical
</p>
<p>derived from the convective velocity obtained from mixing-length theory and taken
</p>
<p>below the Schwarzschild boundary. This approach is based on two-dimensional
</p>
<p>hydrodynamical simulations of thin convective envelopes in A-type stars and
</p>
<p>cool white dwarfs. Although its theoretical foundation is therefore limited, it has
</p>
<p>been used in a variety of situations and been shown that it also can be used
</p>
<p>to reproduce the width of the upper main sequence, and the colour-magnitude
</p>
<p>diagrams of open clusters (Fig. 30.9), with a numerical value of fov in the range
</p>
<p>of 0:02. The hydrodynamical models also indicate that the temperature gradient in
</p>
<p>the overshooting layers is close to the radiative one. A further advantage of this
</p>
<p>approach is that it can easily be added to a stellar evolution code that already has
</p>
<p>implemented diffusion (Sect. 8.2.2). In both cases the extent of the overshooting
</p>
<p>region has to be limited for small convective cores because of the divergence ofHP
near the centre, as one otherwise gets unrealistically large mixed cores.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;diffusive&rdquo; approach (30.9) leads to smoother chemical profiles than those
</p>
<p>resulting from (30.8). This is quite obvious from the example we show in Fig. 30.10
</p>

shooting taken into account. The receding convective core leaves behind a profile</p>

<p>Four models at approximately

</p>
<p>compared

<p>characterized by small steps mixed with shallow, homogeneously mixed regions,

<p>which have been unstable to convection locally. In Fig. 30.12 this kind of structure
</p>
<p>shows up as &ldquo;convective tongues&rdquo; in the upper panel. The dashed grey lines are
</p>
<p>the resulting chemical profiles if overshooting according to (30.9) is included. Due
</p>
<p>to the exponentially declining mixing speed the profiles are very smooth. It is
</p>
<p>also clearly seen how overshooting extends the homogeneously mixed core by
</p>
<p>about 0:05M in this case. For a large part of the main-sequence evolution the
</p>
<p>Schwarzschild boundary of the convective core remains at about the same mass
</p>
<p>coordinate as in the case without overshooting. Only in later main-sequence phases
</p>
<p>it changes (see Fig. 30.12, top and middle panel).
</p>
<p>But as mentioned before the question of overshooting is quite open and can be
</p>
<p>settled only by use of a better theory of convection. This also concerns the question
</p>
<p>how the amount of overshooting varies with stellar parameters, such as mass and
</p>
<p>composition, and whether it occurs at all convective boundaries. So far, both issues
</p>
<p>can be addressed only tentatively by comparison with observations.

<p>in the evolution of rather massive stars, say, forM &gt; 10Mˇ (This limit depends on
the chemical composition; it can even be around 7Mˇ for hydrogen-rich mixtures
of extreme population I stars.).
</p>
<p>In these stars during central hydrogen burning the convective core retreats,

<p>leaving a certain hydrogen profile behind; the radiative gradient rrad outside the
core starts to rise and soon exceeds the adiabatic gradient rad. This happens in a</p>

</p>
<p>Complete mixing in this layer

<p>would lead to the dashed

<p>the same range of m are

</p>
<p>convective properties of the
</p>
<p>different layers
</p>
<p>region with outwardly increasing hydrogen content (decreasing molecular weight
</p>
<p>�); therefore r� � d ln�=d lnP &gt; 0, which makes the layer dynamically stable
(Sect. 6.1). Considering the classical criteria for convective stability according to
</p>
<p>Schwarzschild and Ledoux we find
</p>
<p>rad &lt; rrad &lt; rad C
'
</p>
<p>ı
r�: (30.10)
</p>
<p>As described in Sect. 6.3 a layer in which (30.10) is fulfilled is vibrationally unstable
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;overstable&rdquo;). A slightly displaced mass element starts to oscillate with slowly
</p>
<p>growing amplitude and penetrates more and more into regions of different chemical
</p>
<p>composition. This results in a rather slow mixing which is called semiconvection.
</p>
<p>The treatment of this process is complicated, one difficulty being that any degree of
</p>
<p>mixing must have a noticeable reaction on the stratification in the mixed layer.
</p>
<p>Suppose that semiconvection occurs in some region of an originally very
</p>
<p>smooth hydrogen profile (solid line in Fig. 30.11a). The corresponding gradients
</p>
<p>are schematically sketched in Fig. 30.11b. The solid line is the decisive gradient of
</p>
<p>the Ledoux criterion. The region is fully convective in the innermost part, because
</p>
<p>rad &lt; rrad and r� D 0. Next follows a radiative zone because of the drop of rrad,
above which a semiconvective layer exists, which would be convective according
</p>
<p>to the Schwarzschild criterion, but is stabilized due to the positive r�-term. If
the mixing in the semiconvective region were very efficient, we would obtain a
</p>
<p>&ldquo;plateau&rdquo; in the profile (dashed line in Fig. 30.11a). There are obviously two main
</p>
<p>effects of such a mixing on the gradients. Firstly, any change of profile changes
</p>
<p>the value of r�, which goes to zero in the plateau. Secondly, the mixing increases
the hydrogen contentXH in the lower part and decreases XH in the upper part of the
</p>
<p>mixed region. In massive main-sequence stars the opacity is largely dominated by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>356 30 Evolution on the Main Sequence
</p>
<p>electron scattering, for which � � .1CXH/, [cf. (17.2)]. Sincerrad � �, [cf. (5.28)],
the radiative gradient rrad is increased in the lower part and decreased in the upper
part of the mixed area. Therefore both these changes (of r� and of rrad), which
are due to the mixing, will modify the decisive terms entering into (30.10), and
</p>
<p>as a result some parts can completely change their stability properties (convective-
</p>
<p>semiconvective-radiative).Whether a semiconvective layer becomes more stable or
</p>
<p>unstable to convection depends on the overall result of both effects. In the situation
</p>
<p>sketched, most likely the lower part, in which hydrogen content increases, will
</p>
<p>become fully convective, while the radiative envelope will grow deeper into the
</p>
<p>formerly semiconvective layer.
</p>
<p>The slow mixing in semiconvective regions can be considered as a diffusion
</p>
<p>process (see, for instance, Langer et al. 1985). The resulting profile will depend
</p>
<p>on the timescale �diff of that kind of diffusion and its ratio to the typical timescale in
</p>
<p>which the stellar properties change (e.g. the composition due to nuclear reactions).
</p>
<p>For example, a relatively small �diff (large diffusion coefficient) will tend to mix
</p>
<p>to such an extent that convective neutrality is nearly reached with rrad � rad. In
fact this is yet another approach to treat semiconvection in numerical calculations:
</p>
<p>Semiconvective layers are mixed to such an extent that neutrality is achieved.
</p>
<p>In this case one does not aim at describing the physical properties in detail but
</p>
<p>rather aims at a likely final situation. In general one should expect a continuous
</p>
<p>change of the profile and radiative, semiconvective, and fully convective regions
</p>
<p>moving slowly through the star. Unfortunately the coefficient of diffusion cannot
</p>
<p>yet be determined satisfactorily, which is rather serious, since, as in the case
</p>
<p>of overshooting, the details of the established profile are very decisive for the
</p>
<p>later evolution of these stars. In Fig. 30.12 we show an example for the different
</p>
<p>convective and semiconvective layers establishing in a 15Mˇ star during the main-
sequence evolution, when different approaches to overshooting and semiconvection
</p>
<p>are employed. The semiconvective layers outside the fully convective core in the
</p>
<p>Schwarzschild case (top panel in the figure) change their character&ndash;convective or
</p>
<p>radiative&ndash;with time, depending on changes in the thermal structure and on mixing.
</p>
<p>The result is a typical tongue-like extent of convective layers, separated by radiative
</p>
<p>&ldquo;tongues&rdquo;, and a H/He profile that showsmany irregular steps. This kind of structure
</p>
<p>can already be seen in the early works Langer (1989, 1991) in stars of 30 and 20Mˇ.
Additional complications can arise from the interaction of semiconvection and
</p>
<p>overshooting. Note that semiconvection can also play a role in later phases, for
</p>
<p>example, if a convective core increases during helium burning and expands into
</p>
<p>a region of different chemical composition.

<p>30.5 The Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar Limit
</p>
<p>Since the nuclear timescale for central hydrogen burning is large compared to the

</p>
<p>the star is left with a helium core without nuclear energy release surrounded by
</p>
<p>a hydrogen-rich envelope. At the bottom of this envelope, the temperature is just
</p>
<p>large enough for further hydrogen burning, which continues at this place in a shell
</p>
<p>source (see Figs. 30.2 and 30.4). The problematic part is the possible structure and
</p>
<p>change of the helium core. A core almost in thermal equilibrium without nuclear
</p>
<p>energy sources cannot have a considerable luminosity, and hence must be nearly
</p>
<p>isothermal, since dT=dr � l .
Therefore we consider here equilibrium models consisting of an isothermal
</p>
<p>helium core of mass Mc D q0M and a hydrogen-rich envelope of mass
(1 � q0/M (see Fig. 30.13). For simplicity the chemical composition is taken to
change discontinuously at the border of the two regions. The luminosity is supplied
</p>
<p>by hydrogen-shell burning at the bottom of the envelope. In the following, solutions
</p>
<p>for the core (subscript 0 at its surface q D q0) and solutions for the envelope
(subscript e at the lower boundary q D q0) are first discussed separately and then
fitted to each other. In view of their importance we will look at the surprising results

<p>30.5.1 A Simple Approach: The Virial Theorem and Homology
</p>
<p>Important properties of such models can be understood by rather simple considera-
</p>
<p>tions, which give at least a qualitatively correct picture. We assume the isothermal
</p>
<p>core after central hydrogen burning to consist of an ideal monatomic gas (molecular
</p>
<p>weight �core). To this core, we apply the virial theorem in the form (3.21) which
</p>
<p>contains a term for the non-vanishing surface pressure P0. Solving for P0, we
</p>
<p>obtained (26.23), which we here rewrite as
</p>
<p>P0 D C1
McT0
</p>
<p>R3c
� C2
</p>
<p>M 2c
R4c
</p>
<p>; (30.11)
</p>
<p>where C1; C2 are positive factors, and C1 � cv D 3&lt;=.2�core). This describes the
resulting surface pressure P0 as the difference between the average interior pressure
</p>
<p>(first term �N%T0) and the self-gravity term (second term �Rc Ng N%), when we use
N% �Mc=R3c and Ng �Mc=R2c .
</p>
<p>For simplicity we assume Te to be kept at a constant value by the thermostatic
</p>
<p>action of hydrogen burning. The fitting condition at q0 then requires
</p>
<p>T0 D Te D constant; (30.12)
</p>
<p>and P0 depends only onMc and Rc. As explained in Sect. 26.2 the counteraction of
</p>
<p>the two terms in (30.11), which depend on different powers ofRc, has the result that,
</p>
<p>forMc D constant, P0 has a maximum value P0max at Rc D Rcmax [see (26.27)],

<p>with some positive constants C3; C4. This can be obtained by solving
</p>
<p>@P0=@Rc D 0 (for constant T0) from (30.11). The function P0.Rc) for given Mc
and T0 is sketched in Fig. 30.14. From (30.13) we see that P0max � M�2c , i.e. the
maximum surface pressure of the core decreases strongly with the mass Mc of the
</p>
<p>core.</p>

</p>
<p>as a function of the core radius Rc. Horizontal lines indicate the pressure Pc at the bottom of the
</p>
<p>envelope for three different relative core masses q0. The stable solution is marked by a dot and the
</p>
<p>unstable solution by an open circle; the solution at P0max, is marginally stable
</p>
<p>For the functions at the bottom of the envelopewe simply assume that all possible
</p>
<p>envelopes are homologous to each other. Then from (20.9) and (20.24) follow Pe �
M 2=R4 and Te � M=R: The latter relation together with (30.12) means thatM=R
D constant, such that the relation for Pe becomes
</p>
<p>Pe D C5
T 40
M 2
</p>
<p>: (30.14)
</p>
<p>We see that Pe is independent of Rc and has the same dependence on T0 as P0max,
</p>
<p>but decreases withM instead ofMc. This can lead to difficulties! In Fig. 30.14 the
</p>
<p>envelope pressure Pe according to (30.14) is given by a horizontal straight line, the
</p>
<p>height of which depends onM .
</p>
<p>The remaining fitting conditions for a complete solution of the star require
</p>
<p>Rc D re and P0 D Pe, i.e. we look for an intersection of the two types of curves in
Fig. 30.14. Obviously this can be obtained only if Pe � P0max, which together with
(30.13) and (30.14) gives the condition
</p>
<p>q0 �
Mc
</p>
<p>M
� qSC; (30.15)
</p>
<p>i.e. the relative core mass q0 must not exceed a certain limiting value, which is the
</p>
<p>Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar limit qSC. This limit was already derived in Sect. 21.4
</p>
<p>from fitting solutions for isothermal cores and for envelopes in the U&ndash;V plane.
</p>
<p>For q0 &lt; qSC we have Pe &lt; P0max, and there are two intersections in
</p>
<p>Fig. 30.14. The solution for the smaller value of Rc is thermally unstable,
</p>
<p>the other one is stable. This can be made plausible by a simple argument.
</p>
<p>Figure 30.14 shows that, if we slightly increase the core radius of the stable solution,
</p>
<p>P0 drops below Pe and the envelope tends to compress the core, thus restoring the
</p>
<p>equilibrium state. The opposite behaviour (further increase of an initial expansion,
</p>
<p>since P0 exceeds Pe/ can be seen to result from the perturbation of the unstable
</p>
<p>equilibrium state, and this rough argument is confirmed by a strict eigenvalue

<p>analysis.</p>

<p>The solutions merge for q0 D qSC .Pe D P0max) which corresponds to neutral
stability. And there are no solutions possible for q0 &gt; qSC, since Pe always exceeds
</p>
<p>P0. In such a case some basic assumption of our present picture has to be dropped
</p>
<p>(e.g. equilibrium or ideal gas). In particular the Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar limit
</p>
<p>does not apply for the case of a degenerate electron gas. This will be discussed
</p>
<p>later.
</p>
<p>The value of qSC has been computed by Schönberg and Chandrasekhar (1942).
</p>
<p>It depends on the ratio of the molecular weights �core=�env, since the envelope
</p>
<p>pressure depends on �env; while P0 depends on �core via C1. One can write roughly
</p>
<p>qSC D 0:37
�
�env
</p>
<p>�core
</p>
<p>�2
; (30.16)
</p>
<p>which means for a pure helium core �core D 4=3 and for a hydrogen-rich envelope
qSC � 0:09. This value is certainly exceeded by the helium cores that are left after
central hydrogen burning in stars of the upper main sequence. Stars of somewhat
</p>
<p>smaller mass may encounter the same difficulty later, when the shell source burns
</p>
<p>outwards, thus increasing the mass of the helium core above the critical value. The
</p>
<p>Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar limit is therefore quite relevant for the evolution in any
</p>

<p>appear.
</p>
<p>30.5.2 Integrations for Core and Envelope
</p>
<p>More reliable curves in the P � Rc diagram (Fig. 30.14) can be easily obtained by
numerical integrations for core and envelope (Roth 1973).
</p>
<p>An envelope solution can be calculated for given M and Mc by requiring the
</p>
<p>lower boundary conditions l D 0; r D R0 to hold atM D Mc: The solution gives
Pe and Te at m D Mc. By varying Rc, one obtains a set of solutions which gives
Pe.Rc/; Te.Rc/. Two typical envelope curves Pe.Rc) are shown in Fig. 30.15a. It
</p>
<p>turns out that these curves, in their important parts, are nearly independent of Mc
but are raised essentially by a decrease ofM [This is qualitatively the same as in the
</p>
<p>approximation (30.14).]. The temperature Te varies, in fact, very little along such
</p>
<p>an envelope curve. For later applications (Sect. 31.1) we briefly mention the surface
</p>
<p>values of these envelope solutions. Those with large values of Rc are located near
</p>
<p>the main-sequence. With decreasing Rc they move to the right in the HR diagram,
</p>
<p>and envelopes with the smallest values of Rc are close to the Hayashi line.
</p>
<p>The solution for an isothermal core with temperature T0 can be obtained by a
</p>
<p>straightforward integration starting at the centre with an assumed value of P D Pc
and continued until m D Mc is reached. At this point one finds a pair of values
P D P0 and r D Rc. Many such integrations for different values of the parameter
Pc then give the curve P0.Rc) for the core. The solid line in Fig. 30.15b gives such
</p>
<p>a curve for cores of massMc D 0:18Mˇ and T0 D 2:24 � 107K. The lower-right
part (small P0, largeRc) corresponds to small central pressures Pc:With increasing</p>

</p>
<p>the maximum of the core curve in Fig. 30.14, while the horizontal envelope curves
</p>
<p>there are now replaced by envelope curves like those in Fig. 30.15a.). Then it would
</p>
<p>follow the dotted spiral, if we artificially suppress the deviation from the ideal-gas
</p>
<p>approximation in the equation of state. This may be compared with the spiral in the
</p>
<p>U &ndash;V plane obtained for an isothermal core in Fig. 21.2. An increasing Pc, however,
</p>
<p>implies an increasing degeneracy of the electron gas. This &ldquo;unwinds&rdquo; the spiral and
</p>
<p>P0 drops, while a gradually increasing fraction of the core becomes degenerate.
</p>
<p>When degeneracy encompasses practically the whole core, P0 rises again strongly
</p>
<p>with decreasing Rc (upper-left end of the solid curve in Fig. 30.15b). The dashed
</p>
<p>and dot-dashed lines demonstrate how the curve changes whenMc is decreased. As
</p>
<p>predicted by (30.13) the maximum shifts to smaller Rc and larger P0. The main
</p>
<p>effect, however, is that the minimum is less and less pronounced. This goes so
</p>
<p>far that finally the maximum, which is decisive for the existence of a Schönberg&ndash;
</p>
<p>Chandrasekhar limit, has disappeared. A similar change of the structure of the curve
</p>
<p>is obtained if, instead of decreasingMc, we increase the temperature T0.

<p>Figure 30.16 shows that for larger M the sequence of equilibrium solutions

such small M , therefore, one has only one (stable) branch and no Schönberg&ndash;

<p>in Fig. 30.15b. It shows, for example, that the curves are already monotonic for

<p>M D 1:3Mˇ and q0 � 0:1 (i.e. Mc � 0:13Mˇ/ (The exact mass values depend
not only on the chemical composition, but also on the detailed physical input of the

<p>are representative.). Instead of Rc, we might have plotted the stellar radius R over

<p>the parameter q0. As mentioned above, small Rc corresponds to large R and vice

<p>In evolutionary models one will encounter a smooth profile rather than a

<p>Evolution Through Helium Burning:
</p>
<p>Intermediate-Mass Stars
</p>
<p>31.1 Crossing the Hertzsprung Gap
</p>
<p>After central hydrogen burning, the star has a helium core, which in the absence
</p>
<p>of energy sources tends to become isothermal. Indeed thermal equilibrium would
</p>
<p>require that the models consist of an isothermal helium core (of massMc D q0M ,
radius Rc), surrounded by a hydrogen-rich envelope [of mass (1 � q0/M ] with
hydrogen burning in a shell source at its bottom. Such models were discussed in
</p>
<p>detail in Sect. 30.5. We now once more consider the case of M D 3Mˇ, which is
typical for stars on the upper part of the main sequence (say M &gt; 2:5Mˇ). The
possible solutions were comprised in a series of equilibrium models consisting of
</p>
<p>three branches. This is shown in the first graph of Fig. 30.16, and again in Fig. 31.1,
</p>
<p>which also gives schematically the position in the HR diagram.
</p>
<p>Suppose that the relative mass of the core q0 has not yet reached the
</p>
<p>Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar limit qSC.�0:1/ at the end of central hydrogen
burning. The model then can easily settle into a state contained in the
</p>
<p>uppermost branch of Fig. 31.1a, which consists of stars close to the main
</p>
<p>sequence (Fig. 31.1b). Let us imagine a &ldquo;quasi-evolution&rdquo; of this simple model
</p>
<p>by assuming thatMc grows because of shell burning while complete equilibrium is
</p>
<p>maintained. The result is that the model is shifted towards the right in Fig. 31.1a.
</p>
<p>This proceeds continuously until the model reaches the Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar
</p>
<p>limit, represented by the turning point which terminates the uppermost branch.
</p>
<p>Further increase of Mc would require the model to jump discontinuously onto the
</p>
<p>lower branch in Fig. 31.1a. This decrease of Rc (i.e. compression of the core) would
</p>
<p>be accompanied by a large jump in the HR diagram, from the main sequence to the
</p>
<p>region of the Hayashi line (Fig. 31.1b). This means that such equilibrium stars have
</p>
<p>to become giants because the main-sequence solutions (which the stars had selected
</p>
<p>owing to their history) cease to exist, while the red giant solutions (which have
</p>
<p>coexisted for a long time) are still available. In Fig. 31.1a, b the quasi-evolution of
</p>
<p>increasingMc is indicated by solid lines, while those parts which can obviously not
</p>
<p>be reached are broken. We will see that basic features of this jump in the simple

<p>Fig. 31.1 (a) The same series of equilibrium models for M D 3Mˇ as in Fig. 30.16. The core
radius Rc is plotted against the core massMc. In a quasi-evolution with increasing massMc of the

<p>isothermal helium core, the model shifts along the solid lines, as indicated by the arrows. (b) The
</p>
<p>corresponding position in the HR diagram

<p>quasi-evolution (particularly the compression of the core together with an expansion
</p>
<p>of the envelope to a red giant stage) are recovered in the real evolution which, of
</p>
<p>course, leads through non-equilibrium models. In any case, a phase of thermal
</p>
<p>non-equilibrium must follow after central hydrogen burning since a continuation
</p>
<p>via suitable equilibrium models would involve a discontinuity.
</p>
<p>As an example for the real evolution we take numerical solutions obtained
</p>
<p>for upper main-sequence stars with our standard Pop. I initial mixture .XH D
0:70;XHe D 0:28;Xrest D 0:02). This model was calculated neglecting overshoot-
ing from the convective core completely and is a continuation of the main-sequence
</p>
<p>evolution shown, for example, in Fig. 30.3. The transition from central to shell
</p>
<p>burning can be seen from Fig. 31.2a. Any line parallel to the ordinate indicates what
</p>
<p>one would encounter in different layers when moving along the radius of the star at
</p>
<p>that moment of the evolution. Figure 31.2b gives the corresponding evolutionary
</p>
<p>track in the HR diagram. The first part of Fig. 31.2a (from A to C/ shows the
</p>
<p>phase of central hydrogen burning which exhausts 1H in the core within about
</p>
<p>7:9� 107 years for 5Mˇ. With hydrogen being depleted there, the burning together
with the convection ceases rather abruptly in the central region. At the same time,
</p>
<p>hydrogen burning intensifies in an initially rather broad shell around the core, i.e.
</p>
<p>in the mass range of the outwards-increasing hydrogen content left by the shrinking
</p>
<p>convective core (cf. Fig. 30.3a). Later this shell source narrows remarkably in mass
</p>
<p>scale, particularly when it has consumed the lower tail of the hydrogen profile.
</p>
<p>After phase C the evolution is so much accelerated that the abscissa had to be
</p>
<p>expanded. The models are no longer in thermal equilibrium, i.e. the time derivatives

The star has now encountered the situation outlined earlier in this section.

<p>for the same star. After a short resettling at the end of central hydrogen burning

</p>
<p>energy released in the contracting core must flow outwards, which prevents the core
</p>
<p>from becoming isothermal. Such a massive star starts on the main sequence with
</p>
<p>relatively low central density (cf. Fig. 22.5) and therefore remains non-degenerate
</p>
<p>during the contraction phase described here, which then leads to heating. When the
</p>
<p>central temperature has reached about 108K, helium is ignited. The core has thus
</p>
<p>tapped a large new energy source which stops its rapid contraction, and the star again
</p>
<p>reaches a stage of complete (thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium. The whole core
</p>
<p>contraction from C toD has proceeded roughly on the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz timescale
</p>
<p>of the core (in 32:3 � 106 years for 5Mˇ). In the same time, the outer layers have
rapidly expanded, and the stellar radius is increased appreciably (roughly by a factor
</p>
<p>15 in Fig. 31.3).
</p>
<p>The evolutionary path in the HR diagram for the 5Mˇ star is shown in Fig. 31.2b.
The expansion transforms the star into a red giant so rapidly that there is little chance
</p>
<p>of observing it during this short phase of evolution. This explains the existence of
</p>
<p>the well-known Hertzsprung gap, an area between main sequence and red giants
</p>
<p>with a striking deficiency of observed stars. It is a direct consequence of stars with
</p>
<p>cores reaching the Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar limit after central hydrogen burning.
</p>
<p>The evolution is qualitatively similar for all stars in which helium burning is
</p>
<p>ignited before the core becomes degenerate and in which possible complications
</p>
<p>due to semiconvection cannot prevent the star frommoving close to the Hayashi line.
</p>
<p>This includes stellar masses of, say, 2:5Mˇ &lt; M &lt; 10Mˇ. A set of evolutionary
tracks in this phase for differentM is shown in Fig. 31.4.</p>

</p>
<p>In Fig. 31.2b the second track (grey line) is that of the same 5Mˇ star, but
here overshooting from the convective cores during hydrogen and helium burning is
</p>
<p>taken into account. The extent of the overshooting corresponds to about 0.2 pressure
</p>
<p>scale heights at the Schwarzschild boundary, equivalent to an increase in mass by
</p>
<p>more than 20%. The region in which material is mixed to the stellar centre is thus
</p>
<p>extended, the main-sequence evolution lasts longer, and the extension of the main-
</p>
<p>sequence phase in the HR diagram is larger. Point B along the track is 470K cooler
</p>
<p>than for the evolution without overshooting and 26% more luminous. Point C, the
</p>
<p>end of core hydrogen burning, which now lasts 96.3 instead of 79.9 Myr, moves in a
</p>
<p>similar way. The wider main sequence is observationally confirmed, and indeed the
</p>
<p>width of the upper main sequence required the inclusion of convective overshooting
</p>
<p>in stellar models for massive stars. All the subsequent evolution takes place at higher
</p>
<p>luminosity, which can be explained according to (20.20) by the larger increase of
</p>
<p>the mean molecular weight for the whole star during core hydrogen burning.
</p>
<p>31.2 Central Helium Burning
</p>
<p>As a consequence of the rapid contraction and heating of the core, central helium
</p>
<p>burning sets in (at the age of 8:3 � 107 years for our 5Mˇ star). The star is then
in the red giant region of the HR diagram, close to the Hayashi line (D&ndash;E in
</p>
<p>Fig. 31.2b). Correspondingly it has a very deep outer convection zone, which can
</p>
<p>be seen in Fig. 31.2a to reach down to m=M � 0:17. The larger M , the deeper</p>

<p>the centre of the 5Mˇ star,
</p>
<p>whose internal evolution was
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 31.2
</p>
<p>the convection zone penetrates, and it reaches into layers in which the composition
</p>
<p>was already slightly modified by the earlier hydrogen burning. Therefore some
</p>
<p>products of this burning are now dredged up by the convection and distributed all
</p>
<p>over the envelope. This is called the first dredge-up event. We here encounter one
</p>
<p>of the mechanisms by which nuclear species produced in the very deep interior
</p>
<p>can be lifted to the stellar surface. For example, the 12C=13C isotope ratio drops
</p>
<p>from its initial value of approximately 90 to values close to 20. This is the result
</p>
<p>of mixing material that has undergone CNO burning, where the equilibrium value
</p>
<p>of 12C=13C � 5 was established, with pristine matter in the envelope having the
initial value. Furthermore, the nitrogen abundance increases at the expense of that
</p>
<p>of carbon, and even the surface helium abundance increases slightly by a few per
</p>
<p>mille. The carbon isotope ratio can be determined rather accurately from stellar
</p>
<p>spectra of giants and confirms the presence of the first dredge-up and thus also the
</p>
<p>CNO burning in the deep stellar interior.
</p>
<p>The high temperature sensitivity of helium burning causes a strong concentration
</p>
<p>of the energy release towards the centre and therefore the existence of a convective
</p>
<p>core. The core contains roughly 3&ndash;4% of M , i.e. much less mass than during
</p>
<p>hydrogen burning.
</p>
<p>At first the dominant reaction is 3˛ ! 12C (cf. Sect. 18.5.2). With increasing
abundance of 12C the reaction 12C C˛ ! 16O gradually takes over. When 4He
has already become rather rare the depletion of 12C on account of 16O is larger
</p>
<p>than the production of 12C by the 3˛ reaction, and 12C decreases again after having
</p>
<p>reached a maximum abundance. This is explained by the fact that the production of
12C is proportional to X3˛ , while its depletion is proportional to X˛X12. The change
</p>
<p>of the abundances can be seen from Fig. 31.5, which shows the final composition
</p>
<p>for such stars to be 12C and 16O in roughly equal amounts with only a very small
</p>
<p>admixture of 20Ne. In the example shown, the ratio 16O/12C is 51:47; if overshooting
</p>
<p>is included in the models, it changes slightly to 55:42 due to the different history
</p>
<p>of the temperature stratification of the core. Note, however, that the final ratio of
16O/12C depends strongly on the rather uncertain reaction rate for 12C.˛; &#13;/16O.</p>

<p>31.2 Central Helium Burning 373
</p>
<p>The experimentally determined values have been varying by factors of 2&ndash;3 over the
</p>
<p>years. One of the most recent and widely used rate is that by Kunz et al. (2002),
</p>
<p>which&ndash;at 100 million K&ndash;is about 40% higher than the classical one by Caughlan
</p>
<p>and Fowler (1988), but 40% lower than the one recommended in the NACRE
</p>
<p>compilation (Angulo et al. 1999). Generally, the 16O=12C ratio as well as 20Ne/16O
</p>
<p>increases with increasing stellar mass, since T increases.
</p>
<p>The phase of central helium burning lasts roughly 1:6 � 107 years, which is
about 20% of the duration of the main-sequence phase. This fraction seems to be
</p>
<p>surprisingly large in view of the facts that nowL is somewhat higher, the exhausted

<p>core is much smaller, and the specific gain of energy (per unit of mass of the fuel)
</p>
<p>is only 1/10, as compared with hydrogen burning. The simple reason is that most of
</p>
<p>the total energy output in this phase comes from hydrogen-shell-source burning. For
</p>
<p>a star of 5Mˇ helium burning contributes only about 7%, 26%, and 42% at points
E;F; andG, respectively: a rather small release of nuclear energy inside the core is
</p>
<p>obviously sufficient to prevent it from contraction and to bring the whole star nearly
</p>
<p>into thermal equilibrium. The luminosity LHe produced between points E and F
</p>
<p>by helium burning in a helium core of massMHe is roughly equal to the luminosity
</p>
<p>a pure helium star of M D MHe would have on the helium main sequence (cf.
Sect. 23.1). In fact the helium-burning core resembles in several respects a star on
</p>
<p>the helium main sequence with M D MHe. For later applications we note that the
radius RHe of the core changes rather little during most of this phase. It increases
</p>
<p>very slowly until the central helium content has dropped to XHe � 0:3. It is only
in the final phase of central helium burning (XHe &lt; 0:1) that the core contracts and
</p>
<p>RHe drops appreciably (cf. Fig. 31.3). It should be mentioned that the evolution will
</p>
<p>be affected by convective overshooting, which enlarges the convective core also
</p>
<p>during central helium burning, but does not extend its duration appreciably. The
</p>
<p>larger supply of nuclear fuel is compensated by the higher luminosity. In case of the
</p>
<p>star shown in Fig. 31.2b it lasts 1:59 � 107 years.
Let us now look at the HR diagram in Fig. 31.2b. After point E the star (the one
</p>
<p>calculated without overshooting, but this discussion applies also to the more general
</p>
<p>case, as can be seen from Fig. 31.4) goes at first down along the Hayashi line, then
</p>
<p>leaves this line andmoves back to the left. The &ldquo;bluest&rdquo; pointF; for 5Mˇ, is reached
after 1:4 � 107 years (88% of the helium-burning phase) when the central helium
content is down to about XHe � 0:15. The track then leads back towards point G
in the vicinity of the Hayashi line. The further evolution in which another loop may
</p>
<p>occur will be discussed in Sect. 31.5.
</p>
<p>The extension of the loops, i.e. the distance of their bluest points from the
</p>
<p>Hayashi line, depends on the stellar mass M. We limit the discussion to a range
</p>
<p>of not too large masses, say M &lt; 10Mˇ, where the situation is relatively simple
and clear. Large loops are obtained for stars with large M . With decreasing
</p>
<p>M the loops become gradually smaller and finally degenerate to a mere down
</p>
<p>and up along the Hayashi line. This can be seen in Fig. 31.4, which gives the
</p>
<p>evolutionary tracks for a comparable set of computations. The loops for different
</p>
<p>stellar masses cover a roughly wedge-shaped area which is bordered by the Hayashi

<p>line and the connection of the bluest points of the loops (i.e. points F where Teff</p>

</p>
<p>helium-burning stars as red giants in the area of the HR diagram covered by the

<p>loops. This is in fact the case, as can be seen from HR diagrams of open clusters
</p>
<p>(see, e.g. Fig. 31.6). They often show a more or less extended giant branch, which
</p>
<p>is clearly separated from the main sequence by the Hertzsprung gap, and which sets
</p>
<p>out nicely the range of loops for the corresponding values ofM .
</p>
<p>31.3 The Cepheid Phase
</p>
<p>It is of particular significance that the loops are necessary for explaining the
</p>
<p>observed ı Cephei variables. The observations show that these stars are giants,
</p>
<p>located in the HR diagram in a narrow strip roughly parallel to the Hayashi line
</p>
<p>and a few 102K wide (cf. Fig. 31.4). Indeed the theory of stellar pulsations which
</p>
<p>will be described in Chap. 40 predicts that a star is vibrationally unstable if it is
</p>
<p>located in the &ldquo;instability strip&rdquo; of the HR diagram, where the observed Cepheids
</p>
<p>are found (Fig. 31.6). This is a consequence of the way in which the outer stellar
</p>
<p>envelope (particularly the helium ionization zone) reacts on small perturbations.
</p>
<p>When a stellar model has evolved into the instability strip, the oscillation will grow
</p>
<p>to finite, observable amplitudes. This phenomenon does not show up in the normal
</p>
<p>evolutionary calculations which are carried out by neglecting the inertia terms in the
</p>
<p>equation of motion, since these terms are necessary to obtain an oscillation at all.
</p>
<p>The calculated evolution therefore gives only the unperturbed solution.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>376 31 Evolution Through Helium Burning: Intermediate-Mass Stars
</p>
<p>The evolutionary tracks discussed above cross the instability strip up to three
</p>
<p>times. For all stars a first crossing occurs in the short phase of core contraction
</p>
<p>when the star moves from C to D (Fig. 31.4). This passage is so rapid that there is
</p>
<p>scarcely a chance for observing a star as a Cepheid in this phase. So we are left with
</p>
<p>the much slower second and third passages, which occur only for sufficiently large
</p>
<p>loops. According to Fig. 31.4 this is roughly the case for all stars withM � 5Mˇ.
This lower mass limit for Cepheids depends of course on all the uncertainties of the
</p>
<p>loops in the computed evolutionary tracks.
</p>
<p>The theory of stellar pulsations (Chaps. 40 and 41) also gives the period ˘ of
</p>
<p>the oscillation. For the evolutionary models the theory in fact yields values of ˘
</p>
<p>comparable with the observed Cepheid periods, which are in the range of 1&ndash;100
</p>
<p>days. In a first approximation,˘ is shown to depend only on the mean density N% of
the whole star as

</p>
<p>Indeed˘ is of the order of the hydrostatic timescale �hydr introduced in (2.19).
</p>
<p>Since the Cepheid strip is rather narrow, each passage defines reasonably well a
</p>
<p>pair of average values of L and R; and (31.1) then gives the corresponding period
</p>
<p>˘ . When going from the lowest to the highest passages in Fig. 31.2b, we find that
</p>
<p>˘ increases since its variation is dominated by the increase of R; which enters into
</p>
<p>N% with the third power. In fact, this, together with the properties of the instability
strip discussed in Chap. 41, will be shown to lead to the famous ˘&ndash;L relation

<p>of Cepheids, which is the basic standard for the determination of extragalactic

on the number of Cepheids to be expected. It turns out that this number should

<p>increase substantially towards smaller values of ˘ , reach a maximum (at a period
</p>
<p>of a few days), and then drop steeply, since the loops no longer reach the Cepheid

</p>
<p>A less favourable result concerns the masses of the Cepheids. One value,

<p>called the &ldquo;evolutionary mass&rdquo; Mev, can be obtained with the help of evolutionary
</p>
<p>calculations essentially by comparing the luminosities. On the other hand, non-

</p>
<p>on M , and a comparison with observed light curves gives a &ldquo;pulsational mass&rdquo;

<p>Mpul. Now one finds that Mev notoriously exceeds Mpul by 15&ndash;20%. This result
</p>
<p>is confirmed by a handful of Cepheids for which the mass can be determined from

<p>the dynamics of binary systems. This problem has been amply discussed in the

<p>literature (Cox 1980; Keller 2008). Two solutions are considered: either the stars

</p>
<p>convective overshooting increases the mass of the helium core and the luminosity
</p>
<p>of Cepheids (see Fig. 31.2b), such that for given ˘ , hence L, a lower mass Mev is
</p>
<p>deduced. The latter solution appears to be the more realistic one (Keller 2008), as
</p>
<p>it appears to solve the problem for Cepheids with dynamic masses (Fig. 31.7). On</p>

</p>
<p>the other hand, overshooting tends to reduce the loops through the instability strip
</p>
<p>both because largerMHe leads to less extended loops (cf. Sect. 31.4) and because of
</p>
<p>the fact that the instability strip is inclined to higher Teff for higher luminosity. For
</p>
<p>some stellar masses and compositions models with overshooting therefore avoid the
</p>
<p>Cepheid phase altogether.
</p>
<p>We have dwelt at length on this short phase of evolution, since the Cepheids are
</p>
<p>important and offer a major fraction of those rare cases which, at least in principle,
</p>
<p>allow a quantitative test of the theory.
</p>
<p>31.4 To Loop or Not to Loop : : :
</p>
<p>In Sect. 31.3 we saw how important it is to find evolutionary tracks looping through
</p>
<p>the red giant region during central helium burning. It was all the more noteworthy
</p>
<p>when one learned that the loops depend critically on some uncertain input param-
</p>
<p>eters (e.g. �; ", treatment of convection, composition) used in the calculations. A
</p>
<p>detailed classification of all influences, including their mutual interaction, is far too
</p>
<p>involved. Rather we point out a few characteristic properties of the models which
</p>
<p>allow a phenomenological prediction on the looping (We here follow the discussion
</p>
<p>Strittmatter 1972).
</p>
<p>For not too large masses (say, M . 7Mˇ/, the evolution through the loops
is so slow that the "g terms scarcely play a role. So we can reproduce the loops
</p>
<p>sufficiently well by models in complete equilibrium. Let us again consider solutions
</p>
<p>for the helium core (mass Mc, radius Rc, luminosity l0) and for the hydrogen-rich
</p>
<p>envelope separately before fitting them to a full solution. The core luminosity l0
is supplied by central helium burning; hydrogen-shell burning at the bottom of the
</p>
<p>envelope gives the additional luminosity L&ndash;l0.
</p>
<p>For given chemical composition a solution for the envelope can be obtained after
</p>
<p>specifying a pair of values Rc; l0 as inner boundary conditions at m D Mc (This is
quite analogous to the usual central conditions r D l D 0 at m D 0:). Any solution
gives a point in the HR diagram as well as pressure and temperature aMc, i.e. values
</p>
<p>forL; Teff; P0; T0. For the first part of the loop, helium burning contributes relatively
</p>
<p>little to L: Consequently we may approximate the envelope by setting l0 D 0 (This
can be done, of course, only for the calculation of the envelope which is dominated
</p>
<p>by hydrogen burning; in the core, l0 cannot be neglected since it represents the whole
</p>
<p>local luminosity of this region.). The envelope solutions there form a two-parameter
</p>
<p>set in which we treatMc; Rc as free parameters.
</p>
<p>Next we look for a simple description of the chemical composition in the
</p>
<p>envelope. Figure 31.8a shows a typical hydrogen profile. A rather moderate increase
</p>
<p>of XH is the relic of hydrogen consumption in the convective core during the main-
</p>
<p>sequence phase. The very narrow shell source has already eaten away the lower part
</p>
<p>of this profile (dashed) and produced a steep increase of XH above the momentary
</p>
<p>of Lauterborn et al. 1971a,b; for other descriptions see Robertson 1971; Fricke and</p>

<p>as shown in Fig. 31.8b. The further shell burning will obviously increase Mc and
</p>
<p>decrease�m and �X .
</p>
<p>Now the envelope solution and its position in the HR diagram depend on the
</p>
<p>four parametersMc; Rc �m;�X . We would like to have a simple function of these
</p>
<p>parameters which can serve as a measure for the separation from the Hayashi line.
</p>
<p>The back-and-forth motion in the loop would then correspond to a non-monotonic
</p>
<p>variation of this function. A hint for a suitable procedure can be found in Fig. 31.1.
</p>
<p>The envelopes there shift monotonically to the right in the HR diagram, while the
</p>
<p>cores move through all three branches of the series of equilibrium models with
</p>
<p>increasing ratioMc=Rc. This is essentially the surface potential of the core and plays
</p>
<p>a decisive role in many descriptions of radial expansion and contraction during the
</p>
<p>evolution. So we consider an &ldquo;effective core potential&rdquo;:

of the influence of the chemical profile. We normalize it by setting h D 1 for a
simple step profile .�m D �X D 0) and specify it later for other profiles. For a
step profile and forM D 5Mˇ five sequences of envelope solutions with constant
Mc are shown in Fig. 31.9. The plotted lines ' D constant illustrate that ' may

<p>h D econstant��m��X (31.5)
</p>
<p>is sufficient. Here h depends only on the product �m � �X , i.e. to say on the
amount of excess helium in and just above the shell source. The profile influences
</p>
<p>the envelope mainly through a hydrostatic effect.
</p>
<p>Finally, relations betweenMc and Rc have to be derived from solutions for the

<p>core. Each solution of an envelope of givenMc; Rc yields a pair of valuesP0; T0. For

<p>each Mc we vary Rc and get the functions P0.Rc) and T0.Rc), which are taken as

'cr). Therefore this factor tends to increase ' when the shell source burns outwards.
</p>
<p>We then have, in addition, the influence of the chemical evolution of the core on
</p>
<p>Rc. As mentioned earlier, an appreciable effect occurs only after the central helium
</p>
<p>content has dropped below, say, 0.1. The following rapid decrease of Rc tends to

<p>increase '. Both these effects (the increase of Mc and the decrease of Rc) tend to
</p>
<p>shift the model to the right in the HR diagram and may therefore finish a loop, but
</p>
<p>they can never start it.
</p>
<p>Obviously the responsibility for the onset of a loop rests with the function h: In

<p>fact, when the shell source burns farther into the profile,�m and�X (cf. Fig. 31.8)

<p>M . 4Mˇ). High values ofM bring '.E/ close to 'cr, and therefore in the further
evolution ' goes below 'cr. A case with 'min &lt; 'cr is illustrated in Fig. 31.10.When
</p>
<p>' drops below 'cr the model detaches from the Hayashi line and starts looping to
</p>
<p>the left. The turn to the right begins at point F when ' D 'min.
Now it is obvious that many factors can modify the loops. For example, all
</p>
<p>properties changing the ratio of the timescales for central helium burning and
</p>
<p>shell burning can shift 'min and thus the bluest point of the loop. In particular,
</p>
<p>we have to mention all the uncertainties concerning convection. Appreciable
</p>
<p>overshooting on the main sequence shifts the whole profile outwards. This
</p>
<p>can increase Mc and consequently '.E/ � 'cr such that the loop becomes
smaller if it is not completely suppressed. Other factors affect the decisive
</p>
<p>upper part of the hydrogen profile. Aside from careless integrations during the
</p>
<p>main-sequence phase there are also physical uncertainties which can leave faulty
</p>
<p>profiles in the models. An example is the mixing by the outer convection zone
</p>
<p>during its deepest penetration, which in turn depends on the chosen mixing length
</p>
<p>in the superadiabatic layer. A similar problem causes the semiconvective region in
</p>
<p>main-sequence stars of large M (cf. Sect. 30.4.2). The assumption that this region
</p>
<p>is fully mixed leads to a plateau in the calculated profile with a discontinuous drop
</p>
<p>ofXH at its bottom. The presence or absence of this plateau must strongly influence
</p>
<p>the function h: Correspondingly the literature presents quite different evolutionary
</p>
<p>tracks for massive stars during helium burning (some with loops near the Hayashi
</p>
<p>line, others more to the left and completely detached from this line) for different
</p>
<p>assumptions on the semiconvective mixing.
</p>
<p>In the following we present some examples for these effects. In Fig. 31.11 the
</p>
<p>evolution of a 9Mˇ star is shown for two different chemical compositions and
different treatment of convection as well as a numerical aspect. In the top panel</p>

with Schwarzschild criterion and without overshooting, which is included in the model shown by

<p>the dashed line. The solid grey line is using the same physical assumptions as in the first case, but
</p>
<p>with a coarse spatial resolution during the core hydrogen burning phase. (b) (bottom panel): for
</p>
<p>X D 0:66, Z D 0:04. The two lines correspond to the cases without (solid) and with (dashed)
overshooting
</p>
<p>(for a case with Z D 0:02) the inclusion of overshooting (dashed line) simply
shifts the track to higher luminosity, as expected, with respect to the &ldquo;standard&rdquo;
</p>
<p>case without overshooting and using the Schwarzschild criterion for convection.
</p>
<p>However, when reducing the spatial resolution of the model (solid grey line), the
</p>
<p>chemical profile at the end of core hydrogen burning differs from the standard case,
</p>
<p>such that near the end of core helium burning convection brings fresh helium from
</p>
<p>outside the convective helium core, leading to a rejuvenation of the helium burning
</p>
<p>and resulting is a second loop before the star finally returns to the Hayashi line. Note
</p>
<p>that all calculations were terminated once helium at the centre was exhausted.
</p>
<p>In the lower panel of Fig. 31.11, for Z D 0:04, the standard case is shown again
(solid line), which is similar to the standard case for the previous mixture. However,
</p>
<p>in this case, overshooting (dashed line) enlarges the convective core sufficiently such
</p>
<p>that the loop is reduced to a very small &ldquo;looplet&rdquo; close to the Hayashi line. These
</p>
<p>numerical results agree well with the analysis done above.</p>

</p>
<p>A further example how different assumptions concerning convection affect the

<p>loops can be found in Fig. 32.1 for a star of 15Mˇ. In this particular case, the
use of the Ledoux criterion and semiconvective mixing lead to a quite extended
</p>
<p>loop, while the application of the Schwarzschild criterion as well as the inclusion of
</p>
<p>overshooting suppress it.
</p>
<p>We see that details, which have originated from different regions and from earlier

<p>phases when the effects were scarcely recognizable, can now pop up and modify the

<p>evolution appreciably. The present phase is a sort of magnifying glass, also revealing

<p>Finally, we demonstrate in Fig. 31.12 that the crossing of the Hertzsprung gap

<p>Hertzsprung gap crossing on a thermal timescale of about 1:1 � 105 years (taken as
the time between logTeff D 4:2 and 3.7); the leftward evolution on the blue loop
(from logTeff D 3:65 to 4.0) lasts 9 � 104 years. The looplet, in contrast, needs
almost 3 � 106 years.</p>

<p>384 31 Evolution Through Helium Burning: Intermediate-Mass Stars
</p>
<p>31.5 After Central Helium Burning
</p>
<p>In the central core, helium burning terminates when 4He is completely processed
</p>
<p>to 12C, 16O, and 20Ne (in various ratios, depending on the temperatures, i.e. on the
</p>
<p>stellar mass, and on the reaction rates used). The burning continues in a concentric
</p>
<p>shell surrounding the exhausted core, and the formation of this shell source for
</p>
<p>5Mˇ can be seen in Fig. 31.2a. While the helium shell burns outwards, the CO
core increases in mass and contracts. Obviously the situation resembles that before
</p>
<p>central helium burning. Now, however, the star has two shell sources, since the
</p>
<p>hydrogen shell is still burning at the bottom of the hydrogen-rich envelope. In the
</p>
<p>model shown in Fig. 31.2b the star then begins a steep upward evolution in the HR
</p>
<p>diagram. In some cases a second, smaller loop is initiated depending on the same
</p>
<p>quantities as mentioned in Sect. 31.4. In this phase the helium region between the
</p>
<p>two shell sources expands, and the temperature in the hydrogen-shell source drops
</p>
<p>so far that hydrogen burning ceases. The mass of the CO core roughly doubles. The
</p>
<p>hydrogen later reignites and can compete with the energy release by the helium shell
</p>
<p>only when the stellar luminosity has increased by almost a factor of ten and when
</p>
<p>the CO-core has again doubled its mass to � 0:16M ). These two quantities are in
fact correlated, as we shall see in Chaps. 33 and 35.
</p>
<p>From Fig. 31.2a we see that the outer convective envelope gradually reaches
</p>
<p>further down until it contains more than 80% of the stellar mass. Its lower boundary
</p>
<p>clearly penetrates into a range of mass through which the hydrogen-shell source has
</p>
<p>burned during the preceding�107 years, processing all 1H to 4He, and nearly all 12C
and 16O to 14N. These nuclei are now dredged up by the outer convection zone and
</p>
<p>can appear at the surface. This is usually called the phase of the second dredge-up,
</p>
<p>during which also the surface helium content, which has risen from an initial value
</p>
<p>of 0.28 to 0.29 during the first dredge-up, increases again to 0.31 in this example.
</p>
<p>It happens only in a mass range above 3&ndash;5Mˇ, but not for massive stars.
With the inward motion of the lower border of convection, the H&ndash;He discon-
</p>
<p>tinuity has come rather close to the helium-shell source where T � 2 � 108K.
This hot helium shell moves outwards until it is close enough to the hydrogen-
</p>
<p>rich layers so that they heat up and hydrogen is ignited&ndash;the hydrogen-shell source
</p>
<p>is reactivated. This mixing of hydrogen at the same time reduces the mass of the
</p>
<p>hydrogen-exhausted core, which will later become the white-dwarf remnant of such
</p>
<p>stars. The second dredge-up therefore prevents the formation of more massive white
</p>
<p>dwarfs, too.
</p>
<p>Before we continue discussing the stars in this mass range in Chap. 35, we have to
</p>
<p>describe the evolution of massive and low-mass stars through central helium burning
</p>
<p>in the next chapters.</p>

<p>Chapter 32
</p>
<p>Evolution Through Helium Burning:
</p>
<p>Massive Stars
</p>
<p>The evolution of massive stars (stars with M &amp; 8 � � � 10) through the phases of
central hydrogen and helium burning would be quite similar to that of intermediate-
</p>
<p>mass stars (Chap. 31) if it were not for a few effects that influence it appreciably
</p>
<p>and which are specific for this mass range. The fact that the size of the convective
</p>
<p>core is encompassing large fractions of the star (Fig. 22.7) makes uncertainties
</p>
<p>connectedwith the treatment of convection even more important. These are twofold:
</p>
<p>semiconvection and overshooting, which we introduced already in Sect. 30.4.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, massive stars are known to have intensive mass loss, which in some
</p>
<p>cases are able to uncover the cores such that layers with a composition modified
</p>
<p>by nuclear fusion processes become visible. These are the so-called Wolf-Rayet
</p>
<p>stars. Finally, massive stars can rotate with surface rotation speeds of up to a few
</p>
<p>hundred km/s, or to an appreciable fraction of the break-up speed. This leads, as we
</p>
<p>will see in Chap. 44, to additional mixing processes beyond convective mixing, and
</p>
<p>further effects. The modelling of massive star evolution therefore becomes quite
</p>
<p>complicated and uncertain because of these physical effects which are not well
</p>
<p>understood. We will discuss their general influence in the following.
</p>
<p>32.1 Semiconvection
</p>
<p>The problem of semiconvection was already introduced and illustrated in
</p>
<p>Sect. 30.4.2 and Fig. 30.12. It is of particular importance for the evolution of stars
</p>
<p>above, say, 10Mˇ, and results from the fact that the convective core contains less
and less mass during the main-sequence evolution. This &ldquo;shrinking&rdquo; of the core
</p>
<p>is due to the increasing concentration of nuclear energy production, taking place
</p>
<p>via the CNO cycles, towards the centre with increasing core temperature. It leaves
</p>
<p>behind a region of varying chemical composition around the convective core, with
</p>
<p>material that experienced only some amount of nuclear fusion surrounding inner
</p>
<p>layers, where the conversion of hydrogen to helium proceeded further. In these
</p>
<p>layers, both the stabilizing molecular gradient r� and the radiative temperature

with different treatments of core convection. The solid black line is the resulting evolution if
</p>
<p>the Schwarzschild criterion is applied, the dotted one in case of the Ledoux criterion, with slow
</p>
<p>semiconvective mixing, and the dashed one for the case with the inclusion of overshooting and the
</p>
<p>Schwarzschild criterion. The grey solid line, finally, has been computed with more overshooting
</p>
<p>and additional mass loss
</p>
<p>gradient rrad are strongly oscillating functions of depth, depending on the exact
chemical profile left behind by the shrinking core. In numerical models this profile
</p>
<p>depends on the spatial and temporal resolution of the models and their evolution,
</p>
<p>but also, for example, on the detailed interpolation in sets of opacity tables. In
</p>
<p>particular, it is quite important how accurately the varying chemical composition
</p>
<p>at each position inside the star is represented by these tables. As a consequence of
</p>
<p>these fluctuating terms in (30.10), the stability condition may be fulfilled in some
</p>
<p>parts of these critical regions, but not in others. The result is a region above the
</p>
<p>core with fluctuating radiative and convective layers, the exact structure of which is
</p>
<p>rather uncertain to compute.
</p>
<p>If the Schwarzschild criterion for convection is used, the stabilizing molecular
</p>
<p>weight gradient in (30.10) is omitted and the layers become convective more easily
</p>
<p>and earlier in the evolution. This is the situation displayed in the top panel of
</p>
<p>Fig. 30.12 for a sample calculation of a 15Mˇ star. Since the separation between
the convective core and the semiconvective layers outside of it may be rather small,
</p>
<p>a connection of both may occur, which &ldquo;rejuvenates&rdquo; the core by mixing fresh
</p>
<p>hydrogen into the burning region. The main-sequence evolution is thus extended and
</p>
<p>happens at higher luminosities. In Fig. 32.1 we show the resulting evolutionary track
</p>
<p>in the HR diagram (solid line) of a calculation, in which this effect was avoided. In
</p>
<p>this case the core helium burning is starting already during the evolution towards the
</p>
<p>red region, at a temperature of logTeff D 4:17 (we have set, rather arbitrarily, this
phase to the point, when the helium luminosity has reached 20% of the hydrogen</p>

</p>
<p>luminosity). This is at an age of 9.35Myr, and the core helium burning lasts for
</p>
<p>another 1.43Myr. At that time the star is beyond the luminosity minimum close to
</p>
<p>the red (super-)giant region. The onset of core helium burning is connected with the
</p>
<p>small loop at logTeff � 4:15.
The lower panel in Fig. 30.12 and the dotted line in Fig. 32.1 correspond to
</p>
<p>the case of the Ledoux criterion. In this case the semiconvective layers above the
</p>
<p>shrinking core mix only slowly, and a more gradual chemical gradient between
</p>
<p>the hydrogen-exhausted core and the envelope is maintained. This is illustrated in
</p>
<p>Fig. 32.2, which compares the hydrogen profile at the end of the main sequence
</p>
<p>for the two criteria for convective stability. In the Ledoux case, the profile in the
</p>
<p>outer parts of the initially convective core (out to m=M � 0:35) is very smooth,
whereas in the case of the Schwarzschild criterion it shows steps due to the sporadic
</p>
<p>appearance of localized convective regions.
</p>
<p>In the Ledoux case, the main sequence lasts longer for 1.4Myr, and the helium
</p>
<p>burning starts only 40,000 years later, at logL=Lˇ D 4:41 and logTeff D 3:78,
i.e. after the star has crossed the Hertzsprung gap on a thermal timescale and is
</p>
<p>approaching the luminosity minimum close to the Hayashi line, along which it
</p>
<p>quickly ascends within a few 104 years. Due to the deep convective envelope the
</p>
<p>chemical composition is homogeneous down to m=M � 0:25 (Fig. 32.2, lines
showing the helium profile), while in the Schwarzschild case, steps still exist,
</p>
<p>because at this stage, when the central helium content is 0.48, the star has not yet
</p>
<p>reached the red giant region.
</p>
<p>The most striking difference is the blue loop that the Ledoux model performs
</p>
<p>during core helium burning. At its hottest extension, the central helium content is
</p>
<p>reduced to 19%; it is exhausted when the star is about halfway back to the giant
</p>
<p>region. This phase lasts for 1.23Myr, comparable to the duration of central core
</p>
<p>helium burning in the Schwarzschild case. The fact that stars in that mass range,
</p>
<p>calculated using the Ledoux criterion for convection and under the assumption of
</p>
<p>slow semiconvective mixing, first become red giants and then perform blue loops
</p>
<p>was very crucial in explaining the pre-explosion evolution of the progenitor of
</p>
<p>supernova SN1987A, a star known as Sanduleak �69ı202 (see, e.g. Woosley et al.
1988; Langer 1989).
</p>
<p>32.2 Overshooting
</p>
<p>The effect of overshooting on the interior evolution of the same star is visible
</p>
<p>in the middle panel of Fig. 30.12. The evolutionary path in the HR diagram
</p>
<p>(Fig. 32.1) is shifted in a similar way as was shown in Fig. 31.2b, i.e. to higher
</p>
<p>luminosities. Due to the enlarged convectivelymixed core, central hydrogen burning
</p>
<p>lasts now for 12.12Myr, i.e. about 2.8Myr (30%) longer than for the case without
</p>
<p>overshooting. This corresponds roughly to the increased amount of fuel for the
</p>
<p>nuclear fusion, which can also be recognized from the hydrogen profile shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 32.2. Note also that overshooting has the additional effect of creating a</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 32.1. Shown are the hydrogen and helium mass fractions (indicated by the usual symbols
</p>
<p>X and Y ) as function of relative mass. The solid lines refer to the models calculated with the
</p>
<p>Schwarzschild criterion, the dashed lines to those with the Ledoux criterion for convection, and
</p>
<p>finally the dotted ones to the case with convective overshooting. The models were taken at the end
</p>
<p>of the main sequence when the central hydrogen abundance had been reduced to 0.01, and during
</p>
<p>core helium burning, when the central helium abundance is at 0.48
</p>
<p>smooth chemical profile. The increase in luminosity of 4 logL=Lˇ � 0:11 at
the end of the main sequence agrees well with a simple estimate using (20.20),
</p>
<p>which predicts L � �4, where � is the mean molecular weight obtained from
that of the hydrogen-rich envelope and of the helium-rich core. � increases from
</p>
<p>0.83 to 0.90 when overshooting is enlarging the core, and therefore logL by
</p>
<p>approximately 0:14. Core helium burning starts again halfway through the crossing
</p>
<p>of the HR diagram, but without a visible feature in the track, and lasts for another
</p>
<p>1.2Myr. Although overshooting enlarges the convective helium-burning core, too,
</p>
<p>the increased luminosity leads to an overall reduced duration of this nuclear phase.
</p>
<p>This star does not perform any loop. This agrees with the similarity of the helium
</p>
<p>profile with that of the Schwarzschild case (Fig. 32.2).
</p>
<p>Overshooting is even more important for more massive stars. Figure 32.3 shows
</p>
<p>evolutionary tracks for stars of 40 and 50Mˇ. For reference, the solid track of the
40Mˇ star was calculated without any overshooting, while the dotted grey line
does include it. The broadening of the main-sequence phase and the increase in
</p>
<p>luminosity are obvious. The core hydrogen burning phase is extended from 4.47 to
</p>
<p>4.69Myrs, too. The models for the 50Mˇ star all include overshooting, but differ in
the criterion for convection. One realizes that until the end of core hydrogen burning
</p>
<p>(after 4.14 respectively 4.12Myrs), both tracks are almost identical, but differ
</p>
<p>afterwards, when the newly established hydrogen shell encounters the hydrogen
</p>
<p>profile, which, due to the use of the Schwarzschild (dotted line) or Ledoux (solid
</p>
<p>line) criterion, is different. As we discussed in the previous section, the treatment of
</p>
<p>convection influences strongly the post-main-sequence evolution!</p>

<p>32.3 Mass Loss 389
</p>
<p>Fig. 32.3 Evolution of 40 and 50Mˇ stellar models calculated with various assumptions concern-
</p>
<p>ing semiconvection, overshooting, and mass loss. For the 40Mˇ star three cases are shown: one
</p>
<p>with neither overshooting nor mass loss using the Schwarzschild criterion for convection (black
</p>
<p>solid track), one with strong overshooting (grey dotted), and one with additional mass loss (black
</p>
<p>dot dashed). In total, this last model loses about 5Mˇ. The black solid line for the 50Mˇ star
</p>
<p>refers to a case with overshooting and mass loss; the Ledoux criterion for convection was used
</p>
<p>here. For comparison, using the Schwarzschild criterion results in the grey dotted line. Finally, the
</p>
<p>grey dash-dotted line corresponds to a case with significantly enhanced mass loss. The final mass
</p>
<p>of this model is 28Mˇ compared to 37.5 and 42:4Mˇ in the former cases
</p>
<p>32.3 Mass Loss
</p>
<p>In addition to the complications of the interior evolution due to convection, the
</p>
<p>evolution of massive stars is also much stronger influenced by mass loss due to
</p>
<p>stellar winds than that of stars of low and intermediate mass. These strong stellar
</p>
<p>winds are driven by the radiation field and therefore increase with luminosity and
</p>
<p>effective temperature (the energy density of radiation scales with T 4eff). For a review
</p>
<p>of winds from hot stars, see Kudritzki and Puls (2000). In the following we used the
</p>
<p>empirical mass loss formula by Vink et al. (2001) in our models.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 32.1 (grey solid line) we show the evolution of the 15Mˇ model when
mass loss is added and the amount of overshooting is increased even further, to
</p>
<p>now about 0:3HP. Accordingly, luminosity increases even further, and the main-
</p>
<p>sequence phase extends over 12.8Myr. The mass loss rate on the main sequence
</p>
<p>is of the order of 1 � 2 � 10�8Mˇ=year and drops by a factor of a few when the
star gets cooler. At the end of helium burning 1:15Mˇ is lost due to stellar winds.
Since the amount of mass loss is below 10% of the initial mass, the influence on
</p>
<p>the track, when compared to the case with overshooting, but no mass loss (dashed),
</p>
<p>is very small.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>390 32 Evolution Through Helium Burning: Massive Stars
</p>
<p>This is different for the two stars of Fig. 32.3. The 40Mˇ star, when calculated
with mass loss (black dot-dashed line), loses mass at a level close to 10�6Mˇ=year,
which amounts, over the main-sequence lifetime of 4.54Myrs to a reduction to
</p>
<p>35:52Mˇ. Since the mass loss timescale is much longer than the nuclear timescale,
the star can always adjust to the reduced mass and evolves at any time similar to
</p>
<p>a star of the same instantaneous constant mass. Note, however, that the width of
</p>
<p>the main-sequence phase, that is the effective temperature of the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; indicating
</p>
<p>the end of core hydrogen burning is very similar to that of the track without mass
</p>
<p>loss. The convective core of the star is not influenced very much by the mass loss
</p>
<p>from the stellar surface. Until the end of core helium burning, the star loses only a
</p>
<p>further 0:03Mˇ; this is due to the short duration of this phase and the cooler stellar
temperatures, which reduce the mass loss rate by more than an order of magnitude.
</p>
<p>All calculations of the 50Mˇ star have been done with mass loss. However, in
the case shown by the grey dash-dotted line the mass loss rate by Vink et al. was
</p>
<p>artificially enhanced by a factor 3. While the stellar mass in the cases with normal
</p>
<p>mass loss amounts to 42:5Mˇ after the main-sequence, here the model loses 12Mˇ
over 4.47Myrs. Mass loss after the main sequence is negligible in all cases. Since
</p>
<p>this enhanced mass loss is so strong, the star can no longer evolve unperturbed.
</p>
<p>One can see this in the early part of the main sequence: instead of increasing in
</p>
<p>luminosity, the track bends down trying to follow a sequence of unevolved stars
</p>
<p>of decreasing mass. Only during the second half of core hydrogen burning, when
</p>
<p>the nuclear timescale is further reduced, the usual evolution proceeds, but at lower
</p>
<p>luminosity and also with a smaller extension of the main sequence. Indeed, the
</p>
<p>convective core is smaller than in the cases with normal mass loss (17 instead of
</p>
<p>27Mˇ in this phase; compare this to 22Mˇ of the 40Mˇ star with Schwarzschild
criterion, the evolution of which resembles most closely this one).
</p>
<p>The maximum mass loss rate is 5 � 10�6Mˇ=year for the last case presented.
With even more extreme mass loss, up to 10�4Mˇ=year and above, the track would
even turn around and the star evolve to temperatures higher than the main sequence
</p>
<p>(compare this to the generalized main sequences of Sect. 23.3 for large values of
</p>
<p>q0). During this evolution, the wind would uncover nuclear-processed layers of the
</p>
<p>star: first hydrogen-rich layers with high nitrogen abundance (from CNO-burning),
</p>
<p>later helium-rich layers, and even later possibly carbon-rich, hydrogen-free layers
</p>
<p>that experienced helium burning. These different surface compositions define the
</p>
<p>sequence of different types of Wolf-Rayet stars (WN, WC). Such models have been
</p>
<p>computed and presented by, for example, Maeder and Meynet (1987). However,
</p>
<p>stars with such strong winds can no longer be considered as having an optically thin
</p>
<p>atmosphere on top of the opaque interior. Instead, interior, atmosphere, circumstellar
</p>
<p>envelope and hot, fast stellar wind should be treated together and consistently (see,
</p>
<p>e.g. Schaerer 1996).
</p>
<p>The evolution of massive stars is further influenced significantly by rotation and
</p>
<p>the mixing of the interior induced by rotation (see Chap. 43). Massive stars are
</p>
<p>known to rotate with surface velocities of several hundred km/s, sometimes close
</p>
<p>to break-up velocities. Modelling rotating stars is an active field of research going
</p>
<p>beyond the scope of this book. Therefore we refer the reader to the monograph by

</p>
<p>Evolution Through Helium Burning:
</p>
<p>Low-Mass Stars
</p>
<p>33.1 Post-Main-Sequence Evolution
</p>
<p>Compared to more massive stars, those of lower masses (typically M &lt; 2:3Mˇ)
evolve in a qualitatively different way after the exhaustion of hydrogen in their
</p>
<p>central regions. There are several reasons for this difference. Low-mass main-
</p>
<p>sequence stars have small, or no, convective cores, and degeneracy is important,
</p>
<p>if not on the main sequence, then shortly afterwards. In addition they start at a point
</p>
<p>on the main sequence much closer to the Hayashi line than the starting points of
</p>
<p>massive stars.
</p>
<p>For example, if hydrogen is consumed in a well-mixed convective core, there
</p>
<p>will be a helium core of appreciable mass at the very end of central hydrogen
</p>
<p>burning. However, stars of around 1Mˇ have no convective cores; they consume
hydrogen as illustrated in Fig. 30.1. Consequently they produce a growing helium
</p>
<p>core starting at zero mass. Therefore there is a smooth transition from central to
</p>
<p>shell burning. These stars start with such large central densities (&amp;102 g cm�3/ that
the electron gas is at the border of degeneracy, which has several consequences. The
</p>
<p>Schönberg&ndash;Chandrasekhar limit (Sect. 30.5) is not important: initially, the core mass
</p>
<p>Mc is below 0.1M .When, however, with outward burning shell sourceMc &gt; 0:1M ,
</p>
<p>the core contraction has produced sufficient degeneracy,making this limit irrelevant.
</p>
<p>The stars can then well exist in thermal equilibrium with a degenerate, isothermal
</p>
<p>helium core. This means that there is no &ldquo;need&rdquo; for a rapid core contraction
</p>
<p>as described in Sect. 31.1 and no equivalent of the Hertzsprung gap. Another
</p>
<p>consequence of degeneracy is that core contraction is not connected with heating.
</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the pre-main-sequence contraction (Sect. 28.1) and to post-
</p>
<p>main-sequence core contraction, which leads to helium ignition in massive stars.
</p>
<p>At least in the first phases to be discussed here, the growth of the core mass is
</p>
<p>slow (since the productivity of the shell source is low), and the whole core settles at
</p>
<p>the temperature of the surrounding hydrogen-burning shell. This means that the core
</p>
<p>temperature is far from that of the ignition of helium (�108K). In low-mass stars,
helium burning will be seen to start much later owing to secondary effects, after

<p>392 33 Evolution Through Helium Burning: Low-Mass Stars
</p>
<p>the core mass has grown up to a certain limit. Therefore the shell-burning phase
</p>
<p>between the central hydrogen and helium burning is a nuclear, slow phase, and one
</p>
<p>can expect to find many such stars in the sky.
</p>
<p>The contraction of the core is (as in the case of larger M ) accompanied by an
</p>
<p>expansion of the hydrogen-rich envelope outside the shell source. However, as long
</p>
<p>as the luminosity does not change drastically, the expansion cannot carry the star far
</p>
<p>away from its starting point on the main sequence. The reason is that this point is
</p>
<p>already close to the Hayashi line, which cannot be crossed (Chap. 24).
</p>
<p>Any further expansion of the envelope is only possible if the luminosity
</p>
<p>increases. In fact the calculations show that L now increases by more than a factor
</p>
<p>102 whileMc grows.
</p>
<p>Surprisingly enough it turns out that L soon depends on the properties of the
</p>
<p>core only and is practically independent of the mass of the envelope (and therefore
</p>
<p>ofM ). In this phase the models can be well described analytically by a generalized
</p>
<p>form of homology.
</p>
<p>33.2 Shell-Source Homology
</p>
<p>Consider a model in complete equilibrium consisting of a degenerate helium core
</p>
<p>(mass Mc, radius Rc/ surrounded by an extended envelope of hydrogen with
</p>
<p>abundance XH and mass Menv D M � Mc. The core mass Mc grows owing to
hydrogen-shell burning, which provides the luminosity L:
</p>
<p>PMc D
L
</p>
<p>XHEH
(33.1)
</p>
<p>(whereEH is the energy gain per unit mass of hydrogen). This equation could easily
</p>
<p>be integrated if L were constant. However, while evolution proceeds, L grows too
</p>
<p>since there is a relation betweenL andMc. The properties of the shell (and therefore
</p>
<p>L/ are mainly determined byMc and Rc, while they are almost independent of the
</p>
<p>properties of the envelope. This can be understood from the fact that the core is
</p>
<p>highly concentrated and the gravity at its surface is very large. Then, according to
</p>
<p>hydrostatic equilibrium, jdP=dmj � m=r4 is very large, and P drops by powers
of 10 within a thin mass shell just above the core surface. The typical situation is
</p>
<p>illustrated in Fig. 33.1. In other words, the extended envelope above this layer is
</p>
<p>nearly weightless and has no influence on the burning shell.
</p>
<p>We now present an analytic approach of Refsdal and Weigert (1970) giving
</p>
<p>relations between the properties of the core and the physical variables in the
</p>
<p>hydrogen-burning shell. For this purpose we will generalize the homology consid-
</p>
<p>erations of Chap. 20 and use again the power approximations for � and ":

<p>since we only want to apply it to regions outside the core, where the gas is not

</p>
<p>mass stars. In Chap. 35 we shall apply the relations derived here to more massive
</p>
<p>stars and then take radiation pressure into account.
</p>
<p>We now assume for the density, temperature, pressure, and local luminosity in
</p>
<p>the region of the hydrogen-burning shell (i.e. for Rc � r � Rc C 4r) that there
exists a simple dependency onMc and Rc:

<p>of Sect. 20.1, though there the homologous points were defined with respect to the

<p>While there, for example, in (20.9), the physical quantities vary like powers of M
</p>

<p>negligible values. This assumption yields decisive differences from the relations

depends onMc (rather than onM ) and on the mode of energy generation (in striking

<p>increasing mass (see Sect. 19.6, Chap. 37). We therefore can expect from (33.24)

<p>that the temperature in the shell source increases withMc, and according to (33.26),
</p>
<p>the luminosity increases strongly with Mc even with Rc = constant (this increase

<p>Sect. 22.5)
</p>
<p>We now need a relation Rc.Mc/. The classical mass-radius relation for white
</p>
<p>dwarfs (Chap. 37) is, of course, not directly applicable to these cores. Below the
</p>
<p>shell there must be a transition from complete through partial to no degeneracy.
</p>
<p>Compared to the outer layers of white dwarfs, this transition region is very hot (like
</p>
<p>the shell source) and may occupy an appreciable fraction of the core volume (For
</p>
<p>a discussion of this problem, see Refsdal and Weigert 1970.). Nevertheless, as a

</p>
<p>this way Tc can be raised to helium ignition even bymodels in complete equilibrium.
</p>
<p>33.3 Evolution Along the Red Giant Branch
</p>
<p>In the following we describe the evolution of a star of 1:3Mˇ as calculated by
Thomas (1967) in a pioneering paper. The chemical composition of the initial model
</p>
<p>on the ZAMS is XH D 0:9;XHe D 0:099;Z D 0:001, which at that time seemed to
be the appropriate mixture for a star of population II. The essential results, however,
</p>
<p>do not depend too much on the chosen chemical composition, as we will show
</p>
<p>later and in Fig. 33.5. The initial model has L D 1:91Lˇ; Teff D 6; 760K. Nuclear
energy is released in the central region at Tc D 1:48 � 107K. There is a small
convective core containing 4.3% of the total mass, which disappears long before
</p>
<p>the exhaustion of hydrogen in the centre. There is also an outer convective zone,
</p>
<p>which reaches inwards from the photosphere to about r � 0:95R:
The evolutionary track in the HR diagram is shown in Fig. 33.3, while the internal
</p>
<p>evolution is illustrated by Fig. 33.4. In the HR diagram the image point of the model
</p>
<p>first moves upwards and then to the right. At the same time, the model switches from
</p>
<p>central nuclear burning to shell burning, as can be seen in Fig. 33.4. We have already
</p>
<p>learned from the shell-source homology of Sect. 33.2 that the luminosity must grow
</p>
<p>with increasing core mass. The calculated evolution confirms these predictions once
</p>
<p>the core is sufficiently compressed. The track is very close to the Hayashi line,
</p>
<p>leading up along the giant branch to higher luminosities and correspondingly larger
</p>
<p>radii. The neighbourhood of the line of fully convective stars can also be seen from
</p>
<p>the internal structure of the models. Figure 33.4 shows that the outer convective
</p>
<p>zone penetrates deeply inwards until more than 70% of the total mass is convective.
</p>
<p>It then reaches into layers which are already contaminated by products of nuclear
</p>
<p>reactions (see dotted area in Fig. 33.4). The processed material is distributed over
</p>
<p>the whole convective region and therefore also brought to the surface. This type of
</p>
<p>partial mixing, the first dredge-up, we have already encountered for more massive
</p>
<p>stars in Chap. 31.
</p>
<p>The monotonic increase of the luminosity is interrupted when the hydrogen-
</p>
<p>burning shell reaches the layer down to which the outer convective zone has mixed
</p>
<p>at the moment of deepest penetration. At this point the mixing has produced a
</p>
<p>discontinuity in molecular weight between the homogeneous hydrogen-rich outer
</p>
<p>layer and the helium-enriched layers below. When the shell source reaches the</p>

evolution code and a Pop. II composition typical for metal-poor globular clusters. The evolution
</p>
<p>proceeds from the main sequence to the tip of the red giant branch at logL=Lˇ � 3:2, through
the helium flash to the horizontal branch
</p>
<p>the bump. Indeed, in high-quality photometry of clusters, it can be found easily. As
</p>
<p>an example, we refer the reader to the case of NGC 5824 (Zoccali et al. 1999).
</p>
<p>Evolutionary calculations for somewhat different total masses M yield similar
</p>
<p>results. Near the main sequence the tracks are shifted relative to each other according
</p>
<p>to their different starting points on the ZAMS. When approaching the Hayashi line
</p>
<p>the tracks merge (This is not exactly true, since different total masses have slightly
</p>
<p>different Hayashi lines.). After the cores are sufficiently condensed they are virtually
</p>
<p>independent of the envelope (and therefore of the total mass M ). However, they
</p>
<p>determine the total luminosity according to the L.Mc) relation. Consequently stars
</p>
<p>of different M but the same Mc have the same L and are practically at the same
</p>
<p>point in the HR diagram.
</p>
<p>The same convergence of the evolution for different M must occur for all
</p>
<p>properties of the shell source and the core. For example, the central values of density
</p>
<p>and temperature converge to the same evolutionary track in the %c&ndash;Tc plane.
</p>
<p>Numerical calculations show that with growing core mass the temperature in the
</p>
<p>core rises. This is due to two effects which are of approximately the same order.
</p>
<p>The first is the increase of the temperature in the surrounding shell source where
</p>
<p>T � Mc=Rc after (33.24). While this effect already occurs in models of complete
equilibrium, there is an additional effect due to non-stationary terms. With growing
</p>
<p>Mc the core contracts, releasing energy. If this occurs rapidly enough, it heats up the
</p>
<p>transition layer below the shell, and therefore the whole core. An inward-directed
</p>
<p>temperature gradient is built up in the transition region, such that the energy released
</p>
<p>by "g terms is carried away. However, this is not the whole story, since at the same

<p>33.4 The Helium Flash 401
</p>
<p>discussed in Sect. 18.7 (see also Fig. 18.11), becomes important and modifies the
</p>
<p>temperature gradient, as will be seen in Sect. 33.5. The core evolution is enhanced
</p>
<p>by increasing L: the rate PMc is proportional to L, which in turn increases by a
high power of Mc, and the process speeds up more and more. Both these effects,
</p>
<p>controlled by the growth ofMc, finally increase the core temperature to �108K at
which helium is ignited. This happens whenMc � 0:48Mˇ, almost independently
of M , but slightly decreasing with increasing metallicity. The matter in the core
</p>
<p>is highly degenerate, and the nuclear burning is unstable. The resulting thermal
</p>
<p>runaway terminates the slow and quiet evolution along the giant branch.
</p>
<p>33.4 The Helium Flash
</p>
<p>We start with some analytic considerations and assume that helium is ignited in
</p>
<p>the centre, where the electron gas is assumed to be non-relativistic and degenerate.
</p>
<p>In Sect. 25.3.5 we have discussed the secular stability of nuclear burning in a small
</p>
<p>central sphere of massms; &ldquo;luminosity&rdquo; ls D "ms, and gravothermal specific heat c�.
Assuming a homologous reaction of the layers above, a small relative temperature

<p>perturbation #c.D dTc=Tc) was shown in (25.35) to evolve according to

<p>cPmsTc
."T C �T � 4/#c ; (33.34)
</p>
<p>where we have set ı D 0 and therefore c� D cP according to (25.29). For helium
burning we have "T &gt; 19 (see Sect. 18.5.2), which certainly dominates the other
</p>
<p>terms in the parenthesis which thus is positive: the onset of helium burning in the
</p>
<p>degenerate core is unstable and results in a thermal runaway. The timescale of the
</p>
<p>thermal runaway is of the order cPmsTc=ls D cPTc=", i.e. of the order of the thermal
timescale of the helium-burning region.
</p>
<p>The homologous linear approximation which yielded (33.34) can only give a
</p>
<p>very rough picture of the events after helium ignition. Nevertheless we can try to
</p>
<p>discuss the consequences which follow from our simple formalism. From (25.25)
</p>
<p>and (25.26) one obtains

4˛ � 3#c ; (33.35)
</p>
<p>and for the completely degenerate non-relativistic gas, where ˛ D 3=5; ı D 0, we
find d%c D 0. Therefore, while during the thermal runaway the central temperature
is rising, the matter neither expands nor contracts. The central density remains
</p>
<p>constant, and in the lg%c&ndash;lgTc diagram, the centre evolves vertically upwards as
</p>
<p>indicated in Fig. 33.6. The reason is that in the (fully) degenerate gas the pressure
</p>
<p>does not depend on temperature and therefore remains constant during the thermal
</p>
<p>runaway. But only an increase of pressure could lift the weight of the mass above
</p>
<p>and cause an expansion. Since the Pdv work is zero, all nuclear power goes into
</p>
<p>internal energy. During the thermal runaway there is an enormous overproduction of
</p>
<p>nuclear energy. The local luminosity l at maximum comes to 1011Lˇ, about that of</p>

<p>Fig. 33.6 Schematic sketch of the changes of temperature and density during the helium flash.
</p>
<p>After the ignition temperature is reached in the regime of degeneracy the temperature rises almost
</p>
<p>without a change of density until degeneracy is removed near the broken line. Then a phase of
</p>
<p>almost isothermal expansion ensuesfollowed by a phase of stable helium burning in the non-
</p>
<p>degenerate regime
</p>
<p>a whole galaxy, but only for a few seconds (The expression &ldquo;helium flash&rdquo; is quite
</p>
<p>appropriate indeed!). However, almost nothing of it reaches the surface, since it is
</p>
<p>absorbed by expansion of the non-degenerate layers above.
</p>
<p>With increasing temperature at constant density, the degeneracy is finally
</p>
<p>removed. This happens roughly when in Fig. 33.6 the border .˛ D 3=4) between
degeneracy and ideal gas is crossed. Then with further increase of T the core
</p>
<p>expands. With the removal of degeneracy the gravothermal specific heat becomes
</p>
<p>negative again and central helium burning becomes stable; the expansion stops
</p>
<p>the increase of temperature. The overproduction then is gradually removed by
</p>
<p>cooling until the temperature has dropped to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; values for quiet (stable)
</p>
<p>helium burning. In the lg %c&ndash;lgTc plane the core settles near the image point of
</p>
<p>a homogeneous helium star of massMc, which is of the order of 0:48Mˇ.
There is another prediction we can make for the changes in the HR diagram.
</p>
<p>Until the onset of helium burning the total luminosity of the star (which is just the
</p>
<p>power produced in the shell) increases with increasing core mass as expected from
</p>
<p>(33.26). After degeneracy is removed in the central region, the core expands and Rc
increases. During the short phase of the flash, Mc remains practically unchanged.
</p>
<p>From (33.26) we therefore expect the luminosity to be appreciably reduced after the
</p>
<p>flash phase, and this indeed can be seen from Figs. 33.3 and 33.5.

<p>33.5 Numerical Results for the Helium Flash
</p>
<p>In Sect. 33.4 we have tacitly assumed that the maximum temperature is in the centre.
</p>
<p>This, however, is not the case if neutrinos&ndash;as we discussed them in Sect. 18.7&ndash;are

<p>created in the very interior of the core and provide an energy sink there, since they</p>

</p>
<p>with solar metallicity, shortly before the onset of (unstable) helium burning (solid line). Owing
</p>
<p>to neutrino losses the maximum temperature does not occur in the centre but near m=M D 0:1
(indicated by the dot). The dashed line (deviating from the solid one only near the dot) shows
</p>
<p>how the ignition of helium burning has raised the temperature at this position inside the star only
</p>
<p>104 years later
</p>
<p>leave the star without noticeable interaction. Then the maximum of temperature is
</p>
<p>not in the centre but at a finite value of m (see Fig. 33.7). From there, energy flows
</p>
<p>outwards (l &gt; 0) and inwards (l &lt; 0). This energy is released by core contraction in
</p>
<p>the transition zone below the burning shell as mentioned in Sect. 33.3. The transport
</p>
<p>mechanisms are radiation and conduction. The inward-going energy is carried away
</p>
<p>by neutrinos. Then the ignition of helium and the flash will not take place in the
</p>
<p>centre but in the concentric shell of maximum temperature. This is nearm=M D 0:1
according to Fig. 33.7 [Note that in the calculations shown in Fig. 33.4 an unusually
</p>
<p>low value of � in the envelope was assumed. Therefore, according to (33.30) and
</p>
<p>(33.32), T in the shell source and L are smaller for the sameMc andRc, and helium
</p>
<p>ignites at correspondingly largerMc, in this case atm=M � 0:3, cf. Fig. 33.10.].
In Fig. 33.8, the evolution is shown in a lg %&ndash;lg T diagram for the shell in which
</p>
<p>helium is ignited. We see that the shell behaves roughly as predicted in Fig. 33.6
</p>
<p>for the centre. When the temperature of helium burning is reached at point A, the
</p>
<p>core matter heats up. After degeneracy is removed near point B; the core expands
</p>
<p>and a non-degenerate phase follows with stable helium burning, roughly at the same
</p>
<p>temperature at which the flash phase had started but at much lower densities. The
</p>
<p>internal structure of the model after the ignition of helium is indicated in Fig. 33.10.
</p>
<p>The calculations by Thomas (1967) were carried out with neutrino rates which
</p>
<p>turned out to be too high. In calculations for 1:3Mˇ, with more realistic neutrino
rates (and composition), the igniting shell was at m=M D 0:11, similar to the value
in Fig. 33.7, which is based on calculations with the most recent neutrino loss

M D 0:7Mˇ, while with increasing total mass the shell of ignition moves closer to
the centre.
</p>
<p>The changing luminosity provided by the hydrogen shell and helium burning is
</p>
<p>displayed in Fig. 33.9. The timescale in this figure changes several times due to the
</p>
<p>different phases of the flash, which starts very slowly over several 105 years (not
</p>
<p>shown), but accelerates dramatically once logLHe=Lˇ &gt; 3. Within a few years
logLHe=Lˇ &gt; 10, but drops equally fast after the peak. Around this time, when
the layers above the flash location begin to expand, the hydrogen shell basically
</p>
<p>extinguishes due to the drop in temperature, while the total luminosity remains
</p>
<p>almost constant. In the following 105 years the hydrogen shell reignites and L
</p>
<p>drops as predicted in Sect. 33.4. The flash and the resulting convection heat up
</p>
<p>the core such that the lower boundary of helium fusion is moving inwards within
</p>
<p>approximately one million years. In all hydrostatic calculations this progression is
</p>
<p>connected with small, secondary helium flashes, as can be seen in the figure. When
</p>
<p>the star finally settles on the horizontal branch, the core, which is now burning
</p>
<p>helium under non-degenerate conditions, is already enriched in carbon by about 5%.
</p>
<p>Although the properties of the regions in which the flash occurs can change
</p>
<p>drastically within a few seconds, it seems as if inertia terms can be neglected even
</p>
<p>in the most violent phases of the flash. Another open question is, how convection
</p>
<p>behaves during the rapid evolution of the helium flash and whether the ignition of
</p>
<p>helium and the flash in a shell proceeds in strict spherical symmetry. Such question
</p>
<p>can only be answered with 2- and 3-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations.</p>

<p>These, however, need such enormous computational resources that so far only parts

<p>few hours to days. This restricts such simulations to the peak of the helium flash and

<p>apart from some details, confirmed the overall applicability of the 1-dimensional,

<p>faster heating of the core and the absence of the secondary flashes. This is one of
</p>
<p>the several unanswered questions connected with the helium flash. Another one is,
</p>
<p>whether during the flash matter is expelled from the surface.
</p>
<p>If helium is ignited off centre, then the burning forms a shell enriched in carbon

<p>and oxygen which surrounds a helium sphere. But if the molecular weight decreases

</p>
<p>composition left by the (then extinguished) hydrogen-burning shell
</p>
<p>the characteristic time for this mixing process. Simple assumptions about the flow

<p>pattern suggest that mixing due to the inwardly decreasing molecular weight is slow
</p>
<p>compared to the nuclear timescale and can therefore be neglected (Kippenhahn et al.
</p>
<p>1980a,b). The multidimensional hydrodynamical models by Mocak and co-workers
</p>
<p>mentioned above indeed show the occurrence of such fingers, which, however, the
</p>
<p>authors ascribe to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. They could be followed for less than

</p>
<p>More spectacular mixing than in the case just discussed can occur if the
</p>
<p>convective shell, forming above the helium-burning shell during the flash, merges
</p>
<p>with the outer convective layer. Then hydrogen-rich matter will be mixed down to
</p>
<p>regions with high temperatures where simultaneous helium and hydrogen burning

<p>give rise to quite unusual nuclear reactions and chemical compositions. Although

<p>they do not merge usually. This can be seen in the detailed picture on the lower

<p>produce helium, and this leads to a different temperature stratification, which allows
</p>
<p>the penetration of the hydrogen/helium discontinuity by the convective layers above
</p>
<p>the helium ignition shell (Fujimoto et al. 1990). The result of the flash-induced
</p>
<p>mixing are surface abundances drastically enhanced in carbon produced by triple-
</p>
<p>alpha reaction and in nitrogen resulting from proton captures on some of this carbon
</p>
<p>(Schlattl et al. 2001). The second case where this was encountered is Pop. II stars
</p>
<p>with extremely thin hydrogen envelopes (of order 10�4Mˇ), which could be the
result of enhancedmass loss on the red giant branch (RGB). Due to the low envelope
</p>
<p>mass the hydrogen shell is extinguishing and the star leaves the RGB, returning
</p>
<p>first to hotter temperatures and then entering the white dwarf cooling phase. If
</p>
<p>on its way across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram the helium flash sets in (such
</p>
<p>stars are also called &ldquo;hot flashers&rdquo;), convection can penetrate into the envelope to
</p>
<p>engulf protons into the hot helium-burning regions, which leads to a &ldquo;CNO flash&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>As a consequence the surface is enriched both in helium and carbon, and the star
</p>
<p>resembles, both in composition and its location, stars at the very hot end of the
</p>
<p>horizontal branch (see Sect. 33.6). For more details we refer the reader to Cassisi
</p>
<p>et al. (2003).
</p>
<p>33.6 Evolution After the Helium Flash
</p>
<p>After the violent phase of the helium flash there follows a phase of quiet burning
</p>
<p>in non-degenerate matter. The transition to this is not particularly well covered by
</p>
<p>calculations; one of the few exceptions is shown in Figs. 33.5 and 33.9.Most authors
</p>
<p>prefer to start with models that belong to a later state in which the models already
</p>
<p>resemble the horizontal-branch stars of globular clusters. These methods and how
</p>
<p>accurately they reproduce the full calculations carried through the complete flash
</p>
<p>event can be found in Serenelli and Weiss (2005). One should keep in mind, though,
</p>
<p>that the comparison is done with spherical symmetric, hydrostatic models. Once
</p>
<p>multidimensional hydrodynamical models are available for all phases of the helium
</p>
<p>flash, one will see how accurate the hydrostatic models are themselves.
</p>
<p>Although during the flash helium is ignited in a shell, it will also burn in the
</p>
<p>central region after some time, and the stars can be approximated by models on
</p>
<p>generalized main sequences (cf. Sect. 23.3). For example, a 0.9Mˇ star, having
a helium core of 0:45Mˇ after the flash, corresponds to the generalized main
sequence for q0 D 0:5. Then from Fig. 23.5 we expect that the model should lie
in the HR diagram near the Hayashi line at a luminosity of about L � 100Lˇ,
appreciably lower than just before the flash. This is also what we had expected from
</p>
<p>the analytic discussion at the end of Sect. 33.4, and the historical evolutionary track
</p>
<p>in Fig. 33.3 in fact already pointed downwards in the right direction. The modern
</p>
<p>calculation of Fig. 33.5 covers the whole post-flash part. When in the subsequent
</p>
<p>phase q0 increases with growing Mc; the model should cross over to generalized
</p>
<p>main sequences of larger q0, i.e. move to the left with slightly increasing luminosity.
</p>
<p>This also applies when comparing models of the same core, but different total</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>408 33 Evolution Through Helium Burning: Low-Mass Stars
</p>
<p>mass, and therefore different values of q0. Thus, the analytic discussion and the
</p>
<p>generalized main sequences already sketch basic properties of the phase following
</p>
<p>the helium flash, which is identified as the (zero-age) horizontal branch.
</p>
<p>Detailed calculations, first carried out by Faulkner (1966) in order to reproduce
</p>
<p>the horizontal branch of globular clusters, show that the models after the helium
</p>
<p>flash depend not only on q0 but also on the chemical composition. He compared
</p>
<p>models of different mass M in complete equilibrium at the onset of quiet helium
</p>
<p>burning in a core ofMc D 0:5Mˇ with a hydrogen-burning shell at the bottom of
the envelope. ForM &gt; 0:75Mˇ (at about solar metallicity) they were close to the
Hayashi line, but for a smaller mass, they were located considerably to the left. In
</p>
<p>order to cover the whole observed horizontal branch with such models for a fixed
</p>
<p>metallicity, one has to assume that the models differ in mass. In a globular cluster,
</p>
<p>where all stars have the same age and all stars at the tip of the RGB and on the
</p>
<p>zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) had nearly the same initial mass, the horizontal
</p>
<p>extent of the horizontal branch provides stringent evidence for different mass loss
</p>
<p>during the previous phase, either before or during the helium flash. This question
</p>
<p>still awaits a final answer, but the most likely scenario is the following:
</p>
<p>During the slow evolution before the helium flash the stars lose an appreciable,
</p>
<p>but from star to star different, amount of mass from their surfaces. Then the stars
</p>
<p>start their evolution after the flash with the same core masses but different envelope
</p>
<p>masses: those which have lost more mass lie on the left, while those which have lost
</p>
<p>only little mass lie in the red region (Fig. 33.12).
</p>
<p>To some degree, however, the observed horizontal branches reflect the evolution
</p>
<p>of stars after their appearance on the zero-age branch. When their cores grow owing
</p>
<p>to shell hydrogen burning, and the helium is consumed in their central part, their
</p>
<p>evolutionary tracks loop back and forth, populating the horizontal branch. The
</p>
<p>observed branches are not simply the locus of zero-age models. We will come to the
</p>
<p>further evolution in Sect. 33.7. Since the horizontal branch crosses the instability
</p>
<p>strip (see Chap. 41) we can expect pulsating horizontal-branch stars. Indeed there
</p>
<p>one finds the RR Lyrae variables.
</p>
<p>Faulkner&rsquo;s results revealed another important property of zero-age models. If
</p>
<p>one keeps the total mass constant but decreases their metal content, then the
</p>
<p>models move to the left of the HR diagram. This helped to understand an observed
</p>
<p>correlation between horizontal-branch characteristics of different globular clusters
</p>
<p>and their composition: the concentration of stars on the horizontal branch shifts from
</p>
<p>left to right with increasing contents of heavier elements. This is usually called
</p>
<p>the first parameter effect for horizontal-branch morphology. Observations point
</p>
<p>to a second parameter, which so far has not been identified undisputedly. There
</p>
<p>exist pairs of globular clusters of (almost) identical age and the same metallicity,
</p>
<p>but different numbers of stars on the red and blue part of the horizontal branch.
</p>
<p>Examples for such famous &ldquo;twins&rdquo; are M13 and M3, and NGC 362 and NGC 288.
</p>
<p>Among the candidates for the second parameter are age, helium content, and the
</p>
<p>density of stars inside the cluster.
</p>
<p>Detailed, full evolutionary calculations confirm all these dependencies. We show

</p>
<p>from Z D 0:0001 to Z D 0:016. The lower the metallicity, the brighter the stars
on the ZAHB. Along each ZAHB, mass and therefore envelope mass varies. The
</p>
<p>coolest models were obtained from calculations ignoring mass loss, the hottest ones
</p>
<p>have only very thin hydrogen envelopes left. For the two more metal-rich cases
</p>
<p>they were obtained by removing mass from the coolest ZAHB models. This is one
</p>
<p>of the mentioned approximative ways to construct such models. The ZAHB for
</p>
<p>Z D 0:0001was taken from calculations that followed the complete evolution from
the ZAMS through the core helium flash to the horizontal branch. The zero-age
</p>
<p>stage was identified with the model having the smallest thermal energies.
</p>
<p>In this logTeff-logL=Lˇ diagram the horizontal branch appears to be &ldquo;hori-
zontal&rdquo; only in some Teff regions. This is partly because of the narrow range in
</p>
<p>luminosity shown, but its appearance in fact also depends a lot on the photometric
</p>
<p>band it is observed in. However, if extending over the full temperature or colour
</p>
<p>range, it never is completely horizontal.
</p>
<p>The ZAHB for Z D 0:005 in Fig. 33.11 appears as a pair. The slightly brighter
branch corresponds to an age of 15 Gyr, the other one to one of 5 Gyr. This in turn
</p>
<p>reflects the slight dependence of the core mass at the helium flash on initial mass:
</p>
<p>the brighter branch originates from stars below � 1:0Mˇ, the dimmer one from
M � 1:3Mˇ.
</p>
<p>More details about the dependency of the ZAHB luminosity on core mass, helium
</p>
<p>content, and metallicity, including quantitative results from theoretical models, can
</p>
<p>be found in Salaris and Cassisi (2005), Chap. 6.3.
</p>
<p>33.7 Evolution from the Zero-Age Horizontal Branch
</p>
<p>A so-called ZAHB model has a homogeneous non-degenerate helium core of mass
</p>
<p>Mc � 0:45 � 0:50Mˇ, surrounded by a hydrogen-rich envelope of mass Menv D
M � Mc. The total luminosity consists of comparable contributions from (quiet)
central helium burning and from the hydrogen-burning shell.
</p>
<p>A complication occurs during the following evolution of these models. The
</p>
<p>stars have a central convective core which becomes enriched in carbon and oxygen
</p>
<p>during helium burning. The opacity in this temperature-density range is dominated
</p>
<p>by free-free transitions. However, the free-free opacity increases with increasing
</p>
<p>carbon and oxygen abundance as can be seen from the factor B in (17.5) and
</p>
<p>(17.6), which depends on the square of the nuclear charge. As a consequence the
</p>
<p>radiative gradient inside the Schwarzschild boundary grows during core helium
</p>
<p>burning, and a discontinuity in rrad at the edge of the convective core develops. The
situation is similar to that in massive stars on the main sequence (see Sect. 30.4.2)
</p>
<p>where the opacity is governed by electron scattering and decreases with increasing
</p>
<p>helium abundance. In this case the core is therefore shrinking during the main-
</p>
<p>sequence evolution. The radiative layers of increasing hydrogen content above the
</p>
<p>core can locally become convective if some mixing increases the hydrogen content
</p>
<p>(Fig. 30.3).</p>

</p>
<p>A similar semiconvective situation is given outside the convective helium-
</p>
<p>burning core on the horizontal branch. If some mixing, for example, due to
</p>
<p>overshooting, mixes C/O-enriched material outside the formal Schwarzschild bor-
</p>
<p>der, the radiative gradient will increase there and convection sets in. Such cores
</p>
<p>therefore have the tendency to grow, and a jump in rrad at the convective core
boundary cannot develop in the early phase of HB evolution. Detailed models show
</p>
<p>that the radiative gradient then tends to increase and to develop a minimum inside
</p>
<p>the growing convective core, which, due to the continuing mixing of helium-rich
</p>
<p>layers and the combined effect of changing physical quantities, at some point begins
</p>
<p>to become smaller, until it drops to the value of the adiabatic value. This change
</p>
<p>in the radiative gradient with time is sketched in Fig. 33.13 for three consecutive
</p>
<p>times. Further mixing at the core border then would lead to a stabilization of an
</p>
<p>intermediate region, and therefore to the development of a radiative zone inside the
</p>
<p>core. In real stars one expects therefore mixing up to a composition that leads to a
</p>
<p>marginally unstable layer with rrad D rad. This partially mixed layer constitutes
another case of semiconvection, and was discussed first by Castellani et al. (1971).
</p>
<p>The development of this situation is indicated by the line labelled &ldquo;3&rdquo; in Fig. 33.13,
</p>
<p>and the real situation in a stellar model calculated with semiconvection is shown in
</p>
<p>Figs. 33.15 and 33.16.
</p>
<p>If a continuous, slow growth of the convective core is inhibited, a strong
</p>
<p>discontinuity at its edge is developing. As in the case of massive stars, during the
</p>
<p>further evolution, a sudden mixing between the core and the overlying, helium-rich
</p>
<p>layers may occur, which leads to a sudden increase in the core&rsquo;s helium content
</p>
<p>and a loop in the HR diagram. The occurrence of these so-called &ldquo;breathing pulses&rdquo;
</p>
<p>depends a lot on the details of the treatment of convection and of the border of
</p>
<p>the convective core. The most favourable situation for their occurrence is when the
</p>
<p>Schwarzschild criterion for convection is used, but they are probably an artefact
</p>
<p>of the calculations (see the discussion in Salaris and Cassisi 2005). In most of the

</p>
<p>is clearly visible for the Schwarzschild case, as is the similarity between the
</p>
<p>overshooting and semiconvection model in this late phase of the HB evolution.
</p>
<p>The mass of the helium core grows owing to hydrogen-shell burning, while in
</p>
<p>the convective core helium is consumed and carbon and oxygen are produced. After
</p>
<p>some time a pure carbon-oxygen core will be formed in the central region of the
</p>
<p>helium core. Then nuclear burning takes place in two shells (hydrogen and helium
</p>
<p>burning), and in the subsequent phases of evolution, the masses below these shells
</p>
<p>will grow.
</p>
<p>The models evolve from the ZAHB first in the slow phase of central helium
</p>
<p>burning with a hydrogen-burning shell. This phase, which lasts for several 107 to
</p>
<p>up to 108 years, is followed by a phase of rapid evolution during which the models
</p>
<p>go from helium burning in the centre to shell burning. In this phase another kind
</p>
<p>of loops appears, which is clearly visible in Fig. 33.12; these are the so-called
</p>
<p>&ldquo;mini-pulses&rdquo;, which were described early on by Mazzitelli and D&rsquo;Antona (1986).
</p>
<p>The steep chemical profile of models calculated with the Schwarzschild criterion
</p>
<p>(Fig. 33.15) leads to a thinner helium shell; such shells can be thermally unstable.
</p>
<p>We will discuss such shell instabilities in more detail in Chap. 34. After this initial
</p>
<p>shell-burning phase a slow phase of double shell burning occurs.
</p>
<p>The general direction of the evolution is towards higher luminosity and a return
</p>
<p>to the Hayashi line. Depending on the relative energy production of helium core and
</p>
<p>hydrogen shell the models initially show more or less extended excursions towards
</p>
<p>higher Teff (see the model with the lowest mass compared to the coolest one in
</p>
<p>Fig. 33.12).
</p>
<p>The evolutionary tracks lead upwards with increasing core mass, and the
</p>
<p>corresponding branch in the HR diagram is called the asymptotic giant branch
</p>
<p>(AGB). It has to be distinguished from the red giant branch (RGB), along which
</p>
<p>the image points in the HR diagram move upwards before ignition of helium.
</p>
<p>The models of the post-horizontal-branch evolution occupy a region above the
</p>
<p>horizontal branch. During their evolution some of them cross the instability strip
</p>
<p>(see Chap. 41), where one finds the pulsating BL Herculis1 stars (compare the
</p>
<p>sketch in Fig. 33.12). In contrast, the RR Lyrae variables are stars, which are still
</p>
<p>on the horizontal branch, and which are located in the region, where it crosses the
</p>
<p>instability strip.
</p>
<p>1BL Her stars belong to the class of type II Cepheids, which used to be called collectively

<p>W Virginis stars. Nowadays the latter term is used for even brighter stars in the same instability

<p>The more advanced the evolution of stars is, the less it is possible to treat it with
</p>
<p>simple models or even analytic descriptions. Instead, numerical calculations are
</p>
<p>the only way to follow the evolution. Therefore, in the following chapters, we
</p>
<p>will rely almost solely, with a few exceptions, on results from models produced in

<p>the computer. At the same time, the complications from poorly known physics are
</p>
<p>becoming more and more important. This is in particular true for the treatment of
</p>
<p>convection and of mass loss, not to speak of the influence of rotation and additional
</p>
<p>mixing mechanisms. Unfortunately, the late evolution of stars depend a lot on
</p>
<p>exactly these physical effects. The following chapters therefore give an overview of
</p>
<p>our current understanding of stellar evolution after the core helium-burning phase.

<p>Evolution on the Asymptotic Giant Branch
</p>
<p>34.1 Nuclear Shells on the Asymptotic Giant Branch
</p>
<p>In stars of low and intermediate mass, i.e. in stars of initial mass . 8Mˇ, the phase
following the end of core helium burning is of special interest. It is characterized by
</p>
<p>the presence of two nuclear burning shells around a carbon-oxygen core, of which
</p>
<p>one&ndash;the helium shell&ndash;is thermally unstable. Stars in this mass range and phase of
</p>
<p>the evolution populate the so-called asymptotic giant branch (AGB), previously also
</p>
<p>known as &ldquo;second-ascent branch&rdquo;. In this chapter we give an overview over the
</p>
<p>important physical effects which are characteristic for AGB stars. As we will see,
</p>
<p>the evolution is highly complicated and the numerical models far from being perfect.
</p>
<p>For more details and a much more thorough discussion, we refer the reader to the
</p>
<p>review by Herwig (2005) and to the textbook by Habing and Olofsson (2003). The
</p>
<p>classical review by Iben and Renzini (1983) is still worth being studied, too.
</p>
<p>After the end of core helium burning and after the hydrogen shell has burned
</p>
<p>outwards for some time, the temperature in this shell drops, and hydrogen-shell
</p>
<p>burning extinguishes. This phase of the evolution is often called the early AGB
</p>
<p>(E-AGB). The layer of transition between the hydrogen-rich envelope and the region
</p>
<p>of helium stays now at a fixed value of m: In stars above M � 4Mˇ convection
may reach below the H&ndash;He discontinuity and mix more ashes of hydrogen shell
</p>
<p>burning to the surface. This is the second dredge-up we already encountered in
</p>
<p>Chap. 31. But there is still the active helium-burning shell moving to higher values
</p>
<p>of m and therefore approaching the bottom of the hydrogen-rich envelope. Since
</p>
<p>helium burning proceeds at a temperature of &amp;108K, which is about ten times the
</p>
<p>temperature of hydrogen ignition, hydrogen burning starts again, and once more
</p>
<p>there are two shell sources. In this phase, shell burning becomes secularly unstable,
</p>
<p>resulting in a thermal runaway. This leads to a cyclic phenomenon (reoccurring
</p>
<p>here within some 104&ndash;105 years) known as thermal pulses (TP). Their general
</p>
<p>properties will be discussed in Sect. 34.3 in connection with their appearance in
</p>
<p>intermediate-mass stars where the unstable shells initially are in the deep interior,
</p>
<p>and the response of the surface is moderate. In the case of low-mass stars, the

<p>(AGB) until thermal pulses occur (indicated by full circles). The changes during a pulse are shown
</p>
<p>only for pulse 9 and pulse 10. Before the last pulse (11), for which only the onset is shown, the

<p>branch (HB), and a line of constant radius in the white-dwarf region are indicated (after Iben and
</p>
<p>Renzini 1983)
</p>
<p>luminosity and the surface temperature can vary appreciably with each pulse. This
</p>
<p>is the more pronounced the less mass is left above the unstable shells, as we will
</p>
<p>see in Sect. 34.7. If a thermal pulse occurs in certain critical phases (with neither
</p>
<p>too much nor too little mass above the shells) the models can even move rapidly
</p>
<p>through large regions of the HR diagram (Kippenhahn et al. 1968; Schönberner
</p>
<p>1979). The evolution displayed in Fig. 34.1, shown as an illustrative example and
</p>
<p>taken from the review article &ldquo;Asymptotic Giant Branch Evolution and Beyond&rdquo; by
</p>
<p>Iben and Renzini (1983) goes through 11 pulses, the onsets of which are indicated by
</p>
<p>heavy dots. The variation of the surface values is not very pronounced, since there is
</p>
<p>enough mass above the nuclear shells to damp the changes caused by the instability.
</p>
<p>This phase is also called the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) to discriminate it
</p>
<p>from the E-AGB.
</p>
<p>The pulses are more or less an envelope phenomenon and are of no influence on
</p>
<p>the core. The inner part of the CO-core resembles more and more a white dwarf.
</p>
<p>Only the hydrogen-rich envelope, small in mass but thick in radius, at first gives the
</p>
<p>star the appearance of a red giant. After the envelope mass has dropped below, say,
</p>
<p>one per cent, the envelope starts to shrink. With decreasing envelope mass the star
</p>
<p>moves typically within a few thousand to 104 years to the left of the main sequence
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 34.1). This is the post-AGB phase. Then shell burning extinguishes and the
</p>
<p>star becomes a white dwarf. In the case shown, the star experiences a final thermal
</p>
<p>pulse (11), which will lead to large excursion in the HRD. This will be discussed
</p>
<p>further in Sect. 34.9.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>34.2 Shell Sources and Their Stability 419
</p>
<p>It is clear that the mass in the envelope is diminished by two effects: the hydrogen
</p>
<p>burning at the bottom and mass loss from the surface. Therefore the stage at which
</p>
<p>the star leaves the asymptotic branch, turning to the left, is sensitive also to the
</p>
<p>amount of mass loss in the red giant phase. This influences the mass of the final
</p>
<p>white dwarf (cf. Sect. 35.2) and limits the number of thermal pulses (see Sect. 34.6).
</p>
<p>34.2 Shell Sources and Their Stability
</p>
<p>Stars on the AGB are the first to have more than one nuclear shell. Their productivity
</p>
<p>may change considerably and even go to zero for some time. Neighbouring shell
</p>
<p>sources can influence each other, since each type of burning requires a separate
</p>
<p>range of temperature. For example, if a helium shell source operating at roughly
</p>
<p>2 � 108K approaches a hydrogen-rich layer, we can expect an enormous increase
of hydrogen burning, which usually proceeds at T . 3 � 107K. It is also clear that
different shell sources will generally move with different &ldquo;velocities&rdquo; Pmi through
the mass, unless their contributionsLi to the total luminosity are in certain ratios. If
</p>
<p>Xi denotes the mass concentration of the reacting element ahead of the shell source,
</p>
<p>and qi the energy released by the fusion of one unit of mass, then Pmi D Li=.qiXi /.
For example, on the AGB, the relative motion of the hydrogen and helium shell
</p>
<p>sources through the mass is given by the ratio
</p>
<p>PmH
PmHe
</p>
<p>D LH
LHe
</p>
<p>qHe
</p>
<p>qH
</p>
<p>XHe
</p>
<p>XH
: (34.1)
</p>
<p>This gives a stationary situation with roughly equal velocities only if LH � 7LHe,
since typically XH � 0:7;XHe � 1; and qH=qHe � 10. Otherwise the two shell
sources approach each other or the inner one falls behind.
</p>
<p>Shell-source models for several evolutionary phases can be approximated well
</p>
<p>by solutions obtained by assuming complete equilibrium. While burning outwards,
</p>
<p>a shell source has the tendency to concentrate the reactions over steadily decreasing
</p>
<p>mass ranges. One then has to deal with rather short local nuclear time scales, defined
</p>
<p>as those time intervals in which the burning shifts the very steep chemical profile
</p>
<p>over a range comparable to its own extension. This would require computations of
</p>
<p>tens of thousands models with very short time steps, if it were not for the influence
</p>
<p>of mass loss (see Sect. 34.6).
</p>
<p>All changes become much more rapid, and the assumption of complete equi-
</p>
<p>librium certainly has to be dropped if the shell source is thermally unstable. The
</p>
<p>reasons for such instabilities will be made plausible by considering a very simple
</p>
<p>model for the shell source and its perturbation. The procedure is completely anal-
</p>
<p>ogous to that used in Sect. 25.3.5 for the stability of a central nuclear burning. The
</p>
<p>only difference between the two cases is that the burning regions are geometrically
</p>
<p>different and the density reacts differently to an expansion.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>34.2 Shell Sources and Their Stability 421
</p>
<p>c� is positive and the shell source is secularly unstable. This instability of a shell
source is called pulse instability for reasons which will become obvious very soon.
</p>
<p>It is amazing that such a simple geometrical property can cause a thermal
</p>
<p>instability, though it becomes more plausible if we consider the change of the
</p>
<p>pressure in the shell source as a hydrostatic reaction to the lifting of the layers above
</p>
<p>(for which we simply assume homology). Suppose that the shell tries to get rid of the
</p>
<p>perturbation energy by expansion. A substantial relative increase of the thickness

<p>dD=D&gt;0 gives the same absolute value for the relative decrease of the density
</p>
<p>d%=% &lt; 0, but only a very small relative increase dr=r; if D=r � 1 [cf. (34.3) and
Fig. 34.2b]. This means that the layers above are scarcely lifted, so that their weight
</p>
<p>remains about constant and hydrostatic equilibrium requires dP=P � 0. In fact with

<p>Therefore the expansion of a thin shell source does not stabilize it, but rather

</p>
<p>just as if the equation of state were % � 1=T , which, of course, gives instability
[cf. (34.4) with ˛ D 0 and ı D 1].
</p>
<p>While the foregoing discussion provides the main points correctly, it can easily
</p>
<p>be completed by also considering the perturbation of the local luminosity. Then
</p>
<p>some of the surplus energy can flow away, and instability requires, in addition, that
</p>
<p>the temperature sensitivity of the burning exceeds a certain limit, which is usually
</p>
<p>fulfilled. The eigenvalue analysis of such stellar models has shown that they are
</p>
<p>indeed thermally unstable and that the unstable modes are complex (Härm and
</p>
<p>Schwarzschild 1972).
</p>
<p>The pulse instability was first found (Schwarzschild and Härm 1965) for a
</p>
<p>helium shell source in calculations for a 1Mˇ star. The same type of instability
was encountered independently in a model for 5Mˇ during the two-shell phase, and
here it turned out that the instability leads to nearly periodic relaxation oscillations,
</p>
<p>which were called thermal pulses, as described below (Weigert 1966). They are now
</p>
<p>known to be a genuine property of those low- and intermediate-mass stars, which
</p>
<p>are massive enough to ignite helium and evolve into the double-shell burning phase
</p>
<p>of the AGB.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>422 34 Evolution on the Asymptotic Giant Branch
</p>
<p>A unified scheme for the stability of shell sources has been developed by Yoon
</p>
<p>et al. (2004). It includes the present case of geometrically thin shells as well as the
</p>
<p>flash instability of Sect. 33.4 and demonstrates that shells are more stable, if they
</p>
<p>are geometrically thick, non-degenerate, or hotter.
</p>
<p>34.3 Thermal Pulses of a Shell Source
</p>
<p>Thermal pulses occur in models containing one or more shell sources, and in stars of
</p>
<p>different masses and compositions.We start by describing their properties according
</p>
<p>to the calculation of the first six pulses in a 5Mˇ model, found for the first time
in a star in this mass range by Weigert (1966). Although the physical details and
</p>
<p>numerical treatment of the models have changed a lot since then, the basic picture
</p>
<p>of thermal pulses is still the same. The instability occurs in the helium shell source
</p>
<p>after it has reached m=M � 0:1597. It then contributes only a little to the surface
luminosity L; which is almost completely supplied by the nearby hydrogen shell
</p>
<p>source located at m=M � 0:1603:
The instability results immediately in a thermal runaway: the shell source reacts
</p>
<p>to the surplus energy with an increase in T; which enhances the release of nuclear
</p>
<p>energy, etc. The increase of T is connected with an expansion according to (34.7).
</p>
<p>This can be seen from Fig. 34.3a, b which give T and % at maximum "He in the
</p>
<p>unstable shell source as functions of time (Note that the thermal runaway in a flash
</p>
<p>instability would proceed with % D constant.). Since helium burning has an extreme
temperature sensitivity, the increase of T strongly enhances the productivityLHe of
</p>
<p>the shell source, in later pulses even to many times the surface value L: But most of
</p>
<p>this energy is used up by expansion of the layers above, and this expansion reduces
</p>
<p>considerably the temperature in the hydrogen shell source, such that LH decreases
</p>
<p>significantly. After starting rather slowly the thermal runaway accelerates more and
</p>
<p>more until reaching a sharp peak within a few years. The helium shell source is now
</p>
<p>widely expanded and is therefore no longer unstable. The whole region then starts to
</p>
<p>contract again, which heats up the hydrogen shell source so that it regains its large
</p>
<p>productivity. Within a time of a few 103 years the whole region has asymptotically
</p>
<p>recovered its original overall structure, the helium shell source becomes unstable
</p>
<p>again and the next pulse starts. Figure 34.3 shows that the amplitude of the pulses
</p>
<p>and the time between consecutive pulses grows (in these calculations from 3,200
</p>
<p>to 4,300 years). The reason for these changes is that the chemical composition
</p>
<p>around the shells changes considerably from pulse to pulse. Later calculations (for
</p>
<p>an early review, see Iben and Renzini 1983; for more recent results Wagenhuber
</p>
<p>1996) showed that a nearly periodic behaviour is usually reached after roughly 20
</p>
<p>pulses. The amplitude of a pulse has then become so large that during the maximum
</p>
<p>LHe exceeds L by orders of magnitude. The changes of the chemical composition
</p>
<p>still provide a small deviation from periodicity. Otherwise we would expect strictly
</p>
<p>periodic relaxation oscillations, i.e. the solution would have reached a limit cycle.</p>

<p>34.3 Thermal Pulses of a Shell Source 423
</p>
<p>Fig. 34.3 Thermal pulses of
</p>
<p>the helium shell source in a
</p>
<p>5Mˇ star after central helium
</p>
<p>burning. For the first six
</p>
<p>pulses, some characteristic
</p>
<p>functions are plotted against
</p>
<p>time from the onset of the
</p>
<p>first pulse. T is in K, % in
</p>
<p>g cm�3 (After Weigert 1966)
</p>
<p>The surface luminosity (Fig. 34.3d) drops in each pulse by typically � lgL �
0:1 : : : 0:2 for models with rather massive outer envelopes. The visible reaction of
</p>
<p>the surface is much more pronounced if the pulses occur in a shell source close
</p>
<p>to the surface. Such models can move quite spectacularly through the HR diagram
</p>
<p>(compare with Sect. 34.9).
</p>
<p>The properties of the thermal pulses depend on the type of star in which they
</p>
<p>occur. The cycle time �p (between the peaks of two consecutive pulses) becomes
</p>
<p>smaller with increasing mass Mc of the degenerate CO-core inside the helium
</p>
<p>shell source. From a large sequence of calculations Paczyński (1975) derived the
</p>
<p>following rough relation:
</p>
<p>lg
</p>
<p>�

</p>

<p>Mˇ
</p>
<p>�
: (34.8)
</p>
<p>ForMc � 0:5Mˇ the cycle time is of the order of 105 years, while near the limit
mass Mc � 1:4Mˇ it would be of the order of 10 years only. We now consider
the number of pulses that can occur untilMc has reached 1.4Mˇ. Suppose that the
hydrogen shell source moves outwards by �m per cycle time and produces most
</p>
<p>of the energy L�p . Although L � Mc (cf. Sect. 34.4), �m decreases strongly with
growingMc owing to the decrease of �p. One can estimate that, depending on the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>424 34 Evolution on the Asymptotic Giant Branch
</p>
<p>details of the model, the total number of pulses (determined mainly by the very
</p>
<p>small �p in the last phases) must be 8; 000 : : : 10; 000 before Mc � 1:4Mˇ. Of
course, the shell source cannot burn further than to within a few 10�3M from the
surface. Therefore the total number of pulses will be much smaller if the stellar mass
</p>
<p>is well below 1.4Mˇ, either originally or owing to mass loss. In low-mass stars one
can expect only ten pulses or so, as seen, for instance, in Fig. 34.1. These, however,
</p>
<p>occur very close to the surface and can affect the observable values certainly much
</p>
<p>more than pulses of a shell source in the deep interior.
</p>
<p>During a thermal pulse, the star changes quite rapidly, particularly in the layers
</p>
<p>of the shell sources. Consequently the calculations have to use short time steps
</p>
<p>(often of the order of 1 year), and the number of models to be computed per
</p>
<p>pulse is large (or order 103/. Additionally the fact that the helium shell is thermally
</p>
<p>unstable implies that the models have to be calculated with high precision to prevent
</p>
<p>unwanted thermal runaways. This makes the calculations even more challenging,
</p>
<p>and in fact, AGB calculations still suffer from numerical problems. It is therefore
</p>
<p>clear that one cannot hope to compute straightforwardly through the whole phase
</p>
<p>of about 104 pulses in intermediate-mass stars. In reality this is&ndash;fortunately&ndash;never
</p>
<p>needed, as mass loss on the AGB reduces the envelopemass quickly enough to limit
</p>
<p>the number of TPs to a few tens.
</p>
<p>For stars of small mass (originally or by mass loss) the situation is better. One
</p>
<p>can certainly calculate through all of the relatively few pulses that occur before such
</p>
<p>a star becomes a white dwarf.
</p>
<p>34.4 The Core-Mass-Luminosity Relation for Large
</p>
<p>Core Masses
</p>
<p>Since the direct computation of TP-AGB models is so difficult, one may try to
</p>
<p>suppress the pulses artificially by neglecting the time-dependent terms ."g/ in
</p>
<p>the energy equation and computing models in complete equilibrium. This gives
</p>
<p>(hopefully) an average evolution which might suffice in order to describe the
</p>
<p>evolution of the central core, and therefore of the final fate of the star.
</p>
<p>An alternative approach are the so-called synthetic AGB models (see, e.g.,
</p>
<p>Renzini 1981, or Marigo et al. 1996), where the global properties of AGB stars
</p>
<p>are followed using fitting functions such as (34.8) for the pulse durations. Extensive
</p>
<p>analytical fitting functions were derived by Wagenhuber and Groenewegen (1998)
</p>
<p>for quantities such as the luminosity, the pulse duration and interpulse time, the core
</p>
<p>mass at the first pulse, and many more. These functions were derived by fitting them
</p>
<p>to numerical models and are valid for various masses and chemical compositions,
</p>
<p>but simpler versions can be derived analytically. This is particularly true for the
</p>
<p>important core-mass-luminosity relation on the AGB.
</p>
<p>We have seen that medium-mass stars, after central helium burning, develop a
</p>
<p>degenerate CO-core which is separated from the hydrogen-rich envelope by a thin</p>

</p>
<p>helium layer. At its bottom there is helium-shell burning, which contributes only,
</p>
<p>say, 10% to L: Most of the luminosity is produced in a hydrogen shell source at
</p>
<p>the bottom of the envelope. It is not too bad an approximation if we simply assume
</p>
<p>L � LH, the hydrogen luminosity generated above a condensed core of mass Mc
and radius Rc. We also have seen that L increases with increasing Mc (giving the
</p>
<p>upwardsmotion along the asymptotic branch) and here face the same situation as for
</p>
<p>low-mass stars on the ascending giant branch. One can again derive the dependence
</p>
<p>of the properties of the shell onMc and Rc by homology relations as in Sect. 33.2,
</p>
<p>assuming the simple power laws (33.2) for � and ". But since we are dealing with
</p>
<p>rather massive cores and high temperatures here, the radiation pressure cannot be
</p>
<p>neglected. We therefore have to replace (33.3) by

Therefore we have as equation of state

<p>As in (33.4)&ndash;(33.7), we write the quantities %; T; P; and l in the shell as powers of

</p>
<p>can be seen to reach down nearly to the hydrogen shell source. The lower boundary
</p>
<p>of the OCZmoves during each pulse at first somewhat outwards, and then back again
</p>
<p>(compare also with Fig. 34.5, where the t axis is more compressed). Depending on
</p>
<p>mass, composition, and in particular on the assumption of mixing by convection
</p>
<p>or rotation, the ISCZ may even reach beyond the H&ndash;He discontinuity and dredge
</p>
<p>hydrogen into the intershell region but also enrich the outer layers with carbon.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the lower border of the OCZ can descend beyond the former location of
</p>
<p>the H&ndash;He discontinuity into the intershell region. Also in this case, hydrogen-rich
</p>
<p>material is transported downwards, while intershell material is dredged up by the

<p>OCZ and distributed over the whole outer envelope. This event is called the third
</p>
<p>dredge-up, and its reality is witnessed by the existence of carbon stars, stars on the
</p>
<p>AGB, in which the ratio of carbon-to-oxygenabundance is C/O&gt; 1. In models with

<p>formation of a so-called 13C-pocket. In some models this additional mixing is added
</p>
<p>ad hoc with an efficiency tuned to reproduce the observations. The third dredge-up
</p>
<p>is one of the major problems of stellar evolution theory.
</p>
<p>The mixing between layers containing protons and those burning helium at high
</p>
<p>temperatures is the beginning of interesting nucleosynthesis in stars on the AGB.
</p>
<p>Helium burning transforms 4He into 12C and 16O, and the hydrogen shell source
</p>
<p>converts 16O and 12C into 14N, which is left behind when the shell burns outwards
</p>
<p>between two pulses (between, e.g. t3 and t5 in Fig. 34.6). The ISCZ of the next
</p>
<p>pulse sweeps these 14N nuclei down into the helium shell source where they are
</p>
<p>burned in the chain 14N .˛; &#13; ) 18F .ˇC�/18O .˛; &#13;/22Ne. During a pulse in fairly
massive stars, and therefore within the pulse-driven convective zone, the helium
</p>
<p>shell source attains a temperature so high that 22Ne is also burned in the reaction
22Ne (˛; n/25Mg. This can provide a neutron source sufficiently strong to build up
</p>
<p>elements beyond the iron peak in the s-process (i.e. with neutron captures being
</p>
<p>slow compared with beta decay; see Sect. 18.7; Iben 1975; Truran and Iben 1977).
</p>
<p>In other cases a corresponding neutron source may be provided by 13C nuclei,
</p>
<p>which are burned via the chain 12C .p; &#13;/ 13N .ˇC�/ 13C .˛; n/ 16O in the helium
shell. This happens, in contrast to the neon neutron source, between pulses and
</p>
<p>in a radiative environment (beginning at t3 and t6 in Fig. 34.6). For this neutron
</p>
<p>source to operate it is necessary to bring a sufficient amount of 13C into the helium
</p>
<p>shell, which is achieved by mixing hydrogen-rich material from the envelope into
</p>
<p>the 12C-rich region during the pulse phase in which the hydrogen-burning shell is
</p>
<p>extinguished (Fig. 34.6; t2 � t3). The protons are then captured by the 12C nuclei to
form 13C. The region of high 13C abundance is known as the 13C-pocket, and will
</p>
<p>provide the neutron source later in the pulse cycle. According to theoretical models</p>

<p>34.5 Nucleosynthesis on the AGB 429
</p>
<p>Fig. 34.6 Schematic sketch of the mixing episodes during thermal pulses, following similar
</p>
<p>representations in the reviews by Busso et al. (1999; Fig. 5) and Herwig (2005; Fig. 3). In contrast
</p>
<p>to Fig. 34.5, dredge-up is occurring here due to suitable assumptions about mixing processes, for
</p>
<p>example, due to the inclusion of overshooting. Shown is the region between the two shell sources
</p>
<p>and the bottom of the outer convection zone (OCZ). The mass scale is of order a few hundredths
</p>
<p>of a solar mass. At time t1 the thermal pulse of the He-shell starts and triggers the intershell
</p>
<p>convection zone (ISCZ), which grows in mass and may reach the H-shell location at time t2. The
</p>
<p>H-shell, however, has extinguished at this time due to the radial expansion of the intershell. After
</p>
<p>the pulse terminates, the OCZ can extend deeper than before (at t3) and mixes both protons into
</p>
<p>the intershell as well as carbon, produced in the He-shell and transported upwards by the ISCZ,
</p>
<p>into the envelope. Upon contraction of the intershell, the OCZ recedes, the H-shell reignites, and
</p>
<p>the proton-enriched intershell layers heat to sufficiently high temperatures to allow 12C.p; &#13;/13C
</p>
<p>reactions in a radiative environment, forming the 13C-pocket, which marks the start of s-process
</p>
<p>nucleosynthesis (see text; &ldquo;s&rdquo; in the figure). At t4 the next pulse cycle starts, eventually leading to
</p>
<p>dredge-up of s-process elements and carbon to the surface of the AGB star. The interpulse time
</p>
<p>t4 � t1 is of order 104 years, the timescale t3 � t1 (or t6 � t4) is a few hundred years
</p>
<p>this is the preferred neutron source in most AGB stars. Only in stars of higher mass
</p>
<p>the neon source may act as well. The main source for s-process elements appear to
</p>
<p>be AGB stars of lower mass. This is in agreement with theoretical models, which
</p>
<p>predict the third dredge-up to happen more easily in the lower mass range of AGB
</p>
<p>stars.
</p>
<p>Such mixing and nuclear burning episodes may lead to modifications of the
</p>
<p>surface composition of AGB stars. We already mentioned that they may become
</p>
<p>enriched in carbon, initially produced in the helium shell, but subsequentlymixed by
</p>
<p>the ISCZ and the OCZ to the surface. If a neutron source is operating and s-process
</p>
<p>elements are created, they, too, may appear at the photosphere. The detection of
99Tc in the atmosphere of Mira variables (pulsating AGB stars) by Merrill (1952)
</p>
<p>proved the in situ production of this rare-earth element, as this isotope is unstable
</p>
<p>with a half-life time of only 211,000 years. Another signature of mixing between
</p>
<p>the convective envelope and nuclear burning regions is the presence of 19F in
</p>
<p>AGB stars. It is created by the reaction 15N.˛; &#13;/19F, which is taking place in
</p>
<p>the helium shell. The necessary production of 15N can happen through different
</p>
<p>paths, one of them being 18O.p; ˛/15N (see the neon neutron source, p. 428). Other</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>430 34 Evolution on the Asymptotic Giant Branch
</p>
<p>possibilities include the production of protons through .n; p/-exchange reactions,
</p>
<p>which therefore connects 19F with the occurrence of the s-process and the presence
</p>
<p>of a neutron source.
</p>
<p>Another modification of the surface composition, particularly of the ratio of 12C
</p>
<p>to 14N, can occur if the lower boundary of the OCZ becomes hot enough to start
</p>
<p>reactions of the CNO cycle. This event is known as hot bottom burning (HBB), and
</p>
<p>occurs primarily in more massive AGB stars. It may even convert a carbon star back
</p>
<p>into an oxygen star (C/O &lt; 1). The details of all these processes and their results
</p>
<p>are still rather uncertain, since they depend critically on the precise extensions of the
</p>
<p>two convective zones involved (the OCZ and the ISCZ) and on any other potential
</p>
<p>mixing process that may occur.
</p>
<p>Nucleosynthesis on the AGB is very complex and depends on the details of
</p>
<p>mixing episodes and temperatures encountered. Due to the simultaneous presence
</p>
<p>of protons, ˛-particles, and possibly neutrons at temperatures of several 107K up to
</p>
<p>�2 � 108K, elements from C to Al are both produced and destroyed by proton and
˛ captures. The primary production site is the helium shell, which creates C and O.
</p>
<p>If these elements encounter protons, 14N will be the result. AGB stars can therefore
</p>
<p>be the source of primary nitrogen (Primary elements are produced directly from the
</p>
<p>basic building blocks, hydrogen and helium. Secondary elements, in contrast, are
</p>
<p>the result of nucleosynthesis of pre-existing heavier elements. An example would be
</p>
<p>the nitrogen resulting from CNO processes on the main sequence.). If 14N is further
</p>
<p>exposed to ˛-particles in the helium shell, 18O and then 22Ne will result. In the
</p>
<p>more massive AGB stars, temperatures can be high enough for further ˛-captures,
</p>
<p>resulting in various Mg isotopes. Proton captures on Ne, Na, and Mg may change
</p>
<p>the isotope ratios and eventually lead to Al, including 26Al, which has a half-life
</p>
<p>time of almost a million years. It decays under emission of 1.81 MeV &#13; -photons,
</p>
<p>contributing partially to the galactic &#13; -rays. Isotope ratios may further be modified
</p>
<p>by neutron capture reactions. 14N, for example, acts as a so-called neutron poison,
</p>
<p>as it very effectively captures neutrons, thereby reducing the neutron flux needed for
</p>
<p>the s-process.
</p>
<p>The detailed analysis of the abundances of these and the s-process elements
</p>
<p>is a very important way to learn about the internal evolution of AGB stars. An
</p>
<p>extensive discussion of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars can be found in the review by
</p>
<p>Lattanzio and Wood (in Habing and Olofsson 2003, p. 24). Chemical yields from
</p>
<p>AGB stars have been published by Karakas (2010), and Busso et al. (1999) reviewed
</p>
<p>in particular the s-process in AGB stars.
</p>
<p>34.6 Mass Loss on the AGB
</p>
<p>There is plenty of observational evidence that AGB stars suffer significant mass loss
</p>
<p>through stellar winds such that mass loss is, next to the thermal pulses, the second
</p>
<p>major factor determining the evolution on the AGB. Direct evidence comes from
</p>
<p>observations of circumstellar envelopes which enshroud luminous AGB stars, and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>34.6 Mass Loss on the AGB 431
</p>
<p>may make them visible only in the infrared. The analysis of winds and circumstellar
</p>
<p>shells shows that mass loss rates range from 10�8Mˇ=year to 10�5Mˇ=year
and are strongly correlated with increasing luminosity and decreasing effective
</p>
<p>temperature. The highest rates effectively terminate the AGB evolution by removing
</p>
<p>the envelope within several thousands of years to a level, where the star leaves
</p>
<p>the giant region (as in Fig. 34.1). In this phase, the stellar wind is often called
</p>
<p>a superwind, a term coined by Renzini in 1981, to indicate that it is orders of
</p>
<p>magnitudes higher than the standard Reimers wind (9.1). We will not go into the
</p>
<p>details of the observations and the physics of AGB winds, but give, as an illustrative
</p>
<p>example, a fit formula by van Loon et al. (2005) that describes the mass loss rate
</p>
<p>(inMˇ/year) for oxygen stars (C/O &lt; 1) as a function of the star&rsquo;s position in the
HRD, and demonstrates the high sensitivity to effective temperature:

</p>
<p>Generally, it is believed that the winds of AGB stars are due to the coupling of
</p>
<p>the radiation field to dust forming in the outer atmospheres. The formation of
</p>
<p>dust is favoured by very low temperatures, which are achieved during and due
</p>
<p>to large-amplitude stellar pulsations (see Chap. 40). Indeed, many AGB stars are
</p>
<p>known to be pulsating stars of type Mira or semi-regular and long-period pulsators
</p>
<p>(periods are between 100 and 1,000 days). In addition, temperature variations
</p>
<p>during TPs also modulate the mass loss. The complex interplay between pulsating
</p>
<p>envelopes, the chemistry of dust formation, and the interaction with radiation poses
</p>
<p>an extremely difficult chemistry-radiation-hydrodynamics problem. So far, such
</p>
<p>models have been successful for carbon-rich atmospheres, and theoretical dust-
</p>
<p>driven wind models and mass loss rates are available for carbon stars. Again, as
</p>
<p>an example that is sufficient to make order-of-magnitude estimates for the mass loss
</p>
<p>rate, we give the fitting formula to theoretical carbon-dust models by Wachter et al.

</p>
<p>Such fitting formulae may be accurate within one or two orders of magnitude.
</p>
<p>Within this accuracy, the similarity of the dependencies on L and Teff in (34.17)
</p>
<p>and (34.18) is interesting. More about AGB mass loss can be found in the textbook
</p>
<p>by Habing and Olofsson (2003).
</p>
<p>A more indirect but very convincing fact that demonstrates the importance of
</p>
<p>mass loss from AGB stars comes from the initial-final-mass relation, pioneered by
</p>
<p>Weidemann (1977; revised 2000). We describe briefly the general idea: spectrosopy
</p>
<p>of white dwarfs allows to determine surface gravity gDGM=R and Teff. The</p>

</p>
<p>et al. (2009). The dashed line is the empirical relation derived by Weidemann (2000). The solid
</p>
<p>line is the relation predicted from theoretical AGB evolution models for Z D 0:02 (After Weiss
and Ferguson 2009)
</p>
<p>former quantity, which can in principle also be determined from gravitational photon
</p>
<p>redshift, together with known mass-radius relations (Chap. 37) yields the white
</p>
<p>dwarf&rsquo;s mass. Theoretical cooling curves for the so determined mass, together with
</p>
<p>Teff, give the cooling age, tcool. If the white dwarfs are in a stellar cluster, the age t
</p>
<p>of this cluster can be determined from comparison with isochrones of appropriate
</p>
<p>composition. Since the white dwarfs are the descendants of former main-sequence
</p>
<p>stars in the cluster, the difference t � tcool is the age the progenitor spent in the pre-
white dwarf stages. This time is dominated by the main-sequence lifetime, which is
</p>
<p>depending on the initial mass, as we have estimated in (30.2) and plotted in Fig. 30.6.
</p>
<p>In this way, the initial mass can be determined. Since the more massive AGB stars
</p>
<p>and their mass loss are more interesting, open clusters of several 100Myrs are
</p>
<p>mainly investigated. However, also binary systems, in which one component is a
</p>
<p>white dwarf, are suitable. A famous example is Sirius B; popular clusters are the
</p>
<p>Hyades, the Pleiades, and Praesepe.
</p>
<p>Figure 34.7 shows the empirical initial-final-mass relation (Salaris et al. 2009;
</p>
<p>data points), the previous analytical fit by Weidemann (2000), and the prediction
</p>
<p>from theoretical AGB evolution (Weiss and Ferguson 2009), which included
</p>
<p>overshooting and mass loss according to (34.17) and (34.18). Within the errors the
</p>
<p>theoretical models lie well within the empirical data. This is an indication that the
</p>
<p>total mass loss is described well by the models. Notice that a 6Mˇ star ends as
a white dwarf of only 1Mˇ. It has lost a total of 5Mˇ, and this happens mostly
on the TP-AGB. The second remarkable result is that even for the highest masses
</p>
<p>(� 8Mˇ) the final white-dwarf mass is well below the critical Chandrasekhar mass</p>

</p>
<p>of� 1:4Mˇ. This will turn out to be an important fact in relation to the progenitors
of supernovae (Chap. 36).
</p>
<p>34.7 A Sample AGB Evolution
</p>
<p>In this section, we will present the complete evolution of a star of 2Mˇ and a stan-
dard composition (X D 0:695, Y D 0:285, ZD 0:02) from the main-sequence until
the final white-dwarf state. The calculations for this and many other values for mass
</p>
<p>and composition were done by A. Kitisikis (PhD thesis, Munich University, 2008)
</p>
<p>and published byWeiss and Ferguson (2009). They are the first attempt to include as
</p>
<p>many crucial physical aspects of AGB evolution as possible. Overshooting is treated
</p>
<p>according to (30.9), and applied at all convective boundaries. The opacity tables
</p>
<p>used include variations of C and O abundance and therefore are sensitive to dredge-
</p>
<p>up processes and in general lead to lower Teff in case of carbon enhancement of
</p>
<p>the envelope due to the third dredge-up. Mass loss is included in parametrized form
</p>
<p>following (34.17) and (34.18), depending on the C/O ratio. Figure 34.8a gives an
</p>
<p>overview of the full evolution, and Fig. 34.8b shows the TP-AGB phase. Figure 34.9
</p>
<p>summarizes details during the TPs.
</p>
<p>The evolution starts on the main sequence, which lasts for 1.075Gyr. A further
</p>
<p>58Myr are spent on the RGB, before helium ignites in a moderately energetic
</p>
<p>core helium flash, with a peak helium luminosity of &ldquo;only&rdquo; logLHe=Lˇ D 7:2. The
surface luminosity of logL=Lˇ D 2:87 is also lower than that of the RGB tip of
low-mass stars indicating that at this mass, we are already in the transition region to
</p>
<p>intermediate-mass stars. Core helium burning, which lasts for 177Myr, takes place
</p>
<p>in a barely visible loop around logL=Lˇ D 1:8. Then the star starts to climb the
E-AGB, and the first thermal pulses set in around logL=Lˇ D 3:0. Figure 34.8b
shows this part of the HRD in more detail. In the course of the TPs the peak
</p>
<p>luminosity increases and the effective temperature drops. This leads to strongermass
</p>
<p>loss. The last TP, which sets in after C/O &gt; 1 is reached, leads to a strong excursion
</p>
<p>to temperatures as low as 2,000K. After this final pulse, due to the fast shedding
</p>
<p>of the envelope, the star contracts and crosses the HRD within 4,100 yrs. Its mass,
</p>
<p>and therefore the final white-dwarf mass, is 0:543Mˇ. The E- and TP-AGB last for
15.4 and 2.6Myr.
</p>
<p>Details of the TP-AGB phase are given in Fig. 34.9. As mentioned in Sect. 34.3,
</p>
<p>an asymptotic pulse behaviour is slowly approached after about 10 TPs, but not
</p>
<p>completely reached, even after all 15 pulses. The first pulse is, as is very often found
</p>
<p>in such calculations, different from the subsequent ones. The surface luminosity
</p>
<p>drops more than for the 5Mˇ star of Fig. 34.3, due to the less massive envelope.
However, it also shows a very short-lived peak of 500 &lsquo;years&rsquo; duration, which is
</p>
<p>not visible in Fig. 34.3. This is found in many models with massive envelopes and a
</p>
<p>deep penetration of the OCZ down to the hydrogen-burning shell.
</p>
<p>Figure 34.9 also shows the interaction of dredge-up, effective temperature and
</p>
<p>mass loss. With increasing pulse number, the star gets increasingly cooler. At the</p>

<p>dredge-up, ensured by the application of convective overshooting from the ISCZ.
</p>
<p>The dredge-up in fact starts already with the first thermal pulse, but is interrupted
</p>
<p>until TP 9. Then a significant increase up to C/O D 1 takes place. Note that also
some oxygen&ndash;the second result of helium burning&ndash;is dredged up. The increase in

</p>
<p>driven winds, for which large-amplitude pulsations are a necessary prerequisite (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 34.6), are taken into account only for periods longer than 400 days.
</p>
<p>34.8 Super-AGB Stars
</p>
<p>There is a small mass range between intermediate-mass and massive stars that may
</p>
<p>extend, depending on composition and author, from 7 to 12Mˇ or from � 8
to 10Mˇ, in which stars may ignite carbon burning off-centre under partially
degenerate core conditions. Above the upper mass limit carbon ignites at the non-
</p>
<p>degenerate centre of stars, and below the lower mass limit, the core does not reach
</p>
<p>the necessary ignition temperature of about 7 � 108K. To reach this temperature
requires core masses in excess of �1Mˇ, which, according to the empirical
findings and theoretical predictions of the initial-final mass relation, (Fig. 34.7) is
</p>
<p>not obviously possible. Nevertheless, this option should not be excluded.
</p>
<p>Siess (2006b, and reference therein) describes in detail the complicated evolution
</p>
<p>of such stars. The mass range, at a metallicity of ZD 0:02, is between 9 and
11:3Mˇ. Here, we summarize only the main events in it. The carbon flash happens
analogously to the helium flash we encountered earlier. It leads to a heating and
</p>
<p>expansion of the C/O core. However, these structural changes lead to a quenching of
</p>
<p>carbon burning, and core contraction is resumed. This now takes place under much
</p>
<p>less degenerate conditions, such that the core heats up and a second carbon ignition,
</p>
<p>in the literature called a &ldquo;flame&rdquo;, sets in, and leads to central carbon burning. After
</p>
<p>this phase, which may last a few thousand years, carbon burning proceeds in a
</p>
<p>radiative shell around a neon-oxygen core. If it encounters carbon pockets around
</p>
<p>the core, convection zones may appear for some time.
</p>
<p>There is also a number of convective episodes in the outer regions of the star.
</p>
<p>For example, the OCZ may reach the hydrogen-helium boundary before or during
</p>
<p>central carbon burning. This constitutes the second dredge-up we already know. It
</p>
<p>leads to the extinction of the hydrogen shell. The helium shell is providing most
</p>
<p>of the star&rsquo;s luminosity, and since the shell may be convective, in some stars, this
</p>
<p>convection zone may merge with the OCZ. As a result, the mass of the hydrogen-
</p>
<p>exhausted core is reduced substantially.
</p>
<p>Carbon burning can also be quenched again due to strong cooling by neutrino
</p>
<p>losses such that after core carbon burning the He-shell is the only nuclear energy
</p>
<p>source of the star. Obviously, this shell is thermally unstable and will resume thermal
</p>
<p>pulses, during which the hydrogen is also reignited. This is the reason for the
</p>
<p>name super-AGB stars, as such stars share properties with AGB stars, but are more
</p>
<p>luminous. Since mass loss has to be minor in order to allow a sufficient core growth
</p>
<p>during the AGB phase, the envelope mass is still substantial and super-AGB stars
</p>
<p>may indeed suffer up to thousand TPs.</p>

</p>
<p>The final fate of super-AGB stars depends on the mass of the NeO core. If it
</p>
<p>exceeds� 1:37Mˇ after carbon burning, the nuclear evolution will go through all
phases just as for massive stars. If it is slightly lower than this value initially, Ne
</p>
<p>ignition can be avoided and the core can grow due to shell burning and develop a
</p>
<p>highly degenerate NeO core of 1:37Mˇ. It will not undergo the thermal pulses,
but will end as a so-called electron-capture supernova (see Sect. 36.3.4), which
</p>
<p>is initiated by electron-capture reactions on 24Mg, 24Na, and other isotopes. This
</p>
<p>leads, among other effects, to the reduction of electron pressure, and a subsequent
</p>
<p>collapse of the core. A low-mass neutron star will be the remnant after the supernova
</p>
<p>explosion. If the NeO core mass always stays below this critical core mass, the
</p>
<p>star will end&ndash;after envelope expulsion&ndash;as a NeO white dwarf. In Fig. 34.10 an

</p>
<p>34.9 Post-AGB Evolution
</p>
<p>Stars of low and intermediate mass leave the AGBmainly due to the very short-lived
</p>
<p>superwind phase. Depending on the phase of the TP cycle this happens, the star may
</p>
<p>have a hydrogen- or helium-shell providing the majority of the total luminosity. The
</p>
<p>post-AGB stars are therefore divided into hydrogen and helium burners. The latter
</p>
<p>group generally has longer HRD-crossing timescales.
</p>
<p>With increasing Teff, mass loss is quickly dying out. Depending on the density
</p>
<p>and expansion velocity of the circumstellar shell which was lost during the TP-
</p>
<p>AGB phase, the increasingly higher number of UV photons emerging from the star,
</p>
<p>which is crossing the HRD to very high temperatures, may ionize the circumstellar
</p>
<p>matter and lead to the creation of a planetary nebula. The critical values for Teff are
</p>
<p>30,000K and 60,000K for hydrogen and helium ionization. In addition, a hot wind
</p>
<p>with velocities of the order of 1,000 km/s ploughs into the slowly expanding shell
</p>
<p>(of a few tens of km/s), compressing it and creating shocks.
</p>
<p>At the bluest point in the evolution (see Figs. 34.1 and 34.8), the shell is finally
</p>
<p>fading away and the star begins its final cooling phase and becomes a white dwarf.
</p>
<p>However, in some cases, the star may still suffer a last thermal pulse. Such late
</p>
<p>pulses are found in numerical calculations both during the HRD crossing and during
</p>
<p>the earliest cooling phases. In the course of such a late TP the star returns to the
</p>
<p>AGB and resumes a second HRD crossing. We show such an excursion in the HRD
</p>
<p>in Fig. 34.11. Due to the mixing and burning episodes connected with the pulse the
</p>
<p>thin envelope undergoes drastic changes in its composition. In fact, there is a small
</p>
<p>number of stars which evolved drastically over a few decades including changes of
</p>
<p>the surface composition. These are generally connected with late TP events. Famous
</p>
<p>examples are Sakurai&rsquo;s object (V4334 Sgr), FG Sge, and V650 Aql. There is still
</p>
<p>a discrepancy between the timescales for the changes between the models and the
</p>
<p>objects, but this may be due to insufficient theories for time-dependent convection.
</p>

<p>Later Phases of Core Evolution
</p>
<p>35.1 Nuclear Cycles
</p>
<p>The stellar evolution described abovemay seem to be rather complicatedwith regard
</p>
<p>to the nuclear shell instabilities, but also where the changes of the surface layers are
</p>
<p>concerned, for example, in the case of evolutionary tracks in the HR diagram. The
</p>
<p>processes appear much simpler and even become qualitatively predictable if we
</p>
<p>concentrate only on the central evolution. Extrapolating from central hydrogen and
</p>
<p>helium burning of sufficiently massive stars, we can imagine that the central region
</p>
<p>continues to pass through cycles of nuclear evolution which are represented by the
</p>
<p>following simple scheme:
</p>
<p>nuclear burning
</p>
<p>% &amp;
core heating exhaustion of fuel
</p>
<p>- .
core contraction
</p>
<p>The momentary burning will gradually consume all nuclei inside the convective
</p>
<p>core that serve as &ldquo;fuel&rdquo;. The exhausted core then contracts. This raises the central
</p>
<p>temperature until the next higher burning is ignited etc.
</p>
<p>As long as this scheme works, gradually heavier elements are built up near the
</p>
<p>centre from cycle to cycle. The new elements are evenly distributed in convective
</p>
<p>cores which usually become smaller with each step. For example, in the first cycle
</p>
<p>(hydrogen burning), the star develops a massive helium core, inside which a much
</p>
<p>smaller CO core is produced in the next cycle (helium burning), and so on.
</p>
<p>We have also seen that after the core is exhausted the burning usually continues
</p>
<p>in a concentric shell at the hottest place where the fuel is still present. A shell source
</p>
<p>can survive several of the succeeding nuclear cycles, each of which generates a new
</p>
<p>shell source, such that several of them can simultaneously burn outwards through

</p>
<p>highly evolved massive star. Along the vertical radius and below the horizontal radius some typical
</p>
<p>values of the mass, the temperature (in K), and the density (in g cm�3/ are indicated
</p>
<p>the star. They are separated by mass shells of different chemical composition;
</p>
<p>gradually heavier elements are encountered when going inwards from shell to shell.
</p>
<p>One then speaks of an &ldquo;onion skin model&rdquo;. A schematical cross section of such a
</p>
<p>model is shown in Fig. 35.1. The shell structure of the chemical composition can
</p>
<p>in fact become more complicated than that, since some shell sources bring forth a
</p>
<p>convective (or semiconvective) subshell, inside which the newly processed material
</p>
<p>is completely (or partially) mixed. This can be recognized in Fig. 36.4, which shows
</p>
<p>the interior composition of a model for a 25Mˇ star in a very advanced stage (just
before core collapse, see Chap. 36).We have also seen that, depending on the change
</p>
<p>of T in certain regions, a shell source may stop burning for some time and be
</p>
<p>reignited later.
</p>
<p>The simple evolution through nuclear cycles as sketched above can obviously
</p>
<p>be interrupted, either temporarily or for good. From the discussion of the nuclear
</p>
<p>reactions in Chap. 18 we know that the cycles must come to a termination, at the
</p>
<p>latest, when the innermost core consists of 56Fe (or neighbouring nuclei) and no
</p>
<p>further exothermic fusions are possible. However, it is easily seen that the sequence
</p>
<p>of cycles can be interrupted much earlier by another effect. Each contraction
</p>
<p>between consecutive burnings increases the central density %c. Assuming homology</p>

</p>
<p>The decisive factor, in parenthesis on the right-hand side, depends critically on the
</p>
<p>equation of state which is written as %�P ˛T �ı . For an ideal gas with ˛ D ı D 1,
we have dTc=Tc D .1=3/.d%c=%c/. This means that each contraction of the central
region increases the temperature, as well as the degeneracy parameter of the elec-
</p>
<p>tron gas Œ D constant for dT=T D .2=3/.d%=%/ (cf. Sects. 15.4 and 16.2)]. With
increasing degeneracy the exponents ˛ and ı become smaller. When the critical
</p>
<p>value ˛ D 3=4 is reached (ı is then still &gt; 0), the contraction (d%c&gt;0) no longer
leads to a further increase of Tc according to (35.1). The degeneracy in the central
</p>
<p>region has obviously decoupled the thermal from the mechanical evolution, and the
</p>
<p>cycle of consecutive nuclear burnings is interrupted. In this case the next burning
</p>
<p>can be ignited only via more complicated secondary effects, which originate, for
</p>
<p>example, in the evolution of the surrounding shell source (cf. Sect. 33.2).
</p>
<p>Other complicationsmay arise if the central region of a star suffers an appreciable
</p>
<p>loss of energy by strong neutrino emission (cf. Sect. 18.7). We have already seen
</p>
<p>(Sect. 33.5) that this can decrease the central temperature and, therefore, influence
</p>
<p>the onset of a burning.
</p>
<p>In any case, the nuclear cycles tend to develop central regions with increasing
</p>
<p>density and with heavier elements. We should note, however, that the later nuclear
</p>
<p>burnings are not capable of stabilizing the star long enough for us to observe many
</p>
<p>stars in such phases (as is the case with central hydrogen burning and helium
</p>
<p>burning). The main reason for this is the strongly decreasing difference in binding
</p>
<p>energy per nucleon (Fig. 18.1). Table 35.1 on page 447 gives typical durations
</p>
<p>for the various hydrostatic burning phases. From carbon burning on, these are
</p>
<p>comparable, respectively much shorter than the thermal timescale of the star. This
</p>
<p>means that any change in the core is no longer reflected by a change of surface
</p>
<p>properties, and therefore the star remains at its position in the Hertzsprung-Russell
</p>
<p>diagram. From the outside, one cannot see whether the star is 10,000 years or 10 h
</p>
<p>before the final core collapse!
</p>
<p>35.2 Evolution of the Central Region
</p>
<p>The description of the nuclear cycles in Sect. 35.1 has already given a rough outline
</p>
<p>of the central evolution of a star. We recognize it easily in Fig. 35.2, where the
</p>
<p>evolution of the centre is plotted in the lg %c&ndash;lgTc plane according to evolutionary
</p>
<p>calculations for different stellar masses M , covering the full range from brown
</p>
<p>dwarfs to the most massive stars. We see that Tc indeed rises roughly �%1=3c
[cf. (35.1)] as long as the central region remains non-degenerate. Of course, the</p>

<p>for stars of all masses (from 0.05Mˇ to 120Mˇ). The tracks are labelled with the stellar mass
</p>
<p>M (in Mˇ). The tracks have been collected from different sources but are all for a metallicity
</p>
<p>of approximately Z D 0:02. The brown dwarf track (M D 0:05Mˇ) includes the pre-main-
sequence phase and is from Baraffe et al. (2003). Stars withM from 0.45 to 5Mˇ are from the
</p>
<p>authors, those withM D 8:8, 9.5, and 12:0Mˇ (the super-AGB range) from Siess (2006a), and
the massive stars (M D 15, 40, and 120Mˇ) from Limongi and Chieffi (2006) (Data courtesy of
I. Baraffe, M. Limongi, L. Siess)
</p>
<p>details of the central evolution are much more complicated than predicted by the
</p>
<p>simple vector field in Fig. 28.1. During the burnings the curves bulge out to the upper
</p>
<p>left. This is not surprising, since then the changes are far from homologous [which is
</p>
<p>assumed in (35.1) and for Fig. 28.1], for example, owing to the restratification from
</p>
<p>a radiative to a convective core. After these interludes of burning, the evolution
</p>
<p>returns more or less to the normal slope. A parallel shift of the track from one to
</p>
<p>the next contraction is to be expected, since the contracting region (the core) will in
</p>
<p>general have a larger molecular weight, but a smaller mass.
</p>
<p>We have already mentioned in Sect. 28.1 and in Sect. 35.1 the important fact that
</p>
<p>each contraction with Tc � %1=3c brings the centre closer to the regime of electron
degeneracy. The degree of non-relativistic degeneracy is constant on the steeper
</p>
<p>lines T � %2=3. Once the central region has reached a certain degree of degeneracy
(where ˛ D 3=4 in the simple model of Sect. 28.1), Tc no longer increases, and
the next burning is not reached in this way (if at all), as we have already seen in
</p>
<p>Fig. 28.2. This happens the earlier in nuclear history, the closer to degeneracy a star
</p>
<p>has been at the beginning, i.e. the smaller M is (cf. Fig. 35.2). Recall (Sect. 22.2)
</p>
<p>that with increasing mass, also Tc increases, but %c decreases (Fig. 22.5). Therefore
</p>
<p>which nuclear cycle is completed before the star develops a degenerate core depends
</p>
<p>on the stellar massM:
</p>
<p>If the evolution were to proceed with complete mixing, we would only have to
</p>
<p>consider homogeneous stars of various M and different compositions, and to see
</p>
<p>whether their contraction leads to ignition (M &gt;fM 0) of a certain burning or to a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35.2 Evolution of the Central Region 443
</p>
<p>degenerate core (M &lt;fM 0). These limits for reaching the burning of H, He, and C
arefM 0 � 0:08; 0:3; and 0:8Mˇ, respectively.
</p>
<p>We know that the evolution lies far from the case of complete mixing, and only
</p>
<p>the innermost core of a star is processed by nuclear burning. But for sufficiently
</p>
<p>concentrated cores, the central contraction proceeds independently of the conditions
</p>
<p>at its boundary, i.e. independently of the non-contracting envelope. Therefore the
</p>
<p>above valuesfM 0 give roughly the limits for the masses of the corresponding cores.
Standard evolutionary calculations (assuming a typical initial composition, no
</p>
<p>convective overshooting, and no mass loss) give the following characteristic ranges
</p>
<p>of M , which we already mentioned earlier. After central hydrogen burning, low-
</p>
<p>mass starswithM &lt;M1.He/ � 2:3Mˇ develop degenerate He cores. After central
helium burning, intermediate-mass stars with M &lt;M1.CO/� 9Mˇ develop a
degenerate CO core. And in massive stars with M &gt;M1(CO) even the CO core
</p>
<p>remains non-degenerate while contracting for the ignition of the next burning. The
</p>
<p>precise values of the limiting masses M1 depend, for example, not only on the
</p>
<p>assumed initial composition but also on details of the physical effects considered.
</p>
<p>Another important influence is the downwards penetration of the outer convection
</p>
<p>zone after central helium burning (in the second dredge-up phase). This lowers the
</p>
<p>mass of the core and therefore encourages the evolution into stronger degeneracy,
</p>
<p>i.e. it lowersM1 (cf. Sect. 34.8). The depth of the second dredge-up depends on the
</p>
<p>choice of the mixing length parameter and the inclusion of convective overshooting.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 35.2 we see that the models withM D 0:05, 0:45, and 8:8Mˇ just miss the
ignition of H, He, and C, respectively.
</p>
<p>After a star has developed a strongly degenerate core it has not necessarily
</p>
<p>reached the very end of its nuclear history. This is only the case if the shell-source
</p>
<p>burning cannot sufficiently increase the mass of the degenerate core. However, the
</p>
<p>next burning is only delayed, and it will be ignited later in a &ldquo;flash&rdquo; if the shell
</p>
<p>source is able to increase the mass of the core to a certain limit M 0c . We have
seen in Sect. 33.3 that the critical mass for ignition of helium in a degenerate
</p>
<p>core is M 0c.He/� 0:48Mˇ, which agrees with the case shown in Fig. 35.2. The
corresponding critical mass of a degenerate CO core is M 0c.CO/� 1:4Mˇ as we
shall see immediately. Note that these limits are appreciably larger than the corre-
</p>
<p>sponding lower limits (fM 0) for reaching a burning by non-degenerate contraction,
as described above. This indicates the possibility that the evolution depends dis-
</p>
<p>continuously onM around the limitsM1(He) andM1(CO). For example, stars with
</p>
<p>M DM1.He/��M ignite helium via a flash in a degenerate core of mass 0:48Mˇ,
while stars withM DM1.He/C�M can ignite helium burning via core contraction
in (nearly) non-degenerate cores of about 0:3Mˇ (cf. the idealized scheme in
Fig. 35.3). Here one could imagine a bifurcation at M DM1, where fluctuations
would decide into which of the two regimes the star turns. In reality (by which we
</p>
<p>mean numerical models) the limit is &ldquo;softened up&rdquo; (a little bit of degeneracy leading
</p>
<p>to a baby flash, etc.), as can be seen in Fig. 5.19 of Salaris and Cassisi (2005). Nev-
</p>
<p>ertheless, the transition range is narrower than�0:5Mˇ between the two regimes.
The ignition of He and C under degenerate conditions in the 1.0 and 8:8Mˇ stars
</p>

<p>low-mass stars, before the
</p>
<p>electron gas in the core
</p>
<p>becomes degenerate
</p>
<p>temperature increase and further expansion until stable core He burning is reached.
</p>
<p>This realistic evolution is more complicated than the simple picture illustrated in
</p>
<p>Fig. 33.6.
</p>
<p>The evolution of degenerate CO cores is similar to that of degenerate helium
</p>
<p>cores in low-mass stars (Sects. 33.3 and 33.4). The structure of the core is more or
</p>
<p>less independent of the details of the envelope. Therefore the evolution of the central
</p>
<p>values converges for stars of differentM as long as the core mass is the same (cf.
</p>
<p>Fig. 35.2, M D 0:45 and 1:0Mˇ). While the mechanical structure of such a core
is determined by its mass Mc; its thermal properties depend on the surrounding
</p>
<p>shell source and on the neutrino losses. If the shell source were extinguished, the
</p>
<p>core would simply cool down with %c D constant (on a vertical line in Fig. 35.2) to
the white-dwarf state, as can be seen in this figure for the lower and intermediate-
</p>
<p>mass values. The brown dwarf will end as a hydrogen white dwarf, that with
</p>
<p>M D 0:45Mˇ as a helium white dwarf, those with higher masses up to 8:8Mˇ as
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, and the one with 9:5Mˇ possibly as a oxygen-neon
white dwarf.
</p>
<p>The continuous burning of the shell source increasesMc; which in turn increases
</p>
<p>the temperature in the shell source (cf. Sect. 33.2). It also increases the central den-
</p>
<p>sity, as we know from the discussion of the structure of degenerate configurations
</p>
<p>(Sect. 19.6), i.e. the evolution goes to the right in Fig. 35.2. The contraction due to
</p>
<p>this effect releases a large amount of gravitational energy, which, in the absence of
</p>
<p>energy losses (by conduction or neutrinos), would heat the core adiabatically.
</p>
<p>However, there are strong neutrino losses "� in this part of the T -% diagram
</p>
<p>(cf. Fig. 18.11), which modify the whole situation. Since "� increases appreciably
</p>
<p>with T , we should first make sure that there is no thermal runaway in the degenerate
</p>
<p>core (a &ldquo;neutrino flash&rdquo;), in analogy to a flash at the onset of a burning. This can
</p>
<p>be easily shown by the stability consideration presented in Chap. 25, where we
</p>
<p>analysed the reaction of the central region on an assumed increase d" of the energy
</p>
<p>release. This led to (25.30) with gravothermal heat capacity c� (25.29). Now we
replace d" by the small energy loss �d"� . If we neglect the perturbation of the flux

</p>
<p>Obviously the reversal of the sign of the right-hand side in the first equation (35.2)
</p>
<p>has reversed the conditions for stability. An ideal gas with ˛ D ı D 1 has the
gravothermal heat capacity c� &lt; 0, and neutrino losses are unstable since PT &gt; 0
(a thermal runaway with ever increasing neutrino losses). Degenerate cores with

<p>˛ ! 3=5; ı ! 0 have c� &gt; 0, i.e. PT &lt; 0, and these cores are stable: a small
additional energy loss reduces T and "� such that the core returns to a stable balance.

</p>
<p>treatment of the shell source stability is possible (Yoon et al. 2004).

<p>Numerical calculations approve the above conclusions: instead of leading to

<p>early model by Paczyński (1971). Although a star of only 3Mˇ is almost certainly
never able to develop a CO core of more than 0:8Mˇ, the figure still shows all
principle effects: The temperature profiles inside the cores of two different Mc

solid line to the right, and extremely high values of %c would necessarily occur if
</p>
<p>Mc could go to the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44Mˇ. Shortly before this limit, at
Mc � 1:4Mˇ, the central values reach the dotted line "� D "C to the right of which
pycnonuclear carbon burning dominates over the neutrino losses, "C &gt; "� . Now
</p>
<p>carbon burning starts with a thermal runaway. If this happens in the centre, then
</p>
<p>explosive carbon burning will finally disrupt the whole star, such that one should
</p>
<p>expect a supernova outburst that does not leave a remnant (a neutron star); compare
</p>
<p>this also with Chap. 36. We have already seen (Sect. 34.8) that in more massive
</p>
<p>stars carbon ignition starts in a shell, such that the star survives this event, but
</p>
<p>the principal story remains that the degenerate CO core is ignited when its mass
</p>
<p>Mc � 1:4Mˇ, although it depends on the initial mass and varies, according to Siess
(2006b), between 1.1 and 1:5Mˇ for ZAMS masses between 9.0 and 11:5Mˇ.
With increasingmass and decreasing core degeneracy the location of carbon ignition
</p>
<p>is moving towards the centre. At the end of the rather complicated carbon burning
</p>
<p>phase an ONeMg core is left over. For the initial mass range for which this core is
</p>
<p>degenerate, its mass is between 1.05 and 1:12Mˇ, again far from the Chandrasekhar
mass.</p>

<p>broken lines show the T stratification in the core for two consecutive stages; neutrino losses have
</p>
<p>produced a maximum of the temperature outside the centre (After Paczyński 1971)
</p>
<p>The just-described central evolution is the same for all stars that are able to
</p>
<p>develop a degenerate CO core ofMc � 1:4Mˇ. The obvious condition for this is that
the stellar massM is larger than that limit. For PM D 0 this would include all stars in
the range 1:4Mˇ&lt;M &lt;9Mˇ, i.e. the intermediate-mass stars (M � 2:3 : : : 9Mˇ)
and the low-mass stars withM &gt;1:4Mˇ. More precisely the stellar massM must
be larger than 1:4Mˇ at the moment of ignition (which does not occur before
Mc� 1:4Mˇ). This can require that the initial stellar mass Mi (on the main
sequence) was much larger than 1:4Mˇ if M has been reduced in the meantime
by a strong mass loss.
</p>
<p>Obviously there are two competing effects, the increase ofMc due to shell-source
</p>
<p>burning and the simultaneous decrease of the stellar mass M due to mass loss.
</p>
<p>Their changes in time are schematically shown in Fig. 35.5, and the outcome of
</p>
<p>this race decides the final stage of the star. The two values (M andMc/ reach their
</p>
<p>goal at 1.4Mˇ simultaneously if the initial mass has the critical value Mi(min).
Stars with Mi&gt;Mi(min) will ignite the CO core, since Mc can reach 1.4Mˇ.
For stars with initial masses Mi&lt;Mi(min), the mass loss will win and Mc never
</p>
<p>reaches 1.4Mˇ. Such stars will finally cool down to the white-dwarf state after
the shell source has died out near the surface (cf. Sect. 33.7). Unfortunately the

<p>total loss of mass during the evolution is not well known. The various mass loss

<p>formulae (Sect. 32.3) and the initial-final mass relation (Fig. 34.7) predict a total

</p>
<p>In any case, there are drastic differences between the final stages (white dwarfs or
</p>
<p>explosions) to be expected for stars in a narrow range ofMi nearMi(min). Current
</p>
<p>models (Sect. 34.8 and Fig. 35.2) put this mass range between�9 and 11Mˇ. These
numbers are all depending on the composition.
</p>
<p>It is clear that we have the same competition between PMc &gt; 0 and PM &lt; 0 in the
analogous problem of determining initial masses for which the degenerate helium
</p>
<p>cores are ignited (at Mc� 0:48Mˇ). In this case the bifurcation of the evolution
concerns mainly the composition of the final white dwarfs (He or CO).
</p>
<p>Finally, we have to consider the massive stars withM &gt; 9 : : : 11Mˇ, in which
the CO core does not become degenerate during the contraction after central
</p>
<p>helium burning. Therefore Tc rises sufficiently during this contraction to start the
</p>
<p>(non-explosive) carbon burning. Here the neutrino losses can become very large,
</p>
<p>carrying away most of the energy released by carbon burning. In the later burnings,
</p>
<p>massive stars can have neutrino luminosities up to 106 times larger thanLI but these
stages are very short-lived: for example, silicon burning lasts just a few days (see

<p>Chapter 36
</p>
<p>Final Explosions and Collapse
</p>
<p>We have seen that stars can evolve to the white dwarf stage through a sequence
</p>
<p>of consecutive hydrostatic states if they develop a degenerate core and have final
</p>
<p>masses less than the Chandrasekhar limitMCh. It is not well known, however, how
</p>
<p>much mass the stars can have initially (on the main sequence) in order to end this
</p>
<p>way. From what was discussed in Chap. 34, it seems that except for a very narrow
</p>
<p>mass range at the upper end, all stars that develop degenerate cores end as white
</p>
<p>dwarfs. The main uncertainty here is the total amount of mass lost by stellar winds.
</p>
<p>Other stars certainly undergo explosions, ejecting a large part of their mass, if
</p>
<p>not disrupting completely. In the case where a neutron star is left as a remnant the
</p>
<p>core must have undergone a collapse, since it cannot reach the neutron-star stage
</p>
<p>by a hydrostatic sequence. Collapse and explosions are connected with supernova
</p>
<p>events, and although the theory and the numerical models are well developed and
</p>
<p>far advanced, not all questions concerning the different mechanisms have been
</p>
<p>answered, and not all different observed phenomena can be explained so far. The
</p>
<p>singular event of SN 1987A and the ongoing large-scale supernovae searches, which
</p>
<p>have returned hundreds of such objects throughout the universe, have led to a much
</p>
<p>better understanding of stellar explosions, but have also raised new questions. In this
</p>
<p>section we only discuss some basic effects which certainly play an important role in
</p>
<p>late phases of more massive stars, and that will probably remain to be an important
</p>
<p>part of full theories of supernovae.
</p>
<p>Since we will not go into the details of the physics of collapse and explosion, and
</p>
<p>neither into the interesting question of explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, we
</p>
<p>refer the reader to the respective reviews on the subject, such as Hillebrandt and

<p>450 36 Final Explosions and Collapse
</p>
<p>36.1 The Evolution of the CO-Core
</p>
<p>After central helium burning, the further evolution depends critically on the question
</p>
<p>whether or not the CO-core becomes degenerate in the ensuing contraction phase.
</p>
<p>Clearly this will depend on the mass of the core. Since its contraction is practically
</p>
<p>independent of the envelope, the core can be considered as if it were a contracting
</p>
<p>gaseous sphere with zero surface pressure, as discussed in Chap. 28.
</p>
<p>We first estimate the critical core mass that separates the case where the
</p>
<p>contraction leads to increasing temperatures from the case where degeneracy
</p>
<p>prevents further heating. For this purpose we replace the equation of state by
</p>
<p>an interpolation formula between different asymptotic behaviours. In the cores of
</p>
<p>evolved stars the molecular weight per electron is �e � 2, while that per ion is
�0 � 12, and therefore the pressure of non-degenerate electrons (�1=�e) dominates
the ion pressure (�1=�0). This holds even more so if the electrons are degenerate.
For simplicity we here neglect radiation pressure, as well as the creation of electron&ndash;
</p>
<p>positron pairs, which can also lead to partial degeneracy at very high temperatures
</p>
<p>and low densities (see Sect. 36.3.5). We then approximate the equation of state by
</p>
<p>the simple form
</p>
<p>P � Pe D

%T CK&#13;
</p>
<p>�
%
</p>

</p>
<p>�&#13;
: (36.1)
</p>
<p>In the second term the exponent &#13; is not a constant, allowing for non-relativistic and
</p>
<p>relativistic degeneracy. It varies from &#13; D 5=3 for % � 106 g cm�3 to &#13; D 4=3 for
%� 106 g cm�3, while K&#13; varies from the constant in (15.23) to that in (15.26).
</p>
<p>The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (2.4) yields as a rough estimate for the
</p>
<p>central values (which we denote by subscript 0):

</p>
<p>material alone and N% D 3Mc=.4�R3c/ is assumed to be proportional to %0. The
dimensionless factor f , containing, for example, the ratio N%=%0, is kept constant in
this consideration. Using (36.1) for the centre and eliminating P0 from (36.2) yields

<p>The behaviour of these evolutionary tracks is the same as that discussed in Chap. 28,
</p>
<p>if there M is replaced by Mc (The way we have made our estimate here, keeping

</p>
<p>For example, in the non-degenerate case [first term on the right of (36.3) dominant],
</p>
<p>the slope of the tracks is 1/3 as indicated on the left-hand side of Fig. 36.1, and
</p>
<p>the tracks for differentMc are shifted at the same values of %0 like T0 � M 2=3c , in
analogy to Sect. 28.1.
</p>
<p>With sufficiently growing central density, relativistic degeneracy becomes impor-

then the core at zero temperature is fully relativistic, degenerate, and in hydrostatic

&ldquo;summit&rdquo; of the dotted line in Fig. 28.1.
</p>
<p>The events in the following stages depend sensitively on details of the material
</p>
<p>functions, the initial models, and the numerical calculations. These factors can
</p>
<p>decide, for example, whether core collapse is followed by an explosion, whether a
</p>
<p>remnant is left, etc. In view of the uncertainties involved and themany complications
</p>
<p>which can occur, it is not surprising that the present picture is not too clear (see
</p>
<p>Heger et al. 2003 for an overview of possibilities). Nevertheless we will tentatively
</p>
<p>classify the different evolutionary scenarios according to the core mass Mc after
</p>
<p>helium burning. As can be seen, for example, from (36.3), the tracks for lower
</p>
<p>mass are below those for higher mass. We distinguish four cases, each of which
</p>
<p>is represented by one or more schematic evolutionary tracks in Fig. 36.1.
</p>
<p>Case 1. If Mc &lt; Mcrit � MCh, and if the envelope is not massive enough (due
either to the original mass or to mass loss), so that Mc cannot approach MCh
during the shell burning phase, T0 first grows in the non-degenerate regime until
</p>
<p>a maximum is reached. Then the core becomes degenerate, starts to cool, and the
</p>
<p>star must become a white dwarf. This is most likely the fate for most intermediate
</p>
<p>mass stars, which evolve as single stars (Chap. 34; Fig. 34.7). Only if a star is a
</p>
<p>member of a binary system and accretes sufficient mass at certain rates carbon can
</p>
<p>finally be ignited in a flash. A very popular scenario is the double-degenerate one, in
</p>
<p>which a CO-WD and a He-WD in a binary system merge due to the loss of angular
</p>
<p>momentum by gravitational radiation. It would explain how the CO core would
</p>
<p>reachMCh and why the spectrum would be devoid of hydrogen lines (the definition
</p>
<p>of type I supernovae). From the shell in which the flash occurs, a helium detonation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36.1 The Evolution of the CO-Core 453
</p>
<p>wave (see Sect. 36.2.4) starts, moving both out- and inwards (This is in fact a
</p>
<p>simplified one-dimensional picture; in reality the flash occurs at a certain location,
</p>
<p>and the front travels in all directions and even around the star.). When it arrives near
</p>
<p>the centre, carbon will be ignited and a second (carbon) detonation front moves
</p>
<p>outwards, too. In this double-detonation model the star will finally be disrupted
</p>
<p>(for a summary see, for instance, Hillebrandt and Niemeyer 2000). Alternatively, in
</p>
<p>the single degenerate scenario, the CO-WD accretes matter from a non-degenerate
</p>
<p>companion. This could be a main-sequence star or a giant, for example, on the RGB.
</p>
<p>If the mass transfer rate is favourable, the accreted matter is burnt hydrostatically
</p>
<p>and the core grows in mass up toMCh. Again, the envelope is hydrogen free and the
</p>
<p>spectrumwould classify the supernova as of type I. In this scenario the previous loss
</p>
<p>of matter in the pre-WD evolution is effectively reversed. A third possibility is that
</p>
<p>explosions in the accreted helium layers shock the CO-core sufficiently to trigger a
</p>
<p>nuclear runaway, although the core has not reached the Chandrasekhar mass. These
</p>
<p>are the Sub-Chandrasekharmodels. In all three cases the explosion of the star is due
</p>
<p>to a thermonuclear runaway resulting from the carbon flash. These are the type Ia
</p>
<p>supernovae. We will discuss basic facts of the carbon flash briefly in Sect. 36.2.
</p>
<p>Case 2. If initially Mc &lt; Mcrit, but if the remaining envelope is sufficiently
</p>
<p>massive, so that because of shell burning,Mc can grow to MCh, the core becomes
</p>
<p>degenerate and cools after having reached a maximum temperature. But %0 increases
</p>
<p>with Mc, and finally carbon burning begins (e.g. by pycnonuclear reactions;
</p>
<p>compare with Sect. 35.2). It starts in a highly degenerate state and is therefore
</p>
<p>explosive. This carbon flash can occur in stars that have started on the main sequence
</p>
<p>in the range 4 .M=Mˇ &lt; 8, if their mass loss has not been too strong. However, as
we have mentioned before, this seems to be unlikely, although it cannot be excluded
</p>
<p>completely, for example, in the case of extremely metal-poor or metal-free stars
</p>
<p>(so-called Population III or First Stars), where mass loss may be significantly lower
</p>
<p>than in stars of solar metallicity (Chap. 9). Since the spectrum in such an event would
</p>
<p>contain hydrogen lines, as is the definition for type II supernovae, but the explosion
</p>
<p>mechanism is that of a thermonuclear runaway, typical for type Ia supernovae, such
</p>
<p>events are called supernovae of type 1.5. Whether they exist remains unclear.
</p>
<p>Case 3. IfMcrit &lt; Mc . 40Mˇ, the evolutionary track misses the non-relativistic
region of degeneracy. The core heats up, reaching successively higher nuclear fusion
</p>
<p>phases. In a small mass range above the minimummass to start carbon burning (this
</p>
<p>critical mass is usually refered to asMup; see Fig. 34.10), electron captures by Mg,
</p>
<p>Na, and Ne reduce the pressure and a central collapse ensues. This is the fate of
</p>
<p>some of the super-AGB stars of Sect. 34.8, if the mass of the resulting NeO-core
</p>
<p>is initially below 1:37Mˇ to avoid Ne ignition, but reaches this critical value due
to shell burning. This will be discussed further in Sect. 36.3.4. The corresponding
</p>
<p>CO-core mass limit is of order 2�4Mˇ. ForMc &amp; 4Mˇ, photodisintegration of Ne
and Mg nuclei brings &#13;ad below 4=3 and triggers a collapse. Both types of collapse
</p>
<p>may lead to neutron-star formation and to the ejection of the envelope, the latter
</p>
<p>mechanism also to black holes as the stellar remnants. It is assumed to cause the
</p>
<p>standard type II supernovae, and will be introduced in Sect. 36.3.</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>454 36 Final Explosions and Collapse
</p>
<p>Case 4. : If Mc &amp; 40Mˇ, the cores also reach the carbon burning in a non-
degenerate state as in Case 3. This mass limit is, as always, metallicity dependent,
</p>
<p>and corresponds to helium-core mass of� 65Mˇ and an initial mass of� 140Mˇ.
After carbon burning the evolutionary tracks in Fig. 36.1 cross the region of pair
</p>
<p>creation, which also reduces &#13;ad. If &#13;ad &lt; 4=3 in an appreciable fraction of
</p>
<p>the core, say, within 40% of its mass, then the core collapses adiabatically until
</p>
<p>the temperature of oxygen burning is reached. This may stop the collapse and
</p>
<p>make the star explode; if not, the collapse would lead into the region of instability
</p>
<p>because of photodisintegration, and the events would be as in Case 3. We will
</p>
<p>discuss this in Sect. 36.3.5. The remnants of stars in this mass range will be neutron
</p>
<p>stars (for lower masses), black holes by fallback on the proto-neutron star, or black
</p>
<p>holes by direct formation. Pair-instability supernovae, a subclass of type II core
</p>
<p>collapse supernovae, leave no remnant at all.
</p>
<p>36.2 Carbon Ignition in Degenerate Cores
</p>
<p>Consider stars starting with masses in the range 4 .M=Mˇ . 8 and assume
that they have almost no mass loss. After helium burning, they will form a
</p>
<p>CO-core that is degenerate, and in the subsequent evolution, Mc grows owing to
</p>
<p>shell burning until it comes close to MCh. During this phase the central density
</p>
<p>increases with increasingMc (similar to a sequence of white dwarfs with increasing
</p>
<p>mass). The energy released in the core during this contraction is transported by
</p>
<p>electron conduction in the direction of the centre, where the temperature is smaller
</p>
<p>and neutrino losses (see Sect. 18.7) carry away the energy. The increase of the
</p>
<p>central density or of the temperature at the place of its maximum finally ignites
</p>
<p>carbon burning.
</p>
<p>36.2.1 The Carbon Flash
</p>
<p>The ignition of carbon in degenerate CO-cores of mass Mc � MCh has already
been discussed in Sect. 35.2. As described there, the ignition of carbon may occur
</p>
<p>in the centre or in the shell of maximum temperature. The general properties of
</p>
<p>the flash are the same in both cases. We discuss here the central ignition in the
</p>
<p>case of strong degeneracy, but recall that most likely only stars above 8Mˇ will
reach carbon ignition and this will happen off-centre at very modest degeneracy.
</p>
<p>The carbon flash under such circumstances is described in the literature about super-
</p>
<p>AGB stars, for example, by Garcı́a-Berro and Iben (1994).
</p>
<p>In Fig. 36.2 the lg %0-lg T0 plane is shown again with an evolutionary
</p>
<p>path of the centre. The stability behaviour of the degenerate core depends
</p>
<p>critically on the question whether the energy balance is dominated by neutrino
</p>
<p>losses ("CC � "� &lt; 0: stable) or by carbon burning ("CC � "� &gt; 0: unstable).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36.2 Carbon Ignition in Degenerate Cores 455
</p>
<p>Fig. 36.2 Schematic evolution of the central region during and after the carbon flash (heavy). It
</p>
<p>corresponds to the evolution of type B� in Fig. 36.1. The flash starts when the central density
</p>
<p>%0 (in g cm
�3/ or the central temperature T0 (in K) is so high that the neutrino losses do not
</p>
<p>overcome the energy generation by carbon burning. The temperature then rises almost at constant
</p>
<p>density until degeneracy is removed. The dot-dashed line labelled � D 1 indicates where the gas
pressure is twice the (degenerate) pressure at temperature zero; it roughly separates the regions of
</p>
<p>degeneracy and non-degeneracy. The broken line labelled C, O gives the temperature reached if
</p>
<p>all the energy released by carbon burning is used to increase the internal energy. The dotted line
</p>
<p>labelled Fe/˛ D 1 shows the points for which statistical equilibrium gives equal abundances of
iron and helium
</p>
<p>The borderline "CC � "� D 0 bends down at a few 109 g cm�3, since "cc
here increases mainly with increasing density (pycnonuclear reactions, see
</p>
<p>Sect. 18.4). Numerical calculations indicate that CO-cores reach the critical
</p>
<p>border "CC � "� D 0 between stability and instability at a density of 2 �
109 g cm�3.
</p>
<p>The slightest increase in temperature now makes "CC � "� &gt; 0. Because of
degeneracy the pressure does not increase and there is no consumption of energy
</p>
<p>through expansion. Therefore the temperature rises even more: a violent flash
</p>
<p>occurs. As in the case of the helium flash (see Sect. 33.4) the involved matter heats
</p>
<p>up at constant density until degeneracy is removed. Then it expands.
</p>
<p>36.2.2 Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium
</p>
<p>How violent the carbon flash can become is seen from a simple estimate. In a
</p>
<p>mixture of equal parts of C and O the carbon burning can release 2:5�1017 erg/g and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>456 36 Final Explosions and Collapse
</p>
<p>the subsequent oxygen burning twice this amount. If all this energy is used to heat
</p>
<p>the material, it can reach the temperatures indicated by the dashed line labelled C, O
</p>
<p>in Fig. 36.2. This line is somewhat curved since the specific heat depends slightly on
</p>
<p>the density. At these temperatures of nearly 1010K the energy of the photons exceeds
</p>
<p>the binding energy of the nuclei, which are thus disintegrated. Photodisintegration,
</p>
<p>for example, of Ne nuclei
</p>
<p>20NeC &#13; !16 OC ˛; (36.9)
</p>
<p>was discussed in Sect. 18.5.3. The inverse reaction of (36.9) can also occur, and the
</p>
<p>photon generated by this process can disintegrate another Ne nucleus. The processes
</p>
<p>are very similar to ionization and recombination of atoms. In nuclear statistical
</p>
<p>equilibrium (NSE) the abundances of O, Ne, and ˛ particles can be derived from
</p>
<p>a set of equations similar to the Saha equation (14.11):
</p>

<p>where GO; G˛ , and GNe are the statistical weights, while Q is the difference of
</p>
<p>binding energies
</p>
<p>Q D .mO Cm˛ �mNe/c2: (36.11)
</p>
<p>In addition to (36.10) there are two other conditions, one of which relates the
</p>
<p>particle numbers to the density, the other one describing the initial composition,
</p>
<p>since (36.9) and its inverse cannot change nO � n˛ . Of course, one cannot consider
a single reaction only, but has to take into account all reactions that can take place
</p>
<p>simultaneously. For example, ˛ particles generated by (36.9) can also be captured
</p>
<p>by 12C or 20Ne (The problem is similar when ionization of different elements takes
</p>
<p>place simultaneously. They are not independent of each other, since all of them
</p>
<p>produce electrons which influence all recombination rates.).
</p>
<p>If the temperatures are sufficiently high, many nuclei are disintegrated by photons
</p>
<p>and their fragments react again. The abundances of the different elements are then
</p>
<p>determined by a set of &ldquo;Saha formulae&rdquo; of the type (36.10). The nucleus 5626Fe as
</p>
<p>the most stable one plays a crucial role in this statistical equilibrium. It can be
</p>
<p>disintegrated by photons into ˛ particles and neutrons:
</p>
<p>&#13; C5626 Fe � 13˛ C 4n: (36.12)
</p>
<p>In order to determine the ratio nFe=na we consider quite general reactions of the

<p>equations for nFe and n˛ :
</p>
<p>Suppose again that the ratio of protons to neutrons per unit volume, normally

<p>called NZ= NN , is 13/15. Then equilibrium demands that all matter goes into 56Fe
(the nucleus of the highest binding energy per nucleon) for temperatures that are
</p>
<p>not too high, and into 4He for high temperatures (see Fig. 36.3a). However, if we
</p>
<p>assume NZ= NN D 1, then for the former temperatures 5628Ni is the dominant nucleus,
since it has the highest binding energy per nucleon of all nuclei with Z D N . With
increasing temperature the equilibrium shifts from 56Ni to 54 Fe+2p and finally to 14
4He. For very high temperatures it may even shift to the basic constituents, protons
</p>
<p>and neutrons (see Fig. 36.3b).
</p>
<p>The value NZ= NN at the occurrence of photodisintegration depends on the weak
interaction processes (ˇ decays) during the nuclear history of the stellar matter.
</p>
<p>In any case, in equilibrium at moderate temperatures, one expects nuclei of the

<p>36.2.3 Hydrostatic and Convective Adjustment
</p>
<p>Even during the rapid helium flash the star remains very nearly in hydrostatic
</p>
<p>equilibrium, and convection can carry away all the released nuclear energy with-
</p>
<p>out becoming appreciably superadiabatic. The situation is completely different
</p>
<p>if unstable carbon burning proceeds in a degenerate core on a time-scale of
</p>
<p>milliseconds.
</p>
<p>Consider the events after the onset of the carbon flash in the centre. The rapid
</p>
<p>rise of the central temperature is sufficient for immediately starting higher nuclear
</p>
<p>reactions, such as oxygen burning, which release additional energy. In one single
</p>
<p>runaway the central temperature rises so much that statistical equilibrium between
</p>
<p>Fe and He is reached, and eventually degeneracy is removed (see Fig. 36.2). Then
</p>
<p>the pressure increases and the central region starts to expand. This will occur
</p>
<p>roughly on a timescale �", in which the central temperature and the internal energy
</p>
<p>u rise. Since PT =T � "CC=u, we have
</p>
<p>�" D
cPT
</p>
<p>"CC
: (36.20)
</p>
<p>The other regions of the core react on the central expansion on the hydrostatic
</p>
<p>timescale �hydr � .G N%/�1=2 [compare with (2.19)], where N% is the mean density
of the core. As long as � WD �"=�hydr � 1 the core follows the central expansion
quasi-hydrostatically. If, however, � � 1, then the layers above cannot react rapidly
enough, and a compression wave will move outwards with the speed of sound. If the
</p>
<p>push by the suddenly expanding burning region is sufficiently strong, an outwards
</p>
<p>travelling shock wave may develop.
</p>
<p>Owing to the energy release in the flash, a central convective core will form,
</p>
<p>which has two effects. Part of the surplus energy is carried away (reducing the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36.2 Carbon Ignition in Degenerate Cores 459
</p>
<p>intensity of the flash), and new nuclear fuel is brought to the region of carbon
</p>
<p>burning (enhancing the flash). A characteristic timescale for convection is �conv �
`m=vs, where `m is the mixing length and vs the local velocity of sound. Indeed
</p>
<p>turbulent elements will scarcely move faster than vs, since otherwise shock waves
</p>
<p>would strongly damp the motion. If � WD �"=�conv � 1, convection is able to carry
away all the nuclear energy released. If, however, � � 1, then convection cannot
carry away the released energy.
</p>
<p>The timescales �hydr and �conv are very short indeed. For the central parts of the
</p>
<p>core with % &gt; 108 g cm�3, one finds typically �hydr � 0:1 s, and �conv is of the
same order. However, for T D 2 : : : 3 � 109K, the local timescale �" for the flash is
of the order of 10�6 s. Therefore � and � are both � 1. This means that, instead of
hydrostatic adjustment, a compression wave will start outwards and that &ldquo;convective
</p>
<p>blocking&rdquo; prevents a rapid spread of released energy in the core. The changes caused
</p>
<p>by the flash in one mass element propagate comparatively slowly to other parts.
</p>
<p>These estimates clearly show that the carbon flash and the following explosion
</p>
<p>can be treated accurately only when the full hydrodynamical equations are solved.
</p>
<p>The important role of convection and the propagation of burning fronts necessitate
</p>
<p>three-dimensional models. Such models are the current state of the art, but will not
</p>
<p>be the subject of this book.
</p>
<p>36.2.4 Combustion Fronts
</p>
<p>The local nuclear timescale �" at the onset of the flash is rather short. If a flash is
</p>
<p>started somewhere in a degenerate CO-core, the burning proceeds at such high rates
</p>
<p>that the fuel in this mass element is used up almost instantaneously. To be more
</p>
<p>precise, the consumption is completed locally before the layers above can adjust.
</p>
<p>Only then is the unburnt material ahead heated to ignition (either by compression or
</p>
<p>by energy transport, which may be by convection), and the flash proceeds outwards.
</p>
<p>But the burning is always confined to a layer of (practically) zero thickness. We have
</p>
<p>an outward-moving combustion front, which can be of two different types.
</p>
<p>We have seen that a shock wave develops. Matter in front penetrates the
</p>
<p>discontinuity with supersonic velocity and is compressed and heated. If this suffices
</p>
<p>to ignite the fuel, then the combustion front coincides with the shock front moving
</p>
<p>outwards supersonically. This is called a detonation front. It releases enough
</p>
<p>energy to lead to a complete stellar explosion, but matter ahead of the blast wave
</p>
<p>cannot expand and ignites under typical white-dwarf conditions. Temperatures and
</p>
<p>densities are so high that NSE is reached and is peaking around Ni. This is in conflict
</p>
<p>with the presence of intermediate-mass elements seen in the spectra of some type Ia
</p>
<p>supernovae.
</p>
<p>If the compression in the shock does not ignite the fuel, then the ignition
</p>
<p>temperature is reached owing to energy transport (convection or conduction). This
</p>
<p>gives a slower, subsonic motion for the burning front and contains a discontinuity
</p>
<p>in which density and pressure drop. This is a deflagration front. Since it allows the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>460 36 Final Explosions and Collapse
</p>
<p>nucleosynthesis to occur at lower density and pressure, NSE peaks at lower mass
</p>
<p>numbers and intermediate-mass elements can be created. Whether such deflagration
</p>
<p>models can unbind completely the white dwarf is unclear. Higher-dimensional
</p>
<p>simulations seem to be more promising to achieve this.
</p>
<p>Obviously the speed of a deflagration front is controlled by that of energy
</p>
<p>transport. This in turn depends on the conductivity (thermal or convective) and
</p>
<p>on the temperature difference between the deflagration front and the material
</p>
<p>ahead. Numerical modelling thus needs hydrodynamical simulations of convection.
</p>
<p>Simple mixing length theory (Chap. 7), which has been useful for hydrostatic stellar
</p>
<p>evolution phases, certainly will not suffice to compute accurate models.
</p>
<p>In both cases the deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium are mainly confined
</p>
<p>to a thin shell across which the pressure is discontinuous and all nuclear energy is
</p>
<p>released. The momentum of the matter approaching a detonation front superson-
</p>
<p>ically is balanced by the higher pressure behind the front; the momentum of the
</p>
<p>matter approaching a deflagration front subsonically is balanced by the recoil of the
</p>
<p>matter moving away from it behind the front. The front in both cases is unstable to
</p>
<p>spatial perturbations, the scale of which is well below any numerical resolution in
</p>
<p>the simulations, and must be represented by a physical subscale model.
</p>
<p>For an account of the theory of the two types of combustion fronts, see Courant
</p>
<p>and Friedrichs (1976), Landau and Lifshitz (1987), and Hillebrandt and Niemeyer
</p>
<p>(2000). As with normal shock waves, the theoretical results follow from the
</p>
<p>conservation of mass, momentum, and energy of the matter going through the
</p>
<p>discontinuity. For energy conservation, however, it also has to be taken into account
</p>
<p>that energy is released at the discontinuity. This makes the two types of solutions
</p>
<p>(detonation and deflagration waves) possible, while the theory of normal shock
</p>
<p>waves allows only that solution in which the density of matter going through the
</p>
<p>discontinuity increases.
</p>
<p>In principle, detonation fronts as well as deflagration fronts can occur in stars.
</p>
<p>Which of the two will develop depends on the details of the transport mechanism,
</p>
<p>which determines the motion of a deflagration front and of the preceding shock.
</p>
<p>In some cases the explosion may start out with a slow deflagration front, which
</p>
<p>allows some expansion of the layers ahead of the front, but which switches at
</p>
<p>some point into a detonation, when the front begins to progress supersonically.
</p>
<p>These are the delayed detonation models, which combine the advantage of allowing
</p>
<p>intermediate-mass elements to be created and deliver typical supernova energies,
</p>
<p>which are of order 1051 erg.
</p>
<p>The details of type Ia supernova explosions can be uncovered only by very
</p>
<p>complicated and challenging numerical simulations that take into account both
</p>
<p>hydrodynamics and nuclear processes, and should resolve scales ranging from that
</p>
<p>of white dwarfs (� 1; 000 km) down to that of the burning flame of a few cm. Early
one-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations for detonation models were done by
</p>
<p>Arnett (1969) and Ivanova et al. (1977). A classical deflagration model, still in one
</p>
<p>dimension, is by Nomoto et al. (1976) and Nomoto (1984). State-of-the-art models
</p>
<p>are mostly 3-dimensional; a summary and discussion can be found in the reviews
</p>
<p>by Hillebrandt and Niemeyer (2000) and Roepke (2008).</p>

<p>36.3 Collapse of Cores of Massive Stars 461
</p>
<p>36.2.5 Carbon Burning in Accreting White Dwarfs
</p>
<p>Rather similar phenomena to those described above for CO-cores of single stars
</p>
<p>can occur in CO white dwarfs which are members of binary systems. They can
</p>
<p>receive appreciable amounts of matter from their companions. The accreted matter
</p>
<p>is compressed and heated, and its ignition can give rise to various phenomena.
</p>
<p>For example, if helium is accreted with relatively low rates (about 10�8Mˇ/
year), a helium flash will be ignited in a shell of high density. The result can be
</p>
<p>a double detonation wave: a helium detonation front running outwards and a carbon
</p>
<p>detonation front going to the centre. As a result the white dwarf will be disrupted.
</p>
<p>For higher accretion rates the new material can burn quietly near the surface,
</p>
<p>thus simply increasing the mass of the CO white dwarf. When it approachesMCh,
</p>
<p>the density in the inner parts becomes so large that carbon burning starts either
</p>
<p>in the centre, or in the shell of maximum temperature. This results in a flash,
</p>
<p>and a deflagration (or detonation) front starts, as discussed above for single stars.
</p>
<p>The white dwarf will also be disrupted. Both possibilities correspond to Case 1 of
</p>
<p>Sect. 36.1. It is this mechanism which is generally believed to cause the Type Ia
</p>
<p>supernovae. Note that it has to be invoked, since the spectra of these supernovae
</p>
<p>show no hydrogen, and because evolving single stars of M &lt; 10Mˇ may lose so
much mass that their CO-core can never come close toMCh.
</p>
<p>36.3 Collapse of Cores of Massive Stars
</p>
<p>According to Fig. 36.1 one can expect that the cores of massive stars will not cool,
</p>
<p>because of non-relativistic degeneracy, but will heat up during core contraction until
</p>
<p>the next type of nuclear fuel is ignited. The core then is either non-degenerate (larger
</p>
<p>core mass Mc/ or degenerate but to the upper right of the &ldquo;summit&rdquo; of the line
</p>
<p>˛ D 3=4 in Fig. 28.1. In both cases the gravothermal heat capacity is negative, and
the burning is self-controlled. In the following we discuss stars with core masses in
</p>
<p>the rangeMch &lt; Mc &lt; 40Mˇ. The evolutionary paths of these stars will avoid the
region of ˛ &lt; 3=4, where in Fig. 28.1 the arrows point downwards.
</p>
<p>After going through several cycles of nuclear burning and contraction, the core
</p>
<p>will heat up to silicon burning.Nuclear burning in several shell sources has produced
</p>
<p>layers of different chemical composition, as shown in Fig. 36.4. Finally the central
</p>
<p>region of the core reaches a temperature at which the abundances are determined
</p>
<p>by nuclear statistical equilibrium. In this stage the core is in a peculiar state
</p>
<p>in several respects. Since the electron gas dominates the pressure, and since at
</p>
<p>temperatures of T9 � 10 the electrons are relativistic (kT � 1:7mec2), the adiabatic
exponent &#13;ad is close to 4/3. In the more massive stars photodisintegration of
</p>

</p>
<p>we now discuss a simple solution.
</p>
<p>36.3.1 Simple Collapse Solutions
</p>
<p>Suppose we have a core at the onset of collapse, say, with central values
</p>
<p>%0 D 1010 g cm�3; T0 � 1010K. The electrons are relativistically degenerate. Then
the equation of state is polytropic and can be written as
</p>
<p>P D K 0%4=3; (36.21)
</p>
<p>whereK 0 D K4=3=�4=3e [comparewith (15.26)]. Therefore the core can be described
by a polytrope of index 3. We have already discussed the collapse of such a
</p>
<p>polytrope in Sect. 19.11. As we have seen there, the parameter � appearing in the
</p>
<p>modified Emden equation (19.81) is a measure of the deviation from hydrostatic</p>

possible only for values 0 &lt; � &lt; �m D 6:544 � 10�3, where � D �m corresponds
to the strongest deviation from equilibrium. For � D �m no homologous collapse of
a polytrope of n D 3 is possible.
</p>
<p>We now adapt the formalism of Sect. 19.11 for application to the collapse of
</p>
<p>stellar cores. The solution of the spatial structure is given by the function w.z/;
</p>
<p>which obeys (19.81). We denote the value of z at the surface of the collapsing core

<p>by z3, so that w.z3/ D 0; for � D 0 one has z3 D 6:897. It increases with � and

<p>36.3 Collapse of Cores of Massive Stars 465
</p>
<p>computations, in agreement with the models by Goldreich and Weber, and Yahil
</p>
<p>and Lattimer. The maximum separates the homologously collapsing inner core (left)
</p>
<p>from the nearly free-falling outer part of the core (right). The outer core collapses
</p>
<p>supersonically; the sound speed is exceeded at a location somewhat interior to the
</p>
<p>maximum collapse velocity. During collapse the boundary between the two regimes
</p>
<p>is not fixed but moves to smallerm values: mass from the inner core is released into
</p>
<p>the free-fall regime. This corresponds to the decrease ofMCh with increasing �e as
</p>
<p>discussed above.
</p>
<p>The collapse is extremely short-lived; it takes a time which is of the order
</p>
<p>of the free-fall time. If the core starts with an initial density of 1010 g cm�3 one
obtains �ff � .G N%/�1=2 � 40 ms at the onset of collapse, while it is 0.4ms for
N% D 1014 g cm�3.
</p>
<p>36.3.2 The Reflection of the Infall
</p>
<p>Because of the collapse, the density finally approaches that of neutron stars (nuclear
</p>
<p>densities of the order 1014 g cm�3/. Then the equation of state becomes &ldquo;stiff,&rdquo; i.e.
the matter becomes almost incompressible. This terminates the collapse.
</p>
<p>If the whole process were completely elastic, then the kinetic energy of the
</p>
<p>collapsing matter would be sufficient to bring it back after reflection to the state
</p>
<p>just before the collapse began. This energy can be estimated roughly from

<p>whereMc is the mass of the collapsing core, while Rn and Rwd are the typical radii
</p>
<p>of a neutron star and of a white dwarf.We compare this with the energyEe necessary

<p>forM D 10Mˇ. Realistic estimates bringEe down to 1050 erg, and therefore only a
small fraction of the energy involved in the collapse of the core is sufficient to blow
</p>
<p>away the envelope. In predicting what happens after the bounce, one has to find out
</p>
<p>what (small) fraction of the energy of the collapse can be transformed into kinetic
</p>
<p>energy of outward motion. Remember that the energy estimated in (36.29) would
</p>
<p>suffice only to bring back the whole collapse to its original position&ndash;and no energy
</p>
<p>would be left for expelling the envelope. But if a remnant (neutron star) of massMn
remains in the condensed state, the energy of its collapse is available. The question
</p>
<p>is how this can be used for accelerating the rest of the material outwards.
</p>
<p>A possible mechanism would be a shock wave moving outwards. The remnant
</p>
<p>is somewhat compressed by inertia beyond its equilibrium state and afterwards,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>466 36 Final Explosions and Collapse
</p>
<p>acting like a spring, it expands, pushing back the infalling matter above. This
</p>
<p>creates a pressure wave, steepening when it travels into regions of lower density.
</p>
<p>The kinetic energy stored in such a wave may be sufficient to lift the envelope into
</p>
<p>space. However, the following problem arises. One can imagine that the neutron star
</p>
<p>formed has a mass of the order of the final Chandrasekhar mass MChF. The rest of
</p>
<p>the collapsing matter still consists mainly of iron. When, after rebounce, this region
</p>
<p>is passed by the shock wave, almost all of its energy is used up to disintegrate the
</p>
<p>iron into free nucleons. Therefore only a small fraction of the initial kinetic energy
</p>
<p>remains in the shock wave and is available for lifting the envelope.
</p>
<p>In fact the major part of the energy estimated in (36.29) of order 1053 erg is
</p>
<p>lost in the form of neutrinos (Sect. 36.3.3). Only 1% of it&ndash;1051 erg&ndash;is actually
</p>
<p>converted into kinetic energy, and only a few per cent of this is escaping from the
</p>
<p>supernova in the form of light. Nevertheless, this tiny part of the collapse energy
</p>
<p>makes supernovae the brightest stellar objects in the universe.
</p>
<p>36.3.3 Effects of Neutrinos
</p>
<p>Before collapse, neutrinos were created by the processes described in Sect. 18.7,
</p>
<p>and their energy is of the order of the thermal energy of the electrons. During
</p>
<p>collapse, neutrino production by neutronization becomes dominant. As soon as
</p>
<p>the density approaches values of 1012 g cm�3, inverse ˇ decay becomes more
pronounced, and the equilibrium shifts to increasingly neutron-rich nuclei. During
</p>
<p>this neutronization neutrinos are released. In connection with supernova SN 1987A,
</p>
<p>neutrinos have been observed in underground neutrino detectors&ndash;manifest evidence
</p>
<p>that core collapse is indeed connected with the supernova phenomenon. The typical
</p>
<p>energy of the neutrinos released during collapse is of the order of the Fermi energy
</p>
<p>of the (relativistic) electrons. Therefore when using the relation % D �enemu and

<p>Obviously we cannot simply assume that the neutrinos escape without interaction.
</p>
<p>The more the density rises, the smaller `� , and the collapsing core becomes opaque
</p>
<p>for neutrinos. Then they can only diffuse through the matter via many scattering
</p>
<p>processes. For sufficiently high density the diffusion velocity becomes even smaller
</p>
<p>than the velocity of the collapse. Calculations show that the neutrinos cannot escape
</p>
<p>by diffusion within the free-fall time �ff of the core if % &amp; 3 � 1011 g cm�3: the
neutrinos are then trapped.
</p>
<p>In the schematic picture of the core structure (Fig. 36.6), the place where
</p>
<p>the infall velocity of matter equals the velocity of outward neutrino diffusion is
</p>
<p>indicated as the &ldquo;neutrino trapping surface&rdquo;. Below it the neutrinos are trapped;
</p>
<p>above it they diffuse outwards until reaching the so-called &ldquo;neutrinosphere&rdquo;. This
</p>
<p>provides the boundary of the opaque part of the core and is located one mean free
</p>
<p>path `� beneath the surface. From here the neutrinos leave the core almost without
</p>
<p>further interaction.
</p>
<p>Detailed calculations have to deal with a radiation-hydro-problem,where one has
</p>
<p>to solve the neutrino transport problem in a six-dimensional phase space, defined by
</p>
<p>three spatial and three momentum coordinates, one of the latter being the neutrino
</p>
<p>energy, for example. In particular one has to consider and calculate the detailed
</p>
<p>distribution function of the neutrinos (rather than their average energy). This is
</p>
<p>obvious since the cross section as given in (36.33) depends on the energy of the
</p>
<p>neutrinos: those with low energy can escape more easily than those of high energy.
</p>
<p>This problem, which is essentially that of solving the Boltzmann equation, requires
</p>
<p>very extensive and challenging computations and has not been solved so far in all
</p>
<p>aspects for realistic physical conditions. Another important aspect is the detailed
</p>
<p>consideration of all neutrino interactions with matter, including neutrino oscillations
</p>
<p>and cross sections for the different neutrino families. The neutrino transport is
</p>
<p>essential for modelling type II supernova explosions as the neutrinos deposit part of</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 36.6 Schematic picture of a collapsing stellar core at bounce. The short arrows correspond
</p>
<p>to the velocity field. At the sphere labelled core shock, the shock is formed. Inside this sphere the
</p>
<p>matter is almost at rest. Above the shock there is a still collapsing shell in which neutrinos are
</p>
<p>trapped. But on top there is a shell from which neutrinos can escape. One can define a neutrino
</p>
<p>photosphere, a neutrinosphere, analogous to the photosphere in a stellar atmosphere
</p>
<p>their energy below the neutrinosphere, possibly raising the energy to levels sufficient
</p>
<p>to expel the envelope.
</p>
<p>The congestion of the neutrinos, resulting from the opaqueness of the core,
</p>
<p>influences the further neutronization. With increasing density the neutrinos become
</p>
<p>degenerate with a high Fermi energy. Electron capture becomes less probable,
</p>
<p>since the new neutrinos have to be raised to the top of the Fermi sea. Around a
</p>
<p>density of 3�1012 g cm�3 the so-called ˇ-equilibrium is reached, where the reaction
pCe� $ nC�e proceeds in both directions. However, the neutrino capture reaction
is also subject to the requirement that the resulting electron has to have an energy
</p>
<p>above the Fermi energy of the degenerate electron gas. In total, with increasing
</p>
<p>density, ˇ-equilibrium shifts to the right-hand side. Since the neutrinos can no
</p>
<p>longer escape, the number of leptons (electrons and neutrinos) stays constant. &#13;ad
has increased to a value close to 4=3, which corresponds to relativistic degeneracy.
</p>
<p>The collapse continues until % &gt; 1014 g cm�3, the nuclear density. At such densities
the equation of state is very stiff, and &#13;ad &amp; 2 due to the repulsive nuclear forces
</p>
<p>of the strong interaction. Therefore the collapse is stopped. Further neutronization
</p>
<p>can proceed only as far as the neutrinos diffuse outwards. This enables further
</p>
<p>electron captures on protons, lowering the proton-to-neutron ratio. Most of this takes
</p>
<p>place in the neutronization shell between trapping surface and neutrino photosphere
</p>
<p>(Fig. 36.6) where the density is several 1011 g cm�3. During this phase, which can

</p>
<p>computations are extremely demanding, require always the latest generation of

<p>core collapse supernova explosions. Some of these simulations have resulted in

<p>We therefore refer the reader to some recent reviews about the subject, given by
</p>
<p>Woosley and Janka (2005), Mezzacappa (2005), and Janka et al. (2007).
</p>
<p>36.3.4 Electron-Capture Supernovae
</p>
<p>While electron capture plays an important role in all core-collapse supernovae, it
</p>
<p>is particularly crucial in the specific case of degenerate NeOMg cores reaching a
</p>
<p>critical density of 4:5 � 109g cm�3, equivalent to a mass of 1:37Mˇ (Nomoto et al.
1984). These conditions are reached, according to the models by Nomoto and others,
</p>
<p>within helium cores slightly less massive than 2:5Mˇ in stars of an initial mass of
about 9Mˇ or somewhat higher, i.e. the super-AGB stars of Sect. 34.8 (see also
Fig. 34.10).
</p>
<p>The core collapse is initiated here by the capture of electrons on 24Mg and 20Ne,
</p>
<p>since this is energetically preferred over keeping the electrons at high energy in
</p>
<p>the Fermi distribution. This reduces pressure, which is mainly provided by the
</p>
<p>degenerate electrons, and contraction sets in. During the ensuing collapse oxygen
</p>
<p>burning starts, but the released nuclear energy is not sufficient to stop the collapse,
</p>
<p>since the energy budget is dominated by the loss due to neutrinos emitted in
</p>
<p>the electron-capture process. The nuclear burning proceeds to nuclear statistical
</p>
<p>equilibrium, which, in the course of the collapse, first shifts to ˛-particles and
</p>
<p>in the final phase to neutrons and protons. The result is a neutron star of low
</p>
<p>mass (. 1:37Mˇ). According to numerical simulations (Kitaura et al. 2006) the
supernova explosion is driven by the neutrino heating mechanism, and comparably
</p>
<p>small amounts of metals, in particular of O, C, and Ni (&lt; 0:015Mˇ), are ejected.
The overall explosion energy is of order 1050 erg, and therefore much lower than in
</p>
<p>type II supernovae from more massive stars. These results agree with properties of
</p>
<p>the Crab supernova remnant and pulsar, and thus this historical supernova is believed
</p>
<p>to be of the electron-capture type. It could therefore be evidence for a previous
</p>
<p>super-AGB evolution. However, the absence of hydrogen in the Crab nebula points
</p>
<p>to a previous binary star evolution.
</p>
<p>36.3.5 Pair-Creation Instability
</p>
<p>From Fig. 36.1 one can see that evolutionary tracks for cores of sufficient mass enter
</p>
<p>a region on the left-hand side of the diagram where also &#13;ad &lt; 4=3 (Fowler and
</p>
<p>Hoyle 1964). In this region many photons have an energy exceeding the rest-mass</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>470 36 Final Explosions and Collapse
</p>
<p>energy of two electrons, h� � 2mec2. Therefore electron-positron pairs can be
spontaneously formed out of photons in the fields of nuclei. Admittedly the pairs
</p>
<p>do annihilate, creating photons again, but there is always an equilibrium number of
</p>
<p>pairs present. The mean energy of the photons h� � kT equals the rest energy of
the electron&ndash;positron pair only at a temperature of 1:2 � 1010K, but even at 109K
appreciable pair creation occurs because of the high-energy photons of the Planck
</p>
<p>distribution.
</p>
<p>For an account of the thermodynamic effects of pair creation, see, for example,
</p>
<p>Weiss et al. (2004). In many respects pair creation can be considered in analogy
</p>
<p>to ionization or dissociation (a photon being &ldquo;ionized&rdquo; or &ldquo;dissociated&rdquo; into a pair
</p>
<p>e�; eC). Regarding the stability of massive cores, the crucial point is that the pair
creation reduces &#13;ad, as incomplete ionization or photodisintegration does. Indeed,
</p>
<p>if the gas is compressed, not all the energy is used to increase the temperature, but
</p>
<p>part of it is used to create pairs. Other reductions of &#13;ad are due to high radiation
</p>
<p>pressure according to (13.7), (13.12) and (13.15) and to relativistic electrons. All
</p>
<p>these effects bring &#13;ad below the critical value 4=3 for dynamical instability.
</p>
<p>The total number of electrons consists of those from pairs and those from normal
</p>
<p>ionization of atoms. With increasing % the Fermi energy rises. This diminishes the
</p>
<p>possibility for pair creation, since newly created electrons now need an energy
</p>
<p>exceeding the Fermi energy. Correspondingly the instability region in Fig. 36.1 is
</p>
<p>limited to the right at a density of 5 � 105 g cm�3.
The pairs created are not relativistic, having &#13;ad D 5=3 (Note that a photon
</p>
<p>with h� D mec2 can only create a pair with zero kinetic energy!). For higher
temperatures there are so many pairs that they dominate and bring &#13;ad of the
</p>
<p>whole gas&ndash;radiation mixture slightly above 4=3, which limits the instability region
</p>
<p>towards high temperatures. In summary, the three effects discussed in the preceding
</p>
<p>paragraphs explain the island nature of the pair-creation instability in Fig. 36.1.
</p>
<p>For the evolution of cores into the region of pair instability, radiation pressure
</p>
<p>is important, and therefore one cannot use our simple formulae of Sect. 36.1.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, for a core instability, it is not sufficient that the evolutionary track
</p>
<p>of the star&rsquo;s centre moves through the area with &#13;ad &lt; 4=3. Since in reality a mean
</p>
<p>value of &#13;ad over the whole core decides upon its dynamical stability (Sect. 40.1),
</p>
<p>an appreciable fraction of the core mass must lie in that density&ndash;temperature range.
</p>
<p>According to numerical results this happens to cores of masses of 40Mcrit and more,
</p>
<p>whereMcrit is defined in (36.5). The corresponding main-sequence masses depend
</p>
<p>on the uncertain mass loss, but a realistic guess seems to be that stars initially
</p>
<p>withM &gt; 80 � 100Mˇ later develop pair-unstable cores. This, however, assumes
that no appreciable mass is lost due to radiation-driven stellar winds during the
</p>
<p>main-sequence phase. In addition, violent radial pulsations by the �-mechanism
</p>
<p>(Sects. 41.1 and 41.5) may lead to a significant mass reduction for stars with
</p>
<p>M &amp; 60Mˇ. Both effects depend on metallicity. Therefore for solar metallicity
models predict a maximum helium core mass of about 10Mˇ, while for metal-free
Pop. III stars, they may exceed the critical value for pair instability. It may be that
</p>
<p>this kind of supernova explosions may be restricted to the very early universe.</p>

<p>36.4 The Supernova-Gamma-Ray-Burst Connection 471
</p>
<p>The final fate of stars this massive is rather uncertain. Numerical calculations
</p>
<p>indicate that, in a collapsing core of this type, oxygen is ignited explosively and the
</p>
<p>core runs into the (unstable) region of photodisintegration, which may cause a total
</p>
<p>disruption of the star. There is also the possibility of violent pulsations caused by the
</p>
<p>instability, which lead to explosive mass loss, but no total disruption. The star may
</p>
<p>thus (for increasing main-sequence mass) end in a black hole after having expelled
</p>
<p>large parts of its hydrogen/helium layers, be totally disrupted, or collapse directly
</p>
<p>into a black hole. The situation and the different outcomes have been summarized
</p>
<p>by Heger et al. (2003).
</p>
<p>We also mention that rotation is playing a crucial role also for the final phases of
</p>
<p>massive star evolution, although the basic effects as discussed in this chapter remain
</p>
<p>the same. Details can be found in the textbook by Maeder (2009).
</p>
<p>36.4 The Supernova-Gamma-Ray-Burst Connection
</p>
<p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short flashes of &#13; -radiation (energies in the range of
</p>
<p>100 keV), which reach us from all directions in the sky and cosmological distances.
</p>
<p>They typically last for several ten seconds, but the total duration varies between
</p>
<p>fractions of a second to minutes. Repetitive events were never reported. The burst
</p>
<p>results from matter accelerated to highly relativistic speeds. The energy of this
</p>
<p>collimated matter jet is converted into radiation by an as yet not fully understood
</p>
<p>mechanism. The energy of the GRB is of the order of 1051 erg, which is the same
</p>
<p>order of magnitude as the kinetical energy of a core collapse supernova.
</p>
<p>GRBs were detected in the 1970s by the military Vela-satellite, and most
</p>
<p>extensively investigated scientifically by the Batse detector on board of theCompton
</p>
<p>Gamma Ray Observatory. The event frequency is a few per day. While the shortest
</p>
<p>GRBs are thought to be the result of the merging of two neutron stars (or that
</p>
<p>of a neutron star with a black hole), the longer lasting type (longer than � 2 s)
has been associated with the core collapse of massive stars, mainly due to the
</p>
<p>association of GRBs with star-forming regions, and the coincidence, both in time
</p>
<p>and place, with SNe of type Ib and Ic. These are core collapse supernovae, which
</p>
<p>lack hydrogen in their spectra. For a review about this evidence, and more details
</p>
<p>about the connection, see Woosley and Bloom (2006).
</p>
<p>Why do a few massive stars create highly collimated jets of matter, being ejected
</p>
<p>at more than 99.9% of the speed of light, while the majority eject their envelopes
</p>
<p>more or less as a spherical shell? The answer is believed to lie in an exceptionally
</p>
<p>high rotation of the precursor&rsquo;s core. For very massive stars (M &gt; 30Mˇ), the
core collapses into a fast-rotating black hole and infalling matter assembles in an
</p>
<p>accretion disk around it (the collapsarmodel). There are several mechanisms under
</p>
<p>discussion, how the binding energy of the disk or the rotation energy of the black
</p>
<p>hole can be converted into the collimated relativistic outflow. Alternatively, GRBs
</p>
<p>may originate from highly magnetized (B � 1�1015 G), fast-rotating neutron stars
with rotation periods of milliseconds, thus rotating almost at breakup speed (the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>472 36 Final Explosions and Collapse
</p>
<p>magnetar model). The rotation energy would be of order 1052 erg, and the spin-
</p>
<p>down luminosity would be of the right order for a GRB.
</p>
<p>The fact that hydrogen is absent in the spectra requires high mass loss rates as for
</p>
<p>Wolf-Rayet stars, but these should not be so high as to reduce the mass too much.
</p>
<p>Since mass loss scales somehow with metallicity, it is expected that GRBs should
</p>
<p>be found mainly in low-metallicity regions, and occur more frequently in the early
</p>
<p>epochs of the universe.
</p>
<p>Although many details are still not understood, it seems to be evident that long-
</p>
<p>durationGRBs are core collapse supernovaewith verymassive progenitors that have
</p>
<p>extremely fast-rotating cores.</p>

<p>Part VIII
</p>
<p>Compact Objects
</p>
<p>Stellar evolution can lead to somewhat extreme final stages. We have seen in
</p>
<p>Chaps. 33 and 35 that the evolution tends to produce central regions of very high
</p>
<p>density. On the other hand it is known that stellar matter can be ejected (see
</p>
<p>Chap. 34). The mechanisms are only partly (if at all) understood, but they do
</p>
<p>exist according to observations (normal mass loss, planetary nebulae, explosions).
</p>
<p>It may be that in certain cases the whole star explodes without any remnant left (see
</p>
<p>Chap. 36). Often enough, however, only the widely expanded envelope is removed,
</p>
<p>leaving the condensed core as a compact object. Relative to &ldquo;normal stars&rdquo; these
</p>
<p>objects are characterized by small radii, high densities, and strong surface gravity.
</p>
<p>There are three types of compact objects, distinguished by the &ldquo;degree of
</p>
<p>compactness&rdquo;: white dwarfs (WD), neutron stars (NS), and black holes (BH).
</p>
<p>Typical values for WD are R � 10�2Rˇ; % � 106 g cm�3, escape velocity
vE � 0:02c; their configuration is supported against the large gravity by the pressure
of highly degenerate electrons (instead of the &ldquo;thermal pressure&rdquo;, which dominates
</p>
<p>in the case of normal stars). For NS one has typicallyR � 10 km, % � 1014 g cm�3,
vE � c=3; their pressure support is provided by densely packed, partially degenerate
neutrons. This is the dominant species of particles since normal nuclei do not exist
</p>
<p>above a certain density. Indeed a NS represents very roughly a huge &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo; of
</p>
<p>1057 baryons.
</p>
<p>As a simple illustration, suppose that in both cases (WD and NS) ideal, non-
</p>
<p>relativistic degenerate fermions (of mass me or mn/ provide the pressure balancing
</p>
<p>the gravity. The stars then are polytropes of index n D 3=2. With a mass-radius
relation (19.28), where the constant of proportionality can be seen to be � K �
1=mfermion, we have R � 1=mfermion. The ratio of mn to me then provides the ratio
of typical radii for WD and NS of the same mass. The pressure&ndash;gravity balance by
</p>
<p>degenerate neutrons can only be maintained up to limiting masses corresponding to
</p>
<p>about 2 � 1057 fermions.
Clearly for objects with gravity fields like those in NS general relativity becomes
</p>
<p>important. It will be the dominant feature for the last group of compact objects,
</p>
<p>namely BH with R � 1 km and vE D c:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>474 VIII Compact Objects
</p>
<p>The first WD was detected long before theoreticians were able to explain it,
</p>
<p>whereas NS were predicted theoretically before they were, accidentally, discovered
</p>
<p>in the sky. Today, also the existence of BH is proven beyond doubt.
</p>
<p>The physics of compact objects is interesting and complex enough to fill special
</p>
<p>textbooks (e.g., Shapiro and Teukolsky 1983). We refer to these for details and limit
</p>
<p>ourselves to indicating a few main characteristics.</p>

</p>
<p>White Dwarfs
</p>
<p>It is characteristic for configurations involving degenerate matter that mechanical
</p>
<p>and thermal properties are more or less decoupled from each other. Correspondingly
</p>
<p>we will discuss these two aspects separately. When dealing with the mechanical
</p>
<p>problem (including the P and % stratification, theM &ndash;R relation, etc.) one may even
</p>
<p>go to the limit T ! 0. Of course, such cold matter cannot radiate at all and it is
more appropriate to denote these objects as &ldquo;black dwarfs&rdquo;. The thermal properties,
</p>
<p>on the other hand, are responsible for the radiation and the further evolution of white
</p>
<p>dwarfs. The evolution indeed leads from a white dwarf (WD) to a black dwarf, since
</p>
<p>it is&ndash;roughly speaking&ndash;the consumption of fossil heat stored in the WD which we
</p>
<p>see at present (Concerning the evolution to the white-dwarf stage see Chaps. 34&ndash;
</p>
<p>36, and for a much deeper and more detailed review of properties of white dwarfs,
</p>
<p>Althaus et al. 2010b).
</p>
<p>37.1 Chandrasekhar&rsquo;s Theory
</p>
<p>This theory treats the mechanical structure of WD under the following assumptions.
</p>
<p>The pressure is produced only by the ideal (non-interacting) degenerate electrons,
</p>
<p>while the non-degenerate ions provide the mass. The electrons are supposed to be
</p>
<p>fully degenerate, but they may have an arbitrary degree of relativity x D pF=mec;
which varies as %1=3. Therefore we no longer have a polytrope as we had in the
</p>
<p>limiting cases x ! 0 and x ! 1. The equation of state can be written as
</p>
<p>P D C1f .x/ ; % D C2x3 I x D pF=mec ; (37.1)
</p>
<p>according to (15.13) and (15.15), which also define the constants C1 and C2, while
</p>
<p>(15.14) gives f .x/.
</p>
<p>In order to describe hydrostatic stratification we start with Poisson&rsquo;s equation
</p>
<p>(19.2), in which we eliminate d˚=dr by (19.1) and substitute P and % from (37.1)

f D 1. If we now slightly increase M , then f &gt; 1 (gravity exceeds the pressure
force), and R must decrease in order to regain equilibrium (f D 1). This explains
the structure of the R&ndash;M relation (cf. Fig. 37.1).
</p>
<p>However, if the electrons are relativistic (&#13; D 4=3), then f is independent of
R. Equilibrium can be achieved only by adjusting M to a certain value MCh. If
</p>
<p>M &lt; MCh, then f &lt; 1, i.e. the dominant pressure term makes the star expand. This
</p>
<p>makes the electrons less relativistic and increases &#13; above the critical value 4/3. For
</p>
<p>M &gt; MCh; f &gt; 1, and the dominant gravity term makes the star contract; but this
</p>
<p>does not help either, and the star must collapse without finding an equilibrium. So
</p>
<p>MCh is quite obviously a mass limit for these equilibrium configurations. This mass
</p>
<p>limit again depends on �e, with a power of 4=3 [cf. (15.26) and (19.30)].
</p>
<p>37.2 The Corrected Mechanical Structure
</p>
<p>The admirable lucidity of the theory of Sect. 37.1 is based completely on the
</p>
<p>simplicity of the equation of state for an ideal, fully degenerate electron gas used
</p>
<p>there [cf. (37.1)]. It certainly requires corrections near both ends of the mass
</p>
<p>range. For cold (or nearly cold) configurations of M ! 0 we should get the
behaviour R ! 0; % � constant as for planets (or even smaller spheres) instead
of R ! 1; % ! 0 (as we have already explained above). At least there should
be the possibility for a smooth transition to the planets, which in this connection
</p>
<p>can well be considered cold bodies. The corrections to be applied here are due to
</p>
<p>the electrostatic interaction. Near the limiting mass, on the other hand, we have
</p>
<p>encountered very high densities, with the simple theory yielding % ! 1 for
M ! MCh. In this domain we have to allow for effects of the weak interaction
(inverse ˇ decay) and the possibility of pycnonuclear reactions. Some influences on
</p>
<p>the equation of state have already been indicated in Chaps. 4 and 5.</p>

<p>37.2.1 Crystallization
</p>
<p>Let us first treat the main effects of electrostatic interaction in a cold plasma with
</p>
<p>nuclei of type .Z;A/ and electrons of density ne. We have seen in Sect. 16.4 that
</p>
<p>matter in WD can be crystallized, and we will come back later to the condition for
</p>
<p>this. Let us suppose that the ions form a regular lattice and the electrons are evenly
</p>
<p>distributed. For the density encountered in WD the Wigner&ndash;Seitz approximation is
</p>
<p>not too bad, and so we divide the lattice into neutral Wigner&ndash;Seitz spheres of radius
</p>
<p>R0 D Z1=3rea0 (re = average separation of the electrons in units of the Bohr radius
a0). Each sphere contains one ion (point chargeCZ in the centre) andZ electrons (a
uniformly distributed charge �Z/. In order to find the Coulomb energy ZEC of the
sphere we take concentric shells of radius y and charge�3Zey2dy=R03 and remove
them to infinity, thereby overcoming the potential difference Ze.1 � y3=R03/. An
integration over the whole sphere gives the energy per electron as

<p>concentration of all positive charges into the nucleus, while the negative charges
</p>
<p>are much more uniformly distributed. The average electron&ndash;electron distance is
</p>
<p>thus larger than the average electron&ndash;nucleus distance, and the repulsion is smaller
</p>
<p>than the attraction. A few calculated values of the ratio P=P0 for different Z and
</p>
<p>relativity parameter x are given in Table 37.2. As expected the reduction of P
</p>
<p>increases with the charge Z and with decreasing % (decreasing Fermi energy).
</p>
<p>It will therefore be the dominant correction at small M , providing there the
</p>
<p>described reduction of R. The above approximation breaks down, of course, when
</p>
<p>it yields P . 0.
</p>
<p>Apart frommodifying the pressure, crystallization has an additional effect, which
</p>
<p>changes the chemical structure and therefore the run of pressure and density, too.
</p>
<p>This effect is chemical or phase separation and is due to the fact that different
</p>
<p>elements cannot coexist in arbitrary amounts in the solid phase. After the previous
</p>
<p>evolution most low- and intermediate-mass stars end as CO white dwarfs, with an
</p>
<p>almost flat chemical profile in the centre (Fig. 37.2). When crystallization occurs,
</p>
<p>the phase transition for the first (the lighter) element requires a lower abundance of
</p>
<p>this element in the solid phase than in the liquid (or gas) phase. The excess amount
</p>
<p>of this element (carbon in our example) will flow up to the liquid phase, above the
</p>
<p>crystallization boundary, creating there a local density inversion. This is the case,
</p>
<p>because even further away from the solid core there is the original abundance of
</p>
<p>the lighter element, and since this is now lower than in the region just above the
</p>
<p>crystallized core, the average molecular weight is higher. This induces convection,
</p>
<p>redistributing the elements in the liquid phase. Of course, with the local changes
</p>
<p>in the lighter element abundance connected is one in the abundance of the heavier
</p>
<p>element (oxygen). This effect is now continuing with decreasing temperature and
</p>
<p>a growing solid core (It can be understood in greater detail with the help of phase
</p>
<p>diagrams, as done in the textbook by Salaris and Cassisi (2005, Chap. 7)). The result
</p>
<p>is a modification of the chemical and therefore mechanical structure of the white
</p>
<p>dwarf, and a rather smooth, monotonic run of element abundances, as can be seen
</p>
<p>in Fig. 37.2, which shows the abundances for carbon and oxygen in a white dwarf

<p>37.2.2 Pycnonuclear Reactions
</p>
<p>In this and the following (Sect. 37.2.3) we will encounter two types of nuclear
</p>
<p>reactions which occur at very high densities and which lead to a change of the
</p>
<p>chemical composition without thermonuclear reactions. Though they are believed
</p>
<p>to be quite irrelevant for most white dwarfs, except maybe for the densest and
</p>
<p>coolest ones, they are of principal interest, as they may lead&ndash;in the extreme&ndash;to
</p>
<p>a composition defined by nuclear equilibrium (Sect. 37.2.4). Such effects will be
</p>
<p>important for neutron stars (Sect. 38).
</p>
<p>For the very high densities occurring near the upper end of the mass range,
</p>
<p>pycnonuclear reactions have to be considered (cf. Sect. 18.4). These were defined
</p>
<p>as nuclear reactions which depend mainly on % (instead of T , as in the case of
</p>
<p>thermonuclear reactions). They can occur even at T ! 0 as a consequence of
the small oscillations of the nuclei in the lattice with energy Ezp, combined with
</p>
<p>the tunnel effect. Reactions set in rather abruptly at a certain density limit %pyc
and use up all fuel within a short time (say 105 years) once % &amp; %pyc. The
</p>
<p>limits %pyc for the different reactions are not well known, since the relevant cross
</p>
<p>sections are very uncertain. The values of %pyc increase towards heavier elements;
</p>
<p>the orders of magnitude are %pyc � 106, 109, and 1010 g cm�3 for burning of 1H,
4He, and 12C, respectively. Central densities of white dwarfs may reach values up
</p>
<p>to % � 106 � 109g cm�3. However, hydrogen white dwarfs do not exist due to the
previous stellar evolution, and He and CO white dwarfs reach the critical densities</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>37.2 The Corrected Mechanical Structure 483
</p>
<p>for the respective burning by pycnonuclear reactions only in very extreme cases. In
</p>
<p>general, therefore, the composition and structure of white dwarfs is not affected by
</p>
<p>this kind of nuclear reactions.
</p>
<p>37.2.3 Inverse ˇ Decays
</p>
<p>Inverse ˇ decay also becomes important at high densities. Consider a nucleus
</p>
<p>(Z � 1;A) which is ˇ-unstable and decays under normal conditions to the stable
nucleus .Z;A/C e� C N� (we always drop the subscript &ldquo;e&rdquo; for the neutrinos), the
decay energy being Ed . If .Z;A/ is surrounded by a degenerate electron gas with a
</p>
<p>kinetic energy at the Fermi border
</p>
<p>EF D mec2Œ.1C x2/1=2 � 1&#141; ; (37.23)
</p>
<p>such that EF &gt; Ed, then .Z;A/ becomes unstable against electron capture, i.e. we
</p>
<p>have the inverse ˇ decay
</p>
<p>.Z;A/C e� ! .Z � 1;A/C � : (37.24)
</p>
<p>In general, we have to deal with the particularly stable even&ndash;even nuclei .Z;A/
</p>
<p>and then Ed.Z � 1;A/ &lt; Ed.Z;A/. If EF &gt; Ed.Z;A/, then also EF &gt;
Ed.Z � 1;A/; and the inverse ˇ decay proceeds further to .Z � 2;A/. The new
nuclei are now stabilized by the Fermi sea, i.e. they cannot eject an electron with
</p>
<p>Ed.&lt; EF/, since it would not find a free place in phase space. EF increases with %.
</p>
<p>Therefore for each type of nucleus .Z;A/ there is a threshold %n of the density above
</p>
<p>which neutronization occurs. For 1H and 4He (%n D 1:2�107 and 1:4�1011 g cm�3/
this is of no interest, since clearly %n � %pyc such that pycnonuclear burning would
set in before neutronization can occur. And even for the decay 12C ! 12B ! 12Be
one still has %n D 3:9 � 1010 g cm�3 &gt; %pyc, but the order of critical densities is
reversed for heavy nuclei. The decay 56Fe !56 Mn !56Cr, for example, has a
threshold %n D 1:14 � 109 g cm�3 &lt; %pyc. Although neither inverse ˇ decays nor
pycnonuclear reactions are important processes that might change a white dwarf&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>chemical composition, which is the result of the evolution of its stellar predecessor,
</p>
<p>they demonstrate that for high densities, the outcome of the thermonuclear processes
</p>
<p>occurring during a star&rsquo;s life might be changed in its remnant and that the structure
</p>
<p>might be determined by the density and the energy of the Fermi sea of degenerate
</p>
<p>electrons.
</p>
<p>37.2.4 Nuclear Equilibrium
</p>
<p>In &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stars we were used to imposing the chemical composition as an
</p>
<p>arbitrary free parameter. This was reasonable, since the usual transformation
</p>
<p>of the elements by thermonuclear reactions takes a sufficiently long time, and
</p>
<p>configurations with a momentary (non-equilibrium) composition are astronomically</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>484 37 White Dwarfs
</p>
<p>relevant. This may be different for very high densities, at which processes such as
</p>
<p>pycnonuclear reactions or inverse ˇ decay can transform the nuclei in relatively
</p>
<p>short timescales. The other extreme, then, is to impose only the baryon number
</p>
<p>per volume and ask for the corresponding equilibrium composition. In reality the
</p>
<p>approach to nuclear equilibrium may be too slow to be accomplished. But one
</p>
<p>can imagine having reached it after an artificial acceleration by suitable catalysts,
</p>
<p>leading to the expression &ldquo;cold catalysed matter&rdquo;. Because of their history, WD will
</p>
<p>scarcely have reached that stage of equilibrium (they usually consist of 4He, or 12C
</p>
<p>and 16O, instead of 56Fe, etc.). But in order to see the connection between different
</p>
<p>types of objects, we briefly describe a few characteristics of equilibrium matter.
</p>
<p>The equilibrium composition can be found by starting with a certain type of
</p>
<p>nucleus .Z;A/ and varying Z and A until the minimum of energy is obtained. For
</p>
<p>isolated nuclei the counteraction of attracting nuclear and repelling Coulomb forces
</p>
<p>gives a maximumbinding of the nucleons at 56Fe (cf. Sect. 18.1). Therefore 56Fe will
</p>
<p>be the equilibrium composition for small % .&lt;8�106 g cm�3/. With increasing % this
balance is shifted to heavier and neutron-enriched nuclei, since replacing a proton by
</p>
<p>a neutron decreases the repulsive Coulomb force inside the nucleus; and the ˇ decay,
</p>
<p>which would then result in isolated nuclei, is here prohibited by the filled Fermi
</p>
<p>sea of the surrounding electrons. Another influence comes from the lattice energy
</p>
<p>(37.19), which gives only a small correction to P at high %, but reduces the Coulomb
</p>
<p>energy at the surface of the nucleus. The sequence of equilibrium nuclei is (the
</p>
<p>maximum density in g cm�3 is shown in parenthesis): 56Fe.8�106/, 62Ni.2:8�108/,
64Ni.1:3 � 109/; : : : ;120Sr.3:6 � 1011/, 122Sr.3:8 � 1011/, 118Kr.4:4 � 1011/. For
% &gt; 4 � 1011 g cm�3 it is energetically more favourable that further neutrons are
free rather than bound in the nucleus: the &ldquo;neutron drip&rdquo; sets in. The composition
</p>
<p>consists of two phases: the lattice of nuclei (with sufficient electrons for neutrality)
</p>
<p>plus free neutrons. Their number increases with %, and at % � 4 � 1012 g cm�3
their pressure Pn even exceeds Pe. At 2 � 1014 g cm�3, the nuclei are dissolved,
leaving a degenerate neutron gas with a small admixture of protons and electrons
</p>
<p>(see Sect. 38.1). The P � % relation can be calculated, giving the equation of state
as shown in Fig. 16.2.
</p>
<p>Once an equation of state is given, one can easily integrate the mechanical
</p>
<p>equations outwards, starting from a variety of values for the central pressure which
</p>
<p>leads to a pair of valuesM;R. TheM &ndash;R relations obtained in this way by Hamada
</p>
<p>and Salpeter (1961) are plotted as solid curves in Fig. 37.3 for different compositions
</p>
<p>(He, C, Mg, Fe, and equilibrium composition). For comparison the relations for an
</p>
<p>ideal Fermi gas (Chandrasekhar&rsquo;s theory) are plotted for �e D 2 (e.g. 4He, 12C,
24Mg) and �e D 2:15 (56Fe); in the latter case, the mass limit is already lowered
to MCh � 1:25Mˇ. Relative to these classical models there is a clear reduction
of R, particularly at small M , owing to the Coulomb interaction reducing P . This
</p>
<p>effect increases with Z. The curve for 56Fe shows a maximum of R beyond which
</p>
<p>it decreases forM ! 0. In fact such a maximum of R (�0:02; 0:05; 0:12ˇ for Fe,
He, H, respectively) occurs for all compositions at values ofM between a few 10�3
</p>
<p>to 10�2Mˇ. In this regime the equation of state is not well known; it is certainly
completely dominated by Coulomb effects, and the inhomogeneous distribution of</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>R � 0:1Rˇ andM � 10�3Mˇ is not far from this border; in fact its radius is far
aboveRmax for He and close to that of H, so that it must consist essentially of H.).
</p>
<p>Towards large M the curves for C, Mg, and Fe show kinks at the mass limit.
</p>
<p>These are due to a phase transition in the centre, since %c reaches one of the limits
</p>
<p>described above. For 12C we find here %c D %pyc, and pycnonuclear reactions then
transform 12C ! 24Mg, which by inverse ˇ decay becomes 24Ne. Models on the
lower branch beyond the kink consist of Ne cores and C envelopes. The curve for
24Mg reaches Mmax when %c D %n, and inverse ˇ decay gives central cores of
24Ne. For 56Fe we see the result of the inverse ˇ decay to 56Cr atMmax and to
</p>
<p>56Ti
</p>
<p>at the following second kink (beyond which the models consist of 56Ti cores, 56Cr
</p>
<p>shells, and 56Fe envelopes). The curve for equilibrium composition, which coincides
</p>
<p>with 56Fe for % . 8 � 106 g cm�3, is below and to the left of all other curves;
it always has the largest average �e. At the maximum M.� 1:0Mˇ/ one finds
%c � 2 � 109 g cm�3, with 66Ni nuclei giving a relatively large �e. Towards the
end of the plotted equilibrium curve, 120Kr is reached and the first neutrons are

<p>freed (From here follows the sequence of equilibrium configurations which leads
</p>
<p>to neutron stars, see Chap. 38.). The whole curve appears fairly smooth, since the

<p>486 37 White Dwarfs
</p>
<p>Fig. 37.4 R&ndash;M relation obtained from numerical white dwarf models. For comparison, the
</p>
<p>relations by Hamada and Salpeter (1961) for white dwarfs consisting of pure He, C, or Fe are
</p>
<p>repeated (black lines, indicated by &ldquo;HS&rdquo; following the element label). The numerical results were
</p>
<p>obtained for white dwarfs with an effective temperature of 4,000&ndash;5,000K. These are the shorter
</p>
<p>grey lines with the same line style as the HS-curves. The computations were restricted to a narrow
</p>
<p>mass range resulting from realistic previous stellar evolution models. The dashed black line with
</p>
<p>the label &ldquo;He .Teff D 2� 104/&rdquo; is for a white dwarf with this effective temperature (data courtesy
L. Althaus, after Panei et al. 2000)
</p>
<p>while the transit of a non-catalysed composition to equilibrium is first delayed by
</p>
<p>large thresholds and then occurs in a big jump.
</p>
<p>Concerning inhomogeneous models of WD with non-equilibrium composition,
</p>
<p>we briefly mention the case of a low-mass envelope of light elements (particularly
1H) being placed on a WD of 4He or 12C and 16O. This may happen by mass
</p>
<p>exchange in close binary systems. Aside from possible instabilities during the onset
</p>
<p>of nuclear burning (which can lead to the ejection of a nova shell), there is a
</p>
<p>strong influence on the equilibrium radius described by d lgR=d lgMH of the order
</p>
<p>10 : : : 102. This means that the addition of a 1H envelope of only 1% ofM increases
</p>
<p>R by about 50% and more. In fact the white dwarf will scarcely be recognizable as
</p>
<p>such. Although WD originating purely from single star evolution will also have
</p>
<p>envelopes of lighter elements, these are typically at least two orders of magnitude
</p>
<p>less massive, and the radius increase is correspondingly less drastic.
</p>
<p>The M&ndash;R relation by Hamada and Salpeter (1961) shown in Fig. 37.3 is in
</p>
<p>fact a very good approximation for old white dwarfs with very cold (effective)
</p>
<p>temperatures, as Fig. 37.4 demonstrates. Here we compare the Hamada and Salpter
</p>
<p>relations with those obtained from full numerical models for white dwarfs with pure
</p>
<p>He, C, or Fe cores, and He&ndash;He envelopes, except for the He-WDs, which have a
</p>
<p>pure H envelope. The envelope masses range from 3 � 10�4Mˇ for the He-WDs</p>

</p>
<p>to 10�2Mˇ for the others. Another He-WD sequence obtained from models with
a much higher Teff of 2 � 104K demonstrates how white dwarfs initially have
much larger radii but approach the cold configurations during the cooling process.
</p>
<p>Based on mass and radius determinations of observed objects, the existence of white
</p>
<p>dwarfs with iron cores is sometimes claimed. So far, however, corrections to the
</p>
<p>radius shifted all objects back to the CO- or He-WD sequence. Such objects would
</p>
<p>indeed be a challenge to stellar evolution theory (cf. Chaps. 34 and 35).
</p>
<p>Once L and Teff of a white dwarf have been determined accurately enough,
</p>
<p>the Stefan-Boltzmann law (11.14) yields the radius. The mass&ndash;radius relation
</p>
<p>then delivers the mass of the white dwarf. This is the basis for the initial&ndash;final
</p>
<p>mass relation (Fig. 34.7). However, it depends on the assumption about the core
</p>
<p>composition of the white dwarf. In most cases, one can safely assume a CO-WD, as
</p>
<p>this is, at the present age of the universe, the most likely.

<p>The connection with other types of configurations is seen in Fig. 38.3, which

<p>gives theM &ndash;R relation for cold catalysed matter (equilibrium composition). When
</p>
<p>going along the curve in the direction of increasing %c, one encounters extrema of

<p>M (open circles) in which the stability properties change. An example is the point

models follows (see the discussion of Sect. 38.2).
</p>
<p>37.3 Thermal Properties and Evolution of White Dwarfs
</p>
<p>In the very interior of a WD, the degenerate electrons provide a high thermal
</p>
<p>conductivity. This, together with the small L, does not allow large temperature
</p>
<p>gradients. The situation is different when going to the outermost layers. With
</p>
<p>decreasing % the matter is less and less degenerate, and the dominant heat transfer
</p>
<p>becomes that by radiation (or convection), which is much less effective. Therefore
</p>
<p>we expect to find a non-degenerate outer layer in which T can drop appreciably and
</p>
<p>which isolates the degenerate, isothermal interior from outer space.
</p>
<p>We simplify matters by assuming a discontinuous transition from degeneracy to
</p>
<p>non-degeneracy (ideal gas) at a certain point (subscript 0). For the envelope we use
</p>
<p>the radiative solution (11.25) for a Kramers opacity (� D �0PT �4:5/ and a zero

<p>(The numerical factor is given for � D 4=3;r D 0:4:) The relative radial extension
of the non-degenerate envelope then is typically 1% or less, i.e. a few 10km, since
</p>
<p>R � 10�2Rˇ and M � 1Mˇ. This means that the radius of a WD is well
approximated by the integrations which assume complete degeneracy throughout,

</p>
<p>such that the observed L � 10�3Lˇ allows only XH . 2 � 10�4. Stability
considerations (Sect. 25.3.5) indeed rule out that the luminosity of normal WD is
</p>
<p>generated by thermonuclear reactions, which was first pointed out byMestel (1952).
</p>
<p>A stable burning could only be expected in nearly cold configurations that produce
</p>
<p>their extremely smallL (&ldquo;black&rdquo; or &ldquo;brown&rdquo; dwarfs) by pycnonuclear reactions near
</p>
<p>T D 0.
If there are no thermonuclear reactions, then which reservoirs of energy are
</p>
<p>involved when a normal WD loses energy by radiation? The means for obtaining
</p>
<p>the answer are provided in Sect. 3.1. For a configuration in hydrostatic equilibrium
</p>
<p>the virial theorem (3.9) requires � PEi C PEg D 0.
The potential energy in the gravitational field Eg.&lt; 0/ is given by (3.3). The
</p>
<p>total internal energy of the star Ei D Ee C Eion consists of the contributions from
electrons and ions. By � we mean an average of the quantity � 0, defined by the
relation
</p>
<p>� 0u D 3P
%
; (37.32)
</p>
<p>where u is the internal energy per unit mass. For highly degenerate electrons, � 0
</p>
<p>varies from � 0 D 2 (non-relativistic) to � 0 D 1 (relativistic case). For the ions,
� 0 D 2 if they are an ideal gas [cf. (3.5)]. If there is crystallization, the contributions
uC of Coulomb energy and up of lattice oscillations (phonons) have to be considered.
</p>
<p>For the static Coulomb part we note that uC D neEC=%, with EC � %1=3 according
to (37.19). Then one finds from (37.22) that PC=% D uC=3, i.e. � 0 D 1. The situation
is more difficult with up, but this contributes relatively little.
</p>
<p>Summing up all effects, the average over the whole WD will obviously be
</p>
<p>somewhere in the range 1 &lt; � &lt; 2. As in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stars we have a simple relation
</p>
<p>between Ei and Eg; the absolute values of both being of the same order.
</p>
<p>The total energy isW D EiCEg. The energy equation requiresL D � PW , which
together with the virial theorem [compare with (3.12)]
</p>
<p>L D � PW D �� � 1
�
</p>
<p>PEg D .� � 1/ PEi : (37.33)
</p>
<p>Therefore L &gt; 0 requires a contraction . PEg &lt; 0/ and an increase of the internal
energy . PEi &gt; 0/. So far, it is the same as with normal, non-degenerate stars. The
crucial question is how Ei is distributed between electrons (Ee) and ions (Eion).
</p>
<p>We recall the situation for a normal star with both electrons and ions being non-
</p>
<p>degenerate. Then there is equipartition with Eion � Ee � T , such that also Ei D
Eion C Ee � T I PEi &gt; 0 means PT &gt; 0. Thus the loss of energy (L &gt; 0) leads to
a heating ( PT &gt; 0). This was expressed in Sect. 25.3.4 by saying that the star has
negative gravothermal specific heat, c� &lt; 0.
</p>
<p>For demonstrating the behaviour of a WD, let us simply assume that the electrons
</p>
<p>are non-relativistic degenerate and the ions form an ideal gas. Then � D 2 and
L D � PEg=2, i.e. the star must contract, releasing twice the energy lost by radiation.
Since &ndash;Eg � 1=R � %1=3, we have PEg=Eg D .1=3/ P%=% (Here % is some average</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>490 37 White Dwarfs
</p>
<p>value.). The compression, however, increases the Fermi energyEF of the electrons.
</p>
<p>Their internal energy is Ee � EF � p2F � %2=3, such that PEe=Ee D .2=3/ P%=%. So
we have a simple relation between PEg and PEe:
</p>
<p>PEe � 2
Ee
</p>
<p>Eg
PEg D �
</p>
<p>Ee
</p>
<p>Ei
PEg : (37.34)
</p>
<p>Here Ei is introduced via the virial theorem in the form Eg D �2Ei.
If the WD is already cool, then Eion � Ee and Ei D Eion C Ee � Ee. This
</p>
<p>means PEe � � PEg D 2L, and nearly as much energy as released by contraction is
used up by raising the Fermi energy of the electrons. With PEe � � PEg, the energy
balance L D � PEion � PEe � PEg becomes
</p>
<p>L � � PEion � � PT : (37.35)
</p>
<p>Therefore, the ions release about as much energy by cooling as the WD loses by
</p>
<p>radiation. The contraction is then seen to be the consequence of the decreasing ion
</p>
<p>pressure (even though Pion is only a small part of P ). In spite of the decreasing ion
</p>
<p>energy, the whole internal energy rises, since PEion C PEe � L. This evolution tends
finally to a cold black dwarf; then the contraction has stopped and all of the internal
</p>
<p>energy is in the form of Fermi energy.
</p>
<p>Of course, the relations just derived should have somewhat different numerical
</p>
<p>factors, since � is not exactly 2 (a certain degree of relativity in the central part, the
</p>
<p>ion gas not being ideal, etc.). But the essence of the story remains the same.
</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion opens the possibility of arriving at a very simple theory
</p>
<p>of the cooling of WD. We start with the energy equation (4.48), setting there

already that some very cool WDs are remnants of the earliest phases of galactic

</p>
<p>1976; Isern et al. 1997).
</p>
<p>The properties of the ions depend critically on two dimensionless quantities, �c

<p>in (16.25). For �c � 102 a heated crystal will melt (or a cooling plasma will

<p>shell hydrogen burning
</p>
<p>(LCNO) is still important, after

<p>which neutrino emission (L� )
</p>
<p>is the dominant channel of

<p>crystallization. In this model
</p>
<p>helium burning (LHe) never is
</p>
<p>an important energy source
</p>
<p>(Data courtesy L. Althaus)
</p>
<p>These large variations of Cv (increase by a factor 2, then decrease to zero) of
</p>
<p>course influence the cooling times [cf. (37.42)]. In addition there is the release of the
</p>
<p>latent heat of about kT per ion when the material crystallizes, which delays cooling.
</p>
<p>Additional energy is delivered by the phase separation (Sect. 37.2.1), which is due to
</p>
<p>the (so far neglected) dependence of the specific entropy s on chemical composition
</p>
<p>(4.7). Compared to the approximativeMestel cooling law (37.42), cooling times can
</p>
<p>be longer by up to several 10% by these effects, which are more important when
</p>
<p>crystallization sets in at lower luminosity, because the delay is simply the extra
</p>
<p>energy divided by the luminosity. This is the case for less massive WDs, because
</p>
<p>they are less dense and reach the critical �c � 170 only at lower T , thus lower L.
Further improvements in the theory of WD cooling result from a realistic and
</p>
<p>more accurate treatment of the equation of state, and the transport of energy within
</p>
<p>the degenerate interior and through the non-degenerate envelope by conduction,
</p>
<p>radiation, and convection. Obviously, the mass of the envelope and its composition
</p>
<p>have an influence on the cooling time. Both depend on the pre-WD evolution,
</p>
<p>in particular, therefore, on the physics of mass loss and mixing on and after the
</p>
<p>AGB phase. Generally, envelope masses between 10�4 and 0:01Mˇ are obtained
for the beginning of the WD cooling phase, but later, empirical evidence from the
</p>
<p>seismology of pulsating WDs (Sect. 42.4), indicates envelope masses well below
</p>
<p>these numbers, with an average around 10�7Mˇ. The less massive the envelope,
and the less hydrogen it contains, the more transparent it is for radiative losses,
</p>
<p>allowing a faster cooling of the WD.
</p>
<p>Convection in the envelope may eventually reach into the core, and thereby
</p>
<p>the convergence of the temperature profile of the envelope to that of the outer

<p>core boundary (Sect. 11.3.3) is lost (The solution (37.25) assumes purely radiative

<p>sinks of energy&ndash;nuclear reactions, neutrino emission, gravothermal energy, and
</p>
<p>crystallization&ndash;have to be included, which are important at various phases of the
</p>
<p>WD cooling. We conclude this discussion with Fig. 37.6, which shows the cooling
</p>
<p>function of a 0:61Mˇ CO white dwarf, resulting from a full evolutionary sequence,
starting on the main sequence with an initial mass of 2Mˇ and a metallicity of
Z D 0:01. The figure shows the various contributions of energy sources and sinks.
</p>
<p>In the earliest phase, lasting only a few thousand years, the total photon lumi-
</p>
<p>nosity L emerging from the surface is provided completely by hydrogen burning
</p>
<p>from the CNO-cycles (pp-chains are at all times almost irrelevant). Gravothermal
</p>
<p>energies (Lg) balance the loss by neutrinos (L�). Then, the hydrogen shell is
</p>
<p>extinguishing rapidly, and the WD begins to cool and to get fainter. After a few
</p>
<p>105 years neutrino losses become more important than photon emission for the
</p>
<p>cooling, and the energy results almost completely from gravothermal energies, being
</p>
<p>gained from the internal energy of the core. At t � 107 years, the neutrino sink fades
away, and the WD is now in the phase where the Mestel theory applies, and the
</p>
<p>thermal energy of the ions is the only energy source. Crystallization and convection
</p>
<p>in the envelope have not yet set it. This happens only after almost 109 years. This

<p>final phase of cooling is the one shown in Fig. 37.7.
</p>
<p>It is possible to connect the cooling times with the observed number of WD as

<p>Sky Survey, data release 3 (Abazajian et al. 2005), including error bars of the star countings, which
</p>
<p>are significant after the peak of the luminosity function, due to the extreme faintness of the objects.
</p>
<p>The last few data points at and after the break of the luminosity function also depend somewhat on
</p>
<p>the assumption about the interior carbon and oxygen abundances. The break at Mbol D 15:3, or
equivalently logL=Lˇ D �4:3, could correspond to an age of the coolest WDs of 8 Gyr, or be
a few Gyr higher (Kilic et al. 2010, and Salaris, private communication). Data for this figure were
</p>
<p>taken from Harris et al. 2006; Fig. 7
</p>
<p>lower luminosity. Then, the luminosity function (as the one in Fig. 37.8) should
</p>
<p>show a cut-off, and the maximum age reached indicates the age of the oldest white
</p>
<p>dwarfs and thus the oldest stars in the observed sample. With this method one could
</p>
<p>first determine the age of the galactic disk in the solar neighbourhood (found to be
</p>
<p>around 8 Gyr), and more recently that of old stellar clusters. TheWD cooling curves
</p>
<p>provide an alternative way to find out about the oldest objects in our galaxy.
</p>
<p>As discussed above, such age determinations depend on the white dwarf models
</p>
<p>used. In particular, and apart from the physics of cooling, it requires an assumption
</p>
<p>about the internal chemical composition of the WD. In case of WDs originating
</p>
<p>from single stars, it will be safe to assume a CO-WD with a He/H envelope. The
</p>
<p>arguments for this assumption are that ONeMg-WDs are very rare&ndash;if they are the
</p>
<p>result of single star evolution at all&ndash;because of the narrowmass range of super-AGB
</p>
<p>stars (Sect. 34.8; Fig. 34.10), and that the main-sequence mass of stars that develop
</p>
<p>into He-WDs by avoiding the core helium flash is so low (. 0:50Mˇ; Sect. 35.2 and
Fig. 35.2) that even the age of the universe of about 14 Gyr has not been long enough
</p>
<p>to allow them to evolve off the main sequence (an estimate for the main-sequence
</p>
<p>lifetime from (30.2) would give 75 Gyrs; a numerical model yields almost twice
</p>
<p>this number). At the present time, the oldest globular clusters produce CO-WDs of
</p>
<p>� 0:53Mˇ (Kalirai 2009). According to Liebert et al. (2005), however, about 10%
of all white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood have indeed a mass below 0:45Mˇ</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>496 37 White Dwarfs
</p>
<p>and therefore are very likely He-WDs. This empirical result could be an indication
</p>
<p>for significant mass loss already on the red giant branch for stars withM &amp; 0:8Mˇ
or for a previous binary star evolution. To decide about the nature of WDs one
</p>
<p>therefore has to employ the mass&ndash;radius relation (Fig. 37.4), for which effective
</p>
<p>temperature (from spectroscopy) and absolute brightness (i.e. distance) are needed.
</p>
<p>But even for carbon&ndash;oxygenwhite dwarfs the ratio between these two elements will
</p>
<p>be decisive for the cooling rate, in particular during the phase of crystallization. This
</p>
<p>ratio depends, among other things, on the exact value of the 12C(˛; &#13; )16O reaction
</p>
<p>rate, which, as we have seen in Sect. 18.5.2, is uncertain by a factor of 2 and 3. This
</p>
<p>is a beautiful example how microphysics (a nuclear reaction rate) is connected with
</p>
<p>cosmological questions (the age of the oldest stars in the Milky Way).</p>

<p>Neutron Stars
</p>
<p>As early as 1934 Baade and Zwicky correctly predicted the birth of the strange
</p>
<p>objects neutron stars in supernova explosions (Baade and Zwicky 1934). The first
</p>
<p>models were calculated by Oppenheimer and Volkoff (1939), and the stage was
</p>
<p>then left for the next 28 years to particle physicists who struggled with the problem
</p>
<p>of matter at extreme densities (a struggle not yet finished). Radio astronomers
</p>
<p>accidentally found the first pulsar in 1967; it was interpreted soon after as a rapidly
</p>
<p>rotating neutron star (Gold 1968), emitting synchroton radiation in a narrow beacon
</p>
<p>along the magnetic axis. In addition, neutron stars were identified as sources of
</p>
<p>energetic X-ray emission, resulting from accretion in binary systems. By now, the
</p>
<p>existence of neutron stars is well established. The number of detected pulsars in the
</p>
<p>Galaxy already amounts to more than 1,800 (Lorimer 2008). These known neutron
</p>
<p>stars constitute only a tiny fraction of a population as large as a few hundred million.
</p>
<p>In some cases, their masses could be determined quite accurately (Fig. 38.2) because
</p>
<p>they are members of binary systems or from relativistic effects in their extreme
</p>
<p>gravitational potential. Everything is extreme with neutron stars, their interior state
</p>
<p>(simulating a huge nucleus), the velocity of sound (not far from c/; their rotation
</p>
<p>(frequencies 1 : : : 1; 000Hz), and their magnetic fields (from 109 to 1015 gauss).
</p>
<p>One is far from really understanding them. So we content ourselves here with a
</p>
<p>few remarks on the state of matter and the resulting models. For more detailed and
</p>
<p>complete information about neutron stars, we recommend one of the many existing
</p>
<p>textbooks on compact objects (e.g., Glendenning 1997; Camenzind 2007; Haensel

<p>nearly relativistic neutrons .EF � 1; 000MeV). The equation of state is essentially
the same as for T � 0. We refer to the descriptions of high-density matter in
Sect. 37.2 and of the equation of state in Chap. 16.
</p>
<p>With increasing density the rising Fermi energy of the electrons provides an
</p>
<p>increasing neutronization by electron captures. The neutron-rich equilibrium nuclei
</p>
<p>(such as 118Kr) begin to release free neutrons at %dr � 4:3 � 1011 g cm�3. This is
called the neutron drip. The matter consists of nuclei (usually arranged in a lattice)
</p>
<p>plus sufficient electrons for charge neutrality, and free neutrons. Their number
</p>
<p>nn increases with %, and so does their pressure Pn. While P � Pe � Pn still at
% D %dr; we have Pn D P=2 at % � 4 � 1012 g cm�3 (here the Coulomb lattice is
dissolving) and Pn &gt; 0:8P for % &amp; 1:5 � 1013 g cm�3; and finally Pn � P: The
neutrons are increasingly degenerate, but still non-relativistic, as their Fermi energy
</p>
<p>is much smaller than their rest-mass energy. Note that all characteristic densities
</p>
<p>quoted here and in the following depend in general on the model assumed for the
</p>
<p>particles and their interaction. The higher the values of %, the more uncertain are the
</p>
<p>details (see below).
</p>
<p>With progressing neutron drip the number of nuclei is diminished by fusion.
</p>
<p>The nuclei more or less touch each other at the nuclear density of %nuc � 2:7 �
1014 g cm�3, and hence they merge and dissolve, leaving a degenerate gas (or
liquid) of neutrons plus a small admixture of e� and p: The concentrations of these
particles can be calculated as an equilibrium between back and forth exchanges in
</p>
<p>the reaction n &bull; p C e� (The neutrinos leave the system immediately and can
be left out of the considerations.). The conditions are that the Fermi energies fulfil
</p>
<p>EnF D E
p
</p>
<p>F C EeF, and that ne D np for neutrality. This gives that np is about 1% (or
less) of nn for a wide range of % up to %nuc: At % � 6� 1015 g cm�3 the neutrons are
relativistically degenerate. With increasing relativity of the neutrons the fraction of
</p>
<p>protons raises slowly, until at an infinite relativity parameter one finds the limiting
</p>
<p>ratio nn W np W ne D 8 W 1 W 1. When % exceeds 1015 g cm�3, the Fermi energy of the
neutrons,EF D Œ.pFc/2 C .mnc2/2&#141;1=2, will gradually exceed the rest masses of the
hyperons of lowest mass (such as �;˙;�; : : :). These particles will then appear,
</p>
<p>i.e. a &ldquo;hyperonization&rdquo; begins. Finally even free quarks can occur. Obviously, at
</p>
<p>these densities, nuclear forces, the interaction between elementary particles, and
</p>
<p>the masses of hadron states are determining the exact composition of neutron star
</p>
<p>matter. Astrophysics meets quantum chromodynamics!
</p>
<p>We now come to the equation of state, in particular the dependence of P on %.
</p>
<p>For % up to %drip, the pressure is dominated by the relativistic, degenerate electrons,
</p>
<p>and P � Pe � %4=3 [cf. (15.26)].
The onset of the neutron drip (% D %drip) has severe consequences for the
</p>
<p>equation of state. An increase d% mainly increases nn at the expense of ne (which
</p>
<p>yields the pressure), such that the increment dP is small (see Fig. 16.2). Therefore
</p>
<p>the gas becomes more compressible, which is described as a &ldquo;softening&rdquo; of the
</p>
<p>equation of state (in the opposite case one speaks of &ldquo;stiffening&rdquo;). In other terms the
</p>
<p>adiabatic index &#13;ad D .d lnP=d ln%/ad drops appreciably below the critical value 4/3
(cf. Sect. 25.3.2), and only when Pn contributes sufficiently to P will &#13;ad again rise
</p>
<p>above 4/3 at % � 7 � 1012 g cm�3.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38.1 Cold Matter Beyond Neutron Drip 499
</p>
<p>When the neutron pressure Pn dominates one may tentatively consider the
</p>
<p>approximation that the gas consists of ideal (non-interacting), fully degenerate
</p>
<p>neutrons. These are fermions like the electrons, and they obey the same statistics, so
</p>
<p>that the same relations hold as derived in Sect. 15.2, if there me is replaced by mn

<p>% D %0 C u=c2. This distinction was not necessary for the electron gas, where %0
(comingmainly from the non-degenerate nucleons) was always large comparedwith
</p>
<p>the energy density u=c2 coming from the degenerate electron gas. Now both %0 and
</p>
<p>u=c2 are provided by the degenerate neutrons. For non-relativistic neutrons, %0 �
u=c2 and % � %0; for relativistic neutrons, %0 � u=c2 and % � u=c2: For relativistic
particles, however, we know that P D u=3, i.e. P D %c2=3. So we can write

<p>Pn � %� ;

<p>� D 5=3 .non� relativistic/;

<p>� D 1 .relativistic/: (38.3)
</p>
<p>The distinction between % and %0 will be seen to be important for NS models. The
</p>
<p>relation P D %c2=3 also yields the velocity of sound directly as v2s D .dP=d%/ad D
c2=3, i.e. vs D 0:577c.
</p>
<p>Of course, with the densities considered here, the interaction between nucleons
</p>
<p>is far from being negligible. It dominates the behaviour long before the limit
</p>
<p>6 � 1015 g cm�3, where pF D mnc; is reached. In order to calculate its influence
on the equation of state, one faces two problems. The first is the determination of
</p>
<p>a reasonable potential. In the absence of a rigorous theory and of experiments at
</p>
<p>such high densities, one has to use a model of the interacting particles that meets
</p>
<p>the results of low-energy scattering, the properties of saturation of nuclear forces,
</p>
<p>etc. It is not surprising that such models yield large uncertainties when extrapolated
</p>
<p>and applied to the densities found in NS. The qualitative influence of some effects</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>500 38 Neutron Stars
</p>
<p>on the equation of state is quite obvious. For example, the interaction between two
</p>
<p>nucleons depends (aside from spin and isospin properties) on their distance. When
</p>
<p>approaching each other they first feel an attraction, which turns to repulsion below a
</p>
<p>critical distance (in the extreme: at an inner hard core). Attraction (dominant at not
</p>
<p>too high %) reduces P and gives a softer equation of state. Repulsion (dominant at
</p>
<p>very high % and small average particle distances) increases P and thus stiffens the
</p>
<p>equation of state. Obviously details of the potential can shift the border appreciably
</p>
<p>between these two regimes.
</p>
<p>Other uncertainties are connected with the appearance of new particles when %
</p>
<p>increases. For example, if hyperons of some type occur in sufficient number, they
</p>
<p>contribute to %; but scarcely to P; since their creation lowers the Fermi sea of the
</p>
<p>neutrons. Therefore &ldquo;hyperonization&rdquo; makes the gas more compressible. At ultra-
</p>
<p>high densities (say � 10%nuc) so many new resonances appear that, in the extreme,
attempts have been made to describe their number in a certain energy range only
</p>
<p>by statistics (which leads, e.g., to the rather soft Hagedorn equation of state). But
</p>
<p>if the nucleons almost touch each other, one might have to consider something like
</p>
<p>quark interaction. The question was even discussed whether this might lead to quark
</p>
<p>matter and possibly to quark stars.1 Finally, in case that the absolute ground state
</p>
<p>of strong interactions is that of quark matter in a deconfined state, in which up,
</p>
<p>down, and strange quarks are present in about equal number, neutron stars will
</p>
<p>consist of this so-called strange matter and would be strange stars (For a discussion
</p>
<p>of quark and strange stars, see, e.g., the corresponding chapters in the book by
</p>
<p>Glendenning.).
</p>
<p>As early as % . 2%nuc the possibility of the reaction n ! p C �� (if En �
EpCE�� ) gives the possibility of having a Bose&ndash;Einstein condensate of the cold��
bosons in momentum space with zero momentum, i.e. no contribution to P but to %.
</p>
<p>The second quite general problem for determining the equation of state is that,
</p>
<p>even if the potential were known exactly, one would not know how to solve
</p>
<p>convincingly the many-body problem. Several attempts use different assumptions
</p>
<p>and yield different results.
</p>
<p>To resume, we must stress that the equation of state is highly uncertain for at least
</p>
<p>two independent reasons (concerning the potential and the many-body problem), but
</p>
<p>there are still more open questions concerning possible effects of superfluidity and
</p>
<p>superconductivity,which might influence the evolution of neutron stars, in particular
</p>
<p>their rotation and magnetic fields. In fact particle physics cannot yet decide which
</p>
<p>of the available equations of state is correct, but the softest ones now seem to be
</p>
<p>ruled out by observation of neutron stars (see below). In Fig. 16.2 just one of them
</p>
<p>is plotted, which should resemble the general properties, but will not be exact in the
</p>
<p>details.
</p>
<p>1The full beauty of this term can be savoured only in German, where the term &ldquo;quark&rdquo; means either
</p>
<p>a popular, soft white cheese or, in slang, complete nonsense.</p>

</p>
<p>38.2 Models of Neutron Stars
</p>
<p>For a given equation of state of the form P D P.%/ it is easy to obtain the corre-
sponding hydrostatic models of NS. One has only to integrate the relativistic equa-
</p>
<p>tion of hydrostatic equilibrium (2.31) (the Tolman&ndash;Oppenheimer&ndash;Volkoff equation)
</p>
<p>together with (2.30), starting at r D 0 with a chosen central density %c: Since the
equation of state is independent of T , these two equations suffice for obtaining the
</p>
<p>mechanical structure. This is seen after replacing P by % in (2.31), so that there are
</p>
<p>two equations for the variables % andm:When the integration comes to % D P D 0,
the surface is reached, i.e. we have found R D r and M D m.R/ (We do not
have to worry about the obvious failure of the equation of state for P ! 0. The
transition region to the non-degenerate atmosphere, and even the whole atmosphere,
</p>
<p>are negligibly thin so that the error made is small.).
</p>
<p>Repeating this integration for a variety of starting values %c, one can produce a
</p>
<p>sequence of models for the chosen equation of state. They give, in particular, the
</p>
<p>relations M D M.%c/, R D R.%c), and by elimination of %c also R D R.M/
(cf. Fig. 38.1).
</p>
<p>The resulting relationsM.%c/ and R.M/ change considerably if we replace the
</p>
<p>equation of state by another one, as can be seen in Fig. 38.1 for M.R/, where the
</p>
<p>results are plotted for several equations of state. The persisting common feature is
</p>
<p>that all relationsM.%c/ show a minimum and a maximum ofM; although at quite
</p>
<p>different values. One can easily understand the qualitative changes which occur
</p>
<p>when a soft equation of state is replaced by a stiffer one. The matter is then less
</p>
<p>compressible; for given M one expects a larger R and a smaller %c. For given %c
one can put more mass on top until reaching the surface with % D 0. This lowers
the gravity inside the model, and Mmax is higher. A particularly soft equation of
</p>
<p>state is that for the ideal degenerate neutron gas in (38.3), since the repulsive forces
</p>
<p>at small particle distances are completely neglected. Correspondingly Oppenheimer
</p>
<p>and Volkoff (1939) obtained for this equation of state a maximum mass of only
</p>
<p>Mmax � 0:72Mˇ. Normally the maxima range roughly between 1Mˇ and 3Mˇ,
but Fig. 38.1 also demonstrates that a particularly stiff equation of state, obtained
</p>
<p>by including interactions into the Oppenheimer&ndash;Volkoff equation, may lead to
</p>
<p>maximum masses above 3Mˇ. We have stressed in Sect. 38.1 that particle physics
cannot yet supply the correct equation of state. All the more interesting are objects
</p>
<p>like the binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 (also called the Hulse&ndash;Taylor pulsar), for
</p>
<p>which the masses could be determined very accurately when details of the orbital
</p>
<p>motion were interpreted as general relativistic effects.2 The result for the NS isM D
1:442Mˇ with a vanishing small uncertainty, which rules out all equations of state
</p>
<p>2These effects include a shrinking of the orbit&ndash;and therefore a decrease of the orbital period (of
</p>
<p>the order of 60ms)&ndash;due to the loss of gravitational waves. The observations agree perfectly with
</p>
<p>the predictions of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of general relativity and are considered as indirect proof for the
</p>
<p>existence of gravitational waves. J.H. Taylor and R. Hulse were awarded with the Nobel Prize for
</p>
<p>this in 1993.</p>

</p>
<p>assumptions are specifically indicated: a non-interacting neutron gas (Oppenheimer and Volkoff
</p>

</p>
<p>where interactions are included and which leads to a maximum neutron star mass above 3Mˇ
(After Fig. 10.3 in Weber et al. 2009, where also details about the other five equations of state can
</p>
<p>be found)
</p>
<p>so soft that theirMmax is below 1:44Mˇ. Very recently, another binary millisecond
pulsar&ndash;J1614-2230&ndash;wasanalysed by Demorest et al. (2010), who determine a pulsar
</p>
<p>mass of 1:97˙0:04Mˇ, using the so-called Shapiro delay of the pulsar signal, which
is caused by the fact that light signals do not travel a straight line, but follow null-
</p>
<p>geodesics which are bent, and therefore longer, by the gravitational potential. This
</p>
<p>result rules out at least two more equations of state of Fig. 38.1, among them one for
</p>
<p>&ldquo;strange stars&rdquo; (in the figure, this corresponds to the left-most line). Here seems to
</p>
<p>be one of the cases where astrophysical measurements set a discriminating limit to
</p>
<p>particle physics. A collection of accurately determined neutron-star masses is given
</p>
<p>in Fig. 38.2. They were obtained by differentmethods, on which we do not comment
</p>
<p>further, but refer to the respective textbooks.
</p>
<p>The maximum mass for NS is very important, not only in connection with
</p>
<p>evolutionary considerations, but also in the attempt to identify compact objects with
</p>
<p>M &gt; Mmax as black holes. If our ignorance of the equation of state does not yet
</p>
<p>allow the determination ofMmax to better than the interval 2 : : : 3Mˇ, we should at
least understand that such a maximum mass (well below 5Mˇ) must exist.
</p>
<p>In order to make this plausible, we neglect effects of general relativity, i.e.
</p>
<p>consider the usual equation of hydrostatic equilibrium but keep those of special
</p>
<p>relativity as allowed for in (38.3). Let us consider some averages of P and % over the
</p>
<p>whole star. As in (37.15) the normal hydrostatic equation then yields the estimate

</p>
<p>we obtain the Chandrasekhar mass of MCh D 5:73Mˇ as the mass limit for
an infinite relativity parameter (&#13; 0 D 4=3). Clearly, therefore, Mmax &lt; MCh. The
here neglected influence of general relativity [i.e. the description of hydrostatic
</p>
<p>equilibrium by the TOV equation equation (2.31)] tends to decrease Mmax even
</p>
<p>more (see below).
</p>
<p>Closely connected with the extrema of M are the stability properties. The
</p>
<p>relation M D M.%c/ can be considered to represent a sequence of equilibrium
models with the parameter %c. Figure 38.3 shows a schematic overview of the
</p>
<p>resulting M � R relation for cold catalysed matter from the regime of planets to
that of ultra-dense NS. Starting from planets, %c increases monotonically along the
</p>
<p>curve (compare with typical values of %c indicated in Fig. 38.3). There are extrema
</p>
<p>of R which may be interesting in other connections but are not important for the
</p>
<p>sequence M.%c). However, one also encounters extrema of M (open circles). The
</p>
<p>most important are Mmin and Mmax for NS, as well as the maximum M for white
</p>
<p>dwarfs. These are critical points at which a detailed stability analysis shows that the
</p>
<p>stability of the equilibrium models changes. The stable parts of the curve are those
</p>
<p>with dM=d%c &gt; 0, i.e. the branch of NS withMmin &lt; M &lt; Mmax (and the white-
</p>
<p>dwarf and planetary branch with M &lt; maximum mass for white dwarfs). When
</p>
<p>further increasing %c beyond the point at whichM DMmax there follows an infinite
number of maxima and minima of M . Correspondingly the curve R D R.M/
spirals into a limiting point, which is reached for %c ! 1. All of these branches
are in fact unstable. The stability analysis can also be made for general relativistic
</p>
<p>configurations. In the Newtonian limit one has the well-known result that an average
</p>
<p>of the exponent &#13;ad of &#13;cr D 4=3 is equivalent to marginal stability (see Sect. 25.3.2),</p>

<p>and in addition it can be shown (see Shapiro and Teukolsky 1983) that small effects

; (38.5)
</p>
<p>where � is a positive quantity of the order of unity. Therefore general relativity
</p>
<p>increases &#13;cr; making the star more unstable, since stability requires N&#13;ad &gt; &#13;cr. For
M D 1Mˇ, R D 10 km the correction term in (38.5) is about 0.15, i.e. far from
being negligible. &#13;cr can be raised well above 5/3 (even above 2 for certain models
</p>
<p>nearMmax/ such that all but the stiffest equations of state would give instability. This
</p>
<p>increase of &#13;cr is an important factor in determining the value ofMmax (together with
</p>
<p>the lowering of N&#13;ad).
A very stiff equation of state, for example, gives Mmax D 2:7Mˇ, with
</p>
<p>R D 13:5 km and %c D 1:5 � 1015 g cm�3, while a softer one yieldsMmax D 2Mˇ,
with R D 9 km and %c D 3:3� 1015 g cm�3. At present there is no equation of state
that can be considered realistic and that would give Mmax well above 3Mˇ. This
includes calculations that take into account general relativity.
</p>
<p>The model is also marginally stable at the minimum massMmin, where the curve
</p>
<p>in Fig. 38.3 begins leading to the white dwarfs. This instability is essentially caused
</p>
<p>by the lowering of &#13; 0 in connection with the neutron drip (see Sect. 38.1). We
have seen that the release of free neutrons from nuclei results in &#13; 0 . 4=3 in the
range % � 4 � 1011 : : : 7 � 1012 g cm�3. Typical models for the minimum mass of
stable neutron stars giveMmin � 0:09Mˇ, R � 160 km, %c � 1:5 � 1014 g cm�3.
The average density is, of course, much smaller .�1010 g cm�3/, and the averaged
&#13;ad becomes just equal to &#13;cr (which is here close to 4/3).
</p>
<p>Let us dwell briefly on the meaning of the mass values quoted for NS. The stellar
</p>
<p>massM is here always the &ldquo;gravitational mass&rdquo;, which is the value measurable for
</p>
<p>an outside observer [cf. the comments in Sect. 2.6 after (2.29)].M differs from the
</p>
<p>proper massM0 D Nm0, given by the total numberN of nucleons with a rest mass
m0, since in relativity, the total binding energyW of the configuration appears as a
</p>
<p>mass �M D W=c2; such that
</p>
<p>M D M0 C
W
</p>
<p>c2
DM0 C�M: (38.6)
</p>
<p>In the Newtonian limit (for weak fields) we were used to identifying particularly
</p>
<p>the internal energy Ei (from motion and interaction of particles) and the poten-
</p>
<p>tial energy Eg in the gravitational field. Then for a static, stable configuration,
</p>
<p>W D Ei C Eg &lt; 0, since Eg &lt; 0 and �Eg &gt; Ei (In the Newtonian limit Eg
and Ei were related by the virial theorem, cf. Chap. 3.). Correspondingly we may
</p>
<p>now say that the mass of a NS is increased by the internal energy and decreased by
</p>
<p>the (negative) potential energy, and the latter term wins. ThereforeW &lt; 0, and we
</p>
<p>have a mass defect �M &lt; 0. Depending on the precise model, j�M j can go up
to 10 : : : 25% ofM nearMmax. FormallyM is given as an integral over 4�r
</p>
<p>2%dr ,
</p>
<p>where % is the total mass-energy density (%0C u=c2/ and 4�r2dr is not the volume</p>

<p>element. This is rather given by dV D 4�r2 e�=2dr with e�=2 being a component of
the metric tensor (cf. Sect. 2.6). Then simply

<p>Here %0=% &lt; 1, but e

</p>
<p>So if we find an NS with mass M , we know that it started off as a more massive
</p>
<p>configuration. The mass defect j�M j was radiated away in the course of evolution
by photons, neutrinos, or gravitational radiation. In that sense the original Kelvin&ndash;
</p>
<p>Helmholtz hypothesis that contraction supplies the radiated energy has turned out to
</p>
<p>be correct. The mass defect reaches a maximum atM D Mmax and then decreases
again towards models with still larger %c:
</p>
<p>The maximum mass for NS is scarcely influenced by rotation. Except for the
</p>
<p>very few most rapidly spinning pulsars, centrifugal forces play practically no role
</p>
<p>in NS, since the overwhelming gravitational forces dominate completely. This is at
</p>
<p>least true for rigidly rotating NS stars. However, differential rotation may stabilize
</p>
<p>neutron stars and will lead to higher maximum masses. In the case of simple
</p>
<p>polytropemodels, differential rotation can raiseMmax by up to 50% (see Baumgarte
</p>
<p>and Shapiro 2010, Chap. 14).
</p>
<p>Now we turn to describe the stratification of matter inside an NS model. At
</p>
<p>the very outer part there must be an atmosphere of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; non-degenerate
</p>
<p>matter. Going inwards, we come to gradually larger densities and encounter all
</p>
<p>characteristic changes of high-density matter as described in Sect. 38.1.
</p>
<p>The atmosphere of an NS is very hot and incredibly compressed. Typical
</p>
<p>temperatures are of the order of 106K (see below). The extension is very small
</p>
<p>owing to the high surface gravity g0 � 1:3 � 1014 cm s�2 (For comparison,
g0 D 2:7 � 104 cm s�2 for the Sun and � 108 cm s�2 for white dwarfs.). This
gives a pressure scale height of the order of 1 cm only. In the surface layers (say
</p>
<p>% . 106 g cm�3/ the behaviour of the matter is still influenced by the temperature
and also by strong magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>Not far below the surface, the densities will be in and above the range typical for
</p>
<p>the interior of white dwarfs (&amp;106 g cm�3/. As an example we discuss the model
for an NS of M D 1:4Mˇ (see Fig. 38.4), calculated by using an equation of
state of moderate stiffness which gives Mmax � 2Mˇ. The radius of the 1:4Mˇ
model is 10.6 km. Although there are newer models, the present one is still a good
</p>
<p>representation of the typical structure of neutron stars.
</p>
<p>Below the surface there is a solid crust .106 . % . 2:4 � 1014 g cm�3/ of
thickness �r � 0:9 km. The matter in the crust contains nuclei, which are mainly
Fe near the surface (cf. the equilibrium composition as a function of % described
</p>
<p>in Sect. 37.2). These nuclei will form a lattice, thus minimizing the energy of
</p>
<p>Coulomb interaction as in crystallized white dwarfs. The outer crust consists only of</p>

</p>
<p>a depth of �r � 0:3 km to where the neutron drip density %dr � 4 � 1011 g cm�3
is reached. In the subsequent inner crust (4 � 1011 . % . 2 � 1014 g cm�3/, a
liquid of free neutrons exists in addition to the nuclei (still arranged in a lattice,
</p>
<p>and becoming increasingly neutron-rich) and the electrons. With decreasing r the
</p>
<p>free neutrons become more and more abundant at the expense of the nuclei, and the
</p>
<p>lattice disappears with the nuclei, until all nuclei are dissolved into homogeneous,
</p>
<p>neutron-rich nuclear matter at % D %nuc � 2:4 � 1014 g cm�3, which therefore
defines the lower boundary of the solid crust, at a depth of 0.9 km. The equation of
</p>
<p>state throughout the crust is relatively well known; this is the reason why our aged
</p>
<p>neutron-star model is still valid.
</p>
<p>Below the crust there is the interior neutron liquid .% &amp; 2:4 � 1014 g cm�3/
consisting mainly of neutrons in equilibrium with a few protons, electrons, and
</p>
<p>muons. All constituents are strongly degenerate and the hadrons are interacting by
</p>
<p>nuclear forces. The neutrons will be superfluid, the protons superconductive. The
</p>
<p>equation of state begins not to be well-known in this density regime, and from here
</p>
<p>on the structure and composition of the inner core depends on the equation of state
</p>
<p>used.
</p>
<p>It is unclear whether there is finally a central solid core in which the neutrons
</p>
<p>form a solid owing to their repulsive forces at small particle distances. The central
</p>
<p>density of our model is %c � 1:3 � 1015 g cm�3. The inner core may also consist of
baryon condensates (��, K�), of a mixture hyperons and baryon resonances (˙ ,
�, � , �), or deconfined quark matter. We refer the reader to Fig. 10.1 in Weber
</p>
<p>et al. (2009) for a graphical representation of various possibilities. In that figure, our
</p>
<p>model would be one of the traditional neutron stars.
</p>
<p>The superfluidity of the neutron and proton liquids and the solid parts (crust
</p>
<p>and possible core) play a role in the attempts to explain the observed &ldquo;glitches&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>508 38 Neutron Stars
</p>
<p>of pulsars. These are sudden spin-ups, interrupting from time to time the normal,
</p>
<p>regular spin-down (decrease of the rotation frequency ˝). There is a hypothesis
</p>
<p>according to which a glitch is due originally to a &ldquo;starquake&rdquo;, decreasing suddenly
</p>
<p>the moment of inertia Ic of the crust. Conservation of angular momentum requires
</p>
<p>a corresponding increase of˝ . The relaxation to the normal state depends critically
</p>
<p>on the coupling of the rotating crust and the rotating interior liquid (and possible
</p>
<p>solid core). The charged components could be coupled magnetically, while the
</p>
<p>superfluid matter may couple via vortices. This coupling is the basis of another
</p>
<p>model of the glitches: the superfluid neutron liquid in the interior and in the inner
</p>
<p>crust is considered to rotate with an angular velocity slightly different from that
</p>
<p>of the lattice of nuclei in the crust. The coupling is provided by vortices in the
</p>
<p>liquid and is thought to break down suddenly when the crust has been decelerated
</p>
<p>sufficiently by the pulsar mechanism on the outside. The vortices can contain an
</p>
<p>appreciable fraction of the star&rsquo;s angular momentum, and their distortion induces
</p>
<p>immediate changes of the observed rotation.
</p>
<p>The thermal properties (except for the earliest stages) in principle follow once
</p>
<p>the mechanical models are given. One can then calculate the thermal conductivity,
</p>
<p>which, together with a given outward flux of energy, determines the T gradient
</p>
<p>at any point. It turns out that like white dwarfs (Sect. 37.3) the NS have a nearly
</p>
<p>isothermal interior because of the high thermal conductivity. Only in the outermost
</p>
<p>layers does T drop, by typically a factor of 102, to the surface temperature.
</p>
<p>Particularly in the first, hot phases, the cooling will be very rapid because of strong
</p>
<p>neutrino losses.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we have completely ignored the strong magnetic fields of neutron
</p>
<p>stars. While they are of only minor importance for the structure and the maximum
</p>
<p>mass, they are crucial for many phenomena which allow the observation of neutron
</p>
<p>stars. Most notably this is the pulsar phenomenon, which is due to the emission
</p>
<p>of synchrotron radiation along the axis of the magnetic dipole, being inclined with
</p>
<p>respect to the rotation axis. The typical field strength of pulsar magnetic fields are
</p>
<p>of order 1011&ndash;1013G. Some NS possess even stronger magnetic fields, up to 1015G,
</p>
<p>which is the highest known level in the universe. They are called magnetars and are
</p>
<p>the source for the soft gamma repeaters (Thompson and Duncan 1995), a class of
</p>
<p>gamma-ray bursts that exceed the Eddington luminosity by far, but are characterized
</p>
<p>by a comparably soft gamma spectrum. In a magnetar, the decaying magnetic field
</p>
<p>is the source of free energy (rather than rotation, as in pulsars). As we said at the
</p>
<p>beginning, everything is extreme in neutron stars.</p>

<p>Black holes (BH) represent the ultimate degree of compactness to which a stellar

<p>configuration can evolve. Having already called the neutron star a strange object,
</p>
<p>one cannot help labelling BH as weird. From the many fascinating aspects that are
</p>
<p>accessible via the full mathematical procedure (cf. Misner et al. 1973; Shapiro and
</p>
<p>Teukolsky 1983; Chandrasekhar 1983) we will indicate only a few points, showing
</p>
<p>that this is really a final stage of evolution, not just another late phase. We limit the

<p>description to non-rotating BH without charge.
</p>
<p>The theoretical description to be applied is that of general relativity (see, e.g.,

<p>a very condensed mass concentration M with spherical symmetry. The vacuum

<p>These derivatives are inclinations of the two radial boundaries of the light cone in
</p>
<p>an r� Nt plane (see Fig. 39.1). The first always corresponds to an inward motion with
the same velocity c. The second derivative changes sign at r D rs, being positive
for r &gt; rs, where photons can be emitted outwards (dr &gt; 0). With decreasing
</p>
<p>r , (d Nt=dr/2 becomes larger so that the light cone narrows and its axis turns to the
left in Fig. 39.1. At r D rs the light cone is such that no photon can be emitted to the</p>

<p>outside (dr &gt; 0). This is the reason for calling a configuration with R D rs a &ldquo;black
hole&rdquo;, and for speaking of the Schwarzschild radius rs as the radius of a BH of mass
</p>
<p>M . For r &lt; rs both solutions (39.12) are negative and the whole light cone is turned
</p>
<p>inwards. Therefore inside rs all radiation (together with all material particles, which
</p>
<p>can move only inside the light cone) is drawn inexorably towards the centre. This
</p>
<p>means also that no static solution (dr D d# D d' D 0) is possible inside rs, since
it would require a motion vertically upwards in Fig. 39.1, i.e. outside the light cone.

<p>For our purposes we set A2 � 1 D �rs=r0. According to (39.17) this means that the

<p>The motion in terms of the coordinate time t of an observer at infinity is

<p>quite different. The relation between t and � is given by (39.16) as d�=dt D

<p>with � as in (39.18) and � D .r0=rs � 1/1=2. The curve t D t.r/ is also shown in
Fig. 39.2 for r0 D 5rs. The fact that the observer sees the � clock of the particle
slowing down completely for r ! rs has the result that t D t.r/ approaches r D rs
only asymptotically for t ! 1. Events inside r D rs are completely shielded for
the distant observer by the coordinate singularity at the Schwarzschild radius acting
</p>
<p>as an &ldquo;event horizon&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>These few considerations may suffice to illustrate some important properties of
</p>
<p>configurations which collapse into a BH [Note that the Schwarzschild metric (39.1)
</p>
<p>is a vacuum solution, which is not valid inside the mass configuration, but holds
</p>
<p>from the surface outwards.].
</p>
<p>As observed from the infalling surface (proper time �) the collapse proceeds
</p>
<p>fairly rapidly and in particular quite smoothly through the Schwarzschild radius
</p>
<p>r D rs. Once the surface is inside rs a static configuration is no longer possible, and
the final collapse into the central singularity within a very short time is unavoidable.
</p>
<p>This is shown by the fact that material particles have world lines only inside the
</p>
<p>local light cone, and this is open only towards r D 0 (even radiation falls to r D 0).
Note that it would not help to invoke an extreme pressure exerted by unknown
</p>
<p>physical effects, since the pressure would also contribute to the gravitating energy.
</p>
<p>The singularity at r D 0 is an essential one (as opposed to the mere coordinate
singularity at r D rs) with infinite gravity, though the physical conditions there are</p>

</p>
<p>not yet clear. Quantum effects should be included and one can speculate whether
</p>
<p>they might remove the singularity.
</p>
<p>The collapse of a star will present itself quite differently for an astronomer who
</p>
<p>is (we hope) very far away. In his coordinate time t he will see that the collapse
</p>
<p>of the stellar surface slows down more and more, the closer it comes to rs. In fact
</p>
<p>he will find that this critical point is not reached within finite time t ; for him the
</p>
<p>collapsing surface seems to become stationary there. Of course, the approach of the
</p>
<p>surface to rs strongly affects the light received by the distant observer. He receives
</p>
<p>photons in ever increasing intervals and with ever decreasing energy, due to the red
</p>
<p>shift z ! 1 according to (39.5). Thus the collapsing star will finally &ldquo;go out&rdquo; for
the distant observer. Only a strong gravitational field is left.
</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that aside from the Schwarzschild solution for non-
</p>
<p>rotating, uncharged BH, there exist solutions which describe a rotating BH (Kerr
</p>
<p>metric) and a charged BH (Newman metric), the combination of these covering the
</p>
<p>full generality of possible properties of a BH: it is fully defined by mass, angular
</p>
<p>momentum, and charge. This surprising scantiness of properties left after the final
</p>
<p>collapse was summarized by Wheeler: &ldquo;a black hole has no hair&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>From the foregoing it is clear that black holes cannot be observed directly. How-
</p>
<p>ever, they can be detected through their enormous influence on their surroundings.
</p>
<p>For a long time, however, BHs remained a theoretical possibility without proof
</p>
<p>of their reality. This has changed during the last few decades, and by now, their
</p>
<p>existence in two completely different mass ranges has been confirmed.
</p>
<p>The first type of BHs are of galactic scale, sit in the centre of many galaxies,
</p>
<p>and have masses of 106 . MBH=Mˇ . 1010. They truly deserve the name
supermassive black holes. They are detected by the analysis of the dynamics of stars
</p>
<p>in their vicinity. The overall rotation velocity (e.g. in the disks of spiral galaxies),</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>39 Black Holes 515
</p>
<p>or the velocity dispersion (in elliptical galaxies) allows to determine the total mass
</p>
<p>interior to the galactocentric radius at which it is measured. With increasing spatial
</p>
<p>resolution of the telescopes, most notably the Hubble Space Telescope, the central
</p>
<p>mass could be restricted to smaller and smaller central regions, until finally only a
</p>
<p>supermassive black hole could explain the dynamics. The determined masses agree
</p>
<p>well with the estimates for the mass of the central engine in quasars and other active
</p>
<p>galaxies, needed to power the energetic of these objects.
</p>
<p>A particularly convincing case is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4258, where
</p>
<p>microwave emission from gas orbiting the centre has been observed. For such
</p>
<p>long wavelengths the resolution is even higher and it was found that the maser
</p>
<p>clouds orbit a central mass of forty million solar masses on orbits of only half a
</p>
<p>light year! Note that the Schwarzschild radius of such a BH is 1:2� 1013 cm, which
is still only 10�5 of that distance. Nevertheless, no stellar cluster with that mass
could be accommodated in this volume.
</p>
<p>Our own Milky Way is hosting a supermassive BH as well (Genzel et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>From near-infrared observations of its centre, it was found that the radio source
</p>
<p>Sgr A? coincides with a supermassive BH of about 3.6 million Mˇ. The proof
was brought about from accurate determinations of the position and movement of
</p>
<p>a cluster of about 20 stars over a decade and longer (Eckart and Genzel 1996). As
</p>
<p>before, the stars orbit with velocities of several hundred km/s around a mass of that
</p>
<p>size which is occupying a volume with a radius smaller than 0.001 pc, and this
</p>
<p>extremely high mass concentration can only be explained with a black hole.
</p>
<p>The origin and growth of supermassive BHs is not understood, but we have good
</p>
<p>models for the creation of the so-called stellar black holes. Their masses are in the
</p>
<p>range 2:5 .MBH . 50, and they are thought to have been created either directly in
</p>
<p>core collapse supernova explosions (see Chap. 36, and Fig. 34.10), or by themerging
</p>
<p>of binary neutron stars. They have been detected by using the fact that in binary
</p>
<p>systems mass from a companion may flow onto the black hole, and in doing so,
</p>
<p>accumulates in an accretion disk because of the conservation of angular momentum.
</p>
<p>Due to the extremely deep gravitational potential well around the BH, the energy of
</p>
<p>the infalling material is so high that any dissipative process in the disk releases
</p>
<p>X-ray photons. X-ray binary systems are therefore the ideal place to look for proof
</p>
<p>of stellar BHs. The method is rather straightforward: one measures the orbital period
</p>
<p>˘ , and the maximum line-of-sight velocityKcomp D v sin i of the visible companion
using the Doppler effect. The inclination angle is not known, but can be estimated
</p>
<p>from other information or treated with a probability approach. These two quantities

</p>
<p>Pulsating Stars
</p>
<p>Throughout this book we have repeatedly considered the stability of stellar layers.
</p>
<p>A very important aspect of stellar stability is the occurrence of pulsations. Since
</p>
<p>their periods are determined by the dynamical timescale they are much easier
</p>
<p>to observe than evolutionary changes of stars, and the periods are very often
</p>
<p>determined with high precision. Since the recognition that the brightness of Mira
</p>
<p>(o Cet) and other stars is not constant, but varying (semi-)regularly, the interest
</p>
<p>in stellar pulsations has constantly grown, because it was realized that we can
</p>
<p>learn about the stellar interior and about the speed of stellar evolution from these
</p>
<p>pulsations. It has culminated in the field of helioseismology, and more recently in
</p>
<p>its generalization, asteroseismology.
</p>
<p>In the following chapters we discuss only briefly the basic concepts of the
</p>
<p>theory of stellar pulsations, which is essentially the problem of solving equations
</p>
<p>that describe perturbations of a star from its hydrostatic equilibrium on dynamical
</p>
<p>timescales. The whole field has become so extended and specialised that it requires a
</p>
<p>separate textbook.We recommend the classical books by Unno et al. (1979) and Cox
</p>
<p>(1980), but in particular the very recent one by Aerts et al. (2010).</p>

<p>Adiabatic Spherical Pulsations
</p>
<p>40.1 The Eigenvalue Problem
</p>
<p>The functions P0.m/; r0.m/; and %0.m/ are supposed to belong to a solution of the
</p>
<p>stellar-structure equations (10.1)&ndash;(10.4) for the case of complete equilibrium. Let
</p>
<p>us assume that we perturb the hydrostatic equilibrium, say by compressing the star
</p>
<p>slightly and releasing it again suddenly. It will expand and owing to inertia overshoot
</p>
<p>the equilibrium state: the star starts to oscillate. The analogy to the oscillating piston
</p>
<p>model (see Sect. 6.6) is obvious. More precisely we assume the initial displacement
</p>
<p>of the mass elements to be only radially directed .d# D d' D 0/ and of constant
absolute value on concentric spheres. This leads to purely radial oscillations (or
</p>
<p>radial pulsations) during which the star remains spherically symmetric all time. For
</p>
<p>the perturbed variables at time t we write

<p>From the theory of eigenvalue problems of the Sturm&ndash;Liouville type, a series of

<p>theorems immediately follows that we shall here list without proofs (which can be

3. The eigenfunction x0 of the lowest eigenvalue !0 has no node in the interval

<p>Now we come to the question of stability. Since the perturbations are assumed to

</p>
<p>so that if !2n &gt; 0, then ˙!n is real, and the perturbations according to (40.1) are
purely oscillatory (with constant amplitude): the equilibrium is dynamically stable.

<p>The simplest such solution of (40.26) is obvious: x D x0 D constant is an

<p>x0 D constant, %0 D constant. Note that (40.27) shows the famous period&ndash;density
relation for pulsating stars: !20=%0 D constant.
</p>
<p>For the overtones we try polynomials in r0. Indeed if for the first overtone we
</p>
<p>take x D 1 C b�2 with constant b, then (40.26) can be solved with b D �7=5 and

</p>
<p>If one assumes for a ı Cephei star that M D 7Mˇ and R D 80Rˇ, its mean
density is � 2 � 10�5 g cm�3. If the period is 11d, then ˘. N%/1=2 � 0:049 (˘ in
days, N% in g cm�3). This constant gives a period of about 220 days for a supergiant
with N% D 5�10�8 g cm�3, while for a white dwarf (with N% � 106 g cm�3), it gives a
period of 4 s. Indeed the supergiant period is of the order of those observed for Mira
</p>
<p>stars, while very short periods are observed for white dwarfs.
</p>
<p>The dimensionless equation (40.34) depends on n and &#13;ad, where the polytropic

</p>
<p>of the stiffness of the configuration. If &#13;ad D 4=3, then ˝ D 0 is an eigenvalue
and x D constant the corresponding eigenfunction, as can be seen from (40.34);
the model is then marginally stable and after compression does not go back to its
</p>
<p>original size. The larger the &#13;ad, the better the stability, since the compressed model
</p>
<p>will expand more violently after being released. This can be understood with the
</p>
<p>help of the considerations in Sect. 25.3.2.
</p>
<p>Numerical solutions of the eigenvalue problem show how variations in n and
</p>
<p>&#13;ad modify the solutions. Because of the singularities of (40.34) at both ends of
</p>
<p>the interval 0 &lt; z &lt; zn .zn is the value of z for which the Lane&ndash;Emden function
</p>
<p>of index n vanishes) the numerical solution is not straightforward. The simplest
</p>
<p>way is to choose a trial value ˝ D ˝� and to start two integrations with power
series regular at z D 0 and at z D zn. The outward and inward integrations are
continued to a common point somewhere, say at z� D zn=2. There the two solutions
will have neither the same value x.z�/ nor the same derivative .dx=d z/�. Since
the differential equation is linear and homogeneous, we can multiply one of the
</p>
<p>solutions by a constant factor such that both get the same value at z�. But then they
probably still disagree in .dx=d z/�. Agreement in the derivatives can be achieved by
gradually improving˝ , carrying out new integrations, and so on. By such iterations
</p>
<p>a solution for the whole interval can be obtained.
</p>
<p>Whether by such a procedure one arrives at the fundamental or at an overtone
</p>
<p>depends in general on the trial˝�. If it is near the fundamental, we will end up with
the fundamental eigenvalue and eigenfunction. In any case the number of nodes will
</p>
<p>reveal which mode has been found.
</p>
<p>Since (40.34) is linear and homogeneous, the solution may be multiplied by an
</p>
<p>arbitrary constant factor, in which way we can normalize the solution such that at the
</p>
<p>surface x.zn/ D 1. For the polytrope n D 3 the eigenfunctions of different modes
for &#13;ad D 5=3 are shown in Fig. 40.2 and the eigenfunction of the fundamental for
different values of &#13;ad is displayed in Fig. 40.3.
</p>
<p>The variation of &#13;ad is indeed important. To see this, we assume an ideal
</p>
<p>monatomic gas with radiation pressure as discussed in Chap. 13. From (13.7),
</p>
<p>(13.12) and (13.15) we find after some algebra that

</p>
<p>For the limit cases ˇ D 1 .Prad D 0/ and ˇ D 0 .Pgas D 0/ the adiabatic exponent
&#13;ad takes the values 5=3 and 4=3, respectively. We see that our assumption &#13;ad D
constant throughout the model holds only as long as ˇ D constant. Fortunately this
is the case for the polytrope n D 3, since 1 � ˇ � T 4=P and T � !;P � !nC1.

<p>Non-adiabatic Spherical Pulsations
</p>
<p>When a star oscillates, its mass elements will generally not change their properties
</p>
<p>adiabatically. The outward-goingheat flow, as well as the nuclear energy production,
</p>
<p>is modulated by the rhythm of the pulsation, and both effects cause deviations from
</p>
<p>adiabaticity. However, since the pulsation takes place on the hydrostatic timescale,
</p>
<p>which is short compared to �KH, the deviations from adiabaticity should be small in
</p>
<p>most parts of the stellar interior. In order to demonstrate the main effects of the non-
</p>
<p>adiabatic terms on the equation of motion, we discuss them at first for the simple
</p>
<p>piston model.
</p>
<p>41.1 Vibrational Instability of the Piston Model
</p>
<p>We go back to the description of Sect. 25.2.2. Equation (25.14) gives three eigen-
</p>
<p>values � for non-adiabatic oscillations of the piston model. The adiabatic period
</p>
<p>� D ˙�ad D ˙i!ad (with !2ad &gt; 0) would be obtained for eP D eT D 0. For
small non-adiabatic terms eP and eT we now write � D �r ˙ �ad as in (25.15) and
assume that the real part is small, j�rj � !ad. Then, neglecting terms of the order
�3r ; �

</p>
<p>Therefore, since rad &gt; 0, one has �r &lt; 0, meaning that the oscillation is damped.
During each cycle heat leaves and enters the gas in the container by way of the leak,
</p>
<p>kinetic energy of the piston is lost and added to the surroundings as heat.
</p>
<p>Similarly in a star the flow of heat modulated by the oscillation can damp the
</p>
<p>motion. Since the deviation from adiabaticity is more pronounced in the outer
</p>
<p>regions, the damping time is determined by the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz timescale of
</p>
<p>the outer layers. In his classic book, Eddington (1926) estimated that the damping
</p>
<p>time of ı Cephei stars would be of the order of 8,000 years and concluded that there
</p>
<p>must exist a mechanism which maintains their pulsations. He actually discussed two
</p>
<p>possible mechanisms which can be easily demonstrated with the piston model.
</p>
<p>The first is called the � mechanism, since here it is the modulated absorption of
</p>
<p>radiation which can yield vibrational instability.
</p>
<p>If for the sake of simplicity we assume that � D "0 D 0, then according to
(25.13) one has eP D �0F�P ; eT D �0F �T , and therefore (41.3) becomes
</p>
<p>2u0�r D �0F.rad�T C �P /: (41.5)
</p>
<p>The model is vibrationally unstable .�r &gt; 0/ if (rad�T C �P / &gt; 0. This means that
the instability occurs if during adiabatic compression .d lnP &gt; 0/ the absorption
</p>
<p>coefficient increases: d ln � D .rad�T C �P /d ln P &gt; 0. Then in the compressed
state more energy is absorbed than in equilibrium and the ensuing expansion
</p>
<p>is slightly enhanced. For analogous reasons the state of maximum expansion is
</p>
<p>followed by an enhanced compression.
</p>
<p>In stars the outgoing radiative flux can similarly cause an instability if the stellar
</p>
<p>opacity increases/decreases during the phase of contraction/expansion. As we shall
</p>
<p>see (Sect. 41.4), this is the mechanism which indeed drives the ı Cephei stars.
</p>
<p>In the so-called "mechanism the possible cause for an instability is the modulated
</p>
<p>nuclear energy generation. In order to discuss a simple case, we assume � D �0 D 0
and find from (41.3) with (25.13) that

</p>

<p>41.2 The Quasi-adiabatic Approximation 531
</p>
<p>non-adiabatic effects in a pulsating star are small, and as in the piston model one
</p>
<p>can expect that the oscillations are almost adiabatic, as described in Chap. 40. But
</p>
<p>the non-adiabatic effects will cause a small deviation of the eigenfrequency from the
</p>
<p>adiabatic value. Indeed, since the temperature variations are different in different
</p>
<p>regions of the star, these regions exchange an additional heat which&ndash;like the heat
</p>
<p>flow through the leak&ndash;causes a damping (radiative damping). A destabilizing effect
</p>
<p>on the star is caused by those regions where the opacity increases during contraction
</p>
<p>(� mechanism) as well as those with a nuclear burning where " increases during
</p>
<p>contraction (" mechanism).
</p>
<p>41.2 The Quasi-adiabatic Approximation
</p>
<p>In order to determine the vibrational stability behaviour of a star, one has to solve the
</p>
<p>four ordinary differential equations (25.19)&ndash;(25.22) for the perturbations p, x, �, #
</p>
<p>together with homogeneous boundary conditions at the centre and at the surface. In
</p>
<p>addition to the &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; boundary conditions (40.13) and (40.14) one has at the
</p>
<p>centre
</p>
<p>l0� D 0 at m D 0: (41.7)
</p>
<p>As a rough outer boundary condition one can assume that at the surface the relation
</p>
<p>L D 4�R2�T 4 holds throughout the oscillation period, yielding
</p>
<p>l D 2x C 4#: (41.8)
</p>
<p>This relation is not exactly true, since the photosphere (where T D Teff) does not
always belong to the same mass shell during the oscillation. With a more detailed
</p>
<p>theory of the behaviour of the atmosphere during the oscillations one can replace
</p>
<p>(41.8) by another, but also linear and homogeneous, outer boundary condition.
</p>
<p>The homogeneous linear equations (25.19)&ndash;(25.22) and boundary conditions
</p>
<p>(40.13), (40.14) and (41.7), (41.8) define an eigenvalue problem for the eigen-
</p>
<p>value !.
</p>
<p>Here we will restrict ourselves to a simplified treatment, the quasi-adiabatic
</p>
<p>approximation. For the given unperturbed equilibrium model we first solve the
</p>
<p>adiabatic problem described in Chap. 40, thereby obtaining a set of adiabatic

</p>
<p>though keeping in mind that the procedure described here and in Sect. 41.3 can be
</p>
<p>carried out for each of the adiabatic eigenvalues. Of course, the real oscillations
</p>
<p>will not proceed exactly adiabatically, which, for example, is shown in luminosity
</p>
<p>perturbations. To determine an approximation to the relative luminosity perturbation
</p>
<p>� we differentiate #ad with respect to m and find from (25.22)

<p>532 41 Non-adiabatic Spherical Pulsations
</p>
<p>In this quasi-adiabatic approximation, therefore, the non-adiabatic effects
</p>
<p>determining � are calculated from adiabatic eigenfunctions. The correct procedure
</p>
<p>would require the use of non-adiabatic eigenfunctions on the right-hand side of
</p>
<p>(41.9), while in a strictly adiabatic case we would expect � D �ad D 0. One can use
the non-adiabatic variation � of the local luminosity in order to estimate the change
</p>
<p>of ! due to non-adiabatic effects.
</p>
<p>For this, one assumes the star to be forced into a periodic oscillation. If non-
</p>
<p>adiabatic processes are taken into account, periodicity can only be maintained if,
</p>
<p>during each cycle, energy is added to or removed from the whole star. If energy has
</p>
<p>to be added to maintain a periodic oscillation, the star is damped; if energy has to be
</p>
<p>removed, it is excited. In order to determine the energy necessary for maintaining a
</p>
<p>periodic pulsation one defines the energy integral.
</p>
<p>41.3 The Energy Integral
</p>
<p>Suppose we want to make a star undergo periodic radial pulsations. If it is
</p>
<p>vibrationally unstable, then during each cycle a certain amountW of energy has to
</p>
<p>be taken out to maintain periodicity. If the star is vibrationally stable, the energy
</p>
<p>�W has to be fed into the star during each period to avoid a damping of the
amplitude. In both cases W is the energy to be taken out to overcome excitation
</p>
<p>or damping. Therefore, if the star is left alone, W &gt;0 gives amplitudes increasing
</p>
<p>in time (excitation) while for W &lt; 0 the oscillation is damped.
</p>
<p>To determineW we consider a shell of mass dm which gains the energy dq=dt
</p>
<p>per units of mass and time. The energy gained per unit mass per cycle is the integral
</p>
<p>of (dq=dt/dt taken over one cycle. Therefore the energy
</p>
<p>dW D dm
I
dq
</p>
<p>dt
dt (41.10)
</p>
<p>has to be taken out of the mass shell to maintain periodicity. If we replace dq=dt by

<p>dt
D �cos!t d.l0�/
</p>

<p>It is obvious that this integral vanishes: in the linear approximation there is neither

<p>41.3 The Energy Integral 533
</p>
<p>However, owing to a trick invented by Eddington it is still possible to determine
</p>
<p>the second-order quantity W with the help of solutions of the first-order theory.
</p>
<p>Since in the adiabatic case the eigenvalues are real, the time dependence of x, p, # ,
</p>
<p>and according to (41.9) that of �, can be expressed by the factor cos !t .

</p>
<p>of ds over one cycle vanishes exactly.We nowwrite ds D dq=T . Since we use only
solutions of the adiabatic case, we can consider the variation of T as real and can
</p>
<p>write T D T0.1 C #ad cos !t), which is correct in the first order. With the (real)
adiabatic solutions xad , pad, and #ad according to (41.9), � also is real, and therefore

<p>This equation is exact in the second order. It therefore proves (41.13). Should the

<p>integral on the left of (41.13) vanish in the first order, its value in the second order is
</p>
<p>given by the integral on the right of (41.13), which does not vanish.We can therefore

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>534 41 Non-adiabatic Spherical Pulsations
</p>
<p>41.3.1 The � Mechanism
</p>
<p>We consider here regions of the star in which no energy generation takes place
</p>
<p>("0 D 0) and therefore in which l0 D constant. Since the adiabatic equations for the
determination of x, p, # are linear and homogeneous, the solutions are determined
</p>
<p>only up to a common factor. We choose it here such that xad D 1 at the surface.
We further choose the initial point of time such that the maximal expansion of the
</p>
<p>surface is at t D 0. Then the first equation of (25.17) can be written r D r0.1C xad
cos !t), and for x &gt; 0 (expansion) the variations #ad and pad are certainly &lt; 0
</p>
<p>there. Since, for the fundamental, #ad.&lt; 0/ does not change sign throughout the
</p>
<p>star, one can immediately see from (41.16) that a region where � increases outwards
</p>
<p>(d�=dm &gt; 0) gives a positive contribution to W : such a region has an excitational
</p>
<p>effect on the oscillation, while regions with d�=dm &lt; 0 have a damping influence.
</p>
<p>The last two terms on the right of (41.9) together with #ad D radpad can be
written as
</p>
<p>4radpad � .�P Crad�T /pad: (41.17)
</p>
<p>Note that the term in parenthesis is identical with a term we encountered in (41.5)
</p>
<p>for the piston model. If for the sake of simplicity we assume �P , �T , rad to be
constant and observe that, for the fundamental, pad &lt; 0 increases inwards, then
</p>
<p>for �P C rad�T &gt; 0 the term �.�P C rad�T /pad &gt; 0 gives a contribution
that helps to increase � in an inward direction. This has a stabilizing effect. The
</p>
<p>term 4radpad &lt; 0 in (41.17) decreases with pad in an outward direction and has a
damping effect independently of �. This damping corresponds to the effect of the
</p>
<p>leak in the piston model.
</p>
<p>The � mechanism is responsible for several groups of variable stars. Before we
</p>
<p>discuss its effect on real stars we shall first deal with the other mechanism that can
</p>
<p>maintain stellar pulsations.

<p>The terms in the energy integral discussed in Sect. 41.3.1 appear everywhere in a

case whereW" becomes important in Sect. 41.5.
</p>
<p>41.4 Stars Driven by the � Mechanism: The Instability Strip
</p>
<p>If one has determined the adiabatic amplitudes for a given stellar model, one can
</p>
<p>derive � from (41.9) and evaluate W according to (41.16). We shall first describe
</p>
<p>the influence of different layers.
</p>
<p>In the outer layers, where deviations from adiabaticity are biggest, the �
</p>
<p>mechanism and the damping term 4radpad in (41.17) become important and the
sign of .�P C rad�T / determines whether the � mechanism acts to damp or to
excite. To illustrate this it is useful not only to plot on a lg P &ndash;1g T diagram
</p>
<p>lines of constant opacity but also to indicate at each point the slope given by
</p>
<p>rad D .d lgT=d lgP/ad as in Fig. 41.1. The � mechanism provides excitation if one
comes to higher opacities when going along the slope towards higher pressure. For
</p>
<p>a monatomic gas one has rad D 0:4: However, ionization reduces rad appreciably
(see Fig. 14.1b), which according to Fig. 41.1 favours instability. This is easily seen
</p>
<p>for a simple Kramers opacity with �P D 1 and �T D �4:5: then the decisive term
(�P Crad�T ) is �0:8 for rad D 0:4, while it is � 0 for rad � 0:222.
</p>
<p>In the near-surface layers of a star with an effective temperature of about 5,000K,
</p>
<p>there are two regions where ionization, together with a suitable form of the function
</p>
<p>� D �(P , T ), acts in the direction of instability. The outer one is quite close
to the surface, where hydrogen is partially ionized, followed immediately by the
</p>
<p>first ionization of helium (see Fig. 14.1, which is plotted for the Sun). Below this
</p>
<p>ionization zone, rad goes back to its standard value of 0.4. But still deeper another
region of excitation occurs caused by the second ionization of helium. This turns
</p>
<p>out to be the region which contributes most to instability. In still deeper layers
</p>
<p>the � mechanism has a damping effect, but their influence is very small, since the
</p>
<p>oscillations become more adiabatic the deeper one penetrates into the star. For an
</p>
<p>estimate of the right depth of the Hell ionization zone, see Cox (1967) and Sect. 27.7
</p>
<p>of Cox and Giuli (1968).

In order that excitation wins over damping it is necessary that the zones of

<p>ionization, which provide the excitation, contain a sufficient part of the mass of
</p>
<p>the star. This means that these zones have to be situated at suitable depths, and since
</p>
<p>ionization is mainly a function of temperature, we can conclude that it is essentially
</p>
<p>a question of the surface temperature that decides whether a star is vibrationally
</p>
<p>stable or unstable via the � mechanism.
</p>
<p>Let us compare stellar models of the same mass (say in the range 5&ndash;10Mˇ),
of roughly the same luminosity, and consider values for the effective temperature
</p>
<p>which range from the main sequence to the Hayashi line. At the main sequence and
</p>
<p>in some range to the right of it, the outer layers of the stars are too hot: hydrogen is
</p>
<p>fully ionized far up into the atmosphere, and even the second ionization of helium is
</p>
<p>almost complete up to the photosphere. Therefore the � mechanism due to ionization</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>538 41 Non-adiabatic Spherical Pulsations
</p>
<p>ionization zones are located such that their excitation overcomes the damping of
</p>
<p>the other layers: such stars start to pulsate with increasing amplitude. This critical
</p>
<p>temperature, which decreases slightly with increasing luminosity, defines the left
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;blue&rdquo;) border of an instability region in which W &gt; 0. This border coincides
</p>
<p>roughly with the left border of the strip in which the observed Cepheids are
</p>
<p>located.
</p>
<p>When considering models with still lower effective temperatures, one has to keep
</p>
<p>in mind that (41.9) only holds in radiative regions. To determine the influence of
</p>
<p>convective layers a theory of time-dependent convection is necessary. In particular
</p>
<p>such a theory should tell us whether in a given convective layer the energy transport
</p>
<p>is less or more efficient when the star is compressed. Since at present no reliable
</p>
<p>time-dependent theory for convection is available, one has to realize that the energy
</p>
<p>integralW � W� becomes unreliable if convection becomes important in the layers
where the � mechanism would be effective. Consequently predictions of the right
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;red&rdquo;) border of the instability strip are not reliable.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, attempts have been made to determine the influence of convection,
</p>
<p>by using some formulations of time-dependent mixing-length theory. For example,
</p>
<p>Bono et al. (1999) computed non-adiabatic, non-linear pulsations of classical
</p>
<p>Cepheid models, using the treatment of time-dependent convection described in
</p>
<p>an earlier paper (Bono and Stellingwerf 1994) about RR Lyrae stars. They could
</p>
<p>indeed determine a more realistic red edge of the instability strip than the one found
</p>
<p>when only the radiative energy transport is considered. While for these classical
</p>
<p>radial pulsators convection has a damping effect, convection can also contribute to
</p>
<p>the excitation. This is in particular true for white dwarf pulsators, where convective
</p>
<p>time scales can be much shorter than that of pulsation (see Dupret et al. 2008, and
</p>
<p>Aerts et al. 2010, Sect. 3.7.3, for more on this subject).
</p>
<p>In any case it is well established that there is an instability strip with a probable
</p>
<p>width of a few 102K, not too far from, and roughly parallel to, the Hayashi
</p>
<p>line, extending through almost all of the HR diagram (cf. Figs. 31.4 and 33.11).
</p>
<p>All stellar models evolving into this strip will become vibrationally unstable via
</p>
<p>the � mechanism and start to pulsate. In order to predict that we can observe a
</p>
<p>corresponding pulsating star, the passage through the strip has to be slow enough.
</p>
<p>This is fulfilled for models of typically 5 : : : 10Mˇ, which during the phase
of helium burning loop away from and back to the Hayashi line, thereby passing
</p>
<p>through the instability strip at least twice. These passages, in which models represent
</p>
<p>the classical Cepheids, are discussed in detail in Sect. 31.3. Depending on M , the
</p>
<p>passages occur at quite different luminosities: the largerM , the higherL. Using the
</p>
<p>adiabatic approximation one can easily determine the periods of the fundamental
</p>
<p>for models of very different L inside the instability strip. In this way one obtains
</p>
<p>a theoretical period&ndash;luminosity relation that is in satisfying agreement with the
</p>
<p>observed one. It is interesting to note that the passages through the instability strip
</p>
<p>do not follow lines of R D constant. Since the radius and therefore the mean
density changes, the period&ndash;density relations predict a certain amount of change
</p>
<p>(in both directions) of the period of a Cepheid. This period change, of the order of
</p>
<p>seconds per year, has been determined from long-term monitoring of Cepheids and</p>

<p>41.4 Stars Driven by the � Mechanism: The Instability Strip 539
</p>
<p>is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions (e.g. Pietrukowicz 2001, and
</p>
<p>references therein).
</p>
<p>Of much smaller mass are the helium-burning stars located on the horizontal
</p>
<p>branches of the HR diagrams of globular clusters. Where these branches intersect the
</p>
<p>downward continuation of the instability strip, at an effective temperature between
</p>
<p>6,000 and 7,500K, one finds the RR Lyrae stars (Sect. 33.7). Like the classical
</p>
<p>Cepheids these are pulsating stars driven by the � mechanism. For a monograph
</p>
<p>see Smith (1995).
</p>
<p>Even further down in the HR diagram, in the region of the main sequence, the
</p>
<p>instability strip is marked by another group of observed pulsating stars, the so-called
</p>
<p>ı Scuti stars or dwarf Cepheids.
</p>
<p>Above the location of the RR Lyrae stars in the HR diagram of globular
</p>
<p>clusters one sometimes finds stars which lie in the instability strip and are therefore
</p>
<p>pulsating: the BL Herculis and W Virginis stars (see footnote on page 414).
</p>
<p>In contrast to the classical Cepheids, which belong to population I, these stars are
</p>
<p>of population II (and are called Type II Cepheids). It is not surprising that they
</p>
<p>do not obey the same period&ndash;luminosity relation as Cepheids. According to the
</p>
<p>evolutionary considerations of Sect. 33.7 they are low-mass stars in an evolutionary
</p>
<p>stage later than that of the horizontal branch. They obviously have lower masses than
</p>
<p>the Cepheids, which have travelledmore or less horizontally from themain sequence
</p>
<p>into the instability strip. Let us assume that at the same point inside the instability
</p>
<p>strip there are two stars, a population I star of, say, 7Mˇ and a population II star
of, say, 0:8Mˇ. The � mechanism will make both of them pulsate. Being at the
same point in the HR diagram, the two stars have the same radii. Therefore the
</p>
<p>population II star has the lower mean density and according to the period&ndash;density
</p>
<p>relation a longer period than the population I star, although their luminosities are
</p>
<p>the same. Since the luminosity increases with the period, it follows that pulsating
</p>
<p>population I stars have a higher luminosity than pulsating population II stars of the
</p>
<p>same period. In the history of astronomy the clarification of this difference between
</p>
<p>the two period&ndash;luminosity relations caused the revision of the cosmic distance scale
</p>
<p>by W. Baade in 1944. This increase of the cosmic distance scale amounted to no
</p>
<p>less than a factor of 2, which caused the comment &ldquo;The Lord made the universe&ndash;but
</p>
<p>Baade doubled it&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Up to now we have based our considerations on a linear quasi-adiabatic
</p>
<p>approximation. In the linear theory the amplitude of the solution is not determined
</p>
<p>and the time dependence is given by almost sinusoidal oscillations with amplitudes
</p>
<p>growing or decreasing very slowly in time. In reality a vibrationally unstable star
</p>
<p>would start to oscillate with increasing amplitudes until the oscillations had grown
</p>
<p>so much that they could not be described by a linear theory any more. Once the
</p>
<p>non-linear terms in the equations have become important, they have the effect of
</p>
<p>limiting the increase of amplitudes and causing a time dependence of the solutions
</p>
<p>which differs considerably from sinusoidal behaviour. Indeed the light curves of
</p>
<p>most of the observed pulsating stars have constant amplitude and are far from being
</p>
<p>sinusoidal.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>540 41 Non-adiabatic Spherical Pulsations
</p>
<p>Attempts have been made to reproduce the observed light curves of Cepheids
</p>
<p>by solving the non-linear equations numerically with varied parameters. A special
</p>
<p>goal was to determine the masses of Cepheids by comparing their observed light
</p>
<p>curves with computed ones (see Christy 1975; Bono et al. 2000, and related work).
</p>
<p>Such comparisons seem to indicate lower masses for Cepheids than expected from
</p>
<p>evolution theory, but as we have seen in Sect. 31.3, overshooting and/or mass loss
</p>
<p>help to solve this problem.
</p>
<p>Besides the linearization of the equations, we have additionally simplified the
</p>
<p>problem of pulsations by applying the quasi-adiabatic approximation. With some
</p>
<p>more effort, however, one can also solve the full set of linear non-adiabatic
</p>
<p>equations. These four equations demand four linear boundary conditions. If they are
</p>
<p>properly chosen, one obtains one complex eigenvalue!. Since the time dependence
</p>
<p>is given by exp(i!t), the imaginary part !I of ! determines vibrational stability.
</p>
<p>The energy integral (41.12), computed with the function � obtained from (41.9),
</p>
<p>is connected to !I when one is close to the adiabatic case (Baker and Kippenhahn
</p>
<p>1962). In most cases the quasi-adiabatic approximation seems to be sufficient. If,
</p>
<p>however, pure helium stars cross the instability strip, the oscillations are far from
</p>
<p>being adiabatic, and therefore the quasi-adiabatic approximation becomes very
</p>
<p>unreliable. This can become important, for instance, if the oscillations of stars of
</p>
<p>the type R Coronae Borealis are being investigated (Weiss 1987).
</p>
<p>As the �-mechanism depends on the detailed shape of the &ldquo;opacity mountain&rdquo;,
</p>
<p>it is important to have accurate opacity data. Norman Simon in 1982 wrote a paper
</p>
<p>entitled A plea for reaexamining heavy element opacities in stars (Simon 1982),
</p>
<p>in which he showed that an increase in opacities by a factor of 2 and 3 in the
</p>
<p>temperature region between 105 and 2 � 106K would solve two long-standing
problems: the mismatch between predicted and observed period ratios for the
</p>
<p>fundamental and first overtone pulsations of classical Cepheids (so-called &ldquo;double
</p>
<p>mode Cepheids&rdquo;), and that between second overtone and fundamental for the &ldquo;bump
</p>
<p>Cepheids&rdquo;. He suggested that the opacities of metals were underestimated in the
</p>
<p>then existing opacity tables. As a consequence new Rosseland mean opacities were
</p>
<p>computed (which we discussed in Sect. 17.8), and indeed the problem was solved
</p>
<p>(Moskalik et al. 1992)! Additionally, the long-sought excitation mechanism for
</p>
<p>the so-called ˇ Cepheids (pulsating main-sequence stars of 7&ndash;10Mˇ and spectral
type B) was found (Moskalik and Dziembowski 1992; Kiriakidis et al. 1992): as the
</p>
<p>reason the bump around lgT � 5:3 (see Fig. 17.6) was identified, which is due to
absorption of photons by abundant metals such as C, N, Ne, and Fe. This &ldquo;metal&rdquo;
</p>
<p>or &ldquo;iron bump&rdquo; was missing in earlier opacity tables. The new opacities, required in
</p>
<p>order to understand stellar pulsations, had far-reaching consequences: they helped
</p>
<p>to compute very accurate solar models as well as improved isochrones for globular
</p>
<p>clusters.</p>

<p>41.5 Stars Driven by the "Mechanism 541
</p>
<p>41.5 Stars Driven by the " Mechanism
</p>
<p>In most stars the " mechanism discussed in Sects. 41.1 and 41.3.2 cannot overcome
</p>
<p>the damping, the reason being that it only works in the central regions of the stars
</p>
<p>where nuclear energy is released. But there the amplitudes of the oscillations are
</p>
<p>usually very small compared to the amplitudes in the near-surface regions, which&ndash;
</p>
<p>if the star is not in the instability strip&ndash;damp the oscillations by way of the �
</p>
<p>mechanism.
</p>
<p>Figure 40.3 shows that for polytropes for which the radiation pressure can
</p>
<p>be neglected, the amplitude ratio xcentre=xsurface is small, while it increases with
</p>
<p>decreasing ' until the ratio becomes 1 for ' D 0 (negligible gas pressure). Since
the integrand of the energy integral is quadratic in the amplitudes of the oscillations,
</p>
<p>we can expect that the " mechanism becomes more important the larger the fraction
</p>
<p>of the radiation pressure.
</p>
<p>This is of importance at the upper end of the hydrogen main sequence
</p>
<p>(Sect. 22.4), because for such stars, the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure
</p>
<p>strongly increases with M . Numerical calculations with realistic stellar models
</p>
<p>instead of polytropes indicate that the " mechanism makes the main-sequence
</p>
<p>stars pulsate if their mass exceeds a critical value of about 60Mˇ (Schwarzschild
and Härm 1959); this value depends on the chemical composition. Baraffe et al.
</p>
<p>(2001) found that metal-free (Pop. III) stars may even be as massive as a few
</p>
<p>hundred Mˇ without losing substantial amounts of material during their main-
sequence lifetime. The reason is that these stars burn hydrogen at much higher
</p>
<p>central temperatures, where the H-burning reactions have a lower dependency on
</p>
<p>temperature (see Fig. 18.8), a fact which reduces "P Crad"T and thus stabilizes the
star.
</p>
<p>Why, then, do we not see pulsating stars in the extension of the main sequence
</p>
<p>towards higher luminosities? Non-linear pulsation calculations (Appenzeller 1970;
</p>
<p>Ziebarth 1970) indicate that the amplitudes would grow until, with each cycle, a thin
</p>
<p>mass shell is thrown into space. This would continue until the total mass is reduced
</p>
<p>to the critical mass of, say, 60Mˇ. Then the pulsation would stop. However, the
growth rates of the pulsations are probably longer than the main-sequence lifetime.
</p>
<p>It is therefore unclear whether the "-mechanism really sets an upper limit to the
</p>
<p>mass range on the main sequence.
</p>
<p>Similarly the onset of a vibrational instability due to the " mechanism may also
</p>
<p>limit the helium main sequence towards largeM (see Sect. 23.1). The critical upper
</p>
<p>mass for helium stars depends on the content of heavier elements and may lie
</p>
<p>between 7 and 8Mˇ (Boury and Ledoux 1965).</p>

<p>Non-radial Stellar Oscillations
</p>
<p>We use spherical coordinates r; #; ' and describe the velocity of a mass element
</p>
<p>by a vector v having the components vr ; v# ; v' . For the radial pulsations treated
</p>
<p>in the foregoing sections, the velocity has only one non-vanishing component, vr ;
</p>
<p>which depends only on r . This is so specialized a motion that one might wonder
</p>
<p>why a star should prefer to oscillate this way at all. In fact it is easier to imagine the
</p>
<p>occurrence of perturbations that are not spherically symmetric, for example, those
</p>
<p>connected with turbulent motions or local temperature fluctuations. They can lead
</p>
<p>to non-radial oscillations, i.e. oscillatory motions having in general non-vanishing
</p>
<p>components vr ; v# ; v' , all of which can depend on r; # , and '. It is obvious that the

<p>treatment of the more general non-radial oscillations is much more involved than

<p>that of the radial case, but they certainly play a role in observed phenomena (see

from the boundary conditions. This constitutes an eigenvalue problem with the

<p>eigenvalue �2.
</p>
<p>Note that it is the assumption of adiabaticity which has reduced the problem to
</p>
<p>4th order in the spatial variables. For the full non-adiabatic case one additionally
</p>
<p>has to consider the perturbations of the temperature and of the energy-flux vector.
</p>
<p>The perturbed energy equation contains first derivatives with respect to time, which
</p>
<p>according to (42.15) give terms multiplied by i!. Therefore the equations become
</p>
<p>complex and the non-adiabatic problem is of order 12 in real variables. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, for l D 0, one obtains the adiabatic radial oscillations, for which the problem
is reduced to second order.
</p>
<p>42.3 The Eigenspectra
</p>
<p>For adiabatic non-radial oscillations we have obtained an eigenvalue problem of
</p>
<p>4th order in the spatial variables and non-linear in the eigenvalue !2 (or the
</p>
<p>dimensionless �2). The problem can be shown to be self-adjoint, so that the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42.3 The Eigenspectra 549
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions are orthogonal to one another. They have been found to form a
</p>
<p>complete set if complemented by the toroidal modes.
</p>
<p>The eigenvalues obey an extremal principle. The self-adjointness assures that all
</p>
<p>eigenvalues are real. This means that the motion is either purely periodic (!2 &gt; 0,
</p>
<p>! real: dynamical stability) or purely aperiodic (!2 &lt; 0, ! imaginary: dynamical
</p>
<p>instability).
</p>
<p>Neither the equations (42.25)&ndash;(42.28) nor the boundary conditions contain
</p>
<p>explicitly the orderm of the spherical harmonics. Therefore to each eigenvalue of a
</p>
<p>given l correspond 2l C 1 solutions (for the different m values �l; : : : 0; : : : ;Cl).
This degeneracy can be removed, for example, by centrifugal or tidal forces.
</p>
<p>The general discussion is very much complicated by the fact that the eigenvalue
</p>
<p>� D �2 appears non-linearly in the set (42.25)&ndash;(42.28). In order to see the typical
properties of the eigenspectra, we use an approximation introduced by Cowling,
</p>
<p>assuming that the perturbation of the gravitational potential can be neglected. We
</p>
<p>then do not need (42.27), (42.28) and are left with a second-order problem. This
</p>
<p>approximation becomes the better, the more the oscillation is limited to the outer
</p>
<p>layers (e.g. high overtones of acoustic modes with sufficiently large l). The second-
</p>
<p>order problem still contains terms proportional to �2 [from (42.26)] and terms
</p>
<p>proportional to 1=�2 [from (42.25)]. In order to simplify this we consider two
</p>
<p>asymptotic cases (�2 ! 1 and �2 ! 0), in both of which the problem becomes of
the classical Sturm&ndash;Liouville type.
</p>
<p>For large �2 we neglect the terms proportional to 1=�2. The only coefficient
</p>
<p>containing � then is �2=c2s , with the velocity of sound given by c
2
s D &#13;adP=%. This
</p>
<p>problem has an infinite series of discrete eigenvalues�k D �2k , with an accumulation
point at infinity. Such oscillations are produced by acoustic waves propagating with
</p>
<p>cs. They are dominated by pressure variations and are therefore called p modes. For
</p>
<p>sufficiently simple stellar models, they are easily ordered as p1; p2; : : : ; pk where k
</p>
<p>is the number of nodes of their eigenfunction �r between centre and surface. They
</p>
<p>are analogous to the radial oscillations (l D 0), except for the dynamical stability:
while the radial fundamental is unstable for &#13;ad &lt; 4=3, the p modes are all stable
</p>
<p>under reasonable conditions.
</p>
<p>For small �2 we neglect the terms proportional to �2. The only coefficient
</p>
<p>containing � is now !2adl.l C 1/=.�2r2/, where !ad is the Brunt&ndash;Väisälä frequency
as introduced in Sect. 6.2. This problem has an infinite series of eigenvalues
</p>
<p>�k D 1=�2k , with an accumulation point at � D 1, i.e. at �2 D 0. The motions are
dominated by gravitational forces and are therefore called g modes (again ordered
</p>
<p>as g1; g2; : : : ; gk according to the number k of nodes).
</p>
<p>The stability of the g modes depends essentially on W , defined in (42.23).
</p>
<p>This quantity is connected with the problem of convective stability discussed in
</p>
<p>Chap. 6. One can easily verify from (6.18) that the Brunt&ndash;Väisälä frequency of an
</p>
<p>adiabatically oscillating mass element is given by

</p>
<p>And rW &gt; 0 is just the criterion (6.4) for convective instability against adiabatically
</p>
<p>displaced elements. If in the whole star W &lt; 0 (convective stability everywhere),
</p>
<p>then all g modes are stable (�2 &gt; 0; � real). Such modes are also called gC
</p>
<p>modes and are produced by propagating gravity waves. If the star contains a
</p>
<p>region where W &gt; 0 (convective instability), then unstable g� modes also exist
.�2 &lt; 0, � imaginary). So we see that convective stability (instability) coincides
</p>
<p>with dynamical stability (instability) of non-radial g modes; the onset of convection
</p>
<p>appears as the manifestation of unstable g modes.
</p>
<p>The non-linearity in � D �2 of the full set (42.25)&ndash;(42.28) implies that the eigen-
spectrum of stars is a combination of the above-described partial spectra: it contains
</p>
<p>high-frequency p modes as well as low-frequency g modes, which can be split up
</p>
<p>into the stable gC and the unstable g�. Between the p and g modes of relatively
simple stars there is another one, called the f mode, since it has no node between
</p>
<p>centre and surface (like the radial fundamental).
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the stable modes are produced by propagatingwaves. From
</p>
<p>the appropriate dispersion relations with horizontal wave numbers Œl.l C 1/&#141;1=2=r
one finds that for propagating acoustic waves ! � !0 WD 12cs.d ln%=dr/, and for
propagating gravity waves ! � !ad, where at any place !0 &gt; !ad. These conditions
define two main regions (G and A) of propagation inside a star: one in the deep
</p>
<p>interior for gravity waves the other in the envelope for acoustic waves (see Fig. 42.2).
</p>
<p>These regions act like cavities or resonators, inside which modes can be &ldquo;trapped&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>At certain frequencies (the eigenvalues), the propagating waves produce standing

<p>up, the maximum of the G region near the core increases far above the minimum
</p>
<p>of the A region in the envelope. Then the g1 mode can move above the p1 mode,

<p>etc. When they are close to each other, resonance effects provide that they exchange
</p>
<p>their properties and avoid an exact coincidence of the eigenvalues (avoided level

<p>rather involved, particularly for evolved stars.

<p>found at l D 0. For dipole oscillations (l D 1) the f mode must have � D 0, since
otherwise it would result in an oscillatory motion of the centre of gravity, which

<p>is not possible without external forces. However, oscillations having nodes outside
</p>
<p>the centre are possible for l D 1, since then, for example, the core always moves
in the opposite direction to the envelope such that the centre of gravity remains at

<p>552 42 Non-radial Stellar Oscillations
</p>
<p>42.4 Stars Showing Non-radial Oscillations
</p>
<p>When applying the above-described formalism to models of real stars, a basic
</p>
<p>question is whether such oscillations in fact proceed adiabatically. Strictly speaking,
</p>
<p>one would have to test the model for its vibrational stability and look for the
</p>
<p>imaginary part of ! derived in a full non-adiabatic treatment. This is, however, so
</p>
<p>cumbersome that one usually confines oneself to a quasi-adiabatic approximation,
</p>
<p>similar to that described for the radial case in Chap. 41: the adiabatically calculated
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions are used to determine an &ldquo;energy integral&rdquo;, describing the growth or
</p>
<p>damping rate of the amplitude.
</p>
<p>There is a variety of stars and stellar types that are known or suspected to undergo
</p>
<p>non-radial oscillations. We shall briefly mention a few of them.
</p>
<p>The best established group of non-radial oscillators are certain white dwarfs (cf.
</p>
<p>Van Horn 1984), among them the ZZ Ceti variables, which are of type DA. They
</p>
<p>exhibit periods typically between a few 102 and 103 s, often split up into close
</p>
<p>pairs. These periods are certainly too long for radial oscillations of white dwarfs,
</p>
<p>but can well be explained by gC modes. Rotation of the white dwarf splits them
up into oscillations with different order m. The corresponding gravity waves are
</p>
<p>&ldquo;trapped&rdquo; in a superficial hydrogen layer which, according to its thickness, acts as a
</p>
<p>resonator for certain modes. They are excited by the � mechanism in zones of partial
</p>
<p>ionization. Other groups of oscillating white dwarfs, of type DB and very hot ones,
</p>
<p>have also been found.
</p>
<p>The ˇ Cephei stars, which are situated somewhat above the upper main-
</p>
<p>sequence, are both radial and non-radial oscillators. Some of them also seem to show
</p>
<p>the effect of rotational mode splitting. We already mentioned them in Sect. 41.4.
</p>
<p>Non-radial oscillations are also found among the ı Scuti stars and some types of
</p>
<p>supergiants.
</p>
<p>The most prominent example of observed non-radial oscillations is our Sun
</p>
<p>(compare the early work by Christensen-Dalsgaard 1984; Deubner and Gough
</p>
<p>1984). Detailed spectral investigations of the solar surface have shown that, again
</p>
<p>and again, areas roughly 105 km across start oscillating in phase for some time.
</p>
<p>These oscillations are excited by the ongoing convective motions in the solar
</p>
<p>envelope, and although they are damped, they are constantly reappearing. Their
</p>
<p>lifetime is of order a few months. The first detected and best-known oscillations
</p>
<p>have periods around 5min. They represent standing acoustic waves trapped mainly
</p>
<p>in a region from somewhere below the photosphere down into the upper convective
</p>
<p>zone. Power spectra with ! plotted against the horizontal wave number show clearly
</p>
<p>that the phenomena contain mode oscillations with very many modes (many degrees
</p>
<p>l and radial orders k).
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thanks to constant monitoring of the solar surface by global net-
</p>
<p>works of solar telescopes, continuous observations from the south pole during
</p>
<p>the antarctic summer, and from space, have allowed to identify tens of thousand
</p>
<p>different modes, with l being as high as 1,500. Rotational splitting due to rotation,
</p>
<p>i.e. different m-modes, has been detected as well as possibly some g-modes.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42.4 Stars Showing Non-radial Oscillations 553
</p>
<p>These and low-degree p-modes have allowed a detailed analysis of the solar
</p>
<p>interior (known as helioseismology), of solar rotation, and more recently even
</p>
<p>local helioseismology where subsurface motions in the convective envelope are
</p>
<p>measured. Helioseismology has provided us with a detailed view into the solar
</p>
<p>interior. In Sect. 29.4, we already presented those results of helioseismology of
</p>
<p>relevance for the comparison with hydrostatic, spherically symmetric solar models.
</p>
<p>But the richness of helioseismology extends far beyond this. We are already learning
</p>
<p>about convective motions, magnetic fields, active regions, and more, thanks to the
</p>
<p>analysis of non-radial oscillations.
</p>
<p>In the future asteroseismology will allow similar views into the interior of other
</p>
<p>stars. Non-radial oscillations have already been found in many main-sequence stars
</p>
<p>(of which we mentioned a few classical classes above), but also in evolved stars,
</p>
<p>even in red giants. Asteroseismology will offer a unique opportunity to test stellar
</p>
<p>evolution theory.</p>

<p>Part X
</p>
<p>Stellar Rotation
</p>
<p>Rotation may influence the evolution of stars in two major aspects: it may, if
</p>
<p>sufficiently fast, affect the internal structure through an effective reduction of
</p>
<p>the gravitational pull towards the center. As a result, pressure and temperature
</p>
<p>will be different throughout the star. Second, it leads to additional mass flows,
</p>
<p>which may transport material between regions of stars that otherwise would not
</p>
<p>be connected. In particular the latter effect leads to observable modification of the
</p>
<p>surface composition of stars. This has led to a strong interest in rotation in stars.
</p>
<p>So far, full three-dimensional models of rotating stars are not available, but one-
</p>
<p>dimensional, simplified models do exist and seem to result in quite realistic models.
</p>
<p>As in the case of stellar pulsations, the following chapters about rotating stars
</p>
<p>provide only the basic concepts and some idealized cases. Maeder (2009) has written
</p>
<p>a full textbook on all aspects of rotating stars, which reflects the large progress made
</p>
<p>in this field, and covers the present sophisticated modelling.</p>

<p>Chapter 43
</p>
<p>The Mechanics of Rotating Stellar Models
</p>
<p>The theory of rotating bodies with constant densities (liquid bodies) has been
</p>
<p>investigated thoroughly by McLaurin, Jacobi, Poincaré, and Karl Schwarzschild.
</p>
<p>We first start with a summary of their results without deriving them.
</p>
<p>Most of the results have been obtained for solid-body rotation, i.e. for constant
</p>
<p>angular velocity ! of the self-gravitating liquid body. In this case the centrifugal
</p>
<p>acceleration c has a potential, say c D �rV with V D �s2!2=2; where s is the
distance from the axis of rotation. If ˚ is the gravitational potential, then according
</p>
<p>to the hydrostatic equation, the total potential � WD ˚ C V must be constant on the
surface. The main difficulty in determining the surface of a rotating liquid body lies
</p>
<p>with the gravitational potential, which in turn depends on the form of the surface.
</p>
<p>43.1 Uniformly Rotating Liquid Bodies
</p>
<p>For sufficiently slow rotation with constant angular velocity, the rotating liquid
</p>
<p>bodies are spheroids (i.e. axisymmetric ellipsoids) calledMcLaurin spheroids.
</p>
<p>In order to examine the behaviour of rotating liquid masses, we define their

<p>It is of the order of the ratio of centrifugal acceleration to gravity at the equator and
</p>
<p>is a measure of the &ldquo;strength&rdquo; of rotation.
</p>
<p>We now describe some results on the equilibrium configurations and their
</p>
<p>stability. The derivations and some details of the configurations can be found in
</p>
<p>the classic book by Jeans (1928) and in that of Lyttleton (1953).
</p>
<p>The shape of McLaurin spheroids is described by the eccentricity e of the
</p>
<p>meridional cross section,
</p>
<p>e2 D a
2 � c2
a2
</p>
<p>; (43.6)
</p>
<p>where a, c are the major and the minor half axes of the meridional cross section.
</p>
<p>A sequence of increasing e leads from the sphere (e D 0) to the plane parallel layer
(e D 1), and one can label each of these configurations by its value of �. But the
correspondence between e and � is not unique. For each value of � &lt; 0:2247 there
</p>
<p>exist two configurations with different values of e: For example, in the limit case
</p>
<p>of zero rotation with � D 0, the sphere as well as the infinite plane parallel layer
are two possible equilibria, the latter of which obviously is not stable. Along the
</p>
<p>series of increasing eccentricity e; neither � nor T is monotonic, but one can show
</p>
<p>that the angular momentum and Eg vary monotonically. Furthermore, ! does not
</p>
<p>vary monotonically with the total angular momentum: if we start with a liquid self-
</p>
<p>gravitating sphere (e D 0) and feed in angular momentum, the angular velocity,
and with it the eccentricity, increases. But once the eccentricity exceeds the value of
</p>
<p>0.9299, the angular velocity decreases again, even with further increasing angular
</p>
<p>momentum. The reason for this is that the momentum of inertia increases faster than
</p>
<p>the angular momentum, and therefore ! must decrease again.
</p>
<p>But long before this, namely at e D 0:8127 or at � D 0:1868, the McLaurin
spheroids become unstable. At this point the sequence of configurations shows a</p>

<p>bifurcation (Fig. 43.1): another branch of stable models occurs which have a quite
</p>
<p>different shape. They are triaxial ellipsoids, the so-called Jacobi ellipsoids. Beyond
</p>
<p>the point of bifurcation, a McLaurin spheroid is unstable, the Jacobi ellipsoid of
</p>
<p>the same mass and angular momentum having a lower total (macroscopic kinetic
</p>
<p>plus gravitational) energy. Therefore, if there is a mechanism like friction which
</p>
<p>can use up macroscopic energy and transform it into heat, the spheroids become
</p>
<p>ellipsoids. The transition takes place on the timescale of friction as defined in
</p>
<p>Chap. 45. In analogy to the case of a blob of excess molecular weight (see Sect. 6.5)
</p>
<p>in hydrostatic equilibrium with its surroundings, the motion is controlled by a
</p>
<p>dissipative process (there heat flow, here friction). One therefore calls the instability
</p>
<p>of the McLaurin spheroids also secular. Instead of the oblateness, one often uses
</p>
<p>the ratio � WD T=jEgj, which reaches the value 0.1376 at the point of bifurcation.
Stability analysis shows that if � exceeds another critical value (of about 0.16), the
</p>
<p>triaxial ellipsoids also become unstable and then assume a pear-shaped form (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 43.1).
</p>
<p>It should be noted that here we have interpreted sequences of varying dimension-
</p>
<p>less parameters e, �, � as sequences of models with increasing angular momentum,
</p>
<p>while mass and density were assumed to be constant. Models with the same
</p>
<p>dimensionless parameters can also be obtained by a sequence of increasing density,
</p>
<p>while mass and angular momentum are kept constant. In this way one can conclude
</p>
<p>from the foregoing discussion that a freely rotating body (mass and angular
</p>
<p>momentum constant) that contracts (density increasing) can start with slow rotation
</p>
<p>as a McLaurin spheroid, and can then become triaxial and finally pear-shaped.
</p>
<p>Indeed, before the Jacobi ellipsoids become long cigars they become dynamically
</p>
<p>unstable. An ensuing fission may then split the body in two.</p>

<p>since in stars the density increases towards the centre. Then solid-body rotation

<p>has different consequences, as we will see in Sect. 43.2. Numerical calculations,

The advantage of the Roche approximation is that the gravitational field is given

<p>independently of the rotation. Eccentricity does not affect gravity. In order to

</p>
<p>In order to see the rotational behaviour of the Roche model, let us start with very
</p>
<p>slow rotation so that the stellar surface lies safely within the critical equipotential.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>562 43 The Mechanics of Rotating Stellar Models
</p>
<p>If we speed up the rotation, the volume of the model star will grow, since
</p>
<p>centrifugal forces &ldquo;lift&rdquo; the matter and therefore reduce the effective gravity.We first
</p>
<p>ignore this effect, assuming that the stellar volume remains unchanged (in spite of
</p>
<p>the speed-up). Then with increasing !, according to (43.13) and (43.14), the critical
</p>
<p>surface will shrink and come closer to the surface of the model. Consequently the
</p>
<p>model surface becomes more and more oblate until it coincides with the critical
</p>
<p>surface. In reality the stellar volume will grow as the angular velocity speeds up and
</p>
<p>the model will reach its critical stage even earlier.
</p>
<p>A critically rotating star cannot hold the matter at the equator. What happens
</p>
<p>if then the angular velocity increases even more? From a first glance at Fig. 43.2
</p>
<p>one might expect that the matter can easily escape along equipotential surfaces into
</p>
<p>infinity. However, one has to keep in mind that the equipotentials plotted there only
</p>
<p>hold for solid-body rotation. If matter leaving the star at the equator were to be
</p>
<p>forced, say, by magnetic fields, to co-rotate, it would indeed be swept into space.
</p>
<p>But if there is no such mechanism, the matter would have to conserve its angular
</p>
<p>momentum and remain in the neighbourhood of the star. If ! D constant, the
centrifugal acceleration (� s) dominates over gravity (� s�2/ for large values of
s. But in the case of constant specific angular momentum .! � s�2/, the centrifugal
acceleration .!2s � s�3/ drops more steeply with s than gravity.
</p>
<p>We have here considered the case of a star with increasing angular velocity
</p>
<p>and constant (or increasing) volume. A more realistic case would be that a slowly
</p>
<p>rotating star contracts. If then its radius decreases, the angular velocity increases
</p>
<p>like R�2 while its critical surface shrinks proportionally to scr � !�2=3 � R4=3.
The critical surface therefore shrinks faster than the star, which will become more
</p>
<p>and more oblate until its surface is critical. Then the centrifugal force balances the
</p>
<p>gravitational one at the equator. With further shrinking, the star loses mass, which
</p>
<p>is left behind as a rotating disk in the equatorial plane. This is similar to Laplace&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>scenario of the pre-planetary nebula.
</p>
<p>43.3 Slowly Rotating Polytropes
</p>
<p>In a homogeneous gaseous sphere there is no density concentration towards the
</p>
<p>centre, while for the Roche model, the assumed density concentration is too extreme
</p>
<p>compared to that of real stars. Polytropes approximate real stars better, at least with
</p>
<p>respect to their density distribution. For slowly rotating polytropes (small values of
</p>
<p>�), equilibrium solutions have been found by solving ordinary differential equations
</p>
<p>for solid-body rotation.
</p>
<p>As in the case of the non-rotating polytropes (see Chap. 19), one has to solve
</p>
<p>the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential. But since the centrifugal
</p>
<p>acceleration according to (43.8) can be derived from the potential V , we combine
</p>
<p>˚ and V to obtain the total potential � as in (43.9). Then instead of (19.7), we have

</p>
<p>where es is a unit vector perpendicular to the axis of rotation (pointing outwards)

<p>and s is the distance from this axis. One can easily see that a sufficient and necessary

<p>566 44 The Thermodynamics of Rotating Stellar Models
</p>
<p>Equation (44.4) indicates that the vectorsrP and�r� are parallel. In other words,
the equipotential surfaces � = constant coincide with the surfaces of constant
</p>
<p>pressure, which means that the pressure is a function of � W P D P.�/. It then
follows that % D �dP=d� is also a function of � only. If we now have an ideal
gas, then T=� D P=.%&lt;/ is a function of � . In a chemically homogeneous star,
therefore, T D T .�/, i.e. the temperature is constant on equipotential surfaces.
</p>
<p>Since not T but T=� is constant on equipotentials, the temperature varies pro-
</p>
<p>portionally to � on these surfaces if the chemical composition is not homogeneous.
</p>
<p>We have already encountered this case in Sect. 6.5, where we dealt with a blob of
</p>
<p>material with a higher molecular weight than that in the surroundings. In the blob
</p>
<p>the temperature was higher.
</p>
<p>Note that this is a consequence of hydrostatic equilibrium: even small deviations
</p>
<p>from hydrostatic equilibrium can cause considerable temperature variations on
</p>
<p>equipotential surfaces, which can be seen in the case with negligible rotation. Then
</p>
<p>from (44.4) one can conclude that P; %; and T=� are constant on the equipotential
</p>
<p>surfaces of the gravitational field, say, of the earth. We know that if we light a
</p>
<p>match, the air on the horizontal equipotential planes intersecting the flame will not
</p>
<p>have the high temperature of the fire. The reason is that with the flame a circulation
</p>
<p>system is set up. With this motion, inertia terms disturb the equation of hydrostatic
</p>
<p>equilibrium. Although they cause only small perturbations, the inertia terms are
</p>
<p>sufficient to allow lower temperatures outside the flame.
</p>
<p>In the following we discuss only the case of strict hydrostatic equilibrium for
</p>
<p>a chemically homogeneous ideal gas and therefore have P D P.�/; % D %.�/,
T D T .�/.
</p>
<p>Note that the coincidence of P and % surfaces only holds if the rotation is

<p>conservative. Otherwise they are inclined to each other (see Sect. 45.2).

</p>
<p>cancel each other. This can be easily seen in the case of solid-body rotation, for
</p>
<p>which .s�1/d.s2w2/=ds is a constant, while .r�/2 always varies on equipotential
surfaces, the effective gravity at the equator being smaller than at the poles.
</p>
<p>The fact that radiative transport and the simple equation of energy conservation
</p>
<p>cannot be fulfilled simultaneously was first pointed out by Von Zeipel (1924) and
</p>
<p>is known as von Zeipel&rsquo;s theorem. The solution of the problem was independently
</p>
<p>found by Eddington (1925) and Vogt (1925).
</p>
<p>44.3 Meridional Circulation
</p>
<p>What is to be expected if (44.7) cannot be fulfilled? Then there must be regions in the
</p>
<p>star which would cool off, since radiation carries more energy out of a mass element
</p>
<p>than is generated by thermonuclear reactions. In other regions the mass elements
</p>
<p>would heat up. But cooling and heating cause buoyancy forces, and meridional
</p>
<p>motions occur in addition to rotation. In order to maintain a stationary state as
</p>
<p>assumed, one has to demand that meridional motions contribute to the energy
</p>
<p>transport. They carry away energy from regions where radiation cannot transport
</p>
<p>all the energy generated and they bring energy to regions which otherwise would
</p>
<p>cool off.
</p>
<p>In order to derive the velocity field of the circulation, we write the first law of
</p>
<p>thermodynamics in the co-moving frame:

</p>
<p>In order to solve the system (44.15)&ndash;(44.18), we split all the scalar functions into
</p>
<p>a spherically symmetric part (subscript 0) and one which is proportional to L2.#/:
</p>
<p>P.r; #/ D P0.r/C P2.r/L2.#/; T D T0 C T2L2; ˚ D ˚0 C˚2L2; (44.21)

</p>
<p>a spherically symmetric component, as can be seen from (44.19).
</p>
<p>We now ignore second-order effects and count the number of equations for
</p>
<p>the four &ldquo;spherical&rdquo; functions P0; T0; ˚0 and Fr0 and for the five &ldquo;non-spherical&rdquo;</p>

<p>(44.18) together with (44.21) and (44.22), if for the moment we ignore circulation

<p>(vr D 0). It is obvious that each of the two scalar equations (44.16) and (44.18)
gives two equations, a spherical one and a non-spherical one, though in the case of

<p>two &ldquo;non-spherical&rdquo; equations (44.24) and (44.25). The same holds for the vector
</p>
<p>equation (44.17). Altogether we have four equations for the four &ldquo;spherical&rdquo;
</p>
<p>functions but six equations for the five &ldquo;non-spherical&rdquo; functions. Obviously with
</p>
<p>vr D 0 the problem is overdetermined. In general it can only be solved if meridional
circulations are present; then the vr appearing in (44.16) is the sixth unknown &ldquo;non-
</p>
<p>spherical&rdquo; variable and the problem is no longer overdetermined. If vr is known, the
</p>
<p>continuity equation (44.14) together with (44.21) and (44.22) gives v# .
</p>
<p>44.5 The Eddington&ndash;Sweet Timescale
</p>
<p>To obtain an estimate of the velocity of the circulation, we restrict ourselves to slow
</p>
<p>rotation and to the conservative case. The estimate for the non-conservative case is
</p>
<p>more complicated, but the results are very similar. We also assume " D 0, which
holds for the outer layers. Therefore l D constant.
</p>
<p>We now can split each function A.r; #/ of the model uniquely into two terms:
</p>
<p>A.r; #/ D NA.�/C A�.r; #/; (44.26)
</p>
<p>where NA.�/ is the mean value of A.r; #/ over the surface � = constant, while the

<p>where we have omitted the subscript eff in the symbols g and Ng. We now split the
terms of (44.28) according to (44.26). r � F has to be zero in the steady state in
regions where there is no nuclear energy generation (otherwise it has to be equal
</p>
<p>to "%, a function which is also constant on � surfaces). But the term .r � F/�
can only be compensated by circulation. Indeed the circulation term in (44.13) is
</p>
<p>ŒcP%T .r � rad/=P &#141;rP0v. The integral of this term over equipotential surfaces
vanishes because of mass conservation, as does .r � F/�.

<p>We now estimate .r � F/� for slow rotation and take NF= Ng from the non-rotating
model, an approximation which introduces only errors of order �2, since in the

<p>(44.33) and (44.34) also hold for rotation laws which are not of the special form
</p>
<p>c1C c2=s2. But near the surface the first term on the right of (44.32) becomes small

</p>
<p>The same is true at the interfaces between radiative and convective regions where
</p>
<p>r D rad, which we have excluded in our rough estimate of the left-hand side of
(44.32). At these singularities the circulation speed would become so large that its
</p>
<p>inertia terms are important and (44.4) would no longer be valid.
</p>
<p>Another more serious restriction of our estimates of vr is the assumption of a
</p>
<p>certain time-independent angular-velocity distribution. If one starts, say, with ! D
constant, then circulation will occur, and by conservation of angular momentum, it
</p>
<p>will immediately change the angular-velocity distribution, which in turn demands
</p>
<p>another circulation pattern.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of the existence of meridional circulation in the theory of first
</p>
<p>order in � as given in Sect. 44.4 rested on counting the number of linear equations
</p>
<p>and the number of variables. We showed that without circulation the problem is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44.6 Meridional Circulation in Inhomogeneous Stars 573
</p>
<p>overdetermined. This, however, is only true if the linear equations are independent.
</p>
<p>But if ! is considered as a free function, it can be chosen in such a way that the
</p>
<p>equations become linearly dependent and in the first-order theory no circulation is
</p>
<p>necessary to fulfil the equations. In the (unrealistic) case " D constant, � D constant,
the stellar-structure equations for radiative energy transport lead to a polytrope of
</p>
<p>index n D 3. If " D constant, then l=m D constant and one has a very special
&ldquo;standard model&rdquo; as discussed in Sect. 19.5. It has been shown by Schwarzschild
</p>
<p>(1942) that, for this model, solid-body rotation does not demand circulation in the
</p>
<p>first-order theory. For other, more realistic stellar models, there are also angular-
</p>
<p>velocity distributions for which there is no meridional circulation in the first-order
</p>
<p>theory (Kippenhahn 1963).
</p>
<p>The linear dependence of the equations can also be achieved if for a given
</p>
<p>rotation law w, the molecular weight is considered a free function and chosen in
</p>
<p>an appropriate way. We will come to this problem in the next section.
</p>
<p>44.6 Meridional Circulation in Inhomogeneous Stars
</p>
<p>We have already estimated that for the Sun that �circ=�nucl � 102. But for more
massive main-sequence stars the situation changes. According to (44.34)
</p>
<p>�circ
</p>
<p>�nucl
� �KH
�nucl
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>�
� M

<p>1�˛
</p>
<p>�
� M
</p>
<p>0:4
</p>
<p>�
; (44.37)
</p>
<p>where we have assumed a mass-radius relation R � M ˛ and �KH � M 2=.RL/, as
can be derived from (3.19), and �nucl �M=L, and we have put ˛ D 0:6 for the upper
end of the main sequence (Sect. 22.1). Therefore, if we go from the Sun to higher
</p>
<p>masses, say, to 20Mˇ, then the ratio �circ=�nucl (which for the Sun is about 1/100)
increases by a factor 3.3. Observations of rotating B stars show that � is larger by
</p>
<p>a factor 105 than for the Sun. Therefore, �circ=�nucl drops below unity towards the
</p>
<p>upper end of the main sequence, so that the circulation is rapid enough to mix
</p>
<p>the star. As a consequence one should expect that the fuel is not only used up in
</p>
<p>the central region and the star should remain chemically homogeneous. But then the
</p>
<p>stars, while converting hydrogen into helium, should move in the HR diagram from
</p>
<p>the main sequence straight towards the helium main sequence [compare (20.20) and
</p>
<p>(20.21) forM D M 0]. But we know from observation that the stars leave the main
sequence moving towards the region of the red stars and not towards the region
</p>
<p>of the (blue) helium main sequence. This indicates that they do not mix, and the
</p>
<p>explanation was found by Mestel (1953). Before the circulation can transport the
</p>
<p>material out of the burning region, the moving matter will have been enriched in
</p>
<p>helium. It therefore has a higher molecular weight than the surrounding into which it
</p>
<p>has been lifted. But then the effect discussed in connection with a blob of material of
</p>
<p>higher molecular weight � in a gas of lower � becomes important (Sect. 6.4). Let us</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>574 44 The Thermodynamics of Rotating Stellar Models
</p>
<p>Fig. 44.1 Material of higher
</p>
<p>molecular weight in the
</p>
<p>central region of a rotating
</p>
<p>star (grey area) under the
</p>
<p>influence of meridional
</p>
<p>circulation
</p>
<p>assume that the circulation lifts helium-enriched material as indicated in Fig. 44.1.
</p>
<p>Then, since in hydrostatic equilibrium T=� must be constant on � surfaces, the
</p>
<p>lifted matter has a higher temperature than the matter on the same � surface which
</p>
<p>is not lifted. There is no buoyancy force acting on the lifted matter, since the
</p>
<p>higher molecular weight is compensated by the higher temperature. But as the lifted
</p>
<p>material adjusts thermally, it sinks back. This additional motion (&ldquo;� currents&rdquo;) acts
</p>
<p>against the circulation, and the star can only be mixed if circulation is sufficiently
</p>
<p>fast. But even in rapidly rotatingmain-sequence stars, the circulation is not sufficient
</p>
<p>to mix the helium formed during hydrogen burning. Obviously layers in which the
</p>
<p>molecular weight increases in an inward direction cannot easily be penetrated by
</p>
<p>meridional circulation. One therefore often speaks of � barriers.
</p>
<p>Note that � barriers in which no circulation occurs are not in contradiction to
</p>
<p>our &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of the existence of meridional circulation in rotating stars. According
</p>
<p>to our considerations in Sect. 44.4, which also hold for inhomogeneous stars as long
</p>
<p>as � is spherically symmetric, circulation would set in. But after a short time the
</p>
<p>circulation has modified the � distribution, and the original spherically symmetric
</p>
<p>function �.r/ has become distorted and may be of the form �0.r/ C �2.r/L2.#/.
Then by counting the equations and variables as was done in Sect. 44.4, we would
</p>
<p>not find the problem to be overdetermined, since �2.r/ is an additional unknown
</p>

<p>The Angular-Velocity Distribution in Stars
</p>
<p>Stars formed out of an interstellar cloud contain a certain amount of angular
</p>
<p>momentum, which is distributed over the stellar mass. Suppose there were no
</p>
<p>transport of angular momentum between the mass elements during the formation
</p>
<p>and evolution of the stars; one would then have local conservation of angular
</p>
<p>momentum,
</p>
<p>d.s2!/
</p>
<p>dt
� s2 @!
</p>
<p>@t
C v � r .s2!/ D 0; (45.1)
</p>
<p>where v is the large-scale velocity in the star. Then the angular velocity !.s; #/
</p>
<p>would be determined by the angular momenta of the mass elements in the original
</p>
<p>cloud. However, the motion of atoms, the flow of photons through matter, and
</p>
<p>instabilities that cause small-scale motions can transport angular momentum (An
</p>
<p>example of the last of these is the convective motion in regions of dynamical
</p>
<p>instability.). We now discuss these transport mechanisms in detail.
</p>
<p>45.1 Viscosity
</p>
<p>Viscosity due to microscopic motion, like that of the molecules in a liquid, is given
</p>
<p>by the viscosity coefficient
</p>
<p>� � %`vth; (45.2)
</p>
<p>where ` is the mean free path of the particles and vth their mean velocity. In an
</p>
<p>ionized gas the viscosity is determined by the collisions between the ions. Therefore
</p>
<p>their mean free path and their thermal velocities have to be inserted in (45.2), and
</p>
<p>one normally obtains values for � which in cgs units are of the order of 1.
</p>
<p>In order to see whether viscosity is important in a star, one has to estimate the
</p>
<p>timescale required for viscosity to influence a given angular-velocity distribution.

<p>�visc �

</p>

</p>
<p>where d is the characteristic length on which ! varies. If for d one takes the radius
</p>
<p>of a star, say 1011 cm, then with % � 1 g cm�3, one finds �visc � 1022 s, a timescale
much longer than the cosmological time. In stars one can therefore neglect the
</p>
<p>viscosity due to the collisions between the ions.
</p>
<p>In a star, photons can also cause viscosity, since they transport momentum.
</p>
<p>If they are absorbed after a mean free path `ph, they transfer their momentum to
</p>
<p>the absorbing particle. A rough estimate of this radiative viscosity �rad is obtained
</p>
<p>if in (45.2) % is replaced by the mass density of the radiation field %rad D aT 4=c2,

<p>With d D 1011 cm2, % D 1 g cm�3, � D 1 cm2 g�1, T D 107K, we find the
characteristic time of radiative viscosity in a star to be 1018 s, again a timescale long
</p>
<p>compared to the lifetime of a star. One therefore can neglect the effects of viscosity
</p>
<p>not only caused by the atomic motion but also those caused by radiation: the stellar
</p>
<p>gas moves like a frictionless fluid.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the radiation causes a kind of viscosity similar to that of
</p>
<p>the atomic motion only in an isotropic radiation field. For a non-isotropic field the
</p>
<p>radiative viscosity is not a scalar but a tensor.
</p>
<p>The expression (45.2) for viscosity can also be used in convective regions, where
</p>
<p>rising and falling mass elements not only transport energy as discussed in Chap. 7
</p>
<p>but also momentum. In the picture of the mixing-length theory, one can consider
</p>
<p>the convection elements as &ldquo;particles&rdquo; which are created at some place, move

</p>
<p>where vt is the convective velocity. In the case of the convective envelope of the
</p>
<p>Sun, we assume vt to be 1% of the speed of sound (as indicated in Fig. 29.5c). With
</p>
<p>`m � HP � 108 cm, % � 10�4 g cm�3, a sound velocity of vs � 2 � 106 cm s�1
corresponding to a temperature of 3�104K, and with vt � 0:01vs � 2�104 cm s�1,
we find �t � 2 � 108 cgs and the corresponding timescale �visc � 5 � 109 s �
160 years! One can therefore assume that the angular-velocity distribution in the
</p>
<p>convective zone of the Sun, for instance, has reached a steady state in which the
</p>
<p>initial angular-momentum distribution is smeared out by viscosity.
</p>
<p>However, the analogy between friction caused by molecules and that by convec-
</p>
<p>tive blobs has its limits. While the statistical motion of molecules is isotropic to a
</p>
<p>high degree, there is no reason to suppose that convection in a stellar convective
</p>
<p>zone can be described by elements with isotropic random motion. Convection is
</p>
<p>maintained in a star by the radially outgoing energy flux. The motion is caused by
</p>
<p>buoyancy forces which are antiparallel to the (radial) gravity vector. One therefore
</p>
<p>can expect that the exchange of momentum by the turbulent elements is different in
</p>
<p>the radial direction from that in other directions. The viscosity is no longer isotropic,
</p>
<p>i.e. it is a tensor.
</p>
<p>The macroscopic behaviour of a fluid with anisotropic viscosity is peculiar. We
</p>
<p>know that in the case of isotropic viscosity, a self-gravitating sphere which initially
</p>
<p>starts out with differential rotation approaches solid-body rotation after a viscous
</p>
<p>timescale. This is not true any more for non-isotropic viscosity (Biermann 1951).
</p>
<p>One can expect that non-isotropic turbulent viscosity causes differential rotation
</p>
<p>and should therefore not be surprised that the surface of the Sun does not rotate
</p>
<p>uniformly.
</p>
<p>In this connection it should be noted that in a large part of the solar convective
</p>
<p>zone, the layers are adiabatic (with constant rad) and surfaces of constant pres-
sure and of constant density coincide (since d ln%=d lnP D constant). As in the
barotropic case any angular-velocity distribution for which ! varies on cylinders of
</p>
<p>s D constant will cause dynamically driven meridional circulation which by itself
changes the angular-velocity distribution.
</p>
<p>Helioseismology has allowed to determine the rotation profile of the Sun.
</p>
<p>Schou et al. (1998) have demonstrated that the radiative interior of the Sun is
</p>
<p>rotating with nearly constant angular velocity, while the convective envelope shows
</p>
<p>differential rotation, which changes gradually with depth from the surface rotation.
</p>
<p>At 30 ı latitude angular velocity is nearly constant with depth, while at higher
latitude, where the surface rotation velocity is about 20&ndash;30% lower than at the
</p>
<p>poles, it rises mainly near the bottom of the convective envelope, at a relative radius
</p>
<p>of about r=Rˇ � 0:28.
</p>
<p>45.2 Dynamical Stability
</p>
<p>The behaviour of incompressible homogeneous rotating fluids has been thoroughly
</p>
<p>investigated (see, e.g. Chandrasekhar 1981). But in many respects compressible
</p>
<p>gases behave differently. For instance, pure rotation (without meridional motions)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>578 45 The Angular-Velocity Distribution in Stars
</p>
<p>in the case % D constant can only take place if ! is constant on cylinders of
s D constant (compare Chap. 44). Otherwise the curl of the centrifugal acceleration
!2ses would not vanish. But in the case of pure rotation the equation of motion in
</p>
<p>the meridional plane is
1
</p>
<p>%
rP C r˚ D !2ses : (45.8)
</p>
<p>As long as % D constant, the curl of the left-hand side vanishes. For @!=@z &curren; 0 one
has curl (!2ses/ &curren; 0. Then the meridional components of the equation of motion
can only be fulfilled if meridional motions occur, and with them additional terms
</p>
<p>appear in (45.8). This is also the case if the equation of state is barotropic (as for
</p>
<p>complete degeneracy), since for P D P.%/, the curl of .rP=%/ also vanishes. The
same holds if the equation of state is not barotropic, but if some other mechanism
</p>
<p>ensures that the surfaces of constant pressure and constant density coincide. One
</p>
<p>example is convection zones in their adiabatic regime. From the condition r D rad
(where rad is constant or is a function of P and T ) it follows that the surfaces
of constant pressure and density coincide. If the convective region is chemically
</p>
<p>homogeneous, then the equation of state (say for an ideal gas) assures that also
</p>
<p>the pressure and density surfaces coincide. Therefore r � .rP=%/ vanishes and
meridional flow occurs if @!=@z &curren; 0.
</p>
<p>But in a rotating star the pressure and density surfaces are normally inclined:
</p>
<p>r �
�
1
</p>
<p>%
rP
</p>
<p>�
D � 1
</p>
<p>%2
r% �CrP &curren; 0: (45.9)
</p>
<p>Here the right-hand side is obviously proportional to the sine of the angle of
</p>
<p>inclination. The vector rP=% is no longer a gradient; it can therefore cancel the
</p>
<p>non-conservative part of !2ses and (45.8) can be fulfilled without any meridional
</p>
<p>velocity components.
</p>
<p>The different behaviour of a compressible non-barotropic gas compared to that
</p>
<p>of an incompressible fluid also affects the stability behaviour.
</p>
<p>It is well known that the shear motion of fluids can become turbulent. Then
</p>
<p>kinetic energy of the shear flow goes into the kinetic energy of the &ldquo;turbulent&rdquo;
</p>
<p>elements. If friction is strong, it can prevent this transition.
</p>
<p>In an incompressible viscous fluid, therefore, the Reynolds number Re decides
</p>
<p>whether the flow is turbulent or laminar (Landau and Lifshitz 1987, vol. 6):
</p>
<p>Re D %vd
�
; (45.10)
</p>
<p>where v is a characteristic velocity difference and d is a characteristic length.
</p>
<p>For high Reynolds numbers (say Re � 3; 000) kinetic energy of the differential
motion becomes kinetic energy of the turbulent elements and the energy which is
</p>
<p>necessarily lost because of friction is small: the flow is turbulent. If, on the other</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>45.2 Dynamical Stability 579
</p>
<p>hand, Re is small, much more energy would have to be used up to overcome the
</p>
<p>friction of the turbulent elements than is available from the reservoir of differential
</p>
<p>motion: the flow is laminar. For a rotating star with % � 1 g cm�3, d � R �
1011 cm, v � 105 cm s�1, and � � 1 cgs (molecular or radiative viscosity), we find
Re � 1016, which means that the flow should be highly turbulent.
</p>
<p>But the stellar gas is not incompressible and in most cases not barotropic.
</p>
<p>Therefore, for a transition from laminar to turbulent motion, the energy due to the
</p>
<p>shear motion not only has to go into kinetic energy of the turbulent elements (and via
</p>
<p>friction into heat) but also into work against the buoyancy forces. Another critical
</p>
<p>dimensionless number, the Richardson number Ri, can be used to decide whether
</p>
<p>shear motion becomes turbulent despite the stabilizing effect of buoyancy. In the
</p>
<p>case of a plane parallel flow v.z/; it is defined by
</p>
<p>Ri D g
HP
</p>
<p>jrad � rj

</p>
<p>: (45.11)
</p>
<p>One can show that Ri &lt; 1=4 is a sufficient condition for stability of the laminar
</p>
<p>motion. In the case of a layer in the deep interior of a star we may estimate j@v=@zj �
!R=R D !; jrad � rj � 1;HP � 109 cm; g � 105 cm s�2 and find that the
rotation is laminar as long as ! &lt; 2 � 10�2 s�1 or the rotation period is longer than
five minutes. Only neutron stars rotate faster.
</p>
<p>Equation (45.11) has been derived under the assumption that the turbulent
</p>
<p>elements undergo adiabatic changes during their motion. This is not necessarily
</p>
<p>always the case, not even in the very deep stellar interior. For the sake of simplicity
</p>
<p>we discuss it in the plane parallel approximation. Let us define a characteristic
</p>
<p>timescale for a turbulent element in the case of shear instability of a plane parallel
</p>
<p>flow by �` D jd z=dvj. This timescale can be considered as the &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; of the
element. If its excess velocity over the mean velocity of its origin is�v D `jdv=d zj,
where ` is its mean free path, then it takes the time �` to move over the distance `.
</p>
<p>The motion will only be adiabatic if �` � �adj, where �adj is the thermal adjustment
time of the element. With (6.25) one finds as the condition for adiabatic changes of

</p>
<p>One can see that this condition is violated for very small shear (jdv=d zj ! 0)
as well as for small elements (d ! 0). Small elements always have time to adjust
thermally to their surroundings while they are moving. Then the stabilizing effect
</p>
<p>of the temperature stratification disappears. The instability which then occurs for
</p>
<p>small turbulent elements can become important. But one has to keep in mind
</p>
<p>that extremely small turbulent elements cannot exist, since for them, even the low
</p>
<p>molecular or radiative viscosity brakes their motion. One way of estimating the

</p>
<p>while for smaller elements, viscosity overcomes the instability. Since the thermal

<p>adjustment time of turbulent elements is shorter than their lifetime, however, the
</p>
<p>stabilizing effect of buoyancy is reduced and a flow can be turbulent even if
</p>
<p>Ri &lt; 1=4.
</p>
<p>There are other dynamical instabilities which are typical of rotational motion.
</p>
<p>If they occurred in a star, the flows would become turbulent and the turbulent
</p>
<p>viscosity would immediately change the original angular-velocity distribution.
</p>
<p>The simplest case of such an instability can be studied by the example of an
</p>
<p>incompressible or barotropic liquid rotating, say, in a cylindrical container. The
</p>
<p>angular velocity ! may depend on s only, making pure rotation possible (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 45.3). As &ldquo;mass elements,&rdquo; we consider the matter within two neighbouring

Their thicknesses shall be such that their mass contents dm are equal. We now
</p>
<p>try to exchange the masses of the two tori by expanding the smaller one and
</p>
<p>contracting the other without changing their angular momentum and calculate the
</p>
<p>work necessary to make the exchange against the centrifugal force. The kinetic

<p>energy of a torus is E D !2s2dm=2, which for a given mass is a function of s:
If we expand (or contract) one of the rings, then conservation of angular momentum

<p>demands ! � s�2 and therefore E � s�2. At their original position (s1 and s2),
the two tori shall have the energiesE1 andE2, respectively. Owing to the expansion

<p>has been derived by assuming axisymmetric perturbations only. Since additional

<p>non-axisymmetric instabilities may exist, (45.18) is only a necessary condition for

<p>indicate that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs when the left-hand

<p>which otherwise are dynamically unstable. In the case of non-conservative rotation
</p>
<p>of a barotropic fluid, there can be no hydrostatic equilibrium between centrifugal,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>45.3 Secular Stability 583
</p>
<p>gravitational, and pressure accelerations. Therefore circulation currents are
</p>
<p>necessary to fulfil the equation of motion in the meridional plane. If buoyancy
</p>
<p>forces are present, equilibrium can exist for any rotation law ! D !.s; z/ as long as
gravity overcomes the centrifugal force.
</p>
<p>However, buoyancy forces are not as reliable as, for instance, gravity. Let us
</p>
<p>consider the axisymmetric case of a fluid between two rotating cylinders and let us
</p>
<p>assume the Rayleigh criterion (45.18) to be violated, while the Solberg&ndash;H&oslash;iland
</p>
<p>criterion (45.22)&ndash;(45.24) gives stability. We then know that if a toroidal mass
</p>
<p>element is exchanged with another one further outwards in the s direction, energy
</p>
<p>is gained from centrifugal forces, but the work which goes into buoyancy is larger.
</p>
<p>Therefore, if kicked outwards, it will go back and, in the pure adiabatic case, starts
</p>
<p>to oscillate around its original position. This reminds us of the oscillating blob
</p>
<p>discussed in Chap. 6. But we have seen there that a blob with an excess of molecular
</p>
<p>weight will sink while adjusting thermally. The situation is very similar in the case
</p>
<p>of a rotating star in which buoyancy forces guarantee dynamical stability.
</p>
<p>Let us discuss the case of non-conservative rotation. It is called &ldquo;baroclinic&rdquo;,
</p>
<p>since the P and % are inclined against each other. Then centrifugal acceleration is
</p>
<p>not curl-free and cannot be balanced by the (conservative) gravity. We now consider
</p>
<p>a closed line in one quadrant of the meridional plane (Fig. 45.2). The vector of a
</p>
<p>line element is dl . Then the integral of the centrifugal acceleration taken along the
</p>
<p>line is I
c � d l &curren; 0: (45.25)
</p>
<p>This means that the centrifugal acceleration produces a torque on the matter along
</p>
<p>this line. In a barotropic (or incompressible) fluid this torque would cause a
</p>
<p>meridional flow. In the more general case, rP=% can balance this torque. But the
</p>
<p>matter will follow the torque within the timescale during which heat can leak out.
</p>
<p>The matter will also flow if the Rayleigh criterion (45.18) is violated, but the
</p>
<p>Richardson number (45.11) gives stability. This is analogous to the case of the salt-
</p>
<p>finger experiment (see Sect. 6.5). If we then exchange two coaxial tori adiabatically
</p>
<p>as indicated in Fig. 45.1, buoyancy will bring them back to their old position. But
</p>
<p>since it takes a finite time to return to the initial state, heat will leak out of, or go
</p>
<p>into, the two tori and they will never come back exactly to the old position. As the
</p>
<p>blobs in the salt-finger experiment exchange chemical species, here a meridional
</p>
<p>flow will exchange angular momentum. This flow is again controlled by the time
</p>
<p>during which heat can leak away from the matter.
</p>
<p>What is the timescale of such a thermally controlled flow? Let us go back
</p>
<p>to the baroclinic case and the example indicated in Fig. 45.2. Along each closed
</p>
<p>meridional line there is a torque. The heat exchange can take place most effectively
</p>
<p>if the thickness d is small, just as the thinnest salt-finger moves fastest, as can
</p>
<p>be seen from (6.25) and (6.29). One would therefore expect that the smallest
</p>
<p>elements move fastest. Indeed, with decreasing thickness, the velocity increases like
</p>
<p>v � d�2. Certainly for small mass elements friction becomes important, but since
the molecular (or radiative) viscosity is low, the elements slowed down by friction</p>

<p>584 45 The Angular-Velocity Distribution in Stars
</p>
<p>Fig. 45.2 (a) The meridional
</p>
<p>plane of a rotating star with
</p>
<p>d!=dz &curren; 0. Thin lines give
! D constant. Along each
closed line, the integral over
</p>
<p>the centrifugal acceleration as
</p>
<p>defined in (45.25) does not
</p>
<p>vanish, giving rise to a torque
</p>
<p>which causes meridional
</p>
<p>motions as indicated in (b)
</p>
<p>are rather small. Estimates indicate that they are of the order of some metres in the
</p>
<p>radiative interior of the Sun.
</p>
<p>Here we have discussed the instabilities by rather heuristic arguments. A math-
</p>
<p>ematically more satisfying treatment of this problem has been carried out by
</p>
<p>Goldreich and Schubert (1967) and Fricke (1968). They find as conditions necessary
</p>
<p>for secular stability
@ ln!
</p>
<p>@ ln s
&gt; �2; @!
</p>
<p>@z
D 0: (45.26)
</p>
<p>Although the first condition is identical with (45.18) we have to keep in mind that
</p>
<p>there we discussed dynamical stability in the barotropic (or incompressible) case,
</p>
<p>while here we deal with secular stability. The second condition of (45.26) does not
</p>
<p>correspond to a stability condition in the barotropic case. If in this case it is violated,
</p>
<p>there is no equilibrium. Only buoyancy forces can establish equilibrium in the non-
</p>
<p>barotropic case, but this equilibrium is thermally unstable.
</p>
<p>Several estimates have been made of the timescale by which the thermal
</p>
<p>instabilities change the overall angular-velocity distribution, violating conditions
</p>
<p>(45.26). There is no definite answer, but it may well be that it is the Eddington&ndash;
</p>
<p>Sweet timescale (44.34) (Kippenhahn et al. 1980b).
</p>
<p>What kind of angular-velocity distribution really does occur in radiative regions
</p>
<p>of stars? Let us start with a conservative angular-velocity distribution, ! D !.s/,
say with ! D constant. Then meridional motions will start. Since they are due
to the thermal imbalance between polar and equatorial regions, their characteristic</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>45.3 Secular Stability 585
</p>
<p>length scale should be of the order of the stellar radius. They will change the
</p>
<p>angular-velocity distribution, and ! will become a function of z too. But then the
</p>
<p>Goldreich&ndash;Schubert&ndash;Fricke criterion (45.26) is violated and instabilities will occur,
</p>
<p>which grow fastest for small-scale perturbations. Therefore one again expects eddies
</p>
<p>of the size of metres. At the present time, a complete picture of the transport of
</p>
<p>angular momentum does not exist. Multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations
</p>
<p>as well as advanced theories are used to understand the physics determining the
</p>
<p>properties of rotation in stars. Seismology may yield observational evidence, too.
</p>
<p>The present situation is summarized in more detail in the textbook by Maeder
</p>
<p>(2009). Rotation is one of the big unsolved and important questions of stellar
</p>
<p>structure theory. It will require much more physical insight and many more
</p>
<p>numerical efforts to understand it.</p>
