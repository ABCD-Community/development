<p>Preface
</p>
<p>In a hospital in South Korea, leukemia patients are expelled as untreatable because 
</p>
<p>a multinational drug company refuses to lower the price of a life-saving drug. 
</p>
<p>Thousands of miles away, a U.S. group called the Rational Response Squad is 
</p>
<p>forced by the threat of a copyright lawsuit to take down a YouTube video criticiz-
</p>
<p>ing the paranormalist Uri Geller. Could we&mdash;should we&mdash;see these two events, so 
</p>
<p>seemingly remote from one another, as related? Yes&mdash;or such is the premise of a 
</p>
<p>new political formation on the global stage, one that goes under the name of the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;access to knowledge movement&rdquo;&mdash;or more simply, A2K.
</p>
<p>	 A2K is an emerging mobilization that includes software programmers who 
</p>
<p>took to the streets to defeat software patents in Europe, AIDS activists who forced 
</p>
<p>multinational pharmaceutical companies to permit copies of their medicines to 
</p>
<p>be sold in South Africa, and college students who have created a new &ldquo;free cul-
</p>
<p>ture&rdquo; movement to &ldquo;defend the digital commons&rdquo;&mdash;to select just a few. A2K can 
</p>
<p>also be seen as an emerging set of theoretical commitments that both respond 
</p>
<p>to and reject the key justifications for &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; law and that seek 
</p>
<p>to develop an alternative account of the operation and importance of informa-
</p>
<p>tion and knowledge, creativity and innovation in the contemporary world. (The 
</p>
<p>quotes reflect the fact that A2K calls the concept of &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; into 
</p>
<p>question, because of its tendency to reify the form of legal regulation that it rep-
</p>
<p>resents. Some argue that the term itself should be banished; we nonetheless use 
</p>
<p>it here because most A2K advocates have found it indispensable, as a term that 
</p>
<p>designates the broad and diverse restrictions on the exchange of information and 
</p>
<p>knowledge against which they have emerged and mobilized.) Access to Knowledge 
</p>
<p>in the Age of Intellectual Property takes as its subject this new field of activism and 
</p>
<p>advocacy and the new political and conceptual conflicts occurring in the domain of  
</p>
<p>intellectual property.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p> Why is intellectual property becoming the object of a new global politics today? 
</p>
<p>Can file sharers, software programmers, subsistence farmers, and HIV-  positive 
</p>
<p>people find useful common cause in their joint opposition to existing regimes of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property? What concepts might unite the emerging A2K coalition, and 
</p>
<p>what issues might fracture it? What is at stake with the use of the term &ldquo;access&rdquo; as 
</p>
<p>a fulcrum of this mobilization? Is A2K more than an agenda for those opposed to 
</p>
<p>restrictions on intellectual property&mdash;and should it be?
</p>
<p> This volume takes such questions as its object. It aims to make this new field of 
</p>
<p>political contention accessible to those unfamiliar with it and to provide a place for 
</p>
<p>those generating it to analyze its evolution, goals, tensions, and future. The contri-
</p>
<p>butions come from a varied mix of activists and academics and from different parts 
</p>
<p>of the world. This makes for an eclectic and sometimes even uncomfortable mix, one 
</p>
<p>true to the emerging dynamics of the A2K movement itself. Their subjects are also 
</p>
<p>diverse, part of our own editorial attempt to avoid narrowly prescribing the con-
</p>
<p>tours of A2K even as we inevitably, through these same selections, construct them.
</p>
<p> The book itself is divided into four parts and an epilogue. The first section 
</p>
<p>offers two introductions to the field of A2K. It should serve to orient readers 
</p>
<p>entirely new to debates over intellectual property, but also to provide fodder for 
</p>
<p>debate among those who consider themselves peripheral or central actors in the 
</p>
<p>movement itself. The first introduction, by Amy Kapczynski, offers a conceptual 
</p>
<p>genealogy of the A2K movement&mdash;an account of the concepts and arguments that 
</p>
<p>its participants are generating in order to theorize their common condition and to 
</p>
<p>undermine the narrative about intellectual property that has justified the expan-
</p>
<p>sion of this form of law and governance over the past few decades. The second 
</p>
<p>introduction, by Ga&euml;lle Krikorian, examines A2K as a field of activism. It describes 
</p>
<p>how the mobilization has emerged and organized itself using the issue of &ldquo;access,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>the technological and political context to which the movement corresponds, the 
</p>
<p>representations and practices it engages, and its political stakes both as a form of 
</p>
<p>social mobilization and as an alternative to intellectual property rights extremism.
</p>
<p> The second section of the book provides a geography of the new field of activ-
</p>
<p>ism and advocacy that constitutes A2K. With no pretense to being comprehen-
</p>
<p>sive, it illuminates a series of historical moments that have decisively marked the 
</p>
<p>emergence of the politics of A2K. It thus identifies a series of fronts along which 
</p>
<p>intellectual property conflicts are crystallizing and sketches A2K mobilizations 
</p>
<p>across a spectrum of political space and time.
</p>
<p> In this section, Ahmed Abdel Latif describes how A2K has been framed as a 
</p>
<p>concept and the genesis of the A2K name, thereby locating A2K as a field of forces 
</p>
<p>gathering together under a common banner. Thereafter, several historical moments 
</p>
<p>in A2K illustrate how, where, and when certain key issues surfaced and were </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>preface 11
</p>
<p>rendered the subject of politics. Ellen &lsquo;t Hoen describes how health activists work-
</p>
<p>ing on pharmaceutical policy came to conceptualize intellectual property as central 
</p>
<p>to their struggles. Sangeeta Shashikant narrates the behind-the-scenes forces that 
</p>
<p>led to one of the most salient moments of success for A2K, the Doha Declaration 
</p>
<p>of the World Trade Organization, which declared that intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>do not trump public health. Moving from medicines to the emerging politics of 
</p>
<p>hackers, Philippe Aigrain analyzes the successful mobilization against the codifica-
</p>
<p>tion of software patents at the European Parliament. The last contribution in this 
</p>
<p>section comes from Viviana Mu&ntilde;oz Tellez and Sisule F. Musungu, who describe 
</p>
<p>two recent and dramatic defeats for intellectual property absolutism at the World 
</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). In the first, A2K activists working with 
</p>
<p>developing-country governments outflanked their opponents, proposing a new 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;development agenda&rdquo; that seeks to reorient the work of WIPO to respond to the 
</p>
<p>needs of those living in the Global South. In the second, A2K activists and their 
</p>
<p>allies mobilized to defeat a new WIPO Broadcasting Treaty that had been heav-
</p>
<p>ily promoted by forces in the old media seeking to extend their control over the 
</p>
<p>domain of new media.
</p>
<p> The third section of the book offers varying visions&mdash;perhaps complementary, 
</p>
<p>perhaps at odds with one another&mdash;of the conceptual terrain of the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment. It charts the evolution of ideas and the surfacing of arguments within the 
</p>
<p>movement and thereby explores how the issue of intellectual property has been 
</p>
<p>politicized and how our collective understandings of what is at stake in these 
</p>
<p>debates have been tentatively transformed by A2K activists.
</p>
<p> The section begins with Peter Drahos&rsquo;s account of the global mobilization of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property owners that preceded and helped to shape A2K. That mobi-
</p>
<p>lization was exceptionally successful&mdash;in a matter of years, it secured a dramatic 
</p>
<p>reordering of the global governance of intellectual property, most importantly by 
</p>
<p>inserting intellectual property obligations into the new World Trade Organization. 
</p>
<p>These efforts were sustained by the ideological interventions that Drahos describes.
</p>
<p> In response to these interventions, A2K advocates have attempted to reframe 
</p>
<p>public understandings regarding the just and efficient conditions for the use, 
</p>
<p>creation, and re-creation of knowledge. Many use the issue of access as a lens, 
</p>
<p>possibly theoretical and certainly strategic, to refocus traditional political con-
</p>
<p>figurations around intellectual property and to set out their claims. Yochai  
</p>
<p>Benkler articulates the &ldquo;information commons&rdquo; as the central concept of A2K and 
</p>
<p>describes the historical and political forces that converged to create the conditions 
</p>
<p>for this striking new field of political coalition. Interventions by Carlos M. Correa, 
</p>
<p>Roberto Verzola, Ga&euml;lle Krikorian, Jeffrey Atteberry, and Lawrence Liang explore 
</p>
<p>paradoxes and tensions in the emerging discourse of A2K along vectors ranging </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski and krikorian 12
</p>
<p>from indigenous knowledge, in the essay by Carlos Correa, to the notion of the 
</p>
<p>commons, in Jeffrey Atteberry&rsquo;s contribution, and the figure of the pirate, in one 
</p>
<p>of the essays by Lawrence Liang. Robert Verzola and Lawrence Liang, in another 
</p>
<p>essay, each offer us new paradigms for the relationship between knowledge and 
</p>
<p>the production and control of knowledge-embedded goods, thus offering us new 
</p>
<p>ways in which to think about the struggle between A2K and intellectual property. 
</p>
<p>Verzola theorizes the commonalities between technological measures used to dis-
</p>
<p>rupt the reproducibility of information in the digital and agricultural realms and 
</p>
<p>challenges us to rethink the domain of information production as one of abun-
</p>
<p>dance and fertility, rather than scarcity. Liang explores etymological links between 
</p>
<p>identity and property and considers the implications of thinking about intellectual 
</p>
<p>and cultural production through the dynamics of relationality, rather than posses-
</p>
<p>sion. Ga&euml;lle Krikorian, focusing on free-trade agreements, offers an analysis of the 
</p>
<p>political environment and the political rationales of the maximalization of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property protection and examines some of the perspectives and experiences 
</p>
<p>of the resistances to it.
</p>
<p> The section closes with an opening, reproducing questions that we distributed 
</p>
<p>to a group of A2K actors who have different approaches to and involvements in 
</p>
<p>the movement&mdash;Onno Purbo, Jo Walsh, Anil Gupta, and Rick Falkvinge. The ques-
</p>
<p>tions invited them to elaborate on the concepts and ideology central to A2K, and 
</p>
<p>their responses illustrate the diversity of views on these matters that exist within 
</p>
<p>the movement.
</p>
<p> A2K activists have proven remarkably creative and successful in recent years, 
</p>
<p>not only in contesting the contours of intellectual property law, but also in identi-
</p>
<p>fying weaknesses and failures in the regime of intellectual property, spaces where 
</p>
<p>new regimes for generating and managing knowledge and knowledge goods might 
</p>
<p>evolve. The third section of the book describes A2K by exploring its strategies and 
</p>
<p>tactics. It thereby seeks to illuminate how the mobilization has politicized this pre-
</p>
<p>viously &ldquo;technical&rdquo; area of law and policy and at times has successfully combated 
</p>
<p>very well-resourced and politically powerful opponents.
</p>
<p> By comparing different strands within A2K, Susan K. Sell articulates the vari-
</p>
<p>ous grammars of claims-making of movements within the movement. A series of 
</p>
<p>detailed case studies of strategies deployed in specific contexts then permits us to 
</p>
<p>mark and critically assess the choices and stances being made in the name of A2K: 
</p>
<p>in India, the choice NGOs made to master and rework the discourse of patent law 
</p>
<p>in order to oppose drug patents (Chan Park and Leena Menghaney); in Thailand, 
</p>
<p>the efforts made to reduce medicine prices by pressing the government legally to 
</p>
<p>override patents (Jiraporn Limpananont and Kannikar Kijtiwatchakul); in South 
</p>
<p>Africa and elsewhere, the deployment of the rhetoric and law of competition </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>preface 13
</p>
<p>to attack exclusive rights in information (Sean Flynn); in an NGO in the United 
</p>
<p>States, the creation of an open-access journal that sought to develop knowledge-
</p>
<p>governance principles and practices consistent with the commitments of the move-
</p>
<p>ment (Manon A. Ress); at technological standard-setting organizations, debates 
</p>
<p>over the nature and terms of open standards (Laura DeNardis); at WIPO, attempts 
</p>
<p>to introduce new multilateral agreements to defend the rights of the visually 
</p>
<p>impaired and rebalance the current copyright regime (Vera Franz); and finally, in 
</p>
<p>the domain of global health law, the promotion of alternative models for medical 
</p>
<p>research and development that would better combine the twin goals of access and 
</p>
<p>innovation (Spring Gombe and James Love).
</p>
<p> This section next reproduces a series of questions and responses solicited from 
</p>
<p>advocates (Harini Amarasuyiya, Vera Franz, Heeseob Nam, Carolina Rossini, and 
</p>
<p>Dileepa Witharana) regarding contemporary strategic and tactical opportunities 
</p>
<p>and dilemmas in A2K. Participants were invited to reflect upon how the move-
</p>
<p>ments and groups with which they are associated have articulated their principles 
</p>
<p>and campaigns, defined their goals and translated these into practice, and related 
</p>
<p>to law, the state, private interests, and others in the A2K coalition.
</p>
<p> The section closes with two interviews that provide practical as well as theo-
</p>
<p>retical dialogues on the transformations associated with A2K as they affect society 
</p>
<p>and the economy. Yann Moulier Boutang and Ga&euml;lle Krikorian engage the implica-
</p>
<p>tions of the emergence of &ldquo;cognitive capitalism&rdquo; for knowledge industries as well 
</p>
<p>as for governments and individuals. Charles Igwe and Achal Prabhala discuss the 
</p>
<p>knowledge-governance and dissemination strategies that characterize the Indian 
</p>
<p>and Nigerian film industries and how these might inform debates about A2K.
</p>
<p> To end the volume in a mode that invites continuing reflection, an epilogue 
</p>
<p>offers a series of visions of the future by authors&mdash;Sarah Deutsch, Ga&euml;lle Kriko-
</p>
<p>rian, Eloan dos Santos Pinheiro, Hala Essalmawi, and Roberto Verzola&mdash;who were 
</p>
<p>asked to imagine best-case and worst-case scenarios of the regulation and pro-
</p>
<p>duction of knowledge in their field of interest. Unconstrained by the imperative 
</p>
<p>to describe &ldquo;likely&rdquo; scenarios, they offer us alternative visions that illuminate the 
</p>
<p>stakes of the choices that we make today and how these choices could portend 
</p>
<p>radically different futures for access to knowledge.
</p>
<p> As the diversity of the volume demonstrates, the conceptual and political 
</p>
<p>dynamics of the A2K movement reveal it as a mobilization that is very much still 
</p>
<p>in motion. Neither in the introductions that follow nor in this collection as a whole 
</p>
<p>do we purport to describe fully, account for, or locate the movement for access to 
</p>
<p>knowledge. The name itself is contestable and may not be the one that represents 
</p>
<p>this new politics over time. Nor is it clear what shape this new politics will take&mdash;
</p>
<p>how much it will tend toward conceptions of information and how much toward </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski and krikorian 14
</p>
<p>issues of knowledge, how much it will attend to or be driven by the concerns of the 
</p>
<p>Global South as opposed to those of the North, what modes of engagement with 
</p>
<p>law and with activism will characterize the mobilization over time, or who will con-
</p>
<p>stitute the center and who the periphery when historians write the story of A2K.
</p>
<p> But despite this still-provisional nature, the A2K movement has already begun 
</p>
<p>to reveal an important reality: Today, freedom and justice are increasingly medi-
</p>
<p>ated by decisions that were until recently considered supremely technical&mdash;deci-
</p>
<p>sions about the scope of patent law, about exceptions and limitations to copyright 
</p>
<p>for the blind, about the differential virtues of prizes and patents for stimulating 
</p>
<p>government investment in neglected diseases. By politicizing a discourse that was 
</p>
<p>once highly technocratic, the A2K movement is rendering visible once-obscure 
</p>
<p>vectors of the transmission of wealth and of power over life and death. It demands 
</p>
<p>that the concepts and terms central to intellectual property be introduced into 
</p>
<p>everyday discourse and become legible in their political implications around the 
</p>
<p>world. This volume, we hope, will assist in that project.</p>

<p>Access	to	Knowledge:	A	Conceptual	Genealogy
</p>
<p>Amy Kapczynski
</p>
<p>A decade or two ago, the words &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; were rarely heard in polite 
</p>
<p>company, much less in street demonstrations or on college campuses. Today, this 
</p>
<p>once technical concept has become a conceptual battlefield. A Google search for 
</p>
<p>the term, for example, first turns up a ferociously contested Wikipedia definition.1

<p>When I did the search, after two links to the World Intellectual Property Organiza-
</p>
<p>tion (WIPO) Web site, the next most important page according to Google&rsquo;s ranking 
</p>
<p>algorithm was an article called &ldquo;Did You Say &lsquo;Intellectual Property&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s a Seduc-
</p>
<p>tive Mirage,&rdquo; by free-software guru Richard Stallman.2
</p>
<p> Criticisms of the existing state of intellectual property law have gone viral, turn-
</p>
<p>ing up around the world in domains as diverse as software, agriculture, medicine, 
</p>
<p>and music. Activist efforts to challenge the contours of intellectual property law 
</p>
<p>are increasingly interconnected and gathered (especially globally) under the call for 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo; or &ldquo;A2K.&rdquo;3 A2K is a mobilization very much in process&mdash;
</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t yet been subject to the kind of histories or hagiographies that would render 
</p>
<p>one description or account of it authoritative. Rather than provide such an account, 
</p>
<p>this introductory essay seeks to locate A2K in two ways: as a reaction to structural 
</p>
<p>trends in technologies of information processing and in law, and as an emerging 
</p>
<p>conceptual critique of the narrative that legitimates the dramatic expansion in intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights that we have witnessed over the past several decades.
 As the following pages describe, new information-processing technologies 
</p>
<p>have made certain kinds of knowledge and information increasingly critical to 
</p>
<p>the accumulation and distribution of global wealth, as well as to the terms of our 
</p>
<p>bodily and social existence. Information-processing industries responded to these 
</p>
<p>shifts by pressing for&mdash;and achieving&mdash;unprecedented extensions of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights in order to gain more control over the use and exchange of infor-
</p>
<p>mation across the globe.</p>

</p>
<p> This move was not just a naked expression of lobbying power, although it was 
</p>
<p>that, too. Importantly, a conceptual narrative legitimated this shift. As we&rsquo;ll see, 
</p>
<p>this narrative is not a single theory, but an amalgam of theories drawn from dif-
</p>
<p>ferent domains and spun together to appear as one coherent account. The A2K 
</p>
<p>movement is challenging the coherence of this account by formulating a series of 
</p>
<p>critical concepts, metaphors, and imaginaries of its own&mdash;concepts such as the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;public domain&rdquo; and the &ldquo;commons&rdquo; and ideals such as &ldquo;sharing,&rdquo; &ldquo;openness,&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;access.&rdquo; These concepts are sometimes self-consciously cultivated by activists and 
</p>
<p>at other times can more accurately be said to be immanent in their claims.
</p>
<p> One way to map the A2K movement, then, is to explicate the most important 
</p>
<p>of these concepts by analyzing the work that they do to challenge the prevailing 
</p>
<p>justifications for intellectual property law. A conceptual genealogy of this sort can 
</p>
<p>help us not only better understand the political conflicts that are emerging around 
</p>
<p>issues of intellectual property rights, but also determine who is or may become 
</p>
<p>part of the A2K mobilization. Finally, it can also help us map key conceptual ten-
</p>
<p>sions in the field of A2K, ideational vectors that pull this new discourse in one 
</p>
<p>direction or another along the spectrum of political vision and action where the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement is being assembled. This introduction thus closes by articulating a 
</p>
<p>series of questions that confront A2K as it looks to the future.
</p>
<p>how knowledge matters
</p>
<p>To understand why and how a new politics of intellectual property is arising today, 
</p>
<p>we must first understand something about why and how knowledge matters in the 
</p>
<p>world today&mdash;both how it makes a difference in our world and how it is implicated 
</p>
<p>in the materialization, the making into matter, of that world.
</p>
<p> Although knowledge has always mattered to the organization of human societ-
</p>
<p>ies, in recent years, prominent economists and social theorists have sought to dem-
</p>
<p>onstrate that knowledge has come to matter in a new way. When the purported 
</p>
<p>shift happened and what it means depends upon how the change is characterized.
</p>
<p> In the economic perspective, knowledge matters in its technological capac-
</p>
<p>ity, for its effect on productivity and growth. Karl Marx and Joseph Schumpeter 
</p>
<p>early on posited that capitalism relies on technological dynamism,4 but the role 
</p>
<p>of knowledge was not recognized in the neoclassical paradigm until the work of 
</p>
<p>Robert Solow in the 1950s. Solow posited a connection between knowledge and 
</p>
<p>economic growth, arguing that the vast proportion of gains in productivity in early 
</p>
<p>twentieth-century America could be attributed not to factors related to the use of 
</p>
<p>labor or capital, but to a &ldquo;residual&rdquo; that he described as technical change.5 Solow&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>residual came to be understood as a range of advances in knowledge&mdash;from new </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 19
</p>
<p>machines (such as tractors) to new management techniques (such as Fordism)&mdash;
</p>
<p>that made processes of production more efficient.6
</p>
<p> Mainstream economists soon began to contend that knowledge is not only 
</p>
<p>important, but increasingly important to economic growth, positing that the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>most developed economies have been becoming more knowledge intensive. Fritz 
</p>
<p>Machlup took note of the way the U.S. economy was changing in the 1960s, a 
</p>
<p>change that was first marked by &ldquo;an increase in the share of &lsquo;knowledge-producing&rsquo;  
</p>
<p>labor in total employment.&rdquo;7 At the turn of the twentieth century, for example, 
</p>
<p>one-third of U.S. workers were employed in the service industries. By 1980, close 
</p>
<p>to seven in ten were.8 The trend that Machlup and his colleagues were identifying 
</p>
<p>in the United States was in fact occurring across so-called developed economies as 
</p>
<p>agricultural and to a lesser extent industrial jobs steadily lost ground to jobs in sec-
</p>
<p>tors such as education, finance, information technology, and the culture industry.9 
</p>
<p>The most productive component of these economies shifted from industrial sectors 
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;information-processing&rdquo; sectors such as financial services, marketing, biotech-
</p>
<p>nology, and software.10
</p>
<p> Perhaps the most prominent theorist of this shift, Manuel Castells, refers to this 
</p>
<p>as a transition to the &ldquo;informational&rdquo; mode of development. Informationalism is 
</p>
<p>not identified by the importance of knowledge to the economy, for knowledge was 
</p>
<p>essential to the industrial mode of development too. Rather, it derives from the fact 
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;the action of knowledge upon itself [is] the main source of productivity.&rdquo; New 
</p>
<p>information and communications technologies permit accelerating feedback loops 
</p>
<p>of innovation and information processing, making the human mind &ldquo;the direct 
</p>
<p>productive force, not just a decisive element of the production system.&rdquo;11 Manu-
</p>
<p>facturing and agriculture of course do not disappear, but information processing&mdash;
</p>
<p>for example, in computing, genetic engineering, or management techniques&mdash; 
</p>
<p>decisively determines their productivity.
</p>
<p> Can the shift truly be characterized as global, given that it is centered in a few 
</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest countries? Castells says yes, because the economy today 
</p>
<p>can work &ldquo;as a unit in real time . . . on a planetary scale&rdquo; and because local econo-
</p>
<p>mies everywhere depend &ldquo;on the performance of their globalized core,&rdquo; which 
</p>
<p>includes &ldquo;financial markets, international trade, transnational production, and, 
</p>
<p>to some extent, science and technology, and specialty labor.&rdquo;12 Also, developing 
</p>
<p>countries that have long labored under a trade imbalance with regard to manufac-
</p>
<p>tured goods and raw materials and the unequal distributions of wealth generated 
</p>
<p>by these now labor under a &ldquo;new form of imbalance&rdquo; regarding &ldquo;the trade between 
</p>
<p>high-technology and low-technology goods, and between high-knowledge services 
</p>
<p>and low-knowledge services, characterized by a pattern of uneven distribution of 
</p>
<p>knowledge and technology between countries and regions around the world.&rdquo;13</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski20
</p>
<p> The discourse about the rising centrality of knowledge to economic growth seems 
</p>
<p>to imply a claim that human society&mdash;and more specifically, certain societies&mdash; 
</p>
<p>are becoming more knowledgeable, leaving others behind. (Note how Castells 
</p>
<p>refers to the &ldquo;uneven distribution of knowledge . . . between countries and regions 
</p>
<p>around the world.&rdquo;) In fact, the claim should be understood to be narrower because 
</p>
<p>of the circumscribed form of &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; implicated here. For Castells, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, knowledge is defined as &ldquo;a set of organized statements of facts or ideas, pre-
</p>
<p>senting a reasoned judgment or an experimental result, which is transmitted to 
</p>
<p>others through some communication medium in some systematic form.&rdquo;14 The 
</p>
<p>focus here is thus on those forms of knowledge that are central to economic pro-
</p>
<p>ductivity and efficiency&mdash;namely, technical and scientific knowledge. There are, 
</p>
<p>of course, many other kinds of knowledge, such as ethical knowledge or knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of a person. As I will describe later, in its broadest sense, knowledge can be 
</p>
<p>described as a competence that only sometimes relates to a technical effect.
</p>
<p> The claim that knowledge is increasingly central to the global economy&mdash;or that 
</p>
<p>the global economy is today &ldquo;informational,&rdquo; rather than industrial&mdash;thus must 
</p>
<p>be understood as a more specific claim: that advances in the ability of humans to 
</p>
<p>codify, organize, exchange, and test certain kinds of scientific and technical knowl-
</p>
<p>edge have created revolutionary changes in modes of economic productivity. These 
</p>
<p>changes can be traced back many centuries, for example, to the advent of the print-
</p>
<p>ing press&mdash;a technology that made copying much more reliable and written texts 
</p>
<p>much more widely available and that enabled feedback loops that allowed informa-
</p>
<p>tion to be collected and corrected over time.15 Newer information and communica-
</p>
<p>tions technologies have intensified this process by increasing the speed of infor-
</p>
<p>mation transfer and processing, earlier through technologies such as the railroad 
</p>
<p>and telegraph and more recently through the pervasive networking of digital tech-
</p>
<p>nologies that we associate, for example, with the Internet.16 This increased capac-
</p>
<p>ity to codify, store, process, and exchange information has been a precondition for 
</p>
<p>the development of information-intensive sectors from biotechnology to financial 
</p>
<p>engineering. It is also a precondition of the shift toward more flexible, networked, 
</p>
<p>information-intensive business systems such as just-in-time production.17
</p>
<p> Of course, such shifts have implications far beyond the realm of economics. The 
</p>
<p>same transformations that have made scientific and technical knowledge more cen-
</p>
<p>tral to the global economy, for example, have also made such knowledge more cen-
</p>
<p>tral to human health. Globally, life expectancy has increased by almost twenty years 
</p>
<p>since the 1950s.18 This can be attributed in substantial part to advances in scientific 
</p>
<p>knowledge about disease and to increased access to such knowledge, for example, 
</p>
<p>as embodied in better sanitation and vaccines.19 The rise of new forms of knowl-
</p>
<p>edge management and the application of sophisticated information-processing </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>a conceptual genealogy 21
</p>
<p>schemes to fields such as health and agriculture means that our relationships to 
</p>
<p>our very bodies&mdash;how we eat, whether we live&mdash;are more intimately governed by 
</p>
<p>scientific and technical knowledge and information than ever before.
</p>
<p> For Castells, as well as for earlier theorists such as Daniel Bell, not just our 
</p>
<p>economies, but our societies thus have become increasingly knowledge inten-
</p>
<p>sive or informational. In this sociological conception, changes in our ability to 
</p>
<p>codify, communicate, and process knowledge have inaugurated a new relation-
</p>
<p>ship between knowledge and society. This shift is reflected, for example, in a new 
</p>
<p>ordering of occupations, one in which professional and technical classes gain pre-
</p>
<p>eminence.20 It is also reflected in governance, because policy formation is newly 
</p>
<p>focused around knowledge and expertise &ldquo;for the purpose of social control and the 
</p>
<p>directing of innovation and change.&rdquo;21
</p>
<p> For example, the rise of statistics and the field of &ldquo;political arithmetic&rdquo; led to 
</p>
<p>the development of the modern census, which made possible the use of popula-
</p>
<p>tion data in government for the first time.22 New fields of social knowledge such 
</p>
<p>as psychoanalysis, penology, and pedagogy also came into being, subjecting the 
</p>
<p>human to new forms of technological production and surveillance.23 Knowledge 
</p>
<p>thus has become central to the &ldquo;activities of government and to the very formation 
</p>
<p>of its objects, for government is a domain of cognition, calculation, experimenta-
</p>
<p>tion and evaluation.&rdquo;24 From philosophy to medicine, accounting to education, and 
</p>
<p>town planning to social insurance, &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and technology make modern gov-
</p>
<p>ernance possible.25
</p>
<p> New systems of knowledge and information technologies also inaugurate shifts 
</p>
<p>in the relationship between individuals and these processes of economic produc-
</p>
<p>tion, social control, and governance. The digital network revolution, for example, 
</p>
<p>places the technologies of information production and exchange in the hands 
</p>
<p>of (at least some) &ldquo;average&rdquo; citizens in a way that was not true in the era of the 
</p>
<p>industrial assembly line and the printing press. As Yochai Benkler argues, the con-
</p>
<p>temporary processing power of computers ubiquitously linked together creates a 
</p>
<p>platform for new kinds of collaborative human action and production, exemplified 
</p>
<p>by projects such as Wikipedia and free software. This shift creates the potential 
</p>
<p>for &ldquo;an increasing role for nonmarket production in the information and cultural 
</p>
<p>production sector, organized in a radically more decentralized pattern than was 
</p>
<p>true of this sector in the twentieth century.&rdquo; It also creates the possibility of new 
</p>
<p>forms of political activism and new relationships between those who govern and 
</p>
<p>those who are governed.26 One new arena where this activism has developed and 
</p>
<p>where the relationship between those who govern and those who are governed has 
</p>
<p>played out is the realm of intellectual property law, which has expanded globally 
</p>
<p>to an unprecedented extent in the past few decades.</p>

<p>a conceptual genealogy 23
</p>
<p>the rise of intellectual property law
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights are legal entitlements that give their holders the ability 
</p>
<p>to prevent others from copying or deploying the covered information in specific 
</p>
<p>ways. Patents, copyrights, and trademarks are the most familiar forms of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property.27 Each regulates information in a different way. Patents typically 
</p>
<p>cover forms of technological invention&mdash;once things such as machines and mouse-
</p>
<p>traps and today things such as new molecules, plant varieties, and software. By 
</p>
<p>describing his invention and showing that it is new, useful, and &ldquo;nonobvious,&rdquo; an 
</p>
<p>inventor can obtain a patent that gives him the right to prevent others from mak-
</p>
<p>ing, using, or selling the invention for a period of 20 years. Copyrights typically 
</p>
<p>cover expressive or literary works&mdash;classically, maps, charts, and books, but today 
</p>
<p>also things such as sound recordings and software. The holder of a copyright can 
</p>
<p>prevent others from copying or performing the protected expression or creating 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;derivatives&rdquo; of that expression (for example, creating a screenplay out of a novel) 
</p>
<p>for upward of 100 years.28 Trademarks protect the use of a distinctive trade name 
</p>
<p>in commerce, permitting the holder of the mark (for example, Rolex&trade;) to restrict 
</p>
<p>its use, most centrally to ensure that consumers are not confused about the origin 
</p>
<p>of a good.29
</p>
<p> The grouping of these different modes of regulation under the rubric of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property is not uncontroversial.30 Nonetheless, the rubric usefully helps 
</p>
<p>us to identify a mode of legal regulation that applies to different areas of tech-
</p>
<p>nology and commerce. In an alchemy that turns immaterial expressions and ideas 
</p>
<p>into tradable commodities, intellectual property rights effectively give creators 
</p>
<p>the ability to market information while also preventing it from being imitated and 
</p>
<p>reproduced by others. These rights can, of course, lead to substantial revenues 
</p>
<p>for those who hold them (and also to substantial economic costs for society, as 
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll describe in a moment). Less obviously, but no less importantly, intellectual 
</p>
<p>property doctrines that govern the ownership of creations made in the course 
</p>
<p>of employment structure the distribution of benefits between corporations and 
</p>
<p>employees. The so-called &ldquo;work for hire&rdquo; doctrine, for example, regulates whether 
</p>
<p>the inventions or creations that a person makes at work belong to her or to her 
</p>
<p>employer, and over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, 
</p>
<p>this doctrine became far more favorable to employers.31
</p>
<p> But shifts in intellectual property law, like shifts in the way that knowl-
</p>
<p>edge and information matter, have effects beyond the domain of the economy.  
</p>
<p>They also directly mediate human experience, well-being, and freedom. The 
</p>
<p>rules of copyright, for example, regulate who can speak and read. Examples of 
</p>
<p>copyright owners seeking to censor speech with which they disagree emerge </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski24
</p>
<p>with relentless regularity. Copyright also endemically shapes how we learn and 
</p>
<p>think, because, for example, it affects the prices of textbooks and the viability of  
</p>
<p>online archives.
</p>
<p> Intellectual property law is perhaps at its most controversial in public debates 
where it regulates life itself&mdash;that is, in the domain of medicine. Because patents 
</p>
<p>limit competition, they tend to raise the price of pharmaceuticals. That can put 
</p>
<p>life-saving treatments out of reach, especially for the world&rsquo;s poor. Patents also 
</p>
<p>shape the priorities of our medical research and development (R&amp;D) system. Our 
</p>
<p>existing system, which relies heavily on patents&mdash;and thus on high prices&mdash;to 
</p>
<p>incentivize R&amp;D has directed enormous sums into treating the ailments of the very 
</p>
<p>rich and almost nothing into treating those of the very poor.
</p>
<p> Because intellectual property law regulates strategies of information produc-
</p>
<p>tion and the appropriation of value from information in the marketplace, it has 
</p>
<p>become a central battleground in the struggles over the structure and spoils of 
</p>
<p>the contemporary economy. Because intellectual property law also regulates much 
</p>
<p>more&mdash;from how we are able to learn, think, and create together to how and 
</p>
<p>whether we have access to the medicines and food that we need to live&mdash;it has 
</p>
<p>become a central site of political struggle, not just locally, but globally.
</p>
<p> Both trends have been accelerated by the explosive expansion of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights that has occurred in recent years. In countries such as the United 
</p>
<p>States, for example, intellectual property rights have become broader (covering 
</p>
<p>more kinds of information), deeper (giving rights holders greater powers), and 
</p>
<p>more punitive (imposing greater penalties on infringers).32 Supplemental measures 
</p>
<p>have also been introduced to increase the technological control of rights holders 
</p>
<p>and to counter the way that digital technologies facilitate copying. Anticircumven-
</p>
<p>tion laws have been introduced, for example, that prohibit the cracking of techno-
</p>
<p>logical locks, such as forms of encryption that a copyright holder might place on a 
</p>
<p>song or DVD to control how it is played.
</p>
<p> This shift has been called a &ldquo;second enclosure movement,&rdquo; a metaphori-
</p>
<p>cal move that casts it as a modern-day analogue of the privatization of common 
</p>
<p>lands that occurred in stages in England from the fifteenth through the nineteenth  
</p>
<p>centuries.33� Metaphors of enclosure and its antipode, the commons, have been 
</p>
<p>central to the attempt to mobilize against the encroachments of exclusive rights 
</p>
<p>in the digital age. But they are also problematic.34� Drawing as it does on the post-
</p>
<p>feudal history of England, for example, the concept of enclosure domesticates what 
</p>
<p>is better understood as a global phenomenon. The most dramatic expansions of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights in recent years have occurred across, rather than within  
</p>
<p>national borders.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 25
</p>
<p>a new mode of conquest and imperium
</p>
<p>In many ways the most striking aspect of the expansion of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>law is the shift inaugurated by the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property Rights) Agreement.35 Adopted in 1995, TRIPS was the brainchild of key 
</p>
<p>players from the multinational information industries, that is, companies whose 
</p>
<p>primary business is the production and processing of information and informa-
</p>
<p>tional goods. CEOs from companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Monsanto, DuPont, 
</p>
<p>General Motors, IBM, and Warner Communications, through a high-powered  
</p>
<p>lobbying group known as the Intellectual Property Committee, persuaded the 
</p>
<p>United States, Europe, and Japan that the agreement was needed to protect their 
</p>
<p>national interests in strong intellectual property protection.36
</p>
<p> The TRIPS Agreement represented a radical shift in at least three ways. 
</p>
<p>Although treaties on intellectual property were not new (and indeed are remark-
</p>
<p>ably old), before TRIPS, such treaties were generally overseen by the WIPO. WIPO 
</p>
<p>had no enforcement capability, and countries could choose to join treaties in &ldquo;&agrave; la 
</p>
<p>carte&rdquo; fashion. TRIPS was instead to be part of the new World Trade Organization 
</p>
<p>(WTO). Under the WTO&rsquo;s &ldquo;single undertaking&rdquo; rule, countries would not be able 
</p>
<p>to join the WTO without also adhering to the TRIPS Agreement. Because the WTO 
</p>
<p>carried with it a new dispute-resolution system, violations of TRIPS would now be 
</p>
<p>punishable with trade sanctions. Finally, the intellectual property standards incor-
</p>
<p>porated into the agreement were far more expansive than those that were in force 
</p>
<p>in many countries at the time, particularly for developing countries. For example, 
</p>
<p>TRIPS required members to offer patent protection for medicines, to create prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights in new varieties of plants, and to impose criminal penalties for those 
</p>
<p>who &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; copyrighted movies or trademarked handbags.
</p>
<p> The negotiations that produced TRIPS were a terrain of open struggle between 
</p>
<p>countries of the Global North and those of the South. Developing countries gen-
</p>
<p>erally opposed the suturing of intellectual property laws into the new regime of 
</p>
<p>world trade, arguing that intellectual property law restricts, rather than promotes 
</p>
<p>free trade, that Northern countries had developed under conditions of low intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property protection, and that TRIPS is simply a mechanism to transfer 
</p>
<p>wealth from the South (overwhelmingly an importer of informational goods sub-
</p>
<p>ject to intellectual property rights) to the North (whose corporations own the vast 
</p>
<p>majority of what constitutes intellectual property today).
</p>
<p> Northern countries, led by the United States and pushed by multinational com-
</p>
<p>panies, were unyielding: Regime change in the area of intellectual property was to 
</p>
<p>be a condition for membership in the WTO. The United States was eventually able 
</p>
<p>to prevail through &ldquo;a sophisticated process of trade threats and retaliation&rdquo; that 
</p>
<p>forced key countries to yield.37 As Peter Drahos analyzes it:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski26
</p>
<p>For the U.S. state there [was] also a payoff. By helping its multinational clientele to 
</p>
<p>achieve dominium over the abstract objects of intellectual property, the U.S. goes a 
</p>
<p>long way towards maintaining its imperium. . . . A global property regime offers the 
</p>
<p>possibility that abstract objects come to be owned and controlled by a hegemonic 
</p>
<p>state. Algorithms implemented in software, the genetic information of plants and 
</p>
<p>humans, chemical compounds and structures are all examples of abstract objects 
</p>
<p>that form an important kind of capital.38
</p>
<p> TRIPS was an exceptionally audacious attempt to extract value from and exert 
</p>
<p>control over informational domains in virtually all of the countries of the world. As 
</p>
<p>such, it has less in common with localized enclosure movements than with colonial 
</p>
<p>strategies of conquest.
</p>
<p> In the words of the great chronicler of empire Joseph Conrad, &ldquo;The conquest of 
</p>
<p>the earth . . . is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much. What redeems 
</p>
<p>it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it . . . and an unselfish belief in the idea&mdash;
</p>
<p>something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifice to.&rdquo;39 Here, 
</p>
<p>that idea is one that is not propounded by any particular theorist, but rather that 
</p>
<p>is mobilized in political discourse, occupies the realm of popular political culture, 
</p>
<p>and is used to justify the dramatic expansion of intellectual property that we have 
</p>
<p>seen in recent decades.
</p>
<p>legitimating intellectual property in the information age
</p>
<p>The legitimation narrative of intellectual property today is not a coherent theory, 
</p>
<p>but a thaumatrope&mdash;two different images on a card or disk, recto and verso, that 
</p>
<p>when spun on an axis give the appearance of a single, unified image. One image is 
</p>
<p>derived from the field of information economics, but omits the skepticism about 
</p>
<p>intellectual property present in that field. The other screen is derived from the 
</p>
<p>theories of the Chicago School of economics about the superiority of private-prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights in material resources, but suppresses the many significant differences 
</p>
<p>between the economics of land and the economics of information.40
</p>
<p> We can call the result the &ldquo;despotic dominion&rdquo; account of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>law&mdash;the notion that the right to intellectual property is, or should be, as William 
</p>
<p>Blackstone described the right to material property, &ldquo;that sole and despotic domin-
</p>
<p>ion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in 
</p>
<p>total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe.&rdquo;41 Property 
</p>
<p>here is defined as the right of a single individual to be the gatekeeper with respect 
</p>
<p>to a resource and to act autocratically with respect to decisions about its use. This 
</p>
<p>vision of property is sustained by the notion that only the individual owner, and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 27
</p>
<p>not the state, community, or nonowners, may make decisions about the price or 
</p>
<p>terms of transactions around that property.
</p>
<p> This account should not be confused with actual existing intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty law (or actually existing property law, for that matter).42 Rather, the despotic 
</p>
<p>dominion account is a narrative that has been used to justify the aggressive expan-
</p>
<p>sion of intellectual property rights in recent years, and it is thus this narrative that 
</p>
<p>A2K confronts as it seeks to change the politics of intellectual property law today.
</p>
<p> The first image in the despotic dominion account draws selectively on the field 
</p>
<p>of information economics, arguing that intellectual property is needed to promote 
</p>
<p>investment in informational goods. Information, we are told, is typically expensive 
</p>
<p>to produce, but cheap to reproduce. For example, it is relatively expensive to synthe-
</p>
<p>size and test a new pharmaceutical compound or to produce a major motion picture. 
</p>
<p>Under today&rsquo;s technological conditions, it is also relatively cheap to reverse engineer 
</p>
<p>a drug or to copy a DVD. In an unregulated market, second-comers could reproduce 
</p>
<p>the drug or movie, paying only the cost of copying and without paying the full costs 
</p>
<p>of the producing of the drug or movie in the first place. These &ldquo;free riders&rdquo; would be 
</p>
<p>able to drive the innovator from the marketplace, because they would be able to sell 
</p>
<p>the drug or movie more cheaply. The result: Rational actors will not develop drugs or 
</p>
<p>make major motion pictures, because they will be unable to turn a profit, and indeed 
</p>
<p>may suffer a loss, being unable to recoup their original investment.
</p>
<p> Enter the deus ex machina of intellectual property rights. Patents and copy-
</p>
<p>rights give individuals (or more likely, firms) the right to prevent others from 
</p>
<p>copying their creations for a period of time. This lets them recoup their invest-
</p>
<p>ments and make a profit. Exclusion rights thus generate markets in information, 
</p>
<p>solving the free-rider problem and aligning individual incentives with social good.
</p>
<p> Consider the suppositions of this first image: Creative and scientific works 
</p>
<p>are best generated by rational, self-interested market actors who are motivated 
</p>
<p>by profit. Intellectual property law provides the control needed to &ldquo;incentivize&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>this creativity, because it permits individuals to profit through the sale of infor-
</p>
<p>mational goods. Individual legal entitlements such as these are necessary because 
</p>
<p>rational creators will not create if they cannot profit and/or if others can ride free. 
</p>
<p>When they can profit, creators will create in accordance with social welfare, as 
</p>
<p>expressed by demand for commodities in the marketplace. In this model, if we 
</p>
<p>want creativity and the benefits associated with it, we must pay for it. The best, 
</p>
<p>most efficient way to pay is with a system of private, individual rights.
</p>
<p> This account is not to be confused with theories of intellectual property as 
</p>
<p>articulated in the field of information economics. That field tends to be much more 
</p>
<p>ambivalent about the effects of intellectual property rights because of the ineffi-
</p>
<p>ciencies that accompany them.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski28
</p>
<p> In economic terminology, information is a &ldquo;nonrival&rdquo; good: One person may 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;consume&rdquo; it without limiting the amount available to another. Another way of 
</p>
<p>putting this is that information&mdash;inherently&mdash;is not consumable. If I have an 
</p>
<p>apple, either you can eat it, or I can eat it. (We can share it, but we can&rsquo;t each 
</p>
<p>have the whole apple.) But if I make up a catchy tune, we can both sing it. I won&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>have any less of it because you have more of it. All information&mdash;from cooking 
</p>
<p>recipes, to scientific formulas, to MP3 files&mdash;has this infinitely shareable qual-
</p>
<p>ity. In economic terms, the marginal cost of production of information is zero.43 
</p>
<p>Once a scientist divines a new scientific theory, she can share it freely without 
</p>
<p>spending any more energy or time to produce it again.44 Because the marginal cost 
</p>
<p>of information is zero, the ideal price of information in a competitive market is 
</p>
<p>also zero. As a result, intellectual property rights create &ldquo;static&rdquo; (short-run) inef-
</p>
<p>ficiencies. They tend to raise the prices of informational goods above their mar-
</p>
<p>ginal cost of production, meaning that fewer people have access to these goods  
</p>
<p>than should.45
</p>
<p> Where there are no adequate substitutes for a good, as may be the case with 
</p>
<p>a patented medicine, intellectual property rights can also generate monopolies. 
</p>
<p>Under conventional economic models, a monopolist will raise prices and reduce 
</p>
<p>output, generating more profits for itself, but also generating deadweight social 
</p>
<p>loss&mdash;a further static inefficiency.46 Intellectual property also has ambiguous 
</p>
<p>effects on dynamic (long-run) efficiency. Because information is both an input and 
</p>
<p>an output of its own production process, intellectual property gives previous cre-
</p>
<p>ators the power to tax new creators, thus raising the cost of producing the next 
</p>
<p>generation of innovations and pricing out some potential creators.
</p>
<p> Other mechanisms to promote investment in new informational goods are 
</p>
<p>widely discussed in the field of information economics. The government can pay, 
</p>
<p>as it often does, for example, with direct grants to scientists or artists or by the 
</p>
<p>creation of financial or reputational prizes that can induce innovation. When  
</p>
<p>innovation and creativity are paid for in this way, the results can be made 
</p>
<p>freely available, as they are, for example, when the U.S. government funds cer-
</p>
<p>tain basic scientific research or the creation of weather or mapping data. This 
</p>
<p>eliminates the inefficiencies associated with intellectual property rights, lead-
</p>
<p>ing eminent economists to conclude that government provisioning is superior 
</p>
<p>to intellectual property rights as a strategy to solve the provisioning problem  
</p>
<p>of information.47
</p>
<p> So why, then, should we conclude that private intellectual property rights are 
</p>
<p>superior to other systems of promoting creativity and innovation, such as direct 
</p>
<p>government funding? Here, the image drawn from information economics is 
</p>
<p>spun together with a narrative drawn from theories of the economics of private </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 29
</p>
<p>property rights in material resources (such as land) popularized in the 1980s and 
</p>
<p>1990s. Such theories, often associated with the Chicago School of economics, have 
</p>
<p>their roots in the famous account that Harold Demsetz developed of the ability 
</p>
<p>of private property to solve the &ldquo;tragedy of the commons.&rdquo;48 When property is 
</p>
<p>held in common, Demsetz argued, individuals will fail to invest in its maintenance 
</p>
<p>or improvement, because they cannot keep others from reaping the benefits of 
</p>
<p>their efforts. Common pastures will be overgrazed, because each individual farmer 
</p>
<p>has an incentive to graze his livestock beyond the point of sustainability. If his 
</p>
<p>sheep don&rsquo;t eat the grass, another farmer&rsquo;s sheep will. A system of private prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights aligns farmers&rsquo; incentives with social welfare, because it permits them 
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;internalize&rdquo; or capture the benefits of their investment in their land, as well as 
</p>
<p>suffer the harms of their failures to invest.
</p>
<p> But why is private property superior, say, to community-negotiated rules limit-
</p>
<p>ing the hours that a farmer could graze, or a government tax-and-spend regime 
</p>
<p>that organizes investments in land? Here the antiregulatory theories of the Chi-
</p>
<p>cago School come in. Individuals are characterized as generally having information 
</p>
<p>superior to that of the government (or a collective) in making investment deci-
</p>
<p>sions, as well as in valuing uses in land. If they are free to transact, on this theory, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;private&rdquo; property is more efficient than communal or state-based regulation of 
</p>
<p>property (or, more accurately, private property is the most efficient form of state-
</p>
<p>based regulation of property, since of course, a private-property regime itself is a 
</p>
<p>form of regulation). Individual farmers will know best, for example, whether land 
</p>
<p>can most profitably be used for sheep grazing or for peach farming. If a peach 
</p>
<p>farmer is able to offer to buy a sheep farmer&rsquo;s property for more than the sheep 
</p>
<p>farmer could make from farming it himself, the property will change hands and be 
</p>
<p>turned into an orchard. Since the latter use is more profitable, it is associated with 
</p>
<p>higher social welfare. Society is thus benefitted by the mutually selfish behavior of 
</p>
<p>the farmers, if they are given the tools of private property rights. Antiregulatory  
</p>
<p>theorists are also skeptical of government intervention in markets because of the 
</p>
<p>concern that state regulations or programs provide a soft target for lobbyists seek-
</p>
<p>ing to capture benefits for themselves.49
</p>
<p> Even as applied to material property such as property in land, there are many 
</p>
<p>difficulties with this account, some of which I&rsquo;ll discuss below. More importantly 
</p>
<p>for our purposes at this point, the sketch drawn from such Demsetzian theories 
</p>
<p>suppresses many of the important distinctions between information and material 
</p>
<p>goods&mdash;distinctions that are treated as essentially important in the construction 
</p>
<p>of the first image. But explaining precisely why this is so should await a discussion 
</p>
<p>of the development of the concept of the &ldquo;commons&rdquo; in the access to knowledge 
</p>
<p>movement&mdash;for it is that discussion that has made this point clear.</p>

</p>
<p>inventing a politics for the information age
</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of enclosure and conquest has emerged a field of activism 
</p>
<p>that here goes under the name of the access to knowledge movement. One mark 
</p>
<p>of this new mobilization is the attempt to articulate a common language in which 
</p>
<p>to contest the contours of existing intellectual property rules. That language has 
</p>
<p>become centered on a few key terms such as the &ldquo;public domain,&rdquo; the &ldquo;commons,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;sharing&rdquo; or &ldquo;openness,&rdquo; and &ldquo;access&rdquo; that are mobilized both to destabilize the 
</p>
<p>despotic dominion account of intellectual property and to conjure forth an alterna-
</p>
<p>tive ethic of the conditions of creativity and freedom in the information age.
</p>
<p>the public domain
</p>
<p>The concept of the public domain is central to the new politics of A2K, although 
</p>
<p>not, as we will later see, always uncontroversially so. It is drawn from judicial and 
</p>
<p>legal discourse, where it has long been used to refer to informational works that 
</p>
<p>are not covered by intellectual property law, for example, because the copyright or 
</p>
<p>patent term has expired.50 In the 1980s and 1990s, scholars critical of the expansion 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property rights seized upon the term to carve out a positive iden-
</p>
<p>tity for the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of intellectual property.51 As James Boyle put it, &ldquo;The envi-
</p>
<p>ronmentalists helped us to see the world differently, to see that there was such a 
</p>
<p>thing as &lsquo;the environment&rsquo; rather than just my pond, your forest, his canal. We 
</p>
<p>need to do the same thing in the information environment. We have to &lsquo;invent&rsquo; the 
</p>
<p>public domain before we can save it.&rdquo;52 Key here was early work of David Lange, 
</p>
<p>who argued that no intellectual property right &ldquo;should ever have affirmative rec-
</p>
<p>ognition unless its conceptual opposite is also recognized. Each right ought to be 
</p>
<p>marked off clearly against the public domain.&rdquo;53
</p>
<p> Lange&rsquo;s early articulation of the term marks the abiding influence of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property law on the concept of the public domain. The public domain here is 
</p>
<p>defined as the &ldquo;conceptual opposite&rdquo; of the domain of exclusion rights protected 
</p>
<p>by intellectual property. The same relationship is emphasized in James Boyle&rsquo;s def-
</p>
<p>inition of the public domain as &ldquo;material that is not covered by intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;reserved spaces of freedom inside intellectual property.&rdquo;54
</p>
<p> In the simplest sense, then, A2K advocates use the term positively, to bring 
</p>
<p>into focus the negative space of intellectual property law and to articulate its 
</p>
<p>importance for innovation and creativity. The public domain thus becomes not just 
</p>
<p>the opposite of intellectual property, but also an essential&mdash;and endangered&mdash;
</p>
<p>component of our creative and informational ecology. Included herein are not just 
</p>
<p>older works in the literary or technical arts, but also resources such as language 
</p>
<p>and scientific theories that are free of intellectual property rights and to which we 
</p>
<p>have a common right. Many of these resources were never protected as intellectual </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 31
</p>
<p>property at all, thus demonstrating that private rights are not necessary to the pro-
</p>
<p>duction of all informational goods. Such goods and the ability to use them freely 
</p>
<p>are also clearly central to our ability to think and create. The emphasis on the pub-
</p>
<p>lic domain thus is used to counter &ldquo;the romantic idea of creativity that needs no 
</p>
<p>raw material from which to build&rdquo; that characterizes the despotic dominion theory 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property and to call attention to the need of every creator to have 
</p>
<p>access to the scientific or cultural domain that precedes and surrounds her. Boyle, 
</p>
<p>for example, contends that the &ldquo;public domain is the place we quarry the building 
</p>
<p>blocks of our culture. It is, in fact, the majority of our culture.&rdquo;55
</p>
<p> The A2K movement calls upon the public domain in this way to make the case 
</p>
<p>that the account offered by the despotic dominion theory of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>is radically incomplete as a description of both the world as it is and the world as 
</p>
<p>it should be. Even now, in the most absolutist period of intellectual property law 
</p>
<p>we have known, our creative world remains largely beyond the reach of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights. And intellectual property rights as we know them bear little 
</p>
<p>resemblance to property rights over material resources, with far greater freedoms 
</p>
<p>reserved for nonowners. If so-called &ldquo;real property&rdquo; rights worked like copyrights, 
</p>
<p>for example, the home you built would be turned over to the public some fifty 
</p>
<p>to seventy years after your death. In the meantime, if others wanted to use your 
</p>
<p>front porch to criticize you, you would have to permit it.56 It turns out that ideas 
</p>
<p>are different from material goods and are treated as such by the law. The concept 
</p>
<p>of the public domain calls attention to this fact&mdash;a fact that the despotic dominion 
</p>
<p>account papers over.
</p>
<p> The concept of the public domain calls the despotic dominion account of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property into question in yet another way, by emphasizing the &ldquo;public&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>values that a public domain serves&mdash;and that the privatization of intellectual cre-
</p>
<p>ations threatens. This is the public domain as opposed to the private domain&mdash;the 
</p>
<p>domain that the despotic dominion conception of intellectual property equates 
</p>
<p>with the public good.
</p>
<p> We can begin by asking what is &ldquo;public&rdquo; about the public domain. Is it public 
</p>
<p>like a public park? Like public assistance? Like the public good? Like a public fig-
</p>
<p>ure? A2K narratives about the public domain treat what is public as synonymous 
</p>
<p>with what is &ldquo;open to all,&rdquo; but in two different dimensions: that of permission and 
</p>
<p>that of price.
</p>
<p> Public-domain material is presented as important to our creative ecology, on 
</p>
<p>the one hand, because one need not ask permission to use it&mdash;which is to say, 
</p>
<p>no one has the legal privilege to deny another the ability to use it. If you want to 
</p>
<p>rewrite a Jane Austen novel, retaining most of her words, but inserting zombies, 
</p>
<p>no representative of Austen&rsquo;s estate can deny you permission, because the work </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski32
</p>
<p>is now in the public domain.57 A2K advocates thus celebrate the public domain as 
</p>
<p>a place free of the political control or personal caprice of others. This is contrasted 
</p>
<p>with the world of intellectual property, where owners of works may stop others 
</p>
<p>from using their creations in ways of which they disapprove.58 When DJ Danger 
</p>
<p>Mouse became an overnight sensation for an album remixing the Beatles and Jay-Z,  
</p>
<p>for example, he also earned the attention of lawyers for the Beatles&rsquo;s label, who 
</p>
<p>forced him to stop distributing the album. Copyright facilitates consolidated con-
</p>
<p>trol and disrupts semiotic recoding. The need to obtain permission, A2K advocates 
</p>
<p>argue, is thus in tension with the desire for an open and democratic culture.59
</p>
<p> The public domain is &ldquo;public&rdquo; in another sense. Like a public street, it may be 
</p>
<p>traversed and used by all comers without individualized permission. But also like 
</p>
<p>a public street (if not necessarily a public highway), it may be traversed without 
</p>
<p>payment. (In the phraseology of Richard Stallman of free software fame, it is both 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;free as in speech&rdquo; and &ldquo;free as in beer.&rdquo;) No one pays for what they take from the 
</p>
<p>public domain (there is no licensing fee), so works available in the public domain 
</p>
<p>are available, in theory, at or close to their marginal cost of distribution&mdash;the 
</p>
<p>cost of printing and selling a book, for example, without an additional fee for the 
</p>
<p>author who wrote it. And of course, in a world of pervasive digital networks, the 
</p>
<p>cost of distribution indeed moves toward zero, meaning that works out of copy-
</p>
<p>right may be available for no cost at all. The public domain thus has a differential 
</p>
<p>value for those who have limited financial means. In this sense, it is public in the 
</p>
<p>way that public assistance is public&mdash;it represents a kind of state subsidy for those 
</p>
<p>who cannot afford the licensing fees and lawyering costs associated with private 
</p>
<p>markets in information.60
</p>
<p>the commons
</p>
<p>The commons is another concept critical to the attempt by A2K theorists to con-
</p>
<p>struct a collective object for their politics. It draws upon the history of property 
</p>
<p>in land and more particularly upon the enclosure of communally managed field 
</p>
<p>and forest resources in Europe. Unlike the public domain, the commons as con-
</p>
<p>ceived of by the A2K movement is governed,61 but unlike private property, the 
</p>
<p>commons is governed collectively.62 It is not free of the requirement of permission 
</p>
<p>(or, necessarily, of price), but demands permission from a collective, rather than  
</p>
<p>an individual.
</p>
<p> Free software is often cited as the paradigmatic example of an informational 
</p>
<p>commons.63 It is written by legions of volunteers who are not hierarchically orga-
</p>
<p>nized or governed in the way that employees within a firm are organized and gov-
</p>
<p>erned. This is not to say that there is no governance of open-source projects&mdash;on 
</p>
<p>the contrary, such projects may be highly organized and closely managed. Such </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 33
</p>
<p>projects are also not entirely without either hierarchy or stratification.64 But they 
</p>
<p>are more modular, participatory, collaborative, and open than equivalent projects 
</p>
<p>organized in proprietary firms.65
</p>
<p> Free software depends upon a &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo; licensing scheme developed by pro-
</p>
<p>grammers. The best-known such license, the GNU General Public License or GPL, 
</p>
<p>turns copyright on its head by mandating sharing, rather than exclusivity&mdash;it 
</p>
<p>permits users to modify, copy, and share the covered work as long as they pass 
</p>
<p>along to others these same freedoms.66 This is a commons of enforced cooperation, 
</p>
<p>where those who participate are assured that their efforts will manifest themselves 
</p>
<p>in a collective product that they may all access in the future with the added benefit 
</p>
<p>of one another&rsquo;s contributions. Programmers do not have the ability to determine 
</p>
<p>unilaterally the terms of the licensing of free software, but decisions about free 
</p>
<p>software are subject to community comment and deliberation and to the collec-
</p>
<p>tive ability of communities of programmers to vote with their labor hours.67 They 
</p>
<p>also have certain rights that those working in a proprietary context as a rule would 
</p>
<p>not&mdash;primary among them, the assurance that they will continue to have access to 
</p>
<p>the software they help produce on equal terms with all others, to exploit for profit 
</p>
<p>or otherwise.
</p>
<p> The commons as invoked by A2K advocates works in two ways to undermine 
</p>
<p>the despotic dominion conception of intellectual property. At times, A2K theorists 
</p>
<p>call upon the term to distinguish a material commons (for example, a grazing com-
</p>
<p>mons or a collectively managed fishery) from a commons of the mind. The despotic 
</p>
<p>dominion justification for private property, recall, is based on the presumption that 
</p>
<p>individuals will overuse a resource if not disciplined by private property rights.
</p>
<p> But as Boyle explains it:
</p>
<p>Unlike the earthy commons, the commons of the mind is generally &ldquo;non-rival.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Many uses of land are mutually exclusive. If I am using the field for grazing, it may 
</p>
<p>interfere with your plan to use it for growing crops. By contrast, a gene sequence, 
</p>
<p>an MP3 file, or an image may be used by multiple parties; my use does not interfere 
</p>
<p>with yours. To simplify a complicated analysis, this means that the threat of overuse 
</p>
<p>of fields and fisheries is generally not a problem with the informational or innova-
</p>
<p>tional commons.68
</p>
<p>In other words, we are more likely to see in the informational domain what property 
</p>
<p>scholar Carol Rose has called a &ldquo;comedy of the commons&rdquo; than a tragedy of the com-
</p>
<p>mons, because more use tends to produce social gains, rather than social losses.69
</p>
<p> But A2K advocates also use the concept of the commons to invoke the suc-
</p>
<p>cessful history of common property schemes in material goods and thus to under-
</p>
<p>mine the contention that individual management of resources is superior to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski34
</p>
<p>collective management. Elinor Ostrom recently won a Nobel Prize in economics, 
</p>
<p>in part for the work she did to document and analyze prosperous and stable com-
</p>
<p>mons regimes governing rival resources such as land and fisheries, demonstrating 
</p>
<p>that communities can organize both investment in and extraction of resources to 
</p>
<p>ensure sustainability.70 As Roberto Verzola points out in this volume, for example, 
</p>
<p>a herder with a long-term and cooperative viewpoint would see the potential for 
</p>
<p>the collapse predicted by theorists of &ldquo;the tragedy of the commons&rdquo; and work with 
</p>
<p>others to avoid that result.71 With a presumption of cooperation and foresight, the 
</p>
<p>narrative of the tragedy of the commons can thus be inverted, resulting in &ldquo;a sys-
</p>
<p>tem of insurance or social security, a type of commons that reduces individual risk 
</p>
<p>by pooling resources.&rdquo;72
</p>
<p> The concept of the commons is thus intended to do important work to dele-
</p>
<p>gitimate the despotic dominion conception of intellectual property. On the one 
</p>
<p>hand, it calls upon the differences between the immaterial and the material to 
</p>
<p>demonstrate that tragedy is far less likely in the former case. On the other, it 
</p>
<p>rejects the view that tragedy necessarily follows common management of mate-
</p>
<p>rial resources, insisting instead that collective management can work. It insists 
</p>
<p>upon the viability of an alternative governance regime for intellectual property&mdash;
</p>
<p>one characterized by relatively flat hierarchies and where the rights of individu-
</p>
<p>als to participate in decision making as well as to participate on equal terms as 
</p>
<p>creators and beneficiaries are central. To call upon the image of the commons is 
</p>
<p>to insist that communities, without the imposition of market or governmental 
</p>
<p>ordering systems, have the power and perhaps the right to set the terms of their  
</p>
<p>collective endeavors.
</p>
<p> Here the discourse of the commons meets up with that of the public domain, 
</p>
<p>suggesting that more communal strategies of governance do better than a despotic 
</p>
<p>dominion model at facilitating broadly distributed collaboration, soliciting forms 
</p>
<p>of effort and motivation that may be crowded out in a corporate and proprietary 
</p>
<p>(which is to say, profit-motivated, more hierarchical) context, and facilitating par-
</p>
<p>ticipatory decision-making processes.
</p>
<p>sharing and openness
</p>
<p>Sharing and openness are prominent memes in the A2K movement, deployed, to 
</p>
<p>name just a few examples, for &ldquo;share and share alike&rdquo; copyright licenses, &ldquo;open-
</p>
<p>source software,&rdquo; &ldquo;open standards,&rdquo; and &ldquo;open-access publishing.&rdquo;73
</p>
<p> Sharing and openness are here posited against the ethic of exclusion embod-
</p>
<p>ied in the despotic dominion conception of intellectual property. A &ldquo;share and share 
</p>
<p>alike&rdquo; license in the context of copyright, for example, uses the exclusive right per-
</p>
<p>mitted by copyright against itself, requiring those who modify or build upon the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 35
</p>
<p>work to share their work with others. Copyleft licenses are premised on the same 
</p>
<p>move. In open standards and open-access publishing, &ldquo;openness&rdquo; refers to different 
</p>
<p>practices. The former insists that technical standards not be dominated by the rights 
</p>
<p>of certain intellectual property owners and the latter that certain publications (for 
</p>
<p>example, those that are the product of research funded by the government) be made 
</p>
<p>available in databases that are available generally to the public without a fee.74
</p>
<p> What work does an insistence on sharing and openness do when measured 
</p>
<p>against the despotic dominion account of intellectual property? For one thing, it 
</p>
<p>raises a challenge to the neoclassical model of the rational, self-interested actor 
</p>
<p>upon which that account is based. As Yochai Benkler has noted, the very existence 
</p>
<p>of free software, which is developed largely by unpaid volunteers who participate 
</p>
<p>on the condition that their work will be shared freely with others, demonstrates 
</p>
<p>that a model based on profit-driven self-interest is radically incomplete.75 There is 
</p>
<p>room for debate over the volunteers&rsquo; motivations, but as Boyle puts it:
</p>
<p>Assume a random distribution of incentive structures in different people, a global 
</p>
<p>network: transmission, information sharing and copying costs that approach zero, 
</p>
<p>and a modular creation process. With these assumptions, it just does not matter 
</p>
<p>why they do it. In lots of cases, they will do it. One person works for love of the 
</p>
<p>species, another in the hope of a better job, a third for the joy of solving puzzles, 
</p>
<p>and so on. . . . Under these conditions . . . we will get distributed production without 
</p>
<p>having to rely on the proprietary/exclusion model. The whole enterprise will be 
</p>
<p>much, much, much greater than the sum of the parts.76
</p>
<p> The notion that the &ldquo;whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; is central to 
</p>
<p>understanding the ideal of sharing and openness. If the whole is greater than the 
</p>
<p>sum of its parts, the parts cannot be adequately described or divided from one 
</p>
<p>another. In other words, we cannot isolate and locate credit, labor, or value for 
</p>
<p>creative endeavors in any individual or set of individuals. The maxim can also be 
</p>
<p>understood as an insistence that the thing being &ldquo;summed&rdquo;&mdash;here, the creative 
</p>
<p>endeavor&mdash;happens not within individuals, but among a group. This is an insis-
</p>
<p>tence on the generativity of the crowd, on the notion that there is a creative and 
</p>
<p>productive force that resides between, rather than within individuals&mdash;or more 
</p>
<p>radically, in the infrastructure of their connection, in the network itself. As free-
</p>
<p>software theorist Eben Moglen memorably puts it, &ldquo;if you wrap the Internet around  
</p>
<p>every person on the planet and spin the planet, software flows in the network. It&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>an emergent property of connected human minds that they create things for one 
</p>
<p>another&rsquo;s pleasure and to conquer their uneasy sense of being too alone.&rdquo; Intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property law is then &ldquo;the resistance in the network,&rdquo; disrupting, rather than 
</p>
<p>generating creativity.77</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski36
</p>
<p> We can detect here a certain commitment to the unknowability and unquan-
</p>
<p>tifiability of the creative endeavor. We cannot, A2K advocates suggest, fully 
</p>
<p>catalogue and locate human motivations and capacities, nor can we individualize 
</p>
<p>them, as if they are established prior to and apart from exchanges between peo-
</p>
<p>ple. &ldquo;Knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;information&rdquo; are also cast as highly complex phenomena 
</p>
<p>that inevitably elude strict control or management. (How do you survey the limits 
</p>
<p>of an idea?) The domain of access to knowledge is thus pictured as a domain of 
</p>
<p>unbounded, unboundable exchange. This vision is of course opposed to the des-
</p>
<p>potic dominion notion of private property in ideas and to neoliberal theories that 
</p>
<p>put their faith in &ldquo;privatization, and the creation and defense of secure property 
</p>
<p>rights as the cure for all ills.&rdquo;78
</p>
<p> Ideals of openness and sharing, like those of the commons and the public 
</p>
<p>domain, also align the A2K movement with the political values of self-determina-
</p>
<p>tion and autonomy, as well as those of collective governance. As one open-source 
</p>
<p>proponent puts it:
</p>
<p>Proprietary software increases the dependence of individuals, organizations, and 
</p>
<p>communities on external forces&mdash;typically large corporations with poor track 
</p>
<p>records on acting in the public interest. There are dependencies for support, instal-
</p>
<p>lation and problem fixing, sometimes in critical systems. There are dependencies for 
</p>
<p>upgrades and compatibility. There are dependencies when modification or extended 
</p>
<p>functionality is required. And there are ongoing financial dependencies if licensing 
</p>
<p>is recurrent. Political dependencies can result from the use of proprietary software, 
</p>
<p>too. . . . Nearly exact parallels to this exist in agriculture, where the patenting of seed 
</p>
<p>varieties and genome sequences and the creation of non-seeding varieties are used 
</p>
<p>to impose long-term dependencies on farmers. . . . Proprietary software not only 
</p>
<p>creates new dependencies: it actively hinders self-help, mutual aid, and community 
</p>
<p>development.79
</p>
<p> Others declare more grandly that &ldquo;access to software determines who may par-
</p>
<p>ticipate in a digital society&rdquo; and conclude that &ldquo;only the Free Software model grants 
</p>
<p>equal rights and freedoms to all Member States, their corporations and citizens.&rdquo;80 
</p>
<p>Or as the founder of the Linux operating system, Linus Torvalds, puts it, open-
</p>
<p>source software is like &ldquo;democracy in the sense that you don&rsquo;t surrender control.&rdquo;81
</p>
<p> The demand for sharing and openness is thus also a demand that the ability 
</p>
<p>to access and manipulate knowledge and information be democratized.82 What is 
</p>
<p>being shared and opened is not just a set of commodities, but also the processes by 
</p>
<p>which we communicate with one another and create together and the processes by 
</p>
<p>which we act as citizens of our increasingly informational societies.</p>

<p>a conceptual genealogy 37
</p>
<p>access
</p>
<p>A2K also invests with great significance the concept of &ldquo;access.&rdquo; First associated 
</p>
<p>with the access-to-medicines campaign, the importance of the term to the broader 
</p>
<p>coalition is perhaps best marked by its presence in the name &ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>itself.83 The demand for access is an inherently relational one&mdash;a claim from those 
</p>
<p>excluded that they be included, that they be given something that others already 
</p>
<p>enjoy. In this sense, it marks perhaps the only&mdash;or at least the most prominent&mdash;
</p>
<p>demand for distributive justice emanating from the A2K movement, which other-
</p>
<p>wise borrows more from discourses of freedom.84
</p>
<p> How, then, are we to understand this demand? We can begin by considering 
</p>
<p>the development of the campaign for access to medicines. Although the claim 
</p>
<p>might seem to be very simply a demand that medicines available to the rich also 
</p>
<p>be made available to the poor, from its inception, the movement has been inti-
</p>
<p>mately bound up with claims about intellectual property. It emerged from the cru-
</p>
<p>cible of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic and specifically from the recognition that 
</p>
<p>treatment would never be available to the vast majority of those who needed it 
</p>
<p>unless the prices of medicines could be reduced. At the time that the campaign 
</p>
<p>began, AIDS medicines sold for about $10,000 per patient per year. Activists versed 
</p>
<p>in intellectual property law such as James Love teamed up with groups such as 
</p>
<p>M&eacute;dicins Sans Fronti&egrave;rs to demonstrate that this price is not a fact of nature or a 
</p>
<p>reflection of the sophistication of antiretroviral medicines, but rather an artifact of 
</p>
<p>patent law. Generic copies of the medicines cost as little as $350 per year (and even 
</p>
<p>less today), but patents&mdash;and the aggressively propatent trade policies of coun-
</p>
<p>tries such as the United States&mdash;stood in the way.
</p>
<p> The demand for access to AIDS medicines has thus been, from the beginning, a 
</p>
<p>demand for access to copies of AIDS medicines. Or, as the logo of the AIDS activist 
</p>
<p>group Act Up&ndash;Paris puts it:
</p>
<p> The emblem illustrates two important elements in the demand for access. First, 
</p>
<p>claims to access are framed squarely against the backdrop of intellectual property. 
</p>
<p>Second, they are rooted in claims of right that supersede the claims of right made 
</p>
<p>by owners of intellectual property. The right to the copy claimed by activists is 
</p>
<p>written over the right of the copy claimed by rights holders.
</p>
<p> The demand for access thus appears first as a refusal. It emanates not from </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski38
</p>
<p>the discourse of intellectual property, but from the language of human rights.85 It 
</p>
<p>seeks to elevate the latter over the former, as through the demand, commonly seen 
</p>
<p>at access-to-medicines demonstrations, for &ldquo;patients&rsquo; rights not patent rights.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> At the level of the slogan, the concept of access seems to embody an outright 
</p>
<p>rejection of the logic of intellectual property and of the type of cost-benefit analy-
</p>
<p>ses and arguments about innovation upon which it is based. In fact, however, the 
</p>
<p>discourse of access-to-medicines campaigners has become intimately bound up 
</p>
<p>with the logic of intellectual property, because their attempt to contest the legiti-
</p>
<p>macy narrative of intellectual property law has drawn them into the economic dis-
</p>
<p>course that dominates the field.
</p>
<p> As activists sought to challenge the existing law of intellectual property, they 
</p>
<p>found themselves up against the despotic dominion account of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty. Calling upon this account, pharmaceutical companies insisted that they, too, 
</p>
<p>are in the &ldquo;access&rdquo; business and that patents are the only way to ensure the devel-
</p>
<p>opment of new medicines. The conditions of access are contested, that is, pre-
</p>
<p>cisely in the terms of the discourse underlying the concept of intellectual property, 
</p>
<p>requiring A2K advocates to do more than simply argue that they are for access 
</p>
<p>because they are opposed to exclusive rights in medicines. The demand for access 
</p>
<p>is by necessity constructed on a deeper theory of what it means to make medicines 
</p>
<p>accessible&mdash;one that is built upon the values of freedom and openness that are 
</p>
<p>evolving within the discourse of the A2K movement, but anchored in the demands 
</p>
<p>for distributive justice that motivate the call for access.
</p>
<p> Access-to-medicines campaigners argue, for example, not only that patents 
</p>
<p>artificially raise prices and thus hurt patients, but also that they do not provide 
</p>
<p>the innovation benefits that the despotic dominion account claims for them, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly for the poor. They point out, for example, that patent-based innovation 
</p>
<p>systems link innovation to high prices. Because the poor cannot pay these high 
</p>
<p>prices, patent-based companies ignore the needs of the poor and instead cater to 
</p>
<p>the needs of the rich.� Thus, we have a pharmaceutical R&amp;D system that prioritizes 
</p>
<p>drugs for baldness and erectile dysfunction over lifesaving treatments for ailments 
</p>
<p>such as tuberculosis and malaria.
</p>
<p> They also point out that patents can create barriers to research and thus inter-
</p>
<p>fere with innovation&mdash;and argue that they are particularly likely to do so where 
</p>
<p>poor patients are concerned. They point out, for example, that multinational com-
</p>
<p>panies that make AIDS drugs were unwilling to undertake the negotiations that 
</p>
<p>would have been needed to combine the multiple drugs needed for the HIV cock-
</p>
<p>tail into a single pill that would be easier for patients to take. The work was first 
</p>
<p>done not by patent-holding firms, but by Indian generic companies that were 
</p>
<p>unconstrained by patents. Like the discourses of the public domain and openness, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 39
</p>
<p>the discourse of access here attacks the despotic dominion account&rsquo;s claim that 
</p>
<p>intellectual property invariably promotes innovation. Unlike the other concepts, 
</p>
<p>this one makes central a distributive justice claim&mdash;that freedom from intellectual 
</p>
<p>property restrictions is especially important to the poor.
</p>
<p> The access-to-medicines campaign also takes aim at the model of private con-
</p>
<p>trol that is central to the despotic dominion account. Notably, access-to-medicines 
</p>
<p>campaigners have consistently opposed drug company donation programs, staking 
</p>
<p>a claim for a form of access that is defined by nonexclusive sharing of the informa-
</p>
<p>tional component of drugs, rather than their price per se.87
</p>
<p> Why? Why would it matter where the drugs come from, as long as they come? 
</p>
<p>For access-to-medicines campaigners, the issue is one of accountability and con-
</p>
<p>trol. They argue that drug company donation programs are unacceptable because 
</p>
<p>they leave power over life in the hands of private actors, who retain the privilege 
</p>
<p>of charity, the privilege to make good on their promises or not. Overriding pat-
</p>
<p>ents is cast as a way to insist instead on values of participation and accountability. 
</p>
<p>The demand for access to medicines, like the call for free software, thus places the 
</p>
<p>concept of democracy at the center of the A2K movement and opposes it to the 
</p>
<p>despotic dominion conception of intellectual property.
</p>
<p>four questions for a2k
</p>
<p>The concepts that A2K activists are developing and articulating and around which 
</p>
<p>they are mobilizing create a set of political commitments and the contours of a 
</p>
<p>movement through a process of accretion. These concepts often coincide, but they 
</p>
<p>are also at times in tension with one another. The same can be said of some of the 
</p>
<p>values and discourses that A2K activists draw upon when making their arguments. 
</p>
<p>Having mapped the central concepts of the discourse of A2K allows us to pose a 
</p>
<p>series of questions about the conceptual and political commitments being invoked. 
</p>
<p>The answers will help determine the future shape and implications of this new 
</p>
<p>field of politics. What is the nature of the freedom that A2K demands? Is A2K 
</p>
<p>committed more to the model of the public domain or of the commons, and can it 
</p>
<p>be committed to both? Is information really different enough from material goods? 
</p>
<p>And finally, can the A2K movement in fact make good on its attempt to create a 
</p>
<p>politics not just of information, but also of knowledge? Or to put it another way, 
</p>
<p>what are the proper limits of the politics of A2K?
</p>
<p>what is the nature of the freedom that a2k demands?
</p>
<p>Often, A2K thinkers speak of freedom (such as the freedom of the public domain) 
</p>
<p>as a place free of permission. Lawrence Lessig states it most plainly: &ldquo;The opposite </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski40
</p>
<p>of a free culture is a &lsquo;permission culture.&rsquo;&rdquo;88 But are A2K advocates really commit-
</p>
<p>ted to a vision that posits freedom as a space where one never needs permission&mdash;
</p>
<p>as a space beyond control? If so, what of the very substantial controls that some 
</p>
<p>groups, from free-software programmers to proponents of traditional knowledge, 
</p>
<p>seek to impose upon certain forms of knowledge? Creative Commons, a high-pro-
</p>
<p>file organization that Lessig himself founded, offers individuals a set of copyright 
</p>
<p>licenses that they can use to give others more freedoms than copyright law other-
</p>
<p>wise would. But some of these licenses&mdash;not uncontroversially within A2K circles&mdash;
</p>
<p>preclude others from creating derivative works, making use of precisely the power 
</p>
<p>of permission in the service of authorial control.
</p>
<p> In fact, no such simple principle of opposition to control can be derived from 
</p>
<p>the thought of A2K. If it could, it would commit A2K also to a series of what are 
</p>
<p>likely to be untenable positions with respect to nonproperty forms of control that 
</p>
<p>can be described as demands for &ldquo;permission,&rdquo; such as those related to privacy and 
</p>
<p>network security. Is it in fact possible to assume a simple opposition between free-
</p>
<p>dom and control, or are the two instead intimately interconnected and interdepen-
</p>
<p>dent in the age of digital networks?89 A2K advocates must envision a particular 
</p>
<p>mode of control or demand for permission that they oppose. How, though, should 
</p>
<p>this be characterized?
</p>
<p> The A2K movement&rsquo;s conception of freedom also contains within it a certain 
</p>
<p>fractured relationship to markets. The public domain, for example, is sometimes 
</p>
<p>figured as a space free from markets, a space where noncommercially motivated 
</p>
<p>creators have the resources and room to play.90 At other times&mdash;and perhaps more 
</p>
<p>often&mdash;it is figured as a space free for markets where not only amateurs can for-
</p>
<p>age, but where corporations can compete without monopolies, to the benefit of 
</p>
<p>the public as consumers.91 Can the same domain be both the space of freedom 
</p>
<p>from commerce and the space of freedom for commerce?
</p>
<p> When A2K advocates articulate the public domain as a space that is equally&mdash;
</p>
<p>and properly&mdash;open to the exploitation of capital and communities alike, it sug-
</p>
<p>gests that this competition is itself a free and equal one. But is the public domain 
</p>
<p>in fact universally &ldquo;free&rdquo; in a substantive fashion, when those who create from 
</p>
<p>its resources may enclose the results? Does leaving the public domain free in this 
</p>
<p>sense simply mean that those with resources will be able to make use of this (pub-
</p>
<p>licly renewed and subsidized) resource and then enclose the results, to the sys-
</p>
<p>tematic disadvantage of those who continue to operate outside of the confines of 
</p>
<p>property? Is this freedom a structurally unequal freedom, one that can be rem-
</p>
<p>edied only by a positive concept of public property (or of a commons) that cannot 
</p>
<p>be the subject of such extraction?
</p>
<p> This question is raised most acutely by groups focused on the Global South, such  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 41
</p>
<p>as the farmers&rsquo; rights group GRAIN, which expresses skepticism about &ldquo;the mer-
</p>
<p>its of concepts such as the &lsquo;public domain&rsquo; . . . if putting seeds in the public domain 
</p>
<p>means Monsanto can inject them with Terminator genes to destroy peasant agri-
</p>
<p>culture.&rdquo;92 The muted (or repressed) debate within the A2K movement over the 
</p>
<p>proper status of traditional knowledge (is it rightfully the property of local com-
</p>
<p>munities, or part of the public domain open to all?) also evinces the strains  
</p>
<p>of this tension.93
</p>
<p> Finally, can the freedom imagined by A2K be produced by merely formal lack 
</p>
<p>of (the wrong kind of) constraint, for example, by the lack of the constraints 
</p>
<p>imposed by intellectual property law? Or does it require something more substan-
</p>
<p>tive, an affirmative ability, for example, to access works in the public domain, or 
</p>
<p>the tools of the new &ldquo;remix culture&rdquo;?94 Is the freedom of the public domain or the 
</p>
<p>commons really worthy of the name if the majority of the world has no access 
</p>
<p>to the means needed to participate in it&mdash;for example, education, computers, and 
</p>
<p>affordable access to digital networks? At the close of 2007, only one-fifth of the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s population was using the Internet, and this use was highly skewed geo-
</p>
<p>graphically: Only 4 percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa had such access.95 
</p>
<p>Although A2K thinkers invoke a robust conception of freedom that would require 
</p>
<p>the ability in fact to access the goods of which they speak, in practice, they devote 
</p>
<p>little attention to the profound inequalities in access to digital networks.96 Can 
</p>
<p>A2K advocates really claim to have a vision of freedom in the digital age if they do 
</p>
<p>not do more to theorize and demand affirmative access to the tools to create and 
</p>
<p>exchange information and knowledge?
</p>
<p>is a2k committed more to the model of the public domain  
</p>
<p>or of the commons? can it be committed to both?
</p>
<p>The A2K movement valorizes the space of both the public domain and the com-
</p>
<p>mons, and yet as we&rsquo;ve seen, these two spaces are governed in importantly different  
</p>
<p>ways. The commons is controlled, often through the use of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>law itself. The public domain is instead a space beyond intellectual property law, 
</p>
<p>where no one has the right to extract permission or price.
</p>
<p> Can the A2K movement be committed to both? If so, this would require 
</p>
<p>restructuring how the commons and public domain are each understood. A2K 
</p>
<p>rhetoric today arguably pastoralizes the commons, eliding the degree to which 
</p>
<p>communal decision making may be characterized by hierarchy and exclusion, 
</p>
<p>rather than by equality and open participation. To put it differently, why should 
</p>
<p>we view a collective despot as an improvement over an individual despot?
</p>
<p> In fact, A2K advocates cannot and most of the time do not envision the com-
</p>
<p>mons as just any kind of collectivity. Some systems of collective management are, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski42
</p>
<p>after all, fully compatible with expansive conceptions of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights, such as the collective rights organizations that enforce the rights of copy-
</p>
<p>right holders in music.97 Corporations that mobilize intellectual property norms in 
</p>
<p>the service of exclusivity and maximal profit are of course in some sense &ldquo;collec-
</p>
<p>tive&rdquo; entities, governed by groups of corporate officers and answerable to share-
</p>
<p>holders. The A2K commons thus cannot be understood simply as a preference for 
</p>
<p>collective over individual governance. Some content must be given to the concept 
</p>
<p>of the collective and its terms of engagement. Like the concept of freedom, the 
</p>
<p>concept of the commons (if it is to lay claim to an ethic that differs substantially 
</p>
<p>from that of intellectual property) must be more substantively defined.
</p>
<p> As the example of free software discussed above suggests, when A2K advo-
</p>
<p>cates invoke the commons, they conjure forth a community that labors cooper-
</p>
<p>atively and that labors under shared norms. Those norms differ not just in their 
</p>
<p>recognition rule&mdash;the metarule that determines what counts as valid law&mdash;but also 
</p>
<p>in their substance from the rules of intellectual property.98 The commons of soft-
</p>
<p>ware in fact has much in common with the public domain, because its rules of 
</p>
<p>engagement are similar to those that characterize the public domain. Still, they 
</p>
<p>are not identical. Individuals can take from the public domain and not replenish 
</p>
<p>it with their creations. Moreover, its contours and rules are not established by 
</p>
<p>a community of creators, but rather by a community of citizens who authorize 
</p>
<p>the law of intellectual property&mdash;which in turn defines the limits of the public 
</p>
<p>domain. Which is the appropriate community of lawmakers, and which the appro-
</p>
<p>priate relation to what came before?
</p>
<p>is information really different enough?
</p>
<p>Within the emerging ideology of the A2K movement is a strand that envisions 
</p>
<p>it as postideology, even, perhaps, postpolitical. This is evident particularly in the 
</p>
<p>self-styled political agnosticism that characterizes the free and open-source soft-
</p>
<p>ware movement and in the writings of A2K thinkers who are most immersed in 
</p>
<p>the discourses of open source and the revolutionary potential of the networked 
</p>
<p>digital age.99 In this volume, Benkler, for example, argues that the ideas of A2K, 
</p>
<p>and in particular of &ldquo;the information commons and the rise of networked coopera-
</p>
<p>tion&rdquo; can &ldquo;subvert the traditional left-right divide . . . and provide the platform on 
</p>
<p>which political and economic interests meet around a common institutional and 
</p>
<p>organizational agenda.&rdquo; A2K can appeal, he argues, to &ldquo;libertarians, liberals, the 
</p>
<p>postsocialist left, and anarchists,&rdquo; unifying forces on the left and right that usually 
</p>
<p>understand themselves to be at odds with one another.100
</p>
<p> Such ideological catholicism, even pragmatism, is perhaps one of the most 
</p>
<p>appealing aspects of the A2K movement, particularly at a time when some on the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 43
</p>
<p>left are calling for a more serious reckoning with the benefits of well-regulated 
</p>
<p>markets and the dangers of ideological rigidity.101 But the notion that the A2K 
</p>
<p>movement can exceed the traditional divide between classical free-market liberals 
</p>
<p>and the progressive left, that A2K can embrace both the market and the nonmar-
</p>
<p>ket, and that A2K advocates need not decide between frames of freedom, justice, 
</p>
<p>or efficiency is surely contestable.
</p>
<p> At its core, the sense that the A2K movement can exceed these divides rests 
</p>
<p>crucially on the claim that information is subject to different dynamics than the 
</p>
<p>world of material goods, particularly in the networked digital age. For Benkler, 
</p>
<p>for example, it is &ldquo;the rise of the networked information economy [that] has cre-
</p>
<p>ated the material conditions for the confluence of freedom, justice, and efficacy 
</p>
<p>understood as effective learning and innovation.&rdquo; That is because in this new 
</p>
<p>environment, productivity and efficiency can be achieved through increasingly 
</p>
<p>open dynamics of sharing and cooperation, both within and outside of markets. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freedom and efficacy, then, will be the interface with both liberalisms, market 
</p>
<p>and social. Justice and freedom in the sense of the dissipation of structured, stable 
</p>
<p>hierarchical power will be the interface between liberalism and the left.&rdquo;102
</p>
<p> But the question is, is information different enough? As noted above, some 
</p>
<p>within the A2K movement doubt that the poor can compete in a realm of &ldquo;free&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>information if that freedom is granted equally to the powerful and the powerless. 
</p>
<p>To paraphrase Anatole France, is this just a kind of majestic equality that leaves 
</p>
<p>the rich and poor equally free to exploit the potential of biotechnology and soft-
</p>
<p>ware engineering? Will resources determine, ultimately, who is heard in the space 
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;free and open&rdquo; networks? Can true democratization emerge from spaces of 
</p>
<p>creation and meaning making that are not themselves first radically democratized?
</p>
<p> Or is the point of A2K thinkers instead that in the realm of information, we are 
</p>
<p>relatively more free and can do more than ever before&mdash;if not everything&mdash;to recon-
</p>
<p>cile our commitments to freedom, justice, and efficiency? There is a difference, after 
</p>
<p>all, in a competition between the subsistence fisherman and the commercial fishing 
</p>
<p>fleet and between the unknown garage band and the corporately manufactured pop 
</p>
<p>star. There are only so many fish to go around, but there is no limit, theoretically, to 
</p>
<p>the number of songs that can be written. As importantly, according to A2K advo-
</p>
<p>cates, garage bands can increasingly compete with studio-driven stars because of 
</p>
<p>the power of digital networks to give creators access to a public and the power of 
</p>
<p>these same networks to lower dramatically the costs of production of informational 
</p>
<p>goods. In the information realm, in a sense, there are always more fish, because the 
</p>
<p>fish there are subject to the rules of immaterial, rather than material goods. And 
</p>
<p>the advent of ubiquitous digital networks means a less unequal competition in the 
</p>
<p>struggle to create new information and to gain access to new publics.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski44
</p>
<p> The claim that the A2K movement can move beyond the traditional ideologi-
</p>
<p>cal battles between formal and substantive conceptions of freedom, between the 
</p>
<p>freedom of the market and freedom from the market, is thus intimately bound up 
</p>
<p>with the idea that we can move beyond scarcity in the information age. As Verzola 
</p>
<p>puts it, material abundance is limited because &ldquo;it must eventually express itself in 
</p>
<p>terms of biomass,&rdquo; but information abundance &ldquo;is of the nonmaterial variety. Thus, 
</p>
<p>information goods offer the promise of practically unlimited abundance.&rdquo;103
</p>
<p> In what sense is it useful to conceptualize information as having a kind of 
</p>
<p>abundance that exceeds the material or that is &ldquo;practically unlimited&rdquo;? Verzola 
</p>
<p>allows that the realm of information is in fact constrained, in his view &ldquo;mainly by 
</p>
<p>the limits of human creativity, the storage capacity of media, and the availability 
</p>
<p>of electricity to power servers on the Internet twenty-four hours a day.&rdquo;104 But 
</p>
<p>there is a utopian strand in A2K thinking that tends to minimize such constraints 
</p>
<p>of mind and environment, suggesting that they need not stand in the way of our 
</p>
<p>ability to think and compute our way to a more just and equal world.
</p>
<p> The most enthusiastic proponents of the biotech and open-source software 
</p>
<p>revolutions imagine an era when biology and informatics merge to move us beyond 
</p>
<p>the limits of the physical. But today, half a million women each year still die in 
</p>
<p>childbirth, almost all in developing countries and more than fifty years after the 
</p>
<p>technologies to avert almost all such deaths were developed.105 We already have 
</p>
<p>the technologies and resources to feed and care for many more people than we 
</p>
<p>currently do, suggesting that there is a primary and prominent set of problems that 
</p>
<p>are not technological, but political.106 The dynamics of networked informationalism 
</p>
<p>might help overcome political problems where those problems are rooted in strug-
</p>
<p>gles over scarce resources. They could also facilitate more transparency and politi-
</p>
<p>cal participation, addressing failures of political accountability more directly.107
</p>
<p> But critical to the postscarcity aspirations of the A2K movement are ques-
</p>
<p>tions of degree, distribution, and velocity: Will the informational component of 
</p>
<p>our world advance rapidly or evenly enough to overwhelm the persistent inequali-
</p>
<p>ties in the material? Will such advances be distributed evenly enough to make the 
</p>
<p>promise of living beyond scarcity a reality for any but the world&rsquo;s richest? Can we 
</p>
<p>expect a leveling of the pervasive material inequalities in the world if the poor lack 
</p>
<p>access to the labs, computers, and textbooks that would allow them to do more for 
</p>
<p>themselves and if they also lack access to the kind of political power and voice that 
</p>
<p>would allow them to change the terms on which resources and informational goods 
</p>
<p>are currently distributed? Can A2K advocates build a theory of freedom that is 
</p>
<p>based upon the radical political possibilities of the immaterial while also account-
</p>
<p>ing for the crucial moment when the informational intersects with the material in 
</p>
<p>the places that we create and communicate, that we live and die?</p>

<p>a conceptual genealogy 45
</p>
<p>can a2k create a politics of knowledge? what are the proper limits  
</p>
<p>of the politics of a2k?
</p>
<p>The A2K movement was deliberately structured around a demand for access to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;knowledge.&rdquo; And yet this introduction and the pages that follow make it clear 
</p>
<p>that A2K actors operate routinely in the idiom of &ldquo;information,&rdquo; for example, 
</p>
<p>extolling the importance of the information commons or the lessons of informa-
</p>
<p>tion economics. What difference might this difference make? There are at least 
</p>
<p>two ways to approach the question&mdash;by asking what A2K activists invest in their 
</p>
<p>own choice of terms and by investigating the etymological implications of the dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between information and knowledge.
</p>
<p> If A2K theorists talk often about information, why isn&rsquo;t the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>instead the A2I movement&mdash;a mobilization for &ldquo;access to information&rdquo;? Ahmed 
</p>
<p>Abdel Latif, in his account of how the term &ldquo;A2K&rdquo; was chosen, explains that &ldquo;at 
</p>
<p>the conceptual level, knowledge, rather than information, is at the heart of the 
</p>
<p>empowerment of individuals and societies. While information is certainly a pre-
</p>
<p>requisite in the generation of knowledge, acquisition of knowledge remains the 
</p>
<p>ultimate goal. Knowledge processes information to produce ideas, analysis, and 
</p>
<p>skills that ideally should contribute to human progress and civilization.&rdquo;108
</p>
<p> The decision to articulate the movement&rsquo;s demands in relation to knowledge 
</p>
<p>was in part a response to perceived conceptual differences between knowledge 
</p>
<p>and information. Knowledge is a capacity that is central to empowerment&mdash;one 
</p>
<p>that relies upon, but is not reducible to information.
</p>
<p> How precisely, though, should we understand the difference between knowl-
</p>
<p>edge and information? A2K theorists such as Benkler define the distinction in this 
</p>
<p>way: Information is &ldquo;raw data, scientific reports of the output of scientific discov-
</p>
<p>ery, news, and factual reports,&rdquo; while knowledge is &ldquo;the set of cultural practices and 
</p>
<p>capacities necessary for processing the information into either new statements into 
</p>
<p>the information exchange, or more important in our context, for practical use of 
</p>
<p>the information in appropriate ways to produce more desirable actions or outcomes  
</p>
<p>from action.&rdquo;109 Thus, information is objective and external, while knowledge is the 
</p>
<p>capacity to use information to create new information or to use information to gen-
</p>
<p>erate technical effects in the world (knowledge as &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;).
</p>
<p> This is narrower than the definition of knowledge that we might derive from 
</p>
<p>etymology or contemporary usage. According to the dictionary, we can &ldquo;know&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>anything that we understand through &ldquo;experience or association.&rdquo;110 The English 
</p>
<p>word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; corresponds to the German kennen and French conna&icirc;tre, desig-
</p>
<p>nating a kind of understanding that comes from the senses. But &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; also 
</p>
<p>incorporates the concepts of wissen and savoir, designating a kind of understand-
</p>
<p>ing that is derived from the mind. It thus designates basic acts of human cognition: </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski46
</p>
<p>recognition, acquaintance, intimacy, consciousness, or, &ldquo;the fact, state, or condi-
</p>
<p>tion of understanding.&rdquo;111
</p>
<p> In its broadest sense, then, knowledge is more than the ability to process infor-
</p>
<p>mation into more information and more know-how. As Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard 
</p>
<p>writes, knowledge is
</p>
<p>a competence that goes beyond the simple determination and application of the cri-
</p>
<p>terion of truth, extending to the determination and application of criteria of effi-
</p>
<p>ciency (technical qualification), of justice and/or happiness (ethical wisdom), of 
</p>
<p>the beauty of a sound or color (auditory or visual sensibility), etc. Understood in 
</p>
<p>this way, knowledge is what makes someone capable of forming &ldquo;good&rdquo; denotative 
</p>
<p>utterances, but also &ldquo;good&rdquo; prescriptive and &ldquo;good&rdquo; evaluative utterances. . . . It is 
</p>
<p>not a competence relative to a particular class of statements (for example, cognitive 
</p>
<p>ones) to the exclusion of all others.112
</p>
<p> Knowledge is here a capacity more than it is an object or a possession&mdash;a power 
</p>
<p>immanent to intellectual, social, cultural, and technological relations between 
</p>
<p>humans.113 Information, in turn, is the externalized object of this capacity, the part of 
</p>
<p>knowledge that can be systematized and communicated or transmitted to others.114
</p>
<p> What would it mean for the A2K movement to take the distinction between 
</p>
<p>knowledge and information seriously and to theorize itself as a movement for 
</p>
<p>access not just to information, but to knowledge? At a minimum, using the nar-
</p>
<p>rower definition of knowledge proposed by Benkler, it would require a focus not 
</p>
<p>only on extending access to information, but also on extending individual capaci-
</p>
<p>ties to produce information and to make use of information to produce practical 
</p>
<p>effects in the material world.
</p>
<p> As Benkler points out, there is &ldquo;a genuine limit on the capacity of the net-
</p>
<p>worked information economy to improve access to knowledge.&rdquo; Knowledge can-
</p>
<p>not be fully externalized into information&mdash;it is a capacity, rather than an object. 
</p>
<p>As such, it does not partake of the same dynamics of plenty that is said to char-
</p>
<p>acterize the informational domain. While better access to learning materials can 
</p>
<p>enhance education, learning by doing requires local practice, and the practice of 
</p>
<p>education generally &ldquo;does not scale across participants, time, and distance.&rdquo;115
</p>
<p> The A2K movement might focus on forms of information regulation that affect 
</p>
<p>the development of knowledge, as it has done to date in work on access to learn-
</p>
<p>ing materials, open courseware, and lowering intellectual property barriers to 
</p>
<p>distance learning. These moves are more efforts to increase access to information 
</p>
<p>than access to knowledge. If the A2K movement is to embrace its initial identifi-
</p>
<p>cation with the concept of access to knowledge, it must recognize that while access 
</p>
<p>to some information is clearly a prerequisite of building knowledge in Benkler&rsquo;s </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a conceptual genealogy 47
</p>
<p>sense, more ubiquitous access to information is not the same thing as more ubiqui-
</p>
<p>tous access to knowledge.
</p>
<p> Can the A2K movement&mdash;as invested as its logic has become in the model 
</p>
<p>of information technologies and the economics of the copy&mdash;build a politics of 
</p>
<p>knowledge as a competence? The dream of perfect (and zero-cost) transmissibility 
</p>
<p>cannot survive an encounter with this concept of knowledge, because a compe-
</p>
<p>tence that cannot be fully externalized and traded, and thus that is embedded in 
</p>
<p>the material, cannot be nonrival. And if knowledge cannot be accessed through a 
</p>
<p>simple download, then a politics of A2K must reach far beyond a politics of enclo-
</p>
<p>sure and intellectual property.
</p>
<p> Does this mean broadening the A2K mandate to include work on, for example, 
</p>
<p>the financing of primary schools or the effects of austerity budgets on universities 
</p>
<p>around the world? That is one possible outcome. More modestly, it might instead 
</p>
<p>mean that A2K groups recognize their focus is on improving access to information, 
</p>
<p>acknowledge that knowledge is not an object that can simply be downloaded from 
</p>
<p>North to South, and engage openly with those who worry that more information 
</p>
<p>could in some cases not improve, but rather threaten access to knowledge.
</p>
<p> What if the A2K movement were instead to embrace the definition of knowl-
</p>
<p>edge that corresponds not just to technical or intellectual knowledge, but also, 
</p>
<p>for example, to artistic or ethical knowledge? This would fit well with its attempt 
</p>
<p>to embrace the literary arts, as well as science and technology, but it would also 
</p>
<p>unmoor the movement from the conception of knowledge present in Benkler&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>definition. Lyotard&rsquo;s broader definition requires us to recognize that the criteria for 
</p>
<p>successful knowledge are created, rather than given.
</p>
<p> For the A2K movement, such a recognition would imply the need for a politics 
</p>
<p>not just of access to knowledge, but of what counts as knowledge and of who gets 
</p>
<p>to decide what counts. Would this work a fundamental harm to the universalizing 
</p>
<p>aspirations of the A2K movement? Or would it instead make room for A2K advo-
</p>
<p>cates to begin to reckon with existing tensions in the movement, for example, sur-
</p>
<p>rounding issues of traditional knowledge and the concept of the commons versus 
</p>
<p>the public domain?
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>A critical genealogy of the concept of access to knowledge allows us to map 
</p>
<p>the sometimes contradictory and often complex interventions that are com-
</p>
<p>ing to constitute A2K&rsquo;s theoretical commitments. The first and foremost effect 
</p>
<p>of these interventions is to destabilize the dominant legitimation narrative 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property today, the despotic dominion account that treats the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski48
</p>
<p>privatization of information as the necessary condition for its efficient production  
</p>
<p>and exploitation.
</p>
<p> But the images and values that this new lexicon draws upon should also be 
</p>
<p>examined critically as a place to think about the dilemmas that the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>faces as it seeks to consolidate its critiques of intellectual property and constitute 
</p>
<p>an affirmative vision of its aims. That is the purpose of the questions raised above: 
</p>
<p>What does A2K mean by &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;? How can it mediate between its commit-
</p>
<p>ments to the public domain and to the commons? Is information different enough 
</p>
<p>to justify the postpolitical and postscarcity elements of A2K thought? And is A2K 
</p>
<p>a movement about knowledge, or about information?
</p>
<p> These questions are offered in the spirit of committed criticism: What are those 
</p>
<p>of us engaged in A2K building? Can it be what we claim for it in our most righ-
</p>
<p>teous and universalizing moments? Who, ultimately, will decide? What might it 
</p>
<p>mean for us to win what we seek, and how might some of the paths that we have 
</p>
<p>chosen lead us further away from or closer to realizing that aim? My aim here is to 
</p>
<p>articulate these questions. If they are to be resolved, it will be through the itera-
</p>
<p>tive and networked process of debate and action that constitutes the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment itself, to which the volume that follows aims to contribute.

</p>
<p>economies are equally dependent upon informationalism&mdash;they demonstrably are not. It is 
</p>
<p>to say, rather, that distance from the centers of world finance did not insulate even the poor-
</p>
<p>est from the effects of the recent crisis. Its effects, mediated by communication technologies 
</p>
<p>and techniques such as just-in-time production, are felt through channels such as decreased 
</p>
<p>remittances and increased volatility in commodity markets. The interconnection of markets&mdash; 
</p>
<p>itself dependent upon (though not determined by) advances in information technology&mdash;is 
</p>
<p>thus one vector for the globalization of the implications of informationalism.

</p>
<p>27 New and more exotic forms of intellectual property rights have also emerged in recent years, 
</p>
<p>such as the &ldquo;geographical indications&rdquo; that reserve the use of terms such as &ldquo;Champagne&rdquo; to 
</p>
<p>sparkling wine made in certain geographical regions or the exclusive protections for data-
</p>
<p>bases that have been implemented in Europe.
</p>
<p>28 Copyright terms are required by the TRIPS Agreement to last at least fifty years plus the life 
</p>
<p>of the author, but many countries have longer terms. For example, the current term in the 
</p>
<p>United States is seventy years plus the life of the author.
</p>
<p>29 Today, trademark owners may take advantage of more expansive and controversial rights in 
</p>
<p>countries such as the United States, for example, preventing the &ldquo;dilution&rdquo; of the value of a mark,

<p>even where the use in question would not confuse consumers about the origin of a product.

</p>
<p>40 We might add a third image (at the risk of disrupting the metaphor), derived from natural 
</p>
<p>rights arguments that creators have an inherent entitlement to control or profit from their 
</p>
<p>creations. This argument is less common than the more economically oriented claims, but 
</p>
<p>turns up not infrequently in debates over copyrightable works. Again, the justification for 
</p>
<p>strong copyright as it appears in these debates suppresses substantial disagreement among 
</p>
<p>theorists about the nature and extent of any such natural rights. See, for example, Jeanne 
</p>

</p>
<p>42 Contrary to the despotic dominion account, intellectual property rights are bounded in 
</p>
<p>numerous ways. For example, they typically expire after a period of time (for example, 
</p>
<p>twenty years for a patent), are subject to affirmative rights of users (for example, research 
</p>
<p>rights in patent law and fair use rights in copyright), and may be overridden by govern-
</p>
<p>ments in certain circumstances (for example, through the mechanism of compulsory licens-
</p>
<p>ing). Rights to material property are limited by many different doctrines of property law, for 
</p>
<p>example, the law of eminent domain (which permits the government to take land for public 
</p>
<p>use in exchange for just compensation) and the doctrine of necessity (which permits indi-
</p>
<p>viduals to trespass on the land of another to prevent something such as a threat to life).
</p>
<p>43 The marginal cost of production is the cost required to produce one additional unit of the 
</p>
<p>good. For example, the marginal cost of producing the millionth watch for the next customer 
</p>
<p>is the cost to a watchmaker of producing one additional watch. The concept of marginal cost 
</p>
<p>is important to economists, because competitive-market theory indicates that in a competi-
</p>
<p>tive market, price should equal marginal cost. The watchmaker will make and sell another 
</p>
<p>watch if the next customer can pay the marginal cost.
</p>
<p>44 It may cost something to distribute the theory to others (the marginal cost of distribution 
</p>
<p>may not be zero), but that is a separate matter.
</p>
<p>45 Intellectual property rights may help solve the dynamic (long-run) problem of provisioning, 
</p>
<p>but they do so at this short-run cost&mdash;a cost that not all strategies of information production 
</p>
<p>generate.
</p>
<p>46 Deadweight loss of this sort can be eliminated with perfect price discrimination, but that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>kapczynski52
</p>
<p>is not expected in practice. The price-discrimination solution also generates distributional 
</p>
<p>effects, transferring wealth from consumers to producers.

<p>54 Boyle, The Public Domain, p. 38. In the first definition, Boyle means to include, for example,

<p>resources such as language that have never been subject to intellectual property rights, as 
</p>
<p>well as works that have fallen out of protection, for example, because the terms expired. In 
</p>
<p>the second, he means to include domains of freedom that are preserved with respect to pro-
</p>
<p>tected works, for example, the aspect of a patented invention that may be used because of 
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;experimental use&rdquo; exception to patent law.

<p>60 The public domain can be seen as a &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; in the sense that works within the pub-
</p>
<p>lic domain are either funded directly by the state (for example, the collection of weather 
</p>
<p>data or basic scientific research) or facilitated by the intellectual property rules and other 
</p>
<p>rules administered by the state. But the public domain is also unlike a subsidy for the poor, </p>

<p>61 Boyle, The Public Domain, p. 39. It is worth noting, however, that there is a genealogical (and 
</p>
<p>as far as I know, unnoticed) link between the commons and the public domain. The term 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;public domain,&rdquo; according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was to designate &ldquo;land belonging 
</p>
<p>to the public; common land.&rdquo; One could thus speak in the eighteenth century of &ldquo;cattle that 
</p>
<p>fed on the public domain.&rdquo; Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. &ldquo;Public Domain,&rdquo; available on-line

<p>medicines, the &ldquo;language of justice is most easily available and has been dominant.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>85 Thus, the manifesto of the first global march for HIV/AIDS treatment access begins not with 
</p>
<p>a discussion of patents or prices, but rather by asserting the &ldquo;fundamental rights of health-
</p>
<p>care and access to life-sustaining medicines.&rdquo; &ldquo;Global Manifesto, Treatment for All . . . Now!&rdquo;

<p>87 To be sure, activists demand free HIV medicines as well as generic HIV medicines, because 
</p>
<p>most of the people in the world living with HIV/AIDS cannot pay even the cost of generics. 
</p>
<p>But the demand is not that drug companies give the drugs away for free, but that govern-
</p>
<p>ments buy generic medicines for those in need.

<p>copyright owners&rsquo; public-performance rights. Collective management here is a strategy to

<p>Access	to	Knowledge	as	a	Field	of	Activism
</p>
<p>Ga&euml;lle Krikorian
</p>
<p>Mobilizations around issues involving access to knowledge (A2K) can be seen as 
</p>
<p>a phenomenon highly symptomatic of political as well as technological changes in 
</p>
<p>our society. The neoliberal revolution, beginning at the end of the 1970s,1 and the 
</p>
<p>emergence of digital media and the Internet, a central phenomenon of the past 
</p>
<p>two decades, are prime examples of such shifts. Both have played a role in the 
</p>
<p>contemporary trend toward the development of new and/or increasingly exclusive 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Since the late 1990s, this evolution triggered the mobi-
</p>
<p>lization of groups and individuals around the world that are now brought together 
</p>
<p>under the banner of A2K&mdash;or are perceived as belonging to a general movement.
</p>
<p> This book aims at investigating the forms that this phenomenon is taking, as 
</p>
<p>well as the changes it calls for and the transformations that it might effect in our 
</p>
<p>society. In this introduction, I intend to discuss the technical and political settings 
</p>
<p>that have provoked or sustained the existence of this movement and to explore 
</p>
<p>some of the social tensions involved. The A2K movement raises fundamental ques-
</p>
<p>tions about the conception and production of ideas, goods, and services created in 
</p>
<p>the current knowledge-based economy and about access to such ideas, goods, and 
</p>
<p>services. In doing so, and in order to be in a position to challenge effectively the 
</p>
<p>prevailing practices in these areas, it also questions more broadly the representa-
</p>
<p>tions and actions that legitimize, organize, and ensure the functioning and sustain-
</p>
<p>ability of the existing system based on intellectual property rights. It discusses 
</p>
<p>the place and role of the various actors involved in this system (the state, the 
</p>
<p>corporations, the individual, the market), as well as the relations and interactions  
</p>
<p>between them.
</p>
<p> As the A2K movement structures itself, it develops and offers its own readings 
</p>
<p>of the world&mdash;readings that invite us to explore new possibilities in apprehending 
</p>
<p>and organizing our societies&mdash;and as such could gain from the spirit of the gleaner </p>

<p>and from Michel de Certeau&rsquo;s insight that &ldquo;everyday life invents itself by poaching 
</p>
<p>in countless ways on the property of others.&rdquo;2
</p>
<p>the digital era and immaterial walls
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights protection is the main framework for the control and 
</p>
<p>regulation of the production and of the use of knowledge and information. Stan-
</p>
<p>dards of protection of intellectual property rights are established and governed in 
</p>
<p>various ways: in national laws and regulations, but also via international agree-
</p>
<p>ments, including multilateral ones such as the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of 
</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement of the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
</p>
<p>in numerous treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and 
</p>
<p>the World Customs Organization, and finally by bilateral or regional agreements, 
</p>
<p>treaties, or conventions. Over the years, the variety of institutions establishing 
</p>
<p>the norms, rules, and procedures involved in the governing of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights has stretched and expanded, thereby implicating an increasing number of 
</p>
<p>actors and an increasing variety of aspects of social life. These developments have 
</p>
<p>built on the evolution of the conception of what intellectual property rights are 
</p>
<p>and what precisely can be subjected to intellectual property laws. Thus, the inven-
</p>
<p>tion of new means of creating exclusive rights has grown all the more important in 
</p>
<p>recent decades.
</p>
<p> Though the ways in which intellectual property rights protections have been 
</p>
<p>extended may sometimes seem minor&mdash;a few words added in a law, a few concepts 
</p>
<p>reinterpreted, a chapter concerning intellectual property rights added to a free-
</p>
<p>trade agreement&mdash;their effects are often significant. The way intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights are handled also reflects changes in the strategies employed by intellectual 
</p>
<p>property owners in the face of technological as well as political developments. 
</p>
<p>They successfully have changed the goals of intellectual property law, goals rang-
</p>
<p>ing from authorizing private property while limiting access to materials held in 
</p>
<p>common to prioritizing property and its defense.3 Rather than creating physical 
</p>
<p>walls to protect material property, they have sought to create immaterial legal walls 
</p>
<p>to enclose information and knowledge, the immaterial property of the digital age.
</p>
<p> Information and knowledge are the raw material of which immaterial goods, 
</p>
<p>ideas, and inventions are made, and as such, they are key to individual as well 
</p>
<p>as collective human development and welfare.4 On the scale of the global econ-
</p>
<p>omy, what is at stake in exclusive intellectual property regimes is nothing less 
</p>
<p>than the control of existing stocks of information and knowledge and of their 
</p>
<p>flows, along with the management and harnessing of the innovations that such 
</p>
<p>information and knowledge can allow to produce. As in the current international </p>
<p/>

<p>a field of activism 59
</p>
<p>economy growth and competitiveness have become increasingly dependent on the 
</p>
<p>production, processing, and circulation of information and knowledge, the empire 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property rights was expanded. The ramifications of the intellectual 
</p>
<p>property system thus extend to techniques, technologies, know-how, and skills 
</p>
<p>in all sectors, whether they concern financial speculation, aerospace engineer-
</p>
<p>ing, medical or military research, agronomics, textiles, shipbuilding, cooking, or  
</p>
<p>music composition.
</p>
<p> The Internet and the digital era have changed the relationship of users of tech-
</p>
<p>nologies to production and creation, opening up new possibilities that quickly 
</p>
<p>have translated into the emergence of new practices. On the individual level, this 
</p>
<p>new technological context has contributed to the blurring of the line between 
</p>
<p>consumers and creators and to the characteristic status usually allocated to each, 
</p>
<p>such as passivity versus productivity, inertia versus efficiency. New technologies 
</p>
<p>and new formats (VCRs, VHS, CDs, DVDs, and so on) have made it possible for 
</p>
<p>anybody equipped with the proper equipment&mdash;and in the capitalist economy 
</p>
<p>of wealthy countries, access to such equipment has been rapidly democratized&mdash;
</p>
<p>to copy, adapt, mix, or perform sounds, images, or motion pictures. Because the 
</p>
<p>Internet facilitates large-scale and nearly instant exchanges&mdash;features that many 
</p>
<p>would recognize as being specific to contemporary &ldquo;globalization&rdquo;&mdash;creation by 
</p>
<p>means of these technologies is characterized by the marginal costs of production 
</p>
<p>and the high speed and low geographical concentration of distribution. The ways 
</p>
<p>in which one creates have not fundamentally changed. Creation has always been 
</p>
<p>inspired and made possible by what already exists, and it continues to be, but the 
</p>
<p>space and time in which the act of creating can be performed by ordinary people 
</p>
<p>has been significantly transformed with the unfolding of an immaterial world in 
</p>
<p>which new possibilities of creation have become increasingly accessible to many.
</p>
<p> As Lawrence Lessig has pointed out, these technological changes have intro-
</p>
<p>duced the &ldquo;potential to expand the reach of this creativity to an extraordinary 
</p>
<p>range of culture and commerce.&rdquo;5 First, new types of goods and products enriching 
</p>
<p>the economy of the immaterial keep emerging, and their importance keep grow-
</p>
<p>ing.6 Second, changes in production due to the fact that digital technologies &ldquo;cre-
</p>
<p>ate and replicate reality much more efficiently than non-digital technology does&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>have affected not only what people can do at their own, individual level, in their 
</p>
<p>private spheres, but also at the level of the economy itself. 7 For instance, what 
</p>
<p>inspires and provides incentives for economic actors tends to change. Because 
</p>
<p>innovations and goods are easier to copy and more difficult to protect, providing 
</p>
<p>services often becomes more economically rewarding than selling physical prod-
</p>
<p>ucts. The economy of immaterial goods develops according to specific ways and 
</p>
<p>via specific means that in return bear the potential to transform the functioning of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>60
</p>
<p>the economy as a whole. As Yann Moulier Boutang explains in an interview in this  
</p>
<p>volume, digital technologies, owing to their dramatically reduced production and 
</p>
<p>distribution costs, offer opportunities to revise the sharing of those costs in many 
</p>
<p>different sectors.8 In the book-publishing industry, for instance, such changes 
</p>
<p>could benefit the creator&rsquo;s ability to work by allowing us to revise the way in which 
</p>
<p>they are paid and thus improve greatly a manner of compensation that is largely 
</p>
<p>inadequate for many of them in the current intellectual property system. Creators 
</p>
<p>in general can also benefit from easier access to the works of others that facilitates 
</p>
<p>potentially new forms of work and cooperation that favor research and creativity. 
</p>
<p>Entire industries and economic activities, not only those specialized in immaterial 
</p>
<p>goods, changed with the integration of digital tools and began to transform even 
</p>
<p>more substantially with the move toward the concept of open innovation and net-
</p>
<p>work-based peer production.9 Some companies have invited consumers into the 
</p>
<p>innovation process&mdash;in some cases even through challenges directly posted on the 
</p>
<p>Internet to encourage people to come up with new ideas and to share them.10 They 
</p>
<p>have used consumers as a source of inspiration for new products or designs that 
</p>
<p>could attract and interest new customers and create new markets. In recent years, 
</p>
<p>groups such as IBM, Proctor and Gamble, Lego, and Unilever have adopted such 
</p>
<p>strategies to develop new products. These new ways of doing business have called 
</p>
<p>for important transformations in traditional business models, company cultures, 
</p>
<p>and management strategies. For instance, innovative strategies may shift the 
</p>
<p>focus of many companies from keeping formulas, recipes, or components secret 
</p>
<p>to extracting the value of ideas, increasing the speed at which products can be 
</p>
<p>brought to market, reducing the cost of research and development, and improving 
</p>
<p>the fit between their products and consumers&rsquo; desires or modes of consumption.11
</p>
<p> However, despite the real or potential changes that information technologies 
</p>
<p>have introduced and the substantial new prospects they have opened up in the 
</p>
<p>economy, widespread transformations of corporate practices still remain rare. 
</p>
<p>Even companies that have incorporated a certain amount of open innovation have 
</p>
<p>mostly remained intent on maintaining control of ideas as soon as they are gener-
</p>
<p>ated. New modes of creation and consumption have emerged, but the immaterial 
</p>
<p>has become essentially and only a new field in which capitalist logic can operate, 
</p>
<p>and the principles on which capitalism is based have remained unchanged.
</p>
<p> However, insofar as the interaction allowed by digital technologies offers 
</p>
<p>opportunities for intense exchanges and production, as well as for new ways of 
</p>
<p>commodifying goods and services, the transformation of the knowledge economy 
</p>
<p>has certainly affected capitalist ways of functioning. Industrial capitalism now 
</p>
<p>coexists with a new form of capitalism, called by some &ldquo;cognitive capitalism,&rdquo; or 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;knowledge capitalism,&rdquo; that is both a new type of accumulation (of intellectual 
</p>
<p>krikorian</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>61
</p>
<p>capital) and a new mode of capitalist production.12 It corresponds to the develop-
</p>
<p>ment of an economy based on the distribution of knowledge goods in which the 
</p>
<p>production of knowledge is the central element in the valorization of capital.13
</p>
<p> Changes in the means by which capital is produced and accumulated have 
</p>
<p>brought about changes in the position that social groups occupy in relation to the 
</p>
<p>rules of production. In knowledge capitalism, the laboring class no longer holds a 
</p>
<p>central role, and capital is produced mainly by a new class composed of techno-
</p>
<p>crats and people working predominantly for the service sector. This development 
</p>
<p>contributes to the disruption of the preexisting social order as new tensions and 
</p>
<p>power relations between social groups began to arise. With knowledge capital-
</p>
<p>ism comes a reconfiguration of class interests and of the relations between classes 
</p>
<p>and thus a reconfiguration of what defines them. As we will discuss later, in this 
</p>
<p>context and under the rules of intellectual property protection that regulate the 
</p>
<p>production as well as the use of goods, it is the issue of access that draws new 
</p>
<p>dividing lines between people and groups, dividing lines that are superimposed on  
</p>
<p>former divisions.
</p>
<p> Some people have the means to exist and to thrive in the digital world, while 
</p>
<p>others do not. What is necessary for participation in the immaterial world is not 
</p>
<p>only a computer, the right software, and an Internet connection, which already 
</p>
<p>excludes a large portion of the world population, but also the codes and filters 
</p>
<p>normally acquired through education. These are indispensable for navigating this 
</p>
<p>environment, because only they enable participants to locate and to make use of 
</p>
<p>the resources available in ever-expanding proliferation and to take an active role in 
</p>
<p>the production thereof.14 But the education necessary for the acquisition of such 
</p>
<p>codes and filters remains a near monopoly of the privileged classes. At the same 
</p>
<p>time, with the unfolding of the knowledge-based economy, the strengthening of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protections, and the central place that the market occupies in 
</p>
<p>the neoliberal context, potential inequalities in access increase: Knowledge appro-
</p>
<p>priation plays an increasingly important role in the economy and in peoples&rsquo; lives 
</p>
<p>in general, but is also more than ever subject to market rules. Individuals with no 
</p>
<p>economic and/or cultural capital generally cannot compete on an equal footing 
</p>
<p>with others, and their access to knowledge is easily compromised. Thus, inequali-
</p>
<p>ties in access to knowledge reinforce and perpetuate social and class inequalities, 
</p>
<p>while the current knowledge economy and the intellectual property regime over-
</p>
<p>lay an old class structure with new tensions.
</p>
<p> As in every capitalist model, in knowledge capitalism, the issue of the transfer 
</p>
<p>of property is a key issue. One of the most salient characteristics of knowledge 
</p>
<p>goods is their electronic transferability. Consequently, in the field of knowledge  
</p>
<p>capitalism, to ensure ownership and control of knowledge goods and thus 
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>62
</p>
<p>benefit from the profit derived from their production and subsequent commercial 
</p>
<p>exchange, one must find ways to prevent or slow down a transmission made so 
</p>
<p>simple and easy by digital networks.15
</p>
<p> This is where intellectual property rights come into play. One might think that 
</p>
<p>it is the same old game, appropriating the means of production, only taking place 
</p>
<p>in a new environment. And to some extent, it is. Some argue that this is one of the 
</p>
<p>problems with the term &ldquo;intellectual property;&rdquo; that is, the fact that it determines 
</p>
<p>the granting of legal rights through the establishment of property, what James 
</p>
<p>Boyle describes as the &ldquo;second enclosure movement.&rdquo;16 Historically, at the time 
</p>
<p>of the first property enclosures, land ownership was at stake. To enforce it, apart 
</p>
<p>from the use of legal acts, walls and barriers were used to delineate the property. 
</p>
<p>In the knowledge-based economy, intellectual property rights holders, through 
</p>
<p>their efforts to establish property rights over knowledge, are building other kinds 
</p>
<p>of walls to channel access and to regulate who can benefit from what is produced 
</p>
<p>in the immaterial realm. Though not as visibly obvious as physical walls erected 
</p>
<p>throughout the world, in the era of globalization, they are just as determinative in 
</p>
<p>the establishment of national and international social orders.17
</p>
<p> This enclosure effort is all the more evident as enforcement and repression 
</p>
<p>become increasingly important pieces of the intellectual property right owners&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>agendas. The purpose of intellectual property walls is not to demarcate space, to 
</p>
<p>differentiate an inside and an outside, each having different characteristics and 
</p>
<p>status, but they are far from serving a merely symbolic function. When, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, the Chinese government sends tapes showing police raids and the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of unauthorized copies of DVDs to the U.S. trade representative, this theat-
</p>
<p>ricalization of police efforts is both a performative action intended to prove the 
</p>
<p>goodwill of the Chinese government to its U.S. counterpart and a publicly dem-
</p>
<p>onstrated materialization of the existence of intellectual property rights and of 
</p>
<p>the consequences that the act of trespassing in the immaterial world can generate. 
</p>
<p>Such performances&mdash;from raids in Moroccan souks to the arrest of teenagers and 
</p>
<p>other Internet users in Hong Kong, France, the United Kingdom, and the United 
</p>
<p>States&mdash;are becoming more numerous and increasingly visible in public space.18
</p>
<p> However intellectual property walls do not always efficiently prevent access. 
</p>
<p>If people are determined to find breaches, they often can. But in doing so, they 
</p>
<p>will knowingly commit an illegal act and thereby run the risk of sanctions. In our 
</p>
<p>societies, most of those who commit an illegal act to access a territory or a good 
</p>
<p>are those who do not have the means to play by the rules or those who consider 
</p>
<p>they have little to lose in comparison with what they hope to gain. Those with 
</p>
<p>the resources and capital, on the other hand, are rarely refused access to a terri-
</p>
<p>tory or a good. As a result, walls work not so much as real barriers, but as socially 
</p>
<p>krikorian</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>63
</p>
<p>polarized filters. They selectively hinder certain people and filter societies as they 
</p>
<p>regulate access to information and knowledge&mdash;a mechanism that inevitably 
</p>
<p>makes the issue of access political.
</p>
<p> The second most salient characteristic of knowledge goods is what economists 
</p>
<p>call their &ldquo;nonrival&rdquo; and &ldquo;nonexcludable&rdquo; nature. Nonrival goods are goods whose 
</p>
<p>consumption by one person does not prevent its consumption by another. This 
</p>
<p>book is a nonrival good: After you have read it, another still can. On-line, even 
</p>
<p>while you read it, another can. Nonexcludable goods are goods whose consump-
</p>
<p>tion can&rsquo;t be prevented once they have become publicly available. Architecture, 
</p>
<p>such as the Cathedral of Notre Dame, is a nonexcludable good: Anybody who can 
</p>
<p>appreciate it can do so for free. Because these goods can be used by multiple indi-
</p>
<p>viduals simultaneously, it is harder, sometimes impossible, to expropriate them. 
</p>
<p>Both attributes operate as constraints on capitalist exchanges and make rights 
</p>
<p>holders fearful that the technology of digital copying will render their legal rights 
</p>
<p>and sources of profit ineffective. The advent of digital technologies and the popu-
</p>
<p>larization of the Internet brought the prospect of huge financial benefits, but at 
</p>
<p>the same time, uncontrolled consumption and production, which is materially lim-
</p>
<p>ited in the physical world, also took on new proportions, given that the spaces in 
</p>
<p>which these take place are numerous and ubiquitous and that the cost of enforce-
</p>
<p>ment is high. Who or what entity could indeed possibly observe everything tak-
</p>
<p>ing place in every potential offender&rsquo;s living room or bedroom or monitor every 
</p>
<p>Saturday-night party in every small town in every country?19
</p>
<p> Consequently, a race began between the &ldquo;cops and the robbers.&rdquo; As Yann Moulier 
</p>
<p>Boutang describes it, &ldquo;the cops never get a head start. There is a delay, and their 
</p>
<p>route is full of pitfalls.&rdquo;20 The enforcers have acquired new ways to locate the infring-
</p>
<p>ers, but the technical possibilities have intensified their interactions and exchanges. 
</p>
<p>What makes the Internet a public space&mdash;a space that if not all individuals, at least 
</p>
<p>many can access and inhabit and where freedom can appear&mdash;also makes it a space 
</p>
<p>difficult to control.21 But along with the freedom that the Internet provides to users, 
</p>
<p>it also gave rights holders a cheaper way to watch individual activities on a global 
</p>
<p>scale and to monitor and locate infringements, if not when people are enjoying the 
</p>
<p>use of illegally acquired material, then when they are merely acquiring it. As such, 
</p>
<p>as Cory Doctorow notes, the Internet and the personal computer represent &ldquo;a perfect 
</p>
<p>storm for bringing ordinary peoples&rsquo; ordinary activity into the realm of copyright.&rdquo;22 
</p>
<p>If activities that infringe intellectual property rights cannot be eradicated, they can 
</p>
<p>be criminalized. And if the act in itself cannot be prevented, social condemnation 
</p>
<p>can affect people&rsquo;s behavior, repression leading to suppression.
</p>
<p> One consequence of such condemnations is to marginalize appropriative 
</p>
<p>and sharing practices and to make them disappear from public spaces. As Lessig

<p>observes, if &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t stop our kids from using these tools to create, or make 
</p>
<p>them passive,&rdquo; we can &ldquo;drive it underground, or make them &lsquo;pirates.&rsquo;&rdquo; Examining 
</p>
<p>developments in the field of copyright, he adds: &ldquo;We are in the middle of . . . what 
</p>
<p>some call &lsquo;the copyright wars.&rsquo;&rdquo;23 If there is war over copyrights, we should ask 
</p>
<p>ourselves who the fighting camps are. On one side stand the owners of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights. They are rather easy to identify: They sponsor laws in public 
</p>
<p>forums and pay for advertisements on TV; they promote a moral position as well 
</p>
<p>as an understanding of economics for the public to adopt; they argue that their 
</p>
<p>camp is the righteous side of the debate, the side of struggling artists who need 
</p>
<p>to be protected from dishonest plagiarists, of quality magazines endangered by 
</p>
<p>blogs and free publications. Who are their enemies? Many different profiles fit 
</p>
<p>into this category, including kids &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; songs or movies with their computers, 
</p>
<p>unknown artists copying and transforming very well-known ones, and individuals 
</p>
<p>using peer-to-peer platforms to share files and software.
</p>
<p> A wide range of individuals thus started to be targeted as &ldquo;pirates&rdquo; for the 
</p>
<p>improper use, sharing, and production of materials using copyrighted matter, and 
</p>
<p>the more copyrights expand, the more favorable are the conditions of the produc-
</p>
<p>tion of &ldquo;pirates.&rdquo; They easily fit into a political environment that is predominant 
</p>
<p>in many Western countries in which security and repression had become routine. 
</p>
<p>Increasingly, public, social, and legal resources have been encouraged to be or actu-
</p>
<p>ally have been mobilized in an effort to enforce intellectual property protections 
</p>
<p>and to limit exchanges of protected material, resources that often seem particularly 
</p>
<p>unreasonable to deploy in many developing countries when one compares them 
</p>
<p>with the national budget of such countries and when one considers essential, but 
</p>
<p>unmet local needs. Meanwhile, the motors of innovation and creativity are jeopar-
</p>
<p>dized by an ever more restrictive judicial and legal environment&mdash;despite the fact 
</p>
<p>that this, by definition, is contradictory to capitalist interests, which rest on the 
</p>
<p>continuous delivery and marketing of new products to generate accumulation.24
</p>
<p> Various tensions and conflicts about the effects of and the justifications for 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights have emerged and crystallized in the past decade. They 
</p>
<p>have taken the form of negotiations and contentious relations between states 
</p>
<p>within international organizations such WIPO, the WTO, the World Health Orga-
</p>
<p>nization (WHO), and UNESCO, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Orga-
</p>
<p>nization. They emerged noticeably in an election context recently with the consti-
</p>
<p>tution and election to the European Parliament of a Swedish pirate party.25 They 
</p>
<p>have resulted in lawsuits brought by people with AIDS against pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>companies or the conviction of farmers who have campaigned against genetically 
</p>
<p>modified organisms. And they have inspired demonstrations and lobbying cam-
</p>
<p>paigns for access to medicines, against software patents, against biopiracy, and for 
</p>

</p>
<p>the mobilization of students, librarians, and researchers. They have provoked the 
</p>
<p>organization of university meetings for open sources, for open publishing, and for 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge. They have triggered conflicts between major corporations, 
</p>
<p>lawsuits between competitors, and debates in many parliaments, senates, and con-
</p>
<p>gresses. Each of these contentions can be seen as expressions and elements of the 
</p>
<p>formation of access to knowledge as a field of activism.
</p>
<p> These mobilizations and the common framing of their claims manifest a will-
</p>
<p>ingness to give the issue of access a central position in the contestation of funda-
</p>
<p>mental political and social issues today. As the A2K movement seeks to promote 
</p>
<p>the visibility of challenges to access and uses the issue of access to structure its 
</p>
<p>discourse, it encompasses social and political contests specific to the inequalities 
</p>
<p>created by the rules governing the appropriation of value and property under the 
</p>
<p>current regime of neoliberal capitalism. As such, as we will see later, A2K can be 
</p>
<p>seen as the development of a response to continued efforts to extend intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights, efforts that themselves can be seen as both a political and a  
</p>
<p>social mobilization.
</p>
<p>political context and political practices:  
from intellectual property to access to knowledge
</p>
<p>To understand how the interests of intellectual property rights owners became 
</p>
<p>state policy, we need to look more closely at the way those advocating increased 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protections have been organized and mobilized, because their 
</p>
<p>strategy rests as much on their harnessing of an ideological/political context and 
</p>
<p>their manufacturing of conceptual tools as on the details of the ways in which they 
</p>
<p>have organized their mobilization.
</p>
<p> The fact that the market is in the foreground of most contemporary political 
</p>
<p>theories, or more exactly, that no other views than those putting it in the fore-
</p>
<p>ground could establish themselves successfully in the past forty years, illustrates 
</p>
<p>the spread of neoliberal rationality, which &ldquo;extend[ed] and disseminat[ed] mar-
</p>
<p>ket values to all institutions and social actions&rdquo; across the globe. Far from being 
</p>
<p>only an economic doctrine, this ensemble of political practices and institutions has 
</p>
<p>enveloped the state, which has incorporated its economic logic and redefined itself 
</p>
<p>according to the search for profitability, progressively linking its legitimacy to its 
</p>
<p>capacity to sustain and fuel the market. The market, while remaining a &ldquo;distinctive 
</p>
<p>player,&rdquo; has become the organizational principle that is applied to the state, as well 
</p>
<p>as to individuals and society.26
</p>
<p> Contrary to the assumption that associates neoliberalism with a weak and 
</p>
<p>quasi-absent state, in this regime, the state, while it must be kept subject to the 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>66
</p>
<p>logic of the market, has a key role to play to guarantee that the market operates 
</p>
<p>properly: It needs to provide laws, regulations, and institutions that establish opti-
</p>
<p>mal conditions for its development.27 Thus, far from being noninterventionist, the 
</p>
<p>state actively participates in an array of domains through policy arbitration, dis-
</p>
<p>mantling welfare programs, and deregulating entire sections of socioeconomic life 
</p>
<p>while controlling, encouraging, or criminalizing social activities and behaviors.
</p>
<p> In this context, those representing the state and those representing private 
</p>
<p>interests have started to act as partners. This rapprochement has been facilitated 
</p>
<p>by the phenomenon of the &ldquo;revolving door,&rdquo; according to which the members of 
</p>
<p>the dominant classes, including many who have been advocates for the establish-
</p>
<p>ment of neoliberalism, hold positions, often in tandem or succession, in both pub-
</p>
<p>lic and private institutions.
</p>
<p> The action of advocates for an increase in intellectual property protection bene-
</p>
<p>fited, both literally and symbolically, from neoliberalism&rsquo;s successful establishment 
</p>
<p>at the end of the 1970s and 80s as the dominant political system internationally. 
</p>
<p>Neoliberal rationality indeed constitutes a favorable environment for strengthen-
</p>
<p>ing intellectual property rights. On the one hand, neoliberalism promotes individ-
</p>
<p>ual entrepreneurship and private property, while on the other, it encourages free 
</p>
<p>trade and the multiplication of agreements that have proven to be a key vehicle for 
</p>
<p>the expansion of intellectual property restrictions across the world.
</p>
<p> Of course, the maximization of intellectual property rights can also be seen 
</p>
<p>as paradoxical, if not contradictory, with regard to the neoliberal doctrines, since 
</p>
<p>these, in theory at least, promote competition and do not encourage institutional-
</p>
<p>ized monopolies. But such is the beauty and the efficiency of neoliberal rationality 
</p>
<p>that it is malleable enough to allow it to incorporate paradoxes without losing its 
</p>
<p>apparent cohesion and strength. Thus, the state, while lauding free-market theory 
</p>
<p>and spreading it both in discourses and through international agreements, in effect 
</p>
<p>undermines it, allowing monopolies and limiting competition in order to ensure 
</p>
<p>and expand the rights of intellectual property owners.28
</p>
<p> Besides providing intellectual property rights owners with a practical vehicle 
</p>
<p>for the realization of their agendas, neoliberalism has also has helped them estab-
</p>
<p>lish their sociocultural position and direct their political actions. Ideologies are a 
</p>
<p>powerful instrument in the production of legitimacy, and the laissez-faire ideol-
</p>
<p>ogy of classic economic liberalism has provided neoliberalism with the benefits 
</p>
<p>of legitimacy and historical weight. Although those who advocate for increased 
</p>
<p>intellectual property restrictions generally publicly condemn what they call &ldquo;ide-
</p>
<p>ology,&rdquo; which they usually associate with left-leaning political utopias, Commu-
</p>
<p>nism, socialism and other such &ldquo;evils,&rdquo; the ideological domination of neoliberal-
</p>

<p>67
</p>
<p>alternative and as having coincided with Francis Fukuyama&rsquo;s &ldquo;end of history,&rdquo; has 
</p>
<p>proven largely instrumental to the successes of the movement to increase intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property protections and the lack of questioning of the vision that it pro-
</p>
<p>motes. At the same time, the contributions of intellectual property advocates to 
</p>
<p>the neoliberal revolution through the success with which they have promoted their 
</p>
<p>own goals has helped power the rise of this broader political movement.
</p>
<p> But if the strategy of intellectual property rights owners has benefitted from 
</p>
<p>their harnessing of an ideological/political context, it also has rested on the way 
</p>
<p>they have manufactured conceptual tools and organized their mobilization. At first 
</p>
<p>blush, it may seem like a misconception to treat advocacy for intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights as an organized social movement. After all, those who advocate for 
</p>
<p>increased restrictions on intellectual property rights tend to belong to the domi-
</p>
<p>nant class, and what is usually considered as an alliance consisting of a group of 
</p>
<p>property owners, a network of industries, or a cartel of multinationals has a priori 
</p>
<p>no need for mass mobilization and the confrontational tactics that most organized 
</p>
<p>social movements rely on in order to persuade states to act in their interests.
</p>
<p> However, it worth noting that, like other social mobilizations, intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty right owners do not employ the traditional political means of representative 
</p>
<p>politics to further their agenda. Of course, they soon succeeded in making the 
</p>
<p>state a partner in realizing that agenda, rather than a source of opposition to it, 
</p>
<p>and while confrontations between intellectual property interests and the state do 
</p>
<p>occur, for instance when intellectual property advocates lobby and even threaten 
</p>
<p>governments, these confrontations take a very different form from those expected 
</p>
<p>from typical social movements. Nevertheless, a number of features central to the 
</p>
<p>concept of a contemporary social movement do seem to describe the mobilization 
</p>
<p>for increased intellectual property protection.
</p>
<p> A social movement is a product of its time and reflects actions and reactions to 
</p>
<p>a particular political and economic condition, or what some social scientists refer 
</p>
<p>to as a political opportunity structure. The emergence of the movement in favor of 
</p>
<p>increased protection of intellectual property rights, taken as such, offers insights 
</p>
<p>into evolution of the information society and into the constraints and opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties that such an evolution has presented to intellectual property owners as the 
</p>
<p>basis for their mobilization.
</p>
<p> Strategically, as is the case in numerous social movements, success has rested 
</p>
<p>on building a common identity that goes beyond the interests of one group and 
</p>
<p>on mobilizing collective action that encompasses a range of tactics that goes well 
</p>
<p>beyond merely lobbying those who govern.29 Using an emphasis on the concept 
</p>
<p>of property as the basis of this shared identity, promoters of increased intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property protection successfully incorporated the project of a handful of 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>68
</p>
<p>corporate executives into international trade negotiations, U.S. government pol-
</p>
<p>icy, and even international trade rules.30 An initiative launched by a specific seg-
</p>
<p>ment of society, but couched in terms of social progress (that is, of increased social 
</p>
<p>welfare and development) thus successfully achieved changes in basic social and  
</p>
<p>political norms.
</p>
<p> The A2K mobilization integrates and responds to the specific ways of doing 
</p>
<p>politics that the movement for greater intellectual property protections has used. 
</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly inevitable, because A2K advocates are engaged in discuss-
</p>
<p>ing and criticizing the effects of intellectual property rights, and consequently, 
</p>
<p>they incorporate the legal language that articulates those rights and engage with 
</p>
<p>the institutional frame that produces them.31 Participants in the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>are keen to monitor their counterparts&rsquo; moves, and they take inspiration from the 
</p>
<p>manner in which the movement for intellectual property restrictions has success-
</p>
<p>fully incorporated its agenda into the state&rsquo;s agenda. Consequently, they regu-
</p>
<p>larly employ the technical and legal language of the various institutional contexts 
</p>
<p>where they try to counterbalance the effect of their opponents or where they try 
</p>
<p>to intervene before their opponents do so, whether at the WHO, WTO, or WIPO, 
</p>
<p>during the negotiations of bilateral trade agreements, during negotiations over the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Millennium Development Goals, or in negotiations over national 
</p>
<p>regulations and laws. Furthermore, A2K advocates of necessity employ the domi-
</p>
<p>nant economic logic when they seek to promote a balance between public and pri-
</p>
<p>vate rights based on criticisms of the way the market functions, for example, or 
</p>
<p>when discussing the need for competition, the effect of monopolies, or the exclu-
</p>
<p>sive impact of prices. The two opposing movements can thus be seen as adverse 
</p>
<p>forces at one moment in history, which also implies that they to some extent share 
</p>
<p>a common culture and experience.
</p>
<p> Both movements likewise participate in and exploit the effects of globaliza-
</p>
<p>tion. Globalization in the neoliberal context both results from and in turn pro-
</p>
<p>vokes transformations of the existing power structure and the practices of power. 
</p>
<p>Internalizing the context of globalization, both movements elaborate their actions 
</p>
<p>inside and outside national borders. Both contribute to the ways that politicization 
</p>
<p>occurs outside the framework of representative politics and to what results from 
</p>
<p>it. Both compete to influence the state&rsquo;s performance and what its role should be. 
</p>
<p>As much as neoliberalism rests on state intervention and control to strengthen and 
</p>
<p>facilitate market logic, claims for an open and protected public domain hold the 
</p>
<p>necessity of an active power structure that bears responsibilities for public inter-
</p>
<p>ests and that enforces rules.32
</p>
<p> All of these factors affect the movement for access to knowledge as a field of 
</p>
<p>activism, determining its concrete strategies and tactics. For many A2K advocates, 
</p>
<p>krikorian</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>69
</p>
<p>opposing intellectual property extremism in public debates and concretely estab-
</p>
<p>lishing optimal conditions for the creation of new things and for socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>prosperity requires reviving awareness of the social value of spaces where all peo-
</p>
<p>ple can share and make use of knowledge produced there and of the need to secure 
</p>
<p>such spaces.33 This process involves questioning the arbitration performed by those 
</p>
<p>who govern and who mediate between the public and private spheres and between 
</p>
<p>public and private interests. Facing the alliance between the state and multinational 
</p>
<p>corporations, A2K advocates are confronted with a particular power structure and 
</p>
<p>the form of governance established thereby. In this context, the issue to debate is 
</p>
<p>not so much the intrinsic capacity of the state to control resources or whether the 
</p>
<p>state or the market works better at doing so, largely because these two entities 
</p>
<p>are no longer in opposition with one another. Rather, the discussion concerns the 
</p>
<p>objectives that the state pursues, its priorities, and the ways it operates within neo-
</p>
<p>liberal rationality, all of which call for A2K advocates to develop a critical under-
</p>
<p>standing of the role of neoliberalism in the development of the global intellectual 
</p>
<p>property regime. More broadly, A2K advocates interrogate not only the role and 
</p>
<p>place given to the governing powers, but also the role and place given to the indi-
</p>
<p>vidual and the relation between the two of them, as well as the relations between 
</p>
<p>individuals themselves.34 They thus address fundamental and age-old issues 
</p>
<p>regarding the governing of societies, as well as current transformations of power 
</p>
<p>and the legitimate expectations that individuals can experience as a consequence.
</p>
<p>what is a2k?
</p>
<p>In 2004, the term &ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo; emerged as a common umbrella under 
</p>
<p>which individuals and organizations could denounce inequalities and injustices 
</p>
<p>related to intellectual property. But it remains a fair question to ask whether 
</p>
<p>this gathering is more than the pooling of problems and demands, more than a 
</p>
<p>juxtaposition of identities that have provisionally focused their energies on a  
</p>
<p>common hindrance.
</p>
<p> A consideration of the trajectory followed in terms of commitment by the indi-
</p>
<p>viduals who today take part in A2K mobilizations provides a useful understanding 
</p>
<p>of the emergence of the phenomenon. Some describe their participation as a logical 
</p>
<p>evolution of their involvement in other political issues. Indeed, many A2K advo-
</p>
<p>cates have been or are currently active on other fronts. Analyzing the mechanisms 
</p>
<p>at the heart of the problems they focused on is often what led them, at the end of 
</p>
<p>the day, to describe those problems in terms of inequalities in access to knowledge, 
</p>
<p>giving rise to the recognition of an underlying cause and the formulation of a com-
</p>
<p>mon framework around which others could be rallied. In a typical example of this 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>70
</p>
<p>process, one activist may have joined mobilizations to end discrimination against 
</p>
<p>HIV-positive people. This initial effort may logically have turned into a campaign 
</p>
<p>for access to drugs in developing countries. And such a campaign might, as a mat-
</p>
<p>ter of course, lead him or her to denounce the negative effects of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty protections, which bar access to such medicines. As the activist intensified his 
</p>
<p>or her critique of the dampening effect such protections have on the generation of 
</p>
<p>medical innovation, key critiques surrounding access-to-knowledge issues would 
</p>
<p>begin to be formulated. The activist would soon find that, perhaps even almost 
</p>
<p>unwittingly, he or she had joined the A2K mobilization.
</p>
<p> A2K does not look like a mass movement. It does not rely on massive street 
</p>
<p>demonstrations as a constitutive means to confront the power structures that it 
</p>
<p>challenges. Perhaps a more massive form of mobilization and a more cut-and-dried 
</p>
<p>political stand would do a better job of advancing the purposes of A2K. Or perhaps 
</p>
<p>the A2K movement could better serve itself by drawing on what it already pos-
</p>
<p>sesses, which is a composite form of mobilization that provides the potential to 
</p>
<p>cement together a multitude of actions.
</p>
<p> As in a Venn diagram, movements fit into one another and overlap, each one 
</p>
<p>bringing its own obsessions, tactics, networks, and savoir-faire. A2K can be seen 
</p>
<p>as a movement of movements, resting on the capacity of its participants to hear 
</p>
<p>and share their various messages or, more specifically, the common denominators 
</p>
<p>within their messages, without allowing their differences to develop into obstacles. 
</p>
<p>The A2K umbrella is large enough to allow for an intense variety of participants, 
</p>
<p>issues, and actions, as well as to allow creativity to express itself through vari-
</p>
<p>ous modes without being limited by the hierarchical structures that often hamper 
</p>
<p>conventional organizations. This is not unlike the form of political activity wit-
</p>
<p>nessed throughout the course of Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaign: a general 
</p>
<p>rhetoric not only coexisted with, but was actually energized and shaped in the 
</p>
<p>eyes of the public (or in the eyes of enemies) by a variety of actions from indi-
</p>
<p>viduals and networks stepping forward from multiple places. The very qualities 
</p>
<p>that gave this movement its blurry outlines also enhanced its force by enlarging 
</p>
<p>its federative power. Within the A2K movement, individuals bring whatever they 
</p>
<p>have to the table, be it their handicaps or their positions of privilege, and draw 
</p>
<p>upon them as resources for collective action in order to formulate political ques-
</p>
<p>tions. When an HIV-positive person asks for access to life-saving medication or a 
</p>
<p>visually impaired person asks for access to educational material, their point cannot 
</p>
<p>be easily dismissed publicly or ignored by political leaders. Meanwhile, when an 
</p>
<p>academic from a prominent U.S. university presents an analysis of knowledge gaps 
</p>
<p>or business models, his opinion is likely to be heeded and to be echoed in political 
</p>
<p>spheres and media circles.

</p>
<p> Although each element within the collective may have its priorities or its par-
</p>
<p>ticular raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre, the movement as a whole does not impose a hierarchy of mat-
</p>
<p>ters of concern. It sustains a plurality of claims and actions without undermining 
</p>
<p>the particularities or the autonomy of individual groups or national coalitions. A 
</p>
<p>campaign for the local production of generic drugs in Brazil or South Korea takes 
</p>
<p>place simultaneously alongside a movement at WIPO for access to reading mate-
</p>
<p>rial for visually impaired persons. At the same time, an international mobiliza-
</p>
<p>tion takes place to defend a professor of philosophy taken to court in Argentina 
</p>
<p>for putting Spanish translation of texts by Jacques Derrida on the Internet, and a 
</p>
<p>backlash is organized against the European Commission for allowing its customs 
</p>

</p>
<p> At some levels, a dampening out of particularities, singularities, and diverse 
</p>
<p>priorities or choices normally occurs in favor of the vision of those within a move-
</p>
<p>ment who enjoy certain advantages, whether by speaking a dominant language, 
</p>
<p>having a higher level of education, associating with upper-class social networks, 
</p>
<p>or possessing greater financial resources. But although the consequences of 
</p>
<p>such power relations are by no means absent within the A2K, so far, this has not 
</p>
<p>seemed to affect the apparent cohesion of the movement.35
</p>
<p> So far, the A2K model of activism allows for such heterogeneity without sac-
</p>
<p>rificing the capacity to function as a common entity advancing a common cause. 
</p>
<p>Each protagonist may be focused on one particular issue or may be involved in 
</p>
<p>several different fights at the same time. However, as a member of the A2K mobi-
</p>
<p>lization, he or she agrees to represent a collective identity&mdash;whether it is in a very 
</p>
<p>active or less committed way&mdash;thus becoming part of an entity that transcends 
</p>
<p>the elements that constitute it, a movement that contributes to the emergence of a 
</p>
<p>common imaginary.
</p>
<p> Intellectual property rights affect and encompass a variety of issues that are 
</p>
<p>diverse and separate in nature. Paradoxically, the reification of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights as one coherent concept that embraces copyrights, patents, and trade-
</p>
<p>marks has enabled the emergence of an extremely diverse A2K front. Opposi-
</p>
<p>tion to institutions with so wide a footprint as the WTO or to policies with such 
</p>
<p>far-reaching effects as the TRIPS Agreement or free-trade agreements favors 
</p>
<p>the coalescence of groups or movements originally focused on specific and dis-
</p>
<p>crete concerns because such groups oppose entities that structure intercon-
</p>
<p>nections between domains. Each A2K actor not only addresses a specific effect 
</p>
<p>of the strengthening of intellectual property rights, but, as a member of a col-
</p>
<p>lective, embraces multiple issues, becoming sensitive to the echo and similarities 
</p>
<p>between their causes and taking into consideration the broader logic and structure 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72
</p>
<p>manifested in the specific legal provisions they oppose. The nature of the enemy 
</p>
<p>determines the organization of the resistance mobilized against it, forcing it to 
</p>
<p>become more systemic. In order to make the best of collective action, A2K advo-
</p>
<p>cates therefore cannot limit themselves to a juxtaposition of diverse demands or 
</p>
<p>criticisms, but must instead develop an integrated common agenda, or at least try 
</p>
<p>to do so. If this is not yet where the A2K movement is, it is definitively a trend 
</p>
<p>along which it tends to evolve. A2K advocates are pushed to formulate a global 
</p>
<p>vision for society, rather than simply denounce legal dispositions or policies, and 
</p>
<p>the time frame in which they plan their actions to serve longer-term objectives 
</p>
<p>expands accordingly.
</p>
<p> This dynamic usually carries benefits for movements: an increased presence 
</p>
<p>in forums and political spaces, the capitalization of resources, networks, and the 
</p>
<p>benefits from specific actions, the ability to move back and forth between the 
</p>
<p>grassroots and the political spheres, and so on. At the same time, the trend toward 
</p>
<p>integration and consolidation can weigh down an organization and raise problems 
</p>
<p>within it, disrupting the specific culture of action that characterizes it, potentially 
</p>
<p>blurring their initial objectives, and creating internal tensions. Contesting the spe-
</p>
<p>cific effects of the intellectual property system without abandoning larger A2K 
</p>
<p>claims in terms of creativity, innovation, and access certainly has the potential to 
</p>
<p>take activists further than they first decided to go, to get them involved in politics 
</p>
<p>in a more totalizing way than they intended when they first demanded a right or 
</p>
<p>denounced what they identified as an injustice.
</p>
<p> By identifying themselves as A2K constituencies, individuals and groups show 
</p>
<p>an interest in defining themselves and in being perceived not simply as contradic-
</p>
<p>tors or opponents of the intellectual property system, but as promoters of a posi-
</p>
<p>tive and cohesive agenda&mdash;something bigger than mere opposition.36 Though they 
</p>
<p>were originally brought together by objections to a common enemy,37 a conscious 
</p>
<p>strategic move was made by many A2K advocates for the purpose of allowing 
</p>
<p>them to reframe the issues outside of the logic of the intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>system. Whether they invoke notions of the public domain or knowledge goods 
</p>
<p>and knowledge spaces as commons, A2K actors are trying to formulate a debate 
</p>
<p>outside of the dialectic of opposition, in a discursive space in which they can set 
</p>
<p>at least part of the terms and in which intellectual property represents only one 
</p>
<p>among several options.38
</p>
<p> Not only does A2K not look like a mass movement, but many of its advocates 
</p>
<p>are not very radical, and, as a whole, the movement is rather utilitarian. Finally, 
</p>
<p>A2K is not as confrontational as many other social mobilizations. Most A2K 
</p>
<p>advocates so far seem interested in withdrawing from the dialectal logic of direct 
</p>
<p>power struggles, either with the state or with industry.39 Members of the A2K

<p>73
</p>
<p>constellation are not constituted as activists through a confrontational relation 
</p>
<p>with &ldquo;the&rdquo; public, the way mobilizations of minorities can be, for instance. The aim 
</p>
<p>of people who recognize themselves in the A2K discourse is mostly not to mark 
</p>
<p>themselves off from the general public. They do not wish to materialize &ldquo;subaltern 
</p>
<p>counterpublics&rdquo; dedicated to the formulation of &ldquo;oppositional interpretations of 
</p>
<p>their identities, interests, and needs,&rdquo; but instead seek to alter the cultural horizon 
</p>
<p>represented by the dominant vision and in doing so transform the main discursive 
</p>
<p>arena and constitute an alternative general public.40
</p>
<p> The A2K movement is not so much based on a claim of the &ldquo;unity&rdquo; of all peo-
</p>
<p>ple and their struggles, but rather on the effort to convince others that they are 
</p>
<p>affected, should be concerned, and should act accordingly.41 A2K constituencies 
</p>
<p>are mobilized against a peculiar enemy, but they are organized in the name of a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;shared&rdquo; interpretation of their interests and needs, which is understood to extend 
</p>
<p>to the interests and needs of the public. Individual particularities (disabilities, 
</p>
<p>privilege, or status) are used by the collective to establish or legitimate its political 
</p>
<p>power, but its dynamic is not based on the affirmation of particularities the way 
</p>
<p>identity politics are. It seeks to increase awareness of the various problems and 
</p>
<p>various needs of specific groups, but it also attempts to have a structural effect on 
</p>
<p>the system as a whole by promoting equality of access. It thus also participates in 
</p>
<p>the articulation of political claims for redistribution and recognition within a poli-
</p>
<p>tics of justice such as the one Nancy Fraser advocates.42
</p>
<p> Herein lies an interesting tension, however. Even as there are minorities among 
</p>
<p>its ranks speaking in the name of their own individual experiences (the visually 
</p>
<p>impaired, AIDS patients, and so on), that is, from their &ldquo;situated knowledge,&rdquo; to 
</p>
<p>use Donna Haraway&rsquo;s formula, the claims that A2K advances (the defense of a 
</p>
<p>public domain or of the commons, for example) are presented as possessing a uni-
</p>
<p>versal range. The A2K movement does not try to construct a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; subject, 
</p>
<p>as &ldquo;unity&rdquo; movements sometimes do, but it does succeed in allowing the transla-
</p>
<p>tion of knowledge between communities and the realization of alliances between 
</p>
<p>multiplicities.43 Without prejudging the A2K movement&rsquo;s success or its future effi-
</p>
<p>cacy, we can observe that, for now, it manages to compose a collective interest that 
</p>
<p>can be seen and presented as universal. Considered in this light, the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment resembles the &ldquo;multitude&rdquo; that Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri describe as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;singularities acting in common,&rdquo; a heterogeneous collective inheriting its inten-
</p>
<p>tionality in the progression from the singular to the common in which the concept 
</p>
<p>of access becomes itself a dispositive of the organization of singularities.44
</p>
<p> The A2K movement presents itself and is being seen as a nongovernmental 
</p>
<p>force. It offers a critique of the standard decision-making processes&mdash;of pressures 
</p>
<p>exerted on legal and executive institutions by the private sector, of the willingness 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>74
</p>
<p>of these institutions to surrender to these pressures&mdash;showing how they exclude, 
</p>
<p>dissimulate, or neglect. But instead of emphasizing a position of exteriority, it 
</p>
<p>incorporates the logic of governments, institutions, and industries and actually 
</p>
<p>even also includes, in a very open way, individuals working for governments, as 
</p>
<p>well as for private multinationals, in hopes of integrating these into something 
</p>
<p>larger that it will have itself contributed to designing. The A2K movement occu-
</p>
<p>pies well-established institutional political spaces such as the WTO or WIPO and, 
</p>
<p>at the same time, also seeks to create new political spaces and to legitimize them 
</p>
<p>by co-opting institutional representatives from traditional political and economic 
</p>
<p>power structures. It contributes to a blurring of the lines between genres through 
</p>
<p>its ubiquitous and rather flexible ways of being and of engaging in debates. At the 
</p>
<p>same time, it demonstrates the clear willingness of its constituencies to acquire 
</p>
<p>a say in debates and to make use of what Hannah Arendt called their &ldquo;power of 
</p>
<p>speech&rdquo; to establish themselves as political actors.45
</p>
<p>governance and resistance seen through the prism of access
</p>
<p>The field of A2K inequalities is a composite: It includes new types of inequalities, 
</p>
<p>significantly increased preexisting inequalities, and those brought to light by the 
</p>
<p>structuring role of the market in knowledge capitalism. A2K targets issues specifi-
</p>
<p>cally posed in the new digital society, but fundamentally, it raises classical prob-
</p>
<p>lems, such as inequalities in the distribution of resources, or social justice. What 
</p>
<p>is novel is the prism used to analyze the problems, as well as the manner in which 
</p>
<p>they are addressed&mdash;the modes of organization of political action that the A2K 
</p>
<p>movement employs.
</p>
<p> As I&rsquo;ve noted, the A2K movement comprises a diversity of references, political 
</p>
<p>traditions, and forms of mobilization. Consequently, the phenomena and actions 
</p>
<p>that A2K activists find intolerable and the reasons that spark their reactions are 
</p>
<p>very diverse. As such, the movement illustrates and fits very well within the larger 
</p>
<p>and more general movement of civil-society actors engaging in nongovernmen-
</p>
<p>tal politics.46 This new conceptual field of political mobilization emerged in rela-
</p>
<p>tion to two different trends in politics. On the one hand, beginning in the early 
</p>
<p>1970s, there was an increasing public demand for government accountability. On 
</p>
<p>the other, attacks led by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan on the welfare 
</p>
<p>state and on anticapitalist institutions such as labor unions and class-based politi-
</p>
<p>cal parties moved people away from traditional representative politics in the 1980s. 
</p>
<p>Like other types of nongovernmental mobilizations, the A2K movement can be 
</p>
<p>seen as the extension of politics &ldquo;beyond the realm of representation&rdquo; in reaction 
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;dysfunctions of the political realm.&rdquo;47 Individuals and groups involved in the

<p>75
</p>
<p>A2K movement share a common concern with the way intellectual property gover-
</p>
<p>nance is exercised and more generally question the way in which they and we are 
</p>
<p>governed.
</p>
<p> Those who hold the reins of the dominant power structure try to convince 
</p>
<p>people and societies that the established rules are made to guarantee equality of 
</p>
<p>opportunity between individuals, as well as to ensure progress and wealth within 
</p>
<p>the society. In the face of these attempts, organized denunciations put forward by 
</p>
<p>social movements expose inequalities, hierarchies, and power relations that then 
</p>
<p>cannot always easily be justified publicly, even if they are rationalized and validated 
</p>
<p>within privileged circles. A2K advocates denounce the divergence between the the-
</p>
<p>oretical promotion of innovation, a value commonly accepted by all and invoked 
</p>
<p>by those who govern to legitimate their policies, and the actual effect of the rules 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property protection. They seek to &ldquo;question the social norms that 
</p>
<p>enable governing bodies to call upon unimpeachable principles in order to justify 
</p>
<p>objectionable policies.&rdquo;48 From the alliance between claims to rights of access and 
</p>
<p>utilitarian criticisms of the intellectual property system thus emerges a movement 
</p>
<p>generating its own particular politics: a politics of access. As such, the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment illustrates an evolution in the culture of mobilization and collective action.
</p>
<p> Using the prism of access, the A2K movement attempts to reveal the disso-
</p>
<p>nances in what James C. Scott calls the &ldquo;public transcript,&rdquo; the &ldquo;open interaction 
</p>
<p>between subordinates and those who dominate,&rdquo; of the dominant powers regard-
</p>
<p>ing matters of equality and democracy. It analyzes the asperities lying beneath 
</p>
<p>supposedly calm political surfaces, thereby rendering possible the perception of 
</p>
<p>injustice, as well as the moral questioning of it.49 Refusing to accept the normaliza-
</p>
<p>tion of restrictions on access, the A2K movement makes needs visible and imposes 
</p>
<p>upon political leaders the duty to meet them. Its existence tends to prove that 
</p>
<p>despite&mdash;or perhaps because of&mdash;the willingness of the dominant powers to see 
</p>
<p>inflexible intellectual property rules adopted and implemented, they fail in their 
</p>
<p>attempt to naturalize social inequities regarding access. On the contrary, the issue 
</p>
<p>of access is particularly useful and efficient as a way to catalyze questioning of the 
</p>
<p>dominant powers and their regimes.
</p>
<p> However, one could argue that the act of voicing criticism and complaints 
</p>
<p>against a situation that is perceived as having been imposed upon individuals by 
</p>
<p>stronger forces (be it their leaders or their gods) is simply one aspect of a technique 
</p>
<p>adopted in order to withstand a situation perceived as inevitable. So when move-
</p>
<p>ments or individuals denounce the intellectual property system and the inequalities 
</p>
<p>that result from it, they contribute to a background noise of criticism whose exis-
</p>
<p>tence does little more than reveal a power relation within the established order, fol-
</p>
<p>lowing Foucault&rsquo;s idea that every power goes hand in hand with a form of resistance 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>76
</p>
<p>to it. Yet the fact that the dominant power structure is continuously trying to legiti-
</p>
<p>mize itself and its political decisions does not mean that these efforts are effective. 
</p>
<p>That is, efforts to persuade the dominated do not necessarily lead to their consent. 
</p>
<p>And as James C. Scott points out, the level of effort invested in maintaining a given 
</p>
<p>power structure also provides one element that allows us to estimate the level of 
</p>
<p>instability of this regime.50 Thus, when it is possible to elude the hypnosis that the 
</p>
<p>dominant power structure aims to induce, decoding the means that it uses to main-
</p>
<p>tain its hegemony and to make acts of resistance invisible informs the observer of 
</p>
<p>both the weaknesses and the limits of the hegemonic power.
</p>
<p> One of the strengths of the A2K movement thus is the way in which a large 
</p>
<p>number of different issues lead directly to questioning of the claims made by dom-
</p>
<p>inant powers and their regimes in order to legitimize themselves and their actions. 
</p>
<p>When merely a small percentage of the people with HIV/AIDS across the world 
</p>
<p>had access to the only drugs that could keep them alive, questions about access 
</p>
<p>were raised and political tensions resulted. This phenomenon can be explained by 
</p>
<p>the existence of a crisis situation (an uncontrolled and deadly pandemic) and the 
</p>
<p>fact that the issue is a matter of life or death.51 But where access is in question, 
</p>
<p>contention forms and gains legitimacy in situations and on issues that do not nec-
</p>
<p>essarily correspond to what are generally viewed to be people&rsquo;s most vital needs, 
</p>
<p>such as the enjoyment of the arts or access to educational material, aspects that 
</p>
<p>prove to be indispensable to the well-being, the wealth, and the stability of indi-
</p>
<p>viduals and societies.
</p>
<p> As Lawrence Liang notes, some needs, as they are understood according to com-
</p>
<p>mon representations, do not necessarily conform to the &ldquo;essential character&rdquo; of 
</p>
<p>what Gayatri Spivak calls the &ldquo;subaltern subject.&rdquo;52 Subalterns are usually seen as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;the poor&rdquo; in wealthy countries, &ldquo;people from developing countries,&rdquo; and anybody 
</p>
<p>who is discriminated against and essentialized as being inferior and consequently 
</p>
<p>thought of as having mainly rudimentary needs. For these populations, needs that 
</p>
<p>coincide with their desire to improve their well-being or their position in society&mdash;
</p>
<p>and hence needs that possibly go with tendencies to question or transgress the 
</p>
<p>established order&mdash;tend to be easily disqualified. Similarly, regardless of what is 
</p>
<p>stated by international declarations or conventions, what constitutes human rights 
</p>
<p>often varies depending on whose rights are being discussed. A2K advocates ques-
</p>
<p>tion what qualifies as &ldquo;primary&rdquo; or &ldquo;essential&rdquo; needs or rights. They hold a variety of 
</p>
<p>conceptions of needs and rights, from the need to save lives to Amartya Sen&rsquo;s notion 
</p>
<p>of positive freedom and the necessity of taking into account a person&rsquo;s concrete 
</p>
<p>ability to be or do something beyond the mere existence of theoretical &ldquo;rights.&rdquo;53
</p>
<p> Endeavors to politicize otherwise accepted situations and to promote what 
</p>
<p>A2K advocates see as the legitimate expectations of individuals or of societies are

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>77
</p>
<p>all the more necessary because in a taken-for-granted hierarchy of needs, vital, 
</p>
<p>but unmet needs systematically operate to obscure others that are perceived as 
</p>
<p>less important. For example, the need for life-saving medicines obscures the need 
</p>
<p>for cultural goods. By the same token, obvious price barriers that prevent people 
</p>
<p>from meeting their basic needs mask the effect of less noticeable and less tangible 
</p>
<p>obstacles: The effect of the high prices of books trumps the effect of copyright 
</p>
<p>regimes. Moreover, most affected people do not necessarily have a clear under-
</p>
<p>standing of their own exclusion, for the principle underlined by Pierre Bourdieu 
</p>
<p>operates fully: As cultural deprivation increases, the awareness thereof actually 
</p>
<p>decreases.54 Interviews investigating barriers to access to knowledge in Thailand 
</p>
<p>revealed that &ldquo;ordinary people&rdquo; (by this I mean people who have no special inter-
</p>
<p>est in or knowledge of intellectual property) often have a difficult time identifying 
</p>
<p>the concrete effect of intellectual property in their own daily lives.55 The study 
</p>
<p>found that a mother was quicker to blame changes in the curriculum at her child&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>school that required her to buy brand new books for her second child, instead of 
</p>
<p>using the ones her first child used, than she was to identify the many barriers 
</p>
<p>instituted by the enforcement of intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p> As Bourdieu has noted, for such people in such situations, &ldquo;the problem is that, 
</p>
<p>for the most part, the established order is not a problem.&rdquo;56 It is the characteristic 
</p>
<p>of power structures to dissemble the problems that they author and/or condone. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, an important goal for the A2K mobilization is to educate people and 
</p>
<p>encourage them to insist upon their needs and rights and the redefinition of them, 
</p>
<p>rather than relinquish them in the face of situations that tend to obfuscate the true 
</p>
<p>sources of their frustration.57
</p>
<p> The A2K mobilization bears the political forms of an organized and formal 
</p>
<p>movement confronting institutionalized powers, and it has been increasingly con-
</p>
<p>sidered as such. It also includes concealed individual acts of resistance and every-
</p>
<p>day-life actions that occur under the radar of the usual observers of social move-
</p>
<p>ments. Many such acts would be considered utilitarian, rather than as the result of 
</p>
<p>a concerted or deliberate effort of resistance, but still, they contradict the rules of 
</p>
<p>the dominant power. Music exchanges between friends, the occasional purchase of 
</p>
<p>copies of DVDs or CDs in street markets in New York or Casablanca, the sharing of 
</p>
<p>software among students and colleagues&mdash;each of these, albeit mostly unwittingly, 
</p>
<p>constitutes grains of sand in the cogs of the system of intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p> New potentialities derived from changes in the production of wealth provide 
</p>
<p>tools that allow ordinary people to resist domination discretely through simple 
</p>
<p>daily actions, even while appearing to be mere passive and accepting subjects. 
</p>
<p>These are the unstructured, hidden acts of resistance that belong to what Scott 
</p>
<p>calls &ldquo;infrapolitics.&rdquo;58 Most individuals throughout history and still today have not 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>78
</p>
<p>enjoyed the luxury of becoming part of an organized and public political move-
</p>
<p>ment. However, a vast array of sporadic and often almost invisible political actions 
</p>
<p>is commonly undertaken by subalterns in order to embellish their everyday life 
</p>
<p>within the system or in order to weaken the forces of oppression, injustice, and 
</p>
<p>repression.59 Their actions are the subversive ways of being that are the province 
</p>
<p>of the dominated: poaching, escaping, finagling, pirating, getting around the law 
</p>
<p>when they are outcasts, or trying to use loopholes in the law, leaking documents 
</p>
<p>when they are government agents.
</p>
<p> One of the challenges for the A2K movement is to help &ldquo;ordinary people&rdquo; real-
</p>
<p>ize that they have an interest in engaging in these battles and that they have the 
</p>
<p>means to do so. This is how the conditions of the reproduction of domination&mdash;
</p>
<p>including the fact that they appear legitimate to the dominated themselves&mdash;can 
</p>
<p>be disrupted. In encouraging resistance by ordinary people, the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>can take advantage of the possibilities resulting from the alliance of new technolo-
</p>
<p>gies with the new aspirations that have emerged with them.
</p>
<p>perspectives and representations seen through the a2k prism
</p>
<p>The potential success of the A2K movement thus depends not only on its ability 
</p>
<p>to make visible and emphasize the social dimensions and effects of the protection 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property, but on its ability to help individuals to perceive the world 
</p>
<p>differently.
</p>
<p> A2K scholars and activists try to give a higher profile to concepts such as the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;commons&rdquo; or the &ldquo;public domain,&rdquo; concepts that offer resources and alternatives 
</p>
<p>in the organization of society on a pragmatic level and that also provide individu-
</p>
<p>als with ways to question and rethink their relations to their economic, social, and 
</p>
<p>political environment. This means undoing, to some extent, prevailing conceptions 
</p>
<p>and beliefs by digging breaches in the imaginary established by the advocates 
</p>
<p>for increased intellectual property restrictions and by summoning references and 
</p>
<p>knowledge ignored or disregarded in the current system.
</p>
<p> Many of the questions that are discussed by A2K advocates, such as the com-
</p>
<p>mons or the role of the public domain, have been raised in the past. However, 
</p>
<p>the memory of these previous discussions seems to have been lost, and the terms 
</p>
<p>of the debates have been reversed. Contrary to discussions in the eighteenth and 
</p>
<p>nineteenth centuries, today, the ultimate fear is not seeing the public domain 
</p>
<p>eviscerated, but rather seeing intellectual property contravened. Reflection and 
</p>
<p>analysis are massively focusing on how to create new exclusive rights and how 
</p>
<p>to enforce them, while needed debates on how the commons can be organized 
</p>
<p>and managed, for instance, occupy a small minority of people. For things to be

<p>different, an inversion of perspectives is required, something that would shake 
</p>
<p>up the realm of representations. Doing so requires the movement to be able to 
</p>
<p>question the social values inculcated in the system in which we live&mdash;values at the 
</p>
<p>origin of the production of representations and of behaviors.
</p>
<p> I won&rsquo;t discuss in detail here the arguments and concepts employed by defend-
</p>
<p>ers of access to knowledge and their critiques of the claims advanced by advo-
</p>
<p>cates of intellectual property extremism. They appear throughout the book and 
</p>
<p>are discussed in depth in Amy Kapczynski&rsquo;s introductory essay, &ldquo;Toward a Concep-
</p>
<p>tual Genealogy of Access to Knowledge.&rdquo; Rather, I will conclude here by exploring 
</p>
<p>what is at stake in the maintenance and reproduction of the representations and 
</p>
<p>social values that underwrite the effort to preserve and extend intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty restrictions and in the A2K movement&rsquo;s efforts to disrupt those representa-
</p>
<p>tions and appeal to other values.
</p>
<p> The conversion into privately owned goods of goods and ideas that once con-
</p>
<p>stituted property held in common or that were not included in the realm of prop-
</p>
<p>erty diminishes the sense of the role commons or public goods play in society, 
</p>
<p>because valorizing private property depreciates the value of goods accessible by 
</p>
<p>all. Thus, the emergence of the concept of intellectual property and the exponen-
</p>
<p>tial growth of the protection of intellectual property rights have accompanied the 
</p>
<p>relinquishment of the belief in the &ldquo;productive power of the commons&rdquo; and has 
</p>
<p>inhibited recognition of the possibility that types of economy based on something 
</p>
<p>other than the possession and exploitation of private property are viable.60 Mean-
</p>
<p>while, the logic of privatization, together with the rationality claimed for mar-
</p>
<p>kets, both of which are fostered and publicly praised by neoliberals, largely have 
</p>
<p>helped undermine the values attributed to all that is public. These developments 
</p>
<p>slowly, yet profoundly change the way that societies are organized, as well as their 
</p>
<p>dynamics of consumption, the relationship between individuals, and even individ-
</p>
<p>uals&rsquo; understanding of themselves. At the time of the first enclosure movement, 
</p>
<p>the privatization of the land was claimed to be a way to limit &ldquo;strategies of over-
</p>
<p>use and underinvestment,&rdquo; and the transformations of economies that it generated 
</p>
<p>were often viewed as progressive and beneficial to society.61 Although these asser-
</p>
<p>tions are debatable, the notion that &ldquo;this innovation in property systems allowed 
</p>
<p>an unparalleled expansion of productive possibilities&rdquo; still prevails without being 
</p>
<p>subject to direct discussion in most cases.62 Those are beliefs that accompanied the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the current intellectual property system and on which claims for 
</p>
<p>the apparent superiority of the model since then have rested.
</p>
<p> In today&rsquo;s society, some A2K advocates argue that a second enclosure move-
</p>
<p>ment, in the form of increasing restrictions on intellectual property, immaterial 
</p>
<p>property, and other forms of information and knowledge mostly favors strategies 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>80
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;undermine processes of abundance intrinsic to nature&rdquo; and thus organize 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;artificial scarcity&rdquo; while ultimately harming the innovative potential of individu-
</p>
<p>als and societies.63 Some believe that the technological changes that took place in 
</p>
<p>the past several decades should lead to radical change in the way the knowledge 
</p>
<p>economy is thought about and organized, including the ways that intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights are conceived and used.64 As critics point out, for instance, nonrivalrous 
</p>
<p>goods are increasingly involved in human activities, and there can be &ldquo;no tragedy 
</p>
<p>for nonrivalrous goods left in the commons,&rdquo; because by definition, &ldquo;a nonrivalrous 
</p>
<p>resource can&rsquo;t be exhausted.&rdquo;65 Such evolutions require a general reassessment of 
</p>
<p>attitudes and laws regarding property, because what may have been seen as pre-
</p>
<p>dominantly beneficial to societies in the past and in the context of mercantile or 
</p>
<p>industrial capitalism leads in the context of today&rsquo;s knowledge economy to dead 
</p>
<p>ends and dangerous imbalances in economic distribution. Developments such as 
</p>
<p>these are in themselves favorable to the emergence or reemergence of alternative 
</p>
<p>visions to the escalation of the protection of intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p> For the A2K movement, ideology is perceived as a trap, either because it is 
</p>
<p>a label placed upon the movement to undermine its credibility (when it is called 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Communist&rdquo; by its enemies) or because it is seen as a dogmatism that does not 
</p>
<p>correspond to the movement&rsquo;s flexibilities and aspirations to inclusiveness. The 
</p>
<p>A2K movement therefore bases its legitimacy on other things in order to promote 
</p>
<p>the desired transition from the intellectual property regime to the A2K paradigm. 
</p>
<p>However, in this time of global financial, economic, and ecological crisis, which 
</p>
<p>may contribute to dispelling the illusion of the efficiency and cohesion of the 
</p>
<p>neoliberal state and undermine its credibility, alternative propositions for society 
</p>
<p>might find a better environment for their development and reception.66 Under 
</p>
<p>present conditions, it may become possible to question the dominant discourses 
</p>
<p>and make other fictions intelligible, other possibilities comprehensible.
</p>
<p> From the struggle over intellectual property emerges the common understanding 
</p>
<p>that creativity, whether it is used as a justification for intellectual property rights or 
</p>
<p>sought simply for its own good, represents an ultimate goal and a shared value in our 
</p>
<p>contemporary world.67 Of course, A2K advocates and the defenders of copyrights 
</p>
<p>and other exclusive rights remain opposed regarding the issue of what makes cre-
</p>
<p>ation possible and of how creation takes place. Here, the conflict is between those 
</p>
<p>who deem that the best way to meet this goal is through more control over intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property and those who, on the contrary, think it is through increased freedom.
</p>
<p> One of the major criticisms of the proprietarian approach is that it in fact fails 
</p>
<p>to fulfill what it promises: the promotion and guarantee of innovation. Instead, 
</p>
<p>while shrinking the public domain, it actually jeopardizes or &ldquo;cripples&rdquo; creativ-
</p>
<p>ity, to use Lessig&rsquo;s eloquent expression.68 The first thing that property rules limit 
</p>
<p>krikorian</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>81
</p>
<p>is indeed that freedom to assimilate and transform knowledge, a freedom that is 
</p>
<p>critical to creation, whether it be achieved through direct copying or mere quot-
</p>
<p>ing. Extremist intellectual property positions tend to banish totally the possibili-
</p>
<p>ties of quotation and borrowing. This is the case with audiovisual technologies, 
</p>
<p>for example, for which the right to quotation is almost nonexistent, in spite of 
</p>
<p>the fact that it has always existed for other media and disciplines. To take a com-
</p>
<p>monplace example, imagine what science would be like if scientists couldn&rsquo;t quote 
</p>
<p>and use each other&rsquo;s work and thereby expose and criticize or improve preexist-
</p>
<p>ing assumptions or demonstrations. At the other end of the spectrum of quoting 
</p>
<p>practices, the collection of quotations assembled by philosopher and critic Walter 
</p>
<p>Benjamin, which was at the center of his work, provides a good example of how 
</p>
<p>the montage and rearrangement of existing pieces of text can generate original 
</p>
<p>creation, reveal hidden aspects of what has been taken for granted, and forge 
</p>
<p>novel understanding of reality: &ldquo;Benjamin&rsquo;s ideal&rdquo; was to produce &ldquo;a work con-
</p>
<p>sisting entirely of quotations, one that was mounted so masterfully that it could 
</p>
<p>dispense with any accompanying text. . . . The main work consisted in tearing frag-
</p>
<p>ments out of their context and arranging them afresh in such a way that they illus-
</p>
<p>trated one another and were able to prove their raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre in a free-floating 
</p>
<p>state, as it were.&rdquo;69
</p>
<p> Similarly, the creative function of quoting and borrowing has always been 
</p>
<p>essential to music composition. Citations, manipulations &ldquo;&agrave; la mani&egrave;re de,&rdquo; and bla-
</p>
<p>tant references to preceding masters have figured throughout the classical music 
</p>
<p>composition that marked the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the movie 
</p>
<p>soundtracks of the twentieth century, to mention only two examples. Today, artis-
</p>
<p>tic and intellectual production using digital technologies continues to be depen-
</p>
<p>dant on the ability to copy and to borrow. Perhaps in an even more obvious man-
</p>
<p>ner than before, previous works are the raw material of future creation. As Cory 
</p>
<p>Doctorow notes: &ldquo;if copying on the Internet were ended tomorrow, it would be the 
</p>
<p>end of culture on the Internet too. YouTube would vanish without its storehouse 
</p>
<p>of infringing clips; LiveJournal would be dead without all those interesting little 
</p>
<p>user-icons and those fascinating pastebombs from books, news-stories and blogs; 
</p>
<p>Flickr would dry up and blow away without all those photos of copyrighted, trade-
</p>
<p>marked and otherwise protected objects, works, and scenes.&rdquo;70
</p>
<p> But the freedom to use existing things affects not only our ability to produce, 
</p>
<p>determining the number of tools and quantity of raw material that we access, but 
</p>
<p>also the ways we comprehend things and relate to them. The act of quoting allows 
</p>
<p>us to place ourselves and our discourses within a heritage, a continuity. Thus, the 
</p>
<p>sphere of immaterial public goods or immaterial commons involves more than just 
</p>
<p>sources of inspiration or mere material resources of creativity. It offers individuals 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>82
</p>
<p>shared landmarks that inscribe them in a common temporality that is a present 
</p>
<p>time, but also a common past. One who subtracts material from the public field 
</p>
<p>disrupts and impoverishes the collective memory and in so doing affects the 
</p>
<p>capacity of individuals to think for themselves, collectively as well as individually. 
</p>
<p>As Hannah Arendt put it, what Walter Benjamin called the &ldquo;collector&rsquo;s attitude&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>results in the withdrawal of things from the public and with them &ldquo;all kinds of 
</p>
<p>things that were once public property&rdquo; as a way to establish himself in the past.71 
</p>
<p>Consequently, others are deprived of the opportunity to make the same kind of 
</p>
<p>connection, because the act of withdrawing goods from the public domain can be 
</p>
<p>compared to the act of removing elements of a common past, thereby foreclosing 
</p>
<p>the possibility of common relationships to them that otherwise would be allowed 
</p>
<p>to the rest of society. Public goods are made of a common past shared in the pres-
</p>
<p>ent, and access to partial or truncated material limits not only individuals&rsquo; ability 
</p>
<p>to act and to create in that present, but also their relationship to the past, to their 
</p>
<p>culture, and to their history. It is through material traces left by others that the 
</p>
<p>past is made accessible, allowing history to play its proper social role and position-
</p>
<p>ing individuals as cultural mediators.
</p>
<p> The cultural losses, impoverishment, and amnesia that occur in the name of 
</p>
<p>progress and innovation also occur in a geopolitical dimension. In developing 
</p>
<p>countries, and that means many countries of the world, portions of their cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage are lost at the hands of the macroprocesses associated with capitalist pres-
</p>
<p>sure that favors the spread of Western culture, as well as by virtue of the limited 
</p>
<p>means (financial, technological, or legal) available in these countries to store and 
</p>
<p>share their cultural resources. This is not to say that there is necessarily an extinc-
</p>
<p>tion of the cultures that fail to qualify as dominant, or that these cultures do not 
</p>
<p>disseminate ideas and works on a global scale, as well, or even that globalization 
</p>
<p>necessarily transforms people in non-Western countries into simple consumers of 
</p>
<p>imported cultural goods. Indeed, appropriation and transformation processes take 
</p>
<p>place everywhere. They happen when Indians watch, enjoy, and reinterpret Amer-
</p>
<p>ican TV shows, when Americans shoot movies that aim at portraying the reality of 
</p>
<p>Indian cities in a more authentic way than Bollywood does, and when the booty 
</p>
<p>bass music from U.S. ghettos becomes the baile funk of the Brazilian favelas before 
</p>
<p>being adapted by Italian musicians and distributed by German producers at Pari-
</p>
<p>sian parties. But the control by intellectual property rules of access to technologies 
</p>
<p>and resources surely favors certain flows and certain directions for these flows. 
</p>
<p>It limits or harms the preservation and transmission of certain cultural produc-
</p>
<p>tions. At the same time, knowledge that is privatized and removed from the public 
</p>
<p>domain in wealthy countries or anywhere else on the planet is thus made inacces-
</p>
<p>sible to most people in these countries, since the only way to access resources is 
</p>
<p>krikorian</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>83
</p>
<p>then to pay for access. &ldquo;As in the relation between colonized and colonizer, knowl-
</p>
<p>edge is anything but symmetrical.&rdquo;72
</p>
<p> This is what is called cultural domination. And if it has implications for the 
</p>
<p>production of and access to knowledge, it can also interfere with the conceptual 
</p>
<p>work of the A2K movement itself. For example, despite the best of intentions, use 
</p>
<p>of a notion such as the public domain might reinforce existing cultural domination. 
</p>
<p>As Carlos M. Correa and Jeffrey Atteberry mention in this volume, advocating the 
</p>
<p>defense and expansion of the public domain applied to traditional knowledge or 
</p>
<p>biodiversity can also allow corporations to seize whatever knowledge or resources 
</p>
<p>they want, while indigenous people remain once more without control over the 
</p>
<p>means needed to protect their own resources and the ways in which they are val-
</p>
<p>ued and employed.73
</p>
<p> This is where the A2K constellation might want to consider its geographi-
</p>
<p>cal positions and contours with caution, for tensions over the issues of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property are produced not only in the context of exploiting or opposing the 
</p>
<p>operations of capitalist logic, but also in the context of exercising or resisting the 
</p>
<p>exercise of imperialist logic. To serve the equality or universality sought by A2K 
</p>
<p>advocates, their own practices of conceptualizing what they consider to be desir-
</p>
<p>able ends must constantly be reflected on and questioned, taking such contexts 
</p>
<p>into account. A dominant culture &ldquo;tends to produce the representations through 
</p>
<p>which it is perceived (whether rejected or imitated) by others,&rdquo;74 which naturally 
</p>
<p>affects the criticisms that are formulated against it and the solutions called upon 
</p>
<p>to facilitate emancipation therefrom. In the process of elaborating &ldquo;its own repre-
</p>
<p>sentations of the dominant culture,&rdquo; any struggle against this domination needs to 
</p>
<p>question the values that the critics of the dominant culture themselves promote 
</p>
<p>and the way they define and use them, whether the topic be property, private 
</p>
<p>ownership, or the concept of the commons or the public domain.75 It is particularly 
</p>
<p>what constitutes their common share, the metal of the two faces of the coin that 
</p>
<p>unites proponents and opponents of the dominant culture, that requires meticu-
</p>
<p>lous questioning.
</p>
<p> Cultural domination has many ways to influence people&rsquo;s behaviors and their 
</p>
<p>comprehension of what is possible and what is not. Fear is an essential element 
</p>
<p>employed in the arguments for intellectual property rights protection and in the 
</p>
<p>discourses of neoliberal rationality as a means of influencing people&rsquo;s choices and 
</p>
<p>behavior. We live in an era when, at least in Western countries, the fear of getting 
</p>
<p>in trouble for having encroached upon others&rsquo; property (even when the boundar-
</p>
<p>ies that define it are invisible) is almost omnipresent. Penalties are involved: Minor 
</p>
<p>encroachments can make you liable for damages, subject you to social opprobrium, 
</p>
<p>and even lead to legal punishments. But in a less draconian manner, we&rsquo;ve been 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84
</p>
<p>taught to fear that unless you&rsquo;ve paid well for what you acquire, you can end up 
</p>
<p>less well off than you were before, due to the possibility that what you are getting 
</p>
<p>is &ldquo;bad&rdquo; by nature: It is of poor quality, won&rsquo;t last, and/or it is harmful. This follows 
</p>
<p>as a matter of course from the &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; that holds that if you want quality, you 
</p>
<p>have to pay for it. As Lessig has noted &ldquo;lurking in the background of our collec-
</p>
<p>tive thought is a hunch that free resources are somehow inferior.&rdquo;76 Bad quality for 
</p>
<p>instance, will have consequences on your health if what you are getting is medicines, 
</p>
<p>and it can damage your computer or make you lose all your data if it is software.
</p>
<p> As Wendy Brown has put it, in the neoliberal context, the state &ldquo;attempts to 
</p>
<p>construct prudent subjects through policies that organize such prudence.&rdquo;77 And 
</p>
<p>people are forced to choose sides. Antipiracy advertisements remind us in blunt 
</p>
<p>terms of the choice that is offered: If you buy copies of DVDs or software, &ldquo;you 
</p>
<p>are either for terrorism or support the war on terror.&rdquo;78 Under the current domi-
</p>
<p>nant political rationality, what is considered &ldquo;property infringement,&rdquo; &ldquo;piracy,&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; seem easier and easier to equate with each other and assimilate to each 
</p>
<p>other. Professionals who work in the copyright field can testify that this conflation 
</p>
<p>of infringements of intellectual property rights with terrorism is not only propa-
</p>
<p>ganda intended for the general public, but a message that shapes policy making. 
</p>
<p>It is indeed becoming common to hear people in national policy-making or inter-
</p>
<p>national meetings equating piracy with terrorism without hesitation or any sense 
</p>
<p>of restraint. In the end, the result is a vicious circle: Even if enforcement policies 
</p>
<p>cannot pin down each act of infringement, the scarecrow effect of criminalization 
</p>
<p>fuels fears and suspicions that deter people&rsquo;s infringing behaviors.
</p>
<p> In Argentina in 2002, workers took control of the Zanon plant in an occupation 
</p>
<p>that continued for several years. The plant, a ceramics factory that had been closed 
</p>
<p>by an owner who no longer considered it profitable, had previously received mil-
</p>
<p>lions of dollars in public subsidies as part of the corporate welfare program of the 
</p>
<p>Carlos Menem government. The workers decided to reject their fate and called for 
</p>
<p>the expropriation of the plant in the name of the public investment made, declar-
</p>
<p>ing Zanon &ldquo;of the people.&rdquo;79 They exercised the &ldquo;right to reappropriation&rdquo; of the 
</p>
<p>multitude that, according to Hardt and Negri &ldquo;is first of all the right of reappropri-
</p>
<p>ation of the means of production.&rdquo;80 They decided to seize control of the engine of 
</p>
<p>production and render it the common property of those who actually operated it. 
</p>
<p>In the face of this attempt to impose an alternative way of being, Menem declared 
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;we will impose order . . . we will impose respect of the state of law. Among 
</p>
<p>other things, the right to private property.&rdquo;81
</p>
<p> In this episode, two ethics conflicted. In the end, as force was deployed by 
</p>
<p>the state, the right to private property prevailed in most of the plants. But it is 
</p>
<p>certainly easier to enforce property rights and hunt down pirates in the physical 
</p>
<p>krikorian</p>
<p/>

<p>85
</p>
<p>world than in the digital one. In the immaterial realm, reappropriation does not 
</p>
<p>necessarily require expropriation. It is use that is the key.82 Thus, the terms of the 
</p>
<p>confrontation may change.
</p>
<p> Use per se can be subversive. If beliefs and fears do not curb it, the use that 
</p>
<p>people make of protected material can open breaches in immaterial barriers and 
</p>
<p>render them useless as filters, taking away from them the power to confer profit 
</p>
<p>and social position. Massive use by individuals of data covered by intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights can easily become uncontrollable, and organized digital networks 
</p>
<p>can impose a commons by simple virtue of producing and making available their 
</p>
<p>production. To refuse the manufacturing of illegality and criminalization appears 
</p>
<p>in itself as a legitimate and useful horizon for the A2K movement, starting with 
</p>
<p>questioning the definition of what is illegal by performing threatened acts and 
</p>
<p>challenging the hold of fear.83
</p>
<p> But what the issue of use determines is also the way questions are politicized. 
</p>
<p>With the advent of a world in which the production of immaterial goods is increas-
</p>
<p>ing can also come new ways to conceptualize and formulate politics as well as to 
</p>
<p>elaborate political action, because in such a world, possession is not exactly the 
</p>
<p>same thing as ownership. The conflict over the Zanon ceramics plant was staged 
</p>
<p>over the material means of production. Where immaterial goods are involved, ben-
</p>
<p>efiting from capitalist appropriation does not necessarily require possessing the 
</p>
<p>means of production. Instead, it involves having control over what is to be given 
</p>
<p>value&mdash;goods and elements that in fact cannot anyway be materially owned. In 
</p>
<p>this context, it is access that needs to be controlled, rather than the strict owner-
</p>
<p>ship of goods. That is why access is such a central issue, why it is at the center of 
</p>
<p>so many conflicts today.
</p>
<p> The issue of access is a central issue because it is a product of its time.84 Yet 
</p>
<p>emphasizing it is also a strategic choice: The machine that we are ourselves is obvi-
</p>
<p>ously more complex than a machine in a plant. So are its relationships and interac-
</p>
<p>tions with the material and immaterial environments that surround it. Thus, the 
</p>
<p>agency that is involved in its use challenges control in many ways and can more 
</p>
<p>easily evade it, as the ever more repressive attempts to enforce intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights demonstrate. Thus, seen through the prism of access, the terms that 
</p>
<p>crystallize political mobilization differ. They no longer begin with the distinction 
</p>
<p>between public and private property. When attention is focused on access, what 
</p>
<p>is invoked is justice, equality, or freedom, without directly confronting the issue  
</p>
<p>of property.
</p>
<p> But of course, the issue of property cannot so easily be liquidated. On the con-
</p>
<p>trary, the current struggles over access to knowledge reopen a debate over prop-
</p>
<p>erty. Through efforts to build social rights based on the new, emerging possibilities

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>86
</p>
<p>for sharing and an ideal of access, the movement questions property and the role 
</p>
<p>it should play in our societies. It is a whole field of contests that open along new 
</p>
<p>lines of conflict. Meanwhile, as in other contexts, to exercise freedom&mdash;here, the 
</p>
<p>freedom of use&mdash;requires being in the position to do so, and thus, there is no 
</p>
<p>escape from the issue of the conditions necessary to exert freedom.
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>The global increase and strengthening of norms of intellectual property protection 
</p>
<p>in the past decades is symptomatic of the emergence of information technologies 
</p>
<p>and attempts by capitalist entrepreneurs to benefit from these changes. Because 
</p>
<p>we are in a phase of intense globalization of economic exchanges and communica-
</p>
<p>tion in which the materiality of property dissolves, capitalists, seeking accumula-
</p>
<p>tion, have tried to define, categorize, and make the most of immaterial property. 
</p>
<p>But in the knowledge economy, old models have become obsolete on many levels. 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights owners do not seem to realize it, but cognitive capital-
</p>
<p>ism relies on forms of creation and innovation derived from new modes of produc-
</p>
<p>tion. The production process is increasingly based on &ldquo;a new relationship between 
</p>
<p>production and consumption,&rdquo; and as Maurizio Lazzarato points out, &ldquo;what is &lsquo;pro-
</p>
<p>ductive&rsquo; is the whole of the social relation.&rdquo;85 In the end, this new relationship may 
</p>
<p>advance the legitimacy of the A2K movement more than anything else, and rights 
</p>
<p>owners may simply prove unable to adapt: To date, their responses to the major 
</p>
<p>technological changes that have altered the functioning of capitalism have priori-
</p>
<p>tized the pursuit and the fortification of old strategies. Attempts to maintain these 
</p>
<p>models by criminalizing and forbidding human behavior, although they fit well 
</p>
<p>the ways of neoliberal governance, appear obsolete, poorly adapted to the current 
</p>
<p>reality, and redolent of the &ldquo;putrid and tyrannical obsolescence&rdquo; that Hardt and 
</p>
<p>Negri evoke.86 As Immanuel Wallerstein says about the future of the United States, 
</p>
<p>it may be that factors that originally worked to establish the intellectual property 
</p>
<p>system&rsquo;s hegemony will ultimately bring about its end.87
</p>
<p> New forms of communication and production also influence the way people 
</p>
<p>interact with each other and engage in the production of culture and informa-
</p>
<p>tion.88 The free and open-source software movement shows the efficacy of these 
</p>
<p>social practices of production, sharing, and distribution. Such practices are not in 
</p>
<p>themselves new, but exercised in the current technological and political context, 
</p>
<p>they bring new potentialities in terms of individual capacities and collective action 
</p>
<p>and may contribute to the production of the conditions for the emergence of a 
</p>
<p>new political subjectivity. They represent a power in the capitalist world on which 
</p>
<p>the A2K movement can rely to promote a new politics and new ways of doing

</p>
<p>politics. The relational aspects of creation and knowledge production imply a form 
</p>
<p>of equality in the process through which individuals contribute and exchange. 
</p>
<p>This equality is both a practice of creation (the &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; communication and 
</p>
<p>collaboration allowed by new technologies and formats, such as blogs and social-
</p>
<p>networking sites) and a political value promoted by A2K advocates who take 
</p>
<p>into account the various needs and particularities of specific groups of individ-
</p>
<p>uals. Because of the nature of digital goods, the exercise of the freedom of use 
</p>
<p>represents a possible course of action for movements and a key value to them. 
</p>
<p>The A2K movement thus corresponds to a form of mobilization that can concili-
</p>
<p>ate an inheritance from identity politics and more traditional claims for social jus-
</p>
<p>tice. In that respect, the A2K movement represents an evolution in the modes of
</p>
<p> social mobilization.
</p>
<p> The alliance between new forms of production based on new approaches to 
</p>
<p>cooperation, on the one hand, and ways to conceptualize politics developed and 
</p>
<p>brought to the forefront by the A2K movement, on the other, may provide an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to oppose intellectual property extremism. More broadly, such a 
</p>
<p>development also offers the chance to act outside of the immaterial walls erected 
</p>
<p>by intellectual property protection and to exit at least intermittently from the con-
</p>
<p>straints of neoliberal rationality, even perhaps causing the state to act in a differ-
</p>
<p>ent manner, as well.
</p>
<p> The neoliberal form of colonization is a cultural and political attempt at subjec-
</p>
<p>tion affecting every individual. A2K advocates are looking for a way out, promot-
</p>
<p>ing a morality based on values they wish to see emerge in politics. In the eyes of 
</p>
<p>those in the movement, the current system is not good for two main reasons: It 
</p>
<p>does not fulfill its own objectives in terms of innovation, and it is not fair in terms 
</p>
<p>of access. As a field of activism, the A2K movement fights on both of these fronts 
</p>
<p>and articulates one to the other, one preceding the other according to the context 
</p>
<p>of the discussion within political spheres or in public debate. While the utilitarian 
</p>
<p>concerns of the A2K movement anchor it in the capitalist system, its social justice 
</p>
<p>claims reinject a moral dimension into the discussion, because the issue of access 
</p>
<p>offers a new way to consider the issue of property. A2K advocates make use of 
</p>
<p>the issue of access to rally many different constituencies, taking advantage of the 
</p>
<p>flexibility of the notion to elude a number of pitfalls, whether these be representa-
</p>
<p>tions they want to evade (dominant ideologies, political labels) or political tradi-
</p>
<p>tions they do not want to identify with or be identified with because they seem 
</p>
<p>outdated and do not appear to offer successful avenues for change.
</p>
<p> The use of the issue of access makes it possible to avoid such pitfalls, but ulti-
</p>
<p>mately, it also leads in its own way to a critique of property. If everybody can 
</p>
<p>access a good, the benefit of property instantly crumbles. The other side of the 
</p>
<p>a field of activism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>88
</p>
<p>coin is that in the immaterial world, the control of access de facto replaces owner-
</p>
<p>ship. Thus, the political result of the A2K strategy may lead to greater disruptions 
</p>
<p>than what many actors were anticipating when they first became involved in this 
</p>
<p>battle. This is where a new politics of access to knowledge starts.

<p>14 Sorting information is a key issue for many in the virtual world. You may be surrounded by 
</p>
<p>information and still not have access to knowledge or be in a position to enjoy it or use it 
</p>
<p>if you cannot sort and select the information you need or the appropriate knowledge. It is 
</p>
<p>not for nothing that strategies to counter censorship of the Internet are in part based on the 
</p>
<p>camouflaging of pertinent information in an accumulation of useless data, forcing would-be 
</p>
<p>censors to lose as much time as possible in the search for &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; content. For example,

<p>16 Another problem is that behind the use of the term &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; as an umbrella adjective to 
</p>
<p>characterize legal rights that concern disparate intangible assets in forms and natures lies an 
</p>
<p>ideological manipulation to legitimize a political move dedicated to serve simultaneously the 
</p>

<p>18 The strategy of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for example, consists 
</p>
<p>of picking a sample of individuals (around forty thousand) out of a pool of millions who 
</p>
<p>have been identified as sharing music, then claiming copyright infringement and threatening 
</p>
<p>to take them to court. In August 2007, four major music labels, the Universal Music Group, 
</p>
<p>Warner Music Group, EMI, and Sony Music, filed a suit against Joel Tenenbaum, a graduate 
</p>
<p>student, for file downloading and illegal sharing. Tenenbaum, along with Jammie Thomas-
</p>
<p>Rasset, were then the only persons in the United States accused of illegal file sharing to have 
</p>
<p>their cases taken before a jury. The vast majority of people when contacted by copyright 
</p>
<p>owners claiming copyright infringement agree to pay the requested financial settlement. In 
</p>
<p>June 2009, Thomas-Rasset was found liable for copyright infringement and ordered to pay 
</p>
<p>nearly $2 million. In July 2009, Tenenbaum was condemned to pay $675,000 for illegally 
</p>
<p>downloading and distributing thirty copyrighted songs. He decided to appeal. See Joel Tenen-

<p>21 It would be worth discussing at length whether the Internet can be seen as a public space in 
</p>
<p>Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s sense and whether the public domain can be understood as being equiv-
</p>
<p>alent to the political domain. The political implications of this question are important for 
</p>
<p>the issue of the preservation of public space and as a context for the ability of individuals 
</p>
<p>to realize political action. According to Arendt, a public space is a space that allows active 
</p>
<p>citizenship, a space in which individuals can gather and encounter one another to deliberate 
</p>
<p>about matters of collective concern. In such political spaces, each citizen is in a position to 
</p>
<p>exercise the powers of agency, to develop the capacities for judgment, and to develop con-
</p>
<p>certed action aiming at political efficacy. Initiatives such as the Web site www.nosdeputes.fr, 
</p>
<p>dedicated to the observation by citizens of the activities of the members of the French Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, the sharing of political information, and the pooling of citizens&rsquo; comments, resemble 
</p>
<p>an attempt to create such a space.

<p>25 With 7.1 percent of the votes in its country, the Swedish Piratpartiet won two seats in the

</p>
<p>eralism: How to Derail the Political Rationales that Impose Strong Intellectual Property Pro-
</p>
<p>tection&rdquo; in this volume, I develop the relationship between neoliberalism and the transforma-
</p>
<p>tions triggered by the industry regarding intellectual property rights. As Michel Feher notes, 
</p>
<p>however, the motivation for the neoliberal state to support industry is not systematical. It is 
</p>
<p>mostly fueled by the political gain that the state can foresee in the crisis of sovereignty that 
</p>
<p>it is facing in its desire to optimize its &ldquo;residual power.&rdquo; For a discussion of the functioning 
</p>
<p>of neoliberalism see the analysis developed by Michel Feher in Vacarme, starting in Vacarme 
</p>
<p>51 (Spring 2010) and continuing in the following issues. If that proves true, despite the social 
</p>
<p>determinism that influences actors and other class interests at stake, an interesting avenue 
</p>
<p>could open to A2K advocates, as long as they succeed in framing what they would like the 
</p>
<p>state to do in a way that convinces it that such actions will serve to shore up its political 
</p>
<p>power. This is something that has begun to happen to some extent with environmental issues: 
</p>
<p>The adoption of policies in favor of the environment has become politically rewarding. For-
</p>
<p>mer vice president and presidential candidate Al Gore&rsquo;s campaign against global warming is 
</p>
<p>probably both a trigger and an illustration of this trend. See, for example, the movie An 
</p>
<p>Inconvenient Truth, which revolves around Al Gore&rsquo;s travels and his efforts to educate the 
</p>
<p>public about the climate crisis.
</p>
<p>29 Comparing the range of modes of action employed by the A2K movement and the advocates 
</p>
<p>of increased intellectual property protections, one notices that most of them are the same. In 
</p>
<p>addition to lobbying and trying to infiltrate political arenas, both use media, public actions, 
</p>
<p>and the denunciation of state policies. Advocates of increased intellectual property protec-
</p>
<p>tions benefit from public actions by activist groups, as was the case when an unknown group 
</p>
<p>that started to be called &ldquo;the Red Shirts&rdquo; by AIDS activists because they wore red shirts dur-
</p>
<p>ing their actions, took the floor in support of the big pharmaceutical companies on several 
</p>
<p>occasions during an international AIDS conference in Bangkok in 2004. They also occasionally 
</p>
<p>resort to aggressive campaigns in newspapers. USA for Innovation, an NGO advocating for 
</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical company Abbott, published harsh attacks against the Thai government 
</p>
<p>when it issued compulsory licenses. Although intellectual property advocates do not organize 
</p>
<p>public marches, the difference between the registers of intervention that they employ and 
</p>
<p>those of the A2K movement is mostly a matter of proportion, not of kind.

</p>
<p>32 Just as, according to neoliberal views, the market cannot exist &ldquo;by itself,&rdquo; in nature, there 
</p>
<p>cannot be a commons or public goods left free, untouched by rules or regulations. For them 
</p>
<p>to exist and be accessible implies that some agent or agency establishes them through an act 
</p>
<p>of sovereignty and keeps them free.
</p>
<p>33 The status and the conditions of definition, occupancy, and use of these spaces are grounds 
</p>
<p>for discussion and vary greatly depending on the model proposed, whether it is patent pools, 
</p>
<p>Creative Commons licenses, open source collaboration, or something else.
</p>
<p>34 Irrespective of debates about the condition or the future of nation-state or of state sover-
</p>
<p>eignty, note that our discussion concerns the state because, even if its mode of operation and 
</p>
<p>its relations with other social actors change over time, it currently represents the dominant 
</p>
<p>model of governing and of power. Such a focus by no means denies the possibility that com-
</p>
<p>peting or alternative governing forms may emerge.
</p>
<p>35 However, the existence of these power relations raises the question of what it is that the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement excludes or truncates, besides its capacity to welcome issues and individuals. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Knowledge,&rdquo; and Jeff Atteberry, &ldquo;Information/Knowledge in the Global Society of Control: 
</p>
<p>A2K Theory and the Postcolonial Commons,&rdquo; in this volume, provide elements to reflect on 
</p>
<p>this issue, notably on the issue of traditional knowledge.

<p>vacarme.org/article537.html (last accessed January 29, 2010). To refuse to define oneself with 
</p>
<p>regard to one&rsquo;s enemy bears in itself an attempt to question the use of the term &ldquo;intellectual 
</p>
<p>property.&rdquo; Scholars and activists have discussed the conceptual effect of imposing this term 
</p>
<p>to designate, under one appellation, copyright, patents, trademarks, industrial design and 
</p>
<p>undisclosed information. The term was manufactured and imposed as an ideological vehicle 
</p>
<p>by the movement of private interests promoting exclusive rights. See James Boyle, &ldquo;The Sec-
</p>
<p>ond Enclosure Movement and the Construction of the Public Domain.&rdquo; The common use of 
</p>
<p>the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; disseminated the notion of embedding forms of knowledge 
</p>
<p>in the realm of physical property. See Richard M. Stallman, &ldquo;Did You Say &lsquo;Intellectual Prop-

<p>patent, and trademark laws are very different from property laws, the use of the term &ldquo;intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property&rdquo; creates an artificially coherent category. This is why some groups are cam-
</p>
<p>paigning for the term to be abandoned.

<p>Property,&rdquo; pp. 804&ndash;85.
</p>
<p>38 In doing so, their approach tends to differ from, for example, controversies over patents or 
</p>
<p>criticisms that were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by Adam Smith, 
</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, or Thomas Babington Macaulay. These focused on the effects of exclusive 
</p>
<p>rights and monopolies and as such contemplated possibilities mostly from within this system. 
</p>
<p>See Boyle, &ldquo;The Second Enclosure Movement and the Construction of the Public Domain,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>p. 57. Meanwhile, contrary to what was assumed about property rights in the eighteenth or 
</p>
<p>nineteenth centuries, the A2K movement cannot count on the then commonplace view that

<p>93
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights, while they are needed, also have to be controlled, limited, and 
</p>
<p>sometimes abrogated.
</p>
<p>39 This does not mean that A2K advocates are not keen to organize the theatrical and unequiv-
</p>
<p>ocal public condemnation of corporate industries and to capitalize on these campaigns to 
</p>
<p>increase their own political power, the same way that groups from the environment move-
</p>
<p>ment do. To take only one recent example among many, consider the AIDS activist protest 
</p>
<p>campaign outside the headquarters of Roche in September 2008, &ldquo;Roche: Feasting on Our 
</p>
<p>Dead Bodies,&rdquo; depicting the pharmaceutical company as a hyena and stating in French, &ldquo;If

<p>you have a monopoly, you don&rsquo;t need to be human.&rdquo; See http://www.flickr.com/photos/

</p>
<p>We can see an evolution in the functioning of capitalism: for instance, enrichment is not 
</p>
<p>solely based on the physical appropriation of resources and the means of production and 
</p>
<p>capitalism is increasingly based on the allocation and transfer of credit, not on the produc-
</p>
<p>tion and sale of goods. (For a discussion of entrepreneurial neoliberalism and the functioning 
</p>
<p>of capitalism, see the analysis developed by Michel Feher in Vacarme, starting in Vacarme 51 
</p>
<p>[Spring 2010] and continuing in the following issues). However, at the base of this system and 
</p>
<p>in the distribution of social positions that it produces still remains the ownership of property, 
</p>
<p>be it only the potential to own: Some people are powerful in this system without materially 
</p>
<p>possessing capital in the form of property, but for many reasons, they are believed by others 
</p>
<p>to retain the capacity to do so. Of course, at the end of the day, &ldquo;rich&rdquo; people, even if they 
</p>
<p>make use of huge volumes of immaterial assets that they don&rsquo;t in fact possess, in most of the 
</p>
<p>cases also own a lot of both tangible and intangible resources. Nevertheless, ownership is 
</p>
<p>socially constructed and based on others&rsquo; perceptions.

<p>tion, and progress and the different political ranges with which they can be associated could

<p>be discussed. The French pirates, for instance, while they call for the liberation of creation,

</p>

<p>The	Emergence	of	the	A2K	Movement:	
</p>
<p>Reminiscences	and	Reflections		
</p>
<p>of	a	Developing-Country	Delegate
</p>
<p>Ahmed Abdel Latif
</p>
<p>As long as lions do not have their historian, hunting stories and tales will always be 
</p>
<p>to the glory of the hunter.
</p>
<p>&mdash;African proverb from Bernard Njonga, Le poulet de la discorde
</p>
<p>Since their emergence on the international scene, developing countries have sought 
</p>
<p>to reform and adapt global rules regulating the generation and dissemination of 
</p>
<p>knowledge to take into consideration their specific socioeconomic circumstances 
</p>
<p>and levels of development. Their participation in what is now known as the access 
</p>
<p>to knowledge (A2K) movement is part of their effort to achieve this objective.
</p>
<p> In this context, my assignment to the Permanent Mission of Egypt in Geneva 
</p>
<p>(2000&ndash;2004), which was to follow intellectual property (IP) issues, first at the 
</p>
<p>World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and then also at the World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization (WTO), led to my involvement in the formation of the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment. The following is thus an account of this process from the viewpoint of a 
</p>
<p>Geneva-based delegate of a developing country. It aims to be a contribution to the 
</p>
<p>narrative of the genesis of the A2K movement, rather than a definitive account of 
</p>
<p>a process in which many different actors, in particular academics and civil-society 
</p>
<p>activists, were also actively involved. This account focuses on developments and 
</p>
<p>initiatives that took place in Geneva-based international forums and organizations, 
</p>
<p>particularly at WIPO, that played an important structuring role in the emergence 
</p>
<p>of A2K as a movement and in the framing of A2K as a concept.
</p>
<p>global intellectual property debates: a2k in historical context  
from the perspective of developing countries
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights have become the predominant framework for regulat-
</p>
<p>ing the generation, dissemination, and use of knowledge. With the globalization </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>abdel latif100
</p>
<p>of intellectual property rights and the expansion of the scope in intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty protection, the main institutions involved in international deliberations and 
</p>
<p>rule making on intellectual property issues, particularly the WTO and WIPO, have 
</p>
<p>acquired unprecedented importance. It is thus not surprising that recent efforts by 
</p>
<p>developing countries aiming at adapting and reforming rules regulating knowledge 
</p>
<p>have been centered on these two organizations.
</p>
<p> In this regard, it is important to recall that, already in the 1960s and 1970s, 
</p>
<p>developing countries had sought to reform the main international conventions in 
</p>
<p>the area of intellectual property, such as the Berne Convention for the Protection 
</p>
<p>of Literary and Artistic Works (1886) on the protection of copyright and the Paris 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Protection of Industrial Property (1883), with a view toward 
</p>
<p>making these instruments more responsive to developing countries&rsquo; socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>needs in terms of access to educational material, scientific knowledge, and tech-
</p>
<p>nology. These attempts did not result in the expected reforms pursued by develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries and have progressively fallen into oblivion.1
</p>
<p> The conclusion of the 1994 WTO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
</p>
<p>Rights Agreement (the TRIPS Agreement) brought many of these concerns back 
</p>
<p>to the surface, because for developing countries, it represented a landmark devel-
</p>
<p>opment in the process of strengthening intellectual property rights at the global 
</p>
<p>level. TRIPS globalized new rules with an important bearing on the dissemination 
</p>
<p>of knowledge, such as the extension of patent protection to pharmaceutical prod-
</p>
<p>ucts and the protection of computer programs (software) by copyright. TRIPS also 
</p>
<p>laid down minimum standards for the enforcement of intellectual property rights, 
</p>
<p>and it came under the aegis of the WTO dispute settlement system, which could be 
</p>
<p>used in cases of noncompliance, features that were lacking in existing intellectual 
</p>
<p>property agreements under WIPO.2 A powerful discourse accompanied the conclu-
</p>
<p>sion of TRIPS, arguing that strengthened intellectual property protection in devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries would promote innovation and lead to increased flows of invest-
</p>
<p>ment and technology transfers.3
</p>
<p> Furthermore, after the adoption of TRIPS, developed countries quickly sig-
</p>
<p>naled their determination to pursue the establishment of new intellectual property 
</p>
<p>standards further, beyond the minimum standards contained in the TRIPS Agree-
</p>
<p>ment (&ldquo;TRIPS-plus&rdquo; standards).
</p>
<p> These TRIPS-plus standards promoted by developed countries resulted either 
</p>
<p>from norm-setting activities in WIPO or from intellectual property chapters in 
</p>
<p>bilateral and regional free-trade agreements,4 which often required adherence to 
</p>
<p>WIPO instruments such as the 1996 Internet Treaties. These treaties strengthened 
</p>
<p>copyright protection in the digital environment, establishing new obligations in an 
</p>
<p>area that was not specifically addressed by the TRIPS Agreement. The 1999 WIPO </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the emergence of the a2k movement 101
</p>
<p>Digital Agenda promoted adherence to these treaties in the context of efforts to 
</p>
<p>grapple with the challenges to traditional copyright protection brought by the 
</p>
<p>Internet and information and communication technologies.5 The European Union, 
</p>
<p>which had adopted a sui generis regime for the protection of nonoriginal data-
</p>
<p>bases, was pressing for the adoption of a similar regime of protection in the con-
</p>
<p>text of WIPO&rsquo;s Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.
</p>
<p> Alongside this evolving landscape, a campaign for access to medicines 
</p>
<p>emerged and gained significant momentum with the defeat of a lawsuit brought 
</p>
<p>by thirty-nine pharmaceutical companies against the South African government 
</p>
<p>in 1998, culminating with the adoption of the 2001 Doha Declaration on TRIPS and  
</p>
<p>Public Health.6
</p>
<p> For many of the actors involved in this mobilization, including developing 
</p>
<p>countries, this campaign was extremely effective in addressing the impact of the 
</p>
<p>newly globalized intellectual property standards on public health and in firmly 
</p>
<p>putting the issue of patents and access to medicines on the global agenda. It was 
</p>
<p>often cited as exemplary in the way it framed the issue, attracted public atten-
</p>
<p>tion, and forged a coalition made of developing countries (including Brazil, India, 
</p>
<p>and the African Group) and of civil-society and nongovernmental organizations 
</p>
<p>(NGOs) such as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), the Consumer Project on Tech-
</p>
<p>nology (CPTech, now Knowledge Ecology International), and the Third World Net-
</p>
<p>work, in addition to public-health grassroots organizations in developing countries 
</p>
<p>such as South Africa, Thailand, and Brazil.7
</p>
<p> During the access-to-medicines campaign, a collaboration developed between 
</p>
<p>negotiators from developing countries, particularly Geneva-based ones, and 
</p>
<p>several of the most active NGOs, which often provided these negotiators with 
</p>
<p>information, legal analysis, and technical support.8 Developing countries, on the 
</p>
<p>other hand, articulated positions that coincided with the public-policy concerns 
</p>
<p>advanced by many of these NGOs. The achievement of a more development-
</p>
<p>oriented intellectual property system that would be supportive of public health 
</p>
<p>was a common objective of both the developing countries and the NGOs repre-
</p>
<p>senting civil-society consumers and patients. This convergence of interests and 
</p>
<p>strategies was most effective in the deliberations leading to the adoption of the  
</p>
<p>Doha Declaration.
</p>
<p> In terms of its wording, the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health was 
</p>
<p>a significant development in global deliberations on intellectual property because 
</p>
<p>its formulations embodied a balanced approach to intellectual property protec-
</p>
<p>tion that contrasted with the maximalist intellectual property discourse that was 
</p>
<p>prevalent until that time. For many developing countries, this balanced and pow-
</p>
<p>erful message had a wider significance beyond the WTO, because it signaled the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>102
</p>
<p>importance of implementing intellectual property protection in a manner that is 
</p>
<p>supportive of public-policy objectives.
</p>
<p> Soon after the adoption of the Doha Declaration, the influential report of 
</p>
<p>the UK Commission on Intellectual Property Rights (CIPR) was released in Sep-
</p>
<p>tember 2002.9 The report underlined the need to achieve a more balanced inter-
</p>
<p>national intellectual property system that would not be based on a &ldquo;one size fits 
</p>
<p>all&rdquo; approach and that would take into consideration the different needs of coun-
</p>
<p>tries, as well as their different levels of development. It emphasized that &ldquo;access 
</p>
<p>to books and learning materials is still a real problem in many developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries.&rdquo;10 The report invited developing countries to improve access to copyrighted 
</p>
<p>works and to achieve their goals for education and knowledge transfer by adopting 
</p>
<p>measures fostering competition under copyright laws, as well as by maintaining 
</p>
<p>or adopting broad exemptions for educational, research, and library uses in their 
</p>
<p>national copyright laws.11
</p>
<p> The CIPR report had a significant impact in intellectual property and develop-
</p>
<p>ment circles for several reasons:12 the creation of the CIPR came at the initiative of 
</p>
<p>a developed country, the United Kingdom; the commission&rsquo;s membership included 
</p>
<p>a number of prominent experts from both developing and developed countries, 
</p>
<p>as well as representatives of industry and academia, and the commission&rsquo;s report 
</p>
<p>contained many recommendations that addressed pressing policy issues with 
</p>
<p>which most countries, particularly developing countries, were confronted in inter-
</p>
<p>national forums and processes.13
</p>
<p> More importantly, in terms of its content, the CIPR report captured very accu-
</p>
<p>rately a growing trend of opinion that distanced itself from both a maximalist dis-
</p>
<p>course that promoted the absolute benefits of intellectual property and a discourse 
</p>
<p>that was unequivocally critical of intellectual property as a matter of principle. It 
</p>
<p>thus recognized both the benefits and costs of intellectual property protection, 
</p>
<p>emphasizing the need to ensure that the costs do not outweigh the benefits, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly for developing countries.
</p>
<p> In many instances, the report echoed several of the criticisms lodged by devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries against the international intellectual property system and the 
</p>
<p>TRIPS Agreement. Furthermore, the report contained the first direct criticism of 
</p>
<p>WIPO&rsquo;s orientations to be advanced in international policy debates beyond spe-
</p>
<p>cialized circles of intellectual property scholars and NGOs.14 In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>report underlined that WIPO &ldquo;should give explicit recognition to both the benefits 
</p>
<p>and costs of IP protection&rdquo; and &ldquo;should act to integrate development objectives 
</p>
<p>into its approach to the promotion of IP protection in developing countries.&rdquo;15

<p>(International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development) of the Bellagio Dia-
</p>
<p>logues on Development and Intellectual Property Policy with the support of the 
</p>
<p>Rockefeller Foundation. These dialogues also pointed to the need to integrate the 
</p>
<p>development dimension in the setting of global intellectual property standards. 
</p>
<p>The first of these dialogues, in 2002, identified various areas of concern for efforts 
</p>
<p>directed toward achieving a more balanced and development-oriented intellectual 
</p>
<p>property system, such as dealing with the danger of the further harmonization of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights laws calibrated on the high standards being promoted 
</p>
<p>by developed countries,16 the dangers posed by the promotion of TRIPS-plus stan-
</p>
<p>dards, and the importance of building capacity for self-development in developing 
</p>
<p>countries.17 From 2002 to 2005, the Bellagio Dialogues brought together key intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property negotiators, experts, and representatives of civil society. Several of 
</p>
<p>their recommendations, which converged with those of the CIPR report, influenced 
</p>
<p>developments in global policy forums and deliberations on intellectual property.18
</p>
<p> More generally, the backlash against the &ldquo;roaring&rdquo; nineties and against the 
</p>
<p>categorical assumptions and assertions about the absolute benefits of economic 
</p>
<p>globalization was in full swing. A more nuanced discourse on globalization from 
</p>
<p>the Global North and the Global South was emerging and gaining ground on the 
</p>
<p>international scene.19
</p>
<p>from access to medicines to a2k
</p>
<p>All these developments induced a number of like-minded Geneva-based repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives of developing countries (from Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, and India) to 
</p>
<p>believe that the debate should move beyond TRIPS and public health to address 
</p>
<p>other substantive areas where global intellectual property rules had a significant 
</p>
<p>impact on public-policy objectives of importance to developing countries, such as 
</p>
<p>access to educational material and scientific knowledge. The copyright issue, for 
</p>
<p>instance, had been the sleeping giant in the debate on intellectual property in the 
</p>
<p>1990s. Concerns had appeared regarding the impact of the WIPO Internet Treaties 
</p>
<p>and the legislation implementing them&mdash;such as the U.S. Digital Millennium Copy-
</p>
<p>right Act&mdash;on access to information and fair use in the digital environment.
</p>
<p> A shared conviction emerged among them that the most effective way to mobi-
</p>
<p>lize on these issues was to replicate the elements that had proven successful in the 
</p>
<p>access-to-medicines campaign, especially the focus on careful framing of the issue 
</p>
<p>and on building a coalition that would include developing countries, as well as NGOs.
</p>
<p> However, the prospects for such a mobilization seemed uncertain in 2002. The 
</p>
<p>clusters of issues around knowledge and information lacked the emotional impact 
</p>
<p>and sense of urgency that characterized the patents-and-medicines debate. Access 
</p>
<p>the emergence of the a2k movement</p>

</p>
<p>to medicines, particularly life-saving HIV drugs, is a matter of immediate human 
</p>
<p>survival. It has a compelling humanitarian dimension that is more difficult to 
</p>
<p>establish in issues relating to knowledge and information.
</p>
<p> At the same time, many developing countries were wary of opening a new 
</p>
<p>front that could be construed as a more general contestation of the international 
</p>
<p>intellectual property system, in contrast with the more limited and pointed mobili-
</p>
<p>zation on the patents-and-medicines issue. Issue-based actions and mobilizations 
</p>
<p>were more likely to succeed, in their experience, than a frontal and systematic 
</p>
<p>opposition. Furthermore, deliberations were still taking place at the WTO on para-
</p>
<p>graph 6 of the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health concerning the situa-
</p>
<p>tion of countries that lacked manufacturing capacities in the pharma ceutical sector.
</p>
<p> With their limited capacities and expertise, many developing countries relied 
</p>
<p>on their Geneva-based representatives to articulate their positions in many techni-
</p>
<p>cal discussions relating to trade and intellectual property discussed in Geneva, and 
</p>
<p>thus it was difficult for these countries to be engaged simultaneously in in-depth 
</p>
<p>negotiations on intellectual property matters in different forums.20 In addition, 
</p>
<p>many developing countries faced coordination problems, because they often had 
</p>
<p>separate representations to the United Nations and the WTO, or even within the 
</p>
<p>same mission, different persons were assigned to follow WTO TRIPS issues and 
</p>
<p>UN agencies such as WIPO.21 With regard to NGOs, many of those involved in the 
</p>
<p>access-to-medicines campaigns continued to focus mostly on the TRIPS and pub-
</p>
<p>lic-health issue and were still devoting much of their resources and organizational 
</p>
<p>capabilities to it.22 Finally, while the WTO was clearly the forum in which to act on 
</p>
<p>the issue of patents and medicines because the TRIPS Agreement had extended 
</p>
<p>patent protection to pharmaceutical products, WIPO appeared to be the appropri-
</p>
<p>ate forum where the more general debate on the regulation of global knowledge 
</p>
<p>was to be raised, particularly in view of the new intellectual property standards 
</p>
<p>being advanced by developed countries at WIPO.
</p>
<p> Indeed, discussions were taking place at WIPO on a new treaty to protect 
</p>
<p>broadcasting organizations in the digital environment, as well as on a new treaty 
</p>
<p>to harmonize substantive patent law. WIPO&rsquo;s centrality in shaping the global intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property discourse, particularly in developing countries, was becoming 
</p>
<p>manifest, as well as its role in the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement through 
</p>
<p>its technical-assistance programs and legislative advice in the context of the 1995 
</p>
<p>WIPO-WTO agreement on technical cooperation,23 as well as the 1998 WIPO-WTO 
</p>
<p>joint initiative on technical cooperation for developing countries and the 2001 joint 
</p>
<p>initiative for least-developed countries.24
</p>
<p> At that time, WIPO was still perceived as a technical organization and was 
</p>
<p>relatively unknown to the larger public and to many activists, academics, and 
</p>
<p>abdel latif</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>105
</p>
<p>NGOs involved in intellectual property debates, which focused mostly on the 
</p>
<p>TRIPS Agreement. The majority of the recent literature on intellectual property 
</p>
<p>and development also had concentrated nearly entirely on the TRIPS Agreement 
</p>
<p>and its implications. Furthermore, there was some skepticism, including among 
</p>
<p>some experts and negotiators who had been involved in the TRIPS and public-
</p>
<p>health negotiations, regarding the possibility of bringing any significant change or 
</p>
<p>reforms to WIPO. The organization was perceived as predominantly influenced by 
</p>
<p>developed countries and owners of intellectual property-rights, particularly in the 
</p>
<p>area of norm setting, a perception reinforced by the fact that WIPO derived nearly 
</p>
<p>90 percent of its revenues from the use by the private sector of its registration sys-
</p>
<p>tems, most notably the Patent Cooperation Treaty.25
</p>
<p> As for developing countries, while they had built expertise in engaging with 
</p>
<p>WTO and TRIPS issues, their knowledge of WIPO processes remain limited, as did 
</p>
<p>their participation in the organization&rsquo;s standard-setting activities.26 The linkages 
</p>
<p>between the discussions on TRIPS at the WTO and the deliberations at WIPO were 
</p>
<p>not evident for most of them. Few developing countries were actively engaged in 
</p>
<p>both forums.27
</p>
<p>the formation of the a2k movement
</p>
<p>Some NGOs shared the views on the need to engage more actively in WIPO pro-
</p>
<p>cesses.28 CPTech was one of them. In fall of 2002 and early 2003, discussions took 
</p>
<p>place between James Love, the director of CPTech, and a number of like-minded 
</p>
<p>Geneva based delegates from developing countries on the means to pursue such 
</p>
<p>a greater engagement. Love subsequently played an important role in providing 
</p>
<p>much-needed links between developing countries, civil-society groups, and aca-
</p>
<p>demia based in the North, particularly in the United States, which had been mobi-
</p>
<p>lized for a number of years on domestic issues relating to copyright, knowledge, 
</p>
<p>and information, in particular in the context of the implementation of the Digital 
</p>
<p>Millennium Copyright Act. CPTech started increasingly to focus its advocacy on 
</p>
<p>WIPO&rsquo;s mission and role in order to raise public interest in its activities and its 
</p>
<p>approach to intellectual property protection. An important stage was set for the 
</p>
<p>coming together of the forces behind the A2K movement.
</p>
<p>the world summit on the information society
</p>
<p>However, there was still the need for opportunities that would act as a catalyst in 
</p>
<p>forging a new coalition on the regulation of knowledge. One of them came inad-
</p>
<p>vertently in the form of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).
</p>
<p> In 2001, the United Nations General Assembly approved a proposal by the 
</p>
<p>the emergence of the a2k movement</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>106
</p>
<p>International Telecommunications Union to hold the WSIS in two parts: the first 
</p>
<p>part in Geneva in December 2003, and the second part in Tunisia in November 
</p>
<p>2005. The objective of the summit was to discuss the new challenges and oppor-
</p>
<p>tunities created by the digital revolution and the role of information and com-
</p>
<p>munication technologies in improving living standards, achieving the UN Millen-
</p>
<p>nium Development Goals,29 and bridging the digital divide between countries and 
</p>
<p>within societies.30
</p>
<p> The Geneva phase of the summit aimed at formulating the political vision to build 
</p>
<p>the information society and the practical steps to achieve this objective. The Prepa-
</p>
<p>ratory Committee convened on three occasions in preparation of this first phase (in 
</p>
<p>July 2002, in February 2003, and in September, November, and December 2003).
</p>
<p> A number of controversial issues started to appear in the deliberations of the 
</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee, such as the role of the media, freedom of expression, 
</p>
<p>Internet governance, and financing. After the February 2003 meeting, intellectual 
</p>
<p>property also emerged as one of the divisive issues in the deliberations. Delegates 
</p>
<p>with expertise in information and communication technologies who had been 
</p>
<p>mostly representing developing countries in these meetings were ill-equipped to 
</p>
<p>handle such controversial matters. This prompted the more active involvement of 
</p>
<p>a number of Geneva-based missions from developing countries in the negotiations, 
</p>
<p>particularly on intellectual property issues.
</p>
<p> During the negotiations, developed countries and the private sector insisted 
</p>
<p>that intellectual property protection is &ldquo;essential in the Information Society&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;existing IP regimes and international agreements should continuously pro-
</p>
<p>vide this protection . . . thus promoting the necessary balance between owners 
</p>
<p>and users of IP.&rdquo;31 On the contrary, developing countries and many NGOs stressed 
</p>
<p>that the continuous expansion in intellectual property protection could negatively 
</p>
<p>affect creativity and the dissemination of information. In addition, they opposed 
</p>
<p>the inclusion of language that claimed that international intellectual property 
</p>
<p>agreements were &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; or &ldquo;promoting the necessary balance,&rdquo; particularly in 
</p>
<p>view of the numerous criticisms made at the TRIPS Agreement discussions in this 
</p>
<p>respect. After long and tortuous negotiations, a paragraph on intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty that represented a compromise formulation was included in the WSIS Geneva 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Principles, the political declaration adopted by the summit. It states 
</p>
<p>that: &ldquo;IP protection is important to encourage innovation and creativity in the 
</p>
<p>Information Society; similarly, the wide dissemination, diffusion, and sharing of 
</p>
<p>knowledge is important to encourage innovation and creativity. Facilitating mean-
</p>
<p>ingful participation by all in intellectual property issues and knowledge sharing 
</p>
<p>through full awareness and capacity building is a fundamental part of an inclusive 
</p>
<p>Information Society.&rdquo;32
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>107
</p>
<p> Intellectual property protection thus is described in this paragraph only as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;important&rdquo; in the information society, and not as &ldquo;essential,&rdquo; as first advocated 
</p>
<p>by the developed countries and the private sector. In addition, placing intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property protection and the dissemination of knowledge on an equal footing 
</p>
<p>implied, from the view point of the developing countries and the NGOs, that intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property protection might not always necessarily achieve the dissemina-
</p>
<p>tion of knowledge, particularly if it is not balanced and supportive of public-policy 
</p>
<p>objectives.
</p>
<p> As it is usually the case on intellectual property matters, Brazil was the most 
</p>
<p>active developing country in these negotiations, particularly regarding the word-
</p>
<p>ing of the first sentence of the paragraph, where intellectual property and the 
</p>
<p>dissemination of knowledge were placed on an equal standing. African countries 
</p>
<p>were insistent on the references to participation and capacity building in the sec-
</p>
<p>ond sentence of the paragraph.
</p>
<p> Apart from the issue of intellectual property, developing countries and many 
</p>
<p>NGOs were also keen to raise the larger issue of access to information and knowl-
</p>
<p>edge in the context of the world summit.33 Ultimately, this issue was included in 
</p>
<p>the WSIS Geneva Declaration in the section on principles governing the informa-
</p>
<p>tion society under the title &ldquo;Access to information and knowledge.&rdquo; This was the 
</p>
<p>first time, to my knowledge, that the terms &ldquo;access to information and knowl-
</p>
<p>edge&rdquo; appeared in official UN documents as the result of negotiations between 
</p>
<p>governments.
</p>
<p> In this regard, the WSIS Geneva Declaration states that the &ldquo;sharing and 
</p>
<p>strengthening of global knowledge for development can be enhanced by remov-
</p>
<p>ing barriers to equitable access to information . . . and by facilitating access to pub-
</p>
<p>lic domain information&rdquo; (paragraph 25). The declaration further highlights that &ldquo;a 
</p>
<p>rich public domain is an essential element for the growth of the Information Soci-
</p>
<p>ety&rdquo; (paragraph 26). It mentions that &ldquo;access to information and knowledge can 
</p>
<p>be promoted by increasing awareness among all stakeholders of the possibilities 
</p>
<p>offered by different software models, including proprietary, open-source and free 
</p>
<p>software&rdquo; (paragraph 27). It also aspires to &ldquo;promote universal access with equal 
</p>
<p>opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of 
</p>
<p>scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific 
</p>
<p>publishing&rdquo; (paragraph 28).
</p>
<p> Retrospectively, the WSIS appeared as a landmark development for the emerg-
</p>
<p>ing A2K movement, because the movement succeeded, for the first time, in includ-
</p>
<p>ing A2K concerns in a major policy document that was endorsed by heads of state 
</p>
<p>and governments. The references to the role of the public domain as a necessary 
</p>
<p>element for the growth of the information society, to the importance of raising 
</p>
<p>the emergence of the a2k movement</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>108
</p>
<p>awareness about the possibilities offered by different models of software, includ-
</p>
<p>ing free and open-source software, and to open-access initiatives in the area of 
</p>
<p>scientific publication were groundbreaking from this perspective. These same ele-
</p>
<p>ments would later be raised by developing countries and NGOs in WIPO.
</p>
<p> The WSIS discussions reinforced the conviction of those in the nascent A2K 
</p>
<p>movement that multilateral deliberations represented the most appropriate venue 
</p>
<p>for them to reach relatively balanced formulations and views on intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty protection. Indeed, the multilateral setting provides developing countries 
</p>
<p>with an equal opportunity to put forward their positions and points of view and 
</p>
<p>to shape outcomes, in contrast, for instance, with bilateral or plurilateral processes 
</p>
<p>such as the negotiation of free-trade agreements, where they are often faced with 
</p>
<p>the overwhelming weight of developed countries, particularly in the economic and 
</p>
<p>trade areas.
</p>
<p>engaging wipo
</p>
<p>In this regard, another event occurred in 2003 that was important in the formative 
</p>
<p>stage of the A2K movement. A group of prominent public figures, scientists, and 
</p>
<p>academics, including Nobel Prize winners Joseph Stiglitz, Sir John Sulston, and 
</p>
<p>Harold Varmus, addressed an open letter to the director general of WIPO in July 
</p>
<p>2003 requesting him to convene a meeting in 2004 to examine new open, collabora-
</p>
<p>tive development models such as the Humane Genome Project and open academic 
</p>
<p>and scientific journals. The letter stated that &ldquo;these models provided evidence that 
</p>
<p>one can achieve a high level of innovation in some areas of the modern economy 
</p>
<p>without intellectual property protection, and indeed [that] excessive, unbalanced, 
</p>
<p>or poorly designed intellectual property protections may be counter-productive.&rdquo;34
</p>
<p> Commenting on the matter, a U.S. official was quoted in the media affirming 
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;open-source software runs counter to the mission of WIPO, which is to pro-
</p>
<p>mote intellectual property rights,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;to hold a meeting which has as its 
</p>
<p>purpose to disclaim or waive such rights seems to us to be contrary to the goals of 
</p>
<p>WIPO.&rdquo;35 This comment triggered a strong reaction in the United States, particu-
</p>
<p>larly among academics and civil-society groups, because many open-source col-
</p>
<p>laborative models use copyright. However, the incident equally shed light on the 
</p>
<p>narrow manner in which WIPO&rsquo;s mandate was construed by its single most influ-
</p>
<p>ential member and the implications this carried for the organization&rsquo;s activities and 
</p>
<p>its approach to intellectual property, which it seemed to consider an end in itself, 
</p>
<p>rather than a means to achieve the public-policy goals of the generation and dis-
</p>
<p>semination of knowledge.
</p>
<p> Shortly after, a meeting with the title &ldquo;WIPO&rsquo;s Work Programme and How 
</p>
<p>to Involve Consumers&rdquo; was organized by the Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue 
</p>
<p>abdel latif</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>109
</p>
<p>Special Group on Intellectual Property, in Lisbon in October 2003.36 I was the only 
</p>
<p>Geneva-based developing-country delegate participating in this meeting. The 
</p>
<p>meeting was the first of its kind in recent years to address WIPO&rsquo;s mandate and 
</p>
<p>activities from the perspective of NGOs and consumers. Although this meeting 
</p>
<p>did not attract the same media coverage as the letter previously mentioned, it sig-
</p>
<p>naled that WIPO&rsquo;s activities and its narrow approach to intellectual property were 
</p>
<p>beginning to become the subject of increased attention by civil-society groups  
</p>
<p>and NGOs.
</p>
<p> As a further reflection of this evolution, the first policy paper focusing exclu-
</p>
<p>sively on WIPO was published in 2003 by the Quaker United Nations Office in 
</p>
<p>Geneva and the Quakers International Affairs Programme, based in Canada.37 The 
</p>
<p>paper developed a number of views, building on the CIPR report and arguing that 
</p>
<p>WIPO&rsquo;s mandate should not be narrowly limited to the &ldquo;promotion of IP,&rdquo; as stated 
</p>
<p>in the 1967 Stockholm Convention establishing it, but should be properly con-
</p>
<p>strued in the context of the 1974 agreement with the UN by virtue of which WIPO 
</p>
<p>became a UN specialized agency. Under Article 1 of that agreement, the &ldquo;UN recog-
</p>
<p>nized WIPO as its specialized agency with the responsibility for taking appropriate 
</p>
<p>action in accordance with its basic instrument . . . to promote creative intellectual 
</p>
<p>activity&rdquo;&mdash;not intellectual property. The paper also emphasized that WIPO, as a 
</p>
<p>UN agency, should fully integrate and mainstream the development dimension 
</p>
<p>into its activities, as was done in the rest of the UN system.
</p>
<p> In September 2003, the second UNCTAD-ICTSD Bellagio Dialogue on Develop-
</p>
<p>ment and Intellectual Property Policy identified a number of priority areas for the 
</p>
<p>reformist intellectual property agenda, with a specific mention of one of WIPO&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>initiatives, the WIPO Patent Agenda.38 It thus referred to &ldquo;challenging the insti-
</p>
<p>tutional framework in which intellectual property policy is developed . . . including 
</p>
<p>opposition to moves to harmonize the patent regime, such as through WIPO&rsquo;s Pat-
</p>
<p>ent Agenda.&rdquo; The meeting also addressed important priorities of the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment, such as &ldquo;supporting the consideration and development of complementary 
</p>
<p>open models for promoting innovation and affordable access to technologies in 
</p>
<p>developing countries, including open source and other collaborative approaches.&rdquo;39
</p>
<p>	 By the end of 2003, NGOs and civil-society groups had begun to participate 
more actively in WIPO meetings. Until then, NGO representation in these meet-
</p>
<p>ings was almost exclusively limited to representatives of rights holders&rsquo; organi-
</p>
<p>zations that, in general, favored an increase in the levels of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>protection standards. Public-interest NGOs and civil-society groups had been vir-
</p>
<p>tually absent from WIPO deliberations.
</p>
<p> This period also witnessed an increased participation of developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries in WIPO&rsquo;s norm-setting discussions. The South Centre contributed to this 
</p>
<p>the emergence of the a2k movement</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>110
</p>
<p>process when, beginning in 2002, it started to support developing countries in 
</p>
<p>enhancing their participation in WIPO&rsquo;s activities and in coordinating their posi-
</p>
<p>tions.40 It did so by convening meetings where developing countries could pre-
</p>
<p>pare in advance for WIPO meetings and by providing analytical notes that high-
</p>
<p>lighted the development and public-policy implications of WIPO&rsquo;s deliberations, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the area of standard setting, such as on patent harmonization  
</p>
<p>and copyright.
</p>
<p> After the Lisbon meeting in 2003, the Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD) 
</p>
<p>convened another meeting, &ldquo;Global Access to Essential Learning Tools,&rdquo; in April 
</p>
<p>2004 in New York.41 The meeting included panels on access to textbooks, academic 
</p>
<p>journals, and distance education and software.
</p>
<p> I was invited to participate in this meeting, where I moderated the panel on 
</p>
<p>access to textbooks. At that time, apart from being the Egyptian delegate to WIPO, 
</p>
<p>I was coordinating the work of the African Group at WIPO, given that since Janu-
</p>
<p>ary 2004, Egypt had assumed this responsibility, which rotates between the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the group. This task involved presenting the positions of the African Group 
</p>
<p>regarding issues discussed at WIPO. It also entailed assisting the group in building 
</p>
<p>common positions, taking into consideration differences of views that might arise 
</p>
<p>between countries in the group.
</p>
<p>the genesis of the term &ldquo;a2k&rdquo; and the framing of a2k as a concept
</p>
<p>At the New York meeting, a side meeting on strategy took place that brought 
</p>
<p>together key actors that had been active since 2003 in the WSIS and WIPO pro-
</p>
<p>cesses. While it was clear that a coalition was emerging on a number of issues 
</p>
<p>relating to access to knowledge and information, the coalition still lacked a clear 
</p>
<p>and distinctive identity. It had a fragmented constituency that was made up of a 
</p>
<p>number of disparate groups with a focus on very specific issues that at first glance 
</p>
<p>appeared to be not very much related to each other. These groups included oppo-
</p>
<p>nents of greater protection for databases, advocacy groups promoting free and

<p>open-source software, groups advocating open-access initiatives in the area of sci-
</p>
<p>entific research journals, plus librarians, consumer organizations, and the visually 
</p>
<p>impaired promoting greater use of exceptions and limitations to copyright, as well 
</p>
<p>as groups promoting the public domain. In addition, a number of developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries such as Brazil, India, Egypt, and South Africa were sympathetic to all or some 
</p>
<p>of the demands advanced by these groups.
</p>
<p> A conceptual framework was lacking to bring all these groups and issues 
</p>
<p>together under a single banner. There was agreement among these actors that the 
</p>
<p>issue of access was central and common in all their efforts and activities. Then the 
</p>
<p>question arose: Access to what?
</p>
<p>abdel latif</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>111
</p>
<p> Several recurrent terms were discussed at the New York meeting, such as access 
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;information.&rdquo; On my part, I made a strong plea for the exclusive use of the term 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo; instead, for several reasons.
</p>
<p> First, at the conceptual level, knowledge, rather than information, is at the heart 
</p>
<p>of the empowerment of individuals and societies. While information is certainly 
</p>
<p>a prerequisite in the generation of knowledge, acquisition of knowledge remains 
</p>
<p>the ultimate goal. Knowledge processes information to produce ideas, analysis, and 
</p>
<p>skills that ideally should contribute to human progress and civilization.
</p>
<p> Second, &ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo; appeared as the appropriate response to the 
</p>
<p>term &ldquo;knowledge economy&rdquo; that had been increasingly used, since the end of 
</p>
<p>the 1990s, to describe the new, prevailing paradigm that reflected the changes in 
</p>
<p>the global economy brought about by globalization and new technologies. Often 
</p>
<p>this term was used to promote an expansion in the scope of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights and to increase the levels of intellectual property protection. Thus, if the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;knowledge economy&rdquo; was the new paradigm in the global allocation of wealth 
</p>
<p>and resources, then &ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo; became the indispensable other side 
</p>
<p>of the coin in order to make the economic globalization process underpinning the 
</p>
<p>knowledge economy inclusive and equitable.
</p>
<p> Third, for tactical considerations, I was concerned that the use of the term &ldquo;infor-
</p>
<p>mation&rdquo; would be strictly associated with the deliberations of the WSIS process and 
</p>
<p>potentially could engulf the emerging coalition in the myriad controversial issues 
</p>
<p>that had plagued the WSIS process, such as human rights (freedom of expression), 
</p>
<p>media regulation, and privacy. While these issues are close to the concerns of the 
</p>
<p>emerging A2K movement, they were not to be, in my opinion, the main focus of the 
</p>
<p>advocacy efforts of the movement, because there were many other groups and com-
</p>
<p>munities, in particular human rights groups, that were mobilized around them. This 
</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that the human rights dimension is not important in the framing of 
</p>
<p>A2K. On the contrary, it is imperative to root the A2K concept deeper in the human 
</p>
<p>rights regime and discourse, particularly in relation to economic and social rights 
</p>
<p>such as the right to health,42 the right to education,43 and the &ldquo;right to take part in 
</p>
<p>cultural life and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications.&rdquo;44
</p>
<p> Finally, the term &ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo; possesses a universal appeal and legit-
</p>
<p>imacy that is powerful. While there might be differences about how to achieve 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge, the goal would be difficult to oppose in itself. It embodies 
</p>
<p>a positive agenda and is not only a &ldquo;reaction&rdquo; to trends in expanding intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property protection that the world had witnessed since the 1990s. This was a  
</p>
<p>central consideration.
</p>
<p> Indeed, previous efforts by developing countries to reform the intellectual 
</p>
<p>property system had confronted it in a frontal manner, tried to act mainly from 
</p>
<p>the emergence of the a2k movement</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>112
</p>
<p>within the intellectual property system itself, and were ultimately overtaken by 
</p>
<p>the ability of the system to maintain the status quo. This had to be avoided. On 
</p>
<p>the contrary, it was vital that the emerging A2K movement did not define itself 
</p>
<p>exclusively in relation&mdash;and even less in opposition&mdash;to the intellectual property 
</p>
<p>system, but rather that it would work at building a public-policy objective, such 
</p>
<p>as had occurred in the case of public health, that the intellectual property system 
</p>
<p>could be made to support. The rationale for this was reinforced by the fact that 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge is a cross-sectoral issue by its very nature and affects many 
</p>
<p>areas, such as science, education, research, and many other public-policy areas. 
</p>
<p>Thus, it was important for the A2K movement to expand into the policy debates 
</p>
<p>in relation to knowledge, education, science, and research, rather than become 
</p>
<p>immediately and exclusively engulfed in the technical discussions of the intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property system.
</p>
<p> These considerations in relation to intellectual property were also central 
</p>
<p>for the inclusiveness of the movement and its capacity to reach different stake-
</p>
<p>holders, including, for instance, the private sector. It was clear from issues such 
</p>
<p>as increased protection for databases, infringement liability for Internet service 
</p>
<p>providers, and the digitalization of books that there was an important part of the 
</p>
<p>technology industry, particularly in the United States, that shared some of the 
</p>
<p>concerns of the A2K movement and that supported some of its proposals&mdash;on 
</p>
<p>open standards, for instance.
</p>
<p> However, beyond this initial framing of the A2K concept, its vitality was to be 
</p>
<p>reflected in the extent to which other actors from academia, civil-society groups, 
</p>
<p>and governments would participate in its further elaboration and development, 
</p>
<p>thus ultimately participating in its wider ownership and diffusion, as well.45 The 
</p>
<p>conceptualization of A2K would remain a work in progress, and the contours of its 
</p>
<p>agenda should continue to evolve and adapt to the challenges raised by the issues 
</p>
<p>in the globalization of knowledge.
</p>
<p> Shortly after my plea for the term &ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo; at the New York TACD 
</p>
<p>meeting, the term became increasingly used as the single rallying cry of the move-
</p>
<p>ment. James Love then came up with the term &ldquo;A2K&rdquo; as a short brand name, which 
</p>
<p>became central in the movement&rsquo;s advocacy efforts.
</p>
<p>the wipo development agenda
</p>
<p>By mid-2004, it was clear that the momentum for seeking change in WIPO was 
</p>
<p>gaining strength. NGOs were becoming increasingly active, particularly in the con-
</p>
<p>text of WIPO discussions on the broadcasting treaty. Developing-country partici-
</p>
<p>pation in WIPO&rsquo;s substantive debates had also increased significantly, particularly 
</p>
<p>in relation to the proposed Substantive Patent Law Treaty, which raised a number 
</p>
<p>abdel latif</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>113
</p>
<p>of concerns for developing countries in terms of its impact on the flexibilities they 
</p>
<p>enjoyed under the TRIPS Agreement.46
</p>
<p> However, it became increasingly apparent for a number of like-minded repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives of developing countries active in WIPO discussions that all these efforts 
</p>
<p>remained fragmented. They started to realize that only a major policy initiative could 
</p>
<p>bring change to WIPO and advance all these dispersed efforts. Such an initiative would 
</p>
<p>go beyond these efforts to address specific standard-setting proposals for increased 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protection being advanced at the organization. It would address 
</p>
<p>in a systematic and comprehensive manner the organization&rsquo;s culture in promoting 
</p>
<p>intellectual property, particularly in the areas of norm setting and technical assistance.
</p>
<p> On a substantive level, the initiative would seek to include many of the pro-
</p>
<p>posals and recommendations that had been put forward on WIPO since 2002, in 
</p>
<p>particular, the CIPR report and the outcomes of the UNCTAD-ICTSD Bellagio Dia-
</p>
<p>logues, this in addition to bringing to WIPO the global debate over ideas about 
</p>
<p>intellectual property that was taking place outside of it and in which the A2K 
</p>
<p>coalition had become an important actor.
</p>
<p> On a procedural level, the initiative was also motivated by the desire to estab-
</p>
<p>lish, for the first time in a long time, a grouping of like-minded representatives 
</p>
<p>of developing countries at WIPO who shared the same perspective on intellectual 
</p>
<p>property, rather than simply just belonging to the same geographical group.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>114
</p>
<p> Indeed, the initiative relied on geographical groups to steer the work of the 
</p>
<p>organization in procedural and substantive matters. However, while these groups 
</p>
<p>might be useful in a number of procedural matters, such as allocating the member-
</p>
<p>ship of bodies or electing officials or committee chairs, reliance on them in substan-
</p>
<p>tive matters often made less sense, because in many cases, countries within the 
</p>
<p>same group had significantly diverging views on intellectual property.47 Indeed, 
</p>
<p>it could be problematic for countries to reach common positions on substantive 
</p>
<p>intellectual property negotiations at the international level if their national intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property laws differed significantly and did not grant the same level of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protection. This is the case, for example, in Latin and Central 
</p>
<p>America, where the gap is particularly acute, for instance between countries that 
</p>
<p>have adopted TRIPS-plus standards as a result of free-trade agreements concluded 
</p>
<p>with developed countries such as the United States and other countries that have 
</p>
<p>refrained from entering in such agreements. While the practice of having repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives of like-minded groups of developing countries coordinating on specific 
</p>
<p>issues was current practice in the WTO TRIPS context, it was not the case at WIPO.
</p>
<p> On their part, civil-society groups had done significant work since 2002 in pre-
</p>
<p>paring the ground through increased advocacy aimed at bringing WIPO into the 
</p>
<p>wider public-policy debate.
</p>
<p> The time was thus ripe for bringing such a new initiative forward. At the end 
</p>
<p>of August 2004, Brazil and Argentina circulated the proposal for a development 
</p>
<p>agenda for WIPO. Egypt joined them, with a group of other countries, to present 
</p>
<p>this proposal at the session of the WIPO Assemblies in late September.48 Egypt&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>adherence to this initiative came in continuity with its important contribution to 
</p>
<p>efforts by developing countries to achieve a more development-friendly interna-
</p>
<p>tional trade and intellectual property system.
</p>
<p> Indeed, in the 1980s, Egypt was among the developing countries that resisted 
</p>
<p>the inclusion of intellectual property issues in the Uruguay Round of the General 
</p>
<p>Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. During the round itself, in 1990, it joined a num-
</p>
<p>ber of developing countries such as Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Argentina, 
</p>
<p>Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Cuba, Egypt, Nigeria, Peru, Tanzania, and Uruguay 
</p>
<p>in submitting a developing-countries draft text for the intellectual property agree-
</p>
<p>ment that was under negotiation.49
</p>
<p> Egypt was also among the developing countries that availed themselves of 
</p>
<p>the possibility to use the Appendix of the Berne Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Literary and Artistic Works (1971 Paris version), which provided&mdash;subject to just 
</p>
<p>compensation to the rightful owner&mdash;&ldquo;for the possibility of granting non-exclu-
</p>
<p>sive and non-transferable compulsory licensing in respect of (i) translation for 
</p>
<p>the purpose of teaching, scholarship or research, and (ii) reproduction for use in

</p>
<p>connection with systematic instructional activities, of works protected under the 
</p>
<p>Convention.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>	 In its national legislation implementing the TRIPS Agreement (Law 83 of 2002), 
Egypt had incorporated many of the public-health-related flexibilities of the 
</p>
<p>agreement. And while it has concluded a number of free-trade agreements, such 
</p>
<p>as the EU-Egypt Association Agreement and the EU-EFTA Agreement, it has suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded to a great extent in avoiding taking on new, extensive TRIPS-plus obliga-
</p>
<p>tions with a bearing on public-policy objectives such as public health.
</p>
<p>a2k and the wipo development agenda
</p>
<p>Although the WIPO Development Agenda initiative was not only about A2K, 
</p>
<p>A2K-related issues were clearly an important component of the proposals and 
</p>
<p>ideas that the initiative was seeking to advance. This was reflected in the original 
</p>
<p>document containing the development agenda proposal, which included key ele-
</p>
<p>ments and concerns of the A2K movement such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; An indication that adding new layers of intellectual property protection to the 
</p>
<p>digital environment would obstruct the free flow of information and scuttle 
</p>
<p>efforts to set up new arrangements for promoting innovation and creativity 
</p>
<p>through initiatives such as the &ldquo;Creative Commons.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; An expression of concern at the ongoing controversy surrounding the use of 
</p>
<p>technological protection measures in the digital environment.
</p>
<p>&bull; A reference to the importance of safeguarding the exceptions and limitations 
</p>
<p>existing in the domestic laws of member states.
</p>
<p>&bull; A mention of the need to bear in mind the relevance of open-access models for 
</p>
<p>the promotion of innovation and creativity in order to tap into the develop-
</p>
<p>ment potential offered by the digital environment and an invitation to WIPO to 
</p>
<p>consider undertaking activities with a view toward exploring the promise held 
</p>
<p>by open, collaborative projects to develop public goods, as exemplified by the 
</p>
<p>Human Genome Project and open-source software.
</p>
<p>&bull; A reference to the need to examine the potential development implications of 
</p>
<p>several of the provisions of the proposed Treaty on the Protection of Broad-
</p>
<p>casting Organizations that the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related 
</p>
<p>Rights was currently discussing, taking into consideration the interests of con-
</p>
<p>sumers and of the public at large.50
</p>
<p> Before the WIPO Assemblies started, the A2K movement mobilized support 
</p>
<p>for this initiative. The South Centre published an analytical note emphasizing the 
</p>
<p>need to integrate development into WIPO activities and processes, thus supporting 
</p>
<p>the rationale for such an initiative.51

</p>
<p> The TACD convened a &ldquo;Future of WIPO&rdquo; meeting in mid-September of 2004 
</p>
<p>in Geneva. The meeting included a number of prominent figures who had been at 
</p>
<p>the forefront of efforts for a more balanced intellectual property system, particu-
</p>
<p>larly in the United States and the United Kingdom, such as Larry Lessig, Yochai 
</p>
<p>Benkler, James Boyle, John Sulston, and Tim Hubbard. It also included leading 
</p>
<p>activists such as Martin Khor and Richard Stallman. A Geneva-based delegate 
</p>
<p>from Argentina also spoke at the meeting. A &ldquo;Geneva Declaration on the Future of 
</p>
<p>WIPO&rdquo; was shortly launched, signed by leading figures from academia, NGOs, and  
</p>
<p>civil society.
</p>
<p> Of course, it was no coincidence that this meeting was held a few days 
</p>
<p>before the WIPO Assemblies, which would examine the proposal for a develop-
</p>
<p>ment agenda. It reflected once more the close collaboration between developing  
</p>
<p>countries and a number of NGOs that had become active in WIPO processes  
</p>
<p>since 2003.
</p>
<p> The few developing-country Geneva delegates who had been actively involved 
</p>
<p>in efforts leading to the launch of the WIPO Development Agenda,52 including this 
</p>
<p>author, were convinced that such an initiative on the part of developing countries 
</p>
<p>in WIPO would have limited chances of success if it was not supported by civil-
</p>
<p>society groups from the North, which were capable of mobilizing public opinion 
</p>
<p>and the media through their networks and advocacy in a manner that would have 
</p>
<p>an impact in developed countries. At the same time, NGOs that had identified the 
</p>
<p>reform of WIPO as a central part of their advocacy to achieve a more balanced 
</p>
<p>and consumer-friendly intellectual property system saw in the WIPO Development 
</p>
<p>Agenda a vehicle for moving forward their efforts in this area.
</p>
<p> Consequently, in the same way that the original proposal for a development 
</p>
<p>agenda incorporated key elements of the A2K agenda that were important to 
</p>
<p>many NGOs and developing countries, the Geneva Declaration on the Future of the 
</p>
<p>World Intellectual Property Organization lent its support to the WIPO Develop-
</p>
<p>ment Agenda proposal, stating that it &ldquo;pointed in the right direction&rdquo; and &ldquo;created 
</p>
<p>the first real opportunity to debate the future of WIPO.&rdquo;53 Furthermore, it also 
</p>
<p>addressed issues that primarily concerned developing countries, such as the call 
</p>
<p>for a fundamental reform of WIPO&rsquo;s technical assistance programs so as to enable 
</p>
<p>developing countries to use to the full the flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement to 
</p>
<p>promote access to medicines for all.54
</p>
<p> The presence of NGOs from the South in these developments was weaker in 
</p>
<p>comparison with that of the NGOs and civil-society groups from the North.55 How-
</p>
<p>ever, this came as no surprise. Many groups in the South that are mobilized on 
</p>
<p>issues of the environment, human rights, public health, and poverty alleviation 
</p>
<p>were not that engaged or familiar with global debates on access to and ownership 
</p>
<p>abdel latif</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>117
</p>
<p>of knowledge and even less so had means to mobilize around them. The notable 
</p>
<p>exception was the Third World Network which was actively engaged in support of 
</p>
<p>the WIPO Development Agenda through its advocacy efforts.56
</p>
<p> It was also only natural that groups from the North had more experience in 
</p>
<p>dealing with some of the issues of concern to the A2K movement, such as tech-
</p>
<p>nological protection measures in the digital environment in view of the more 
</p>
<p>advanced digital economies and legislations in developed countries. However, their 
</p>
<p>experiences in this area were also useful for developing countries that were faced 
</p>
<p>with obligations in this area through free-trade agreements or as a result of adher-
</p>
<p>ence to the WIPO Internet Treaties.
</p>
<p> Thus, both the WIPO Development Agenda process and the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>brought together developing countries, consumer-based civil-society groups, and 
</p>
<p>NGOs, particularly from the North, in a mutually beneficial collaboration. This, of 
</p>
<p>course, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the importance for each one of them of their 
</p>
<p>shared priorities is the same.
</p>
<p> In this regard, the A2K concept could be compared to a coin. On one face, we 
</p>
<p>find the &ldquo;A2K for development&rdquo; concerns of developing countries that seek flex-
</p>
<p>ibilities in intellectual property rules, while on the other, there are the &ldquo;A2K for 
</p>
<p>innovation and creativity&rdquo; priorities lying beyond the traditional intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty system, in which consumers and NGOs are faced with high intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty standards in developed countries. Both are mutually relevant and important 
</p>
<p>for each other, but each has a different emphasis. For instance, exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations for educational purposes might be of greater importance to develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries, given their vast educational needs. On the other hand, alternative 
</p>
<p>innovation models and open collaborative projects, whose role and impact are 
</p>
<p>still limited in developing countries, are more likely to be an immediate priority 
</p>
<p>for consumer organizations in developed countries that seek alternatives to pro-
</p>
<p>prietary models of knowledge generation. There is thus a constant balance to be 
</p>
<p>maintained within the A2K movement between these two faces of the coin. There 
</p>
<p>is no doubt however, that both developing countries and NGOs, respectively as 
</p>
<p>predominantly importers and consumers of knowledge goods, share the goal of 
</p>
<p>achieving more balanced intellectual property and information and communica-
</p>
<p>tion technology regimes that enable greater access to knowledge.
</p>
<p>	 After the launch of the WIPO Development Agenda, CPTech organized two 
meetings in 2005 on the A2K treaty proposal, the first with the Third World Net-
</p>
<p>work and the International Federation of Library Associations, and the second 
</p>
<p>with the TACD. By May 2005, the current draft A2K treaty was completed.57 Thus, 
</p>
<p>by 2005, the A2K movement was fully formed and had come forward with a major 
</p>
<p>norm-setting proposal, the draft A2K treaty.

</p>
<p> By that time, I had left Geneva and had returned to Cairo to assume new pro-
</p>
<p>fessional obligations. I was struck upon my return to Egypt by the extent to which 
</p>
<p>A2K and the WIPO Development Agenda, as well as the debates underpinning 
</p>
<p>them, had remained confined to a number of specialized circles following intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property issues and to the Geneva multilateral setting. Important efforts 
</p>
<p>needed to be made, particularly in the area of raising awareness, to bring a more 
</p>
<p>extensive awareness of these debates to developing countries.
</p>
<p> In this regard, a Regional Arab Dialogue on intellectual property and sustain-
</p>
<p>able development was organized by the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, ICTSD and UNC-
</p>
<p>TAD in June 2005.58 As a follow-up to one of the recommendations of this dialogue, 
</p>
<p>the Bibliotheca Alexandrina organized a regional seminar entitled &ldquo;New Tools for 
</p>
<p>the Dissemination of Knowledge and the Promotion of Creativity and Innovation: 
</p>
<p>Global Developments and Regional Challenges&rdquo; on September 7 and 8, 2006.59 This 
</p>
<p>regional seminar adopted a number of recommendations to promote A2K in the 
</p>
<p>Arab world, such as raising awareness about open collaboration and new tools for 
</p>
<p>the dissemination of knowledge (the Creative Commons, open academic and scien-
</p>
<p>tific journals, and so on) and establishing a regional research agenda.60
</p>
<p>future directions for the a2k movement
</p>
<p>While the emergence of the A2K movement involved a number of groups engaged 
</p>
<p>in intellectual property debates, mostly in the North, as well as developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries at the multilateral level in Geneva, the future growth and consolidation of the 
</p>
<p>movement lies in its capacity to mobilize interest and support in the South, partic-
</p>
<p>ularly among governments, civil-society groups, and academia. This is a long-term 
</p>
<p>strategic priority for the A2K movement. It is thus imperative to continue raising 
</p>
<p>awareness about the importance of A2K issues for developing countries and in 
</p>
<p>developing countries.
</p>
<p> In this regard, it is important to clarify that access to knowledge is not the 
</p>
<p>antithesis of intellectual property. Developing countries can combine balanced 
</p>
<p>intellectual property policies where they use creatively both intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty and open business models in some areas (such as in the creative industries) 
</p>
<p>while also pursuing overall A2K policies and measures to address their vast edu-
</p>
<p>cational needs and requirements for building scientific and technological capa-
</p>
<p>bilities. Many policies relevant to knowledge pursued by developing countries at 
</p>
<p>the national level, such as in the areas of education, culture, intellectual property 
</p>
<p>and information and communication technologies, and science and technology in  
</p>
<p>general, could be framed and conceptualized in the context of the overall A2K 
</p>
<p>paradigm and its objectives.

</p>
<p> At the international level, there is still much that can be done in terms of 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming A2K in policy positions adopted by developing countries in inter-
</p>
<p>national forums, as well as in the diverse groupings to which they belong.61 
</p>
<p>Another pressing priority for the A2K movement at this level is to have a con-
</p>
<p>crete impact on policy processes and deliberations in international processes 
</p>
<p>and forums or face the risk of falling into irrelevance or of becoming a purely  
</p>
<p>academic exercise.
</p>
<p> In this regard, the proposal for work on exceptions and limitations made by 
</p>
<p>a number of developing countries at the March 2008 session of WIPO&rsquo;s Stand-
</p>
<p>ing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights	paves the way for a process of 
deliberations of significant importance, one in which the A2K movement should 
</p>
<p>be fully engaged and which it should support.62 The proposal stems from the 
</p>
<p>premise that often, developing countries have comparatively fewer exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations for research, education, the visually impaired, and so in their national 
</p>
<p>copyright laws, compared with developed countries, and make less use of them, 
</p>
<p>although they might be more in need of them, given their vast needs for access to 
</p>
<p>educational material. The proposal raises the possibility of elaborating an inter-
</p>
<p>national instrument on exceptions and limitations that would provide normative 
</p>
<p>guidance in this area and include a mandatory set of exceptions and limitations 
</p>
<p>that would be common to all WIPO member states.63
</p>
<p> Another opportunity for the A2K movement lies in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>WIPO Development Agenda recommendations relating to access to knowledge. 
</p>
<p>In effect, after two years of intense debates, in September and October 2007, the 
</p>
<p>WIPO Assemblies adopted by consensus forty-five recommendations aiming at the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a development agenda for WIPO.64 The assemblies established the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Development and Intellectual Property to monitor the implementa-
</p>
<p>tion of these recommendations. At the committee meetings held in March and July 
</p>
<p>2008, member states discussed the implementation of a number of recommenda-
</p>
<p>tions, particularly those relating to intellectual property technical assistance.
</p>
<p> The implementation of the recommendations relating to the strengthening of 
</p>
<p>the public domain or to the consideration of open, collaborative models requires 
</p>
<p>the identification of specific activities and concrete proposals to promote these 
</p>
<p>issues in WIPO&rsquo;s activities, such as through awareness raising (seminars, work-
</p>
<p>shops, publications, and so on) legislative advice, or norm setting. The A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment should contribute to the identification of these activities and proposals and 
</p>
<p>remain active in this implementation phase, because it might be even more critical 
</p>
<p>than the phase of deliberations that took place from 2004 to 2007. It is the actual 
</p>
<p>implementation of these recommendations that will determine the extent to which 
</p>
<p>the WIPO Development Agenda will have been able to orient WIPO&rsquo;s activities 
</p>
<p>the emergence of the a2k movement</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>120
</p>
<p>toward a more balanced and development-oriented approach to intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty and toward promoting creativity and innovation beyond traditional intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property categories in a manner that effectively contributes to A2K.
</p>
<p>	 Beyond WIPO, the A2K movement should carefully examine influencing other 
relevant policy processes and forums. In this regard, UNESCO, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, can be an organization of sig-
</p>
<p>nificant importance for promoting access to knowledge. Until now, it has not been 
</p>
<p>central in the preoccupations and advocacy of the A2K movement. In addition, 
</p>
<p>the experience of UNESCO in concluding the Convention on Cultural Diversity in 
</p>
<p>a relatively short period of time (2003 to 2005) might bear valuable lessons for the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement.
</p>
<p> The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) that resulted from the World Summit on 
</p>
<p>the Information Society is another venue where the A2K movement has pursued 
</p>
<p>its objectives and should continue to do so.
</p>
<p> Beyond WIPO, UNESCO, and the IGF, another interesting possibility would be 
</p>
<p>launching an A2K initiative at the UN General Assembly, the competent body for 
</p>
<p>discussing all political, economic, and social issues at the UN, particularly issues 
</p>
<p>that have a cross-sectoral nature and touch upon many areas of the UN&rsquo;s work, 
</p>
<p>such as development, education, culture, science, intellectual property, and so on. 
</p>
<p>This step would be critical in the further diffusion and adoption of the A2K para-
</p>
<p>digm by the entire UN system, as has occurred in the past with other concepts, 
</p>
<p>such as human development or sustainable development. Of course, this is a long-
</p>
<p>term process, and it requires an active role on the part of governments, as well as 
</p>
<p>engagement and leadership from developing countries. The trajectory of the envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental movement from the first environmental summit in Stockholm in 1972 
</p>
<p>(where only a handful of heads of state and governments were present) to the Rio 
</p>
<p>summit in 1992 (in which more than a hundred heads of state and governments 
</p>
<p>participated) represents a valuable experience for the A2K movement to study for 
</p>
<p>extracting the appropriate lessons.
</p>
<p> Finally, it is of fundamental importance to generate empirical studies and aca-
</p>
<p>demic work that further contribute to the advancement of the A2K paradigm and 
</p>
<p>that underpin it. In this regard, the Yale Law School Information Society Project 
</p>
<p>A2K conferences, starting in 2006, have played a valuable role in strengthening 
</p>
<p>the links between the A2K movement and academia. Similarly, the A2K country 
</p>
<p>studies (Brazil, China, Egypt, India, South Africa) commissioned by the Informa-
</p>
<p>tion Society Project will enrich A2K advocacy as well as raise awareness on A2K in 
</p>
<p>developing countries.65

</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>In its further development and growth, the A2K movement continues to confront 
</p>
<p>the need to achieve a delicate balance. On the one hand, while the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment emerged from an interaction with globalized intellectual property rules and 
</p>
<p>processes, particularly at WIPO, it should go beyond these and engage with other 
</p>
<p>national and international rules and processes in the areas of education, culture, 
</p>
<p>human rights, the environment, and so on. This interaction could further enrich 
</p>
<p>A2K conceptually, while at the same time, issues in these areas could benefit from 
</p>
<p>being framed in A2K terms.
</p>
<p> However, it is also equally important for the A2K movement to remain focused 
</p>
<p>in its advocacy on the original set of issues that led to its emergence&mdash;the genera-
</p>
<p>tion, dissemination, and use of knowledge and their regulation&mdash;and not to dis-
</p>
<p>perse itself in areas close to its concerns, but where other social actors and move-
</p>
<p>ments are already doing valuable and effective advocacy work. This consideration 
</p>
<p>is essential, particularly for developing countries, because new challenges loom 
</p>
<p>in the horizon in the form of proposals for higher enforcement standards or new 
</p>
<p>enforcement agreements that could possibly be detrimental to the objectives of 
</p>
<p>the A2K movement.66

<p>The	Revised	Drug	Strategy:	
</p>
<p>Access	to	Essential	Medicines,	Intellectual	Property,	
</p>
<p>and	the	World	Health	Organization
</p>
<p>Ellen &lsquo;t Hoen
</p>
<p>The magnitude of the AIDS crisis has drawn attention to the fact that millions 
</p>
<p>of people in the developing world do not have access to the medicines that are 
</p>
<p>needed to treat disease or to alleviate suffering. The high cost of AIDS medicines 
</p>
<p>has also focused attention on the relation between patent protection and high 
</p>
<p>drug prices. The difficulties that developing countries experience in paying for 
</p>
<p>new essential medicines have raised concerns about the effects of the 1995 World 
</p>
<p>Trade Organization (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
</p>
<p>(TRIPS) Agreement, which sets global standards for the protection of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property (IP). These standards derive from Western countries with a high level of 
</p>
<p>industrial development, and though they are often referred to as &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; stan-
</p>
<p>dards, they set the bar very high. The AIDS crisis gives us an alarming preview of 
</p>
<p>the consequences of such intellectual property rules, which by no means are con-
</p>
<p>fined to AIDS medicines. All new health-care products may be affected by TRIPS 
</p>
<p>and by the new patent rules that it imposes on almost every country in the world.
</p>
<p> However the lack of access to medicines is not a recent problem for the devel-
</p>
<p>oping world. For decades, countries have been dependent on Western companies 
</p>
<p>for their supply of medicines, and they have at times suffered from it.1 Western-
</p>
<p>style pharmaceutical patent-protection requirements are likely to increase devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries&rsquo; dependency further.
</p>
<p> During the 1990s, in response to developing countries&rsquo; need to increase the 
</p>
<p>availability and improve the use of medicines, the World Health Organization 
</p>
<p>(WHO) developed a medicine policy called the Revised Drug Strategy. The Revised 
</p>
<p>Drug Strategy built strongly on the concept of &ldquo;essential drugs&rdquo; created in the late 
</p>
<p>1970s. (See the sidebar &ldquo;The Concept of Essential Medicines.&rdquo;) After the adoption 
</p>
<p>of the TRIPS Agreement, it became obvious that the Revised Drug Strategy needed 
</p>
<p>to be adjusted to take into account the effects of intellectual property protection, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&lsquo;t hoen128
</p>
<p>and in particular of patenting, on the production and availability of medicines. In 
</p>
<p>fact, the very concept of &ldquo;essential drugs&rdquo; brought the dilemma over intellectual 
</p>
<p>property to the fore at the WHO. After all, the work of the program responsible 
</p>
<p>for implementing the Revised Drug Strategy risked becoming obsolete, because 
</p>
<p>its advice was based on a world where countries were at liberty to determine the 
</p>
<p>kind of pharmaceutical patent regimes that they wished to have. The Revised Drug 
</p>
<p>Strategy strongly recommended that countries adopt a national policy encourag-
</p>
<p>ing the use of generic medicines, a recommendation that ran counter to the new 
</p>
<p>obligations that countries took on under the WTO TRIPS rules in 1995. Countries&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>struggle to access newer medicines such as antiretrovirals to treat people living 
</p>
<p>with AIDS illustrated the need to adapt the Revised Drug Strategy to this new real-
</p>
<p>ity. The discussions on the Revised Drug Strategy came at a point in history where 
</p>
<p>intellectual property became a controversial issue around which NGOs and health 
</p>
<p>experts launched campaigns. The purpose of this article is to revisit this history to 
</p>
<p>show how intellectual property became a political issue in the area of health, how 
</p>
<p>NGOs became mobilized around the issue of intellectual property, and how the 
</p>
<p>WHO became a major forum in which to discuss the impact of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>legislation on people&rsquo;s lives.
</p>
<p>the adoption of the revised drug strategy
</p>
<p>In November 1985, member states, the pharmaceutical industry, academia, con-
</p>
<p>sumer groups, and the WHO secretariat met in Nairobi under the leadership of 
</p>
<p>then WHO director general Dr. Halfdan T. Mahler to discuss the WHO&rsquo;s strategy on 
</p>
<p>medicines. At the 1984 World Health Assembly, the annual meeting of the WHO&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>member states, groups such as Health Action International, a network of consumer 
</p>
<p>groups, public-interest NGOs, health-care providers, academics, media, and indi-
</p>
<p>viduals in more than seventy countries advocating for &ldquo;increased access to essen-
</p>
<p>tial medicines and improved rational use of medicines,&rdquo;2 expressed concerns that 
</p>
<p>the focus of the WHO&rsquo;s work on supply overshadowed the need to improve the use 
</p>
<p>of medicines, to deal with unethical marketing practices, and to remove useless 
</p>
<p>and dangerous products from the market. Health Action International felt that the 
</p>
<p>WHO&rsquo;s involvement in medicine policy should go beyond listing what should be in 
</p>
<p>every country&rsquo;s medicine chest and called for international rules that could help 
</p>
<p>countries to intervene in how drug companies behave.
</p>
<p> Director General Dr. Mahler announced at the meeting that he would develop 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;a strategy for strengthening WHO&rsquo;s activities in support of the action required to 
</p>
<p>make drug use more rational throughout the world.&rdquo; He listed the key elements 
</p>
<p>that such a policy related to access to medicines should contain: measures to </p>

</p>
<p>the concept of essential medicines
</p>
<p>In the 1970s, in public-health circles, there was a strong move toward establishing 
</p>
<p>primary health care. The selection and provision of essential medicines was then 
</p>
<p>increasingly seen as a core function of governments in the context of primary care. 
</p>
<p>As a result, in 1975, the World Health Assembly, the annual assembly of the WHO 
</p>
<p>member states, adopted a resolution calling on the WHO to assist its members to 
</p>
<p>select and procure essential drugs and assure that these drugs were of good quality 
</p>
<p>and reasonable cost.1 The first WHO Essential Drugs List, containing 207 items, was 
</p>
<p>published in 1977. The purpose of the list was to identify those medicines &ldquo;of utmost 
</p>
<p>importance, basic, indispensable and necessary for the health and needs of the popu-
</p>
<p>lation.&rdquo;2 Selection criteria included issues related to efficacy, quality, safety, and cost. 
</p>
<p>Since then, fifteen editions of the list have been published. Today, the WHO Essen-
</p>
<p>tial Drugs List&mdash;rebaptized the Essential Medicines List in 2002&mdash;contains around 
</p>
<p>325 items. The list is regularly updated to be able to respond to new needs, drug 
</p>
<p>resistance, medical advances, scientific developments, and new evidence with regard 
</p>
<p>to efficacy and safety. The Essential Medicines List is also useful to identify gaps in 
</p>
<p>research and development of new essential medicines. For example, a few years ago, 
</p>
<p>expert discussions over the Essential Medicines List highlighted the obvious need for 
</p>
<p>pediatric formulations of AIDS medicines to treat children. Because pediatric AIDS is 
</p>
<p>rare in rich countries, companies lacked the commercial incentive to develop easy-to-
</p>
<p>use medications for children.
</p>
<p> Although the basic notion that some drugs are essential and others are not and 
</p>
<p>the creation of an evidence-based list of essential drugs may not seem either contro-
</p>
<p>versial nor radical, the concept of essential medicines has been both. Dr. Ernst Lau-
</p>
<p>ridsen, the first director of the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs, described 
</p>
<p>it as a &ldquo;peaceful revolution in international public health.&rdquo;3 However, the adoption of 
</p>
<p>this new policy did not happen without controversy. The pharmaceutical industry saw 
</p>
<p>the concept of essential medicines and WHO&rsquo;s work with governments on medicine 
</p>
<p>policies as a frontal attack on its freedom to operate and feared that it would lead 
</p>
<p>to government interference in the industry&rsquo;s marketing practices. Countries would 
</p>
<p>indeed use the list to exclude drugs on the Essential Medicines List from patentabil-
</p>
<p>ity, as was the case in the Andean region; to remove medicines from the market; to 
</p>
<p>establish price controls; and to develop their own national manufacturing capacity of 
</p>
<p>essential medicines, thereby reducing dependence on Western companies.
</p>
<p> NGOs have played an important role in protecting and promoting the concept 
</p>
<p>of essential medicines. Health Action International, a global network of health and 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical groups and individuals, was a particularly key player in the advo-
</p>
<p>cacy for essential health policies at both the international and the national levels. 
</p>
<p>This organization has its roots in the consumer movement in the Global South; its </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>members saw the detrimental effects of the lack of essential medicines and the avail-
</p>
<p>ability of dangerous and ineffective drugs on a daily basis.
</p>
<p> In 1977, the International Federation of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, the main international lobbying organization for the multinational phar-
</p>
<p>maceutical industry, called the medical and economic arguments for the Essential 
</p>
<p>Medicines List &ldquo;fallacious&rdquo; and claimed that adopting it would &ldquo;result in substandard 
</p>
<p>rather than improved medical care and might well reduce health standards already 
</p>
<p>attained.&rdquo;4 The industry was particularly concerned that the Essential Medicines List 
</p>
<p>would become a global concept, applicable beyond the developing world, and, for 
</p>
<p>example, be used for priority setting in the marketing approval of medicines or in the 
</p>
<p>reimbursement decisions of health-insurance companies in industrialized countries. 
</p>
<p>Such measures, they feared, would, for example, limit the industry&rsquo;s ability to market 
</p>
<p>aggressively new medicines that have larger profit margins than older ones.
</p>
<p> In 1982, a spokesman of the U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers organization said 
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;the industry feels strongly that any efforts by the World Health Organization 
</p>
<p>and national governments to implement this action program should not interfere 
</p>
<p>with existing private sector operations,&rdquo; thereby signaling the industry&rsquo;s concern that 
</p>
<p>industrialized countries would use the concept of essential medicines to introduce 
</p>
<p>limited lists of prioritized medicines. The Italian drug industry put it more crudely in 
</p>
<p>response to the Italian Senate&rsquo;s attempts to introduce an essential medicines list: &ldquo;If 
</p>
<p>they want to turn Italy into a Third World country, this is the way to go about it.&rdquo;5 
</p>
<p>According to the drug industry view, the Essential Medicines List should be a tool 
</p>
<p>only for the public sector in the poorest nations of the world.
</p>
<p> This view has not changed much in the last twenty-five years. A 2002 Interna-
</p>
<p>tional Federation of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association issue paper on 
</p>
<p>the concept of essential medicines expressed the belief that policies that extend 
</p>
<p>restrictive drug policies to industrialized countries pose a serious threat to the deliv-
</p>
<p>ery of effective health care and pose a threat to investment in drug research&mdash;a stan-
</p>
<p>dard, multipurpose argument used by the pharmaceutical industry to object to any 
</p>
<p>policy they see as detrimental to their interests.

</p>
<p>improve the way medicines are regulated, measures to improve the way they move 
</p>
<p>in international commerce, and measures to improve the way they are advertised 
</p>
<p>and used.3
</p>
<p> Six months later, in May 1986, the World Health Assembly adopted the WHO 
</p>
<p>Revised Drug Strategy, which prescribed a series of actions to ensure the avail-
</p>
<p>ability of affordable essential medicines and strategies to improve the use of these 
</p>
<p>medicines (&ldquo;the rational use of drugs&rdquo;). The Revised Drug Strategy would become 
</p>
<p>the organization&rsquo;s policy on medicine for decades to come.
</p>
<p> Participants in the Nairobi conference discussed high drug prices, addressed the 
</p>
<p>fact that pharmaceutical research and development of medicines with real thera-
</p>
<p>peutic value was lacking, compared with R&amp;D on medicines that were only trivial 
</p>
<p>advances, and the need to stimulate local production of essential medicines in 
</p>
<p>developing countries to decrease the dependence on Western companies. For these 
</p>
<p>countries, local production was also seen as an industrial-development objective 
</p>
<p>as such. But notably, the subject of pharmaceutical patenting was nowhere on the 
</p>
<p>radar screen of this gathering of the world&rsquo;s premier health experts and advocates.
</p>
<p> Ironically, while the Revised Drug Strategy was being formulated, pharma-
</p>
<p>ceutical companies were establishing an elite, high-powered lobbying group that 
</p>
<p>worked to include intellectual property in the agenda of the General Agreements 
</p>
<p>on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) framework, the predecessor of the WTO.4 It would 
</p>
<p>take another ten years before health advocates would make the link between 
</p>
<p>access to medicines and the GATT talks. Nevertheless, unknowingly, by expanding 
</p>
<p>the WHO&rsquo;s role in medicine policies, the Nairobi conference laid the foundation for 
</p>
<p>later activism on intellectual property issues and access to medicines.
</p>
<p>trade concerns emerge
</p>
<p>Ten years after the historic Nairobi conference, the International Conference on 
</p>
<p>National Medicinal Drug Policies was held in Sydney, Australia, in 1995.5 Delegates 
</p>
<p>discussed most components that were considered essential to a sound medicine 
</p>
<p>policy: how to select essential medicines, what measures to take to increase access 
</p>
<p>to medicines, how to encourage the correct prescription by physicians and the 
</p>
<p>proper use by consumers of medicines, how to establish government regulations 
</p>
<p>that ensure that medicines are effective, safe, and of good quality, and how to 
</p>
<p>regulate the drug industry and its drug-promotion practices.
</p>
<p> It was at this conference that for the first time public-health advocates raised 
</p>
<p>the concern that the globalization of new international trade rules and the harmo-
</p>
<p>nization of regulatory requirements would restrict countries&rsquo; ability to implement 
</p>
<p>drug policies that would ensure access to medicine for all. These concerns came </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&lsquo;t hoen132
</p>
<p>in particular from speakers from Latin America and Asia, who drew attention to 
</p>
<p>the long-term consequences of the introduction of twenty-year product patents&mdash;
</p>
<p>as required by the WTO&mdash;in countries such as India and Argentina, which were 
</p>
<p>home to extensive generic-drug industries. Tellingly, some responded by suggest-
</p>
<p>ing that the effects of patents could be countered with policies for the substitu-
</p>
<p>tion of generic drugs. Of course, a generic version of a product is precisely what a 
</p>
<p>patent forbids. However, promoting generic medicines was a staple of the WHO&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>medicine policy as articulated in the Revised Drug Strategy, because by encour-
</p>
<p>aging competition between producers, the substitution of generics can result in 
</p>
<p>a reduction in the price close to marginal cost levels, and generic medicines are 
</p>
<p>on the whole a fraction of the price of brand-name medicines. Such contradictory 
</p>
<p>comments made it apparent that even drug-policy experts at the time had a very 
</p>
<p>limited understanding of the ramifications of new international rules on intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property.
</p>
<p> Nevertheless, over the course of this meeting, delegates did come to recog-
</p>
<p>nize their need to get a better sense of the consequences of new trade rules. And 
</p>
<p>the meeting recommended that the WHO and local governments investigate and 
</p>
<p>address the effect of agreements such as TRIPS on national medicine policies and 
</p>
<p>take action to ensure that health policies are primary where trade-related policies 
</p>
<p>are formulated.6
</p>
<p> The debate quickly took hold when, at the next annual meeting of the WHO&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>member states in 1996, health ministers debated for the first time the effects of 
</p>
<p>new WTO trade rules on access to medicines.7 This debate was long overdue, con-
</p>
<p>sidering that the WTO agreements were negotiated without input from health 
</p>
<p>experts and had already gone into effect.
</p>
<p>essential medicines and intellectual property at the who:  
from red book to blue book
</p>
<p>The public-health advocates coordinated by Health Action International first 
</p>
<p>raised concerns about the consequences of globalization and international trade 
</p>
<p>agreements for drug access during the 1996 World Health Assembly. They sought 
</p>
<p>to get the WHO to intervene in intellectual property issues because it became 
</p>
<p>apparent that the GATT negotiators had drawn up the rules without any consid-
</p>
<p>eration for health issues. The assembly debated a resolution on the Revised Drug 
</p>
<p>Strategy.8 As a result of Health Action International&rsquo;s intervention, the resolution 
</p>
<p>included a request for the WHO to study and report on the impact of the work 
</p>
<p>of the WTO with respect to national drug policies and essential drugs and make 
</p>
<p>recommendations for collaboration between the WTO and the WHO. This was </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the revised drug strategy 133
</p>
<p>important, because it gave the WHO a mandate to develop work on the effects of 
</p>
<p>the new WTO rules, which was a new terrain for the organization.
</p>
<p> This resolution gave the WHO the mandate to publish, in 1998, the first guide 
</p>
<p>with recommendations to member states on how to implement TRIPS while limiting 
</p>
<p>the negative effects of higher levels of patent protection on drug availability.9 The 
</p>
<p>response to this guide from the United States and a number of European countries 
</p>
<p>was swift and fiercely negative. In particular, the United States, working very closely 
</p>
<p>with drug-company lobby groups, pressured the WHO to withdraw the publication, 
</p>
<p>calling the book &ldquo;an outrageous and biased attempt to mold international opinion.&rdquo;10
</p>
<p> Initially, the WHO withdrew the publication&mdash;which, because of its red cover, 
</p>
<p>became known as &ldquo;the red book&rdquo;&mdash;and reissued it with some minor changes and 
</p>
<p>an annex containing presentations by different parties reflecting different views 
</p>
<p>on the issue of pharmaceutical patenting, but this time with a blue cover. Dr. Gro 
</p>
<p>Harlem Brundtland, who had just been elected director general of the WHO, did 
</p>
<p>not yield to the pressures and instead organized a meeting at which she invited 
</p>
<p>a number of parties to express their views. She also dealt with the criticisms that 
</p>
<p>the book held inaccurate information by inviting external reviews. The reviewers 
</p>
<p>found very little wrong with the report. While the U.S. action caused a delay in 
</p>
<p>publication, it did not succeed in suppressing the report. But sadly, in future WHO 
</p>
<p>work on trade and intellectual property issues, this would be different.
</p>
<p> The WHO&rsquo;s involvement in trade and intellectual property issues would remain 
</p>
<p>highly controversial in the years that followed. The simple emphasis that the WHO 
</p>
<p>placed on public-health needs over trade interests was perceived as a threat to the 
</p>
<p>commercial sector of the industrialized world. In particular, a greater role for the 
</p>
<p>WHO in issues related to TRIPS created considerable concern within the pharma-
</p>
<p>ceutical industry, which lobbied hard against it.
</p>
<p> A draft resolution discussed at the 1998 WHO Executive Board, the governing 
</p>
<p>body of the WHO responsible for preparing the annual World Health Assembly, 
</p>
<p>called on the WHO member countries to ensure that public health, rather than 
</p>
<p>commercial interests, would have primacy in pharmaceutical and health policies. 
</p>
<p>The resolution further referred to TRIPS and asked the WHO director general to 
</p>
<p>analyze the effects of new trade agreements on health and to develop measures to 
</p>
<p>counter these effects.
</p>
<p> In 1998, in response to this draft resolution on the Revised Drug Strategy and 
</p>
<p>in reference to &ldquo;considerable concern among the pharmaceutical industry,&rdquo; the 
</p>
<p>position of the European director general for trade of the European Commission&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>position was &ldquo;No priority should be given to health over intellectual property 
</p>
<p>considerations.&rdquo;11
</p>
<p> The WHO Executive Board established an ad-hoc group chaired by France to  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>134
</p>
<p>prepare for the discussions on the Revised Drug Strategy at the World Health 
</p>
<p>Assembly in 1999. The issue of trade agreements with regard to intellectual 
</p>
<p>property and access to medicines had been put on the agenda of the WHO and 
</p>
<p>was there to stay. The Executive Board ad-hoc group organized a five-day 
</p>
<p>meeting, including a one-day hearing with interested parties. It concluded 
</p>
<p>its work with a proposed resolution that was sent to the Fifty-Second World  
</p>
<p>Health Assembly.12
</p>
<p> That was also the year during which NGOs increased their involvement in the 
</p>
<p>trade and health debates. In anticipation of the 1999 Seattle WTO ministerial con-
</p>
<p>ference, there was a flurry of activity and networking that strengthened the base 
</p>
<p>of knowledge that NGOs had about intellectual property and their ability to mobi-
</p>
<p>lize quickly in relation to the issue, fuelled by the &ldquo;health primacy&rdquo; debates at the 
</p>
<p>World Health Assembly and against the backdrop of a South African court case in 
</p>
<p>which a group of thirty-nine pharmaceutical companies had taken South Africa to 
</p>
<p>court over its Medicines and Related Substances Control Act, claiming that some 
</p>
<p>of its provisions that could be used to supply patients with cheap medicines were 
</p>
<p>not compliant with WTO standards.13 A key coalition of groups consisted of Health 
</p>
<p>Action International, the Consumer Project on Technology (CPTech, now Knowl-
</p>
<p>edge Ecology International, KEI), Act Up&ndash;Paris, the Health GAP coalition, Oxfam, 
</p>
<p>and the Access to Medicines campaign of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF). These 
</p>
<p>groups worked in close collaboration with national treatment-action groups in var-
</p>
<p>ious countries, notably in Thailand, Brazil, India, and South Africa.
</p>
<p> The resolution adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1999 strength-
</p>
<p>ened the WHO&rsquo;s role in intellectual property issues.14 The text no longer called 
</p>
<p>for the &ldquo;primacy of health over trade,&rdquo; but noted the importance of &ldquo;ensur-
</p>

</p>
<p>it did put the health advocates at the table of trade negotiations, as the subse-

<p>quent developments at the WTO TRIPS Council and the Doha WTO ministe-
</p>
<p>rial conference would show.15 The resolution also urged countries to look into 
</p>
<p>the options they have under current trade rules to safeguard access to essential 
</p>
<p>medicines, a clear reference to the flexibilities available under the TRIPS Agree-
</p>
<p>ment, such as compulsory licensing, which allows governments to overcome 
</p>
<p>patents and produce, import, export, and market generic versions of a pat-
</p>
<p>ented drug. Most importantly, the assembly requested that the WHO assess the 
</p>
<p>health implications of trade agreements, which was understood to mean the 
</p>
<p>WTO TRIPS Agreement, with a view to assisting countries to mitigate the nega-
</p>
<p>tive effects of this agreement. This was in response to countries&rsquo; calls on the 
</p>
<p>WHO for technical assistance in implementing TRIPS flexibilities. In summary, the

</p>
<p>updating and disseminating the who&rsquo;s model list of essential drugs
</p>
<p>In 2001, the WHO, prompted by groups such as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res&rsquo; campaign 
</p>
<p>for access to essential medicine and various academics,1 embarked on a process to 
</p>
<p>change the way new medicines were included in the WHO Model List of Essential 
</p>
<p>Drugs. Over time, the requirement that an essential medicine be affordable had 
</p>
<p>become a barrier to the inclusion of newer medicines. New medicines that are widely 
</p>
<p>patent protected tend to be available at monopoly prices only because of the lack 
</p>
<p>of generic competitors. In practice, this meant that the WHO was reluctant to label 
</p>
<p>such products as &ldquo;essential,&rdquo; because governments would not be able to afford them, 
</p>
<p>and purchase of expensive medicines would be to the detriment of the treatment 
</p>
<p>of other diseases. As a result, antiretroviral medicines needed to treat people living 
</p>
<p>with AIDS were not on the list. In a world where over forty million people are infected 
</p>
<p>with HIV and eight thousand die from AIDS every single day, maintaining the position 
</p>
<p>that proven-effective antiretroviral medicines are &ldquo;not essential&rdquo; became absurd and 
</p>
<p>risked making the WHO Essential Drugs List irrelevant.
</p>
<p> By questioning the affordability criteria for including a medicine on the list, NGOs 
</p>
<p>and health experts made two points: First, the primary criteria for defining an essen-
</p>
<p>tial medicine should be the medical need for that product, and second, once a prod-
</p>
<p>uct is labeled &ldquo;essential,&rdquo; it should be affordable and available to the individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities that need access to it.
</p>
<p> The 2002 definition of essential medicines changed. It stressed the need for 
</p>
<p>essential medicines to be available at a price the individual and the community can 
</p>
<p>afford.2 The new definition implied that governments have an obligation to assure 
</p>
<p>the availability and affordability of these products. And a high price was no longer 
</p>
<p>a barrier for inclusion in the list. With this measure, the WHO anticipated that the 
</p>
<p>Essential Drugs List, on which national essential drugs lists are based, could become 
</p>
<p>a useful tool for selecting candidate drugs for compulsory licensing or other cost-
</p>
<p>containment measures.

</p>
<p>age forms, with assured quality and adequate information, and at a price the individual 
</p>
<p>and the community can afford. The implementation of the concept of essential med-
</p>
<p>icines is intended to be flexible and adaptable to many different situations; exactly 
</p>

<p>resolution amended the Revised Drug Strategy to enable the WHO to start work 
</p>
<p>in an area previously the exclusive domain of trade negotiators and intellectual  
</p>
<p>property lawyers.
</p>
<p> Subsequent resolutions of the World Health Assemblies have further strength-
</p>
<p>ened the WHO&rsquo;s mandate in the trade arena. In May 2001, the World Health 
</p>
<p>Assembly adopted two resolutions in particular that had a bearing on the debate 
</p>
<p>over TRIPS.16 The resolutions addressed the need to strengthen policies to increase 
</p>
<p>the availability of generic drugs and the need to evaluate the impact of TRIPS on 
</p>
<p>access to drugs, local manufacturing capacity, and the development of new drugs. 
</p>
<p>Each time, the adoption of these resolutions required massive mobilization by 
</p>
<p>civil-society groups. The coalition of NGOs mentioned above had gained strength. 
</p>
<p>Since the 1999 WTO Seattle conference, it was active on two fronts in Geneva: the 
</p>
<p>WTO TRIPS Council and the WHO itself. The South African court case in which 
</p>
<p>thirty-nine multinational drug companies sued South Africa over the access provi-
</p>
<p>sions in its Medicines Act helped to advertise globally the need to push back the 
</p>
<p>commercial lobby in favor of a more health-oriented international trade agenda.

</p>
<p>essential medicines and compulsory licensing
</p>
<p>According to the WHO Revised Drug Strategy, essential medicines should be avail-
</p>
<p>able at a price that the individual and the community can afford. Before TRIPS, 
</p>
<p>some developing countries assured cost containment by excluding medicines or 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;essential medicines&rdquo; from patentability. For example, until 1991, only manufactur-
</p>
<p>ing processes for the preparation of medicines were patentable in the countries of 
</p>
<p>the Andean Community&mdash;not the medicines themselves. Following the introduc-
</p>
<p>tion of pharmaceutical product patents in 1991, the Andean Community adopted 
</p>
<p>a declaration that provided that &ldquo;inventions related to pharmaceutical products 
</p>
<p>included in the WHO Model List of Essential Drugs&rdquo;&mdash;the Essential Medicines 
</p>
<p>List&mdash;should not be patentable.17 This measure was taken to prevent abusive pric-
</p>
<p>ing of essential medicines that could result from the new patent rules.
</p>
<p> Venezuela, with support from the Andean group and other developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries, in particular South Africa, proposed at the Third Ministerial Conference of 
</p>
<p>the WTO in Seattle in 1999 to amend TRIPS to create a new exception to patentabil-
</p>
<p>ity for medicines on the WHO Essential Medicines List.18 A counterproposal led by 
</p>
<p>the European Community was &ldquo;to issue . . . compulsory licenses for drugs appearing 
</p>
<p>on the list of essential drugs of the World Health Organization.&rdquo;19 At that time, 
</p>
<p>only about 11 of the 306 products on the WHO Model List of Essential Drugs were 
</p>
<p>patented in certain countries.20 The adoption of the EC proposal would have seri-
</p>
<p>ously limited the scope of compulsory licensing, because TRIPS does not limit 
</p>
<p>such licensing to particular circumstances, as the EC proposal would have done. 
</p>
<p>The Seattle WTO ministerial conference collapsed and never reached a conclusion. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, since then, the effect of the globalization of patent rules on access to 
</p>
<p>essential medicines has been on the agenda not only of the WHO, but of numerous 
</p>
<p>trade and health forums, ultimately leading to the adoption of the declaration on 
</p>
<p>TRIPS and public health at the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the WTO that took 
</p>
<p>place in Doha, Qatar. The WTO Doha Declaration established the primacy of health 
</p>
<p>over commercial interests after all.
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>Since 2001, as a result of the strengthened Revised Drug Strategy, the WHO&rsquo;s work 
</p>
<p>program on pharmaceuticals and trade now includes the provision of policy guid-
</p>
<p>ance and information on intellectual property and health to countries for monitoring 
</p>
<p>and analyzing the effects of TRIPS on access to medicines.21 However, until today, 
</p>
<p>the WHO leadership has been overly cautious in fulfilling this mandate. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, the publication of guidance to countries about how to deal with pharmaceutical

<p>138
</p>
<p>patents in case of access barriers remains problematic, and only one WHO staff 
</p>
<p>member is working on intellectual property and medicines. The WHO director- 
</p>
<p>general, Dr. Margaret Chan was initially critical of Thailand&rsquo;s decision in 2006 to 
</p>
<p>issue compulsory licenses for three drugs on the national essential drugs list,22 
</p>
<p>despite the fact that this is a decision Thailand can lawfully make under interna-
</p>
<p>tional and Thai law. She urged the Thai government to enter into negotiations with 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies, a line that was being pushed by the United States and 
</p>
<p>not required by law.23 She reversed her position after heavy criticism from devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries, AIDS groups, and NGOs.24
</p>
<p> Since then, Thailand has asked the WHO for technical assistance. The Thailand 
</p>
<p>compulsory license case is illustrative of the failure of the WHO to this day to pro-
</p>
<p>vide both technical and political support to the use of the TRIPS flexibilities. This 
</p>
<p>is all the more alarming since numerous World Health Assembly resolutions have 
</p>
<p>asked the WHO director general to step up work in this field, and this work has 
</p>
<p>been formally part of the WHO medicine strategy since the 1999 revisions of the 
</p>
<p>Revised Drug Strategy.
</p>
<p> The story of the Revised Drug Strategy shows that even with all the right reso-
</p>
<p>lutions on the books, in the end, moving the health agenda forward also requires 
</p>
<p>leadership and political courage.

<p>The	Doha	Declaration	on	TRIPS	and	Public	Health:		
</p>
<p>An	Impetus	for	Access	to	Medicines
</p>
<p>Sangeeta Shashikant
</p>
<p>Today approximately two billion people worldwide&mdash;one-third of the world&rsquo;s pop-
</p>
<p>ulation&mdash;do not have access to the essential medicines they need. In some of the 
</p>
<p>lowest-income countries in Africa and Asia, this figure rises to more than half of 
</p>
<p>the population.
</p>
<p> These statistics reveal that despite the significant technological advances made 
</p>
<p>by humankind in the medical field, getting medicines to those who need them 
</p>
<p>remains a major challenge for the international community. Access to essential 
</p>
<p>medicines, a fundamental element of the universal human right to health, depends 
</p>
<p>on several factors, such as prices, rational medicine-selection processes, sustain-
</p>
<p>able financing, and reliable health-care and supply systems.1
</p>
<p> However, the price factor can be determinative all by itself, and price is liter-
</p>
<p>ally a matter of life or death when a deadly disease is treatable. It also can deter-
</p>
<p>mine whether the government will be able to provide treatment to its people or 
</p>
<p>whether an individual will be able to obtain the treatment that he or she requires. 
</p>
<p>The problem of high prices has been observed by the international community in 
</p>
<p>the context of treatable infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. For 
</p>
<p>example, in 2000, for a triple-combination antiretroviral treatment of stavudine 
</p>
<p>(d4T) plus lamivudine (3TC) plus nevirapine (NVP), the price of the lowest-priced 
</p>
<p>branded treatment was about $10,439 for a year&rsquo;s supply.2 The high price tag meant 
</p>
<p>patients living with HIV/AIDS would not be able to afford treatment and would 
</p>
<p>be condemned to death. However, the availability of generic versions of branded 
</p>
<p>medicines led to significant price reductions. In 2001, Cipla Ltd., a generic producer 
</p>
<p>based in India, offered the same combination for $350. Over time, with more com-
</p>
<p>petition, this cost has been reduced to $99.3 Reduced prices for antiretroviral treat-
</p>
<p>ment have been a crucial factor in the scaling up of HIV/AIDS treatment.
</p>
<p> As can be seen from the example of HIV/AIDS, competition among mul-
</p>
<p>tiple manufacturers is essentially the reason for reduced prices. However, the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>shashikant142
</p>
<p>existence of competition has very much been threatened since the coming into 
</p>
<p>force of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agree-
</p>
<p>ment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. TRIPS for the first time set 
</p>
<p>out minimum standards and requirements for the protection of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights&mdash;for example, trademarks, copyrights, and patents. It obliges all WTO 
</p>
<p>members to adopt and to enforce high standards of intellectual property protec-
</p>
<p>tion derived from the standards used in developed countries, except where pro-
</p>
<p>vision for a transition period that delays the implementation of the agreement  
</p>
<p>is made.4
</p>
<p> Many development experts are of the view that TRIPS has very significantly 
</p>
<p>tilted the balance in favor of the holders of intellectual property rights, most of 
</p>
<p>whom are in developed countries, vis-&agrave;-vis consumers and local producers in 
</p>
<p>developing countries and vis-&agrave;-vis development interests.5 The minimum twenty-
</p>
<p>year patent protection required by TRIPS allows a pharmaceutical company 
</p>
<p>monopoly over the production, marketing, and pricing of patent-protected medi-
</p>
<p>cines. This period can be further extended by the company through the use of 
</p>
<p>various strategies, such as applying for patents on usage, dosage, or combinations 
</p>
<p>of drugs &mdash;a practice commonly known as &ldquo;evergreening,&rdquo;6 thus keeping the drug 
</p>
<p>free from competition and enabling high pricing. TRIPS further mandates that pat-
</p>
<p>ents have to be given for both products and processes in all fields of technology.7 
</p>
<p>Whereas previously, many developing countries excluded crucial sectors such as 
</p>
<p>medicines and chemicals from patentability, this is no longer an option. By vir-
</p>
<p>tue of TRIPS protection, no generic equivalent can come into the market until the 
</p>
<p>twenty years of patent protection have expired unless TRIPS flexibilities&mdash;mea-
</p>
<p>sures such as compulsory licensing or parallel importation of drugs, exceptions 
</p>
<p>to patent rights, exclusions from patentability, and transition periods&mdash;are used,8 
</p>
<p>thus denying patients cheaper alternatives.
</p>
<p> While the situation was problematic prior to 2005, it is anticipated that it will 
</p>
<p>worsen in the years to come. M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) is already talking 
</p>
<p>about the &ldquo;return of the price crisis&rdquo; that was seen in 2000, when life-saving anti-
</p>
<p>retrovirals were priced out of reach of those in need. For example, introducing 
</p>
<p>more recent drugs in anti-AIDS combination therapy because of the emergence 
</p>
<p>of resistance to older treatment would today increase the annual cost of treating 
</p>
<p>an adult for one year in a developing country from $99 to $426. Since everyone in 
</p>
<p>therapy today is expected to need these newer therapies at some point, the escala-
</p>
<p>tion in cost will have dire consequences for AIDS programs.
</p>
<p> The main reason why cheaper generic alternatives were possible for older 
</p>
<p>antiretroviral products is that there were no patents in some developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries with vibrant generic pharmaceutical industries. India, for example, was free </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the doha declaration 143
</p>
<p>from product patents for medicines used to manufacture and supply generic medi-
</p>
<p>cines to the rest of the world. However, beginning in 2005, India, known as the 
</p>
<p>pharmacy of the world, has had to comply with its TRIPS obligations and permit 
</p>
<p>the patenting of pharmaceutical products. Therefore, the possibility of supplying 
</p>
<p>affordable generic medicines in the future for new drugs seems rather bleak.9
</p>
<p> Such concerns about TRIPS and its overall impact on access to affordable 
</p>
<p>medicines sparked an international debate. Public-health crises afflicting many 
</p>
<p>countries in the developing world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and the 
</p>
<p>strong-arming of developing countries by developed countries fuelled the debate, 
</p>
<p>focusing intense public attention on the manner in which intellectual property 
</p>
<p>protection affected people&rsquo;s lives and governments&rsquo; ability to take measures to 
</p>
<p>protect public health.
</p>
<p>the doha negotiations
</p>
<p>The TRIPS Agreement is the result of a process of intense negotiations during the 
</p>
<p>Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It thus reflects an 
</p>
<p>uneasy, delicate compromise between the developed countries, which sought high 
</p>
<p>levels of intellectual property protection, and the developing countries, which 
</p>
<p>sought to ensure that a degree of flexibility or policy autonomy was retained in 
</p>
<p>interpreting and implementing TRIPS. Initially, the developing countries resisted 
</p>
<p>inclusion of an agreement on intellectual property protection as part of the WTO 
</p>
<p>agreements, but later accepted it in exchange for gains they hoped to obtain in 
</p>
<p>other areas, such as agriculture.10
</p>
<p> Thus, during implementation of the agreement, the differing socioeconomic and 
</p>
<p>political interests of the WTO members resulted in differing interpretations of cer-
</p>
<p>tain provisions in the TRIPS Agreement, leading to tensions between the develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries, which wished to make use of flexibilities such as compulsory licens-
</p>
<p>ing, parallel importation,11 and so on for purposes of improving access to affordable 
</p>
<p>medicines, and the major developed countries, as well as their pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>industries, which did not wish to see the developing countries exercise their rights.
</p>
<p> As a result of these tensions, in February 1998, the South Africa Pharmaceu-
</p>
<p>tical Manufacturers Association and thirty-nine other pharmaceutical manu-
</p>
<p>facturers, mostly multinational, brought a lawsuit against the South African 
</p>
<p>government for allegedly violating the TRIPS Agreement and the South African 
</p>
<p>Constitution. The government had introduced an amendment to its 1997 Medicines 
</p>
<p>and Related Substances Control Act to include provisions such as the substitu-
</p>
<p>tion of generics for out-of-patent medicines, as well as transparent pricing and  
</p>
<p>parallel importation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>144
</p>
<p> Activists worldwide, led by the South African Treatment Action Campaign, an 
</p>
<p>AIDS activist organization, rallied in support of the South African government. To 
</p>
<p>protest against the lawsuit, these activists held rallies in different key cities, sent 
</p>
<p>letters to the plaintiffs in the South African lawsuit and other influential officials, 
</p>
<p>made joint statements, and held press conferences condemning the industry&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>attempt to derail implementation of the Medicines Act and demanding that the 
</p>
<p>companies withdraw the lawsuit.
</p>
<p> Various other groups also mounted direct-action campaigns against the compa-
</p>
<p>nies. For example, activists from ACT UP New York, ACT UP Philadelphia, and the 
</p>
<p>Health GAP (Global Access Project) Coalition occupied GlaxoSmithKline&rsquo;s investor-
</p>
<p>relations office in Manhattan, using chains to lock down the office.12 GlaxoSmith-
</p>
<p>Kline was a lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. The suit soon became a public-relations 
</p>
<p>nightmare for the companies, and they finally withdrew it in 2001.13 Public pres-
</p>
<p>sure also forced developed-country governments such as the United States and 
</p>
<p>those in Europe that were initially supportive of the industry&rsquo;s action to withdraw 
</p>
<p>their support.
</p>
<p> In one instance, strategically savvy AIDS activists disrupted Vice President Al 
</p>
<p>Gore&rsquo;s presidential campaign with a series of protests over his support for the U.S. 
</p>
<p>policy of pressuring countries such as South Africa not to use TRIPS flexibilities. 
</p>
<p>Demonstrations organized by ACT UP and the national coalition AIDS Drugs for 
</p>
<p>Africa saw activists waving banners dubbing the Gore 2000 campaign &ldquo;Apartheid 
</p>
<p>2000&rdquo; and declaring &ldquo;Gore&rsquo;s Greed Kills.&rdquo;14 &ldquo;On one occasion,&rdquo; Karine Cunqueiro 
</p>
<p>notes, &ldquo;demonstrators displayed a life-size marionette of Gore, the strings of which 
</p>
<p>were manipulated by effigies of drug-company executives.&rdquo;15 These actions placed 
</p>
<p>the issue in national media and on the national political scene, eventually leading 
</p>
<p>to the U.S. government&rsquo;s withdrawal of its support for the lawsuit.16
</p>
<p> In 2001, the United States initiated a complaint against Brazil in the WTO dis-
</p>
<p>pute-settlement system over Brazil&rsquo;s national law on compulsory licensing, which 
</p>
<p>included a &ldquo;local working&rdquo; requirement. Under that provision, holders of patent 
</p>
<p>rights in Brazil are required to manufacture the protected product in the country. 
</p>
<p>If companies do not follow this requirement, after three years, Brazil can issue 
</p>
<p>a compulsory license. The United States argued that the law violated the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement by discriminating against U.S. patent owners and restricting patent 
</p>
<p>holders&rsquo; rights. Brazil responded that the law was consistent with the provisions 
</p>
<p>and spirit of TRIPS, as well as with the Paris Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Industrial Property.17
</p>
<p> The complaint by the United States to the WTO was seen as a &ldquo;warning shot&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>by the Bush Administration to the developing countries that had hopes of using 
</p>
<p>the flexibilities provided by the TRIPS Agreement and South-South cooperation 
</p>
<p>shashikant</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>145
</p>
<p>to develop local pharmaceutical production capabilities and to break their depen-
</p>
<p>dence on multinational pharmaceutical companies.18 The U.S. actions brought 
</p>
<p>fierce pressure from the international NGO community concerned about the nega-
</p>
<p>tive effect of the complaint on Brazil&rsquo;s successful AIDS program and on South-
</p>
<p>South cooperation to ensure a sustainable supply of generic medicines.19 MSF 
</p>
<p>issued an international press release warning that the U.S. action at the WTO not 
</p>
<p>only threatened Brazilian AIDS policy, but would &ldquo;also intimidate countries which 
</p>
<p>would like to take up Brazil&rsquo;s offer to help them produce AIDS medicines.&rdquo;20 The 
</p>
<p>Treatment Action Campaign also issued a statement denouncing the WTO com-
</p>
<p>plaint as an attempt &ldquo;to destroy Brazil&rsquo;s generic pharmaceutical industry,&rdquo; charg-
</p>
<p>ing that &ldquo;it will not only hamper access to medicines for Brazil&rdquo;s 500,000 people 
</p>
<p>with HIV, but also many Third World countries which are hoping to import Brazil&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>cheap medicines and to accept Brazil&rsquo;s offer of knowledge transfer.&rdquo;21 The US with-
</p>
<p>drew the complaint in June 2001.
</p>
<p> These events are only two of the more prominent manifestations of the con-
</p>
<p>flicts arising from differing interpretations of the TRIPS provisions and from 
</p>
<p>political and economic pressure asserted by the United States and other devel-
</p>
<p>oped countries against developing countries to change policies in favor of their 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical industries.22 The conflicts and the vocal voice of the international 
</p>
<p>NGO community highlighted the importance of reaching a common understanding 
</p>
<p>about TRIPS and WTO members&rsquo; right to take measures to promote public health. 
</p>
<p>Pronouncements on the issue of trade and health by international organizations 
</p>
<p>such as the WHO, the UN Sub-Commission for the Protection and Promotion of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, and the United Nations Development Program also added impetus 
</p>
<p>to the movement for access to affordable medicines.23
</p>
<p> On June 20, 2001, for the first time ever, the WTO Council for TRIPS held a 
</p>
<p>special session on TRIPS and public health.24 This historic meeting was a response 
</p>
<p>to the Africa Group&rsquo;s call at the TRIPS Council to confront the problem of access to 
</p>
<p>medicines due to high prices resulting from intellectual property protection and to 
</p>
<p>discuss the interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement with a view to clarifying flexibilities by which members are entitled to 
</p>
<p>gain access to medicines. Fifty developing countries put forward a joint paper pre-
</p>
<p>senting their common legal understanding of some of the TRIPS Agreement&rsquo;s key 
</p>
<p>provisions (that is, its objectives, principles, nature, and scope), and of the agree-
</p>
<p>ment&rsquo;s requirements for the protection of undisclosed information and patent flex-
</p>
<p>ibilities such as compulsory licensing and parallel importation.25 Such an initiative 
</p>
<p>was a key move in a context in which, on a regular basis through the press and by 
</p>
<p>other means, the developed countries and pharmaceutical companies were misrep-
</p>
<p>resenting TRIPS flexibilities as much narrower than they were.
</p>
<p>the doha declaration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>146
</p>
<p> Zimbabwe, on behalf of the Africa Group, proposed that the Doha Ministe-
</p>
<p>rial Conference to be convened later in the same year issue a special declaration 
</p>
<p>to affirm a common understanding that the TRIPS Agreement does not prevent 
</p>
<p>members from taking measures to protect public health, adding that &ldquo;this assur-
</p>
<p>ance and guarantee was needed to enable governments to adopt measures to pro-
</p>
<p>tect public health, without fear of litigation, at national level or at the WTO, or 
</p>
<p>bilateral pressures being applied on them.&rdquo;26 NGO activities at national, regional, 
</p>
<p>and international levels heightened the urgency of the need to heed the call of the 
</p>
<p>developing countries. For example, on the eve of the special session, more than 
</p>
<p>one hundred NGOs, led by MSF, Oxfam, and the Third World Network, called for 
</p>
<p>a &ldquo;pro-public health&rdquo; interpretation of the TRIPS agreement and the use of TRIPS 
</p>
<p>safeguards and exceptions. Some civil-society groups in the Global South went as 
</p>
<p>far as to request that the TRIPS Agreement be taken out of the WTO.27
</p>
<p> The reaction of the developed countries at the first special session to the stance 
</p>
<p>taken by the developing countries was mixed, varying from acceptance to plain 
</p>
<p>opposition. Norway was perhaps the most supportive of the developing countries&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>positions. On the links between patents, price, and access to medicines, it recog-
</p>
<p>nized that the price of medicines &ldquo;does make a difference,&rdquo; especially in the case 
</p>
<p>of poor people in developing countries who have to pay out of pocket for health 
</p>
<p>care. It also agreed on the need for more legal clarity on the TRIPS provisions. The 
</p>
<p>US took a hard-line position that strong patent regimes can produce benefits for 
</p>
<p>developed and developing countries and refused to acknowledge the concerns of 
</p>
<p>developing countries over TRIPS implementation and access to affordable medi-
</p>
<p>cines.28 It also challenged proposals put forward by the developing countries. A 
</p>
<p>U.S. representative is reported to have said that &ldquo;as long as you cannot come up 
</p>
<p>with concrete examples, we remain unconvinced of the problem.&rdquo;29 The European 
</p>
<p>Commission agreed on a number of points put forward by the developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries. However its position was received with much skepticism by many developing 
</p>
<p>countries and NGOs, because there was concern that the issue of TRIPS and public 
</p>
<p>health would be used as part of a negotiating strategy to be traded against other 
</p>
<p>issues during the Doha Ministerial Conference. Overall one clear message of the 
</p>
<p>industrialized countries was that they would not agree to any diminution in the 
</p>
<p>TRIPS standard of intellectual property protection.30
</p>
<p> Despite the hard-line positions taken by some developed countries, determined 
</p>
<p>developing countries with support from NGOs persisted jointly in advocating for 
</p>
<p>a favorable outcome. At a meeting in September, the Africa Group, with nineteen 
</p>
<p>other developing countries, presented a draft text for a ministerial declaration on 
</p>
<p>TRIPS and public health. It proposed political principles that would ensure that 
</p>
<p>TRIPS would not undermine the legitimate right of WTO members to formulate 
</p>
<p>shashikant</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>147
</p>
<p>their own public-health policies and provided clarifications for provisions related to 
</p>
<p>compulsory licensing, parallel importation, protection of undisclosed information, 
</p>
<p>and production for export to a country with insufficient production capacity.31
</p>
<p> The United States, Japan, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada circulated an 
</p>
<p>alternate draft, stressing the importance of intellectual property protection for 
</p>
<p>research and development and arguing that intellectual property contributes to 
</p>
<p>public-health objectives globally. It further sought to limit the use of flexibilities to 
</p>
<p>crisis and emergency situations.
</p>
<p> The different proposed texts became the basis of engagement between a key 
</p>
<p>group of some twenty delegations from developing and developed countries, but 
</p>
<p>with little result. The parties repeatedly arrived at a deadlock. Major industrial-
</p>
<p>ized nations blocked language that would declare that &ldquo;nothing in the TRIPS shall 
</p>
<p>prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health&rdquo; and instead 
</p>
<p>insisted on formulations that would restrict flexibilities available to the developing 
</p>
<p>countries.32 The deadlock continued into the Doha Ministerial Conference, because 
</p>
<p>the developing countries refused to be fobbed off with a declaration that had no 
</p>
<p>value added and that in fact sought to restrict or to reduce the currently available 
</p>
<p>flexibilities.33
</p>
<p> During the Doha preparatory meetings, the United States and others (often 
</p>
<p>sounded out for compromise by the WTO Secretariat), proposed language to the 
</p>
<p>effect that the declaration would be &ldquo;without prejudice to the rights&rdquo; or would 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;preserve the rights&rdquo; or should not be construed as &ldquo;adding to or diminishing the 
</p>
<p>rights&rdquo; of the developed countries under the TRIPS Agreement for fear that the 
</p>
<p>declaration could lead to changes in TRIPS. Key developing-country negotiators 
</p>
<p>felt that if these terms were accepted, it would make &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; of the declara-
</p>
<p>tion.34 In the final agreed-upon text of the declaration, none of these elements are 
</p>
<p>included. From the beginning, the aim of the developing countries was to obtain 
</p>
<p>recognition that nothing in the TRIPS Agreement should be interpreted as pre-
</p>
<p>venting members from adopting measures necessary to protect public health.35 
</p>
<p>They were frustrated by the opposition and pressure exerted on the developing 
</p>
<p>countries by the pharmaceutical industry of the developed countries, backed by 
</p>
<p>their governments.
</p>
<p> NGOs such as MSF, Oxfam, and the Third World Network also kept pressure on 
</p>
<p>the industrialized countries, charging them with echoing the views of the pharma-
</p>
<p>ceutical companies and with frustrating developing-country efforts at the WTO to 
</p>
<p>improve access to medicines in poor countries.36
</p>
<p> The chair of the WTO General Council, Stuart Harbinson, presented a text with 
</p>
<p>two options, which became the basis for Doha negotiations. The first option:
</p>
<p>the doha declaration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>148
</p>
<p>Nothing in the TRIPS Agreement shall prevent Members from taking measures to 
</p>
<p>protect public health. Accordingly, while reiterating our commitment to the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement, we affirm that the Agreement shall be interpreted and implemented in a 
</p>
<p>manner supportive of WTO Members&rsquo; right to protect public health and, in particu-
</p>
<p>lar, to ensure access to medicines for all.
</p>
<p> In this connection, we reaffirm the right of WTO Members to use, to the full, the 
</p>
<p>provisions in the TRIPS Agreement which provide flexibility for this purpose.
</p>
<p>The second option:
</p>
<p>We affirm a Member&rsquo;s ability to use, to the full, the provisions in the TRIPS Agree-
</p>
<p>ment which provide flexibility to address public health crises such as HIV/AIDS and 
</p>
<p>other pandemics, and to that end, that a Member is able to take measures neces-
</p>
<p>sary to address these public health crises, in particular to secure affordable access 
</p>
<p>to medicines. Further, we agree that this Declaration does not add to or diminish the 
</p>
<p>rights and obligations of Members provided in the TRIPS Agreement. With a view to 
</p>
<p>facilitating the use of this flexibility by providing greater certainty, we agree on the 
</p>
<p>following clarifications.
</p>
<p>The first option was widely supported by the developing countries and public-
</p>
<p>interest civil-society groups. The United States, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, 
</p>
<p>Canada, Korea, and some other developed countries supported the second option, 
</p>
<p>because they viewed the first one as attempting to override the TRIPS rules.37
</p>
<p> The second option, while seemingly meeting public-health concerns, reduces 
</p>
<p>the rights of member countries to take actions on grounds of public health by 
</p>
<p>narrowing those rights only to situations of &ldquo;pandemics,&rdquo; which health special-
</p>
<p>ists describe as diseases that are universal or affect populations across countries 
</p>
<p>and continents. However, the position of the Western countries was hard to main-
</p>
<p>tain for very long in light of the fact that prior to the Doha Ministerial Confer-
</p>
<p>ence, Canada and United States had threatened to override Bayer AG&rsquo;s patent on 
</p>
<p>the antibiotic ciprofloxacine (Cipro&trade;) to deal with the shortage and high price of 
</p>
<p>the product following letter-born anthrax attacks in 2001.38	Brazil, India, and the 
</p>
<p>Africa Group used the occasion to argue that they should be allowed the same 
</p>
<p>discretion when it came to patented drugs for AIDS and other diseases. Health 
</p>
<p>activists took the opportunity to highlight the hypocrisy and double standards of 
</p>
<p>industrialized countries.39
</p>
<p> After days of negotiation in Doha, members settled on a compromise text, 
</p>
<p>which now forms paragraph 4 of the Doha Declaration:40
</p>
<p>We agree that the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent Members  
</p>
<p>from taking measures to protect public health. Accordingly, while reiterating our 
</p>
<p>shashikant</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>149
</p>
<p>commitment to the TRIPS Agreement, we affirm that the Agreement can and should 
</p>
<p>be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members&rsquo; right to 
</p>
<p>protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all.
</p>
<p> In this connection, we reaffirm the right of WTO members to use, to the full, the 
</p>
<p>provisions in the TRIPS Agreement, which provide flexibility for this purpose.
</p>
<p>The second part of the paragraph confirms one of the key points pushed by the 
</p>
<p>developing countries: that in implementing the TRIPS Agreement at the national 
</p>
<p>level, there is flexibility, and thus room to maneuver, to meet public health needs.
</p>
<p> In the context of paragraph 4, the declaration then goes on to reaffirm coun-
</p>
<p>tries&rsquo; right to grant compulsory licenses, as well as &ldquo;the freedom to determine the 
</p>
<p>grounds upon which such licenses are granted,&rdquo; including &ldquo;the right to determine 
</p>
<p>what constitutes a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>both of which are grounds for issuing compulsory licenses. It adds, &ldquo;public health 
</p>
<p>crises, including those relating to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epi-
</p>
<p>demics, can represent a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme 
</p>
<p>urgency.&rdquo; It also reaffirms the right of members freely to establish their regimes for 
</p>
<p>defining when the rights of a holder of intellectual property are exhausted.41
</p>
<p> An issue that was not resolved in Doha, but that the Doha Declaration acknowl-
</p>
<p>edges, is the problem of WTO members with insufficient or no manufacturing 
</p>
<p>capacities in the pharmaceutical sector facing difficulties in making effective use of 
</p>
<p>compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement.42 The problem, which has since 
</p>
<p>come to be known as the &ldquo;paragraph 6 problem,&rdquo; is that most developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries have inadequate or no manufacturing capacity, and those that do, once they 
</p>
<p>implemented the TRIPS Agreement in 2005 (due to the expiration of the transition 
</p>
<p>period) and thus allowed the patenting of pharmaceuticals, would not be able to 
</p>
<p>meet the needs of other countries. This was because of a condition in the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement that when a compulsory license is issued, the license shall be predomi-
</p>
<p>nantly for domestic supply,43 thus restricting the amount that may be exported.
</p>
<p> Discussion on the solution to the paragraph 6 problem was the subject of heated 
</p>
<p>debates in the WTO between 2001 and 2005.44 Although the matter was eventu-
</p>
<p>ally resolved in 2003 through a WTO decision of August 30, 2003,45 which later, in 
</p>
<p>2005,46 was accepted by WTO members as an amendment to the TRIPS Agreement, 
</p>
<p>the solution agreed to by member states has been criticized severely by public-
</p>
<p>health groups for being burdensome to both exporting and importing countries.47
</p>
<p> A major achievement, however was the agreement not to limit the declara-
</p>
<p>tion to a list of diseases. The final text recognizes &ldquo;the gravity of the public health 
</p>
<p>problems afflicting many developing and least-developed countries, especially 
</p>
<p>those resulting from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics.&rdquo;48
</p>
<p>the doha declaration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>150
</p>
<p> There were other victories for the developing countries in the declaration, as 
</p>
<p>well. It extended the transition period for least-developed countries, so that they 
</p>
<p>did not have to implement provisions on patent protection for pharmaceuticals 
</p>
<p>and protection of undisclosed information until 2016, without prejudice to the 
</p>
<p>right to seek other extensions.49 Initially, the deadline for the transition period for 
</p>
<p>least-developed countries was 2006. It also recognized concerns about the effects 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property rights on prices, although on the insistence of developed 
</p>
<p>countries, a statement about the importance of the intellectual property system 
</p>
<p>prefaces the acknowledgement.
</p>
<p>the role of ngos in the access debate
</p>
<p>It is undeniable that campaigning by the NGO community contributed signifi-
</p>
<p>cantly to greater awareness and heightened discussion about TRIPS and its effects 
</p>
<p>on access to affordable medicines and to the Doha outcome on TRIPS and public 
</p>
<p>health. In fact, one factor that led to the developing countries forming a coalition 
</p>
<p>and making demands in the WTO was NGO activism and lobbying, as well as the 
</p>
<p>media publicity surrounding the issue of access.
</p>
<p> NGOs raised awareness internationally about high drug prices, about the 
</p>
<p>reduced availability of quality generic alternatives, about inadequate research 
</p>
<p>and development into tropical diseases, about bilateral pressures on the devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries to adopt patent protection that would exceed the TRIPS require-
</p>
<p>ments, and about the double standards practiced by the developed countries, as 
</p>
<p>well as the bullying tactics of the pharmaceutical industry and several developed 
</p>
<p>countries. They drew attention to TRIPS provisions that could be used to increase 
</p>
<p>access, debunked myths put forward by the pharmaceutical industry and the 
</p>
<p>developed countries, and shamed individuals, entities, and even countries that 
</p>
<p>stood in the way of better access to affordable medicines for people living in 
</p>
<p>developing countries.
</p>
<p> In March 1999, in Geneva, NGOs (the Consumer Project on Technology, Health 
</p>
<p>Action International, and MSF) organized the first international meeting specifi-
</p>
<p>cally on the use of compulsory licensing to increase access to AIDS medicines.50 
</p>
<p>Later, in November, the same group organized Increasing Access to Essential Drugs 
</p>
<p>in a Globalized Economy, a conference in Amsterdam that brought together 350 par-
</p>
<p>ticipants from fifty countries on the eve of the Seattle WTO Ministerial Conference. 
</p>
<p>Another significant event was the Oxfam workshop on TRIPS in Brussels in March 
</p>
<p>2001, which was attended by NGOs, experts, and diplomats.
</p>
<p> These meetings are a part of many other important collaborative initiatives by 
</p>
<p>national and international advocates from the Global North and South, such as 
</p>
<p>shashikant</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>151
</p>
<p>the Consumer Project on Technology, MSF, Oxfam, Act Up&ndash;Paris, Health GAP, the 
</p>
<p>South African Treatment Action Campaign, the Third World Network, and others 
</p>
<p>to raise awareness about concerns regarding TRIPS and to call for urgent action 
</p>
<p>by WTO members. These meetings created awareness among NGOs and diplomats 
</p>
<p>from Geneva, mobilized a variety of NGOs around the issue of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty and access to medicines, and fostered a common NGO front.
</p>
<p> Information disseminated by NGOs helped counter claims by the pharmaceu-
</p>
<p>tical industry and by industry-funded entities, as well as by developed-country 
</p>
<p>governments; provided concrete arguments, as well as examples, concerning the 
</p>
<p>threat posed by patents to access to affordable medicines, and raised awareness of 
</p>
<p>the available flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, which proved invaluable, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly in launching the access issue in the WTO and in the run-up to the Doha 
</p>
<p>Declaration.
</p>
<p> MSF issued a report on market and public-policy failures leading to research-
</p>
<p>and-development spending by the pharmaceutical industry on rich-country 
</p>
<p>lifestyle preoccupations (obesity, impotence, etc.) or me-too drugs (medicines 
</p>
<p>with very slight difference over existing compounds and involving no &lsquo;inven-
</p>
<p>tion&rsquo; or clinical advance) and a virtually empty pipeline of drugs for neglected 
</p>
<p>diseases, thus countering claims that intellectual property protection encour-
</p>
<p>ages innovation and research into diseases and availability of medicines.51 
</p>
<p>This graph shows the impact of the introduction of generic medicines on drug prices (M&eacute;decins Sans 
</p>
<p>Fronti&egrave;res, &ldquo;Untangling the web of price reductions&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>the doha declaration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>152
</p>
<p>Oxfam provided a briefing paper showing how the TRIPS rules would raise 
</p>
<p>the costs of vital medicines, with potentially disastrous implications for  
</p>
<p>poor countries.52
</p>
<p> NGOs also argued that the majority of important HIV/AIDS drugs were actu-
</p>
<p>ally developed by the public National Institutes of Health and funded by taxpay-
</p>
<p>ers&rsquo; dollars,53 and by way of concrete examples, they showed the threat of patents 
</p>
<p>to access to affordable medicines,54 rebutting claims that companies spend $500 
</p>
<p>to $800 million to develop a drug and that patents are not an important barrier to 
accessing antiretroviral drugs in African countries.55
</p>
<p> To keep up the pressure on the developed countries that were taking a hard 
</p>
<p>position during Doha negotiations, NGOs issued sign-on statements supporting 
</p>
<p>developing-country positions, mobilized media to investigate the issue of patents 
</p>
<p>and access and to write about it, and &ldquo;named and shamed&rdquo; countries, individu-
</p>
<p>als, companies and any other entity that stood in the way of access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>Through actions such as phone calls, e-mails, and faxes, NGOs also repeatedly 
</p>
<p>placed pressure on the WTO Secretariat and its then director general, Mike Moore, 
</p>
<p>to acknowledge the right of developing countries to make use of the TRIPS flex-
</p>
<p>ibilities. NGO actions grabbed media attention and created waves that Southern 
</p>
<p>and Northern governments simply could not ignore. Developed countries learned 
</p>
<p>that they could not get away with exerting trade pressures on developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries or taking unfavorable positions without feeling repercussions, particularly 
</p>
<p>back in their home countries.56 The campaigns also had some effect in persuading 
</p>
<p>developed countries such as the members of the European Commission to rethink 
</p>
<p>the proindustry stance they had taken.57
</p>
<p> The developing countries also relied substantially on the input and expertise 
</p>
<p>of some civil-society groups in the formulation of papers and arguments for dis-
</p>
<p>cussion and the drafting of texts during negotiations. The influence of documents 
</p>
<p>prepared by civil-society groups led the United States to remark during the special 
</p>
<p>session that members should &ldquo;avoid documents circulated by other individuals and 
</p>
<p>organisations that lack the WTO&rsquo;s expertise.&rdquo;58 Without a doubt, close collabora-
</p>
<p>tion between civil-society groups and developing countries before and during the 
</p>
<p>Doha Ministerial Conference was a pivotal factor in the success achieved there.
</p>
<p>conclusion: the significance of the doha declaration
</p>
<p>The Doha Declaration represents a major political victory for the developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries. Although it is only a political statement and does not modify the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement in any way, it has important legal implications. It provides an under-
</p>
<p>standing of the purpose of the TRIPS Agreement in relation to public-health issues 
</p>
<p>shashikant</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>153
</p>
<p>that should guide any future rulings by WTO dispute-resolution panels dealing 
</p>
<p>with such issues.59 The declaration gave developing-country governments a degree 
</p>
<p>of security in adopting national-level measures necessary to meet public-health 
</p>
<p>objectives, and several developing countries, such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indo-
</p>
<p>nesia, Brazil, Zimbabwe, and Ghana, have since taken advantage of compulsory 
</p>
<p>licensing to gain access to affordable generic medicines.60 Many countries have 
</p>
<p>also amended their laws to include the various TRIPS flexibilities.
</p>
<p> To the NGO community, despite the disappointment that the outcome was not 
</p>
<p>as strong or as legally binding as they had expected, the declaration was a big step 
</p>
<p>forward in the battle for affordable medicines. Today, the declaration has become 
</p>
<p>a common rallying platform for NGOs in persuading developing-country govern-
</p>
<p>ments to take action to access affordable medicines and in holding developed-
</p>
<p>country governments accountable for what they agreed to in Doha, particularly 
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking 
</p>
<p>measures to protect public health&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the Agreement can and should be 
</p>
<p>interpreted to protect public health and in particular, to promote access to medi-
</p>
<p>cines for all.&rdquo; The declaration is also invoked systematically by NGOs, policy mak-
</p>
<p>ers, and others to counter developed countries&rsquo; actions to pressure developing 
</p>
<p>countries through trade, partnership, and investment agreements and their unilat-
</p>
<p>eral pressures to adopt intellectual property standards that go beyond the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement.
</p>
<p> The Doha Declaration was adopted for many reasons. However, a particularly 
</p>
<p>notable reason is that a cohesive group of developing countries emerged to articu-
</p>
<p>late their concerns about the effects of the TRIPS Agreement on access to medi-
</p>
<p>cines and to advocate a common position. These countries were well prepared, and 
</p>
<p>with the support of NGOs, which maintained continuous pressure on the inter-
</p>
<p>national community to do something concrete, mounted a strong case for urgent 
</p>
<p>action in the WTO to address the TRIPS drugs issue and an interpretation of the 
</p>
<p>TRIPS Agreement that enables national public-health measures.
</p>
<p> The declaration evinces the possibility of winning a significant victory by 
</p>
<p>advocates of access to knowledge, even in the face of strong opposition, when alli-
</p>
<p>ances are formed among developing countries and with concerned NGOs on major 
</p>
<p>public-policy issues that need attention. The strategies and tactics used by NGOs 
</p>
<p>and developing countries in the access debate, the collaboration between NGO 
</p>
<p>groups from the Global North and the Global South, and the strategic collaboration 
</p>
<p>between NGOs and developing countries provide very useful guidance and insight 
</p>
<p>for those working on other issues in the access to knowledge movement.

<p>trips_e/t_agm0_e.htm (last accessed March 22, 2009). Three transition periods are pro-
</p>
<p>vided for in the Agreement: the period from 1995 to 2000, at the end of which developing 
</p>
<p>countries were obliged to implement the TRIPS Agreement; the period from 2000 to 2005, 
</p>
<p>which provided an additional period of five years in which to put in place product patent 
</p>
<p>protection for pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals in those countries without such protection 
</p>
<p>at the entry into force of the agreement; and the period from 1995 to 2006, after which least-
</p>
<p>developed countries would be required to implement their TRIPS obligations (Articles 65 and 
</p>
<p>66 of TRIPS Agreement). Presently only least-developed countries have transition periods 
</p>
<p>after an additional extension was allowed in 2001. That is, a least-developed country need 
</p>
<p>not apply TRIPS provisions until July 1, 2013 or until it ceases to be a least-developed coun-
</p>
<p>try, if that period is shorter than the former; and least-developed countries do not have to

</p>
<p>ment to allow the use of patented inventions without the consent of the patent holder. It is one 
</p>
<p>of the flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement. Parallel importation is the importation and resale 
</p>
<p>in a country without the consent of the patent holder of a patented product that has been 
</p>
<p>legitimately put on the market of the exporting country under a parallel patent. For example, if 
</p>
<p>a patented antiretroviral cost $5.00 per tablet in Country X and the same patented medicine is 
</p>
<p>sold in Country Y for $1.00 per tablet, then Country X could parallel import from Country Y the 
</p>
<p>same medicine, since it is cheaper, and do so without the consent of the patent holder.

<p>24 The Council for TRIPS is a body within the WTO open to all WTO members and responsible 
</p>
<p>for administering the TRIPS Agreement.
</p>
<p>25 Drug regulatory authorities usually require pharmaceutical companies to submit data demon-
</p>
<p>strating the safety, quality, and efficacy (collectively known as &ldquo;test data&rdquo;) of a pharmaceuti-
</p>
<p>cal product as a condition for permitting the marketing of it. However, there are different 
</p>
<p>opinions as to the obligation that the TRIPS Agreement places on countries with respect to 
</p>
<p>the protection of test data. Article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement requires members to provide 
</p>
<p>protection against &ldquo;unfair commercial use&rdquo; for undisclosed test or other data submitted for 
</p>
<p>the purposes of obtaining marketing approval. Proponents of higher standards of protection 
</p>
<p>argue that Article 39.3 requires the granting of exclusive rights over test data. This approach 
</p>
<p>would prevent regulatory authorities from registering generic medicines on the basis of the 
</p>
<p>test data provided by the originator companies and thus would hamper access to affordable

<p>Student demonstration against software patents in Belgium, May 2005.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>On July 6, 2005, the European Parliament voted by a large majority to reject the 
</p>
<p>Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions proposed by 
</p>
<p>the European Commission Internal Market directorate-general.1 This event marked 
</p>
<p>a milestone in the access to knowledge movement: For the first time, it obtained 
</p>
<p>a major political decision after a mass mobilization of citizens and civil-society 
</p>
<p>groups and a wide-ranging open debate reaching well beyond the action of spe-
</p>
<p>cialized NGOs.
</p>
<p> Software plays an essential role in many activities and fields of technology and 
</p>
<p>science. Europe&rsquo;s legal recognition of software patents would have represented a 
</p>
<p>very severe blow to the existence of a freely usable common body of knowledge.2
</p>
<p> Software is information, expressed in a formal language, about how to process 
</p>
<p>information. A computer program is a form of mathematical statement, and it is so 
</p>
<p>regardless of whether it is used in a computerized pasta machine, for text process-
</p>
<p>ing, or to compute some exotic sort of number. Software has opened a new world 
</p>
<p>of information processing that has deeply transformed human activities: thought, 
</p>
<p>expression, communication, and creation. It has also changed the conditions of inno-
</p>
<p>vation in many fields of technology. Technology still deals with what Richard Stall-
</p>
<p>man has called &ldquo;the perversity of matter&rdquo;: the fact that material things break, heat 
</p>
<p>up, wear out, are hard to manufacture consistently, and can be combined one with 
</p>
<p>the other only at a very limited scale and with careful planning.3 But these core tech-
</p>
<p>nological challenges have been localized, broken down into their components. Their 
</p>
<p>physical complexity has been confined. Some technical objects can be &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; to 
</p>
<p>information-processing modules taking their input from receivers and sending their 
</p>
<p>output to simple effectors. Sometimes, though, material, energetic, biological, or 
</p>
<p>systemic complexity resists such reduction. These are the most important technical 
</p>
<p>challenges in environmental or biological innovation, for instance. For example, a

</p>
<p>seed is more that just genetic material&mdash;it is also an environment in which the genes 
</p>
<p>will be expressed and in which the future plant will start developing.
</p>
<p> The case for patents as an incentive to innovation and the effects of grant-
</p>
<p>ing them are radically different in the information domain and in the physical 
</p>
<p>domain. Information-domain patents (software patents, genetic-information pat-
</p>
<p>ents) lead to monopolies on the free reproduction of information and to arbitrary 
</p>
<p>prices completely disconnected from production and even research costs. Actually, 
</p>
<p>in the software domain, even much narrower monopolies, such as copyright, lead 
</p>
<p>to extreme dominant positions when they are combined with network effects. In 
</p>
<p>such cases, the effect of patents is to cement these monopolies. Because innova-
</p>
<p>tion in software is combinatorial (combining components) and incremental (refin-
</p>
<p>ing functionality) and often results from transferring an idea from one domain to 
</p>
<p>another, software patents block future innovation and its dissemination by creat-
</p>
<p>ing patent thickets&mdash;accumulations of patents through which an innovator can no 
</p>
<p>longer find a possible way to create an innovation without infringing on patents.4 
</p>
<p>In contrast, for mechanical devices or chemical processes, patents can be worked 
</p>
<p>around, and this often results in new ways of dealing with material challenges.
</p>
<p> Described at this general level, information-domain patents are excellent for 
</p>
<p>rent seekers, but useless, at best, and harmful most often, for innovation and access 
</p>
<p>to knowledge. However, the promoters of software patents are not found only in 
</p>
<p>pure-information industries such as proprietary software. Industry or research labs 
</p>
<p>that are active in mixed domains, such as consumer electronics or mobile-phone 
</p>
<p>devices, would like to have the best of both worlds: the plasticity and ease of inno-
</p>
<p>vating in the software domain and the patent protection that has been judged use-
</p>
<p>ful for material objects. They have summarized this view in a formula: &ldquo;Why would 
</p>
<p>it be impossible for us to patent a phone or hi-fi, now that there is plenty of soft-
</p>
<p>ware in it, when we were able to patent it before?&rdquo; But what exactly do they want 
</p>
<p>to patent? Is it the phone&rsquo;s physical components&mdash;for instance antennas, which 
</p>
<p>remain necessary in software radio and whose patentability is not disputed&mdash;or 
</p>
<p>a piece of software for the digital generation of a sine curve that is a pure math-
</p>
<p>ematical method used in hundreds of fields other than telephony?5 This distinction 
</p>
<p>became the nexus of the software-patents debate, and one of the most surpris-
</p>
<p>ing outcomes of the debate was to see a few members of the European Parliament 
</p>
<p>becoming able to argue in detail with industry lobbyists on such complex issues.
</p>
<p> In July 2005, after the vote to reject the proposed directive on patentability, 
</p>
<p>there were shouts of victory from many sides. The almost unanimous vote was 
</p>
<p>obtained by a mix of antisoftware-patent votes and prosoftware-patent votes. The 
</p>
<p>former were pleased to reject the directive, since it did not appear possible to obtain 
</p>
<p>majority for a text that would make a clear and updated statement that software </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the 2005 rejection of software patents 163
</p>
<p>and software-based information-processing methods are not patentable. The latter 
</p>
<p>were resigned to rejecting the directive when it became clear that a prosoftware-
</p>
<p>patent text would never obtain majority. There is little doubt that at least the vote 
</p>
<p>was a defeat for those who wanted to turn the practice of the European Patent 
</p>
<p>Office of granting patents on software and software-based information-processing 
</p>
<p>methods into law. However, the situation after this vote is one of great uncertainty, 
</p>
<p>since the practice remains. This essay intends to help the reader understand what 
</p>
<p>made possible this outcome and where things stand today in Europe.
</p>
<p>battles over software patentability prior to 2005
</p>
<p>To do so, we need to begin with a bit of perspective.6 Ten years before the vote of 
</p>
<p>July 6, 2005, the European Parliament had already rejected a directive extending 
</p>
<p>the scope of patentability. On March 1, 1995, the European Parliament rejected by 
</p>
<p>240 votes to 188 (with 23 abstaining) a directive that permitted the patenting of 
</p>
<p>gene sequences and of organisms that contain modified or otherwise patentable 
</p>
<p>gene sequences. However, it took only three years for this victory to be reversed, 
</p>
<p>with the adoption of Directive 98/44 by the European Parliament in 1998. During 
</p>
<p>these three years, an innovative combination of lobbying techniques was put in 
</p>
<p>place by industry players, a mix of agrifood biotech and pharma biotech compa-
</p>
<p>nies that were interested in gene-sequence patentability.7
</p>
<p> Part of the innovation in these efforts lay in the use of new forms of rhetoric. 
</p>
<p>In the drafting of legal documents, the normative form is to define the scope of a 
</p>
<p>permission or an interdiction by a sequence of alternate statements such as &ldquo;Free-
</p>
<p>dom of expression is a fundamental right, however, its exercise can be restricted 
</p>
<p>by judicial authorities based on established reasons of national security or the pro-
</p>
<p>tection of persons.&rdquo; When this form of legal discourse is used, the substance lies 
</p>
<p>in the second provision. Directive 98/44 used this normative form by first stat-
</p>
<p>ing that human gene sequences are not patentable inventions, because they are 
</p>
<p>discoveries, but then claiming that they are patentable &ldquo;when they are isolated 
</p>
<p>from the human body or otherwise produced by means of a technical process.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Because any gene sequence that is known is always isolated or otherwise produced 
</p>
<p>by a technical process, this amounted to saying: &ldquo;Human gene sequences are not 
</p>
<p>patentable inventions, but are patentable inventions.&rdquo; Opponents denounced this 
</p>
<p>rhetoric as analogous to Orwellian Newspeak, but were unable to prevent the 
</p>
<p>directive from being adopted. However, civil-society groups quickly developed the 
</p>
<p>ability to detect such rhetorical sleights-of-hand, and they were quick to detect its 
</p>
<p>repeated use in the 2002 proposal for a directive on the patentability of computer-
</p>
<p>implemented inventions, in which the term &ldquo;computer-implemented inventions,&rdquo; a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>164
</p>
<p>neologism, was defined as referring to the underlying principles of software. This 
</p>
<p>allowed those who drafted the proposal to say, in effect, &ldquo;Software or algorithms 
</p>
<p>remain unpatentable, but they can be patented under the name of computer-
</p>
<p>implemented inventions.&rdquo; Such Orwellian tactics were successful, however, and 
</p>
<p>efforts to promote the patentability of software continued in Europe right up to 
</p>
<p>the victory of patentability opponents in 2005.
</p>
<p> Software patents were progressively recognized in the United States from the 
</p>
<p>end of the 1980s on and became common in the 1990s.8 The European Patent Office 
</p>
<p>(EPO) therefore was subjected to increasing pressure from its customers to align 
</p>
<p>the European practice with the U.S. standard of patenting software.9 However, 
</p>
<p>there existed a major obstacle to such an alignment: the provision in Article 52 of 
</p>
<p>the European Patent Convention (EPC) that lists a number of things that cannot be 
</p>
<p>patented because they are not inventions,10 including computer programs, math-
</p>
<p>ematical methods, and business methods, etc. In a series of cases (IBM 1997 and 
</p>
<p>1998, Philips 2000), the EPC therefore used its in-house Chamber of Appeal to cre-
</p>
<p>ate surrealistic case law that was soon incorporated in its examination guidelines. 
</p>
<p>This case law used Article 52(3) of the EPC, which states that the exclusion from 
</p>
<p>patentability applies only to the excluded entities &ldquo;as such.&rdquo; It claimed that the 
</p>
<p>excluded entities could be patented if they had &ldquo;a technical effect&rdquo; or if &ldquo;technical 
</p>
<p>considerations&rdquo; were necessary to produce them.11 According to this new case law, 
</p>
<p>tens of thousands of software patents were granted by the EPO.12
</p>
<p> However this home-made case law was fragile, since there is good evidence 
</p>
<p>from managers of the EPO themselves that the EPC wording in the case of software 
</p>
<p>was meant only to declare that a physical invention could still be patented, whether 
</p>
<p>or not it contained software.13 The EPO and its representatives within the European 
</p>
<p>Commission consequently proceeded to make the law more explicitly favor patent-
</p>
<p>ability in accordance with practice by working along two parallel tracks.14
</p>
<p> The first one was to hold a diplomatic conference for deleting the inconvenient 
</p>
<p>exclusions from the EPC.15 The initial proposal simply deleted all exclusions from 
</p>
<p>patentability, including, for instance, exclusions for games or methods of teaching. 
</p>
<p>After some debate developed, it was proposed to delete only the exclusion of com-
</p>
<p>puter programs. However, from the end of 1998 on, NGOs advocating for free or 
</p>
<p>open-source software started alerting decision makers about the risks of software 
</p>
<p>patentability for the freedom to innovate in software. This debate had reached a 
</p>
<p>sufficient scale by 2000, when the diplomatic conference was held in Munich, to 
</p>
<p>motivate national delegates to refuse to amend the convention until progress had 
</p>
<p>to be made along the second track: producing European legislation on the patent-
</p>
<p>ability of software. The then fifteen countries of the European Union voted four-
</p>
<p>teen to one against deleting the exclusion . . . for the time being.

</p>
<p> The proposal for a directive then was prepared by a number of steps that had 
</p>
<p>been initiated from 1996 on. A green book on the future of patents in Europe was dis-
</p>
<p>cussed,16 mostly in specialized patent circles. In 1997, the European Commission pub-
</p>
<p>lished a communication on the follow-up to the green book that included an explicit 
</p>
<p>mention of a directive to come. Until 1998, almost no software practitioners were 
</p>
<p>involved in the debate. (The only one speaking at the London conference on March 
</p>
<p>23, 1998, took a clear stand against any form of software patentability.) However, 
</p>
<p>from 1998 on, developers of free and open-source software, small and medium-sized 
</p>
<p>shareware enterprises, and a number of academics started to alert the public and 
</p>
<p>decision makers about the risks of accepting patents on software. These concerns 
</p>
<p>were relayed within the European Commission by the Information Society general-
</p>
<p>directorate. A lively internal debate echoed the external debate that was developing 
</p>
<p>in Europe. A provisional compromise was struck between the relevant commission-
</p>
<p>ers: A new consultation of stakeholders and citizens would be launched on October 
</p>
<p>19, 2000. In parallel, some European Union members states such as the UK initiated 
</p>
<p>a consultation of their own, while others, such as Germany, commissioned studies, 
</p>
<p>and still others, such as France, created committees that were asked to recommend a 
</p>
<p>policy.
</p>
<p> The biased manner in which the Internal Market general-directorate handled 
</p>
<p>the analysis of opinions submitted in answer to its consultation did a lot to weaken 
</p>
<p>its case. The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, an NGO dedicated 
</p>
<p>to keeping innovation open in the software field, had asked stakeholders to trans-
</p>
<p>mit their opinion through them. This was an answer to the fact that the European 
</p>
<p>Commission admitted nonpublic responses to its consultation. The Internal Market 
</p>
<p>and Services directorate-general of the European Commission assigned a previ-
</p>
<p>ously unknown consultant to produce an analysis of contributions. His report dis-
</p>
<p>carded 90 percent of the answers (all those&mdash;opposed to software patents&mdash;that 
</p>
<p>were transmitted through the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure) as 
</p>
<p>having been initiated by a specific party. Even then, half of the remaining answers 
</p>
<p>were opposed to software patents. The report had to declare that those in favor 
</p>
<p>were more significant in terms of sales and employment. Meanwhile, a large body 
</p>
<p>of knowledge and evidence started to accumulate on the nature of software pat-
</p>
<p>ents and their effects where they were already in place.
</p>
<p>the june 25, 2002 directive
</p>
<p>When the European Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive on the Pat-
</p>
<p>entability of Computer-Implemented Inventions on June 25, 2002, it was basically 
</p>
<p>proposing to turn into law the existing practice of the EPO of granting patents 
</p>
<p>the 2005 rejection of software patents</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>166
</p>
<p>on software and methods for processing information in the information domain. 
</p>
<p>There was one difference, and a significant one, that testified to the effects of prior 
</p>
<p>debates: The directive was not proposing to accept patent claims on software, &ldquo;as 
</p>
<p>this could be seen as allowing patents for computer programs &lsquo;as such.&rsquo;&rdquo;17 The direc-
</p>
<p>tive was presented as not following the U.S. practice of granting patents on business 
</p>
<p>methods and claimed not to allow patents on algorithms. The former affirmation 
</p>
<p>was quickly debunked when analysis of existing patents showed that it was enough 
</p>
<p>for a business method to be implemented in software and to produce some improve-
</p>
<p>ment for it to be patentable. The latter claim was based on a radical misrepresen-
</p>
<p>tation of the relationship between algorithms and software, since algorithms are 
</p>
<p>nothing other than the underlying principles of software, while the whole idea of 
</p>
<p>patenting software is to grant monopolies on these principles. In fact, the use of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;computer-implemented inventions&rdquo; in the title was deceptive, because &ldquo;computer-
</p>
<p>implemented inventions&rdquo; were basically defined as software.18
</p>
<p> The proposed directive then went through the complex European legislative 
</p>
<p>process, consisting of two parallel readings in the European Council, which repre-
</p>
<p>sents member States, and in the elected parliament. When both are in serious dis-
</p>
<p>agreement, the council has the stronger power, which means that the parliament 
</p>
<p>could make its point only by rejecting the directive. It is generally reluctant to do 
</p>
<p>such a thing, because a majority of its members committed to creating EU-level 
</p>
<p>legislation. The European Council produced its first reading before the parliament 
</p>
<p>did so. It was prepared by a &ldquo;working party on intellectual property (patents).&rdquo; In 
</p>
<p>this group, more than half of the then fifteen member states were represented by 
</p>
<p>patent offices, and representatives of the EPO sat on the commission bench. The 
</p>
<p>council set out to amend the commission proposal by allowing software claims, 
</p>
<p>thus aligning the directive with EPO practices. However, the council decided to 
</p>
<p>wait for the parliament&rsquo;s reading before formally adopting its own position.
</p>
<p> This position was adopted in a vote on September 24, 2003. It came as a thun-
</p>
<p>derbolt. The parliament adopted amendments submitted by the Culture Commit-
</p>
<p>tee (rapporteur, Michel Rocard, socialist), by the Industry, Trade, Research and 
</p>
<p>Energy Committee (rapporteur, Elly Plooij van Gorsel, liberal) or by members of 
</p>
<p>the European Parliament who often were drawing inspiration from proposals by 
</p>
<p>civil-society groups. These amendments adopted a strict definition of what can be 
</p>
<p>considered to be &ldquo;technical,&rdquo; putting it in relation with physical devices and pro-
</p>
<p>cesses, and clarified that patents can be granted only when innovation lies in this 
</p>
<p>physical, technical domain. Civil-society initiatives used the possibility for any 
</p>
<p>European resident or group to petition the European Parliament on issues of its 
</p>
<p>competence: Leading computer scientists signed a detailed analysis of the reasons 
</p>
<p>to reject software patents,19 while one hundred and fifty thousand citizens signed 
</p>
<p>aigrain</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>167
</p>
<p>a petition against software patents initiated by the Foundation for a Free Informa-
</p>
<p>tion Infrastructure. The amended text constituted a clear and detailed rejection 
</p>
<p>of all the mechanisms by which software patentability had been sneaked into the 
</p>
<p>practice of the EPO.
</p>
<p> There was such a shock that patent lobbyists started expressing publicly the 
</p>
<p>view that patentability issues were truly too serious to be the object of democratic 
</p>
<p>decision making. Until then, prosoftware-patent lobbying had been restricted to 
</p>
<p>behind-the-doors contacts with the European Commission and members of the 
</p>
<p>European Parliament, while opponents argued on substance and conducted public 
</p>
<p>workshops. A significant change developed in the next two years, when advocates 
</p>
<p>for software patents developed an all-out lobbying campaign, including the estab-
</p>
<p>lishmentment of a &ldquo;Campaign for Creativity&rdquo; that backfired when it appeared to be 
</p>
<p>a lobbying-consultant initiative funded by Microsoft and SAP, without any link to 
</p>
<p>real software practitioners.20 Some opponents of software patents also adopted a 
</p>
<p>communication campaign, in particular, the NoSofthawarePatents.com campaign 
</p>
<p>conducted by Florian M&uuml;ller with support from MySQL and Red Hat.21 In the last 
</p>
<p>weeks before the July 2005 vote, communication efforts on both sides culminated 
</p>
<p>the 2005 rejection of software patents
</p>
<p>Demonstration against software patents in Germany, June 2004.</p>

</p>
<p>with distributions of free ice cream, demonstrations, and boat fights on the canals 
</p>
<p>close to the European Parliament building near Strasbourg.
</p>
<p> Before that climax, the reading of the proposed directive had proceeded with 
</p>
<p>great pain in the council. A text was produced by the Irish presidency, under 
</p>
<p>fierce criticism due to its interests as a tax haven for holders of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights,22 and a &ldquo;political compromise&rdquo; was recorded on May 18, 2004. It was 
</p>
<p>a confusing text that basically reiterated the propatent, first-reading position, 
</p>
<p>but installed it under smokescreens of complex language. Various opponents pro-
</p>
<p>duced translations to normal language in the days that followed its adoption.23 
</p>
<p>It took four meetings and several votes before a qualified majority was reached, 
</p>
<p>on March, 7, 2005, to adopt this text formally. Whether there was a truly quali-
</p>
<p>fied majority is still open to doubt, because one country (the Netherlands) later 
</p>
<p>changed its vote, and another (Poland) protested that its vote had not been prop-
</p>
<p>erly recorded. The fragility of this decision eased the path toward rejection of this 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;compromise&rdquo; position by the parliament. After the climax of lobbying mentioned 
</p>
<p>above, it became clear that there was no majority in the parliament for adopting a 
</p>
<p>text that would please the patent advocates and proprietary-software lobbies. So 
</p>
<p>everyone rallied to reject the text, and each claimed that doing so was a victory for 
</p>
<p>its views. The text was rejected by the unprecedented majority (for a rejection) of 
</p>
<p>648 in favor, 14 against, and 18 abstentions.
</p>
<p>what made the &ldquo;victory&rdquo; possible?
</p>
<p>How was such an unexpected result obtained? It resulted from the synergy 
</p>
<p>between several movements, each of which had built a serious case in its domain. 
</p>
<p>At the urging of Harmut Pilch, the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastruc-
</p>
<p>ture accumulated a broad body of empirical knowledge on actual patenting prac-
</p>
<p>tices in Europe that served as the basis for scholarly work in both Europe and the 
</p>
<p>United States. It was not long before active opponents of patentability knew much 
</p>
<p>more about what software patents looked like, who owned them, and how many 
</p>
<p>of them there were than their defenders. This was useful for building four differ-
</p>
<p>ent cases: a case for innovation, a scientific case, a political case, and a case based 
</p>
<p>on academic research into the actual effects of software patents, each of which 
</p>
<p>mobilized different communities.
</p>
<p> The case for innovation gave rise to a mass mobilization of software devel-
</p>
<p>opers well beyond developers of free and open-source software. This group was 
</p>
<p>by far the largest in terms of direct action. It included individuals who on their 
</p>
<p>own initiative flew to Brussels to talk to members of the European Parliament. 
</p>
<p>The members of parliament were not used to encountering twenty-year-old 
</p>
<p>aigrain</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>169
</p>
<p>programmers wanting to give them pedagogic explanations of the impact of soft-
</p>
<p>ware patents on innovation, and they listened carefully. Hundreds of engineers of 
</p>
<p>the large European companies that were supporting software patents signed the 
</p>
<p>Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure petition against the patentability  
</p>
<p>of software.24
</p>
<p> But there was also a scientific case, which mobilized fewer people, but which 
</p>
<p>gave impressive intellectual credibility to the opposition.25 The scholarly eco-
</p>
<p>nomics community was divided, but a leading group of economists signed a let-
</p>
<p>ter against software patents a few days before the vote. More importantly, the 
</p>
<p>organizations of small and medium-sized European shareware enterprises made 
</p>
<p>known their own opinion on the subject, making clear that they did not share 
</p>
<p>the propatent view of the Union of Industrial and Employers&rsquo; Confederations of 
</p>
<p>Europe, the large-company employer organization. This had a major influence on 
</p>
<p>bringing a small part of the conservative members of parliament, who traditionally 
</p>
<p>speak for a lot of small and medium-sized shareware enterprises to a critical view 
</p>
<p>of software patents. In reaction, some large companies created an ad-hoc orga-
</p>
<p>nization of small and medium-sized shareware enterprises whose members were 
</p>
<p>spin-off companies, directly or through university partnerships. In a similar move, 
</p>
<p>Microsoft created an ad-hoc proprietary software-publisher organization when 
</p>
<p>it became clear that the general software employer organizations and the profes-
</p>
<p>sional societies were reluctant to support their view.
</p>
<p> All this would have probably not been sufficient without a political case also 
</p>
<p>being built. The European Parliament has a culture of cross-party work that rests 
</p>
<p>significantly on the relationships between advisers, assistants, and sometimes 
</p>
<p>members of parliament. The 2003 vote in which many parties split their votes (the 
</p>
<p>conservatives, the socialists, the liberals) cannot be understood without reference 
</p>
<p>to the lively discussions between young advisers and assistants in corridors, caf-
</p>
<p>eterias, and Brussels pubs. These conversations took place in a context where pub-
</p>
<p>lic debate was also raging. The Green Party organized a number of seminars, some 
</p>
<p>debates in which contradictory views were expressed, others more one-sided, but 
</p>
<p>presenting the various facets of the antisoftware-patents movement.
</p>
<p> In these seminars and more generally in the literature on software patents, 
</p>
<p>scholarly work conducted in the United States had an important impact, building 
</p>
<p>a case against patents based on academic research into the actual effects that the 
</p>
<p>patents had produced. As I noted, the United States had introduced software pat-
</p>
<p>ents at the end of the 1980s, and they were granted ever more massively, especially 
</p>
<p>from 1994 on. The United States thus provided a real-life experiment, even if the 
</p>
<p>true impact of changes in the scope of patents will in reality take much longer to be 
</p>
<p>fully evident. A number of studies had a devastating impact. The Bessen-Maskin 
</p>
<p>the 2005 rejection of software patents</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>170
</p>
<p>and Bessen-Hunt papers demonstrated an inverse correlation between an increase 
</p>
<p>in software patenting and investment in research and development.26 Work by 
</p>
<p>Brian Kahin highlighted the huge costs of patent litigation and the increasing share 
</p>
<p>of innovation budgets dedicated to patents and patent risks.27 Evidence of a mas-
</p>
<p>sive unbalance in the number of patents held by U.S.-based companies (and to 
</p>
<p>a lesser extent Asian companies) compared with European companies also made 
</p>
<p>obvious that from a specific European viewpoint, software patents were not more 
</p>
<p>desirable than from a global viewpoint.
</p>
<p>where do things stand?
</p>
<p>The title of this essay, &ldquo;An Uncertain Victory,&rdquo; calls for an explanation. After the 
</p>
<p>vote of the European Parliament, we are in a regime of the status quo. The EPC still 
</p>
<p>declares mathematical methods, computer programs, and so on to be not patent-
</p>
<p>able as such. The EPO continues granting patents on software and software meth-
</p>
<p>ods for processing information or doing business. Litigation and counterlitigation 
</p>
<p>are limited, due to the obvious legal uncertainty: Companies are piling up software 
</p>
<p>patents in Europe without using them, for the time being, while software develop-
</p>
<p>ers keep ignoring them. Contrary to what happens in the United States, it is only in 
</p>
<p>areas of standardization that the concrete effects of software patents are felt: Sev-
</p>
<p>eral standards have been blocked by patent jeopardy, for instance, JPEG 2000 and 
</p>
<p>the internationalization of domain names in the Internet Engineering Task Force 
</p>
<p>(IETF).
</p>
<p> There are clear signs that patent-related institutions, the European Commis-
</p>
<p>sion, and the propatent lobbies are busy working on other ways to give a firmer 
</p>
<p>legal status or at least a stronger practical effect to software patents. The empha-
</p>
<p>sis has first been on litigation and jurisdiction. The commission has been trying 
</p>
<p>for ages to install a European Community Patent associated with a single Euro-
</p>
<p>pean jurisdiction.28 Critics fear that the creation of a specialized jurisdiction would 
</p>
<p>have the same effect as when sucthe creation of the specialized Court of Appeal 
</p>
<p>of the Federal Circuit through which software patentability was introduced in the 
</p>
<p>United States in the 1980s and 1990s. This effort has been blocked so far by lin-
</p>
<p>guistic conflicts between member states, though the situation may change, since 
</p>
<p>some opposing countries, such as France, have now seemingly decided to sign the 
</p>
<p>London Protocol, an agreement that would allow institution of the European Com-
</p>
<p>munity Patent to proceed. In parallel, the EPC is pushing for the European Patent 
</p>
<p>Litigation Agreement, because this agreement would permit exporting the scope of 
</p>
<p>decisions from one member state to another. Harmonization of patent examination

<p>171
</p>
<p>Organization (WIPO) is another track by which the U.S. standard of software pat-
</p>
<p>entability could be exported to Europe. However, it seems to be blocked by the 
</p>
<p>conscious opposition of emerging and developing countries in the organization.29
</p>
<p> The trend toward modifying the substantive definition of rights indirectly (for 
</p>
<p>instance, in scope) by acting on enforcement is not restricted to patents: One sees 
</p>
<p>it also in the area of copyright, from the World Intellectual Property Organization 
</p>
<p>Copyright Treaty to the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the by-prod-
</p>
<p>ucts of the European Copyright Directive or the proposed broadcasters&rsquo; treaty.30 
</p>
<p>It also uses instruments that apply to all intellectual property right titles, such as 
</p>
<p>the intellectual property right enforcement directives and the recently initiated 
</p>
<p>proposal for an international Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. These very 
</p>
<p>abstract texts are much more difficult to debunk than texts extending the scope 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property rights. It remains to be seen whether civil society, scholars, 
</p>
<p>and public-interest-oriented policy makers will be able to make clear for all what is 
</p>
<p>at stake in these more obscure corners. It may also be that a more frontal approach 
</p>
<p>will be taken, for instance through a new diplomatic conference for the revision of 
</p>
<p>the EPC. But the awareness built though the eight years that led to the July 2005 
</p>
<p>uncertain victory is still there.
</p>
<p> During the period between the two votes in the European Parliament, the scale 
</p>
<p>of the international access to knowledge movement changed. Prior to 2004, it was 
</p>
<p>mostly an initiative of specialized international English-speaking NGOs, with some 
</p>
<p>national counterparts in other countries. Today, it is a powerful coalition of better-
</p>
<p>coordinated NGOs and key emerging countries (Brazil, Argentina, India, and Chile), 
</p>
<p>with growing support from other developing countries. It has obtained support 
</p>
<p>from new segments of public opinion: scientists and policy circles well beyond 
</p>
<p>those traditionally interested, including, for instance, those concerned with cli-
</p>
<p>mate-change issues. The movement that led to the 2005 victory is one of the fac-
</p>
<p>tors that helped access to knowledge to become credible in the public&rsquo;s mind and 
</p>
<p>on the international scene.
</p>
<p> notes
</p>
<p>1 This title was in itself exemplary of the tactics put in place by the directorate-general when 
</p>
<p>it proposed the directive. Because a strong opposition to patenting software existed, the 
</p>
<p>drafters tried to hide the fact that the object of the directive was to recognize software pat-
</p>
<p>ents. They did so by using the neologism &ldquo;computer-implemented inventions,&rdquo; which was 
</p>
<p>defined in the text as equivalent to software, but could be understood by some readers as 
</p>
<p>the 2005 rejection of software patents</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>172
</p>
<p>meaning physical inventions using software. See below for more on such tactics. The text of

<p>2 On December 27, 2004, the Indian Parliament had adopted a last-minute amendment to the 
</p>
<p>new Indian patent law, imposed by its obligations under the TRIPS agreement. This amend-
</p>
<p>ment rejected software patents that had been temporarily authorized in the case of embed-
</p>
<p>ded software by a governmental decree in 2002. The Indian rejection was clearer in its legal 
</p>
<p>effect than the European Parliament vote, but it did not obtain the same publicity, because it 
</p>
<p>was overshadowed by the acceptance of patents on chemical molecules.

<p>4 Recently, some analysts have put into question the risk of patent thickets blocking innova-
</p>
<p>tion in software, based on lack of evidence that innovation blockage has materialized in the 
</p>
<p>United States. I claim that the case of standards provides evidence of adverse effects of pat-
</p>
<p>ent thickets on the dissemination of innovation, if not on its initial stages, which generally 
</p>
<p>proceed in total ignorance of patents. See Jim Bessen, &ldquo;Software Patent Myopia,&rdquo; Technol-

<p>10 In patent law, inventions must be susceptible of industrial application, must be new, and 
</p>
<p>must involve an inventive step. The statement that computer programs are not inventions in 
</p>
<p>that sense refers to the term &ldquo;industrial application&rdquo; being understood (in European patent 
</p>
<p>law) as industrially produced physical devices and physical processes in industry.

<p>15 The EPO and the EPC are intergovernmental: some countries that are not members of the 
</p>
<p>European Union are members of the EPO and parties to the EPC. A diplomatic conference had 
</p>
<p>the great advantage of requiring neither a debate nor a vote in the European Parliament.

<p>and 0 percent in those geographical areas eligible for European Structural Funds, allocated 
</p>
<p>by the European Union to provide support for the poorer regions of Europe and support 
</p>
<p>for integrating European infrastructure. This has given rise to a massive delocalization of

<p>the treaty to Webcasting or at least simulcasting (the simultaneous transmission of video or

<p>sound on the Internet to many users). The proposed treaty is very vociferously debated, with 
</p>
<p>opponents stressing the risks for democracy of digital locks on television that prevent fair 
</p>
<p>use and criticism and the uselessness of creating a new propertylike right for broadcasters.

<p>A2K at	WIPO:	The	Development	Agenda	
</p>
<p>and	the	Debate	on	the	Proposed	Broadcasting	Treaty
</p>
<p>Viviana Mu&ntilde;oz Tellez and Sisule F. Musungu
</p>
<p>Some of the most important international discussions that affect access to knowl-
</p>
<p>edge (A2K) take place in a long-standing organization that is little known to the 
</p>
<p>public&mdash;the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). WIPO formally 
</p>
<p>came into existence in 1970, and subsequently, in 1974, it became a specialized 
</p>
<p>agency of the United Nations. Today, there are many other organizations involved 
</p>
<p>in standard setting on intellectual property issues. Yet WIPO remains the main 
</p>
<p>international intergovernmental organization responsible for the administration 
</p>
<p>and negotiation of new intellectual property treaties and the provision of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property&ndash;related technical assistance to developing countries. WIPO is 
</p>
<p>therefore a major institutional player in the global governance and regulation of 
</p>
<p>knowledge. Hence, the approach and discussions related to A2K in WIPO are of 
</p>
<p>particular importance and interest to the A2K communities.
</p>
<p> In recent years, WIPO has been undergoing a substantial transformation. This is 
</p>
<p>due, in part, to the new, active participation by A2K communities and to demands 
</p>
<p>by developing countries for a more inclusive and balanced approach to its norm 
</p>
<p>setting and other processes. While intellectual property policy has traditionally 
</p>
<p>been considered a complex and technical issue, mainly thought of as the compe-
</p>
<p>tence of lawyers and transnational companies, the growing evidence of the impact 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property on ordinary people has brought many new players to its 
</p>
<p>discussions. The recent decision to launch a development agenda for the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion and the collapse of efforts to establish an exclusive rights-based treaty for the 
</p>
<p>enhanced protection of broadcasting organizations are landmark events in the his-
</p>
<p>tory of WIPO and the global debate on intellectual property policy.
</p>
<p> This essay analyzes the A2K agenda and the role of the A2K movement within 
</p>
<p>the process of establishing the WIPO Development Agenda and the discussions 
</p>
<p>on the proposed WIPO Broadcasting Treaty. Looking at these two processes offers </p>

<p>important lessons for the A2K movement. In the main, it demonstrates workable 
</p>
<p>strategies by which A2K advocates can introduce transformative ideas into the 
</p>
<p>mainstream discourse on intellectual property and by which they can challenge 
</p>
<p>rules and standards that negatively affect development and the public interest. 
</p>
<p>The first part of the essay focuses on the WIPO Development Agenda and the 
</p>
<p>second on the negotiations over the proposal for a WIPO Broadcasting Treaty. We 
</p>
<p>conclude with reflections on the future of A2K at WIPO.
</p>
<p> Understanding the events that took place in the context of the WIPO Develop-
</p>
<p>ment Agenda and the debate on the necessity and scope of enhanced protections 
</p>
<p>for broadcasting organizations by granting exclusive rights requires a deeper look 
</p>
<p>at the business of multilateral negotiation and its ways, a prospect that may at 
</p>
<p>first seem off-putting, but that provides an ideal setting in which to analyze the 
</p>
<p>evolution and growing impact of the A2K movement. This also helps us look more 
</p>
<p>closely at the alliances and positions (connections, shifts, consolidations) of the 
</p>
<p>players involved among the states, civil society, and industry.
</p>
<p>the wipo development agenda: pathway to a2k
</p>
<p>The agreement on a development agenda is one of the most significant develop-
</p>
<p>ments in the recent history of WIPO. The WIPO Development Agenda is essen-
</p>
<p>tially an effort to reform the current structure of global intellectual property policy 
</p>
<p>making. It is aimed at reshaping the organization to increase its ability to address 
</p>
<p>concerns that had been historically relegated to obscurity or absent entirely from 
</p>
<p>the WIPO policy discussions and activities, that is, development and public-inter-
</p>
<p>est concerns, as well as the concerns of new industries. The core objective was to 
</p>
<p>ensure that WIPO activities and intellectual property discussions would balance 
</p>
<p>business interests with broader consumer and public interests and would be in line 
</p>
<p>with the broad mandate of the UN to support the development goals of its devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries and least-developed countries.1
</p>
<p> In the process of negotiating the elements of the WIPO Development Agenda, 
</p>
<p>the most acknowledged and notable proposal on A2K was the attempt to negoti-
</p>
<p>ate, within WIPO, an A2K treaty. However, the A2K agenda in the development 
</p>
<p>agenda by no means has been confined to the A2K treaty proposal.2 As such, 
</p>
<p>although the A2K treaty proposal did not become part of the final list of agreed-
</p>
<p>upon recommendations under the development agenda, various recommendations 
</p>
<p>remain relevant to the A2K agenda. Many of these, however, are not under the 
</p>
<p>rubric of access to knowledge. Rather, they are listed under the rubrics of norm 
</p>
<p>setting, flexibilities, public policy, and the public domain. For example, under one 
</p>
<p>proposal, the member states of WIPO commit themselves to initiate discussions on </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>mu&ntilde;oz tellez and musungu178
</p>
<p>how, within WIPO&rsquo;s mandate, access to knowledge and technology for developing 
</p>
<p>countries and least-developed countries can be fostered. To grasp the relevance 
</p>
<p>of the recommendations that emerged from the WIPO Development Agenda as a 
</p>
<p>pathway leading to possible future developments for the A2K movement, how-
</p>
<p>ever, first we need to examine the history of the negotiations that led to the accep-
</p>
<p>tance of the WIPO Development Agenda.
</p>
<p>the history of the wipo development agenda
</p>
<p>The establishment of a WIPO Development Agenda was formally approved by the 
</p>
<p>184 member states of WIPO in September 2007 after three years of discussion. The 
</p>
<p>initial proposal was presented by Brazil and Argentina at the September&ndash;October 
</p>
<p>2004 session of the WIPO General Assembly.3 The proposal was then cosponsored 
</p>
<p>by twelve other countries known as the &ldquo;Friends of Development&rdquo; and strongly 
</p>
<p>supported by all developing countries.4 A wide range of public-interest groups and 
</p>
<p>other civil-society stakeholders also backed the development agenda initiative and 
</p>
<p>actively lobbied government representatives to support the proposal.
</p>
<p> In fact, some of the ideas of the development agenda had been discussed in 
</p>
<p>earlier discussions led by civil-society groups. The Future of WIPO meeting orga-
</p>
<p>nized by the Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD) in September 2004 and the 
</p>
<p>resulting Geneva Declaration on the Future of WIPO were key developments. The 
</p>
<p>discussions at the conference and the list of signatories to the declaration helped 
</p>
<p>demonstrate the widespread support for the underlying ideas of the development 
</p>
<p>agenda among civil-society groups, academics, and other sectors that previously 
</p>
<p>had not engaged closely in WIPO debates.5
</p>
<p> The WIPO Development Agenda initiative was groundbreaking in several ways. 
</p>
<p>For the first time in recent history, developing countries presented an encompass-
</p>
<p>ing, alternative agenda to guide international policy making at WIPO. The devel-
</p>
<p>opment agenda proposal asserted that the work of WIPO as a specialized agency of 
</p>
<p>the UN needed to follow the UN-wide broad development objectives such as those 
</p>
<p>elaborated in the Millennium Declaration adopted in 2000 and affirming the over-
</p>
<p>all goals of the UN. It sought to reestablish the role and responsibility of WIPO as 
</p>
<p>a member of the UN family, which until then was seen as a technical agency that 
</p>
<p>should be concerned only with uncritically promoting global intellectual property 
</p>
<p>protection. On the premise that WIPO had not systematically incorporated the 
</p>
<p>development dimension into all of its activities, the proponents of the develop-
</p>
<p>ment agenda called for various internal structural and substantive reforms.
</p>
<p> The proposal by the core group of countries known as the &ldquo;Friends of Devel-
</p>
<p>opment&rdquo; elucidated and brought together in the WIPO context various concerns 
</p>
<p>and ideas that had matured as part of the growing global debate on intellectual </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>property policy. Attention focused on WIPO largely because of the startling find-
</p>
<p>ings of various research studies that pointed to significant problems in the cur-
</p>
<p>rent intellectual property system in areas such as agriculture and public health 
</p>
<p>and within WIPO&rsquo;s internal processes. Such studies included the Report of the UK 
</p>
<p>Commission on Intellectual Property Rights,6 the papers presented at the Bella-
</p>
<p>gio Dialogues on Intellectual Property and Development,7 and a paper by Sisule F. 
</p>
<p>Musungu and Graham Dutfield, &ldquo;Multilateral Agreement and a TRIPS-Plus World: 
</p>
<p>The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO),&rdquo;8 which critically examined 
</p>
<p>the role and activities of WIPO in the era following the adoption of the World 
</p>
<p>Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property Rights (TRIPS), enabling many outsiders to understand the importance 
</p>
<p>of participating in WIPO processes.
</p>
<p> Developing countries had been raising questions about the activities, norm 
</p>
<p>setting, and other decision-making processes of the organization. Some concerns 
</p>
<p>voiced by these countries and evidenced by the above studies and others on norm 
</p>
<p>setting related to the overly active approach of the WIPO Secretariat to advance 
</p>
<p>the Substantive Patent Law Treaty and a broadcasting treaty when no assessment 
</p>
<p>had been made as to the need for such initiatives or their impact. Other concerns 
</p>
<p>included the significant influence of private-interest groups in WIPO and there-
</p>
<p>fore negotiation outcomes, evidenced by the direct advisory role of the Industry 
</p>
<p>Advisory Committee to the WIPO director general.9
</p>
<p>the necessity for a development agenda for wipo
</p>
<p>The adoption and entry into force of the TRIPS Agreement substantially changed 
</p>
<p>the international intellectual property landscape. It established the rule that all

</p>
<p>WTO members must adhere to minimum intellectual property standards. As a 
</p>
<p>result, the last decade has seen a fierce global debate about the impact of TRIPS 
</p>
<p>standards on development and on the public interest in developing countries. In 
</p>
<p>the minds of many, the problems of intellectual property are therefore associated 
</p>
<p>more with the WTO than with WIPO. However, while the &ldquo;politics&rdquo; of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property have mainly taken place at the WTO, new intellectual property rules 
</p>
<p>are not being debated and created at the WTO, but rather under the auspices of 
</p>
<p>WIPO.10 In this context, activities at WIPO continue greatly to influence the shape 
</p>
<p>of the international intellectual property system.11 It is essentially the recognition 
</p>
<p>of the importance of WIPO, in this sense, that spurred the actions related to the 
</p>
<p>introduction of the original proposal on the WIPO Development Agenda.
</p>
<p> The ideas and proposals suggested for the WIPO Development Agenda largely 
</p>
<p>stem from the international debate on the current functioning and evolution of 
</p>
<p>the intellectual property system in both developed and developing countries and 
</p>
<p>the impact of that debate on different stakeholders. It is for this reason that the 
</p>
<p>development agenda gathered significant momentum and the necessary political 
</p>
<p>and technical support.
</p>
<p> Two key questions are at the center of the current global intellectual property 
</p>
<p>debate. The first concerns the costs and benefits of intellectual property protec-
</p>
<p>tion in light of changing patterns of innovation and creative activity. The second 
</p>
<p>concerns the impact of intellectual property rights on development and public-
</p>
<p>interest concerns such as access to medicines, access to knowledge, sustainable 
</p>
<p>agriculture, nutrition, and the protection of biodiversity.12 The far-reaching impact 
</p>
<p>of the intellectual property system brought to the debate voices of a wide range 
</p>
<p>of nontraditional stakeholders, including farmers, students, scientists, consumers, 
</p>
<p>people suffering from life-threatening diseases, software developers, and innova-
</p>
<p>tive and creative businesses making use of alternative models of innovation.
</p>
<p> The previously successful campaigns on intellectual property and access to 
</p>
<p>medicines and discussions of intellectual property and biodiversity in different 
</p>
<p>national contexts and multilateral organizations, such as the Convention on Bio-
</p>
<p>logical Diversity and the WTO, had helped deepen the understanding among states 
</p>
<p>and other stakeholders of the impact of intellectual property on public-interest 
</p>
<p>and development concerns. One of the most notable achievements coming out 
</p>
<p>of the earlier debate was the 2001 WTO Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public 
</p>
<p>Heath,13 which effectively reaffirmed the primacy of public-health objectives over 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protection.
</p>
<p> Nothing similar had occurred in the recent history at WIPO. Historically the 
</p>
<p>norm-setting and other activities of WIPO had focused on strengthening the pro-
</p>
<p>tection for intellectual property rights and on advancing the global harmonization </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a2k at wipo 181
</p>
<p>of standards of protection. Moreover, although developed countries are small in 
</p>
<p>number, compared with developing countries, the former have remained the most 
</p>
<p>active and influential participants at WIPO, alongside industry, lawyer associa-
</p>
<p>tions, and other rights-holder interest groups. In terms of the role and responsi-
</p>
<p>bility of WIPO to contribute to the broader development goals of the UN system, 
</p>
<p>the organization has focused on promoting the use and protection of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property as &ldquo;a tool for development&rdquo; and the implementation of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty&ndash;related obligations through the provision of technical assistance.
</p>
<p> The approach of the WIPO in support of exclusive intellectual property rights can 
</p>
<p>be explained by four factors. First, developed countries are the more powerful parties 
</p>
<p>in WIPO, representing strong intellectual property&ndash;based industries, and as such are 
</p>
<p>responding to those industries&rsquo; demand for a strong, harmonized global system that 
</p>
<p>facilitates and reduces the cost of intellectual property protection and enforcement 
</p>
<p>around the world. Rights-holder groups from developed countries have been able to 
</p>
<p>form strong alliances within their home countries and between developed countries 
</p>
<p>and have built strong and long-lasting relationships with the WIPO Secretariat.
</p>
<p> Second, until recently, developing countries did not make changing the rules 
</p>
<p>of the game a priority. This was especially true for the least-developed countries, 
</p>
<p>which are not required to implement the commitments under the TRIPS Agree-
</p>
<p>ment until the end of the transition period available to them.14 In the post-TRIPS 
</p>
<p>era and until a couple of years before the introduction of the development agenda 
</p>
<p>proposal, the main concern and focus of the demands of developing countries at 
</p>
<p>WIPO was to access technical and legal assistance to implement the obligations 
</p>
<p>acquired under the 1995 TRIPS Agreement and subsequent WIPO treaties.15 That 
</p>
<p>remains a priority for a number of developing countries. Some have perceived that 
</p>
<p>strengthening intellectual property protection remains in their best interests.
</p>
<p> However, a growing number of developing countries are increasingly wary of 
</p>
<p>the assumed positive correlation between intellectual property and development 
</p>
<p>and concerned that the rigidity of the intellectual property system may affect their 
</p>
<p>ability to address public-policy issues such as access to medicines and access to 
</p>
<p>knowledge. The changing preferences of developing countries, particularly with 
</p>
<p>respect to the work of WIPO, have increased the divergence among the prefer-
</p>
<p>ences of developed and developing countries.
</p>
<p> Third, the national and international debate on the costs and benefits of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property, especially for developing countries, is a recent one. Only a few 
</p>
<p>years ago, the notion that strengthened intellectual property&ndash;rights protection 
</p>
<p>promotes development remained largely uncontested. The preferences and inter-
</p>
<p>ests of WIPO, developing countries, and some developed-country member states 
</p>
<p>have evolved along with the debate.</p>

</p>
<p> Finally, industry, lawyer associations, and other rights-holder interest groups 
</p>
<p>historically have enjoyed a strong presence and deep influence at WIPO, reflecting 
</p>
<p>the interests of the countries in which they originate. It is only in recent years that 
</p>
<p>the participation of development-oriented and public-interest nongovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations at WIPO has increased significantly.16
</p>
<p>the formal process for establishing a development agenda for wipo
</p>
<p>The process for establishing a development agenda for WIPO was formally initi-
</p>
<p>ated when the WIPO General Assembly unanimously agreed at its 2004 annual 
</p>
<p>session to consider the proposal by the &ldquo;Friends of Development&rdquo; and other 
</p>
<p>proposals that other member states might submit on the subject.17 Further, the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly agreed on the future process to examine the specific sugges-
</p>
<p>tions contained in the original development agenda proposal and any additional  
</p>
<p>proposals.18 Two years later, a multiplicity of proposals for a WIPO Development 
</p>
<p>Agenda were on the table.19
</p>
<p> The 2006 General Assembly then faced the daunting task of determining how 
</p>
<p>to move forward on the basis of a list of the 111 proposals submitted by member 
</p>
<p>states. The proposals were grouped under six rubrics: technical assistance and 
</p>
<p>capacity building; norm setting, flexibilities, and public policy and the public 
</p>
<p>domain; technology transfers, information and communication technology, and 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge; assessments, evaluations, and impact studies; institutional 
</p>
<p>matters, including mandates and governance; and other issues.20 The multiplicity 
</p>
<p>of proposals made consensus building difficult, even among developing countries. 
</p>
<p>Coalition building between the proponents and other interested stakeholders, such 
</p>
<p>as civil-society organizations, also became a challenge. Given that the members 
</p>
<p>could not come to any agreement, the General Assembly renewed the mandate 
</p>
<p>of the Provisional Committee on the development agenda for the committee to 
</p>
<p>accelerate their deliberations, report back, and make recommendations to the 2007 
</p>
<p>General Assembly.
</p>
<p> After three years of intense debate and negotiations, member states finally 
</p>
<p>agreed, in September 2007, on the need and method to establish permanently the 
</p>
<p>development agenda for WIPO. Forty-five recommendations or proposals were 
</p>
<p>necessary to mainstream development into the different WIPO program and activ-
</p>
<p>ities.21 The next phase will be to implement the proposals effectively, including 
</p>
<p>defining the expected outcomes and deliverables and providing financing for the 
</p>
<p>respective activities. To do so, the Committee on Development and Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property, which began meeting in early 2008, was established. Progress, however, 
</p>
<p>has been slow, and no concrete implementation plan had been agreed upon at the 
</p>
<p>time this text was written, in August 2008.</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p> The committee has three main tasks: to develop a work program for implemen-
</p>
<p>tation of the adopted recommendations; to monitor, assess, discuss, and report on 
</p>
<p>the implementation of all recommendations adopted and for that purpose coor-
</p>
<p>dinate with relevant WIPO bodies; and to discuss intellectual property issues and 
</p>
<p>development-related issues as agreed upon by the committee, as well as those 
</p>
<p>decided by the General Assembly.
</p>
<p>conceptual framing and process strategies
</p>
<p>How could the WIPO Development Agenda succeed, given the prior dominance of 
</p>
<p>wealthy countries and business interests in its standard-setting and rule-making 
</p>
<p>processes? One key ingredient of the success of the development agenda was the 
</p>
<p>solid conceptual framework on which the original proposal was built. The pro-
</p>
<p>posal was framed by the &ldquo;Friends of Development&rdquo; in a way designed to reduce 
</p>
<p>divergence among the preferences and interests of the powerful states and rights-
</p>
<p>holder groups, on the one hand, and developing countries and public-interest 
</p>
<p>groups, on the other.
</p>
<p> More specifically, the original development agenda proposal was built on two 
</p>
<p>main concepts that challenged the general view hitherto widely held at WIPO&mdash;
</p>
<p>that neither intellectual property protection nor harmonization of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property laws leading to higher protection in all countries, irrespective of their 
</p>
<p>levels of development, can be seen as ends in themselves and that WIPO, as a 
</p>
<p>specialized UN agency that is mandated to promote technological innovation and 
</p>
<p>the transfer of technology, must explicitly support the UN&rsquo;s broader develop-
</p>
<p>ment goals. The power of these concepts is signaled by the fact that they were 
</p>
<p>not contested by any member state. The kind of conceptual framework on which 
</p>
<p>the original proposal was built was vital to achieve a positive response from whole 
</p>
<p>membership of WIPO to the discussion of the proposal for the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>development agenda.
</p>
<p> Another ingredient of the proposal by the &ldquo;Friends of Development&rdquo; was the 
</p>
<p>clarity they offered regarding the core problem and the measures they proposed to 
</p>
<p>address it. For this reason, these countries could no longer be dismissed as simply 
</p>
<p>complaining, but offering no direction.
</p>
<p> The original development agenda proposal identified five main areas to be 
</p>
<p>prioritized in reforming WIPO into a development-friendly organization: WIPO-
</p>
<p>mandate and norm-setting activities; transfers of technology; the implications 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property enforcement; technical cooperation and assistance; 
</p>
<p>and the concerns of all stakeholders, in particular, those of groups representing 
</p>
<p>civil society. Within each of the areas, the perceived problems were presented 
</p>
<p>together with the measures considered necessary to redress them. In a subsequent 
</p>
<p>a2k at wipo</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>184
</p>
<p>submission, the &ldquo;Friends of Development&rdquo; elaborated further elements and mea-
</p>
<p>sures. The identification and prioritization of issues helped to refine the position 
</p>
<p>of the proponents and the expected outcomes. It also served to rally increased 
</p>
<p>support from other developing countries and from groups outside of WIPO.
</p>
<p> To succeed in establishing a development agenda also required sustained and 
</p>
<p>coordinated leadership by the those making the demands for it. While the devel-
</p>
<p>opment agenda sought to institute reforms primarily aimed at benefiting develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries and other stakeholders from civil society that previously had not 
</p>
<p>been admitted into the process of setting the WIPO agenda, a core group of mem-
</p>
<p>ber states, including Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, and South Africa, in fact led the ini-
</p>
<p>tiative, expending the most political capital. Over time, leadership also emerged 
</p>
<p>among the developed countries, the United Kingdom and Netherlands being  
</p>
<p>notable here.
</p>
<p> Despite the framing of the proposals as &ldquo;development proposals,&rdquo; however, 
</p>
<p>there was no guarantee that developing countries would agree on the elements of 
</p>
<p>the development agenda&mdash;or even that they would all support it. Many countries 
</p>
<p>did not formally sign onto the various documents setting forth the demand for 
</p>
<p>the new agenda or actively participate in the formal deliberations. And while most 
</p>
<p>developing countries did agree on the basic elements of the new agenda, they dis-
</p>
<p>agreed on the specifics. How important was it to change how WIPO did &ldquo;technical 
</p>
<p>assistance,&rdquo; compared with the goal of reforming its norm-setting processes? How 
</p>
<p>quickly should the changes be implemented? Differences on issues such as these 
</p>
<p>led countries to submit competing proposals, diluting the strength of development 
</p>
<p>agenda proponents and diffusing their demands at various points.
</p>
<p>the role of nongovernmental actors
</p>
<p>One of the most important factors that contributed to advancing the development 
</p>
<p>agenda process was the active engagement of a broad range of nongovernmen-
</p>
<p>tal stakeholders. While the proposal to incorporate the &ldquo;development dimension&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>in WIPO was led by a group of developing-country governments, the initiative 
</p>
<p>received important support and input from a broader constituency in both devel-
</p>
<p>oping and developed countries. The proposal for the WIPO Development Agenda 
</p>
<p>was taken as an opportunity to consolidate and give coherence to the multiple 
</p>
<p>initiatives and campaigns to reform the global governance of knowledge and tech-
</p>
<p>nology. One of the important inputs to the development agenda process was the 
</p>
<p>September 2004 &ldquo;Geneva Declaration on the Future of WIPO.&rdquo;22
</p>
<p> The declaration, as already noted, was drafted after a meeting in Geneva orga-
</p>
<p>nized by the TACD that brought together various stakeholders from civil soci-
</p>
<p>ety, including nongovernmental organizations, public-health activists, consumer 
</p>
<p>mu&ntilde;oz tellez and musungu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>185
</p>
<p>groups, academics, scientists, Nobel Prize laureates, and businesses. The declara-
</p>
<p>tion argued, among other things, that the WIPO Development Agenda created the 
</p>
<p>first real opportunity to debate the future of WIPO.
</p>
<p> The original development agenda proposal was also identified by various 
</p>
<p>civil-society groups as part of a broader agenda to reform global institutions and 
</p>
<p>regimes as they affect innovation, access to knowledge, and creative activity. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the declaration broadened the conceptual basis of the WIPO Develop-
</p>
<p>ment Agenda beyond the emphasis on development as an issue of primary concern 
</p>
<p>for developing countries. Development concerns were brought together with a 
</p>
<p>wide range of public-interest and other concerns shared by constituencies in both 
</p>
<p>the Global North and the Global South. The A2K proposals are an example. The 
</p>
<p>declaration also affirmed that the WIPO Development Agenda was an agenda not 
</p>
<p>only for developing countries, but for everyone.
</p>
<p> The engagement with and support for the WIPO Development Agenda process 
</p>
<p>by civil-society groups in the North helped in dealing with some of the difficult 
</p>
<p>developed countries, such as the United States. Such member states, though pow-
</p>
<p>erful, could not ignore their own citizens and the local interests represented at 
</p>
<p>WIPO through civil-society groups. These groups also brought important tech-
</p>
<p>nical expertise to the debate. Important collaboration established among devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries, particularly the &ldquo;Friends of Development,&rdquo; and civil-society  
</p>
<p>stakeholders ensured that the concerns of civil-society groups found their way 
</p>
<p>into the specific proposals of the WIPO Development Agenda, such as the initia-
</p>
<p>tive for a treaty on A2K and commitments to increase efforts to bring civil-society 
</p>
<p>groups into the WIPO discussions and to more open consultations and events in 
</p>
<p>which civil-society groups could present their views to member states.
</p>
<p>the effect of the development agenda on a2k goals
</p>
<p>While it is premature to evaluate the actual impact and/or success of the WIPO 
</p>
<p>Development Agenda, given that the process for its implementation formally began 
</p>
<p>only in 2008, the initiative has already brought about significant changes in the 
</p>
<p>dynamics in the organization. In terms of substance, the development agenda 
</p>
<p>process has served to attenuate the historical bias in WIPO policy making toward 
</p>
<p>developed-country and rights-holder interests, as well as the dogmatic discourse 
</p>
<p>on the benefits of strong intellectual property protection and harmonization. It 
</p>
<p>has also allowed and stimulated a more open, participatory, and fact-based debate 
</p>
<p>on the relationship between intellectual property and development and the public 
</p>
<p>interest, as well as on the concerns voiced by the A2K communities. Ongoing norm-
</p>
<p>setting processes and discussions at WIPO, such as the proposed treaty on the pro-
</p>
<p>tection of broadcasting organizations, have also been influenced by the debate on 
</p>
<p>a2k at wipo</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>186
</p>
<p>establishing a development agenda. In terms of process, developing countries have 
</p>
<p>taken a more active role in the discussions and in articulating their demands. Like-
</p>
<p>wise, a broader range of civil-society actors are effectively engaging in WIPO.
</p>
<p> In the longer term, the WIPO Development Agenda has the potential to do four 
</p>
<p>things: establish a set of general principles on knowledge governance and intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property, provide a substantive program of work for WIPO, ensure good 
</p>
<p>governance and the democratization of WIPO, and establish a basis for evidence-
</p>
<p>based standard setting and rule making in the organization.23 The continued 
</p>
<p>participation of constituencies concerned with A2K will be critical in realizing 
</p>
<p>this potential.
</p>
<p>the proposed wipo treaty on the protection of  
broadcasting organizations
</p>
<p>In the post-TRIPS period, as already noted, WIPO has continued to advance new 
</p>
<p>intellectual property norms and standards. One such area of work has taken place 
</p>
<p>under the so-called &ldquo;digital agenda.&rdquo; The digital agenda in WIPO has focused on 
</p>
<p>adapting copyright and related proprietary forms of protection to the digital envi-
</p>
<p>ronment.24 In the past ten years, the international protection of copyright and 
</p>
<p>related rights has been expanded significantly to include new rights, extended 
</p>
<p>terms of protection, and new subject matter, such as computer programs and data-
</p>
<p>bases. Under the auspices of WIPO, the scope of copyright protection has also 
</p>
<p>been extended to create paracopyright regimes allowing copyright and related 
</p>
<p>rights holders to make use of digital technology to gain greater control over the 
</p>
<p>access, use, and distribution of content in electronic and digital form.
</p>
<p> The most notable example to date is the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO 
</p>
<p>Performances and Phonograms Treaty, which came into force in 2002. The WIPO 
</p>
<p>Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty&mdash;commonly 
</p>
<p>referred to as the &ldquo;Internet Treaties&rdquo;&mdash;extend protection for copyright and related 
</p>
<p>rights in the digital environment and create new legal obligations to support the 
</p>
<p>protection of on-line works via technological means. The new legal framework cre-
</p>
<p>ated by the Internet Treaties to control access to works in electronic and digital 
</p>
<p>form effectively gives rights holders greater control over content.25
</p>
<p> One of the main concerns, from an A2K perspective, is that government-backed 
</p>
<p>technological-protection measures may render inapplicable the limitations and 
</p>
<p>exceptions to access and use of works protected by copyright and related rights, 
</p>
<p>such as for noncommercial research and educational purposes, and that, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms 
</p>
<p>Treaty, may be devised as appropriate for the digital environment. This is because 
</p>
<p>mu&ntilde;oz tellez and musungu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>187
</p>
<p>technological protection measures effectively block access to works, irrespective 
</p>
<p>of the reason why access is sought, given that the technologies cannot distinguish 
</p>
<p>whether the circumventing purpose is lawful or not. The problem becomes more 
</p>
<p>acute when national legislation implementing the respective WIPO Copyright 
</p>
<p>Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty obligations go as far as 
</p>
<p>prohibiting not only the act of circumventing a technological-protection measure, 
</p>
<p>but also the manufacture of and trade in devices that may be used to circumvent 
</p>
<p>technological-protection measures, as in the case of the United States 1998 Digital 
</p>
<p>Millennium Copyright Act. The experience of countries implementing paracopy-
</p>
<p>right legislation shows that even when limitations and exceptions are defined in 
</p>
<p>national law, technological-protection measures can prevent their exercise.
</p>
<p> Notwithstanding these concerns, WIPO continued to be engaged in efforts to 
</p>
<p>create additional rights for new players in the name of adapting existing rights to 
</p>
<p>the digital environment. It is in this context that we examine the demand for and 
</p>
<p>the debate relating to the protection of broadcasting organizations.
</p>
<p>the demand for further protection for broadcasting organizations
</p>
<p>After the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances 
</p>
<p>and Phonograms Treaty, audiovisual performers and broadcasting organizations 
</p>
<p>demanded negotiations on new international treaties to extend and update the pro-
</p>
<p>tection they enjoyed in the same manner that the two treaties had done for authors 
</p>
<p>of creative works and the music recording industry. In the history of the initiative 
</p>
<p>for the protection of broadcasting organizations, we can see a microcosm of the 
</p>
<p>challenges to and the potentially revolutionary nature of the development agenda.
</p>
<p> Starting in 1998, discussions commenced at WIPO on a proposed treaty on 
</p>
<p>the protection of broadcasting organizations. Evidence of the direct influence of 
</p>
<p>broadcasting organizations on the discussions is that the first treaty proposal was 
</p>
<p>made by a coalition of broadcasting unions, which, according to the WIPO struc-
</p>
<p>ture, fall under the category of nongovernmental organizations&mdash;NGOs. (NGOs 
</p>
<p>are the only category under which any type of nongovernmental actor, whether 
</p>
<p>industrial, commercial and/or nonprofit, noncommercial, can participate at WIPO 
</p>
<p>as an observer.) Although according to WIPO rules, it is only member states that 
</p>
<p>can officially submit proposals. In 1999, the WIPO Secretariat placed on the agenda 
</p>
<p>of the second session of the Standing Committee on Copyrights and Related Rights 
</p>
<p>the treaty proposals submitted by groups of broadcasting organizations, most 
</p>
<p>from Europe and Japan.26 At the time, the submissions by member states on the 
</p>
<p>issue were not drafted in treaty form.
</p>
<p> As of 2001, the question of improving the protection of the rights of broadcast-
</p>
<p>ing organizations by way of a proposed new international treaty became the main 
</p>
<p>a2k at wipo</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188
</p>
<p>item on the agenda of the standing committee. The longstanding chair of the com-
</p>
<p>mittee, Mr. Jukka Liedes, a representative of the government of Finland, pressed 
</p>
<p>member states to submit proposals for the treaty&rsquo;s language. The subsequent basis 
</p>
<p>for the discussions was a compilation of these proposals from member states by 
</p>
<p>the WIPO Secretariat. The second compilation included proposals by Argentina, 
</p>
<p>Cameroon, the European Communities and its Member States, Honduras, Japan, 
</p>
<p>Kenya, Mexico, Paraguay, Tanzania, Ukraine, and, at a later stage, the United 
</p>
<p>States.27 By November 2003, the Standing Committee on Copyrights and Related 
</p>
<p>Rights had agreed to continue discussions in April 2004, based on a consolidated 
</p>
<p>draft text with explanatory comments that were prepared and distributed by the 
</p>
<p>chair of the committee. Ultimately, it was up to member states to consider whether 
</p>
<p>to convene a diplomatic conference, the last step in the treaty-making process at 
</p>
<p>WIPO. It is at this stage that the initiative failed.
</p>
<p>the role of the a2k movement
</p>
<p>The initiative failed because the consolidated text presented by the chair of the 
</p>
<p>Standing Committee on Copyrights and Related Rights in no way reflected a con-
</p>
<p>sensus among member states. In a meeting in June 2004, it became apparent that 
</p>
<p>there was no agreement on the objective of the treaty, or on the nature and scope 
</p>
<p>of the protections it would offer for broadcasters, or even on evidence for the need 
</p>
<p>for the specific rights proposed. However, its main proponents, including the Euro-
</p>
<p>pean Union and Japan, rights-holder groups (particularly broadcasting organiza-
</p>
<p>tions), and the very active WIPO Secretariat and chair of the committee continued 
</p>
<p>to push strongly for the conclusion of the treaty.
</p>
<p> Some contentious issues in the proposed treaty included proposals for exten-
</p>
<p>sion of the scope of coverage of the rights currently granted to broadcasting orga-
</p>
<p>nizations under the Rome Convention;28 additional rights, such as the exclusive 
</p>
<p>right to authorize or prohibit the retransmission of broadcasts following what is 
</p>
<p>known as the &ldquo;fixation&rdquo; of such broadcasts&mdash;their reduction to material form; 
</p>
<p>the addition of new beneficiaries of protection, not only traditional broadcasting 
</p>
<p>organizations, but also cablecasting organizations and possibly simulcasting and 
</p>
<p>Webcasting organizations; more restrictive limitations and exceptions to the rights 
</p>
<p>conferred in the treaty, compared with the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO 
</p>
<p>Performances and Phonograms Treaty; and more stringent obligations on techno-
</p>
<p>logical-protection measures and digital rights management (DRM) than those con-
</p>
<p>tained in those treaties.29
</p>
<p> In previous meetings of the Standing Committee on Copyrights and Related 
</p>
<p>Rights, many member states, particularly developing countries, had not actively 
</p>
<p>participated in the discussions on the protection of broadcasting organizations. 
</p>
<p>mu&ntilde;oz tellez and musungu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>189
</p>
<p>Moreover, a review of the reports of the committee and the discussions on the 
</p>
<p>proposed Broadcasting Treaty in the WIPO General Assembly reveal that the par-
</p>
<p>ticipation and technical input of nongovernmental observers in the discussions 
</p>
<p>was largely dominated by rights-holder groups, particularly groups representing 
</p>
<p>broadcasting organizations.30
</p>
<p> From June 2004 onward, however, there was a significant change. In particu-
</p>
<p>lar, there was significant increase in the participation of consumer, public-interest, 
</p>
<p>and development-oriented nongovernmental observers and representatives of the 
</p>
<p>technology industry.31 The participation of new players with technical expertise 
</p>
<p>and the addition of the voices of different stakeholders brought about an impor-
</p>
<p>tant change in the dynamics and substance of the deliberations. This was a very 
</p>
<p>important change, since no serious, in-depth debate on the implications of the 
</p>
<p>proposed treaty provisions had ever taken place in the committee. Among other 
</p>
<p>things, these groups questioned the broad scope of the treaty, the nature of the 
</p>
<p>proposed rights, and their duration, and they highlighted possible unintended 
</p>
<p>consequences, especially for the business models of the technology industry.
</p>
<p> The new players created coalitions among public-interest and consumer groups 
</p>
<p>in both the North and South and had a significant impact on the positions of key 
</p>
<p>member states concerned with the potential negative impact of the proposed 
</p>
<p>treaty on access to information and knowledge and on technological innovation. 
</p>
<p>One of the main achievements of the new players was to bring representatives 
</p>
<p>of the information technology, electronics, and telecommunications industries 
</p>
<p>together with groups representing performer groups, library associations, devel-
</p>
<p>opment activists, public-interest and consumers on the basis of these concerns to 
</p>
<p>build together a dynamic and broad-based coalition to oppose the proposed treaty 
</p>
<p>in its current form.32 AT&amp;T, Dell, Intel, Verizon, and Sony were among the corpora-
</p>
<p>tions that joined the coalition.
</p>
<p> The involvement of the industry players was significant because it blunted the 
</p>
<p>rhetoric of the broadcasting lobby and their allies. It dawned on many, even the 
</p>
<p>staunchest supporters of the treaty within governments, that if some of the most 
</p>
<p>successful companies in the digital era had a problem with the treaty, one needed 
</p>
<p>to stop and think again. It was no longer easy to dismiss criticism as simply the 
</p>
<p>work of a few NGOs opposed to intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p> The parallel discussions on the WIPO Development Agenda also had an impor-
</p>
<p>tant impact on the subsequent debate on whether the Broadcasting Treaty was nec-
</p>
<p>essary. More member states demanded further deliberations on the proposed provi-
</p>
<p>sions, impact assessments, and studies before moving forward. These were all ideas 
</p>
<p>that had been raised in the context of the discussion on the development agenda.
</p>
<p> Ultimately, as a result of all the above factors, the 2006 WIPO General 
</p>
<p>a2k at wipo</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>190
</p>
<p>Assembly rejected the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Copyrights 
</p>
<p>and Related Rights to call for a diplomatic conference and instead asked for the 
</p>
<p>convening of two special sessions of the committee to deliberate further on the 
</p>
<p>essential elements of the proposed treaty&mdash;namely, its objectives, specific scope, 
</p>
<p>and objects of protection. The General Assembly also clarified that the scope of 
</p>
<p>the treaty would be limited to the protection of broadcasting signals from piracy, 
</p>
<p>as opposed to granting broadcasting organizations additional rights. The two spe-
</p>
<p>cial sessions of the committee did not lead to any agreement on the basic ele-
</p>
<p>ments of the proposed treaty, and consequently, the 2007 WIPO General Assembly 
</p>
<p>decided that a diplomatic conference would not be convened in the near future.
</p>
<p> The result is that the issue is no longer at the top of the agenda of the Stand-
</p>
<p>ing Committee on Copyrights and Related Rights. Though the proponents have not 
</p>
<p>given up their quest, it is likely to take some time before there can be another 
</p>
<p>attempt to craft a treaty with such a broad scope, in light of there being little evi-
</p>
<p>dence either of a need for it or of its potential impact.
</p>
<p>the future of a2k in wipo
</p>
<p>The A2K movement has made an important contribution to the more systematic 
</p>
<p>introduction of public-interest concerns into the deliberations of WIPO, particu-
</p>
<p>larly with respect to access to and sharing of on-line works for educational and 
</p>
<p>research purposes. The inclusion of important A2K-related proposals in the WIPO 
</p>
<p>Development Agenda and the halting of the discussions on the proposed WIPO 
</p>
<p>Broadcasting Treaty clearly demonstrate the success achieved. However, looking 
</p>
<p>forward to the future of the A2K agenda in WIPO, many challenges still lie ahead.
</p>
<p> While it is unlikely that new momentum will emerge for the proposed WIPO 
</p>
<p>Broadcasting Treaty, there is a need to continue to advance the A2K agenda in the 
</p>
<p>Standing Committee on Copyrights and Related Rights, as well as in other WIPO 
</p>
<p>bodies, on issues such as limitations and exceptions to intellectual property rights. 
</p>
<p>The implementation of the A2K proposals of the WIPO Development Agenda will 
</p>
<p>also require significant work to identify clear and specific actions that will enable 
</p>
<p>the proposals to be realized. To maximize the potential impacts of the A2K initia-
</p>
<p>tives in WIPO, the A2K movement will also need to work toward bringing greater 
</p>
<p>coherence to related initiatives being pursued in other UN agencies and other 
</p>
<p>international organizations.
</p>
<p> Both the development agenda and the experience with the proposed treaty on 
</p>
<p>broadcasting organizations demonstrate the flaws in WIPO&rsquo;s approach to intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property protection and provide a new opportunity for exploring alternative 
</p>
<p>models of innovation and collaboration.

</p>
<p> The future of A2K at WIPO is therefore bright, provided that the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment and those concerned with A2K issues double their efforts to put on the table 
</p>
<p>proposals that can benefit the needs of creative and competitive industries and 
</p>
<p>businesses and the public interest, including development and consumer interests 
</p>
<p>generally. Only the battles of this decade have been won. The war of the century&mdash;
</p>
<p>for the control of knowledge&mdash;may just be beginning.

</p>
<p>tual Property Rights and Development Policy, is one of the core works examining the rela-
</p>
<p>tionship between intellectual property rights and development. The report outlined the 
</p>
<p>real impacts of intellectual property, both positive and negative, on various areas, including 
</p>
<p>health and agriculture. A key conclusion that surfaced from the report is that the impact 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property rights and their use as an instrument of public policy will vary sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly among countries, depending on the level of scientific and technological capabil-
</p>
<p>ity and socioeconomic circumstances. Other important work on development and intellectual

<p>	&ldquo;IP	World&rdquo;&mdash;Made	by	TNC	Inc.
</p>
<p>Peter Drahos
</p>
<p>We live in a world where the rules of intellectual property (IP) and the intellectual 
</p>
<p>property generated using those rules are globally pervasive phenomena. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, in the nineteenth century, two important multilateral agreements on intellectual 
</p>
<p>property were negotiated by some states: the Berne Convention for the Protection 
</p>
<p>of Literary and Artistic Works (1886) and the Paris Convention for the Protection 
</p>
<p>of Industrial Property (1883). Today, the World Intellectual Property Organization 
</p>
<p>(WIPO) administers some twenty-three treaties on intellectual property.
</p>
<p> The global quantity of intellectual property being generated under the rules of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property cannot really be accurately quantified, but it is vast. By way 
</p>
<p>of illustration, in 2004, there were about 5.5 million patents in force around the 
</p>
<p>world.1	There were at least another 5 to 6 million unexamined patent applications. 
</p>
<p>In 2006, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reported that there were 1,332,155 
</p>
<p>active certificates of trademark registration in the United States. There are many 
</p>
<p>other forms of intellectual property that one would have to add to a global stock-
</p>
<p>taking of intellectual property, including the number of works protected by copy-
</p>
<p>right, the number of plant variety registrations, the number of registered designs, 
</p>
<p>the number of protected circuit layouts, and so on.
</p>
<p> One important issue is whether globalizing the rules of intellectual property and 
</p>
<p>encouraging the production of more and more intellectual property under those 
</p>
<p>rules will lead to a continuous increase in social welfare. In a moment, we will see 
</p>
<p>that as a matter of theory, more intellectual property does not necessarily mean 
</p>
<p>more social gains. This leads to the question that is the focus of this paper: If there 
</p>
<p>are dangers and risks in continuing to expand both the rules of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>and the production of intellectual property, why is this expansion occurring? The 
</p>
<p>answer can entail explanations of the structural kind or of the agent-centered kind 
</p>
<p>or something in between. This paper focuses on agents in the form of companies </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>drahos 198
</p>
<p>and individuals, but especially on transnational corporations&mdash;TNCs. A focus on 
</p>
<p>agents raises the possibility for social action. If the intellectual property world that 
</p>
<p>we have today reflects certain choices and actions taken by one group of actors, 
</p>
<p>can other actors with different views about the desirability of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>change the direction of its growth? Our answer is a qualified yes.
</p>
<p>too much intellectual property?
</p>
<p>Economic theory suggests that a society that had no intellectual property pro-
</p>
<p>tection at all would almost certainly not be allocating resources to invention and  
</p>
<p>creation at an optimal level.2 But equally, a society that went to extremes of pro-
</p>
<p>tection would almost certainly incur costs that would exceed the benefits. Intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights permit owners to exclude people from the use of socially valu-
</p>
<p>able information. At some point, allowing intellectual property owners to exploit 
</p>
<p>this power of exclusion becomes too costly in terms of social welfare. The rules of 
</p>
<p>arithmetic, for instance, can be used and reused endlessly. The costs of excluding 
</p>
<p>people from the use of these rules would be very high in economic terms and in 
</p>
<p>terms of basic human freedoms. The diagram below illustrates the proposition that 
</p>
<p>one can have too much intellectual property protection. It also suggests that there 
</p>
<p>is an optimal level of intellectual property protection.
</p>
<p> Like most abstractions, Diagram 1 does not capture the real-world dynamic 
</p>
<p>complexity of the way in which intellectual property rights and the growth of 
</p>
<p>knowledge actually interact. For example, it implies nothing about the mix of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property systems that a society should employ. A patent system, for 
</p>
<p>example, might not be part of an optimal mix. In the nineteenth century, both Hol-
</p>
<p>land and Switzerland were able to industrialize without a patent system. A patent

</p>
<p>system might be part of an optimal mix, but whether it is or not depends in part 
</p>
<p>on the scope of patentability. For example, as other chapters in this book illustrate, 
</p>
<p>the efficiency of extending patents to software, business methods, and pharma-
</p>
<p>ceutical products is highly debatable.
</p>
<p> When we come to think about optimal levels of intellectual property protec-
</p>
<p>tion in the context of a world of interdependent nation-states, it is clear that there 
</p>
<p>is not one level of protection that is universally optimal for all states. It is clear 
</p>
<p>that imitative production and learning are important to developing countries. TNCs 
</p>
<p>operating in developing countries typically do so with higher levels of knowledge 
</p>
<p>assets than domestic firms, for example. There is scope for domestic firms to ben-
</p>
<p>efit from this positive externality.3 But, whether domestic firms make productivity 
</p>
<p>gains is profoundly affected by the property rules that govern imitative produc-
</p>
<p>tion. Imitative production and learning require an appropriately designed set of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights (for example, rules that permit some degree of reverse 
</p>
<p>engineering). We know, for example, that Japan for a large part of the twentieth 
</p>
<p>century designed and used a patent system that placed the emphasis on the diffu-
</p>
<p>sion of knowledge, rather than on the right to appropriate knowledge.4
</p>
<p> Imitative production typically requires less capital, a factor that is important 
</p>
<p>in developing countries. If, with Ronald H. Coase, we think of property rights as 
</p>
<p>a factor of production, it follows that those property rights should be designed 
</p>
<p>in ways that match the comparative advantage that a country has in other factors 
</p>
<p>of production.5 This suggests that there will be real long-run costs for developing 
</p>
<p>countries if they continue to participate in a global regime of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights that continues to ratchet up standards of protection. Much the same conclu-
</p>
<p>sion follows from the theory of comparative capitalism.6 This theory suggests that 
</p>
<p>countries must choose their system for regulating intellectual property with an eye 
</p>
<p>to how it will fit other crucial legal and industry policy institutions, from competi-
</p>
<p>tion policy to labor-market policy. Property and these other institutions form an 
</p>
<p>organic whole. Whether or not particular property rights contribute to the well-
</p>
<p>being of the whole is a matter of careful diagnosis. Crucially, just like a physician, 
</p>
<p>countries must have the freedom to design the right treatment once the diagnosis 
</p>
<p>has revealed the source of the problem. As Jeffrey Sachs says, development eco-
</p>
<p>nomics must strive to be more like clinical medicine in its approach to problems.7
</p>
<p> The idea that there are different optimal points of intellectual property pro-
</p>
<p>tection for different countries is captured in Diagram 2 below. Even if there are 
</p>
<p>benefits for New Guinea in having a patent system (and this is an open question), 
</p>
<p>an optimally designed patent system for New Guinea is likely to be very different 
</p>
<p>from that of an optimal system for that of the United States. In Diagram 2, Country 
</p>
<p>B&rsquo;s optimal point of intellectual property protection is well and truly passed by </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>200
</p>
<p>the standards of protection required in order for Country A&rsquo;s optimal point to be 
</p>
<p>reached. If Country B is required to harmonize with Country A&rsquo;s standards of pro-
</p>
<p>tection it is likely to be made even worse off.
</p>
<p> Like Diagram 1, Diagram 2 abstracts from a much more complex empirical real-
</p>
<p>ity. At a given point in time in a country&rsquo;s development history, the wrong set of 
</p>
<p>institutional choices when it comes to intellectual property rights may drive it into 
</p>
<p>negative territory when it comes to the welfare impacts of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights. For example, a country such as New Guinea, which has a weak manufac-
</p>
<p>turing base and a minerals-based economy, has virtually nothing to gain from 
</p>
<p>adopting a patent system. Yet in order to meet its World Trade Organization (WTO) 
</p>
<p>obligations, it has adopted a patent law based on a WIPO model law. It also has a 
</p>
<p>growing HIV/AIDS crisis. Depending on what happens in the next decade, New 
</p>
<p>Guinea may find that as a result of its membership in the Patent Cooperation 
</p>
<p>Treaty, it ends up being designated for pharmaceutical patent applications. Such 
</p>
<p>patents may well complicate the New Guinea government&rsquo;s capacity to access the 
</p>
<p>cheapest medicines. There are other kinds of complex interdependencies at work. 
</p>
<p>New patent laws in countries such as India and China, which have been a source 
</p>
<p>of low-cost pharmaceuticals, when combined with the patent law in New Guinea, 
</p>
<p>may also complicate access. The curve for New Guinea for patents might take on 
</p>
<p>the shape in Diagram 3 below.8
</p>
<p> This brief analysis of the economics of intellectual property in the context 
</p>
<p>of economic development suggests that it would be prudent for states to retain 
</p>
<p>design sovereignty over intellectual property rights. Moreover, given the differ-
</p>
<p>ences in development among nations, one might expect to find a real diversity 
</p>
<p>of standards of intellectual property protection. When we look at the intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property world, however, instead of finding diversity, we find an increasing

</p>
<p>convergence on standards of intellectual property protection. For example, all the 
</p>
<p>members of the WTO have to comply with the standards of protection that are 
</p>
<p>set down in the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
</p>
<p>Rights (TRIPS). Since TRIPS came into operation, states have signed hundreds of 
</p>
<p>bilateral agreements, many of which include provisions that deal with intellectual 
</p>
<p>property and that set standards of protection that are higher than required under 
</p>
<p>the minimum standards of TRIPS.
</p>
<p> Accompanying this global spread of intellectual property standards has been 
</p>
<p>a vast growth in the bureaucracies that administer intellectual property rights. 
</p>
<p>Patents, trademarks, and designs are registration systems and therefore require 
</p>
<p>a bureaucracy that examines applications for the rights, decides on eligibility, and 
</p>
<p>maintains a register of the rights. Patent offices are costly operations. The U.S. 
</p>
<p>Patent and Trademark Office has a staff of some sixty-five hundred, the Japanese 
</p>
<p>Patent Office some twenty-five hundred, and the European Patent Office approxi-
</p>
<p>mately five thousand.
</p>
<p> The costs of creating intellectual property rights do not end with administra-
</p>
<p>tion. Property rights that cannot be enforced are worth little. Enforcement requires 
</p>
<p>the participation of civil courts and specialist tribunals. Increasingly, criminal- 
</p>
<p>law-enforcement agencies have begun to play a much greater role in enforcement 
</p>
<p>as states have moved down the path of criminalizing the infringement of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property.
</p>
<p> Administering and enforcing intellectual property is particularly costly for 
</p>
<p>developing countries. Should they direct their scarce scientific resources into pat-
</p>
<p>ent examination? In order to save on the costs of patent administration, they may 
</p>
<p>be tempted to rely on the work of offices such as the European Patent Office or 
</p>
<p>the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, but will the work of these offices meet the

<p>needs of developing countries? Similarly, there is a real issue as to whether devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries should devote scarce criminal-justice resources to enforcing what 
</p>
<p>in the end are private monopoly privileges and what historically have been the 
</p>
<p>subject of civil proceedings.
</p>
<p>the origins of the ip world: from the medieval period to the 1980s
</p>
<p>Historically speaking, two types of actors have been key in the processes that have 
</p>
<p>led to the globalization of intellectual property rules and the production of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property: states and companies. The sovereigns of newly emerging states 
</p>
<p>in medieval Europe well understood the importance of capturing resources for the 
</p>
<p>benefit of the states, resources that included knowledge. There was widespread 
</p>
<p>warfare between the powers of Europe, of which the Hundred Years&rsquo; War between 
</p>
<p>England and France was but one example. Natural disasters such as the Black Death 
</p>
<p>and crop failures were other sources of instability. Sovereigns found themselves 
</p>
<p>having to compete for skilled artisans who could bring commercially and militarily 
</p>
<p>important goods and techniques to their territories. To some extent, the compara-
</p>
<p>tive advantage of nations and city states was locked up by them in the guilds that 
</p>
<p>formed around all important technologies, such as mining, the making of sailcloth, 
</p>
<p>machines for milling or weaving, and so on. Local guilds could not, however, pro-
</p>
<p>vide all the innovation that the emerging states of the time demanded. Using the 
</p>
<p>privilege system to entice foreign skilled workers to defect from their guilds and 
</p>
<p>relocate to another territory was a natural step for sovereigns to take. It was a way 
</p>
<p>of building comparative advantage and robbing others of theirs. For this reason, 
</p>
<p>many monopoly privileges of the Middle Ages went to foreigners.

</p>
<p> Out of the medieval system of privileges that existed across Europe there 
</p>
<p>evolved statutory forms of intellectual property, copyright and patents being the 
</p>
<p>earliest examples. At the same time, the laws relating to the formation of corpo-
</p>
<p>rate personality were also evolving and being used for the purposes of business 
</p>
<p>and trade. The links between intellectual property and the economic interests of 
</p>
<p>companies existed early on in the history of intellectual property (for example, 
</p>
<p>the Stationers Company and printing privileges in sixteenth-century England). 
</p>
<p>The large-scale use by companies of systems of intellectual property evolved more 
</p>
<p>slowly. States did not really invest in the creation of the administrative infra-
</p>
<p>structure needed to run systems of intellectual property rights till the nineteenth 
</p>
<p>century. So, for example, patent offices were modernized and patent fees were 
</p>
<p>reduced. Companies in Europe and the United States began to see that patents 
</p>
<p>could confer business opportunities not just in their domestic markets, but in 
</p>
<p>markets abroad. The United States and the lead industrial states in Europe saw in 
</p>
<p>intellectual property, especially patents, a means by which to increase control over 
</p>
<p>resources that mattered in the final instance to state power.
</p>
<p> By the 1880s, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Belgium led Europe in 
</p>
<p>terms of industrialization, and Europe led the world. For example, it accounted for 
</p>
<p>63 percent of the world&rsquo;s steel production.9 Across the Atlantic, the United States 
</p>
<p>was making giant strides in industrialization. By 1913, its manufacturing output 
</p>
<p>matched that of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany combined, account-
</p>
<p>ing for some one-third of world production.10 Nation-states, which had become 
</p>
<p>the principal unit of political and economic organization, saw that their economic 
</p>
<p>supremacy depended on their capacity to compete in the heavy industries of coal, 
</p>
<p>iron, and steel, as well as in the new industrial technologies based on chemicals 
</p>
<p>and electricity. One of the important features of this period of industrial growth in 
</p>
<p>Europe and the United States was the increase in monopolistic business combina-
</p>
<p>tions in the form of cartels, trusts, or syndicates.11 Put simply, firms colluded and 
</p>
<p>cooperated in the marketplace. There were, of course, some attempts by govern-
</p>
<p>ments to deal with this, the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 in the 
</p>
<p>United States being the single most notable example. In Europe, some industries 
</p>
<p>rapidly organized themselves into national cartels. In Germany, for example, the 
</p>
<p>firms in the coal-tar dye industry formed special agreements to regulate production 
</p>
<p>and the exchange of patented knowledge. By 1913, 88 percent of world chemical dye 
</p>
<p>production was controlled by German industry, with the companies being part of 
</p>
<p>one of two agreements that regulated the industry and that were merged into one 
</p>
<p>in 1916.12
</p>
<p> The institutions of intellectual property were regularly the subject of attack by 
</p>
<p>skeptics. In the nineteenth century, the patent system narrowly survived an attack 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;ip world&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>204
</p>
<p>by a coalition of free traders, economists, and some politicians. The arguments 
</p>
<p>against the patent system were much the same as today. These included the view 
</p>
<p>that prizes and other payments are a superior way to create incentives for inven-
</p>
<p>tors, that the monopoly costs of the patent system outweigh its incentive effects, 
</p>
<p>that there are doubts about its incentive effects in any case, that patents inhibit 
</p>
<p>trade across borders, and that patents are not natural rights.13 Fritz Machlup and 
</p>
<p>Edith Penrose suggest that one of the main ways in which defenders of the patent 
</p>
<p>system prevailed was by the use of sophisticated techniques of propaganda. It is a 
</p>
<p>point that remains relevant today. Critics of intellectual property rights often find 
</p>
<p>themselves embroiled in propaganda wars in which criticism of the design of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property is framed as an attack on private property rights and the rights of 
</p>
<p>investors. Corporate intellectual property owners use this rhetorical framing tech-
</p>
<p>nique to shroud the fact that they are pushing states into expanding and enforcing 
</p>
<p>private monopoly rights.
</p>
<p> In any case, because the lead industrial states at the beginning of the twenti-
</p>
<p>eth century realized that their military and economic power depended on the key 
</p>
<p>industries of coal, iron, steel and chemical production, they concluded that if the 
</p>
<p>lead industrialists in these sectors supported the patent system, so would they. 
</p>
<p>Not for the last time, states bought into the belief that strong intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights would make for a strong state.
</p>
<p> For the first half of the twentieth century, states concentrated on developing 
</p>
<p>the two nineteenth-century pillars of the international framework for intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property&mdash;the Berne Convention and the Paris Convention. In general, the 
</p>
<p>companies that participated in domestic and international processes of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property lawmaking tended to view those processes from the perspective of 
</p>
<p>national businesses protecting national or regional interests. American publishers, 
</p>
<p>for example, were not a strong force for encouraging the United States to join the 
</p>
<p>Berne Convention (the U.S. did not join till 1988). The publishing cartels that were 
</p>
<p>formed in the first half of the twentieth century between U.S. and UK publish-
</p>
<p>ers (known as the British Publishers Traditional Markets Agreement) were more 
</p>
<p>defensive in nature, dividing up the world into territories where one would agree 
</p>
<p>not to trespass on the business interests of the other.
</p>
<p> In some industries, the chemical and pharmaceutical industries being an exam-
</p>
<p>ple, some companies did have an aggressive international focus. The German chem-
</p>
<p>ical industry employed thousands of chemists, and their output was measured by 
</p>
<p>thousands of patents. Companies such as Bayer and Badische Anilin Fabrik held 
</p>
<p>hundreds of patents in America. German industry held in total approximately 
</p>
<p>forty-five hundred U.S. patents, creating a &ldquo;colossal obstacle to the development 
</p>
<p>of the American dyestuff industry.&rdquo;14 But there was also sufficient flexibility in the 
</p>
<p>drahos </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>205
</p>
<p>international system for states to be able to defend their national interests along 
</p>
<p>with companies that saw themselves as nationally, rather than globally based. A 
</p>
<p>good example of the scope of this flexibility was the change that the United King-
</p>
<p>dom made to its patent law in 1919 preventing the patentability of chemical com-
</p>
<p>pounds. Chemical processes remained patentable. Fearing the might of IG Farben, 
</p>
<p>British industry pursued a strategy of free riding by concentrating on inventing 
</p>
<p>better processes that duplicated German dyestuffs.
</p>
<p> For the most part, companies and industries took an interest in those areas of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property that directly affected their particular business model and did 
</p>
<p>not operate in lobbying terms across all of intellectual property. The publishers 
</p>
<p>were active in copyright, pharmaceutical companies were active in patents, and a 
</p>
<p>variety of industries were active in trademarks. A cross-cutting, unified approach 
</p>
<p>to intellectual property by companies did not take place until the 1980s, when they 
</p>
<p>united on a common agenda for an international intellectual property framework 
</p>
<p>in the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of 
</p>
<p>Multilateral Trade Negotiations.
</p>
<p>tncs and trips
</p>
<p>The antecedents of this unified approach to intellectual property lie in the rise of 
</p>
<p>transnational corporations after the Second World War. TNCs are characterized by 
</p>
<p>the fact that their investment strategy takes the form of foreign direct investment in 
</p>
<p>production, sales, and distribution. The vehicles of this foreign direct investment are 
</p>
<p>foreign affiliates that allow the TNC to manage a centrally coordinated foreign direct 
</p>
<p>investment strategy across a large number of countries. TNCs are companies that 
</p>
<p>have a genuinely global investment philosophy. At base, TNCs evaluate the regula-
</p>
<p>tory systems of nation-states in terms of the impact of those systems on their ability 
</p>
<p>to make, control, and manage their investments in those states. It was this invest-
</p>
<p>ment philosophy that ended up unifying different TNCs during the course of the 
</p>
<p>Uruguay Round on the crucial issues of trade in services and intellectual property.
</p>
<p> The U.S. pharmaceutical industry, and Pfizer, in particular, turned out to be 
</p>
<p>leaders in the Uruguay Round because pharmaceutical companies were among 
</p>
<p>the first companies to change into genuine TNCs. Pfizer, facing strong domestic 
</p>
<p>competition in the production of penicillin after the end of World War II, moved 
</p>
<p>to a program of expansion into developing country markets. Pfizer&rsquo;s move into 
</p>
<p>overseas markets was the idea of John &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Powers, Jr., assistant to the presi-
</p>
<p>dent, then president himself of the company, who in effect globalized Pfizer as a 
</p>
<p>firm. Out of his initiative was born Pfizer International. Manufacturing plants and 
</p>
<p>distribution networks were established &ldquo;in countries ranging from Argentina to 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;ip world&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>206
</p>
<p>Australia and Belgium to Brazil.&rdquo;15 By 1957, Pfizer International had achieved more 
</p>
<p>than its target of $60 million overseas sales.
</p>
<p> Pfizer&rsquo;s investment in developing countries sensitized it to the threat to inter-
</p>
<p>national markets that generic manufacturers in countries such as India posed for 
</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical research-and-development industry. It also saw that devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries were increasingly using their superior numbers in WIPO to put 
</p>
<p>forward initiatives that favored their own position as net importers of foreign 
</p>
<p>technology. During the early 1980s, a small group of Washington-based policy 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurs had conceived the idea of linking the intellectual property regime 
</p>
<p>to the trade regime. Pfizer executives, including the CEO Edmund Pratt, were 
</p>
<p>among the leading proponents of this idea. Essentially, their policy idea was to get 
</p>
<p>an agreement on intellectual property into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
</p>
<p>Trade (GATT). Among other things, such an agreement would be enforceable under 
</p>
<p>GATT dispute-resolution procedures. Existing intellectual property treaties such 
</p>
<p>as the Berne Convention lacked meaningful enforcement mechanisms. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>the wide membership of GATT meant that the enforcement mechanism would be 
</p>
<p>potentially available for use against more states.
</p>
<p> Pfizer executives used their established business networks to disseminate the 
</p>
<p>idea of a trade-based approach to intellectual property. Pratt began delivering 
</p>
<p>speeches at business forums such as the National Foreign Trade Council and the 
</p>
<p>Business Round Table, outlining the links between trade, intellectual property, and 
</p>
<p>investment. As a CEO of a major U.S. company, he could work the trade-associa-
</p>
<p>tion scene at the highest levels. Other Pfizer senior executives also began to push 
</p>
<p>the intellectual property issue within national and international trade associations. 
</p>
<p>Gerald Laubach, president of Pfizer Inc., was on the board of the Pharmaceuti-
</p>
<p>cal Manufacturers Association and on the Council on Competitiveness set up by 
</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan; Lou Clemente, Pfizer&rsquo;s general counsel, headed up the 
</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Committee of the U.S. Council for International Business; 
</p>
<p>Bob Neimeth, Pfizer International&rsquo;s president, was the chair of the U.S. side of 
</p>
<p>the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the Organisation for Economic 
</p>
<p>Co-operation and Development. The message about intellectual property went out 
</p>
<p>along the business networks to chambers of commerce, business councils, business 
</p>
<p>committees, trade associations, and peak business bodies. Thus, Pfizer executives 
</p>
<p>who occupied key positions in strategic business organizations were able to recruit 
</p>
<p>the support of more and more organizations for a trade-based approach to intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property. With every such enrollment, the business power behind the case 
</p>
<p>for such an approach became harder and harder for governments to resist.
</p>
<p> Pfizer also managed to gain representation on a key committee, the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee on Trade Negotiations, created in 1974 by the U.S. Congress under U.S. 
</p>
<p>drahos </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>207
</p>
<p>trade law as an organization of numerous private-sector advisory committees 
</p>
<p>with the Advisory Committee on Trade Negotiations at its apex. The purpose of 
</p>
<p>this committee was to ensure a concordance between official U.S. trade objectives 
</p>
<p>and the U.S. commercial sector. Pratt, with the assistance of other senior execu-
</p>
<p>tives within Pfizer, began to put himself forward within business circles as some-
</p>
<p>one who could develop U.S. business thinking about trade and economic policy. 
</p>
<p>In 1979, Pratt became a member of the committee and in 1981 its chairman. During 
</p>
<p>the 1980s, representatives from the most senior levels of big business within the 
</p>
<p>United States were appointed by the president to serve on the committee. Out 
</p>
<p>of this business crucible came the crucial strategic thinking on the trade-based 
</p>
<p>approach to intellectual property.
</p>
<p> With Pratt at the helm and the CEOs of IBM and Du Pont Corporation serving on 
</p>
<p>the committee, it began to develop a sweeping trade and investment agenda. John 
</p>
<p>Opel, the then chairman of IBM, headed this task force. During Pratt&rsquo;s six years of 
</p>
<p>chairmanship, the Advisory Committee on Trade Negotiations worked closely with 
</p>
<p>William E. Brock III, the U.S. trade representative from 1981 to 1985, and with Clay-
</p>
<p>ton K. Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative from 1985 to 1989, helping to shape the 
</p>
<p>services, investment, and intellectual property trade agenda of the United States.
</p>
<p> The committee&rsquo;s basic message to the U.S. government was that it should pull 
</p>
<p>every lever at its disposal in order to obtain the correct result for the United States 
</p>
<p>on intellectual property issues. U.S. executive directors of the International Mon-
</p>
<p>etary Fund and World Bank could ask about intellectual property when casting 
</p>
<p>their votes on loans and access to bank facilities; U.S. aid and development agen-
</p>
<p>cies could use their funds to help spread the intellectual property gospel. Over 
</p>
<p>time, the message was heard and acted upon. Provisions protecting intellectual 
</p>
<p>property as an investment activity were automatically included in the Bilateral 
</p>
<p>Investment Treaty program that the United States was engaged in with develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries in the 1980s. Means of influence of a personal and powerful kind 
</p>
<p>also began to operate. George Shultz, the secretary of state, discussed the intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property issue with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, according 
</p>
<p>to Jacques Gorlin in his 1985 analysis of the trade-based approach to intellectual 
</p>
<p>property. President Reagan in his message to Congress of February 6, 1986 entitled 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;America&rsquo;s Agenda for the Future&rdquo; proposed that a key item in that agenda should 
</p>
<p>be greater protection for U.S. intellectual property abroad. This was consistent 
</p>
<p>with the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Trade Negotiations that 
</p>
<p>the development of a U.S. strategy for intellectual property be endorsed by the 
</p>
<p>president and the cabinet. The ground was being prepared for intellectual property 
</p>
<p>to become the stuff of big-picture political dealing, and not just technical trade 
</p>
<p>negotiation. The ground was being prepared for the TRIPS Agreement.

</p>
<p> The detailed story of how TRIPS came to be part of the Final Act of the Uru-
</p>
<p>guay Round has been told elsewhere.16 Key to the achievement of TRIPS was the 
</p>
<p>formation of the Intellectual Property Committee. The Intellectual Property Com-
</p>
<p>mittee was an ad hoc coalition of thirteen major U.S. corporations; Bristol-Myers, 
</p>
<p>DuPont, FMC Corporation, General Electric, General Motors, Hewlett- Packard, 
</p>
<p>IBM, Johnson and Johnson, Merck, Monsanto, Pfizer, Rockwell International, and 
</p>
<p>Warner Communications. It described itself as &ldquo;dedicated to the negotiation of a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive agreement on intellectual property in the current GATT round of 
</p>
<p>multilateral trade negotiations.&rdquo;17
</p>
<p> Europe was the key target for the committee. Once Europe was on board, Japan 
</p>
<p>was likely to follow, or at least would not raise significant opposition. The sup-
</p>
<p>port of European and Japanese corporations was crucial. What followed was a 
</p>
<p>consensus-building exercise carried out at the highest levels of senior corporate 
</p>
<p>management. CEOs of U.S. companies belonging to the Intellectual Property Com-
</p>
<p>mittee would contact their counterparts in Europe and Japan and urge them to put 
</p>
<p>pressure on their governments to support the inclusion of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>in the Uruguay Round. Ultimately, the linkages that were created between U.S., 
</p>
<p>European, and Japanese companies led to the joint release in 1988 of a suggested 
</p>
<p>draft text of an agreement on intellectual property.
</p>
<p> TRIPS was a stunning negotiating victory that was made possible because a 
</p>
<p>small group of individuals in the 1980s saw the possibilities of networked gover-
</p>
<p>nance, especially when those networks could capture and deploy a &ldquo;big stick&rdquo; in 
</p>
<p>the form of U.S. trade threats. Within these intersecting TNC networks, there were 
</p>
<p>pools of technical expertise upon which to draw for the purposes of producing 
</p>
<p>a draft agreement, while other networks steered the draft through a multilateral 
</p>
<p>trade negotiation involving more than one hundred states that lasted from 1986 to 
</p>
<p>1993. Important to this achievement were a small number of business actors who 
</p>
<p>created ever-widening circles of influence that enrolled more actors in networks 
</p>
<p>that had TRIPS as their mission.
</p>
<p>post-trips
</p>
<p>The post-TRIPS era has seen a shift to bilateral trade agreements as the principal 
</p>
<p>means for spreading intellectual property norms by means of the trade regime. 
</p>
<p>These agreements contain standards that are either the same as or higher than 
</p>
<p>those to be found in TRIPS. In the United States, TNCs continue to monitor these 
</p>
<p>agreements through a U.S. trade representative advisory committee called IFAC-3 
</p>
<p>(the Industry Functional Advisory Committee&ndash;3). IFAC-3 is made up of twenty 
</p>
<p>members drawn from Industry Sector Advisory Committees and another twenty 
</p>
<p>drahos </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>209
</p>
<p>members drawn from private-sector areas who provide the committee with a large 
</p>
<p>pool of expertise in intellectual property. The private-sector members are: the 
</p>
<p>International Intellectual Property Alliance; The Gorlin Group; Pfizer, Inc.; the Law 
</p>
<p>Offices of Hope H. Camp, representing Eli Lilly and Company; the Pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>Research and Manufacturers of America; Cowan, Leibowitz and Latman, P.C.; the 
</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc.; Merck and Company, Inc.; the National Foreign 
</p>
<p>Trade Council, Inc.; Powell, Goldstein, Frazer and Murphy, LLP, representing the 
</p>
<p>Biotechnology Industry Organization; Time Warner Inc.; the International Anti-
</p>
<p>Counterfeiting Coalition; the Recording Industry Association of America; the Intel-
</p>
<p>lectual Property Owners Association; and Levi Strauss and Company.
</p>
<p> IFAC-3 works across all U.S. trade initiatives on intellectual property, whether 
</p>
<p>bilateral, regional, or multilateral. It is thus able to coordinate at a technical 
</p>
<p>level the work it does across these different forums, thereby ensuring that U.S. 
</p>
<p>trade-negotiating initiatives push intellectual property standards in the direc-
</p>
<p>tion that U.S. industry would like. IFAC-3&rsquo;s technical expertise, as well as the 
</p>
<p>expertise available to it from its members&rsquo; corporate legal divisions, means that, 
</p>
<p>for example, it can evaluate a country&rsquo;s intellectual property standards in detail

</p>
<p>when that country seeks accession to the WTO, and it can provide detailed assess-
</p>
<p>ments of the standards that U.S. trade representative negotiators must bring home  
</p>
<p>in a negotiation.
</p>
<p> The other striking feature of the post-TRIPS era has been the increasing 
</p>
<p>involvement of civil-society NGOs in intellectual property policy. Today, there 
</p>
<p>are thousands of NGOs working on issues such as access to medicines, access to 
</p>
<p>knowledge, biopiracy, indigenous intellectual property rights, licensing, Internet 
</p>
<p>governance, copyright-user rights, software freedom, and so on. The presence of 
</p>
<p>NGOs working on a range of intellectual property issues provides scope for an alli-
</p>
<p>ance between developing states and NGOs. United minority factions can, under 
</p>
<p>certain conditions, secure global regulatory change, the Declaration on the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement and Public Health of 2001 being an example. Western NGOs are at their 
</p>
<p>most effective when they can capture Western media interest and publicity. Often 
</p>
<p>this requires a crisis of some kind. It has taken literally millions of deaths in Africa 
</p>
<p>in order for the Western media to become interested in the links between pat-
</p>
<p>ents, price, and AIDS drugs, despite the fact that cartelism in the pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>industry has been a problem for the health-care system of developing countries 
</p>
<p>for decades.18
</p>
<p>the future
</p>
<p>The possibility of securing change that benefits citizens in the context of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights should not be overestimated. For the most part, intellectual 
</p>
<p>property policy ends up mired in complex debates over rules and systems that only 
</p>
<p>a few insiders really understand. Ignorant or corrupt politicians will nine times out 
</p>
<p>of ten listen to the TNC representative who promises that bad things will happen 
</p>
<p>to investment if policy X, which favors stronger intellectual property rights, is not 
</p>
<p>followed. Of course, disagreements over the rules of intellectual property do break 
</p>
<p>out among TNCs. A good example is the recent conflict over the rules that regu-
</p>
<p>late the use of continuations in the U.S. patent system. Continuations are applica-
</p>
<p>tions for inventions that have already been claimed in earlier applications. They 
</p>
<p>are a way of keeping the application process going. Continuations are used most 
</p>
<p>heavily in the biotechnology and chemical fields. The lack of restrictions on their 
</p>
<p>use means that examiners have to devote time to reworking applications already 
</p>
<p>examined, time that could be used to deal with new applications.19
</p>
<p> As part of its attempt to reduce its volume of applications, the U.S. Patent and 
</p>
<p>Trademark Office issued rules placing limits on the use of continuations.20 This rule 
</p>
<p>change was supported by a number of large companies, including Intel. Intel has 
</p>
<p>a patent strategy based on filing for many patents and obtaining them as quickly 
</p>
<p>drahos </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>211
</p>
<p>as possible. Rules that allow an applicant to play for delay hold no advantage for 
</p>
<p>it and in fact hurt its patent strategy, because continuations divert scarce exami-
</p>
<p>nation resources to applications with earlier priority dates. (Applications forming 
</p>
<p>part of a continuation chain get the benefit of earlier priority dates.) Intel thus 
</p>
<p>supported the patent office rule change.21 Members of the biotechnology industry, 
</p>
<p>on the other hand, are in the unfortunate position of not ever being sure what 
</p>
<p>they have invented. The complexity of the biochemical world means that they are 
</p>
<p>often left guessing, but they nevertheless file patents early and then use the con-
</p>
<p>tinuation process to refine their original application.22 The biotech industry came 
</p>
<p>out against the patent office&rsquo;s rule changes. GlaxoSmithKline was part of a group 
</p>
<p>of plaintiffs that were successful in temporarily stopping the patent office from 
</p>
<p>implementing the rules on November 1, 2007.
</p>
<p> The above example shows how a reform desired by one TNC player may be 
</p>
<p>seen as damaging by another. Compromises and incremental rule changes are the 
</p>
<p>usual results of this kind of conflict. But the divisive politics that are generated 
</p>
<p>by specific rules of intellectual property should not be confused with the global 
</p>
<p>politics that surrounds the institution of intellectual property. Here, TNCs remain 
</p>
<p>united, because despite their different business models and strategic uses of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property, they understand that the globalization of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>is consistent with their long-term investment strategies. The source of their unity 
</p>
<p>does not lie in any of the abstract philosophies of intellectual property, such as 
</p>
<p>natural property rights, utilitarian-based cost-benefit approaches, or personality 
</p>
<p>theories, because all of these would set limits on the corporate ownership of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property. Rather, TNCs are unified by the belief they will all do better in 
</p>
<p>a world where states and citizens have embraced an ideology that favors hyper-
</p>
<p>strong intellectual property rights because that ideology enables those TNCs to 
</p>
<p>invest in turning knowledge from a public good into a private good and to set the 
</p>
<p>terms of access to it.
</p>
<p> The claim being made here about the unity of TNCs should not be read as a 
</p>
<p>claim about specific rules of intellectual property. TNCs will often be opponents in 
</p>
<p>the context of a given set of international business rules because of the way those 
</p>
<p>rules limit or increase their individual strategic opportunities. Other essays in this 
</p>
<p>book have drawn attention to the divisions among TNCs in the context of software 
</p>
<p>patents and the Broadcasting Treaty. The unity of TNCs does not operate at the 
</p>
<p>level of rules, but rather at the level of deep ideology, because it is deep ideology 
</p>
<p>that defines the evolutionary space in which some institutions flourish and oth-
</p>
<p>ers do not. Even if, for example, an Intel and a GlaxoSmithKline disagree about 
</p>
<p>the reform of continuations in the context of the U.S. patent system, they remain 
</p>
<p>unified on the need for a strong patent system to be spread to as many countries 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;ip world&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>212
</p>
<p>as possible and for that system to be made cheap and easy to use so that they can 
</p>
<p>pursue their respective global patenting strategies. The inevitable disagreements 
</p>
<p>among TNCs over the specifics of intellectual property rules should not blind us to 
</p>
<p>their deeper-level ideological unity over the constraints to be placed on the evolu-
</p>
<p>tionary space of intellectual property institutions.
</p>
<p> A good example of the unified TNC ideology that surrounds the institution 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property is the proposal by Japan, the European Community, the 
</p>
<p>United States, and Switzerland for a new plurilateral Anti-Counterfeiting Trade 
</p>
<p>Agreement. The idea behind the proposal is to forge new standards for the enforce-
</p>
<p>ment of intellectual property rights to combat global counterfeiting and piracy. All 
</p>
<p>TNCs have been calling for some time for more to be done on the enforcement 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property, calls that have been broadcast through state mouthpieces 
</p>
<p>such as G8 gatherings. The same states and TNCs that pushed for TRIPS are now 
</p>
<p>pushing a global enforcement agenda that will deeply affect the rights and privacy 
</p>
<p>of citizens in developed and developing countries alike. The enforcement push is 
</p>
<p>real, and it will profoundly affect policing resources in developing countries over 
</p>
<p>the coming decades. The e-mail message below that circulated recently in South 
</p>
<p>Africa might also be seen as a future leitmotif in which states have been persuaded 
</p>
<p>to rearrange their criminal enforcement priorities:
</p>
<p>Please take note as this is scheduled for the weekend. . . .
</p>
<p> Please note that SAPS [the South African Police Service] are having roadblocks 
</p>
<p>where they will check all CD Recordables in your car. If they find any, you get 
</p>
<p>arrested and taken down to the police station so that all of them can be checked for 
</p>
<p>pirated copies.
</p>
<p> The minimum fine is R3,000 and you have to pay it immediately or they will 
</p>
<p>detain you until you come up with the money. So if you have any pirated CDs please 
</p>
<p>discard them and if you have empty recordable CDs or CDs that have information 
</p>
<p>other than music and movies then keep them out of your car.
</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t say you were not warned.23
</p>
<p> The philosophy that unites TNCs in the institutional politics of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property is a form of absolutism that elevates the rights of investors above all else. 
</p>
<p>A world in which investor absolutism drives the making of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>law is a world in which the welfare of all citizens will be diminished in vital areas 
</p>
<p>such as education, health, and privacy.
</p>
<p> Developing countries and civil society can fight these TNC agendas, but in order 
</p>
<p>to do so effectively, they have to form much closer political bonds than they have 
</p>
<p>to date. While a few developing countries can resist developed-country intellectual 
</p>
<p>property agendas, they are doing so in a nuanced way, picking and choosing their 
</p>
<p>drahos </p>

</p>
<p>issues and interests. India, for example, in the Uruguay Round of trade negotia-
</p>
<p>tions, concentrated its resistance on the patents part of TRIPS and not on copy-
</p>
<p>right, even though the latter has just as many implications for access to knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Vietnam, when it signed a bilateral trade treaty with the United States in July 
</p>
<p>2000, accepted a chapter on intellectual property, but was successful in keeping out 
</p>
<p>a provision that would have limited its capacity for the parallel importation and 
</p>
<p>resale of goods without the consent of the patent holder. Small to medium-sized 
</p>
<p>parties involved in a negotiation with the United States or the European Union on 
</p>
<p>intellectual property issues tend to adopt a harm-minimization strategy, agreeing 
</p>
<p>to intellectual property standards that they believe will not hurt them too much.
</p>
<p> There is, however, a collective cost for developing countries in adopting this 
</p>
<p>harm-minimization approach. As they become integrated into the global archi-
</p>
<p>tecture of intellectual property by means of free-trade agreements, they create 
</p>
<p>for themselves an institutional box beyond which it becomes more difficult to 
</p>
<p>experiment with real alternatives to the existing system. Having entered a web of 
</p>
<p>international obligations (TRIPS, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the International 
</p>
<p>Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, and so on), a web dotted with 
</p>
<p>enforcement spiders (for example, the WTO&rsquo;s dispute-resolution mechanism), they 
</p>
<p>become more cautious. When confronted with a radical model of access to knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, the first reaction of developing-country officials will be to ask, &ldquo;Is this con-
</p>
<p>sistent with our international obligations?&rdquo;&mdash;the answer to which will keep many 
</p>
<p>lawyers joyfully occupied for a long time.
</p>
<p> The need for a cooperative multilateral leadership on intellectual property by 
</p>
<p>developing countries has become increasingly urgent. The monopoly control of the 
</p>
<p>production of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) by Roche and the lack of global coordination by 
</p>
<p>countries in dealing with the problem of inadequate stockpiles of oseltamivir, espe-
</p>
<p>cially in high-risk developing countries, shows that the patent system has become a 
</p>
<p>factor in the management of pandemic risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
</p>
<p>had recommended that countries stockpile oseltamivir. Yet because of the patent 
</p>
<p>price, many countries could not afford to build a stockpile. As a study showed, this 
</p>
<p>produced, in risk-management terms, the absurd situation of poor countries (e.g. 
</p>
<p>Vietnam, Cambodia) that were also high risk in terms of the flu pandemic breaking 
</p>
<p>out having the smallest stockpiles, while the lowest-risk countries (the United States 
</p>
<p>and the European Union countries), which were also the richest, having the largest 
</p>
<p>stockpiles.24 Moreover, the possibility of generic production was severely hampered 
</p>
<p>by the fact that Roche did not disclose the patent position of oseltamivir, leaving 
</p>
<p>public-health officials uncertain about what they could do in terms of importing 
</p>
<p>or manufacturing it. Similarly, the diffusion of climate-change technologies will be 
</p>
<p>crucially affected by intellectual property rights over those technologies.
</p>
<p> &ldquo;ip world&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>214
</p>
<p> Clearly, developing countries should be collectively thinking about ways in 
</p>
<p>which to manage intellectual property in the context of global risks such as pan-
</p>
<p>demics and climate change. Their current philosophy of mild cooperation in mul-
</p>
<p>tilateral forums while defecting to short-term gains in bilateral contexts is incon-
</p>
<p>sistent in the management of risk. More generally, if developing countries really 
</p>
<p>wish to change the evolutionary space of intellectual property institutions so that 
</p>
<p>real alternatives can flourish, they will have to design much better and stronger 
</p>
<p>coalitions than they have to date. It is not good enough, for example, for develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries to unite in the WTO on a disclosure obligation with respect to the 
</p>
<p>patenting of genetic resources and then for some of those developing countries to 
</p>
<p>agree to free-trade agreements that do not support that WTO position. Obviously 
</p>
<p>this kind of coalition breakdown simply creates incentives for the United States to 
</p>
<p>continue to operate outside of multilateral forums.
</p>
<p> For civil-society groups working on intellectual property issues, the good news 
</p>
<p>is that there are more groups engaged across a broader spectrum of issues than ever 
</p>
<p>before. Among other things, this increases the possibilities of coalition building and, 
</p>
<p>as the negotiations on the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health showed, 
</p>
<p>a coalition of state and civil-society actors can be forged and wielded successfully. 
</p>
<p>But just as civil-society actors can build coalitions and networks, so can the TNCs, 
</p>
<p>with very different power outcomes. For civil-society actors, the prescription is to 
</p>
<p>continue to invest in the creation of alternative models of knowledge creation and to 
</p>
<p>float these in various national and international policy forums. Many of these will be 
</p>
<p>ignored or will fail to gain wide support. But some will take hold, especially in times 
</p>
<p>of crisis, such as a pandemic or the environmental crises that are predicted to accom-
</p>
<p>pany climate change, when state actors are desperately looking for solutions. For 
</p>
<p>civil-society actors, floating new models for the growth and diffusion of knowledge, 
</p>
<p>creating coalitions around those models, and acting in times of crisis are the basic 
</p>
<p>elements of a strategy to change the evolutionary space of intellectual property.

<p>The	Idea	of	Access	to	Knowledge		
</p>
<p>and	the	Information	Commons:		
</p>
<p>Long-Term	Trends	and	Basic	Elements
</p>
<p>Yochai Benkler
</p>
<p>In the global networked information economy, the constituent elements of human 
</p>
<p>welfare and development depend on information and knowledge. Well-designed 
</p>
<p>health systems and practices, research on disease and health, and access to medical 
</p>
<p>innovation and its products go directly to the ability of people to live a long and 
</p>
<p>healthy life. So, too, agronomic and biological research and learning, which have 
</p>
<p>contributed significantly to food productivity in some regions, have the poten-
</p>
<p>tial to reduce the prevalence of chronic malnutrition and hunger. Information and 
</p>
<p>communications technology, books, educational materials, and learning practices 
</p>
<p>promise improved literacy and educational attainment so that people around the 
</p>
<p>world can live more engaged and fulfilling lives. Better access to distributed media 
</p>
<p>hold out the promise of a more participatory public sphere, greater accountability 
</p>
<p>of governments, and at least attenuation of the hold that authoritarian govern-
</p>
<p>ments have over what their citizens know and think.
</p>
<p> In the past few years, a diverse coalition of movements, political and economic 
</p>
<p>actors, NGOs, scientists, and other academics have begun to coalesce around the 
</p>
<p>idea, or the catch phrase, &ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo;&mdash;A2K. The coalition is diverse. It 
</p>
<p>includes activists concerned with access to AIDS treatments alongside European 
</p>
<p>free-software developers concerned with software patents and digital rights man-
</p>
<p>agement (DRM). It includes large, developing nations such as Brazil and Argen-
</p>
<p>tina alongside large multinational corporations such as Cisco Systems and IBM. It 
</p>
<p>includes scientists concerned with open-journal publications and NGOs concerned 
</p>
<p>with information and communications technology. The basic claim of this unlikely 
</p>
<p>coalition is that information policy, on a global scale, is of central importance to a 
</p>
<p>wide range of human values. Economic concerns with innovation and growth, on 
</p>
<p>the one hand, and the core political values of human development, justice, and 
</p>
<p>freedom, on the other, are being affected by a set of policies historically thought </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>benkler 218
</p>
<p>of in technical terms, but now increasingly seen and engaged for what they really 
</p>
<p>are: policies that are of central importance to political economy and the moral 
</p>
<p>quality of contemporary society.
</p>
<p>why now?
</p>
<p>The emergence of the access to knowledge movement is usefully understood in 
</p>
<p>light of four long-term intellectual and material-historical trends. The first of these 
</p>
<p>is the arc of the self-understanding of postcolonial societies, especially regarding 
</p>
<p>strategies of economic development. In the 1950s and 1960s, the period of decol-
</p>
<p>onization led to the creation of a large number of countries, some through vio-
</p>
<p>lent liberation fights, others through the more or less voluntary acquiescence by 
</p>
<p>colonial powers in the loss of empire. Throughout this period and increasingly in 
</p>
<p>the 1960s and 1970s, the question of how these newly emerging societies were to 
</p>
<p>manage their economies and societies was framed by the terms of self-determi-
</p>
<p>nation and independence that were so central to the struggle for liberation more 
</p>
<p>generally. At a practical level, this led to the widespread adoption of autarky, or 
</p>
<p>self-sufficiency&mdash;not only in the newly independent countries, but in older, but 
</p>
<p>nonetheless poor countries, most prominently in Latin America. The adoption of 
</p>
<p>economic self-sufficiency as a core mechanism of independence led to the pursuit 
</p>
<p>of import substitution (replacing imports with domestically produced goods) and 
</p>
<p>rapid industrialization as core goals, often implemented through national owner-
</p>
<p>ship and high tariffs to protect locally owned industries. Interlaced with the pur-
</p>
<p>suit of economic self-sufficiency was the ideological battle between capitalism and 
</p>
<p>Communism. The latter&rsquo;s basic commitment to forced redistribution was, unsur-
</p>
<p>prisingly, congenial to at least some segments of the impoverished former colonies. 
</p>
<p>In opposition, one also saw the rise of nationalism as an alternative totalizing ide-
</p>
<p>ology to Communism, as internal elites and popular movements battled in many of 
</p>
<p>the still-unstable new countries. The consistent use of local battles as proxies for 
</p>
<p>the Cold War did not help.
</p>
<p> By the middle to late 1980s, however, import substitution and self-sufficiency 
had come to be seen as failed economic strategies. Increasingly, and with greater 
</p>
<p>speed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, integration into a liberal, global trad-
</p>
<p>ing system came to be seen as the sole or at least the dominant strategy available 
</p>
<p>to countries, poor as well as rich, to promote growth and development. Dissenting 
</p>
<p>voices continued to be heard, but very few governments followed them through-
</p>
<p>out the late 1980s and through the 1990s.
</p>
<p> The second, much longer-term trend underlying the A2K movement is the shift 
from industrial to information economies. The history of the Western shift from </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the information commons 219
</p>
<p>agrarian to industrial, from industrial to service-based, and from service-based to 
</p>
<p>information-based economies has been the subject of countless books and articles. 
</p>
<p>The emphases differ, but the basic arc is not contested. This longer-term history 
</p>
<p>has been telescoped in curtailed form in many of the newly independent states of 
</p>
<p>the latter half of the twentieth century. In these countries, rapid industrialization 
</p>
<p>was characterized by the same dislocation and misery that accompanied European 
</p>
<p>industrialization in the nineteenth century. This industrialization came to fill the 
</p>
<p>place of some of the production in the industrialized economies as these econo-
</p>
<p>mies moved toward information manipulation as their core activities. But industrial 
</p>
<p>production under these terms was dependent upon the information-rich inputs&mdash; 
</p>
<p>innovation, financial capital, and marketing&mdash;that dominate the wealthy econo-
</p>
<p>mies. The more recently emerging economies, as well as their poorer followers, are 
</p>
<p>themselves trying to move into the later stages of capitalism at a more rapid pace. In 
</p>
<p>a world trade system typified by industrialized peripheries and an information-rich 
</p>
<p>core, the rules regulating the production and exchange of information, knowledge, 
</p>
<p>and culture have therefore become a major battleground over competitiveness 
</p>
<p>between the already-developed and the newly developing countries, or between 
</p>
<p>the postindustrial and the newly industrialized economies.
</p>
<p> Access to information and knowledge as basic inputs into processes of learn-
</p>
<p>ing and innovation thus have become a central pathway to growth and develop-
</p>
<p>ment and ultimately to competition with the wealthiest economies. The newly 
</p>
<p>emerging economies need access to the existing stocks of knowledge&mdash;such as 
</p>
<p>the existing outputs of science and technological innovation&mdash;to speed up their 
</p>
<p>ability to achieve something like parity in the global knowledge economy, while 
</p>
<p>poorer developing economies and poorer regions in unevenly developing countries 
</p>
<p>require that access as part of obtaining the preconditions to human development.
</p>
<p> This long term-trend toward industrialization and beyond it toward a global 
</p>
<p>knowledge economy is therefore at the very root of what has become the A2K 
</p>
<p>movement. It both necessitates the emergence of access to knowledge as a core 
</p>
<p>element of concern with human development and gives it a focal point in those 
</p>
<p>global institutions that have been the locus of the assertion and institutional-
</p>
<p>ization of control over knowledge flows: most prominently, the exclusive rights 
</p>
<p>regimes usually collected under the umbrella term &ldquo;intellectual property.&rdquo; These 
</p>
<p>have become a central part of the basic legal underpinnings of wealth and poverty, 
</p>
<p>productivity and development, in the contemporary global economy and have 
</p>
<p>therefore unsurprisingly become the locus of contestation around which the A2K  
</p>
<p>movement is coalescing.
</p>
<p> The first two long-term trends combined to underwrite the integration of 
</p>
<p>the international intellectual property system into the global trade system. They </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>220
</p>
<p>have also been the reason that the ways information, knowledge, and culture 
</p>
<p>are produced and managed have become so central to questions of global jus-
</p>
<p>tice and development. They undergird the development of the idea of &ldquo;intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property&rdquo; and the rise of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
</p>
<p>Rights (TRIPS) Agreement. In brief, over the course of the late nineteenth cen-
</p>
<p>tury and throughout most of the twentieth, copyright and patents were treated, 
</p>
<p>in the Berne and Paris treaties, in particular, as distinct regimes, and their inter-
</p>
<p>national enforcement was largely a system of reciprocity and mutual recognition 
</p>
<p>of national policies. These agreements were largely peripheral to the international 
</p>
<p>trade system and had practically no teeth. In the 1970s, some of the countries 
</p>
<p>that were focused on import substitution and the development of local industries 
</p>
<p>passed laws, such as India&rsquo;s 1970 Patent Act, that withdrew patent protection in 
</p>
<p>core industries, such as pharmaceuticals, allowing their indigenous industries to 
</p>
<p>displace imports. As Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite have documented, in the 
</p>
<p>1980s and until the mid-1990s, the core industries&mdash;orchestrated primarily by the 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical industry, but joined by other players such as the Hollywood stu-
</p>
<p>dios and proprietary software companies&mdash;shifted the global regulation of infor-
</p>
<p>mation and innovation away from the global copyright and patent regimes cen-
</p>
<p>tered on the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and toward the 
</p>
<p>trade regime.1
</p>
<p> This push was concluded with the entry of TRIPS into force in 1995 as part of 
</p>
<p>the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that created 
</p>
<p>the WTO. In the decade that has followed, this push has been complemented by 
</p>
<p>the internal drive within WIPO to save itself from obsolescence by offering ser-
</p>
<p>vices to those actors who successfully pushed the TRIPS Agreement. Beginning in 
</p>
<p>the mid-1990s, WIPO became a forum for pushing new, extensive intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights and for offering technical assistance that would speed up adoption of 
</p>
<p>highly protective property rights regimes throughout the world. During this period 
</p>
<p>too, the TRIPS agreement became a baseline of minimal protection, rather than a 
</p>
<p>standard, while the coalition that pushed for its initial adoption further pushed 
</p>
<p>both through WIPO and through U.S. bilateral free-trade agreements for the adop-
</p>
<p>tion of the even more restrictive &ldquo;TRIPS-plus&rdquo; protections. This steady trajectory 
</p>
<p>is a product of the combination of the increasing importance of information to 
</p>
<p>economic growth as well as to capturing value from economic production and of 
</p>
<p>the wide perception that integration into the global trade regime is the only option 
</p>
<p>for nations wishing to avoid stagnation and underdevelopment.
</p>
<p> The most important institutional and intellectual moves in this period were 
</p>
<p>the creation of the idea of &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; itself and its inclusion in the 
</p>
<p>trade regime, the weaving of diverse types of mechanisms to increase the degree 
</p>
<p>benkler </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>221
</p>
<p>of exclusivity everywhere, and the abstraction of the protected category. The first 
</p>
<p>of these equated innovation with strong intellectual property rights and wealth 
</p>
<p>with the export of goods that were intellectual property. Providing industries 
</p>
<p>that depend on exclusivity with a stronger enforcement mechanism globally thus 
</p>
<p>became a core trade goal. The creation of the idea of intellectual property and its 
</p>
<p>inclusion in the trade regime also shifted the institutional base of the relevant 
</p>
<p>national negotiators from more locally protective and development-sensitive gov-
</p>
<p>ernment ministries such as those of culture or education to ministries more ori-
</p>
<p>ented toward global trade and industry. The negotiating dynamics of the terms of 
</p>
<p>trade therefore were easier to tilt in favor of the intellectual property exporters, in 
</p>
<p>exchange for concessions, real or imagined, on agriculture, textiles, and so on.
</p>
<p> The second move consisted of weaving unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral 
</p>
<p>mechanisms together to form a net that could be used to ratchet up the level of 
</p>
<p>protection everywhere. The industries pushing for stronger exclusive rights 
</p>
<p>regimes were able, over the course of this period, to identify various weak spots, 
</p>
<p>in terms of political economy, where it was possible to achieve higher protection. 
</p>
<p>It might be the U.S. trade representative or the European Commission; it might be 
</p>
<p>WIPO or the WTO; or it might be a bilateral trade agreement with a country that 
</p>
<p>had much to gain in areas other than the information economy by agreeing to a 
</p>
<p>particularly broad set of protections. In each case, victory in one arena was avail-
</p>
<p>able as a baseline for renegotiating the terms in other arenas and for generalizing 
</p>
<p>the practice globally. This playable international system assures that there is no 
</p>
<p>clear bottleneck to ratcheting up protection while at the same time placing inter-
</p>
<p>national harmonization requirements as a backstop against the &ldquo;loss&rdquo; of protec-
</p>
<p>tions already agreed to in some other forum.
</p>
<p> The third major move was an intellectual one of generalization or abstraction: 
</p>
<p>The various different industries such as Hollywood, pharmaceuticals, and semi-
</p>
<p>conductors came to be seen not as discrete industries with special issues, but as 
</p>
<p>instances of &ldquo;the intellectual property industries.&rdquo; This, in turn, pushed govern-
</p>
<p>ments to move from seeing intellectual property policy as involving a series of 
</p>
<p>discrete policy issues that represented industry-specific tradeoffs to viewing these 
</p>
<p>problems as a broad project of setting industrial policy in a global information 
</p>
<p>economy, one in which they were information exporters. And finally, this allowed 
</p>
<p>the United States, the European Union, and Japan to move from seeing each other 
</p>
<p>purely as competitors to seeing themselves as having a common interest as infor-
</p>
<p>mation exporters, forming a formidable interest bloc in the institutions of the 
</p>
<p>world trade system.
</p>
<p> However, the rise of the information economy has also played a role in fos-
</p>
<p>tering the counterforce that has today resulted in the emergence of the access to 
</p>
<p>the information commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>222
</p>
<p>knowledge movement. It combined with two further long-term trends to form a 
</p>
<p>response to the rise of the global trade and intellectual property system.
</p>
<p> The third long-term trend that has helped give rise to the A2K movement is 
</p>
<p>the shift from mass-mediated culture and monopoly telecommunications systems 
</p>
<p>to the networked information society. Mass media initially emerged with the rise 
</p>
<p>of electrically driven presses and automated typesetting and newspaper folding, 
</p>
<p>complemented by the rise of professionalized journalism and telegraph-based 
</p>
<p>news services around the middle of the nineteenth century. As rail travel and 
</p>
<p>steam-based trade increased the size of the relevant (that is, interdependent) soci-
</p>
<p>eties and economies over the course of the nineteenth century, high-cost commu-
</p>
<p>nications facilities led to the organization of communications and the public sphere 
</p>
<p>around large aggregations of capital. First in the telegraph, then in telephones, 
</p>
<p>long-distance communications were either monopolized by market players, as in 
</p>
<p>the United States, or nationalized, as in most other countries. In either case, only 
</p>
<p>large organizations with the capacity to amass capital were able to build systems. 
</p>
<p>As radio and later television joined the press, the capital costs of producing and 
</p>
<p>disseminating information, knowledge, and culture to the relevant communities 
</p>
<p>continued to be high. These formed the basis for the relatively concentrated media 
</p>
<p>environment typical of most countries in the world, whether the concentration 
</p>
<p>was market-based or state owned.
</p>
<p> The period beginning in the late 1980s saw rapid changes in the communications 
</p>
<p>and media environment. Initially, we saw the introduction of competition from new, 
</p>
<p>but still large-scale players introducing a more competitive market into telecommu-
</p>
<p>nications, both wired and wireless, and into the cultural industries and media.
</p>
<p> More dramatically, beginning in the mid-1990s, we saw the rise of Internet-
</p>
<p>based communications and the emergence of a networked information society and 
</p>
<p>economy based on the radical decentralization of information production. This 
</p>
<p>trend created new opportunities and new social forces that did not exist before or 
</p>
<p>at least that would not have been aligned before. Firms that dedicated themselves 
</p>
<p>to providing communications and computation found themselves aligned with 
</p>
<p>software programmers who wanted to participate in the free software movement; 
</p>
<p>citizen journalists saw themselves aligned with Wikipedia editors; NGOs found 
</p>
<p>themselves more effective than they were before and aligned with scientists, who 
</p>
<p>found that through networked communication they could sequence and annotate 
</p>
<p>the human genome faster than their commercial, proprietary competitors. The rise 
</p>
<p>of decentralized peer production and of nonmarket production in general and the 
</p>
<p>increased efficacy and practices of those who participated in the networked infor-
</p>
<p>mation economy provided some of the intellectual framing, as well as the surpris-
</p>
<p>ing alliances, that seem to characterize the A2K movement.
</p>
<p>benkler </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>223
</p>
<p> The fourth and final long-term trend that has propelled the A2K movement is 
</p>
<p>the shift in the global ideological framing of questions of justice and human free-
</p>
<p>dom. As the failures and excesses of both Communism and autarkic statism as via-
</p>
<p>ble and attractive alternatives to capitalist democracies came to be too painful to 
</p>
<p>ignore, so, too, did the limitations of simple realism in the international relations 
</p>
<p>sense, in which nation-states interact solely within a framework of machtpolitik. 
</p>
<p>Instead, we have seen the gradual rise of human rights, human dignity, and partici-
</p>
<p>patory politics as the more or less universal ideals toward which most societies in 
</p>
<p>the world aspire&mdash;if not in practice, in principle.
</p>
<p> There is, obviously, no simple, linear progression toward the adoption of human 
</p>
<p>rights as a framing ideal. To see this, one need look no further than the rise of fun-
</p>
<p>damentalism as a rejection of the modern, as one sees in contemporary U.S. politics 
</p>
<p>or in the Muslim world, or as a challenge to the liberal demand of treating others 
</p>
<p>with equal dignity, as arguably was demonstrated by the late 1990s rise of Hindu 
</p>
<p>nationalism. But the majority of countries and the majority of discourse focused 
</p>
<p>on engagement in the global system, rather than disengagement, has had to accept 
</p>
<p>some form of a human rights framework. In particular, in the last decade and a half, 
</p>
<p>we have seen the rise of the idea, associated primarily with Amartya Sen, of devel-
</p>
<p>opment as freedom, which integrates in important and interesting ways both the 
</p>
<p>civil-political and social-economic rights of the international human rights system.
</p>
<p> These four trends&mdash;the rise of a globalized, liberal trading system, the rise of 
</p>
<p>the information economy, the subsequent genesis of a networked information soci-
</p>
<p>ety in which information, knowledge, and culture have become central to human 
</p>
<p>welfare and economic growth and in which the production of all three increasingly 
</p>
<p>has become Internet based, radically decentralized, the domain of nonmarket or 
</p>
<p>small, independent actors, and finally, the rise of human rights in general as an 
</p>
<p>ideal and the idea of development as freedom&mdash;these undergird the rise of the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement.
</p>
<p> In the more immediate history since the mid-1990s, the convergence of all these 
</p>
<p>trends has manifested itself in the convergence of several initially independent and 
</p>
<p>disjointed efforts. The first was the access-to-medicines movement, which during 
</p>
<p>the 1990s received a major boost in visibility through its relation to the battles 
</p>
<p>over research-and-development priorities triggered by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. 
</p>
<p>To some extent, this was due to the sheer immensity of the devastation wrought 
</p>
<p>by the pandemic. But it was also likely due to the fact that HIV/AIDS is a disease 
</p>
<p>that strikes not only at the poor of Africa, but also at the very heart of the cultural 
</p>
<p>elites of the United States and Europe. As combination therapies that could halt 
</p>
<p>the progress of the HIV virus were developed in the late 1990s, the stark disparity 
</p>
<p>between outcomes for the wealthy and the poor became harder to ignore.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>224
</p>
<p> During the same period, but independently, the explosive growth of Internet 
</p>
<p>usage spawned two movements that were initially only very loosely linked. These 
</p>
<p>were the movements for Internet freedom, anchored in concerns over encryp-
</p>
<p>tion, privacy, and antipornography regulation, on the one hand, which domi-
</p>
<p>nated the concerns of the computer geeks, and the information commons move-
</p>
<p>ment, populated initially by librarians, academics, and different groups of geeks, 
</p>
<p>which responded to efforts by Hollywood and the recording industry to rein in the 
</p>
<p>Internet and to stem what these corporate entities saw as a threat to their entire 
</p>
<p>production model, but also as an opportunity to turn the Internet into a global 
</p>
<p>pay-for-play jukebox, by rapidly expanding copyright and a variety of copy-
</p>
<p>right-reinforcing mechanisms. In both cases, there were relatively few companies 
</p>
<p>systematically involved in resisting the expansion of exclusivity or censorship, 
</p>
<p>although opportunistically, the telecommunications carriers cooperated with these 
</p>
<p>civil-society efforts in order to avoid regulatory burdens aimed at forcing them 
</p>
<p>to enforce the various content restrictions sought. By the late 1990s, the free and 
</p>
<p>open-source software development communities began to grow from the engaged 
</p>
<p>technical communities they had been before into politically mobilized groups. The 
</p>
<p>open-source community focused on expanding the acceptability of this approach 
</p>
<p>among businesses and forged the affinity alliances with business that are becom-
</p>
<p>ing important in the present coalition, while the free-software movement focused 
</p>
<p>on the political mobilization of participants and on affinity alliances with the 
</p>
<p>global left. Together, these have become genuine grassroots movements around 
</p>
<p>questions of DRM and software patents, in particular, with hundreds of thousands 
</p>
<p>of participants around the world, and have played significant roles in policy mak-
</p>
<p>ing in the European Union concerning software patents, in the United States con-
</p>
<p>cerning trusted systems, and in Brazil, at least, concerning development initiatives.
</p>
<p> As the 1990s came to a close, a completely different set of actors began to 
</p>
<p>organize around the threats of enclosure, or the expansion of copyright and other 
</p>
<p>exclusive rights to ever-broader domains and uses of information and knowl-
</p>
<p>edge. Scientists, on two fronts, began to see intellectual property as a hindrance, 
</p>
<p>rather than a help. On one very publicly visible front, the Human Genome Proj-
</p>
<p>ect captured the imagination, because the prospect of patenting human genes 
</p>
<p>led to extensive public debate. But while the public at large was concerned with 
</p>
<p>metaphysical questions about owning human beings, in some sense, scientists 
</p>
<p>were mostly worried that they would be shut out of the ability to do research. 
</p>
<p>A major international effort incorporating academic scientists, government and 
</p>
<p>nonprofit funders, and even some pharmaceutical companies that were worried 
</p>
<p>about upstream patents became engaged in an unprecedented effort to sequence 
</p>
<p>as many genes as possible, as quickly as possible, and to publish them freely as 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>225
</p>
<p>quickly as possible to preempt their appropriation by Celera Genomics and other 
</p>
<p>private, proprietary efforts to sequence all or parts of the human genome. The 
</p>
<p>result was a mobilized segment of the scientific community.
</p>
<p> Over the same period, many of the same academics saw the rising costs of aca-
</p>
<p>demic journals, primarily scientific journals, and realized that although they were 
</p>
<p>writing the papers and providing peer review of them (typically for free), they 
</p>
<p>were required to pay high access fees to read those same materials because of the 
</p>
<p>highly concentrated nature of the journal-publishing industry. Scientists began to 
</p>
<p>adopt a wide range of open publishing efforts, beginning with ArXiv.org in physics, 
</p>
<p>e-Biomed in science, and later, the Public Library of Science, the Budapest Open 
</p>
<p>Access Initiative, and self-archiving. Parallel and independent of these were efforts 
</p>
<p>by librarians and archivists to deal with questions of digital archiving, obtaining and 
</p>
<p>structuring materials that could be archived and presenting them on the Internet.
</p>
<p> On the infrastructure side, two distinct movements were present. The first was 
</p>
<p>the more traditional, development-focused work on information and communi-
</p>
<p>cations technologies for development. Here, traditional aid agencies and develop-
</p>
<p>ment economists, often in response to the global digital divide, were concerned with 
</p>
<p>computers, kiosks, and network connections. At the same time, beginning in the 
</p>
<p>DefectiveByDesign.org is a broad-based, 
</p>
<p>antidigital-rights-management (DRM) campaign 
</p>
<p>that targets media, manufacturers, and distributors 
</p>
<p>who facilitate DRM. The campaign seeks to 
</p>
<p>discourage companies from bringing DRM-enabled 
</p>
<p>products to market, and to identify &ldquo;defective&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>products for consumers (Andrew Becherer, license:

</p>
<p>late 1990s and picking up in the first half of the 2000s, a movement around open-
</p>
<p>spectrum policy developed to question the whole approach of spectrum manage-
</p>
<p>ment as property. Wireless communications long had been regulated as a form of 
</p>
<p>public property, and as privatization took hold across many domains, the wireless 
</p>
<p>spectrum, too, was subject to a sustained critique by economists, so that by the mid-
</p>
<p>1990s its conversion to a private property regime was widely accepted. By that point, 
</p>
<p>however, the model of regulating wireless communications via an understanding of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;spectrum&rdquo; as a &ldquo;resource&rdquo; that needs to be managed by either the state or a com-
</p>
<p>pany had become obsolete. Instead, it had become feasible to permit the deployment 
</p>
<p>of wireless equipment that would enable users to own their own network connec-
</p>
<p>tions and to circumvent the bottleneck that traditional providers of last-mile Internet 
</p>
<p>connectivity held, and continue to hold, over Internet access. Originating mostly in 
</p>
<p>the United States and receiving a major global push with the adoption of Wi-Fi, more 
</p>
<p>municipalities, companies, and, increasingly, nations and aid agencies are working on 
</p>
<p>solutions to provide decentralized, ubiquitous Internet broadband access over wire-
</p>
<p>less networks using off-the-shelf equipment that uses a spectrum commons, which 
</p>
<p>no one owns, rather than following the expensive traditional path of licensing or its 
</p>
<p>very close twin, spectrum auctions.
</p>
<p> Since 2004, these diverse groups of actors and movements have begun to find 
</p>
<p>common cause, to see common themes, and to coalesce around a set of ideas, orga-
</p>
<p>nizations, and conferences to form what appears increasingly like a global social 
</p>
<p>movement. They interact with the growing normalization of cooperative, nonmar-
</p>
<p>ket social practices such as Wikipedia, with the increasing political and practical 
</p>
<p>consciousness that finds the Creative Commons initiative as its focal point, with 
</p>
<p>the fact that many more commercial entities are beginning to find ways to interact 
</p>
<p>productively and profitably with commons-based production, and with the newly 
</p>
<p>invigorated efforts, of developing nations, headed most prominently by Brazil, to 
</p>
<p>shift the agenda of international exclusive rights regimes away from ever-increasing 
</p>
<p>harmonized protection toward a more context-dependent and development-oriented 
</p>
<p>policy. A major catalyst in the mutual recognition of these diverse groups and actors 
</p>
<p>has been a series of conferences organized by the Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue 
</p>
<p>(TACD), where these various actors have come to meet, talk, and understand their 
</p>
<p>mutual agenda.2
</p>
<p>a2k, cooperation, and the information commons
</p>
<p>The ideas of the information commons and the use of networked cooperation have 
</p>
<p>been central to discussions within and about the emergence of the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment. In the remainder of this essay, I will explore why this might be. My claim is 
</p>
<p>benkler </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>227
</p>
<p>that these ideas subvert the traditional left-right divide, form the foundation for 
</p>
<p>some of the most interesting and unusual alliances, and provide the platform on 
</p>
<p>which political and economic interests meet around a common institutional and 
</p>
<p>organizational agenda.
</p>
<p> Recall that the networked information economy is built on an inversion of the 
</p>
<p>capital structure of the production of information, knowledge, and culture. For the 
</p>
<p>first time since the Industrial Revolution, at least, the most important inputs of core 
</p>
<p>economic activities are broadly distributed throughout the populations of the most 
</p>
<p>advanced economies and in significant segments of emerging economies. These 
</p>
<p>inputs include computation, communications, and storage capacity and human 
</p>
<p>intuition, creativity, and wisdom, which are personal, nonfungible, and uniquely 
</p>
<p>held by individuals. General Motors did not have to worry about competition from 
</p>
<p>amateurs getting together on a weekend, because the cost of an assembly line was 
</p>
<p>too high for their efforts to matter in the market. The same is not true of Micro-
</p>
<p>soft or Britannica. The widespread distribution of material and human resources 
</p>
<p>has meant that behaviors that have always been central to human sociality&mdash; 
</p>
<p>from real friendship to simple decency toward a stranger in a chance encounter&mdash;
</p>
<p>have moved from being socially important, but economically peripheral, to being 
</p>
<p>centrally effective in the economy as a modality of production.
</p>
<p> The already-existing fact that creativity and wisdom are distinctly individual 
</p>
<p>and human, together with the new and radical decentralization of physical capital, 
</p>
<p>has located the practical capacity to act effectively in the hands of individuals and 
</p>
<p>of loosely coupled cooperative groups in society. In acts ranging from individual 
</p>
<p>authorship of Web sites or blogs, to the small-group authorship of blogs, to mas-
</p>
<p>sive collaborative efforts such as Wikipedia or the Linux kernel, production based 
</p>
<p>on social motivations and signals, rather than on price signals or hierarchical com-
</p>
<p>mands, engaged in as both individual and peer production, has become a signifi-
</p>
<p>cant force in contemporary economies, societies, and cultures.
</p>
<p> The importance of the information commons, in particular, is anchored in the 
</p>
<p>nature of the existing universe of information, knowledge, and culture. In order 
</p>
<p>for a person to act effectively, both authority (under whatever system of prescrip-
</p>
<p>tion is applicable to the action) and the practical capacity to act have to be located 
</p>
<p>in the same place. Effective, large-scale patterns of human action will emerge only 
</p>
<p>through the actions of those actors who have both the practical capacity and the 
</p>
<p>authority to act. And it is here that the information commons enters. Both indi-
</p>
<p>viduals, who are now made more capable and potentially effective by the decen-
</p>
<p>tralization of material capital, and the newly feasible networks of cooperation that 
</p>
<p>are so central to this new, effective agency need a universe of existing informa-
</p>
<p>tion resources on which they have the authority to act. Exclusive rights, such as 
</p>
<p>the information commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>228
</p>
<p>copyrights or patents, are designed to remove the general authority to act on a 
</p>
<p>given information or cultural resource and instead locate the authority to per-
</p>
<p>mit learning and to use a given information &ldquo;bit&rdquo; in the hands of a given agent. 
</p>
<p>Permissions from that agent then form the basis for a particular kind of market 
</p>
<p>in permissions to use the information resource. But information is a public good, 
</p>
<p>in the economic sense. It is what economists call &ldquo;nonrivalrous&rdquo;&mdash;it can be con-
</p>
<p>sumed by one consumer without preventing simultaneous consumption by others. 
</p>
<p>Its marginal cost is zero. Any market that imposes a positive price on informa-
</p>
<p>tion therefore leads to underutilization of the information. And in a setting where 
</p>
<p>information is itself used as a productive input, not only as what is consumed, this 
</p>
<p>underutilization is not merely what is known as a &ldquo;deadweight loss&rdquo; in terms of 
</p>
<p>efficiency (those who would benefit from it at a price less than it would cost to 
</p>
<p>deliver to them do not get it), but actually inhibits innovation and new creativity.
</p>
<p> All this is well known, but the critical point here is that enclosure of informa-
</p>
<p>tion through exclusive rights regimes locates the authority to act with and upon 
</p>
<p>covered information and culture with the rights holder, rather than with whoever 
</p>
<p>has the practical capacity and insight to do something useful and interesting with 
</p>
<p>the information&mdash;even if that person is entirely willing to pay the actual social 
</p>
<p>cost of using the information, that is, their own time and attention in using it. 
</p>
<p>Exclusive rights regimes pose a particular and heightened threat to innovation and 
</p>
<p>creativity as noncommercial and nonproprietary production increases in general, 
</p>
<p>and as cooperative peer production increases in particular. Peer production thrives 
</p>
<p>on combining a wide range of contributions from diversely motivated individu-
</p>
<p>als scattered across the globe. If each participant were required to pay a license 
</p>
<p>fee, even one that was &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; by the lights of a commercial producer, even 
</p>
<p>one low enough to be reasonable to a highly committed amateur, still there would 
</p>
<p>be a large number of smaller-scale contributors whose contributions would be 
</p>
<p>critical to sustaining the cooperative project as a whole, but who would be priced 
</p>
<p>out of the market. The denial of a general authority to learn from and to be cre-
</p>
<p>ative with the existing universe of information, treated as a commons, therefore 
</p>
<p>inhibits creativity and innovation when carried out in peer-production endeav-
</p>
<p>ors and limits the human agency, the freedom, that such creativity both expresses  
</p>
<p>and enables.
</p>
<p> The productivity of the commons and counterproductive effects of property-
</p>
<p>mimicking regulations such as exclusive rights regimes, the increasing recognition 
</p>
<p>of the value and importance of nonmarket action generally and of cooperation, in 
</p>
<p>particular, by commercial actors such as IBM, which has developed a substantial

<p>&ldquo;Linux services&rdquo; business in collaboration with the free and open-source software

</p>
<p>individuals practicing these forms of social production has set the stage for a new 
</p>
<p>and interesting set of intellectual shifts.
</p>
<p> Because of its capital cost structure, the industrial economy promoted a binary 
</p>
<p>view of effective action focused on the two mechanisms available for raising suf-
</p>
<p>ficient capital to be effective: the market and the state. Because effective action 
</p>
<p>by a significant number of people required sustained commitments of time and 
</p>
<p>focus, often in conjunction with large-scale capital investment, groups that were 
</p>
<p>formed to undertake such action were seen as stable, and the binary opposition 
</p>
<p>of solidarity and individualism likewise was seen as stable. The state of organiza-
</p>
<p>tion theory was such that hierarchy in the early twentieth century was seen as 
</p>
<p>the epitome of effectiveness, whether it came in the form of Taylorism, Fordism, 
</p>
<p>Weberian bureaucracy, New Deal progressivism, or Communist Party discipline.
</p>
<p> Commons-based information production and peer production destabilize these 
</p>
<p>binaries. These new forms of production are based neither in the state nor in the 
</p>
<p>market. The most prominent among them are either structurally participatory and 
</p>
<p>self-governing, like Wikipedia, or at least drastically more dialogic and persuasion-
</p>
<p>based than earlier organizational models, even when they are not formally partici-
</p>
<p>patory, like the Linux kernel development community. In this context, much looser 
</p>
<p>associations can retain efficacy, rendering the individualism/solidarity choice less 
</p>
<p>stark and stable. These new forms of production enable and thrive on flat organi-
</p>
<p>zational structures with large amounts of authority for individuals to self-assign 
</p>
<p>tasks, sense the environment for opportunities for action, act, communicate with 
</p>
<p>others, and repeat. This is precisely what makes these approaches valuable&mdash;their 
</p>
<p>advantage as large-scale systems of learning through initiative, trial, error, com-
</p>
<p>munication, and adaptation. They support&mdash;indeed, they require&mdash;a more coop-
</p>
<p>erative view of human action, without also requiring a strong commitment to a 
</p>
<p>view that privileges solidarity over individualism.
</p>
<p> The destabilization of these industrially derived intellectual binaries makes 
</p>
<p>networked cooperation using commons-based strategies for resource manage-
</p>
<p>ment an attractive modality of production within the framework of the unusually 
</p>
<p>broad range of views that characterized the political-theoretical map of the nine-
</p>
<p>teenth and twentieth centuries. Almost the entire range of liberal traditions, from 
</p>
<p>laissez-faire to progressive liberalism or social democracy, can find information-
</p>
<p>commons-based cooperation attractive. The left, too, can find in these practices 
</p>
<p>one way out of the dead end that state socialism proved to be. Libertarianism, 
</p>
<p>of both right-wing, market-oriented, and left-wing, anarchistic varieties, like-
</p>
<p>wise finds attractive narratives to tell about cooperation in the networked com-
</p>
<p>mons. Adherents to this broad range of views can then, as a practical matter, ally 
</p>
<p>with market actors who eschew political views altogether and who are focused on 
</p>
<p>the information commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>230
</p>
<p>survival, innovation, and growth in an increasingly competitive global economy 
</p>
<p>where learning and adaptation are an imperative. Needless to say, some of this 
</p>
<p>congruence is temporary and ad hoc. Some, however, represents a real change in 
</p>
<p>conditions and intellectual alignments.
</p>
<p> Take, for example, a question such as the European consideration of software 
</p>
<p>patents, opposed widely because of the possibilities of strategic holdup&mdash;the con-
</p>
<p>cern that patent owners would temporarily hide their rights, but then exploit the 
</p>
<p>interdependencies of software and standards to demand excessively high pay-
</p>
<p>ments once their software became integrated into a standard&mdash;and for its effects 
</p>
<p>on free software development. At a basic strategic level, this opposition aligns 
</p>
<p>companies that, rather than selling software as &ldquo;goods,&rdquo; sell software services and 
</p>
<p>computerized enterprise solutions (these businesses account for over three-quar-
</p>
<p>ters of the software business; IBM is the leading example) with free and open-
</p>
<p>source software developers and activists concerned with constraining the scope of 
</p>
<p>expansion of patents or exclusive rights regimes in general. They can all converge 
</p>
<p>around the basic critique of intellectual property or exclusive rights regimes in 
</p>
<p>terms of efficiency and innovation policy. In this case, because the software mar-
</p>
<p>ket is so heavily pervaded by nonexclusion-based business models and because 
</p>
<p>patents have been applied so poorly in the United States, the minimal, functional 
</p>
<p>case forms a foundation for a broad, tactical alliance, and when enacted at a higher 
</p>
<p>theoretical framing as being about &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; versus &ldquo;commons-based 
</p>
<p>strategies,&rdquo; as it often is, this tactical alliance can be part of a broader strategic 
</p>
<p>alliance between firms in the information technologies sector and the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment. This tactical and strategic alliance is the least interesting theoretically, but is 
</p>
<p>of enormous importance politically.
</p>
<p> Moving one level deeper, free and open-source software (the political and apoliti-
</p>
<p>cal names for the phenomenon, respectively) and commons-based peer production 
</p>
<p>can be framed as attractive to libertarians, liberals, the postsocialist left, and anar-
</p>
<p>chists, though in each case for different reasons and viewed through different lenses.
</p>
<p> Laissez -faire liberals and libertarians can see in open-source software develop-
</p>
<p>ment an instance of people acting according to their own preferences, unforced, 
</p>
<p>to produce together. They need some more or less fancy story about motivation 
</p>
<p>and why people would do this. They need some clear specification of how people 
</p>
<p>ultimately make money. These tasks have been taken on by economists studying 
</p>
<p>this problem. But the basic framing is congenial to market-centric liberalism and 
</p>
<p>property-based libertarianism: People are using their propertylike rights&mdash;either 
</p>
<p>copyrights or simply their right to be free in their bodies to work on whatever 
</p>
<p>project they choose&mdash;to adopt business models and strategies, often implemented 
</p>
<p>through licenses, with firms that engage in this activity as a strategic option, 
</p>
<p>benkler </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>231
</p>
<p>producing in ways that they deem useful. When the state comes and tries to 
</p>
<p>extend patent rights that cover the object of action, particularly given the back-
</p>
<p>ground understanding of information as a public good in the strict economic sense, 
</p>
<p>patent law comes to be framed for laissez-faire liberals and libertarians as a regula-
</p>
<p>tory intervention.
</p>
<p> A central claim of the information-commons movement has been precisely to 
</p>
<p>emphasize the regulatory nature of exclusive rights regimes, resisting and under-
</p>
<p>mining the move to unthinking application of the &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; label. In 
</p>
<p>other words, the state has a model of how software development goes (or encyclo-
</p>
<p>pedia writing, or video entertainment, in the case of copyright and paracopyright), 
</p>
<p>and it is intervening in what seems to be a perfectly functional innovation system, 
</p>
<p>imposing new rules that are upsetting a whole set of freely chosen business prac-
</p>
<p>tices already in place. Needless to say, this is not the only way to view what is 
</p>
<p>happening, but it is a sufficiently plausible characterization that many libertarians 
</p>
<p>and laissez-faire liberals in fact understand what is happening in these terms. The 
</p>
<p>rhetorical foundation of the &ldquo;open-source software&rdquo; movement was precisely to 
</p>
<p>frame the practice in these terms of free choice, innovation, and business benefits.
</p>
<p> The left sees in the information commons very different things. Here they see 
</p>
<p>proof that when people own the means of production, they can cooperate outside 
</p>
<p>of the market (both in the sense that the outputs need not be sold in the mar-
</p>
<p>ket and in the sense that labor is not commodified), without reliance on property 
</p>
<p>as the organizing principle to achieve productive goals. It is proof that there is 
</p>
<p>no one right path of capitalism. Here, even more importantly, is a vector through 
</p>
<p>which the existing distribution of power can be resisted: power not only in the 
</p>
<p>political sense, but in the economic sense and the cultural sense, as well. This is 
</p>
<p>where the commitment to free software offers an important rhetorical marker of 
</p>
<p>a basic underlying observation. The central distinctive commitment of the left has 
</p>
<p>been resistance to the dehumanizing application of power by economic produc-
</p>
<p>tion systems and with it by culture and society, religion and the family being the 
</p>
<p>two main loci of illegitimate power and coercion. The necessity of sustaining eco-
</p>
<p>nomic production and its former dependence on large-scale capital aggregation led 
</p>
<p>the left to give the state an enormously powerful and ultimately corrosive role 
</p>
<p>in achieving freedom from this power. But in peer production, we are seeing an 
</p>
<p>avenue of resistance to the hierarchical exercise of economic power that does not 
</p>
<p>flow through the state. More Kropotkin than Lenin, this source of power in the 
</p>
<p>hands of people networked together is, I think, the single most attractive feature 
</p>
<p>of the information commons to the left. There are, of course, some on the left who 
</p>
<p>will continue to see the distribution of material goods as central and who will be 
</p>
<p>skeptical of the importance of information as the locus of egalitarian production. 
</p>
<p>the information commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>232
</p>
<p>The debate here, from the perspective of the A2K movement, will be over the rela-
</p>
<p>tive centrality of the distribution of dynamic, productive capabilities for learning, 
</p>
<p>growth, and effective production in the domains of information and knowledge as 
</p>
<p>engines of justice over time in the distribution of social and economic power and 
</p>
<p>material goods.
</p>
<p> For liberals, free software and open-source software, the commons, and peer 
</p>
<p>production offer ways of deepening individual freedom, improving democratic 
</p>
<p>participation and the accountability of both government and corporate power, 
</p>
<p>providing new avenues for human community and sociality without imposing the 
</p>
<p>constraints of conservative social forms, and offering a basis for a more participa-
</p>
<p>tory public culture&mdash;all this without the need to resort to rejection of the mar-
</p>
<p>ket qua market and without subjecting the individual to collective or solidaristic 
</p>
<p>claims, at least not to claims that are not freely chosen, negotiated, taken up, and 
</p>
<p>capable of being renounced when the individual desires to do so.
</p>
<p> Needless to say, if cooperation in the information commons were in fact all 
</p>
<p>these things to all people in all these ideological camps, we would have indeed 
</p>
<p>come to a certain kind of end of history. There are, of course, market liberals and 
</p>
<p>libertarians who see peer production and the commons as the left does and either 
</p>
<p>disbelieve it or resist it on principle, or both at different times. There are those on 
</p>
<p>the left who emphasize the disparities of power between those few million who are 
</p>
<p>newly empowered, perhaps, and the billions for whom things have not changed at 
</p>
<p>all. And there is a strong, central strand in liberalism that sees the role of an effec-
</p>
<p>tive, constitutionally limited, deliberatively legitimate state to be central both to 
</p>
<p>liberal thought and to individual freedom.
</p>
<p> All these views&mdash;both those that embrace cooperation in the commons and 
</p>
<p>those that express skepticism about it&mdash;are correct. All are incomplete. That is why 
</p>
<p>this moment calls for a theoretical engagement with the possibility of free, nonhi-
</p>
<p>erarchical, flow-based, and networked, rather than stable-structured and institu-
</p>
<p>tionalized social forms. The A2K movement is at the heart of dealing with the main 
</p>
<p>limitation of commons-based and peer production from both the left and liberal 
</p>
<p>perspectives&mdash;its application to justice, both local and global. The freedom to act, 
</p>
<p>alone and in loose cooperation with others, in effective forms free of hierarchical 
</p>
<p>power depends on the distribution of basic capabilities and authority to engage 
</p>
<p>in open and collaborative modalities of production. The A2K movement can and 
</p>
<p>must play a political and social role in assuring the global distribution of access to 
</p>
<p>the basic conditions&mdash;both material and institutional&mdash;that enable the decentral-
</p>
<p>ization of practically effective human agency and sociality. Whether and to what 
</p>
<p>degree the contemporary partial intellectual alliance can be sustained between the 
</p>
<p>left and left liberals, on the one hand, and market liberals and some libertarians, 
</p>
<p>benkler </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>233
</p>
<p>on the other, depends upon how power in the market and power in the state can 
</p>
<p>be reinterpreted, reconceived, and restructured as a matter of practical programs.
</p>
<p> Freedom, justice, and efficacy are the core interfaces for the realigned map of 
</p>
<p>political theory that we can draw and that we need to draw if we are to change the 
</p>
<p>power alliances that have for so long disabled a more egalitarian global distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of capabilities and opportunities. The core interface of the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>with libertarianism is in the area of individual freedom. The centrality of practical 
</p>
<p>freedom to explore, experiment, and adapt, and hence to learn and innovate, con-
</p>
<p>verts freedom into efficacy and becomes the core interface with market liberalism. 
</p>
<p>Freedom and efficacy, then, will be the interface with both liberalisms, market and 
</p>
<p>social. Justice and freedom, in the sense of the dissipation of structured, stable 
</p>
<p>hierarchical power, will be the interface between liberalism and the left. And all 
</p>
<p>three&mdash;freedom, justice, and efficacy&mdash;will be the interfaces with the social, prag-
</p>
<p>matic, liberalism that has occupied the center in the United States, Europe, and 
</p>
<p>gradually, since the end of World War II, much of the rest of the world.
</p>
<p> At a programmatic level, the core foci of the A2K movement lend themselves 
</p>
<p>well to characterization through these conceptual interfaces. The policy goals of 
</p>
<p>the movement can be, and indeed are, couched in terms of justice, freedom, and 
</p>
<p>efficacy. The mainstream understanding of the economics of information and inno-
</p>
<p>vation lends itself to complementary, rather than competing rhetorics of access. 
</p>
<p>The public-goods nature of information in the technical economic sense supports 
</p>
<p>limiting the scope and reach of patents and copyrights. The character of informa-
</p>
<p>tion as both the input and the output of its own productive process provides the 
</p>
<p>foundation for an argument about diverse rules for diverse economies, industries, 
</p>
<p>and activities, and all these can be made in terms of efficacy, or in this case, growth 
</p>
<p>and innovation, to push back on the rhetoric of harmonization that has been so 
</p>
<p>central to the strategy of ratcheting up exclusive rights around the world. At the 
</p>
<p>same time, the centrality of individual freedom and social cooperation to the effi-
</p>
<p>cacy sought&mdash;learning and innovation&mdash;aligns the programmatic concerns for a 
</p>
<p>more expansive commons and more limited exclusive rights with the interfaces to 
</p>
<p>liberals, social democrats, and the left. One reason, perhaps, that the movement 
</p>
<p>was able to coalesce as it did around patents and copyrights was that this program-
</p>
<p>matic focus was so easily transferred across theoretical divides.
</p>
<p> But access to the information commons in the abstract is insufficient. As I dis-
</p>
<p>cussed above, freedom, justice, and innovation all require effective agency, not 
</p>
<p>merely formal permission to act. And effective agency in the domains of infor-
</p>
<p>mation and knowledge production requires access to material means, as well as 
</p>
<p>to a knowledge commons&mdash;not the same access as was required in the industrial 
</p>
<p>age, but access to a minimal set of material capabilities and educational faculties 
</p>
<p>the information commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>234
</p>
<p>nonetheless. Here, the alliances must come under some pressure, particularly in 
</p>
<p>the interface with libertarians. Still, the centrality of innovation and information 
</p>
<p>production, as well as the widespread recognition among market liberals that inte-
</p>
<p>gration into the global economy requires investments in infrastructure, suggest 
</p>
<p>that at least some of the congruence can be kept as we move to infrastructure.
</p>
<p> On spectrum policy, in particular, the drive to a spectrum commons is wholly 
</p>
<p>couched in the United States in terms of efficiency and growth, and, if success-
</p>
<p>ful, will create a large market pull for the creation of devices capable of creating 
</p>
<p>an infrastructure merely by their local deployment by users. This is one path that 
</p>
<p>is both radical in its implications&mdash;enabling the development of a free and open 
</p>
<p>infrastructure owned by its users&mdash;and capable of being couched along any of the 
</p>
<p>conceptual interfaces. The drive to deployment of broadband capabilities, neu-
</p>
<p>tral or open-access telecommunications networks, and open personal computers 
</p>
<p>and mobile platforms all have that similar feature: They are debated in the United 
</p>
<p>States and Europe in terms of innovation and growth&mdash;that is, of efficacy&mdash;but 
</p>
<p>have obvious and direct effects for, and framings in, freedom and justice.
</p>
<p> In the debates over patents in medicines, framing a congruent agenda and 
</p>
<p>understanding is a bit harder. The language of justice is most easily available and 
</p>
<p>has been dominant. But a particular historical contingency has made some alli-
</p>
<p>ances at least feasible, if not easy, on practical and theoretical bases. The political 
</p>
<p>dynamic that has driven the patent system to excess, particularly in the United 
</p>
<p>States, has put pressure on companies that are not in the pharmaceutical indus-
</p>
<p>try from &ldquo;patent trolls&rdquo;&mdash;persons or companies who exact payments for the use 
</p>
<p>of patents they hold without intending to use them productively themselves&mdash;
</p>
<p>and high transaction costs associated with operating in too restrictive a knowl-
</p>
<p>edge environment, polluted by too many unnecessary patents. These industries, 
</p>
<p>in particular the high-technology and consumer electronics industries, have begun 
</p>
<p>to push back on the pharmaceutical industries on reform of the basic patent law. 
</p>
<p>The points of contention are very different from those of the access-to-medicines 
</p>
<p>movement, but the overall direction is congruent, and the timing and common 
</p>
<p>understanding of the need for a very powerful push provide a moment of oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity for creating alliances around the issue of patent reform that could sweep in 
</p>
<p>the concerns of very different parts of the movement. As everywhere, however, 
</p>
<p>the risk of this kind of opportunistic alliance formation is that the partnership 
</p>
<p>dissolves as some, especially those who are powerful and interest driven, obtain 
</p>
<p>what they need and leave. This is a risk that needs to be addressed by continuous 
</p>
<p>engagement and framing of the ideas around the long-term, stable congruence of 
</p>
<p>interests well beyond the opportunity of the moment. Indeed, it is in order to sta-
</p>
<p>bilize the alliances that make the A2K movement and its agenda feasible that the 
</p>
<p>exercise of self-definition and theorization is important.

</p>
<p> Looking at the long-term trends that I described in the beginning of this essay, 
</p>
<p>the task of conceptual integration is neither incoherent nor impossible. The rise of 
</p>
<p>the networked information economy has created the material conditions for the 
</p>
<p>confluence of freedom, justice, and efficacy understood as effective learning and 
</p>
<p>innovation. The decline of statism and the more or less global consensus on at least 
</p>
<p>the inevitability of some form of market-based economy has eliminated what was 
</p>
<p>a core unbridgeable gap between liberalism in its right and left forms and the left. 
</p>
<p>We have seen this in the &ldquo;Third Way&rdquo; literature for over two decades. The emer-
</p>
<p>gence of networked cultural and information networks has provided the mecha-
</p>
<p>nism for dialogue about what is to be done and for collective action to organize to 
</p>
<p>do it. And the development of the idea of freedom to extend to human rights and 
</p>
<p>development has created a framework for bridging justice-seeking and freedom-
</p>
<p>seeking discourses. But to say that the task is neither incoherent nor impossible 
</p>
<p>is not to say that it is easy. It is, nonetheless, necessary if the alliance represented 
</p>
<p>by the A2K movement or by the information commons, free culture, and similar 
</p>
<p>aligned movements is to become the basis of a new political alignment, rather than 
</p>
<p>a temporary marriage of convenience.

</p>
<p>The A2K movement generally aims at an information society where knowledge 
</p>
<p>is openly accessible to the benefit of all. Despite a broad convergence on the ulti-
</p>
<p>mate objectives to be achieved, the positions of civil- society groups, governments, 
</p>
<p>scholars, and other individuals that participate in such a movement are probably 
</p>
<p>not unanimous.
</p>
<p> Divergences are most likely to arise with regard to the role, if any, of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights. On the assumption that the more widely that a piece of 
</p>
<p>knowledge is distributed, the better it is for the society, both for the utilization of 
</p>
<p>the knowledge and for its further refinement and development,1 some A2K sup-
</p>
<p>porters advocate for alternatives to the system of intellectual property rights. Oth-
</p>
<p>ers, however, find some space for the use of such rights. For instance, although 
</p>
<p>the Adelphi Charter on Creativity, Innovation, and Intellectual Property postulates 
</p>
<p>that humans&rsquo; creative imagination &ldquo;requires access to the ideas, learning and cul-
</p>
<p>ture of others, past and present&rdquo; and that &ldquo;human rights call on us to ensure that 
</p>
<p>everyone can create, access, use and share information and knowledge, enabling 
</p>
<p>individuals, communities and societies to achieve their full potential,&rdquo; the charter 
</p>
<p>also indicates that &ldquo;creativity and investment should be recognised and rewarded. 
</p>
<p>The purpose of intellectual property law (such as copyright and patents) should 
</p>
<p>be, now as it was in the past, to ensure both the sharing of knowledge and the 
</p>
<p>rewarding of innovation.&rdquo;2 The charter therefore does admit the idea that intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights may be granted under certain circumstances.
</p>
<p> Similarly, the free- and open-source software movement promotes &ldquo;free&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>access to software as a means of furthering its diffusion and improvement, but 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;free&rdquo; in this context does not necessarily mean that a particular piece of software 
</p>
<p>is in the public domain, since the system relies on copyright licenses to require that 
</p>
<p>modified versions also be freely available. Likewise, the Creative Commons scheme

<p>correa 238
</p>
<p>utilizes licenses that forbid many of the same acts that copyright law does.3
</p>
<p> Another area in which the supporters of the A2K movement may disagree 
</p>
<p>relates to the protection of traditional knowledge. As examined in an abundant 
</p>
<p>literature,4 there are a number of initiatives either to extend existing intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights to traditional knowledge or to create new, &ldquo;sui generis&rdquo; rights 
</p>
<p>conferring exclusive rights over such knowledge. In fact, some countries, such as 
</p>
<p>Panama, have already passed legislation that recognizes some form of exclusive 
</p>
<p>rights to registered or unregistered traditional knowledge.5 Such legislation reveals 
</p>
<p>a considerable diversity in the approaches followed, the objectives pursued, the 
</p>
<p>scope of protected knowledge, and the rights conferred, among other differences.6
</p>
<p> There is no agreed-upon definition of traditional knowledge.7 The World Intel-
</p>
<p>lectual Property Organization (WIPO) uses the term to refer to tradition-based 
</p>
<p>literary, artistic, or scientific works, performances, inventions, scientific discov-
</p>
<p>eries, designs, marks, names and symbols, undisclosed information, and all other 
</p>
<p>tradition-based innovations and creations resulting from intellectual activity in 
</p>
<p>the industrial, scientific, literary, or artistic fields.8 Notably, traditional knowledge 
</p>
<p>includes environmental or ecological knowledge and plant-based therapies (&ldquo;tradi-
</p>
<p>tional medicine&rdquo;). An operational concept of traditional knowledge may be based 
</p>
<p>on the source of the knowledge (traditional and indigenous communities)9 and on 
</p>
<p>its cultural specificity, rather than on the specific content of its components.
</p>
<p> The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted 
</p>
<p>on September 7, 2007, has confirmed indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights over their 
</p>
<p>knowledge:
</p>
<p>Article 11
</p>
<p>1.  Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions 
</p>
<p>and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, 
</p>
<p>present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and his-
</p>
<p>torical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing 
</p>
<p>arts and literature.
</p>
<p>2. States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include res-
</p>
<p>titution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their 
</p>
<p>cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior 
</p>
<p>and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.10
</p>
<p>While different reasons justify the search for the protection of traditional knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, equity considerations have largely dominated the debates on the matter, 
</p>
<p>especially in the light of the numerous reported cases of misappropriation (or 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;biopiracy&rdquo;) without any recognition or compensation to holders of traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge.11</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>indigenous and traditional knowledge 239
</p>
<p> Legal regimes aimed at preventing the misappropriation of traditional knowl-
</p>
<p>edge seem fully compatible with the general philosophy of the A2K movement to 
</p>
<p>the extent that their intended objective is to avoid the creation of exclusive rights 
</p>
<p>over knowledge. More controversial may be those regimes granting some forms of 
</p>
<p>exclusive rights over such knowledge. If granted, such rights may be exercised so 
</p>
<p>as to impede the use of the protected knowledge by third parties without the rights 
</p>
<p>holders&rsquo; authorization. While this may be regarded as antithetical to the A2K 
</p>
<p>open-access goal, the A2K movement may be understood not just as a libertar-
</p>
<p>ian agenda, but as a quest for the realization, in the area of knowledge generation 
</p>
<p>and sharing, of the fundamental principles of justice and economic development. 
</p>
<p>Granting rights to holders of traditional knowledge may, in some circumstances, be 
</p>
<p>required purely for equity reasons or to improve their living conditions.
</p>
<p> This paper examines the extent to which intellectual property rights protection 
</p>
<p>of traditional knowledge is compatible with the paradigm envisioned by the A2K 
</p>
<p>movement. It is not so clear exactly what the underpinnings of A2K are, and there 
</p>
<p>is some anxiety about where traditional knowledge fits. Hence, it is important to 
</p>
<p>discuss how the claims for traditional knowledge protection by indigenous/tra-
</p>
<p>ditional communities may be reconciled with the main philosophical approach of 
</p>
<p>the A2K movement. The paper considers, first, whether, in the context on national 
</p>
<p>laws, traditional knowledge may be deemed a part of the public domain. Second, 
</p>
<p>it analyzes the principles emerging from international treaties and other instru-
</p>
<p>ments, particularly as they may limit the options available with regard to the legal 
</p>
<p>treatment of traditional knowledge. Finally, the paper elaborates on the implica-
</p>
<p>tions of the analysis for the conceptions underpinning the A2K vision.
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge as part of the public domain
</p>
<p>A2K advocates expanding the public domain. Although this concept seems simple 
</p>
<p>at first sight, defining what information is actually part of the public domain is a 
</p>
<p>complex task. In particular, the situation of traditional knowledge is unclear. Can 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge that is not protected under intellectual property rights be 
</p>
<p>considered to belong to the public domain?
</p>
<p> There are at least three concepts of &ldquo;the public domain&rdquo; employed in the con-
</p>
<p>text of intellectual property law that lead to different scenarios regarding the way 
</p>
<p>the protection of traditional knowledge can be approached.12 First, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with a commonly used concept, information in the public domain is information 
</p>
<p>whose intellectual protection rights have expired, information for which protec-
</p>
<p>tion would be appropriate, but has been lost due to a failure to comply with cer-
</p>
<p>tain formal requirements of intellectual property law, and information outside the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>240
</p>
<p>scope of legislation on intellectual property because it is not eligible for protection 
</p>
<p>according to the law.
</p>
<p> In this conception, the public domain thus encompasses the entire pool of 
</p>
<p>works and knowledge, including factual and scientific information, that is not sub-
</p>
<p>jected to intellectual property rights,13 as well as any information that was not or 
</p>
<p>could have not been subjected in the past to intellectual property rights due to a 
</p>
<p>lack of eligibility for protection.
</p>
<p> Under this definition, with a few exceptions, traditional knowledge would be 
</p>
<p>considered part of the public domain. Hence, no authorization would be needed to 
</p>
<p>use it, nor should any compensation be paid for doing so. Indigenous and traditional 
</p>
<p>communities would have no right to prevent the use of the knowledge they hold.
</p>
<p> It is worth noting that, as an exception, in some countries (including Algeria, 
</p>
<p>Argentina, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Fasso, Cameroon, Congo, Ivory Coast, Hungary, 
</p>
<p>Italy, Mexico, Rwanda, Senegal, and Uruguay) the reproduction of works of art 
</p>
<p>that have fallen into the public domain are subject to a payment to the state. This 
</p>
<p>is called a &ldquo;paying public domain&rdquo; (domain public payant).14
</p>
<p> In the second concept of the public domain, the notion is regarded more restric-
</p>
<p>tively. Strictly construed, the concept of the public domain does not refer to works 
</p>
<p>that are inherently unprotectable, but only to subject matter that could have had 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protection that for some reason was not obtained and that 
</p>
<p>was previously protected and has later fallen into the public domain. The latter 
</p>
<p>is the sense of the term that is invoked in the Agreement on the Trade-Related 
</p>
<p>Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).15 This narrower concept of the 
</p>
<p>public domain excludes all material that was never eligible for protection. This 
</p>
<p>would leave out, for example, purely fact-based information, unoriginal works, 
</p>
<p>and nonpatentable techniques. Likewise, traditional knowledge that is not sus-
</p>
<p>ceptible to protection under the conventional forms of intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>would not be part of the public domain defined in this way. Holders of traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge therefore might exercise the rights that national legislation would rec-
</p>
<p>ognize, if any, over the knowledge they possess and require authorization or pay-
</p>
<p>ment for its use.
</p>
<p> In a third conception, information in the public domain may be broadly under-
</p>
<p>stood as information that can be freely used without effectuating payment to third 
</p>
<p>parties or obtaining authorization from them.16 The public domain in this sense 
</p>
<p>is &ldquo;a collection of things available for all people to access and consume freely.&rdquo;17 
</p>
<p>Although works protected by copyright may be freely accessible under &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>or other exceptions, this may not be deemed to put such works into the public 
</p>
<p>domain, because only limited uses are allowed under the conditions determined by 
</p>
<p>the applicable law.18 The extent to which traditional knowledge may be considered 
</p>
<p>correa </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>241
</p>
<p>freely accessible and usable would determine whether it may be considered to be 
</p>
<p>part of the public domain or not under this definition.
</p>
<p> Western intellectual property systems have regarded traditional knowledge as 
</p>
<p>information freely available for use by anybody. As a result, traditional knowl-
</p>
<p>edge has often been published or exploited without any recognition, moral or 
</p>
<p>economic, to those who originated or preserved the relevant knowledge. Further, 
</p>
<p>diverse components of traditional knowledge have been appropriated under intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights regimes by researchers and commercial enterprises without 
</p>
<p>the prior consent of and any compensation to the knowledge creators or holders. 
</p>
<p>Well-known examples include U.S. patent 5,304,718 on a quinoa variety granted 
</p>
<p>to researchers of the Colorado State University and U.S. patent 5,401,504 relating 
</p>
<p>to the wound-healing properties of turmeric, as well as a diversity of patents on 
</p>
<p>products based on plant materials and local or indigenous communities&rsquo; knowledge 
</p>
<p>such as the neem tree, kava, barbasco, maca, and endod.19
</p>
<p> Traditional knowledge has been considered de facto as freely usable and 
</p>
<p>appropriable. A survey of scientific journals indicated that articles in twenty-five 
</p>
<p>journals in English, French, and Chinese made explicit references to traditional 
</p>
<p>medicinal uses of the substances described.20 University-based authors from both 
</p>
<p>developed and developing countries accounted for an overwhelming 81 percent of 
</p>
<p>such publications. Among developing countries, the leading producers of ethno-
</p>
<p>medical publications were India (twenty publications), Brazil (nineteen), Mexico 
</p>
<p>(ten), Argentina (ten), South Africa (nine), Turkey (nine), and Nigeria (six).
</p>
<p> These differing interpretations of the scope of the public domain in relation to 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge have been one of the hurdles confronting the still-ongoing 
</p>
<p>debates about protection of and compensation for traditional knowledge.21 What 
</p>
<p>is in the public domain is determined, in the last instance, by national laws, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the principle of territoriality applicable in the area of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property law.22 In fact, &ldquo;information is not in the public domain because of its 
</p>
<p>nature as a public good or even its governmental origin but as a result of a network 
</p>
<p>of formal and informal social agreements, explicit or implicit but entrenched in the 
</p>
<p>common law and in the culture of a society.&rdquo;23 Therefore, the limits of the public-
</p>
<p>domain spectrum can be greater or smaller, depending on the types and degree of 
</p>
<p>appropriation determined by the law of a particular state. Such limits depend, in 
</p>
<p>the last instance, on debates and decisions at the national and international levels.
</p>
<p> Unlike the public domain under administrative law, which is subject to limits 
</p>
<p>established by the state, such as the authorization to use assets privately under 
</p>
<p>governmental control as part of public-services concessions, the public domain 
</p>
<p>under intellectual property law is, in principle, absolute and mandatory,24 mean-
</p>
<p>ing that it cannot be the object of private appropriation unless a new law expands 
</p>
<p>indigenous and traditional knowledge</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>242
</p>
<p>the limits of what may be appropriated, as the European Directive 96/9/CE did, 
</p>
<p>for example, for the protection of nonoriginal databases. It is also possible for 
</p>
<p>information in the public domain to have its protection restored, as stipulated, for 
</p>
<p>example, by Article 70.2 of the TRIPS Agreement. In applying this article in 1994, 
</p>
<p>the U.S. Uruguay Round Agreement Act restored authors&rsquo; rights for foreign works, 
</p>
<p>such as movies and music, that had not been protected earlier in the United States.
</p>
<p> The legal status of traditional knowledge as a part of the public domain thus 
</p>
<p>depends, in principle, upon determinations made under national laws. However, 
</p>
<p>national legal solutions vary considerably today. Some countries have adopted, 
</p>
<p>as noted above, sui generis legislation that clearly removes traditional knowledge 
</p>
<p>from the public domain by conferring exclusive or remuneration rights of various 
</p>
<p>kinds.25 One example is Panama&rsquo;s Law No. 20 of June 26, 2002, which established 
</p>
<p>a special regime of intellectual property on the collective rights of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples for the protection and defense of their cultural identity and traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge. The subject matter protected under this law encompasses customs, 
</p>
<p>traditions, beliefs, spirituality, cosmovision (the worldviews of the Mesoamerican 
</p>
<p>peoples), folkloric expressions, artistic manifestations, traditional knowledge, and 
</p>
<p>any other type of traditional expression of indigenous communities that are part 
</p>
<p>of their cultural assets&mdash;their cultural heritage. In order to be protectable, the sub-
</p>
<p>ject matter must be collective in nature, capable of commercial use, based upon 
</p>
<p>tradition (although it need not be &ldquo;old&rdquo;) and fit within the classification system 
</p>
<p>established by the law. &ldquo;Collective intellectual property rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge&rdquo; under this law are embodied in creations such as inventions, models, 
</p>
<p>designs, and drawings, in innovations contained in images, figures, graphic sym-
</p>
<p>bols, petroglyphs and other material, and in cultural elements of history, music, 
</p>
<p>the arts, and traditional artistic expressions. The collective rights granted under 
</p>
<p>this regime permit rights holders to prevent the use, commercialization, industrial 
</p>
<p>reproduction, or acquisition of exclusive intellectual property rights over the sub-
</p>
<p>ject matter and allow for the certification of cultural expressions as works of indig-
</p>
<p>enous traditional art or handicraft and as handmade by natives.
</p>
<p> In the case of Peru, in addition to recognizing the indigenous people&rsquo;s owner-
</p>
<p>ship of intellectual property and associated rights, the Law Establishing a Regime 
</p>
<p>of Protection of the Collective Knowledge of Indigenous Peoples Related to Bio-
</p>
<p>logical Resources of 2002 provides that if collective knowledge has passed into the 
</p>
<p>public domain in the last twenty years, a percentage of the value, before taxes, 
</p>
<p>of the gross sales resulting from the marketing of products developed from this 
</p>
<p>knowledge is to be set aside for the Fund for the Development of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples. The fund will also receive a minimum 10 percent of the gross sales, 
</p>
<p>before taxes, resulting from the marketing of products developed from collective 
</p>
<p>correa </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>knowledge.26 This regime has attracted little interest from indigenous peoples so 
</p>
<p>far, despite the efforts of the government to promote its use.
</p>
<p> In other countries, unpublished traditional knowledge is deemed to belong in 
</p>
<p>the public domain and may be appropriated without the consent or compensation 
</p>
<p>of its holders. This is notably the case in the United States, where disclosure of the 
</p>
<p>claimed invention in a nonwritten form is not an obstacle to patenting. According 
</p>
<p>to Article 102 of the Patent Law (35 United States Code):
</p>
<p>A person shall be entitled to a patent unless&mdash;
</p>
<p>(a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or 
</p>
<p>described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the inven-
</p>
<p>tion thereof by the applicant for patent, or
</p>
<p>(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a for-
</p>
<p>eign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior 
</p>
<p>to the date of the application for patent in the United States.27
</p>
<p>This concept of relative novelty implies that traditional knowledge, even if publicly 
</p>
<p>used, but not documented in a foreign country, is patentable in the United States. 
</p>
<p>As a result, several patents relating to or consisting of genetic materials or tradi-
</p>
<p>tional knowledge acquired in developing countries have been granted to researchers 
</p>
<p>or firms by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A classic example is the patent&mdash;
</p>
<p>regarded as outrageous by some indigenous communities in Amazonia&mdash;covering a 
</p>
<p>variety of the ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi). In 1986, after research in Ecua-
</p>
<p>dorian Amazonia, a U.S. scientist was granted U.S. plant patent 5,751. Ayahuasca is 
</p>
<p>the vernacular name for the plant among the Amazon Quichua people, in whose 
</p>
<p>language ayahuasca means &ldquo;vine of the spirits.&rdquo; It is used for many medicinal and 
</p>
<p>ritual purposes. Although the validity of the patent was legally challenged, it was 
</p>
<p>confirmed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2001.28
</p>
<p> In sum, there is no unique response to the legal status of traditional knowledge 
</p>
<p>as part of the public domain. Its legal treatment is determined by national law&mdash;
</p>
<p>subject to the territoriality principle&mdash;and by applicable international law.
</p>
<p>the legal status of traditional knowledge under international law
</p>
<p>The legal status of traditional knowledge under international law is also consider-
</p>
<p>ably uncertain. Article 8(j) of the Convention on Biological Diversity requires the 
</p>
<p>contracting parties to &ldquo;respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and 
</p>
<p>practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles rel-
</p>
<p>evant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote 
</p>
<p>their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such 
</p>
<p>indigenous and traditional knowledge</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>244
</p>
<p>knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the 
</p>
<p>benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity qualifies this recognition by indicating that 
</p>
<p>a state must do this only &ldquo;as far as possible and as appropriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;subject to its 
</p>
<p>national legislation.&rdquo;29 Although the adoption of this provision gave an unprece-
</p>
<p>dented impulse to international discussions on the protection of traditional knowl-
</p>
<p>edge because it signaled the interest of the international community in protecting 
</p>
<p>that knowledge, it does not bind states to protect traditional knowledge in their 
</p>
<p>own territories. In accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity, access 
</p>
<p>to genetic resources is subject to the consent of the state (Article 15.5). Some states 
</p>
<p>have passed access regulations (for example, the Philippines and the Andean Com-
</p>
<p>munity)30 that require prior informed consent of the relevant traditional communi-
</p>
<p>ties or indigenous peoples, but this is beyond what the the Convention on Biologi-the Convention on Biologi-
</p>
<p>cal Diversity requires.
</p>
<p> Likewise, the Food and Agriculture Organization International Treaty on Plant 
</p>
<p>Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture recognized, but deferred to national 
</p>
<p>governments the implementation of &ldquo;Farmers&rsquo; Rights.&rdquo; In Article 9.2 of the treaty:
</p>
<p>The Contracting Parties agree that the responsibility for realizing Farmers&rsquo; Rights, 
</p>
<p>as they relate to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, rests with national 
</p>
<p>governments. In accordance with their needs and priorities, each Contracting Party 
</p>
<p>should, as appropriate, and subject to its national legislation, take measures to pro-
</p>
<p>tect and promote Farmers&rsquo; Rights, including:
</p>
<p>(a) protection of traditional knowledge relevant to plant genetic resources for food 
</p>
<p>and agriculture.
</p>
<p>Like the provision in the Convention on Biological Diversity, this article does 
</p>
<p>not set a uniform standard, because protection of traditional knowledge is to 
</p>
<p>be provided by a contracting party &ldquo;as appropriate, and subject to its national 
</p>
<p>legislation.&rdquo;31
</p>
<p> The international conventions on human rights also contain elements relevant 
</p>
<p>to the analysis of the legal status of traditional knowledge. The Universal Declara-
</p>
<p>tion of Human Rights established in Article 27(2) that &ldquo;everyone has the right to 
</p>
<p>the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, 
</p>
<p>literary or artistic production of which he is the author.&rdquo;32 Although this proclama-
</p>
<p>tion refers to the &ldquo;author,&rdquo; there is no reason to presume that it does not apply to 
</p>
<p>cases of collective authorship, as in the case of indigenous or traditional communi-
</p>
<p>ties&rsquo; cultural expressions.
</p>
<p> The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains 
</p>
<p>a similar clause in Article 15(c). It affirms that everyone has the right &ldquo;to benefit 
</p>
<p>correa </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>245
</p>
<p>from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scien-
</p>
<p>tific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.&rdquo;33 Significantly, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the body charged with inter-
</p>
<p>preting the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Comment 17&rdquo; on article 15(c), specifically states that &ldquo;the moral and mate-
</p>
<p>rial interests resulting from one&rsquo;s scientific, literary and artistic productions safe-
</p>
<p>guards the personal link between authors and their creations and between peo-
</p>
<p>ples, communities, or other groups and their collective cultural heritage.&rdquo; It also 
</p>
<p>affirms that states &ldquo;should adopt measures to ensure the effective protection of 
</p>
<p>the interests of indigenous peoples relating to their productions, which are often 
</p>
<p>expressions of their cultural heritage and traditional knowledge.&rdquo;34
</p>
<p> It is to be noted that the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</p>
<p>does not refer to &ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; but more generally to &ldquo;interests.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>In &ldquo;General Comment 17,&rdquo; it draws a distinction between human rights, which &ldquo;are 
</p>
<p>fundamental as they are inherent to the human person as such,&rdquo; and intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights, which &ldquo;are first and foremost means by which States seek to pro-
</p>
<p>vide incentives for inventiveness and creativity, encourage the dissemination of 
</p>
<p>creative and innovative productions, as well as the development of cultural identi-
</p>
<p>ties, and preserve the integrity of scientific, literary and artistic productions for 
</p>
<p>the benefit of society as a whole.&rdquo;35 The comment adds:
</p>
<p>In contrast to human rights, intellectual property rights are generally of a temporary 
</p>
<p>nature, and can be revoked, licensed or assigned to someone else. While under most 
</p>
<p>intellectual property systems, intellectual property rights, often with the exception 
</p>
<p>of moral rights, may be allocated, limited in time and scope, traded, amended and 
</p>
<p>even forfeited, human rights are timeless expressions of fundamental entitlements 
</p>
<p>of the human person. Whereas the human right to benefit from the protection of 
</p>
<p>the moral and material interests resulting from one&rsquo;s scientific, literary and artistic 
</p>
<p>productions safeguards the personal link between authors and their creations and 
</p>
<p>between peoples, communities, or other groups and their collective cultural heri-
</p>
<p>tage, as well as their basic material interests which are necessary to enable authors 
</p>
<p>to enjoy an adequate standard of living, intellectual property regimes primarily pro-
</p>
<p>tect business and corporate interests and investments. Moreover, the scope of pro-
</p>
<p>tection of the moral and material interests of the author provided for by article 15, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 1(c), does not necessarily coincide with what is referred to as intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights under national legislation or international agreements.36
</p>
<p> As this comment suggests, although traditional knowledge does not need to 
</p>
<p>be protected under intellectual property rights, the moral and material interests 
</p>
<p>of those who create and maintain traditional knowledge need to be respected as 
</p>
<p>indigenous and traditional knowledge</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>246
</p>
<p>human rights. An implication of this statement is that the misappropriation of 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge, for instance through patents by those lacking the right 
</p>
<p>to apply for them (or by those who have failed to compensate and acknowledge 
</p>
<p>the contributions of others), violates a fundamental right. Moreover, traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge may not be considered freely available and usable by any party. Hence, 
</p>
<p>it cannot be regarded as integrated with the public domain in the sense of informa-
</p>
<p>tion free to be used and consumed.
</p>
<p> Finally, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
</p>
<p>adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2007, recognizes that &ldquo;respect 
</p>
<p>for indigenous knowledge, cultures and traditional practices contributes to sus-
</p>
<p>tainable and equitable development and proper management of the environment.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Specifically, Article 31 of the declaration states the following:
</p>
<p>1. Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop 
</p>
<p>their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expres-
</p>
<p>sions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, 
</p>
<p>including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the 
</p>
<p>properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and tra-
</p>
<p>ditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to main-
</p>
<p>tain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.
</p>
<p>2. In conjunction with indigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to 
</p>
<p>recognize and protect the exercise of these rights.37
</p>
<p> In more straightforward wording than that used in the Convention on Bio-
</p>
<p>logical Diversity and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights, the declaration affirms that indigenous peoples have the &ldquo;right to main-
</p>
<p>tain, control, protect and develop&rsquo;&rsquo; their knowledge and &ldquo;also the right to . . . their 
</p>
<p>intellectual property.&rdquo; Consistently with &ldquo;Comment 17,&rdquo; the declaration does not 
</p>
<p>subsume all rights over traditional knowledge into the categories of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property. This means that these rights exist independently from their formal rec-
</p>
<p>ognition as intellectual property. The declaration thus also seems to support the 
</p>
<p>view that traditional knowledge is not a res nullius that everyone may use and 
</p>
<p>eventually appropriate to his or her own benefit.
</p>
<p> It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the legal value or status of the 
</p>
<p>referred-to provisions in the Convention on Biological Diversity, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the UN declarations. What-
</p>
<p>ever that legal value is, however, they state unequivocally that traditional knowl-
</p>
<p>edge may not be considered to belong to the public domain or to be open for free 
</p>
<p>and/or uncompensated use. The discussed precedents of international law suggest 
</p>
<p>correa </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>247
</p>
<p>some limits to nations&rsquo; freedom with regard to traditional knowledge. As a mini-
</p>
<p>mum, they cannot treat traditional knowledge as freely available and appropriable 
</p>
<p>information, nor can they legitimize the misappropriation of traditional knowledge 
</p>
<p>on the basis of legal fictions, such as assuming that information not published 
</p>
<p>within a given territory is &ldquo;novel&rdquo; and hence susceptible of being patented by the 
</p>
<p>person who disclosed it in a patent application.
</p>
<p>implications for a2k
</p>
<p>The preceding analysis indicates that traditional knowledge cannot, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with accepted principles of international law, be deemed part of the public domain 
</p>
<p>if &ldquo;the public domain&rdquo; is defined as the pool of information that is freely usable. 
</p>
<p>It may, however, be considered part of the public domain if the concept is more 
</p>
<p>narrowly interpreted as including information not covered by intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights, but not necessarily freely usable for this reason.
</p>
<p> Is this conclusion consistent with the initiatives aiming at promoting access to 
</p>
<p>and wide diffusion of knowledge? This seems to be the case if it is accepted that 
</p>
<p>such initiatives consent to some form of &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; intellectual property rights, pro-
</p>
<p>tection of traditional knowledge does not necessarily entail the granting of exclu-
</p>
<p>sive intellectual property rights, and protection of traditional knowledge is justi-
</p>
<p>fied, among other reasons, by considerations of equity and human development.
</p>
<p> In effect, the majority of the actors in the A2K movement do not seek the abo-
</p>
<p>lition of all forms of intellectual property rights, but the proper balance between 
</p>
<p>public and private interests. The Adelphi Charter, for instance, points out that &ldquo;the 
</p>
<p>public interest requires a balance between the public domain and private rights. It 
</p>
<p>also requires a balance between the free competition that is essential for economic 
</p>
<p>vitality and the monopoly rights granted by intellectual property laws.&rdquo;38 James 
</p>
<p>Boyle, in his &ldquo;Manifesto on WIPO and the Future of Intellectual Property,&rdquo; also 
</p>
<p>calls for balance:
</p>
<p>As intellectual property protection has expanded exponentially in breadth, scope 
</p>
<p>and term over the last 30 years, the fundamental principle of balance between the 
</p>
<p>public domain and the realm of property seems to have been lost. The potential 
</p>
<p>costs of this loss of balance are just as worrisome as the costs of piracy that so 
</p>
<p>dominate discussion in international policy making. Where the traditional idea of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property wound a thin layer of rights around a carefully preserved pub-
</p>
<p>lic domain, the contemporary attitude seems to be that the public domain should be 
</p>
<p>eliminated wherever possible. Copyrights and patents, for example, were tradition-
</p>
<p>ally only supposed to confer property rights in expression and invention respec-
</p>
<p>tively. The layer of ideas above, and of facts below, remained in the public domain 
</p>
<p>indigenous and traditional knowledge</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>248
</p>
<p>for all to draw on, to innovate anew. Ideas and facts could never be owned. Yet 
</p>
<p>contemporary intellectual property law is rapidly abandoning this central principle. 
</p>
<p>Now we have database rights over facts, gene sequence, business method and soft-
</p>
<p>ware patents, digital fences that enclose the public domain together with the realm 
</p>
<p>of private property . . . the list continues.39
</p>
<p> Protection of traditional knowledge,40 on the other hand, may be conceived of 
</p>
<p>as a means to prevent different modalities of the misappropriation of traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge (sometimes called &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; protection), rather than as a tool for the 
</p>
<p>granting of positive rights (often called &ldquo;offensive protection&rdquo;). Moreover, positive 
</p>
<p>rights may not confer exclusivity. They may be based on a remuneration right or a 
</p>
<p>liability rule,41 in line with the paradigm of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 
</p>
<p>which does not require or suggest the establishment of exclusive rights.42 Indeed, 
</p>
<p>many indigenous communities reject the very idea of exclusive property over their 
</p>
<p>knowledge or of obtaining payment for its use. In addition, if intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights were established for traditional knowledge, their holders might encounter 
</p>
<p>enormous difficulties in enforcing them, given the need to comply with certain for-
</p>
<p>malities (except in the case of copyright) and, above all, the high cost of enforcing 
</p>
<p>rights in courts. Enforcement procedures are generally long and may be prohibi-
</p>
<p>tively costly for holders of traditional knowledge, particularly if litigation is to take 
</p>
<p>place in foreign countries.43 In some cases, such as in the case of the U.S. patent 
</p>
<p>on an ayahuasca variety, NGOs assumed the defense of the interests of traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge holders, and this may be the only feasible approach in many situations.
</p>
<p> Finally, one of the main reasons for seeking protection for traditional knowl-
</p>
<p>edge (often implicit in various analyses and proposals on the subject) is the lack 
</p>
<p>of equity in current relations between indigenous/traditional communities and 
</p>
<p>the rest of society. A main objective of such protection would be to obtain moral 
</p>
<p>recognition or some economic compensation for the commercial use of traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge, or both. In addition, the protection of traditional knowledge may be 
</p>
<p>a component of policies aimed at preserving the cultures of those communities 
</p>
<p>while ensuring possession of their lands and participation in decisions that affect 
</p>
<p>the use of resources under their control. If properly designed and implemented, 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge protection thus may be instrumental to human development 
</p>
<p>and the realization of human rights.
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>A number of ongoing initiatives aim at broadening A2K. Given the importance of 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge for developing countries and the imperative to ensure an 
</p>
<p>correa </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>249
</p>
<p>equity-based utilization of that knowledge, it seems necessary to clarify its legal 
</p>
<p>status and the conditions under which it may be eventually appropriated or shared.
</p>
<p> In accordance with Western intellectual property rights laws and principles, 
</p>
<p>knowledge created and held by indigenous or traditional communities may be 
</p>
<p>deemed to belong to the public domain if understood as the pool of knowledge 
</p>
<p>that is not subject to existing modalities of intellectual property rights. This would 
</p>
<p>mean that traditional knowledge could be freely used without prior consent from 
</p>
<p>or compensation to their holders.
</p>
<p> National law determines what does and does not belong in the public domain. 
</p>
<p>In some cases, national solutions permit the appropriation of traditional knowledge 
</p>
<p>by individuals or companies that have obtained access to traditional knowledge,  
</p>
<p>even without the consent of its holders. A number of provisions in international 
</p>
<p>instruments, however, recognize rights in favor of such communities. Although 
</p>
<p>such rights do not necessarily pertain to one of the categories of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights, they would clearly exclude traditional knowledge from the realm of 
</p>
<p>freely usable knowledge.
</p>
<p> The need to protect traditional knowledge may be justified, among other rea-
</p>
<p>sons, on the grounds of equity and development. Protection for intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights does not seem incompatible with the philosophy that underpins the A2K 
</p>
<p>movement, particularly if such protection is conceived in defensive terms, with the 
</p>
<p>intention of preventing misappropriation, rather than asserting positive rights.

</p>
<p>After World War II, the chemical industries of the West shifted their attention 
</p>
<p>back to civilian applications, including the large-scale production of synthetic 
</p>
<p>urea, organochlorines, and other fertilizers and pesticides. These agrochemicals 
</p>
<p>were marketed supposedly to provide additional nutrition for farmers&rsquo; crops and 
</p>
<p>to kill crop pests. However, farmers and governments did not realize that these 
</p>
<p>products also killed, incapacitated, weakened, or otherwise made life difficult for 
</p>
<p>very important but little-known creatures: soil organisms that turn organic matter 
</p>
<p>into natural plant food and friendly organisms such as predators and parasites that 
</p>
<p>keep pest populations in check. These creatures constituted a vast, largely invis-
</p>
<p>ible, and unrecognized commons into which all farmers unknowingly tapped every 
</p>
<p>time they planted seeds and grew crops. In their defense, the chemical industry 
</p>
<p>might claim that they did not know, either, which would be an admission of reck-
</p>
<p>lessness, if not negligence. But this excuse was untenable by the 1960s, when the 
</p>
<p>chemical industry viciously attacked Rachel Carson and her book, Silent Spring,1 
</p>
<p>which called attention to the harmful effects of DDT and other agrochemicals on 
</p>
<p>nontarget organisms, including human beings.2
</p>
<p> In effect, the chemical industry was selling farmers and governments a deadly 
</p>
<p>technological Trojan horse, an antiabundance poisoned pill. Agrochemicals 
</p>
<p>appeared to offer more abundant harvests. In truth, their deployment would gradu-
</p>
<p>ally weaken and take the life out of the farmers&rsquo; biological support systems, includ-
</p>
<p>ing natural sources of plant food and the enemies of pests. As more agrochemicals 
</p>
<p>were used, the diverse soil populations dwindled, the soil became less fertile, and 
</p>
<p>farmers&rsquo; crops starved. To keep the plants from starving, more synthetic fertilizers 
</p>
<p>had to be added, which caused the living soil populations to dwindle even further. 
</p>
<p>As the predator and parasite populations likewise dwindled, pest populations went 
</p>
<p>up. So farmers had to spray more pesticides, which then killed even more predators

<p>and parasites. More recent studies based on the theory of trophobiosis&mdash;the theory 
</p>
<p>that the relations between plant and parasite are essentially nutritional in nature&mdash;
</p>
<p>suggest that synthetic fertilizers actually make plants more attractive to pests.3 
</p>
<p>Farmers who took the poisoned pill were caught in the trap and fell into agrochemi-
</p>
<p>cal addiction, draining life out of the soil and around the crops.
</p>
<p>undermining abundance, creating scarcity
</p>
<p>The poisoned pill of agrochemical fertilizers and pesticides is just one example of 
</p>
<p>the ways in which technology and, as we will see, the law are increasingly used to 
</p>
<p>undermine processes of abundance intrinsic to nature and agriculture and even 
</p>
<p>processes intrinsic to the information sector as well. A variety of techniques based 
</p>
<p>in both technology and law, separately or in various combinations, are being inten-
</p>
<p>tionally used counterproductively by businesses and governments to undermine 
</p>
<p>abundance and create artificial scarcity. In the examples that follow, technological 
</p>
<p>approaches such as copy protection, copy restriction, copy identification, and user 
</p>
<p>restriction often are combined with legal restrictions such as the enforcement of 
</p>
<p>patents, copyrights, and plant-variety protection and with bans on simple copy-
</p>
<p>ing, seed sales, and seed exchanges. They are also combined with laws to protect 
</p>
<p>technological copy-protection schemes from being bypassed or to mandate its use. 
</p>
<p>These technologies are actively promoted by governments through incentives such 
</p>
<p>as low-cost credit, subsidies, and other forms of support, while similar incentives 
</p>
<p>are withdrawn from competing technologies. If the poisoned-pill strategy or these 
</p>
<p>other strategies fail to work, the abundant resource and related know-how often 
</p>
<p>are simply ignored or suppressed as much as possible.
</p>
<p>agriculture and the law: seed dependence
</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the International Rice Research Institute introduced IR-8, the first of a 
</p>
<p>series of new &ldquo;high-yielding varieties&rdquo; of rice whose high yields partly came from 
</p>
<p>their better responsiveness to chemical treatment.4 Farmers were wary, and few 
</p>
<p>were willing to let go of their traditional varieties. Drawn by aggressive govern-
</p>
<p>ment subsidies and lending programs, however, more and more farmers switched. 
</p>
<p>As they did, they also stopped planting their heirloom varieties, which were soon 
</p>
<p>lost, because the old seeds they had saved dried up and died. As the heirloom vari-
</p>
<p>eties disappeared and dependence on high-yielding varieties grew, farmers also 
</p>
<p>lost their selection and breeding skills.
</p>
<p> Agrochemicals and the new chemically responsive varieties would eventually 
</p>
<p>be promoted as the &ldquo;Green Revolution.&rdquo;5 Even today, this technological poisoned </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>undermining abundance 255
</p>
<p>pill continues to keep millions of farmers addicted to agrochemicals, mired in  
</p>
<p>poverty and debt.
</p>
<p> Another facet in the technological substitutions of this period in nature and 
</p>
<p>agriculture was the gradual replacement of work animals by farm machinery. In the 
</p>
<p>Philippines, for instance, carabaos&mdash;a domesticated subspecies of water buffalo&mdash;
</p>
<p>were the farmers&rsquo; main source of mechanical power. Carabaos also grazed the less 
</p>
<p>fertile areas around the farm, their dung enriching the soil. The animal usually 
</p>
<p>recovered by itself from injury or sickness. Even more&mdash;perhaps the most amazing 
</p>
<p>thing of all&mdash;the female carabao can give birth to another carabao every two years 
</p>
<p>or so. Yet through the same poisoned-pill strategy, farm machinery suppliers and 
</p>
<p>the government eventually managed to get many farmers to switch to a mechani-
</p>
<p>cal power source that cost a fortune, was fueled by expensive imported gasoline 
</p>
<p>instead of free grass, gave out noxious pollutants instead of milk and natural fertil-
</p>
<p>izer, required a skilled technician and costly spare parts if it stopped working, and 
</p>
<p>of course never gave birth to its own replacement.
</p>
<p> Also in the 1960s, another development would worsen this slippery slide 
</p>
<p>toward seed dependence. U.S. seed companies introduced their commercial version 
</p>
<p>of the F1 corn hybrid developed decades earlier in the public sector.6 (&ldquo;F1&rdquo; means 
</p>
<p>the first filial generation after crossing two different parental lines.) Unlike heir-
</p>
<p>loom varieties, F1 hybrids did not breed true. When their seeds are replanted, the 
</p>
<p>offsprings&rsquo; characteristics segregate, and the desirable traits are expressed weakly 
</p>
<p>or irregularly in subsequent generations. So regardless of the benefits that the cur-
</p>
<p>rent crop might offer, saving seeds becomes pointless.
</p>
<p> Corn farmers now had to buy hybrid seeds from the seed suppliers every plant-
</p>
<p>ing season. Obviously they still had the option to go back to traditional variet-
</p>
<p>ies, but government technicians promoted the hybrid varieties aggressively and 
</p>
<p>extended highly subsidized credit to the farmers who used them. So the use of F1 
</p>
<p>hybrids among corn farmers grew.
</p>
<p> As more farmers abandoned their traditional corn, these varieties became 
</p>
<p>scarce and gradually disappeared. Commercial hybrid corn varieties eventually 
</p>
<p>dominated the seed-corn market, the way the high-yielding varieties did among 
</p>
<p>rice farmers&mdash;but with a difference. Seed buying had been an occasional purchase 
</p>
<p>in the past, when seeds produced their own kind, but hybrids led to repeat sales, 
</p>
<p>season after season, turning seeds into highly profitable commodities.
</p>
<p> As the seed business became more profitable, giant agrochemical firms began 
</p>
<p>buying up the seed companies that had established themselves in the market. A 
</p>
<p>similar corporate trend toward F1 hybrids emerged in the vegetable sector and, 
</p>
<p>later, in the rice sector, a trend that continues today.7
</p>
<p> F1 hybrids mark the beginning of corporate efforts to gain full control over seeds, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>256
</p>
<p>especially in major staple crops and vegetables. They also represent the first tech-
</p>
<p>nology in agriculture explicitly meant to end the farmers&rsquo; age-old practice of saving 
</p>
<p>part of their harvest to use as seed in the next planting season. This counterproduc-
</p>
<p>tive technology strikes at the very heart of sustainability and the seed commons.
</p>
<p> Commercial seed breeders took care that nonhybrid varieties would remain 
</p>
<p>under their control, too. Their demand for exclusive rights over varieties that 
</p>
<p>they developed eventually gave rise to the 1961 Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>New Varieties of Plants. This convention defined plant breeders&rsquo; rights, mandated 
</p>
<p>plant-variety protection, and established an international union, the UPOV, to 
</p>
<p>work for plant breeders&rsquo; interests. As countries acceded to UPOV agreements, they 
</p>
<p>moved to adopt counterproductive national seed laws that limited the freedom of 
</p>
<p>farmers to exchange seeds or to sell them. Subsequent UPOV agreements (in 1972, 
</p>
<p>1978, and 1991) became more and more restrictive of farmers&rsquo; rights.8 The result was 
</p>
<p>a two-pronged offensive against seed saving and exchange: promotion of the tech-
</p>
<p>nology of hybrids and new laws and international agreements restricting farmers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>options over seeds.
</p>
<p> In the early 1980s, seed companies learned to modify plant genomes directly 
</p>
<p>through genetic engineering.9 Then they patented the modified genes, using the 
</p>
<p>patent system&mdash;originally meant for industrial inventions and designs&mdash;to claim 
</p>
<p>exclusive rights over seeds and plants with the patented genes.10 This new weapon 
</p>
<p>in the growing corporate arsenal of counterproductive practices was even more 
</p>
<p>restrictive than plant-variety protection: The novelty of the technology itself now 
</p>
<p>justified excluding everyone by law from using patented seeds unless they paid 
</p>
<p>some kind of royalty or technology fee.
</p>
<p> The first commercially successful applications were soya and canola plants that 
</p>
<p>incorporated herbicidal resistance and corn plants that incorporated pesticidal tox-
</p>
<p>ins. For the first time, seed companies held the power to sue farmers who saved 
</p>
<p>the seeds of these crops and planted them in a subsequent season, simply on the 
</p>
<p>strength of the patents they held over the genes incorporated in these seeds.
</p>
<p> Genetically engineered corn was also a poisoned pill, engineered to produce a 
</p>
<p>modified version of a pesticidal toxin from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. 
</p>
<p>Organic farmers had used Bacillus thuringiensis for decades to control corn pests, 
</p>
<p>prudently spraying the cultured bacteria only if pest damage reached significant 
</p>
<p>levels. When the Bacillus thuringiensis gene was inserted into the corn plant, the 
</p>
<p>resulting Bacillus thuringiensis corn now expressed the toxin throughout the plant&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>life, making it more likely for Bacillus thuringiensis resistance to develop rapidly 
</p>
<p>among the target pests and sabotaging a resource that organic farmers&mdash;the nem-
</p>
<p>esis of the agrochemical/genetic-engineering industry&mdash;had used for decades.
</p>
<p> Counterproductive technologies now in the pipeline are taking to higher levels

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>257
</p>
<p>the bizarre goal of attacking natural abundance to create artificial scarcity in agri-
</p>
<p>culture. This opens a market for substitute products and leads to a supply sys-
</p>
<p>tem completely under corporate control through various technological and legal 
</p>
<p>mechanisms.11
</p>
<p> The precursor of these technologies is the &ldquo;Terminator Technology,&rdquo; which 
</p>
<p>genetically modifies plants to make their seeds sterile, ending the 350-million-
</p>
<p>year-old process of reproduction through seeds. Truly, it is the &ldquo;death of birth.&rdquo;12 
</p>
<p>U.S. patents were granted, though commercial applications seem a long way off. 
</p>
<p>The real question was: Would farmers use them? The idea was so outrageous that 
</p>
<p>its promoters backtracked for a while, trying to find a spin that would make their 
</p>
<p>idea more publicly palatable.
</p>
<p> They soon found one. Engineered seeds lead to a seemingly intractable prob-
</p>
<p>lem: genetic contamination. Engineered soya and canola, which had survived 
</p>
<p>despite herbicide applications, were showing up in places where they were nei-
</p>
<p>ther expected nor wanted&mdash;on farms that had used no engineered seeds, espe-
</p>
<p>cially organic farms where strict safety standards prohibit such seeds. So on the 
</p>
<p>strength of their patent claims, Monsanto sued. The farmers insisted that they had 
</p>
<p>used no engineered varieties. Yet some plants on their farms tested positive for 
</p>
<p>Campaigning material produced by  
</p>
<p>Progressio (www.polyp.org.uk/Progressio;  
</p>

<p>Monsanto&rsquo;s patented genes. Many farmers, intimidated by Monsanto&rsquo;s legal and 
</p>
<p>financial muscle, paid the fines and suffered the consequences, such as losing their 
</p>
<p>organic certification. However, in one celebrated case that dragged on for years, 
</p>
<p>Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser stood his ground and fought the legal battle to 
</p>
<p>the end. The Canadian Supreme Court issued an ambiguous decision which each 
</p>
<p>side interpreted as its victory.13 Promoters of the Terminator Technology now say 
</p>
<p>that their technology can prevent genetic contamination from engineered crops by 
</p>
<p>further modifying these crops to produce sterile seeds.
</p>
<p> New ideas in the pipeline fine tune the concept further to allow finer-grained 
</p>
<p>control of sterility. Known as genetic use-restriction technologies, these will 
</p>
<p>enable the seed companies to control seed sterility in the field through external 
</p>
<p>triggers such as chemicals&mdash;presumably patented, too. By spraying this chemi-
</p>
<p>cal on a genetic use-restriction-modified plant, the plant can be induced to turn 
</p>
<p>its sterility (or fertility) on or off. Scarcity and abundance thus can be marketed 
</p>
<p>under full corporate control. A similar technology can also be used for turning 
</p>
<p>genetically engineered traits themselves on or off.
</p>
<p> The use of hybrids and genetic engineering have been justified in the interest 
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;feeding the world.&rdquo; Yet a U.S. Department of Agriculture study in 2006 found 
</p>
<p>that 10 percent of U.S. adults and 17 percent of children occasionally went hungry 
</p>
<p>for lack of food.14 If they cannot even feed all Americans sufficiently, how can 
</p>
<p>they feed the world?
</p>
<p>a virtual cornucopia of software
</p>
<p>The same approach of attacking abundance in order to cause artificial scarcity and 
</p>
<p>create a market for substitute products in a supply system under corporate control 
</p>
<p>occurred in the domain of computer software via the intellectual property laws. In 
</p>
<p>the 1980s and early 1990s, in many countries, for a very affordable fee, one could 
</p>
<p>copy from computer shops almost any Apple or IBM PC software that was also avail-
</p>
<p>able in the United States. Students, new graduates, and enthusiasts bought cheap 
</p>
<p>IBM clones and practiced basic computer operations, word processing, presentations, 
</p>
<p>spreadsheet uses, database management, and programming. There was no Internet 
</p>
<p>then&mdash;in the Philippines, a 64 Kbps connection ushered in the Internet in 1994&mdash;but 
</p>
<p>it did not matter. A de facto software commons was maintained in computer shops 
</p>
<p>and on electronic bulletin-board systems that made software quickly and efficiently 
</p>
<p>available to students and computer enthusiasts. Many computer professionals today, 
</p>
<p>who now form the backbone of their country&rsquo;s computer industry or who enjoy 
</p>
<p>well-paying jobs abroad as overseas workers, regularly dipped into this cornucopia 
</p>
<p>and acquired their computing skills thanks to the software abundance of that period.

</p>
<p> Back in the United States, software developers tried various copy-protection 
</p>
<p>schemes, from nonstandard disk formats to hardware dongles.15 But the best 
</p>
<p>minds of the U.S. software industry were no match for the resourcefulness of 
</p>
<p>hackers and altruists who wanted to keep the abundance coming. Some U.S. com-
</p>
<p>panies even specialized in software that duplicated copy-protected software. Other 
</p>
<p>software developers abandoned copy protection to gain a competitive advantage, 
</p>
<p>and consumers responded favorably. Eventually, the U.S. software industry gave 
</p>
<p>in and, except for some niche markets, abandoned technical copy-protection  
</p>
<p>schemes altogether.
</p>
<p> Invoking copyright laws did not help much. Though software was legally pro-
</p>
<p>tected by copyright laws and international agreements, many countries did not 
</p>
<p>take these seriously, preferring to let their citizens enjoy the abundance that then 
</p>
<p>prevailed. People likewise knew that governments enforce laws selectively any-
</p>
<p>way, whether they are laws on the minimum wage, corruption, pollution, taxes, 
</p>
<p>elections, or copyrights. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the United 
</p>
<p>States itself was a center of piracy of British books and publications. Subsequent 
</p>
<p>experiences in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other countries and territories 
</p>
<p>likewise showed that copying is a necessary stage in national development. Fur-
</p>
<p>thermore, the countries that complained most loudly about the piracy of their  
</p>
<p>intellectual property were themselves most guilty of pirating intellectuals such 
</p>
<p>as doctors, nurses, and engineers from the Third World. The latter was deemed a 
</p>
<p>more malignant case of piracy because it took away the original and left no copy 
</p>
<p>behind. Finally, how can a government clamp down on its citizens when commer-
</p>
<p>cial software is freely copied between government computers?16
</p>
<p> Things began to change after the 1994 formation of the World Trade Organiza-
</p>
<p>tion (WTO). This global system adopted effective mechanisms to enforce its highly 
</p>
<p>protectionist provisions on intellectual property. An international legal infrastruc-
</p>
<p>ture was gradually built that, combined with strong diplomatic pressures and eco-
</p>
<p>nomic threats, started to turn the tide for copyright holders.
</p>
<p> In the Philippines, a turning point occurred in 1998, when Microsoft chairman 
</p>
<p>Bill Gates visited President Fidel Ramos.17 Gates offered to recognize as legal all 
</p>
<p>copies of Microsoft products installed in government computers. In return, Ramos 
</p>
<p>promised to enforce copyright laws, now that the government&rsquo;s copies were 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;legal.&rdquo; The United States still needed to direct a whole series of economic, politi-
</p>
<p>cal, and diplomatic pressures on the administrations that followed Ramos&rsquo;s, but 
</p>
<p>the days of software abundance in the Philippines appeared to be numbered.
</p>
<p> As copyright enforcement began in earnest, CDs, video CDs, and DVDs were 
</p>
<p>introduced in the 1990s and early 2000s. For a while, the industry managed to pre-
</p>
<p>vent copying and to restrict the use of DVDs by geographical region. However, 
</p>
<p>undermining abundance</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>260
</p>
<p>this was eventually thwarted by a combination of dedicated hacking, the technical 
</p>
<p>savvy of rising industrial giant China, and plain consumer freedom of choice.
</p>
<p> The Philippine case is probably typical: When illegal CD, video CD, and DVD 
</p>
<p>discs began to circulate, rumors spread that these discs could damage the disc 
</p>
<p>player. The original players made in the United States, Europe, or Japan were so 
</p>
<p>expensive that owners would not risk damage from discs of unknown quality. So 
</p>
<p>those who bought the original players stuck to expensive original discs and suf-
</p>
<p>fered under ridiculous geographic restrictions: DVDs sent home by U.S.-based or 
</p>
<p>Middle East&ndash;based relatives were unreadable, and players they sent or brought 
</p>
<p>home could not play locally available DVDs.
</p>
<p> Enter China. Cheap DVD players that could play discs from any geographic 
</p>
<p>region and priced at one-fifth or less of their competitors flooded the Asian mar-
</p>
<p>ket, including the Philippines. Another rumor&mdash;perhaps apocryphal&mdash;began to 
</p>
<p>circulate: that original DVDs might damage these players. Between China-made 
</p>
<p>machines that played cheap, unauthorized discs and branded players that played 
</p>
<p>only high-priced discs that were also geographically restricted, it was no contest. 
</p>
<p>With the further entry of low-cost CD/DVD burners, duplicating these read-only 
</p>
<p>discs became easy.
</p>
<p> So Asia remains a flourishing market of China-made DVD players and unau-
</p>
<p>thorized CDs and DVDs, creating a new abundance of cultural fare for Asians. 
</p>
<p>Many of the DVDs are adult material or otherwise of doubtful cultural value. But 
</p>
<p>most regular movies are available, too, as are, increasingly, movie classics and truly 
</p>
<p>educational collections of documentaries from the Discovery Channel, National 
</p>
<p>Geographic, and similar cable channels&mdash;software, too. In some countries, the 
</p>
<p>materials are made more accessible to ordinary people by translations into the 
</p>
<p>local language.
</p>
<p> To suppress the new abundance, special government police and private detec-
</p>
<p>tives from the United States now regularly conduct surprise raids not only against 
</p>
<p>the disc vendors and distributors, but also against businesses, schools, computer 
</p>
<p>shops, and Internet caf&eacute;s that use unauthorized software. These highly disruptive 
</p>
<p>raids have driven CD/DVD and software copying underground, where it flourishes 
</p>
<p>unabated, thanks to cheap China-made disc burners.18
</p>
<p> In the United States, another round of efforts against unauthorized copying 
</p>
<p>was launched under the banner of digital rights management (DRM), consolidat-
</p>
<p>ing counterproductive technological and legal measures for finer-grained control of 
</p>
<p>copying and access to materials in digital media and on the Internet. DRM includes 
</p>
<p>content encryption, digital signatures, digital fingerprinting, digital watermarks, 
</p>
<p>digital serial numbers built into central processing units and computer mother-
</p>
<p>boards, and miscellaneous authentication systems. They involve such concepts as 
</p>
<p>verzola </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>261
</p>
<p>conditional access systems, remote revocation of use rights, and other means to 
</p>
<p>ensure that scarcity and abundance remain under tight corporate control. They may 
</p>
<p>be aptly called digital use-restriction technologies, after their genetic counterparts 
</p>
<p>for controlling seed reproduction, the genetic use-restriction technologies.
</p>
<p> The U.S. remains ahead in the development of digital use-restriction tech-
</p>
<p>nologies and genetic use-restriction technologies, having the most corporate 
</p>
<p>interests to protect, especially in the information sector. The U.S. Digital Millen-
</p>
<p>nium Copyright Act now mandates and protects digital use-restriction technolo-
</p>
<p>gies themselves, making it illegal to construct devices that bypass or disable these 
</p>
<p>technologies. Citizens&rsquo; groups in the United States such as the Electronic Fron-
</p>
<p>tier Foundation and Public Knowledge are concerned about the impact of DRM 
</p>
<p>and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act on privacy, political freedoms, and  
</p>
<p>human rights.19
</p>
<p> The increasing availability of high-quality free and open-source software, 
</p>
<p>however, has pulled the rug from under the argument that creativity can be 
</p>
<p>encouraged only by granting creators statutory monopolies through intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights. In the information sector, as well as in the agriculture sec-

</p>
<p>continues through skirmishes on the technology front, in the legal arena, and, of 
</p>
<p>course, in the market.
</p>
<p>creating artificial scarcity elsewhere
</p>
<p>Counterproductive efforts to control abundance and produce scarcity have 
</p>
<p>occurred in other fields, as well. Drug laws make medically effective herbal prepa-
</p>
<p>rations inaccessible to many. Ironically, herbs easily grown in backyards and com-
</p>
<p>munity gardens, whose preparations would be illegal if prescribed by traditional 
</p>
<p>healers, are often the basis for very expensive patented drugs manufactured by 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical firms.20 It is not a coincidence that many of these firms are owned 
</p>
<p>by the same agrochemical companies that control the seed industry.
</p>
<p> Through misleading advertising and collusion with hospitals and medical pro-
</p>
<p>fessionals, formula milk companies have managed to undermine mothers&rsquo; confi-
</p>
<p>dence in their own breast milk. This had led to a decline in breast-feeding in a 
</p>
<p>number of Asian countries.21 As mothers try substitutes, their production of milk 
</p>
<p>slows down and eventually stops, creating a vast new market for formula milk.
</p>
<p> A traditional Filipino song about plants found around the hut, &ldquo;Bahay Kubo,&rdquo;22 
</p>
<p>taught to every child in grade school, enumerates eighteen food plants that include 
</p>
<p>legumes, greens, root crops, seeds, nuts, and spices. The song omits many more. 
</p>
<p>Filipinos have become so fixated on Western foods and diets that they overlook 
</p>
<p>the great variety of indigenous food sources, many of which simply grow untended 
</p>
<p>like weeds in their backyards. The monoculture mindset treats these food sources as 
</p>
<p>indeed weeds that must be suppressed. Razed by farm mechanization and the use of 
</p>
<p>herbicides, most of them have now disappeared from people&rsquo;s backyards, from their 
</p>
<p>diets, and from their consciousnesses, creating real food scarcity and malnutrition.
</p>
<p> Organic products are scarce and expensive because a system biased toward 
</p>
<p>chemicals imposes on organic producers the burden of proof: detailed record keep-
</p>
<p>ing, testing, inspection, certification and labeling. What if, in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle, producers of chemically treated crops and foods, not 
</p>
<p>organic producers, were required by law to keep detailed records of chemical treat-
</p>
<p>ments, get their products regularly inspected and tested by accredited laboratories 
</p>
<p>for minimum residue levels, undergo third-party certification, and follow mandatory 
</p>
<p>labeling requirements to identify to which chemicals and by what amounts their 
</p>
<p>food products have been exposed? If this were so, the price tags of both organic and 
</p>
<p>chemically treated foods would change dramatically in favor of organics.

<p> A low-power radio station that can serve a large community or a small town

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>263
</p>
<p>requirements to operate one. As communications expert and president of the 
</p>
<p>World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters Steve Buckley writes, &ldquo;it is 
</p>
<p>the policy, legal and regulatory framework that remains the single most persistent 
</p>
<p>obstacle&rdquo; to such stations.23
</p>
<p> Internet service providers continue to charge exorbitant rates for static Inter-
</p>
<p>net Protocol (IP) numbers, arguing that they are running out of these numbers. 
</p>
<p>Yet by simply upgrading to IP Version 6, every person on Earth can be assigned 
</p>
<p>hundreds of IP numbers each, with a lot more to spare.
</p>
<p> The sun cannot be hidden, suppressed, made illegal, or otherwise made scarce. 
</p>
<p>Instead, this universal source of abundance has been largely ignored&mdash;intention-
</p>
<p>ally, it has been argued&mdash;as energy industries focus on energy sources easier to 
</p>
<p>privatize and to control, such as fossil and nuclear fuels.24
</p>
<p> These examples suggest that the phenomenon of abundance in the natural 
</p>
<p>world and in human societies should not be taken for granted. We need to study it, 
</p>
<p>learn its dynamics, and tap it for human good.
</p>
<p>abundance in the agriculture and information sectors
</p>
<p>Creating abundance is a matter of reproducing a good over and over again until 
</p>
<p>more than enough is available for everyone&rsquo;s need or even for everyone&rsquo;s capac-
</p>
<p>ity to consume. In nature, the tendency toward bountiful abundance is obvious, 
</p>
<p>especially where seasonal variations highlight the contrast between abundance 
</p>
<p>and scarcity. Prehistoric artifacts of fertility goddesses as well as harvest festivals 
</p>
<p>and rituals still practiced today show the extent to which abundance has been rec-
</p>
<p>ognized and sought.
</p>
<p> Abundance is inherent in the reproductive processes of life. Natural abundance 
</p>
<p>is simply life reasserting itself through the endless cycle of reproduction of its 
</p>
<p>own kind by every life form. This is the wellspring of abundance in nature and in 
</p>
<p>agriculture. The process is self-limiting, too. As every available ecological niche 
</p>
<p>is filled up, species gradually form a food web and settle into a dynamic balance, 
</p>
<p>with closed material cycles ensuring that the balance is maintained. This enables 
</p>
<p>the processes of abundance to continue indefinitely.
</p>
<p> Abundance in the domain of information is different. Sharing information does 
</p>
<p>not diminish or deplete it, but rather multiplies and enriches it. Shared information 
</p>
<p>begets more information. The wellspring of information abundance is the inherent 
</p>
<p>human desire to communicate, to seek information and knowledge, and to share 
</p>
<p>them, an urge that gets more fully expressed as the cost of sharing goes down.25 
</p>
<p>The cost of reproducing electronic signals is now approaching zero. With digital 
</p>
<p>technology, books, artworks, music, and video can now be stored in the same 
</p>
<p>undermining abundance</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>264
</p>
<p>format as software and databases, as a long string of binary values. From these 
</p>
<p>ones and zeroes, with the right equipment and algorithm, an exact copy of the 
</p>
<p>digital original or a faithful copy of the analog original can be reconstructed. Once 
</p>
<p>stored digitally and made available in easily searchable form on a global network, 
</p>
<p>an unlimited number of users may now get any number of exact copies of the 
</p>
<p>work. Who cannot recognize the abundance of human knowledge, experience, and 
</p>
<p>creative work made possible by the Internet? As more and more people discover 
</p>
<p>its possibilities for sharing freely, the whole range of human skills, thought, and 
</p>
<p>feeling is now being made available through this medium.
</p>
<p> From an information perspective, abundance in nature and in agriculture, 
</p>
<p>which is driven by the inherent program within genetic information to reproduce 
</p>
<p>itself, is constrained by material limits, because it must eventually express itself in 
</p>
<p>terms of biomass. Information abundance, on the other hand, is of the nonmaterial 
</p>
<p>variety. Thus, information goods offer the promise of practically unlimited abun-
</p>
<p>dance, constrained mainly by the limits of human creativity, the storage capac-
</p>
<p>ity of media, and the availability of electricity to power servers on the Internet 
</p>
<p>twenty-four hours a day.
</p>
<p>who wants abundance restricted&mdash;and why?
</p>
<p>Abundance helps to meet human needs and wants and should therefore be wel-
</p>
<p>comed. Who, then, could be interested in restricting it? As we have seen, attacks 
</p>
<p>against abundance have been mostly initiated by business firms or by govern-
</p>
<p>ments. Where governments have undertaken these measures, however, they have 
</p>
<p>done so at the instance of business firms, which in the final analysis have reaped 
</p>
<p>the benefits of the government measures.
</p>
<p> Looking more closely at the logic of business firms, it is obvious that the imme-
</p>
<p>diate effect of restricting abundance is to reduce supply and increase demand. This 
</p>
<p>in turn raises prices or keeps their levels high. If the costs of production change 
</p>
<p>little or not at all and prices go up, profits go up. This is the logic behind corporate 
</p>
<p>efforts to develop technologies and influence state policies that give them closer 
</p>
<p>control over the abundance and scarcity of goods: to create the best conditions for 
</p>
<p>maximizing profits.
</p>
<p> Indeed, restricting abundance may maximize profits, but may not necessar-
</p>
<p>ily be the best way to encourage creativity. Free and open-source software and 
</p>
<p>farmer-bred plant varieties show that creativity can continue to flourish even 
</p>
<p>without the attraction of monopoly earnings.
</p>
<p> Shouldn&rsquo;t this selfish end give way to higher societal goals? The economist&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>answer is that society&rsquo;s higher goals are indeed served when everyone pursues his 
</p>
<p>verzola </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>265
</p>
<p>or her own self-interest in free competition with others. In fact, economists argue, 
</p>
<p>the competitive pursuit of individual gain accomplishes overall social goals better, 
</p>
<p>even if this was no part of the individual&rsquo;s intention, than when the individual con-
</p>
<p>sciously tries to advance society&rsquo;s higher goals. The idea that individual pursuit of 
</p>
<p>self-interest not only leads to but is actually the best path toward overall social good 
</p>
<p>became the moral basis for capitalist society. This was programmed into business 
</p>
<p>firms as an urge to maximize gain, and they do so by controlling abundance and 
</p>
<p>scarcity in their favor. This is the driving force behind restrictions on abundance.
</p>
<p> Because individual human beings are a complex bundle of urges, emotions, and 
</p>
<p>motivations who often act irrationally (that is, regardless of self-interest) from 
</p>
<p>an economist&rsquo;s perspective, corporations are the ideal economic agents, pursu-
</p>
<p>ing nothing but maximum gain for themselves based on the economic theory of 
</p>
<p>laissez-faire capitalism.26 They are therefore driven to undermine abundance and 
</p>
<p>create artificial scarcity as an unintended, but logical consequence of their inter-
</p>
<p>nal programming, creating a modern class of rentiers who accumulate wealth by 
</p>
<p>charging fees for access to the resources they control.27
</p>
<p> Viewed more broadly, economics has always assumed a condition of scarcity 
</p>
<p>and defined its goal as the efficient allocation of scarce resources relative to unlim-
</p>
<p>ited human wants. Nowhere does abundance figure in the definition or goals of 
</p>
<p>economics. Practically all economic textbooks are premised on scarcity. Check any 
</p>
<p>index: &ldquo;Scarcity&rdquo; will be found in the early pages&mdash;in the first chapter, probably&mdash;
</p>
<p>and &ldquo;abundance&rdquo; will be missing. In the classic introductory textbook Economics, 
</p>
<p>Paul Samuelson and William Nordhaus write on page 2: &ldquo;At the core, [economics] 
</p>
<p>is devoted to understanding how society allocates its scarce resources. Along the 
</p>
<p>way to studying the implications of scarcity, economics tries to figure out the 1001 
</p>
<p>puzzles of everyday life.&rdquo;28 Some books might refer to &ldquo;overproduction,&rdquo; suggest-
</p>
<p>ing an anomaly to be avoided or corrected. Misunderstanding abundance as over-
</p>
<p>production logically leads to counterproductive measures restricting abundance, a 
</p>
<p>misapplication of concepts developed under assumptions of scarcity.
</p>
<p> Yet once we open our minds, we should see abundance all around us. Solar 
</p>
<p>energy has been with us from the beginning. So have clean air and water, plants 
</p>
<p>and animals, soil life, forests, and the astounding variety of life on Earth, now 
</p>
<p>threatened. Since the Internet emerged, we have also seen an extraordinary abun-
</p>
<p>dance of information and knowledge and no lack of people willing to share them 
</p>
<p>freely. Just look at the World Wide Web, Yahoo!, Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, and 
</p>
<p>all the lesser-known, but incredibly useful efforts to make information and knowl-
</p>
<p>edge freely available on the Internet. New technologies promise even more abun-
</p>
<p>dance: in bandwidth through fiber optics, in air time through spread-spectrum  
</p>
<p>technology, and in storage through new media.

<p>undermining abundance</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>266
</p>
<p> Clearly, abundance is as much a feature of the real world as scarcity is. To 
</p>
<p>understand this blind spot of economics and harness it fully for the human good, 
</p>
<p>we need to construct theories of abundance to complement the theories of scarcity 
</p>
<p>that dominate economics today. In fact, economists who talk of &ldquo;relative scarcity&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>only need a minor leap of logic to recognize &ldquo;relative abundance.&rdquo; After all, a glass 
</p>
<p>that is half empty is also half full.
</p>
<p>constructing a theory of abundance
</p>
<p>consider the variations in abundance
</p>
<p>It can be precarious (with collapse imminent), temporary (lasting less than a life-
</p>
<p>time), short term (lasting a few lifetimes), medium term (lasting many lifetimes), or 
</p>
<p>long term (lasting longer than human existence). It can be relative (enjoyed by a 
</p>
<p>limited number), local (confined to a specific area), or universal (accessible to all). 
</p>
<p>The abundance of solar energy and other energy forms associated with it, such as 
</p>
<p>hydro, wind, and wave energy, is obviously long term. Solar energy is universal, 
</p>
<p>while hydro, wind, and wave energy are more local. Coal&rsquo;s abundance is medium

<p>term, if the estimates are correct that the world&rsquo;s reserves may last for several hun-
</p>
<p>dred years more (that is, for many human generations). Oil, which is perhaps good 
</p>
<p>for another generation or two at current extraction rates, is short term. In addi-
</p>
<p>tion, fossil-fuel abundance is relative, because it is not accessible to all, but only to 
</p>
<p>large firms with enough financial, technical, and human resources. While universal 
</p>
<p>abundance can have free and open access, other forms may need some kind of 
</p>
<p>management. Those who depend on local resources may need to restrict or even 
</p>
<p>exclude outsiders. Extraction rates may need to be regulated. Moratoriums may 
</p>
<p>even have to be imposed on threatened resources. The ultimate goal of any man-
</p>
<p>agement regime should be to ensure against any failure of abundance by pursuing 
</p>
<p>the following specific goals.

<p>make the resource accessible to a greater number of people&mdash; 
</p>
<p>ideally, to all
</p>
<p>This is merely a restatement of the goal of social justice. Potable water, for 
</p>
<p>instance, is so important to human survival that this goal should be paramount for 
</p>
<p>this resource, whether it is abundant or not. For water&mdash;and for land, as well&mdash;
</p>
<p>Gandhi&rsquo;s observation rings true: &ldquo;There is enough in the world for everyone&rsquo;s need, 
</p>
<p>but not for everyone&rsquo;s greed.&rdquo; These resources can become abundant for all or 
</p>
<p>scarce for many, depending on how they are managed. In a country such as the 
</p>
<p>Philippines, land seems scarce to the millions who do not own a home lot, because 
</p>
<p>the ownership structure allows a few to own thousands of hectares of land. Agrar-
</p>
<p>ian reform is, in effect, an effort to keep land abundant for every rural household 
</p>
<p>that is willing to farm land. Some have also argued that family-size farms can be as 
</p>
<p>productive and efficient, if not more so, than huge, corporate-held tracts.29
</p>
<p>make sure the resource will last for generations,  
</p>
<p>preferably indefinitely
</p>
<p>This means turning limited, temporary or short-term abundance into long-term 
</p>
<p>abundance. This is also a restatement of the goal of sustainability. Rain forests, for 
</p>
<p>instance, have been providing countless generations of indigenous tribes every-
</p>
<p>thing they have needed for survival. At current rates of depletion, however, our 
</p>
<p>generation has turned rain forests into a short-term or temporary resource that will 
</p>
<p>be gone in a few generations, if not within our generation. Economists should be 
</p>
<p>familiar with the difference between income and capital, between natural-resource 
</p>
<p>stocks and flows. In the rain forest case, ensuring long-term abundance means lim-
</p>
<p>iting the consumption of forest products to the natural income we get out of the 
</p>
<p>forest and refraining from eating into the capital stock. Strategies for managing 
</p>
<p>nonrenewable resources or information resources would of course be different.
</p>
<p>undermining abundance</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>268
</p>
<p>build a cascade of abundance
</p>
<p>Abundance in one sector (or of one good) can help create abundance in another 
</p>
<p>sector (or of another good). The food chain is a good example of abundance at 
</p>
<p>one level (solar energy) supporting abundance at the next level (plants), which 
</p>
<p>supports abundance at a higher level (herbivores), and so on. By building linkages 
</p>
<p>among farm components, permaculture teaches how one type of abundance can be 
</p>
<p>made to support another through conscious design.30 A similar cascade occurs on 
</p>
<p>the Internet, which supports the Web, which in turn supports search engines and 
</p>
<p>new applications such as wikis and blogs, one abundance building on another. The 
</p>
<p>sun is a flexible energy source that can provide, through collectors and concentra-
</p>
<p>tors, a wide range of temperatures to match various end uses. By tapping it more, 
</p>
<p>industry can harness potentially huge amounts of energy for various productive 
</p>
<p>activities, opening up possibilities for creating abundance in many other sectors. 
</p>
<p>Photovoltaic cells made from silica, also an abundant resource, can transform sun-
</p>
<p>light into cheap electricity for industrial, commercial, and home use. This can make 
</p>
<p>viable the electrolytic extraction of hydrogen and oxygen from water, another 
</p>
<p>abundant resource. These can be stored and later used in fuel cells, holding the 
</p>
<p>promise of a pollution-free, hydrogen-based economy.
</p>
<p> Most computer equipment, which is silicon-based, such as photovoltaic cells, 
</p>
<p>has either been halving in price or doubling in capacity every few years or so. 
</p>
<p>Liquid-crystal-display projectors now sell for a fifth of their price ten years ago. 
</p>
<p>If photovoltaic cell prices follow suit, perhaps due again to China&rsquo;s entry into the 
</p>
<p>global marketplace, we can look forward to a cascade of solar-based abundance  
</p>
<p>in the future.
</p>
<p> Eventually, we should be able to recognize the conditions that lead to abundance 
</p>
<p>and then learn how to create more abundance. We already have a rough idea how 
</p>
<p>abundance happens in nature, in agriculture, and in the information sector. We sim-
</p>
<p>ply need to nurture the forces that generate such abundance. One challenge is how 
</p>
<p>to emulate ecological processes such as the cyclic loops of nature to create a similar 
</p>
<p>material abundance in the industrial sector without disrupting natural cycles.
</p>
<p>develop an ethic that nurtures abundance
</p>
<p>To manage abundance well, its community of beneficiaries must adopt a behav-
</p>
<p>ioral rule set and corresponding enforcement mechanisms. It is desirable eventu-
</p>
<p>ally to turn this rule set into a mind set, similar to Aldo Leopold&rsquo;s land ethic and 
</p>
<p>Sandra Postel&rsquo;s water ethic,31 that is, into an ethic that makes the other goals of 
</p>
<p>social justice, sustainability, cascading abundance, and dynamic balance second 
</p>
<p>nature to all.
</p>

</p>
<p>attain dynamic balance
</p>
<p>In a finite world, material abundance cannot grow indefinitely. Nature shows us 
</p>
<p>how abundance can instead be sustained indefinitely through a dynamic balance 
</p>
<p>(a harmony) of abundant elements connected in closed material cycles. Citing per-
</p>
<p>maculture again as example, a similar balance can be attained in a farm by model-
</p>
<p>ing it after long-lived, self-regenerating ecological systems to design what are, in 
</p>
<p>effect, forests or ponds of food and cash crops. After we learn to design similar 
</p>
<p>closed loops in industry, we can bring this sector back into harmony with the rest 
</p>
<p>of the living world.
</p>
<p> At least four major sources of imbalance threaten our world today. The first 
</p>
<p>is the current reliance on a nonrenewable energy base. Although the size of the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s fossil fuel stock may be debatable, its rate of exploitation will sooner or 
</p>
<p>later surely fail to keep up with rising demand, causing major economic disruptions.
</p>
<p> The second source of imbalance is the linear production processes of the indus-
</p>
<p>trial sector. The industrial sector uses raw materials from nature and agriculture 
</p>
<p>and turns them into finished products. Whether these goods are durable, reus-
</p>
<p>able, or disposable, they are eventually thrown away as waste. Unlike the closed 
</p>
<p>cycles of nature, this is a linear process that consumes biomass, dead matter, and 
</p>
<p>energy at the input end and that produces synthetic, often nonbiodegradable and 
</p>
<p>even toxic goods and wastes at the output end. This one-way transformation con-
</p>
<p>stantly disrupts the dynamic balance and closed loops of the natural world. Even-
</p>
<p>tually, the finished goods reach the end of their useful life&mdash;quickly, if they are 
</p>
<p>disposable or one-time-use goods&mdash;and become wastes, too. If these wastes enter 
</p>
<p>the body of any living organism, including humans, they can seriously disrupt its 
</p>
<p>health. In effect, fueled by an ideology of accumulation, industry is transform-
</p>
<p>ing the natural world into a synthetic and ultimately unlivable place. The solution, 
</p>
<p>as Barry Commoner proposed,32 is to turn linear industrial processes into closed 
</p>
<p>material loops and recycle all industrial wastes as well as goods that have reached 
</p>
<p>the end of their useful lives back into the production process.
</p>
<p> The third source of imbalance is the unchecked growth of the human popula-
</p>
<p>tion. For most biological forms on Earth, at least one more life form exists&mdash;feeder, 
</p>
<p>predator, or parasite&mdash;that limits the former&rsquo;s population and keeps it in balance 
</p>
<p>with the rest of the living world. This food chain creates an energy pyramid that is 
</p>
<p>wide at its base, where plants directly tap solar energy, and that becomes narrower 
</p>
<p>toward the top, as it tapers from herbivores and to predators. There is one excep-
</p>
<p>tion: The human population at the apex of this biological food chain has grown 
</p>
<p>disproportionately larger than the rest of the pyramid, appropriating to itself 
</p>
<p>much of the Earth&rsquo;s livable habitat as well as its production of energy and biomass. 
</p>
<p>With no natural enemies to limit our population effectively, we have to discover 
</p>
<p>undermining abundance</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>270
</p>
<p>other means to do so. (Perhaps the global drop in sperm counts is nature&rsquo;s own 
</p>
<p>response?) Because the growth of the human population involves the fundamental 
</p>
<p>biological urge to reproduce one&rsquo;s kind, the issues are complex, and the debates 
</p>
<p>rage on. But solutions we must find.
</p>
<p> The fourth source of imbalance that threatens our world today is the unlim-
</p>
<p>ited corporate drive for profit. The business firm is programmed to maximize its 
</p>
<p>return on investment&mdash;no more, no less. This simplistic programming as a profit 
</p>
<p>seeker driven purely by self-interest has made it better adapted than the individ-
</p>
<p>ual human being to the world of markets, competition, and capital accumulation 
</p>
<p>that economists have defined the world to be. Being better adapted, corporations 
</p>
<p>have become the dominant economic player in our world. Because under our legal 
</p>
<p>systems corporations are legal persons distinct from their board of directors and 
</p>
<p>shareholders, corporations have now acquired a life of their own. They can feed 
</p>
<p>themselves, regenerate, reproduce, make plans in pursuit of their internal urges, 
</p>
<p>and hire people to execute these plans. Using their superior economic power, they 
</p>
<p>have also acquired political power and taken over media and education. They 
</p>
<p>have become so well entrenched and their accumulated economic, political, and 
</p>
<p>cultural powers have become so extensive that if they were counted as a distinct 
</p>
<p>species, they would now be considered the dominant species on this planet, hav-
</p>
<p>ing managed to domesticate the great Homo sapiens itself. As corporations relent-
</p>
<p>lessly pursue their internal programming, seeking profits without limit, they are 
</p>
<p>causing huge global imbalances that threaten the survival not only of human 
</p>
<p>societies, but of many other species, as well. Displacing these runaway automa-
</p>
<p>tons from their dominant status and reprogramming them with more benign goals 
</p>
<p>(Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s laws of robotics,33 for instance) has become the greatest challenge 
</p>
<p>of our era.
</p>
<p>reliability and the precautionary principle
</p>
<p>Corporations maximize their gain (profits) through efficiency and scale. Another 
</p>
<p>concept, however, could be more important than efficiency. This is the concept 
</p>
<p>of reliability, the quality of &ldquo;being available when needed,&rdquo; of &ldquo;lasting for a long 
</p>
<p>time.&rdquo; This common concept may further clarify how the two goals of social justice 
</p>
<p>and sustainability can be met.
</p>
<p> When abundance fails and becomes unavailable to some sectors of society or to 
</p>
<p>subsequent generations, this failure is a loss of reliability. Reliability is measured 
</p>
<p>in terms of mean time before failure (or mean time between failures). Improving 
</p>
<p>reliability means reducing the risk of failure. A more familiar formulation is the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;precautionary principle.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>verzola </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>271
</p>
<p> To prevent abundance from turning into scarcity, maximizing gain (efficiency) 
</p>
<p>should give way to minimizing risks (reliability) from threats to the sources of 
</p>
<p>abundance. This suggests a risk-averse strategy, which precisely is a strategy com-
</p>
<p>mon among ancient tribes and traditional societies. Perhaps, they have learned over 
</p>
<p>centuries that their goal was to preserve the natural abundance that sustained them 
</p>
<p>and to minimize any risk that may cause such abundance to end.34 Under condi-
</p>
<p>tions of abundance, the ideal economic agent is not the gain maximizer compet-
</p>
<p>ing out of self-interest and incidentally making markets efficient, but the risk 
</p>
<p>minimizer cooperating with others intentionally to make their common resources  
</p>
<p>more reliable.
</p>
<p> Often, a resource that a community considers optimally used because the risk 
</p>
<p>of failure has been minimized will appear underutilized to a corporation because 
</p>
<p>gain is not being maximized. This is probably the cause of resource conflicts in 
</p>
<p>many areas, especially where corporations intrude into community resources.
</p>
<p> To get optimum yield, gain maximizers keep increasing production toward the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;carrying capacity&rdquo; of the resource. However, imperfect knowledge, uncertainties, 
</p>
<p>and lags inherent in natural systems can lead to oscillatory behavior and over-
</p>
<p>shoots. Exceeding carrying capacity, even temporarily, can trigger a major mind-
</p>
<p>set shift that can lead to a race that ends up in a breakdown of the commons.
</p>
<p> Guided by the precautionary principle, risk minimizers focus not on carrying 
</p>
<p>capacity, but on the impact of extraction on the resource. Individuals evaluate the 
</p>
<p>negative impact as risk to their perpetual source of abundance&mdash;risk being the 
</p>
<p>probability of failure times the present value of their income stream that would 
</p>
<p>be lost&mdash;and weigh this against their own need. This self-regulating mechanism, 
</p>
<p>where individuals limit their gain as they minimize the risk of losing a perpetual 
</p>
<p>source of abundance, can keep the system in equilibrium. Even pure self-interest 
</p>
<p>should drive them to cooperate with others to make sure the rate of extraction 
</p>
<p>stays well below carrying capacity, which represents a nearly 100 percent risk of 
</p>
<p>failure. Should dire need push one to extract beyond acceptable risk, he or she will 
</p>
<p>have to contend with the wrath of others, whose perpetual income streams are 
</p>
<p>also being put at risk. Or perhaps everybody else will cooperatively chip in to help 
</p>
<p>meet a member&rsquo;s dire need, given their common interest to protect the resource 
</p>
<p>that gives each of them a perpetual income stream.
</p>
<p>abundance creates commons
</p>
<p>If we were to review history, and perhaps prehistory, as well, we would see that 
</p>
<p>abundance has often led to the creation of commons. In communities that respond 
</p>
<p>to abundance by treating it as a common pool resource, community members tend 
</p>
<p>undermining abundance</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>272
</p>
<p>to act cooperatively to manage the commons so that the goals of social justice and 
</p>
<p>sustainability are met and the risk of failure in abundance is minimized.
</p>
<p> Commons management involves not only economic rules, but also cultural and 
</p>
<p>political factors such as conscious community decisions, appeals to the common 
</p>
<p>good, and the values of sharing, cooperation, altruism, and community spirit. It 
</p>
<p>often relies not only on prices, but also on restrictions, prohibitions, and taboos. 
</p>
<p>Ancient tribes and other traditional societies have evolved complex social norms 
</p>
<p>of behavior and hierarchies of communal use and access rights that have served 
</p>
<p>them well in managing abundance and the commons for many generations. Similar 
</p>
<p>norms have likewise evolved among successful modern commons, such as free and 
</p>
<p>open-source software and Wikipedia.
</p>
<p> Their institutions and methods for governing the commons have proved even 
</p>
<p>more useful for threatened resources, as well as for resources that have actually 
</p>
<p>become scarce, by helping meet the goals of social justice and sustainability. In a 
</p>
<p>number of instances, fishing grounds and forest reserves have been nursed back to 
</p>
<p>abundance, thanks to the proper management of these commons.
</p>
<p> Thus, a rich heritage of theory and practice in managing abundance and coping 
</p>
<p>with scarcity exists and may be found in the literature of the commons. This heri-
</p>
<p>tage was overlooked for several decades by many after Garrett Hardin observed 
</p>
<p>in 1968 that a &ldquo;tragedy of the commons&rdquo; ensues when rational gain maximizers 
</p>
<p>exploit the commons in pure pursuit of self-interest.35 This has led governments to 
</p>
<p>take over these commons as state property or to turn them over to corporate inter-
</p>
<p>ests through privatization, often creating worse tragedies. What can be worse than 
</p>
<p>the tragedy that befell Russia when the common wealth of its people&mdash;literally the 
</p>
<p>product of their sweat, tears, and blood&mdash;became the private property overnight 
</p>
<p>of party bureaucrats turned capitalists? Subsequent studies have since shown that 
</p>
<p>Hardin&rsquo;s &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; is by no means universal and that successful practices in man-
</p>
<p>aging the commons continue to serve many communities today.36
</p>
<p> Hardin&rsquo;s analysis of herders and a common pasture was too simplistic. Hardin 
</p>
<p>argued that a rational herder would gain for himself one unit of the commons per 
</p>
<p>additional head of cattle herded, and split with other herders the unit of damage to 
</p>
<p>the pasture. He concluded that the positive net gain would drive every herder to 
</p>
<p>keep adding heads of cattle to the pasture until the commons collapsed. Hardin&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>risk-blind herder does not take into account the risk to his own perpetual income 
</p>
<p>stream created by each additional head of cattle he puts to pasture. A risk-wise 
</p>
<p>herder, weighing the gain from each additional head against the increasing risk of 
</p>
<p>losing his perpetual income stream, will stop adding heads before the probability 
</p>
<p>of losing that income stream reaches 100 percent, which occurs as carrying capac-
</p>
<p>ity is exceeded. Every herder will get a clear signal as the risk increases, because 
</p>
<p>verzola </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>273
</p>
<p>he will be getting less gain per unit effort as the pasture deteriorates. Here is a 
</p>
<p>self-regulating system that requires no unrealistic assumptions, such as perfect 
</p>
<p>knowledge or perfect competition.
</p>
<p> A foolhardy herder who needs the plus-one-unit gain badly enough may 
</p>
<p>still insist on risking not only his own, but also everyone else&rsquo;s perpetual income 
</p>
<p>stream. Since each one could, one day, face a similar situation of urgent need, they 
</p>
<p>may eventually realize that it would be better for each herder to contribute a small 
</p>
<p>amount to raise the increment. This suggests, as a long-term solution, a system 
</p>
<p>of insurance or social security, a type of commons that reduces individual risk by 
</p>
<p>pooling resources.
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>The following table shows how a focus on abundance creates a mind set that is 
</p>
<p>orthogonal to one that focuses on scarcity:

</p>
<p> The three major sectors of the economy&mdash;the agriculture, industrial, and infor-
</p>
<p>mation sectors&mdash;present us with a complex mix of markets and commons of scarce 
</p>
<p>and abundant goods. We need to tap into the vast pool of historical as well as cur-
</p>
<p>rent insight, knowledge, and experience to develop a modern theory of political 
</p>
<p>economy that can cope with both abundance and scarcity.

</p>
<p>A number of critical interventions in debates on the impact of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>on knowledge and culture are framed by a critique of the expansionist tendency of 
</p>
<p>the global intellectual property regime. There are calls for an institutional overhaul 
</p>
<p>of the intellectual property regime to make it more equitable and to enable greater 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge and culture. What seems to be missing in these debates in the 
</p>
<p>registers of development discourse or in the mandates of liberal reformist agendas 
</p>
<p>are epistemological challenges to intellectual property. The success of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property as a concept perhaps lies more in its ability to have established itself in a 
</p>
<p>universally intelligible narrative concerning what constitutes selfhood and owner-
</p>
<p>ship than in specific instances of its enforcement within countries. Ideas of prop-
</p>
<p>erty are centrally tied to larger ideas of personhood and hence are far too impor-
</p>
<p>tant to be left to policy makers.
</p>
<p> The globalization of intellectual property is hence as much about the creation 
</p>
<p>of a mind-set that sees all forms of creative activity as property as it is about uni-
</p>
<p>versal norms. It also articulates a particular idea of authorship tied closely to the 
</p>
<p>idea of an individual&rsquo;s relation to the world of knowledge and culture. This paper 
</p>
<p>argues that unless we understand the epistemological challenges posed by the idea 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property, we are left with limited corrective measures to a system 
</p>
<p>that threatens to destroy the diversity that marks our relation to the world of 
</p>
<p>ideas and consequently our relation to others and to ourselves.
</p>
<p> I will be examining the link between ideas of personhood and self that under-
</p>
<p>lies Western liberal property regimes. Philosophers such as John Locke played a 
</p>
<p>key role in creating a link between the &ldquo;self&rdquo; and &ldquo;ownership.&rdquo; This paper examines 
</p>
<p>alternative ideas of the self within Western and non-Western metaphysics and 
</p>
<p>argues that a relational conception of the self helps us rethink our assumptions 
</p>
<p>about property and personhood, especially in relation to the world of knowledge

</p>
<p>and culture. The political implications of such a shift are many and can be best 
</p>
<p>seen in the normative aspirations of the access to knowledge movement, which 
</p>
<p>attempts to destabilize the language of exclusive rights and property and to focus 
</p>
<p>on the ideas of responsibility and obligation as part of the ecology of knowledge.
</p>
<p> My account of the puzzle of property and personhood in relation to intellectual 
</p>
<p>property begins with what seems to be a standard copyright dispute. In 1999, three 
</p>
<p>members of the 1980s band Spandau Ballet sued Gary Kemp, the fourth member 
</p>
<p>of the band, for not sharing the royalties to the band&rsquo;s songs, which they claimed 
</p>
<p>they had jointly authored.1 Kemp claimed that he was the sole author of the songs 
</p>
<p>and that he was not obliged to pay them any share of the royalties. The aggrieved 
</p>
<p>members of the band argued that while Kemp presented the &ldquo;bare bones&rdquo; of a tune 
</p>
<p>to the other band members, the band went through a process of jamming, whereby 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;someone started to play and the rest joined in and improvised and improved the 
</p>
<p>original idea&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, that the creation of the songs was a collaborative 
</p>
<p>process and that the songs should be considered a work of joint authorship.2
</p>
<p> The court analyzed the manner in which music was created and, while acknowl-
</p>
<p>edging that there was a collaborative process that went into the composing of the 
</p>
<p>music, they held that it was Kemp who should be considered the sole creator of the 
</p>
<p>songs. They argued that Kemp &ldquo;developed, and fixed in his musical consciousness, 
</p>
<p>the melody, the chords, the rhythm or groove, and the general structure of [each] 
</p>
<p>song from beginning to end&rdquo; before playing it to the band and inviting the band as 
</p>
<p>a whole to rehearse its performance as an ensemble with a view to recording it. The 
</p>
<p>judge accepted that the other band members&rsquo; vocal and instrumental performances 
</p>
<p>were skilful individual interpretations of the musical works that Kemp had com-
</p>
<p>posed. However, he held that an interpretation of a musical work was not the kind 
</p>
<p>of contribution that the law of copyright could accept as sufficient to constitute 
</p>
<p>the interpreter an author of that work: &ldquo;the contributions need to be to the cre-
</p>
<p>ation of musical works, not to the performance or interpretation of them.&rdquo;3
</p>
<p> The Spandau Ballet case illustrates an interesting and in many ways typi-
</p>
<p>cal problem that copyright law faces in its adjudication of claims of authorship 
</p>
<p>and creativity. My interest in the case emerges from the ways in which the case 
</p>
<p>attempts to deal with the questions of collaboration, property, and personhood. In 
</p>
<p>the Spandau Ballet case, there seem to be three distinct kinds of claim made about 
</p>
<p>the relationships involved in these questions: Kemp&rsquo;s claim (affirmed by the court) 
</p>
<p>that the songs were written solely by him and hence are his own songs (a claim 
</p>
<p>based on the songs&rsquo; relationship to the self), the claim that as a result, Kemp owns 
</p>
<p>the songs exclusively (a claim based on his relationship to the work), and the claim 
</p>
<p>that as an owner, Kemp is entitled to exclude others from a share in the royalties 
</p>
<p>arising from the songs (a claim based on his relationship to others).

</p>
<p> At the heart of the problem, and of our understanding of the philosophical 
</p>
<p>divide that exists in debates on intellectual property, lies the issue of property 
</p>
<p>and personhood. The language of property narrates the individual as a proprietor 
</p>
<p>of one&rsquo;s own person, and it gives rise to a theory of personal identity in which the 
</p>
<p>self and what it owns are often treated as being the same, or at least as existing 
</p>
<p>within the same orbit of meaning, whereby the one can be used interchangeably 
</p>
<p>with the other. This discourse flows directly from classical liberal political theory, 
</p>
<p>in which every individual is considered to be the proprietor of his or her own 
</p>
<p>person.
</p>
<p>locke and the equation of self and ownership
</p>
<p>The philosopher who is most often identified with this theory of property and 
</p>
<p>the self is of course John Locke. Many of our ideas of selfhood emerged in the 
</p>
<p>seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and in many ways, the question of personal 
</p>
<p>identity was the prime question that motivated Locke&rsquo;s inquiries. His theories set 
</p>
<p>the stage for the philosophical and juridical establishment of what C. B. Macpher-
</p>
<p>son calls the theory of &ldquo;possessive individualism.&rdquo;4 The question of personal iden-
</p>
<p>tity troubled many philosophers before Locke, but it was with the publication 
</p>
<p>of Locke&rsquo;s Two Treatises of Government and An Essay Concerning Human Under-
</p>
<p>standing that the most coherent argument linking theories of identity to prop-
</p>
<p>erty emerged. It is interesting to note that Locke initially did not have a chapter 
</p>
<p>on consciousness and identity in the Essay, and it was at the suggestion of Wil-
</p>
<p>liam Molyneux that he included a section on the principium individuationis to the 
</p>
<p>second edition.
</p>
<p> Consider, for instance, the following statement in Locke&rsquo;s journals: &ldquo;Identity 
</p>
<p>of persons lies not in having the same numerical body made up of the same par-
</p>
<p>ticles, nor if the mind consists of corporeal spirits in their being the same. But in 
</p>
<p>the memory and knowledge of one&rsquo;s past self and actions continued on under the 
</p>
<p>consciousness of being the same person whereby every man own&rsquo;s himself.&rdquo;5 For 
</p>
<p>Locke, consciousness is a question of mental operations that appropriate the self 
</p>
<p>to itself, where to appropriate means to identify with or to make a property of. 
</p>
<p>The use of the word &ldquo;own&rdquo; is both as an adjective (as in &ldquo;my own thought&rdquo;) and 
</p>
<p>as a verb (to confess). The relationship between the self and the own is there-
</p>
<p>fore dependent on a circularity whereby ideas of identity and identification on 
</p>
<p>the one side and appropriation on the other continuously exchange their func-
</p>
<p>tion and become virtually equivalent. The relationship between the self and the 
</p>
<p>own is dependent on a self-fulfilling prophesy in which &ldquo;what I can consider as 
</p>
<p>me, myself, is my self and &lsquo;my&rsquo; self is some &lsquo;thing&rsquo; that I own, or that I must own </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> the man who mistook his wife for a book 281
</p>
<p>(confess) is mine, was done or thought by me, has become my own because I 
</p>
<p>appropriated it to me by doing it or thinking it consciously.&rdquo;6
</p>
<p> This circularity also informs much of Western metaphysics, in which conscious-
</p>
<p>ness sets the criteria of personal identity and of a political theory in which the 
</p>
<p>possessive individual is generalized or universalized because any individual ought 
</p>
<p>to be considered as proprietor of his or her own person or as a self-owning per-
</p>
<p>sonality to the extent that he or she is such a proprietor. In a fascinating rereading 
</p>
<p>of Locke, &Eacute;tienne Balibar, citing Jacques Derrida, claims that the reason for this 
</p>
<p>equivalence is the &ldquo;metaphysics of (a)propriation,&rdquo; in which linguistic expression 
</p>
<p>is provided by the circularity of meanings between &ldquo;my self&rdquo; and &ldquo;my own,&rdquo; or the 
</p>
<p>fact that you can explain self only by referring to what is your own and your own 
</p>
<p>only by referring to yourself. This is at the heart of European psychological, moral, 
</p>
<p>juridical, and political individualism and on the surface of it, it does seem that my 
</p>
<p>self and my own are one and the same thing.
</p>
<p> The circular relationship between the self and the own appears at first glance 
</p>
<p>to pose a problem of translatability. For instance, if you attempt to translate the 
</p>
<p>terms &ldquo;self&rdquo; and &ldquo;own&rdquo; into French, while &ldquo;self&rdquo; can more or less accurately be 
</p>
<p>translated as moi or soi, the closest French word for &ldquo;own&rdquo; is le propre or propre, 
</p>
<p>with its very close relation to property. The pair &ldquo;self&rdquo;/&rdquo;own&rdquo; and moi/propre, 
</p>
<p>however, cannot be considered as accurate equivalents. One could blame the inher-
</p>
<p>ently flawed project of translation, with the problem seen as being on a par with 
</p>
<p>other conceptual/linguistic problems that have plagued philosophers involving the 
</p>
<p>precise meaning of a word in different languages. However, Balibar sees it as a far 
</p>
<p>more serious problem. He wonders if it is the easy semantic coincidence available 
</p>
<p>in English that enables the easy linkage of the self and the own that allows for 
</p>
<p>Locke&rsquo;s theory of identity and property.
</p>
<p> To test Balibar&rsquo;s hypothesis, I attempted to look for an equivalent in Hindi 
</p>
<p>of the ideas of &ldquo;my self&rdquo; and &ldquo;my own.&rdquo; The closest translation that I could find 
</p>
<p>emerges from the phrase &ldquo;mere apne&rdquo; which is the equivalent of &ldquo;my own.&rdquo; The 
</p>
<p>word apna refers to the idea of owning, but not merely in terms of possession. 
</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;mere apne&rdquo; could refer to something as being mine, but at the same 
</p>
<p>time, this claim is not limited only to an assertion of delineation and exclusion, but 
</p>
<p>refers instead to a certain idea of relationship of proximity between the self and 
</p>
<p>an other. The word apnaapan, for instance, translates as &ldquo;closeness,&rdquo; so that &ldquo;mere 
</p>
<p>apne&rdquo; is a reference to the idea of a relational proximity.
</p>
<p> This is interestingly mirrored by Balibar&rsquo;s reading of &ldquo;By the Fireside,&rdquo; a poem 
</p>
<p>by Robert Browning:7
</p>
<p>My own, confirm me! If I tread
</p>
<p>This path back, is it not in pride</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>282
</p>
<p>To think how little I dreamed it led
</p>
<p>To an age so blest that, by its side,
</p>
<p>Youth seems the waste instead?
</p>
<p> Balibar initially reads the poem as being addressed to oneself, or as self-inter-
</p>
<p>pellation, and as an appeal to memory, but realizes his mistake when he encoun-
</p>
<p>ters the next lines and then a subsequent stanza:
</p>
<p>My own, see where the years conduct!
</p>
<p>At first, &rsquo;twas something our two souls
</p>
<p>Should mix as mists do. . . .
</p>
<p>My perfect wife, my Leonor,
</p>
<p>Oh heart, my own, oh eyes, mine too,
</p>
<p>Whom else could I dare look backward for,
</p>
<p>With whom beside should I dare pursue
</p>
<p>The path grey heads abhor?
</p>
<p> So what might be only a linguistic dilemma&mdash;is this an address to a self or an 
</p>
<p>address to an other?&mdash;leads us back to the foundational question of the nature of 
</p>
<p>self and subjectivity that is invoked when we speak of something being &ldquo;our own.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>The idea that &ldquo;my own&rdquo; could possibly refer not merely to a sovereign claim of the 
</p>
<p>individual self but also to relationality involving others conflicts with the world of 
</p>
<p>property norms in which a to say &ldquo;my own&rdquo; is an act that makes a claim of abso-
</p>
<p>lute possession, that declares the ability to exclude others, and that asserts the 
</p>
<p>legal ability to alienate what you own.8
</p>
<p>relational proximities and the reworking of the self
</p>
<p>Thinking of our relation to the world of knowledge and culture via the trope of 
</p>
<p>proximity enables us to rethink our relations to our work, to our selves, and to 
</p>
<p>each other, not as distinct sets of legal relations bound together by the idea of 
</p>
<p>rights, but as a continuum that blurs the boundaries between rights, obligations, 
</p>
<p>and relationalities. Consider, for instance, the following statements, each of which 
</p>
<p>refers to certain claims that sound deceptively similar, but that in fact exist in very 
</p>
<p>different ethical and legal registers.
</p>
<p>This is my pen.
</p>
<p>This is my friend.
</p>
<p>This is my poem.
</p>
<p> The first statement refers to the classical conception of the claims of pos-
</p>
<p>sessive individualism, in which the self and the owner exist as interchangeable 
</p>
<p>liang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>283
</p>
<p>concepts. This is &ldquo;my&rdquo; pen, and hence I own it. The second statement takes us into 
</p>
<p>the domain of relational proximities, where an assertion of someone being your 
</p>
<p>friend does not lead to an assumption, either of ownership or of exclusion, but 
</p>
<p>into the domain of the closeness/apnaapan that you share with your friend. Thus, 
</p>
<p>the statement &ldquo;This is my friend&rdquo; could well be mapped in terms of its presence in 
</p>
<p>Hindi as &ldquo;mere apne,&rdquo; with a sense of &ldquo;owning&rdquo; that leads to an understanding of 
</p>
<p>how close you are to someone.
</p>
<p> The third statement is perhaps the most deceptive, because to assert &ldquo;This is 
</p>
<p>my poem&rdquo; within the social imaginary of intellectual property is to make a claim 
</p>
<p>that sounds very much like &ldquo;This is my pen,&rdquo; whereas in fact, it might be more 
</p>
<p>accurate to think of its claim as the same as &ldquo;This is my friend.&rdquo; And it is in this 
</p>
<p>liminal space where poems look like pens that friendships get lost and property 
</p>
<p>takes over.
</p>
<p> What is it about the logic of property and the language of rights in the domain 
</p>
<p>of intangibles that creates this act of misrecognition? The ontological character of 
</p>
<p>information, knowledge, and cultural practices provide them with an unbounded-
</p>
<p>ness, and very much like the world of social relations, they are not exhausted by 
</p>
<p>acts of circulation. When was the last time we heard of the problem of someone 
</p>
<p>having too many friends? The imposition of strictly defined norms of property 
</p>
<p>rights, with its imagination of legitimate rights holders and trespassers, enforces a 
</p>
<p>transition that converts the possibilities of friendship into acts of hostile takings.9
</p>
<p> The role of intellectual property and the language of rights creates a normativ-
</p>
<p>ized and legalized domain in which our experience of social relations, with their 
</p>
<p>attendant complexities, is unavailable to us except as juridically defined sets of 
</p>
<p>relations. It would be useful at this stage for us to turn to our title character, who is 
</p>
<p>derived from one of Oliver Sacks&rsquo;s case studies, that of &ldquo;Dr. P,&rdquo; the man who mis-
</p>
<p>took his wife for a hat. Sacks informs us that Dr. P suffers from a peculiar neurolog-
</p>
<p>ical disorder that affects his ability to retain visual recognition while retaining this 
</p>
<p>ability to discern abstract figures, leading to a series of misrecognitions in which he 
</p>
<p>is unable to distinguish his foot from his shoe and his wife from a hat. Sacks writes:
</p>
<p>By and large, he recognized nobody: neither his family, nor his colleagues, nor his 
</p>
<p>pupil, nor himself. He recognised a portrait of Einstein because he picked up the 
</p>
<p>characteristic hair and moustache; and the same thing happened with one or two 
</p>
<p>other people. &lsquo;Ach, Paul!&rsquo; he said, when shown a portrait of his brother. &lsquo;That square 
</p>
<p>jaw, those big teeth, I would know Paul anywhere!&rsquo; But was it Paul he recognised, or 
</p>
<p>one or two of his features, on the basis of which he could make a reasonable guess 
</p>
<p>as to the subject&rsquo;s identity? In the absence of obvious &lsquo;markers&rsquo;, he was utterly 
</p>
<p>lost. But it was not merely the cognition, the gnosis, at fault; there was something 
</p>
<p>radically wrong with the whole way he proceeded. For he approached these faces&mdash;
</p>
<p> the man who mistook his wife for a book</p>

</p>
<p>even of those near and dear&mdash;as if they were abstract puzzles or tests: He did not 
</p>
<p>relate to them, he did not behold. No face was familiar to him, seen as a &lsquo;thou&rsquo;, 
</p>
<p>being just identified as a set of features, an &lsquo;it&rsquo;. Thus there was formal, but no trace 
</p>
<p>of personal, gnosis.10
</p>
<p>Dr. P provides us with a fascinating case study of how a neurological condition 
</p>
<p>may completely alter our abilities to see and to relate to the phenomenological 
</p>
<p>world. We can perhaps think of intellectual property rights as a similar affliction, 
</p>
<p>founded on very particularized ideas of property and personhood, but narrated 
</p>
<p>as universal truths, that prevents us from seeing our acts of reading, writing, cre-
</p>
<p>ating, sharing, and borrowing in terms of the relational world that they occupy. 
</p>
<p>Instead, we see them abstracted of their social relations.
</p>
<p> The equivalent of Dr. P in the world of ideas is Daniel Defoe, the great chroni-
</p>
<p>cler of piracy&rsquo;s golden era, who writes that &ldquo;A Book is the Author&rsquo;s Property, &rsquo;tis 
</p>
<p>the Child of his Inventions, the Brat of his Brain; if he sells his Property, it then 
</p>
<p>becomes the Right of the Purchaser; if not, &rsquo;tis as much his own, as his Wife and 
</p>
<p>Children are his own.&rdquo; Defoe was of course writing at a time when wife and children 
</p>
<p>could indeed be owned as property. But we now know better and understand that 
</p>
<p>you cannot own your wife or your child, but you can feel that they are your own.
</p>
<p> So here we have before us the case study of Daniel Defoe, the man who mis-
</p>
<p>took his wife for a book. His condition (unlike Dr. P&rsquo;s) is not an isolated malady, 
</p>
<p>and an increasingly large number of people are showing symptoms similar to 
</p>
<p>Defoe&rsquo;s, encouraged and enabled by the large institutional sponsors of the mal-
</p>
<p>ady such as the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a malady whose 
</p>
<p>contagion is ensured by instruments such as the TRIPS Agreement.
</p>
<p>different traditions of the self
</p>
<p>J. G. A. Pocock says that if property is both an extension of personality and a pre-
</p>
<p>requisite of it, then we should be aware of the possibility that different modes 
</p>
<p>of property may be seen as generally encouraging different modes of personal-
</p>
<p>ity.11 One way in which we can rethink the idea of our relationship to what we 
</p>
<p>create is not through terms of ownership, but through how close we are to it&mdash; 
</p>
<p>through proximity. Proximity to people and things creates a relationship of care 
</p>
<p>and responsibility, and when thought of in terms of things that we create, it allows 
</p>
<p>us to create a different ethical register through which we can examine the rela-
</p>
<p>tionship between property and personhood. For Locke and many other thinkers 
</p>
<p>within the Western metaphysical tradition, the idea of a distinct self serves as the 
</p>
<p>basis for a range of concerns, from self-identity, to moral agency, to property. This 
</p>
<p>liang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>285
</p>
<p>account of the self within the tradition of possessive individualism has been chal-
</p>
<p>lenged both within the Western tradition and by non-Western accounts of the self.
</p>
<p> Proximity may indeed be the basis on which alternative accounts of the self 
</p>
<p>may be forcefully articulated, because it is accompanied by a whole host of ethi-
</p>
<p>cal principles such as generosity and obligation that may help us order a differ-
</p>
<p>ent mode of dealing with what we &ldquo;own.&rdquo; Proximity or closeness is marked by a 
</p>
<p>relationship of care, and if we are to revisit the three modes of relationality that 
</p>
<p>I invoked in the Spandau Ballet case, we see that proximity reworks the way we 
</p>
<p>see the three relations: the relation to the self (to be an author is not just to own 
</p>
<p>a work, but to own up to the work), the relation to the work (taking care of what 
</p>
<p>you own, or the duty of care that emerges from proximity), and the relation to 
</p>
<p>others (a relation predicated on an ethical bond).
</p>
<p> The opposite of an ethic of care and proximity is the violence and brutality 
</p>
<p>that motivated Daniel Defoe to mistake his wife for a book. One consequence of 
</p>
<p>the idea of a relational self is that it does not make sense to speak of an essential 
</p>
<p>core that is the basis of a sense of unified self and self-identity. Let us consider 
</p>
<p>two challenges to the idea of the unified self that informs Western metaphysics. 
</p>
<p>The first challenge emerges from the contrast between the idea of the self in West-
</p>
<p>ern philosophy and its absence in the non-Western tradition, while the second 
</p>
<p>challenge emerges from the Western philosophical tradition itself.
</p>
<p> S. N. Balagangadhara, a philosopher whose work focuses on Indian traditions, 
</p>
<p>argues that the basic idea of the self in Western cultures consists of a sense of &ldquo;an 
</p>
<p>inner core which is separable and different from everything else. In such a culture, 
</p>
<p>when one speaks of &lsquo;finding oneself&rsquo; one means that one should look inside oneself, 
</p>
<p>get in touch with an inner self that is there inside oneself, and peel everything away 
</p>
<p>that surrounds this core. To such a self, even its own actions can appear strange.&rdquo;12
</p>
<p> Furthermore, Western culture allows each of us a self&mdash;a self waiting to be dis-
</p>
<p>covered within each one of us, something that can grow and actualize itself, that 
</p>
<p>either realizes its true potential or fails to do so. Such a versatile self has various 
</p>
<p>properties. One of them is its reflexivity: The self is aware of itself as a self, or it 
</p>
<p>has self-consciousness. Consequently, human beings who are endowed with such 
</p>
<p>selves are all self-conscious beings. As we know, most philosophers are agreed that 
</p>
<p>self-consciousness typifies the uniqueness of human beings, and that this self-
</p>
<p>consciousness distinguishes humans from the rest of nature.
</p>
<p> Balagangadhara contrasts the idea of the self in non-Western cultures with 
</p>
<p>that of the West by using an interesting example. He says that if you were to look 
</p>
<p>at the different ways in which a culture talks about persons, you would often find 
</p>
<p>that in Western cultures, in answer to a question such as &ldquo;What kind of a person 
</p>
<p>is he?&rdquo; you would find straightforward answers such as &ldquo;He is a friendly person.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> the man who mistook his wife for a book</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>286
</p>
<p>However, the same question can elicit a different response in a non-Western cul-
</p>
<p>ture, such as &ldquo;He comes home every week to enquire after my health.&rdquo; According 
</p>
<p>to Balagangadhara, while this initially seems like a wrong answer or an indirect 
</p>
<p>answer, answers of this kind are very typical in a country such as India. He says 
</p>
<p>that by reading these answers as in fact direct answers, we can see the answer 
</p>
<p>asserting an identity relation between actions and persons. That is, Indian culture 
</p>
<p>does not draw a distinction between an agent who performs an action and the 
</p>
<p>action that the agent performs. An agent is constituted by the actions that a he or 
</p>
<p>she performs, or an agent is the actions performed and nothing more.
</p>
<p> Thus for Balagangadhara, the self of a person is nothing other than the actions 
</p>
<p>that the person performs. But these actions do not exist in isolation and are depen-
</p>
<p>dent in turn on how another person construes them: Person Y constructs person 
</p>
<p>X&rsquo;s self, just as person X constructs person Y&rsquo;s self. Person Y is crucial for the con-
</p>
<p>struction of X&rsquo;s self, because in the absence of Y, the actions that X performs are 
</p>
<p>meaningless. That is, Y is required so that X&rsquo;s actions may be seen as some specific 
</p>
<p>type of action. If we were to restrict ourselves to X in order to talk about his or her 
</p>
<p>self so as to contrast this notion with that of the West, we could say that the West-
</p>
<p>ern self consists of a bundle of meaningless actions. Because of this, the self of X 
</p>
<p>depends upon continuously being recognized as such by Y. According to Balag-
</p>
<p>angadhara, there is nothing unusual about this, and it gestures toward the fact that 
</p>
<p>we are all relational selves, and you are only a son, a daughter, a father, a friend, 
</p>
<p>and so on to the extent you are so recognized. And you can be thus recognized 
</p>
<p>only when you perform those actions that are appropriate to the station of a son, a 
</p>
<p>daughter, a father, a friend, and so on.13
</p>
<p> Let us now turn to another attempt at characterizing this idea of relationality 
</p>
<p>or proximity, this time within more contemporary Western philosophy. Emmanuel 
</p>
<p>Levinas is one of the key thinkers working with the idea of proximity or &ldquo;being 
</p>
<p>with&rdquo; within the Western philosophical tradition, and his work has inspired a 
</p>
<p>range of ethical philosophers as well as legal scholars to think through questions 
</p>
<p>of the obligations that we may have to others. For Levinas, proximity implies a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;closeness to others who can be approached but never reached. We are never 
</p>
<p>exactly the same as another person, and in the trauma of that distance lies sum-
</p>
<p>moned our soul&rdquo; and likewise our sense of responsibility.14 It is clear that unlike 
</p>
<p>the non-Western idea of relationality that arises from a close sense of relation-
</p>
<p>ships, Levinas has a more expanded idea of relating. For him, &ldquo;The relationship 
</p>
<p>of proximity cannot be reduced to any modality of distance or geometrical con-
</p>
<p>tiguity, nor to the simple &lsquo;representation&rsquo; of a neighbor; it is already an assigna-
</p>
<p>tion, an extremely urgent assignation&mdash;an obligation, anachronously prior to 
</p>
<p>any commitment.&rdquo;15 For Levinas, the ability to be in a proximate relationship 
</p>
<p>liang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>287
</p>
<p>is what &ldquo;intimates&rdquo; an other, and this intimation forms the essence of who 
</p>
<p>we are and why we have a responsibility to others. Levinas also sees proxim-
</p>
<p>ity as a complete experience that in many ways exceeds our theories and ideas  
</p>
<p>of the world.
</p>
<p> The similarities between the idea of the relational self in non-Western thought 
</p>
<p>and proximity in Levinas&rsquo;s work is striking. Levinas is impressively nonchalant 
</p>
<p>about other pressing concerns in Western metaphysics, including intentionality or 
</p>
<p>the existence of an essential self that defines our being. He is instead more con-
</p>
<p>cerned with the domain of experience and how we act responsibly. The ability to 
</p>
<p>act responsibly is in turn dependent on the ability to respond adequately, and the 
</p>
<p>instantiation of a response dilutes any unified sense of self, since neither the self 
</p>
<p>nor intentionality makes any sense outside of its relation to another. I&rsquo;m already 
</p>
<p>obligated and called before any decision on my part. Therefore, there is no point in 
</p>
<p>asking whether or not my act(ion) of responsibility is free or voluntary. If respon-
</p>
<p>sibility is prior to freedom, neither chosen nor not chosen, it is out of the question 
</p>
<p>to ask under what circumstances I am responsible.
</p>
<p>revisiting locke
</p>
<p>While it is tempting to contrast the idea of the relational self with the Lockean idea 
</p>
<p>of the autonomous individual, the task turns out to be difficult. If we consider, for 
</p>
<p>instance, Locke&rsquo;s theory of relations, there are certain productive contradictions 
</p>
<p>that emerge. Objects, according to Locke, are related to each other by the mind. He 
</p>
<p>argues that there may be certain properties, for instance that of being white, that 
</p>
<p>may not be a relational fact. But when we think of a relational idea, Locke sug-
</p>
<p>gests, that is, when we think of someone as a husband or as whiter than someone 
</p>
<p>else, the mind is actually going beyond the particular to some other person or per-
</p>
<p>sons distinct from the self, and a relation is the result of this activity of the mind, 
</p>
<p>which has simultaneously considered and compared two distinct things.
</p>
<p> For Locke, some relational terms such as &ldquo;father and son,&rdquo; &ldquo;lesser and bigger,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>and &ldquo;cause and effect&rdquo; are self-evident and can exist only together and explain 
</p>
<p>each other. These correlative pairs &ldquo;reciprocally intimate&rdquo; each other, but it is not 
</p>
<p>exactly clear whether there is a common reciprocal relational tie connecting these 
</p>
<p>correlative pairs, a common relation that each member of the pair has toward the 
</p>
<p>other that makes this correlation possible. This limitation seems to emerge from 
</p>
<p>the fact that Locke sees the ability of naming and identifying relations as emerg-
</p>
<p>ing solely from the mind. In other words, the ontological status of relations seems 
</p>
<p>unequivocally mind-dependent for Locke. The question that then logically arises 
</p>
<p>is, how does the mind create a set of relationships to itself?

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>288
</p>
<p> It is perhaps useful at this stage to return to the site of our original problem: 
</p>
<p>the equation of self and owner that emerges in Locke&rsquo;s theory of property and 
</p>
<p>personhood. We began by locating the conceptual problem within a specific lin-
</p>
<p>guistic dilemma: the manner in which English produces a reciprocal duality of the 
</p>
<p>self, a self who is owning and a self who is owned. Balibar says that while it could 
</p>
<p>be argued that this linguistic dilemma could be dismissed as a performative contra-
</p>
<p>diction, it would be more useful to look at the productive nature of this contradic-
</p>
<p>tion and the manner in which it resolves the contradiction in Locke by introducing 
</p>
<p>another element&mdash;that of uneasiness.
</p>
<p> Balibar argues that for Locke, the process of identification or self-interpellation 
</p>
<p>(I address myself) or the performative contradiction is already taken into account. 
</p>
<p>For instance, in his segment on consciousness, Locke argues that there is no con-
</p>
<p>sciousness that is not associated with desire and at the same time troubled and 
</p>
<p>pushed by it toward ever new contents or ideas, so that the notion of conscious-
</p>
<p>ness as a fixed or stable identity is a contradiction in terms. Consciousness is by its 
</p>
<p>nature restless. It must escape itself toward new contents, and its identity is asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with a perpetual flow, escape, or train of ideas. The category that names this 
</p>
<p>intrinsic association of consciousness is &ldquo;uneasiness.&rdquo; Balibar argues that in light 
</p>
<p>of this, we may return to Locke&rsquo;s identification of the self and owning and what it 
</p>
<p>means to understand them as being exactly the same thing. He says that what is 
</p>
<p>owned by me inasmuch as I own it (speaking, thoughts, actions) is the uneasiness 
</p>
<p>of this relation and the fact that the identity or sameness of the self and its own 
</p>
<p>does indeed exist, but only as an uneasy one.16
</p>
<p> He argues, by returning to his reading of Browning&rsquo;s poem, that the critical 
</p>
<p>element causing the uneasy appropriation of identity is the element of sexual dif-
</p>
<p>ference. It is the other with whom I make one and the same precisely because 
</p>
<p>we can never become wholly identified, indistinguishable, with whom I experi-
</p>
<p>ence the uneasy relation of identity and difference, not only because it is conflic-
</p>
<p>tual. but because the identification of what is shared or what is the same and of 
</p>
<p>what is separated or different can never be established in a clear-cut and stable 
</p>
<p>manner: We &ldquo;should mix as mists do.&rdquo; The name of this uneasy experience con-
</p>
<p>ventionally is &ldquo;love.&rdquo; But we know that love is anything but a simple thing, per-
</p>
<p>haps because in love, there is precisely so much consciousness associated with  
</p>
<p>so much desire.
</p>
<p> The implications of this line of thought are immense for a rethinking of the 
</p>
<p>idea of knowledge creation in terms of proximity. If my own work can exist only in 
</p>
<p>a certain relationship with others, then can I ever claim what is my own in a man-
</p>
<p>ner that seeks to exclude any claims that others may have?

</p>
<p>returning to the intellectual property debate
</p>
<p>Let us now return to the domain that motivated this brief enquiry. The global 
</p>
<p>acceleration of intellectual property norms in recent times is critically linked to 
</p>
<p>a new articulation of our relationship to our selves, our work, and to others. The 
</p>
<p>response that is required cannot be limited within the terms of political realism, 
</p>
<p>whether of the left or the right. And the real potential of new modes of knowledge 
</p>
<p>production and sharing (free software, open access) stem not from their status as 
</p>
<p>solutions to the problem of the knowledge or information deficit alone, but from 
</p>
<p>their rearticulation of alternative relationalities that do not generate untroubled 
</p>
<p>and easy cohesive accounts of the self and its own. They instead offer us an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to think about the ways in which acts of sharing create new forms of inti-
</p>
<p>macies and of relating to each other. The global access to knowledge movement 
</p>
<p>currently is as much premised on the language of rights and equity as it is depen-
</p>
<p>dent on acts of generosity and giving. In an era when the language of theft, mis-
</p>
<p>trust, and panic marks our relation with the world, it is all the more important to 
</p>
<p>recall the ethical basis of our relationships with each other and with the world.
</p>
<p> Our global contemporary era is marked by all kinds of turbulences that momen-
</p>
<p>tarily dislodge our stable notions of the nation, identity, property, stability, friend 
</p>
<p>and enemy, self and other. The experience of turbulence in an airplane induces the 
</p>
<p>stranger next to you momentarily to become your most intimate human contact, 
</p>
<p>while the uncertainty of the moment causes you to reach out to an unfamiliar, 
</p>
<p>but reassuring hand. Only later does the uneasy recognition occur of a compact 
</p>
<p>of unfamiliarity having been breached. Our abilities to communicate and to share 
</p>
<p>ideas in ways that were hitherto unthought of provides us with an opportunity 
</p>
<p>to rework our accounts of ourselves and the possible horizons of the relations we 
</p>
<p>inhabit. Michel Foucault asks:
</p>
<p>what would be the value of the passion for knowledge if it resulted only in a certain 
</p>
<p>amount of knowledgeableness and not, in one way or another and to the extent pos-
</p>
<p>sible, in the knower&rsquo;s straying afield of himself? There are times in life when the ques-
</p>
<p>tion of knowing if one can think differently than one thinks, and perceive differently 
</p>
<p>than one sees, is absolutely necessary if one is to go on looking and reflecting at all.17
</p>
<p>Seen in this light, what is narrated as transgressions in the world of ideas reap-
</p>
<p>pear as explorations and reinventions of the self, a curiosity about the other and 
</p>
<p>perhaps a way of looking for your wife in what appears to be a hat or a book. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hospitality,&rdquo; &ldquo;gratitude,&rdquo; &ldquo;friendship,&rdquo; &ldquo;caring,&rdquo; &ldquo;owning&rdquo;&mdash;these almost sound 
</p>
<p>like archaic words from a distant time in a period when juridical relations replace 
</p>
<p>social relations and contracts of adhesion are more powerful than word of mouth. 
</p>
<p>If gratitude is the moral memory of mankind, as Georg Simmel claimed,18 then it is 
</p>
<p> the man who mistook his wife for a book</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>290
</p>
<p>perhaps time to refresh our memory dulled by the ubiquity of property and con-
</p>
<p>tracts. And frankly, it does not matter where these mnemonic tools emerge from, 
</p>
<p>either temporally or spatially. If our sense of self has been narrowed by its lin-
</p>
<p>guistic affinity with the need to own, let&rsquo;s start exploring other semantic worlds 
</p>
<p>where we can multiply and expand the idea of the self. Here are some with which 
</p>
<p>to begin.
</p>
<p> The etymology of &ldquo;data&rdquo; comes from the Latin datum, which means a thing 
</p>
<p>that is given, the neuter of which is &ldquo;to give.&rdquo; Similarly, the word daata in Hindi/
</p>
<p>Sanskrit is taken to mean &ldquo;the giver,&rdquo; which suggests that we must always be gen-
</p>
<p>erous with information and make gifts of our code, images, and ideas. To be stingy 
</p>
<p>with data is to violate an instance of the secret and sacred compacts of homo-
</p>
<p>phonic words from different cultural/spatial orbits (daata in Hindi and &ldquo;data&rdquo; in 
</p>
<p>English) as they meet in the liminal zone between languages, in the thicket of the 
</p>
<p>sound of quotidian slips of the tongue.
</p>
<p> Another entry point is provided by the common root words that bind the words 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;owe&rdquo; and &ldquo;own,&rdquo; so if intellectual property is about thinking of ways of owning 
</p>
<p>the future, perhaps we need to start thinking not only about how we own, but also 
</p>
<p>how we owe the future. The point is not to take these systems of administering the 
</p>
<p>world of knowledge and ideas as a given, but to think about the ways in which they 
</p>
<p>enable us to work out our relation with ourselves. As Patricia Williams reminds us, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The task . . . is not to discard rights, but to see through or past them so that they 
</p>
<p>reflect a larger definition of privacy and property: so that privacy is turned from 
</p>
<p>exclusion based on self-regard into regard for another&rsquo;s fragile, mysterious auton-
</p>
<p>omy; and so that property retains its ancient connotation of being a reflection of 
</p>
<p>that part of the universal self. The task is to expand private property rights into a 
</p>
<p>conception of civil rights, into the right to expect civility from others.&rdquo;19
</p>
<p> I end this piece with a small parable that many of us will have read while we 
</p>
<p>were children. The story is from Antoine de Saint Exup&eacute;ry&rsquo;s tale The Little Prince. 
</p>
<p>The Little Prince visits a number of planets and encounters a range of different 
</p>
<p>characters. On the fourth planet, he meets a businessman who owns millions of 
</p>
<p>stars, and the reason why he owns them is because he was the first one to think 
</p>
<p>of owning the stars. The Little Prince is perplexed, because he can&rsquo;t seem to find 
</p>
<p>a reason for owning the stars beyond the fact that they can be put in a bank to 
</p>
<p>enable the businessman to buy more stars. The Little Prince tells the business-
</p>
<p>man that &ldquo;I own a flower myself, which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, 
</p>
<p>which I rake out every week. I even rake out the extinct one. You never know. So 
</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s of some use to my volcanoes, and it&rsquo;s useful to my flower, that I own them. But 
</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not useful to the stars.&rdquo;20

<p>Free-Trade	Agreements	and	Neoliberalism:		
</p>
<p>How	to	Derail	the	Political	Rationales	that	Impose	
</p>
<p>Strong	Intellectual	Property	Protection
</p>
<p>Ga&euml;lle Krikorian
</p>
<p>Free-trade agreements are at the forefront of efforts to increase intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty protection. Their chapters on intellectual property regularly enforce intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property owners&rsquo; most restrictive limitations and have become one of the 
</p>
<p>most efficient ways in which developed countries are able to increase intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property protection in the developing world. They also exemplify the kind 
</p>
<p>of relations that predominate between the rich countries and the Global South: 
</p>
<p>the imposition of an apparatus of legal administrative rules that mostly favors the 
</p>
<p>rich countries. The intervention of trade negotiators allows intellectual property 
</p>
<p>exporters to maintain control over the sources of economic accumulation&mdash;infor-
</p>
<p>mation and knowledge&mdash;and to prevent their appropriation by others. During the 
</p>
<p>era of colonization and under both the mercantile and industrial economies, devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries were considered mainly to be sources of raw materials.1 In the 
</p>
<p>knowledge economy of the information society, it is now the populations of devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries that are exploited&mdash;relegated to the status of a workforce and, 
</p>
<p>when they can afford it, a source of simple consumers, but commonly excluded 
</p>
<p>from access to knowledge.
</p>
<p> During the colonial era, a number of developing countries under colonization 
</p>
<p>had to adopt legislation on intellectual property similar to those of the coloniz-
</p>
<p>ing country.2 After decolonization, however, many developing countries reviewed 
</p>
<p>and modified their laws in order to introduce more flexibilities and implement 
</p>
<p>standards more favorable to their development and to the fostering of their local 
</p>
<p>industries. The result was a nascent resistance in developing countries to the 
</p>
<p>imposition of stronger and what they considered to be unbalanced intellectual  
</p>
<p>property regimes.
</p>
<p> Indian policy makers, for example, drafted and passed a new patent law in 1970 
</p>
<p>allowing patents on processes used to fabricate pharmaceutical products, but not </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>krikorian 294
</p>
<p>on the products themselves, which made it possible for local industries to manu-
</p>
<p>facture and market any existing drug as long as they could establish their own pro-
</p>
<p>duction process. Many other countries, such as Argentina or Mexico, also modified 
</p>
<p>their legislation to limit the scope of patentability after decolonization. A study 
</p>
<p>conducted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1988 showed 
</p>
<p>that forty-nine countries among the ninety-eight states that were then signatories 
</p>
<p>of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property excluded phar-
</p>
<p>maceutical products from protection.3
</p>
<p> In the 1960s, developing countries had organized to revise the Berne Conven-
</p>
<p>tion for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Work, originally signed in 1886, so 
</p>
<p>that it would take into account their educational needs and favor their economic 
</p>
<p>and industrial-development goals and technology transfers from developed coun-
</p>
<p>tries.4 Countries such as India, Brazil, and Korea developed an offensive position 
</p>
<p>from the 1960s to the 1980s, leading developing countries to mobilize against the 
</p>
<p>increasing protection of intellectual property, both in international arenas and in 
</p>
<p>their own national policies and laws.
</p>
<p> During an attempt to revise the Paris Convention in the 1980s,5 when the 
</p>
<p>United States tried to obtain higher standards of protection, developing countries 
</p>
<p>acting as a bloc mobilized to lower them. They formalized the G-77, which was 
</p>
<p>established in 1964 by seventy-seven developing countries at the end of the first 
</p>
<p>session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva, 
</p>
<p>and some of them maintained a firm position through the Uruguay Round negotia-
</p>
<p>tions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), notably against the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of an agreement on intellectual property, and later in favor of retain-
</p>
<p>ing flexible compulsory licensing provisions in the agreement.6 However, in the 
</p>
<p>end, there was no revision of the Berne Convention, and in 1994, the Trade-Related 
</p>
<p>Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (the TRIPS Agreement) was 
</p>
<p>finally adopted by 128 countries, including many developing countries, ultimately 
</p>
<p>strengthening intellectual property rights for all the members of the newly created 
</p>
<p>World Trade Organization (WTO).
</p>
<p> The promulgation of that agreement is one indication that the movement 
</p>
<p>undertaken by the developing countries in opposition to increasing intellectual 
</p>
<p>property protection was facing a powerful counterforce promoting stronger pro-
</p>
<p>tection of intellectual property, which soon became dominant. A neoliberal &ldquo;revo-
</p>
<p>lution,&rdquo; as David Harvey characterizes it,7 reshaped the priorities of world leaders 
</p>
<p>and imposed neoliberalism as the way forward for the world. It is in this context 
</p>
<p>that, despite the free-market rhetoric that accompanied them and contrary to their 
</p>
<p>very name, free-trade agreements started to be employed as a way to increase 
</p>
<p>restrictions on intellectual property.</p>

<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism 295
</p>
<p> This essay analyzes the political logic in which the increase of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property protections through the negotiation of free-trade agreements is embed-
</p>
<p>ded. Neoliberalism can be seen as many different things, among them, as a way 
</p>
<p>to think about power and to regulate behaviors, as an ideology offering people a 
</p>
<p>fiction that appears coherent, and as a set of public policies adopted and imple-
</p>
<p>mented under the effective collective action of the ruling class. Without trying 
</p>
<p>to reconcile the existing interpretative frameworks of neoliberalism, what follows 
</p>
<p>will consider some of the characteristics of this political regime, assess its strength 
</p>
<p>and weaknesses, and consider the strategies and tactics that a mobilization such 
</p>
<p>as the A2K movement can take to overthrow its dominant logic and to counter its 
</p>
<p>actions in the global field of intellectual property protection.
</p>
<p>the logic of the u.s. free-trade agreements
</p>
<p>Many of the world&rsquo;s countries, whether or not they are members of the WTO, have 
</p>
<p>levels of intellectual property protection in their national laws that are much more 
</p>
<p>elevated than what is required by the TRIPS Agreement. One may wonder why, 
</p>
<p>since few countries routinely export intellectual property goods and thus few ben-
</p>
<p>efit directly from these legislations.
</p>
<p> Intellectual property owners, whether private companies or the governments 
</p>
<p>that support them, have developed strategies to increase intellectual property 
</p>
<p>standards globally. As a result, after the adoption of the TRIPS Agreement in 1994, 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protection expanded considerably around the world while 
</p>
<p>intellectual property owners&rsquo; rights were extended in different directions.
</p>
<p> The United States has played and still is playing a leading role in this process, 
</p>
<p>and the free-trade agreements that it is promoting are key elements of a step-
</p>
<p>by-step strategy. Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite have described the &ldquo;forum-
</p>
<p>shifting&rdquo; tactic in which the intellectual property movement shifts from one forum 
</p>
<p>of negotiations to another where it is more likely to succeed, from bilateral talks 
</p>
<p>to the WTO, from the WTO to WIPO, and so on.8 Hence, it is possible to follow 
</p>
<p>the history of the increase in the standards of intellectual property protection by 
</p>
<p>monitoring U.S. intellectual property demands in free-trade negotiations over time 
</p>
<p>in different international and bilateral or regional forums.9
</p>
<p> Within this system, free-trade agreements represent a parallel venue to the 
</p>
<p>multilateral arena that has been repeatedly used by the United States trade rep-
</p>
<p>resentative, for they offer several advantages over the multilateral negotiations, 
</p>
<p>including the fact that they deal with powers that are unequal economically and 
</p>
<p>politically in ways that are advantageous to the United States. Before the adop-
</p>
<p>tion of the TRIPS Agreement, the United States exploited bilateral negotiations </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>296
</p>
<p>to facilitate acquiescence to TRIPS&mdash;once countries had accepted provisions simi-
</p>
<p>lar to those proposed within TRIPS, they were less likely to oppose multilateral 
</p>
<p>U.S. demands and might even support them during international discussions. 
</p>
<p>After TRIPS was signed, the United States used bilateral agreements to develop  
</p>
<p>higher standards.10
</p>
<p> The tactic of using various forums for negotiations rested on the develop-
</p>
<p>ment of legal instruments providing the U.S. negotiators with tools to facilitate 
</p>
<p>the action of the U.S. trade representative and to influence its trade partners. This 
</p>
<p>tactic also hinged on threatening countries with commercial retaliation or using 
</p>
<p>economic benefits as an incentive to impose stronger intellectual property protec-
</p>
<p>tions, a carrot-and-stick approach that started in the early 1980s. The Caribbean 
</p>
<p>Basin Economic Recovery Act signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 is one of 
</p>
<p>the earliest examples of this. It stated that a Caribbean country &ldquo;would be given 
</p>
<p>duty-free privileges for their goods in the US market if they met certain criteria&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>and would not if they &ldquo;had taken steps in relation to intellectual property that 
</p>
<p>amounted to the nationalization or expropriation of that property.&rdquo;11 The economic 
</p>
<p>interests at stake were not significant, but movie copyright owners had succeeded 
</p>
<p>in convincing Reagan that trade and intellectual property could and should, in 
</p>
<p>some cases, be linked.
</p>
<p> In 1984, similar language was reused in an amendment of the Trade Act of 1974.12 
</p>
<p>The Trade and Tariff Act linked trade and intellectual property and authorized the 
</p>
<p>withdrawal of trade benefits from a country or the imposition of duties to goods 
</p>
<p>exported to the United States if a U.S. trade representative deemed the country 
</p>
<p>insufficiently protective of U.S. intellectual property assets. In 1988, a new amend-
</p>
<p>ment led to what is known as the &ldquo;Special 301&rdquo; provision, which requires the U.S. 
</p>
<p>trade representative to identify &ldquo;foreign countries that deny adequate and effec-
</p>
<p>tive protection of intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access 
</p>
<p>for U.S. persons that rely on intellectual property protection.&rdquo;13 Depending on the 
</p>
<p>level of dissatisfaction of the U.S. trade representative and based on U.S. stake-
</p>
<p>holders reports, the countries are placed on a &ldquo;Watch List,&rdquo; on a &ldquo;Priority Watch 
</p>
<p>List,&rdquo; which entails greater scrutiny, or on a &ldquo;Priority Foreign Countries&rdquo; list, 
</p>
<p>reserved for the worst cases, where countries can be subjected to a Section 301 
</p>
<p>investigation and face the threat of trade sanctions, including through the General-
</p>
<p>ized System of Preferences and the &ldquo;Section 306 Monitoring&rdquo; list.14 Over time, the 
</p>
<p>objectives of the U.S. negotiations concerning intellectual property became more 
</p>
<p>explicitly described in the law. The Trade Act of 2002 (H.R. 3009), in outlining the 
</p>
<p>U.S. trade representative&rsquo;s goals, states that &ldquo;the principal negotiating objectives 
</p>
<p>of the United States regarding trade-related intellectual property are . . . to further 
</p>
<p>promote adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, including 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>297
</p>
<p>through . . . ensuring that the provisions of any multilateral or bilateral trade agree-
</p>
<p>ment governing intellectual property rights that is entered into by the United States 
</p>
<p>reflect a standard of protection similar to that found in United States law.&rdquo;15
</p>
<p> We can distinguish several periods of bilateral trade negotiations over the last 
</p>
<p>few decades of U.S. history. The first one began in the 1980s. As developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries levied escalating criticism against international intellectual property conven-
</p>
<p>tions, the United States faced mounting resistance in multilateral forums such as 
</p>
<p>WIPO and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. These con-
</p>
<p>straints, as well as the emergence of a new strategy developed by industry, led the 
</p>
<p>U.S. government to press for the integration of intellectual property rights into the 
</p>
<p>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Uruguay Round negotia-
</p>
<p>tions that ended with the creation of the WTO.
</p>
<p> Starting in the mid-1980s, a number of bilateral agreements on intellectual 
</p>
<p>property were signed,16 compelling partner countries to accept intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights standards similar to those outlined in the TRIPS Agreement. In the 
</p>
<p>meantime, bilateral investment treaties requiring &ldquo;adequate and effective&rdquo; intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights were signed. In November 1983, President Reagan and 
</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Shamir launched the negotiations of a U.S.-Israeli free-trade 
</p>
<p>agreement, including provisions on intellectual property. This agreement con-
</p>
<p>cluded in February 1985 was a first for the United States, in terms of both scale and 
</p>
<p>content.17 A few years later, in 1990, the negotiations of the North American Free 
</p>
<p>Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada started. Con-
</p>
<p>cluded in August 1992, it became a landmark for future U.S. negotiations and a 
</p>
<p>baseline for intellectual property demands. This period, which saw the emergence 
</p>
<p>of a new U.S. policy articulating a relationship between intellectual property and 
</p>
<p>trade, ended with the successful ratification of the TRIPS Agreement in 1994.
</p>
<p> Developing countries expected that once the United States had achieved its 
</p>
<p>objectives at the WTO, the pressure would fade, but the post-TRIPS era did not 
</p>
<p>bring a slowdown of U.S. bilateral activity or a diminution of its demands. Talks for 
</p>
<p>a Free Trade Area of the Americas involving thirty-four countries began in Decem-
</p>
<p>ber 1994. Bilateral negotiations with Vietnam, Laos, Singapore, Jordan, and Chile 
</p>
<p>started toward the end of the 1990s and at the dawn of the new millennium. In 2002, 
</p>
<p>the Trade Act restored the fast-track authority of the president to negotiate inter-
</p>
<p>national trade agreements,18 which had expired in 1994, sparking intense negotia-
</p>
<p>tions with Central American countries (the Central American Free Trade Agreement, 
</p>
<p>including the Dominican Republic), with Morocco and Australia, with the countries 
</p>
<p>of the Southern African Customs Union,19 with Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab 
</p>
<p>Emirates, and with Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, 
</p>
<p>and Kuwait. Negotiations have also been considered or planned with a number of 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>298
</p>
<p>countries, including Qatar, Indonesia, and New Zealand. As Jeffrey Schott of the 
</p>
<p>Institute for International Economics puts it, this &ldquo;spurt of negotiating activity&mdash;in 
</p>
<p>parallel with the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations in the World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization (WTO)&mdash;is unprecedented in postwar US trade policy.&rdquo;20
</p>
<p> In recent years, some of these negotiations have stopped because the obsta-
</p>
<p>cles to reaching an agreement were too numerous to be overcome within a limited 
</p>
<p>time or because the political context was not favorable. Negotiations for the Free 
</p>
<p>Trade Area of the Americas came to a standstill in March 2004. Talks with Thai-
</p>
<p>land were suspended two years later, in March 2006, followed shortly thereafter 
</p>
<p>by a definitive stalling of Southern African Customs Union negotiations in April 
</p>
<p>and the suspension of deliberations with Ecuador in May. Negotiations with Qatar 
</p>
<p>have been on hold since 2006. However, most of the agreements that the United 
</p>
<p>States was negotiating have been signed. Several countries are still in the midst 
</p>
<p>of negotiations, including Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, but since fast-
</p>
<p>track authority expired in July 2007, the intensity of trade negotiations has slowed 
</p>
<p>down significantly.
</p>
<p> As I began by noting, the free-trade agreements negotiated by the United 
</p>
<p>States during this period require levels of protection that are more stringent than 
</p>
<p>the standards required by the TRIPS Agreement of the WTO.21 They contain sev-
</p>
<p>eral types of provision that increase protection and/or strengthen monopolies and 
</p>
<p>that, for instance, limit or preclude the introduction of competitive generic prod-
</p>
<p>ucts or delay the entrance of creative work into the public domain. They play out 
</p>
<p>in two different ways: by increasing the measures of protection or by reducing the 
</p>
<p>possibility of using flexibilities&mdash;measures that can be used to facilitate access to 
</p>
<p>knowledge and knowledge goods under TRIPS&mdash;to limit exclusive rights.22
</p>
<p> Among the intensification of protections, the provisions of these free-trade 
</p>
<p>agreements include the expansion of patentability criteria and the limitation of 
</p>
<p>exceptions to patentability (for example, the patentability of new uses of known 
</p>
<p>medicines and methods for the treatment of plants, animal, seeds, genes, and so 
</p>
<p>on). These measures are responsible for the increase in the number of unessen-
</p>
<p>tial patents, an increase that adds new barriers to the production of and access to 
</p>
<p>generic medicines, food, medical technologies, and so on. At the same time, sev-
</p>
<p>eral agreements include a ban on what is known as &ldquo;pregrant opposition,&rdquo; which 
</p>
<p>would allow third parties to oppose the granting of a patent while it is still under 
</p>
<p>review by the patent office and which is an efficient tool to curtail the prolifera-
</p>
<p>tion of petty patents. Other measures extend the term of patent protection beyond 
</p>
<p>the twenty years imposed by the TRIPS Agreement, using the pretext of delays 
</p>
<p>during the patent-granting procedure and/or the marketing-authorization proce-
</p>
<p>dure. Although patent rights are private rights, the provisions of U.S. free-trade 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>299
</p>
<p>agreements link patent status to drug-marketing approval and compel regulatory 
</p>
<p>agencies to play the role of defenders of patent owners&rsquo; interests. They request 
</p>
<p>that the regulatory agency check the patent status of products and that patent 
</p>
<p>owners be informed if or when generic competitors request marketing approval. 
</p>
<p>Free-trade agreements also create exclusive rights over marketing-approval data 
</p>
<p>that prevent the introduction of generic versions of pharmaceutical products into 
</p>
<p>the market, even in the absence of a patent. In order to secure marketing approval, 
</p>
<p>companies have to provide regulatory agencies with clinical data to prove the 
</p>
<p>safety and efficacy of their products. Data-exclusivity provisions prohibit relying 
</p>
<p>on these data to approve generic versions of the original product. Not only does 
</p>
<p>this measure prohibit generic competition even in the absence of patent protec-
</p>
<p>tion, but it establishes a monopoly that, due to the absence of clear mechanisms to 
</p>
<p>do so, is even more difficult to challenge than a patent.
</p>
<p> Measures included in free-trade agreements also limit the flexibilities avail-
</p>
<p>able to developing countries, such as compulsory licensing, whereby the use of 
</p>
<p>a patent can be allowed without the consent of its holder. They do so by restrict-
</p>
<p>ing the grounds on which the compulsory license can be issued and through data-
</p>
<p>exclusivity provisions that indirectly prevent countries from taking full advantage 
</p>
<p>of compulsory licensing by blocking marketing approval for generics produced or 
</p>
<p>imported under compulsory licensing. Likewise, they prohibit parallel imports&mdash;
</p>
<p>the importation and resale of a patented product in a country without the consent 
</p>
<p>of the patent holder, which allows the purchase of cheaper products from a foreign 
</p>
<p>country&mdash;by imposing a national or regional regime of rights exhaustion.
</p>
<p> Copyright laws are targeted by free-trade-agreement provisions, as well, 
</p>
<p>resulting in the obstruction of fair use and the limitation of access to all sorts 
</p>
<p>of materials (in hard-copy or digital form), including the prevention of the on-
</p>
<p>line distribution of software, music, or publications, all of which amounts to an 
</p>
<p>obstruction to education, research, technology advancement, and publishing, but 
</p>
<p>which also endangers the global architecture of the Internet and its freedom as 
</p>
<p>a public space. Free-trade agreements request copyright protection similar to or 
</p>
<p>stronger than what prevails in U.S. copyright laws, such as the 1998 Digital Millen-
</p>
<p>nium Copyright Act. Many of them extend the term of copyright protection to the 
</p>
<p>life of the author plus seventy years or to seventy years from the publication or 
</p>
<p>creation of the work. Because in many countries, the copyright protection is fifty 
</p>
<p>years, the extension further delays the entrance of works into the public domain. 
</p>
<p>Just as they prohibit parallel imports of patented products such as medicines, free-
</p>
<p>trade agreements prohibit parallel imports of copyrighted works that have been 
</p>
<p>lawfully sold in foreign markets. They also impose technical-protection measures 
</p>
<p>on copyrighted works and create obligations to prevent the circumvention of 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>300
</p>
<p>such measures, and enhance enforcement obligations that go beyond the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>requirements, including, in some cases such as Korea, very specific unilateral obli-
</p>
<p>gations to prosecute Internet piracy, impose liabilities on Internet service provid-
</p>
<p>ers whose networks are used to distribute copyright-infringing material, and shut 
</p>
<p>down offending Web sites. This is in line with the adoption of criminal sanctions 
</p>
<p>or increased criminal penalties for a range of activities that the United States also 
</p>
<p>promotes in international negotiations, such as those that took place over the 
</p>
<p>Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. Free-trade agreements even enlarge the 
</p>
<p>concept of infringement, for example to acts of reproduction or the use of copy-
</p>
<p>righted material that would not be considered as such under the fair use limitations 
</p>
<p>of the U.S. copyright law. This includes changing the definitions of &ldquo;reproduction&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>and &ldquo;material form&rdquo; to cover transitory reproductions, shifting the burden of proof 
</p>
<p>onto the defending party to show that the activity is noninfringing, and a number 
</p>
<p>of similar measures.
</p>
<p> In addition to all this, U.S. free-trade agreements require adherence to inter-
</p>
<p>national treaties such as the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances 
</p>
<p>and Phonograms Treaty, which require that countries adopt additional measures to 
</p>
<p>impose, increase, and protect the rights of copyright holders.
</p>
<p> With the development of new technologies and the emergence of the knowl-
</p>
<p>edge economy, the race for economic dominance became a technology race 
</p>
<p>between the rich countries that have control over the production of scientific and 
</p>
<p>technical knowledge and the less developed countries trying to acquire this knowl-
</p>
<p>edge and to develop their own potentials. As Ha-Joon Chang notes, &ldquo;knowledge 
</p>
<p>had always flowed from where there is more to where there is less,&rdquo;23 and thus the 
</p>
<p>task for the United States is to stem the flow of scientific and technical knowledge. 
</p>
<p>This is precisely what is at stake with the restrictions on intellectual property in 
</p>
<p>the U.S. free-trade agreements.
</p>
<p> Since the Democratic Party took control of the U.S. House of Representatives 
</p>
<p>and the Senate in 2006, Democrats have raised concerns about the country&rsquo;s pol-
</p>
<p>icy on free-trade agreements.24 One consequence has been a new trade arrange-
</p>
<p>ment between Congress and the White House, adopted in May 2007 in the con-
</p>
<p>text of the approaching Congressional passage of free-trade agreements signed 
</p>
<p>with Peru, Panama, and Colombia. Several aspects of the TRIPS-plus provisions 
</p>
<p>in these agreements were revised: Patent extensions and mandatory linkages 
</p>
<p>were eliminated, while data exclusivity was limited to five years. These changes 
</p>
<p>affected only the three agreements pending at the time, which, regardless of these 
</p>
<p>improvements, nevertheless still remain more protective than the WTO standard. 
</p>
<p>They did, however, mark the first time since the United States embarked on its 
</p>
<p>post-TRIPS pursuit of free-trade agreements that the U.S. trade representative 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>301
</p>
<p>officially and publicly reversed the policy of pursuing increased levels of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property protection. Nevertheless, the fact that an agreement was ultimately 
</p>
<p>reached between the Congress and the White House also demonstrates that the 
</p>
<p>current U.S. trade policy, with minor changes such as these, is still a bipartisan one.
</p>
<p>u.s. free-trade agreement policy: the political context
</p>
<p>Peter Drahos and Susan K. Sell have both shown how a handful of corporate lead-
</p>
<p>ers got together to convince the U.S. administration and successive U.S. govern-
</p>
<p>ments, as well as the international business community and the governments of 
</p>
<p>other developed countries, of the necessity of formally linking trade with intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property and of including intellectual property in the GATT negotiations.25 
</p>
<p>As a result of this lobbying effort, the line of demarcation between U.S. corpora-
</p>
<p>tions and the U.S. government became blurred. This is not to say that the U.S. 
</p>
<p>administration strictly follows the same agenda as the business community, blindly 
</p>
<p>obeys it, or is completely corrupt,26 but U.S. corporate representatives gradually 
</p>
<p>have found ways to come closer to policy makers, establishing regular contacts 
</p>
<p>and collaboration. Corporations thus have become not only useful collaborators, 
</p>
<p>but indispensable in the process of policy making, creating interdependency 
</p>
<p>between them and the policy makers.27 In this collaborative dynamic, policy mak-
</p>
<p>ers slowly have incorporated business logic and goals into the process, and these 
</p>
<p>have become part of those of the government&rsquo;s own logic and goals once they were 
</p>
<p>included in its administrative and legal language.
</p>
<p> The history of international intellectual property negotiations involving the 
</p>
<p>United States provides many examples of how this dynamic was established and 
</p>
<p>how it unfolded. Drahos and Braithwaite recount the example of how, as the 
</p>
<p>prospect of the negotiations on intellectual property during the Uruguay Round 
</p>
<p>loomed, the U.S. trade representative asked U.S. businesses to provide negotiat-
</p>
<p>ing objectives and concrete demands, which resulted in strong similarities between 
</p>
<p>official U.S. documents and the companies&rsquo; own &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; for trade negotia-
</p>
<p>tors, the Basic Framework of GATT Provisions on Intellectual Property: Statement 
</p>
<p>of Views of the European, Japanese and United States Business Communities, when 
</p>
<p>U.S. officials were not simply borrowing parts of this document.28 The same kind 
</p>
<p>of phenomenon can be observed more recently between the annual U.S. trade rep-
</p>
<p>resentative&rsquo;s 301 report and the submissions that the industry provides every year.
</p>
<p> Of course, U.S. business goals in many ways reflect the goals and interests 
</p>
<p>of multinational corporations, regardless of where the headquarters or produc-
</p>
<p>tion facilities of these corporations are, a phenomenon reinforced as economic 
</p>
<p>globalization intensifies. This is not to say that a company&rsquo;s nationality, or more 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>precisely, the nationalities of its executive decision makers, no longer matters. As 
</p>
<p>Chang notes, most top executives are nationals from the country in which the firm 
</p>
<p>originates.29 Capital stays rooted geographically, and its logic does not override the 
</p>
<p>logic of national interests. However, following Jeff Faux, we can consider the logic 
</p>
<p>of company executives to be similar to a class logic,30 which illustrates itself in its 
</p>
<p>ability to define common objectives, to then promote them within governments 
</p>
<p>and among political leaders, inspire reforms, and in some ways structure society 
</p>
<p>beyond national borders. The revolving-door practice, in which employees shift 
</p>
<p>back and forth between the public and the private sector, which is so common in 
</p>
<p>the United States, is part of how that system homogenizes the way leaders see 
</p>
<p>issues and define policy goals. Money changes hands in some cases, but most of 
</p>
<p>the time, things happen more through the exchange of favors and the sharing of 
</p>
<p>common views and interests.
</p>
<p> But the phenomenon observed in the field of intellectual property is not only 
</p>
<p>the result of the collective action of a fraction of the world population. It is also 
</p>
<p>in line with a broader change in politico-economic governance that has unfolded 
</p>
<p>since the end of the 1970s: the emergence of neoliberal rationality, which has 
</p>
<p>favored both a new attitude by business toward governments and the redefinition 
</p>
<p>of these two entities, their roles, and the relations between them. With neoliberal-
</p>
<p>ism, political affairs, like all sectors of society, have become subjected to economic 
</p>
<p>rationality, while in turn, the new political rationality has been institutionalized 
</p>
<p>and spread.31 It has embraced the state, which has redefined itself according to 
</p>
<p>market logic as subject to profitability criteria and thus seeks to favor entrepre-
</p>
<p>neurial interests in its public-policy decisions and uses the law as an instrument to 
</p>
<p>serve this purpose.32
</p>
<p> Neoliberalism provided the conditions to impose a new global intellectual 
</p>
<p>property system in the 1990s: a new definition of the state and its prerogatives, 
</p>
<p>a new relationship between the public and private spheres, and the expansion of 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements as vehicles for promoting strong intellectual property pro-
</p>
<p>tection provisions. In turn, stricter intellectual property protections have been one 
</p>
<p>of the ways in which the dominant class spreading neoliberalism has reinforced its 
</p>
<p>power by securing its control of the assets that fuel capitalist accumulation in the 
</p>
<p>knowledge economy.
</p>
<p> While their theoretical foundations are based on the classical liberal econom-
</p>
<p>ics of Adam Smith and its followers, neoliberals stray from their ancestors in that 
</p>
<p>they do not limit the influence of market logic to the economic sphere, but at 
</p>
<p>the same time do not take the market as a natural fact.33 Neoliberals disparage 
</p>
<p>state intervention when the state acts as a social and economic safety net, but 
</p>
<p>encourage the state to support and protect economic activity and to guarantee 
</p>

<p>303
</p>
<p>the conditions of competition and free trade. The free market, unhampered by 
</p>
<p>government interference in its effects, but assisted by a range of state interven-
</p>
<p>tions, including deregulation and privatization, is supposed to be able to reach 
</p>
<p>maximal economic profitability. Neoliberals, unlike classical liberals, are not both-
</p>
<p>ered by monopolies as long as they emerge within the market, for they believe 
</p>
<p>they will be automatically regulated by the economic dynamic, but they reject, 
</p>
<p>in theory at least, institutionalized forms of monopolies, whether public or pri-
</p>
<p>vate.34 Their deep enthusiasm for strong intellectual property rights&mdash;the justi-
</p>
<p>fication being that insufficient protection of intellectual property rights harms 
</p>
<p>free trade by introducing trade distortions&mdash;introduces contradictions into this 
</p>
<p>orthodoxy, since it results in extensive institutionalized monopolies and heavy 
</p>
<p>regulation hedging a market economy.35 That the TRIPS Agreement, with its sub-
</p>
<p>stantial protections for intellectual property, is part of the WTO can be seen as 
</p>
<p>one of the paradoxes that illustrates existing tensions between the theory of neo-
</p>
<p>liberalism and the reality of its practices. But such contradictions have not pre-
</p>
<p>vented the business and economic elites in the United States and the United States 
</p>
<p>government from pressing for greater restrictions on intellectual property in the  
</p>
<p>past decades.
</p>
<p> Intellectual property protection can be seen as a natural extension of the pro-
</p>
<p>prietary system promoted by classical liberalism as adapted to the growing knowl-
</p>
<p>edge economy. It is a key factor in controlling the conditions of production and 
</p>
<p>commodification of what are currently the most valuable goods within the capital-
</p>
<p>ist order. Neoliberals obviously have an interest in making the control of informa-
</p>
<p>tion technologies a major source of accumulation&mdash;the motivation to do so was 
</p>
<p>increased by the belief in the risk of the decreased competitiveness of the United 
</p>
<p>States and the fear of an economic decline that spread among U.S. policy makers 
</p>
<p>and economists at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s.36 Intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property was seen as important to securing the position of U.S. industries, and 
</p>
<p>a strong intellectual property regime was seen as central to securing the profitabil-
</p>
<p>ity of their technologies and innovations.
</p>
<p> In the United States, the lax domestic patent environment gave way in the 
</p>
<p>1980s to a resurgence of patent rights, while antitrust laws and policies, on the 
</p>
<p>other hand, were weakened.37 This change in the U.S. patent regime attests to a 
</p>
<p>more general change in the thinking about intellectual property and its role in 
</p>
<p>the economic life of the United States. At stake was the ability to prevent foreign 
</p>
<p>economies from autonomously absorbing &ldquo;U.S.&rdquo; technologies and their benefits. To 
</p>
<p>use Drahos and Braithwaite&rsquo;s portrayal in Information Feudalism, &ldquo;old protection-
</p>
<p>ism was about keeping your rival&rsquo;s goods out of your domestic market. New pro-
</p>
<p>tectionism in the knowledge economy was about securing a monopoly privilege in 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>304
</p>
<p>an intangible asset and keeping your rival out of the world markets.&rdquo;38
</p>
<p> As we began by noting, until the late 1970s, developing countries were able to 
</p>
<p>rely on domestic market-protection measures and subsidies to undergird indus-
</p>
<p>tries or specific economic sectors and to relax intellectual property rules in order 
</p>
<p>to achieve better economic growth and development&mdash;in other words, they were 
</p>
<p>doing what developed countries had done in their time as developing countries, 
</p>
<p>too. This rapidly changed with the new direction encouraged by the United States 
</p>
<p>and other wealthy countries. Developing countries were now bound by the imper-
</p>
<p>ative to adopt the rule of free markets and free trade while securing stronger rights 
</p>
<p>for intellectual property owners.
</p>
<p> Under the influence of the &ldquo;Chicago School&rdquo; of free-market economics, Ronald 
</p>
<p>Reagan, who first took power in 1981, and his administration played a fundamen-
</p>
<p>tal role in the changes in U.S. intellectual property policy. An efficient network 
</p>
<p>of individuals in American institutions was gradually put in place through which 
</p>
<p>significant legal changes were introduced domestically. In 1981, Reagan appointed 
</p>
<p>William F. Baxter as head of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, 
</p>
<p>and Baxter introduced several legal changes aimed at increasing intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty protection while deregulating competition.39 In 1982, Reagan signed the bill 
</p>
<p>creating the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which became an important 
</p>
<p>tool for patent owners to promote their interests,40 to mention only two examples.
</p>
<p> On the international level, with the adoption of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, 
</p>
<p>Reagan became the first U.S. president to have a direct say on the behavior of for-
</p>
<p>eign countries toward intellectual property and their access to Generalized System 
</p>
<p>of Preferences benefits.41 He rapidly made use of this new prerogative: In 1988, he 
</p>
<p>announced that Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong were going to 
</p>
<p>be removed from that program the following year.42 This use of actual sanctions 
</p>
<p>had the important effect of giving credibility to latter threats, even though, in the 
</p>
<p>future, inscription of countries on the 301 list rarely led to real punitive measures. 
</p>
<p>In 1986, Reagan set up the Council on Competitiveness, which gathered together 
</p>
<p>corporate CEOs, university presidents, and labor leaders and which became one 
</p>
<p>of the trade institutions within which executives from pharmaceutical companies 
</p>
<p>introduced and pushed the issue of intellectual property.43
</p>
<p> On February 6, 1986, in a message to Congress, the president declared: &ldquo;Trade 
</p>
<p>is the life blood of the global economy. Growing world markets mean greater pros-
</p>
<p>perity for America and a stronger, safer, and more secure world for the family 
</p>
<p>of free nations. We will continue to work to promote a free, fair and expanding 
</p>
<p>world trading system. . . . In addition, we will propose legislation to strengthen and 
</p>
<p>broaden protection of intellectual property.&rdquo;44 Intellectual property was officially 
</p>
<p>now on the U.S. political agenda.

</p>
<p> Globally, Ronald Reagan was a key player in the neoliberal revolution, striving 
</p>
<p>with great success, along with Margaret Thatcher, to make what had been minor-
</p>
<p>ity positions become the mainstream intellectual, political, and ideological frame-
</p>
<p>work.45 Once in place, this new framework made it difficult for their successors, 
</p>
<p>regardless of their own beliefs or political orientations, to escape the new politi-
</p>
<p>cal rationality or to change the course of policies or to extract themselves from 
</p>
<p>the web of relations and obligations to which they were linked. In this regard, 
</p>
<p>the resumption by the Clinton Administration of the free-trade agenda that Rea-
</p>
<p>gan had launched illustrates how, during the 1990s, neoliberalism was so largely 
</p>
<p>embraced that it became the new orthodoxy.
</p>
<p> Bill Clinton declared during his presidential campaign in 1992 that he would not 
</p>
<p>support the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) unless social protec-
</p>
<p>tion was included in it, but that did not prevent him from becoming the master 
</p>
<p>of ceremonies for its signing in November 1993, once he was elected. The idea for 
</p>
<p>NAFTA was first proposed by Ronald Reagan in 1979. The negotiations that started 
</p>
<p>in 1990 were conducted by the first Bush administration. It was then signed and 
</p>
<p>sent to Congress for approval by Bill Clinton. To emphasize what was framed as 
</p>
<p>a bipartisan victory, Clinton appeared at the signing ceremony together with for-
</p>
<p>mer presidents George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald Ford. The message 
</p>
<p>was clear: NAFTA was above ideology. As Vice President Al Gore stated during the 
</p>
<p>ceremony:
</p>
<p>There are some issues that transcend ideology. That is, the view is so uniform that it 
</p>
<p>unites people in both parties. This means our country can pursue a bipartisan pol-
</p>
<p>icy with continuity over the decades. That&rsquo;s how we won the Cold War. That&rsquo;s how 
</p>
<p>we have promoted peace and reconciliation in the Middle East. And that&rsquo;s how the 
</p>
<p>United States of America has promoted freer trade and bigger markets for our prod-
</p>
<p>ucts and those of other nations throughout the world. NAFTA is such an issue.46
</p>
<p> Free-trade agreements are a very efficient tool in the process of promoting neo-
</p>
<p>liberal policies. They are effective not only because they are promoted by the most 
</p>
<p>powerful political and economic country of their time, but also&mdash;an illustration of 
</p>
<p>the expression of a hegemonic system&mdash;they become perceived in many political 
</p>
<p>and intellectual circles as an option that is nonideological. The consequences of 
</p>
<p>signing a free-trade agreement thus seem to be apprehended outside and indepen-
</p>
<p>dently of the issue of the political system from which it is generated and that it 
</p>
<p>reinforces. This is shown by the fact that even government leaders with leftist polit-
</p>
<p>ical orientations are involved in free-trade-agreement negotiations&mdash;or want to be.
</p>
<p> A principal tenet of this pervasive hegemonic system is the assumption that 
</p>
<p>securing private property is the most efficient means to ensure productivity and 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>306
</p>
<p>make citizens responsible&mdash;the language of individual responsibility being one 
</p>
<p>of the key terms of neoliberalism. Individuals are responsible for what they own: 
</p>
<p>This line of argument is used to discredit publicly owned companies and public 
</p>
<p>services as being inefficient and underproductive. This framing, used in the con-
</p>
<p>text of the Cold War to decry the Communist economic system, was later &ldquo;natu-
</p>
<p>rally&rdquo; incorporated into neoliberal discourse and disseminated as the first waves 
</p>
<p>of massive privatization took place in Britain under Thatcher in the early 1980s. 
</p>
<p>The belief&mdash;practically a doctrine&mdash;that private equals good, while public leads to 
</p>
<p>failure, became common rhetoric of neoliberal propaganda. One can easily imagine 
</p>
<p>how, as a further evolution of this equation, the conventional wisdom could soon 
</p>
<p>become that free (as in free of charge) equals bad&mdash;or dangerous. Lawrence Liang 
</p>
<p>describes very convincingly the sort of insecurities that grow regarding knowledge 
</p>
<p>goods while intellectual property protections increase.47 The fear or apprehension 
</p>
<p>to which he refers, the fear of trespassing or unlawful appropriation, could easily 
</p>
<p>expand and apply to all free goods. Are they really free? Am I doing something 
</p>
<p>wrong by downloading them? If they are free, are they safe?
</p>
<p> The propaganda advocating increases in protections for intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights commonly plays on this sort of insecurity. Public-relations offensives of 
</p>
<p>brand-name pharmaceutical companies, for instance, recurrently state or imply 
</p>
<p>that generic medicines are of low quality. Initiatives such as the Anti-Counterfeiting  
</p>
<p>Trade Agreement, an international agreement currently under expedited

<p>negotiation,48 use semantic shifts to undermine the image and use of certain goods 
</p>
<p>and to extend the realm of illegality to them. An obvious example is the use of 
</p>
<p>the term &ldquo;counterfeit&rdquo; to designate generic products. For its part, the entertain-
</p>
<p>ment industry multiplies commercials and campaigns accusing pirated DVDs of 
</p>
<p>being bad copies and of supporting terrorism, describing those who copy goods 
</p>
<p>as criminals and those who buy them and use them as thieves.49 These campaigns 
</p>
<p>use threats of imprisonment, social exclusion, and opprobrium, creating a fear of 
</p>
<p>cheap or free goods that may fall within our reach, but with which contact can be 
</p>
<p>shown to be extremely dangerous.
</p>
<p> These narratives constructed by intellectual property rights owners aim at 
</p>
<p>modifying representations and changing behaviors while promoting legal reforms 
</p>
<p>and securing the place of their products in the market. Their leitmotifs are the war 
</p>
<p>against counterfeiting and piracy and stronger enforcement of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights. This anti-A2K campaign is being developed to counter recent setbacks 
</p>
<p>at the multilateral level, such as the Doha Declaration at the WTO, the Develop-
</p>
<p>ment Agenda at WIPO,50 and adverse local initiatives, including the use of com-
</p>
<p>pulsory licensing to permit the production of certain generic drugs in Thailand and 
</p>
<p>Brazil and national laws allowing the noncommercial downloading of music. The 
</p>
<p>rhetoric used follows classic paths. One common trend is to appeal to fear of crime 
</p>
<p>and concerns about safety, associating competitors&rsquo; goods with the risk of death 
</p>
<p>or imprisonment. From this viewpoint, the media storm that has risen during the 
</p>
<p>past few years in the United States and Europe denigrating the quality of Chinese 
</p>
<p>products, which burst in on Western markets at a time when their competitiveness 
</p>
<p>is undeniable and their presence is significantly increasing, may call for some scru-
</p>
<p>tiny. It offers a convincing example of the use of arguments and fears regarding 
</p>
<p>quality and safety to influence people&rsquo;s opinion and serve commercial interests.
</p>
<p> Already in the 1960s, when Asian countries where trying to secure the right 
</p>
<p>to use intellectual work such as textbooks to meet the educational needs of their 
</p>
<p>populations, they were branded by the United States as &ldquo;pirates.&rdquo; In 1979, the call 
</p>
<p>for an &ldquo;anti-counterfeiting code&rdquo; was used as an entry point by the United States 
</p>
<p>to push the issue of an international agreement on intellectual property during the 
</p>
<p>Tokyo Round of the GATT.51 More recently, the link between counterfeiting and 
</p>
<p>terrorism surfaced following the World Trade Center attack. In 2003, INTERPOL 
</p>
<p>secretary general, Ronald K. Noble, warned governments that &ldquo;there [was] grow-
</p>
<p>ing evidence of a link between intellectual property crime and terrorist financing&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(author&rsquo;s italics).52 These kinds of association between terms became a staple of 
</p>
<p>the political communication spins of the U.S. government over the past decade&mdash;
</p>
<p>associations between Iraq and 9/11 for example&mdash;and more generally of the neolib-
</p>
<p>eral state, so much so that it is not surprising to hear participants at governmental 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>

<p>or international copyright meetings talk about terrorism as if it were a problem 
</p>
<p>with which they were actually dealing, while the equation between &ldquo;generic&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;counterfeit&rdquo; has been unquestioningly assimilated into the thinking of many 
</p>
<p>people in many countries. These propaganda techniques are connected to coer-
</p>
<p>cive measures and tactics aimed at controlling and regulating people&rsquo;s behaviors&mdash;
</p>
<p>which represents yet another component of neoliberal rationality.
</p>
<p> Yet another tendency of the neoliberal argument is to convince people that 
</p>
<p>there is no alternative to what is offered and what is being done. This is where 
</p>
<p>neoliberals have proven efficient at the performative practice of presenting their 
</p>
<p>choices as the only realistic fictions available. It is a belief that expresses itself 
</p>
<p>in developing countries&rsquo; attitude toward free trade: For many leaders of develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries, free-trade agreements are perceived as the only possible path to 
</p>
<p>secure their country&rsquo;s position in the globalized economy: Not getting into the 
</p>
<p>game would mean losing market access and competitiveness, while their neighbors 
</p>
<p>are probably keen to launch negotiations with the United States, if they haven&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>already signed an agreement. This sense of inevitability also means that countries 
</p>
<p>tend to accept U.S. demands on intellectual property issues once they have gotten 
</p>
<p>involved in negotiations.
</p>
<p> Associated with the power of beliefs is the use of statistics expected to reveal 
</p>
<p>the economic truth underlying the neoliberal system. To support their assertions, 
</p>
<p>advocates for intellectual property restrictions and neoliberal crusaders do not 
</p>
<p>hesitate to invoke numbers and statistics, often showing few qualms regarding 
</p>
<p>their veracity or the methods used to produce them. The estimated losses of cor-
</p>
<p>porate profits due to counterfeiting and piracy are figures of this sort, regularly 
</p>
<p>fed to policy makers as well as to the public, whether in institutional debates or 
</p>
<p>in commercials on TV. Numbers are conveyed from the companies to the lobby 
</p>
<p>groups and from the industry associations to the government and the media. The 
</p>
<p>media reports them, and governments use them in international negotiations. The 
</p>
<p>ways these numbers are obtained often lack any semblance of scientific method or 
</p>
<p>even a basis in reality, but they are nonetheless rarely questioned.
</p>
<p> Drahos and Braithwaite mention a case in Italy in which the estimates of com-
</p>
<p>pany losses because of video piracy were established based on the assumption that 
</p>
<p>for every illegal cassette, there was an unsold movie-theater ticket: If you multiply 
</p>
<p>the number of cassettes by the price of a movie ticket, you therefore supposedly 
</p>
<p>get the total of the producer&rsquo;s loss on the movie.53 Similar doubts regarding accu-
</p>
<p>racy can be raised over the economic projections used by the U.S. government or 
</p>
<p>industries promoting free-trade agreements. But as Drahos and Braithwaite note, 
</p>
<p>skepticism and doubt do not prevent the U.S. trade representative from using the 
</p>
<p>figures provided by the industry to promote free-trade agreements or to threaten 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>

</p>
<p>countries with sanctions through the 301 process,54 the most convincing argument 
</p>
<p>for doing so being that &ldquo;they [are], after all, the only figures that [are] available.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> This practice of modifying the perception of reality, which occurs under the 
</p>
<p>auspices of propaganda, indoctrination, and ideology, was routinely used in the 
</p>
<p>process of establishing and maintaining neoliberal hegemony. It provides a good 
</p>
<p>example of what Antonio Gramsci called &ldquo;political questions . . . disguised as cul-
</p>
<p>tural ones,&rdquo; which &ldquo;as such become insoluble.&rdquo;55 As Harvey sees it, the utopian 
</p>
<p>arguments of neoliberalism, such as freedom and individual responsibility, have 
</p>
<p>served as a justification for and legitimization of the efforts of an economic elite to 
</p>
<p>create or to restore its own power.56
</p>
<p> Thomas Edsall describes how those who brought about the neoliberal revolu-
</p>
<p>tion became organized:
</p>
<p>During the 1970s, business refined its ability to act as a class, submerging competi-
</p>
<p>tive instincts in favor of joint, cooperative action in the legislative arena. Rather 
</p>
<p>than individual companies seeking only special favor . . . the dominant theme in the 
</p>
<p>political strategy of business became a shared interest in the defeat of bills such as 
</p>
<p>consumer protection and labor law reform, and in the enactment of favorable tax, 
</p>
<p>regulatory and antitrust legislation.57
</p>
<p>Instead of being a simple corporatist action, this movement became a political move-
</p>
<p>ment. An anecdote recalled by Jeff Faux in the introduction of The Global Class War 
</p>
<p>offers a convincing example of how reliance on class solidarity operates within a 
</p>
<p>worldwide elite. During a conversation he had with a corporate lobbyist from Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, D.C., the latter, defending NAFTA, gave what she thought to be the ultimate 
</p>
<p>argument: The president of Mexico is &ldquo;one of us.&rdquo; Hence, his peers had to help him 
</p>
<p>and support the agreement.58 President Carlos Salinas had gone to the same type of 
</p>
<p>school (Harvard, in this case) and was an important economic and political player, 
</p>
<p>which, according to that lobbyist, made them all part of the same club.
</p>
<p> Thus, there exists a loose network of individuals, not limited geographically, 
</p>
<p>who, despite important differences in their origins, lives, experiences, cultures, 
</p>
<p>and political views, share enough in terms of their position with regard to the 
</p>
<p>market and political power to harbor a feeling of belonging and to act in a con-
</p>
<p>nected and even united way.59 The members of this network, which can be seen 
</p>
<p>as what Gramsci called a &ldquo;fundamental social group,&rdquo; consider themselves to be 
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;organizer[s] of society,&rdquo; striving &ldquo;to create the conditions most favourable to 
</p>
<p>the expansion of their own class,&rdquo;60 and are often backed by those who are keen 
</p>
<p>to compare themselves to this elite, yearn to be part of the club, and thus tend to 
</p>
<p>support the elite and the policies it promotes, as if doing so were an elementary 
</p>
<p>precondition of their acceptance.

</p>
<p> This class phenomenon is mobilized and maintained according to functional 
</p>
<p>rules similar to those described by Monique Pin&ccedil;on-Charlot and Michel Pin&ccedil;on 
</p>
<p>in high social classes in France. Society life plays an essential role in the sharing 
</p>
<p>of information and relations and in the building of strategies.61 Members of this 
</p>
<p>global governing class do favors for each other not only because they belong to the 
</p>
<p>same club, but because doing so helps establish that belonging&mdash;and because each 
</p>
<p>of the members will at one point or another need a favor in return, and knows 
</p>
<p>it. A set of social techniques materializes class functioning and develops the col-
</p>
<p>lective consciousness of belonging among its members. It therefore creates the 
</p>
<p>ties and the obligations to stand by each other, the solidarity summoned by the 
</p>
<p>lobbyist talking with Faux and that Lloyd Bentsen expressed when he was asked 
</p>
<p>why Congress should pass NAFTA: His response was, &ldquo;One word. And it&rsquo;s spelled 
</p>
<p>S-A-L-I-N-A-S.&rdquo;62
</p>
<p> A new social group does not supplant an older group, but there is a recon-
</p>
<p>figuration of the vision of governing that allows alliances between a new economic 
</p>
<p>power&mdash;those who got rich or richer through the privatization that occurred with 
</p>
<p>the process of establishing the neoliberal hegemony&mdash;and the more traditional 
</p>
<p>governing elite.
</p>
<p> On the other end of the social spectrum, through free-trade agreements and 
</p>
<p>other policies, neoliberalism has reproduced a population of poor individuals 
</p>
<p>primarily used as producers deprived of control of the means of production and 
</p>
<p>regarded simply as passive consumers of goods. This social group is composed 
</p>
<p>of the traditional industrial working class, which, despite the closing of plants in 
</p>
<p>developed countries, still exists and endures primitive working and living condi-
</p>
<p>tions in many parts of the world. According to estimates, the job loss in the United 
</p>
<p>States from NAFTA has been between five hundred thousand and one million.63 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, car exports from Mexico to the United States doubled between 1993 
</p>
<p>and 1996. At the same time, productivity steadily increased, and wages decreased. 
</p>
<p>Sherrod Brown estimates that Mexican workers have faced a 50 percent decline 
</p>
<p>in their standard of living since the enactment of NAFTA. Most of the jobs that 
</p>
<p>have disappeared in developed countries have not vanished from the surface of 
</p>
<p>the Earth. The work is still done, the goods are still manufactured&mdash;only the places 
</p>
<p>change. Free trade favors this low-cost labor, performed by workers living in free-
</p>
<p>trade zones, but mostly locked within national boundaries. A traditional form of 
</p>
<p>exploitation that follows the rules of industrial capitalism under neoliberal gov-
</p>
<p>ernance persists at the peripheries of the knowledge economy, while productiv-
</p>
<p>ity and wages are further dissociated from the costs of production and prices. As 
</p>
<p>Brown notes, &ldquo;when Nike moved all its production overseas, the price of its shoes 
</p>
<p>did not decrease.&rdquo;64
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>312
</p>
<p> These workers represent a classical form of proletariat that does not possess 
</p>
<p>capital and is under the rules of free trade particularly vulnerable to exploita-
</p>
<p>tion. At the same time, by means of intellectual property protections, free-trade 
</p>
<p>agreements help to exclude this population from the most liberating and creative 
</p>
<p>dimensions of &ldquo;cognitive capitalism,&rdquo; the capacity to use nonmaterial resources 
</p>
<p>to produce freely, without restriction and for one&rsquo;s own interest.65 A cognitive 
</p>
<p>proletariat thus exists under the &ldquo;information feudalism&rdquo; described by Drahos 
</p>
<p>and Braithwaite. It consists of women and men who manufacture jeans or DVDs, 
</p>
<p>auto parts, electronic chips, or medicines and who, under the rules of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property, are denied the access to knowledge that would allow them to be more 
</p>
<p>than simple consumers with limited access to physical goods.66 Indeed, the knowl-
</p>
<p>edge&mdash;the cognitive capital&mdash;necessary for them to develop their own products 
</p>
<p>and to produce and sell them at cheap prices to their own advantage is instead 
</p>
<p>confiscated by law.67
</p>
<p> The valorization of privatized knowledge further dissociates the value that is 
</p>
<p>attributed to a good on the market from the amount of social labor time neces-
</p>
<p>sary to produce it and from the simple cost of production. This affects immaterial 
</p>
<p>goods (the price of a text message, for example), as well as material goods defined 
</p>
<p>by immaterial qualities (the price for a pair of brand-name jeans, the cost of a 
</p>
<p>patented drug). However, this is not the sort of liberation from the rule of valua-
</p>
<p>tion that puts abundance within the reach of the multitude.68 The implementation 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property rules compartmentalizes access both to knowledge and to 
</p>
<p>what can be produced or invented with acquired knowledge. Intellectual property 
</p>
<p>barriers reinforce the partition of society into categories of individuals&mdash;at least 
</p>
<p>two for each type of goods: those who access the knowledge and the goods and 
</p>
<p>those who do not or do not do so fully. Two different realities thus coexist: a mar-
</p>
<p>ket of abundance, where money, goods, and ideas flow, and a restricted market, 
</p>
<p>where scarcity is the result of the limited capacity of those who constitute it to 
</p>
<p>accumulate and use cognitive capital and to afford goods. We might draw an anal-
</p>
<p>ogy with Marx&rsquo;s analysis of the class struggle and say that we see the information 
</p>
<p>society &ldquo;splitting up into two great hostile camps&rdquo;69 under the rule of cognitive 
</p>
<p>capitalism and neoliberalism. However, this class structure cleaves the traditional 
</p>
<p>social classes according to new divides that do not correspond to the habitual fault 
</p>
<p>lines, even if they also highlight them occasionally, since what distinguishes peo-
</p>
<p>ple is not necessarily their ability to possess knowledge, but also their capacity to 
</p>
<p>control nonrival knowledge or make use of it.
</p>
<p> The expropriation of intellectual property does not affect only the poorest of 
</p>
<p>the poor, those who work in sweatshops and have no access to education. One can 
</p>
<p>see free-trade agreements as recreating and reinforcing social divides between a 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>313
</p>
<p>ruling class that continually strengthens its control and increases its capital accu-
</p>
<p>mulation and a portion of the world population with restricted access and choices 
</p>
<p>and affected by increasing inequities. But there is also an important heterogene-
</p>
<p>ity in those affected by the expropriation of intellectual property, a heterogene-
</p>
<p>ity that leads to new fronts along which class confrontations can be seen. Many 
</p>
<p>people do not belong to the most precarious social class. They may take part in 
</p>
<p>the production of knowledge, but still remain captive consumers of proprietary 
</p>
<p>goods, and because they are subject to enclosing and repressive intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty laws, they are deprived of influence over the conditions that determine and 
</p>
<p>limit their access to knowledge and goods. For instance, they have no control over 
</p>
<p>the types of medical innovation that are produced and that often do not neces-
</p>
<p>sarily meet their most urgent medical needs, and they do not control the pric-
</p>
<p>ing of the products and services that they do need, and hence, they can easily be 
</p>
<p>excluded from access to them, a phenomenon that affects an increasing portion of 
</p>
<p>the middle class in developed countries.
</p>
<p> At the same time, all those who are among the cogs of production of the new 
</p>
<p>form of capitalism that has flourished in the context of the knowledge economy, 
</p>
<p>including those just discussed, are not just a workforce exploited to accumulate 
</p>
<p>capital. Their knowledge, which defines them under this regime, is something that 
</p>
<p>they contribute to production (that is, to their own exploitation), but unlike mus-
</p>
<p>cular force or other forms of physical effort, this input is not easily replaceable or 
</p>
<p>always exchangeable.70 Experience and the accumulation of knowledge and know-
</p>
<p>how give a unique character to the creative production of an individual. Part of 
</p>
<p>what makes an individual&rsquo;s acts of creation possible&mdash;the skills, the thinking, and 
</p>
<p>the experience of production itself&mdash;is capital for future creation and remains his 
</p>
<p>or her own. Even if he or she is not the one who owns the property rights to what 
</p>
<p>is produced and is not supposed to share it or use it without authorization, the 
</p>
<p>skills, the thinking, and the experience involved in producing it are potentials that 
</p>
<p>the individual can mobilize at any time and that others value.
</p>
<p> Hence, the multitude of those who are, to one degree or another expropriated 
</p>
<p>and exploited under intellectual property rules do not form a homogeneous class. 
</p>
<p>(It is true that even during Marx&rsquo;s time, the &ldquo;working class&rdquo; was neither uniform 
</p>
<p>nor harmonious, but rather a &ldquo;mobilizing myth.&rdquo;)71 While some of the people who 
</p>
<p>belong to this category are kept away from the raw materials and tools of the 
</p>
<p>knowledge economy, others, involved in the logic and the practices of cognitive 
</p>
<p>capitalism, contribute to its production and have thus the ability to turn its &ldquo;liber-
</p>
<p>ating power&rdquo; against exclusion.72
</p>
<p> Both the clever use of this liberating power and the formation of com-
</p>
<p>mon fronts between the various categories of those who suffer exclusion offer 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>314
</p>
<p>interesting avenues, especially in the context of the clash created by free-trade 
</p>
<p>agreements, to take advantage of a sort of recomposed class struggle that does 
</p>
<p>not involve the classic confrontations, but that allows politicization of the con-
</p>
<p>flicts that arise from appropriation and exclusion in the knowledge economy of the 
</p>
<p>information society.
</p>
<p>resistances
</p>
<p>Mobilizations against free-trade agreements have taken on significant dimensions 
</p>
<p>in many countries, bringing together people with HIV/AIDS, health defenders, 
</p>
<p>students, farmers, workers, academics, parliament members, local generic produc-
</p>
<p>ers, and, as in the Thai case, even bankers. In some countries, such as Thailand 
</p>
<p>or South Korea, these mobilizations were very well organized. In Thailand, strong 
</p>
<p>networks of collaboration were developed, sharing information and knowledge 
</p>
<p>and building collaborations with civil servants from various institutions, including 
</p>
<p>the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Ministry, and the Ministry of Com-
</p>
<p>merce. Over the past few years, public protests and demonstrations have taken 
</p>
<p>on increasingly sizeable proportions, and the issue of free-trade agreements has 
</p>
<p>become central in national political debates. However, mobilizations and public 
</p>
<p>opposition have failed to have a significant impact on the outcome of free-trade-
</p>
<p>agreement negotiations&mdash;TRIPS-plus provisions are still included, and agreements 
</p>
<p>continued to be signed.73
</p>
<p> What make the free-trade agreements such an efficient tool to promote neo-
</p>
<p>liberal objectives is inherent in their structural characteristics and the conditions 
</p>
<p>of their negotiations. Free-trade agreements are, as the U.S. trade representative 
</p>
<p>puts it, &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo;: They affect many different domains, from tariffs and 
</p>
<p>access to markets to sanitary measures, from trade remedies to the environment, 
</p>
<p>from investments to electronic commerce, from intellectual property to govern-
</p>
<p>ment procurement. As I noted before, U.S. trade partners agree to negotiate par-
</p>
<p>ticular aspects such as intellectual property&mdash;negotiations from which they have 
</p>
<p>little to expect for their own benefit, in most cases&mdash;and to adopt the views of 
</p>
<p>the United States because they are keen to obtain better tariffs and quotas for 
</p>
<p>the goods they export. In this context, it is difficult to give issues such as health 
</p>
<p>or education a high profile in negotiations when these are understood by politi-
</p>
<p>cal leaders to be secondary issues. And since the negotiations are kept secret, it 
</p>
<p>is also difficult for concerned actors to make their arguments heard about details 
</p>
<p>of agreements to which they have no access. Contrary to multilateral negotiations 
</p>
<p>such as the ones carried out at the WTO, countries cannot create alliances and 
</p>
<p>groups to confront the United States. The one-to-one power relation leaves the 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>315
</p>
<p>country negotiating with the United States at a disadvantage, not only because 
</p>
<p>of the political or economic power imbalance, but also because of the inequali-
</p>
<p>ties in terms of human and technical resources (expertise, knowledge, and expe-
</p>
<p>rience) that can be mobilized for the negotiations. As Drahos notes, &ldquo;In bilateral 
</p>
<p>trade negotiations between States involving a strong and weak State, generally 
</p>
<p>speaking the strong state comes along with a prepared draft text which acts as a 
</p>
<p>starting point for the negotiations. . . . In order to lower the transaction costs of 
</p>
<p>bilateralism the United States has developed models or prototypes of the kind of 
</p>
<p>bilateral treaties it wishes to have with other countries.&rdquo;74 Free-trade-agreement 
</p>
<p>talks also constitute an environment within which the use of fear, intimidation, 
</p>
<p>make-believe, and threats play a determinant role in the negotiation dynamic. In 
</p>
<p>this context, governments are all the more reluctant to take into account the opin-
</p>
<p>ions and requests of representatives of civil society.
</p>
<p> The majority of the movements that contest the increase in intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty protection, especially in the context of free-trade agreements, try to draw 
</p>
<p>attention to what they consider to be the abuses and dysfunctions of the intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property system. In most cases, they encourage countries to renounce 
</p>
<p>provisions that increase protections above WTO standards or they try to promote 
</p>
<p>compromises, such as the use of balancing mechanisms and softer provisions that 
</p>
<p>would not fatally impede access to knowledge and to knowledge goods, that would 
</p>
<p>limit the negative effects of what the United States requires. However, while they 
</p>
<p>focus on the issue of access, rarely do these movements openly question the prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of intellectual property or the concept of property itself. Their strategy con-
</p>
<p>sists mostly in demonstrating that, in a number of cases, the intellectual property 
</p>
<p>system fails to fulfill its role of promoting and fostering innovation, while with its 
</p>
<p>strengthening of protections it increasingly generates social costs and limitations 
</p>
<p>on development. Hence, they avoid taking stands that could be seen as ideologi-
</p>
<p>cally stained&mdash;as associated with attacks on property as such&mdash;which does not 
</p>
<p>prevent their detractors from calling them Communists.75 Apart from exceptions 
</p>
<p>such as popular political movements in opposition to free-trade agreements in Latin 
</p>
<p>America,76 the vast majority of those who have become mobilized on the issue of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property and free-trade agreements tend to stay away from political 
</p>
<p>and ideological rhetoric. While these movements strive to organize mass mobiliza-
</p>
<p>tion in order to affect the negotiation process and to impose resistance, their objec-
</p>
<p>tive is predominantly to make reasonable and constructive criticisms and proposi-
</p>
<p>tions about legal provisions and regulations in order to limit inequities, injustices, 
</p>
<p>and inefficiencies, rather than to announce the advent of a politico-economical 
</p>
<p>alternative model. Although free-trade agreements are obvious neoliberal vehicles, 
</p>
<p>these movements seem to avoid even using the term, as if by doing so they would 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>316
</p>
<p>engage in an ideological battle that would cast them as dogmatic and make them 
</p>
<p>lose credibility. They seek inclusionary politics, request their own participation into 
</p>
<p>the negotiations, and use a rhetoric that articulates demands for social justice, egal-
</p>
<p>itarian access, or plain decency, but that is predominantly anchored in a technical 
</p>
<p>register that allows them to assume the identity of experts on intellectual property 
</p>
<p>issues. One of the characteristics of these movements is to manifest a very detailed 
</p>
<p>understanding of the legal issues at stake and the legal instruments involved. They 
</p>
<p>can speak the language of copyright and patent lawyers. Their strategy is based on 
</p>
<p>democratizing this technical knowledge, and in some cases, a large public becomes 
</p>
<p>familiar with rather obscure legal concepts, as for example was the case in Thailand, 
</p>
<p>where activists made the slogan &ldquo;CL [compulsory licensing] = life&rdquo; the message on 
</p>
<p>a sticker spread widely throughout the country. Ironically, the pressure exerted to 
</p>
<p>increase intellectual property protection thus ultimately contributes to the increas-
</p>
<p>ing knowledge of members of civil society about intellectual property matters and 
</p>
<p>motivates their involvement with them.
</p>
<p> While it is the case that most movements do not openly and directly contest 
</p>
<p>the political ideology that underlies intellectual property regimes such as the 
</p>
<p>TRIPS Agreement or specifically denounce market ethics, and while resistance to 
</p>
<p>the escalation of intellectual property restrictions is rarely accompanied by formal 
</p>
<p>rejection of the neoliberal economic order or the institutions that favor it, ide-
</p>
<p>ology, as a &ldquo;narrative about a particular social order,&rdquo;77 is at the bottom of this 
</p>
<p>system and of its efficacy. First, factually, the context of international negotia-
</p>
<p>tions over intellectual property rights is deeply ideologically coded and interlinked 
</p>
<p>to the rise of neoliberalism. But moreover, &ldquo;the extraordinary power of ideology 
</p>
<p>itself,&rdquo; as Wendy Brown puts it, plays an important role: Ideology &ldquo;does not simply 
</p>
<p>(mis)represent the world, but is itself productive of the world, and particularly of 
</p>
<p>the subject.&rdquo;78 Thus, any attempt to fight avatars of neoliberal power such as the 
</p>
<p>increase of intellectual property rights and the privatization of knowledge requires 
</p>
<p>recognition of the way that ideology is used by the intellectual property move-
</p>
<p>ment. Building on the same impetus, it requires us to analyze and assess the modes 
</p>
<p>of legitimacy through which this movement naturalizes its domination and the 
</p>
<p>place and role that it ascribes to each of us.
</p>
<p> Pointing to inadequacies and tensions between the proclaimed values and the 
</p>
<p>concrete policies of neoliberalism may be a way to reach this goal and to under-
</p>
<p>mine its credibility. Neoliberalism encourages state intervention when the mar-
</p>
<p>ket itself generates chaos, a phenomenon regularly observed when financial cri-
</p>
<p>ses threaten financial institutions and losses are socialized as companies or banks 
</p>
<p>are bailed out with public money. However, state interventions and pragmatic 
</p>
<p>adjustments created to &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; firms tend to widen the gap between neoliberal 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>

</p>
<p>theory, as commonly espoused, and practice. One might expect that the disjunc-
</p>
<p>tion between what is understood as neoliberalism in the conventional wisdom and 
</p>
<p>disseminated through propaganda and the reality of the policies that neoliberals 
</p>
<p>have implemented might, by hint of repetition and because of the increasing pro-
</p>
<p>portion of the consequences, create rifts in representations of neoliberal dogma 
</p>
<p>and undermine neoliberal fictions. Nevertheless, despite many indicators that neo-
</p>
<p>liberal doctrine is not fulfilling its promises to secure economic efficiency,79 the 
</p>
<p>lessons taught by such empirical realities do not appear to be learned, nor is the 
</p>
<p>enthusiasm or zeal of neoliberals undermined. A further effort is required.
</p>
<p> Such an effort might suggest that critics of increasing intellectual property 
</p>
<p>protection should try to oppose one ideology with another and develop a coun-
</p>
<p>terideology to substitute for the dominant one. However, besides the reluctance 
</p>
<p>to promote ideologies that is common to many social movements&mdash;inherited from 
</p>
<p>the critical disenchantment with Communism and socialism that spread since the 
</p>
<p>end of the Cold War and that was influenced and encouraged by the denuncia-
</p>
<p>tions led by neoliberals against these ideologies&mdash;alternative doctrines have not in 
</p>
<p>fact emerged that could directly compete with neoliberalism.80 If opposition move-
</p>
<p>ments do not want to rely on ideologies, other framing techniques and strategies 
</p>
<p>need to be employed to produce cultural changes that could undermine neoliberal 
</p>
<p>legitimacy and supremacy in people&rsquo;s minds.
</p>
<p> Neoliberal discursive productions borrow terms from classical liberalism such as 
</p>
<p>the central place of the notion of freedom while simultaneously both feeding and 
</p>
<p>concealing existing tensions between liberalism and neoliberalism, thus sustaining 
</p>
<p>confusion and making it difficult to delegitimize neoliberalism on the basis of inter-
</p>
<p>nal contradictions and gaps between theory and practice. This is one of the particu-
</p>
<p>larities and one of the sources of the efficacy of neoliberalism: to be able to offer a 
</p>
<p>fiction that can seem coherent and that at the same time integrates contradictions 
</p>
<p>and discrepancies that give it the malleability that allows its strength and durability.
</p>
<p> One way to break the spell of neoliberalism lies in questioning its use of the 
</p>
<p>values and concepts that underlie it and in trying to reinvest these values and 
</p>
<p>concept with other meanings. Such an approach seems consistent with those 
</p>
<p>employed by the movements opposing high levels of protection for intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights that, beyond ideology, try to promote basic principles such 
</p>
<p>as freedom, equality, justice or organizing concepts such as the commons and 
</p>
<p>the public domain and that, for the most part, instead of contesting the principle 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property itself, use the fulcrum of access strategically to reframe 
</p>
<p>the terms of the debate. Moreover, the context of the debates and conflicts over 
</p>
<p>intellectual property appears to be favorable. It is large enough, since it affects so 
</p>
<p>many aspects of peoples lives, well-being, and destiny, yet specific enough, since 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>318
</p>
<p>it implicates a multitude of communities, identities, and particular interests from 
</p>
<p>every corners of society, to support an attempt to initiate a process that explores a 
</p>
<p>new balance between freedom and property or the relation between freedom and 
</p>
<p>equality&mdash;to imagine a new blueprint for society.
</p>
<p> The inadequacies and tensions between the proclaimed values and the con-
</p>
<p>crete policies of neoliberalism are at least a part of this favorable context. Pro-
</p>
<p>voking the emergence of global crises whose dimensions are unprecedented and 
</p>
<p>whose causes and consequences are more difficult to control, neoliberalism is 
</p>
<p>increasingly showing signs of its failures to guarantee economic activity and sus-
</p>
<p>tain the market. Neoliberal legitimacy may finally be ripe to be called into ques-
</p>
<p>tion at a time when &ldquo;the widening gap between rhetoric (for the benefit of all) 
</p>
<p>and realization (the benefit of a small ruling class) [becomes] all too visible.&rdquo;81 It 
</p>
<p>may increasingly be possible to make effective use of the paradoxes and contradic-
</p>
<p>tions between classical liberal orthodoxy and neoliberalism. And when neoliberal 
</p>
<p>policies depart so obviously from the obligation to respect neutrality, equity, and 
</p>
<p>inclusion that are supposed to characterize a liberal government&mdash;not to influence 
</p>
<p>competition and to provide to each one the opportunity to take part in it&mdash;using 
</p>
<p>classical liberal principles against neoliberalism can be an effective way to under-
</p>
<p>mine neoliberalism&rsquo;s pervasive representations and apparent coherence in the  
</p>
<p>conventional wisdom.82
</p>
<p> Liberalism in its classical form and freedom are two concepts that had a seminal 
</p>
<p>and organizing importance in political debates and choices in the United States and 
</p>
<p>are key notions publicized by neoliberalism. As Wendy Brown emphasizes, &ldquo;&lsquo;free-
</p>
<p>dom&rsquo; has shown itself to be easily appropriated in liberal regimes for the most 
</p>
<p>cynical and unemancipatory political ends.&rdquo; Certainly, &ldquo;the conservative political 
</p>
<p>culture ascendant in the United States in the 1980s . . . further narrowed the mean-
</p>
<p>ing of freedom within liberalism&rsquo;s already narrow account.&rdquo;83 Semantic shifts and 
</p>
<p>reinterpretations, depending on the historical context and the use made of these 
</p>
<p>terms, maintain ambiguities and confusions. Consequently, there is a risk that 
</p>
<p>movements trying to reappropriate these concepts will fail to make clear the dif-
</p>
<p>ference between what they promote and what their opponents invoke, and, con-
</p>
<p>trary to their attempts to offer a counterpoint to neoliberal presentations, may 
</p>
<p>reinforce the power of the neoliberal discourse by giving additional legitimacy 
</p>
<p>to the concepts upon which it is based. Moreover, reclaiming the classical liberal 
</p>
<p>inheritance without adopting a clear position critical of neoliberalism risks main-
</p>
<p>taining the given conditions of neoliberal ascendance insofar that their theoretical 
</p>
<p>bases remain grounded in the same ethos.
</p>
<p> Freedom of expression and consumer choice, both classical liberal values, 
</p>
<p>are seriously limited in the current world of intellectual property protection.

</p>
<p>Contesting those limits call for enlightening the public about the confusions that 
</p>
<p>neoliberalism has perpetuated concerning the classical liberal conception of free-
</p>
<p>dom. It may also require us to explore other frames of reference, questioning 
</p>
<p>the definition and the meaning of the freedoms one wants to promote. If we fol-
</p>
<p>low Michel Foucault&rsquo;s advice, freedom can be understood as a (political) practice 
</p>
<p>for individuals, a mode of relation between individuals, that empowers them.84 
</p>
<p>Contrary to the tendency that Brown observes among thinkers who came to the 
</p>
<p>conclusion that free enterprise is the most valid and worthy option of freedom, 
</p>
<p>movements opposed to neoliberalism can adopt freedom as &ldquo;a social and political 
</p>
<p>practice,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;an individual good,&rdquo; and thus move away from its rendering 
</p>
<p>in classical liberal thought.85
</p>
<p> In the context of the knowledge economy, understood this way, freedom looks 
</p>
<p>like what pirates exercise when using, creating, or spreading material or immaterial 
</p>
<p>goods.86 Put into practice, this freedom represents a form of resistance that may 
</p>
<p>stand &ldquo;in a position of exteriority to power,&rdquo; 87 interfering to some extent with 
</p>
<p>the political economy of neoliberal domination by promoting uncontrolled access, 
</p>
<p>neither absolving the state of its responsibility to ensure the well-being of its citi-
</p>
<p>zens and to provide justice nor supplanting the need for fair administrative and 
</p>
<p>legal systems to encourage innovation, but able to open breaches on some of the 
</p>
<p>fronts of neoliberal rationality. Meanwhile, while obviously interfering with the 
</p>
<p>logic of distribution, such a practice moves the issue of inequality to the level of 
</p>
<p>production, questioning and disrupting old models&mdash;including the production of 
</p>
<p>the self&mdash;and injecting anarchically the production of individuals into the public 
</p>
<p>space.88 Like the mechanical arts as described by Jacques Ranci&egrave;re, digital tech-
</p>
<p>nologies, when &ldquo;put into practice and recognized as something other than tech-
</p>
<p>niques of reproduction or transmission,&rdquo; hold the power to &ldquo;confer visibility on 
</p>
<p>the masses, or rather on anonymous individuals.&rdquo; What emerges then are &ldquo;political 
</p>
<p>subjects that challenge the given distribution of the sensible.&rdquo;89
</p>
<p> But what are the conditions required to exercise this freedom? Who is in a 
</p>
<p>position to do so? Or in other words, is the exercise of this freedom possible for 
</p>
<p>those&mdash;who may be a majority&mdash;who are subjected to great social and economical 
</p>
<p>inequalities, or would it represent too many risks and increase their vulnerability? 
</p>
<p>Those are valid questions. Meanwhile, one may also note that for many reasons 
</p>
<p>(from economic conditions to social conditions), the pirate attitude is found more 
</p>
<p>frequently among those who reckon they have nothing to lose and everything to 
</p>
<p>gain from being pirates, those who, by obligation and in some cases by choice, are 
</p>
<p>at the peripheries and even the extreme peripheries of power spheres, rather than 
</p>
<p>those who are close to their cores.90 To this extent, the sociology of this practice 
</p>
<p>may contradict the sociology of the current A2K movement. One may wonder if 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>320
</p>
<p>that creates a real antagonism between the practice of the pirate and the efforts of 
</p>
<p>the movement.
</p>
<p> As Lawrence Liang notes, the figure of the pirate provokes serious tensions 
</p>
<p>within the A2K movement and within movements that oppose stricter exclu-
</p>
<p>sive rights protections.91 To adopt or at least to consider as legitimate a practice 
</p>
<p>of freedom inspired by the pirate, that is, as not taken as a pure matter of con-
</p>
<p>sumption, can certainly pose some paradoxes for these movements. Notably it 
</p>
<p>may eventually call for clarifications as far as their relations with the neoliberal 
</p>
<p>regime are concerned. However, without focusing on such tensions and conflicts, 
</p>
<p>it is certainly possible for the movements to take the pirate for what he or she 
</p>
<p>can provoke, for the &ldquo;discontinuity in our experience&rdquo; that pirates introduce in our 
</p>
<p>encounters and relations with them. In short, it is possible to welcome the original 
</p>
<p>reorganization of our conceptions, spaces, and relations that may emerge from this 
</p>
<p>experience. As Maurizio Lazzarato points out, &ldquo;one falls in love less with the per-
</p>
<p>son than with the possible world she expresses.&rdquo;92 Likewise, without necessarily 
</p>
<p>falling for the pirate&rsquo;s personality as a whole or the totality of the existing forms 
</p>
<p>of piracy, without considering his or her modus vivendi or modus operandi as a 
</p>
<p>solution in itself, we can consider the options that the pirate offers and that bor-
</p>
<p>rowing from the pirate&rsquo;s practices could generate.93 From the practices it inspires 
</p>
<p>could come new possibilities, &ldquo;virtuals,&rdquo; Gilles Deleuze would call them; allow-
</p>
<p>ing recruitment at the frontiers of classes, where inequalities are made obvious 
</p>
<p>by deprivation, where opposites confront each other (worker/capitalist, owners/
</p>
<p>exploited) at the &ldquo;locus of the fight,&rdquo; and where conflicts crystallize and injustices 
</p>
<p>are denounced. It is there where an &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; may take place to the possibil-
</p>
<p>ity of refusing the roles and models that are assigned to everyone, the functions 
</p>
<p>required from each, and where instead it may be possible to develop, reinforce, 
</p>
<p>and exercise the power of innovation that individuals possess and that can chal-
</p>
<p>lenge institutionalized powers.
</p>
<p> Without romanticizing or overrating the subversive power of piracy, and while 
</p>
<p>asserting that piracy cannot be the only strategy adopted to address extrem-
</p>
<p>ist regimes of intellectual property rights protection and repression, the differ-
</p>
<p>ent forms of political action and personal input that exist in piracy should not be 
</p>
<p>dismissed (as they regularly are) because they remain in the shadow, or because 
</p>
<p>they are too sporadic, or because they are done for self-gain. They instead can 
</p>
<p>be seen as an opportunity to introduce useful disruptions from both a tactical 
</p>
<p>and a theoretical point of view&mdash;even as a necessary strategy for doing so. This 
</p>
<p>may look particularly appealing if one considers that protests against increasing 
</p>
<p>and extremist intellectual property rights protections often lead to bureaucratic 
</p>
<p>and heavily regulated adjustments to the prevailing regime. Think, for example, 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>321
</p>
<p>of the mechanism adopted at the WTO to allow generic export of patented medi-
</p>
<p>cines under compulsory licensing or the prequalification procedure established at 
</p>
<p>the WHO to guarantee generic quality and thus trivialize the heavy propaganda 
</p>
<p>against generic drugs conducted by the multinational pharmaceutical corpora-
</p>
<p>tions. Practices inspired by the pirates may also help make obvious the realities 
</p>
<p>of the new era of digital production, the conflicts it has caused, and the inequali-
</p>
<p>ties institutionalized by the current intellectual property system and by the ten-
</p>
<p>dency to increase those protections. Moreover, the resulting forms of resistance 
</p>
<p>can combine with creative processes that can be directly invested by individuals 
</p>
<p>and that can favor invention outside of the walls of the increasingly closed intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property regime. In doing so, individuals also generate the power that the 
</p>
<p>movement needs to shape and conceptualize the freedom they try to exercise. For 
</p>
<p>their part, the intellectual property moguls are not fooled and seem aware of these 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;virtuals.&rdquo; Hence their increasing pressure to enforce intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>and to criminalize those who infringe them.94
</p>
<p> What could thus emerge in the context of the fight against free-trade agree-
</p>
<p>ments is the constitution of a common front against intellectual property protec-
</p>
<p>tion policies, allying forms of activism such as the practices of piracy that have 
</p>
<p>developed under the pressure of exploitation and expropriation typical of the neo-
</p>
<p>liberal order or of cognitive capitalism with others inherited from the industrial 
</p>
<p>era. Mobilizations against free-trade agreements such as those that took place in 
</p>
<p>Thailand, South Korea, and some Latin American countries already show interest-
</p>
<p>ing alliances between worker-based movements and more classically liberal forms 
</p>
<p>of activism. Traditional worker-based movements are often presented as declining, 
</p>
<p>and these forms of mobilization have indeed been deeply affected by neoliberal 
</p>
<p>offensives since the end of the 1970s, particularly in developed countries. How-
</p>
<p>ever, similar movements arose during the 1980s in countries such as South Korea 
</p>
<p>or South Africa and are particularly active in Latin America, to the point where 
</p>
<p>they sometimes have taken power. In South Korea, Thailand, and Latin America, 
</p>
<p>they have also been an important component of mobilizations against free-trade 
</p>
<p>agreements in alliance with various components of civil society that rely on other 
</p>
<p>forms of mobilization and contestation. While worker-based mobilizations follow 
</p>
<p>the models of traditional political structure and organization, which allow them to 
</p>
<p>provoke massive mobilizations across countries, other forms of mobilization show 
</p>
<p>an ability simultaneously to address both technical and legal issues and the needs 
</p>
<p>of a large spectrum of different social groups and particular constituencies not 
</p>
<p>identified with or defined by their work.
</p>
<p> Traditional forms reactivated in the context of the neoliberal restructuring of 
</p>
<p>classes thus can combine with forms of protest that originate in sections of the 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements and neoliberalism</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>322
</p>
<p>society involved in knowledge production (and more imbued with the classical 
</p>
<p>liberal political tradition). As I said before, some of these actors are not always 
</p>
<p>replaceable because of their creative potential, and as a consequence, their rec-
</p>
<p>ognized position as key elements in the creation of knowledge goods confers on 
</p>
<p>them a special&mdash;legitimized&mdash;position as critics of its distribution, but, above all, 
</p>
<p>as efficient creators who can fuel new movements. Although they develop argu-
</p>
<p>ments against the terms of the commodification, privatization, and financialization 
</p>
<p>of knowledge goods that do not necessarily place them outside of the realm of the 
</p>
<p>dominant political system, and although they do not reject as a whole the modes 
</p>
<p>of consumption and trade that go with capitalism, by engaging in reinterpretation 
</p>
<p>or redefinition of notions that are at the heart of the system that justifies neolib-
</p>
<p>eralism, they may institute new forms of adverse interaction with it. By engaging 
</p>
<p>in a routine practice of freedom, these alliances may help unleash practices that 
</p>
<p>could override the boundaries of the enclosures imposed by intellectual property 
</p>
<p>protection,95 favoring the learning of knowledge, the empowerment and a bet-
</p>
<p>ter equalization of access to opportunities, while they also contribute to opening 
</p>
<p>breaches to a counterculture.
</p>
<p> Without considering strategies based on class struggle as obsolete or sim-
</p>
<p>ply renouncing them, the alliance of those who directly challenge competition 
</p>
<p>and private property and condemn the resulting alienations, those who promote 
</p>
<p>new forms of collaboration between individuals, new forms of work and creation 
</p>
<p>using knowledge technologies, and those who, inspired by the practices of pirates, 
</p>
<p>engage in practices of freedom that disrupt neoliberal rules of appropriation and 
</p>
<p>the control of access could result in the increase tenfold of the power of an A2K 
</p>
<p>movement. Neoliberalism by virtue of the inequalities and discriminations it pro-
</p>
<p>duces will thus have favored the emergence of a contestation specific to it,96 and 
</p>
<p>an A2K mobilization using every available tactic and strategy could organize itself 
</p>
<p>as a creative force challenging knowledge capitalism and contributing to its reorga-
</p>
<p>nization. Reactions to the escalation of protections on intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>and to the intensification of the repression of intellectual property infringements, 
</p>
<p>whether they are formally gathered under the A2K umbrella or not (or not yet), 
</p>
<p>hold the seeds that could realize this efflorescence and thus help show a way out 
</p>
<p>to the neoliberal order, which is certainly as rigid as it is unstable.

</p>
<p>example, in the context of the 301 process, the U.S. administration is not ready to become 
</p>
<p>totally dependent on or indentured to industry. It still has, to some extent, to take into

<p>account its image abroad and to preserve relations with other countries from seeming too

</p>
<p>65 The notion of &ldquo;cognitive capitalism&rdquo; was developed by Yann Moulier Boutang in a series of 
</p>
<p>articles published in the journal Multitudes and later gathered and elaborated in Le capital-
</p>
<p>isme cognitif (Paris: &Eacute;ditions Amsterdam, 2007). Cognitive capitalism is based on the accumu-
</p>
<p>lation of immaterial capital. The management of knowledge and of information technologies 
</p>
<p>to control all forms of production and accumulation, whether it is selling wheat on the market 
</p>
<p>or stock exchange transactions, is at the heart of cognitive capitalism. One of the elements 
</p>
<p>that manifests the emergence of this new form of capitalism is the importance that issues of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protection have taken in the past decades, together with the tensions 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>327
</p>
<p>that came along with the increase in these protections (p. 73). Industrial capitalism is not dis-
</p>
<p>appearing, but coexists with this new form and is reconfigured by it&mdash;relocated, reorganized, 
</p>
<p>become subaltern (p. 74). For many people, including workers whose job is still to transform 
</p>
<p>material resources into material goods, the accumulation of immaterial capital essential to 
</p>
<p>cognitive capitalism is often prohibited by interdiction of access to and free use of knowledge 
</p>
<p>through the enforcement of intellectual property protections and the criminalization of vio-
</p>
<p>lations of intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>66 Sean M. Flynn shows how in highly unequal society, &ldquo;the legal right creates rational eco-
</p>
<p>nomic incentives to price the vast majority of consumers out of access.&rdquo; See his essay, &ldquo;Using 
</p>
<p>Competition Law to Promote Access to Knowledge,&rdquo; in this volume.
</p>
<p>67 In the best-case scenario, under license, some are allowed to make a controlled use of the 
</p>
<p>knowledge needed to reproduce goods.
</p>
<p>68 Free and unrestricted access by the multitude to a product de facto leads to the dismantling 
</p>
<p>of the rules of valuation and even of the empire of property, since it takes away from prop-
</p>
<p>erty the power that it confers on the owner. See the interesting discussions by Pierre Zaoui 
</p>

<p>73 At the time this article was written, however, U.S. trade negotiations were seriously slowed

<p>down. Indeed, the fast-track procedure, which was in effect from 1975 to 1994 and which was 
</p>
<p>restored in 2002, had expired on July 1, 2007. The U.S. trade representative needs to wait for

<p>its restoration before starting intensive bilateral negotiations again.

<p>75 This is not a new tactic. Drahos recalls that at the time when the developing countries had

<p>have favored them more than the existing international intellectual property rules, repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives of industry, namely the chairman and president of Pfizer International, did not 
</p>
<p>hesitate to define the organization &ldquo;as the representative of &lsquo;international socialism&rsquo; when it

<p>76 Whether it was against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Free Trade

<p>Area of the Americas (FTAA), CAFTA or the FTA between the Andean countries and the

<p>US, Latin America has been the scene of important popular political mobilizations against 
</p>
<p>trade agreements and denunciations of neoliberal policies. The Zapatistas, the landless peas-
</p>
<p>ant movement in Brazil, the indigenous movements of Bolivia and Ecuador, the unemployed 
</p>
<p>workers&rsquo; activists in Argentina (piqueteros), and many others rallied against FTAs. The issue 
</p>
<p>of the FTAs became a polarizing issue in national political debates, including during presi-
</p>
<p>dential elections (Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador). Demonstrations, massive in some cases, were 
</p>
<p>organized in many countries (Costa Rica, Peru, El Salvador, Guatemala, Bolivia, Colombia,

</p>
<p>80 Latin American movements opposing free-trade agreements are in some cases close to center 
</p>
<p>and left coalitions that are in power and govern. They are critical of neoliberalism and draw 
</p>
<p>their political agendas from the traditional left. Some rely on Communist and socialist ideolo-

<p>Information/Knowledge		
</p>
<p>in	the	Global	Society	of	Control:		
</p>
<p>A2K	Theory	and	the	Postcolonial	Commons
</p>
<p>Jeffrey	Atteberry
</p>
<p>The international intellectual property regime has approached a historical, politi-
</p>
<p>cal, and legal conjuncture whose negotiation will crucially affect the distribution of 
</p>
<p>both knowledge and surplus value in the emerging globalized system of informa-
</p>
<p>tional capitalism.1 The access to knowledge movement (A2K) has emerged in this 
</p>
<p>context as a force advocating fundamental changes in the international intellectual 
</p>
<p>property regime. An important, if not central component of A2K theory has been 
</p>
<p>its support for an information commons. As the A2K movement has become global-
</p>
<p>ized, it has increasingly identified its promotion of an information commons with 
</p>
<p>the interests of the developing world. Many critics, however, have begun to reflect 
</p>
<p>upon various tensions between an A2K model of development and the proposals 
</p>
<p>of other reform movements within international intellectual property circles. The 
</p>
<p>most notable, perhaps, are the latent tensions between A2K and the movement 
</p>
<p>to protect so-called &ldquo;traditional knowledge.&rdquo;2 In short, while the concept of the 
</p>
<p>commons implies a certain curtailment of property rights, many proposals for the 
</p>
<p>protection of traditional knowledge imply the creation of new property rights.
</p>
<p> These tensions might begin to be resolved, I would suggest, by a critical assess-
</p>
<p>ment of the concept of the commons. Despite the importance of the information 
</p>
<p>commons to A2K&rsquo;s discourse, however, there has been scant theoretical work on 
</p>
<p>the material and ideological importance of the commons to the historical devel-
</p>
<p>opment of colonialism. Such a perspective will become ever more important as 
</p>
<p>the A2K movement progressively networks with a number of other movements 
</p>
<p>that have emerged from the legacy of colonialism and that continue the struggle 
</p>
<p>against it in its various new guises. Without a theoretical awareness of how the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement&rsquo;s own discourse is rooted in this history, the movement runs the 
</p>
<p>risk&mdash;despite its best intentions&mdash;of becoming ideologically conscripted by the 
</p>
<p>forces of informational imperialism, rather than resisting them.</p>

</p>
<p> At present, a latent tension lurks between the A2K movement&rsquo;s theoretical and 
</p>
<p>political practices. This tension results, I suggest, at least in part from an insuffi-
</p>
<p>ciently critical relationship to the historical and social context of the movement&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>own formation. Socially, the bulk of A2K theory has been articulated from within 
</p>
<p>the Global North, where the transformations attending the emergence of the infor-
</p>
<p>mation economy have reached practically all levels of society. The A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment&rsquo;s theoretical resources have, in significant part, been drawn from the liberal 
</p>
<p>traditions of law and political economy. Moreover, the development of A2K theory 
</p>
<p>has been informed by the emergence of open-source software and the changes in 
</p>
<p>the social relations of production wrought by peer-to-peer networking. In short, 
</p>
<p>the production of digital goods presents the possibility of an alternative to the 
</p>
<p>traditional commodity production that has characterized industrial capitalism. At 
</p>
<p>present, however, these transformations also have been centered on the whole in 
</p>
<p>the Global North. As A2K groups have sought to coordinate and consolidate their 
</p>
<p>critiques in a global context, voices emanating from other critical traditions have 
</p>
<p>begun to be heard within the A2K movement, and the movement has politically 
</p>
<p>aligned itself on numerous fronts with various groups from the developing world. 
</p>
<p>In order to forge truly progressive alliances as it enters this global terrain, the A2K 
</p>
<p>movement needs to develop a critical understanding of the ideological roles its 
</p>
<p>own theoretical resources have played in the historical struggle that the movement 
</p>
<p>is now entering.
</p>
<p> The A2K movement has come to use &ldquo;the commons&rdquo;&mdash;a theoretical construct 
</p>
<p>with a long ideological history rooted in the development of capitalist imperial-
</p>
<p>ism&mdash;as a figure for representing the interests of the developing world. In such 
</p>
<p>situations, Gayatri Spivak tells us that two &ldquo;irreducibly discontinuous&rdquo; senses of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;representation&rdquo; must be rigorously tracked: &ldquo;representation as &lsquo;speaking for,&rsquo; as 
</p>
<p>in politics, and representation as &lsquo;re-presentation,&rsquo; as in art or philosophy.&rdquo;3 In 
</p>
<p>speaking for the subaltern, the First World intellectual necessarily re-presents her 
</p>
<p>as an object of discourse. The subaltern appears in the form of a figure. A danger 
</p>
<p>then lurks in ignoring &ldquo;this double session of representations,&rdquo; the danger of fail-
</p>
<p>ing to recognize the figures as &ldquo;subject formations that micrologically and often 
</p>
<p>erratically operate the interests that congeal the macrologies.&rdquo;4 Spivak&rsquo;s basic 
</p>
<p>point, despite its philosophically dense expression, is one that is familiar to us in 
</p>
<p>other guises. For example, relationships of representation (such as that between 
</p>
<p>a lawyer and a client) are necessarily fraught with ethical perils. Those dangers 
</p>
<p>are only magnified when (as with class-action lawsuits or certain public-interest 
</p>
<p>legal practices) the representative is in effect self-appointed. In these situations, a 
</p>
<p>panoply of possible subterfuges may subvert the process, despite the best inten-
</p>
<p>tions of everyone involved.</p>
<p/>

<p>a2k theory and the postcolonial commons 331
</p>
<p> The basic lesson is the same when one leaves the confines of the law for the 
</p>
<p>realm of global politics, even if the mechanics of the problem are more complex 
</p>
<p>and the play of forces more subtle. The subterfuge lurks in the figures of repre-
</p>
<p>sentation themselves, that is, the discourse that is used by the self-appointed 
</p>
<p>representative to represent the represented. Without a critical reflection on the  
</p>
<p>ideological character of our own discourse, we risk not understanding how our 
</p>
<p>figures of representation are historically produced within the global structures 
</p>
<p>of power and therefore not understanding how they are potentially recuperable 
</p>
<p>within them. In other words, we run the risk of confusing, in Louis Althusser&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>terms, the &ldquo;object of knowledge&rdquo; with the &ldquo;real object.&rdquo;5 These figures are the 
</p>
<p>products of a social and historical reality that stamps them with the ideological 
</p>
<p>imprimatur of their production. As a result, conceptual figures that would appear 
</p>
<p>to be full of critical potential are continually, if not immediately, reappropriated 
</p>
<p>by the dominant ideology and deployed to restore the existing hegemony within a 
</p>
<p>historically new social formation.6 This process is inevitable, because it is nothing 
</p>
<p>less than the material history of ideologies as such. In the case of the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment, the concern then becomes how the figure of the commons may ideologically 
</p>
<p>operate to reinscribe the movement&rsquo;s efforts to represent the developing world 
</p>
<p>within the ongoing historical development of capitalist imperialism.
</p>
<p> The successful negotiation of the current moment therefore requires a histo-
</p>
<p>ricized discursive analysis of the conceptual terms shaping the present struggle 
</p>
<p>over the international intellectual property regime. In &ldquo;Can the Subaltern Speak?&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Spivak&rsquo;s reading of the sati (the ritually self-sacrificing widow) demonstrates how, 
</p>
<p>in legally abolishing the practice, the British produced a figure of the subaltern 
</p>
<p>woman who needed the protection of the British state apparatus. The appearance 
</p>
<p>of the sati within the British cultural and legal imagination, Spivak contends, &ldquo;has a 
</p>
<p>clear and complex relationship with the changeover from a mercantile and commer-
</p>
<p>cial to a territorial and administrative British presence&rdquo; in India.7 The figure of the 
</p>
<p>sati emerged at a moment when the basic structures of the British colonial project 
</p>
<p>were changing. Widow sacrifice was abolished in 1827.8 At the same moment, the 
</p>
<p>East India Company was in the process of losing its monopoly control over India.9
</p>
<p> The transition from the colonial rule of the East India Company to the estab-
</p>
<p>lishment of the British Empire was accompanied by a corresponding shift in the 
</p>
<p>discursive strategies of legitimation, a shift from a rhetoric of profit to one of civi-
</p>
<p>lizing humanitarianism and enlightened legal order.10 The figure of the sati was one 
</p>
<p>discursive fulcrum advancing this transition. Through the figure of sati, &ldquo;Imperial-
</p>
<p>ism&rsquo;s image as the establisher of the good society is marked by the espousal of the 
</p>
<p>woman as object of protection from her own kind.&rdquo;11 The ideological persistence of 
</p>
<p>this figure (sati) and the object of knowledge/protection that it created (the &ldquo;Third </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>332
</p>
<p>World woman&rdquo;) continues to shape relations between the Global North and South 
</p>
<p>as patriarchal in character. Similarly, in the current moment, the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>represents the object of its protection as the &ldquo;public domain,&rdquo; which is theoreti-
</p>
<p>cally conceptualized through the figure of &ldquo;the commons.&rdquo; The &ldquo;commons,&rdquo; how-
</p>
<p>ever, has a complex historical relationship with capitalist imperialism. The critical 
</p>
<p>issue, therefore, is how the persistence of the commons within the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment&rsquo;s theoretical discourse may unintentionally continue the ideological work of 
</p>
<p>historically reproducing the colonizer-colonized relationship in a manner that is 
</p>
<p>consistent with the relations of production that characterize our current globalized 
</p>
<p>order or information imperialism.
</p>
<p>historicizing enclosure
</p>
<p>One of the defining tropes of the A2K movement has come to be &ldquo;the second 
</p>
<p>enclosure of the commons.&rdquo; Expressing a concern over intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>English colonies (The Granger Collection).

</p>
<p>encroaching upon territory that had previously been considered safely a part of 
</p>
<p>the public domain, a number of scholars began to employ the figure of an &ldquo;enclo-
</p>
<p>sure of the commons&rdquo; to discuss this trend.12 The analogy serves an important 
</p>
<p>critical function in revealing the fundamental role that intellectual property plays 
</p>
<p>in the development of informational capital. At the same time, however, the trope 
</p>
<p>of a new &ldquo;enclosure of the commons&rdquo; works a potentially mystifying ideological 
</p>
<p>effect on the A2K movement when it engages the political economy of global-
</p>
<p>ized informational capital. As James Boyle explains, the first enclosure movement, 
</p>
<p>which took place in stages in England from the fifteenth to the nineteenth centu-
</p>
<p>ries, was the long historical &ldquo;process of fencing off common land and turning it into 
</p>
<p>private property.&rdquo;13 The analogy from the current moment to the historical enclo-
</p>
<p>sure of the commons rests upon the observation that &ldquo;once again things that were 
</p>
<p>formerly thought of as either common property or uncommodifiable are being cov-
</p>
<p>ered with new, or newly extended, property rights.&rdquo;14 As a general proposition, 
</p>
<p>this comparison is true enough, but when pursued with a historically informed 
</p>
<p>rigor, the analogy of the &ldquo;second enclosure movement&rdquo; reveals deeper ambiguities 
</p>
<p>within the current historical moment with which A2K theory must contend.
</p>
<p> A rigorous treatment of the analogy reveals the central role of the current 
</p>
<p>intellectual property regime in the development of the informationalist mode 
</p>
<p>of capitalist production. The English enclosure movement is the subject of some 
</p>
<p>of the most dramatic pages of Marx&rsquo;s Capital. Marx describes in great detail the 
</p>
<p>violent processes, both legal and extralegal, through which &ldquo;the proletariat [was] 
</p>
<p>created by the breaking-up of the bands of feudal retainers and by the forcible 
</p>
<p>expropriation of the people from the soil.&rdquo;15 In the structure of Marx&rsquo;s argument, 
</p>
<p>the English enclosure movement serves as the paradigmatic example of a more 
</p>
<p>general process that Marx calls &ldquo;primitive accumulation [urspr&uuml;ngliche Akkumula-
</p>
<p>tion].&rdquo;16 This process creates the necessary preconditions for the establishment of 
</p>
<p>capitalist relations of production. European society transitioned from feudalism to 
</p>
<p>capitalism through the process of primitive accumulation. As Marx explains,&ldquo; The 
</p>
<p>capital-relation presupposes a complete separation between the workers and the 
</p>
<p>ownership of the conditions for the realization of their labor. As soon as capital-
</p>
<p>ist production stands on its own feet, it not only maintains this separation, but 
</p>
<p>reproduces it on a constantly extending scale. . . . So-called primitive accumulation, 
</p>
<p>therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer 
</p>
<p>from the means of production.&rdquo;17
</p>
<p> Through the enclosure movement, the feudal peasantry was transformed into the 
</p>
<p>wage-earning proletariat by being dispossessed of their communal property rights 
</p>
<p>in the commons. As such, primitive accumulation creates the basic social relations 
</p>
<p>that form the basis of capitalist production. Marx stresses, however, that the term 
</p>
<p>a2k theory and the postcolonial commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>334
</p>
<p>urspr&uuml;ngliche, which is typically translated not as &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; but &ldquo;original,&rdquo; should 
</p>
<p>not be understood as designating a process that is simply relegated to the prehistory 
</p>
<p>of capitalism. Rather, it is a process that, once begun, capitalism must continually 
</p>
<p>reproduce and repeat on more levels as capitalism territorializes ever new terrain.
</p>
<p> In this respect, the &ldquo;second enclosure movement&rdquo; is more than an analogy 
</p>
<p>to the first; it is the reproduction of the same historical process on an extended 
</p>
<p>scale as capitalism transitions into an informationalist mode of development and 
</p>
<p>submits the &ldquo;intangible commons of the mind&rdquo; to its inexorable logic.18 Just as 
</p>
<p>the historical enclosure movement transferred real property, which provided the 
</p>
<p>raw materials for production, into the hands of the emerging bourgeoisie, the cur-
</p>
<p>rent expansion of intellectual property protections is having the similar effect of 
</p>
<p>concentrating control over information, which is the raw material for production 
</p>
<p>in the informational age. From patents on the human genome,19 and from busi-
</p>
<p>ness methods to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Trademark Dilution 
</p>
<p>Revision Act,20 the scope and strength of intellectual property keeps expanding in 
</p>
<p>ways that separate the means of knowledge production from the greater portion of 
</p>
<p>the people.21 In deploying the figure of a &ldquo;second enclosure movement&rdquo; as a rhe-
</p>
<p>torical way of deploring the expansion of intellectual property rights, therefore, 
</p>
<p>those who use the figure imagine themselves, at least implicitly, on the side of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marx&rdquo; against the violent and unjust of effects of subjecting the realm of knowl-
</p>
<p>edge production to a capitalist regime of private property. The danger, however, is 
</p>
<p>that this self-image, as long as it remains uncritical, may not end up corresponding 
</p>
<p>in material fact to the position that the A2K movement&rsquo;s theory may otherwise 
</p>
<p>prescribe for it. This risk is nothing other than the ever-present problem of ideo-
</p>
<p>logical inscription in the strictest Althusserian sense.22
</p>
<p> Precisely because primitive accumulation is an ongoing process at the heart of 
</p>
<p>the continual reproduction of the capitalist mode of production, Marx does not 
</p>
<p>limit his exposition of primitive accumulation to a historical depiction of the enclo-
</p>
<p>sure movement in England. Whereas Part VIII of Capital, titled &ldquo;The So-Called 
</p>
<p>Primitive Accumulation,&rdquo; begins with the enclosure movement, it ends with the 
</p>
<p>chapter titled &ldquo;The Modern Theory of Colonization.&rdquo; The historical relationship 
</p>
<p>between primitive accumulation and colonialism has been most clearly expressed, 
</p>
<p>however, by Rosa Luxemburg in The Accumulation of Capital. Luxemburg stresses 
</p>
<p>that primitive accumulation is continued in &ldquo;modern colonial policy,&rdquo; where &ldquo;each 
</p>
<p>new colonial expansion is accompanied, as a matter of course, by a relentless bat-
</p>
<p>tle of capital against the social and economic ties of the natives, who are also forc-
</p>
<p>ibly robbed of their means of production and labor power.&rdquo;23 Colonialism is linked 
</p>
<p>to enclosure, therefore, as part of a continuous material-historical process endemic 
</p>
<p>to capitalist development. From the perspective of political economy, colonialism 
</p>
<p> atteberry</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>335
</p>
<p>is the primitive accumulation of enclosure operating on a globalized scale.
</p>
<p> Colonialism is, in fact, doubly articulated with enclosure, for they are related 
</p>
<p>on the ideological level, as well.24 It is important to remark equally here the his-
</p>
<p>tory of the ideological role played by the figure of &ldquo;the commons&rdquo; in the colonialist 
</p>
<p>form of primitive accumulation. The figure of the commons appeared as early as 
</p>
<p>John Locke&rsquo;s Second Treatise of Government, where the &ldquo;commons&rdquo; functions as an 
</p>
<p>ideological object of knowledge, rather than as the real object of history analyzed 
</p>
<p>by Marx. For Locke, the commons is a necessary figure for his famous labor theory 
</p>
<p>of value, which posits that a man has property in anything that is &ldquo;by him removed 
</p>
<p>from the common state Nature placed it in, it hath by this labour something 
</p>
<p>annexed to it, that excludes the common right of other men.&rdquo;25 Moreover, Locke 
</p>
<p>posits that God &ldquo;hath given the World to Men in common&rdquo; and confines property-
</p>
<p>entitling labor to labor that assumes the form of Western agricultural practice.26 
</p>
<p>In this way, the ideological and legal apparatus is established for disappropriat-
</p>
<p>ing land from colonized peoples who were previously at home on it. In short, the 
</p>
<p>native peoples encountered by colonial expansion were denied any property inter-
</p>
<p>est in their own lands on the basis of the idea that the Earth was given to human-
</p>
<p>ity in common to be appropriated in the form of private property by those whose 
</p>
<p>social modes of production resembled those of the colonizing Europeans.
</p>
<p> With Locke then, the idea of the &ldquo;commons&rdquo; provided an ideological basis and 
</p>
<p>justification for colonialist appropriation and enclosure of non-European territory. 
</p>
<p>To this extent, Locke&rsquo;s theory provides the ideological groundwork for the first 
</p>
<p>stage of capitalist imperialism.27 Once this difference between Marx&rsquo;s material his-
</p>
<p>tory of the commons and Locke&rsquo;s ideological conception of the commons comes 
</p>
<p>into focus, the A2K movement&rsquo;s invocation of the commons opens two possible 
</p>
<p>paths of theoretical development. On the one hand, A2K theory may be rigorously 
</p>
<p>informed by Marx&rsquo;s material history of the commons and articulate the critical 
</p>
<p>resources necessary to forestall the reproduction of old colonial relations within 
</p>
<p>the new informationalism. Or, on the other hand, A2K may become theoretically 
</p>
<p>beholden to a political economy grounded in Locke&rsquo;s ideological conception of 
</p>
<p>the commons. To the extent that it hews to the former path, the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>promises to be a powerful force in the decolonization of the current imperialism of 
</p>
<p>informational capitalism. To the extent that it falls into the latter rut, however, the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement risks disappointing that promise.
</p>
<p>the (post)colonial commons
</p>
<p>Thus far, A2K theory has primarily found its conceptual resources in the foun-
</p>
<p>dational figures of liberal capitalism. When Boyle&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;The Second Enclosure 
</p>
<p>a2k theory and the postcolonial commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>336
</p>
<p>Movement,&rdquo; for example, turns from &ldquo;criticisms of the logic of enclosure,&rdquo; which 
</p>
<p>he says are not enough, to developing &ldquo;the vocabulary and the analytic tools nec-
</p>
<p>essary to turn the tide of enclosure,&rdquo; the conceptual resources are found in the 
</p>
<p>writings of Thomas Babington Macaulay and Adam Smith.28 That is, the resources 
</p>
<p>that are held out as offering a way toward turning the tide of enclosure are pre-
</p>
<p>cisely the conceptual resources that are at the very heart of the political economy 
</p>
<p>of capitalist imperialism, which was nothing other than a global regime of disci-
</p>
<p>plinary enclosure. It is unclear how conscious this theoretical choice has been. In 
</p>
<p>any case, whether it is symptomatic or strategic, this theoretical reliance on clas-
</p>
<p>sical liberalism reflects the fact that A2K theory is materially and historically situ-
</p>
<p>ated within liberal capitalism. Nevertheless, lest A2K&rsquo;s own development be swept 
</p>
<p>away by that material history, a theoretically critical relationship to A2K&rsquo;s posi-
</p>
<p>tionality needs to be undertaken.
</p>
<p> Thomas Babington Macaulay has a certain fame among intellectual property 
</p>
<p>scholars for pithy comments concerning copyright that he made as a member of 
</p>
<p>Parliament.29 Macaulay&rsquo;s more enduring historical legacy, however, is as one of 
</p>
<p>the chief architects of the British imperial project in India.30 From 1834 to 1838, 
</p>
<p>he served in India on the Supreme Council. During this time, he wrote his &ldquo;Min-
</p>
<p>ute on Indian Education,&rdquo; which set the educational policy objective of the British 
</p>
<p>Empire: &ldquo;We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters 
</p>
<p>between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood 
</p>
<p>and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect.&rdquo;31 During 
</p>
<p>the same period, he also drafted the Indian Penal Code, which would be adopted 
</p>
<p>and put into force only in 1861, when the British Crown took control of India away 
</p>
<p>from the East India Company after the Sepoy Mutiny.
</p>
<p> Given his central role in the formation of the British Raj, therefore, it should 
</p>
<p>come as no surprise that Macaulay&rsquo;s discourse, quoted at length by Boyle, is punc-
</p>
<p>tuated with references to the East India Company. In arguing against expanding 
</p>
<p>the term of copyright protection, Macaulay asks his opponents for &ldquo;any reason 
</p>
<p>why a monopoly of books should produce an effect directly the reverse of that 
</p>
<p>which was produced by the East India Company&rsquo;s monopoly of tea.&rdquo;32 This rhe-
</p>
<p>torical gesture is posed against the backdrop of a century-long struggle between 
</p>
<p>Whigs and Tories, both within the Parliament and in the East India Company itself, 
</p>
<p>over the role of the company within the political economy of the empire.33 Con-
</p>
<p>sequently, Boyle is right to observe that Macaulay&rsquo;s &ldquo;free-trade skepticism about 
</p>
<p>intellectual property&rdquo; was essentially a concern with monopolies in general.34 Nev-
</p>
<p>ertheless, this concern with monopoly was historically rooted in the politics sur-
</p>
<p>rounding the East India Company and therefore was ultimately a concern with the 
</p>
<p>political economy of empire.

</p>
<p> The terms of this historical debate were largely shaped by the publication of 
</p>
<p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s The Wealth of Nations in 1776. As is commonly recognized, one of 
</p>
<p>the central arguments of this historically influential text is that free markets are 
</p>
<p>naturally the most efficient way to structure a market economy and that monop-
</p>
<p>olies, insofar as they are state-enforced limits on free trade, should be viewed 
</p>
<p>with great skepticism. What is less commonly recognized, however, is the extent 
</p>
<p>to which Smith formulates this argument with the policy objective of finding the 
</p>
<p>most efficient way to administer the colonial project politically. Thus, for example, 
</p>
<p>Smith repeatedly makes such statements as &ldquo;If the colony trade, however, even as 
</p>
<p>it is carried on at present, is advantageous to Great Britain, it is not by means of 
</p>
<p>the monopoly, but in spite of the monopoly.&rdquo;35 This policy objective is written all 
</p>
<p>over Smith&rsquo;s text, so it is not surprising that it, rather than a concern with intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property, should form the heart of the lengthy passage from Smith quoted 
</p>
<p>by Boyle in &ldquo;The Second Enclosure Movement.&rdquo; The long passage quoted by Boyle 
</p>
<p>comes from an extended meditation upon the limited utility of monopolies in the 
</p>
<p>early stages of a colonizing effort. Smith writes, and Boyle quotes:
</p>
<p>A temporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated upon the same principles 
</p>
<p>upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor, and that of 
</p>
<p>a new book to its author. But upon the expiration of the term, the monopoly ought 
</p>
<p>certainly to determine; the forts and garrisons, if it was found necessary to establish 
</p>
<p>any, to be taken into the hands of the government, their value to be paid to the 
</p>
<p>company, and the trade to be laid open to all the subjects of the state.36
</p>
<p> The reference to what we now call intellectual property rights is ancillary to 
</p>
<p>the thrust of Smith&rsquo;s argument, whose objective is to explain the limited utility of 
</p>
<p>monopolies in the initial stages of colonization. After the monopoly&rsquo;s initial pur-
</p>
<p>pose has been served&mdash;that is, after the colony has been firmly established&mdash;the 
</p>
<p>trade should be &ldquo;laid open to all the subjects of the state.&rdquo; If one is to take the A2K 
</p>
<p>discourse seriously, then, one must ask to what extent arguments in favor of an 
</p>
<p>unfettered information commons, in opposition to stronger intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights, reflect the fact that global informationalist capital may be beginning to con-
</p>
<p>ceive of itself as exiting the initial mercantile stage of its neocolonial enterprise. 
</p>
<p>In the current transitional moment, intellectual property rights may have already 
</p>
<p>secured informational capital an international foothold in the form of the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement. Now that &ldquo;the forts and garrisons&rdquo; are in place, it may be time to enter 
</p>
<p>into a neoliberal phase of free trade. Of course, it may be objected that the differ-
</p>
<p>ence between Smith&rsquo;s argument in 1776 and the A2K argument in 2009 is that the 
</p>
<p>public domain is and should be open to exploitation by all, not just &ldquo;the subjects 
</p>
<p>of the state.&rdquo; Research suggests, however, that this is simply not the case&mdash;that 
</p>
<p>a2k theory and the postcolonial commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>338
</p>
<p>the public domain is and will be &ldquo;exploited asymmetrically&rdquo; by Western corporate 
</p>
<p>interests.37 The concern is that A2K&rsquo;s informational commons, in the absence of 
</p>
<p>additional changes in the international intellectual property regime that are yet to 
</p>
<p>be theoretically elaborated, will work to effectuate this transition.
</p>
<p> The shift from the mercantilist phase to a free-trade phase is, as Smith and 
</p>
<p>the A2K movement both argue, necessitated by reasons of efficiency. The ques-
</p>
<p>tion remains: &ldquo;Efficient&rdquo; at what, exactly? In keeping with the classical liberalism 
</p>
<p>inherited from Smith, the current neoliberal school of thought would answer the 
</p>
<p>question with the reply &ldquo;efficient at allocating resources between market actors by 
</p>
<p>making them internalize their externalities.&rdquo; Such an answer merely begs the ques-
</p>
<p>tion insofar as participatory membership within the market is precisely what is at 
</p>
<p>issue in the globalized struggle. The classic economic response takes the market 
</p>
<p>and membership in it for granted. It does not reach the real issue in at least two 
</p>
<p>structurally related ways. First, global capital has never seriously contemplated 
</p>
<p>internalizing the externalities of colonialism, which is to say the tremendous bur-
</p>
<p>dens that the history of colonialism has imposed on the &ldquo;developing world.&rdquo; Sec-
</p>
<p>ond, it fails to contend with the extent to which the market comes into being at 
</p>
<p>all through the creation of a more radical externality&mdash;call it &ldquo;subalternity&rdquo;&mdash;that 
</p>
<p>cannot be represented within the market at all.38 The logic of the market, like all 
</p>
<p>logical systems, is founded upon a constitutive exclusion that cannot be repre-
</p>
<p>sented within the system, but the exclusion does, nevertheless, manifest effects 
</p>
<p>within the system in the form of a trace that marks the system&rsquo;s own internal limit. 
</p>
<p>The subaltern, as &ldquo;the absolute limit of the place where history is narrativized into 
</p>
<p>logic,&rdquo; traces the limit where capitalist economic logic fails to grasp the necessary 
</p>
<p>historical condition of its own development and continued survival.39 In the con-
</p>
<p>text of today&rsquo;s informational capitalism, TRIPS, for example, purports to integrate 
</p>
<p>the developing world into the system of global capital, yet it is able to do so only 
</p>
<p>to the extent that the intellectual property regime imagines the developing world 
</p>
<p>as a subject of property rights. Similarly, A2K theory aims to address this particu-
</p>
<p>lar problem by proposing an economic model of the commons in which the devel-
</p>
<p>oping world would have greater access to informational goods. However, such an 
</p>
<p>integration takes place again only to the extent that the developing world is imag-
</p>
<p>ined as having access to the finance capital, social capital, and human capital that 
</p>
<p>is required to make such access economically productive. In both instances, both 
</p>
<p>economic theory and the legal regime necessarily fail to account for the founda-
</p>
<p>tional act of expropriation that is required for the capitalist production of surplus 
</p>
<p>value. This process of constructing the capitalist free market through the produc-
</p>
<p>tion of subalternity is, once again, what Marx calls primitive accumulation.
</p>
<p> Smith&rsquo;s antimonopolistic argument is aimed, therefore, not only at achieving 
</p>
<p> atteberry</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>339
</p>
<p>efficiency in wealth distribution within the functioning of the capitalist market, 
</p>
<p>but at achieving efficiency in the production of those markets through primitive 
</p>
<p>accumulation. This objective is starkly manifest, for example, when Smith writes:
</p>
<p>In Africa and the East Indies, therefore, it was more difficult to displace the natives, 
</p>
<p>and to extend the European plantations over the greater part of the lands of the 
</p>
<p>original inhabitants. The genius of exclusive companies, besides, is unfavourable, it 
</p>
<p>has already been observed, to the growth of new colonies, and has probably been 
</p>
<p>the principal cause of the little progress which they have made in the East Indies.40
</p>
<p> Progress here is plainly defined as clearing &ldquo;the natives&rdquo; from their land. 
</p>
<p>Where these &ldquo;natives&rdquo; are well entrenched, however, monopolies do not do the 
</p>
<p>best job of it. As those who have lived through colonialism know, being denied 
</p>
<p>monopoly privileges is not the only way of being excluded from the market. There 
</p>
<p>are, indeed, more efficient means of exclusion, more thorough forms of material 
</p>
<p>alienation. Even within the developed world, monopolies are not necessary to 
</p>
<p>keep the bulk of the working class alienated from the prevailing means of produc-
</p>
<p>tion. Economic barriers to market entry do just fine. This has been all the more 
</p>
<p>true for those on the periphery of the world system, where the regime of liberal 
</p>
<p>free trade ephemerally appeared in the global transition to state monopoly capital-
</p>
<p>ism.41 The arguments for a global commons, therefore, may in effect clear the way 
</p>
<p>for a more efficient capitalist territorialization of the informational terrain.
</p>
<p>control in the information society
</p>
<p>In response to this historicized argument, a rigorous line of reasoning in A2K the-
</p>
<p>ory would likely insist that important differences between informational goods and 
</p>
<p>more traditional industrial goods are being overlooked. There are two major differ-
</p>
<p>ences. First, informational goods are &ldquo;nonrival,&rdquo; which means that their consump-
</p>
<p>tion by one user does not preclude their use by another. As a result, the marginal 
</p>
<p>cost of producing informational goods approaches zero.42 Second, informational 
</p>
<p>goods are both inputs and outputs of their own production. Since innovation is 
</p>
<p>cumulative, the reduction in the productive consumption of informational goods as 
</p>
<p>a consequence of intellectual property protection results in externalized social costs 
</p>
<p>in the form of reduced innovation.43 Ignoring these differences conflates intangible 
</p>
<p>and tangible goods, the argument would claim, and results in conflating the different 
</p>
<p>historical moments of enclosure. Informational resources are different from more 
</p>
<p>tangible resources, so a global information commons would operate differently than 
</p>
<p>classic free-market liberalism under colonial rule because the market of informa-
</p>
<p>tional capitalism differs so fundamentally from the market of industrial capitalism.
</p>
<p>a2k theory and the postcolonial commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>340
</p>
<p> By focusing in this way on the microeconomics of informational goods, A2K 
</p>
<p>theory has shown that the current distribution of both information and the ben-
</p>
<p>efits it brings cannot be rectified until the iron grip of maximalist intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty protection is broken. The formation of an information commons may prove to 
</p>
<p>be a necessary condition for unleashing the productive potential of informational 
</p>
<p>capitalism. Current A2K theories demonstrate not only why this is so, but why 
</p>
<p>this is an economic imperative that may well be irresistible as the social conditions 
</p>
<p>of production become increasingly networked. &ldquo;Information wants to be free,&rdquo; as 
</p>
<p>the slogan goes.44 To the extent, however, that A2K discourse has tended to adopt 
</p>
<p>an uncritical discourse of freedom, its theoretical project risks replacing a material 
</p>
<p>conception of the commons with an ideological one. It must not be forgotten that 
</p>
<p>capitalist liberal ideology has always advanced under the sign of &ldquo;freedom.&rdquo; The 
</p>
<p>process of primitive accumulation, for example, frees the peasant from the land, 
</p>
<p>transforming him into &ldquo;a free worker . . . free in the double sense that as a free indi-
</p>
<p>vidual he can dispose of his labor-power as his own commodity, and that on the 
</p>
<p>other hand, he has no other commodity for sale.&rdquo;45 Similarly, British imperialism&mdash;
</p>
<p>like all the others, past and present&mdash;ideologically justified itself by asserting that 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;under the charm of this beneficent spirit the chief colonial establishments of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain have already achieved substantial freedom.&rdquo;46 Indeed, the danger for 
</p>
<p>the A2K movement grows only stronger as it increasingly engages with the con-
</p>
<p>temporary iterations of the historical struggle against imperialism.
</p>
<p> The microeconomic differences between tangible and intangible goods can be 
</p>
<p>overstated to the extent that existing A2K theory does not adequately contend 
</p>
<p>with the fact that the emerging market of informational capitalism is situated 
</p>
<p>within a world system whose basic structures remain the same as they were under 
</p>
<p>the imperialism of industrial capitalism. The unique microeconomic characteris-
</p>
<p>tics of informational goods, which A2K has so systematically developed on the 
</p>
<p>micro level, may also necessitate the macrological development of a new and dif-
</p>
<p>ferent apparatus for capturing the wealth that informational capitalism produces. 
</p>
<p>The commons clearly plays an integral role in this new apparatus, just as it did 
</p>
<p>in the old one. The role of the commons in both cases is to clear a space of raw 
</p>
<p>goods open to expropriation by the creative labor of man, which is in fact not 
</p>
<p>determined by either work or creativity, but by access to the means of produc-
</p>
<p>tion. The problem, therefore, becomes how an information commons can best be 
</p>
<p>constructed in order to distribute the flow of wealth in a way that does not repro-
</p>
<p>duce the existing neocolonial order. The information commons may be a necessary 
</p>
<p>condition for unleashing the productive potential of informational capitalism, but 
</p>
<p>it may not be a sufficient condition for realizing the liberating potential of that  
</p>
<p>increased productivity.

</p>
<p> Perfectly aware of the potentially duplicitous character of bourgeois freedom, 
</p>
<p>Gilles Deleuze and F&eacute;lix Guattari have described the process of capitalism&rsquo;s devel-
</p>
<p>opment in terms of a &ldquo;generalized decoding of flows&rdquo; and a dynamic of &ldquo;deter-
</p>
<p>ritorialization.&rdquo;47 The current informationalist regime and the discourses attending 
</p>
<p>to it&mdash;including that of the A2K movement&mdash;fit nicely within Deleuze and Guat-
</p>
<p>tari&rsquo;s paradigm. The informationalist mode of production represents a new order of 
</p>
<p>decoded flows. The freeing of information promises to restructure the relations of 
</p>
<p>production, replacing vertically integrated structures of production with horizon-
</p>
<p>tally networked ones.
</p>
<p> The terrain of social production is being reterritorialized. The information that 
</p>
<p>is struggling to be free continues, however, to circulate within a very material geog-
</p>
<p>raphy. While the circuits of production have become networked, the nodal points 
</p>
<p>of the network continue to be places such as New York, London, and Tokyo.48 The 
</p>
<p>creation of a global information commons may even render the networks of pro-
</p>
<p>duction slightly more flexible, facilitating the integration of places such as S&atilde;o 
</p>
<p>Paulo, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Shanghai. The deterritorialization that results 
</p>
<p>from the networked production of globalized informational capitalism is necessar-
</p>
<p>ily accompanied, however, by a corresponding reterritorialization.49 While a few 
</p>
<p>postcolonial metropolises may enter the network, billions of impoverished people 
</p>
<p>around the world will remain off the grid. &ldquo;These neoterritorialities,&rdquo; Deleuze and 
</p>
<p>Guattari write, &ldquo;are often artificial, residual, archaic; but they are archaisms having 
</p>
<p>a perfectly current function.&rdquo;50 In the case of the emerging territorialization of the 
</p>
<p>Earth under informational capitalism, the archaisms of the colonialist world order 
</p>
<p>threaten to reassert themselves with a vengeance. The solution to this problem of 
</p>
<p>the continued colonialist distribution of wealth, therefore, will not be found simply 
</p>
<p>in an information commons, although an information commons will surely have 
</p>
<p>an important role to play. When faced with the dynamic of deterritorialization, 
</p>
<p>Deleuze and Guattari ask, could it be that the revolutionary path is to &ldquo;go further 
</p>
<p>still, that is, in the movement of the market, of decoding and deterritorialization? 
</p>
<p>For perhaps the flows are not yet deterritorialized enough.&rdquo;51 The questions for the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement then become what function would the information commons serve 
</p>
<p>in the globalized economy, and how might we accelerate the process that it prom-
</p>
<p>ises by finding ways to resist its potentially neocolonial reterritorializations?
</p>
<p> While the specific economic behavior of the information commons may differ 
</p>
<p>from any kind of commons we have previously seen, the question remains whether 
</p>
<p>its basic function within a capitalist world system would be fundamentally any 
</p>
<p>different. A rigorous approach to the question must situate the A2K movement&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>information commons not only within informational capitalism, but also within the 
</p>
<p>emerging society of control.
</p>
<p>a2k theory and the postcolonial commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>342
</p>
<p> In &ldquo;Postscript on the Societies of Control,&rdquo; Gilles Deleuze argued that society 
</p>
<p>was transitioning from a disciplinary society, which had been the object of Michel 
</p>
<p>Foucault&rsquo;s classic works, to a different mode of social organization. According to 
</p>
<p>Deleuze, disciplinary society organizes society in and through &ldquo;spaces of enclo-
</p>
<p>sure.&rdquo; The paradigmatic spaces of enclosure would include prisons, hospitals, fac-
</p>
<p>tories, schools.52 Within these spaces of enclosure, the exercise of power is static, 
</p>
<p>discontinuous, and rigid. In contrast, societies of control construct open spaces 
</p>
<p>where power is exercised in a dynamic, continuous, and flexible manner.53 In a 
</p>
<p>further elaboration of his terms, Deleuze schematically links each type of society 
</p>
<p>with a particular kind of machine that exemplifies the respective social relations 
</p>
<p>of production: The disciplinary societies function through &ldquo;machines involving 
</p>
<p>energy&rdquo; such as the steam engine or nuclear reactors; societies of control operate 
</p>
<p>with &ldquo;computers.&rdquo; Furthermore, the technological shift that characterizes the tran-
</p>
<p>sition to the society of control is itself the function of a &ldquo;mutation of capitalism.&rdquo;54 
</p>
<p>This mutation is nothing other than the emergence of informational capitalism.
</p>
<p> The so-called &ldquo;new enclosures&rdquo; operate within the logic of disciplinary societ-
</p>
<p>ies. The open access of the information commons, on the other hand, exhibits an 
</p>
<p>organizing structure that typifies the society of control. The regulation of infor-
</p>
<p>mation production under a commons regime functions according to a principle of 
</p>
<p>open access, which reflects changing social relations of production that have them-
</p>
<p>selves become more elastic and variable. As such, a commons-oriented regime, in 
</p>
<p>contrast to the current intellectual property regime, would be more suited to the 
</p>
<p>changing conditions of social production under informational capitalism.
</p>
<p> Our current historical moment, then, is one of transition. In the realm of politi-
</p>
<p>cal economy, the transition appears as the passage from industrial to informational 
</p>
<p>capitalism. At the level of the social organization of power, it takes the form of the 
</p>
<p>passage from disciplinary societies to societies of control.
</p>
<p> The current legal debate between maximalist protection and access to knowl-
</p>
<p>edge emerges as a symptom of this transition from discipline to control. &ldquo;If our 
</p>
<p>law is hesitant, is itself in crisis,&rdquo; Deleuze writes, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because we are leaving one 
</p>
<p>in order to enter into the other.&rdquo;55 The transitions from industrial to informational 
</p>
<p>capitalism and from discipline to control appear as parallel historical changes, and 
</p>
<p>the discourse of the A2K movement is situated within these passages.
</p>
<p> Despite the rhetoric of manifest liberation that attends each of these transi-
</p>
<p>tions, however, they should not be narrativized as movements of either liberation 
</p>
<p>or oppression. Given its tendency to adopt such a binary rhetoric, the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment needs to come to the broader recognition that &ldquo;there is no need to ask which 
</p>
<p>is the toughest or most tolerable regime, for it&rsquo;s within each of them that liberating 
</p>
<p>and enslaving forces confront one another.&rdquo;56 The theoretical debate within the 
</p>
<p> atteberry</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>343
</p>
<p>A2K movement has sometimes been framed as if legal policy makers were faced 
</p>
<p>with a choice between an enslaving regime of enclosure and a liberating regime of 
</p>
<p>the commons. The revolutionary zeal shown by some within the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>must be accompanied by the sober realization that informational capitalism is no 
</p>
<p>less capitalism than industrial capitalism, with all the corresponding hopes and 
</p>
<p>fears. When approached from within this framework, the information commons 
</p>
<p>is not necessarily a force of either liberation or enslavement. Rather, the terrain of 
</p>
<p>information that the information commons territorializes becomes, like land and 
</p>
<p>labor before it, a site of struggle.
</p>
<p>information/knowledge as an apparatus of capture
</p>
<p>In a variation on Marx&rsquo;s &ldquo;trinity formula,&rdquo;57 Deleuze and Guattari develop a model 
</p>
<p>of what they call the &ldquo;apparatus of capture.&rdquo;58 The trinity formula consists of 
</p>
<p>land/rent, labor/wages, and capital/profit. This formula encapsulates the trans-
</p>
<p>formation of basic material elements into the &ldquo;historically specific social forms&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>of capitalist relations of production that generated wealth in the mid-nineteenth 
</p>
<p>century.59 For example, under the social relations of private property, land is trans-
</p>
<p>formed into a source of wealth in the form of rent.60 Deleuze and Guattari char-
</p>
<p>acterize each of the constitutive parts of the trinity formula as an apparatus of 
</p>
<p>capture insofar as each functions as a means of generating and capturing flows of 
</p>
<p>wealth.61 Unfortunately, Deleuze and Guattari do not remark the historical speci-
</p>
<p>ficity of these apparatuses, which Marx on the other hand was always careful to 
</p>
<p>do. When properly historicized, however, Marx&rsquo;s trinity formula displays the basic 
</p>
<p>features of disciplinary modes of social ordering. In particular, they all proceed 
</p>
<p>by means of enclosure. Land is enclosed within private property to produce rent, 
</p>
<p>labor is enclosed within the factory to produce wage labor, and capital is enclosed 
</p>
<p>within circuits of production and consumption to produce profits.
</p>
<p> As capitalism transitions into its current informationalist stage, however, new 
</p>
<p>social relations of production are bound to emerge. Not only are these new rela-
</p>
<p>tions of production themselves produced by informational capitalism, but they 
</p>
<p>are also constitutive of the emerging society of control. Moreover, because infor-
</p>
<p>mation exhibits economic characteristics that differ significantly from traditional 
</p>
<p>material goods, informational capitalism will necessarily develop new means of 
</p>
<p>seizing, controlling, and distributing the wealth that it creates through these new 
</p>
<p>relations of production. Informational capitalism will have developed a new appa-
</p>
<p>ratus of capture commensurate with both the economic characteristics of informa-
</p>
<p>tional goods and the social characteristics of control. Alongside land/rent, labor/
</p>
<p>wages, capital/profit, a new apparatus, of information/knowledge, appears. The 
</p>
<p>a2k theory and the postcolonial commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>344
</p>
<p>information commons will undoubtedly play an integral part in the operation of 
</p>
<p>this information/knowledge apparatus.
</p>
<p> An information commons in the context of a world system organized under a 
</p>
<p>regime of control forms an integral component in information/knowledge as a new 
</p>
<p>apparatus of capture. Every apparatus of capture operates by creating a &ldquo;general 
</p>
<p>space of comparison&rdquo; that serves as the necessary condition for &ldquo;a mobile center 
</p>
<p>of appropriation.&rdquo;62 This general space of comparison is created through a formal 
</p>
<p>analytic category that abstracts away all particularities in the objects of comparison 
</p>
<p>and thus creates a baseline against which differences can be measured. In the case 
</p>
<p>of labor/wages, for example, the space of comparison is created by the category 
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;labor-power.&rdquo;63 In Marx&rsquo;s labor theory of value, the price of labor (&ldquo;wages&rdquo;) is 
</p>
<p>determined not by the value produced by the laborer, but by the value of the labor-
</p>
<p>er&rsquo;s labor power, which is nothing more than the capacity of the laborer to work, 
</p>
<p>irrespective of any differences in the relative productivity of that labor. The fair-
</p>
<p>market value of labor power, like all other commodities, is determined by the costs 
</p>
<p>of its production. The cost of producing labor power therefore is simply &ldquo;the aver-
</p>
<p>age amount of the means of subsistence necessary&rdquo; to reproduce the kind of labor 
</p>
<p>in question in that particular society at that particular historical moment.64 The cat-
</p>
<p>egory of labor power thus creates a space of comparison that enables the capitalist 
</p>
<p>who purchases labor power to appropriate the difference between the value of the 
</p>
<p>labor power purchased and the value produced by its exertion. Thus, while labor in 
</p>
<p>itself is without &ldquo;value,&rdquo; it appears as the source of value by virtue of being valo-
</p>
<p>rized through the social relations of production in which the laborer offers his labor 
</p>
<p>power for sale in the labor market.65 The laborer must sell his labor power, rather 
</p>
<p>than productively consume it himself, precisely because he has been separated 
</p>
<p>from the means of production that are the necessary preconditions for its produc-
</p>
<p>tive consumption. At root, then, the difference in value between labor power and 
</p>
<p>its exertion is predicated upon the relative difference between the capitalist and 
</p>
<p>the worker in their respective capacities to consume labor power productively.66
</p>
<p> The information commons would likely operate as an abstract space of com-
</p>
<p>parison for capitalizing on differences in the relative capacities of the Global North 
</p>
<p>and South to consume the information commons productively. Just as labor or the 
</p>
<p>Earth are in themselves without value prior to their valorization by their respec-
</p>
<p>tive apparatus of capture, so too is information. Information in abstract isolation 
</p>
<p>from informational capitalism has no &ldquo;value&rdquo; in the market-economy sense. The 
</p>
<p>information commons, however, creates a space of comparison for information&mdash;as 
</p>
<p>labor power does for labor&mdash;wherein information becomes valorized as a source of 
</p>
<p>capital by exploiting the difference in the capacity to consume information pro-
</p>
<p>ductively in the creation of knowledge goods. These differences are the legacy of 
</p>
<p> atteberry</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>345
</p>
<p>the uneven development resulting from the historical process of imperialist expan-
</p>
<p>sion of monopoly capital, and the global &ldquo;digital divide&rdquo; is the material manifesta-
</p>
<p>tion of these differences in the capacity for productive consumption in the age of 
</p>
<p>informational capitalism.67
</p>
<p> Under these circumstances and absent any measures to redress them, the 
</p>
<p>existing colonialist relations of production characteristic of the world system are 
</p>
<p>likely to remain largely intact as informational capitalism expands globally. That 
</p>
<p>is, information as one of the factors of production will appear to be free in the 
</p>
<p>commons. Nevertheless, the other factors required for the productive consumption 
</p>
<p>of information&mdash;such as computers and communication networks, not to mention 
</p>
<p>social and cultural capital&mdash;will remain unevenly distributed between the core and 
</p>
<p>the periphery. Consequently, the nations currently at the periphery of the world 
</p>
<p>system will continue to provide raw materials to the information commons in such 
</p>
<p>forms as genetic resources and &ldquo;traditional knowledge,&rdquo; while the core nations will 
</p>
<p>enjoy a relative monopoly on the productive consumption of information.68
</p>
<p> Differences in capacity to consume information productively may also be 
</p>
<p>framed, in the context of finance capital, as differences in so-called human and 
</p>
<p>social capital.69 The capacity to consume information productively requires not 
</p>
<p>only a material infrastructure in the form of computerized networks, but also 
</p>
<p>resources of both social capital, such as having access to the research networks in 
</p>
<p>which the information circulates, and human capital, such as educational know-
</p>
<p>how. By defining the conditions that determine which kinds of social and human 
</p>
<p>capital matter, colonial discipline has historically and routinely set up these kinds 
</p>
<p>of disparities and then exploited the resulting differences. This technique was an 
</p>
<p>integral component of the process of colonial primitive accumulation. In India, 
</p>
<p>for example, the British passed the Indian Forest Act of 1865, which established a 
</p>
<p>legal mechanism for claiming commonly held forest land as governmental land.70 
</p>
<p>Under the act, Forest Settlement Officers were required to publish notices in offi-
</p>
<p>cial gazettes of the government&rsquo;s intention to claim forest land. Individuals who 
</p>
<p>wished to make a property claim on the land were required to do so within three 
</p>
<p>months of notice publication. This method of legal disappropriation established 
</p>
<p>a procedure that capitalized on differences in social and human capital. First, by 
</p>
<p>taking advantage of the fact that colonized peoples living in the affected forests 
</p>
<p>were not likely readers of the official gazettes, it exploited a difference in social 
</p>
<p>capital. Second, the affected individuals were not likely readers of the gazette in 
</p>
<p>part because they are unlikely to be educated in English. Thus, the procedure also 
</p>
<p>exploited a difference in the types of human capital that the social conditions of 
</p>
<p>production under British imperialism deemed to be significant.
</p>
<p> Insofar as the end result of this process was a property claim in the forest held 
</p>
<p>a2k theory and the postcolonial commons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>346
</p>
<p>by the colonial government, this historical example of the colonial construction 
</p>
<p>and exploitation of differences in human and social capital analogizes nicely with 
</p>
<p>the contemporary role of such differences in the current international intellectual 
</p>
<p>property regime. In both this historical example and the current intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty regime, the entire process of disappropriation followed by enclosure is consis-
</p>
<p>tent with social forms of discipline that are static and discontinuous. Under these 
</p>
<p>conditions, the procedure for disappropriation need operate only once, because 
</p>
<p>the result is legally consolidated by the property enclosure. Simply scaling back 
</p>
<p>the extent of enclosure, however, only cuts the process short without reaching the 
</p>
<p>initial means of disappropriation. Indeed, in the present regime of social control, 
</p>
<p>the moment of enclosure is no longer needed, for the process of disappropriation 
</p>
<p>is now dynamic and continuous. The process of decolonization itself may be read 
</p>
<p>as a transition on the geopolitical terrain from the disciplinary enclosures of colo-
</p>
<p>nialism to a neocolonialism of social control.71
</p>
<p> A similar moment may have arrived in the evolution of informational capital-
</p>
<p>ism, when the disciplinary logic of enclosure can give way without necessarily 
</p>
<p>altering the fundamental relations of power. The fact that the information com-
</p>
<p>mons would not be subject to enclosure does not necessarily mean that it would 
</p>
<p>not function as a key component of the information/knowledge apparatus of cap-
</p>
<p>ture in a new regime of information imperialism.
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>A2K theory must abandon the comfort of tidy binary oppositions where a theoret-
</p>
<p>ical stance against enclosure and in favor of the commons necessarily implies that 
</p>
<p>one is similarly positioned against emerging information imperialism. As the A2K 
</p>
<p>movement continues to unfold its theoretical and political practice, its underlying 
</p>
<p>critical theory must incorporate this fundamental realization. Positionality is not 
</p>
<p>determinable by a single theoretical position; rather, positionality is determined by 
</p>
<p>a network of historical and material relations. If A2K is to become an effectively 
</p>
<p>globalized movement, it will necessarily have to accommodate a number of differ-
</p>
<p>ent voices, each with their own positionality. The positionality of the law profes-
</p>
<p>sor in the United States is not the same as that of the local grassroots organizer 
</p>
<p>in India, and the positionality of the governmental agent in Uganda is different 
</p>
<p>still. Many have come to perceive in the A2K movement an important element in 
</p>
<p>the ongoing struggle against the legacies of colonialism, and the movement has 
</p>
<p>found itself propelled toward alliances with other movements from the formerly 
</p>
<p>colonized world in large part because of a shared opposition to what has been suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully characterized as a new historical moment of enclosure. Nevertheless, if 
</p>
<p> atteberry</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>347
</p>
<p>effective alliances are to be made, the A2K movement must collectively develop 
</p>
<p>a critical theory with the flexibility and sophistication necessary to articulate a 
</p>
<p>theoretical and political practice that can account for the multiple valences that are 
</p>
<p>operative within any single position.
</p>
<p> A critical interrogation of the limits of the commons doctrine is a good place 
</p>
<p>to start. Given, as we have seen, that an uncritical version of the commons may 
</p>
<p>well end up serving the long-term interests of informational imperialism, the A2K 
</p>
<p>movement&rsquo;s commitment to the commons should not, for example, necessarily 
</p>
<p>imply a dogmatic opposition to any attempt on the part of the developing world 
</p>
<p>to withdraw some informational goods from the commons, whether in the form of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;traditional knowledge&rdquo; or otherwise. With a rigorous critical theory guiding its 
</p>
<p>theoretical and political practice, the A2K movement may well then become an 
</p>
<p>indispensable component of the ongoing global struggle against imperialism.

<p> notes
</p>
<p>1 On the notion of &ldquo;conjuncture,&rdquo; see Louis Althusser, For Marx, trans. Ben Brewster (New 
</p>
<p>York: Verso, 2005). &ldquo;Informational capitalism&rdquo; is Manuel Castells&rsquo;s term for the mode of pro-
</p>
<p>duction, based upon technological innovation and the production of knowledge as surplus 
</p>
<p>value, that has developed since the restructuration of global capital since the 1980s. See Man-
</p>
<p>uel Castells, The Rise of the Network Society, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Blackwell, 2000), pp. 18&ndash;21. 
</p>
<p>The varied attempts to trace the contours of this epochal change in the character of capital-
</p>
<p>ist production have resulted in many different names for this new mode of production. In 
</p>
<p>addition to Castells&rsquo;s &ldquo;informational capitalism,&rdquo; Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri&rsquo;s notion of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;immaterial production&rdquo; provides a constructive model for conceptualizing the issues at stake 
</p>
<p>in this paper. See Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Multitude (New York: Penguin, 2004), pp. 
</p>
<p>140&ndash;57 and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Empire (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University 
</p>
<p>Press, 2000), pp. 22&ndash;24. Another theoretical formulation along the same lines may be found 
</p>
<p>in Yann Moulier-Boutang&rsquo;s &ldquo;cognitive capitalism.&rdquo; See Yann Moulier-Boutang, Le capitalisme 
</p>
<p>cognitif: La nouvelle grande transformation (Paris: &Eacute;ditions Amsterdam, 2007). Finally, the 
</p>
<p>notion of the postindustrial society was pioneered by Alain Touraine. See, for example, Alain 
</p>
<p>Touraine, The Post-Industrial Society (New York: Random House, 1971).

<p>22 As Althusser understands it, &ldquo;what is represented in ideology is therefore not the system of 
</p>

</p>
<p>individuals to the real relations in which they live.&rdquo; Louis Althusser, Lenin and Philosophy, 
</p>
<p>trans. Ben Brewster (New York: Verso, 1971), p. 165. Ideology works a second-order distortion 
</p>
<p>in our representation of the real state of affairs. Ideology does not simply misrepresent the 
</p>
<p>real relations that structure a given moment, but misrepresents our relation to those rela-
</p>
<p>tions. In ideology, one misperceives where one stands in the real macrological struggle.

</p>
<p>38 The concept of &ldquo;externality&rdquo; invoked here, on the other hand, comes from the literature of 
</p>
<p>law and economics. The term &ldquo;externality&rdquo; designates a cost or burden that results from a 
</p>
<p>particular use of a resource that the user fails to account for because it falls upon others. 
</p>
<p>The famous Coase Theorem argues that externalities tend to lead to the inefficient use of 
</p>
<p>resources. See Ronald Coase, &ldquo;The Problem of Social Costs,&rdquo; Journal of Law and Economics 3, 
</p>
<p>no. 1 (October 1960): pp. 1&ndash;44. Consequently, the best way to facilitate efficient outcomes is 
</p>
<p>to create regimes in which the cost associated with a particular use of a resource reflects the 
</p>
<p>burdens that such a use imposes upon others. In other words, efficiency requires the &ldquo;inter-
</p>
<p>nalization of externalities.&rdquo; See Ibid. See also Harold Demsetz, &ldquo;Toward a Theory of Property 
</p>
<p>Rights,&rdquo; American Economic Review 57, no. 2 (May 1967): pp. 347&ndash;59 and Garrett Hardin, &ldquo;The 
</p>
<p>Tragedy of the Commons,&rdquo; Science 162 (December 1968): pp. 1243&ndash;48. On the macroeconomic 
</p>
<p>level, the capitalist world system remains highly inefficient&mdash;and unjust&mdash;insofar as its use 
</p>
<p>of resources creates tremendous burdens upon the colonized Global South. The status of the 
</p>
<p>subaltern then marks the constitutive limit of the capitalist system in the sense that it repre-
</p>
<p>sents the point at which the externalities of capitalism as a world system cannot be internal-
</p>
<p>ized while still remaining capitalism. The subaltern thus represents the constitutive external-
</p>
<p>ity of the capitalist world system.

<p>The transformation of intellectual property law from an esoteric legal subject to

<p>a topic of daily conversation and debate has occurred in a relatively short span of

<p>time. Over the past few years, the aggressive expansion of property claims into

<p>to, making, understanding, or communicating any objects that embody thought, 
</p>
<p>knowledge, or feeling is as fraught with danger and anxiety today as the appropri-
</p>
<p>ation of material wealth or trespassing onto private property were through much 
</p>
<p>of human history.1
</p>
<p> The anxiety and conflict are certainly not restricted to a set of geographical 
</p>
<p>locations, but the nature of conflict gets configured differently as we move from 
</p>
<p>the United States and Europe to parts of Asia and Africa. In the United States, the 
</p>
<p>crisis is represented in terms of the shrinking of the public domain and of the com-
</p>
<p>mons by the extension of copyright, the linking of file sharing and peer-to-peer 
</p>
<p>activities with the global war on terror, and the emergence of a new breed of crimi-
</p>
<p>nals in the form of students sued by music companies for downloading MP3s on-
</p>
<p>line. In South Africa, the government is bulldozed by pharmaceutical corporations 
</p>
<p>who have attempted to prevent it from declaring statutory licenses that will make 
</p>
<p>AIDS drugs more accessible, and in many parts of Asia, the proliferation of cheap 
</p>
<p>technologies of media reproduction creates a parallel economy that threatens the 
</p>
<p>monopoly of old media players.2
</p>
<p> The concern over the expansionist tendency of intellectual property has also 
</p>
<p>motivated a rearticulation of the importance of the commons of knowledge and 
</p>
<p>Air Pirates cover (The Walt Disney Company).
</p>
<p>The Air Pirates were a group of underground 
</p>
<p>cartoonists (Dan O&rsquo;Neill, Ted Richards, Bobby 
</p>
<p>London, and Gary Hallgren). They were sued 
</p>
<p>by Disney in 1972 because they drew Mickey 
</p>
<p>Mouse and other Disney characters dealing 
</p>
<p>illicit drugs and having sex with each other. 
</p>
<p>Hallgren and Richards settled with Disney. 
</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Neill and London decided to go to court. 
</p>
<p>After years of legal battles, Disney agreed  
</p>
<p>in 1980 to drop the case in exchange for  
</p>
<p>the Pirates&rsquo; agreeing not to infringe their

</p>
<p>cultural production. This is exemplified by various phenomena, among the increas-
</p>
<p>ing popularity of nonproprietary modes such as free software and open content. 
</p>
<p>A number of these concerns historically have emerged from the experience of 
</p>
<p>Europe and the United States. But when one attempts to translate the terms of 
</p>
<p>the intellectual property debate into the contemporary experience of countries in 
</p>
<p>Asia, Latin America, and Africa, it is difficult to locate any easy indexical reference 
</p>
<p>to ideas such as &ldquo;the digital commons.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> In a similar vein, scholarship on the concept of the public domain has opened 
</p>
<p>out the debate on intellectual property and has forced us to pay closer attention 
</p>
<p>to the political economy of information and the cultural politics of copyright. It 
</p>
<p>has also sought to foreground public-interest considerations within international 
</p>
<p>intellectual property policy. The terms established by work on the public domain 
</p>
<p>enable the articulation of alternative normative claims to contest stricter intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property standards and the reintroduction of the public interest into intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property policy. They have also been very useful in challenging moves 
</p>
<p>toward the greater criminalization of infringements on intellectual property rights. 
</p>
<p>However, here again, while the scholarship on intellectual property and the public 
</p>
<p>domain has been highly inspiring and influential for work in South Asia, it offers 
</p>
<p>no easy fit with the concerns of daily life in that region and the role that intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property and the conflicts surrounding it play there.
</p>
<p> The concept of intellectual property in many of these countries has been 
</p>
<p>unfolded through the dual tropes of the triumphalist fantasy of harnessing intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property &ldquo;to catch up with the West&rdquo; and an account of paralyzing fear and 
</p>
<p>images of the ruin, destruction, and violence that surround the reality of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property infringement. The latter is best exemplified by the sharp conflicts 
</p>
<p>and anxieties over the prevailing mediascape (from nonlegal software to cheap 
</p>
<p>DVDs) that are a part of the contemporary urban experience in most countries. The 
</p>
<p>dominant account of the unfolding of the new-media experience in these countries 
</p>
<p>is also marked by the hyperprofiling of the act of piracy and the emergence of the 
</p>
<p>figure of the pirate.3
</p>
<p> It would seem almost paradoxical to suggest, as the title of this paper does, 
</p>
<p>that there is a representational problem that emerges with respect to the figure 
</p>
<p>of the pirate in contemporary discourse. If accounts in the mainstream media are 
</p>
<p>anything to go by, it would seem that the figure of the media pirate is everywhere, 
</p>
<p>and the problem would seem to be one of overrepresentation. However, we are 
</p>
<p>not concerned with the way in which the pirate is narrated as a figure of illegality 
</p>
<p>by the usual suspects, such as Jack Valenti (the longtime president of the Motion 
</p>
<p>Picture Association of America), or the RIAA (the Recording Industry Association 
</p>
<p>of America), or, closer home, the Indian Performers Rights Society, all of whom </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>356
</p>
<p>have argued for a more stringent enforcement of copyright. My focus instead is on 
</p>
<p>the role of the pirate in the debate on intellectual property and the public domain 
</p>
<p>that has emerged over the past few years to challenge the hegemonic account of  
</p>
<p>intellectual property.
</p>
<p>While the critical scholarship on intellectual property has been vital in the framing 
</p>
<p>of an alternative paradigm, a quick survey of the range of debates also reveals the 
</p>
<p>relative absence of any serious engagement with the world of quotidian nonle-
</p>
<p>gal media consumption and circulation&mdash;or media piracy. This is surprising, given 
</p>
<p>that intellectual property plays itself out in everyday life through an extraordinary 
</p>
<p>focus on the pirate. What is it about the nature of piracy that creates this uncom-
</p>
<p>fortable silence around it? Or is it possible that there is instead something about 
</p>
<p>the way in which the critical responses to intellectual property have been framed 
</p>
<p>that makes it impossible for them to deal with piracy or for piracy to redeem 
</p>
<p>itself? Perhaps we will have to start asking different kinds of questions if we are to 
</p>
<p>understand the status of the pirate in contemporary intellectual property debates 
</p>
<p>and move beyond it.
</p>
<p> Let&rsquo;s first look at the various ways in which the figure of the pirate enters the 
</p>
<p>contemporary discourse of intellectual property. In the predominant logic of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property enforcers, the pirate is demonized, seen as the ultimate embodi-
</p>
<p>ment of evil. That evil takes a variety of forms, from terrorism and the criminal 
</p>
<p>underworld to causing the decline of the entertainment industry and evading of 
</p>
<p>taxes. The figure of the pirate as criminal invites the legal attention of the state 
</p>
<p>and of private enforcers. In recent times, the criminalized figure of the pirate has 
</p>
<p>also become the subject of media attention, and rarely does a day go by without 
</p>
<p>some sensational account of a raid.4
</p>
<p> At the other end of the spectrum, that is, among those who work on limiting 
</p>
<p>the expansion of intellectual property rights and on defending the public domain, 
</p>
<p>the figure of the pirate is treated with embarrassed silence or outright disavowal. 
</p>
<p>In Richard Stallman&rsquo;s work for instance, it is very clear that piracy is as unaccept-
</p>
<p>able to the free-software movement as it is to copyright enforcers. The signifi-
</p>
<p>cant difference is that they would not argue for more criminalization or stronger 
</p>
<p>enforcement and would have a more charitable understanding of the phenome-
</p>
<p>non, based on their reading of political economy.5
</p>
<p> Scholars such as Lawrence Lessig and others have responded to the debate on 
</p>
<p>intellectual property by looking beyond the binaries of legality/illegality that are 
</p>
<p>set up by traditional copyright law, but when it comes to piracy, there still has been 
</p>
<p>no effort to accommodate the concept of piracy within the accepted discursive 
</p>
<p>liang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>357
</p>
<p>parameters of the debate. What, then, is the exact problem of piracy and why can 
</p>
<p>it not be accommodated within the terms of public-domain theorists? Surely, it 
</p>
<p>cannot be just the fact that it is tainted by illegality, since many other acts, includ-
</p>
<p>ing downloading music, are also tainted by illegality. Yet there are ways in which 
</p>
<p>these acts find redemption, while the pirate cannot. Is the problem peculiar to the 
</p>
<p>nature of this particular illegal act, the domain within which it operates, and the 
</p>
<p>subjectivities that it interpellates?
</p>
<p> The resistance to the concept and practice of piracy seems to be affected by 
</p>
<p>several factors. First, it is seen as compromised because it is a commercial enter-
</p>
<p>prise. Since piracy operates within the logic of profit and within the terms of com-
</p>
<p>merce, it cannot claim the sort of moral ground that other nonlegal media prac-
</p>
<p>tices can. For critics of the copyright regime dominated by media conglomerates, 
</p>
<p>it would be an embarrassment to admit that they are supporting a nonlegal com-
</p>
<p>mercial enterprise. Their stance against piracy may therefore stem from either a 
</p>
<p>strategic or an ethical position. The strategic stance against piracy may for instance 
</p>
<p>be adopted by people who do not per se have any serious objections to piracy, 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>358
</p>
<p>but who recognize that it would be counterproductive, in their struggle against 
</p>
<p>stricter intellectual property regimes, for them to be seen as espousing commercial 
</p>
<p>piracy. On the other hand, there are a number of advocates for the free-software 
</p>
<p>movement, including Stallman and Lessig, who would argue that even if a certain 
</p>
<p>law exists and we do not agree with it, either we have to reform the law or create 
</p>
<p>an alternative legal paradigm. However, if the law exists, we cannot encourage the 
</p>
<p>violation of such a law.
</p>
<p> Another reason for the suspicion of commercial piracy, in this case in relation 
</p>
<p>to entertainment, stems from the fact that what is pirated often pertains to the 
</p>
<p>domain of pleasure. Unlike access to affordable medicines and access to learning 
</p>
<p>materials, piracy that provides people with low-cost DVDs, MP3s, and other copy-
</p>
<p>righted content seems to lack pragmatic justification and simply fulfils consumers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>desires. We will examine this in some detail later.
</p>
<p> Yet another critique of commercial piracy is that unlike young musicians who 
</p>
<p>illegally download, then remix the music to produce new music, those who under-
</p>
<p>take piracy for purely commercial ends are unable to redeem their actions by 
</p>
<p>claiming that they encourage and support further acts of creativity. Instead, in the 
</p>
<p>case of commercial piracy, there is a slavish making of copies without any transfor-
</p>
<p>mative redemption.
</p>
<p> Finally, any justification of piracy is seen to fall within larger accounts of the 
</p>
<p>collapse of the rule of law. Scholars working on understanding the phenomenon of 
</p>
<p>piracy are accused of romanticizing illegality, and a sympathetic look at piracy is 
</p>
<p>equated with support for anarchy and lawlessness.
</p>
<p> Because piracy thus has not been able to be accommodated within the terms 
</p>
<p>of public-domain theory, we need to understand how the terms of representa-
</p>
<p>tion that public domain scholarship sets for itself operate to effect this exclusion. 
</p>
<p>Although the public domain has emerged as the most viable alternative to the 
</p>
<p>expansion of intellectual property, the question is whether the public domain is 
</p>
<p>the only way by which we can understand both the contemporary conflicts around 
</p>
<p>intellectual property and the limits of the approach with regard to accounting for 
</p>
<p>the status of piracy. Can the world of the public domain and the world of the pirate 
</p>
<p>be narrated as though there is a seamless web that should necessarily tie the two?
</p>
<p> In many ways, advocates for the public domain deploy classical terms of rep-
</p>
<p>resentation that they borrow from either political or cultural theory. These terms 
</p>
<p>include the classical categories of citizenship, resistance, and creativity.6 One of the 
</p>
<p>problems that we have when we try to understand piracy is that it often does not 
</p>
<p>fit within any of these existing categories, and there is a positivity or excess in the 
</p>
<p>body of the pirate that cannot be disavowed. As we have noted, the only manner 
</p>
<p>in which the copyright infringer is rescued from the accusation of being an illegal 
</p>
<p>liang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>359
</p>
<p>pirate is through an act of redemption, for instance by showing that his or her acts 
</p>
<p>of infringement actually result in an increase in creativity, and this redemption is 
</p>
<p>formalized in doctrines such as the idea of &ldquo;transformative authorship.&rdquo; But what 
</p>
<p>happens to entire realms of nontransformative authorship or &ldquo;Asian piracy,&rdquo; which 
</p>
<p>does not necessarily transform anything, but merely reproduces ceaselessly using 
</p>
<p>cheap technologies?
</p>
<p> The high priest of open content and the founder of the Creative Commons 
</p>
<p>movement has this to say:
</p>
<p>All across the world, but especially in Asia and Eastern Europe, there are businesses 
</p>
<p>that do nothing but take others people&rsquo;s copyrighted content, copy it, and sell it&mdash;
</p>
<p>all without the permission of a copyright owner. The recording industry estimates 
</p>
<p>that it loses about $4.6 billion every year to physical piracy (that works out to one 
</p>
<p>in three CDs sold worldwide). The MPAA estimates that it loses $3 billion annually 
</p>
<p>worldwide to piracy. This is piracy plain and simple. Nothing in the argument of this 
</p>
<p>book, nor in the argument that most people make when talking about the subject of 
</p>
<p>this book, should draw into doubt this simple point:
</p>
<p> This piracy is wrong. . . .
</p>
<p> The copy shops in Asia, by contrast, are violating Asian law. Asian law does 
</p>
<p>protect foreign copyrights, and the actions of the copy shops violate that law. So the 
</p>
<p>wrong of piracy that they engage in is not just a moral wrong, but a legal wrong, and 
</p>
<p>not just an internationally legal wrong, but a locally legal wrong as well.7
</p>
<p>How do we read this as part of an account of the public domain? While one can 
</p>
<p>understand that Lessig would have to be careful about the ways in which he pitches 
</p>
<p>a reform of copyright law within the context of the United States, it is also difficult 
</p>
<p>not to miss the linkages in this paragraph to older accounts of illegality in Asia. 
</p>
<p>In many such accounts, the urban experience in Asia&mdash;and in Latin America&mdash; 
</p>
<p>has been narrated in terms of its preponderant criminality and illegality. This is 
</p>
<p>particularly true not merely in the context of the colonial imagination, but also in 
</p>
<p>the ways that cities and everyday life in Asia are understood. The United States 
</p>
<p>has always narrated itself through the tropes of constitutionalism and the rule of 
</p>
<p>law, but with the arrival of Internet, all of a sudden, the language of criminality 
</p>
<p>and illegality that was used to account by contrast for much of the world arrives 
</p>
<p>home in the ordinary form of the criminalization of students downloading music. 
</p>
<p>Clearly, one cannot have an account of such pervasive illegality in a country that 
</p>
<p>prides itself on its constitutional tradition and its emphasis on the rule of law.
</p>
<p> Consequently, one narrative strategy is to redeem the acts of ordinary Ameri-
</p>
<p>can citizens through the discursive construction of an other&mdash;in this case an 
</p>
<p>Asian other. The categories of the public domain serve as the neutral ground on 
</p>
<p>  the figure of the pirate</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>360
</p>
<p>which the two kinds of pirates are pitted, and the terms of reference of this public 
</p>
<p>domain are the received notions of creativity and innovation.
</p>
<p> Underlying much of copyright&rsquo;s mythology are the modernist ideas of creativ-
</p>
<p>ity, innovation, and progress. The narrative conjunction of these ideas is repre-
</p>
<p>sented as universal, and indeed, it is shared by both advocates of stronger copy-
</p>
<p>right and advocates of the public domain.8 By offering themselves as alternative 
</p>
<p>accounts of the idea of progress and creativity, arguments for the public domain 
</p>
<p>merely seek to provide a counterfactual: While copyright aspires to promote cre-
</p>
<p>ativity, it actually fails to do this, and excessive protection has actually resulted in 
</p>
<p>a decrease of creativity or a threat to creativity.
</p>
<p> The difference between scholars who advocate for the public domain and 
</p>
<p>copyright advocates lies in their understanding and interpretation of the idea of 
</p>
<p>the creative. Lessig insists that we should protect some illegal works, based on the 
</p>
<p>criterion of &ldquo;transformativity,&rdquo; but the creative subject invoked here is in fact a 
</p>
<p>very particular kind of subject&mdash;a disembodied classical liberal subject. The pub-
</p>
<p>lic domain is represented as a space in which everyone can participate as citizens 
</p>
<p>bearing equal rights. The linking of public-domain theories to the freedom of 
</p>
<p>speech and expression is not accidental, and the model of the public domain as the 
</p>
<p>sphere of rational communication borrows from existing accounts of the public/
</p>
<p>private divide.9
</p>
<p> Many postcolonial scholars have seriously contested the category of the citizen 
</p>
<p>as the universal bearer of rights, and the representative capacity of the citizen 
</p>
<p>to participate in the public sphere as an unmarked individual remains mythical, 
</p>
<p>at best. In India, for instance, the creation of the category of the citizen subject 
</p>
<p>demanded a move away from the oversignified body of the individual marked by 
</p>
<p>religion, gender, caste, and so on to an unmarked subject position, &ldquo;the citizen,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>a category based on equality and access and guaranteed rights within the consti-
</p>
<p>tutional framework. But the majority of the people in India are only precarious 
</p>
<p>citizens who often do not have the ability to claim rights in the same manner as 
</p>
<p>the Indian elite do. Instead, the manner in which they access the institutions of 
</p>
<p>democracy and &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is often through complex negotiations and networks and 
</p>
<p>often is marked by their illegal status.10
</p>
<p> In their work on &ldquo;rowdy sheeters&rdquo;&mdash;individuals with a criminal record, or &ldquo;rap 
</p>
<p>sheet,&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s called in the United States&mdash;Vivek Dhareshwar and R. Srivatsan sug-
</p>
<p>gest that &ldquo;some bodies&mdash;like the &lsquo;rowdy&rsquo; or the &lsquo;lumpen&rsquo;&mdash;will not be disincorpo-
</p>
<p>rated,&rdquo; that is, made to &ldquo;speak and act as a citizen, &ldquo;so tied are [sic] their shameful 
</p>
<p>positivity to their bodies.&rdquo; Thus, the project of disincorporation into citizenship 
</p>
<p>almost immediately creates a discursive other, the illegal citizen who refuses to 
</p>
<p>shed his or her social excesses or who just cannot do so.11 Thus, while citizenship

<p>361
</p>
<p>and modernity are normatively constructed as highly desirable and the grand proj-
</p>
<p>ect wills everyone into a state of modernity, there arises from the start a clear 
</p>
<p>lack or inability in the bulk of the population to occupy this space. So what hap-
</p>
<p>pens when people fall off these official maps and plans? How do they find their 
</p>
<p>way back into official memory and create for themselves avenues of participa-
</p>
<p>tion? There is a great deal of work to be done on engaging with how people create 
</p>
<p>vibrant spaces outside of official plans and spaces, and more often than not, these 
</p>
<p>spaces are marked by their high degree of illegality.
</p>
<p> Pirates are among those unable to shed these illegal excesses and play a role in 
</p>
<p>or become a part of a reconstituted public domain. Pirates cannot play a role there, 
</p>
<p>because they cannot claim the representative status given to the transforming cre-
</p>
<p>ator within the productive public domain. There are very few possibilities for the 
</p>
<p>pirate to occupy the normative terms established in the public domain for the cre-
</p>
<p>ative citizen. And yet, despite this, a look at both history and the present indicates 
</p>
<p>that there is a certain stubbornness on the part of those who do not find a represen-
</p>
<p>tative space in the public domain&mdash;those who refuse to disappear and instead coex-
</p>
<p>ist at the margins of civil society and the law and at the margins of the narrative 
</p>
<p>dominated by the creative, innovative citizen. Historically, for instance, there is an 
</p>
<p>entire realm that is inhabited by figures such as the trickster, the copier, the thief, 
</p>
<p>and the pirate, figures who inhabit a marginal site of production and circulation.12
</p>
<p> If we move away from the normative account of the creator citizen and engage 
</p>
<p>with an entire set of practices that renders any straightforward representation 
</p>
<p>impossible or difficult, what intellectual horizons open out? As with any journey 
</p>
<p>into unfamiliar terrain, it might be useful to have a few maps charted during previ-
</p>
<p>ous moments of anxiety to help guide us. As with any maps, these are only tenta-
</p>
<p>tive and provisional guides.
</p>
<p> The simplistic opposition between legality and illegality that divides pirates 
</p>
<p>from others renders almost impossible any serious understanding or engagement 
</p>
<p>with the phenomenon of piracy. Following Nietzsche, we should perhaps advo-
</p>
<p>cate the virtues of slow reading. The dizzying speed with which one is forced to 
</p>
<p>respond to issues in the era of globalization can sometimes hinder any reasoned 
</p>
<p>response. The first task for us is to avoid the Enlightenment blackmail, a variant 
</p>
<p>of which in recent times has been the blackmail of &ldquo;You are either for terrorism or 
</p>
<p>support the war on terror.&rdquo; In other words, before we jump into making normative 
</p>
<p>policy interventions, which often draws black-and-white distinctions, we need to 
</p>
<p>explore the various shades and depths of gray. We would only ask for patience 
</p>
<p>from the scholars of the public domain and ask the same careful attention that 
</p>
<p>they pay to understanding the larger political and cultural politics of copyright 
</p>
<p>when they look at the phenomenon of piracy.

</p>
<p> Let us reformulate our object of enquiry. Let&rsquo;s take for granted the illegal status 
</p>
<p>of piracy, but let&rsquo;s not stop there. Instead, it might be more useful for us to ask not 
</p>
<p>what piracy is, but what piracy does. The shift in focus from the discursive and 
</p>
<p>moral representation of the illegal deed to the wider social world in which the deed 
</p>
<p>is located allows us to bring to light the nature of the law that names a particular 
</p>
<p>act as an illegal one.
</p>
<p> And the naming of the deed as an illegal act indeed prevents us from reflecting 
</p>
<p>on the nature of the act. When we look for instance at the act of sharing, it is an 
</p>
<p>act immediately invested with a sense of virtue. But the same act when rendered 
</p>
<p>through the prism of private property becomes an act of infringement and a crime. 
</p>
<p>The debate between morality and ethics is now a familiar one, and indeed, it might 
</p>
<p>even be argued that the law&rsquo;s monopoly over official definitions of morality does 
</p>
<p>not render obsolete the question of whether an act can still be considered in terms 
</p>
<p>of ethics.
</p>
<p> The shift away from what piracy is to what piracy does enables us to consider 
</p>
<p>on the same plane its linkages to the normative considerations for which public-
</p>
<p>domain advocates argue and that they are often unable to achieve. The best exam-
</p>
<p>ple is in the area of cheap books. While public-domain advocates try to reform 
</p>
<p>copyright law to enable more educational exceptions, pirated books and the unau-
</p>
<p>thorized photocopying that is the order of the day accomplishes what they can-
</p>
<p>not. Rather than looking at the neat spaces created by the opposition between 
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;legal&rdquo; and the &ldquo;illegal,&rdquo; it might be more fruitful to consider the spaces in 
</p>
<p>which piracy plays itself out, the transforming urban landscapes and the specific 
</p>
<p>histories of the nooks and crannies that render this space an illegal one, along with 
</p>
<p>the accumulated histories of regulation, tactics, and negotiations that render this 
</p>
<p>topography intelligible.
</p>
<p> Definitions of legality do not exist in a vacuum, and they are constituted 
</p>
<p>through specificities and relationships, even as they attempt to define constitutive 
</p>
<p>legal and social relations.13 Similarly stories of law and legality have to find a space 
</p>
<p>in which they resonate, and often they exist as abstract, unintelligible murmurs. 
</p>
<p>For instance, when the story of copyright piracy is narrated, it is usually through 
</p>
<p>the language of statistics and figures and the narrative strategy of excess, designed 
</p>
<p>to induce a &ldquo;shock and awe&rdquo; response at the alarming rate of piracy and illegal-
</p>
<p>ity that exists, especially in non-Western countries, and it rarely succeeds in its 
</p>
<p>desired effect.
</p>
<p> To understand why these stories don&rsquo;t work in some contexts, we will have to 
</p>
<p>travel to distant cities such as Delhi and Sao Paulo and perhaps even walk through 
</p>
<p>the more unfamiliar byways of familiar cities such as New York. The discipline of 
</p>
<p>urban studies has made the idea of &ldquo;the illegal city&rdquo; familiar to us. One reads, for 
</p>
<p>liang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>363
</p>
<p>instance, that an average of 40 percent and in some cases 70 percent of the popula-
</p>
<p>tion of major cities lives in illegal conditions. Furthermore, 70 to 95 percent of all 
</p>
<p>new housing is built illegally.14 How do we understand this older idea of illegality 
</p>
<p>alongside the new illegality of the mediatized city? The task will be to pose the 
</p>
<p>question of how the older form and the newer form integrate and intertwine&mdash;to 
</p>
<p>interrogate our classical liberal assumptions of legality and highlight the limita-
</p>
<p>tions of any study based on a strictly legal understanding of contemporary urban 
</p>
<p>practices.
</p>
<p> Writing about the modernist project of planning, James Holstrom and Arjun 
</p>
<p>Appadurai note:
</p>
<p>modernist planning does not admit or develop productively the paradoxes of its 
</p>
<p>imagined futures. Instead it attempts to be a plan without contradictions or conflict. 
</p>
<p>It assumes a rational domination of the future in which its total and totalizing plan 
</p>
<p>dissolves any conflict between the imagined and existing society in the enforced 
</p>
<p>coherence of its order. This assumption is false and arrogant as it fails to include as 
</p>
<p>its constituent element, the conflict, ambiguity and indeterminacy characteristic of 
</p>
<p>actual social life.15
</p>
<p> The information era props up a master plan similar to that of modernist plan-
</p>
<p>ning. The institutional imagination of the era relies on the World Trade Organiza-
</p>
<p>tion (WTO) as the chief architect and planner and copyright lawyers as the execu-
</p>
<p>tive managers of this new plan, while the only people who retain their jobs from 
</p>
<p>the old city are the executors of the old plan, the police force and the demolition 
</p>
<p>squad. Just as one cannot understand land tenure in terms of the classical liberal 
</p>
<p>concept of legality alone, any attempt to understand the complex networks of eco-
</p>
<p>nomic and social relations that underlie the phenomenon of piracy will have to 
</p>
<p>engage with the conflict over control of the means of technological and cultural 
</p>
<p>production in the contemporary moment of globalization. The ways in which the 
</p>
<p>illegal media city emerges and coexists alongside the vibrant, innovative, and pro-
</p>
<p>ductive debris of the older city and the schizoid relationships between legality and 
</p>
<p>illegality in postcolonial cities suggest that we may need to turn the gaze of the 
</p>
<p>law from the usual suspects of legality to legality itself and to the relations that 
</p>
<p>underlie its existence.16
</p>
<p> The transformation of the urban experience in the past few years and the pro-
</p>
<p>liferation of the labyrinth experience of media forms have made pirate cultures a 
</p>
<p>significant part of the experience of our contemporary era. What is perhaps dif-
</p>
<p>ferent about the media experience in non-Western countries is the fact that there 
</p>
<p>are no clear lines between the old and the new media, between physical and vir-
</p>
<p>tual experience, and often, the virtual extends from high-end shopping malls,

</p>
<p>to low-end cybercaf&eacute;s, to pirate markets. This comfortable moving to and fro 
</p>
<p>between different mediatized spaces creates a sensorial experience in which dif-
</p>
<p>ferent classes actualize the global experience differently.
</p>
<p> Piracy transforms the technological experience, which traditionally has been 
</p>
<p>rooted either in monumentalist visions of development (the discourse on informa-
</p>
<p>tion and communication technologies for development) or in the aspirational imagi-
</p>
<p>nation of the elite in India (Bangalore&rsquo;s aspirations to be Singapore), and it provides 
</p>
<p>an entry point for a much wider array of people to experience on their own terms 
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;information era.&rdquo; The cheap CD or DVD supplements the experience of cyber-
</p>
<p>space while at the same time being rooted within diverse spaces in the city. Even 
</p>
<p>as the urban landscape is being transformed and older media spaces such as movie 
</p>
<p>theaters give way to high-rise malls with multiplexes, and even as the spaces of tra-
</p>
<p>ditional mass media begin to shrink because of their prohibitive prices, you see the 
</p>
<p>emergence of a widely distributed chain of the circulation of media commodities 
</p>
<p>that challenges the regime of intellectual property. The crisis of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty is narrated into the crisis of South Asian cities in general, and interventions 
</p>
<p>in implementing property rules sit alongside lamentful pleas for reworking urban

</p>
<p>the celebratory approach of radical new-media activists or scholars of the public 
</p>
<p>domain is that the world of a quotidian media experience does not articulate itself 
</p>
<p>in the terms of resistance or appropriation. Piracy obviously does not stake a claim 
</p>
<p>in the world of official creativity, either. It remains what it is: a culture of the copy 
</p>
<p>that exists alongside livelihood and labor, profit and pornography.
</p>
<p>rethinking creativity: pirate infrastructures
</p>
<p>A world of everyday media that transforms our contemporary experience and yet 
</p>
<p>paradoxically does not make a claim to creativity as it is commonly understood 
</p>
<p>invites us to revisit our ideas of creativity&rsquo;s relation to the copy.17 The reproduc-
</p>
<p>ible work that brings into play a network of circulation also inaugurates a series of 
</p>
<p>cultural possibilities and readings.
</p>
<p> Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault have already enabled us to shift our 
</p>
<p>understanding of the locus of originality and creativity from the text and look for 
</p>
<p>it instead in the process of consumption. What would happen if we also extended 
</p>
<p>the search for creativity into the domain of circulation? The production and cir-
</p>
<p>culation of the ubiquitous pirate DVD, that prized commodity of pirate aesthetics, 
</p>
<p>helps us understand the possibility of creative acts outside the domain of what is 
</p>
<p>traditionally considered &ldquo;creative.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> To do so, we need to consider the conditions under which DVDs, these new 
</p>
<p>products of digital reproduction, are pirated and circulate. Brian Larkin&rsquo;s work on 
</p>
<p>piracy in Nigeria, for example, forces us not merely to look at and listen to the 
</p>
<p>onscreen content of videos, but also to focus on those conditions of appropriation 
</p>
<p>and circulation. Larkin demonstrates the critical importance of paying attention 
</p>
<p>to the infrastructures of production in developing countries, where the process of 
</p>
<p>cultural production is tied to the relative lack of infrastructure and becomes the 
</p>
<p>basis for the transformation of the conditions of production by generating a paral-
</p>
<p>lel economy of low-cost infrastructure. He says that &ldquo;a cycle of breakdown, repair, 
</p>
<p>and breakdown again is the condition of existence for many technologies in Nige-
</p>
<p>ria. As a consequence, Nigeria employs a vast army of people who specialize in 
</p>
<p>repairing and reconditioning broken technological goods, since the need for repair 
</p>
<p>is frequent and the cost of it cheap.&rdquo;18
</p>
<p> This economy of recycling, which Ravi Sundaram describes as &ldquo;pirate modern,&rdquo;19 
</p>
<p>becomes the arena for all sorts of technological innovation and extends further to 
</p>
<p>experiments with cultural forms such as parodies, remixes, cover versions, and so 
</p>
<p>on. In a sense, Larkin&rsquo;s invocation of the importance of infrastructure contrasts 
</p>
<p>with the obsessive fixation with content that one sees in most Western accounts of 
</p>
<p>creativity, although in fact, on a metaphorical level, infrastructure frequently gets 
</p>
<p>  the figure of the pirate</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>366
</p>
<p>invoked in Western discourses as a way to understand the public domain of ideas, 
</p>
<p>with references to &ldquo;the well of ideas,&rdquo; &ldquo;bridging the information gap,&rdquo; &ldquo;the infor-
</p>
<p>mation superhighway,&rdquo; and so on. In piracy, however, the content also has to be 
</p>
<p>filtered through the regime of its own production. Piracy imposes particular condi-
</p>
<p>tions on the recording, transmission, and retrieval of data. Constant copying erodes 
</p>
<p>data storage, degrades image and sound, and overwhelms the signal of the media 
</p>
<p>content with the noise produced by the means of reproduction. Larkin says that 
</p>
<p>since pirated videos are often characterized by blurred images and distorted sound, 
</p>
<p>they create a kind of material space &ldquo;that filters audiences&rsquo; engagement with media 
</p>
<p>technologies and their senses of time, speed, space, and contemporaneity. In this 
</p>
<p>way, piracy creates an aesthetic, a set of formal qualities that generates a particu-
</p>
<p>lar sensorial experience of media marked by poor transmission, interference, and 
</p>
<p>noise.&rdquo;20 Larkin uses the question of pirate infrastructure to open out the debate on 
</p>
<p>intellectual property and to foreground the importance of addressing the question 
</p>
<p>of content while looking at the legal aspects of culture. If infrastructures represent 
</p>
<p>attempts to order, regulate, and rationalize society, then breakdowns in their opera-
</p>
<p>tion and the rise of provisional and informal infrastructures highlight both the fail-
</p>
<p>ure of that ordering and the recoding that takes its place.
</p>
<p> When we subject the material operation of piracy and its social consequences 
</p>
<p>to scrutiny, it becomes clear that pirate infrastructure is a powerful mediating force 
</p>
<p>that produces new modes of organizing sensory perception, time, space, and eco-
</p>
<p>nomic networks.21 Doing so also forces us to acknowledge the material linkages 
</p>
<p>between content and infrastructure. One of the significant approaches used by 
</p>
<p>scholars of the public domain is an emphasis on the ability to create new con-
</p>
<p>tent building on existing works. This overemphasis on the creation of new con-
</p>
<p>tent raises the question of who uses the new content and what the relationship 
</p>
<p>is between such content and the democratization of infrastructures. In most 
</p>
<p>cases, the reason for the fall in price of computers and other electronic goods and 
</p>
<p>the increase in access to materials via the increase in photocopiers and the gen-
</p>
<p>eral infrastructure of information flows is not caused by any radical revolution 
</p>
<p>such as free software or open content, but by the easier availability of standard, 
</p>
<p>mainstream commodities such as those produced by Microsoft and Hollywood. 
</p>
<p>When Stallman and others castigate people for pirating Hollywood&rsquo;s productions, 
</p>
<p>it is only because they are in the position of being able to disavow the global 
</p>
<p>economy. But for many people, finding their place within the global economy 
</p>
<p>includes engaging with a world of counterfeit commodities, replicating the global  
</p>
<p>economy&rsquo;s output.
</p>
<p> We can play the game of seizing the higher moral ground and speak of the 
</p>
<p>real information needs of these people, or we can provide crude theories of how 
</p>
<p>liang</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>367
</p>
<p>they are trapped by false consciousness. Or better yet, we can move away from 
</p>
<p>these judgmental perspectives and look at other aspects of globalization, such as 
</p>
<p>the impact that the expansion of the market for these gray-market goods has on 
</p>
<p>the general pricing of goods, on the spread of computer/Internet-technology cul-
</p>
<p>ture, on lowering the price of consumables such as blank CDs and DVDs, on the 
</p>
<p>popularity of CD writers, and so on. I find it a little strange and messianic that 
</p>
<p>people who preach about access also preach about the kinds of access that should 
</p>
<p>be allowed.
</p>
<p>pleasurable transgressions
</p>
<p>Such prohibitions take many forms. As I noted before, one of the objections to 
</p>
<p>piracy seems to lie in the fact that it is associated more with the world of pleasure 
</p>
<p>and desire than with meeting &ldquo;pure needs.&rdquo; Let me begin to discuss this objec-
</p>
<p>tion in greater depth with an interesting story about the intersection between the 
</p>
<p>world of desire, subjectivity and the experience of piracy. It is a typical example 
</p>
<p>of interventions in the field of the digital divide. An NGO in Bangalore that works 
</p>
<p>in the field of information and communication technologies for development was 
</p>
<p>conducting a workshop on accessing the Internet for the information needs of 
</p>
<p>rural women working to empower other poor rural women in India. The facilita-
</p>
<p>tor guided the women through the basics of the Internet, including how to access 
</p>
<p>information relevant to their work, which ranges from providing access to credit to 
</p>
<p>promoting women&rsquo;s health. The training was highly appreciated, and all the women 
</p>
<p>volunteers seemed to be enjoying themselves while fiddling with the comput-
</p>
<p>ers and exploring the Internet. At the end of the training, when the NGO started 
</p>
<p>cleaning up the computers, including the browsing histories and the cached copies 
</p>
<p>of the sites accessed, they were a little aghast to find that most of the women vol-
</p>
<p>unteers had been surfing pornography&mdash;and a range of pornography, at that. So 
</p>
<p>while the trainers were holding forth eloquently about the real information needs 
</p>
<p>of the poor, the poor were quite happy to access their real information needs.
</p>
<p> The links between pleasure, desire, aspiration, and trespass have always been 
</p>
<p>complicated, and the closer that the transgressive act is to the domain of pleasure, 
</p>
<p>the more difficult it seems for it to be redeemed socially. Thus, while one finds 
</p>
<p>easier justifications for transgressions that deal with questions of livelihood and 
</p>
<p>survival, and in the case of intellectual property, easier justifications for transgres-
</p>
<p>sions that appeal to claims to free speech and access to information, when the mat-
</p>
<p>ter involved is about new subjectivities and pleasurable transgressions, the issue 
</p>
<p>gets very differently framed. In particular, the terms set up by existing scholar-
</p>
<p>ship on the public domain end up excluding the ability to engage with practices 
</p>
<p>  the figure of the pirate</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>368
</p>
<p>guided not as much by necessity as by curiosity. The rhetoric of inclusiveness that 
</p>
<p>is implicit in discourse on the issue of the public domain is necessarily accompa-
</p>
<p>nied by the prospect of exclusion, an exclusion that relies on either piety or peda-
</p>
<p>gogy. What happens when we move toward the realm of nonlegal media practices, 
</p>
<p>where all of a sudden the transgression is highly pleasurable, but not in any way 
</p>
<p>connected to the essential character of what Gayatri Spivak calls the &ldquo;subaltern 
</p>
<p>subject&rdquo;?22 The sheer proliferation of these practices, both within the elite and also 
</p>
<p>by the traditional subaltern classes, forces us to question our own assumptions 
</p>
<p>about the terms in which people engage with the global economy of information 
</p>
<p>and go about finding their place in the global economy. What critical conceptual 
</p>
<p>resources can we draw on to address the question of pleasurable transgressions 
</p>
<p>and subjectivities that resist easy framing?
</p>
<p> Jacques Ranci&egrave;re paves the way for us to start thinking seriously about the 
</p>
<p>hidden domain of aspiration and desire of the subaltern subject while at the same 
</p>
<p>time thinking about the politics of our own aspirations and desires. Ranci&egrave;re 
</p>
<p>examines an unexplored aspect of the labor archive of nineteenth-century France: 
</p>
<p>small, obscure, and short-lived journals brought out by workers in which they 
</p>
<p>were writing about their own lives. But they were not necessarily writing about 
</p>
<p>their work, and if they were, they were not writing about it in glorified terms, but 
</p>
<p>with immense dissatisfaction. For the most part, however, they were interested 
</p>
<p>in writing poetry, writing about philosophy, and indulging in other pleasures in 
</p>
<p>which nonworkers or intellectuals were entitled to indulge. Of course, from the 
</p>
<p>other side of the class divide, intellectuals have been fascinated with the world of 
</p>
<p>work and the romance of working-class identity. Ranci&egrave;re asks &ldquo;what new forms 
</p>
<p>of misreading will affect this contradiction when the discourse of labourers in love 
</p>
<p>with the intellectual nights of the intellectuals encounters the discourse of intel-
</p>
<p>lectuals in love with the toilsome and glorious days of the labouring people?&rdquo;23
</p>
<p> Ranci&egrave;re&rsquo;s motley cast of characters include Jerome Gillard, an ironsmith 
</p>
<p>tired of hammering iron, and Pierre Vincard, a metal worker who aspires to be a 
</p>
<p>painter&mdash;in other words, people who refused to obey the role sketched out for 
</p>
<p>them by history and who wanted to step across the line and perform the truly 
</p>
<p>radical act of breaking down the time-honored barrier separating those who carry 
</p>
<p>out useful labor from those who ponder aesthetics. Ranci&egrave;re says:
</p>
<p>A worker who has never learned how to write and yet tried to compose verses to 
</p>
<p>suit the taste of his times was perhaps more of a danger to the prevailing ideologi-
</p>
<p>cal order than a worker who performed revolutionary songs. . . . Perhaps the truly 
</p>
<p>dangerous classes are not so much the uncivilized ones thought to undermine soci-
</p>
<p>ety from below, but rather the migrants who move at the borders between classes,  
</p>
<p>liang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>369
</p>
<p>individuals and groups who develop capabilities within themselves which are use-
</p>
<p>less for the improvement of their material lives and which in fact are liable to make 
</p>
<p>them despise material concerns.24
</p>
<p> The moral dictates that govern the lives of the poor are not imposed only by 
</p>
<p>the state (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t steal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t beg&rdquo;) but equally by those who theorize the lives 
</p>
<p>of the poor (&ldquo;Be aware of your class,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get trapped by false consciousness&rdquo;). 
</p>
<p>And when people start moving out of the frame of representation that has been 
</p>
<p>so carefully and almost lovingly crafted for them, they either have to be shown 
</p>
<p>their true essence or their transgressions have to be brought within the terms of 
</p>
<p>their representative class. Thus, when Victor Hugo was shown a poem written by 
</p>
<p>a worker, his embarrassed and patronizing response was, &ldquo;In your fine verse there 
</p>
<p>is something more than fine verse. There is a strong soul, a lofty heart, a noble and 
</p>
<p>robust spirit. Carry on. Always be what you are: poet and worker. That is to say, 
</p>
<p>thinker and worker.&rdquo;25 This is a classic instance of what Ranci&egrave;re would term an 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;exclusion by homage.&rdquo;26 Thus, the aspiration and desires of the poor have to be 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;something more than fine verse,&rdquo; and the information needs of the poor have to 
</p>
<p>be something more than wanting to watch a film or even dreaming of becoming a 
</p>
<p>filmmaker. These injunctions certainly tell us more about the fantasies of the state 
</p>
<p>and of the intellectuals than they do about people engaging in the fulfillment of 
</p>
<p>their aspirations and desires, and we may do well to start rethinking the terms in 
</p>
<p>which the scholars of intellectual property engage the language of access.
</p>
<p>revisiting the history of the commons and dispossession
</p>
<p>Prominent among the terms employed in recent scholarship on intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty and the public domain has been the metaphor of the modern commons and 
</p>
<p>the threat that it faces from this limitless expansion of intellectual property. More 
</p>
<p>often than not, the commons is allegorized as a mythical ideal governed by prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of sharing, access, and collaboration that was lost after the first enclosure 
</p>
<p>movement. The argument proceeds to caution against a similar enclosure, a second 
</p>
<p>enclosure movement in the realm of information ecology that threatens to priva-
</p>
<p>tize every aspect of information, thereby threatening creativity. The invocation of 
</p>
<p>the commons is indeed a useful starting point in discussions of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty regimes, but it would be incomplete if we did not acknowledge the histories 
</p>
<p>of contestation, conflict, and violence that accompanied the first enclosure move-
</p>
<p>ment and its subsequent history.
</p>
<p> Social historians of crime, for instance, have rigorously alerted us to the inter-
</p>
<p>twined histories of property and criminalization. It may therefore be insufficient for 
</p>
<p>  the figure of the pirate</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>370
</p>
<p>us to invoke the commons only in allegorical terms, and it may be more fruitful to 
</p>
<p>look at current conflicts as part of a wider historical continuum in a way that interro-
</p>
<p>gates the nature of contestation over the definition, the contours, and the enforce-
</p>
<p>ment of what constitutes &ldquo;property.&rdquo; The history of the commons is also a history of 
</p>
<p>criminalization and of the definition of the ideas of trespass and encroachment.
</p>
<p> In The Many-Headed Hydra, as a way of thinking about the challenges faced 
</p>
<p>by the world of capital, Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker begin with an invoca-
</p>
<p>tion of the twin myths of the Hydra and Hercules&rsquo; task of slaying it.27 Confronted 
</p>
<p>with the monstrous, many-headed water snake, the Hydra, Hercules found that 
</p>
<p>as soon as he cut off one head, two grew in its place. With the help of his nephew 
</p>
<p>Iolaus, he used a firebrand to cauterize the stump of the beast&rsquo;s neck. Thus they 
</p>
<p>killed the Hydra. Hercules then dipped his arrows in the blood of the slain beast, 
</p>
<p>whose venom gave his arrows a fatal power.
</p>
<p> Using the allegory of the Hydra to characterize the various obstacles that capi-
</p>
<p>tal has faced and, like Hercules, overcome from the eighteenth century to the pres-
</p>
<p>ent, Linebaugh and Rediker start with the material organization of many thou-
</p>
<p>sands of workers into transatlantic circuits of commodity exchange and capital 
</p>
<p>accumulation and then proceed to look at the ways in which they translated their 
</p>
<p>cooperation into anticapitalist projects of their own. The first enclosure movement 
</p>
<p>resulted in the expropriation of the commons, freed large territories for capitalist 
</p>
<p>agriculture, logging, mining, and speculation in land, and at the same time created 
</p>
<p>a vast army of the dispossessed, who were then freed to become wage earners in 
</p>
<p>new industrializing areas at home or abroad or who were criminalized by harsh 
</p>
<p>laws that imposed penal servitude in the colonies. Those dispossessed from the 
</p>
<p>land also became the bulk of the workforce for the new engine that transported 
</p>
<p>commodities across continents, the ship. Sailors and ships linked the modes of 
</p>
<p>production and expanded the international capitalist economy. The ship was also 
</p>
<p>the site of the coming together of diverse forms of labor and of diverse laborers 
</p>
<p>from different ethnicities, bound together by a pidgin tongue. The solidarity of 
</p>
<p>this motley crew, like many others in the era, was forged by their shared situation 
</p>
<p>of dispossession and their shared labor.
</p>
<p> Linebaugh and Rediker document in detail the very difficult conditions 
</p>
<p>under which these sailors worked and the dangers to which they were constantly 
</p>
<p>exposed, which at the same time created the conditions for solidarity among those 
</p>
<p>who would challenge the smooth flow of capital: pirates. The first pirates in this 
</p>
<p>sense were often &ldquo;the outcasts of the land&rdquo; who mutinied against the conditions 
</p>
<p>of their work and created an alternative order challenging the division of labor 
</p>
<p>and capital. In fashioning what Linebaugh and Rediker call their &ldquo;hydrachy,&rdquo; these 
</p>
<p>buccaneers often drew from the memory of utopias created by theoreticians in 
</p>
<p>liang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>371
</p>
<p>which work had been abolished, property redistributed, social distinctions lev-
</p>
<p>eled, health restored, and food made abundant. By expropriating a merchant ship 
</p>
<p>(after a mutiny or a capture), pirates seized the means of maritime production and 
</p>
<p>declared it to be the common property of those who did its work. Rather than 
</p>
<p>working for wages using the tools and larger machinery owned by a merchant cap-
</p>
<p>italist, pirates abolished the wage and commanded the ship as their property, shar-
</p>
<p>ing equally in the risks of common adventure.
</p>
<p> Piracy&rsquo;s redistribution of wealth was considered to be a massive international 
</p>
<p>problem, and pirates were declared to belong to no nation. In fact, piracy emerged 
</p>
<p>as one of the earliest crimes of universal global jurisdiction in a time when nation-
</p>
<p>states were still carving out their own local absolute sovereignties. But piracy 
</p>
<p>was not merely a problem of the failure of the implementation or enforcement of 
</p>
<p>the laws of property. Piracy also established an alternative ethic and an alternate 
</p>
<p>mode of being. Piracy was democratic in an undemocratic age and egalitarian in a 
</p>
<p>highly unequal age. Linebaugh and Rediker provide various accounts of instances 
</p>
<p>in which the pirate ship inverted all rules of social hierarchy and in which, for brief 
</p>
<p>spells, the laws of private property were suspended to allow for experimentation 
</p>
<p>with alternative social imaginaries, even if only very briefly.
</p>
<p> Summarizing the characteristics of this hydra of the era of early capitalism, 
</p>
<p>Linebaugh says:
</p>
<p>It was landless, exploited. It lost the integument of the commons to cover and pro-
</p>
<p>tect its needs. It was poor, lacking property, money, or material riches of any kind. 
</p>
<p>It was often unwaged, forced to perform the paid labors of capitalism. It was often 
</p>
<p>hungry, with uncertain means of survival. It was mobile, transatlantic. It powered 
</p>
<p>industries of worldwide transportation. It left the land, migrating from country to 
</p>
<p>town, from region to region, across the oceans, and from one island to another. It 
</p>
<p>was terrorized, subject to coersion. Its hide was calloused by indentured labor, gal-
</p>
<p>lery slavery, plantation slavery, convict transportation, the workhouse, the house 
</p>
<p>of correction. Its origins were often traumatic: enclosure, capture, and imprison-
</p>
<p>ment left lasting marks. It was female and male, of all ages. (Indeed, the very term 
</p>
<p>proletarian originally referred to poor women who served the state by bearing chil-
</p>
<p>dren.) It included everyone from youth to old folks, from ship&rsquo;s boys to old salts, 
</p>
<p>from apprentices to savvy old masters, from young prostitutes to old &ldquo;witches.&rdquo; It 
</p>
<p>was multitudinous, numerous, and growing. Whether in a square, at a market, on a 
</p>
<p>common, in a regiment, or on a man-of-war with banners flying and drums beat-
</p>
<p>ing, its gatherings were wondrous to contemporaries. It was numbered, weighed, and 
</p>
<p>measured. Unknown as individuals or by name, it was objectified and counted for 
</p>
<p>purposes of taxation, production, and reproduction. It was cooperative and laboring. 
</p>
<p>The collective power of the many, rather than the skilled labor of the one produced 
</p>
<p>  the figure of the pirate</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>372
</p>
<p>its most forceful energy. It moved burdens, shifted earth, and transformed the land-
</p>
<p>scape. It was motley, both dressed in rags and multiethnic in appearance. Like Cali-
</p>
<p>ban, it originated in Europe, Africa, and America. It included clowns, or cloons (i.e., 
</p>
<p>country people). It was without genealogical unity. It was vulgar. It spoke its own 
</p>
<p>speech, with a distinctive pronunciation, lexicon, and grammar made up of slang, 
</p>
<p>cant, jargon, and pidgin&mdash;talk from work, the street, the prison, the gang, and the 
</p>
<p>dock. It was planetary, in its origins, its motions, and its consciousness. Finally, the 
</p>
<p>proletariat was self-active, creative; it was&mdash;and is&mdash;alive; it is onamove.28
</p>
<p> It is in the struggles of these multitudes that Linebaugh and Rediker see the 
</p>
<p>hidden history of revolutionary ideas of freedom, entitlement, dignity, and every-
</p>
<p>thing else claimed in the name of rights and citizenship. The multitude was limited 
</p>
<p>neither by the narrow allegiances of ethnicity nor by the vulgar claims of nation-
</p>
<p>hood, and yet ironically, the moment of the formal institutionalization of a number 
</p>
<p>of these rights was also the moment that resulted in the exclusion of the very class 
</p>
<p>that had suffered to gain them.
</p>
<p> Linebaugh and Rediker say that &ldquo;the new revolts created breakthroughs in 
</p>
<p>human praxis: the Rights of Mankind, the strike, the higher-law doctrine, that 
</p>
<p>would eventually help to abolish impressments and plantation slavery. They 
</p>
<p>helped more immediately to produce the American Revolution, which ended in 
</p>
<p>reaction as the Founding Fathers used race, nation, and citizenship to discipline, 
</p>
<p>divide, and exclude the very sailors and slaves who had initiated and propelled the 
</p>
<p>revolutionary movement.&rdquo;29
</p>
<p> There is perhaps a lesson to be learned here for those of us interested in look-
</p>
<p>ing at the linkages between the multitudinous experience of living through the 
</p>
<p>consolidation of intellectual property. Intellectual property is also created through 
</p>
<p>transnational networks of new forms of capital and labor, made in virtual vessels 
</p>
<p>that pass each other in the global night on the high seas of data. The tall ships 
</p>
<p>of our times fly many flags of convenience. They are the software sweatshops, 
</p>
<p>the media networks, the vast armadas of the culture industries and the lifestyle 
</p>
<p>factories. They produce high-value primary commodities, stars, stories, sagas, 
</p>
<p>software, idols, lifestyles, and other ways of ordering meaning in an increasingly 
</p>
<p>chaotic world. Typically, even though they sell the fantasies of place and identity 
</p>
<p>in an increasingly enmeshed world, they are produced in a global everywhere and 
</p>
<p>delivered through electronic pipelines everywhere, when necessary, more or less 
</p>
<p>instantaneously, through telecommunication networks.
</p>
<p> Their ubiquity and their global reach are also hallmarks of their greatest vul-
</p>
<p>nerability, for like their precursors, the tall ships of the new economy are freighted 
</p>
<p>with cargo that is just as vulnerable to attacks of piracy. The new electronic pirates 
</p>
<p>liang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>373
</p>
<p>are located in the interstices of the global culture economy, which are the nodes 
</p>
<p>that make the network viable in the first place. We cannot imagine a global media 
</p>
<p>industry without the technology that made possible the phenomenon known as 
</p>
<p>peer-to-peer networking on intranets, but it is precisely the same technology on 
</p>
<p>the Internet that renders any attempt to police the distribution channels of media 
</p>
<p>content in the interests of proprietary agencies almost impossible. Just as the 
</p>
<p>piracy of the past disturbed the equilibrium composed of slavery, indentured labor, 
</p>
<p>the expropriation of the commons, the factory system, and penal servitude, the 
</p>
<p>electronic piracy of the present is destined to wreck the culture industry, either by 
</p>
<p>making the economic and social costs of policing content prohibitive or by usher-
</p>
<p>ing in a diversity of new protocols for the use, distribution, and reproduction of 
</p>
<p>cultural and intellectual content that will make the whole enterprise of making 
</p>
<p>vast sums of money out of the nothing of data and culture a difficult business.30
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>Any account of the conflicts over access to knowledge and culture in the con-
</p>
<p>temporary world will have to be aware of the complicated terrain that knowledge 
</p>
<p>occupies. Our examination of the figure of the pirate has been an attempt to chart 
</p>
<p>out the ways in which familiar issues of political economy, inequity, and reform 
</p>
<p>meet with aspirations, desires, and creativity in unlikely encounters in unexpected 
</p>
<p>spaces. As scholars and activists interested in a more just information order, 
</p>
<p>it might well be the case that we need to abandon any simple, one-size-fits-all 
</p>
<p>approach to reforming the public domain. We need instead to be aware of the fact 
</p>
<p>that there can be no accounts of access that are not simultaneously accounts of 
</p>
<p>exclusion, and it is in the awareness of this productive tension that we may be able 
</p>
<p>to engage with a wider set of practices through which people can access knowl-
</p>
<p>edge and culture.

</p>
<p>The A2K movement today appears as a coalition of groups united by opposition 
</p>
<p>to a particular configuration of intellectual property law. These groups have very 
</p>
<p>diverse relationships with more traditional or &ldquo;foundational&rdquo; political ideologies. 
</p>
<p>Some work within them. Some, however, aspire to create their own ideology of A2K 
</p>
<p>in an effort to theorize the conditions of freedom and justice in a networked and 
</p>
<p>informational age. The following &ldquo;virtual roundtable&rdquo; was put together via e-mail 
</p>
<p>to create space for some who wish to explore what a theory of A2K might look like 
</p>
<p>and to provide a sense of the stakes and divergences within the A2K movement. 
</p>
<p>Questionnaires were sent to four individuals who represent different approaches 
</p>
<p>and involvements in the movement. They were free to respond to all five questions 
</p>
<p>or only to some. Their responses were gathered and organized in a single document 
</p>
<p>to facilitate the perception of their various opinions. What follows is not intended 
</p>
<p>to give an exhaustive account of the variety of positions and thoughts that exist 
</p>
<p>in the movement. Instead, it gives a sample of the different perspectives within it.
</p>
<p> The four perspectives represented here are those of Onno Purbo, who is an IT 
</p>
<p>engineer working with Penulis IT Independent in Indonesia; Jo Walsh, who is an 
</p>
<p>open-source programmer in the United Kingdom working with the Open Knowl-
</p>
<p>edge Foundation and with the Free Software Foundation; Anil Gupta, who is the 
</p>
<p>executive vice chair of the National Innovation Foundation in India and the editor 
</p>
<p>of the Honeybee newsletter; and Rick Falkvinge, who is the founder of the Swedish 
</p>
<p>Pirate Party and of the international politicized pirate movement. We asked them 
</p>
<p>to respond to the following questions.
</p>
<p>question 1 Is the A2K movement developing its own form of critique or ideology, 
</p>
<p>or new theories of justice, equality, or freedom? Should it? What role, if any, do 
</p>
<p>the following ideas play in the emergence of an ideology of A2K: theories of the

</p>
<p>generativity of pervasively connected digital networks or peer-to-peer systems, 
</p>
<p>an ethics of sharing and nonrivalry, and the blurring of the distinction between 
</p>
<p>producers and consumers of information?
</p>
<p>question 2 What role do or should ideologies such as the following play in the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement: antiglobalization, anitcapitalism, anticolonialism, libertarianism, 
</p>
<p>classical liberalism, free-market competition, and the public/private opposition?
</p>
<p>question 3 What are the most important historical conditions of the emergence 
</p>
<p>of the A2K mobilization? What shape does or should this mobilization take?
</p>
<p>question 4 Do you think it possible or desirable to include the various compo-
</p>
<p>nents of the A2K movement in a common ethic? If so, what might that ethic be? 
</p>
<p>Where does it come from, and who has had the most influence on its shape?
</p>
<p>question 5 The A2K movement could be viewed as quite creative in its strate-
</p>
<p>gies and modes of collaboration. Can the movement be seen as contributing to the 
</p>
<p>creation of a blueprint for a certain social order, or should it instead be thought of 
</p>
<p>as seeking particular changes in discrete areas (for example, &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo; or other such 
</p>
<p>methods for making a computer program or other work free, or access to medicines)?
</p>
<p>onno purbo
</p>
<p>question 1 From my point of view as a person in a non-English-speaking and 
</p>
<p>developing country Indonesia, our practical barriers to A2K are language (most 
</p>
<p>knowledge is written in English), a high-cost infrastructure, and the education 
</p>
<p>level of our society (less then 10 percent of the society receives a university edu-
</p>
<p>cation and thus it is difficult for many to digest written knowledge). These three 
</p>
<p>together create a major barrier to A2K. It is not so much a question of ideology or 
</p>
<p>theory. What is needed is more practical action and engagement to reduce the bar-
</p>
<p>rier. I personally would like to see more pressure on the Indonesian government 
</p>
<p>to increase literacy and education among the Indonesian people. The government 
</p>
<p>is more interested in getting money and getting investors to come, and they don&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>really care about the people&rsquo;s well-being.
</p>
<p> However, if the A2K movement is to have an ideological basis, perhaps a new 
</p>
<p>ideology of justice and equality will be sufficient. The GNU General Public License 
</p>
<p>[a free, &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo; license for software and other kinds of works for the GNU oper-
</p>
<p>ating system] and the Creative Common licenses created in the West would be rep-
</p>
<p>resentations of such an ideology at work. At this moment in Indonesia, only the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Research and Technology recognizes these licenses. Others are keen 
</p>
<p>for other kinds of license.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> virtual roundtable on a2k politics 379
</p>
<p> But most Indonesians are practical in nature, and they basically don&rsquo;t care 
</p>
<p>about ideology. Indonesians like to benefit themselves, and they&rsquo;ll buy anything 
</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cheap. Unfortunately, this means that Indonesians will buy pirated stuff 
</p>
<p>such as pirated Microsoft CDs and MP3 songs. They don&rsquo;t care about licenses.
</p>
<p> Since 2005, the Indonesian police have been actively sweeping cybercaf&eacute;s 
</p>
<p>and CD shops to find pirated software and MP3s. In 2007&ndash;8, the police brutally 
</p>
<p>raided private offices to find pirated software and MP3s on computers. They even 
</p>
<p>checked laptops at Wi-Fi hotspots and airports. They regularly seize computers 
</p>
<p>with pirated software, and normally, the owner of the computer or laptop does not 
</p>
<p>get it back.
</p>
<p> Such actions create a huge demand for legal software and materials, especially 
</p>
<p>open-source and open-license materials. For example, the Indonesian Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Education is now buying the rights from the authors of Indonesian education 
</p>
<p>books. They publish the soft copy of the e-books, and Indonesians can download 
</p>
<p>the e-books for free. Software mirroring efforts are currently being undertaken 
</p>
<p>by the open-source community at http://opensource.telkomspeedy.com/bse and 
</p>
<p>http://kambing.ui.edu. The open-source community is very active now&mdash;it uses 
</p>
<p>about 10 percent of total local Indonesian bandwidth from several major servers. 
</p>
<p>Several Web sites are devoted to it: http://opensource.telkomspeedy.com, http://
</p>
<p>kambing.ui.edu, and http://www.vlsm.org.
</p>
<p>question 2 To be honest, for a less educated society such as Indonesia, we will 
</p>
<p>be placed on an unequal playing field by free-market competition. I personally 
</p>
<p>would prefer to emphasize anticolonialism and anticapitalism in the A2K process. I 
</p>
<p>would like to see the localization of knowledge (the translation of knowledge into 
</p>
<p>local languages) and focus on the education of society at the local level. . . .
</p>
<p>question 3 Overcoming the sense of inequality is one of the conditions for the 
</p>
<p>emergence of the A2K mobilization. We normally think that people in the West 
</p>
<p>and people in the East are equal. In reality, most Indonesians see Westerners as 
</p>
<p>superior, if not as &ldquo;gods.&rdquo; Unfortunately, this leads most Indonesians to assume 
</p>
<p>that Indonesians are inferior and will not be able to acquire knowledge as well 
</p>
<p>as their Western partners. As a result, most Indonesians tend to be passive and 
</p>
<p>less willing to learn and to access knowledge. In my experience, inviting a per-
</p>
<p>son from Indonesia or from other developing countries to A2K events provides 
</p>
<p>a good example to other Indonesians that someone from a developing country is 
</p>
<p>equal to others in the West. Such examples will motivate others in Indonesia to 
</p>
<p>learn, to gain more knowledge, and feel they are equal. Learning by seeing a real-
</p>
<p>life example is important to motivate others, especially in a developing country  
</p>
<p>such as Indonesia.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>question 4  Hmm . . . to be honest, at least in Indonesia, a concern for ethics is 
</p>
<p>very rare . . . corruption, cheating during the national exam, and bribing are com-
</p>
<p>mon in Indonesia. The bureaucracy filters any movement of information from the 
</p>
<p>outside world to local people. Acknowledgment from the West of those who work 
</p>
<p>hard to empower local people would certainly help to break these unhealthy ethi-
</p>
<p>cal practices in Indonesia.
</p>
<p>question 5 I think that the A2K movement should seek particular changes. One 
</p>
<p>of the most strategic moves would be to support any development and writing of 
</p>
<p>a Creative Commons&ndash;licensed e-book handbook for Indonesian school students in 
</p>
<p>the Indonesian language and hosting the materials on the Web. Such an action 
</p>
<p>would significantly reduce the barrier to knowledge and provide most people with 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge.

</p>
<p>question 1 Regarding the blurring of the distinction between producers and con-
</p>
<p>sumers of information, in fact, the distinction between &ldquo;producer&rdquo; and &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t really there. Information isn&rsquo;t consumed, just passed around (or not). Some 
</p>
<p>have the power to withhold and direct knowledge, others don&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p> Regarding the role of ideology, one can learn more from the theory of &ldquo;net-
</p>
<p>work effects&rdquo; than the broader (and vaguer) theory of &ldquo;generativity.&rdquo; As a network  
</p>
<p>grows and the benefit in belonging to it increases, the costs (not necessarily mon-
</p>
<p>etary) of not participating also increase. So a &ldquo;network effect&rdquo; leads selfish actors 
</p>
<p>to behave generously for merely economic reasons. Competitors find they profit 
</p>
<p>most from transporting things among themselves on a free or not-for-profit col-
</p>
<p>lective basis. Big banks don&rsquo;t charge for transactions between ATM networks; big 
</p>
<p>Internet service providers don&rsquo;t charge each other to exchange data at the Tier 1 
</p>
<p>level. These are pragmatic business decisions, not ideological ones. A2K should be 
</p>
<p>seen in the same way to gain serious momentum.
</p>
<p>question 2 I don&rsquo;t see a place for being anti anything or much to be gained 
</p>
<p>from a dialectical approach. When I got interested in A2K, I held a perspective of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;information anarchy,&rdquo; yet ended up collaborating with a conservative Cambridge 
</p>
<p>economist.
</p>
<p>question 3 An important historical condition for the emergence of the A2K 
</p>
<p>movement is &ldquo;the university in ruins.&rdquo;1 Academic institutions lose their status as 
</p>
<p>a repository of knowledge and of wisdom. Increasingly, their work is subservient 
</p>
<p>to trends in industry and politics. Young academics chafe against the restraints, 
</p>
<p>purbo and walsh</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>381
</p>
<p>connect with pioneers such as Peter Murray-Rust, and start to effect a culture 
</p>
<p>change&mdash;which their institutions need in order to evolve and to regain credibility. 
</p>
<p>So some of the most developed &ldquo;open data&rdquo; work is in academic science as it meets 
</p>
<p>the commercial sphere. &ldquo;Network effect data merging&rdquo; is a phrase coined by Dan 
</p>
<p>Brickley. It pretty well sums up the technosocial conditions that are enabling more 
</p>
<p>open data. But as the network has spread, our ability to mobilize ourselves in real-
</p>
<p>world ways seems to be stalling.
</p>
<p>question 4 One can see a &ldquo;hacker ethic&rdquo; of free software development as a 
</p>
<p>model for open knowledge development. Common ground for open access in dif-
</p>
<p>ferent domains has been expressed by &ldquo;definitions&rdquo; explicitly modeled on their 
</p>
<p>open-source/free-software counterparts&mdash;the Open Knowledge Definition, and 
</p>
<p>the Definition of Free Cultural Works.2
</p>
<p> These definitions propose a very pragmatic ethic. Attempts to define &ldquo;ethical 
</p>
<p>terms of use&rdquo; don&rsquo;t have the same traction or reusability&mdash;there are so many dif-
</p>
<p>ferent reasons why people produce open knowledge. It is important to remember 
</p>
<p>that the hacker ethic is primarily one of &ldquo;enlightened self-interest&rdquo;; the collective 
</p>
<p>benefit of open-source software is a side effect of one&rsquo;s own benefit. &ldquo;Open-source 
</p>
<p>Antipiracy ad, published in the 1980s by 
</p>
<p>the Federation Against Software Theft/
</p>
<p>Investors in Software&rdquo; (www.fastiis.org).

<p>382
</p>
<p>values&rdquo; are often oversold in theorization. There&rsquo;s a continuum of &ldquo;open data, open 
</p>
<p>standards, open source&rdquo; reinforcing one another, and most A2K activists I have 
</p>
<p>met are involved in at least two of these efforts.
</p>
<p>question 5 This text accompanied the World Summit on Free Information Infra-
</p>
<p>structures in 2005, an event bringing together free networks, science, and civic 
</p>
<p>data, free maps, open money, and open hardware: &ldquo;Every kind of research effort 
</p>
<p>can be re-oriented, from protectionist bubbles formed by the pressure to Be First, 
</p>
<p>towards a space into which we can all arrive together, by working on the things 
</p>
<p>that we enjoy most, having the means to contribute to enhancing the things that 
</p>
<p>we like, and getting together to talk about it.&rdquo; The most interesting possibilities 
</p>
<p>were in the intersections and the gaps between the different topics. In viewing 
</p>
<p>subjects as &ldquo;discrete,&rdquo; we cut off simplifying connections. We see more in common 
</p>
<p>the more we view at once.

</p>
<p>question 1  The blurring of the distinction between the producer and the con-
</p>
<p>sumer of information and knowledge is one of the most important trends in the 
</p>
<p>emergence of an ideology of A2K. We need to pay attention to an ethics of shar-
</p>
<p>ing, and the nonrival consumption of innovative ideas and technologies has led 
</p>
<p>us to develop the concept of a technology of the commons. There should be no 
</p>
<p>restrictions on copying or improvisation in people-to-people exchanges, but peo-
</p>
<p>ple-to-firm exchanges must be governed by licensing protocols. The Honeybee 
</p>
<p>Network, for example,3 is a social movement created to recognize, respect, and 
</p>
<p>reward creativity, innovation, and traditional knowledge in local communities 
</p>
<p>and individuals and to link these people, who are rich with creative knowledge, 
</p>
<p>though economically poor, with each other and with formal science and techni-
</p>
<p>cal institutions in order to help them develop socially and economically produc-
</p>
<p>tive businesses. It is essentially a knowledge-based approach to the alleviation of 
</p>
<p>poverty and the conservation of the environment. The underlying concept of the 
</p>
<p>poor as provider is contrary to the vision that treats them only as consumers. Not 
</p>
<p>all disadvantaged people are creative or innovative so as to be able to solve their 
</p>
<p>problems on their own, optimally or even suboptimally. But some indeed are very 
</p>
<p>creative. And for many of them, innovation is imperative.
</p>
<p>question 2  I think the major roles in A2K ideology should be played by the con-
</p>
<p>cept of the commons and support for institutions of sharing and caring, by support 
</p>
<p>for the means of reducing transaction costs for knowledge-rich, economically poor 
</p>
<p>people, and by emphasis on the possibilities of overcoming the asymmetry in the 
</p>
<p>walsh and gupta</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>383
</p>
<p>flow of information and knowledge between developed and less developed social 
</p>
<p>and regional groups.
</p>
<p>question 3 The philosophy of the Honeybee Network indicates one direction 
</p>
<p>that A2K mobilization should take. Support for the Creative Commons movement 
</p>
<p>is another. The use of shared patents is still another. I think the historical exploi-
</p>
<p>tation of traditional knowledge has contributed to a considerable concern in the 
</p>
<p>WTO as well as WIPO about the ethics of such a situation.
</p>
<p>question 4 I think, that yes, there is a common ethic: Those who share most, 
</p>
<p>most liberally, and without often asking anything in return have got to contribute 
</p>
<p>the most&mdash;that is the local communities and grassroots innovators and those who 
</p>
<p>possess traditional knowledge.
</p>
<p>question 5 A2K should both promote the creation of a blueprint for a new social 
</p>
<p>order and seek particular changes. At least, it can do both if there is collaborative 
</p>
<p>research and discussion among contending thinkers. This is not happening enough 
</p>
<p>as yet.
</p>
<p>rick falkvinge
</p>
<p>question 1 After having talked about A2K issues from a political standpoint for 
</p>
<p>several years, we have definitely seen a new ideology emerge. Some summarize it 
</p>
<p>as &ldquo;information ethics,&rdquo; with the key question being &ldquo;What information is public, 
</p>
<p>and what information is private, and how is the line between the two safeguarded?&rdquo;
</p>
<p> The Pirate Party is not only about access to knowledge and culture; it is also 
</p>
<p>about the right to privacy. This can be seen as the direct opposite of access to 
</p>
<p>knowledge: I do not have access to all knowledge about my fellow citizen, nor 
</p>
<p>should I. But these two classes of information are not unrelated; they are inter-
</p>
<p>dependent on one another. The political movement is therefore much more about 
</p>
<p>raising awareness about the border between public and private information.
</p>
<p> As it turns out, any attempt by the government to force information to cross 
</p>
<p>this line&mdash;private to public, or public to private&mdash;requires repressive governmen-
</p>
<p>tal action that infringes on the civil rights of real people to varying degrees. The 
</p>
<p>most obvious example would be how your tax records become public records. 
</p>
<p>Anybody in Sweden (or in the world, for that matter) can easily check how much 
</p>
<p>money I make. This is an example of private information that is forced into the 
</p>
<p>public domain by the government. More egregious examples would include 
</p>
<p>wiretapping my phone calls, confiscating my computers and their content,  
</p>
<p>and so on.
</p>
<p> virtual roundtable on a2k politics</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>384
</p>
<p> An important axiom here is data leakage: It has been proven again and again, 
</p>
<p>and must be assumed so in policy making, that all databases leak. They leak and 
</p>
<p>are converted to uses not originally intended, uses that go against the will of the 
</p>
<p>people concerned. Any information that is to remain private must therefore simply 
</p>
<p>never be collected by an agent of the government.
</p>
<p> The opposite&mdash;public information&mdash;includes any published information that 
</p>
<p>can be digitized, including movies and music, which are usually the target of file 
</p>
<p>sharing. One key question in the file-sharing debate is &ldquo;How many repressive 
</p>
<p>measures are the government prepared to undertake in order to prevent citizens 
</p>
<p>from communicating already-published information to one another in private?&rdquo; If 
</p>
<p>I am sending you a piece of music in an e-mail, that is illegal. If we&rsquo;re in a private 
</p>
<p>video chat, and I drop a copyrighted video clip there, that is illegal. But in order to 
</p>
<p>enforce today&rsquo;s copyright laws, where breaches happen in such private communi-
</p>
<p>cations, those private communications must be monitored&mdash;by law enforcement, 
</p>
<p>and by private interest groups. Copyright has reached a point where it can no lon-
</p>
<p>ger coexist as a concept with private communications.
</p>
<p> Realizing this, private communications is a much more important aspect 
</p>
<p>of society than the commercial monopoly of copyright. Copyright advocates 
</p>
<p>Reminder from the Recording Industry 
</p>
<p>Association of America (Patrick  
</p>
<p>Broderick/ModernHumorist.com).
</p>
<p>falkvinge</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>385
</p>
<p>therefore need to take several steps back: Information that has once been made 
</p>
<p>public, as in a published book or movie, cannot be forced back into being privately 
</p>
<p>controlled without severe repression.
</p>
<p> So everything boils down to awareness of the line between private and public 
</p>
<p>information and that repressive measures are needed in order to force information 
</p>
<p>across this line involuntarily.
</p>
<p> Thus, it is not so much the ethics of sharing or the blurring of line between 
</p>
<p>consumers and producers as it is vital civil liberties that are at stake in this debate. 
</p>
<p>In a yet larger view, for a society to advance culturally and technologically, its 
</p>
<p>inhabitants require the right to privacy and private communications. The copy-
</p>
<p>right lobby threatens that notion.
</p>
<p>question 2 We find that our supporters come from all previous political ideolo-
</p>
<p>gies, evenly distributed. The pirate ideology can be supported fully from at least 
</p>
<p>capitalist, communist/socialist, liberal/libertarian, technological, and civil rights 
</p>
<p>standpoints.
</p>
<p> Once you rephrase copyrights and patents as &ldquo;government-sanctioned pri-
</p>
<p>vate monopolies,&rdquo; you have most of the capitalist, liberal, and socialist people on  
</p>
<p>your side.
</p>
<p> The antiglobalization movement is not very well represented. You see some anti-
</p>
<p>colonialism, because the United States is the driving force behind today&rsquo;s copyright 
</p>
<p>and patent maximalism. The vast majority of key players, however, are seeing this 
</p>
<p>not in the light of what they are against, but in the light of what they want to build.
</p>
<p> I have a vision of a society where all of humanity&rsquo;s knowledge and culture is 
</p>
<p>available 24/7 to anybody with access to the Internet. And you know what? We 
</p>
<p>already have the technology for this! We can do this already! The only thing stand-
</p>
<p>ing in the way of this vision&mdash;which would be a huge leap ahead, much larger 
</p>
<p>than when public libraries arrived a hundred and fifty years ago&mdash;are a couple of 
</p>
<p>anachronistic monopolies.
</p>
<p>question 3 Without a doubt, the emergence of the A2K movement has been a 
</p>
<p>result of the power of everybody to self-publish ideas. What we are seeing now 
</p>
<p>has enormous parallels with the emergence of the printing press, which had similar 
</p>
<p>catalyzing effects on the public discourse.
</p>
<p> Where previously the power to publish ideas was limited to a publishing elite&mdash;
</p>
<p>the newspaper houses&mdash;this power now sits with every citizen. There is no longer 
</p>
<p>any control of ideas, no control of public discourse. This is an immensely positive 
</p>
<p>development for democracy.
</p>
<p>question 4 I don&rsquo;t think it is possible to be normative to the degree that a 
</p>
<p>common A2K ethic is the result. Whereas one might try to describe the various 
</p>
<p> virtual roundtable on a2k politics</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>386
</p>
<p>components in a common umbrella ideology, there will always be people who dis-
</p>
<p>agree with that ideology and state their own motives for pursuing the same goals. 
</p>
<p>This has been very apparent in the pirate movement, where people have vastly 
</p>
<p>different motives for exactly the same goals.
</p>
<p> Yes, it is true that sharing is ethical&mdash;&ldquo;sharing is caring,&rdquo; as we say&mdash;but some 
</p>
<p>people do it because they can, others because it is politically correct, and yet oth-
</p>
<p>ers do it without thinking about it.
</p>
<p> It is equally true that access to knowledge and culture has been a driving force 
</p>
<p>behind the ongoing development of our civilization, but there are plenty of people 
</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t care less.
</p>
<p> So I see the movement more as the power of a focal point of many different 
</p>
<p>viewpoints that converge on the idea of access to knowledge and culture.
</p>
<p>question 5 The mere fact that we have a political party on the topic of A2K, 
</p>
<p>which has been successful beyond everybody&rsquo;s expectations (though yet without 
</p>
<p>representation), shows that these indeed are high-order issues with general impli-
</p>
<p>cations for the shape of society. I have elaborated somewhat on the fundamental 
</p>
<p>questions above. Overall, the changes that are caused by the mass democratization

<p>of the published word go well beyond any discrete area. The events unfolding now

</p>
<p>In recent years, developing countries, NGO activists, multinational corpo-
</p>
<p>rations, and governments increasingly have clashed over intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty policies. But not all intellectual property is alike, and neither are all A2K 
</p>
<p>campaigns. A2K campaigners come from diverse backgrounds and emphasize dif-
</p>
<p>ferent things. Some campaigners champion creative expression and equate cre-
</p>
<p>ativity with freedom. Others focus more on human rights, health, nutrition, and 
</p>
<p>economic development. Still others worry about the disappearance of the sci-
</p>
<p>entific commons and the stifling of innovation. All share a skeptical view of the 
</p>
<p>contemporary intellectual property rights regime and agree that the prolifera-
</p>
<p>tion of intellectual property rights is having a negative effect on many aspects of 
</p>
<p>the human experience. This essay focuses on A2K campaigns for access to books, 
</p>
<p>drugs, and seeds.
</p>
<p> It does so because access to educational materials (including software, books, 
</p>
<p>digital media, and scientific and other scholarly journals), life-saving medicines, 
</p>
<p>and seeds for sustainable and nutritious agriculture is the sine qua non of eco-
</p>
<p>nomic development. First, access to these resources has the potential to spur last-
</p>
<p>ing development and to build capacity for innovation. Yet the strong trend toward 
</p>
<p>transforming these into private commodities for sale at premium prices by making 
</p>
<p>them subject to higher levels of intellectual property protection has made them 
</p>
<p>less available to those who need them most. Second, increasing economic con-
</p>
<p>centration over the past several decades characterizes each of these sectors. Fos-
</p>
<p>tered by relaxed antitrust enforcement and expanded intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>in the life sciences and academic publishing industries, economic concentration 
</p>
<p>has increased these industries&rsquo; political power in U.S. trade policy. This has led 
</p>
<p>to an expansion of intellectual property rights multilaterally, regionally, and bilat-
</p>
<p>erally. Third, medicine and agriculture have become increasingly commercialized.

</p>
<p>For example, agricultural research once was a primarily public-sector activ-
</p>
<p>ity; the United States established land-grant universities to develop and give 
</p>
<p>away seeds to farmers. Now private investment in agricultural research has far 
</p>
<p>outpaced declining public-sector investment. As for-profit enterprises, agricul-
</p>
<p>tural firms and brand-name pharmaceutical firms do not focus on the needs of 
</p>
<p>the poor. Private-sector incentives to develop crops for subsistence, smallholder 
</p>
<p>agriculture, and medicines for tropical diseases are lacking. Brand-name phar-
</p>
<p>maceutical firms do not invest in research on tropical diseases that mainly affect 
</p>
<p>the Global South. The needs of a vast majority of the world&rsquo;s population continue  
</p>
<p>to go unmet.
</p>
<p> While NGO activists and developing countries have worked together and 
</p>
<p>achieved notable victories, their potential to provide an economic and political 
</p>
<p>counterweight to the aggressive expansion of intellectual property rights remains 
</p>
<p>unfulfilled. In addition to facing opponents that have far greater resources, until 
</p>
<p>quite recently, the lack of mobilization across issue areas has held the access 
</p>
<p>campaigns back. The global corporations that lobbied for the 1994 World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)  
</p>
<p>represented diverse sectors such as software, pharmaceuticals, and entertainment. 
</p>
<p>They succeeded because these actors set aside their differences and joined forces 
</p>
<p>to achieve common goals.1 Today, however, it appears that the once invincible 
</p>
<p>intellectual property juggernaut is beginning to slow because of sharp divisions 
</p>
<p>between patent-dependent industries and information technology industries, on 
</p>
<p>the one hand, and outside pressures, including the A2K movement, on the other. 
</p>
<p>All of the access campaigns share the goals of rebalancing the scales from private 
</p>
<p>reward to public interest and introducing a norm-setting process that includes 
</p>
<p>multiple stakeholders&mdash;not just property holders.
</p>
<p> This essay presents some of the core issues animating the campaign for access 
</p>
<p>to medicines, the push for access to educational materials, and the various agri-
</p>
<p>cultural campaigns and considers how they might be taken further under the 
</p>
<p>broader A2K banner. The survey is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather aims 
</p>
<p>to give the reader a general sense of compatible elements and similar strategies 
</p>
<p>across campaigns. It also seeks to identify some of the tensions within the cam-
</p>
<p>paigns and the differences between them with an eye to both the obstacles and the 
</p>
<p>opportunities involved in going forward. The essay begins by identifying shared 
</p>
<p>strategies, then examines both the similarities and the differences between the 
</p>
<p>campaigns in terms of the ways that each successfully employed advocacy for the 
</p>
<p>different issues is involved. It concludes with a discussion of the obstacles and 
</p>
<p>opportunities for A2K exemplified by the similarities and differences between 
</p>
<p>these campaigns.</p>

</p>
<p>discursive and institutional strategies:  
reframing issues and shifting forums
</p>
<p>A2K campaigners have employed both discursive strategies and institutional strat-
</p>
<p>egies in the effort to combat the expansion of intellectual property regimes. The 
</p>
<p>discursive strategies that they have employed have sought to reframe the issues, 
</p>
<p>redefining them in ways that will activate political support. As James Boyle sug-
</p>
<p>gests, &ldquo;one must convince people that one&rsquo;s arguments are good, one&rsquo;s institutional 
</p>
<p>innovations necessary, and one&rsquo;s horror stories disturbing.&rdquo;2 In the early 1980s, the 
</p>
<p>TRIPS campaigners reframed intellectual property as a trade issue and thus were 
</p>
<p>able to activate and mobilize new constituencies (exporters of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty&ndash;laden goods and services and trade ministries) and institutions (the office 
</p>
<p>of the U.S. trade representative and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
</p>
<p>GATT). As part of the post-TRIPS backlash, the access-to-medicines campaign rede-
</p>
<p>fined intellectual property as a public-health issue. This, too, effectively activated 
</p>
<p>new constituencies, including developing countries facing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, 
</p>
<p>NGOs such as ACT UP, the Treatment Access Campaign, Health Action Interna-
</p>
<p>tional, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), and the Consumer Project on Technology, 
</p>
<p>generic drug producers in India such as Cipla and Ranbaxy, health ministers, sup-
</p>
<p>portive academics, and legal experts. The public-health frame also made new insti-
</p>
<p>tutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and national health minis-
</p>
<p>tries available as forums for deliberations on intellectual property. Words matter if 
</p>
<p>they increase the political costs of supporting the status quo. In the case of access 
</p>
<p>to medicines, the language of &ldquo;profits before people&rdquo; and &ldquo;patents before patients&rdquo;  
</p>
<p>increased those costs.
</p>
<p> The institutional strategies that campaigners employed on both sides of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property issues, that is, those who wish to expand access and those who 
</p>
<p>wish to ration access, have included strategic forum shifting.3 Governments, pri-
</p>
<p>vate actors, and NGOs can shift forums horizontally across institutions, that is, 
</p>
<p>from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to the World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization (WTO) and from the WHO to the WTO. They can also engage in ver-
</p>
<p>tical forum shifting, as the United States has done with its bilateral and regional 
</p>
<p>free-trade agreements to secure TRIPS-plus protection in developing countries.4 
</p>
<p>According to Lawrence Helfer, there are four main reasons why actors choose to 
</p>
<p>shift forums: to achieve a desired policy goal, to relieve political pressure for new 
</p>
<p>laws by offloading an issue to another forum, to generate feasible alternatives or 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;counter-regime norms,&rdquo; and to integrate those norms into institutions such as the 
</p>
<p>WTO and WIPO. Participants pursue the second, the &ldquo;safety valve&rdquo; strategy, in 
</p>
<p>order to preserve the status quo. Here, participants confine an issue to a forum 
</p>
<p>that is unlikely to effect meaningful change.5</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>394
</p>
<p> Choosing institutions that afford actors better access or those whose philoso-
</p>
<p>phies reflect their own goals can provide opportunities to propose and experiment 
</p>
<p>with policy approaches. Forum shifting can provide governments with a safe space 
</p>
<p>in which to exchange information, develop &ldquo;soft law&rdquo; (quasi-legal instruments that 
</p>
<p>do not have legally binding force), and craft viable policy alternatives that address 
</p>
<p>their concerns.6 Soft-law forums such as the WHO and the Convention on Bio-
</p>
<p>logical Diversity have become significant incubators of alternative approaches to 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protection.
</p>
<p> This strategy also can generate competing discourses that can change the way 
</p>
<p>parties read TRIPS and are willing to apply it.7 Furthermore, these competing 
</p>
<p>discourses can challenge various domestic political bargains, integrate a broader 
</p>
<p>range of viewpoints and parties into the issues, and raise the political costs of 
</p>
<p>defending the status quo. The campaigns for access to medicines, to books (educa-
</p>
<p>tional material, digital media), and to seeds (farmer&rsquo;s rights, food security, access to 
</p>
<p>agricultural biotechnology, and the defense of traditional knowledge and biodiver-
</p>
<p>sity) employed both discursive and institutional strategies. Highlighting these two 
</p>
<p>strategies helps to illuminate the various strategic choices and outcomes that dif-
</p>
<p>ferentiate the campaigns for access to medicines, educational materials, and seeds.
</p>
<p>access to medicines
</p>
<p>Initial American concern about access to medicines focused on high prices. In Octo-
</p>
<p>ber 1995, U.S. consumer advocate Ralph Nader and his colleague James Love wrote 
</p>
<p>to then U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor suggesting that U.S. trade policy 
</p>
<p>had been too narrowly focused on protecting the interests of the Pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>Research and Manufacturers of America abroad. They pointed out that significant 
</p>
<p>amounts of taxpayer money had underwritten drug development, yet the drugs 
</p>
<p>thus developed had become the exclusive and very lucrative property of private 
</p>
<p>firms. They began an Internet newsletter, Pharm-Policy, that became an important 
</p>
<p>tool for mobilizing interest in drug-pricing and patent policy. These initial moves 
</p>
<p>set the stage for advocates for access to medicines to insert the issue into debates 
</p>
<p>over trade policy into international forums.
</p>
<p> In achieving this success, the discursive strategy that these advocates employed 
</p>
<p>was to identify the links between intellectual property and public health. The insti-
</p>
<p>tutional strategy that they employed was to propose an alternative in a venue more 
</p>
<p>congenial to the issue of access to medicines than the WTO&mdash;notably, the WHO.8
</p>
<p> In October 1996, Health Action International (HAI) organized an NGO meet-
</p>
<p>ing in Bielefeld, Germany, on health care and TRIPS in which Ellen &lsquo;t Hoen (then 
</p>
<p>of HAI) and James Love of the Consumer Project on Technology (CPTech, now 
</p>
<p>sell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>395
</p>
<p>Knowledge Ecology International) participated. HAI and CPTech became active in 
</p>
<p>negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, criticizing TRIPS-plus 
</p>
<p>provisions. This nascent campaign also began working on the World Health Orga-
</p>
<p>nization&rsquo;s Revised Drug Strategy in preparation for the World Health Assembly in 
</p>
<p>January 1998.9 In this way, the campaign&rsquo;s discursive framing of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty issues in terms of public health also helped to activate new institutional allies 
</p>
<p>for the cause.
</p>
<p> As &lsquo;t Hoen notes regarding the reframing strategy that the access-to-medicines  
</p>
<p>campaign employed, &ldquo;The public-health advocates coordinated by Health Action 
</p>
<p>International first raised concerns about the consequences of globalization and 
</p>
<p>international trade agreements for drug access during the 1996 World Health 
</p>
<p>Assembly. They sought to get the WHO to intervene in intellectual property issues 
</p>
<p>because it became apparent that the GATT negotiators had drawn up the rules 
</p>
<p>without any consideration for health issues.&rdquo;10
</p>
<p> As &lsquo;t Hoen also notes here, they successfully shifted the debate on the issue 
</p>
<p>of access to medicines from a forum dedicated to world trade issues, the WTO, 
</p>
<p>to a forum friendlier to their argument. When they did, the WHO&rsquo;s Executive 
</p>
<p>Board approved the recommended Revised Drug Strategy, endorsing compulsory 
</p>
<p>licensing and parallel importing and underscoring the priority of health concerns 
</p>
<p>over commercial interests. The U.S. trade representative and the Pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>Research and Manufacturers of America were upset because the WHO Revised 
</p>
<p>Drug Strategy, meant to offer guidance to developing countries, endorsed the same 
</p>
<p>practices against which they were vehemently fighting via trade policy in the 
</p>
<p>WTO. Thanks to this forum shift, the WHO became an important incubator of an 
</p>
<p>alternative approach to access to medicines.
</p>
<p> Campaigners supplemented institutional strategies with public demonstrations 
</p>
<p>that further bolstered their efforts. Another big push in the access-to-medicines 
</p>
<p>campaign came in reaction to very aggressive U.S. efforts to support and defend 
</p>
<p>the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America&rsquo;s interests in countries 
</p>
<p>in the grip of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In 1998, the United States applied extensive 
</p>
<p>trade pressure on Thailand and South Africa, two countries that were trying to 
</p>
<p>use TRIPS flexibilities to provide affordable HIV/AIDS drugs. The United States 
</p>
<p>threatened these countries with trade sanctions. The U.S. trade representative also 
</p>
<p>supported the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America&rsquo;s lawsuit 
</p>
<p>against South Africa to try to get South Africa to repeal its 1997 law incorporating 
</p>
<p>TRIPS flexibilities. In the United States, the advocacy group ACT UP visibly and 
</p>
<p>vocally disrupted Al Gore&rsquo;s presidential campaign launch in the summer of 1999 
</p>
<p>in an effort to get the Clinton administration to back off, and within a week, the 
</p>
<p>Clinton administration reversed two years&rsquo; worth of objections to South Africa&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>a comparison of a2k movements</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>396
</p>
<p>law. In the face of mounting public criticism and effective activism by groups such 
</p>
<p>as the Treatment Access Campaign, MSF, and CPTech, the pharmaceutical firms 
</p>
<p>dropped the lawsuit.
</p>
<p> A second strategy involved exploiting the general disapprobation, even within 
</p>
<p>classical liberal economics, of monopolies and their deleterious effects. The inter-
</p>
<p>national campaign against the South Africa lawsuit gained traction partly because 
</p>
<p>NGOs, activists, and the media recognized the problems that intellectual property 
</p>
<p>monopolies were causing. Publicizing this monopoly issue in reaction to pressure 
</p>
<p>by the United States and by Big Pharma and its South African affiliates was a turn-
</p>
<p>ing point.
</p>
<p> In 1998, there was a dramatic decrease in the costs of producing generic HIV/
</p>
<p>AIDS drugs. Brazil&rsquo;s successful program of providing antiretroviral drugs free to 
</p>
<p>all those with HIV/AIDS had altered the market for bulk fine chemicals. Brazil had 
</p>
<p>purchased $150 to $200 million worth of these chemicals, and in three years, the 
</p>
<p>cost of the chemicals dropped from $10,000 to $750 per kilo. Dr. Yusuf Hamied, 
</p>
<p>CEO of the Indian manufacturer of generic drugs, Cipla, offered to produce the 
</p>
<p>drugs for one dollar a day per dose. This rendered an intractable problem suddenly 
</p>
<p>tractable because the solution was plausibly affordable. Furthermore, it effec-
</p>
<p>tively isolated the impact of intellectual property protection on the affordability 
</p>
<p>of these drugs. The connection between intellectual property and high prices was 
</p>
<p>stark. The high prices looked more like monopoly rents than anything else. Some 
</p>
<p>thus argued that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America val-
</p>
<p>ued patents and profits over patients. The raw emotional context of the HIV/AIDS 
</p>
<p>pandemic vividly animated the urgency behind the political and technical issues 
</p>
<p>around intellectual property, and distrust of monopoly power proved an effective 
</p>
<p>way to mobilize that emotion.
</p>
<p> Aligning the access-to-medicines movement with the obvious interest of 
</p>
<p>developing countries in the issue also increasingly became a major factor in mobi-
</p>
<p>lizing effective support, and a group of African nations pressed for a special TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Council meeting on the issue. Developing countries formed an effective coali-
</p>
<p>tion on TRIPS and public health and aggressively negotiated for the Doha Dec-
</p>
<p>laration on TRIPS and Public Health.11 This was a significant application of the 
</p>
<p>forum-shifting strategy, but this time employed in the opposite direction, using 
</p>
<p>an approach devised and eventually accepted in terms of health-care issues in the 
</p>
<p>WHO to press for changes in trade policy in the WTO.
</p>
<p> Finally, in August 2003, the negotiating parties agreed to amend TRIPS to make 
</p>
<p>it possible for countries without generic production capabilities to import generics 
</p>
<p>manufactured elsewhere. Member countries agreed to waive temporarily Article 
</p>
<p>31(f), which restricts compulsory licensing only to supply one&rsquo;s domestic market, 
</p>
<p>sell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>397
</p>
<p>and to include procedural safeguards to prevent the diversion of cheap medicines 
</p>
<p>to rich-country markets.12 At the Hong Kong WTO ministerial meeting in Decem-
</p>
<p>ber 2005, member states agreed to amend TRIPS permanently. Member states 
</p>
<p>agreed to retain the waiver of 31(f) so that countries could export medicines pro-
</p>
<p>duced under compulsory license.
</p>
<p> However, these successes were not achieved without generating some dis-
</p>
<p>sension within the movement. While some African delegates expressed relief 
</p>
<p>that the amendment resolved some of the uncertainty that the temporary waiver 
</p>
<p>had generated,13 many observers criticized the amendment as being cumbersome 
</p>
<p>and difficult to use.14 Also troubling was the so-called &ldquo;Chairman&rsquo;s Statement&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>that reportedly had been crafted by Karl Rove and Henry McKinnell, then CEO 
</p>
<p>of Pfizer. This underscored campaigners&rsquo; suspicions about the close relationship 
</p>
<p>between the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the U.S. 
</p>
<p>government.15 To the extent that the amendment can increase the availability of 
</p>
<p>generic drugs, this will be a positive outcome, but the jury is still out.
</p>
<p>access to books and educational materials
</p>
<p>The campaign for access to books and educational materials has focused on copy-
</p>
<p>right, software patents, and technological protection measures as barriers to 
</p>
<p>access to books and educational materials, including software and digital media. 
</p>
<p>Ironically, as the Internet and the digital revolution have made so many resources 
</p>
<p>available, they have also engendered a persistent rights holders&rsquo; push to find new 
</p>
<p>ways to ration access and control the dissemination of copyrighted material. Many 
</p>
<p>analysts, educators, librarians, museum curators, and activists have bemoaned the 
</p>
<p>erosion of fair use, the uncompensated use of copyrighted material for noncom-
</p>
<p>mercial purposes.16 This campaign emerged out of three related but distinct move-
</p>
<p>ments: the emergence of the free and open-source software movements and the 
</p>
<p>creation of the GNU General Public License, both of which posed a direct challenge 
</p>
<p>to Microsoft&rsquo;s proprietary model for software; Creative Commons licensing prac-
</p>
<p>tices; and the political battles over the 1996 digital treaties negotiated at WIPO and 
</p>
<p>over the sharp restrictions on the use of copyrighted material in the U.S. Digital 
</p>
<p>Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.
</p>
<p> Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation in 1984 and developed 
</p>
<p>the GNU (&ldquo;GNU Not Unix&rdquo;) General Public License.17 Stallman has been an ardent 
</p>
<p>champion of free software. &ldquo;Free&rdquo; signifies a commitment to four freedoms: free-
</p>
<p>dom to run the program for any purpose, freedom to study how the program works 
</p>
<p>and adapt it to your needs, freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your 
</p>
<p>neighbor, and freedom to improve the program and release your improvements 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>398
</p>
<p>to the public so that the whole community can benefit.18 The GNU General Pub-
</p>
<p>lic License embodies the notion of &ldquo;copyleft,&rdquo; in which one uses copyright law to 
</p>
<p>require users to share.
</p>
<p> The movement for free and open-source software holds promise for develop-
</p>
<p>ment in two ways. First, it provides users with access to source or programming 
</p>
<p>code. Second, access to source code can transform the relationship between the 
</p>
<p>user and the product. Rather than being a passive consumer of proprietary object 
</p>
<p>code, such as is found in Windows, the user becomes an active and potential pro-
</p>
<p>ducer of source code. This stimulates adaptive and innovative possibilities for users 
</p>
<p>to alter and experiment with programs and tailor them to their specific needs.19 It 
</p>
<p>is empowering in a way that proprietary object code is not.
</p>
<p> However, tensions that have divided the movement for access to books and 
</p>
<p>educational materials have led to different policy emphases and different strat-
</p>
<p>egies for advocating them. Lawrence Lessig, a cofounder of Creative Commons 
</p>
<p>licensing, has promoted practices that aim to expand, rather than reduce access. 
</p>
<p>However, in recent years, Richard Stallman has broken ranks with the Creative 
</p>
<p>Commons licensing project on principle. For example, some Creative Commons 
</p>
<p>licenses bar commercial use. By definition, this violates the first of Stallman&rsquo;s four 
</p>
<p>freedoms and thus is not free software.20 As Stallman states, &ldquo;I cannot endorse 
</p>
<p>Creative Commons as a whole, because some of its licenses are unacceptable.&rdquo;21 
</p>
<p>In particular, he unsuccessfully has urged Creative Commons to drop or disassoci-
</p>
<p>ate itself from two licenses, the Sampling Licenses and the Developing Countries 
</p>
<p>Licenses, a.k.a. Recombo and DevNat, because they prohibit noncommercial ver-
</p>
<p>batim copying.22
</p>
<p> However, the vigor of proponents of greater intellectual property protection 
</p>
<p>has produced solidarity between sometimes unlikely allies in opposition to this 
</p>
<p>agenda. In the United States, opposition to the Clinton administration&rsquo;s vision of 
</p>
<p>copyright in the digital age generated a potent domestic political constituency. In 
</p>
<p>the early 1990s, Bruce Lehman, then head of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 
</p>
<p>issued a &ldquo;white paper&rdquo; outlining this vision, which highlighted the economic and 
</p>
<p>competitive potential of the &ldquo;information superhighway.&rdquo; Lehman, like others 
</p>
<p>in the administration, wanted to harness and develop this technology in a way 
</p>
<p>that would strengthen American economic competitiveness. This promising web 
</p>
<p>of communications networks had the potential to make astounding amounts of 
</p>
<p>information available to all sorts of disparate users. Yet Lehman&rsquo;s policy recom-
</p>
<p>mendations included a dramatic expansion of copyright holders&rsquo; rights and a sharp 
</p>
<p>contraction of users&rsquo; rights. Lehman argued that without giving content provid-
</p>
<p>ers expansive rights, they would refuse to make their content available, and the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;highway&rdquo; would be empty.23 Particularly pernicious aspects of the recommended

<p>399
</p>
<p>policy included provisions to restrict the scope of fair use, to prohibit the produc-
</p>
<p>tion or distribution of any devices or services designed to circumvent technologi-
</p>
<p>cal protection measures, and to prohibit circumvention of such measures.
</p>
<p> Opponents of this policy mobilized against it by building a coalition of the 
</p>
<p>many diverse stakeholders who would be adversely affected by it. Alarmed law 
</p>
<p>professors and librarians, led by Peter Jaszi of American University and Adam 
</p>
<p>Eisgrau of the American Library Association, united in a commitment to preserve 
</p>
<p>fair use. Jaszi and Eisgrau then brought together multiple stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>library organizations, on-line service providers, phone companies, and civil rights 
</p>
<p>and consumer-protection organizations, including CPTech.24 They called them-
</p>
<p>selves the Digital Futures Coalition (DFC) and received significant support from 
</p>
<p>the Home Recording Rights Coalition and Sun Microsystems. The DFC and such 
</p>
<p>diverse allies as Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Electronic 
</p>
<p>Privacy Information Center, and the National Education Association successfully 
</p>
<p>stalled rapid passage of the white paper&rsquo;s version of copyright law.
</p>
<p> Facing domestic legislative deadlock, in 1996, Bruce Lehman pursued his pre-
</p>
<p>ferred version of copyright&rsquo;s future in WIPO copyright negotiations. Using vertical 
</p>
<p>forum shifting, he hoped that international acceptance of the U.S. vision would 
</p>
<p>facilitate domestic implementation of these rules. The coalition of opponents who 
</p>
<p>had mobilized domestically likewise shifted their attention to the WIPO proceed-
</p>
<p>ings. Executives from Sun Microsystems and Netscape and lobbyists from the 
</p>
<p>various mobilized NGOs worked to highlight concerns over this high-protectionist 
</p>
<p>agenda and participated informally as observers and lobbyists in the negotiations. 
</p>
<p>Their core focus in terms of discursive reframing was on the principle of fair use. 
</p>
<p>None of the original U.S.-sponsored digital proposals passed, and the proposed 
</p>
<p>database treaty did not emerge at all.25
</p>
<p> Yet coalition building and the strategies of discursive reframing and forum 
</p>
<p>shifting have not been an unqualified success for the campaign for access to books 
</p>
<p>and educational materials. Although these strategies defeated Lehman&rsquo;s attempt to 
</p>
<p>prevail by shifting forums to WIPO, the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 
</p>
<p>1998 incorporated even more expansive protections for copyright holders, narrower 
</p>
<p>exceptions to copyright, and anticircumvention provisions. As Jessica Litman 
</p>
<p>documents, a complex combination of negotiating fatigue, Senate and House com-
</p>
<p>mittee rivalries, convoluted concessions, intense lobbying, and a Christmas-tree 
</p>
<p>approach (each party hanging its own desired policy ornament), led to the act&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>ultimate passage.26 As she states, &ldquo;when the groups involved in the DFC [the Digi-
</p>
<p>tal Futures Coalition] agreed to withdraw their opposition to the DMCA in return 
</p>
<p>for modest concessions . . . they believed the deal they had made was the best 
</p>
<p>deal they could get. By that point in the process, it probably was.&rdquo;27 The Digital

</p>
<p>Millennium Copyright Act granted copyright holders extensive new rights. It also 
</p>
<p>incorporated preemptive measures that made producing, importing, distributing, 
</p>
<p>or offering any technology or service designed to circumvent access protection or 
</p>
<p>copy protection illegal. In addition, it incorporated nonnegotiable contracts such as 
</p>
<p>click-through end-user license agreements that make the traditional defenses and 
</p>
<p>statutory immunities of copyright law unavailable.28 However, the coalition that 
</p>
<p>tried to fight the Digital Millennium Copyright Act is still active, and many of those 
</p>
<p>who had mobilized against the WIPO copyright treaties of the 1990s were able to 
</p>
<p>defeat the proposed, highly protectionist WIPO Broadcast Treaty in June 2007.29
</p>
<p>food security, farmers&rsquo; rights, and access to 
agricultural biotechnology
</p>
<p>The 1980s seed wars over farmers&rsquo; rights, the campaign for access to agricultural 
</p>
<p>biotechnology, including genetically modified organisms, and the campaigns that 
</p>
<p>emerged around the issues of biodiversity, biopiracy, and traditional knowledge 
</p>
<p>have not offered as coherent an approach and as unified a front as the campaigns 
</p>
<p>for access to medicines and to educational materials.
</p>
<p> Of the two principal strategies that access campaigns have shared, discursive 
</p>
<p>reframing and forum shifting, discursive reframing has been the most problem-
</p>
<p>atic in this area, because agriculture for development and access to seeds are com-
</p>
<p>plex topics, and some discursive frames are particularly confusing. A term such as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;food security,&rdquo; for example, means different things to different people. To some, 
</p>
<p>it means reliance upon landraces (domesticated animals or plants related to their 
</p>
<p>local natural and cultural environments), local cultivars, organic-farming methods, 
</p>
<p>protection from biopiracy, and the preservation of biodiversity. To others, it means 
</p>
<p>higher yields and pest-resistant, drought-tolerant crops produced via genetic mod-
</p>
<p>ification. Similarly, &ldquo;farmers&rsquo; rights&rdquo; evokes different images for different people. 
</p>
<p>Some think of farmers&rsquo; rights as the right to save seed and the right to resist glo-
</p>
<p>balization, while others think of them as rights to compensation for the appro-
</p>
<p>priation of landraces. This lexical confusion makes it harder for parties to come 
</p>
<p>together and makes it more difficult for discursive strategies to mobilize potential 
</p>
<p>activists. Depending upon who says it, &ldquo;food security&rdquo; can be shorthand for what 
</p>
<p>an opponent of multinational agribusiness advocates or for what advocates for 
</p>
<p>genetically modified organisms such as Monsanto claim as their goal.
</p>
<p> Forum shifting therefore is a more reliable strategy in this area. NGOs and 
</p>
<p>developing-country governments have shifted to forums such as those offered by 
</p>
<p>the Convention on Biodiversity and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization 
</p>
<p>(FAO) to try to achieve outcomes that are more favorable than what they would 
</p>
<p>sell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>401
</p>
<p>expect in forums more oriented toward the support of property rights, such as the 
</p>
<p>WTO and WIPO. The Convention on Biodiversity and the Food and Agriculture 
</p>
<p>Organization have served as incubators for norms that support the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment. While these other forums have less power as norm setters in the global 
</p>
<p>economy, the contest is ongoing.
</p>
<p> Forum shifting proved to be the most effective strategy in the so-called &ldquo;seed 
</p>
<p>wars.&rdquo; In the early 1980s, Cary Fowler, a political activist opposed to the extension 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property rights to life forms, adopted just such a strategy. Accord-
</p>
<p>ing to Fowler, the progressive extension of property rights with no commitment to 
</p>
<p>conserving genetic diversity led activists such as Fowler himself and Pat Mooney to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;develop a strategy and set it to work in a new but potentially friendlier arena.&rdquo;30 
</p>
<p>The 1981 biennial conference of the FAO also marked a shift in the discursive 
</p>
<p>strategy concerning plant genetic resources from patenting plant varieties to the 
</p>
<p>broader connections between patenting, genetic conservation, and development.31 
</p>
<p>Fowler and Mooney had consulted with the Mexican ambassador to the FAO prior 
</p>
<p>to the meeting and had provided him with reports on genetic resources. The ambas-
</p>
<p>sador arrived armed with proposals for the establishment of an international gene 
</p>
<p>bank and an international legal convention for the exchange of genetic resources.32
</p>
<p> In pursuing these strategies, the main concern for Fowler and Mooney was pre-
</p>
<p>venting the one-way flow of germplasm from the genetically rich Global South to 
</p>
<p>the North.33 Developing countries sought to address the inequities arising from 
</p>
<p>a system in which they lacked open access to improved varieties bred by seed 
</p>
<p>companies, especially when developing countries&rsquo; &ldquo;raw&rdquo; germplasm was the base 
</p>
<p>for some of those &ldquo;worked&rdquo; resources.34 And in this, the advocates for the Global 
</p>
<p>South were partially successful. In 1983, negotiators agreed to the International 
</p>
<p>Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources against the adamant opposition of the 
</p>
<p>United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and major seed companies. The non-
</p>
<p>binding undertaking was designed to ensure conservation and unrestricted avail-
</p>
<p>ability and sustainable utilization of plant genetic resources for future generations 
</p>
<p>by providing a flexible benefit and a burden-sharing framework.35 Negotiators also 
</p>
<p>established a new commission on Plant Genetic Resources at the FAO where states 
</p>
<p>could discuss and monitor the nonbinding undertaking.
</p>
<p> Beginning in 1989, the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources 
</p>
<p>also incorporated Pat Mooney&rsquo;s notion of farmers&rsquo; rights &ldquo;to acknowledge the 
</p>
<p>contribution that farmers have made to conserving and developing plant genetic 
</p>
<p>resources.&rdquo;36 The idea was to safeguard the rights of farmers to &ldquo;work with, and 
</p>
<p>live from, farming systems based on diversity, in the face of expanding monocul-
</p>
<p>tures and uniform seeds.&rdquo;37 The 1989 agreement asserted the principle of unre-
</p>
<p>stricted access and common heritage of both raw and worked germplasm. However, 
</p>
<p>a comparison of a2k movements</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>402
</p>
<p>the industrialized countries rejected the principle of open access for worked plant 
</p>
<p>genetic resources.38
</p>
<p> Along with such setbacks, tensions within the farmers&rsquo; rights movement 
</p>
<p>emerged, and with them, differences over goals and the strategies for reach-
</p>
<p>ing them. In the late 1980s, the developing countries became interested in prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights in raw germplasm&mdash;&ldquo;green gold&rdquo;&mdash;as a way to acquire wealth.39 The 
</p>
<p>developing countries began to assert their sovereign rights to the exploitation of 
</p>
<p>their biological resources. Gene-rich countries could deny access to their biolog-
</p>
<p>ical riches and cut deals with companies that wanted to engage in bioprospect-
</p>
<p>ing. Asserting property rights in biological resources has been controversial for 
</p>
<p>both worked and raw varieties. As Jack Kloppenburg has noted, it can be ques-
</p>
<p>tioned &ldquo;whether the whole farmers&rsquo; rights orientation was the proper way to go 
</p>
<p>and whether there simply weren&rsquo;t too many contradictions embedded in trying to 
</p>
<p>use the master&rsquo;s tools to dismantle the master&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;40 These tensions and dif-
</p>
<p>ferences are still palpable today and have been particularly acute in debates over 
</p>
<p>so-called &ldquo;traditional knowledge.&rdquo; Some oppose property rights per se, whereas 
</p>
<p>others advocate property rights and compensation for collective endeavors as a 
</p>
<p>matter of social justice and to prevent biopiracy. The prospect of bestowing more 
</p>
<p>property rights is anathema to many A2K campaigners, who bemoan a world with 
</p>
<p>too many property rights.
</p>
<p> In line with this newfound interest in &ldquo;green gold,&rdquo; the 1991 annex to the 1983 
</p>
<p>FAO undertaking incorporated the principle of states&rsquo; sovereignty over their plant 
</p>
<p>genetic resources. Critics have argued that the 2001 FAO Treaty that came into 
</p>
<p>force in 2004 is a bonanza for plant breeders and a disaster for farmers&rsquo; rights. 
</p>
<p>On the plus side, the FAO Treaty recognizes that access itself is the main benefit 
</p>
<p>to be shared, yet it clearly enshrines the notion of property rights over genetic 
</p>
<p>resources. In the negotiations, developed countries resisted any measures that 
</p>
<p>would prevent their patenting of genetic resources, whereas developing countries 
</p>
<p>wanted to limit the scope of the treaty to protect any business opportunities that 
</p>
<p>might result from providing individual genes on the global market.41
</p>
<p> As in the situation we have just examined, in dealing with issues of agricul-
</p>
<p>tural biotechnology, including the problem of genetically modified organisms, dis-
</p>
<p>cursive reframing proved to be a difficult strategy for A2K to employ effectively. 
</p>
<p>In this area, opponents and supporters of the development and spread of geneti-
</p>
<p>cally modified organisms have employed three different discursive frames. Oppo-
</p>
<p>nents maintain that genetically modified organisms are a curse for rich and poor 
</p>
<p>alike. They argue that they damage ecosystems and reduce biodiversity. Wind-
</p>
<p>borne seeds can pollute land used for natural crops. The technology also promotes 
</p>
<p>monocropping and encourages the large-scale farming of cash crops for export in 
</p>
<p>sell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>403
</p>
<p>lieu of growing nutritious staple crops for local consumption. Activists opposed 
</p>
<p>to the development and spread of genetically modified organisms, such as Green-
</p>
<p>peace and Oxfam, support organic farming, low-input-oriented farming, the use of 
</p>
<p>landraces, on-farm saved seeds, and biological insecticides.42 Others, especially in 
</p>
<p>Europe, highlight the potential health risks of using genetically modified organ-
</p>
<p>isms. Still other arguments focus on the dangers of adopting genetic modification 
</p>
<p>technologies as ensnaring poor farmers in inextricable webs of dependency on 
</p>
<p>multinational corporations for expensive inputs. Indian activist Vandana Shiva has 
</p>
<p>dramatized this antiglobalization position with her accounts of farmer suicides in 
</p>
<p>Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.43 On political-economy grounds, many African 
</p>
<p>countries are appreciably wary of pollution of their export crops by genetically 
</p>
<p>modified organisms. Those countries exporting to Europe would lose those mar-
</p>
<p>kets because Europe does not accept genetically modified agricultural products.44
</p>
<p> On the other hand, proponents see genetically modified organisms as a bless-
</p>
<p>ing. Agrifood corporations promote genetic modification as a technology that can 
</p>
<p>increase yields and productivity and solve the problem of hunger. To the extent 
</p>
<p>that genetically modified organisms increase food production for smallholder 
</p>
<p>subsistence farmers, create income opportunities for poor farmers, increase the 
</p>
<p>demand for labor, and lower staple food prices, they could help alleviate poverty 
</p>
<p>and malnutrition.45 Genetically modified organisms such as Bt cotton (cotton mod-
</p>
<p>ified with the insecticidal genes found in the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis) can 
</p>
<p>render plants toxic to prominent pests, reduce crop losses, and reduce the need for 
</p>
<p>toxic pesticides. They can also contribute to a country&rsquo;s competitiveness in glob-
</p>
<p>ally integrated markets in agricultural products.46
</p>
<p> A third discursive frame valorizes the use of genetically modified organisms 
</p>
<p>as the &ldquo;farmers&rsquo; choice.&rdquo;47 Based on the marketing and adoption of illegal Bt cot-
</p>
<p>ton seeds in Gujarat, India, proponents recast the debate over the use of geneti-
</p>
<p>cally modified organisms by emphasizing that when given the choice, farmers have 
</p>
<p>embraced the technology. They have claimed that campaigns against the use of 
</p>
<p>genetically modified organisms such as Shiva&rsquo;s were out of touch with the actual 
</p>
<p>farmers whom they purported to represent. When Monsanto sought to pressure 
</p>
<p>the government of Gujarat to burn the illegal plantations, farmers who had planted 
</p>
<p>the illegal Bt seeds protested so vehemently that the government backed off.48 
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;farmers&rsquo; choice&rdquo; rationale depicts farmers not as victims of globalization, but 
</p>
<p>rather &ldquo;as decision makers and voters for the technology.&rdquo;49 The increasing use of 
</p>
<p>genetically modified organisms on a grand scale by China, Argentina, and Brazil 
</p>
<p>is said to underscore this element of choice.50 China is moving full-speed ahead 
</p>
<p>in public-sector agricultural biotechnology, and one can hardly depict China as a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;victim&rdquo; of Monsanto.51

</p>
<p> Note that these discourses, whether in opposition to the use of genetically 
</p>
<p>modified organisms or in support of their wider dissemination, do not strictly 
</p>
<p>fall along the fault lines between industrialized countries and the Global South 
</p>
<p>or between industry and the public sector. There are reasonable, well-meaning 
</p>
<p>people on all sides of the issue. Because these discursive frames represent sub-
</p>
<p>stantively different positions on the issues that are based on wholly conflicting 
</p>
<p>assumptions, it is difficult to reframe the issue of the use of genetically modified 
</p>
<p>organisms in a coherent and consistent way that illuminates a common ground on 
</p>
<p>which a sufficient number of interested parties can agree. These differences create 
</p>
<p>real problems when considering NGO representation, for example. Who is Vandana 
</p>
<p>Shiva really representing when poor Indian farmers scramble to obtain genetically 
</p>
<p>modified seeds? How can Monsanto insist that genetically modified organisms 
</p>
<p>promote food security when windborne genetically modified seeds may pollute an 
</p>
<p>organic farmer&rsquo;s plot and undermine her way of living? What happens if an Afri-
</p>
<p>can farmer seeking to export her crops to Europe cannot guarantee that they are 
</p>
<p>free of genetic modification?
</p>
<p> The obverse of the issue of the dissemination and increased use of genetically 
</p>
<p>modified organisms is the appropriation of traditional knowledge. The most effec-
</p>
<p>tive forum for the defenders of traditional knowledge from appropriation by pat-
</p>
<p>ents and claims to intellectual property rights that industries in developed coun-
</p>
<p>tries have staked has been the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Convention 
</p>
<p>on Biological Diversity emerged out of the 1992 United Nations Environment Pro-
</p>
<p>gram&rsquo;s Earth Summit. It was a response to growing alarm about species loss, the 
</p>
<p>erosion of genetic diversity, and the accelerating destruction of the rainforests. 
</p>
<p>Unlike TRIPS and WIPO, the Convention on Biological Diversity more explicitly 
</p>
<p>incorporates intellectual property provisions that developing countries favor. In 
</p>
<p>particular, Article 8 (j) recognizes communal or traditional knowledge, challeng-
</p>
<p>ing the TRIPS endorsement of the Western, individualistic conception of knowl-
</p>
<p>edge ownership. The convention stresses that biological resources are sovereign 
</p>
<p>resources of states, whereas TRIPS enforces private property rights over them. The 
</p>
<p>convention seeks to promote the wider application of traditional knowledge with 
</p>
<p>the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge. Many developing 
</p>
<p>countries and NGOs endorse the convention as a way of combating biopiracy.
</p>
<p> Once TRIPS entered into force, the Convention on Biological Diversity offered 
</p>
<p>an opportunity for forum shifting on the issue of protecting traditional knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Developing states, including China and India, and environmental NGOs raised 
</p>
<p>questions about TRIPS&rsquo;s compatibility with the convention&rsquo;s access and benefit-
</p>
<p>sharing rules.52 In 2002, the Conference of the Parties, which is the governing 
</p>
<p>body of the convention, adopted what are known as the Bonn Guidelines, which 
</p>
<p>sell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>405
</p>
<p>stipulated that applicants for intellectual property rights should disclose the origin 
</p>
<p>of any genetic resources or related knowledge relevant to the subject matter. Such 
</p>
<p>disclosures are meant to facilitate monitoring whether applicants have received 
</p>
<p>the prior informed consent of the country of origin and have complied with the 
</p>
<p>country&rsquo;s conditions of access.53
</p>
<p> Despite the difficulty of employing discursive reframing in this area, industry 
</p>
<p>has attempted to reframe these agriculture issues as investment issues. Since the 
</p>
<p>1980s, when it linked intellectual property to trade, it has underscored a strong 
</p>
<p>relationship between high levels of intellectual property protection and foreign 
</p>
<p>investment. Many developing countries seek foreign investment, and industry 
</p>
<p>leverages this vulnerability to press its agenda.54 The life-sciences conglomerates 
</p>
<p>have resisted any attempt to force them to include disclosure of origin in patent 
</p>
<p>applications. They argue that it would inject unacceptable levels of uncertainty 
</p>
<p>into the process of commercializing biotechnology. They argue that this uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty would have a chilling effect on investment in bioprospecting.55
</p>
<p> On the larger question of access to biotechnology, which is where the particular 
</p>
<p>concerns in this set of issues intersect most clearly with each other and with the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement, the strategic burden lies in devising policies and ways of advocat-
</p>
<p>ing them so that intellectual property rights do not prevent the public sector from 
</p>
<p>delivering essential goods. Clearly, actors in the public and nonprofit sector in devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries will bear the lion&rsquo;s share of the task of agricultural innovation for 
</p>
<p>staple crops, and they will need access to biotechnology tools. Current intellectual 
</p>
<p>property obstacles to access include patent thickets (overlapping patents created 
</p>
<p>to frustrate competition), the patenting of research tools, and the sharply reduced 
</p>
<p>realm of open science.56 This has made it more difficult to bring useful plant genetic 
</p>
<p>resources to market and has hampered the efforts of public-sector agronomists.
</p>
<p>back to wipo: the geneva declaration, a2k,  
and the development agenda
</p>
<p>By the late 1990s, intellectual property issues had received extensive critical atten-
</p>
<p>tion in the WTO. In 1999, the United States and the European Union shifted forums 
</p>
<p>to take their unmet concerns to WIPO and to pursue a Substantive Patent Law 
</p>
<p>Treaty.57 Many suspected that WIPO&rsquo;s work on patent harmonization in this treaty 
</p>
<p>aimed to universalize TRIPS-plus standards.
</p>
<p> The developing countries, too, seized opportunities to press their agen-
</p>
<p>das within WIPO, although they had successfully developed these more fully in 
</p>
<p>other forums. They sought to link biodiversity issues to the negotiations on the 
</p>
<p>1999 WIPO Substantive Patent Law Treaty by proposing the incorporation of the

</p>
<p>Convention on Biological Diversity principles of prior informed consent and access 
</p>
<p>and benefit-sharing rules. This reflects the deliberate discursive and institutional 
</p>
<p>strategies facilitating issue migration from a friendlier forum to a tougher one. In 
</p>
<p>September 2004 on the eve of the WIPO General Assembly meeting, James Love of 
</p>
<p>CPTech organized a workshop in Geneva on the future of WIPO. This was a signifi-
</p>
<p>cant moment for the A2K movement, because it united a diverse range of stake-
</p>
<p>holders and brought numerous campaigns and issues under a common umbrella. 
</p>
<p>The workshop resulted in the Geneva Declaration on the Future of WIPO, which a 
</p>
<p>broad range of stakeholders and activists endorsed.
</p>
<p> At the October 2004 WIPO General Assembly, a group of developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries (the Group of Friends for Development) proposed a development agenda for 
</p>
<p>WIPO.58 The United States objected and sought to confine discussions of what 
</p>
<p>they framed as &ldquo;development&rdquo; issues, such as the disclosure of origin and genetic 
</p>
<p>resources to the WIPO Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property 
</p>
<p>and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, presumably a forum 
</p>
<p>where &ldquo;words don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; Yet in June 2005, the &ldquo;Friends of Development,&rdquo; led 
</p>
<p>by Brazil, issued an ultimatum, refusing to discuss the Substantive Patent Law 
</p>
<p>Treaty without forward movement on the WIPO Development Agenda.59 The 
</p>
<p>group succeeded in halting progress on the treaty, holding it hostage to meaning-
</p>
<p>ful, substantive progress on a development agenda.
</p>
<p> In the past several years, WIPO has moved much further on its development 
</p>
<p>agenda, and in 2007, its membership approved numerous items on it. Negotiations 
</p>
<p>are ongoing. This has been remarkable progress, especially in light of the fact that 
</p>
<p>WIPO gets about 90 percent of its operating budget from the Patent Cooperation 
</p>
<p>Treaty, whose users are large global firms that hold extensive intellectual property 
</p>
<p>portfolios. Many of these firms have objected to the development agenda.
</p>
<p> If I were to place the various access campaigns surveyed here on a spectrum 
</p>
<p>from the most successful from an A2K perspective and the most cohesive to least 
</p>
<p>successful and least cohesive, I&rsquo;d say that the access-to-medicines campaign has 
</p>
<p>been the most successful and cohesive. Its issues appear to be the most clear cut. 
</p>
<p>The campaigns for access to educational materials and software, as undertaken, 
</p>
<p>for example, by the Free Software Foundation, the free and open-source soft-
</p>
<p>ware movement, and the Creative Commons campaign, would lie somewhere in 
</p>
<p>the middle. Some profound philosophical and/or pragmatic fissures have evolved 
</p>
<p>in that movement over time. Perhaps this dissention is analogous to the rift in 
</p>
<p>the environmental movement between Earth First and Conservation International 
</p>
<p>over who is the most pure and who is achieving the most. Finally, the campaigns 
</p>
<p>involving issues of agricultural biotechnology are probably the least successful 
</p>
<p>and least cohesive. Yet while the access-to-medicines movement has enjoyed the 
</p>
<p>sell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>407
</p>
<p>most negotiating success, the campaigns for access to &ldquo;books&rdquo; and &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; both 
</p>
<p>have benefited from differing applications of the strategies of discursive reframing 
</p>
<p>and institutional forum-shifting strategies to press their cases, along with other 
</p>
<p>strategies appropriate to their differing situations. Perhaps most astonishing is the 
</p>
<p>extent to which the relatively underresourced A2K campaigners have promoted 
</p>
<p>skepticism about contemporary intellectual property protection.60
</p>
<p>a2k: obstacles and opportunities
</p>
<p>As this survey of these campaigns and the often successful strategies they have 
</p>
<p>employed shows, the A2K movement holds much promise. The conditions that 
</p>
<p>pertained when countries agreed to TRIPS have changed markedly. The original 
</p>
<p>pro-TRIPS coalition of intellectual property&ndash;rich firms is disintegrating. Major 
</p>
<p>information technology firms are questioning patent protection, because so-
</p>
<p>called &ldquo;patent trolls&rdquo; have attacked them in expensive litigation. They no longer 
</p>
<p>support the pharmaceutical and agrichemical patent agenda. In the United States, 
</p>
<p>the Internet technology firms are gaining the upper hand. In the summer of 2007, 
</p>
<p>the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Patent Reform Act, which tightens 
</p>
<p>the criteria for issuing patents. Important cases in the U.S. Supreme Court and the 
</p>
<p>Circuit Court of Appeals in the spring of 2007 reasserted the importance of nov-
</p>
<p>elty and invention in intellectual property rights cases. In the United States, many 
</p>
<p>policy makers now recognize that U.S. intellectual property policy may be imped-
</p>
<p>ing innovation. Congressional Democrats succeeded in altering provisions in U.S. 
</p>
<p>bilateral and regional trade deals to remove many TRIPS-plus provisions. Repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives such as Henry Waxman have protested U.S. policies toward Thailand 
</p>
<p>that impede that country&rsquo;s ability to address its HIV/AIDS crisis. While TRIPS-
</p>
<p>plus provisions remain in earlier trade pacts, it seems unlikely that the U.S. trade 
</p>
<p>representative will be keen to enforce them, given this political shift. At the very 
</p>
<p>least, efforts to do so would smack of blatant hypocrisy. In 2008, Democratic presi-
</p>
<p>dential candidates, responding to American concerns over health care, advocated 
</p>
<p>new approaches to medical innovation, such as prizes (John Edwards), and more 
</p>
<p>vigorous antitrust enforcement to protect consumers from abuses of monopoly 
</p>
<p>power (Barack Obama). Meanwhile, the A2K movement, beginning in 2004 with 
</p>
<p>the WIPO Development Agenda and the Geneva Declaration, has mobilized a far 
</p>
<p>broader coalition in an effort to unite disparate access campaigns.
</p>
<p> Furthermore, many practical alternatives to intellectual property have 
</p>
<p>emerged. Increasing numbers of developing countries are using Linux, an open- 
</p>
<p>source operating system, instead of Microsoft Windows. Computational biomedi-
</p>
<p>cal research holds promise for an open-source approach to medical innovation. If 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>408
</p>
<p>successful, Google&rsquo;s efforts to put five research libraries&rsquo; contents on-line might 
</p>
<p>help to overcome some barriers to access to educational materials, such as high 
</p>
<p>prices, technological protection measures, and abuses of monopoly power in 
</p>
<p>the publishing industry. Creative Commons licenses from the &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo; move-
</p>
<p>ment have made more resources available. Proposals for a global research-and- 
</p>
<p>development treaty for medical research and the WHO&rsquo;s strong endorsement of 
</p>
<p>TRIPS flexibilities offer hope for delivering lifesaving drugs to the poor. Innovative 
</p>
<p>legislation for agriculture that avoids the strictures of the Union for Plant Variety 
</p>
<p>Protection helps to promote sustainable agriculture, biodiversity, and traditional 
</p>
<p>farming practices. The Public Intellectual Property Resource for Agriculture and 
</p>
<p>the African Agricultural Technology Fund enable smallholder farmers and public-
</p>
<p>sector agricultural services to get access to biotechnology tools. Both Duke and 
</p>
<p>Yale Universities are promoting open licensing of core technologies for the Global 
</p>
<p>South. Land-grant universities such as the University of Minnesota are finding 
</p>
<p>ways to make their biotechnology available to the Global South. MIT has provided 
</p>
<p>free on-line educational materials with its OpenCourseWare initiative.61 These are 
</p>
<p>just a few examples of promising approaches to access.
</p>
<p> Perhaps the biggest challenge facing the A2K movement will be to cultivate 
</p>
<p>and maintain unity. Just below the surface of solidarity, campaigners will have to 
</p>
<p>address and manage many cracks and fissures. There are philosophical fissures 
</p>
<p>between the free-software advocates and Creative Commons licensing practices. 
</p>
<p>There is palpable tension between environmentalists supporting biodiversity and 
</p>
<p>advocates for access to genetically modified organisms. Traditional knowledge 
</p>
<p>divides campaigners. Some are antiproperty&mdash;period. Others feel that the intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property system needs to protect traditional knowledge so that its holders and 
</p>
<p>developers may benefit and receive compensation.
</p>
<p> However, just as the pro-TRIPS campaigners of the 1980s and early 1990s man-
</p>
<p>aged to put aside fundamental differences in order to present a united front and 
</p>
<p>achieve their goals, A2K campaigners must do the same. While the cracks and fis-
</p>
<p>sures of the original TRIPS coalition are finally becoming problems for those who 
</p>
<p>advocate increased intellectual property protections, until recently, they had 
</p>
<p>achieved a high standard global intellectual property agreement. While not every-
</p>
<p>one endorses a convergence approach,62 the template of the pro-TRIPS industry 
</p>
<p>coalition is instructive. Advocates for TRIPS&rsquo;s intellectual property protections 
</p>
<p>mounted a united effort, one that required bracketing some deep differences 
</p>
<p>in approach and philosophy, especially between patent and copyright interests. 
</p>
<p>These were privileged advocates with significant resources and enviable access to 
</p>
<p>elite decision-making circles. The A2K movement, on its face, is underresourced 
</p>
<p>and relatively weaker. It needs to recruit powerful industry partners, but also 
</p>
<p>sell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>409
</p>
<p>needs to construct unity across disparate sectors. Just as the environmental move-
</p>
<p>ment became possible only after &ldquo;tree huggers&rdquo; and hunters joined forces, A2K 
</p>
<p>campaigners must discursively frame their preferences and values in such a way 
</p>
<p>as to activate their most eclectic and ardent supporters. Furthermore, the Global 
</p>
<p>South and its allies and advocates must act cohesively in favorable forums if they 
</p>
<p>are to make continued progress in obtaining access to knowledge.
</p>
<p> A2K campaigners already have astonished observers because, without obvious 
</p>
<p>economic or political clout, they have generated notable skepticism and prompted 
</p>
<p>a fresh conversation about contemporary intellectual property rights. A2K cam-
</p>
<p>paigners must find ways to maintain solidarity and to mobilize the broadest public 
</p>
<p>support if they are to succeed in achieving their goals.

<p>approach in discussions of a development agenda at WIPO, recommending that the discus-

</p>
<p>India was one of the last World Trade Organization&ndash;member developing countries 
</p>
<p>to come into compliance with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
</p>
<p>Rights Agreement (the TRIPS Agreement), the WTO&rsquo;s treaty on intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty. With the spread of the global AIDS pandemic, the global outrage at the ineq-
</p>
<p>uity in access to lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment, and the concomitant rise of the 
</p>
<p>access-to-medicines movement, the global landscape had changed quite dramati-
</p>
<p>cally between 1995, when TRIPS came into existence, and 2005, when India finally 
</p>
<p>acceded to its demands.1
</p>
<p> In the interim came the WTO&rsquo;s Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and 
</p>
<p>Public Health.2 That statement recognized that patent protection should not inter-
</p>
<p>fere with a country&rsquo;s sovereign right and responsibility to protect the health of 
</p>
<p>its citizens and that TRIPS included inherent flexibilities that allowed countries to 
</p>
<p>override patents in order to protect public health.
</p>
<p> Also in the interim came the announcement in 2001 by Cipla, an Indian man-
</p>
<p>ufacturer of generic drugs, that it was willing to provide a generic version of a 
</p>
<p>triple-combination AIDS cocktail for a dollar a day, as compared with the (US) 
</p>
<p>$10,000 a year then being charged by the Western multinational pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>companies. And with this drop in price came the drive toward &ldquo;universal access,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>which resulted in an unprecedented global scale-up of AIDS treatment to over 1.3 
</p>
<p>million people living with HIV/AIDS in developing countries by the end of 2005.3
</p>
<p> The world in 2005, then, was a very different one from what existed ten years 
</p>
<p>prior. Indian generic companies had become the key supplier of affordable AIDS and 
</p>
<p>other essential drugs throughout much of the developing world. A host of latent 
</p>
<p>TRIPS flexibilities had been explicitly recognized by the Doha Declaration and had 
</p>
<p>been expounded upon by experts in the field. And the global community of treat-
</p>
<p>ment activists had found their voice, refusing to be ignored or brushed aside.

</p>
<p> These and other factors led India to include several unique features in its TRIPS-
</p>
<p>mandated patent law, features that, if rigorously and exactingly utilized, have the 
</p>
<p>potential to lessen dramatically the likelihood that patent monopolies will place 
</p>
<p>essential medicines out of reach. In addition to focusing on the much-discussed  
</p>
<p>flexibilities with respect to the compulsory licensing of patented medicines (a sub-
</p>
<p>ject on which Indian law frankly still leaves much to be desired), India also turned 
</p>
<p>its attention to the criteria on which patents are granted in the first place.
</p>
<p> These patent criteria, which are markedly more stringent than prevailing stan-
</p>
<p>dards in effect just about anywhere in the world, potentially provide a comple-
</p>
<p>mentary solution that may be able to overcome at least partially the inherent limi-
</p>
<p>tations of relying on the compulsory licensing mechanism alone. By establishing 
</p>
<p>stricter criteria for obtaining a patent, fewer patent monopolies are created, thus 
</p>
<p>creating more space for generic competition to enter the market with lower-cost 
</p>
<p>alternatives. And where there are no patents on an essential drug, there is no need 
</p>
<p>to issue a compulsory license.
</p>
<p> This essay examines some of the unique features of Indian patent law and the 
</p>
<p>experiences of civil society in utilizing them to help ensure that the Indian domes-
</p>
<p>tic industry can continue to provide affordable lifesaving medicines throughout 
</p>
<p>the developing world.
</p>
<p>compulsory licensing: benefits and limitations
</p>
<p>Since Doha, the TRIPS flexibility that has received by far the most attention is the 
</p>
<p>freedom that countries have to issue so-called &ldquo;compulsory licenses&rdquo; on patented 
</p>
<p>drugs. By issuing a compulsory license, a country can override an existing patent 
</p>
<p>(or patents) on a drug. In exchange for &ldquo;adequate remuneration&rdquo; paid to the patent 
</p>
<p>holder, the country is then free to purchase generic versions of the medicine, often 
</p>
<p>at a fraction of the price of the branded version. The Doha Declaration explicitly 
</p>
<p>recognized that countries have the &ldquo;right to grant compulsory licenses&rdquo; and &ldquo;the 
</p>
<p>freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licenses are granted.&rdquo; But the 
</p>
<p>Doha Declaration has a much broader significance than clarifying the rules con-
</p>
<p>cerning compulsory licensing. It serves as both an interpretive guide and a source 
</p>
<p>of obligation on WTO member countries in implementing all aspects of the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement: &ldquo;We agree that the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent 
</p>
<p>Members from taking measures to protect public health. Accordingly, while reiter-
</p>
<p>ating our commitment to the TRIPS Agreement, we affirm that the Agreement can 
</p>
<p>and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Mem-
</p>
<p>bers&rsquo; right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines 
</p>
<p>for all.&rdquo;	As the use of the obligatory &ldquo;should&rdquo; here implies, the Doha Declaration </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>trips flexibilities in india 417
</p>
<p>recognized the positive obligation on member states to ensure that intellectual 
</p>
<p>property protection did not come at the cost of safeguarding public health.
</p>
<p> For many developing countries, compulsory licenses are the most effective and 
</p>
<p>immediate way to lower the prices of patented drugs. One such instance is Thai-
</p>
<p>land. In late 2006 and early 2007, the Thai government issued a series of compul-
</p>
<p>sory licenses on the AIDS drugs efavirenz and lopinavir/ritonavir and on the heart 
</p>
<p>medication clopidogrel. The immediate cost savings were significant.4
</p>
<p> The reaction to the Thai compulsory licenses gives us some insight as to why 
</p>
<p>more countries have not dared come forth to use the compulsory licensing mecha-
</p>
<p>nism. The Thai compulsory licenses were issued in perfect accordance with both 
</p>
<p>Thailand&rsquo;s domestic laws and the TRIPS requirements. The legality of it all not-
</p>
<p>withstanding, the U.S. trade representative promptly placed Thailand on its Special 
</p>
<p>301 Priority Watch List, a list that purports to identify the world&rsquo;s most egregious 
</p>
<p>intellectual property &ldquo;offenders&rdquo; and that places countries at risk of retaliatory 
</p>
<p>trade sanctions from the United States.
</p>
<p> Abbott Laboratories, the owner of the patents on lopinavir/ritonavir, retaliated 
</p>
<p>by withdrawing all of its pending drug-approval applications from Thailand, with 
</p>
<p>the clear implication being that it would refuse to register its new drugs in any 
</p>
<p>country that dared to issue a compulsory license on its patents. And suddenly, in 
</p>
<p>editorial pieces popping up in newspapers all over the world, pundits supporting 
</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry lambasted the actions of Thailand&rsquo;s &ldquo;military dictator-
</p>
<p>ship&rdquo; in &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; the property of Western pharmaceutical companies.
</p>
<p> As the Thailand example shows, issuing a compulsory license often comes with 
</p>
<p>a price. The U.S. trade representative and the pharma lobby have made sure this 
</p>
<p>message is heard, loud and clear. Understandably, not many governments are keen 
</p>
<p>on angering the United States or any of their other rich and powerful Western 
</p>
<p>trading partners. But in those relatively rare instances in which there is the politi-
</p>
<p>cal will within a developing country&rsquo;s government to stand up to these pressures, 
</p>
<p>the benefits from issuing a compulsory license must be tangible and immediate. 
</p>
<p>More often than not, these benefits will be sourced from India. For example, a 
</p>
<p>handful of other countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia, have issued 
</p>
<p>compulsory licenses on essential medicines in recent years. Upon issuing the com-
</p>
<p>pulsory licenses, they all promptly proceeded to import cheaper versions from 
</p>
<p>Indian generic companies, at least until their domestic manufacturing capacity 
</p>
<p>could be developed to make these drugs in-house.
</p>
<p> This fact underscores a few critical issues. The first and most obvious is that 
</p>
<p>the Indian pharmaceutical industry plays a central role in the supply of afford-
</p>
<p>able generic drugs throughout the developing world. The importance of the Indian 
</p>
<p>generic-drug industry is difficult to overstate. According to one study, Indian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>418
</p>
<p>companies supply up to 85 percent of the generic AIDS drugs currently being used 
</p>
<p>in sub-Saharan Africa.5
</p>
<p> The second critical fact is that these countries were able immediately to realize 
</p>
<p>significant cost savings because Indian generic companies had already been manu-
</p>
<p>facturing these drugs in India for years. Because India did not recognize product 
</p>
<p>patent protection on drugs prior to 1995, Indian companies were free to reverse engi-
</p>
<p>neer medicines that were under patent in other countries and sell them at a frac-
</p>
<p>tion of the cost. The result: a thriving generic industry some fifteen thousand enti-
</p>
<p>ties strong, selling drugs at some of the lowest prices in the world. Consequently, 
</p>
<p>once these countries issued compulsory licenses, they had a well-established  
</p>
<p>and competitive market to turn toward in purchasing lower-cost alternatives, 
</p>
<p>rather than having to create such a market from scratch.
</p>
<p> Which brings us to the third and most critical point. Compulsory licenses 
</p>
<p>have been effective in immediately and significantly lowering drug prices largely 
</p>
<p>because there are countries&mdash;such as India&mdash;where these medicines are not pat-
</p>
<p>ented at all. This is the case for at least two reasons. First, successfully reverse 
</p>
<p>engineering a drug simply does not happen overnight. Historically, it has taken 
</p>
<p>anywhere from one to six years after the original drug has been launched for an 
</p>
<p>Indian company to come out with a generic alternative.6 Additionally, the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of just one or two generic competitors has been shown to be ineffective in 
</p>
<p>significantly lowering drug prices. The cost of a drug is inversely proportional to 
</p>
<p>the number of generic competitors on the market, and it has been observed that 
</p>
<p>dramatic price reductions kick in only once the &ldquo;rule of five&rdquo;&mdash;that is, five or more 
</p>
<p>competitors entering the market for a given drug&mdash;has been satisfied.7
</p>
<p> Thus, at least in the area of AIDS drugs, where multinational pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>companies are under intense pressure and where they charge reduced (but still 
</p>
<p>expensive) &ldquo;access prices&rdquo; in developing countries, it is not uncommon for the 
</p>
<p>price of the first generic version of a drug to be similar to or even slightly more 
</p>
<p>expensive than the prices being charged by the originator company (see Table 1). 
</p>
<p> As this table illustrates, there are several generic companies manufacturing the 
</p>
<p>standard &ldquo;first-line&rdquo; AIDS drugs: lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP), stavudine 
</p>
<p>(d4T) and zidovudine (AZT). Correspondingly, the prices for both originator and 
</p>
<p>generics are very low. However, in the case of the newer AIDS drugs such as aba-
</p>
<p>cavir (ABC) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), where there are fewer generic com-
</p>
<p>petitors, the prices remain alarmingly high.
</p>
<p> The point of all of this: From the perspective of a government official faced 
</p>
<p>with the politically risky decision of issuing a compulsory license for an important 
</p>
<p>drug, the most compelling reason in favor of issuing the compulsory license will 
</p>
<p>often be the immediate benefits that accrue from the significant cost savings that 
</p>
<p> park and menghaney</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>419
</p>
<p>can be achieved. But if there is no preexisting source of cheap drugs (such as India) 
</p>
<p>where the drugs are already being manufactured and from whence such immediate 
</p>
<p>cost savings can be realized, the political calculus becomes much murkier.
</p>
<p> Does the government official issue a compulsory license in the hope that one 
</p>
<p>to six years down the line, a generic company will be able to reverse engineer a 
</p>
<p>cheaper version successfully? Does she issue multiple licenses to several generic 
</p>
<p>manufacturers in the hope that competition will eventually drive the prices down? 
</p>
<p>And does she, in the face of these uncertainties, issue the compulsory license(s) 
</p>
<p>anyway, despite the virtual certainty of facing the rather odious forms of political 
</p>
<p>and economic pressure that will be applied by the U.S. trade representative, the 
</p>
<p>pharma lobby, and their cohorts?
</p>
<p> And yet, with India now under a product patent regime and with the major-
</p>
<p>ity of the other developing and least-developed countries having already imple-
</p>
<p>mented the TRIPS Agreement, this is precisely the situation that the world is 
</p>
<p>potentially facing: nearly universal patent protection for pharmaceutical products 
</p>
<p>and no immediate relief available through the issuance of a compulsory license. 
</p>
<p>Thus, despite the Doha Declarations&rsquo;s mandate that countries can and should take 
</p>
<p>measures to promote access to medicines for all, the increasingly global reach of

</p>
<p>product patent protection makes taking such measures more and more unrealistic. 
</p>
<p>Given both the political and economic realities, the use of the compulsory licensing 
</p>
<p>mechanism in a world of universal patent protection has the potential to be inade-
</p>
<p>quate to produce the rapid and dramatic reduction in prices that is often necessary 
</p>
<p>to make essential medicines truly accessible.
</p>
<p> For the large number of developing and least-developed countries that, unlike 
</p>
<p>a handful of developing countries such as India, China, Brazil, South Africa, and 
</p>
<p>Thailand, lack the ability to manufacture generic medicines domestically, the sit-
</p>
<p>uation is even more bleak. This is because the issuance of a compulsory license 
</p>
<p>serves no function if the country is unable to manufacture its own generic drugs 
</p>
<p>or to import drugs from countries that can. The Doha Declaration recognized this 
</p>
<p>and directed the WTO to come up with an &ldquo;expeditious solution&rdquo; to this problem. 
</p>
<p>However, the purported &ldquo;solution&rdquo; that the WTO came up with in August 2003 has 
</p>
<p>proven to be fraught with difficulties,9 and has thus far been used just once, with 
</p>
<p>limited success.10 Given the numerous difficulties with these rules, M&eacute;decins Sans 
</p>
<p>Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) and others have declared the WTO&rsquo;s decision to be &ldquo;unworkable&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>and &ldquo;neither expeditious, nor a solution.&rdquo;11
</p>
<p>patents and the scope of trips flexibilities: a brief inquiry
</p>
<p>As we have seen, in order for compulsory licenses to be most effective in achieving 
</p>
<p>immediate and significant cost savings, there should be a readily available source 
</p>
<p>of cheaper generic alternatives. However, the global reach of patent protection 
</p>
<p>that TRIPS entails threatens the very existence of such readily available alterna-
</p>
<p>tives. With India now under a product patent regime, it is an open question as to 
</p>
<p>whether, for newer drugs that are eventually granted patent protection in India, 
</p>
<p>issuing a compulsory license will result in the immediate and dramatic savings that 
</p>
<p>countries have been able to take advantage of simply by switching to a preexisting 
</p>
<p>Indian generic alternative.
</p>
<p> Fortunately, it is by no means a foregone conclusion that simply because a drug 
</p>
<p>has been patented in the United States or Europe, the same drug will be patented 
</p>
<p>in India. Patent standards often vary from country to country, and what may be 
</p>
<p>deemed to be sufficiently &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;inventive&rdquo; in one country will not necessar-
</p>
<p>ily be deemed to be so in another. Indeed, what may be considered to constitute 
</p>
<p>patentable subject matter, and thus an &ldquo;invention&rdquo; at all, varies quite significantly 
</p>
<p>from country to country.
</p>
<p> Countries may choose to adopt varying levels of protection for any number 
</p>
<p>of reasons. Historically, many countries, shifted from having &ldquo;weak&rdquo; intellectual 
</p>
<p>property regimes to &ldquo;strong&rdquo; ones as their economies evolved from being net users 
</p>
<p> park and menghaney</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>421
</p>
<p>of intellectual property to net producers. This raises several questions. Which came 
</p>
<p>first? Did the stronger levels of protection cause the innovation, or was it the other 
</p>
<p>way around? And is this relationship (if there is one at all) linear, such that more 
</p>
<p>protection always equals more innovation? Also, what sorts of innovation, exactly, 
</p>
<p>are generated by the patent system? There are no definite answers to these ques-
</p>
<p>tions, but there are some clues.
</p>
<p> First, there is very little empirical evidence&mdash;particularly in the pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>context&mdash;to suggest that stronger levels of patent protection result in increased 
</p>
<p>levels of innovative output. With the entry into force of the TRIPS Agreement 
</p>
<p>in 1995, the world witnessed a dramatic strengthening of patent protection on a 
</p>
<p>global scale. However, since 1995, the number of new drugs being released onto the 
</p>
<p>market has, if anything, declined (see Table 2).
</p>
<p> As Table 2 illustrates, after a peak of over fifty new drugs approved by the 
</p>
<p>United States Food and Drug Administration in 1996, the numbers have steadily 
</p>
<p>declined in the era of global patent protection ushered in by the TRIPS Agreement, 
</p>
<p>dipping to fewer than twenty new drugs in 2002. The levels of innovation (as mea-
</p>
<p>sured by new drug approvals) before TRIPS, when many countries did not recog-
</p>
<p>nize product patents on pharmaceuticals, are not appreciably lower than the levels

</p>
<p>of innovation after TRIPS. Thus, as far as the pharmaceutical sector is concerned, 
</p>
<p>there has been no increase in the levels of innovation as a result of stronger levels 
</p>
<p>of patent protection around the world.
</p>
<p> Second, there is also very little evidence to suggest the other extreme: that in 
</p>
<p>the absence of patent protection, no innovation will occur at all. In fact, there are 
</p>
<p>numerous instances where this notion has been shown to be false&mdash;particularly 
</p>
<p>with respect to what are called &ldquo;incremental&rdquo; innovations: advances that simply 
</p>
<p>add on to and improve already existing technologies. Often, the incentives created 
</p>
<p>by the market alone will be sufficient to allow such types of innovation to happen.
</p>
<p> One example of an extremely useful incremental innovation occurring in the 
</p>
<p>absence of patent protection comes from India. In 2001, Indian generic-drug compa-
</p>
<p>nies, without the benefit of a product patent regime, were able to develop a single, 
</p>
<p>three-in-one fixed-dose combination of AIDS medicines that revolutionized AIDS 
</p>
<p>treatment in the developing world. Because three different drugs were combined 
</p>
<p>into one easy-to-swallow pill, treatment regimens were dramatically simplified, 
</p>
<p>patient adherence was improved, and this combination became the weapon of choice 
</p>
<p>in the dramatic global scale-up of AIDS treatment. Market pressures, and not patent 
</p>
<p>protection, were a sufficient incentive to allow this important innovation to occur.
</p>
<p> Ironically, this is also a situation in which patent protection actually proved to 
</p>
<p>be a barrier to further innovation. Because three different companies owned the 
</p>
<p>patents on the three individual drugs, there was little incentive for these compa-
</p>
<p>nies to enter into complicated cross-licensing arrangements in order to produce 
</p>
<p>a single product that was useful in scaling up treatment in the developing world. 
</p>
<p>Indian companies, unhindered by patent protection, were able to take advantage 
</p>
<p>of the situation.
</p>
<p> The ongoing debate about whether patent protection is necessary, and if so, 
</p>
<p>what the &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; level of protection should be has not been confined to devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries struggling to come to grips with its TRIPS obligations. In a recent 
</p>
<p>landmark judgment, the United States Supreme Court recognized that:
</p>
<p> Granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course 
</p>
<p>without real innovation retards progress and may, in the case of patents combin-
</p>
<p>ing previously known elements, deprive prior inventions of their value or utility. . . . 
</p>
<p>When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are 
</p>
<p>a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has 
</p>
<p>good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp. If this 
</p>
<p>leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of 
</p>
<p>ordinary skill and common sense.&rdquo;12
</p>
<p>Implicit in the above quote is the recognition that market pressures will often be 
</p>
<p> park and menghaney</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>423
</p>
<p>sufficient to produce many types of innovations and that providing patent protec-
</p>
<p>tion to such improvements would in fact hamper, not encourage, real innovation.
</p>
<p> Finally, while it is unclear what kinds of additional incentives are created by 
</p>
<p>stronger levels of patent protection, it is fairly clear what kinds of incentives 
</p>
<p>are created by the patent system that exists today in many developed countries. 
</p>
<p>Because the patent system depends upon the pharmaceutical company being able 
</p>
<p>to recoup its research-and-development (as well as marketing) costs by charging 
</p>
<p>high drug prices, the pharmaceutical companies will naturally have an incentive to 
</p>
<p>develop drugs for markets that can afford to pay for these drugs.
</p>
<p> Thus, drug companies will have little incentive to conduct research and devel-
</p>
<p>opment into the special health needs of the Indian market, which accounts for 
</p>
<p>about 1.2 percent of the global pharmaceutical market, or for the African market, 
</p>
<p>which accounts for about 1.1 percent.13 Rather, drug companies focus on the dis-
</p>
<p>eases and conditions that affect the developed world, where consumers are able to 
</p>
<p>afford the high costs that the patent system entails. As a result, the vast majority 
</p>
<p>of the new drugs that are developed are tailored for diseases that predominantly 
</p>
<p>affect the developed world, such as cancer or heart disease, or for nonessential 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo; drugs, such as treatments for erectile dysfunction or obesity. Thus, 
</p>
<p>while there are no fewer than three separate drugs for erectile dysfunction on the 
</p>
<p>market, there are as yet no effective treatments developed for potentially fatal 
</p>
<p>diseases such as kala azar (leishmaniasis, a chronic and potentially fatal disease of 
</p>
<p>the viscera, caused by protozoan parasites) or sleeping sickness.
</p>
<p> As a result of the skewed incentives created by the patent system, the WHO 
</p>
<p>Commission on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Public Health recently con-
</p>
<p>cluded: &ldquo;There is no evidence that the implementation of TRIPS agreement in 
</p>
<p>developing countries will significantly boost R&amp;D in pharmaceuticals on Type II 
</p>
<p>[diseases substantially affecting the developing world] and particularly Type III 
</p>
<p>diseases [those almost exclusively affecting the developing world]. Insufficient 
</p>
<p>market incentives are the decisive factor.&rdquo;14
</p>
<p> As all of these complexities suggest, the debate surrounding patent protection 
</p>
<p>on pharmaceuticals cannot be easily reduced, as some would have it, to a zero-sum 
</p>
<p>game that pits access to medicines on one side against innovation on the other. 
</p>
<p>The two concepts are neither mutually exclusive nor even necessarily inherently 
</p>
<p>hostile to each other. Faced with the myriad complexities of the debate, individual 
</p>
<p>countries can and often do choose to adopt varying standards for what qualifies as 
</p>
<p>a patentable invention within the confines of TRIPS.
</p>
<p> The TRIPS Agreement implicitly recognizes this variance and provides that pat-
</p>
<p>ents granted or revoked in one country are completely independent of patents in 
</p>
<p>other countries.15 As such, TRIPS makes no attempt to define what an &ldquo;invention&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>trips flexibilities in india</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>424
</p>
<p>is, nor does it define the basic criteria for patentability, namely, &ldquo;novelty,&rdquo; being an 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;inventive step,&rdquo; and possessing an &ldquo;industrial application.&rdquo; This leaves countries 
</p>
<p>with a significant degree of space to define these concepts according to their own 
</p>
<p>policy priorities.
</p>
<p> To take just one example, most countries make a general distinction between 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; and &ldquo;inventions&rdquo; and provide patent protection only for the latter. 
</p>
<p>For example, the European Patent Convention, like the patent law of many coun-
</p>
<p>tries, includes a provision that &ldquo;discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical 
</p>
<p>methods&rdquo; are not to be regarded as inventions.16 Thus, for instance, &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>a hitherto unknown element on the periodic table or a new law of nature would 
</p>
<p>not give rise to a patentable claim in most countries, no matter how useful the 
</p>
<p>new element or this new law of nature may be or how much human ingenuity or 
</p>
<p>investment was required to make such a discovery. In practice, however, the dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between &ldquo;invention&rdquo; and &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; is not so clear.
</p>
<p> For instance, U.S. patent law defines an &ldquo;invention&rdquo; as an &ldquo;invention or discov-
</p>
<p>ery&rdquo; and provides that &ldquo;whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>or &ldquo;machine&rdquo; is entitled to a patent.17 Thus, under U.S. law, even if someone dis-
</p>
<p>covers a substance that already exists in nature, it can nevertheless qualify as an 
</p>
<p>invention and be awarded a patent. For instance, the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
</p>
<p>tration recently approved a new drug for type 2 diabetes called exenetide. One of 
</p>
<p>the several patents covering this drug (U.S. 5,424,286) discloses that exenetide was 
</p>
<p>not created in a lab, but discovered in the venomous saliva of the Gila monster, a 
</p>
<p>poisonous lizard found in the deserts of North America. Nevertheless, the patent 
</p>
<p>covers not only the &ldquo;method of treating&rdquo; diabetes by using a compound found in 
</p>
<p>lizard spit, but the naturally occurring compound itself.
</p>
<p> To take another example, despite its broad exclusion of &ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; from pat-
</p>
<p>entability, the European Patent Convention carves out a specific exception to this 
</p>
<p>rule and provides that &ldquo;an element isolated from the human body . . . including the 
</p>
<p>sequence or partial sequence to a gene, may constitute a patentable invention, 
</p>
<p>even if the structure of that element is identical to that of a natural element.&rdquo;18
</p>
<p> But why carve out an exception to the general rule only for elements isolated 
</p>
<p>from the human body? Could not the Europeans just as easily, if they chose, have 
</p>
<p>drafted this provision as exempting any element isolated from the human or liz-
</p>
<p>ard body? Would doing so have done violence to some ideal Platonic form of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;inventionness&rdquo;?
</p>
<p> Or, perhaps, the Europeans simply made a policy determination that the costs 
</p>
<p>of providing patent protection for gene sequences and the like would eventually 
</p>
<p>be outweighed by the fruits of the research and development into this poten-
</p>
<p>tially significant area. Whether or not tweaking the definition of invention in this 
</p>
<p> park and menghaney</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>425
</p>
<p>manner is a smart policy decision may be open to debate, but Europe&rsquo;s preroga-
</p>
<p>tive to make this decision certainly is not. And mere disagreement with this policy 
</p>
<p>choice most certainly does not provide the basis for challenging its legal validity, 
</p>
<p>under TRIPS or otherwise.
</p>
<p> But as we will see, this is essentially what formed the motivation behind an 
</p>
<p>unsuccessful legal challenge brought against India&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;invention&rdquo; to 
</p>
<p>suit its own (vastly different) context: that India&rsquo;s exercise of its own policy pre-
</p>
<p>rogatives in narrowly defining &ldquo;invention&rdquo; was illegal because it failed to provide 
</p>
<p>sufficient incentives for research and development. But TRIPS is a legal document, 
</p>
<p>not a policy document. As such, it does not require countries to adopt and embrace 
</p>
<p>any particular policy priority (save, of course, the policy of promoting &ldquo;access 
</p>
<p>to medicines for all,&rdquo; as stated in the Doha Declaration), as long as its minimum 
</p>
<p>requirements are satisfied.
</p>
<p> If there is no generally agreed-on concept of what an &ldquo;invention&rdquo; is, then, 
</p>
<p>do not countries have the freedom correspondingly to narrow this definition to 
</p>
<p>address countervailing policy priorities, such as promoting access to medicines? 
</p>
<p>The TRIPS Agreement has little to say in this regard. It merely provides that 
</p>
<p>countries may, but are not obliged to, provide more extensive protection than 
</p>
<p>is required under the agreement. But this simply poses the question of what is 
</p>
<p>required under the agreement. To say that TRIPS requires countries to provide pat-
</p>
<p>ent protection to all &ldquo;inventions,&rdquo; but not necessarily to some or all &ldquo;discoveries,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>is redundant, because it presupposes that there is a generally accepted definition 
</p>
<p>of both and a clear delineation between them. But as we have seen, there is not.
</p>
<p> The point here is that there is sufficient variance in practices from around the 
</p>
<p>world to give countries a large degree of flexibility in defining what shall and shall 
</p>
<p>not constitute patentable subject matter to suit their particular policy needs. Pro-
</p>
<p>moting research and development into new drugs undoubtedly is one policy goal, 
</p>
<p>but merely one among many competing goals and one that enjoys no particular 
</p>
<p>pride of place under the TRIPS Agreement. Indeed, after Doha, the policy goal of 
</p>
<p>promoting easy access to affordable medicines could be seen as paramount.
</p>
<p>india&rsquo;s use of trips flexibilities in patent matters: a case study
</p>
<p>With the benefit of the Doha Declaration as an interpretive guide and with the 
</p>
<p>global community of treatment activists breathing down its collective neck, the 
</p>
<p>Indian Parliament in 2005 passed a unique set of provisions that collectively define 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;invention&rdquo; in what is likely to be the most stringent manner in the world. Section 
</p>
<p>3 of the Indian Patents Act is entitled &ldquo;What are not inventions&rdquo; and lists fifteen 
</p>
<p>broad categories as &ldquo;not inventions within the meaning of this Act.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>trips flexibilities in india</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>426
</p>
<p> Certainly the most contentious of these provisions was section 3(d), which was 
</p>
<p>amended to state that the &ldquo;mere discovery&rdquo; of a new form of an existing drug 
</p>
<p>would not be considered an invention unless this new form made the drug sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly more &ldquo;effective.&rdquo; As the parliamentary debates surrounding this sec-
</p>
<p>tion made clear, this provision was designed to prevent a practice known as &ldquo;ever-
</p>
<p>greening&rdquo; (or &ldquo;product life-cycle management,&rdquo; a euphemism coined by those 
</p>
<p>within the industry), whereby drug companies artificially extend the monopoly 
</p>
<p>on an existing drug by filing for and obtaining patents on what are often trivial or 
</p>
<p>minor changes to that drug.
</p>
<p> Just two years after its birth, this provision was made the subject of a legal 
</p>
<p>challenge in the Indian courts by the Swiss multinational drug company Novartis. 
</p>
<p>The story of this litigation, how it came about, and how it was decided is illustrative 
</p>
<p>of how civil society, if provided with the opportunity to participate in the patenting 
</p>
<p>process, can potentially serve as sentinel against the granting of harmful patents.
</p>
<p> This opportunity was provided by way of a broad pregrant opposition provision 
</p>
<p>in the Indian Patents Act, which allowed for &ldquo;any person&rdquo; (as opposed to &ldquo;any per-
</p>
<p>son interested&rdquo; as provided in the old law), to oppose the granting of a patent at any 
</p>
<p>time before grant. Seizing on this opportunity, the Cancer Patients Aid Association 
</p>
<p>(CPAA), an Indian organization providing care and support services to those liv-
</p>
<p>ing with cancer, sought out the assistance of an HIV/AIDS legal organization&mdash;the 
</p>
<p>Lawyers Collective HIV/AIDS Unit&mdash;in filing a pregrant opposition against Novar-
</p>
<p>tis&rsquo;s patent application for imatinib mesylate, trademarked and marketed as Glivec/
</p>
<p>Gleevec by Novartis, a vital treatment for people with chronic myeloid leukemia.
</p>
<p> Imatinib mesylate was developed by Novartis with significant assistance from 
</p>
<p>scientists at the Oregon Health Sciences University, which was funded largely 
</p>
<p>with public funding from the U. S. National Cancer Institute. The drug was hailed 
</p>
<p>widely as a &ldquo;miracle drug,&rdquo; transforming what had been an invariably fatal condi-
</p>
<p>tion into a treatable one&mdash;that is, if one was lucky enough to afford it.
</p>
<p> Novartis was selling imatinib mesylate in India at its global price of about 
</p>
<p>$2,600 per month&mdash;this in a country where the per-capita income is about $820 
</p>
<p>per year&mdash;and had obtained court orders preventing several manufacturers of 
</p>
<p>generic drugs from selling their versions at less than one-tenth of Novartis&rsquo;s price. 
</p>
<p>When the patent application for imatinib mesylate came up for examination, the 
</p>
<p>Cancer Patients Aid Association, along with several generic-drug companies, filed 
</p>
<p>pregrant oppositions to the application, claiming that, among other things, ima-
</p>
<p>tinib mesylate did not qualify as an invention under section 3(d). The Indian Pat-
</p>
<p>ent Office agreed and denied Novartis a patent.
</p>
<p> Novartis then filed suit against the Cancer Patients Aid Association, the Indian 
</p>
<p>generic-drug companies, and the government of India in the Madras High Court, 
</p>
<p> park and menghaney</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>427
</p>
<p>challenging not only the denial of the imatinib mesylate patent, but also the valid-
</p>
<p>ity of section 3(d) itself. Novartis claimed, among other things, that section 3(d) 
</p>
<p>was in violation of the TRIPS Agreement and that it was inconsistent with the 
</p>
<p>Indian Constitution.
</p>
<p> On the TRIPS-compliance issue, Novartis claimed, predictably, that the flex-
</p>
<p>ibilities contemplated by the Doha Declaration were limited only to compulsory 
</p>
<p>licensing and that TRIPS very narrowly limited what countries may and may 
</p>
<p>not define as patentable subject matter. In a press release to assuage the grow-
</p>
<p>ing public outrage at Novartis&rsquo;s actions, it stated, rather paradoxically, &ldquo;Novartis 
</p>
<p>is not challenging any provisions of the Indian patent law that were put in place to 
</p>
<p>promote access. We are challenging parts of the Indian patent law that led to the 
</p>
<p>rejection of the Glivec/Gleevec patent.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> During oral arguments that dragged on and off from January to April 2007, 
</p>
<p>Novartis&rsquo;s lawyers repeatedly based their objection to section 3(d) as providing 
</p>
<p>inadequate incentive to engage in much-needed research and development into 
</p>
<p>new drugs and warned the court of the dire consequences of allowing section 3(d) 
</p>
<p>to stand. At one heated moment, the counsel for Novartis opined that it would be 
</p>
<p>better for the poor to wait twenty years for cheaper medicines than to retain sec-
</p>
<p>tion 3(d), under which no new drugs would be developed at all.
</p>
<p> Several weeks after the close of the dramatic (and at times melodramatic) oral 
</p>
<p>arguments on the matter, the Madras High Court dismissed Novartis&rsquo;s challenge to 
</p>
<p>section 3(d). On the TRIPS-compliance issue, it rightly noted that an Indian court 
</p>
<p>was the inappropriate forum to resolve such a dispute and that the appropriate 
</p>
<p>place for resolving such a dispute between Switzerland and India was before the 
</p>
<p>WTO dispute-resolution panel. On the constitutional issue, however, the court in 
</p>
<p>rather glowing terms praised section 3(d), stating that in upholding this provision 
</p>
<p>it had &ldquo;borne in mind the object of [section 3(d)], namely . . . to provide easy access 
</p>
<p>to the citizens of this country to life saving drugs and to discharge the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tional obligation of providing good health care to its citizens.&rdquo;19
</p>
<p> In addition to its participation in the courtroom, civil society played an enor-
</p>
<p>mous role outside it. Throughout the streets of Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi, hun-
</p>
<p>dreds of protestors shouted slogans decrying Novartis for attempting to &ldquo;shut 
</p>
<p>down the pharmacy of the developing world.&rdquo; In Washington, D.C., activists deliv-
</p>
<p>ered to Novartis&rsquo;s offices a Golden Coffin award for Novartis CEO Daniel Vasella. In 
</p>
<p>Basel, Switzerland, the Swiss NGO Berne Declaration awarded Novartis the 2007 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public Eye Swiss Award,&rdquo; awarded annually to what it deemed to be the most irre-
</p>
<p>sponsible corporation. Despite a raging blizzard with forty-mile-per-hour winds, a 
</p>
<p>handful of determined protestors gathered in front of Novartis&rsquo;s offices in Boston, 
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, chanting &ldquo;Novartis! Stop it! People over profit!&rdquo; And international 
</p>
<p>trips flexibilities in india</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>428
</p>
<p>organizations such as MSF, Oxfam, Care, and others collected nearly half a million 
</p>
<p>signatures from around the globe demanding that Novartis &ldquo;drop the case.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Although Novartis never did drop the case, it was very much aware of the 
</p>
<p>negative publicity it was receiving from all corners of the globe and announced 
</p>
<p>shortly after the decision that it had no intention of appealing it. And the truly 
</p>
<p>international attention this campaign garnered served to bring the issues around 
</p>
<p>patents and access to medicines to the attention of millions, including, no doubt, 
</p>
<p>the two judges who decided the matter, not to mention the Swiss trade minister, 
</p>
<p>who announced shortly after the judgment that the ruling &ldquo;does not concern the 
</p>
<p>Swiss Confederation&rdquo; and that Switzerland had no intention of filing a complaint 
</p>
<p>at the WTO.
</p>
<p> Following upon the Cancer Patients Aid Association&rsquo;s successful opposition to 
</p>
<p>patenting imatinib mesylate, a host of other pregrant patent oppositions followed. 
</p>
<p>Organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS opposed several applications for 
</p>
<p>patents on critical AIDS drugs and have already achieved some success. Rather

</p>
<p>On August 15, 2006, honoring India&rsquo;s Independence Day, Indian activists organized a demonstration during 
</p>
<p>the XVI International AIDS Conference in Toronto. They marched through the conference center with  
</p>
<p>posters in the colors of the Indian flag that read &ldquo;Big Pharma Quit India,&rdquo; &ldquo;Time to Deliver&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life  
</p>
<p>Before Profits.&rdquo; In reference to the &ldquo;Quit India Movement&rdquo; of 1942 against the British colonial rule, they 
</p>
<p>asked global pharmaceutical companies to &ldquo;withdraw all patent applications.&rdquo; (Ga&euml;lle Krikorian)</p>

<p>429
</p>
<p>than risk a negative precedent that may cast doubt on the validity of its patents in 
</p>
<p>other countries, the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline chose to withdraw its 
</p>
<p>pending patent applications for crucial components of anti-HIV therapy in devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries, such as its fixed-dose combination of the AIDS drugs lamivudine 
</p>
<p>and zidovudine, as well as its application for abacavir.
</p>
<p> Indian civil-society groups are now slowly beginning to expand their atten-
</p>
<p>tion to drugs beyond AIDS drugs, recently filing an opposition against Roche&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>application for PEGinterferon, a critical treatment for hepatitis C, a common and 
</p>
<p>often fatal liver disease, that Roche sells in India for about $5000 for a six-month 
</p>
<p>course.20 Many of these patent oppositions are currently pending before the 
</p>
<p>Indian Patent Office, and the coming months will reveal the extent to which India&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>unique patentability provisions, along with active civil-society participation in 
</p>
<p>their application, can prevent harmful patents from being granted. A hopeful sign 
</p>
<p>for opposition to patents in the future came in June 2008, when the Indian Patent 
</p>
<p>Office rejected a patent application for a pediatric formulation of the AIDS drug 
</p>
<p>nevirapine. In rejecting the formulation as a &ldquo;new form&rdquo; of a &ldquo;known substance&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>and thus not patentable under section 3 (d), the Patent Office agreed with the 
</p>
<p>opponents&rsquo; contention of the need to &ldquo;give a strict interpretation of patentability 
</p>
<p>criteria, as decision . . . thereof shall affect the fate of people suffering from HIV/
</p>
<p>AIDS for want of essential medicine.&rdquo;21
</p>
<p> Assuming that the various safeguards in the Indian Patents Act are rigorously 
</p>
<p>enforced, there are indications that they will be extremely effective in controlling 
</p>
<p>the number of patents granted on medicines. As mentioned, section 3 (d) is just 
</p>
<p>one of several provisions that set stricter criteria in defining the scope of patent-
</p>
<p>able subject matter. Others include an exclusion preventing &ldquo;any living thing or 
</p>
<p>non-living substance occurring in nature&rdquo; from being patented (thus precluding 
</p>
<p>things such as gene sequences and naturally occurring substances from patent-
</p>
<p>ability), a broad exclusion barring new uses of already-known substances from 
</p>
<p>patentability (without regard to whether the new use is for a first or subsequent 
</p>
<p>medical use), a provision that states that the &ldquo;mere admixture&rdquo; of substances is 
</p>
<p>not patentable (thus preventing most patents on &ldquo;formulations&rdquo; of known drugs 
</p>
<p>into specific dosage forms, such as tablets or capsules), and a broad exclusion that 
</p>
<p>prevents the patenting of any medicinal treatment of human beings (thus preclud-
</p>
<p>ing the common practice of drafting patent claims for known substances in the 
</p>
<p>form of &ldquo;the method of treating disease X by administering substance Y&rdquo;).
</p>
<p> This last exclusion of &ldquo;methods of treatment&rdquo; is of particular significance. A 
</p>
<p>surprising number of &ldquo;new&rdquo; drugs that are approved are not actually new drugs at 
</p>
<p>all, but merely &ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; that a known substance is also (or only) good at treat-
</p>
<p>ing another condition. A well-known example is sildenafil, better known to most 
</p>
<p>trips flexibilities in india</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>as Viagra as marketed by Pfizer. Sildenafil was originally developed and investi-
</p>
<p>gated as a drug for heart disease, but was ultimately approved for use for erectile 
</p>
<p>dysfunction. But if a substance is already known, it cannot qualify for a patent&mdash;
</p>
<p>in any jurisdiction&mdash;for lack of novelty. The solution? Simply draft the patent 
</p>
<p>claims to cover not the sildenafil itself, but for the &ldquo;method of treating&rdquo; erectile 
</p>
<p>dysfunction by giving a patient sildenafil. But because Indian law includes a broad 
</p>
<p>exclusion on methods of treatment, such a claim would be excluded from patent-
</p>
<p>ability. This same exclusion would similarly preclude the patenting of many other 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;new&rdquo; drugs and in fact would have precluded the patenting of the first AIDS drug 
</p>
<p>ever developed&mdash;AZT&mdash;which had been known since the 1960s and which was 
</p>
<p>originally investigated for use as a cancer drug.
</p>
<p> In addition to these broad substantive safeguards, there is one significant pro-
</p>
<p>cedural bar to patentability that bears mentioning. Because India did not recog-
</p>
<p>nize product patent protection for pharmaceuticals prior to entering into the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement on January 1, 1995, it was not bound to give retroactive effect to its 
</p>
<p>TRIPS obligations. Thus, all new drugs that were &ldquo;invented&rdquo; before 1995 are ineli-
</p>
<p>gible, as a matter of law, for patent protection in India.
</p>
<p> If these provisions are given robust interpretations, it is likely that the majority 
</p>
<p>of new drugs that are coming out today would not qualify for patent protection 
</p>
<p>in India. In fact, if one examines the patents covering the thirty-four new drugs 
</p>
<p>approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between January 2005 and 
</p>
<p>March 2007, up to 70 percent of these new drugs would have no valid patent asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with them as a result of one or more of these substantive and procedural 
</p>
<p>safeguards.
</p>
<p> Of course, the true efficacy of these safeguards depends on how rigorously 
</p>
<p>the Indian Patent Office applies them. Civil-society groups, with their limited 
</p>
<p>resources, cannot possibly challenge the validity of every one of the thousands 
</p>
<p>of patent applications that are pending in India to ensure that these standards are 
</p>
<p>applied rigorously.
</p>
<p> Indeed, there are already indications that some of these standards are not being 
</p>
<p>applied by the Patent Office in a regular and systematic manner. For instance, the 
</p>
<p>Patent Office recently granted a patent to Roche for an application covering valgan-
</p>
<p>ciclovir, a substance used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis, a common 
</p>
<p>and treatable AIDS coinfection that can cause blindness. Remarkably, despite the 
</p>
<p>markedly tougher patentability standards that prevail in India, an investigation into 
</p>
<p>the patent revealed that the Indian Patent Office had granted a number of patent 
</p>
<p>claims that even the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had rejected.22 Indian civil-
</p>
<p>society groups have filed a suit opposing this patent, and it is currently pending.

</p>
<p>some concluding observations
</p>
<p>A radical understanding of the scope of available TRIPS flexibilities is not only 
</p>
<p>possible, but required in order to fulfill the Doha Declaration&rsquo;s mandate to promote 
</p>
<p>access to medicines for all. India&rsquo;s experiments in defining the scope of patentable 
</p>
<p>subject matter to suit its overriding policy objective of protecting public health 
</p>
<p>should be seen as the start, not the end, of an effort to push at the very boundar-
</p>
<p>ies of what TRIPS allows. To do less is to resign ourselves to a world in which uni-
</p>
<p>versal patent protection handcuffs the effective utilization of even the &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>flexibilities that are available.
</p>
<p> As the Indian experience has shown, the utilization of these TRIPS flexibili-
</p>
<p>ties in a manner that gives civil society an opportunity to participate in a mean-
</p>
<p>ingful way is an essential component of the struggle for access to medicines, one 
</p>
<p>that other developing countries can and should incorporate into their laws. But as 
</p>
<p>essential as civil society&rsquo;s participation is, the limited funds and resources of civil-
</p>
<p>society groups will often constrain their level of participation to triage, selecting 
</p>
<p>out of necessity only those cases that are of utmost importance.
</p>
<p> In order to address these issues adequately on all levels, alternative models of 
</p>
<p>promoting innovation without sacrificing access need to be explored. Whether the 
</p>
<p>alternative models suggested by the Inter-Governmental Working Group on Public 
</p>
<p>Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property prove to be workable remains to be 
</p>
<p>seen. Our fingers are crossed.
</p>
<p> notes
</p>
<p>1 Although the TRIPS Agreement came into force in 1995, developing countries, including 
</p>
<p>India, were given a five-year &ldquo;transition period&rdquo; to come into compliance with its obligations. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, for countries that did not recognize product patent protection for certain areas 
</p>
<p>of technology prior to 1995, there was an additional five-year transition period available to 
</p>
<p>introduce product patent protection in these areas. Because India did not recognize product 
</p>
<p>patent protection for pharmaceuticals prior to 1995, it had ten years&mdash;until 2005&mdash;to recog-
</p>
<p>nize product patents in this area. See TRIPS, Articles 65.2 and 65.4. The TRIPS Agreement

<p>TRIPS	Flexibilities	in	Thailand:		
</p>
<p>Between	Law	and	Politics
</p>
<p>Jiraporn Limpananont and Kannikar Kijtiwatchakul
</p>
<p>The United States succeeded in forcing the members of the World Trade Organi-
</p>
<p>zation to accept the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agree-
</p>
<p>ment, but also had to accept that intellectual property monopolies must incorpo-
</p>
<p>rate &ldquo;breathing space&rdquo; for developing countries in the form of &ldquo;flexibilities&rdquo; in the 
</p>
<p>protection of intellectual property rights because of the problem that patents can 
</p>
<p>cause. Compulsory licensing by a government for public, noncommercial use is one 
</p>
<p>of these special mechanisms or &ldquo;flexibilities&rdquo; permissible under the TRIPS Agree-
</p>
<p>ment, allowing countries to override drug patents in order to save lives.1
</p>
<p> The TRIPS Agreement has been in effect for over a decade. Although devel-
</p>
<p>oping and least-developed countries were allowed to delay its implementation,2 
</p>
<p>many of them amended their laws to comply with TRIPS more quickly than they 
</p>
<p>were required to do so. For example, Thailand amended its law in 1992, eight years 
</p>
<p>before the deadline. However, until recently, none of these nations made use of 
</p>
<p>the provision for compulsory licensing, in part because one of the areas in which it 
</p>
<p>made the most sense to employ this provision was that of access to medicines, but 
</p>
<p>most of the drugs used in the past decade were old enough not to be patented.
</p>
<p> After the outbreak of HIV/AIDS in Thailand around 1989, the mortality rate 
</p>
<p>of AIDS patients there became very high, as did the price of antiretroviral drugs. 
</p>
<p>Similar scenarios took place in most developing countries. When public-health cri-
</p>
<p>ses over the inaccessibility of medicines peaked, since more recent drugs were now 
</p>
<p>under patent, governments began to implement government-use compulsory licens-
</p>
<p>ing under TRIPS in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This move 
</p>
<p>was led by Indonesia, followed by Malaysia and then, more recently, Thailand.
</p>
<p> Between the end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007, the Thai minister of health 
</p>
<p>issued three compulsory licenses for drugs targeting HIV/AIDS and heart disease. 
</p>
<p>This initiative provoked explosive responses from the U.S. administration and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> limpananont and kijtiwatchakul436
</p>
<p>Congress, as well as from multinational drug companies. The issuance of the com-
</p>
<p>pulsory licenses in Thailand was one of the first examples of a developing country 
</p>
<p>with significant manufacturing capacities using compulsory licensing of medicines 
</p>
<p>since the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, with its 
</p>
<p>support for the &ldquo;right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access 
</p>
<p>to medicines for all&rdquo; and its affirmation of the use of TRIPS flexibilities to achieve 
</p>
<p>this end, was adopted in 2001. It is also the first serious political showdown over 
</p>
<p>developing countries&rsquo; use of compulsory licenses.
</p>
<p> This article examines the use of compulsory licenses in Thailand and is intended 
</p>
<p>as a case study of the ability of developing countries to make use of them. Reac-
</p>
<p>tions to the Thai initiative highlight the tensions between the law and politics as 
</p>
<p>far as the TRIPS Agreement and public health are concerned. They raise questions 
</p>
<p>concerning the meaning of the TRIPS flexibilities and the role of political pressures 
</p>
<p>in intellectual property policy.
</p>
<p>the issuing of compulsory licenses in thailand
</p>
<p>The impact of pharmaceutical product patents on accessibility to medicines is well 
</p>
<p>recognized. For instance, they cause high prices for patented drugs and delays in 
</p>
<p>the introduction of generic drugs in the market.3 The Declaration on TRIPS and 
</p>
<p>Public Health adopted in Doha reflected that impact in Article 3.4 In the 1990s, the 
</p>
<p>prices of antiretroviral drugs in Thailand kept them out of reach of people with 
</p>
<p>HIV. The daily cost of the medicine is about two to ten times the average daily 
</p>
<p>wage. In reaction to this situation, on December 22 and 23, 1999, about one hun-
</p>
<p>dred people with HIV and activists from NGOs camped in the grass yard in front 
</p>
<p>of the Ministry of Public Health. They requested that the government authorities 
</p>
<p>apply a compulsory license to an antiretroviral drug called didanosine (ddI), manu-
</p>
<p>factured by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Barr Laboratories and patented as Videx, so 
</p>
<p>that cheap generic drugs could be produced.
</p>
<p> The government refused. Since its reason for not issuing a compulsory license 
</p>
<p>was fear of U.S. trade sanctions, the NGOs wrote to the U.S. president, Bill Clinton. 
</p>
<p>The reply confirmed Thailand&rsquo;s right to implement compulsory licenses under the 
</p>
<p>TRIPS Agreement. However, the letter was not enough to reassure the minister of 
</p>
<p>Public Health, who still refused to issue a compulsory license for ddI. This reluc-
</p>
<p>tance to use compulsory licenses to solve health problems is often found in most 
</p>
<p>developing and least-developed countries, whose governments fear economic and 
</p>
<p>politic retaliation.
</p>
<p> At the time, most of the academics, senior staff members in the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Public Health, and pharmacists in the Government Pharmaceutical Organization,5 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>trips flexibilities in thailand 437
</p>
<p>which had already done the research to produce ddI, encouraged the government 
</p>
<p>to issue the compulsory license (CL). The &ldquo;Royal Thai Government should now 
</p>
<p>implement CL for one of the needed ARVs [antiretrovirals] to learn about the pro-
</p>
<p>cess,&rdquo; said a senior staff member. And the deputy director of the Research and 
</p>
<p>Development Institute at the Government Pharmaceutical Organization said: &ldquo;We 
</p>
<p>are conducting the research and development of patented drugs such as efavirenz, 
</p>
<p>lopinavir, and the ddI pellet. But to produce these drugs, it requires the decision of 
</p>
<p>the Royal Thai Government to issue compulsory licensing.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> In 2002, in response to the submission of fifty thousand signatures from Thai 
</p>
<p>citizens to the parliament, Thailand passed the National Health Security Act. 
</p>
<p>According to it, the government has the obligation to provide health services to 
</p>
<p>every Thai citizen. However, because of the limited health budget, high-cost treat-
</p>
<p>ments such as the antiretroviral drugs for AIDS were excluded from the service.
</p>
<p> In 2003, the Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) launched an 
</p>
<p>antiretroviral cocktail drug in one pill named GPO-vir at the price of only one U.S. 
</p>
<p>dollar per day. Despite the patent law, this was possible because none of the three 
</p>
<p>drugs involved were patented in Thailand. This combination, prescribed as a first-
</p>
<p>line regimen, came to be used by the vast majority of the patients in Thailand, 
</p>
<p>Sticker printed by Thai activists in support 
</p>
<p>of the use of compulsory licensing to 
</p>
<p>increase access to medicine.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>438
</p>
<p>except when contraindicated by side effects or medical conditions banning the use 
</p>
<p>of one of the drugs included in the combination. Because the cost of the treatment 
</p>
<p>had dramatically fallen to only one dollar per day, a request from NGOs and peo-
</p>
<p>ple living with HIV/AIDS to include antiretrovirals in the pharmaceutical benefit 
</p>
<p>scheme was accepted by the government.
</p>
<p> However, two years after the implementation of this new system, the National 
</p>
<p>Health Security Office faced the risk of running out of funds for antiretrovirals 
</p>
<p>as a consequence of the high prices of second-line drugs needed by patients 
</p>
<p>who developed drug resistance to GPO-vir or who suffered from important side 
</p>
<p>effects.6 The National Health Security Office and the government health authority 
</p>
<p>then tried to negotiate with drug companies to reduce these prices, but failed.
</p>
<p> In 2004, negotiations for a free-trade agreement between Thailand and the 
</p>
<p>United States were initiated. Resistance from the public to the agreement was 
</p>
<p>important and grew in part in reaction to U.S. requests to increase intellectual 
</p>
<p>property protections. The level of protection sought by the United States, going 
</p>
<p>beyond WTO standards&mdash;which is why they are called &ldquo;TRIPS-plus&rdquo;&mdash;represented 
</p>
<p>an increase in the barriers preventing access to medicines. Two years later, this 
</p>
<p>matter was one of the main issues raised against the administration of the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was finally overthrown in a military coup. The 
</p>
<p>issue of free-trade agreements and the inaccessibility of medicines were raised by 
</p>
<p>most speakers during the campaign against Taksin&rsquo;s administration, which mobi-
</p>
<p>lized a hundred thousand people and produced massive demonstrations every eve-
</p>
<p>ning for two months before the military coup took place.
</p>
<p> In December 2005, the UN Development Programme, in cooperation with the 
</p>
<p>World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Programme on HIV/AIDS, the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Public Health, and Chulalongkorn University, held a conference entitled Free 
</p>
<p>Trade Agreement-related Intellectual Property Rights: The Case of Drug Consump-
</p>
<p>tion. Academics from around the world were invited to share their experiences 
</p>
<p>and research work relevant to free-trade agreements and access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>The conference concluded that the excessive U.S. demands, exceeding the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>standards, would undermine Thailand&rsquo;s access to essential drugs. The meeting pre-
</p>
<p>sented its policy proposals in a press conference, where delegates urged the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment to preserve its sovereignty over the use of compulsory licensing provided 
</p>
<p>by the TRIPS Agreement. They also recommended that Thailand apply compulsory 
</p>
<p>licensing to second-line antiretrovirals and refuse free-trade-agreement provisions 
</p>
<p>on intellectual property exceeding the level of protection in TRIPS Agreement. 
</p>
<p>The conclusions of the conference were put into an article written by Dr. William 
</p>
<p>Aldis, the representative of the WHO in Thailand, and were published in the Bang-
</p>
<p>kok Post on January 9, 2006, the day before the beginning of the sixth round of 
</p>
<p> limpananont and kijtiwatchakul</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>439
</p>
<p>Thai-U.S. free-trade agreement negotiations in Chiang Mai. The U.S. administra-
</p>
<p>tion reacted by putting pressure on the WHO Secretariat, and in March 2006, Dr. 
</p>
<p>Aldis was suddenly removed from his position in Thailand.
</p>
<p> The sixth round of the Thai-U.S. free-trade-agreement negotiations was also 
</p>
<p>marked by intense mobilizations from civil society. About ten thousand people 
</p>
<p>representing eleven networks of nationwide people&rsquo;s organizations came together 
</p>
<p>to protest the free-trade-agreement negotiations in Chiang Mai.7 Although the 
</p>
<p>negotiations did not break down completely, the negotiators frantically had to find 
</p>
<p>a new meeting place. The power of the people, mobilized by the dissemination 
</p>
<p>of knowledge and efforts to increase public awareness, made the Thai-U.S. free-
</p>
<p>trade deal very questionable, especially U.S, demands for a TRIPS-plus standard 
</p>
<p>for drug patent protection.
</p>
<p> Like the December 2005 conference, a World Bank report entitled &ldquo;The Eco-
</p>
<p>nomics of Effective AIDS Treatment: Evaluating Policy in Thailand&rdquo; sent a mes-
</p>
<p>sage to Thailand that it was time to brave it out and use compulsory licensing.8 
</p>
<p>This report was an evaluation of the three-year-long attempt by the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Public Health to expand its antiretroviral treatment services. It warned that 
</p>
<p>without a prompt decision to ensure access to newer drugs, the increasing 
</p>
<p>costs of treatment would be too high for the government to continue provid-
</p>
<p>ing national access to the antiretroviral program, which had been highly praised. 
</p>
<p>Without any action taken to lower the prices of these drugs, the government&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>budget to run this program would have had to be increased fivefold within fif-
</p>
<p>teen years. During the Thaksin administration, Dr. Sanguan Nitayarumphong, 
</p>
<p>the secretary-general of the National Health Security Office, and Pinij Jaru-
</p>
<p>sombat, the minister of public health, agreed that compulsory licensing was a 
</p>
<p>mechanism that could support the national health system. They decided that the 
</p>
<p>matter be investigated so that a decision could be made. A subcommittee dedi-
</p>
<p>cated to implementing government use of patented drugs and medical supplies  
</p>
<p>was established.
</p>
<p> This subcommittee was set up on January 12, 2006 and consisted of representa-
</p>
<p>tives from a wide range of concerned parties, including the commerce and pub-
</p>
<p>lic health ministries, the Council of State, the Law Society of Thailand, hospital 
</p>
<p>doctors, networks of people living with AIDS and cancer patients. As a result of 
</p>
<p>its work, the subcommittee passed a resolution calling for a compulsory license 
</p>
<p>to produce efavirenz, which was finally approved by the National Health Secu-
</p>
<p>rity Board in August 2006. The minister of public health asked the subcommittee 
</p>
<p>to consider carefully the written compulsory license announcement decree. One 
</p>
<p>week later, on September 19, the military coup took place.

</p>
<p>October 2006, he surrounded himself with a team of experts who, over the years, 
</p>
<p>had accumulated knowledge on intellectual property issues. The secretary-general 
</p>
<p>of the National Health Security Office, who had served as the chair of the previ-
</p>
<p>ous subcommittee, sent him the conclusions of its work and the recommendation 
</p>
<p>to issue the compulsory license for efavirenz. Finally, at the end of a process of give 
</p>
<p>and take between the ministry and the subcommittee, the first compulsory license 
</p>
<p>announcement about efavirenz was made, followed a few months later by two 
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p> The first compulsory license was issued on November 29, 2006 on the first-
</p>
<p>line drug efavirenz, commercially known as Stocrin, made by Merck Sharp and 
</p>
<p>Dohme, the UK subsidiary of the U.S. pharmaceutical company Merck. On January 
</p>
<p>24, 2007, a second license was issued on the second-line drug lopinavir/ritonavir,  
</p>
<p>commercially known as Kaletra, made by Abbott. Another license was granted 
</p>
<p>on January 25, 2007 on clopidogrel, an antiplatelet drug used in the treatment of 
</p>
<p>coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, 
</p>
<p>commercially known as Plavix and made by Sanofi-Aventis.
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Public Health interest and the life of the people must come before commercial 
</p>
<p>interest.&rdquo; This sentence appeared at the beginning of the white paper on drug pat-
</p>
<p>ents issued by the Ministry of Public Health.9 This document cites legal rights and 
</p>
<p>justifications for the use of compulsory licensing for the public interest: The use 
</p>
<p>of the patent rights for the three patented drugs serves noncommercial purposes 
</p>
<p>and would be limited to patients covered under three government welfare systems, 
</p>
<p>the National Health Security System, Social Security System, and the Civil Servant 
</p>
<p>Medical Benefit Scheme.
</p>
<p> The Ministry of Public Health&rsquo;s white paper pointed out the reasons behind 
</p>
<p>this decision: &ldquo;The Thai Ministry of Public Health firmly believes in a moder-
</p>
<p>ate and public interest oriented approach to implement the intellectual property 
</p>
<p>right. We are convinced and committed to the view that &lsquo;Public Health interest 
</p>
<p>and the life of the people must come before commercial interest.&rsquo;&rdquo; The government 
</p>
<p>expected to save 1,035 to 1,665 million baht (32 million to 51 million U.S. dollars, 
</p>
<p>using June 2010 exchange rates) in its annual budget and to provide an increase in 
</p>
<p>drug access for patients of sixfold to twelvefold.
</p>
<p> Since the end of 1999, when the request for a compulsory license for ddI had 
</p>
<p>been made, the problem of accessibility to antiretrovirals had become more and 
</p>
<p>more serious, and since then, the campaign for access to medicines has been car-
</p>
<p>ried on continuously by Thai NGOs,10 by academics, and by several civil-society 
</p>
<p>groups, supported by international NGOs.11
</p>
<p> As this account has shown, compulsory licenses under the TRIPS flexibilities 
</p>
<p>provisions could be implemented in Thailand because three main factors occurred

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>441
</p>
<p>concurrently: public awareness of and knowledge about compulsory licensing, the 
</p>
<p>continuous pressure of social movements, and the political will of public agents. As 
</p>
<p>the white paper on the compulsory licensing of patented drugs put it, these three 
</p>
<p>factors form &ldquo;the so-called &lsquo;Triangle that moves the mountain.&rsquo;&rdquo; The white paper 
</p>
<p>also states what the Thai experience shows about the effort to implement com-
</p>
<p>pulsory licenses under the TRIPS flexibilities in any country. Doing so requires an 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;educated and motivated society that will push for and support the political com-
</p>
<p>mitment to bring real and sustainable success to any social reform movement.&rdquo;12
</p>
<p>reactions to the thai initiative
</p>
<p>There was overwhelming support for Thailand&rsquo;s use of compulsory licensing from 
</p>
<p>various international organizations and NGOs, for example the UN Programme on 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS,13 M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF),14 the Third World Network,15 the 
</p>
<p>Consumer Project on Technology,16 and the Clinton Foundation.17 Thanphuying 
</p>
<p>(Dame) Preeya Kasemsan, chair of the Public Health Committee of the National 
</p>
<p>Legislative Assembly, sent a letter dated February 20, 2007, praising the govern-
</p>
<p>ment&rsquo;s announcement of the exercise of compulsory licensing. &ldquo;Such implementa-
</p>
<p>tion is beneficial to a great number of people and will increase the people&rsquo;s access 
</p>
<p>to essential drugs. As the government has a limited budget, such enforcement is 
</p>
<p>legitimate and in compliance with international principles currently adopted by 
</p>
<p>the global community.&rdquo;18
</p>
<p> A letter sent by MSF to Condoleezza Rice, the U.S. secretary of state, and to 
</p>
<p>Susan Schwab, the United States trade representative demanded that the United 
</p>
<p>States stop interfering in Thailand&rsquo;s compulsory licensing. It pointed out that:
</p>
<p>Thailand&rsquo;s decision will have important consequences, not only for Thailand, but 
</p>
<p>for any developing country that needs to obtain low-cost generic products. If Thai-
</p>
<p>land follows through and begins to buy from generic suppliers, it will create a larger 
</p>
<p>global market for generic products, stimulate competition, and lower prices every-
</p>
<p>where for the newer products. While the benefits of expanded generic competition 
</p>
<p>are widely appreciated, many developing countries have been reluctant to issue 
</p>
<p>compulsory licenses because of fears that the United States government will oppose 
</p>
<p>such actions and exert pressure.19
</p>
<p> While the Thai Ministry of Public Health&rsquo;s commitment to the view that the 
</p>
<p>right to life of the people must come before commercial interests has been praised 
</p>
<p>by most of Thai media, international NGOs, including MSF, and Oxfam, some U.S. 
</p>
<p>NGOs, and the UN Joint Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS,20 it has also been dis-
</p>
<p>approved of, opposed, and lobbied against by pharmaceutical companies and the 
</p>
<p>trips flexibilities in thailand</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>countries that support them. When Thailand announced its three compulsory 
</p>
<p>licenses, the pharmaceutical companies, anxious to stem the tide of such practices 
</p>
<p>among developing countries, retaliated aggressively, using every means available. 
</p>
<p>One indication of their political and economic power is the threat by the U.S. gov-
</p>
<p>ernment to use Special 301 measures against Thailand, taking Thai exports hostage 
</p>
<p>to prevent Thailand from doing any business with which the U.S. government is 
</p>
<p>not in agreement.
</p>
<p> The pharmaceutical companies and their supporters made several arguments 
</p>
<p>to try to discredit the action of the Thai Ministry of Health. These arguments are 
</p>
<p>characteristic forms of criticism from these actors. To make them, the pharmaceu-
</p>
<p>tical industry launched an intense media and publicity campaign. Many foreign 
</p>
<p>media, especially the Wall Street Journal, accused Thailand of violating intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rules. Several others admitted at some point that the move was legal, 
</p>
<p>but elsewhere employed the language of &ldquo;patent breaking&rdquo; or &ldquo;patent overriding,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>thereby connoting that Thailand was breaking the law. Public-relations lobbyists 
</p>
<p>publicized false and misleading information in the international and local press, as 
</p>
<p>well as on the Internet.
</p>
<p> The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, the Thai affiliate 
</p>
<p>of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which is the most 
</p>
<p>powerful association of the multinational drug industry, took a leading role in ini-
</p>
<p>tially opposing Thailand&rsquo;s compulsory licensing by denouncing it as appropriating 
</p>
<p>the private sector&rsquo;s property. It also threatened to suspend its investments in Thai-
</p>
<p>land. In addition, the multinational pharmaceutical companies argued that Thai-
</p>
<p>land&rsquo;s exercise of compulsory licensing was illegal under both the TRIPS Agree-
</p>
<p>ment and the Thai Patent Act.
</p>
<p> These tactics did not work, in part because their claims were wrong. Numer-
</p>
<p>ous authorities, including the U.S. trade representative,21 the director general of 
</p>
<p>the WHO,22 and many intellectual property rights lawyers,23 have made statements 
</p>
<p>confirming Thailand&rsquo;s compliance with the TRIPS Agreement.
</p>
<p> The use of compulsory licensing is not the appropriation of private-sector 
</p>
<p>property, but the lawful exercise of TRIPS flexibilities. Article 31 (b) of TRIPS 
</p>
<p>states:
</p>
<p>such use may only be permitted if, prior to such use, the proposed user has made 
</p>
<p>efforts to obtain authorization from the right holder on reasonable commercial 
</p>
<p>terms and conditions and that such efforts have not been successful within a rea-
</p>
<p>sonable period of time. This requirement may be waived by a Member in the case of 
</p>
<p>a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of pub-
</p>
<p>lic non-commercial use. . . . In the case of public non-commercial use, where the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment or contractor, without making a patent search, knows or has demonstrable 
</p>
<p> limpananont and kijtiwatchakul</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>443
</p>
<p>grounds to know that a valid patent is or will be used by or for the government, the 
</p>
<p>right holder shall be informed promptly.
</p>
<p> Reasonable remuneration was offered in recognition of the patent holders&rsquo;  
</p>
<p>rights. According to the Thai government&rsquo;s proclamation in the &ldquo;Public Use of Pat-
</p>
<p>ents for Pharmaceutical Products,&rdquo; patent holders were allocated a 0.5 percent roy-
</p>
<p>alty fee and could also seek to change this remuneration rate through negotiations 
</p>
<p>with the government or appeal to the Department of Intellectual Property. But no 
</p>
<p>patent holders have entered into such negotiations. Indonesia and Malaysia had 
</p>
<p>similar experiences when they announced their public use of compulsory licens-
</p>
<p>ing in 2004. The multinational pharmaceutical companies preferred to give up their 
</p>
<p>royalties rather than recognize and legitimate developing countries&rsquo; legal rights 
</p>
<p>by negotiating the remuneration rate for government use of their patents. Neither 
</p>
<p>did they want to set an example of accepting remuneration. The companies, of 
</p>
<p>course, could still sell their drugs in Thailand&mdash;all that was being taken away was 
</p>
<p>a government-granted monopoly that the companies were abusing through their  
</p>
<p>pricing practices.
</p>
<p> And Thailand in fact had complied with Thai law, as well as with international 
</p>
<p>agreements. When the multinational pharmaceutical companies sought to block 
</p>
<p>Thailand&rsquo;s exercise of compulsory licensing by arguing that it was illegal under 
</p>
<p>Thai law, the newspapers reported that the Department of Intellectual Property 
</p>
<p>was poised to ask for the Council of State&rsquo;s interpretation.24 Many Thai experts on 
</p>
<p>intellectual property law and the world&rsquo;s leading experts in international intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property law, including Professors Brook Baker of the Northeastern Univer-
</p>
<p>sity School of Law, Sean Flynn of American University, and Dr. Carlos M. Correa of 
</p>
<p>the University of Buenos Aires, expressed their objections to the move. According 
</p>
<p>to them, there was no need for the interpretation. Article 51 of the Thai Patent 
</p>
<p>Act states very clearly the government&rsquo;s right to issue licenses on patented drugs 
</p>
<p>clearly without prior consent of patent holder.
</p>
<p> Representatives of the Thai Network of People living with HIV/AIDS and of 
</p>
<p>other AIDS NGOs asked Mrs. Puangrat Assawapisit, director general of the Depart-
</p>
<p>ment of Intellectual Property, for clarification on the matter. On February 21, 2007, 
</p>
<p>the Department of Intellectual Property turned down the company&rsquo;s appeal and 
</p>
<p>suggested that any complaint about the Ministry of Public Health&rsquo;s failure to 
</p>
<p>follow Thai legal procedures should be filed with the Administrative Court. The 
</p>
<p>Department of Intellectual Property stated that it had jurisdiction only over 
</p>
<p>appeals regarding the amount of remuneration. The company gave up at this point.
</p>
<p> These legal claims against the use of compulsory licensing thus failed, but at 
</p>
<p>least they were made in legal venues. By far the most insufferable component of

</p>
<p>the attack was the smear campaign run by USA for Innovation, a group claiming to 
</p>
<p>be a nonprofit organization, but in fact a thinly disguised shill for drug firms con-
</p>
<p>nected to Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, a firm whose clients include many 
</p>
<p>multinational drug corporations and the ousted prime minister, Thaksin Shinawa-
</p>
<p>tra. It bought advertising space in the Thai and foreign print media and created its 
</p>
<p>own Web site accusing the military-backed government of Thailand of turning the 
</p>
<p>country into a dictatorship like Burma by illegally issuing compulsory licenses.
</p>
<p> This was clearly false, and it is wrong to attribute the decision to the coup. 
</p>
<p>Efforts to counter life-threatening monopolies over essential drugs had been going 
</p>
<p>on for more than a decade and were spearheaded by civil society, not the mili-
</p>
<p>tary. As we noted above, a subcommittee to implement compulsory licensing had 
</p>
<p>been set up under the government led by Prime Minister Thaksin, and before the 
</p>
<p>military coup of September 2006 that deposed Thaksin, this committee already had 
</p>
<p>resolved to impose compulsory licensing on the antiretroviral drug efavirenz. The 
</p>
<p>minister of public health who took office after the coup merely carried out this 
</p>
<p>legitimate and orderly process. The military budget had nothing to do with the 
</p>
<p>decision, which would have come regardless of the change in government.
</p>
<p> The organization also claimed that GPO-vir, produced by the Government 
</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Organization, was of low quality, and it submitted letters to the 
</p>
<p>U.S. Congress and the Bush administration urging them to retaliate against Thai-
</p>
<p>land, claiming that the drug was ineffective and not approved by the WHO. USA 
</p>
<p>for Innovation cited a study from Mahidol University in 2005 that purportedly 
</p>
<p>showed that GPO-vir caused much more drug resistance than other antiretrovirals, 
</p>
<p>from 39.6 to 58 percent of all patients taking it. However, the study did not provide 
</p>
<p>references, and drug resistance rate is not related to the quality of the medicine at 
</p>
<p>all. The fact is that this drug, produced by the Government Pharmaceutical Organi-
</p>
<p>zation under a Thai utility patent, has saved tens of thousands of lives. This drug is 
</p>
<p>registered in Thailand, and its quality has been assured by the Thai Food and Drug 
</p>
<p>Administration since 2003. The reduction in the costs of antiretroviral treatment 
</p>
<p>through GPO-vir from 2,000 baht to 400 baht per day has yielded savings that have 
</p>
<p>allowed the expansion of the universal health coverage program to antiretrovirals.
</p>
<p> Such false accusations provide an example or what sort of reaction countries 
</p>
<p>may have to face when making use of their right to issue compulsory licensing. 
</p>
<p>There is a risk that they may consequently discourage the implementation of com-
</p>
<p>pulsory licenses in other developing or less developed countries, even though the 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies&rsquo; assertions are pure lies and intimidations.
</p>
<p> The Bangkok Post and The Nation newspapers each dedicated for free one full 
</p>
<p>page to voices from Thai civil society to publish their responses to the allegations 
</p>
<p>of USA for Innovation:

</p>
<p>USA for Innovation is an organization set up to serve the interests of U.S. drug com-
</p>
<p>panies upset by Thailand&rsquo;s recent announcements of compulsory licenses permitted 
</p>
<p>by the WTO Agreement. This organization is adept at manipulating and distorting 
</p>
<p>the facts to achieve its purposes.
</p>
<p> The accusations by USA for Innovation, which appeared in an advertisement 
</p>
<p>in the English-language press a few days ago, distort the facts by denigrating the 
</p>
<p>antiviral drugs produced by Thailand&rsquo;s Government Pharmaceutical Organization as 
</p>
<p>being worthless. The truth is that GPO-vir has played a significant role in reducing 
</p>
<p>the annual mortality rate among Thai AIDS patients from 8,246 in 2001 to 1,613 in 
</p>
<p>2006. More than tens of thousands of lives have been saved over the past 3&ndash;4 years.
</p>
<p> The study by Mahidol University cited by the USA for Innovation to claim that 
</p>
<p>GPO-vir had a high resistance of between 39.6 and 58 per cent is in fact research that 
</p>
<p>attempted to study the resistance among long-term patients who had already failed 
</p>
<p>the treatment. There are no research findings available to compare the rates of resis-
</p>
<p>tance to GPO-vir with the rates of resistance to equivalent originator products.
</p>
<p> Thailand is internationally recognized for its efforts to provide health coverage 
</p>
<p>for all and to ensure that HIV/AIDS patients have universal access to the appropri-
</p>
<p>ate drugs.
</p>
<p> The decision to authorize the compulsory licensing of necessary drugs shows 
</p>
<p>the praiseworthy courage of the Thai government and the Ministry of Public Health 
</p>
<p>to put the lives of the Thai people before commercial benefits.
</p>
<p>When confronted by the forceful refutation of their claims and the strength of 
</p>
<p>both international and internal support for compulsory licensing in Thailand, the 
</p>
<p>multinational pharmaceutical companies had other strategies in reserve. They 
</p>
<p>engaged in aggressive local lobbying. For example, Nimit Tienudom, director of the 
</p>
<p>AIDS ACCESS Foundation, revealed that Abbott had asked to meet with the Thai 
</p>
<p>Network of People living with HIV/AIDS and to offer to reduce the price of Kaletra 
</p>
<p>for the government in exchange for the network&rsquo;s lobbying with the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Public Health to cancel its use of compulsory licensing.
</p>
<p> The companies also sought to exert pressure on the Thai government by lever-
</p>
<p>aging diplomats from their home countries. At the same time that Abbott was 
</p>
<p>approaching AIDS activists, the ambassadors of the United States, the European 
</p>
<p>Union, France, and Switzerland met with the Thai ministers of public health, com-
</p>
<p>merce, and foreign affairs many times, signaling their disapproval of Thailand&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>pursuit of compulsory licenses. They cited Thailand&rsquo;s failure to hold prior negotia-
</p>
<p>tions with the patent holder, despite acknowledging that such negotiations were 
</p>
<p>not legally required and even though there were several negotiations on price 
</p>
<p>reduction with the companies before issuance of compulsory licensing.

</p>
<p> Meanwhile twenty-two members of the U.S. Congress, led by Henry Waxman, 
</p>
<p>sent a letter urging the U.S. trade representative not to impede Thailand&rsquo;s exercise 
</p>
<p>of its legal rights. In her reply, the U.S. trade representative, Susan Schwab, admit-
</p>
<p>ted that Thailand was authorized to issue compulsory licenses.25
</p>
<p> Abbott Labs resorted to the tactic of sending a letter to the Drug Control Divi-
</p>
<p>sion of Thailand&rsquo;s Food and Drug Administration, instructing it to withdraw all 
</p>
<p>applications to register its new drugs in Thailand. The Thai newspaper Matichon 
</p>
<p>Daily and the Wall Street Journal reported that &ldquo;Abbott will not apply for the reg-
</p>
<p>istration of new drugs and will withdraw all applications to register new drugs 
</p>
<p>in Thailand until the government takes heed of intellectual property, including 
</p>
<p>the cancellation of compulsory licensing.&rdquo; The withdrawal of the drugs&mdash;Zem-
</p>
<p>plar, for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, Simdax, for heart failure treat-
</p>
<p>ment, Humira, a medicine for treating autoimmune disease, and Aluvia tablets, 
</p>
<p>a new formulation of the heat-stable second-line AIDS drug&mdash;was clear retalia-
</p>
<p>tion for the Thai government&rsquo;s use of compulsory licensing for Abbott&rsquo;s Kaletra  
</p>
<p>(lopinavir/ritonavir).
</p>
<p> As soon as Abbott&rsquo;s move was widely reported, the Thai Network of People 
</p>
<p>Living with HIV/AIDS, the AIDS ACCESS Foundation, the Centre for AIDS Rights, 
</p>
<p>the Thai NGO Coalition on AIDS, and the Foundation for Consumers condemned 
</p>
<p>the company for maliciously putting pressure on Thailand. Its action, they con-
</p>
<p>tended, reflected the pharmaceutical industry&rsquo;s limitless greed and a total lack of 
</p>
<p>concern for the Thai people. These opposing organizations urged the Thai people to 
</p>
<p>boycott Abbott&rsquo;s products, for example by buying generic versions or alternatives 
</p>
<p>to drugs made by Abbott.
</p>
<p> The move to strike back at Abbott spread to the Network of Parents, the 
</p>
<p>Rural Doctors Club, the Rural Pharmacists Club, and the Network of Patients with 
</p>
<p>Kidney and Heart Diseases. These groups denounced Abbott&rsquo;s action as holding 
</p>
<p>patients and consumers hostage in order to force the government to end its use of 
</p>
<p>compulsory licensing, even though the Thai government had done nothing in con-
</p>
<p>travention of domestic law and international rules.
</p>
<p> Anger against Abbott soon spread globally. On April 26, 2007, one day before 
</p>
<p>Abbott&rsquo;s annual shareholders meeting in Chicago, demonstrations were held in 
</p>
<p>front of the company&rsquo;s offices in cities in France, the United States, the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom, Germany, India, South Africa, China, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Can-
</p>
<p>ada, Indonesia, Japan, and Singapore. Activists around the world urged a boycott 
</p>
<p>of Abbott&rsquo;s products. In France, the group of people living with HIV/AIDS known 
</p>
<p>as Act Up-Paris organized a &ldquo;netstrike,&rdquo; or denial of service attack, on Abbott&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Web site. So many supporters visited Abbott&rsquo;s site that the servers became over-
</p>
<p>loaded and the Web site collapsed.

</p>
<p> A day later, on April 27, Jon Ungphakorn, a former senator of Thailand and 
</p>
<p>secretary general of the AIDS ACCESS Foundation, and Wirat Purahong, chairper-
</p>
<p>son of the Thai Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS, participated in Abbott&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>annual shareholders meeting in order to act as proxies for the shareholders from 
</p>
<p>religious groups and to question the unethical actions of Abbott. They used the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to speak directly to Abbott executives, demanding that drugs not be 
</p>
<p>used as political leverage and patients not be used as political hostages.
</p>
<p> The student group Universities Allied for Essential Medicines and the Student 
</p>
<p>Global AIDS Campaign sought to add pressure from a new direction. One of the 
</p>
<p>drugs that Abbott was using as a bargaining chip had in fact been developed at the 
</p>
<p>University of Wisconsin at Madison. Outraged that a medicine developed by their 
</p>
<p>institution to better the lives of patients around the world was being used in so 
</p>
<p>manipulative a fashion, former and present students sent a letter demanding that 
</p>
<p>the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation condemn Abbott&rsquo;s action.
</p>
<p> Thereafter, the sentiment that Abbott&rsquo;s actions were unacceptable reverber-
</p>
<p>ated around the world. A critical turning point arose when religious groups holding 
</p>
<p>Abbott&rsquo;s shares condemned the company and called on it to end their action and 
</p>
<p>reregister the drugs in question.
</p>
<p> Finally, Abbott sought to redeem itself or to reduce the pressure and improve 
</p>
<p>its image by establishing a three-tier price structure for Kaletra worldwide. The 
</p>
<p>price for middle-income developing countries would drop from (US) $2,200 per 
</p>
<p>patient per year to $1,000 per patient per year. But this reduced price would be 
</p>
<p>available in Thailand only if no compulsory license was imposed on the new heat-
</p>
<p>stable form of lopinavir/ritonavir, Aluvia.
</p>
<p> Thai civil-society groups led by the Foundation for Consumers, the AIDS 
</p>
<p>ACCESS Foundation, the Thai Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS, and the 
</p>
<p>Thai NGO Coalition on AIDS tried a new tactic: invoking Thai law on commercial 
</p>
<p>competition to attack Abbot&rsquo;s decision to withdraw its pending drug registrations. 
</p>
<p>It appealed to the Thai Competition Commission, arguing that Abbott&rsquo;s actions 
</p>
<p>violate Sections 25 (3) and 28 of the Competition Act, B.E. 2542 (1999), because 
</p>
<p>the company was a business operator with market domination and was using that 
</p>
<p>dominant position to act in an anticompetitive fashion by unreasonably cancelling 
</p>
<p>imports, leading to a decrease in the available choice of drugs to the point where 
</p>
<p>patients&rsquo; needs could not be met. The Competition Commission was thus urged, 
</p>
<p>under Section 31 of the act, to order Abbott Laboratories to apply for registration 
</p>
<p>of its new drugs and resubmit applications for the ten withdrawn drug registra-
</p>
<p>tions in Thailand.

</p>
<p>have not been limited to the national level. One positive side effect has been the 
</p>
<p>emergence of solidarity in a global community. A couple of months after the Thai 
</p>
<p>compulsory license on efavirenz was issued, the Brazilian government issued one 
</p>
<p>for the same drug.
</p>
<p> In November 2007, about two hundred experts, social activists, and representa-
</p>
<p>tives of patient networks from all over the world gathered in Bangkok to discuss 
</p>
<p>compulsory licensing, innovation, and access to medicines for all. They launched 
</p>
<p>the Bangkok Declaration on Compulsory Licensing, Innovation, and Access to 
</p>
<p>Medicines for All. The declaration recognized and applauded Thailand&rsquo;s leadership 
</p>
<p>in the use of compulsory licensing to overcome legal monopolies, praised decisions 
</p>
<p>by Brazil and Indonesia to issue compulsory licenses, and encouraged other coun-
</p>
<p>tries to exercise their rights to do so, too. They also proposed a new global network 
</p>
<p>on compulsory licensing, innovation, and access for all that links together patients, 
</p>
<p>NGOs, academic and public health experts, government officials, and manufactur-
</p>
<p>ers of generic drugs to find ways to ensure that patients have access to medicines 
</p>
<p>with acceptable quality and price.
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>Every country should have the right to use compulsory licensing systematically 
</p>
<p>and routinely, as well as other means available to them under the TRIPS flex-
</p>
<p>ibilities. Governments all over the world use compulsory licensing in a variety of 
</p>
<p>contexts and in many different fields, and the right to use compulsory licensing 
</p>
<p>is incorporated in international law and precedent, including the WTO&rsquo;s TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement and the Doha Declaration. But when developing countries such as 
</p>
<p>Thailand try to exercise their right to use compulsory licensing for essential drugs 
</p>
<p>in order to solve the health problems, they face significant obstacles from the mul-
</p>
<p>tinational drug companies and politicians.
</p>
<p> The mechanism of compulsory licensing is powerful, but as the example of 
</p>
<p>Thailand shows, it can be hard to implement in developing countries. However, as 
</p>
<p>we have seen, pressure from interested parties, such as patients groups, academ-
</p>
<p>ics, and politicians, can make it possible to do so. The difficulties involved in that 
</p>
<p>process and the obstacles that powerful opponents can throw in the way of its 
</p>
<p>successful completion nevertheless make it important to consider alternatives to 
</p>
<p>the increase of intellectual property protection as ways to promote and guarantee 
</p>
<p>medical research and development without contravening access to medicines.

<p> notes
</p>
<p>1 Several compulsory-licensing options exist in the TRIPS Agreement. Compulsory licensing 
</p>
<p>can be applied in order to remedy anticompetitive practices or to address public needs in a 
</p>
<p>wide range of situations, including when the patent is not used or when products are over-
</p>
<p>priced. Prior negotiations with the patentee are required. Another form of compulsory licens-
</p>
<p>ing is government use, which can occur without the prior consent of the patentee in exchange 
</p>
<p>for remuneration and with the obligation to inform the patentee immediately after issuance. 
</p>
<p>There are three conditions under which the government-use provision can be employed: a 
</p>
<p>national emergency, a situation of urgency, and for public, noncommercial use. Article 51 of 
</p>
<p>the Thai Patent Act applies to public, noncommercial use, whereas Article 52 applies in cases 
</p>
<p>of national emergency or situations of urgency.
</p>
<p>2 Nonindustrial countries, depending on their level of development and on whether they were 
</p>
<p>already protecting pharmaceutical products with patents, could wait until 2000, 2005, or 
</p>
<p>2006. At the WTO conference in Doha in 2001, it was decided that least-developed countries 
</p>
<p>that were not protecting pharmaceutical products prior to the ratification of TRIPS could wait 
</p>
<p>until 2016.

</p>
<p>One of the points of convergence among the many strands of the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>is resistance to the one-size-fits-all ratcheting up of intellectual property provi-
</p>
<p>sions around the world. The resistance is grounded in analysis showing that intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rules often create social costs that far outweigh their intended 
</p>
<p>benefits. Much of the A2K movement&rsquo;s advocacy for limitations of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights is located within the field of intellectual property law&mdash;promoting 
</p>
<p>the inclusion and use of balancing mechanisms within the laws granting intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights. But intellectual property rights are also shaped and limited by 
</p>
<p>their interaction with other fields of law, competition law being a prime example.
</p>
<p> Competition laws, often referred to as &ldquo;antimonopoly&rdquo; or &ldquo;antitrust&rdquo; laws, 
</p>
<p>regulate the conduct of firms that face insufficient competition and thereby have 
</p>
<p>the power to raise prices charged to consumers. Intellectual property laws, on the 
</p>
<p>other hand, grant rights to exclude competition from the subject matter of the 
</p>
<p>intellectual property right to create incentives to invent and produce new products 
</p>
<p>for consumers. The rights to exclude competition that are at the core of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights may create the ability to engage in anticompetitive conduct of 
</p>
<p>the kind normally regulated by competition laws. In such instances, policy makers 
</p>
<p>and enforcement agencies are called upon to determine the extent of interaction 
</p>
<p>between the two legal regimes. This determination plays a central role in defining 
</p>
<p>the limit of intellectual property rights and thus is an important site of legal advo-
</p>
<p>cacy for access-to-knowledge movements.
</p>
<p> The argument of what follows is that competition law can and should be used 
</p>
<p>to promote the goals of access to knowledge. It is a common misconception that  
</p>
<p>competition laws and intellectual property laws are in irreconcilable conflict, 
</p>
<p>necessitating blanket exclusions of intellectual property from competition-law reg-
</p>
<p>ulation. Competition and intellectual property laws serve similar ends: increasing

</p>
<p>economic productivity and access to new goods. It is only when intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty protections fail to serve the end of net increases in economic productivity, for 
</p>
<p>example by creating more barriers to access to current technology and production 
</p>
<p>than they create incentives for additional innovation and creation, that competi-
</p>
<p>tion law justifiably limits intellectual property rights. In such cases, there is a long 
</p>
<p>history in the United States and other countries of using competition law, includ-
</p>
<p>ing enforcing duties to share access with potential competitors, to limit consumer 
</p>
<p>harm from excesses practiced by holders of intellectual property rights and other 
</p>
<p>property holders. A key example is when intellectual property rights in developing 
</p>
<p>countries prohibit competition in the supply of goods such as essential medicines 
</p>
<p>or access to information essential to the social or economic development of a coun-
</p>
<p>try. In such instances, profit-maximizing actions taken by the holders of exclusive 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights will cause far more consumer harm through restricted 
</p>
<p>access than they benefit consumers in the form of incentives for future innovation.

<p>using competition law 453
</p>
<p> A2K advocates are using competition law to limit the scope of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights, including in cases that lay the groundwork for implementing a 
</p>
<p>more robust theory of intellectual property. Their work is shifting the question of 
</p>
<p>whether competition law can limit intellectual property rights to when competi-
</p>
<p>tion law should regulate intellectual property, making it possible to recognize a 
</p>
<p>new category of &ldquo;essential intellectual property&rdquo; for which open-licensing duties 
</p>
<p>should be frequently required. After describing the theoretical and doctrinal 
</p>
<p>underpinnings of this shift of A2K legal advocacy toward the use of completion 
</p>
<p>law, this part surveys some of the strategic advantages of using competition norms 
</p>
<p>to reframe political debates and shift struggles into new, potentially more hospi-
</p>
<p>table, forums.
</p>
<p>the intellectual property/competition interface
</p>
<p>On the surface, the misconception that intellectual property and competition laws 
</p>
<p>are locked in interminable conflict seems plausible. Intellectual property laws 
</p>
<p>grant rights to exclude competition with the rights holder to create incentives and 
</p>
<p>rewards for innovation, including through higher prices to consumers. Competition 
</p>
<p>laws prohibit anticompetitive conduct that creates or abuses a lack of competition 
</p>
<p>in the market to the detriment of consumer interests. Taken at this superficial level, 
</p>
<p>every act to obtain and profit from an intellectual property right could be con-
</p>
<p>strued as an act of monopolization in violation of competition law mandates. How-
</p>
<p>ever, this view of competition and intellectual property laws has been rejected by 
</p>
<p>courts and enforcement agencies in the United States, Europe, and other countries. 
</p>
<p>In such jurisdictions, competition law is used, explicitly or implicitly, as a policy 
</p>
<p>tool to restrict the scope of intellectual property rights without negating them.
</p>
<p> Modern competition statutes regulating the use and abuse of monopoly power 
</p>
<p>are of fairly recent vintage, the first such statute being the U.S. Sherman Act of 
</p>
<p>1890.1 But the history of circumscribing grants of monopoly privileges with social 
</p>
<p>duties that restrain excessive pricing and other abuses dates back much further.
</p>
<p> When King Edward&rsquo;s quo warranto campaign in the thirteenth century first 
</p>
<p>required a &ldquo;letter patent&rdquo; as proof of a valid exclusive marketing franchise,2 a 
</p>
<p>central purpose was to regulate those who &ldquo;take outrageous Toll, contrary to the 
</p>
<p>common Custom of the Realm.&rdquo;3 Complaints of excessive pricing and other vio-
</p>
<p>lations of a duty of &ldquo;reasonable use&rdquo; could be brought before the king&rsquo;s courts 
</p>
<p>and were grounds for forfeiture of the franchise. Duties to serve public interests 
</p>
<p>were included in the patent grants themselves, which &ldquo;often required the patentee 
</p>
<p>to produce goods of a certain quality and sell them within certain price limits.&rdquo;4 
</p>
<p>The seventeenth-century Statute of Monopolies authorizing letters patent for new </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>454
</p>
<p>inventions, but banning most other franchises, stated the condition that &ldquo;they be 
</p>
<p>not contrary to the Laws nor mischievous to the State, by raising the prices of 
</p>
<p>Commodities at home.&rdquo;5
</p>
<p> In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, duties for patent holders 
</p>
<p>to serve the greater public interest took various forms. The Paris Convention for 
</p>
<p>the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883, the first major international treaty 
</p>
<p>on patent standards, instructed that &ldquo;the patentee shall remain bound to work his 
</p>
<p>patent in conformity with the laws of the country into which he introduces the 
</p>
<p>patented objects.&rdquo;6 Many countries included within their patent laws general pub-
</p>
<p>lic-interest grounds for compulsory licensing when a patentee has failed to meet 
</p>
<p>the country&rsquo;s demand for the particular item on &ldquo;reasonable terms.&rdquo; The United 
</p>
<p>States was different in this regard. Unlike most other countries, it does not have 
</p>
<p>a general public-interest compulsory license standard. Public-interest grounds for 
</p>
<p>compulsory licensing and for otherwise limiting the scope of exclusive intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights instead have been developed in major part through the then 
</p>
<p>uniquely American institution of competition law.
</p>
<p> For the first decades after the U.S. Congress passed the Sherman Act of 1890, 
</p>
<p>courts largely interpreted it as placing little restraint on the practices of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property holders. It was commonly considered that the right to exclude oth-
</p>
<p>ers from use of a creation included a right to refuse to license the technology to 
</p>
<p>others and a correlative right to impose unlimited restrictions on the licenses that 
</p>
<p>the holder chose to issue. It was common, for example, for patent and copyright 
</p>
<p>holders to impose minimum price requirements and resale restrictions in intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property licenses. Over time, this reasoning lost favor, and a large number of 
</p>
<p>restrictive licensing practices, including minimum-pricing and resale restrictions, 
</p>
<p>tying patent licenses to purchases of other products, and charging royalties not 
</p>
<p>strictly related to the use of the patented technology, were deemed to be beyond 
</p>
<p>the scope of the patent grant and prohibited by competition law.7 The reach of 
</p>
<p>antitrust law in this area is commonly said to have peaked in the 1970s with U.S. 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies&rsquo; use of a &ldquo;Nine No-No&rsquo;s&rdquo; list of intellectual property licens-
</p>
<p>ing practices deemed to be per se illegal.8
</p>
<p> Courts often frame the legal analysis as discovering a core of intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights immune from competition law scrutiny, with the right to exclude others 
</p>
<p>through refusals to license often considered the heart of the core, surrounded by 
</p>
<p>a periphery of restrictive licensing practices regulated by competition law. Courts 
</p>
<p>thus answer the question of whether a particular restrictive practice is prohibited 
</p>
<p>by examining whether it is within the &ldquo;scope of the patent&rdquo;9 and contributes to the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;reward which the patentee by the grant of the patent is entitled to secure&rdquo;10 or is 
</p>
<p>outside the scope of the grant and by its &ldquo;very nature illegal.&rdquo;11
</p>
<p>flynn </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>455
</p>
<p> The line between core and periphery has shifted dramatically over time, and 
</p>
<p>several recent cases in the U.S. and Europe have discarded much of the core/
</p>
<p>periphery analysis altogether. Some recent cases use use instead competition doc-
</p>
<p>trines to force the sharing of intellectual property in particular cases. These cases 
</p>
<p>in effect transform the core of intellectual property rights from a right to exclude 
</p>
<p>to a liability rule giving the rights holder compensation for use by others.
</p>
<p> The genealogy of duties to license leads back to doctrines in real property law. 
</p>
<p>The right to exclude others from the use of real property has long been considered 
</p>
<p>the core of the property right. But competition law has nevertheless been used to 
</p>
<p>invade that core in a number of special circumstances. In a series of cases deal-
</p>
<p>ing with the ownership of unique infrastructure resources that are necessary to 
</p>
<p>enable competition, from the only bridge across a river,12 to electricity and tele-
</p>
<p>phone wires needed to promote utility service competition,13 U.S. courts have 
</p>
<p>propounded what has become known as the &ldquo;essential facilities doctrine.&rdquo; This 
</p>
<p>doctrine orders companies to share &ldquo;access to their unique facilities, even to com-
</p>
<p>petitors, on a nondiscriminatory basis where sharing is feasible and the competi-
</p>
<p>tors cannot obtain or create the facility on their own.&rdquo;14 U.S. and European courts 
</p>
<p>have begun applying this doctrine to refusals of intellectual property owners to 
</p>
<p>license their rights in special cases.
</p>
<p> In the United States, the application of competition law standards to force the 
</p>
<p>licensing of important intellectual property is highly controversial. However, the  
</p>
<p>former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, a primary competition law 
</p>
<p>enforcement body, has argued that U.S. antitrust law can and should impose anti-
</p>
<p>trust liability for a monopolist&rsquo;s refusal to licence intellectual property, just &ldquo;as with 
</p>
<p>any other kind of property, tangible or intangible .  . . shown to constitute an essen-
</p>
<p>tial facility.&rdquo;15 And a small number of courts have concluded that a refusal to license 
</p>
<p>intellectual property may violate antitrust law where the refusal does not suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently serve the purposes of intellectual property law in promoting new creation or 
</p>
<p>innovation.16 Yet an important appellate court for patent law questions has held that 
</p>
<p>such theories may not be pursued and that courts instead are restricted to regulating 
</p>
<p>practices that lie outside of the core right to exclude granted by the patent.17
</p>
<p> By contrast, legal limits on the refusal to license in intellectual property mat-
</p>
<p>ters are relatively well established in Europe. In one lead case, referred to as 
</p>
<p>Magill,18 three television broadcasters held copyrights on their respective listings 
</p>
<p>for broadcasts in Ireland and refused to give permission for any firm to produce a 
</p>

</p>
<p>the refusal to license, holding that the exclusion justified compulsory licensing 
</p>
<p>because it prevented &ldquo;the appearance of a new product . . . which the appellants did 
</p>
<p>not offer and for which there was a potential consumer demand.&rdquo;19 In another lead

</p>
<p>case, European courts ordered compulsory licensing of a copyrighted data tool that 
</p>
<p>had become an industry standard and that prevented any other firm from compet-

</p>
<p>applying competition law to intellectual property issues
</p>
<p>Although many courts and commentators continue to engage in core/periphery 
</p>
<p>thinking and attempt to define sets of practices inside and outside the central 
</p>
<p>scope of the patent, the shifting boundaries between core and periphery over time 
</p>
<p>and between countries expose the policy-laden nature of the task. Competition 
</p>
<p>law can be used to limit intellectual property rights, including invading the core 
</p>
<p>of the rights and prohibiting refusals to license others. Thus, the key question for 
</p>
<p>policy advocates and enforcement officials is when competition law should limit 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p> Many modern experts seek to answer the question of when competition 
</p>
<p>law should restrict intellectual property rights by means of an explicit balanc-
</p>
<p>ing of the costs and benefits of a particular practice. An influential article by 
</p>
<p>Harvard Law School professor Louis Kaplow, for example, argues that enforce-
</p>
<p>ment officials should determine whether to use competition law to regulate 
</p>
<p>a particular practice by reference to the net benefit or harm to society that the 
</p>
<p>restrictive practice is causing.21 According to this line of thinking, the social ben-
</p>
<p>efit of allowing intellectual property holders to engage in restrictive practices is 
</p>
<p>that by raising their ability to profit from the intellectual property, the restric-
</p>
<p>tive practices may increase incentives to innovate and create new products for 
</p>
<p>future consumers. The costs of a restrictive practice may be decreased access to 
</p>
<p>the existing technology, as well as other dynamic costs from limiting the diffu-
</p>
<p>sion of information and erecting barriers to follow-on innovation. The lead-
</p>
<p>ing treatise on intellectual property law and competition in the United States 
</p>
<p>similarly describes the question as calling for &ldquo;balancing the social benefit of 
</p>
<p>providing economic incentives for creation and the costs of limiting diffusion  
</p>
<p>of knowledge.&rdquo;22
</p>
<p> In the period before implementation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
</p>
<p>agreements, including the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
</p>
<p>(TRIPS) Agreement imposing minimum standards on intellectual property laws 
</p>
<p>and terms, countries could respond to a situation where the costs of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property restrictions far exceeded their benefits by shortening the term of years 
</p>
<p>when the restrictions on intellectual property rights could be exploited or by doing 
</p>
<p>away with intellectual property in the particular field of technology. Those options 
</p>
<p>are no longer available to WTO members, who must grant intellectual property 
</p>
<p>flynn </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>457
</p>
<p>rights in all industries, without discrimination and for minimum terms. But under 
</p>
<p>TRIPS, countries may accomplish the same effects by using competition law to 
</p>
<p>reduce the scope of restrictive practices that may be engaged in during the period. 
</p>
<p>By allowing the use of competition mandates, TRIPS offers countries considerable 
</p>
<p>flexibility to adjust both the costs and the benefits of intellectual property restric-
</p>
<p>tions.23 The two policy tools are interrelated: &ldquo;The amount of reward provided and 
</p>
<p>the monopoly loss arising in each additional year in which exploitation is permit-
</p>
<p>ted (and thus the appropriate length of patent life) depend on what practices pat-
</p>
<p>entees may employ during that time period.&rdquo;24
</p>
<p> Using cost-benefit balancing tests, the interface of competition and intellectual 
</p>
<p>property law in a country generally or for a particular industry or practice can be 
</p>
<p>charted along a spectrum. At one end, the most dominant competition laws invade 
</p>
<p>the core of intellectual property rights with enforceable duties to license competi-
</p>
<p>tors under the &ldquo;essential facility&rdquo; and related doctrines. At the other end, the most 
</p>
<p>dominant intellectual property rights grant owners nearly total exemption from 
</p>
<p>competition mandates. If restrictive practices cause particularly egregious social 
</p>
<p>harm while creating relatively slight increases in reward to the intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights holder, then an expansion of the realm of competition law in restrict-
</p>
<p>ing intellectual property rights is a WTO-compliant policy measure justified by 
</p>
<p>the purposes of each doctrine. As described below, economic analysis suggests 
</p>
<p>that the application of intellectual property law to essential goods and services in 
</p>
<p>developing countries with high income inequality is just such a situation.25
</p>
<p>the economics of exclusion
</p>
<p>Just as there are public and consumer interests served by the recognition in com-
</p>
<p>petition law of the existence of &ldquo;essential facilities&rdquo; and the attendant doctrine 
</p>
<p>requiring the sharing of some real property among competitors, public interests 
</p>
<p>can be served by the recognition of the existence of what may be called &ldquo;essential 
</p>
<p>intellectual property&rdquo; for which enforcement of exclusionary rights demonstrably 
</p>
<p>and predictably causes far more social harm that it creates benefits. The fact that 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights are granted for essential goods and services in a highly 
</p>
<p>unequal society is a key example of intellectual property becoming essential in 
</p>
<p>this regard. In such a situation, as described more fully below, the legal right cre-
</p>
<p>ates rational economic incentives to price the vast majority of consumers out of 
</p>
<p>access. This lack of access, in turn, creates demonstrable losses to society that far 
</p>
<p>exceed the minimal incentives to innovate that the owner of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>receives for engaging in the socially harmful activity. Using the basic policy bal-
</p>
<p>ance between costs and benefits articulated by modern commentators, it becomes 
</p>
<p>using competition law</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>458
</p>
<p>eminently justifiable to apply the strongest competition law and other duties to 
</p>
<p>share such essential intellectual property.
</p>
<p> Monopoly economics teaches that profit-maximizing monopolists will serve 
</p>
<p>a smaller segment of the consumer population (limiting output) at a higher price 
</p>
<p>than would be the case under a competitive market. Absent some form of govern-
</p>
<p>ment price regulation or threat of entry by competitors, the only restraint on the 
</p>
<p>monopoly&rsquo;s pricing will be a function of the willingness and ability of consumers 
</p>
<p>to pay higher prices. The rational monopolist will keep raising prices until so many 
</p>
<p>people cannot or will not pay the price that the loss of consumers eats into the 
</p>
<p>firm&rsquo;s aggregate profits.
</p>
<p> Economists illustrate the effect of consumer demand choices on monopolist 
</p>
<p>pricing behavior through the shape and slope of a demand curve. A flat horizontal 
</p>
<p>demand curve (see figure 1) would indicate that the seller has no discretion to raise 
</p>
<p>prices. A small price increase would lead to all consumers foregoing purchases. 
</p>
<p>Take, for example, a commodity such as wheat being sold at an exchange with a 
</p>
<p>nearly infinite number of buyers and sellers. In such a market, the demand curve 
</p>
<p>will be essentially flat&mdash;a small raise in price by a seller would result in all buyers 
</p>
<p>shifting to another seller. Nearly flat demand curves also result when there is very 
</p>
<p>limited discretionary income in a market, so that a small price increase will exclude 
</p>
<p>all buyers from the market.
</p>
<p> A vertical demand curve would yield no restraint on prices at all, referred 
</p>
<p>to as a perfectly inelastic market (see figure 2). Consumers will purchase the 
</p>
<p>amount of goods they require, regardless of the price set. Necessities without 
</p>
<p>substitutes, such as utilities, food staples, and fuel, tend to be very inelastic, at 
</p>
<p>least in the short run. One real-world example is the behavior of some electric-
</p>
<p>ity markets in the U.S. during the so-called &ldquo;Enron scandal.&rdquo; The problem with 
</p>
<p>markets that Enron and other companies exploited was that at certain times when 
</p>
<p>energy demand is particularly high (for example, hot days in the summer), demand 
</p>
<p>reaches the limits of supply, but cannot decrease on a short-term basis. The elec-
</p>
<p>tricity producers thus achieve nearly absolute market power&mdash;they can charge any 
</p>
<p>price they want without demand decreasing. During some of these crises, there 
</p>
<p>were reports of electricity sales that cost $35 per unit the day or hour before spik-
</p>
<p>ing up past $10,000 per unit.26
</p>
<p> Demand curves have a shape, as well as a slope. The shape of the curve is affected 
</p>
<p>by how different consumers react to a price increase. If there is a large group of con-
</p>
<p>sumers that is very price sensitive and another group that is very price insensitive, 
</p>
<p>then the curve will have a convex character, with part of it approaching vertical and 
</p>
<p>another part nearly horizontal. This, too, will affect pricing behavior. If the number 
</p>
<p>of consumers in the steeper section of the curve is large enough and willing to pay 
</p>
<p>flynn </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>459
</p>
<p>high enough prices, then the monopolist may make more money by serving only 
</p>
<p>that segment of the population than by serving all of the potential demand.
</p>
<p> If a monopoly-provided good is an essential product with no substitutes, peo-
</p>
<p>ple will be willing to pay a very high portion of their income to enjoy access to 
</p>
<p>it. Thus, the real restraint on pricing will be a function of ability to pay. This, in 
</p>
<p>turn, means that the shape and slope of the demand curve will be a function of 
</p>
<p>how income is distributed in a given society. In countries with very high income 
</p>
<p>inequality, with a small number of superrich people living on First World incomes 
</p>
<p>and a large number of superpoor people with very little discretionary income, the 
</p>
<p>demand curve will be highly convex. And this will predictably lead to the monopo-
</p>
<p>list pricing to the nearly vertical section of the curve, where large price increases 
</p>
<p>can be implemented with very little additional loss of sales.

<p> Consider the case of South Africa, a country among the worst in terms of 
</p>
<p>income inequality. Figure 3 is a demand curve constructed according to the 
</p>
<p>assumption that people needing AIDS treatment in South Africa will purchase 
</p>
<p>an antiretroviral if the cost is 5 percent of their income. If a firm prices its anti-
</p>
<p>retroviral at $1,481 per patient per year, 100,000 people in the top income decile 
</p>
<p>will buy it. In order to sell to a greater proportion of the population, the price 
</p>
<p>must fall considerably&mdash;200,000 people with HIV/AIDS will buy the medi-
</p>
<p>cine if it is priced at $396, and half of the people in need of treatment can 
</p>
<p>purchase an antiretroviral if it is priced at $92. In order to sell to all people 
</p>
<p>with HIV/AIDS who need treatment, the price would have to be lowered to  
</p>
<p>$18 per patient per year. 27

</p>
<p>the demand curve. The firm maximizes its sales in South Africa by selling at the 
</p>
<p>price that only the top 10 percent can afford. If the firm lowers its price to what 20 
</p>
<p>percent can afford ($396), it will sell twice as many at a price far less than half the 
</p>
<p>profit-maximizing price, earning substantially less ($79.2 million compared with 
</p>
<p>$148.1 million in total revenue). If the monopoly firm continues to cut prices to 
</p>
<p>raise sales volume, revenues fall further. In other words, at this level of wealth 
</p>
<p>inequality in a society, the firm maximizes profit by setting a price that at least 90 
</p>
<p>percent of people in need cannot afford.
</p>
<p> To understand the effect that inequality in income distribution has on the pric-
</p>
<p>ing and output decisions of a monopolist, compare the South African case with 
</p>
<p>that of Norway, which has one of the most equitable income distributions.28 Here, 
</p>
<p>the demand curve would be much flatter, as shown in figure 5.

</p>
<p> As shown in figure 6, under the same assumptions as the South Africa case 
</p>
<p>above, that is, that a person will buy the essential product at 5 percent of income, 
</p>
<p>the firm makes more money in Norway by selling more products at lower prices at 
</p>
<p>each step along the income distribution until the firm serves between 80 percent 
</p>
<p>and 90 percent of the population.
</p>
<p> The lesson is this: The more unequal the distribution of income is in a country, 
</p>
<p>the more people will be excluded from the market (what economists call &ldquo;dead-
</p>
<p>weight loss&rdquo;) when a monopoly practices profit-maximizing pricing strategies for 
</p>
<p>an essential good. At the same time, because sales in such a country are likely to 
</p>
<p>be so few (making sales only to the very top income earners), the monopoly does 
</p>
<p>not enjoy very high levels of overall profits. In other words, in countries with high 
</p>
<p>income inequality, unrestrained monopoly pricing of essential goods is very likely 
</p>
<p>to cause large social harms and comparatively small incentives to invest in innova-
</p>
<p>tive activities. In this context, it becomes an incredibly persuasive economic argu-
</p>
<p>ment that whatever duties to promote competition and restrain monopoly pricing 
</p>
<p>power exist, they should have their strongest application.
</p>
<p>post-trips competition law advocacy by the a2k movement
</p>
<p>In September 2002, the access-to-medicines movement took a decisive turn when, 
</p>
<p>in South Africa, A2K advocates began to use competition law to advance their 
</p>
<p>cause. South Africa&rsquo;s Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) shifted the focus of its 
</p>
<p>advocacy for access to medicines to the South African Competition Commission. 
</p>
<p>At the time, TAC and other access campaigners around the world were working 
</p>
<p>to increase access to an important first-line AIDS drug regime commonly used 
</p>
<p>in developing countries at that time. The cocktail&mdash;composed of the drugs AZT 
</p>
<p>and 3TC, both patented by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and Nevirapine, patented by 
</p>
<p>Boehringer Ingelheim (BI)&mdash;was being priced in the late 1990s in South Africa and 
</p>
<p>around the world for over $10,000 per patient per year. That price was about three 
</p>
<p>times the GDP per capita in South Africa. By the time of the complaint, prices in 
</p>
<p>South Africa had fallen to about $3,000 a year for the same cocktail, compared 
</p>
<p>with under $300 a year for generic versions from Indian firms. Indian companies 
</p>
<p>also produced the medicines in a single-pill format, which was unavailable from 
</p>
<p>the patent holders.
</p>
<p> There had been previous requests for licenses by Indian pharmaceutical pro-
</p>
<p>ducer Cipla and from the medical services NGO M&eacute;dicins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), 
</p>
<p>both of which were rejected by the companies. BI admitted in documents filed in 
</p>
<p>the South African Competition Commission that it had a general policy to refuse 
</p>
<p>licenses for the generic supply of its products. The health minister had authority 
</p>
<p>flynn </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>463
</p>
<p>to issue authorizations for the use of generic versions of patented medicines for 
</p>
<p>public-health purposes, but the Department of Health refused requests to use the 
</p>
<p>law, leaving TAC searching for a new forum in which to bring its advocacy.
</p>
<p> The complaint filed by TAC with the Competition Commission in 2002 alleged 
</p>
<p>that the use of the patents by multinational pharmaceutical companies to demand 
</p>
<p>prices that only a sliver of South Africa&rsquo;s population could afford violated section 
</p>
<p>8(a) of the South African Competition Act, which states that it is prohibited for 
</p>
<p>a dominant firm to charge an &ldquo;excessive price,&rdquo; defined as a price that is higher 
</p>
<p>than the &ldquo;reasonable economic value&rdquo; of the good and that is to the detriment 
</p>
<p>of consumers. In essence, this was a core/periphery complaint, asking the com-
</p>
<p>mission to leave the basic right of the company to refuse to license intact, but 
</p>
<p>defining a periphery of pricing excess that is beyond the scope of the patent 
</p>
<p>grant. A subsequent submission by the Consumer Project on Technology (CPTech) 
</p>
<p>(now known as Knowledge Ecology International) encouraged the commission to 
</p>
<p>adopt the concept of essential intellectual property. CPTech argued that whenever  
</p>
<p>&ldquo;(1) the number of people who need access to the medicines to prolong their life or 
</p>
<p>improve their health significantly exceeds those with access to the drug, and (2) a 
</p>
<p>substantial barrier to access is price,&rdquo; a legal burden &ldquo;shift[s] to the pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>company to prove that it has promoted competitive pricing by issuing licenses of 
</p>
<p>right to all qualified suppliers on reasonable terms.&rdquo;29
</p>
<p> In October 2003, the commission announced that it found three abuses of dom-
</p>
<p>inance under Article 8 of the Act: excessive pricing, refusing to give a competitor 
</p>
<p>access to an essential facility when it is economically feasible to do so, and engag-
</p>
<p>ing in exclusionary conduct if the anticompetitive effect of that act outweighs its 
</p>
<p>technological, efficiency, or other procompetitive gains. Menzi Simelane, commis-
</p>
<p>sioner at the Competition Commission, explained:
</p>
<p>Our investigation revealed that each of the firms has refused to license their patents 
</p>
<p>to generic manufacturers in return for a reasonable royalty. We believe that this is 
</p>
<p>feasible and that consumers will benefit from cheaper generic versions of the drugs 
</p>
<p>concerned. We further believe that granting licenses would provide for competition 
</p>
<p>between firms and their generic competitors.
</p>
<p> We will request the Tribunal to make an order authorising any person to exploit 
</p>
<p>the patents to market generic versions of the respondents patented medicines or 
</p>
<p>fixed dose combinations that require these patents, in return for the payment of a 
</p>
<p>reasonable royalty.30
</p>
<p> Soon after the Commission&rsquo;s announcement, the two pharmaceutical compa-
</p>
<p>nies settled the complaints through agreements requiring the issuance of multiple 
</p>
<p>licenses to South African and Indian generic producers who now supply dramatically 
</p>
<p>using competition law</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>464
</p>
<p>cheaper versions of the medications in South Africa, including in fixed dose combi-
</p>
<p>nations. The licenses also authorized exports to all of sub-Saharan Africa.
</p>
<p> Other access campaigns have used competition law to achieve other objectives. 
</p>
<p>In February 2007, Knowledge Ecology International filed a complaint in the U.S. 
</p>
<p>Federal Trade Commission alleging that Gilead Science Incorporated was illegally 
</p>
<p>using restrictive licensing policies, including banning licensees from serving some 
</p>
<p>countries and charging royalties for countries where it did not have patents.31 In 
</p>
<p>Thailand, treatment activists filed a competition complaint against Abbott Labora-
</p>
<p>tories for refusing to supply new drugs in the country to punish the government 
</p>
<p>for issuing a compulsory license on the AIDS drug Kaletra.32 In the West, com-
</p>
<p>petition-law cases were used successfully to open access to Microsoft&rsquo;s applica-
</p>
<p>tion programming interfaces for Internet browsers, and complaints have been filed 
</p>
<p>to open access to the digital-rights-management software used to prevent iTunes 
</p>
<p>music from being played on competing players.33
</p>
<p> In these and other cases, the A2K movement has used the forum and language 
</p>
<p>of competition law for strategic advantage. Some of these advantages exist regard-
</p>
<p>less of the end result of the complaint. Rhetorically, the move allows A2K cam-
</p>
<p>paigns to shift the dominant frame for analyzing the issue from one of the protec-
</p>
<p>tion of the intellectual property holder&rsquo;s &ldquo;rights&rdquo; to one of monopoly regulation. 
</p>
<p>Institutionally, competition law strategies allow the A2K movement to shift into 
</p>
<p>regimes with investigative resources and institutional cultures that are often wary 
</p>
<p>of barriers to competition. Doing so also is a way to alter the terms of the political 
</p>
<p>debate over access-to-knowledge issues.
</p>
<p>reframing political debate
</p>
<p>Research from the cognitive and social sciences shows us that people interpret 
</p>
<p>ideas and issues through existing frames and concepts that are culturally con-
</p>
<p>structed and historically situated. This research suggests that it is important for 
</p>
<p>policy advocates to focus on how people are thinking about a particular issue, 
</p>
<p>rather than attempting only to change the amount of information they are using to 
</p>
<p>reach conclusions. Social movements often engage in advocacy that reflects these 
</p>
<p>teachings by reframing issues, that is, by &ldquo;conscious, strategic efforts by groups 
</p>
<p>of people to fashion shared understandings of the world and of themselves that 
</p>
<p>legitimate and motivate collective action.&rdquo;34
</p>
<p> The communications strategies of the dominant intellectual property industries 
</p>
<p>show great attention to the importance of framing in their campaigns to ratchet up 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protection around the globe. As discussed above, historically, 
</p>
<p>patents and other intellectual property were viewed by the public and government 
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>465
</p>
<p>officials as a form of monopoly that needed to be regulated to prevent abuse and 
</p>
<p>to serve the greater public interest. The intellectual property industries very delib-
</p>
<p>eratively and strategically shifted this frame to one of &ldquo;property rights.&rdquo; Susan Sell 
</p>
<p>explains:
</p>
<p>The language of rights weighs in favor of the person claiming the right. The lan-
</p>
<p>guage of privilege weighs in favor of the person granting the privilege. By wrapping 
</p>
<p>themselves in the mantle of &ldquo;property rights,&rdquo; they suggested that the rights they 
</p>
<p>were claiming were somehow natural, unassailable and automatically deserved. 
</p>
<p>They were able to deploy &ldquo;rights talk&rdquo; effectively in part because they were operat-
</p>
<p>ing in a context in which property rights are revered. In that regard &ldquo;rights talk&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>resonated with broader American culture. . . . The advocates of highly protectionist 
</p>
<p>IP norms expressed indignation at those violating these &ldquo;rights&rdquo; and claimed that 
</p>
<p>so-called violators were &ldquo;pirates.&rdquo;35�
</p>
<p> Filing complaints in competition tribunals shifts the discourse back to the 
</p>
<p>monopoly frame, where consumers hold an advantage. While the language of rights 
</p>
<p>suggests deserving protection from state regulation, modern culture continues to 
</p>
<p>be highly distrustful of monopolies. The term is synonymous with exploitation and 
</p>
<p>abuse. Monopolies are entities to be regulated, not freed from state intervention.
</p>
<p> The use of competition forums to shift the framing of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>issues is evident in some of the A2K movement&rsquo;s advocacy documents and expla-
</p>
<p>nations of their strategies. In a statement on the day it filed complaints against 
</p>
<p>GSK and BI, Action for Southern Africa (ACTSA) explained that the TAC submis-
</p>
<p>sion showed that &ldquo;largely as a result . . . of monopoly abuse, the pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>industry remains the most profitable industry in the world&rdquo; and that &ldquo;GSK con-
</p>
<p>tinues to expand their profit margins by charging excessive prices for life-saving 
</p>
<p>medicines in markets in which many people living with HIV/AIDS [have] little or 
</p>
<p>no income.&rdquo;36� Similarly, one of TAC&rsquo;s attorneys explained that the use of a com-
</p>
<p>petition law strategy was selected in part because of a perceived &ldquo;need to revive 
</p>
<p>the public debate about patent abuse and profiteering,&rdquo;37 which the competition 
</p>
<p>forum enabled.� Using competition law is thus important not only for the potential 
</p>
<p>remedies one may achieve there, but because it helps a movement communicate to 
</p>
<p>the greater public about an issue.
</p>
<p> Another discursive advantage of using competition law is that it is punitive. 
</p>
<p>Other TRIPS flexibilities, for example a general public-interest license, are often 
</p>
<p>discretionary and do not necessarily brand the intellectual property holder as a 
</p>
<p>bad actor. Using competition laws shifts the inquiry from whether the government 
</p>
<p>should use its discretion to limit patent rents to whether the company deserves 
</p>
<p>punishment for its abusive actions.
</p>
<p>using competition law</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>466
</p>
<p> The importance of a punitive framework proved particularly evident in the 
</p>
<p>Thai case against Abbott Laboratories. In that case, Abbott withdrew drug-regis-
</p>
<p>tration applications for several drugs after the Thai government issued a compul-
</p>
<p>sory license to authorize generic purchases of one of Abbott&rsquo;s AIDS drugs. Abbot 
</p>
<p>claimed in the press that the Thai compulsory license was illegal. Health activists 
</p>
<p>responded with a competition complaint against Abbott for the withdrawal of 
</p>
<p>needed supplies for the Thai market, thus branding Abbott as the true illegal actor. 
</p>
<p>Treatment campaigner and law professor Brook Baker explained in The Nation 
</p>
<p>newspaper: &ldquo;Instead of Thailand breaking the law, it is Abbott that has engaged 
</p>
<p>in an unprecedented and probably illegal withdrawal from the Thai market, tak-
</p>
<p>ing seven important medicines, including a heat-stable form of Kaletra, out of the 
</p>
<p>drug registration process.&rdquo;38�
</p>
<p> Another framing advantage of competition proceedings is that they commonly 
</p>
<p>provide a calendar of proceedings around which media and advocacy events can be 
</p>
<p>staged. Unlike general public-interest licenses, which often lack set procedures or 
</p>
<p>precedents, competition procedures are normally defined by regulations with set 
</p>
<p>points for decision and input. The filing of a complaint, the filing of a response by 
</p>
<p>the companies, a public hearing, the decision by the agency, a formal complaint or 
</p>
<p>appeal to a tribunal, and so on, all become moments when public attention can be 
</p>
<p>brought to bear on the complaint and focused on the story of illegal action and abuse 
</p>
<p>told by activists. The proceedings may also produce documents and statements 
</p>
<p>through the investigation that can be obtained through freedom of information laws 
</p>
<p>and used in subsequent campaigns to explain industry dealings in the country.
</p>
<p>regime shifting into competition forums
</p>
<p>The concept of framing focuses on the strategic use of discourse to alter public per-
</p>
<p>ceptions of and reactions to an issue. By contrast, regime shifting, a concept from 
</p>
<p>political science and international relations, is a strategy that attempts to alter the 
</p>
<p>status quo ante by moving law-making initiatives and standard-setting activities 
</p>
<p>from one venue into another.39� Here, advocacy groups seek out forums that may 
</p>
<p>be more hospitable to their cause. Regime shifting and framing often go hand in 
</p>
<p>hand. One benefit of effectively reframing an issue is that it may open the pos-
</p>
<p>sibilities of action in new forums. Reframing intellectual property issues as trade 
</p>
<p>issues enabled the dominant intellectual property industries to shift the forum for 
</p>
<p>international intellectual property law-making initiatives from the World Intellec-
</p>
<p>tual Property Organization (WIPO) into the WTO. Access campaigners responded 
</p>
<p>by reframing pharmaceutical patents as a public-health issue, enabling the engage-
</p>
<p>ment of the World Health Organization (WHO) in intellectual property debates.

</p>
<p>Framing intellectual property as a monopoly-regulation issue opens the potential 
</p>
<p>for advocacy in competition law forums. These forums offer potential institutional 
</p>
<p>advantages in developing countries, where laws are new and undefined.
</p>
<p> The opportunities for competition law advocacy in the Global South arise 
</p>
<p>from the flip side of economic liberalization that is exporting intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty restrictions and deregulation to much of the developing world. Based on the 
</p>
<p>dominant Western model of liberalization, the &ldquo;free markets&rdquo; created by contract 
</p>
<p>and property rights and by deregulated industries are supposed to be regulated to 
</p>
<p>serve public interests primarily by competition law. Only a handful of developing 
</p>
<p>countries had such laws before 1990. In the decade between 1990 and 2000, the 
</p>
<p>same decade that witnessed the globalization of substantive intellectual property 
</p>
<p>laws through the TRIPS Agreement (1994), fifty countries (most of them develop-
</p>
<p>ing) added competition laws to their books. (See table 1.)
</p>
<p> Although competition law is rapidly globalizing, it is not doing so in a uniform 
</p>
<p>way. Unlike in intellectual property law, where binding minimum standards are 
</p>
<p>established by the TRIPS Agreement, in competition law, countries remain largely 
</p>
<p>free from any international obligation to draft, interpret, and enforce standards 
</p>
<p>in any particular manner. Indeed, although U.S. and European Union laws are the 
</p>
<p>obvious models for the substantive doctrines contained in most of the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>competition statutes, there are very noteworthy differences in the interpretive 
</p>
<p>norms and policies that animate the laws of many developing countries.
</p>
<p> Competition laws in developing countries often explicitly incorporate develop-
</p>
<p>mental objectives. For example, the South African Competition Act expresses the 
</p>
<p>intent to create a competitive economic environment &ldquo;focussed on development&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>in order to &ldquo;advance the social and economic welfare,&rdquo; &ldquo;to correct structural imbal-
</p>
<p>ances and past economic injustices,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to reduce the uneven development, 
</p>
<p>inequality and absolute poverty which is so prevalent in South Africa.&rdquo; The South 
</p>
<p>African Competition Commission found these norms persuasive in determining the 
</p>
<p>outcome of the complaint against GSK and BI, explaining: &ldquo;Indeed the very goals 
</p>
<p>of our Competition Act&mdash;promoting development, providing consumers with com-
</p>
<p>petitive prices and product choices, advancing social and economic welfare and 
</p>
<p>correcting structural imbalances&mdash;have been made difficult in this context by the 
</p>
<p>refusal of the respondents to license patents.&rdquo;40
</p>
<p> Injunctions to consider equity objectives in the interpretation and enforcement 
</p>
<p>of competition law may be heightened in countries that have adopted social and 
</p>
<p>economic rights in their constitutions. To take South Africa as an example again, 
</p>
<p>the constitution obligates the state to &ldquo;promote the achievement of equality&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;take reasonable legislative and other means&rdquo; to realize the rights of everyone 
</p>
<p>to access to health care. The constitution specifically delineates one key means of 
</p>
<p>using competition law</p>

</p>
<p>promoting these rights, enjoining every court and agency to &ldquo;promote the spirit, 
</p>
<p>purport and objects of the Bill of Rights&rdquo; whenever &ldquo;interpreting any legislation, 
</p>
<p>and when developing the common law.&rdquo; In the context of structural market prob-
</p>
<p>lems that create incentives for providers of essential goods to exclude the majority 
</p>
<p>of people in need from their products, promotion of the right to access to health 
</p>
<p>care and the achievement of equality may counsel for interpretations of competi-
</p>
<p>tion law favorable to access to intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p> Making use of competition commissions is another regime-shifting strategy 
</p>
<p>that is particularly well suited to promoting access to knowledge in developing 
</p>
<p>countries. One of the very helpful attributes of Western competition laws that has 
</p>
<p>been exported to many developing countries is the competition-advocacy agency. 
</p>
<p>The role of these agencies is to receive complaints from competitors and consum-
</p>
<p>ers about potentially illegal practices, to investigate them using professional staffs 
</p>
<p>and special legal authority (such as subpoena power), and to litigate complaints on 
</p>
<p>behalf of the consumers or the state, often in a specialized tribunal.
</p>
<p> In many countries, these agencies are relatively well funded. Aid programs 
</p>
<p>from the United States and Europe support the institutional capacity of competi-
</p>
<p>tion authorities as part of packages aimed at promoting the liberalization of econo-
</p>
<p>mies. The agencies often have the capacity to hire top lawyers, economists, and 
</p>
<p>other professionals. And because the laws themselves are often relatively new, 
</p>
<p>these staffs may not be too overburdened with work to do a professional job in 
</p>
<p>their investigations.
</p>
<p> The availability of an advocacy agency may enable an access campaign to 
</p>
<p>mount a highly technical legal campaign against a well-resourced intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty owner without the kind of legal war chest that such a battle would require 
</p>
<p>on their own. Resources must still be spent on convincing the agency to act and 
</p>
<p>on educating the agency about technical, medical, and intellectual property top-
</p>
<p>ics with which it may not be familiar. The mobilization of political resources may 
</p>
<p>also be necessary to convince leaders with influence over the agency to prod it to 
</p>
<p>act with sufficient determination. But where competition authorities are inclined 
</p>
<p>to act in the greater public interest, their professional lawyers and staff can be 
</p>
<p>extremely valuable additions to the resources of an access movement.
</p>
<p> Finally, the decisions of competition courts and commissions may have a last-
</p>
<p>ing precedential effect, altering the assumed background rules in the industry. This 
</p>
<p>is evident in South Africa. Where BI once openly proclaimed a policy of not licens-
</p>
<p>ing generic companies to provide its products, industry lawyers now counsel that 
</p>
<p>blanket refusals to license patents on AIDS drugs are legally suspect and open to 
</p>
<p>challenge.41 The precedent has similarly been relied upon by treatment activists, 
</p>
<p>including a subsequent complaint against the pharmaceutical giant Merck, alleging 
</p>
<p>using competition law</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>470
</p>
<p>that licenses granted for the AIDS drug efavirenz do not license the lowest-cost 
</p>
<p>suppliers and do not allow new fixed-dose combinations.42
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>Courts and agencies can and do use competition law to help strike the balance 
</p>
<p>between the aims of intellectual property laws to promote investment and innova-
</p>
<p>tion and competition law goals to maximize consumer welfare through competi-
</p>
<p>tive markets and lower prices. Where a developing country chooses to strike this 
</p>
<p>balance may&mdash;and should&mdash;differ markedly from how the balance is struck in the 
</p>
<p>Global North. Economic analysis suggests that rules should be drawn in develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries to much more heavily favor open access to intellectual property on 
</p>
<p>essential goods and services where the welfare implications of allowing exclusive 
</p>
<p>dealing appear enormous.
</p>
<p> No strategy is without risks, and there are significant risks to pursuing com-
</p>
<p>petition law strategies to open access to intellectual property. Many of the risks 
</p>
<p>involved with competition law strategies are the flip side of the benefits. The fact 
</p>
<p>that competition strategies can create legal precedents that will affect later cases 
</p>
<p>means that losses in this forum can have lasting negative repercussions. The inde-
</p>
<p>terminacy of law that provides opportunities for progressive legal movements also 
</p>
<p>provides a fluid medium within which industry lawyers can work. The institutional 
</p>
<p>structure of the dominant model of competition law, with a well-resourced advo-
</p>
<p>cacy agency as a gatekeeper to courts, may be a barrier to progressive use of the 
</p>
<p>law if it is staffed with conservative bureaucrats. Finally, the opportunities for 
</p>
<p>relying on Northern precedent should not be overstated: no Northern court has 
</p>
<p>held that essential drug patents are subject to open-licensing duties.
</p>
<p> The experiences in South Africa and other countries are showing that competi-
</p>
<p>tion agencies can be valuable sites for political struggle over how intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty will be regulated. Such sites offer many advantages for access communities 
</p>
<p>and should certainly be considered in any access campaign. But as with any site of 
</p>
<p>struggle, the likelihood of success will depend on contextual circumstances: who 
</p>
<p>will make the decision, what leverage movements have over the decision maker, 
</p>
<p>and how successfully tactics are executed to leverage ideological and political 
</p>
<p>power toward a favorable result.

<p>Open-Access	Publishing:	From	Principles	to	Practice
</p>
<p>Manon A. Ress
</p>
<p>The issues involved in providing access to knowledge are not new, and publish-
</p>
<p>ing historically has been an arena in which they have been most salient. Until the 
</p>
<p>seventeenth century, scholarly findings were usually published in rare and expen-
</p>
<p>sive books. Scholars would share their findings by mailing their papers to selected 
</p>
<p>individuals. However, beginning in 1665, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal 
</p>
<p>Society of London, first edited and published by the society&rsquo;s secretary, Henry Old-
</p>
<p>enburg, was published and in effect formalized and centralized the process of peer 
</p>
<p>review and scholarly publication.1 As is vividly described in Open and Shut?&mdash;
</p>
<p>Richard Poynder&rsquo;s blog on open access&mdash;the scholarly publishing system thus put 
</p>
<p>into place was apparently efficient enough to last for more than three centuries.2
</p>
<p> However, in the last thirty years, things have changed rapidly. There has been an 
</p>
<p>enormous growth in research being conducted at the global level, but access to this 
</p>
<p>knowledge increasingly has been restricted by the erection of substantial economic 
</p>
<p>barriers. As a result of the need for new, global publications, commercial publish-
</p>
<p>ing organizations have become interested in the market and have promoted and 
</p>
<p>launched more and more journals. These are for-profit organizations, unlike most 
</p>
<p>traditional learned societies and scholarly publishers. Scholars and libraries have 
</p>
<p>had no alternative&mdash;they have had to pay more and more for more subscriptions to 
</p>
<p>these new journals. And since the 1990s, when features such as on-line access have 
</p>
<p>been added, there has been additional cost for the publishers and their clients.
</p>
<p> One response to this increasing restriction of access to published knowledge 
</p>
<p>has been the rise of open-access electronic publishing. In what follows,using 
</p>
<p>practical examples from the recent creation of the open-access electronic journal 
</p>
<p>Knowledge Ecology Studies, I will examine both the value of open-access jour-
</p>
<p>nal publishing for the broader A2K movement and some of the challenges that 
</p>
<p>open-access journal publishing faces as it attempts to allow the unrestricted </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ress476
</p>
<p>participation of creative communities in electronic publishing. This essay is also 
</p>
<p>meant to be of use to A2K activists in designing and implementing editorial poli-
</p>
<p>cies and copyright policies and in dealing with technical questions when launch-
</p>
<p>ing an open journal. My intention here is not to provide legal or technical details 
</p>
<p>about open-access electronic publishing. Rather, I want to focus on the strategic 
</p>
<p>significance for knowledge activists of advancing open access from principles to 
</p>
<p>practice in developing and developed countries.
</p>
<p> I begin by describing and explaining the essential principles of an open-access 
</p>
<p>electronic journal. I also examine the recent history of the A2K movement in the 
</p>
<p>context of such seminal open-access initiatives as the Budapest Open Access Ini-
</p>
<p>tiative, the Bethesda Statement, and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to 
</p>
<p>Knowledge in the Sciences and the Humanities. After describing the rationale for 
</p>
<p>the creation of an open-access journal dedicated to the multidisciplinary field of 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge, I describe and explain the policy decisions and issues that, 
</p>
<p>while informed by the principles of the movement, proved difficult to put into 
</p>
<p>practice: intellectual property policy, quality and peer review, funding and sustain-
</p>
<p>ability, and technical and editorial decisions. Finally, although the ongoing experi-
</p>
<p>ment that is Knowledge Ecology Studies is far from over, I draw some conclusions

<p>open-access publishing 477
</p>
<p>about the role and nature of an open-access journal within the growing access to 
</p>
<p>knowledge movement to gain a better understanding of the challenges ahead.
</p>
<p> The A2K movement includes participants as diverse as scholars, activists, pub-
</p>
<p>lishers, and government representatives. Academics&mdash;political scientists and soci-
</p>
<p>ologists, especially&mdash;may read the description of this experiment with the open-
</p>
<p>access journal from quite a different point of view from that of most activists, 
</p>
<p>publishers, authors, and readers involved in this project today. Open access has 
</p>
<p>been a way for scientific communities to regain some control over their work,3 
</p>
<p>but as each new technical innovation has created the possibility of lower-cost dis-
</p>
<p>tribution methods and new policies and practices concerning access and control, 
</p>
<p>the proliferation of possibilities has redefined open-access publishing in different 
</p>
<p>ways for different constituencies. One of my objectives here is to present the plu-
</p>
<p>rality and complexity of varying points of view as an essential component of the 
</p>
<p>shift in the A2K movement from principles to practice.
</p>
<p>principles
</p>
<p>Over the last thirty years, authors publishing in academic journals have routinely 
</p>
<p>been asked to assign their copyrights to publishers seeking exclusive distribution 
</p>
<p>rights. Publishers, in turn, have been able to set the price of subscriptions to what 
</p>
<p>the market (institutional libraries, mostly) can bear, and while there have been 
</p>
<p>more and more journals, their prices have steadily increased. Libraries&rsquo; budgets, 
</p>
<p>however, have decreased or at best have remained static, and funding the cost 
</p>
<p>of journals has eaten up an increasing percentage of them. University librarian 
</p>
<p>David W. Lewis states: &ldquo;Today the annual value of the peer-reviewed journal mar-
</p>
<p>ket is estimated at &pound;25 billion [$50 billion], and consists of 23,700 journals, which 
</p>
<p>between them publish 1.59 million articles a year.&rdquo; As he points out, if these jour-
</p>
<p>nals are too expensive for the developed world, one can imagine the access prob-
</p>
<p>lems faced by researchers and institutions in developing countries.4
</p>
<p> Clearly, the prices of scholarly journals have again become an obstacle to broad 
</p>
<p>access at a time when, paradoxically, new information technologies have expanded 
</p>
<p>the possibilities for information sharing. As Leslie Chan describes the situation:
</p>
<p>The scholarly communication crisis encompasses two distinct though interrelated 
</p>
<p>problems. On the one hand, serial-subscription costs, particularly for science and 
</p>
<p>medical journals, have been increasing rapidly over the last two decades, often at 
</p>
<p>rates far above the cost of inflation. At the same time, research-library budgets 
</p>
<p>have been decreasing or are otherwise unable to keep pace with price increases. The 
</p>
<p>result is that libraries are spending more, but they are in fact getting less, in terms </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>478
</p>
<p>of journal titles and new monograph acquisition, as more of the budget is being con-
</p>
<p>sumed by serial subscriptions.5
</p>
<p> This is what many describe as the &ldquo;affordability&rdquo; problem, which affects librar-
</p>
<p>ies and other research institutions in both developed and developing countries. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the cost to libraries is often passed on to the public, when it funds these 
</p>
<p>institutions. Therefore, the public at large has a significant stake in seeing that 
</p>
<p>essential scientific and scholarly research (often funded by governments) is made 
</p>
<p>more widely available without unnecessary costs or delays. And along with educa-
</p>
<p>tors, physicians, nurses, students, journalists, activists, and various investigators, 
</p>
<p>one should consider also patients and their families as key stakeholders. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, when patients or their families go on-line to find treatment options or updates 
</p>
<p>on clinical trials, they need to get access to peer-reviewed research of the highest 
</p>
<p>quality on a timely basis. For the public at large, access to knowledge and informa-
</p>
<p>tion are both essential elements for development, democracy, and social progress 
</p>
<p>in general.
</p>
<p> During the 1990s, new computer networks were full of promises, yet also were 
</p>
<p>vexed by troubling paradoxes. There was a growing awareness that new technol-
</p>
<p>ogies could both promote and hinder access to materials. Along with the price-
</p>
<p>inflation crisis, new technological regulations came quickly as new technologies 
</p>
<p>were made available to the general public. Indeed, the new technologies came with 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;locks&rdquo; called &ldquo;technological protection measures&rdquo; that made their ways into a 
</p>
<p>new international digital copyright treaty and its national implementations.6 Soon, 
</p>
<p>on-line publishers adopted digital rights management (DRM) systems and tech-
</p>
<p>nologies that could not be circumvented, publishing scholarly journals digitally 
</p>
<p>and limiting their access. These new control mechanisms contributed to the per-
</p>
<p>ception that more access was possible than ever before, when in fact, the reverse 
</p>
<p>was true.7
</p>
<p> In many other areas, however, the Internet had laid the groundwork for a new 
</p>
<p>culture of abundance in which creation is decentralized and often collective. From 
</p>
<p>this positive potential and from threats to the new wealth of easily accessible 
</p>
<p>information, a social movement promoting access to knowledge emerged.
</p>
<p> One early and influential part of this movement began in 1990, when groups 
</p>
<p>such as the American Library Association, the American Association of Law Librar-
</p>
<p>ies, and the Association of Research Libraries reached out to Ralph Nader and his 
</p>
<p>Taxpayer Assets Project to address the issue of access to digital versions of gov-
</p>
<p>ernment information. The Taxpayer Assets Project used Internet e-mail listservs 
</p>
<p>to create a grassroots campaign demanding access to federally owned databases. 
</p>
<p>Included in this effort was the Crown Jewels Campaign, which focused on access to 
</p>
<p>ress</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>479
</p>
<p>the best-known and most valuable federal databases, including a database of cor-
</p>
<p>porate disclosure documents compiled by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Com-
</p>
<p>mission, the Medline database of biomedical articles maintained by the National 
</p>
<p>Institutes of Health, the federal database of patent filings held by the U.S. Patent 
</p>
<p>and Trademark Office, the full text of bills pending before the U.S. Congress, and 
</p>
<p>databases of federal court opinions, to mention only a few. These efforts were con-
</p>
<p>sidered the first use of the Internet to mobilize and organize individuals to exercise 
</p>
<p>political power and were widely credited with a reversal of earlier policies created 
</p>
<p>by the Reagan administration to privatize access to digital versions of government 
</p>
<p>information. Moreover, the successful mass mobilization of stakeholders displayed 
</p>
<p>the potential power of open access as an idea and as a social movement.
</p>
<p> The movement for open access to scholarly publications has followed a differ-
</p>
<p>ent path than the movement for access to government documents, with the former 
</p>
<p>being nurtured largely within academic institutions and informed by the open-
</p>
<p>access movement and the latter being driven by the activist community. Without 
</p>
<p>listing all the conferences, events, and declarations that have led to the opening of 
</p>
<p>scholarly access, it is important to note statements of principle drafted between 
</p>
<p>2001 and 2003 in the so-called &ldquo;Three Bs,&rdquo; which helped to elevate public inter-
</p>
<p>est and policy debates over open access: the Budapest Open Access Initiative, The 
</p>
<p>Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing, and the Berlin Declaration on 
</p>
<p>Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.
</p>
<p> The Budapest Open Access Initiative came out of a conference convened by the 
</p>
<p>Open Society Institute on December 1 and 2, 2001, and resulted in a clear definition 
</p>
<p>of open access that permanently changed the field of scholarly communication. 
</p>
<p>Imposing an old scholarly tradition on the use of new information technologies, 
</p>
<p>the Budapest Open Access Initiative promoted scholarly communication as a pub-
</p>
<p>lic good. It defined open access as &ldquo;the free availability of peer-reviewed literature 
</p>
<p>on the public internet, permitting any user to read, download, copy, distribute, 
</p>
<p>print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles.&rdquo;8 The Bethesda Statement on 
</p>
<p>Open Access Publishing and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge 
</p>
<p>in the Sciences and Humanities9 followed the Budapest Open Access Initiative with 
</p>
<p>similar statements of principle in 2003.10
</p>
<p> Also in 2003, during a meeting of consumer groups in Lisbon, Portugal, activ-
</p>
<p>ists, government delegates to the World Intellectual Property Organization 
</p>
<p>(WIPO), and academics from all over the world met to focus on a work program for 
</p>
<p>WIPO. From that meeting emerged an agreement among a number of nongovern-
</p>
<p>mental organizations and government negotiators to focus on the subject of access 
</p>
<p>to educational and scholarly materials. In the aftermath of this meeting, another 
</p>
<p>conference was organized by the Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD) 
</p>
<p>open-access publishing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>480
</p>
<p>Working Group on Intellectual Property, on April 5, 2004, at the Ford Foundation 
</p>
<p>in New York. The conference was dedicated to the subject of access to essential 
</p>
<p>learning tools, including access to books, scholarly journals, databases, and soft-
</p>
<p>ware, as well as the delivery of education over the Internet (distance education). 
</p>
<p>This event was greatly stimulating, as was a private meeting on April 6 at the Open 
</p>
<p>Society Institute, where participants decided to broaden the overall theme of the 
</p>
<p>effort to access to knowledge.11
</p>
<p> As a historical footnote, this was where the decision was first made to use 
</p>
<p>the term &ldquo;A2K&rdquo; as the &ldquo;brand name&rdquo; for a movement that included not only the 
</p>
<p>learning-tools issues, but also the broader issues of access to knowledge, including 
</p>
<p>access to medical and other inventions.
</p>
<p> Subsequently, new projects were born to promote access to educational materi-
</p>
<p>als and access to knowledge and technologies, often focusing on the opportunities 
</p>
<p>presented by new digital technologies and open-licensing strategies for copyright 
</p>
<p>or patents. These multiplied rapidly, thanks to the efforts of a diverse set of actors. 
</p>
<p>Many Web sites and discussion lists began to knit together the various strands of 
</p>
<p>different access movements, and in 2005, two meetings were held to draft a pro-
</p>
<p>posal for a treaty on access to knowledge. These brought together a very diverse 
</p>
<p>set of experts, interests, and constituencies, including librarians, free-software 
</p>
<p>advocates, access-to-medicine activists, Internet service providers, software 
</p>
<p>providers, development NGOs, and government representatives from the Global 
</p>
<p>South. Collectively, the access to knowledge movement was becoming increasingly 
</p>
<p>important and influential.
</p>
<p> The public statements by the Three Bs have provided long-lasting and influen-
</p>
<p>tial definitions of open access for publishing enterprises in this movement. While 
</p>
<p>the definitions differ in some ways,12 they are in accord on core principles, such as 
</p>
<p>that open-access content must be free of charge for all users with an Internet con-
</p>
<p>nection and permission barriers must be removed for all legitimate uses.
</p>
<p> The Budapest statement explicitly prescribes that open access must depend on 
</p>
<p>authors&rsquo; consent. In the Bethesda and Berlin statements, the owners of the rights 
</p>
<p>to the content must consent to let all users copy, use, distribute, transmit, display, 
</p>
<p>or make derivative works in any way and for any purpose with proper attribution.
</p>
<p> The core principle is the removal of access barriers and permission&mdash;however, 
</p>
<p>that principle does not require removing barriers to commercial reuse or imposing 
</p>
<p>a policy on allowing or not allowing derivative works. Some open-access initiatives 
</p>
<p>include mandatory measures for long-term preservation. Some, such as BioMed 
</p>
<p>Central, specifies XML as a standardized format for open-access works.13
</p>
<p> &ldquo;How important is uniformity about the definition?&rdquo; asks Peter Suber. &ldquo;There is 
</p>
<p>already uniformity on the core concept: removing price and permission barriers.&rdquo;14

</p>
<p>For most proponents of open access, there is no need to create artificial factions 
</p>
<p>in the movement. Rather, the definition of open access is an evolving and flex-
</p>
<p>ible concept with policy space to test new elements as they become necessary. The 
</p>
<p>challenge is to keep it simple and not confusing, yet complex enough to accom-
</p>
<p>modate diversity.15 In order to realize the vision of a global and accessible rep-
</p>
<p>resentation of knowledge, the future Web has to be sustainable, interactive, and 
</p>
<p>transparent. Content and software tools must be openly accessible and compatible.
</p>
<p>practice
</p>
<p>Though the publishers of open scholarly journals share many of the goals and 
</p>
<p>principles of the A2K movement, including the open, unconstrained dissemination 
</p>
<p>of information, publication in support of collaboration, and the advancement and 
</p>
<p>spread of knowledge throughout the world, in practice, a troubling gap remains. 
</p>
<p>Historically, scholarly and scientific journals existed in unison with a professional 
</p>
<p>association, university, or university library. These journals generally had a narrow 
</p>
<p>subject focus and a limited audience composed of the scholars/authors themselves 
</p>
<p>and their peers.16 These tended to be mostly U.S.-based scholars.
</p>
<p> The field of scholarly publishing is still dominated by U.S.-based scholars, 
</p>
<p>though foreign input of articles has risen since the 1990s.17 However, U.S. dominance 
</p>
<p>compounds access problems for scholars, researchers, and the public in developing 
</p>
<p>countries. Many researchers cannot be published and are therefore never quoted. 
</p>
<p>Many cannot even acquire journals published mostly in developed countries and 
</p>
<p>are left without access to scholarly literature on scientific innovations. The price of 
</p>
<p>academic journals, already historically high, has increased with the new licensing 
</p>
<p>schemes of on-line publishing. For example, on-line publishers often license only 
</p>
<p>large packages of journals, instead of the few that are really needed or wanted by 
</p>
<p>an institution. In addition, on-line-only access (without hard copies) often results 
</p>
<p>in empty archives when a subscription is dropped, often because it is too costly. 
</p>
<p>Many libraries in developing countries cannot afford these licenses.
</p>
<p> The practical implementation of open-access principles by open-access journals 
</p>
<p>has solved many of these problems and in so doing has proved to be a fundamental 
</p>
<p>piece of the A2K puzzle.18 Not only do open-access journals expand access to schol-
</p>
<p>arly works around the globe, they also provide opportunities for new voices and 
</p>
<p>perspectives to enter the worldwide scholarly community.19 Included in this expan-
</p>
<p>sion is an increased potential for authors and policy advocates in developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries to affect the debate over the rationing of knowledge throughout the world.
</p>
<p> While it is difficult to quantify the economic and social value of solving this 
</p>
<p>problem, it is evident that access to knowledge has become one of the fundamental 
</p>
<p>open-access publishing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>482
</p>
<p>goals of developmental policies, even while developing countries face enormous 
</p>
<p>trade pressures to increase enforcement of copyright laws, including the introduc-
</p>
<p>tion of new legal and technological measures to restrict the copying of digital works.
</p>
<p> The A2K movement, in many respects, exists to combat such harmful and 
</p>
<p>entirely unnecessary policies. Because the movement is itself an affirmation or 
</p>
<p>defense of the same policies on which open journals are based, it seems only fitting 
</p>
<p>that the A2K movement should have an open scholarly journal of its own. That 
</p>
<p>was the impetus behind the founding of the journal Knowledge Ecology Studies.
</p>
<p> In 2006, as the A2K movement began to gain in influence and importance, it 
</p>
<p>became increasingly necessary for the various actors involved to consolidate and 
</p>
<p>disseminate not just information, but advocacy and policy writings touching on 
</p>
<p>all of the diverse issues and disciplines that intersect in discussions of A2K. While 
</p>
<p>there are so many quality on-line journals that it is almost impossible to keep track 
</p>
<p>(SpringerLink alone publishes about fifteen hundred), they generally focus on tra-
</p>
<p>ditional subject matters, and very few offer a multidisciplinary approach to issues 
</p>
<p>and potential policies regarding A2K issues.
</p>
<p> With no formal experience as publishers, but as longtime readers of and con-
</p>
<p>tributors of scholarly publications, our small team of eight decided that we could 
</p>
<p>enhance our overall mission of promoting access to knowledge by creating our 
</p>
<p>own on-line journal that would serve the A2K community. After consulting with 
</p>
<p>open-journal and technology experts for about a year, the staff of Knowledge 
</p>
<p>Ecology International (KEI) decided to come forward with a proposal to create a 
</p>
<p>journal specifically designed and managed to provide opportunities to scholars 
</p>
<p>and researchers who might not have access to existing on-line journals. An addi-
</p>
<p>tional goal was to improve access to A2K issues and debates for the broader public. 
</p>
<p>Developments in technologies, as well as in the policy space and history of open 
</p>
<p>access, have fueled this ongoing experiment.20
</p>
<p> For us, knowledge ecology is a multidisciplinary field of study recognizing the 
</p>
<p>importance of relationships and links, the diversity of knowledge forms and types, 
</p>
<p>and the need for community production, distribution, and use of knowledge. It 
</p>
<p>is a broader and more inclusive theme than can be encompassed in terms such as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; or &ldquo;access,&rdquo; and it captures our own sense that it is useful 
</p>
<p>to think about knowledge in a more holistic way, considering a wide range of eco-
</p>
<p>nomic, social, labor, distributional, security, moral, and political issues.
</p>
<p> As a project of KEI, Knowledge Ecology Studies was designed to have a mul-
</p>
<p>tidisciplinary and international scope and to aim for the most cost-effective 
</p>
<p>approach to the dissemination and indexing of scholarly and scientific research 
</p>
<p>and related information. Shifting away from knowledge and information &ldquo;manage-
</p>
<p>ment&rdquo; and its focus on assessing and profiting from knowledge, KEStudies looks at

</p>
<p>knowledge creation, distribution, and use as a system, an ecosystem, where human 
</p>
<p>intellect, innovation, and technology interrelate.
</p>
<p> The following is an account of our experience in becoming an open-access jour-
</p>
<p>nal publisher, including a discussion of the issues we had to address while design-
</p>
<p>ing the journal: the journal&rsquo;s basic policy intellectual property, quality and peer 
</p>
<p>review, and funding sources, as well as on technical issues such as software plat-
</p>
<p>forms and on editorial principles.
</p>
<p>basic policy decisions
</p>
<p>The principal issues facing authors, publishers, and users of open-access journals 
</p>
<p>are related to the compatibility of open access with existing rules regarding copy-
</p>
<p>right, peer review, revenues, printing, preservation, promotion, and indexing, all 
</p>
<p>of which are associated with conventional scholarly literature.
</p>
<p> Clearly, open-access on-line publishing can function within the copyright system.  
</p>
<p>It is compatible with traditional exploitations of writings (printing, preservation, 
</p>
<p>professional promotion, and indexing), and it does not exclude the peer-review 
</p>
<p>process, but it also allows a more transparent and in some cases more efficient 
</p>
<p>use of that process. However, there is a wide variety of answers to the types of

</p>
<p>questions faced by those looking to publish an open-access journal. Among the 
</p>
<p>decisions that need to be made, three issues appear to be more difficult than the 
</p>
<p>others: issues related to copyright and other existing rules, quality and peer-
</p>
<p>review issues, and funding issues.
</p>
<p> One of the first questions facing an open access publisher involves what 
</p>
<p>authors, publishers, and readers want and need from copyright in their works.21 
</p>
<p>An additional question involves what kind of control and what kind of distribution 
</p>
<p>authors and publishers need. Because we were born out of the A2K movement, we 
</p>
<p>believe our journal has to provide free access to scholarly literature without undue 
</p>
<p>copyright and licensing restrictions. To achieve this goal, the editorial board exam-
</p>
<p>ined several possible licenses.
</p>
<p> One alternative&mdash;and the one embraced by most open-access journals&mdash;was to 
</p>
<p>apply the Creative Commons Attribution License (CCAL) to all works. Under the 
</p>
<p>CCAL, authors retain ownership of the copyright for their article, but they allow 
</p>
<p>anyone to download, reuse, reprint, modify, distribute, and/or copy the article as 
</p>
<p>long as the original authors and source are credited. This broad license was devel-
</p>
<p>oped to facilitate open access to, and free use of original works of all types. It 
</p>
<p>ensures that works remain freely and openly available. Under the CCAL, readers 
</p>
<p>are free to make derivative works, defined as &ldquo;a work based upon one or more pre-
</p>
<p>existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fiction-
</p>
<p>alization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, 
</p>
<p>condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or 
</p>
<p>adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or 
</p>
<p>other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship.&rdquo;22 
</p>
<p>Readers are also free to make commercial use of works on the condition that in 
</p>
<p>doing so, the user gives credit to the original author and, in the case of reuse or 
</p>
<p>distribution, makes clear the licensing terms of the derivative work. Any of those 
</p>
<p>conditions can be waived with permission from the author.
</p>
<p> However, whether authors should give everyone permission to make &ldquo;deriva-
</p>
<p>tive&rdquo; works from their articles proved to be one of the most contentious issues 
</p>
<p>we faced when establishing our policy on copyright issues. Copyright law usually 
</p>
<p>prevents the creation of derivative works. What counts as a derivative in each dif-
</p>
<p>ferent area of copyright is different, and there is enormous variety in the different 
</p>
<p>kinds of works that one might license. For example, one author argued that his 
</p>
<p>paper should not be used and transformed to misrepresent his policy suggestions. 
</p>
<p>Another wanted to keep the right to control the quality of a possible translation. 
</p>
<p>While many authors are not really interested in being involved in or in limiting 
</p>
<p>what others can do with their work or even, on the contrary, may be happy to see 
</p>
<p>others build on their work, some do want, for various reasons, to keep control of 
</p>
<p>ress</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>485
</p>
<p>their productions. A multiplicity of factors contribute to differing attitudes toward 
</p>
<p>permission to create derivative works: the type of work (a policy paper, an inter-
</p>
<p>view, a review, or a picture for example), the culture or origins of the author (aca-
</p>
<p>demics versus activists, Europeans versus South Asians, for example), the author&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>expectations for the future of their work, and other factors, as well.
</p>
<p> Consequently, despite the popularity of the CCAL license, the editorial team of 
</p>
<p>KEStudies decided to rewrite the license in a publishing contract to reflect inter-
</p>
<p>nal discussions regarding remix culture and, in general, transformative use. We 
</p>
<p>decided to look at the needs of the three principal parties involved: the author, the 
</p>
<p>publisher, and the public. We decided that copyright owners are within their rights 
</p>
<p>to object to nontransformative, verbatim copying of their copyrighted materials 
</p>
<p>on-line. This does not include instances where copyrighted materials are employed 
</p>
<p>for purposes of comment, criticism, reporting, parody, satire, or scholarship or if 
</p>
<p>within the bounds of fair use under U.S. law. Since this is not the case under every 
</p>
<p>copyright law, specifying the public&rsquo;s right is necessary. In addition, we, as pub-
</p>
<p>lishers, might want to make and distribute copies noncommercially or commer-
</p>
<p>cially without asking for permission. Therefore, we settled on the following terms:
</p>
<p>1.  Author&rsquo;s Rights. The Author retains: (i) the exclusive right to be credited as the 
</p>
<p>Author; (ii) the right to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly 
</p>
<p>display the Work in any medium for any purpose; (iii) the right to prepare and 
</p>
<p>distribute derivative works from the Work; and (iv) the right to authorize others 
</p>
<p>to make any use of the Work, in all cases so long as the Journal is cited as the 
</p>
<p>source of first publication of the Work.
</p>
<p>  For example, the Author may make and distribute copies in the course of 
</p>
<p>teaching, research or any other activities, may post the Work on personal or 
</p>
<p>institutional web sites and in other open access digital repositories, or use the 
</p>
<p>Work commercially.
</p>
<p>2.  Publisher&rsquo;s Rights. The Publisher obtains a royalty-free, worldwide: (i) right 
</p>
<p>to publish, distribute, reproduce, display, publicly perform, prepare deriva-
</p>
<p>tive works, edit as suitable for publication, translate to any language, and use 
</p>
<p>the Work in any format&mdash;digital or in print or any other medium whether now 
</p>
<p>known or hereafter devised&mdash;either separately or as a part of a collective work; 
</p>
<p>(ii) right to receive compensation; (iii) exclusive right to receive proper attribu-
</p>
<p>tion and citation as journal of first publication; (iv) right to include the Work in 
</p>
<p>computerized archival or retrieval systems (such as SSRN, Westlaw, LexisNexis); 
</p>
<p>and (v) right to assign, sublicense or transfer to third parties any rights obtained 
</p>
<p>by this agreement, provided that third party fulfils the Publisher&rsquo;s obligations 
</p>
<p>contained in this agreement towards the Author. In all cases these rights apply 
</p>
<p>so long as the Author receives proper attribution as author.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>486
</p>
<p>  For example, the Publisher may make and distribute copies in the course 
</p>
<p>of teaching, research or any other activities, may post the Work on personal or 
</p>
<p>institutional web sites and in other open access digital repositories, or use the 
</p>
<p>Work commercially, without the Author&rsquo;s permission.
</p>
<p>3.  Public&rsquo;s Rights. Knowledge Ecology Studies is a journal dedicated to the open 
</p>
<p>exchange of information; therefore the Author agrees that the Work published 
</p>
<p>in the Journal be made available to the public under two licenses: A Creative 
</p>
<p>Commons Attribution Non-commercial No Derivatives 3.0 License and a Knowl-
</p>
<p>edge Ecology Studies Developing Nations License.23
</p>
<p> In addition, the editorial team decided to deal specifically with issues regarding 
</p>
<p>developing countries by offering an expanded license to exploit works commer-
</p>
<p>cially, the terms of which are as follows:
</p>
<p>The Knowledge Ecology Studies Developing Nations License will provide the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the public accessing the Work from a developing country&mdash;any country not 
</p>
<p>classified as high-income economy by the World Bank&mdash;with the option to obtain 
</p>
<p>all the rights granted under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial 
</p>
<p>No Derivatives 3.0 License on a commercial basis (see: http://creativecommons. 
</p>
<p>org/about/licenses/meet-the-licenses), as long as they implement reasonably 
</p>
<p>effective mechanisms to prevent access to the Work by members of the public 
</p>
<p>located in high-income economies as classified by the World Bank.24
</p>
<p>The debate over not allowing the public to make derivative works by default and 
</p>
<p>the special treatment clause for developing countries were the two most contro-
</p>
<p>versial issues both internally and with our advisory board. However, so far, no 
</p>
<p>author has asked to redact the agreement.
</p>
<p> Less controversial was our decision about how to attract and provide quality 
</p>
<p>content. This followed from the decision to have an open system for peer review-
</p>
<p>ing. High-quality peer review is necessary, but some aspects of the traditional peer-
</p>
<p>review processes are being questioned. The traditional system has well-known 
</p>
<p>flaws such as lack of transparency and issues of conflict of interest. With the new 
</p>
<p>open access model, one can see the opportunity to reevaluate existing practices.
</p>
<p> There are many examples of claims by traditional publishers that open access 
</p>
<p>is a threat to peer review. However, Peter Suber, who makes a point of keeping 
</p>
<p>track of such claims, notes that if some of the publishers clearly state that open 
</p>
<p>access will undermine peer review, they are never specific in explaining why or 
</p>
<p>how.25 According to Stevan Harnad, a scientist and an active promoter of the 
</p>
<p>Open Access philosophy,26 there are no essential differences between the tradi-
</p>
<p>tional journals that require a paid subscription and open-access journals when it 
</p>
<p>ress</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>487
</p>
<p>comes to the objectives of peer review. However, the new platforms offer the pos-
</p>
<p>sibility of distributing the tasks more equitably and more efficiently,27 can make 
</p>
<p>the process more transparent, and even can embrace a &ldquo;utopian transformation&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>that has already taken place in some scientific fields, where live, preprint archives 
</p>
<p>are available.28 Even without using all the imaginative interactive processes that 
</p>
<p>can be used for peer reviewing, most open-access journal editors are willing to 
</p>
<p>experiment with new strategies. For example, many open-access journal editors 
</p>
<p>are experimenting with unblinded review, postpublication review, and open sub-
</p>
<p>mission. At KEStudies, we believe that anonymity is not a necessary condition. 
</p>
<p>A reviewer may make herself known to the author if she so desires. One of the 
</p>
<p>advantages of this practice is to encourage collaboration between authors and 
</p>
<p>reviewers, which often results in a much better paper.
</p>
<p> A wide variety of authors contribute to the journal, including some who do 
</p>
<p>not necessarily find their way in more traditional publishing contexts and who are 
</p>
<p>involved in different types of knowledge production. Authors may submit lon-
</p>
<p>ger pieces for peer review, but they may also submit personal interviews, short 
</p>
<p>research notes, book reviews, or opinion pieces, none of which are peer reviewed. 
</p>
<p>The journal is also open to reports of events such as negotiations or meetings cov-
</p>
<p>ered &ldquo;in real time,&rdquo; and these do not require peer reviewing. This is one of the 
</p>
<p>most attractive features of the journal: the possibility of quick publishing, particu-
</p>
<p>larly when articles are designed to shape and influence rapidly unfolding policy 
</p>
<p>debates and negotiations. In this sense, peer review can become an impediment  
</p>
<p>to quality.
</p>
<p> Finally, funding KEStudies posed issues with which we had to deal. The funda-
</p>
<p>mental difference between traditional journals and an open journal is that readers 
</p>
<p>do not pay for access, which eliminates price as a barrier. &ldquo;Artificial scarcity&rdquo; is not 
</p>
<p>the business plan for an open-access journal. With this in mind, the obvious ques-
</p>
<p>tion is how to pay for it. On the other hand, while readers do not pay for access 
</p>
<p>for KEStudies, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s free. As a response in the Budapest Open 
</p>
<p>Access Initiative Frequently Asked Questions notes,
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;free&rdquo; is ambiguous. We mean free for readers, not free for producers. We 
</p>
<p>know that open-access literature is not free (without cost) to produce. But that does 
</p>
<p>not preclude the possibility of making it free of charge (without price) for readers and 
</p>
<p>users. The costs of producing open-access literature are much lower than the costs of 
</p>
<p>producing print literature or toll-access online literature. These low costs can be borne 
</p>
<p>by any of a wide variety of potential funders, among which BOAI has no preferences.29
</p>
<p> How can open-access journals become a more sustainable model for publish-
</p>
<p>ing? Jim Till, currently a member of the Executive Committee of Project Open

</p>
<p>Source/Open Access at the University of Toronto, writes in his blog: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an 
</p>
<p>ongoing debate about ways to pay the costs of OA, especially during the transition 
</p>
<p>phase between traditional business models and newer OA-oriented ones. There are 
</p>
<p>several potential sources of substantial revenues. One focal point for the debate 
</p>
<p>has been on revenues from academic institutions (a major source of support for 
</p>
<p>knowledge dissemination), relative to revenues from funding agencies (a major 
</p>
<p>source of support for knowledge generation).&rdquo;30
</p>
<p> There are many funding scenarios that apply differently for different institu-
</p>
<p>tions. As long as the funding mechanism does not imply charging readers or their 
</p>
<p>institutions for access, that is, as long as there are no subscription fees, no licens-
</p>
<p>ing fees, and no pay per view, the means of funding is consistent with the open-
</p>
<p>access philosophy.31
</p>
<p> In our broader study of open journals, the editorial board considered a variety 
</p>
<p>of funding mechanisms, including requiring authors to pay, seeking government 
</p>
<p>funding, applying for funding from private donors or a consortium of institutions 
</p>
<p>or libraries, funding through our own organization as a form of promoting our mis-
</p>
<p>sion, and creating new, decentralized funding mechanisms based on prize systems.
</p>
<p> For the purposes of this journal, the more ambitious methods that require 
</p>
<p>broader acceptance by governments or other large institutions were not feasible. 
</p>
<p>The editorial board most seriously considered only three possibilities: using the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;author pays&rdquo; approach, seeking support from charitable foundations, or mak-
</p>
<p>ing the journal an integrated part of Knowledge Ecology International&rsquo;s larger 
</p>
<p>budget, connected to its mission and activities. However, the board ultimately 
</p>
<p>rejected the &ldquo;author pays&rdquo; approach, since few authors in the field have indepen-
</p>
<p>dent funding, though this is not the situation for some journals in the sciences.32 
</p>
<p>In the end, the board allocated some start-up funding from a 2006 MacArthur 
</p>
<p>prize given to KEI, and the ongoing cost of the journal will be part of the basic  
</p>
<p>KEI operating budget.
</p>
<p> However, this is not a long-term solution, and we are actively working on pro-
</p>
<p>posals to have new funding mechanisms put into place. Options do exist. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, Leslie Chan notes that we would all benefit if only 1 percent of any university 
</p>
<p>library budget for journals was to be awarded to open-access publications. One can 
</p>
<p>even imagine scholars and readers having a say in which journal should be awarded 
</p>
<p>the 1 percent. One could imagine an allocation system as described by James Love 
</p>
<p>in &ldquo;Artists Want to Be Paid: The Blur/Banff Proposal.&rdquo;33 One proposal could be 
</p>
<p>that intermediaries such as the open-access publishers would compete against 
</p>
<p>each other for the funding from an organizational budget. Other possibilities could 
</p>
<p>include that all the money goes to journals in a specific field, or that a percentage 
</p>
<p>would go to support new or rare fields of study, or that money would be allocated 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>489
</p>
<p>on the basis of readers&rsquo; downloads. As Peter Suber states, open access is &ldquo;not free 
</p>
<p>to produce, but a very small subsidy will make possible a very large public good.&rdquo;34
</p>
<p>technical decisions
</p>
<p>When evaluating possible technical platforms on which to host the journal, the 
</p>
<p>most important criterion was that the system had to deal with issues of manage-
</p>
<p>ment and publishing in an open fashion. In agreement with the open-access decla-
</p>
<p>rations, KEStudies required software tools to be openly accessible and compatible. 
</p>
<p>Interoperability and long-term archiving were also main criteria. However, with 
</p>
<p>few staff members qualified to write code, the journal also needed a system that 
</p>
<p>did not require a full-time technical staff.
</p>
<p> Through conferences and advice from more experienced colleagues (such as 
</p>
<p>First Monday&rsquo;s Nancy Jones), the KEStudies board decided to experiment with the 
</p>
<p>Open Journal Systems, or OJS, a journal-management and publishing system that 
</p>
<p>has been developed by the Public Knowledge Project.35 Our technical advisor easily 
</p>
<p>installed the system, and the editorial team learned how to set up and operate the 
</p>
<p>system without much help from the technicians involved. Basically, OJS is open-
</p>
<p>source software offering a publishing template that is easy to use and modify. At 
</p>
<p>the outset of the project, the software prompted us through a set-up menu, a series 
</p>
<p>of templates requiring our editorial board to articulate the journal&rsquo;s policies on 
</p>
<p>copyright, staff roles, and review and privacy guidelines. The structure was helpful 
</p>
<p>in identifying the decisions necessary for the publication of an open journal.
</p>
<p> OJS is installed on our local server and is fully controllable from in-house 
</p>
<p>equipment, giving our editors the ability to configure, independently of the OJS 
</p>
<p>system, requirements, sections, the review process, copyright policies, and so on. 
</p>
<p>All content is submitted and managed on-line, from contacting and recording peer 
</p>
<p>reviewers and their responses to approving galley proofs and working through the 
</p>
<p>copyediting and formatting processes. Subscriptions are likewise handled by the 
</p>
<p>system, with delayed open-access options, in which contents are made available a 
</p>
<p>chosen time period after initial publication, and OJS manages archives and index-
</p>
<p>ing. Readers are able to e-mail authors directly through the system.
</p>
<p>editorial decisions
</p>
<p>In addition to the issues discussed above, several of the flexibilities inherent in the 
</p>
<p>open, on-line publishing system are worth noting. Like any serious publisher, we 
</p>
<p>hope that readers and authors will benefit from our policies, which allow for a great 
</p>
<p>deal of openness and flexibility. The fact that the journal is published on a rolling 
</p>
<p>basis, rather than as a weekly, monthly, or quarterly journal allows its readers and 
</p>
<p>authors to engage in real time, as has been previously noted. Beyond that, the fact 
</p>
<p>open-access publishing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>490
</p>
<p>that the journal is very open in terms of the types of pieces it accepts and whether 
</p>
<p>these pieces are peer reviewed allows for a variety of input from different disciplines 
</p>
<p>and in a variety of languages. If an author or authors want to propose the publica-
</p>
<p>tion of data or draft policy guidelines, for example, the editorial board has the ability 
</p>
<p>to incorporate these ideas. In many ways, that makes KEStudies an evolving journal, 
</p>
<p>responsive to user-generated ideas and decentralized in its decision-making pro-
</p>
<p>cesses, all with the goal of being as open a publication as possible without sacrificing 
</p>
<p>the quality expected of a peer-reviewed, scholastic journal. The editorial board is 
</p>
<p>now discussing improving our presubmission process, by which authors can presub-
</p>
<p>mit an abstract that would benefit from early feedback from the editors. Since we 
</p>
<p>are occasionally publishing first-time authors (and some nonnative English writers), 
</p>
<p>we consider part of our mission to invest time and skills in presubmission dialogues.
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>From open-access principles to practice, the experiment of publishing an open-
</p>
<p>access journal, like the A2K movement itself, is ongoing. Technical decisions such 
</p>
<p>as how tools must be accessible and compatible were probably the easiest to make, 
</p>
<p>but not to implement. Editorial decisions are also still evolving and are still chal-
</p>
<p>lenging. We are trying to find the right balance between being extremely inclusive 
</p>
<p>and keeping a high level of expertise among our authors, as well as promoting bal-
</p>
<p>ance in the scope and focus within their various fields.
</p>
<p> The decisions related to intellectual property required a lot of time and seemed 
</p>
<p>complex and political, but ended up being much less controversial than others. The 
</p>
<p>process of moving from exclusive rights to nonexclusive rights obviously changes 
</p>
<p>the dissemination of knowledge with respect to its legal aspects. To facilitate opti-
</p>
<p>mal use and access, we seek &ldquo;to find solutions that support further development of 
</p>
<p>the existing legal and financial frameworks,&rdquo; as the signatories of the Berlin Dec-
</p>
<p>laration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities state. We 
</p>
<p>are still working on finding long-term solutions that implement this aim, especially 
</p>
<p>when it comes to making our journal financially sustainable.
</p>
<p> We are seeking to promote and support global participation in cultural, scien-
</p>
<p>tific, civic and educational affairs, and of course we recognize the opportunities 
</p>
<p>arising from technological progress, such as the Internet. Providing more access 
</p>
<p>to more knowledge is essential and should include both diversifying forms of 
</p>
<p>publication and democratizing knowledge creation and access. At the same time, 
</p>
<p>it also becomes more and more apparent that creative individuals and communi-
</p>
<p>ties&rsquo; interests must be recognized and protected without limiting access or creating 
</p>
<p>scarcity when abundance can prevail.

</p>
<p> Open-access journals do not by themselves revolutionize access to knowledge 
</p>
<p>and the distribution of scholarly or scientific materials. As is well described by 
</p>
<p>Jean Claude Gu&eacute;don,
</p>
<p>Open Access is not an end in itself; it is merely a symptom of deeper processes 
</p>
<p>linked to the growing role of digitization in our civilization. It is digitization that 
</p>
<p>brings about opportunities for profound shifts in power. Open Access simply defines 
</p>
<p>a battle front that refers to the challenges being thrown at the architectures of con-
</p>
<p>trol supported by publishers. Like a litmus test, the quest for Open Access reveals an 
</p>
<p>architecture of control on the wane.36
</p>
<p> In early conversations about the Internet and its impact on publishing, what 
</p>
<p>dominated was the potential &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; from the existing intermediaries. 
</p>
<p>However, according to Michael Carroll, &ldquo;after the revolutionary euphoria died 
</p>
<p>down . . . many acknowledged that intermediaries are necessary to all kinds of 
</p>
<p>transactions in commerce, culture, and news. Reintermediation soon follows from 
</p>
<p>disintermediation, and the real question the Internet posed was not whether inter-
</p>
<p>mediaries are necessary but what kinds of intermediaries are necessary.&rdquo;37
</p>
<p> Defining ourselves as publishers of scholarly and policy-relevant knowledge 
</p>
<p>goods, we are, whether we like it or not, intermediaries for goods that can be 
</p>
<p>accessed and copied fairly cheaply, sometimes at zero or close to zero cost. How-
</p>
<p>ever, providing these knowledge goods also often requires high fixed costs and 
</p>
<p>presents a number of policy dilemmas to the intermediaries that provide them.
</p>
<p> As a provider of knowledge goods, the journal Knowledge Ecology Studies tries 
</p>
<p>to base its policies on the fact that obviously knowledge goods are &ldquo;nonrival in 
</p>
<p>consumption,&rdquo; meaning that consumption by one does not preclude or diminish 
</p>
<p>consumption by another. If one decides to ensure that they must also be nonex-
</p>
<p>cludable and that it is neither necessary nor beneficial to restrict access to create 
</p>
<p>traditional private incentives, it is important for the A2K movement to develop and 
</p>
<p>create new mechanisms to support authors and their intermediaries. This is an issue 
</p>
<p>that KEStudies is seeking to resolve by engaging in research on new methods and 
</p>
<p>sources of funding, especially for developing countries&rsquo; authors and intermediaries.
</p>
<p> KEStudies has had to reinvent the role of an intermediary, a publisher, in the 
</p>
<p>knowledge ecology in terms of funding, balancing creator and public rights, and 
</p>
<p>distributing knowledge goods in keeping with the paradigm of access to knowl-
</p>
<p>edge. Through our experiences, we have come to believe that the complexities of 
</p>
<p>A2K practice, including the many ways to structure an open publication, can all be 
</p>
<p>resolved within the bounds of A2K principles.

</p>
<p> An Open Access Publication[1] is one that meets the following two conditions:
</p>
<p>1. The author(s) and copyright holder(s) grant(s) to all users a free, irrevocable, worldwide, 
</p>
<p>perpetual right of access to, and a license to copy, use, distribute, transmit and display the 
</p>
<p>work publicly and to make and distribute derivative works, in any digital medium for any 
</p>
<p>responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution of authorship[2], as well as the right to 
</p>
<p>make small numbers of printed copies for their personal use.
</p>
<p>2. A complete version of the work and all supplemental materials, including a copy of the per-
</p>
<p>mission as stated above, in a suitable standard electronic format is deposited immediately 
</p>
<p>upon initial publication in at least one online repository that is supported by an academic 
</p>
<p>institution, scholarly society, government agency, or other well-established organization 
</p>
<p>that seeks to enable open access, unrestricted distribution, interoperability, and long-term 
</p>
<p>archiving (for the biomedical sciences, PubMed Central is such a repository).
</p>
<p>[1] Open access is a property of individual works, not necessarily journals or publishers.
</p>
<p>[2]  Community standards, rather than copyright law, will continue to provide the mechanism for enforcement of 
</p>
<p>proper attribution and responsible use of the published work, as they do now.

<p>Federal Research Public Access Act, declared: &ldquo;If enacted, S.2695 could well have the unin-
</p>
<p>tended consequence of compromising or destroying the independent system of peer review 
</p>
<p>that ensures the integrity of the very research the U.S. Government is trying to support and 
</p>
<p>disseminate.&rdquo; See https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/3006.html and http://
</p>
<p>www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2006_05_07_fosblogarchive.html#114726726169346460. And in 
</p>
<p>February 2007, the DC Principles Coalition declared, in opposition to the same legislation: &ldquo;Sub-
</p>
<p>scriptions to journals with a high percentage of federally funded research would decline rapidly. 
</p>
<p>Subscription revenues support the quality control system known as peer review.&rdquo; See http://

</p>
<p>Declaration of February 2007, organized by the Association of Learned and Professional Society 
</p>
<p>Publishers and the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers 
</p>
<p>likewise opposed a proposed open-access mandate for the European Union by declaring: &ldquo;Open

</p>
<p>the new lobbying organization of the Association of American Publishers and Professional 
</p>
<p>Scholarly Publishing, the Partnership for Research Integrity in Science and Medicine (PRISM), 
</p>
<p>opposed government open-access mandates by declaring that open-access policies would

<p>27 &ldquo;Paper publishing&rsquo;s traditional quality-control mechanism, peer review, will have to be 
</p>
<p>implemented on the Net, thereby re-creating the hierarchies of journals that allow authors, 
</p>
<p>readers, and promotion committees to calibrate their judgments rationally&mdash;or as rationally 
</p>
<p>as traditional peer review ever allowed them to do it. The Net also offers the possibility of 
</p>
<p>implementing peer review more efficiently and equitably, and of supplementing it with 
</p>
<p>what is the Net&rsquo;s real revolutionary dimension: interactive publication in the form of open 
</p>
<p>peer commentary on published and ongoing work. Most of this &lsquo;scholarly skywriting&rsquo; like-

<p>The	Global	Politics	of	Interoperability
</p>
<p>Laura DeNardis
</p>
<p>Technical standards are the least visible, but arguably most critical and least 
</p>
<p>understood component of the Internet&rsquo;s technical and legal architecture. Informa-
</p>
<p>tion and communication technology (ICT) standards are not material products, like 
</p>
<p>software or hardware, but exist at a much higher level of abstraction and control. 
</p>
<p>They are literally blueprints for developing technologies that can communicate and 
</p>
<p>exchange information with other technologies.1 Most Internet users are familiar 
</p>
<p>with well-known standards such as Bluetooth wireless, &ldquo;Wi-Fi,&rdquo;2 the MP3 format 
</p>
<p>for encoding and compressing audio files,3 and HTTP,4 which enables the standard 
</p>
<p>exchange of information between Web browsers and Web servers. These are only 
</p>
<p>a few examples of thousands of standards enabling the production, exchange, and 
</p>
<p>use of information.
</p>
<p> From a technological standpoint, standards are the agreed-upon rules struc-
</p>
<p>turing information in common formats and establishing communication interfaces 
</p>
<p>that enable interoperability between diverse ICT environments.5 From an eco-
</p>
<p>nomic standpoint, interoperability standards carry significant externalities, such 
</p>
<p>as enabling competition and innovation in product areas based on common tech-
</p>
<p>nical specifications.6 Technical standards are not only technical design decisions 
</p>
<p>that can carry significant economic externalities, they also make political decisions 
</p>
<p>about global knowledge policy.7
</p>
<p> These resources necessary for information production and exchange are exam-
</p>
<p>ples of what Yochai Benkler calls &ldquo;knowledge-embedded tools,&rdquo; similar to enabling 
</p>
<p>technologies for medical and agricultural resources.8 Knowledge-embedded tools 
</p>
<p>such as open (versus proprietary) standards are necessary for enhancing welfare 
</p>
<p>and enabling innovation itself. Internet standards such as TCP/IP (Transmission 
</p>
<p>Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
</p>
<p>have historically been openly available, enabling citizens and entrepreneurs to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>denardis498
</p>
<p>contribute to Internet innovation, cultural creativity, and electronic discursive 
</p>
<p>spheres. For example, Web standards such as HTTP and HTML enable citizens 
</p>
<p>both to create new software applications based on these standards and to con-
</p>
<p>tribute actual content to the Internet. However, the institutional processes, intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property arrangements, and technical approaches of some standards do not 
</p>
<p>necessarily provide sufficient openness to enable this innovation and cultural pro-
</p>
<p>duction. Who can participate in the development of standards? Who controls stan-
</p>
<p>dards-related intellectual property rights? Who can access and use the standard, 
</p>
<p>once developed? Will the standard provide interoperability between competing 
</p>
<p>products? The degree of openness in standards has effects on technical interoper-
</p>
<p>ability and cultural innovation and also has significant political implications.
</p>
<p> Design decisions underlying standards sometimes also are decisions about indi-
</p>
<p>vidual privacy, property rights, and public access to government documents. The 
</p>
<p>intellectual property arrangements underlying standards establish policy about the 
</p>
<p>economic competitiveness of certain markets, how innovation should proceed, and 
</p>
<p>what opportunities might exist for developing countries. As traditional barriers to 
</p>
<p>trade have diminished, standards are also emerging as alternative global trade bar-
</p>
<p>riers. Incompatible standards can prevent interoperability and access to knowledge,

<p>the global politics of interoperability 499
</p>
<p>as was the case when incompatible applications impeded communications dur-
</p>
<p>ing rescue and recovery efforts after the 2004 south Asian tsunami disaster.9 As 
</p>
<p>described in the Berkman Center&rsquo;s Roadmap for ICT Ecosystems, Thailand&rsquo;s govern-
</p>
<p>ment encountered difficulty obtaining vital information because various agencies 
</p>
<p>and nongovernmental organizations used software products based on incompatible 
</p>
<p>data and document formats. The incompatibility of standards that impeded disas-
</p>
<p>ter-response efforts helped to encourage the Thai government to make open-doc-
</p>
<p>ument standards a national priority.10 Furthermore, in a globally distributed infor-
</p>
<p>mation society, standards create scarce resources, such as radio-frequency bands 
</p>
<p>and IP addresses (Internet Protocol addresses) and make decisions about how these 
</p>
<p>resources are structured and allocated. Standards, once adopted, are an enduring 
</p>
<p>form of global public policy, but are developed primarily by private corporations, 
</p>
<p>rather than by those representing publics directly affected by these policies.
</p>
<p> This essay describes the challenges and opportunities that technical standards 
</p>
<p>present to access to knowledge, emphasizing the pronounced implications of stan-
</p>
<p>dards for developing countries. It also describes emerging responses from a variety 
</p>
<p>of stakeholders, including a nascent multistakeholder &ldquo;open standards movement&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>and government policies to procure technologies based on open standards.
</p>
<p>the a2k implications of standards
</p>
<p>Jack Balkin has described the access to knowledge movement (A2K) as &ldquo;a demand 
</p>
<p>of justice,&rdquo; as &ldquo;an issue of economic development and an issue of individual partic-
</p>
<p>ipation and liberty,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;about intellectual property,&rdquo; but &ldquo;also about far more 
</p>
<p>than that.&rdquo;11 This serves as a useful framework for forging connections between 
</p>
<p>technical standards and the goals of access to knowledge. From a purely techni-
</p>
<p>cal standpoint, common standards are designed to enable the exchange of infor-
</p>
<p>mation, while proprietary specifications are, in a correlative and pragmatic way, 
</p>
<p>designed to prevent, limit, or control the exchange of information.
</p>
<p> A completely proprietary standard is one that is developed and controlled by 
</p>
<p>a single company, is not available for others to develop interoperable and compet-
</p>
<p>ing products based on that standard, and results in single-vendor lock-in, mak-
</p>
<p>ing users dependent on a single source for a product. The closed specifications 
</p>
<p>historically underlying Microsoft&rsquo;s traditional Office products are an example of 
</p>
<p>a closed standard. The technical blueprints for formatting information are com-
</p>
<p>pletely proprietary. Other classic examples of closed specifications were those 
</p>
<p>underlying the proprietary on-line systems of the late 1980s and early 1990s&mdash;for 
</p>
<p>example, Prodigy, CompuServe, and America Online&mdash;before on-line service pro-
</p>
<p>viders expanded their services to more open Internet protocols. Analogously, the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>500
</p>
<p>dominant social networking sites of the early twenty-first century are based on 
</p>
<p>proprietary systems that prohibit the exchange of information between competing 
</p>
<p>social networking services.
</p>
<p> A completely open standard can be defined as one that is developed in an open 
</p>
<p>membership forum, that is made freely available to anyone interested in develop-
</p>
<p>ing products based on the standard with minimal intellectual property restrictions, 
</p>
<p>and that results in multiple competing products, interoperable services, and inno-
</p>
<p>vation based on the standard. An example of an open standard is TCP/IP, a group 
</p>
<p>of the Internet&rsquo;s underlying network protocols. In reality, most standards reside on 
</p>
<p>a continuum between completely proprietary and completely open. Depending on 
</p>
<p>the context, the extent of a standard&rsquo;s openness can have important political and 
</p>
<p>economic implications.
</p>
<p> This section describes three ways in which standards and the degree of open-
</p>
<p>ness in standards fit within an access to knowledge framework. Standards raise 
</p>
<p>issues of distributive justice when they create scarce resources necessary for 
</p>
<p>meaningful participation in the information society. They also have direct implica-
</p>
<p>tions for individual political participation and liberty in the information society. 
</p>
<p>Finally, they can create pronounced political and economic challenges for develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries.
</p>
<p>standards and distributive justice
</p>
<p>Many technical standards create and allocate the finite resources required for 
</p>
<p>access to information networks. How these resources are distributed and by 
</p>
<p>whom can raise issues of distributive justice. Some standards partition and allo-
</p>
<p>cate the radio-frequency spectrum among users&mdash;for example, broadcast stan-
</p>
<p>dards, Wi-Fi, and cellular standards. Others prioritize the flow of information over 
</p>
<p>a network based on the type of application being transmitted, such as prioritizing 
</p>
<p>voice applications and decelerating peer-to-peer video. Other standards divide up 
</p>
<p>orbital slots in satellite systems. Some assign rights of access to local broadband 
</p>
<p>services. Some, such as digital subscriber lines, provide an asymmetrical distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of bandwidth whereby downstream communications to users are privileged 
</p>
<p>over upstream communications from users to the network.
</p>
<p> The Internet Protocol (IP) standard is an exemplar of how standards create 
</p>
<p>finite resources necessary for access to information networks. IP is the central pro-
</p>
<p>tocol of the Internet. As Internet engineers have described it, if a device uses IP, it 
</p>
<p>is &ldquo;on the Internet.&rdquo; If it does not use IP, it is not on the Internet. One of the central 
</p>
<p>functions defined by this standard is Internet addressing. Every device exchanging 
</p>
<p>information over the Internet possesses a unique number (an IP address) identify-
</p>
<p>ing its virtual location, somewhat like a unique postal address identifying a home&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>denardis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>501
</p>
<p>unique physical location. The long-prevailing Internet address standard is called 
</p>
<p>IPv4,12 which originated in the early 1980s and specifies a unique 32-bit number 
</p>
<p>for each Internet address.13 This address length of 32 bits provides 232 or nearly 4.3 
</p>
<p>billion unique Internet addresses.
</p>
<p> In 1990, the Internet standards community identified the potential depletion of 
</p>
<p>these 4.3 billion addresses as a critical technical and political concern in the con-
</p>
<p>text of Internet globalization. U.S. institutions had received enormous IP address 
</p>
<p>allocations when the Internet was primarily an American enterprise, raising con-
</p>
<p>cerns that the remaining addresses might not meet emerging requirements of rapid 
</p>
<p>growth and new applications such as wireless Internet access and Internet tele-
</p>
<p>phony. The Internet standards community selected a new network protocol, IPv6,14 
</p>
<p>to expand the Internet address space. The new standard ultimately expanded the 
</p>
<p>address length from 32 to 128 bits for each address, supplying a staggering 2128 or 
</p>
<p>340 undecillion unique addresses.
</p>
<p> Upgrading to a new standard technically can not happen all at once, like flip-
</p>
<p>ping a switch. In the case of IPv6, it requires incremental software and hardware 
</p>
<p>upgrades within local Internet service provider (ISP) infrastructures, upgraded 
</p>
<p>end-user software, and the allocation of new IPv6 addresses. Interest in IPv6 in 
</p>
<p>the United States has been relatively limited, primarily because U.S. institutions 
</p>
<p>received ample IP addresses prior to Internet globalization. In contrast, govern-
</p>
<p>ments in India, China, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and elsewhere have con-
</p>
<p>sidered IPv6 a national priority, both as a solution to projected address shortages 
</p>
<p>and as an economic opportunity to develop new products and expertise in global 
</p>
<p>Internet markets.
</p>
<p> Even with the availability of the IPv6 standard to increase exponentially the 
</p>
<p>number of devices potentially able to connect to the Internet, questions of distrib-
</p>
<p>utive justice remain. The availability of a standard does not mean that the standard 
</p>
<p>will be implemented in products, and the availability of products does not mean 
</p>
<p>that products will be adopted in infrastructures. The long-anticipated upgrade to 
</p>
<p>IPv6 has not occurred to any great extent. It is difficult for citizens in parts of the 
</p>
<p>world with limited IPv4 addresses, such as Kenya and other parts of Africa, to ben-
</p>
<p>efit from new IPv6 addresses unless their local service providers upgrade network 
</p>
<p>infrastructures to handle IPv6 traffic. A scarcity of IPv4 addresses already limits 
</p>
<p>Internet access and slows the deployment of new Internet services requiring IP 
</p>
<p>addresses. Until service providers have market or public incentives to upgrade to 
</p>
<p>IPv6, this problem will remain. Additionally, the conservative momentum of IPv4 
</p>
<p>and associated lack of interest in IPv6 in dominant Internet markets such as the 
</p>
<p>United States have an effect on developing markets relying on IPv6. Some soft-
</p>
<p>ware and hardware innovators have limited incentives to develop new products

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>502
</p>
<p>based on IPv6 unless a critical mass of Internet users adopts the new standard.
</p>
<p> A related issue of distributive justice is the question of who should allocate the 
</p>
<p>scarce resources created by standards. In the case of the IP standard, this ques-
</p>
<p>tion has been a central controversy in Internet governance. Centralized control has 
</p>
<p>historically existed in the area of IP address allocation, in part to maintain the 
</p>
<p>architectural principle of globally unique addresses. Currently, regional institu-
</p>
<p>tions such as the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), the R&eacute;seaux 
</p>
<p>IP Europ&eacute;ens&ndash;Network Coordination Centre (RIPE-NCC), the Asia Pacific Network 
</p>
<p>Information Centre (APNIC), the Latin America and Caribbean Network Informa-
</p>
<p>tion Centre (LACNIC), and the African Network Information Centre (AfriNIC) allo-
</p>
<p>cate addresses. These organizations are not governmental bodies. They are paid-
</p>
<p>membership, nonprofit corporations that control addresses. Member institutions 
</p>
<p>consist primarily of Internet service providers, telecommunications companies, 
</p>
<p>and other large corporations in each respective region. One public policy question 
</p>
<p>involves the implications of organizations ultimately controlled by private compa-
</p>
<p>nies controlling the vital resources required for Internet participation.
</p>
<p> Despite the regional distribution of IP addresses, definitive control of the 
</p>
<p>entire address reserve, including the allocation of address resources to interna-
</p>
<p>tional registries, has remained centralized and is currently an administrative func-
</p>
<p>tion within ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, 
</p>
<p>a private entity incorporated in California and traditionally overseen by the U.S. 
</p>
<p>Commerce Department. International concerns have centered on questions about 
</p>
<p>ICANN, retaining this Internet governance authority and control over global 
</p>
<p>resources, as opposed to distributing control to an international entity.
</p>
<p> The central function of the IP standard is the definition of the length and 
</p>
<p>therefore the number of available IP addresses. The question of who controls the 
</p>
<p>scarce resources created by such standards is a critical one. In a global Internet 
</p>
<p>economy, control over standards and the scarce resources they can create increas-
</p>
<p>ingly determines wealth. The citizens in countries with greater control over the 
</p>
<p>development and adoption of standards and the scarce resources created by stan-
</p>
<p>dards have distinct advantages in opportunities to access knowledge-embedded 
</p>
<p>tools, to innovate, and to produce and control information.
</p>
<p>standards, individual liberty, and participation
</p>
<p>Standards also can have direct policy implications related to civil liberties and 
</p>
<p>democratic processes.15 The content of standards can determine the extent of 
</p>
<p>individual civil liberties such as user privacy. For example, in developing the IPv6 
</p>
<p>standard, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) faced a design decision about 
</p>
<p>whether a virtual Internet address should incorporate a physical address, such 
</p>
<p>denardis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>503
</p>
<p>as the number associated with a computer&rsquo;s network interface card. This linkage 
</p>
<p>between software-defined and physical addresses would create an environment 
</p>
<p>in which information transmitted over the Internet could potentially be associated 
</p>
<p>with a citizen&rsquo;s computer and therefore with a citizen&rsquo;s identity and physical loca-
</p>
<p>tion. Internet engineers, rather than elected officials, faced policy questions about 
</p>
<p>location privacy and anonymity. Ultimately, privacy options were built into the 
</p>
<p>standard, but what are the implications of a standards-setting institution making 
</p>
<p>decisions about the public&rsquo;s civil liberties? Similar decisions about privacy arise 
</p>
<p>in the development of encryption standards and also in the development of elec-
</p>
<p>tronic health-care-information standards that make decisions about how citizens&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>health-care records are electronically exchanged.
</p>
<p> The degree of openness in document-format standards also has political impli-
</p>
<p>cations. To be digitally stored or exchanged, information (images, words, numbers, 
</p>
<p>video, and audio) must be converted into a digital format (encoded into 0s and 1s). 
</p>
<p>Examples of these formats include JPEG for images, MPEG for video, and MP3 for 
</p>
<p>audio. Office applications such as text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations 
</p>
<p>are encoded using document-format standards. If the standard is openly published 
</p>
<p>with minimal intellectual property restrictions, competing vendors can make soft-
</p>
<p>ware capable of creating or reading documents encoded in this common format. If 
</p>
<p>the document format is proprietary, citizens can exchange and read these docu-
</p>
<p>ments only if they use a specific software product.
</p>
<p> One way the public interest is implicated is when governments make elec-
</p>
<p>tronic public documents available in these proprietary formats. The archiving of 
</p>
<p>documents is a fundamental responsibility of democratic governments, and pub-
</p>
<p>lic access to these documents is essential for government accountability and for 
</p>
<p>deliberation over the efficacy of government institutions and policies. Using a 
</p>
<p>proprietary standard does not meet this obligation of democratic governments, 
</p>
<p>because it locks public documents in a format that requires citizens to use a par-
</p>
<p>ticular vendor&rsquo;s software, raises concerns about backward incompatibility and lack 
</p>
<p>of interoperability, and creates the possibility of public documents becoming inac-
</p>
<p>cessible in the future because the proprietary format is no longer supported.
</p>
<p> Technical standards have even greater democratic implications when involved 
</p>
<p>in processes of political authorization and representation, such as standards 
</p>
<p>related to electronic voting machines and electronic voter registration. Transpar-
</p>
<p>ency in these formal democratic processes is necessary for legitimacy and civic 
</p>
<p>trust in government. Vote tabulation processes have historically been available 
</p>
<p>for public scrutiny, with volunteers gathering in a room and scrutinizing elec-
</p>
<p>tion ballots. The question of whether standards for electronic voting tabulations 
</p>
<p>and information exchange are open for viewing, as well as in a format that can

</p>
<p>be readily inspected, raises political concerns.16 The substance of democracy in 
</p>
<p>the modern information society extends beyond formal democratic processes of 
</p>
<p>political representation to the informal interactions of civil society and culture.17 
</p>
<p>Technical standards that empower, rather than restrict society&rsquo;s ability to interact, 
</p>
<p>produce, and inquire within their community&rsquo;s cultural horizon may significantly 
</p>
<p>impact conditions of democracy. Open technical standards such as HTML and TCP/
</p>
<p>IP, which have been freely available to access and use, have provided citizens with 
</p>
<p>the tools to contribute to discursive political spheres and to promote creative inno-
</p>
<p>vation and collaboration.
</p>
<p> In these cases, the question of who sets technical standards is highly relevant. 
</p>
<p>Power over these standards is not restricted to market power but the ability to make 
</p>
<p>decisions directly impacting the citizens who use technologies. This form of public 
</p>
<p>policy is not established by democratic, representative government mechanisms or 
</p>
<p>with public input, but by private actors. The more open a standard&rsquo;s development 
</p>
<p>process, the greater the legitimacy of its effects on the public interest. One problem

</p>
<p>is that the technical nature of ICT standards usually precludes significant public par-
</p>
<p>ticipation, but processes that include participatory openness, information transpar-
</p>
<p>ency, and public-document availability enable some public-interest input into the 
</p>
<p>setting of standards. Organizations with open-membership policies at least allow for 
</p>
<p>the possibility of public participation. Transparency in proceedings and mailing lists 
</p>
<p>provides some accountability for decisions. A publicly available standard provides a 
</p>
<p>level playing field for competition that can maximize user product choices and the 
</p>
<p>ability of citizens to create innovative products based on the standard.
</p>
<p> Openness is not a given, but a matter of choice. In reality, the degree of open-
</p>
<p>ness in standards-setting institutions varies considerably by organization. Maxi-
</p>
<p>mal openness is important, because it increases the ability of the public to affect 
</p>
<p>decisions on standards that determine civil liberties and the ability of citizens to 
</p>
<p>engage in other democratic processes.
</p>
<p>standards and developing countries
</p>
<p>Information and communication standards are a basic requirement for the dif-
</p>
<p>fusion of information and communication technologies in the developing world, 
</p>
<p>as well as in the so-called developed world.18 However, the underlying intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property arrangements of ICT standards do not necessarily reflect the 
</p>
<p>political and economic interests of developing countries. Developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries are both producers and users of information and communication technolo-
</p>
<p>gies, but encounter unique standards-related intellectual property rights and  
</p>
<p>institutional barriers.
</p>
<p> The Internet&rsquo;s protocols have historically been openly available for use with 
</p>
<p>minimal intellectual property restrictions, a characteristic that has contributed to 
</p>
<p>the Internet&rsquo;s rapid innovation and global growth. However, the Internet&rsquo;s intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights environment has become increasingly complex. The number 
</p>
<p>of standards related to access and the creation of information has increased over 
</p>
<p>time as the Internet has expanded from text to multimedia applications (video, 
</p>
<p>audio, images) and as the types of devices connected to the Internet (cell phones, 
</p>
<p>consumer electronics, laptops) have expanded. Furthermore, an average Internet- 
</p>
<p>connected device, such as a mobile phone, provides multiple functions such 
</p>
<p>as voice, Internet browsing, text messaging, digital imaging, and video record-
</p>
<p>ing and can include literally hundreds of embedded technical standards. Most of 
</p>
<p>these standards are established within institutions dominated by private corpora-
</p>
<p>tions with significant economic interest in the selection of standards. The building 
</p>
<p>blocks of information exchange, such as image formats, video encoding standards, 
</p>
<p>audio compression standards, network protocols, and office application formats, 
</p>
<p>are standards with deeply embedded intellectual property rights.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>506
</p>
<p> These complexities have pronounced effects on developing countries, which 
</p>
<p>are typically late entrants in both the development of standards and the manufac-
</p>
<p>turing of ICT products based on these standards. Unlike large Western companies, 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurs in developing countries and other new entrants are not well versed 
</p>
<p>in the traditions of standards-setting institutions. In addition, they do not neces-
</p>
<p>sarily have the large legal departments to deal with intellectual property rights, 
</p>
<p>do not have existing patent portfolios, and do not have a history of engaging in 
</p>
<p>cross-licensing agreements with other companies.19 Andy Updegrove describes the 
</p>
<p>problem as &ldquo;standards based neocolonialism&rdquo;: &ldquo;Royalty bearing patent claims are 
</p>
<p>embedded in the standards for products such as DVD players and cellular phones. 
</p>
<p>If the royalties are high enough, the patent owners can have such products built in 
</p>
<p>emerging countries using cheap local labor, and sell them there and globally under 
</p>
<p>their own brands. Meanwhile, emerging company manufacturers can&rsquo;t afford to 
</p>
<p>build similar products at all.&rdquo;20
</p>
<p> Developing countries, as later entrants in the information society, bear a 
</p>
<p>greater burden in paying royalty payments to participate in its cultural and eco-
</p>
<p>nomic benefits and to deal with the increasing complexity of intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights. Furthermore, lack of disclosure of standards-based intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights presents a disincentive to innovate based on standards, only to face a pat-
</p>
<p>ent-infringement lawsuit at some later date. The implication is that the increasing 
</p>
<p>complexity of intellectual property rights discourages developing countries and 
</p>
<p>other later ICT entrants from innovating and competing in product markets based 
</p>
<p>on the standards necessary for participating in global information infrastructures.
</p>
<p> Even when developing countries are able to become involved in standards set-
</p>
<p>ting, institutional and cultural barriers exist. There are hundreds of standards-set-
</p>
<p>ting organizations, but few norms about who can participate and how standards are 
</p>
<p>set. The legitimacy of the development of Internet standards has always derived in 
</p>
<p>part from its participatory and open institutional approach, but some organizations 
</p>
<p>that set essential standards have closed membership policies and scant informa-
</p>
<p>tion transparency. Barriers can exist even in organizations such as IETF that are 
</p>
<p>completely open to public participation. Participation requires money. Individuals 
</p>
<p>involved in standards setting are funded by their employers. Smaller companies 
</p>
<p>or individual citizens do not necessarily have the resources necessary to fund the 
</p>
<p>time commitment required to participate in these activities or to fund travel to in-
</p>
<p>person meetings. The technological expertise required to participate in working 
</p>
<p>groups also creates challenges for those joining the process as later entrants.
</p>
<p> Relatively closed standards also have pronounced effects on developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries as users of information and communication technologies. Costs and restric-
</p>
<p>tions produced by standards-related intellectual property rights are ultimately 
</p>
<p>denardis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>507
</p>
<p>passed to users. This has disproportional effects on countries lacking the ICT infra-
</p>
<p>structure inherent in the West. Countries with an installed base of fiber-optic and 
</p>
<p>copper backbone infrastructures view broadband wireless technologies such as 
</p>
<p>GSM (global system for mobile communications), Wi-Fi, and WiMax (worldwide 
</p>
<p>interoperability for microwave access, a wireless communications technology) 
</p>
<p>as &ldquo;access technologies&rdquo; that connect users to the backbone. In countries with-
</p>
<p>out backbone infrastructures, these technologies potentially serve as both back-
</p>
<p>bone and access mechanisms. GSM, Wi-Fi, and WiMax are standards with signifi-
</p>
<p>cant embedded intellectual property rights. For example, WiMax is an emerging 
</p>
<p>standard for metropolitan broadband wireless Internet access. Implementing this 
</p>
<p>standard in a new product requires licensing numerous patents owned by vari-
</p>
<p>ous technology companies. The burden of the escalation in standards-based intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights is borne to a greater extent by those without an installed 
</p>
<p>infrastructure base.
</p>
<p> Even if products are manufactured in a developing country, that country often 
</p>
<p>must purchase these same products from Western companies. If the standards 
</p>
<p>embedded in these products are proprietary, this can create vendor lock-in, mini-
</p>
<p>mizing user product choice, competition, and associated cost reductions. Countries 
</p>
<p>that want global interoperability sometimes have no choice but to use prevailing 
</p>
<p>standards, which have a unique tenaciousness once adopted because of network 
</p>
<p>effects, institutional commitments, and vendor investments. For example, there 
</p>
<p>are not many alternatives except to use the Wi-Fi standard for wireless local area 
</p>
<p>network access and the MP3 and related standards for audio compression.
</p>
<p> The rise of intellectual property rights-laden ICT standards, for example, has 
</p>
<p>resulted in large emerging countries such as China developing some national stan-
</p>
<p>dards, rather than using globally interoperable standards. The World Trade Orga-
</p>
<p>nization&rsquo;s Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) asserts that standards 
</p>
<p>should not create unnecessary obstacles to trade, but ICT standards sometimes 
</p>
<p>serve as nontariff barriers in global markets.21 A response from China has been 
</p>
<p>the development of Chinese national standards such as WAPI (Wireless Local Area 
</p>
<p>Network Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure), the Chinese national stan-
</p>
<p>dard for wireless local area network encryption; and UOF (Unified Office Format), 
</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s document format for office applications.
</p>
<p> The result of such standards lock-ups is that the poorest countries cannot 
</p>
<p>move up the value chain and compete as ICT manufacturers, and the more techno-
</p>
<p>logically sophisticated and large developing countries have incentives to develop 
</p>
<p>national standards, potentially creating global incompatibility or national propri-
</p>
<p>etary infrastructures that can potentially isolate citizens from the larger global 
</p>
<p>information society.

</p>
<p>multistakeholder open-standards strategies
</p>
<p>The many issues and concerns described in the previous sections have led to calls 
</p>
<p>for greater promotion of open standards. However, the definition of &ldquo;open stan-
</p>
<p>dards&rdquo; is contestable. Many definitions exist,22 and various stakeholders are likely 
</p>
<p>to arrive at different, contextually specific definitions. Nevertheless, most defini-
</p>
<p>tions have some common denominators.
</p>
<p> First, to promote values of transparency and accountability and the possibil-
</p>
<p>ity of multiple stakeholder participation, the standards-development process 
</p>
<p>should be open to any interested party, should involve well-defined procedures, 
</p>
<p>and should make deliberations and working-group discussions publicly avail-
</p>
<p>able. As mentioned, the membership requirements, openness, and transparency 
</p>
<p>of standards-setting institutions vary considerably, with traditional Internet stan-
</p>
<p>dards-setting institutions such as the IETF providing the greatest openness and 
</p>
<p>with small consortia involving a handful of private companies typically the most 
</p>
<p>closed.23 Participatory openness and procedural and information transparency 
</p>
<p>provide a degree of legitimacy to organizations that establish policies through 
</p>
<p>technical standards.
</p>
<p> Second, the standards specification, the actual knowledge-embedded tool 
</p>
<p>necessary to develop products, is usually considered open if it is made publicly 
</p>
<p>available. Some open-standards definitions stipulate that there should be no fee 
</p>
<p>to access the standard, while others acknowledge that a fee may be necessary to 
</p>
<p>recoup some costs of developing and publishing the standard. An unpublished 
</p>
<p>standard is truly a proprietary standard that precludes the possibility of innova-
</p>
<p>tion based on the standard.
</p>
<p> Third, a standard is considered open if it is available on either a reasonable 
</p>
<p>and nondiscriminatory (RAND) basis or on a royalty-free basis. The IETF working 
</p>
<p>groups have always given preference to technologies with no known intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights claims or, if the technology has a claim, with royalty-free licensing. 
</p>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),24 citing the objective of promoting ubiq-
</p>
<p>uitous adoption of Web standards, has established a policy of issuing recommen-
</p>
<p>dations only if they can be implemented on a royalty-free basis, although there is 
</p>
<p>a mechanism for allowing exceptions.25 As mentioned, the Internet&rsquo;s underlying 
</p>
<p>protocols have historically been made available on a predominantly royalty-free 
</p>
<p>basis, a characteristic often cited as contributive to the Internet&rsquo;s rapid growth, 
</p>
<p>product innovations, and democratic participation.
</p>
<p> However, policies that mandate royalty-free standards can produce inadvertent 
</p>
<p>consequences, such as eliminating the possibility of using popular royalty-bearing 
</p>
<p>standards such as Wi-Fi and GSM. Conversely, RAND licensing policies are prob-
</p>
<p>lematic because of definitional ambiguities over the meaning of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>denardis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>509
</p>
<p>&ldquo;nondiscriminatory.&rdquo; RAND is a term commonly given by standards-setting insti-
</p>
<p>tutions to define their intellectual property rights policies, but, as Mark Lemley 
</p>
<p>has noted, most of these policies do not actually define what is meant by RAND. 
</p>
<p>This creates questions for companies interested in licensing a standard: Will intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights holders license universally or merely to other members of 
</p>
<p>the standards-setting institutions? And what actually constitutes a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>royalty fee? RAND licensing lacks a clear and consistent definition.
</p>
<p> Other definitions of open standards provide details about how well the stan-
</p>
<p>dard can be implemented by those developing products based on the standard, 
</p>
<p>whether the standard results in multiple competing implementations, and whether 
</p>
<p>the interests of a single corporation have dominated the process. For example, the 
</p>
<p>International Telecommunication Union&rsquo;s definition of openness says that the pro-
</p>
<p>cess should not be dominated by any one interest and that it should be written in 
</p>
<p>sufficient detail to facilitate developing of diverse, competing products that imple-
</p>
<p>ment the standard.26
</p>
<p> The definitions of an open standard vary depending on the stakeholders and 
</p>
<p>the cultural and political contexts involved, but definitions of openness share the 
</p>
<p>common framework of providing openness in development (membership, trans-
</p>
<p>parency, process), openness in implementation (public document availability, 
</p>
<p>RAND or royalty-free licensing), and openness in implementation (multiple com-
</p>
<p>peting implementations, user choice).
</p>
<p>the dynamic coalition on open standards
</p>
<p>One multistakeholder response has been the formation of the Dynamic Coalition 
</p>
<p>on Open Standards (DCOS) at the inaugural Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 
</p>
<p>held in Athens, Greece, in November 2006. The purpose of the IGF was to create a 
</p>
<p>formal space for multistakeholder policy dialogue to address public-policy issues 
</p>
<p>related to Internet governance, facilitate discourse among international Internet 
</p>
<p>governance institutions, and promote the engagement of stakeholders, particu-
</p>
<p>larly developing countries, in Internet governance mechanisms.27 The formation 
</p>
<p>of the IGF was in part a response to international concerns and perceptions of U.S. 
</p>
<p>control over ICANN. Therefore, a contentious topic at the IGF has been control 
</p>
<p>over ICANN domain-name functions, although ICANN members have not attended 
</p>
<p>the IGF to any great extent. IGF participants primarily have included governments, 
</p>
<p>nongovernmental organizations, academic institutions, corporations, and activists.
</p>
<p> One tangible development at the inaugural IGF meeting in Athens was the cre-
</p>
<p>ation of a number of mulitstakeholder &ldquo;dynamic coalitions.&rdquo; One of the first groups 
</p>
<p>to coalesce at the IGF was the Dynamic Coalition on Open Standards. While there 
</p>
<p>is no formal definition of the IGF dynamic coalitions, they are multistakeholder 
</p>
<p>the global politics of interoperability</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>510
</p>
<p>groups that self-form under the auspices of the IGF around Internet governance 
</p>
<p>topics. In addition to the open-standards coalition, other dynamic coalitions 
</p>
<p>address issues such as privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of the media 
</p>
<p>on the Internet, spam, an &ldquo;Internet Bill of Rights,&rdquo; and A2K generally. The mission 
</p>
<p>statement of DCOS declares: &ldquo;Our mission is to provide government policy makers 
</p>
<p>and other stakeholders with useful tools to make informed decisions to preserve 
</p>
<p>the current open architecture of the Internet and the World Wide Web, which 
</p>
<p>together provide a knowledge ecosystem that has profoundly shaped the multi-
</p>
<p>plier effect of global public goods and improved economic and social welfare.&rdquo;28
</p>
<p> The purpose of DCOS has been to frame and define the most pressing global 
</p>
<p>problems related to open technical standards, to offer recommendations for pro-
</p>
<p>moting principles of openness and interoperability, and particularly to address 
</p>
<p>best practices in government policy and procurement practices related to the 
</p>
<p>promotion of open Internet standards. DCOS was formed by stakeholders repre-
</p>
<p>senting governments (for example, Sri Lanka and Republic of South Africa), stan-
</p>
<p>dards organizations (for example, the World Wide Web Consortium), industry (for 
</p>
<p>example, Sun Microsystems, Free Software Foundation Europe), civil society (for 
</p>
<p>example, Knowledge Ecology International, IP Justice, the South Centre), and aca-
</p>
<p>demia and learning institutions (for example, the Yale Information Society Project, 
</p>
<p>Bibliotheca Alexandrina, and United Nations University).
</p>
<p> One outcome of the dynamic coalition&rsquo;s formation appears to have been to 
</p>
<p>advance the dialogue on open standards, especially among stakeholders in the 
</p>
<p>Global South and within the IGF discourse generally. In the Internet governance 
</p>
<p>community, perceptions about &ldquo;open standards&rdquo; have progressed from viewing it 
</p>
<p>as an arcane technical issue to accepting it as a mainstream issue of significant 
</p>
<p>global policy importance. This has been the case even in the IGF community. At the 
</p>
<p>second annual IGF, held in 2007 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the issue of open stan-
</p>
<p>dards was a pervasive theme, beginning with the opening session and continu-
</p>
<p>ing with three open-standards workshops, including one addressing government 
</p>
<p>policies on open standards, and a broad &ldquo;openness&rdquo; session which, among other 
</p>
<p>things, highlighted the development dimension of open standards
</p>
<p>government open-standards policies
</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the Dynamic Coalition on Open Standards has been to 
</p>
<p>promote open Internet standards in government policy and procurement prac-
</p>
<p>tices. As a response to technical, economic, and political concerns about the degree 
</p>
<p>of openness in global ICT standards, governments have increasingly established 
</p>
<p>policies addressing these issues. Governments have several potential avenues 
</p>
<p>for intervention, including development, regulation, and procurement. They can 
</p>
<p>denardis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>511
</p>
<p>become directly involved in the development of standards by participating in 
</p>
<p>standards-setting processes, mandating the development of certain standards, or 
</p>
<p>funding companies to design specific standards. Governments also have the option 
</p>
<p>of directly regulating which standards, and how standards, must be used within 
</p>
<p>products used by publics. Finally, governments, as large users of ICT products, can 
</p>
<p>exert market influence through procurement policies.
</p>
<p> Of the three options, this procurement mechanism provides the lowest level 
</p>
<p>of government intervention and therefore has become the favored option of gov-
</p>
<p>ernments seeking to promote open standards. Many governments believe that 
</p>
<p>the private sector, rather than government officials, most efficiently produces 
</p>
<p>ICT standards. Many also hesitate to mandate that the private sector and citizens 
</p>
<p>adopt specific standards.
</p>
<p> There have been numerous instances of governments establishing policies to 
</p>
<p>procure ICT products that adhere to principles of openness and interoperability. 
</p>
<p>Often called &ldquo;government interoperability frameworks&rdquo; (GIFs),29 open-standards 
</p>
<p>policies have been introduced by countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, 
</p>
<p>Brazil, China, Croatia, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Malaysia, New 
</p>
<p>Zealand, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
</p>
<p> As is evident from this list, open-standards policies are a phenomenon in both 
</p>
<p>the developed and the developing world. While definitions of what constitutes 
</p>
<p>an open standard differ, the overarching purpose of these government policies is 
</p>
<p>interoperability, the ability of government agencies to exchange information with 
</p>
<p>each other and with citizens, with open standards cited as the primary method for 
</p>
<p>achieving this interoperability.
</p>
<p> For example, the Brazilian federal government issued an interoperability pol-
</p>
<p>icy establishing the adoption of open standards for technology used within the 
</p>
<p>executive branch of the federal government. The Brazilian model is representative 
</p>
<p>of many open-standards policies. The Brazilian framework is limited to internal 
</p>
<p>government communications and information exchanges with citizens and specifi-
</p>
<p>cally states that the policies cannot be imposed on the private sector, on citizens, 
</p>
<p>or on government agencies outside of the federal government, although it does 
</p>
<p>request voluntary adherence to the standards. Additionally, the federal standards 
</p>
<p>policies apply to new purchases and upgrades to existing systems, rather than 
</p>
<p>mandating a complete changeover to new products. Like other open-standards 
</p>
<p>policies, Brazil&rsquo;s cites a combination of technical, political, and economic justifica-
</p>
<p>tions. Most policies express public-service rationales such as improving services 
</p>
<p>to citizens and avoiding locking users into a single vendor&rsquo;s products, technical 
</p>
<p>goals of inter operability and seamless information exchange between agen-
</p>
<p>cies, and economic goals of lowering costs, promoting economic competition and 
</p>
<p>the global politics of interoperability</p>

<p>innovation, and competing in global markets and exchanging information with  
</p>
<p>global trading partners.
</p>
<p> Brazil&rsquo;s definition of interoperability primarily addresses a standard&rsquo;s effects: 
</p>
<p>enabling multiple, competing technologies, creating the ability to exchange infor-
</p>
<p>mation among heterogeneous ICT environments, providing users with a product 
</p>
<p>choice, and preventing single-vendor lock-in. Principles of openness, choice, and 
</p>
<p>heterogeneity thus underlie this interoperability definition.30 The Brazilian frame-
</p>
<p>work also seems to embrace principles of transparency and participatory openness 
</p>
<p>by stating that interoperability policy documentation should be open to public 
</p>
<p>review with mechanisms for feedback. The underlying policy specifies a prefer-
</p>
<p>ence for the adoption of open standards within the federal government.31
</p>
<p> Brazil&rsquo;s interoperability framework makes specific recommendations for stan-
</p>
<p>dards that meet its requirements for openness and interoperability. Among the 
</p>
<p>numerous pages of recommended standards are well-established Internet proto-
</p>
<p>cols such as HTTP/1.1, SMTP/MIME, and TCP and UDP, popular document formats 
</p>
<p>such as RTF and PDF, and also newer and less entrenched open standards such as 
</p>
<p>the Open Document Format (ODF).
</p>
<p> Other government interoperability frameworks have similar elements. For 
</p>
<p>example, the objectives of Malaysia&rsquo;s interoperability framework are a response 
</p>
<p>to the need for different government systems (both hardware and software) to be 
</p>
<p>able to exchange information more expeditiously and cost effectively using open 
</p>
<p>standards &ldquo;that are vendor and product neutral&rdquo; than is possible using &ldquo;proprietary 
</p>
<p>alternatives.&rdquo;32 Where the interoperability frameworks differ is in their definitions 
</p>
<p>of open standards. The European Union&rsquo;s European Interoperability Framework for 
</p>
<p>Pan-European eGovernment Services was established to promote pan-European 
</p>
<p>electronic interoperability between technologies used by public administrators, 
</p>
<p>citizens, and corporations. The definition of open standards in the European frame-
</p>
<p>work describes an open standard as meeting the following minimum requirements: 
</p>
<p>It must be developed in an open decision-making process; the standard must be 
</p>
<p>published and available either freely or at minimal cost; and the intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty (e.g. patents) &ldquo;of (parts of) the standard is made irrevocably available on a 
</p>
<p>royalty-free basis.&rdquo;33 Many other open-standards policies do not require that stan-
</p>
<p>dards-based intellectual property be made irrevocably available on a royalty-free 
</p>
<p>basis, but may give preference to royalty-free standards where possible.
</p>
<p> The emergence of government procurement policies based on open standards, 
</p>
<p>as well as multistakeholder open-standards advocacy, are recent phenomena, so 
</p>
<p>the results remain to be seen, but these nascent government policies, influenced 
</p>
<p>by increasing multistakeholder activism in promoting technical openness, affirm 
</p>
<p>the increasing recognition of technical standards as a critical area for A2K and 
</p>

</p>
<p>reinforce the notion that standards have economic, legal, and political implications 
</p>
<p>beyond the merely technical. These policies are also one potential area of inter-
</p>
<p>vention for developing countries seeking to ameliorate some of the pronounced 
</p>
<p>challenges that restricted and proprietary standards present. Control over stan-
</p>
<p>dards and the ability to use standards as knowledge-embedded tools is about 
</p>
<p>politics, innovation, and creativity and ultimately about the ability to participate 
</p>
<p>effectively and equitably in the knowledge economy. For the access to knowledge 
</p>
<p>movement, open technical standards are a necessary precursor to achieving the 
</p>
<p>goals of distributive justice, economic development, and democratic participation 
</p>
<p>in the information society.

</p>
<p>Imagine that you are a visually impaired person who cannot read a traditional 
</p>
<p>book. You have identified a book you need to read for your business class and 
</p>
<p>hence will need to spend three hours scanning each page of the book to produce 
</p>
<p>an imperfect optical character recognition (OCR) file that can be read aloud by 
</p>
<p>text-to-speech software. You will not only produce an error-filled copy of the 
</p>
<p>book you seek to read, but will also have no legal way of sharing that OCR file 
</p>
<p>with proofreaders or with other disabled people who want to read the same book.1 
</p>
<p>To help solve this problem, in 2002, Benetech launched bookshare.org, which 
</p>
<p>allows print-disabled readers to share scanned books and eliminate these barriers.  
</p>
<p>Bookshare.org is now the world&rsquo;s largest on-line digital library for qualified print-
</p>
<p>disabled readers. However, there is one serious drawback: Only print-disabled 
</p>
<p>readers based in the United States can currently access Bookshare.org&rsquo;s full cata-
</p>
<p>logue of more than sixty thousand books. An exception in the U.S. copyright law 
</p>
<p>makes this possible. As Jim Fruchterman, founder and CEO of Benetech points out, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside the U.S., we stop relying on copyright exemptions. Today&rsquo;s piecemeal 
</p>
<p>national approach leads to a few countries with incompatible exemptions for the 
</p>
<p>disabled without an effective approach to cross-border sharing, forcing us to go 
</p>
<p>back to asking permission of the publisher or author to serve anybody outside our 
</p>
<p>country.&rdquo;2 So while new technologies make it possible to imagine a world where 
</p>
<p>visually impaired persons have access to a broad variety of knowledge, the out-of-
</p>
<p>date legal environment is a serious barrier.
</p>
<p> It is this, as well as many other problems of access to knowledge (A2K), that 
</p>
<p>the A2K movement set out to solve when it first came together several years ago. 
</p>
<p>In the following, I will focus on one of the major reform efforts currently pursued 
</p>
<p>by the A2K movement: the rebalancing of our copyright regime through the reform 
</p>
<p>of limitations and exceptions.3 I will highlight some of the major problems with 
</p>
<p>the current regime, then sketch the contours of the principal vision for reform&mdash;a

<p>proposed new international instrument dealing with minimum mandatory limita-

<p>tions and exceptions to copyright&mdash;and I will elaborate on how the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>is working to turn this vision into reality. I will also shed some light on the diverg-
</p>
<p>ing interests and heated debates characterizing this international reform effort.
</p>
<p>limitations and exceptions to copyright:  
the forgotten &ldquo;other half&rdquo; of the social contract
</p>
<p>As has been pointed out repeatedly, over the past two decades, and in particular 
</p>
<p>since the World Trade Organization&rsquo;s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Prop-
</p>
<p>erty Rights Agreement (the TRIPS Agreement) in 1994, we have witnessed a rapid 
</p>
<p>global expansion and upward harmonization of rights holders&rsquo; rights. Yet we have 
</p>
<p>not seen a comparable development of the rights of users and in particular of 
</p>
<p>limitations and exceptions to copyright. &ldquo;As a result, the international copyright 
</p>
<p>regime is less balanced than it has been at any one point in the past,&rdquo; concludes 
</p>
<p>Gwen Hinze from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.4
</p>
<p> This &ldquo;explosion of intellectual property rights&rdquo;5 means, for example, that in 
</p>
<p>many countries, the term of copyright protection has expanded from fifty to  
</p>
<p>seventy years after the death of the author&mdash;and even longer in some countries. 
</p>
<p>Protection is awarded to new subject matter such as computer programs and non-
</p>
<p>original databases. Rights holders can use technological protection measures to 
</p>
<p>control access and use by users, often overriding the limitations and exceptions 
</p>
<p>set out in the law. In addition, some countries&mdash;in particular, developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries&mdash;have not implemented the full range of limitations and exceptions avail-
</p>
<p>able to them under international law. As Consumers International has found in a 
</p>
<p>study in 2006,6 ten of eleven developing countries surveyed in Asia Pacific had 
</p>
<p>not, for example, incorporated teaching exceptions to the extent allowed by the 
</p>
<p>international copyright treaties. And none of the eleven developing countries 
</p>
<p>had taken advantage of all the limitations and exceptions available to them under 
</p>
<p>international law. This probably is at least in part due to the fact that developing 
</p>
<p>countries, when drafting national copyright laws, were often not fully aware of 
</p>
<p>the benefits of those exceptions to copyright. And while rights holders lobbied for 
</p>
<p>strong copyright protections, nobody was there to lobby for copyright flexibilities.
</p>
<p> As I think has quickly become clear, the current regime of limitations and 
</p>
<p>exceptions is an uneven patchwork, at best, and it is far from providing a coherent 
</p>
<p>global framework with the ability to match the increasingly globalized nature of 
</p>
<p>our digital communications networks. The social, cultural, and political, but also 
</p>
<p>economic costs are substantial. I began by mentioning the problems confronting 
</p>
<p>blind and visually impaired persons. Libraries are another constituency facing </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>limitations and exceptions to copyright 519
</p>
<p>serious challenges as they strive to preserve and make available our cultural and 
</p>
<p>scientific heritage. Appropriate exceptions for preservation, for example, are criti-
</p>
<p>cal and become all the more important in an age when formats and technologies are 
</p>
<p>constantly evolving, when the amount of content to preserve is growing exponen-
</p>
<p>tially, and when the original medium becomes increasingly fragile. For example, 
</p>
<p>the British Library has a 1964 speech by Nelson Mandela, recorded on Dictabelt, 
</p>
<p>for which the playback equipment is no longer available. Because in the UK the 
</p>
<p>exception for preservation under current law does not extend to sound recordings, 
</p>
<p>the British Library cannot make this speech available to the public.7 Also, libraries 
</p>
<p>cooperate in major cross-border digitization projects such as the i2010 European 
</p>
<p>Commission Digital Libraries Initiative and Europeana, a multilingual on-line col-
</p>
<p>lection of millions of digitized items from European museums, libraries, archives, 
</p>
<p>and multimedia collections. However, if preservation exceptions are different in 
</p>
<p>each country, libraries may not be able to participate equally in digitization proj-
</p>
<p>ects, placing the burden of digitization on those with more liberal regimes. As a 
</p>
<p>library representative pointed out, &ldquo;for financial and political reasons, this prob-
</p>
<p>ably means that the projects might fail. As a result, the material will effectively 
</p>
<p>disappear and the uniform access principle (UAP) cannot be upheld.&rdquo;8

</p>
<p> Businesses are running into similar problems. Think of the practice of image 
</p>
<p>search, a practice on which search engines heavily are relying. In the United 
</p>
<p>States, it is covered by fair use. In the European Union, it legal in some countries, 
</p>
<p>yet courts in other countries have declared that it constituted copyright infringe-
</p>
<p>ment. A harmonized regime of copyright exceptions would put an end to these 
</p>
<p>inconsistencies and encourage the development of these and other innovative ser-
</p>
<p>vices made accessible to global audiences.
</p>
<p> Given these challenges, critiques as well as reform proposals have been 
</p>
<p>advanced by many quarters over the last years. These include a proposal for &ldquo;a 
</p>
<p>balanced interpretation of the three-step test,&rdquo; a clause in the Berne Convention 
</p>
<p>for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1967) that imposes constraints 
</p>
<p>on the possible copyright limitations and exceptions under national law.9 Other 
</p>
<p>experts are calling for a &ldquo;reverse notice and take down&rdquo; regime that would allow 
</p>
<p>users to give copyright owners notice of their desire to make public-interest uses 
</p>
<p>of protected works and require rights holders to &ldquo;take down&rdquo; technological protec-
</p>
<p>tion measures on these works.10 Yet the principal vision driving the A2K reform 
</p>
<p>efforts at the moment is the idea of a new international instrument that would 
</p>
<p>mandate a minimum set of limitations and exceptions to copyright globally.
</p>
<p>proposed new international limitations and exceptions to copyright
</p>
<p>The idea behind a new global regime for copyright limitations and exceptions is to 
</p>
<p>match the minimum mandatory right of rights holders with a set of minimum man-
</p>
<p>datory rights of users and hence restore the balance originally enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>social contract called copyright law. However, instituting a global minimum man-
</p>
<p>datory regime for copyright exceptions raises complex legal questions. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, can current international law ever accommodate such a regime? A timely and 
</p>
<p>helpful study by P. Bernt Hugenholtz and Ruth L. Okediji concludes:
</p>
<p>despite an unmistakable &ldquo;ratcheting up&rdquo; of levels of copyright protection at the 
</p>
<p>international, regional and bilateral levels, enough &ldquo;wiggle room&rdquo; appears to be left 
</p>
<p>to the parties to the main copyright Conventions to make framing an international 
</p>
<p>instrument on L&amp;Es [limitations and exceptions] within the confines of the interna-
</p>
<p>tional acquis [the total body of international copyright law accumulated thus far] 
</p>
<p>a worthwhile exercise. Despite over a century of international norm setting in the 
</p>
<p>field of copyright, limitations and exceptions have largely remained &ldquo;unregulated 
</p>
<p>space.&rdquo; This is not to say, of course, that the international acquis is inherently bal-
</p>
<p>anced. What it does mean is that there is ample scope for rebalancing without hav-
</p>
<p>ing to deviate from the current acquis.11

</p>
<p> Hugenholtz and Okediji, who worked on this study with eight other leading 
</p>
<p>copyright scholars, provide some further thoughts on the shape of such an instru-
</p>
<p>ment, suggesting that it could take the form of a special agreement listing in an 
</p>
<p>exhaustive or enumerative manner those copyright limitations that are permitted 
</p>
<p>within the confines of the three-step test.12 They propose a special agreement with 
</p>
<p>provisions addressing three main issues: exclusion from protection; limits to eco-
</p>
<p>nomic rights; and limitations and exceptions proper, including both mandatory and 
</p>
<p>optional exceptions. Even though Hugenholtz and Okediji suggest including both 
</p>
<p>mandatory and optional exceptions, they are very clear about the disadvantages of 
</p>
<p>the optional approach, pointing to the European Union Information Society Direc-
</p>
<p>tive of 2001: &ldquo;The Directive&rsquo;s chapter on limitations and exceptions is . . . proof of 
</p>
<p>the draw-back of an optional approach towards limitations and exceptions. Of the 
</p>
<p>27 Member States of the European Union, not a single one has seen fit to imple-
</p>
<p>ment all the limitations and exceptions permitted under the Directive. In fact, the 
</p>
<p>actual harmonizing effect of the Directive has remained quite limited.&rdquo; And they 
</p>
<p>conclude that this situation is detrimental to the internal market that the European 
</p>
<p>Union is seeking to strengthen.13
</p>
<p> Hugenholtz and Okediji also put forward suggestions with regard to the actual 
</p>
<p>content of the new international instrument, proposing that it could include the 
</p>
<p>following clusters of limitations and exceptions: a cluster to address the needs of 
</p>
<p>vulnerable members of society, such as the visually impaired; a cluster to facilitate 
</p>
<p>the exercise of fundamental freedoms, such as free speech; a cluster of limitations 
</p>
<p>and exceptions that would safeguard the role of institutions charged with the pro-
</p>
<p>vision of public goods, such as educational institutions, libraries, and archives; and 
</p>
<p>last, but not least, a cluster that would address limitations and exceptions neces-
</p>
<p>sary to promote innovation, such as reverse engineering.14
</p>
<p> When developing this new international instrument, it seems clear that we 
</p>
<p>need to be ready to think outside the box. For example, self-expression on the 
</p>
<p>Internet often means &ldquo;remixing.&rdquo; In other words, while the current copyright 
</p>
<p>regime creates problems of access&mdash;in particular, when access is provided across 
</p>
<p>borders&mdash;it also creates problems for creators who, on the Internet, build on 
</p>
<p>the works of others and &ldquo;remix.&rdquo; As Lawrence Lessig has pointed out, &ldquo;It is now 
</p>
<p>anybody with access to a $1,500 computer that can take sounds and images and 
</p>
<p>use them to say things differently. These tools of creativity have become tools of 
</p>
<p>speech. And it is the literacy for the new generation. It is how our kids speak. It is 
</p>
<p>how our kids think. It is what our kids are.&rdquo;15 How can we ensure that a dominant 
</p>
<p>social practice driving today&rsquo;s creativity is not being criminalized and is instead 
</p>
<p>declared legal and even encouraged? How can we restore the legitimacy of copy-
</p>
<p>right law, in particular among the young? As the European Patent Office Scenarios 
</p>
<p>limitations and exceptions to copyright</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>522
</p>
<p>for the Future points out, one of the biggest current challenges for our intellectual 
</p>
<p>property regime is a serious crisis of legitimacy.16
</p>
<p> A new copyright exception for &ldquo;transformative use&rdquo; is one of the ideas put for-
</p>
<p>ward in this context. In fact, in 2006, the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property 
</p>
<p>introduced the idea of a new exception for transformative use, recommending that 
</p>
<p>the UK government call for the &ldquo;Directive 2001/29/EC to be amended to allow for 
</p>
<p>an exception for creative, transformative or derivative works, within the param-
</p>
<p>eters of the Berne three-step-test.&rdquo;17 The idea of such a new exception may be 
</p>
<p>useful to remedy the lack of flexibility of the regimes of copyright exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations based on an exhaustive list of strictly limited exceptions, such as the 
</p>
<p>European regime. And it would benefit on-line creativity, as well as the develop-
</p>
<p>ment of innovative on-line services. Some, for example, argue that a transforma-
</p>
<p>tive-use exception should also cover the activity of automatically transforming or 
</p>
<p>repurposing works with the sole purpose of allowing or improving user on-line 
</p>
<p>accessibility to these works on any platform.
</p>
<p>turning the vision into practice:  
the treaty for the visually impaired and beyond
</p>
<p>Aware of the A2K barriers caused by weak and incompatible limitations and 
</p>
<p>exceptions and armed with important insights and proposals provided by the aca-
</p>
<p>demic community, the A2K movement set out to reform international copyright 
</p>
<p>law. In what follows, I will outline how this movement worked to turn a vision into 
</p>
<p>reality, highlighting both progress and challenges.
</p>
<p> As detailed elsewhere in this book, in 2004, the A2K movement and developing-
</p>
<p>country governments initiated a major effort to reform WIPO.18 This spirit of change 
</p>
<p>blowing through the halls of WIPO has inspired the government of Chile to propose, 
</p>
<p>in November 2004, that WIPO include the subject of limitations and exceptions to 
</p>
<p>copyright on the agenda of one of its norm-setting committees, the Standing Com-
</p>
<p>mittee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR).19 A year later, Chile detailed its pro-
</p>
<p>posal suggesting three types of work that the SCCR could undertake in this area:
</p>
<p>1.  Identification . . . of national models and practices concerning exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations.
</p>
<p>2.  Analysis of the exceptions and limitations needed to promote creation and inno-
</p>
<p>vation and the dissemination of developments stemming therefrom.
</p>
<p>3.  Establishment of agreement on exceptions and limitations for purposes of public 
</p>
<p>interest that must be envisaged as a minimum in all national legislation for the 
</p>
<p>benefit of the community; especially to give access to the most vulnerable . . . 
</p>
<p>sectors.20
</p>
<p>franz</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>523
</p>
<p> With these proposals, the government of Chile not only provided unique lead-
</p>
<p>ership on the issue at WIPO, but also brought about a paradigm shift at this UN 
</p>
<p>agency. By putting limitations and exceptions on the agenda of a norm-setting 
</p>
<p>committee and calling for action, it planted a seed that I hope eventually will put 
</p>
<p>an end to the approach and even blind belief that WIPO had followed for so many 
</p>
<p>years: that more intellectual property protection is always better. Chile dared to 
</p>
<p>suggest that sometimes less can be more.
</p>
<p> Yet for the following three years, the limitations and exceptions item did not 
</p>
<p>much more than linger on the agenda of the SCCR. The SCCR was entirely focused 
</p>
<p>on the so-called Broadcast Treaty, a treaty that would provide broadcasters, cable-
</p>
<p>casters, and Webcasters with exclusive, copyrightlike privileges, creating an addi-
</p>
<p>tional layer of &ldquo;broadcast rights&rdquo; on top of existing copyright laws. Interestingly, 
</p>
<p>the discussions on the Broadcast Treaty provided a unique opportunity for the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement to build strategic alliances with industry. A2K groups worked with 
</p>
<p>U.S. information technology businesses such as AT&amp;T, Verizon Communications, 
</p>
<p>Intel, Hewlett-Packard, and others to oppose the proposed terms of the Broadcast 
</p>
<p>Treaty.21 The view that this alliance between industry and public-interest organiza-
</p>
<p>tions stopped the Broadcast Treaty is widely shared. The reason this alliance is pos-
</p>
<p>sible is that, simply put, both parties share the vision of the Internet as a competi-
</p>
<p>tive and innovative communications space where bits can flow as freely as possible.
</p>
<p> This type of coalition is important strategically: First, the A2K movement is 
</p>
<p>aware that alliances with industry can help move other agenda items, including the 
</p>
<p>one on limitations and exceptions to copyright. Second, these alliances reinforce 
</p>
<p>the movement&rsquo;s credibility, neutralizing allegations often made by rights holders 
</p>
<p>that it is &ldquo;anticapitalist&rdquo; or &ldquo;Communist.&rdquo; And third, these coalitions demonstrate 
</p>
<p>that industry is not a monolithic bloc. And policy makers sitting in Washington or 
</p>
<p>Brussels will come to understand that they serve their countries&rsquo; GDPs by promot-
</p>
<p>ing a more balanced approach to copyright.
</p>
<p> In June 2007, negotiations on the Broadcast Treaty broke down, and limitations 
</p>
<p>and exceptions to copyright, the next item on the agenda, finally moved up and 
</p>
<p>into the spotlight. At the SCCR meeting in March 2008, the governments of Brazil, 
</p>
<p>Chile, Nicaragua, and Uruguay presented a joint proposal that elaborated on the 
</p>
<p>Chilean proposal from 2005, calling upon WIPO to adopt a work plan to implement 
</p>
<p>the 2005 proposal. The reactions to the proposal ran the gamut from hot to cold, as 
</p>
<p>one observer put it.22 While many countries expressed general support, the United 
</p>
<p>States, on behalf of the developed countries at WIPO (Group B), opposed both the 
</p>
<p>analysis of limitations and exceptions needed to promote creativity and innova-
</p>
<p>tion (paragraph 2 of the proposal) and any WIPO norm-setting activity in the area 
</p>
<p>(paragraph 3). This position seemed paradoxical to some observers, given the fact 
</p>
<p>limitations and exceptions to copyright</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>524
</p>
<p>that domestically, the United States provides its users with relatively strong intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property flexibilities or user rights.
</p>
<p> When seeking consensus on the SCCR meeting&rsquo;s conclusions, one of several 
</p>
<p>dramatic moments unfolded: The United States took the floor to object to lan-
</p>
<p>guage that said that the SCCR as a whole &ldquo;underlined the need for speedy action 
</p>
<p>to improve access of visually impaired persons to protected works.&rdquo; It insisted that 
</p>
<p>the report say only that some or several delegations supported this. As an observer 
</p>
<p>noted, the effect of this objection was to deny an implied endorsement of the com-
</p>
<p>mittee to take action to assist the blind.23 As soon as the official meeting had ended, 
</p>
<p>Chris Friend from the World Blind Union approached the U.S. delegation, evidently 
</p>
<p>not happy with what had just happened. Directly confronted by a representative of 
</p>
<p>the community of the blind, the United States could maintain its position only with 
</p>
<p>difficulty. What transpired after an informal conversation was that the U.S. dele-
</p>
<p>gation declared that it would need more evidence for the need of an international 
</p>
<p>instrument and that at this point it would neither support nor object to it.
</p>
<p> In October 2008, the World Blind Union (WBU) increased pressure on gov-
</p>
<p>ernments to act by publishing an actual draft text for a Treaty for Blind, Visu-
</p>
<p>ally Impaired and Other Reading Disabled Persons (TVI). The WBU estimates 
</p>
<p>that around one hundred and twenty countries don&rsquo;t currently have limitations 
</p>
<p>and exceptions for the blind in their national laws.24 Also of particular concern is 
</p>
<p>the fact that the current regimes of limitations and exceptions do not permit the 
</p>
<p>import and export of accessible works. Accordingly, the two main features of the 
</p>
<p>proposed treaty are &ldquo;(1) to provide a minimum standard for limitations and excep-
</p>
<p>tions for the blind and visually impaired, and (2) to allow and encourage the import 
</p>
<p>and export of works in accessible formats.&rdquo; 25 The basic structure of the proposal is 
</p>
<p>a two-tiered set of limitations and exceptions to the rights of copyright owners.
</p>
<p>Non-profit institutions would have the right to publish and distribute works in 
</p>
<p>accessible formats if four conditions were met: (a) The person or organization wish-
</p>
<p>ing to undertake any activity under this provision has lawful access to that work 
</p>
<p>or a copy of that work; (b) the work is converted to an accessible format, which 
</p>
<p>may include any means needed to navigate information in the accessible format, 
</p>
<p>but does not introduce changes other than those needed to make the work acces-
</p>
<p>sible to a visually impaired person; (c) copies of the work are supplied exclusively 
</p>
<p>to be used by visually impaired persons; (d) and the activity is undertaken on a 
</p>
<p>non-profit basis. The Treaty proposal also provides for more limited exceptions for 
</p>
<p>commercial publishers.26
</p>
<p> While many developing countries are supportive, the European Union remains 
</p>
<p>opposed to the treaty at the time of writing. The United States, however, has 
</p>
<p>franz</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>525
</p>
<p>softened its resistance. In fact, at the SCCR meeting in December 2009, the U.S. 
</p>
<p>delegation delivered what some call a historic intervention,27 abandoning its push 
</p>
<p>for an unbalanced intellectual property regime: &ldquo;We [the United States] recognize 
</p>
<p>that some in the international copyright community believe that any interna-
</p>
<p>tional consensus on substantive limitations and exceptions to copyright law would 
</p>
<p>weaken international copyright law. The United States does not share that point 
</p>
<p>of view. The United States is committed to both better exceptions in copyright law 
</p>
<p>and better enforcement of copyright law.&rdquo;28 This statement gives hope that prog-
</p>
<p>ress is possible. But as is often the case in international negotiations, all is in flux, 
</p>
<p>and the outcome at this point is unclear.
</p>
<p> One of the critical open questions is whether any new international &ldquo;consen-
</p>
<p>sus&rdquo; on strengthening limitations and exceptions will actually take the form of a 
</p>
<p>binding instrument. The U.S. statement leaves this highly important point open. 
</p>
<p>Yet any solution that promotes a voluntary approach will not solve one of the key 
</p>
<p>problems that this reform effort set out to solve&mdash;the need to make limitations and 
</p>
<p>exceptions compatible throughout the world. The European Union, with its menu 
</p>
<p>of thirteen optional exceptions that European Union member states can choose to 
</p>
<p>adopt&mdash;serves as an example that WIPO should not follow. As Okediji and Hugen-
</p>
<p>holtz point out, the optional approach did little to harmonize the European regime 
</p>
<p>and &ldquo;has left Europe with a patchwork of incompatible limitations and exceptions, 
</p>
<p>causing legal uncertainty to the detriment of commercial providers of cross-border 
</p>
<p>services, such as online music stores, and of cultural institutions, such as libraries, 
</p>
<p>archives, public broadcasters, offering content across Europe.&rdquo;29
</p>
<p> Also, rights holders argue that voluntary licenses rather than statutory rights 
</p>
<p>enshrined in law will help to rebalance the copyright regime. For example, publish-
</p>
<p>ers made a counterproposal to the Treaty for Blind, Visually Impaired and Other 
</p>
<p>Reading Disabled Persons by proposing a so-called WIPO Stakeholder Platform.30 
</p>
<p>The platform would help to solve the access crisis on a voluntary basis by trans-
</p>
<p>ferring licensed material in accessible formats across jurisdictions. The platform 
</p>
<p>also is supposed to develop more accessible publishing processes.31 While this is a 
</p>
<p>welcome initiative, it is important to understand that it is not a replacement for a 
</p>
<p>treaty such as the Treaty for Blind, Visually Impaired and Other Reading Disabled 
</p>
<p>Persons. As Knowledge Ecology International points out, nobody can honestly 
</p>
<p>argue that all books will be provided by all rights holders to all reading-disabled 
</p>
<p>people on a voluntary basis in the foreseeable future. For the many instances 
</p>
<p>where the rights holder&rsquo;s files cannot be obtained, national and international law 
</p>
<p>needs to provide for organizations of reading-disabled people to make and share 
</p>
<p>accessible copies. This provision is not currently in place.32 Voluntary licensing is 
</p>
<p>also put forward by the European Commission in a recent Green Paper as an option 
</p>
<p>limitations and exceptions to copyright</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>526
</p>
<p>for addressing the shortcomings of the current regime of limitations and excep-
</p>
<p>tions to copyright.33 Again, the problem with any voluntary licensing regime is 
</p>
<p>that the terms of the license are determined by the copyright owner, and the copy-
</p>
<p>right owner always has the option of not providing a license and hence denying 
</p>
<p>access. A voluntary license is very different from a statutory right guaranteed to 
</p>
<p>users by law. Also, in several cases, rights holders may be difficult to identify or to 
</p>
<p>locate, and hence obtaining a voluntary license will be impossible.
</p>
<p> Finally, can the vision of an international minimum mandatory regime be 
</p>
<p>defended and moved forward as an omnibus solution? Or does one &ldquo;cut the vision 
</p>
<p>up&rdquo; and move the different pieces&mdash;such as the Treaty for the Visually Impaired&mdash;
</p>
<p>forward when and if doing so is politically feasible? As every activist knows, the 
</p>
<p>world looks different to the visionary than to the activist in the trenches. And a 
</p>
<p>vision doesn&rsquo;t tell you much about the appropriate strategy and tactics for making 
</p>
<p>this vision a reality. But knowing the A2K movement, I am confident it will play 
</p>
<p>its cards right, keeping the vision alive while focusing on possible wins that will 
</p>
<p>provide concrete solutions to real problems.
</p>
<p>conclusion
</p>
<p>A regime of strengthened, harmonized limitations and exceptions to copyright is 
</p>
<p>critically important for several reasons. It would make our intellectual property 
</p>
<p>system fit for a global information society and economy, because it would foster 
</p>
<p>cultural, educational, and economic activity across borders. It could also help to 
</p>
<p>clarify and harmonize the interpretation of individual limitations and exceptions. 
</p>
<p>Importantly for developing countries, it would alleviate the institutional weakness 
</p>
<p>of states that need the diffusion of access to knowledge most. And from a strate-
</p>
<p>gic point of view, it would be able to rebalance our current copyright regime, in 
</p>
<p>which the powers at the negotiating table are most unequal, as in bilateral trade 
</p>
<p>negotiations. A minimum mandatory regime of limitations and exceptions cannot 
</p>
<p>be negotiated away. Also, such a regime would be a badly needed response to the 
</p>
<p>aggressive intellectual property enforcement agenda currently being negotiated, 
</p>
<p>for example in the form of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. One could 
</p>
<p>even argue that a strong regime of limitations and exceptions is a sine qua non for 
</p>
<p>any new intellectual property enforcement regime and would in turn make any 
</p>
<p>intellectual property enforcement agenda more acceptable.
</p>
<p> Whether WIPO or any other policy forum will be able to deliver and 
</p>
<p>actively rebalance our copyright regime remains to be seen. WIPO certainly is 
</p>
<p>under pressure to deliver and it should seize the moment. After many years 
</p>
<p>of failed negotiations, it could prove its renewed relevance in the space of 
</p>
<p>franz</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>527
</p>
<p>international intellectual property norm setting by moving the copyright flexibilities  
</p>
<p>agenda forward.
</p>
<p> But the challenges are huge. Rights holders are fighting back, and the fact that 
</p>
<p>some of them have deep pockets and will command armies of lobbyists to descend 
</p>
<p>upon WIPO makes this a risky endeavor. The larger the vision, the more is at stake 
</p>
<p>and the more one can lose. But not fighting this fight might be the biggest risk of all.
</p>
<p> In fact, in this struggle over the future of our copyright regime much more than 
</p>
<p>the rights of the blind, or the library user, or the remix artist is at stake. This is a 
</p>
<p>fight about the future of our digital communications networks&mdash;the networks that 
</p>
<p>we use to learn, speak, advocate, discover, create, and love. There is some truth 
</p>
<p>to what James Boyle said back in 2005: &ldquo;We probably would not create the World 
</p>
<p>Wide Web, or any technology like it, today. In fact, we would be more likely to crip-
</p>
<p>ple it, or declare it illegal. . . What would a web designed by the World Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property Organisation or the Disney Corporation have looked liked? It would have 
</p>
<p>looked more like pay-television.&rdquo;34 The A2K movement is here to avert this future.

</p>
<p>Since 2002, a series of proposals to make radical changes in the approaches to 
</p>
<p>financing the development of new medicines and vaccines have been advanced 
</p>
<p>in various arenas by various actors, including NGOs and activists, country rep-
</p>
<p>resentatives, and academics, all in some ways participating in the A2K dynamic. 
</p>
<p>The proposals feature deep reforms of the system of incentives to reward success-
</p>
<p>ful drug development, expand access to knowledge, and allow greater freedom to 
</p>
<p>undertake follow-on research.
</p>
<p> As with other advocacy movements, the advancement of proposals proceeded 
</p>
<p>concurrently on two tracks and in several arenas, which we will here abbreviate 
</p>
<p>as the political and technical tracks, though needless to say, these were neces-
</p>
<p>sarily tightly interwoven. On the political track, policy discussions have evolved 
</p>
<p>from &ldquo;We have an intractable crisis in health R&amp;D for poor people in poor coun-
</p>
<p>tries&rdquo; to &ldquo;Actually, there is a way out&mdash;how can we implement radically new solu-
</p>
<p>tions?&rdquo; On the technical track, scenarios and models for these radical reforms 
</p>
<p>have been introduced, teased out, and developed into specific proposals. In 
</p>
<p>particular, these proposals have involved incentives in the form of prizes for 
</p>
<p>research and development in the area of medicines needed in and by the devel-
</p>
<p>oping world. This approach promises to achieve the goal of breaking the link in 
</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry between incentives to research and development 
</p>
<p>and product prices, one of the principle barriers to access to medicines world-
</p>
<p>wide. In what follows, we lay out the timelines along which the movement for 
</p>
<p>access to medicines has made progress along these two tracks and then discuss 
</p>
<p>a range of alternative options for delinking R&amp;D and drug prices, along with the 
</p>
<p>arguments in favor of these options as efficient strategies for the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>to promote.

</p>
<p>the timeline of the political track
</p>
<p>Getting access to medicines on the agenda at all was the principal task under-
</p>
<p>taken by those who worked along the political track. Strategies and ideas to pro-
</p>
<p>mote alternatives to the current system to finance the research and development 
</p>
<p>of medical innovations began to take shape in 2003, following several years of 
</p>
<p>intense, behind-the-scenes discussions by experts brought together by the global 
</p>
<p>NGO health-policy community keen to act to resolve the crisis in access to medi-
</p>
<p>cines. These discussions triggered a partial relocation of the debate from the World 
</p>
<p>Trade Organization (WTO) to the World Heath Organization (WHO).1 Until 2002, 
</p>
<p>there had been both political and technical resistance to discussion of intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property issues related to health at the WHO. A curious feature of the debate 
</p>
<p>up to that point, and one that would continue to accompany the discussions for 
</p>
<p>many years to come, was that it was somehow perfectly legitimate for policy mak-
</p>
<p>ers in the areas of trade and intellectual property to bring health-related issues 
</p>
<p>to the center of their work, but totally illegitimate for the WHO, which holds the 
</p>
<p>global mandate for public health, to discuss the effects of intellectual property on  
</p>
<p>health worldwide.
</p>
<p> A sea change occurred in 2003. In May that year, the Fifty-Sixth World Health 
</p>
<p>Assembly passed Resolution 56.27 establishing the Commission on Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property Rights, Innovation, and Public Health (CIPIH) to examine the links 
</p>
<p>between those three issues and particularly to assess the effect of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property regimes on access to health care in poor countries and to make recom-
</p>
<p>mendations for action. The establishment of the CIPIH was in turn the result of 
</p>
<p>a previous commission, the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights (CIPR), 
</p>
<p>which had been established by the then UK Secretary for Development Clare Short 
</p>
<p>to examine the links between the enforcement of intellectual property rights and 
</p>
<p>access to health care in developing countries. The report issued by this commission 
</p>
<p>was seminal and highly influential in bringing the debate on intellectual property 
</p>
<p>in issues affecting health into the global health-policy arena.
</p>
<p> A key issue that the CIPR brought to the attention of the global health-policy 
</p>
<p>community, and one that access-to-knowledge advocates had been attempting 
</p>
<p>to raise without much resonance until then, was that not only does the manner 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property rights enforcement hamper access to medicines and in so 
</p>
<p>doing undermine the right to health, but by placing severe restraints on the cir-
</p>
<p>culation of knowledge, it severely constrains the capacity of research scientists 
</p>
<p>to advance the development of badly needed remedies for all diseases. This is 
</p>
<p>both vexing in itself and particularly aggravating for diseases affecting the poor. 
</p>
<p>The CIPR report played an important role in bringing together the movements 
</p>
<p>for access to medicines and access to knowledge. It importantly also played a role </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>new medicines and vaccines 533
</p>
<p>in mobilizing the research-science community to act as advocates in the area of 
</p>
<p>global health policy.
</p>
<p> In February 2005, a group of 162 scientists, economists, doctors, public-health 
</p>
<p>experts, members of Parliament, and other experts sent a letter to the WHO Exec-
</p>
<p>utive Board and to the CIPIH requesting an evaluation of proposals for a medical 
</p>
<p>research-and-development treaty. In their letter, the experts laid out the argu-
</p>
<p>ments for a paradigm change:
</p>
<p>The current global framework for supporting medical R&amp;D suffers from profound 
</p>
<p>flaws. A growing web of multilateral, regional, bilateral and unilateral trade agree-
</p>
<p>ments and policies focus nearly exclusively on measures that expand the scope and 
</p>
<p>power of intellectual property rights, or reduce the effectiveness of price negotia-
</p>
<p>tions or controls.
</p>
<p> These mechanisms are plainly designed to increase drug prices, as the sole 
</p>
<p>mechanism to increase investments in R&amp;D. Stronger intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>and high drug prices do create incentives to invest in medical innovation, but also 
</p>
<p>impose costs, including:
</p>
<p> 1. problems of rationing and access to medicine,
</p>
<p> 2. costly, misleading and excessive marketing of products,
</p>
<p> 3. barriers to follow-on research,
</p>
<p> 4.  skewing of investment toward products that offer little or no therapeutic   
</p>
<p>advance over existing treatments, and
</p>
<p> 5. scant investment in treatments for the poor, basic research or public goods.
 
</p>
<p> A trade framework that only relies upon high prices to bolster medical R&amp;D 
</p>
<p>investments anticipates and accepts the rationing of new medical innovations, 
</p>
<p>does nothing to address the global need for public sector R&amp;D investments, is inef-
</p>
<p>fective at driving investments into important priority research projects, and when 
</p>
<p>taken to extremes, is subject to a number of well-known anticompetitive practices 
</p>
<p>and abuses. Policy makers need a new framework that has the flexibility to pro-
</p>
<p>mote both innovation and access, and which is consistent with efforts to protect 
</p>
<p>consumers and control costs.
</p>
<p> To this end, a number of experts and stakeholders have proposed a new global 
</p>
<p>treaty to support medical R&amp;D. This effort has produced a working draft (http://
</p>
<p>www.cptech.org/workingdrafts/rndtreaty4.pdf) that illustrates a particular 
</p>
<p>approach for such a treaty&mdash;one that seeks to provide the flexibility to reconcile 
</p>
<p>different policy objectives, including the promotion of both innovation and access, 
</p>
<p>consistent with human rights and the promotion of science in the public interest. 
</p>
<p>The draft treaty provides new obligations and economic incentives to invest in pri-
</p>
<p>ority research projects, and addresses several other important topics.2</p>

</p>
<p> In November 2005, the Republic of Kenya submitted a draft resolution to 
</p>
<p>the One Hundred and Seventeenth Session of the WHO Executive Board for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a working group to examine global health priorities for medical 
</p>
<p>research and development. Then, in January, 2006, at the WHO Executive Board, 
</p>
<p>Kenya submitted a background document for its proposed resolution, and 285 sci-
</p>
<p>entists from fifty-one countries, including five Nobel Prize winners, sent a letter 
</p>
<p>to the WHO Executive Board supporting the Kenyan resolution. In their letter, the 
</p>
<p>scientists said:
</p>
<p>Although we have very varied scientific backgrounds, from basic research to spe-
</p>
<p>cific clinical research, we are all deeply concerned with deficiencies in the way 
</p>
<p>that biomedical research science is supported and translated into treatments that 
</p>
<p>improve health outcomes around the world. . . . We have all felt the impact and 
</p>
<p>promise of the free availability of genome sequence data, notably from the human 
</p>
<p>genome project. At the same time we see research activities increasingly compli-
</p>
<p>cated by legal restrictions, such as intellectual property rights, which can interfere 
</p>
<p>with free data exchange and can limit biomedical research progress. We do not see 
</p>
<p>a good balance between medical need and resource allocation in the existing system 
</p>
<p>to support R&amp;D.3
</p>
<p> On January 24, Brazil joined Kenya in submitting a revised draft resolution 
</p>
<p>proposing a WHO initiative to create a bold new global framework for essen-
</p>
<p>tial health R&amp;D. In April, the CIPIH issued its report, which, despite having to 
</p>
<p>be a compromise document between stakeholders with very different interests, 
</p>
<p>reached important conclusions about the adverse direct effect of the current intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property regime on both research and development of and access to medi-
</p>
<p>cines for poor countries.
</p>
<p> In May 2006, the Fifty-Ninth World Health Assembly passed Kenya/Brazil Res-
</p>
<p>olution 59.24, calling for the establishment of an Intergovernmental Working Group 
</p>
<p>on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property (IGWG) to draw up a global 
</p>
<p>strategy and plan of action based on the recommendations of the CIPIH, including 
</p>
<p>researching a new framework to support sustainable, needs-driven, essential R&amp;D 
</p>
<p>work on diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries.
</p>
<p> In 2007, at the Sixtieth World Health Assembly, Brazil introduced a resolution 
</p>
<p>on public health, innovation, and intellectual property that was passed as Resolu-
</p>
<p>tion WHA 60.30. This document formed the basis for exploration of the propos-
</p>
<p>als being introduced for alternative approaches for financing medical R&amp;D, giving 
</p>
<p>clear instructions for the development of a plan of action and a strategy for action. 
</p>
<p>The second meeting of the IGWG was held later that year in Geneva, which pro-
</p>
<p>duced drafts of these, but which did not fully respond to its mandate for providing, 
</p>

</p>
<p>for example, cost estimates for the strategy and plan of action. The political pro-
</p>
<p>cess allowed for public commentary on the negotiations, to which there was a good 
</p>
<p>response, though there was some dissatisfaction about the scope and process of 
</p>
<p>the hearings.
</p>
<p> In 2008, the discussions on the plan of action presented in the previous year 
</p>
<p>continued, with dissatisfaction being expressed by many countries about the tech-
</p>
<p>nical documents presented by the WHO Secretariat. At this juncture, in March, 
</p>
<p>it looked as if talks could fail, but a series of white papers outlining both process 
</p>
<p>and content were eventually agreed to, and these formed the basis for final nego-
</p>
<p>tiations in late April and early May. On May 24, 2008, a global strategy and plan 
</p>
<p>of action was approved by the Sixty-First World Health Assembly in Resolution 
</p>
<p>WHA 61.21.
</p>
<p>the technical timeline
</p>
<p>Concurrent with developments along this political track and intrinsically related to 
</p>
<p>them, the developments along a more technical track progressed, as well. Experts 
</p>
<p>in health, pharmaceuticals, and economics began to discuss proposals for radical 
</p>
<p>reform of the financing of medical R&amp;D. (Many of the actors on this track were of 
</p>
<p>course also actors in the political process.) These proposals increasingly focused on 
</p>
<p>the use of prizes as incentives to undertake the research and development needed 
</p>
<p>to produce medicines necessary to improve the prospects of health care for popu-
</p>
<p>lations in the developing countries.
</p>
<p> In 1999, Michael Kremer and others proposed creating large rewards for invest-
</p>
<p>ments in vaccines for malaria and other tropical diseases.4 In 2001, the pharma-
</p>
<p>ceutical company Eli Lilly created the firm InnoCentive to administer a series of 
</p>
<p>commercially sponsored prizes to solve problems in the area of life sciences. Later, 
</p>
<p>a number of philanthropic organizations sponsored prizes for medical innovations, 
</p>
<p>including, but not limited to the X-Prize Foundation, the Prize4Life Foundation, 
</p>
<p>and the Gotham Prize.
</p>
<p> In 2002, the pharmaceutical company Aventis held discussions on possible 
</p>
<p>future pharmaceutical scenarios, including a scenario proposed by Tim Hubbard 
</p>
<p>and James Love that featured prizes and the elimination of monopolies on all new 
</p>
<p>medicines. This scenario was presented at a number of academic and policy work-
</p>
<p>shops in 2003 and 2004. Separately, in August 2003, the economist Burton Weis-
</p>
<p>brod published an editorial in the Washington Post, &ldquo;Solving the Drug Dilemma,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>that called for &ldquo;two prices&mdash;one for the R&amp;D, another for the resulting pills.&rdquo;  
</p>
<p>Weisbrod noted &ldquo;this solution is not painless, but neither is the course that public 
</p>
<p>policy is now on.&rdquo;5

</p>
<p> In 2005, U.S. Representative Bernard Sanders introduced to the U.S. Congress 
</p>
<p>the first Medical Innovation Prize Fund proposal (HR 417, One Hundred and Ninth 
</p>
<p>Congress), setting out a particular implementation of the new approach, stimu-
</p>
<p>lating additional interest among academics. In 2006, Joseph Stiglitz began pub-
</p>
<p>lishing a number of widely read articles calling for the use of prizes to reward  
</p>
<p>drug development.
</p>
<p> In May 2006, the World Health Assembly passed resolution WHA60.30, which, 
</p>
<p>among other things and in the context of addressing the unmet health needs of 
</p>
<p>developing countries, called upon the director general of the WHO to &ldquo;encourage 
</p>
<p>the development of . . . incentive mechanisms . . . addressing the linkage of the cost 
</p>
<p>of research and development and the price of medicines, vaccines, diagnostic kits 
</p>
<p>and other health-care products.&rdquo;6
</p>
<p> In 2007, Sanders, now a senator, reintroduced the Medical Innovation Prize 
</p>
<p>Fund as S.2210. Also in 2007, U.S. senator and presidential candidate John Edwards 
</p>
<p>called for prizes, rather than monopolies to stimulate drug development.7
</p>
<p> Other notable contributions to the technical track from 2004 to 2008 were 
</p>
<p>papers and articles by academics such as Joe DiMasi and Henry G. Grabowski, 
</p>
<p>Aidan Hollis, Thomas Pogge, Marylynn Wei, Kevin Outterton, Carl Nathan, and 
</p>
<p>Stan Finkelstein and Peter Temin, NGO experts and consultants such as Dean Baker 
</p>
<p>and Ron Marchant, and journalists such as Scott Wolley.8

<p> In April 2008, in a WHO negotiation over new approaches to stimulating medi-
</p>
<p>cal R&amp;D, the governments of Barbados and Bolivia made five separate proposals 
</p>
<p>to use prizes for medical innovation.9 In May 2008, the World Health Assembly 
</p>
<p>adopted a Global Strategy and Plan of Action, which, among other items, agreed 
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;explore and, where appropriate, promote a range of incentive schemes for 
</p>
<p>research and development including addressing, where appropriate, the de-linkage 
</p>
<p>of the costs of research and development and the price of health products, for 
</p>
<p>example through the award of prizes, with the objective of addressing diseases 
</p>
<p>which disproportionately affect developing countries.&rdquo;10
</p>
<p>the strategy
</p>
<p>Advocates for the reform of essential R&amp;D by offering incentives in the form of 
</p>
<p>prizes and awards were aware that they would have to persuade a number of dif-
</p>
<p>ferent constituencies of both the basis for and the viability of such an alternative 
</p>
<p>approach to financing R&amp;D. It was important in order to advance new models, that 
</p>
<p>the intellectual property policy community addressing global health issues (at the 
</p>
<p>time, largely centered on the WTO), the global health-policy community centered 
</p>
<p>on the WHO, but also the policy and political community of regional and national 
</p>
<p> gombe and love</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>537
</p>
<p>governments be persuaded that on balance, the new proposals were advanta-
</p>
<p>geous for the constituencies they represented. It was also important to ensure that 
</p>
<p>acknowledged experts in these policy areas were seen to be part of the movement. 
</p>
<p>The shared conviction of research scientists, health economists, intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty specialists, and public-health specialists that the need for change was urgent 
</p>
<p>proved to be instrumental in advancing the technical and political movement for 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge and medical technologies.
</p>
<p> The central strategy employed by the movement was to present a persuasive 
</p>
<p>case to policy makers and other stakeholders in the research and development 
</p>
<p>of medical technologies that it is not only feasible, but also imperative that new 
</p>
<p>mechanisms be invoked that separate the market for innovation from the mar-
</p>
<p>ket for innovative products. Key to the success of the approach would be to help 
</p>
<p>policy makers understand that this would allow generic competition for all prod-
</p>
<p>ucts as soon as they enter the market, driving prices down, and also would mean 
</p>
<p>that the developers of new medicines and vaccines would be rewarded directly 
</p>
<p>by prizes. The prizes would be linked to the effect of innovations on health-care 
</p>
<p>outcomes, regardless of who actually delivered the product to patients. The new 
</p>
<p>approach would be beneficial for both the producers of advancements in science 
</p>
<p>and the recipients of these advances, protecting the rights of both as enshrined in 
</p>
<p>human rights conventions.
</p>
<p> Ample justifications existed for the reform of the current system. Globally, 
</p>
<p>access to new medicines was and continues to be constrained by high prices that 
</p>
<p>are a consequence of patent-enforced monopolies. Products that cost pennies to 
</p>
<p>manufacture are subject to astronomical mark-ups, leading to hardships and barri-
</p>
<p>ers to access.
</p>
<p> High prices are not the only shortcoming of the current system, either. The 
</p>
<p>prices and rewards for new drugs are loosely based upon the prices charged for 
</p>
<p>comparable medicines, leading to wasteful investment in products that are simi-
</p>
<p>lar to each other in terms of mechanisms and therapeutic results, offering few, if 
</p>
<p>any advantages over products already on the market. Inventions that address the 
</p>
<p>needs of low-income and uninsured persons receive scant attention by investors. 
</p>
<p>Even for persons who can best afford new medicines, the current system seems to 
</p>
<p>offer low and decreasing productivity, because sharp increases in investments in 
</p>
<p>R&amp;D have not yielded much in terms of useful innovations.
</p>
<p> Early specifications of proposals were developed in a scenario-planning exer-
</p>
<p>cise with the pharmaceutical company Aventis and were later refined by contribu-
</p>
<p>tions from a number of persons. In terms of the degree of change from the current 
</p>
<p>system, the proposals can be considered in phases, each building upon each other 
</p>
<p>and departing further from the status quo.
</p>
<p>new medicines and vaccines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>538
</p>
<p> First, separate drug development incentives from the prices of the products by 
</p>
<p>replacing the exclusive rights to make or sell products with large cash prizes that 
</p>
<p>are linked to the effect of the product on health-care outcomes. The delinking of 
</p>
<p>incentives from product prices makes it possible to eliminate most price-based for-
</p>
<p>mularies and dramatically expand access to new medicines and vaccines. The new 
</p>
<p>approach also creates an opportunity to focus R&amp;D investments on the most impor-
</p>
<p>tant medical needs and eliminate wasteful expenditures on marketing activities.
</p>
<p> Second, encourage the open sharing of knowledge, materials, and technologies. 
</p>
<p>Prize rewards for development are shared through a set of &ldquo;open-source dividends&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>that are awarded to entities that make it possible for others to develop products.
</p>
<p> Next, create a new set of competitive financial intermediaries that fund basic 
</p>
<p>science and translational or early phases of development, which in turn generate 
</p>
<p>rewards on the basis of their measurable and objective contributions to products 
</p>
<p>that actually succeed.
</p>
<p> Finally, remove the exclusive right to use inventions in favor of a system that 
</p>
<p>gives the freedom to use inventions when patent owners receive remuneration, 
</p>
<p>creating more competition for follow-on innovations.
</p>
<p> These proposals were not designed as or considered to be a replacement of 
</p>
<p>the important and significant role of governments and donors in direct funding of 
</p>
<p>research through grants. The access-to-medicines movement remains aware that 
</p>
<p>traditional grant programs are necessary to promote and sustain research programs 
</p>
<p>and will always play an important role in the advancement of science and the devel-
</p>
<p>opment of new products. The new mechanisms were designed as complements to 
</p>
<p>the traditional &ldquo;push&rdquo; mechanisms and as a much-needed alternative to the &ldquo;pull&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>incentives now implemented as legal monopolies to make, use, or sell products.
</p>
<p>implementing prize funds&mdash;four options
</p>
<p>Over time, several options were presented for the implementation of prize funds in 
</p>
<p>both national and global permutations. The first legislative proposals were intro-
</p>
<p>duced in the United States as HR417 (One Hundred and Ninth Congress), the Medi-
</p>
<p>cal Innovation Prize Fund. Building on this proposal and modifying it for global 
</p>
<p>application, proposals were made at the WHO by Bolivia and Barbados. The com-
</p>
<p>mon underlying principle is that the incentives now associated with expected 
</p>
<p>monopoly profits for products would be replaced with large cash rewards for suc-
</p>
<p>cessful development efforts. It is thus that there would be a delinking of R&amp;D 
</p>
<p>incentives from product prices.
</p>
<p> The model proposals advanced four options elaborated from the academic, pol-
</p>
<p>icy, and legislative discussions around prizes. Each carries distinct opportunities 
</p>
<p> gombe and love</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>539
</p>
<p>and challenges. The proposals that have been made to date fall into four broad 
</p>
<p>groups, presented as options for implementation.
</p>
<p>option 1 Replace the exclusive rights to make or sell a product, following drug 
</p>
<p>regulatory approval, with large cash prizes that are linked to the effect of the prod-
</p>
<p>uct on health-care outcomes. This option tackles the most important reform in the 
</p>
<p>system of incentives for drug development: the elimination of the set of exclusive 
</p>
<p>rights that are now offered to induce the development of new drugs. These rights 
</p>
<p>are associated most importantly with patents on pharmaceutical inventions, but 
</p>
<p>also include a growing set of nonpatent mechanisms to bar competition, including, 
</p>
<p>for example, market exclusivity associated with pediatric drug testing as a reward 
</p>
<p>for the development of &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; drugs and biologics and to prevent unauthorized 
</p>
<p>competitors from relying upon clinical trial data from clinical trials to register new 
</p>
<p>products.11 Taken together, these measures are explicitly designed to grant legal 
</p>
<p>monopolies on new medicines with the intention that the monopoly profits will 
</p>
<p>stimulate useful R&amp;D. The shortcomings of such a system are many, including not 
</p>
<p>only the hardships associated with high prices (a barrier to access and a burden 
</p>
<p>for consumers, employers, and society at large), but also inefficient investment in 
</p>
<p>the development of medically unimportant products, as well as wasteful and often 
</p>
<p>harmful marketing activities.
</p>
<p> This option constitutes a key change in the business model for rewarding 
</p>
<p>developers of new medicines. By delinking R&amp;D incentives from product prices 
</p>
<p>and allowing for competition and low generic prices for the products themselves, 
</p>
<p>utilization of newer products would no longer be discouraged simply because of 
</p>
<p>the high prices now associated with patented inventions.
</p>
<p> The two U.S. Medical Innovation Prize Fund (MIPF) bills (HR 417, One Hundred 
</p>
<p>and Ninth Congress and S. 2210, One Hundred and Tenth Congress) presented the 
</p>
<p>first fully specified possible implementation of prizes in the context of a major 
</p>
<p>market for medicines. The basic approach followed one of the scenarios outlined 
</p>
<p>in the 2002 Aventis exercise. The drafters of the MIPF sought to address several 
</p>
<p>important technical questions relating to the allocation of prizes:
</p>
<p>1.  The prize fund will have an annual contribution based upon a fraction of 
</p>
<p>GDP.12
</p>
<p>2.  All of the annual funding is to be spent every year on qualifying products 
</p>
<p>and processes.
</p>
<p>3.  The prize fund of a fixed size is to be divided among qualifying products in 
</p>
<p>a zero-sum competition. The more that is given to one product, the less is 
</p>
<p>available to competitors.
</p>
<p>4.  Every new product &ldquo;wins&rdquo; something, but products that have a greater 
</p>
<p>effect on health outcomes receive more.
</p>
<p>new medicines and vaccines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>540
</p>
<p>5.  New products (and processes) participate in the fund for ten years. The 
</p>
<p>reward in any given year is independent of future rewards and is based 
</p>
<p>upon the best available evidence (at that time) of the effect of the product 
</p>
<p>on health outcomes.
</p>
<p>6.  The effect on health outcomes is benchmarked against available technolo-
</p>
<p>gies, rather than against placebos.
</p>
<p>7.  Products that are registered with the FDA at roughly the same time are 
</p>
<p>compared with products that were not recently developed.
</p>
<p> Three other features of this implementation deserve discussion. First, the MIPF 
</p>
<p>provided that the amount of the prize money that any one product can receive 
</p>
<p>in a given year is limited to 5 percent of the annual prize fund payments.13 Sec-
</p>
<p>ond, in cases where there is a follow-on product, that MIPF would continue to 
</p>
<p>make payments to the original product, even when its market share falls to zero, 
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;the degree that the new . . . product, or manufacturing process was based on 
</p>
<p>or benefited from the development of the existing . . . product, or manufacturing 
</p>
<p>process.&rdquo; Third, the MIPF provides specific set-asides for areas of public health 
</p>
<p>priority, including current and emerging global infectious diseases, severe illnesses 
</p>
<p>with small client populations, and neglected diseases that primarily afflict the poor 
</p>
<p>in developing countries.
</p>
<p> While the MIPF eliminates market exclusivity for products, it does not elimi-
</p>
<p>nate patents. Patents will continue to be available for new medicines and will con-
</p>
<p>tinue to be valuable assets, not as legal monopolies on products, but as ways to 
</p>
<p>make claims on the prize fund money. Strictly speaking, the Sanders bills did not 
</p>
<p>change the system of exclusive rights for drug, biological, or vaccine development 
</p>
<p>until after a product received FDA approval. Drug developers would have to lit-
</p>
<p>igate or negotiate with patent owners to obtain the necessary rights to register 
</p>
<p>products, as they do today. In practice, however, the elimination of the postmar-
</p>
<p>keting approval of exclusive rights would create a very new dynamic for patent 
</p>
<p>owners. The total reward for drug development would be fixed by the size of the 
</p>
<p>prize fund. A patent system that created too many barriers to product develop-
</p>
<p>ment then would be easier to reform, because changes would not change the over-
</p>
<p>all system of sustainable rewards.
</p>
<p>option 2 Create open-source dividends to reward the sharing of knowledge, data, 
</p>
<p>and technology. One explanation of the low productivity in drug development is 
</p>
<p>that scientists and firms involved in medical research and development are not suf-
</p>
<p>ficiently open in terms of access to knowledge and that restrictive licensing prac-
</p>
<p>tices discourage research in areas where patents exist. New development models in 
</p>
<p>the field of software and innovative information services have enhanced interest in 
</p>
<p> gombe and love</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>541
</p>
<p>approaches that promote more access to knowledge and greater sharing and free-
</p>
<p>dom to use and improve upon innovations pioneered by others. If prizes were used 
</p>
<p>to reward innovations, it would be possible to expand access and redesign R&amp;D 
</p>
<p>incentives to stimulate more efficiently investments that improve health outcomes.
</p>
<p> The issue of secrecy, openness, and prizes was discussed at length in a 2008 
</p>
<p>workshop on medical-innovation prizes at the United Nations University at Maas-
</p>
<p>tricht, the Netherlands, and in a M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) workshop exam-
</p>
<p>ining the possible use of prizes to stimulate the development in a rapid, low-cost 
</p>
<p>point-of-delivery test for tuberculosis.14 In the spring of 2008, the governments of 
</p>
<p>Barbados and Bolivia submitted to the WHO five proposals to use prizes to stimu-
</p>
<p>late medical R&amp;D. Several of these prizes formally introduced the notion of &ldquo;open-
</p>
<p>source&rdquo; dividends to encourage greater openness. Among the specific proposals 
</p>
<p>were the notion of sharing the final-product prizes with individuals, firms, and 
</p>
<p>communities that share knowledge, materials, and technologies in a nondiscrimi-
</p>
<p>natory and royalty-free manner. There was even a proposal to share the open-
</p>
<p>source dividends with journals that would publish research in full text without 
</p>
<p>subscription fees, creating a new incentive for journals to share research findings 
</p>
<p>more openly. The Barbados/Bolivia prize proposals also created systems of rewards 
</p>
<p>for interim research results that were available only to entities that would offer 
</p>
<p>royalty-free open licenses for inventions, data, materials, and know-how. They 
</p>
<p>would reserve 10 percent of prize money for scientists and engineers who are unaf-
</p>
<p>filiated with and uncompensated by the winning entrant, but who have published 
</p>
<p>and shared research, data materials, and technology, an award to be determined on 
</p>
<p>the basis of who provided the most useful external contributions to achieving the 
</p>
<p>end result. This would include research, data, materials, and technology that are 
</p>
<p>either placed in the public domain or subject to open, nonremunerated licenses. In 
</p>
<p>addition, biannual &ldquo;best contributions&rdquo; prizes would be available only to technolo-
</p>
<p>gies that were placed in the public domain or licensed to a patent pool for open, 
</p>
<p>royalty-free use.
</p>
<p> To qualify for the &ldquo;best contributions&rdquo; prize, published research findings would 
</p>
<p>have to be freely available on the Internet in full text. As an incentive to journals 
</p>
<p>to make articles available to the public for free, 10 percent of the &ldquo;best contribu-
</p>
<p>tions&rdquo; prize given for a published article would be available to a peer-reviewed 
</p>
<p>journal that published the article, on the condition that the journal make the arti-
</p>
<p>cle available for free immediately upon publication.
</p>
<p>option 3 Add prizes for interim results, such as reaching interim benchmarks and 
</p>
<p>solving discrete technical problems and for research undertaken by competitive 
</p>
<p>intermediaries. Prizes that reward successful outcomes could be implemented as an 
</p>
<p>new medicines and vaccines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>542
</p>
<p>alternative to a set of exclusive rights. Unfortunately, it is much more difficult to 
</p>
<p>evaluate the value of interim benchmarks than it is final products that have con-
</p>
<p>crete and observable utility in terms of influencing health outcomes. In any cen-
</p>
<p>trally managed prize program for medical research, the criteria to reward interim 
</p>
<p>outcomes would be controversial and difficult to evaluate and would suffer from 
</p>
<p>many of the limitations that now exist with systems of grants.
</p>
<p> Rather than search for consensus on one or more ingenious systems for valuing 
</p>
<p>interim results, policy makers could create an environment where decentralized 
</p>
<p>institutions make such valuations. In this approach, there would be no need to 
</p>
<p>legitimize the valuation criteria. Instead, it would be necessary only to legitimize 
</p>
<p>the actors that make such valuations. Multiple intermediaries would be resourced 
</p>
<p>to award prizes for interim results, using their own methods. The legitimacy of the 
</p>
<p>intermediaries would be based upon the competition to obtain funds.
</p>
<p> The notion of competitive intermediaries was recently proposed by Bolivia and 
</p>
<p>Barbados in connection with a proposal for priority medicines and vaccines through 
</p>
<p>which 20 percent of the proposed Priority Medicines and Vaccines Prize Fund  
</p>
<p>money would be allocated to three or more institutions that run prize competitions 
</p>
<p>to reward earlier stages of product development. These would include smaller tech-
</p>
<p>nical challenges and also rewards for the successful development of early bench-
</p>
<p>marks in drug development, such as the completion of phase I/II clinical trials.
</p>
<p>option 4 Create a system of compensatory liability to reduce the problem of pat-
</p>
<p>ent thickets in upstream research, a system of liability rules, rather than of exclu-
</p>
<p>sive rights. Patent rights are often implemented as a set of exclusive rights, subject 
</p>
<p>to some limited permitted uses, and the understanding that abuses of exclusive 
</p>
<p>rights are sanctionable by governments or courts.15 But patents can also be imple-
</p>
<p>mented so that everyone has the freedom to use the invention, subject only to an 
</p>
<p>obligation to pay remuneration.
</p>
<p> Compulsory licenses or a system of prizes such as the one envisioned by S.2210 
</p>
<p>are types of liability rules. There are many possibilities for liability rules, including 
</p>
<p>cases where exclusive rights have some role, but where the threshold for obtaining 
</p>
<p>compulsory licenses is low and one can realistically anticipate obtaining nonvol-
</p>
<p>untary authorizations in the event that voluntary negotiations fail. The range of 
</p>
<p>possibilities is large along a continuum that begins with automatic rights to use 
</p>
<p>inventions and that ends with no rights to use inventions outside of voluntary 
</p>
<p>authorizations from patent owners.
</p>
<p> Patent owners often express concern that compulsory licensing would lead to 
</p>
<p>a bias in favor of low rates of compensation and insufficient rewards for innova-
</p>
<p>tion. They also question the assumption that patents inhibit innovation, since in 
</p>
<p> gombe and love</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>543
</p>
<p>a voluntary context, patent owners always have the option of licensing welfare-
</p>
<p>enhancing innovations, rather than blocking them. In practice, however, both pat-
</p>
<p>ent owners and users have incomplete and asymmetrical information about the 
</p>
<p>value of patents in a particular use, and each has incentives to act strategically, 
</p>
<p>factors that contribute in practice to an underutilization of patented inventions.
</p>
<p> The disputes about compulsory licensing or other types of liability rules are 
</p>
<p>particularly heated in the context of pharmaceutical inventions, which are often 
</p>
<p>very inexpensive to copy. In a world where R&amp;D incentives are linked to drug 
</p>
<p>prices, any relaxation of exclusive rights could lead to competition that reduces 
</p>
<p>monopoly rents and undermines incentives to invest in R&amp;D. For this reason, pat-
</p>
<p>ent offices and courts have often allowed patent doctrines to stray far from their 
</p>
<p>putative purpose of rewarding invention. The expanding subject matter for pat-
</p>
<p>ents and the low standards for what is known as &ldquo;inventive step,&rdquo; a criterion for 
</p>
<p>identifying a genuine innovation, could be thought of indirect efforts to use pat-
</p>
<p>ents to protect investment.
</p>
<p> The importance of patents for protecting investments is greater for pharma-
</p>
<p>ceutical inventions than it is for many other technology fields. One observes very 
</p>
<p>different perspectives on the patent system in other industry sectors. For example, 
</p>
<p>in the software, telecommunications, and computing sector, a growing number of 
</p>
<p>firms favor the abolition or weakening of software patents, and patent reform has 
</p>
<p>been framed as a call for higher standards for patentability and for a relaxation of 
</p>
<p>exclusive rights in favor of incremental steps toward liability rules.
</p>
<p> With the introduction of a system of prizes to reward drug development, 
</p>
<p>breaking the link between R&amp;D incentives and product prices, the pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>industry&rsquo;s interest in patent reform would change dramatically. The relevant factor 
</p>
<p>in determining the overall R&amp;D industry revenues will no longer be the poten-
</p>
<p>tial revenues from drug sales, which are influenced in part by the ability to exer-
</p>
<p>cise exclusive rights over products, but rather the size of the prize fund. A patent 
</p>
<p>system that requires costly litigation, creates long bargaining delays, and blocks  
</p>
<p>innovation will be seen as a negative, as will a system that rewards inventions 
</p>
<p>excessively at the expense of investments.
</p>
<p>conclusion: prize funds and the intellectual property regime
</p>
<p>Proposals for prize systems, in their most ambitious form, entail the modifica-
</p>
<p>tion of current intellectual property rules. This includes an elimination of all legal 
</p>
<p>barriers to the competitive supply of the products. Patents would be used not as 
</p>
<p>monopolies, but as a mechanism to stake claims on the prize money. Prizes would 
</p>
<p>also reward unpatented innovations and investments.
</p>
<p>new medicines and vaccines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>544
</p>
<p> What the movement has advanced is the premise that the use of cash prizes 
</p>
<p>to eliminate legal monopolies for products would provide a powerful opportu-
</p>
<p>nity to address several flaws that plague the current system. In particular, policy 
</p>
<p>makers would have far more freedom to design incentives efficiently. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, rewards could be directly linked to improvements in health outcomes when 
</p>
<p>benchmarked against existing treatments, rather than being linked to the replica-
</p>
<p>tion of benefits already available from existing products, as they often now are. 
</p>
<p>This would have the benefit of driving investment toward treatments that address 
</p>
<p>unmet needs. The elimination of product monopolies and enabling generic com-
</p>
<p>petition would also lower prices, reducing treatment costs and personal hardships 
</p>
<p>while expanding access.
</p>
<p> Prize systems could further be designed to reward and encourage collabora-
</p>
<p>tion and the sharing of knowledge, materials, and technologies. Prizes encourage 
</p>
<p>investments in translational research that has low prospects for commercial suc-
</p>
<p>cess, but that is of significant value in terms of advancing scientific knowledge.
</p>
<p> The options discussed above, while not constituting an exhaustive list, provide 
</p>
<p>a starting point for potential pilot programs that can be implemented immediately, 
</p>
<p>either under the WHO Global Strategy and Plan of Action or by national govern-
</p>
<p>ments or regional groupings.
</p>
<p> This paper has briefly summarized a number of developments in the area of 
</p>
<p>access to medicines and a number of ideas and arguments that were developed by 
</p>
<p>various actors committed to introduce a shift in the paradigm regarding access to 
</p>
<p>knowledge and intellectual property. In the past fifteen years many actors, from 
</p>
<p>activists to academics, have pointed out the limits and barriers set by the cur-
</p>
<p>rent system to finance research and development of medical innovation, a system 
</p>
<p>mostly based on product monopolies enforced by intellectual property regimes. 
</p>
<p>But the involvement of these actors does not end in identifying and denouncing 
</p>
<p>the barriers and injustices. They represent an active and creative force bringing 
</p>
<p>specific options and solutions to the task of making access to knowledge a reality 
</p>
<p>and thus to creating an environment allowing innovations to respond to the needs 
</p>
<p>of all and to be accessible to all.
</p>
<p> Today, most R&amp;D spending is wasted on products that offer almost no realistic 
</p>
<p>chance of offering significant health benefits over existing products. By eliminating 
</p>
<p>product monopolies in favor of rewards from prize funds, it is possible to reduce 
</p>
<p>incentives dramatically for investments in medically unimportant products while 
</p>
<p>making it profitable to invest in products that truly improve health-care outcomes.
</p>
<p> Pharmaceutical marketing practices today are rational responses to our system 
</p>
<p>of R&amp;D incentives. With a legal monopoly to make and to sell medicines and with 
</p>
<p>returns based upon the number of units sold at monopoly prices, companies have 
</p>
<p> gombe and love</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>545
</p>
<p>enormous incentives to invest in the marketing of products to doctors and con-
</p>
<p>sumers, even for uses where the drug is of marginal use or even dangerous.16 If 
</p>
<p>prizes are implemented as rewards for improvements in health outcomes, irrational 
</p>
<p>uses of medicines become a negative, rather than a positive incentive.
</p>
<p> The current system for supporting innovation in the area of medical technolo-
</p>
<p>gies is costly, inefficient, and leads to both underutilization of new inventions and 
</p>
<p>unequal access. It is possible to do a better job of managing the current system, 
</p>
<p>but it is also possible to refashion the approach radically in order to provide for 
</p>
<p>more innovation and more access at less cost. Unlike other reforms in the health-
</p>
<p>care sector, which rely upon rationing of access to control costs, the use of prizes 
</p>
<p>to reward innovation would expand access and increase investments in areas 
</p>
<p>where innovation is most important. It is not easy to change existing systems of 
</p>
<p>innovation, but neither will it be easy to not change. It is difficult to imagine a 
</p>
<p>more expensive system of innovation that produces so little in terms of new medi-
</p>
<p>cines and vaccines. A reform of the reward system for new medicines has enor-
</p>
<p>mous potential to enhance innovation and access, not only in the United States, 
</p>
<p>but everywhere. Those who object to change should have the burden of justifying 
</p>
<p>the costly system of monopolies that we struggle with today.

</p>
<p>A2K could be described as an emerging social movement or as a fundamentally dis-
</p>
<p>jointed and dynamic coalition. Perhaps more precisely, the A2K movement might 
</p>
<p>be understood as characterized by the series of actions and arguments that are tak-
</p>
<p>ing shape as groups develop overlapping agendas and coordinated actions in the 
</p>
<p>conceptual space previously mapped using the concept of &ldquo;intellectual property.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> As the A2K movement has evolved, it has also increasingly gained recognition 
</p>
<p>for its creativity and productivity. The movement has made connections between 
</p>
<p>groups from very different contexts that occupy different places on conventional 
</p>
<p>ideological spectrums. It works with and against governments, intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, and industry. It mobilizes as well as troubles the rhetorics of law 
</p>
<p>and markets. Those involved in the A2K movement also regularly make choices 
</p>
<p>about organizational, conceptual, and strategic issues, with different groups taking 
</p>
<p>sometimes substantially different approaches.
</p>
<p> The following &ldquo;virtual roundtable&rdquo; was put together via e-mail to create space 
</p>
<p>for a conversation on these issues and to provide a further sense of the stakes and 
</p>
<p>divergences within the A2K movement. (See the &ldquo;Virtual Roundtable on A2K Poli-
</p>
<p>tics&rdquo; in this volume.) Questionnaires were sent to five individuals who represent 
</p>
<p>different approaches and involvements in the movement. Their responses were 
</p>
<p>gathered and organized in a single document to facilitate the perception of the 
</p>
<p>variety of opinions. As with the &ldquo;Virtual Roundtable on A2K Politics,&rdquo; what fol-
</p>
<p>lows does not intend to give an exhaustive account of the variety of positions and 
</p>
<p>thoughts that exist in the movement, but give a sample of different perspectives 
</p>
<p>that go through it.

</p>
<p>question 1 How would you describe the strategies and tactics that you have 
</p>
<p>adopted regarding intellectual property and/or A2K issues? Has the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment developed strategies that are particular to this coalition, or to activism at this 
</p>
<p>point in history, from which other groups might learn? Do you see an evolution in 
</p>
<p>the modus operandi and tactics of the A2K movement?
</p>
<p>question 2 Where did the A2K movement learn its strategies? From where or 
</p>
<p>whom could it learn?
</p>
<p>question 3 The architecture of the A2K movement makes law central, because 
</p>
<p>the rubric of the coalition is arguably &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;&mdash;a legal construct. 
</p>
<p>Legal institutions (the World Trade Organization [WTO], the World Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property Organization [WIPO]) and legal mechanisms (open licenses, creative-
</p>
<p>commons licenses, compulsory licenses) are key locations for A2K interventions. 
</p>
<p>The A2K movement also operates very often in the register of legal argumenta-
</p>
<p>tion&mdash;that is, treating as its main opponent a theory of intellectual property that is 
</p>
<p>commonly advanced in legal circles, a theory of intellectual property as an entitle-
</p>
<p>ment for creative labor or as an &ldquo;incentive for innovation.&rdquo; A2K groups must thus 
</p>
<p>regularly reckon with the influence of law and legality and develop an ethic or set 
</p>
<p>of strategies appropriate to the challenge of operating in a legal context. How do 
</p>
<p>you reckon with the constraints and/or attractions of law? Do you encounter ten-
</p>
<p>sions between mobilization through law and mobilization against law, and if so, 
</p>
<p>how do you deal with these tensions? Should the A2K movement be understood 
</p>
<p>as responding to a set of commitments, principles, or ethics that exist beyond the 
</p>
<p>text and interpretation of law, that should guide the writing and interpretation of 
</p>
<p>law? If so, what are these, and where do they come from?
</p>
<p>question 4 What is your position toward institutions of governance and, more 
</p>
<p>generally, toward those who govern?</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>virtual roundtable on a2k strategies 549
</p>
<p>question 5 Do you have a specific attitude toward the private sector? Can gov-
</p>
<p>ernments and industry be considered part of the A2K coalition? Should they be?
</p>
<p>question 6 How would you describe A2K&mdash;as a movement, a coalition, an aspira-
</p>
<p>tion, or what? Does the A2K movement represent a simple pooling of resources or a 
</p>
<p>coalescence of actions and initiatives that are facilitating the creation of an original 
</p>
<p>form of action? Do coordinated or aligned actions with other &ldquo;A2K&rdquo; groups represent 
</p>
<p>an important aspect of your work? How should A2K groups relate to one another?
</p>
<p>question 7 Do you draw a distinction between short-term and long-term strate-
</p>
<p>gies? How does or should the A2K movement mediate between the pressing needs 
</p>
<p>of the short term and the need for a vision and strategy of long-term change? 
</p>
<p>question 8 Do you see the strategies of A2K actors merely as acts of resistance 
</p>
<p>to the agenda and profound successes of the movement for greater intellectual 
</p>
<p>property restrictions? Is the A2K movement predominantly an attempt to &ldquo;domes-
</p>
<p>ticate&rdquo; or &ldquo;balance&rdquo; the existing intellectual property system, or does the move-
</p>
<p>ment advocate for more thoroughgoing alternatives to this system?
</p>
<p>question 9 Do you see tensions or struggles for power between the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment&rsquo;s various components? If so, how do you interpret these in terms of the 
</p>
<p>shape or governance of the movement and the prospects for the future?
</p>
<p>question 10 Some characterize A2K as an elite movement, shaped primarily by 
</p>
<p>NGOs, academics, and government actors and by agendas set predominantly in the 
</p>
<p>Global North. Are these perceptions accurate? Does the A2K movement have or 
</p>
<p>aim for a broad base of nonexpert participants? How are people who are not pro-
</p>
<p>fessional A2K actors to participate in priority setting and campaigning?
</p>
<p>vera franz
</p>
<p>question 1 The much-quoted analogy to the environmental movement that&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>used to describe the strategies and tactics of the A2K movement I think still holds 
</p>
<p>true. The main achievement of the A2K movement is that it has made people 
</p>
<p>aware of a common resource&mdash;the knowledge commons&mdash;that needs to be pro-
</p>
<p>tected by keeping it &ldquo;common&rdquo; and free. The main task of the A2K movement is 
</p>
<p>to monitor and promote the health of our knowledge ecology, that is, to watch the 
</p>
<p>precarious balance between private and common knowledge resources. This means 
</p>
<p>mainly two things: Monitor and push back intellectual property rules that endan-
</p>
<p>ger the knowledge commons and promote the knowledge commons by planting 
</p>
<p>seeds that everyone out there can grow. Yochai Benkler gives a wonderful account 
</p>
<p>of the knowledge commons in The Wealth of Networks.1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>550
</p>
<p> In terms of strategy, two main things come to mind: First, it was critical that the 
</p>
<p>A2K movement was able to unite very different stakeholders under one umbrella: 
</p>
<p>librarians, free-software developers, video activists, access-to-medicines cam-
</p>
<p>paigners, digital-rights advocates, consumer groups, teachers and students, the 
</p>
<p>visually impaired, and many others. &ldquo;A2K&rdquo; as a term was broad and vague enough 
</p>
<p>to bring all these people together, and at the same time, the term captured a con-
</p>
<p>cern that everybody shared: the quest for a balance between private and common 
</p>
<p>knowledge resources.
</p>
<p> Second, I think the alliances and coalitions that the movement built with the 
</p>
<p>private sector were critical. Claims about human rights and the public interest get 
</p>
<p>you only so far. Once companies such as IBM, Google, Sun, AT&amp;T, HP, and others 
</p>
<p>joined the chorus, governments started to listen more carefully. It started to dawn 
</p>
<p>on policy makers that those &ldquo;A2K businesses&rdquo; substantially contribute to U.S. 
</p>
<p>competitiveness and GDP and would have to shut down in a world of maximalist 
</p>
<p>enforcement of intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p> In terms of changes over time, if anything, the A2K movement has become 
</p>
<p>more mature and sophisticated in its work. The strategies haven&rsquo;t fundamentally 
</p>
<p>changed, but the demands have gotten more concrete. For example, while in the 
</p>
<p>beginning the quest was for a more balanced copyright regime and stronger limita-
</p>
<p>tions and exceptions to copyright, at this point, the movement is asking the WIPO 
</p>
<p>to adopt a Treaty for the Visually Impaired within the coming two years.
</p>
<p>question 2 The movement from the very beginning was joined and led by expe-
</p>
<p>rienced campaigners, originally active in other fields, and they brought with them 
</p>
<p>effective strategies. This ensured campaigns were of highest quality. And those 
</p>
<p>experienced campaigners taught young A2K activists important skills. I was able 
</p>
<p>to witness how several young people grew into professional activists over time&mdash;
</p>
<p>an absolutely wonderful thing to see!
</p>
<p>question 3 The A2K movement is eclectic in many ways, and that&rsquo;s true of 
</p>
<p>how it views the role and centrality of the law. The part of the movement that is 
</p>
<p>focused on, for example, the reform of the WIPO takes the rule of law as its start-
</p>
<p>ing and end point. By changing legal norms, it tries, among many other things, to 
</p>
<p>improve access to medicines for the sick and access to knowledge for the visually 
</p>
<p>impaired. The law in that sense is the main tool in the toolbox. Very importantly, 
</p>
<p>these legal changes, in addition to better access, bring about new more open mod-
</p>
<p>els for the creation and remuneration of knowledge-based goods. Think GNU/
</p>
<p>GPL, think Creative Commons, think the Medical Innovation Prize Fund, or even 
</p>
<p>the idea of an alternative compensation system for musicians. And it&rsquo;s not better 
</p>
<p>access that is the revolutionary development here. It is those new and more open 
</p>
<p>franz </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>551
</p>
<p>models that incentivize creativity and innovation, excite so many, and will drive 
</p>
<p>the change.
</p>
<p> All of this said, there are important forces in the A2K movement that question 
</p>
<p>the centrality of law as such. Reality is shaped by other forces than the law, they 
</p>
<p>say. And I think those voices in the movement are equally important to the overall 
</p>
<p>change we want to bring about in the coming years. These people take social prac-
</p>
<p>tice as the starting and end point and argue that, in times of great technological 
</p>
<p>progress, it might well be that we will improve the condition of humanity more if 
</p>
<p>guided by social practice rather than by the existing law. For example, if the world 
</p>
<p>is looked at through the lens of WIPO, &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; is classified as an &ldquo;illegal activity&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>that needs to be extinguished at all cost. But looking at matters through the lens of 
</p>
<p>human development and economic progress, for example in developing countries, 
</p>
<p>one might not always come to the same conclusion. Further, some important busi-
</p>
<p>nesses would never have developed by always adhering to the narrowest interpre-
</p>
<p>tation of the current legal framework. In summary, parts of the A2K movement

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>552
</p>
<p>challenge the centrality of the law and argue that social practice, rather than the 
</p>
<p>law, will best guide us toward a better future.
</p>
<p>question 4 Working for the Open Society Institute, I obviously believe in the rule 
</p>
<p>of law, and I hence respect the institutions that shape and enforce the law. That 
</p>
<p>said, if a Soviet dissident would have followed the law, he would never have known 
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; he was so desperately seeking. This is to say that we should always 
</p>
<p>and at every moment question institutions of governance and those who govern. 
</p>
<p>So no, I don&rsquo;t trust them. I am not saying anything new here, but basically, let&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>build on our values and use common sense when engaging in public-policy debates.
</p>
<p>question 5 Can governments and industry be considered part of the A2K coali-
</p>
<p>tion? While governments and industry are not part of the A2K movement as such, 
</p>
<p>many of them are very close allies. Everyone who rejects a &ldquo;maximalist IP&rdquo; regime 
</p>
<p>and engages in this struggle is an ally. In fact, we have many examples of successful 
</p>
<p>issue coalitions between civil society, governments, and businesses that prove this 
</p>
<p>point. Take the campaign against an overbroad WIPO Broadcast Treaty or the effort 
</p>
<p>to strengthen limitations and exceptions to copyright. To be sure, these alliances 
</p>
<p>between the different sectors are not always easy and might even cause temporary 
</p>
<p>friction. But I firmly believe that we can bring about the change we are seeking 
</p>
<p>only by working closely with everyone who shares the same vision and goals.
</p>
<p>question 6 A2K is probably all of it&mdash;an aspiration, a movement, a coalition. 
</p>
<p>One can best think of it as consisting of concentric circles. The outer, largest circle 
</p>
<p>unites all those who share the aspiration or vision of a healthy knowledge ecology, 
</p>
<p>one where the commons thrives and occupies an important place. The next circle 
</p>
<p>closer to the center gathers the actors that came together, initially around the A2K 
</p>
<p>Treaty, which are committed to making it, or a version of it, a reality. Some people 
</p>
<p>were instrumental in getting this movement off the ground, but it is not led by any 
</p>
<p>one entity or person at this point, and new actors join as they feel this work is rel-
</p>
<p>evant to them and they want to make a contribution. Finally, within the innermost 
</p>
<p>circle, concrete progress is being achieved in the form of issue coalitions, which 
</p>
<p>form around concrete threats and opportunities. They spring up organically and 
</p>
<p>may include NGOs, academics, governments, and industry. They share a concrete 
</p>
<p>goal and get on with the work. Some are more public than others. All of them wage 
</p>
<p>a concrete, modest, yet important fight in terms of the bigger picture. In a way, 
</p>
<p>this inner concentric circle is driven by networked actors that jump into action 
</p>
<p>when and where needed.
</p>
<p>question 7 Very clearly, one always needs to think about short-term and long-
</p>
<p>term strategy and vision. I would argue that the A2K movement is better at 
</p>
<p>franz </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>553
</p>
<p>short-term engagement, responding to immediate threats and opportunities. Some 
</p>
<p>players have identified a longer-term vision, but it is not always clear what the 
</p>
<p>strategy for implementing this vision is. I would argue that one of the weaknesses 
</p>
<p>of the A2K movement is the vagueness of a longer-term strategy. Because time is a 
</p>
<p>luxury, the longer term is forgotten in the daily heat of smaller fights. In a world of 
</p>
<p>radical uncertainty, it is not easy to come up with a long-term strategy. But again, 
</p>
<p>we need to improve and make time for longer-term thinking. The development of 
</p>
<p>the European Patent Office&rsquo;s Scenarios for the Future was a good step in the right 
</p>
<p>direction.2 Following up on the EPO&rsquo;s work, we used A2K3, the Third Access to 
</p>
<p>Knowledge Conference, in Geneva in 2008, for a retreat type brainstorming exer-
</p>
<p>cise trying to clarify the vision and strategy for where we want to go. This is only 
</p>
<p>the beginning. More work needs to be done.
</p>
<p>question 8 The A2K movement is about both resistance to overbroad intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rules and alternatives to them. Resistance is born out of necessity. 
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the response to a crisis. But also and more importantly, A2K is about radical 
</p>
<p>alternatives to the maximalist intellectual property regime. It&rsquo;s simple&mdash;we can&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>keep fighting all the small fights forever. Civil society has limited resources and 
</p>
<p>time. And unlike human rights, I think this is an issue that can be fixed. Once we 
</p>
<p>are able to push through fundamental reforms such as, for example, the Medical 
</p>
<p>Innovation Prize Fund and R&amp;D Treaty, we won&rsquo;t need to fight against extended 
</p>
<p>data exclusivity, patent-term extension, and more generally, dangerous intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property chapters in free-trade agreements, where our ability to influence the 
</p>
<p>course of action is minimal.
</p>
<p>question 9 Tensions within the A2K movement? In the early days, I was amazed 
</p>
<p>by how excellent the collaboration between groups in the A2K movement was. 
</p>
<p>With the maturing of the movement&mdash;and of the proposals put forward&mdash;dif-
</p>
<p>ferences in opinion and strategy have emerged. I guess anything else would be a 
</p>
<p>surprise. This is an eclectic movement, and debates and disagreements will be an 
</p>
<p>integral part of it.
</p>
<p> I am not sure one can actually speak of &ldquo;governance&rdquo; of the movement in 
</p>
<p>the traditional sense. For example, nobody has ever dared to trademark the term 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;A2K.&rdquo; And there is no need to enforce its use. It&rsquo;s a vision that you join in because 
</p>
<p>you share it. &ldquo;Organized chaos&rdquo; would probably be one way to describe the move-
</p>
<p>ment&rsquo;s modus operandi: It is a distributed network, and every node can take action 
</p>
<p>and focus on what it thinks is the highest priority at any given moment. The more 
</p>
<p>urgent the cause or compelling the idea, the more nodes in the network will join 
</p>
<p>and amplify the movement&rsquo;s voice.

</p>
<p>question 10 I agree that A2K is an elite movement shaped to a large extent by 
</p>
<p>civil society and industry in the Global North. In the beginning, I struggled a lot 
</p>
<p>with that notion, because I thought this movement needs to be more global and 
</p>
<p>bottom-up. But I came to realize that this movement is different from others, yet I 
</p>
<p>think this is changing as we speak.
</p>
<p> Some thoughts on why the movement started out as it did: When the move-
</p>
<p>ment started out, the vision was broad, general, and sometimes abstract. And the 
</p>
<p>issues were new to many of us. It took some time to zoom in and identify the 
</p>
<p>concrete problems one could mobilize around, in all parts of the world. I think a 
</p>
<p>first important success is the fact that the global community of the blind has now 
</p>
<p>joined the movement, and we are together trying to solve the concrete problem 
</p>
<p>of access to knowledge for the visually impaired through a WIPO Treaty that will 
</p>
<p>mandate strong limitations and exceptions for the visually impaired.
</p>
<p> Also, it is always easier to mobilize successfully around a current, rather than a 
</p>
<p>possible future problem. And the A2K movement is very often about preventing a 
</p>
<p>bad future or creating a new future that is not always easy to imagine for a nonex-
</p>
<p>pert. The fight against the WIPO Treaty for Broadcasters, Cablecasters, and Webcast-
</p>
<p>ers is a good case in point. Related to this, piracy alleviated many of the problems 
</p>
<p>caused by a restrictive copyright regime in developing countries. And important 
</p>
<p>parts of the developing world were not on-line yet, and yet so many of the A2K 
</p>
<p>fights relate to the Internet. Both of the latter two factors are changing. Antipiracy 
</p>
<p>enforcement is getting more serious, and the developing countries are moving on-
</p>
<p>line. Hence, issues with which the Global North was concerned, such as for example 
</p>
<p>Internet service providers liability, are fast becoming an issue in the South.
</p>
<p> On a more general level, I recently participated in an interesting discussion 
</p>
<p>with developing country participants about open-access journals. Northern groups 
</p>
<p>have for years successfully advocated for things like the National Institutes of 
</p>
<p>Health Open Access Policy.3 Many of us thought that the South would follow suit. 
</p>
<p>However, Southern representatives have concerns around possible exploitation 
</p>
<p>of Southern knowledge by Northern commercial companies, and they view open-
</p>
<p>access journals as one potential means for this type of exploitation. This is to say 
</p>
<p>that the A2K movement has much more work to do here. The world is complex, 
</p>
<p>and it is a big mistake to assume that the South will blindly follow a Northern logic.
</p>
<p> All of this means that the A2K movement has absolutely to focus on getting 
</p>
<p>more Southern players involved. The time is right for that more intensive engage-
</p>
<p>ment with and by the South. Whether A2K will ever become a fully fledged grass-
</p>
<p>roots movement, I don&rsquo;t know. It will in certain instances, with certain campaigns. 
</p>
<p>But I also think that to win important fights, you do not necessarily always need 
</p>
<p>the masses on the streets. You need highly committed people with deep technical 
</p>
<p>franz </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>555
</p>
<p>and strategic knowledge, from all parts of the world, who can effectively work the 
</p>
<p>corridors of power and, where appropriate and possible, mobilize the masses.

</p>
<p>question 1 My group&mdash;IPLeft&mdash;was established in 1999 by members of social-
</p>
<p>movement organizations who were concerned about the ever increasing monopo-
</p>
<p>listic control of private enterprises over information and knowledge. We believed 
</p>
<p>that a monopoly on social assets such as information and knowledge had been 
</p>
<p>institutionalized and systemized by the intellectual property system, following a 
</p>
<p>trend rooted in global capitalism. The intellectual property system plays a central 
</p>
<p>role in information capitalism by making knowledge and information private prop-
</p>
<p>erty and commodities that can be produced and exchanged in the market, thereby 
</p>
<p>causing problems such as the digital divide, conflicts with basic human rights, 
</p>
<p>growing gaps in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor nations, and the 
</p>
<p>nondemocratic governance of social assets.
</p>
<p> In terms of strategies and tactics, our aims thus are not simply to criticize the 
</p>
<p>current intellectual property system. We also strive for a society where knowledge 
</p>
<p>and information are free, not commodities, and can be freely created and used as 
</p>
<p>social assets to be shared universally among people.
</p>
<p> Among the challenges and obstacles we have faced is the widespread assump-
</p>
<p>tion framing the issue that the protection of intellectual property is beneficial 
</p>
<p>for our nation&rsquo;s competitiveness. Actually, this assumption lacks theoretical and 
</p>
<p>practical justification in local contexts such as Korea, which has long been a net 
</p>
<p>importer of intellectual products. However, it has prevailed in the administrative 
</p>
<p>branches that are in charge of intellectual property matters and that have gov-
</p>
<p>erned the intellectual property agenda. In addition, intellectual property issues are 
</p>
<p>too arcane to be grasped by the public and even by legislative and judicial policy 
</p>
<p>makers. Those in other administrative branches and in the National Assembly nei-
</p>
<p>ther fully understand the meaning and implications of the intellectual property 
</p>
<p>issues nor have sufficient resources to take part in decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p>This is why the internal governance of those branches of the government con-
</p>
<p>cerned with intellectual property matters remains in the hands of a narrow group 
</p>
<p>of experts in intellectual property issues who subscribe to the assumption that 
</p>
<p>intellectual property protections are beneficial.
</p>
<p> The notion that stronger intellectual property protections are good for our 
</p>
<p>society is reinforced by global intellectual property rules and the influence of 
</p>
<p>ideas promoted by Korea&rsquo;s major trade partners, the United States, the European 
</p>
<p>Union, and Japan. Most domestic intellectual property norms have been discussed 
</p>
<p>virtual roundtable on a2k strategies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>556
</p>
<p>and determined in the context of international trade. In this process, the primary 
</p>
<p>focus of policy makers is on increasing our nation&rsquo;s competitiveness in the global 
</p>
<p>economic wars. But this concern with competitiveness is a narrow concept con-
</p>
<p>fined to issues of economic growth, or, more accurately, to the international com-
</p>
<p>petitiveness of domestic corporations. No other values are considered or seriously 
</p>
<p>taken into account by policy makers. Meanwhile, they view maximalist intellectual 
</p>
<p>property norms as international standards that were successfully implemented by 
</p>
<p>our industrialized trade partners in the globalized economy and therefore as some-
</p>
<p>thing on which they can rely, as well.
</p>
<p> Under these circumstances, our tactics are twofold: within the government, 
</p>
<p>debating with policy makers (mainly in the administrative branch) and lobbying 
</p>
<p>the legislative branch and in society at large, mobilizing social and cultural move-
</p>
<p>ments in favor of workable models of knowledge production and dissemination 
</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t rely on the intellectual property protection. For the purposes of the 
</p>
<p>first tactic, it is necessary to frame the issue differently, showing that contrary to 
</p>
<p>the reigning assumption, enhancing access to knowledge without relying on the 
</p>
<p>stronger protection of intellectual property rights also serves the progress of the 
</p>
<p>national economy and that the narrow concept of corporate competitiveness may 
</p>
<p>lead to unintended consequences that are harmful to the proper production of 
</p>
<p>socially needed knowledge.
</p>
<p> The A2K movement is helpful in pursuing these two tactics in that it changes 
</p>
<p>the horizon of global discussion, especially at the WIPO, which is a central forum 
</p>
<p>for the global intellectual property norms. International movements that can be 
</p>
<p>categorized under the rubric of A2K have evolved to provide a counterframe that 
</p>
<p>covers overall intellectual property norms and is not specific only to some particu-
</p>
<p>lar intellectual property issues.
</p>
<p> But I would like to point out a possible limitation for the A2K movement that 
</p>
<p>is related to an element crucial for its success: the localization of the global move-
</p>
<p>ment. The framing of A2K discussions as a debate between the Global North and 
</p>
<p>the South can raise obstacles to A2K mobilizations in middle-income countries 
</p>
<p>that occupy the ground between the wealthy, powerful countries and the poor and 
</p>
<p>less developed ones. For instance, some delegations from middle-income countries 
</p>
<p>downplay A2K discussions because they believe they are driven by the South for 
</p>
<p>the purposes of getting more money from the North. These delegations regard 
</p>
<p>the issues raised by the A2K movement as having little relevance to their nations. 
</p>
<p>This may marginalize nations that could play a leveraging role in the global discus-
</p>
<p>sion and may make it more difficult to move A2K issues higher on the agenda in 
</p>
<p>marginalized regions.

</p>
<p>question 2 In terms or sources for strategies for the A2K movement, I think 
</p>
<p>that resisting the TRIPS Agreement has been decisive in the evolution of A2K. 
</p>
<p>Farmers&rsquo; groups and access-to-medicine campaigners have long struggled against 
</p>
<p>intellectual property maximalism. They&rsquo;ve achieved something great. For instance, 
</p>
<p>the Doha Declaration is a great success. The activists mobilized during the strug-
</p>
<p>gles against intellectual property maximalism came to understand that they have 
</p>
<p>interests in common with other groups fighting against the intellectual property 
</p>
<p>maximalism in sectors such as education, libraries, software, privacy, freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression, and so on. The A2K movement is a result of efforts to bring together 
</p>
<p>diverse groups against a common enemy. However, achievements such as the Doha 
</p>
<p>Declaration solved only some of the problems: It redressed some of the imbalances 
</p>
<p>of practices and intellectual property norms between the North and the South. It 
</p>
<p>addressed problems in a specific sector, but it did not tackle the underlying mech-
</p>
<p>anism of global intellectual property systems.
</p>
<p>question 3 In general, an approach that is centered on the law entails both 
</p>
<p>opportunities and constraints. Social reform through the law can be a useful strat-
</p>
<p>egy in that the legitimacy of the reform can be easily established and the reform 
</p>
<p>can be sustained by the regulatory nature of the law. Considering the fact that 
</p>
<p>intellectual property norms have been extended to cover a wide range of fields and 
</p>
<p>have had important economic, social, and cultural consequences, it is partly inev-
</p>
<p>itable that the movement would concentrate on the legal aspects of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property issues for the purpose of short-term reform. Moreover, in consideration 
</p>
<p>of the fact that policy options at the national level are highly constrained by the 
</p>
<p>norms created in international legal institutions such as the WTO and WIPO, it is a 
</p>
<p>necessity to concentrate on legal issues.
</p>
<p> However, the strategy of pursuing reforms through law has limitations, 
</p>
<p>because the law is an expression or a reflection of power relations in a given soci-
</p>
<p>ety, indirectly, if not directly. Therefore, the A2K movement can hardly change 
</p>
<p>the essential elements of intellectual property without including broader cultural, 
</p>
<p>political, and social movements. Individuals, as social entities, can change the 
</p>
<p>existing social structure. However, this is possible only when they identify and 
</p>
<p>use the political opportunities open to them and turn their cultural constraints 
</p>
<p>into opportunities. The recent shift of U.S. courts toward the weaker protection 
</p>
<p>of patent rights and the advent of the Obama administration, for example, may 
</p>
<p>offer an opportunity to alter U.S. foreign policy on intellectual property mat-
</p>
<p>ters. Collective actions not directed at changes in the laws should be encouraged 
</p>
<p>as cultural movements. The Creative Commons and open access movements are 
</p>
<p>good examples of such mobilizations. A model for the production of knowledge 
</p>
<p>virtual roundtable on a2k strategies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>558
</p>
<p>on the basis of democratic and socially planned systems such as the democratic 
</p>
<p>planned participatory socialism (DPPS) model proposed by David Kotz is an even  
</p>
<p>better example.4
</p>
<p>question 4 My attitude toward institutions of governance and the governing 
</p>
<p>class is that I think the governing power is owned by the capitalistic class&mdash;the 
</p>
<p>transnational corporations. Although the nation-state and international or inter-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations play key roles, the internal actors are transnational 
</p>
<p>corporations.
</p>
<p>question 5 We need coalitions with both the private sector and governments. 
</p>
<p>I believe that unless governments and industries are members of the A2K coali-
</p>
<p>tion, we cannot accomplish what we are trying to do. The structures imposed on 
</p>
<p>us are too strong and powerful, and unless or until the A2K movement overturns 
</p>
<p>capitalism or fundamentally changes the capitalist world, we need the support of 
</p>
<p>sympathetic voices from mainstream groups. Moreover, reform of the intellectual 
</p>
<p>property laws is impossible without the participation of those in government.
</p>
<p>question 6 How we describe the A2K movement may depend on how we move 
</p>
<p>forward. I believe it should be a form of social movement. To bring together diverse 
</p>
<p>groups under the umbrella of A2K, we may need to design a more general ide-
</p>
<p>ational frame. I don&rsquo;t know if &ldquo;access to knowledge&rdquo; can be the one we need. It 
</p>
<p>appears to me that access to knowledge is more a means than an end. Unlike the 
</p>
<p>environmental movement, in which the catchwords of environment conservation 
</p>
<p>can easily be linked to the end&mdash;our survival&mdash;A2K seems to need discursive link 
</p>
<p>to an end. Why do we need access to knowledge? For innovation or culture? For 
</p>
<p>empowerment? Or for ensuring human rights?
</p>
<p>question 7 We already have short-term and long-term strategies. Changing the 
</p>
<p>mandate of WIPO through the Development Agenda, harmonizing copyright limi-
</p>
<p>tations and exceptions, patent-system reforms, and establishing global strategy 
</p>
<p>and action plans for the development of drugs for neglected diseases may be cat-
</p>
<p>egorized as short-term strategies. The proposed Medical Research and Develop-
</p>
<p>ment Treaty is a candidate for a long-term model, as long as it changes the existing 
</p>
<p>price-incentive mechanism to a DPPS system where all of the interest groups take 
</p>
<p>part in every cycle of innovation.
</p>
<p> As Susan Sell suggested in Private Power, Public Law, structural opportunities 
</p>
<p>and constraints need to be exploited in both short-term and long-term strategies.5 
</p>
<p>Existing structures offer either constraints or opportunities to those who are seek-
</p>
<p>ing to change the structure in some way. In this regard, structural changes in the 
</p>
<p>global economy and institutional changes, for instance, altering the attitude of the 
</p>
<p>nam </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>559
</p>
<p>U.S. Supreme Court on patent issues, need to be analyzed and pursued in more 
</p>
<p>systematic ways.
</p>
<p>question 8 I think the A2K movement already advocates thoroughgoing alter-
</p>
<p>natives to the current intellectual property system and is on the right track. The 
</p>
<p>World Intellectual Property Organization Development Agenda and World Health 
</p>
<p>Organization Medical Research and Development Treaty are good examples. Seek-
</p>
<p>ing radical changes in intergovernmental institutions is not a good strategy. Grad-
</p>
<p>ual changes can lead to a radical reform in the long run.
</p>
<p>questions 9 and 10 I agree that the agendas of the A2K movement are set pre-
</p>
<p>dominantly by NGOs and academics in the Global North, but I think that the issue 
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;for what&rdquo; they&rsquo;re set matters more than &ldquo;by whom&rdquo; they&rsquo;re set. For more par-
</p>
<p>ticipation by nonexperts and more importantly by grassroots individuals and orga-
</p>
<p>nizations, we may need a larger conceptual umbrella&mdash;for instance, human rights 
</p>
<p>perspectives on intellectual property.
</p>
<p> Many scholars and commentators have identified a conflict between intellec-
</p>
<p>tual property rights and human rights. A comprehensive human rights framework 
</p>
<p>still requires further elaboration, and coherent solutions to address the conflict 
</p>
<p>between the two norms need to be proposed and examined. In order to develop 
</p>
<p>a comprehensive and coherent framework for human rights approaches in global 
</p>
<p>intellectual property policies, I would suggest establishing a link between inter-
</p>
<p>national human rights organizations and international intellectual property insti-
</p>
<p>tutions such as WIPO and the WTO/TRIPS Council. For instance, WIPO and the 
</p>
<p>TRIPS Council could establish special standing bodies mandated to assess and 
</p>
<p>monitor their activities and their operating treaties and to evaluate what are the 
</p>
<p>possible or actual effects on human rights. Such assessments and monitoring could 
</p>
<p>be carried out by consulting with other international human rights organizations 
</p>
<p>and made public regularly.

<p>question 1 I have primarily adopted strategies and tactics that are familiar from 
</p>
<p>the worlds of political economy and law&mdash;I do a lot of research on the founda-
</p>
<p>tions of the issues, and I have worked on legal tools (contracts and policy analysis) 
</p>
<p>that achieve some of the goals of the A2K movement, such as Creative Commons 
</p>
<p>licensing and open-innovation legal frameworks. I have also used some traditional 
</p>
<p>pedagogical tools as a law professor, including regular e-learning courses, class syl-
</p>
<p>labus and content creation, and the hosting of conferences and workshops around 
</p>
<p>topics central to A2K issues such as copyright, open access and open educational

</p>
<p>resources, open innovation, and distributive innovation and its effects on patent 
</p>
<p>law and policy and cooperation and technology transfer agreements. These are 
</p>
<p>strategies that are not specific to the A2K coalition, but rather more traditional 
</p>
<p>strategies related to capacity building and awareness raising.
</p>
<p> I think the A2K movement has clearly learned some lessons from several other 
</p>
<p>movements, however. The environmental movement&mdash;and actually, the human 
</p>
<p>rights movement&mdash;bring aspects of both political economy and direct protest 
</p>
<p>action to bear on global public opinion, and that dual-aspect approach can be seen 
</p>
<p>reflected in the legal work of James Boyle, Yochai Benkler, and Lawrence Lessig, as 
</p>
<p>well as at FreeCulture.org and other more activist groups.
</p>
<p> My hope would be that we could follow Boyle&rsquo;s call of an environmentalism of 
</p>
<p>the public domain and learn to work together a little more, though not to formal-
</p>
<p>ize that working together through defined governance structure. I mean more a 
</p>
<p>common agreement on philosophy and an agreement to spend more time on com-
</p>
<p>mon problems than on intermovement disagreements. There is some internal per-
</p>
<p>sonal conflict between people and organizations in the movement, which is not so 
</p>
<p>unusual in a broad and diverse coalition of stakeholders, but it would be better if 
</p>
<p>we could all agree we are working toward a common goal of more access to knowl-
</p>
<p>edge and focus our energy on those who oppose us, rather than on those of us 
</p>
<p>within the movement with whom we disagree on matters of degree, rather than 
</p>
<p>matters of importance. We also could learn from the growth of on-line communi-
</p>
<p>ties and their associated governance norms and dispute-resolution alternatives, on 
</p>
<p>which the recent work of Yochai Benkler and others at the Berkman Center focus. 
</p>
<p>Transparency and cooperation are core values for the success of the movement.
</p>
<p>question 2 The current organizations that are seen as part of the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>have given it its character. You have elements from civil society that come from the 
</p>
<p>AIDS/HIV movement of the 1990s turning into access-to-medicine discourse and 
</p>
<p>student movements such as FreeCulture doing cause-based activism and bringing 
</p>
<p>a public-interest conscience to courses of law, communications, media, and medi-
</p>
<p>cine. You also have lawyers who moved from the entertainment, telecommunica-
</p>
<p>tions, and biotech industries to develop A2K strategies based on lobbying strate-
</p>
<p>gies, as the WIPO Development Agenda and also the open-access movement may 
</p>
<p>show. In this sense, the movement can be considered a result of a convergence of 
</p>
<p>old movements and new movements that found a common point for discussion and 
</p>
<p>discourse building.
</p>
<p>question 3 As a lawyer, I am perhaps the wrong person to ask about whether 
</p>
<p>the centrality of legal struggles in the A2K movement is a good idea! However, it 
</p>
<p>is true that we too often battle in the world of the law, and the law is frequently 
</p>
<p>virtual roundtable on a2k strategies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>562
</p>
<p>designed in a way that favors those already in positions of power, such as the con-
</p>
<p>tent owners. Additionally, policy makers and lawmakers look abroad to replicate 
</p>
<p>the solutions they find there. The recent international emulation of the Bayh-
</p>
<p>Dole University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act, which gave universi-
</p>
<p>ties, small businesses, and nonprofits intellectual property control over the results 
</p>
<p>of government-funded research, is an example. Thus, law can be an answer, but  
</p>
<p>also a problem.
</p>
<p> In regard to the A2K movement, there are perhaps two segments. The first 
</p>
<p>would see the goal as an almost complete change in the system. This could include 
</p>
<p>both the A2K Treaty, which does involve a lot of work with lawyers, WIPO, and 
</p>
<p>international governments, but also the direct activism of the Defective by Design 
</p>
<p>and FreeCulture groups. This group could also include those who want to reform 
</p>
<p>the international conventions and treaties around copyright and who challenge 
</p>
<p>the national legal implementations of those treaties and conventions. We could 
</p>
<p>attribute to this group the recent efforts on exceptions and limitations to copyright 
</p>
<p>and patent rights currently under discussion at WIPO.
</p>
<p> The second group would be those who are working to make the effect of the 
</p>
<p>current system less bad, using the system we have to achieve open goals today 
</p>
<p>even before international legal change is achieved. This would be groups such as 
</p>
<p>Creative Commons, the Free Software Foundation, and Cambia in Australia. This 
</p>
<p>set of groups is definitely based on using legal tools as a practical method to make 
</p>
<p>life better for people during the long struggles to change the laws and treaties. 
</p>
<p>These and others try to provide standards that will make things more interopera-
</p>
<p>ble and transparent and try to foster cooperation in different sectors. They attempt 
</p>
<p>to make the right to participate in culture and science a reality.
</p>
<p> However, as the A2K debate evolves, the line between the two segments is 
</p>
<p>becoming less and less clear. The increasing collaboration between groups and 
</p>
<p>their openness to a diversity of voices, including the participation of the Global 
</p>
<p>South, has brought an incredible maturity to the movement, which is reflected in 
</p>
<p>much more complex and sustainable proposals.
</p>
<p>question 4 My attitude toward institutions of governance and those who govern 
</p>
<p>has been shaped by the fact that the majority of my life has been lived in countries 
</p>
<p>with established or new democracies. In all cases, I believe that government plays 
</p>
<p>a crucial role in balancing power within the society through mechanisms of repre-
</p>
<p>sentation. I also see the use of political instruments that may be able to open the 
</p>
<p>opportunity for a more concrete societal participation in the decision-making pro-
</p>
<p>cess. This is true internationally, as well, via multilateral forums where governments, 
</p>
<p>through decision-making processes within international organizations, have allowed 
</p>
<p>increasing participation by civil-society organizations in multilateral arenas.
</p>
<p>rossini </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>563
</p>
<p> Other institutions of governance, such as international organizations, are also 
</p>
<p>necessary to provide multilateral and possibly transparent forums for negotiation 
</p>
<p>and policy making. Thus, in general, I think they are necessary. However, as in any 
</p>
<p>institution of governance, mechanisms of checks and balances are crucial. These 
</p>
<p>organizations can be and often are captured, which means that their benefits 
</p>
<p>are very dependent on the willingness of our movement to engage within them, 
</p>
<p>observe them, and so on.
</p>
<p>question 5 I think a great part of the private sector has tended to be antagonis-
</p>
<p>tic to the A2K coalition, because the majority of business models that relate to 
</p>
<p>A2K are based on control, and not on sharing. Business is still learning how to be 
</p>
<p>open and how to make money for its investors. But there are clearly some business 
</p>
<p>models that would allow companies to be part of the A2K coalition. Open-access 
</p>
<p>publishers in science that use the Creative Commons attribution license, known by 
</p>
<p>its acronym CC-BY, would probably meet that definition, and in 2008, the top two 
</p>
<p>corporate open-access publishers created more than $15,000,000 U.S. in revenues 
</p>
<p>without relying on control. We also observe these changes toward open business 
</p>
<p>models in the music and textbook industries, with the innovative company Flat 
</p>
<p>World Knowledge, but I think most of the private industrial models would have to 
</p>
<p>be service models, and not control models, to qualify.
</p>
<p> Governments are a hard question, because &ldquo;government&rdquo; is a complex entity 
</p>
<p>that is very reliant on local factors, and thus it is hard to make general statements 
</p>
<p>about it. Australia&rsquo;s government has endorsed open licensing and membership in the 
</p>
<p>global digital commons for its publicly funded content. Brazil is one of the leaders 
</p>
<p>of the WIPO Development Agenda and has recently proposed discussions on excep-
</p>
<p>tions and limitations to patents at WIPO. The Brazilian government is also playing 
</p>
<p>an important part in fostering the use of open-licensing schemes for content (open-
</p>
<p>access and open educational resources) and software. But does that make them 
</p>
<p>part of the coalition? I don&rsquo;t know. It definitely makes Australia and Brazil friendly 
</p>
<p>places for the movement and for coalition work, but it is also something that can 
</p>
<p>change in a single election or with the change of leaders at the ministries.
</p>
<p>question 6 Is A2K a movement, a coalition, an aspiration? For now, I think A2K 
</p>
<p>still is a movement. There is still no clear ecosystem in place. Organizations still do 
</p>
<p>not recognize other organizations that are clearly adopters of the same agenda, 
</p>
<p>and you do not meet all people you would expect to meet at the annual confer-
</p>
<p>ences. Maybe this is a matter of dispute for funding, maybe this is a matter of a 
</p>
<p>top-down approach, or maybe it is just because the movement is in its youth.
</p>
<p> I consider myself a network maker, in addition to my role and professional 
</p>
<p>focus in academia, capacity building and advocacy. By this I mean that I believe in 
</p>
<p>virtual roundtable on a2k strategies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>564
</p>
<p>people working together, and I believe that alliances and the recognition of diver-
</p>
<p>sity inside the movement is a plus, and not a minus. In all steps I take, I try to 
</p>
<p>recognize common efforts and agendas and to integrate people and projects with 
</p>
<p>my projects or point out possible collaborations and opportunities among projects 
</p>
<p>I see within the movement. I also try to connect pieces of my professional and per-
</p>
<p>sonal networks that represent different segments of the A2K movement to each 
</p>
<p>other, such as the open-access movement to the open-education movement or 
</p>
<p>those engaged in socially responsible licensing work to the patent reformers or the 
</p>
<p>access-to-medicines groups. Personal connections between different groups who 
</p>
<p>follow the same general philosophy can be a powerful way to coordinate us that 
</p>
<p>does not require the strong powers of governance and that also therefore cannot 
</p>
<p>be captured. This, however, also has its downside, because the strength of personal 
</p>
<p>networks can be used to exclude divergent or new opinions.
</p>
<p>question 7 Short-term strategies do not have to diverge from long-term strate-
</p>
<p>gies. Specific tactics may vary, but not the final goal. We have tools that allow 
</p>
<p>us to opt out of the current system and to build capacity outside the imbalances 
</p>
<p>of copyright and closed access and closed sources, and those are good short-term 
</p>
<p>tools and strategies. It is immoral to have a strategy that says we should not use 
</p>
<p>tools that help people gain immediate access to health information, cultural infor-
</p>
<p>mation, and scientific innovation. So we have to think about the actual needs of 
</p>
<p>people as a key part of our strategy, short-term and long-term, and the reality is 
</p>
<p>that A2K issues as such are not a part of lots of people&rsquo;s lives, but having clin-
</p>
<p>ics that have recent clinical documents about AIDS or access to genetic testing or 
</p>
<p>generic medicines is a part of people&rsquo;s lives. Thus, strategies can help in this con-
</p>
<p>text to ease immediate pressures and problems.
</p>
<p> But in the long term, we have to maintain pressure on the international con-
</p>
<p>ventions and treaties and on the effect of those in national policy and law. We 
</p>
<p>can do that successfully if we stay together as a movement. Again, I&rsquo;m basing my 
</p>
<p>thoughts on Boyle&rsquo;s metaphor of the environmental movement. The short-term 
</p>
<p>strategies of recycling locally or composting organics are similar to the licens-
</p>
<p>ing strategies of Creative Commons and the Free Software Foundation, but the 
</p>
<p>strategy of thinking globally about carbon emissions, the Kyoto protocols and the 
</p>
<p>negotiations on climate change and how these relate to innovation and access to 
</p>
<p>knowledge and technology is more similar to treaty discussions. We need a big 
</p>
<p>enough strategy to integrate both of these approaches. Otherwise, we risk not 
</p>
<p>only dividing ourselves, but letting those who oppose the coalition generally find 
</p>
<p>ways to attack both short-term and long-term strategies by pointing only at our 
</p>
<p>divisions and thus not responding to the realities of our arguments.

<p>question 8 The majority of current strategies of A2K actors&mdash;even some that 
</p>
<p>may be seen as positive&mdash;are, in the end, primarily resistant. This is not a terrible 
</p>
<p>thing in some ways, but it also reflects the power of the movement for greater 
</p>
<p>intellectual property restrictions in controlling the debate. Arguing against an 
</p>
<p>intellectual property maximalist approach is probably more a reaction to strong 
</p>
<p>intellectual property restrictions than it is a uniquely derived strategy. It is hard to 
</p>
<p>separate the two sides of this same coin.
</p>
<p> Each organization that can be considered part of the A2K movement has its 
</p>
<p>own history, but even some that took positive actions for generating something 
</p>
<p>new, such as the Creative Commons or recent efforts on innovation metrics not 
</p>
<p>based just in patents, appeared as reactions to the nearly permanent extensions 
</p>
<p>of copyright duration or the centrality of patents. Also, I have not yet seen true 
</p>
<p>and consistent proposals of more thoroughgoing alternatives to this system. Some 
</p>
<p>proposals on alternatives to patent systems, such as the creation of a prize system, 
</p>
<p>are thoughtful options. However, I do not see how any of them can be applied in 
</p>
<p>the context of poor countries, for example.
</p>
<p> Finally, civil society and academe operate at a different pace in comparison 
</p>
<p>with government and business. This may be a result from a lack of consistent 
</p>
<p>funding or from the nature of business models, but it also reflects a gap in capacity 
</p>
<p>in terms of training, research, and organization. This implies that we will always be 
</p>
<p>behind and reacting.

</p>
<p> There are some technically oriented approaches that have the potential to tran-
</p>
<p>scend the intellectual property debate advanced by people both inside the A2K 
</p>
<p>coalition and outside, especially in the area of semantic computing. This represents 
</p>
<p>ideas and knowledge in formats that are less likely to be creative expressions and 
</p>
<p>thus less likely to be considered in the framework of intellectual property rights. 
</p>
<p>If this approach is successful, we can have a debate about knowledge that is less 
</p>
<p>situated inside the intellectual property discourses framed by Disney, for example, 
</p>
<p>because Disney cares more about controlling its properties than about semantic 
</p>
<p>computing, and thus there is more rhetorical space to develop positive agendas.
</p>
<p> But because the movement was indeed created inside the framework of intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights, these kinds of approaches can actually be hard to get 
</p>
<p>endorsed inside the coalition, because they do not fit the coalition&rsquo;s own preferred 
</p>
<p>frames of rhetoric. Similarly, we tend to see problems with intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights everywhere and thus reach for intellectual property rights solutions, when 
</p>
<p>if we could instead see technical solutions, or business solutions, or capacity-
</p>
<p>building solutions, we might find better answers. We should be more interdisci-
</p>
<p>plinary in our conception of both the problems and the solutions, and we should 
</p>
<p>look for ways to escape the old structures of intellectual property rights debates 
</p>
<p>that force us to fight powerful forces advocating increases in intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights. This could be part of the movement that would be really valuable, to 
</p>
<p>help get out of the intellectual property rights position and create interdisciplinary 
</p>
<p>knowledge sharing inside the coalition.
</p>
<p>question 9 I see tensions in the movement, and as I said before, these may be 
</p>
<p>caused by disputes over scarce resources, as well as by the desire to establish one-
</p>
<p>self as a novel thinker, and being a &ldquo;regular part of the movement&rdquo; is not suf-
</p>
<p>ficient to do that. However, tensions are not necessarily bad things, since we 
</p>
<p>need to allow the emergence of new organizations, groups, and positions that can 
</p>
<p>bring diversity and creativity to the movement. We should be avoiding the con-
</p>
<p>solidation of an A2K &ldquo;aristocracy.&rdquo; The minute we begin to talk about movement 
</p>
<p>governance, it stops being a grassroots movement and begins to entrench power  
</p>
<p>inside structures.
</p>
<p>question 10 I agree that A2K is an elite movement mostly shaped by Northern 
</p>
<p>players. However, if you listen closely to some of these players, mainly research 
</p>
<p>institutes and NGOs, you will find a Southern voice in almost all of them. Also, 
</p>
<p>in recent years, organizations from the Global South have gained a voice in spe-
</p>
<p>cific issues, such as access to medicines. However, these may still be considered 
</p>
<p>the voices of an &ldquo;elite&rdquo; from the South. This might be due to the fact that some 
</p>
<p>core strategies of the movement still ask for skills that are not well distributed in 
</p>
<p>rossini </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>567
</p>
<p>society. Taking this into consideration, core players of the A2K movement have 
</p>
<p>a moral duty to include, in any action, an element of capacity building and net-
</p>
<p>work building. For this to happen, the movement needs to be able to recognize the 
</p>
<p>vocabularies of the human rights movement, of the environmental movement, of 
</p>
<p>the civil rights movement, and be able to build links that can guarantee a broader 
</p>
<p>social legitimacy.

</p>
<p>question 1 In order to describe the strategies and tactics we have adopted 
</p>
<p>regarding intellectual property and A2K issues in Sri Lanka, I need to begin with a 
</p>
<p>brief survey of the A2K movement there. In Sri Lanka, there are several organiza-
</p>
<p>tions, groups, and individuals who engage with what could be described as A2K-
</p>
<p>related issues concerning intellectual property rights. However, the term &ldquo;A2K&rdquo; is 
</p>
<p>not established as yet, and those who are involved in this type of work do not nec-
</p>
<p>essarily recognize or realize that they are part of a common movement to ensure 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge. The Open University of Sri Lanka, which is conducting a 
</p>
<p>study on the issue, recognizes both &ldquo;formal&rdquo; and &ldquo;traditional/informal&rdquo; knowledge 
</p>
<p>as knowledge that is under threat by the intellectual property rights regime and 
</p>
<p>identifies a range of organizations, groups, and individuals who are involved in 
</p>
<p>different ways in ensuring A2K. Most prominent are the existing or emerging ini-
</p>
<p>tiatives one could call a &ldquo;free and open-source software (FOSS) movement,&rdquo; an 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;antiglobalization movement,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;seeds movement.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> The FOSS movement in Sri Lanka mostly consists of experts in software who 
</p>
<p>contribute to the development and spread of free and open-source software, 
</p>
<p>although it can be argued that the potential membership is much larger than this. 
</p>
<p>With the passing of the Intellectual Property Act in 2003 and the gradual imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of that law since 2006&ndash;2007, there is a growing realization among aca-
</p>
<p>demics, students, researchers, the media, and the general public who use PCs that 
</p>
<p>they will not be able to afford software under the existing intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights regime. As a result, several universities, schools, state institutions, and 
</p>
<p>NGOs are converting to FOSS.
</p>
<p> The Sri Lankan antiglobalization movement, however, is not a movement in the 
</p>
<p>true sense, but consists of several Colombo-based NGOs and their network of com-
</p>
<p>munity based organizations (CBOs) spread across the country. They engage with 
</p>
<p>A2K issues through their strong critique of free-trade mechanisms and the privati-
</p>
<p>zation of and granting of monopoly rights over intellectual contributions. The anti-
</p>
<p>globalization movement has yet to incorporate the term &ldquo;A2K&rdquo; into its discourse or 
</p>
<p>to identify their role in protecting A2K per se.

</p>
<p> The seeds movement is a movement whose work in safeguarding access for 
</p>
<p>farmers&rsquo; rights to use seeds as a public good would lead to safeguarding access 
</p>
<p>to traditional knowledge (A2TK) in agriculture. Intellectual property rights are 
</p>
<p>not the first or the only threat to accessing traditional knowledge in agriculture. 
</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;Green Revolution&rdquo; has played a major role in the disappearance of 
</p>
<p>traditional seeds and hence of the traditional knowledge that was protected and 
</p>
<p>embodied in traditional seeds.6 Intellectual property rights, however, pose the next 
</p>
<p>serious threat to A2TK in agriculture. A strong lobbying group consisting of several 
</p>
<p>influential and prominent lawyers, activists, and a few civil-society organizations 
</p>
<p>works in this area, defending A2TK in agriculture from already implemented laws. 
</p>
<p>When the Intellectual Property Bill was introduced in 2002&ndash;2003, it was challenged 
</p>
<p>by these groups before the Supreme Court as being unconstitutional. The challenges 
</p>
<p>resulted in the exclusion of microorganisms from patenting except for transgenic 
</p>
<p>organisms and the inclusion of flexibilities, including parallel imports and compul-
</p>
<p>sory licensing, in the current patent law. This in fact has led to the strange sce-
</p>
<p>nario of the section on patents in the Intellectual Property Act of 2003 being much 
</p>
<p>more progressive than the section on copyrights from an access point of view. 
</p>
<p>Education about the implications of intellectual property rights on A2TK in agri-
</p>
<p>culture is spreading in Sri Lanka, while a movement to save and share traditional 
</p>
<p>seeds initiated among several NGOs and farmer groups has been growing. More and 
</p>
<p>more farmers in villages realize and are worried about the loss of traditional seeds 
</p>
<p>in the face of the use of commercial seeds that have flooded the market since the  
</p>
<p>Green Revolution.
</p>
<p> In addition to these three trends, access to traditional knowledge in health can 
</p>
<p>also be identified as a component of an A2K movement. A2K in health in Sri Lanka 
</p>
<p>is mainly expressed as resistance to gene piracy in local plant varieties&mdash;the smug-
</p>
<p>gling out of the country and patenting of local plant varieties, mainly in the United 
</p>
<p>States, Japan, and Europe&mdash;that are historically used in treating patients. Work is 
</p>
<p>also being done by a few individuals in the medical field and their organizations 
</p>
<p>in relation to intellectual property rights and the health industry with regard to 
</p>
<p>drugs, patents, and the pharmaceutical industry. However, the work is conducted 
</p>
<p>mainly in the English language and targets special and limited audiences.
</p>
<p> There are as yet no self-conscious links between the FOSS movement, the anti-
</p>
<p>globalization movement, and the seeds movement, reflecting the fact that these 
</p>
<p>issues have not been conceptualized as a part of the broader issue of monop-
</p>
<p>oly rights provided by the intellectual property rights regime over intellectual 
</p>
<p>contributions.
</p>
<p> The study and advocacy campaign conducted by the Open University can be 
</p>
<p>considered one of the first attempts to conceptualize all these mobilizations under 
</p>
<p>witharana and amarasuriya </p>

</p>
<p>the overall theme of A2K in Sri Lanka and an opportunity to watch a local A2K 
</p>
<p>movement in the making.
</p>
<p> That said, players who can be considered part of the Sri Lankan A2K mobi-
</p>
<p>lization can be seen using a range of strategies. From our own experience at the 
</p>
<p>Open University, defining the A2K movement in the broadest possible sense is 
</p>
<p>itself a useful strategy. We define the A2K movement as a loose alliance of hun-
</p>
<p>dreds of actors, each playing his or her own role in distinct areas. This approach, 
</p>
<p>we believe, will inject a strong dose of confidence that will help participants play 
</p>
<p>their respective roles more effectively. But it also creates a need, or at least the 
</p>
<p>space, for a collective entity to play a role as coordinator and to highlight the A2K 
</p>
<p>aspects of each group. From a Sri Lankan perspective, it is too early to comment 
</p>
<p>about an evolution of modus operandi.
</p>
<p>question 2 In terms of shared strategies, the FOSS initiative in Sri Lanka is very 
</p>
<p>much a part of the global FOSS movement. The Free and Open Software Commu-
</p>
<p>nity in Sri Lanka (http://foss.lk), the Lanka Linux User Group (http://www.lug.
</p>
<p>lk), TLC, the Linux Centre (http://thelinuxcenter.lk) and LSF, the Lanka Software 
</p>
<p>Foundation (http://www.opensource.lk) can be identified as the main actors of 
</p>
<p>the Sri Lankan FOSS movement. The small, Colombo-based FOSS community is 
</p>
<p>spreading slowly within the country. It is very much linked with the global FOSS 
</p>
<p>movement and in fact has made significant contributions for the development of 
</p>
<p>FOSS. The introduction of transaction protocols, disaster-management software 
</p>
<p>initiated after the tsunami, reliable messaging protocols, operating systems to 
</p>
<p>address the issue of lack of support for the Sinhala language unicode system, and 
</p>
<p>applications bundled with Linux distributions are some of the contributions.
</p>
<p> The antiglobalization movement also is not a Sri Lankan product in its general 
</p>
<p>content and strategies. Its themes, activities, focus, and sources of information 
</p>
<p>are very much dependent on international resources. The members of the move-
</p>
<p>ment consist mainly of NGOs and depend heavily on funding from international 
</p>
<p>sources. They operate as members of regional and global networks and hence are 
</p>
<p>guided by the themes and work plans established at the international level. Some 
</p>
<p>of the campaigns of the antiglobalization movement go unnoticed as a result of 
</p>
<p>a lack of awareness by the general public of the themes based on which these 
</p>
<p>campaigns are organized. Expertise on issues is generally developed by partici-
</p>
<p>pation in regional and international forums, and what we see in Sri Lanka is the 
</p>
<p>application of those on the ground in building Sri Lankan cases. The work, how-
</p>
<p>ever, in some cases has resulted in sustainable initiatives. Some of the academic 
</p>
<p>research conducted originally was initiated by NGOs and was facilitated by NGO 
</p>
<p>funding. Some of the political parties incorporated action against adverse effects 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>570
</p>
<p>of globalization as a result of the initial work done by NGOs. There is, however, a 
</p>
<p>long way to go to see an antiglobalization movement that is sustainable and that 
</p>
<p>operates on an agenda originated from local concerns.
</p>
<p> The seeds movement can be seen as a mixture of international and local influ-
</p>
<p>ences. Surprisingly, the practice of saving traditional seeds, which one would 
</p>
<p>expect to be a natural concern of Sri Lankan farmers, needed to be reintroduced 
</p>
<p>to farmers with the facilitation of external funding channeled through local NGOs. 
</p>
<p>The mind-set created by the Green Revolution that considers high-yielding variet-
</p>
<p>ies to be profit makers made the exercise of reintroducing the saving and cultivat-
</p>
<p>ing of traditional seeds difficult. In contrast, protests against biotheft and biopiracy 
</p>
<p>were spontaneous and considered by the Sri Lankan public to be national issues to 
</p>
<p>which they could relate to easily. The public memory of mass-scale theft during the 
</p>
<p>450 years of colonial occupation may have played a role with regard to this.
</p>
<p> The strategies of intervention by some of the activists and groups working on 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights and seeds seems to follow a strategy different from 
</p>
<p>that of the general seeds movement consisting of many of the foreign-funded 
</p>
<p>NGOs. While NGOs prefer to maintain minimum engagement with state mecha-
</p>
<p>nisms and political parties, these activists and groups have not been averse to 
</p>
<p>World Intellectual Property Organization 
</p>

</p>
<p>int/freepublications/en/).
</p>
<p>witharana and amarasuriya </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>working with such mechanisms and parties. The links they maintain with the 
</p>
<p>state and with political parties have allowed them access to inside information and 
</p>
<p>influence in the formulation of policies and legal texts.
</p>
<p> One important reason they have this access is their ability to isolate the issue 
</p>
<p>in question and to focus only on it when engaging with the government and state 
</p>
<p>structures. For example, the stand of the government or political parties on achiev-
</p>
<p>ing peace in Sri Lanka was not taken to be a barrier to dealing with it on other 
</p>
<p>issues, such as intellectual property rights and seeds. The minimum engagement 
</p>
<p>by NGOs with the state, and sometimes their hostility to it, on the other hand, 
</p>
<p>and their disregard of political parties as influential actors can be traced back to 
</p>
<p>their ideology of identifying &ldquo;civil society&rdquo; as a distinct and an exclusive category 
</p>
<p>and a model of righteousness and justice and hence to their claim to occupy the 
</p>
<p>moral high ground in their interventions. NGO involvement is also confined to the 
</p>
<p>boundaries of the mandated projects for which money is received. The long-term 
</p>
<p>commitment that is required to form a movement is not provided by project fund-
</p>
<p>ing that has short-term goals. Funding has also created a situation where work is 
</p>
<p>not done after the evaporation of funding, leaving many of the initiatives aban-
</p>
<p>doned at the end of the project term. Voluntarism, which should be an essential 
</p>
<p>item in forming a movement, is hence hard to find.
</p>
<p>question 3 On the issue of the A2K movement and the law, there is a need to 
</p>
<p>establish A2K as a right irrespective of the existence of the intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights regime. In the Sri Lankan context, there are many other important barriers 
</p>
<p>that restrict A2K other than intellectual property rights. Two such important barri-
</p>
<p>ers include a serious lack of infrastructure facilities that have no significant link to 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights issues (libraries, electricity, computers, and so on) and 
</p>
<p>language barriers that result from the fact that knowledge is comprehensively avail-
</p>
<p>able only in the colonial language of English. Therefore, A2K needs to be a move-
</p>
<p>ment that reaches beyond a legalistic focus and beyond intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p> Moreover, laws are made by people, and hence they can be changed by people. 
</p>
<p>A2K should be understood as a movement that exists beyond the texts and inter-
</p>
<p>pretations of the law. A dialogue on A2K should be based on principles and values, 
</p>
<p>rather than functioning as a mere response to existing intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>law. The values of equity and justice provide a solid ground for the A2K movement 
</p>
<p>to stand on its own, rather than becoming a mere response to intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights issues. UN conventions and chapters on fundamental rights in the constitu-
</p>
<p>tions of individual countries provide legal, ethical, and moral grounds to expand 
</p>
<p>the scope of the A2K movement to address a whole range of barriers&mdash;barriers 
</p>
<p>that also include intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>virtual roundtable on a2k strategies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>572
</p>
<p>question 4 At a fundamental level, the objectives of A2K and the objectives of 
</p>
<p>the private sector are not in harmony with each other and in fact conflict in many 
</p>
<p>occasions. A2K is about rights, while the main and the only drive behind private 
</p>
<p>sector is profit. In fact, the intellectual property rights regime we see today is not 
</p>
<p>a result of hard-fought campaigns by the public for the protection of their intellec-
</p>
<p>tual contributions, but mainly a result of advocacy by multinational software and 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies to enhance their profits. The origin of the A2K move-
</p>
<p>ment can be traced back to the date when intellectual contributions were made 
</p>
<p>private property, thereby opening space for profit making.
</p>
<p> Governments, on the contrary, as the institution responsible for formulating 
</p>
<p>laws and policies and implementing plans, have a strong role to play in A2K and 
</p>
<p>should be coalition partner of the A2K movement. As the mechanism that has the 
</p>
<p>primary responsibility for ensuring basic rights for all citizens, there is nothing 
</p>
<p>theoretically to prevent a government becoming a coalition partners of A2K. How-
</p>
<p>ever, the fact that most governments do not work in the interests of the public 
</p>
<p>needs also to be noted. Thus, it is also vitally important for the public to be aware 
</p>
<p>of and motivated to protect and fight for their interests.
</p>
<p>question 6 A2K could be a movement, a coalition, an aspiration and also a right. 
</p>
<p>Bringing all groups involved with A2K issues under one A2K umbrella and get-
</p>
<p>ting them to communicate with each other is important because that will make 
</p>
<p>them realize that A2K as an essential right of people that is being violated in many 
</p>
<p>ways and on many fronts and that mobilization for A2K should not be limited to 
</p>
<p>countering the monopoly power of, for example, Microsoft in software. It would 
</p>
<p>also make them realize that there are many others involved in many ways with 
</p>
<p>the movement and that it is necessary for these groups as a collective to overcome 
</p>
<p>their feelings of disempowerment.
</p>
<p> The seeds movement in Sri Lanka provides a good example of coordinated 
</p>
<p>action. Activists on the ideological, legal, and farmer fronts complement each oth-
</p>
<p>ers&rsquo; work, mobilizing people, advocating, safeguarding legal spaces in court bat-
</p>
<p>tles, and saving and sharing local varieties of seeds.
</p>
<p>questions 7 and 8 It is too early to comment on future strategies within the Sri 
</p>
<p>Lankan context because there is no A2K movement as such, but movements that 
</p>
<p>have A2K components within their overall aims as described above.
</p>
<p>questions 9 and 10 The question of the governance of the A2K movement is 
</p>
<p>bound up with the status of knowledge itself. If one investigates the history of 
</p>
<p>knowledge generation and how knowledge is used as a tool of power by some over 
</p>
<p>others, knowledge itself could be identified as a tool of elite domination. The ques-
</p>
<p>tions of what knowledge is, which forms or types of knowledge are superior, and 
</p>
<p>witharana and amarasuriya </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>573
</p>
<p>the issue of the domination of a particular type of knowledge over others have 
</p>
<p>pervaded human history. Categorization of some forms of knowledge as &ldquo;formal&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>and some other forms as &ldquo;informal&rdquo; or &ldquo;&lsquo;traditional&rdquo; reflects this reality. Treating 
</p>
<p>Western medicine as formal knowledge and treating the science of local medical 
</p>
<p>practice as traditional knowledge is a good example. This categorization of formal 
</p>
<p>and traditional knowledge has brought the practitioners of Western medicine to 
</p>
<p>the center while leaving local medical practitioners at the periphery.
</p>
<p> However, the legitimacy of a knowledge system does not necessarily depend 
</p>
<p>on its ability to explain things or its use value. Attaining formal status is a process 
</p>
<p>that involves power. The science of local medical treatment, which can be consid-
</p>
<p>ered to be holistic in approach and far superior in logic, with minimal side effects, 
</p>
<p>is considered &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; as a result of global power dynamics. The practice of 
</p>
<p>the intellectual property rights regime in considering published knowledge as 
</p>
<p>valid prior knowledge and in offering intellectual property regime flexibilities only 
</p>
<p>for &ldquo;scientific research&rdquo; (as is the case in Sri Lankan patent law) makes holders 
</p>
<p>of formal knowledge elites and denigrates the holders of traditional knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Within such a context, it is important that when we refer to the term &ldquo;A2K,&rdquo; we 
</p>
<p>ask &ldquo;Access to what knowledge?&rdquo; And access for whom?
</p>
<p> In fact, A2K itself can be understood as an elite movement, depending upon 
</p>
<p>how we define knowledge and how we identify modes and approaches through 
</p>
<p>which knowledge is formulated and accessed. For example, computers and the 
</p>
<p>Internet still do not play a significant role in Sri Lanka in accessing formal knowl-
</p>
<p>edge because of the simple fact that a majority of the population do not have 
</p>
<p>access to computers, and even when computers and Internet access are available, 
</p>
<p>many find it difficult to use them productively because of the unavailability of 
</p>
<p>material in local languages and because they still find it culturally alien, even when 
</p>
<p>language is not a problem. For the majority of people who work with nature and 
</p>
<p>who access knowledge through reading newspapers, chatting with fellow villag-
</p>
<p>ers, listening to the radio, and attending various social forums, sitting in front of a 
</p>
<p>computer and accessing information in an unfamiliar language is rather a strange 
</p>
<p>and complicated exercise. The use of computers and the Internet by school teach-
</p>
<p>ers and university academics still remains low due to this, as well. Narrowing the 
</p>
<p>scope of A2K to FOSS itself can be understood as a way of rendering it the move-
</p>
<p>ment of an elite, from that point of view.
</p>
<p> The theory of A2K must be constructed on the recognition that the separa-
</p>
<p>tion between &ldquo;formal&rdquo; and &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; knowledge is a manifestation of power 
</p>
<p>relations more than anything else and that informal and traditional knowledge 
</p>
<p>still plays a significant role in the lives of everyone, and not just in Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p>Traditional knowledge in agriculture, health care, human-resource management, 
</p>
<p>virtual roundtable on a2k strategies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>574
</p>
<p>communications, water management, stress release, and so on are examples of 
</p>
<p>knowledges still in use, some significantly and some to a lesser degree.
</p>
<p> These traditional knowledges, however, are under threat for a range of reasons. 
</p>
<p>Traditional seeds provide a good example. Traditional knowledge in agriculture is 
</p>
<p>held by farmers. This knowledge is mainly saved in traditional and local seeds and 
</p>
<p>planting material passed from generation to generation between farmers. When 
</p>
<p>this transmission of seeds and planting material is threatened, access to traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge in agriculture is also threatened. That is the case today. However, it is 
</p>
<p>also important to recognize that safeguarding traditional and informal knowledge 
</p>
<p>does not imply bringing the process of disseminating traditional knowledge into 
</p>
<p>formal modes and mechanisms. Asking farmers to publish their knowledge of agri-
</p>
<p>culture so that the exceptions to intellectual property rights available for &ldquo;prior 
</p>
<p>art&rdquo; can be obtained, for example, is in fact equivalent to a proposal for remov-
</p>
<p>ing farmers from their cultural context. Otherwise, even traditional and informal 
</p>
<p>knowledge becomes an elite product. Sometimes the very process of identifying 
</p>
<p>and classifying traditional and informal knowledge can alienate it from the com-
</p>
<p>munities where it was located and accessed.

<p>Interview	with	Yann	Moulier	Boutang
</p>
<p>Ga&euml;lle Krikorian
</p>
<p>GK: Until recently, most countries, despite enforcing their own laws protecting 
</p>
<p>intellectual property, were not held to the same standards that are in force in the 
</p>
<p>wealthiest countries. Now, however, every country belonging to the World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization must adhere to WTO standards, which has led to a considerable 
</p>
<p>toughening of protective regulations in many countries. The question of how to 
</p>
<p>apply these rules is currently at issue in most developing countries, but answers 
</p>
<p>are not always evident. For intellectual property holders, the stakes are high: If the 
</p>
<p>new laws are not respected, the property they hold loses all value. Yet you have 
</p>
<p>put forward that the emergence of the notion of cognitive capitalism, the accumu-
</p>
<p>lation of immaterial assets, implies, by definition, a condemnation of the current 
</p>
<p>frameworks of intellectual property law and of the tendency to impose increasingly 
</p>
<p>restrictive protective measures. Should we then view this aggressive push to apply 
</p>
<p>extreme, increasingly drastic policies to safeguard intellectual property, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple in the context of bilateral negotiations or international relations such as the 
</p>
<p>Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, as the death throes of a dying watchdog?
</p>
<p>YMB: Yes, I believe so. This is a classic, widely observed phenomenon. The 
</p>
<p>tightening of legislation, contrary to what we might think, does not equate to a  
</p>
<p>preventive implementation by the state or the authorities of a more repressive 
</p>
<p>system than the one that preceded it. On the contrary, it is a proof of the inverse: 
</p>
<p>that there are transgressions. It is the extent of these transgressions and the chal-
</p>
<p>lenge to existing economic models that they express that explain the explosion of 
</p>
<p>enforcement measures. It was because the poor were poaching, chopping wood, 
</p>
<p>and traveling far and wide, especially according to where legislation favored 
</p>
<p>them, that the Poor Relief Act was adopted in Great Britain in 1662. Under that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>krikorian 576
</p>
<p>legislation, beneficiaries could receive the poverty allowance only if they were 
</p>
<p>registered in a county and remained there, unless in possession of a fixed-term 
</p>
<p>work contract. (It is interesting, by the way, to consider the parallels with what is 
</p>
<p>currently happening in France and elsewhere with respect to international immi-
</p>
<p>grants.) In Great Britain, the goal of the 1662 legislation was to limit the circulation 
</p>
<p>of the poor. We see the same phenomenon in the repressive laws governing slaves, 
</p>
<p>the use of tracking dogs, bounties, and physical punishment, such as the cutting of 
</p>
<p>tendons: Each of these barbarian methods expanded at a rate directly proportional 
</p>
<p>to the incidence of fugitive slaves attempting escape. In the same way, I believe, 
</p>
<p>major record labels&rsquo; excessive zeal for protecting intellectual property and the 
</p>
<p>insistence on this issue in the United States are mainly consequences of the fact 
</p>
<p>that much of this legislation cannot be applied and is constantly being violated.
</p>
<p> With any legislation, you have to consider its application. Enforcement is 
</p>
<p>expensive and requires the power to monitor, to employ lawyers, to rule on cases, 
</p>
<p>to oversee the application of verdicts, to supervise payment of fines, and so on. 
</p>
<p>This kind of framework cannot be coordinated unless there are very large sums 
</p>
<p>involved. Beyond a certain tolerated level of transgression, the major labels will 
</p>
<p>take action. As long as there were only roughly fifty thousand users per day con-
</p>
<p>necting to Napster to exchange data, copyright holders were unconcerned. When 
</p>
<p>the number rose to 36 million users a day, it was considered unacceptable&mdash;since 
</p>
<p>then, one can only guess how these exchanges have skyrocketed with the leap in 
</p>
<p>video downloading made possible by broadband.
</p>
<p> Still, we need to realize that this push to curb access is, by nature, in absolute 
</p>
<p>contradiction with the spirit and practices of cognitive capitalism. The latter cannot 
</p>
<p>develop except through intensive digital usage, which in turn opens up an extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary potential for the diffusion of content. This dynamic began first with text, 
</p>
<p>then sound, and then images. Gradually, everything becomes accessible, which 
</p>
<p>presents a significant problem for copyright holders, who then try to shore up the 
</p>
<p>walls, their legislative and technical protection systems, such as digital rights man-
</p>
<p>agement (DRM). The framework protecting intellectual property was set up before 
</p>
<p>digital content found a wide audience, when broadband was not yet available. It 
</p>
<p>was the masses&rsquo; general ingenuity, more than the &ldquo;general laboriousness&rdquo;  of which 
</p>
<p>Marx speaks, that grew with respect to technology. Because the goods in ques-
</p>
<p>tion are nonrival, that is, infinitely consumable without being exhausted, copyright 
</p>
<p>holders find themselves constructing further obstacles beyond those protecting 
</p>
<p>material goods. These obstacles in the domain of knowledge goods are fundamen-
</p>
<p>tally, absolutely artificial, whether they take the form of laws or technical tools such 
</p>
<p>as DRM. The tightening of rules is proportional to the frequency of the exchanges 
</p>
<p>taking place. Copyright holders are not raving, paranoid, or obsessed&mdash;they are </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interview with yann moulier boutang 577
</p>
<p>simply defending their interests, blow for blow. They are defensive lobbyists, simi-
</p>
<p>lar to the planters who feared the effects of contamination when a free labor force 
</p>
<p>developed. They will use any means available, even, for example, attempting to 
</p>
<p>regulate in the name of antiterrorism, to gain influence over other countries and 
</p>
<p>defend against counterattacks such as Freenet, which allows people to share files, 
</p>
<p>browse the Web, chat, and establish Web sites anonymously, or the practice of 
</p>
<p>encrypting exchanges in order to keep their contents private.
</p>
<p> What we have seen amounts to a series of desperate efforts. One may recall 
</p>
<p>the defeat on the users&rsquo; side, when Kazaa lost its case in the U.S. Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>Radio listeners started recording broadcast content, digitizing it, and then broad-
</p>
<p>casting it again without infringing copyright. Intellectual property specialists 
</p>
<p>called it &ldquo;the analog gap.&rdquo; The issue of such recordings was brought to Congress, 
</p>
<p>and certain members of Congress proposed, in all seriousness, that radio programs 
</p>
<p>should be aired with a technical tattoo to make these recordings impossible. That 
</p>
<p>restrictive project failed, because it was completely unrealistic, but this shows how 
</p>
<p>those hoping to restrict such exchanges sometimes let their imaginations run wild.

</p>
<p>systems, with security as the primary objective, led to an absolutely insane level 
</p>
<p>of compartmentalizing policies. These policies made little difference in a situa-
</p>
<p>tion that has become familiar: You can build a stronghold, but when a pirate infil-
</p>
<p>trates it, and he always does, he will be the one turning the protective systems to 
</p>
<p>his advantage, becoming invulnerable to expulsion. That is what happened with 
</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s famous Palladium project, through which the firm hoped to create an 
</p>
<p>ultratough armor for computers by constantly violating users&rsquo; privacy to verify 
</p>
<p>that applications met intellectual property regulations. In the same way, when 
</p>
<p>Sony installed spyware programs in its video games, it was in the end at great cost 
</p>
<p>to the company. It wreaked havoc on users&rsquo; computers. Many lost the contents 
</p>
<p>of their hard drives. The company was unable to uninstall the program and was 
</p>
<p>finally forced to recall the games and compensate hundreds of thousands of cus-
</p>
<p>tomers whose computers were destroyed. In the chase between cops and robbers, 
</p>
<p>the cops never get a head start. There is a delay, and their route is full of pitfalls.
</p>
<p> The only real risk is when one is dealing with very large corporations that can 
</p>
<p>collude as oligopolies or cartels. The Internet would never have become available 
</p>
<p>to everyone, and we would never have witnessed the critical shift from heavy 
</p>
<p>computers with simple terminals (like those in the Sun system, Oracle, and those 
</p>
<p>of other computer companies) to the home computer and then the laptop, if ITT-
</p>
<p>ATT had not been dismantled in 1974 into two separate firms, or, if later, IBM had 
</p>
<p>not been threatened by the prospect of a split.
</p>
<p> When the Internet was developed, Microsoft did not believe in it at first. 
</p>
<p>Netscape&rsquo;s Web browser quickly became the most widely used. In order to push 
</p>
<p>its own, decidedly inferior browser, Internet Explorer, Microsoft deliberately pro-
</p>
<p>grammed its Windows operating system, which is installed as a matter of course on 
</p>
<p>all PCs (only Macs run without it or PCs with the GNU-Linux operating system) to 
</p>
<p>make it systematically crash whenever users tried to open Netscape. This monopo-
</p>
<p>listic practice (along with the obligatory installation of Windows on personal com-
</p>
<p>puters) came before the courts in a highly publicized trial brought by Netscape and 
</p>
<p>by more than thirty of the states, including the largest ones in the country. Micro-
</p>
<p>soft was able to escape being dismantled in the United States thanks to George W. 
</p>
<p>Bush&rsquo;s election in 2000.
</p>
<p> In Europe, however, a very similar legal action against Redmont undertaken 
</p>
<p>by the European Commission ended in a conviction and a record-setting fine of 
</p>
<p>$480 million, while Microsoft&rsquo;s appeal in the European Court of Luxemburg was 
</p>
<p>rejected. I believe, therefore, that the only really dangerous enemy of consum-
</p>
<p>ers&rsquo; individual liberties in their endeavors of cooperation and the creation of new 
</p>
<p>common space for innovation is very large corporations&rsquo; ability to block access 
</p>
<p>to digital technology by imposing new enclosures, as Yochai Benkler, Philippe

</p>
<p>seek a patent for his technological advances after he helped develop the computer, 
</p>
<p>building on the pioneering work of Alan Turing, John von Neumann refused. As 
</p>
<p>president of IBM, his view was that the computer would never sell and was des-
</p>
<p>tined to be used by only a small handful of wealthy customers&mdash;himself included. 
</p>
<p>Monopoly, elitism, and Malthusianism all go hand in hand. We have seen how far 
</p>
<p>wrong his prediction proved to be.
</p>
<p>GK: While economic self-interest may explain the logic espoused by copy-
</p>
<p>right holders in wealthy countries, we see these nations also bringing their full 
</p>
<p>influence to bear on the poorest countries to force them to contribute sums that 
</p>
<p>appear colossal in view of their resources to help increase protective measures and 
</p>
<p>enforce regulations, even though the economic impact of these measures is rela-
</p>
<p>tively insignificant. What is at stake in terms of controlling knowledge and tech-
</p>
<p>nology, however, is very significant. Is this where confrontations between wealthy 
</p>
<p>and developing countries are playing out? Why would developing countries join 
</p>
<p>such an unequal game?
</p>
<p>YMB: In the history of patent legislation, it is very clear that emerging economic 
</p>
<p>powers have never respected patents during their period of development&mdash;
</p>
<p>whether we consider the United States, the Soviet Union, or China&mdash;because they 
</p>
<p>knew it would prove too costly. Poland, for example, was favorable to software 
</p>
<p>patenting, but when it joined the European Union, Poland dropped Microsoft 
</p>
<p>flat because it became clear that the cost of intellectual property rights would far 
</p>
<p>exceed the benefits to be gained from fiscal advantages or a low-cost workforce 
</p>
<p>and that small companies would be forced out.
</p>
<p> The United States made its move into cognitive capitalism early. The Americans 
</p>
<p>also have a legal culture that lends itself especially well to the culture of patents 
</p>
<p>and brands, while countries with a non&ndash;Anglo-Saxon culture are much less well 
</p>
<p>adapted to this activity. The United States is fifteen or twenty years ahead and is 
</p>
<p>trying to consolidate its lead to prevent other countries from catching up. Here we 
</p>
<p>have a classic trait of economic liberalism: turning liberal when you are at the top 
</p>
<p>of the class, in a position of hegemony, because you no longer fear competition. It 
</p>
<p>is an attempt to establish one&rsquo;s power and push one&rsquo;s advantage. The United States 
</p>
<p>put in place a legal system protecting intellectual property that, in fact, allowed the 
</p>
<p>country to protect itself from Japan, for example, which was an emerging rival. The 
</p>
<p>eight years of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s presidency and then George W. Bush&rsquo;s presidency until 
</p>
<p>2001 were characterized as the Silicon Valley years, with the boom in California. The 
</p>
<p>Americans knew that intangible goods, services, and intellectual property were

<p>not covered by the commercial negotiations begun in the 1960s, with the Kennedy 
</p>
<p>Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which led to the creation of 
</p>
<p>the WTO. And because free access was finally taking off at an international level, 
</p>
<p>the United States, very shrewdly for their interests, set in motion a legal offen-
</p>
<p>sive designed to confirm their lead over other countries. They made what Laurent 
</p>
<p>Thevenot calls &ldquo;investment in forms,&rdquo; that is, an investment in an institutional 
</p>
<p>framework that, once in place, allows one to reduce the cost of transactions. When 
</p>
<p>the Marrakesh Agreement was signed in 1994, not one country in the Global South 
</p>
<p>came out with a positive balance in terms of intellectual property. These countries 
</p>
<p>could not have simultaneously accepted free access and policies protecting intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property unless they had some  hope, in the end, of benefiting from the 
</p>
<p>system in one way or another. Instead, they were offered a Paretian balance, in 
</p>
<p>which no country can improve without the other worsening. The United States 
</p>
<p>gained more than the others while convincing its partners that they, too, would 
</p>
<p>come out winners in comparison to their situation before the agreement.
</p>
<p> Of course, not all the Southern countries were in the same circumstances. India, 
</p>
<p>for example, had already developed cutting-edge pharmaceutical, chemical, and 
</p>
<p>electronic industries. Korea had invested in patents, as had Japan before. Korea

</p>
<p>began with large-scale importation of patents and went on to produce them itself. 
</p>
<p>Korea currently produces a phenomenal number of patents, far more than France. 
</p>
<p>There are also many Southern countries with financial investments in Northern 
</p>
<p>ones&mdash;sovereign wealth funds made investments in banks with large intangible 
</p>
<p>holdings. Some countries, such as India, Thailand, and Brazil therefore stand to 
</p>
<p>profit from the system as it has been adopted, but not the majority of developing 
</p>
<p>countries, and this system leads to inequalities between Southern countries.
</p>
<p> Even in countries such as India, there are greatly varying positions with 
</p>
<p>respect to this issue. Vandana Shiva and others are adamantly opposed to increas-
</p>
<p>ing intellectual property protection measures, and they won a victory in India&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>parliament in 2004, when new intellectual property legislation, which was sup-
</p>
<p>posed to be enacted a maximum of ten years after the Marrakech Agreement of 
</p>
<p>1994, turned out to be more flexible than the United States, Europe, and Japan had 
</p>
<p>hoped. Nevertheless, the more that Indian capitalism advances (take, for example, 
</p>
<p>the steel producer Arcelor Mital, the computer industry centered in Bangalore, or 
</p>
<p>the generic-drugs industry), the less India wants to play the role of a mere sub-
</p>
<p>contractor or that of the number-two factory of the world. India is rising in the 
</p>
<p>productive circuit, investing in research and development, and producing large 
</p>
<p>numbers of engineers&mdash;English-speaking ones moreover&mdash;and founding research 
</p>
<p>centers. India&rsquo;s traditional business strength now goes hand in hand with the proj-
</p>
<p>ect of capitalizing on intellectual property.
</p>
<p>GK: These diverging perspectives and inequalities between countries play into the 
</p>
<p>hands of those working to develop and homogenize intellectual property protec-
</p>
<p>tion on an international level. But despite these deliberate efforts, it seems that 
</p>
<p>the push for access is difficult to contain, and myriad cracks are spreading and 
</p>
<p>threatening to burst open. Copyright holders&rsquo; ability to work in a partnership, 
</p>
<p>to resolve their competitive differences and join forces, allowed them to obtain 
</p>
<p>the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement&mdash;the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement. There are, however, still permanent tensions that could grow into frac-
</p>
<p>tures between these groups, benefiting those who are pursuing access to knowl-
</p>
<p>edge and information.
</p>
<p>YMB: The copyright holders were successful in obtaining TRIPS, but they lost at 
</p>
<p>Doha over the ticklish question of generic prescription medicine.1 The success of 
</p>
<p>TRIPS opened the eyes of many Southern countries, because although India had 
</p>
<p>Bangalore and managed to stay afloat, the agreement put a real stranglehold on 
</p>
<p>countries in Africa and Eastern Europe. Proponents of toughened enforcement 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property laws tried to regroup, but it&rsquo;s true that cracks had begun  
</p>
<p>to spread.
</p>

</p>
<p> The first crack appeared in the area of proprietary goods and services, under the 
</p>
<p>pressure of free and open-source alternatives. Consider IBM, for example. They had 
</p>
<p>begun making watches and calculators in the 1930s, then shifted to very large com-
</p>
<p>puters, then software, then computer tech services. In marketing those services, 
</p>
<p>IBM at first focused exclusively on offering proprietary services, based on very 
</p>
<p>large patent holdings. As IBM was aware, however, a real culture of free access was 
</p>
<p>developing, and they later changed their approach and decided to explore free solu-
</p>
<p>tions. The company invested 3 billion dollars in the free approach, calculating that 
</p>
<p>they stood to save at least 600 million themselves on nonproprietary systems. IBM&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>yearly business revenue from free services is currently 3 billion. IBM opened up a 
</p>
<p>new sector to develop this culture, which did not exist inside the company, a culture 
</p>
<p>based on cooperation, sharing, and the use of standards acceptable to everyone, 
</p>
<p>without favoring one group at another&rsquo;s expense, in contrast to proprietary sys-
</p>
<p>tems, in which the objective is imposing a standard and taking users captive.
</p>
<p> When IBM made its move to free services, the computer boom was losing 
</p>
<p>momentum. Corporations that had for years cheerfully financed everything to 
</p>
<p>do with computer technology began to cut off funding. In this context, it became 
</p>
<p>clear that the free system was eminently economical, but often also more efficient 
</p>
<p>and reliable, in part because it is easier to identify and isolate piracy in programs 
</p>
<p>with open, readable source code. This is also why Java, a free programming lan-
</p>
<p>guage, became standard, even in hybrid open-source systems. The allied forces 
</p>
<p>of major computer firms working to defend proprietary solutions disintegrated. 
</p>
<p>This is why IBM, which manages a portfolio of fifteen thousand patents that earn 
</p>
<p>the company 2 billion dollars per year, decided that its engineers and departments 
</p>
<p>needed to address its clients&rsquo; culture of free access and do everything it could not 
</p>
<p>to alienate them.
</p>
<p> At the other end of the spectrum is Microsoft, whose image has become so 
</p>
<p>repugnant to fans of free access that they have a permanent hostility to the firm, 
</p>
<p>and Microsoft cannot even get its wiki platform to work, using the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>own standards, to break into the universe of free access. Proprietary vocabulary 
</p>
<p>remains so closely associated with Microsoft that its corporate managers have 
</p>
<p>even considered trying to find the company a new name.
</p>
<p> Microsoft&rsquo;s overwhelming presence in the market goes back to Bill Gates&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>stroke of genius when he decided to grant IBM a license for his MS DOS operat-
</p>
<p>ing system in 1985&ndash;86&mdash;at a juncture when IBM was releasing its PC patents to 
</p>
<p>the public domain&mdash;on condition that the system be systematically installed on all 
</p>
<p>personal computers. This clause was and still is completely shocking and rapacious 
</p>
<p>in terms of nonbiased competition. Microsoft acquired a position of near monop-
</p>
<p>oly, no thanks to its powers of innovation. As we have seen, though, Microsoft 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>583
</p>
<p>missed the ball when the Internet arrived. Today, the company is aware that Vista 
</p>
<p>and Windows 7 are the last proprietary programs it will be able to impose on cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. In his departure speech, Bill Gates even made this explicit. The plan to 
</p>
<p>corner the market on all user applications connected to the operating system had 
</p>
<p>backfired. This was, in fact, what the company was censured for in the wake of 
</p>
<p>antimonopoly legislation: creating mandatory compatibility between the operating 
</p>
<p>system and applications. Although Microsoft slipped out of its trial in the United 
</p>
<p>States, thanks to the Bush administration, in Europe, the company was ordered 
</p>
<p>to provide parts of its operating system to users working with related software. 
</p>
<p>In other words, Microsoft failed in its bid to capture, via Windows, control of the 
</p>
<p>other user applications for music, television, video, games, and office and home 
</p>
<p>automation.
</p>
<p> The stunning success of free software in the server market foreshadowed the 
</p>
<p>decline of Microsoft&rsquo;s business model, which was unable to integrate hardware and 
</p>
<p>software into a proprietary whole with public success, as Apple did, or ride the 
</p>
<p>powerful wave of free cooperation, as IBM finally did. There is no doubt that cre-
</p>
<p>ating barriers around a strictly proprietary model contributed to a kind of inertia 
</p>
<p>that, for many hackers, reflects a similarity to the dinosaurs. This split between the 
</p>
<p>free and proprietary approaches was the first area of conflict between major pro-
</p>
<p>prietary companies.
</p>
<p> Another crack in the united front maintained by intellectual property advo-
</p>
<p>cates was thanks to Google. The directors of Google are aware of the increasingly 
</p>
<p>immaterial nature of production. They also realize knowledge goods are difficult 
</p>
<p>to sell. They have built an economic model that meshes with this free-use era. The 
</p>
<p>model works because Google offers an unbelievable range of services and access. 
</p>
<p>From this point of view, Google is a &ldquo;small-c&rdquo; communist organization, in contrast 
</p>
<p>with Microsoft, which labeled developers of free software &ldquo;communists,&rdquo; as often 
</p>
<p>happened during the McCarthy era. Google realized that interaction itself would 
</p>
<p>represent an economic resource.
</p>
<p> This is what I like to call &ldquo;pollination&rdquo; and &ldquo;coralization.&rdquo; If you offer people 
</p>
<p>free tools, human activity will seize them and begin to pollinate as bees do, but 
</p>
<p>it will produce something much greater than honey, something called &ldquo;posi-
</p>
<p>tive externalities,&rdquo; in this case, networks, which in a business economy normally 
</p>
<p>require an enormous investment, hundreds of billions of euros. The value of pol-
</p>
<p>lination if compared to the value of honey and wax product is three-hundred-fifty  
</p>
<p>times to one.  Interaction creates networks spontaneously. Peer-to-peer services 
</p>
<p>build networks, which are very valuable from an advertising point of view.
</p>
<p> Google understood the role that interaction can play. In this system, human 
</p>
<p>interaction is the raw material. Google harnesses it in a way that advertising 
</p>

</p>
<p>executives do only secondarily, by using the linguistic and communicative inven-
</p>
<p>tiveness of people who are constantly creating perspectives on society. Google 
</p>
<p>represents a huge step forward. It forced the gaps wide open and caused a crisis, 
</p>
<p>or at least an awkward predicament, for those supporting the proprietary system. 
</p>
<p>This is why I believe it is strategically sound to create an alliance with Google to 
</p>
<p>dismantle old, archaic models, even though I feel we simultaneously need to be 
</p>
<p>ready to fight it, because Google&rsquo;s goal is to make money, and the company could, 
</p>
<p>in any case, be bought out by Chinese pension funds or anyone else at any point, 
</p>
<p>which could easily lead to problems, especially around the issue of privacy, since 
</p>
<p>Google uses personal data.
</p>
<p> Google has also developed a real dynamic of social creativity within the com-
</p>
<p>pany itself. It is the only company in California that has kept the spirit of the 
</p>
<p>golden age of start-ups so alive. The company offers both innovative and well-
</p>
<p>paid working conditions, somewhat like the multinational companies of the 1950s 
</p>
<p>and 1960s that paid 35 percent more than other employers. It is an entirely dif-
</p>
<p>ferent conception of creativity being applied, where on Thursdays, for example, 
</p>
<p>employees have no obligations in terms of work. This is a fundamentally con-
</p>
<p>trasting approach to that of companies such as Microsoft, which are run through 
</p>
<p>secrecy and stress. Google understood that creativity requires special conditions to 
</p>
<p>develop and that keeping employees under constant pressure, like bees stripped of 
</p>
<p>their own honey to make them keep producing and feeding themselves, is a fruit-
</p>
<p>less approach. People who are put in an environment where they can flourish will 
</p>
<p>produce results on their own. This is why it pays to offer a guaranteed minimum 
</p>
<p>wage that provides the proper conditions for creative production, somewhat like 
</p>
<p>the grants given to researchers. Giving someone an order to create is absurd. This 
</p>
<p>kind of performative proclamation is impossible. It&rsquo;s impossible to sit people down 
</p>
<p>in front of a sheet of paper and tell them &ldquo;You shall produce,&rdquo; the way workers 
</p>
<p>used to be stood in front a lathe and told to produce. By the same token, ordering 
</p>
<p>people to cooperate is completely ineffectual. We cooperate with people we like, 
</p>
<p>with whom we share affinities. Although it is possible to coordinate by force, this 
</p>
<p>works only through a material apparatus. The new immaterial nature of production 
</p>
<p>has freed these processes from Fordist control.
</p>
<p> Traditional employers have a warped, negative view of these issues. They often 
</p>
<p>think we could live in a society characterized by abundance and information, a 
</p>
<p>society in which the state invests and certain circumscribed areas would remain 
</p>
<p>free of charge, without affecting the business sector, where it would be possible 
</p>
<p>to apply a host of intellectual property regulations and reap the benefits. They 
</p>
<p>believe there can be periods of expansion, like the dot-com boom, but that there 
</p>
<p>is always a financial stabilization afterward, bringing us back to the baseline. But 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>585
</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t happen, because there is no baseline. The new situation brings a greater 
</p>
<p>degree of freedom, in comparison with the capitalism that preceded it. Contrary 
</p>
<p>to their hopes, there cannot be a partition between material, industrial produc-
</p>
<p>tion and life. Universities are the factories of the twenty-first century, producing 
</p>
<p>codified, marketable knowledge, and in this sense, the European project to place 
</p>
<p>university funding at 3 percent is ridiculous&mdash;funding will realistically need to be 
</p>
<p>in the region of 20 percent.
</p>
<p>GK: If cognitive capitalism has ushered in certain kinds of progress that tend to call 
</p>
<p>into question traditional hierarchies such as employee/boss, worker/owner, and so 
</p>
<p>on and that may have the &ldquo;power to liberate society,&rdquo; there remains, for a major-
</p>
<p>ity of people worldwide, the problem of access to this new world. As you have 
</p>
<p>commented, intellectual capital becomes discriminatory in this context, in the dis-
</p>
<p>tribution of social divisions, and although participation in training and education 
</p>
<p>has risen around the world, for a large proportion of the population, the world of 
</p>
<p>cognitive capitalism is still out of reach. This is where we encounter the difference 
</p>
<p>between information and knowledge. Gaining access is one thing, but being able 
</p>
<p>to evolve in this period of expansion, to benefit from what is available, is another.
</p>
<p>YMB: It would be a mistake to think that cognitive capitalism is relevant only in 
</p>
<p>Northern countries. Some people say Africa isn&rsquo;t wired in, and poor populations 
</p>
<p>will never be able to connect, and that&rsquo;s not true. We have seen, for example, the 
</p>
<p>explosion of cell phone use in the favelas in Brazil. This is because, in the context, 
</p>
<p>portable phones offer an incalculable range of uses: to look for a job and be con-
</p>
<p>tactable at any point regarding job offers, to gain access to a boundless range of 
</p>
<p>things and types of information, to protect yourself by calling the police or friends 
</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s necessary, and so on. Cell phones are a network for everyone. This makes 
</p>
<p>them even more important than housing&mdash;they even take the place of fixed hous-
</p>
<p>ing for many people. We live in a physical circle of personal contacts, people we 
</p>
<p>know physically, but outside this circle is a much larger circle that also plays a 
</p>
<p>very important role. For now, the content that people exchange on cell phones is 
</p>
<p>of only relative interest&mdash;soccer scores, standardized information, and so on, but 
</p>
<p>things can change. And people are certainly going to be turning more and more to 
</p>
<p>free systems, as has happened with peer-to-peer, because the activity alone can 
</p>
<p>make these channels economically feasible.
</p>
<p> There is no question that, on the one hand, education and training have a role 
</p>
<p>to play. On the other hand, it would be wrong to think of education as an empty 
</p>
<p>bottle to fill. That&rsquo;s not how it works. Popular cultures produce values and knowl-
</p>
<p>edge. And it isn&rsquo;t true that just because people haven&rsquo;t been informed or trained, 
</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t use technology and engage with the transformations taking place.
</p>

</p>
<p> We also need to realize the networks are interconnected. Cell phone users, for 
</p>
<p>example, represent an extraordinary mix. In Africa, these phones are important 
</p>
<p>for illiterate users, people with higher education, immigrants sent back to their 
</p>
<p>own country, and so on. I do not share the views of Dominique Walton, who says 
</p>
<p>the Internet gives an illusion of democracy while in reality, users are trapped by 
</p>
<p>codified content, and the whole system simply follows the market&rsquo;s rules. The dot-
</p>
<p>com crisis in 2000 was associated with a poor understanding of the phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>The market sector thought it could take hold of the Internet, and it turned out 
</p>
<p>to be mistaken. The market won&rsquo;t sell effectively on the Internet unless it makes 
</p>
<p>effective use of interaction and offers things that the conventional market system 
</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t. The market cannot engage with this kind of interaction unless the Internet 
</p>
<p>remains open and not locked into a strictly market-oriented arena. It is interac-
</p>
<p>tion that empowers users and gives them agency. This potential cannot, of course, 
</p>
<p>be realized without looking at the political struggle for access, open source, and a 
</p>
<p>general free-of-charge culture. . . .
</p>
<p>GK: In developing countries, we find a certain elite (although, as they make up 
</p>
<p>10 percent of the population, we should perhaps stop referring to them as elite) 
</p>
<p>that has emerged and become a player in this immaterial world, but there is also a 
</p>
<p>split. Until now, the upper classes and the intellectual and cultural elites have kept 
</p>
<p>control. What is more, on a national as well as an international level, inequality is 
</p>
<p>growing. In the context of productive connections formed through cognitive capi-
</p>
<p>talism, should we worry about the possibility of a worldwide social structure based 
</p>
<p>on two main classes, one for which cognitive capital represents an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>exercise its freedom and another that is excluded from this new reality, remaining 
</p>
<p>subjugated under classic forms of domination and trapped in the sterile role of 
</p>
<p>consumer? What possibilities are there for these populations to take part in the 
</p>
<p>creative process?
</p>
<p>YMB: There is a split between the populations, but it doesn&rsquo;t divide them into 
</p>
<p>monolithic units. The split is related to culture, rather than only to economic fac-
</p>
<p>tors. In Brazil, for example, we can see how the split between those in favor of a 
</p>
<p>proprietary approach and those opposing it becomes a new determinant of class 
</p>
<p>distinction without following the contours of people&rsquo;s social attachments. It actu-
</p>
<p>ally cuts across the closed class system and divides it on different lines. Access to 
</p>
<p>digital content reorganizes things. We also need to recognize that the masses, such 
</p>
<p>as poor favela dwellers, represent a valuable resource for cultural capitalism. In 
</p>
<p>Rio, the carnival is the means to exploit the creative resource of the favelas, serv-
</p>
<p>ing to boost tourism, which has become the city&rsquo;s main industry.
</p>
<p> Of course, managing to harness this rich resource  is one means of functioning 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>587
</p>
<p>in modernity, but harnessing people in this way is also a way of co-opting them as 
</p>
<p>partisans of the proprietary system. This brings us to a basic question of access and 
</p>
<p>the free-of-charge system. If we simply demand piracy, making everything free, 
</p>
<p>without addressing the question of intellectual property except as a limit to be 
</p>
<p>transgressed, it leaves the creator out of the equation. How will Native Americans 
</p>
<p>or Aborigines be repaid or compensated when multinational corporations plunder 
</p>
<p>their intellectual resources at the same time that these same corporations make 
</p>
<p>vehement claims about the importance of respecting intellectual property when 
</p>
<p>they are the owners in question?
</p>
<p> The debate on open source and copyleft versus the Creative Commons is very 
</p>
<p>important and is helpful in thinking about this question. There are real differences 
</p>
<p>between these choices. On the one hand, you have Richard Stallman, a computer 
</p>
<p>scientist, who doesn&rsquo;t understand that although in collaborative programs, it is 
</p>
<p>more effective not to protect them from interventions by others, the same does 
</p>
<p>not apply to writing a text. Mallarm&eacute; would be categorically opposed to having his 
</p>
<p>texts modified, and we can understand why. Similarly, in the context of a collec-
</p>
<p>tive text or a manifesto, for example, although it is drawn up collectively, we also 
</p>
<p>understand that the text cannot be changed unilaterally, even by those who sup-
</p>
<p>port it. Nobody would let right-wing extremists alter a manifesto for the Socialist 
</p>
<p>Party, and vice versa. There must be a closure clause to protect the integrity of the 
</p>
<p>project. On the other hand, proponents of the Creative Commons, with whom I 
</p>
<p>identify myself, are opposed to a certain kind of diabolical, paradoxical pact. We 
</p>
<p>are against the alliance between the most sophisticated forms of capitalism, based 
</p>
<p>on rights of ownership, and a position we might call &ldquo;terra nullius,&rdquo; which says 
</p>
<p>that anything not codified as property is public domain and can be used&mdash;in other 
</p>
<p>words, that positive externalities can be harnessed. Corporations are very skilled 
</p>
<p>at this. The real question is how we can reencode what is in the public domain 
</p>
<p>while also protecting its authors.
</p>
<p> In the current system in France, authors&rsquo; rights are recognized only on an indi-
</p>
<p>vidual basis. In music, cinema, theater, and so on, a huge proportion of those con-
</p>
<p>tributing to the production and creation of a work of art are not considered its 
</p>
<p>authors, but are seen as technicians. Furthermore, the cost structure represents 
</p>
<p>the bulk of distribution costs. In publishing, we find the following breakdown: The 
</p>
<p>distribution network takes 60 to 70 percent of the product&rsquo;s final value, and once 
</p>
<p>the bookstores have deducted their fees, that leaves around 10 percent to be split 
</p>
<p>between the publisher and the author. The distribution mechanism of member-
</p>
<p>ship contributions works in such a way that small sums, which should go to the 
</p>
<p>authors, in fact end up in a shared account and eventually benefit only those who 
</p>
<p>make the largest contributions. Only 10 percent of authors can currently make a 
</p>
<p>interview with yann moulier boutang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>588
</p>
<p>living from writing, but they can do it because those who make 10, 20 or even let&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>say 50 percent of their living are contributors to their product. In this way, lower-
</p>
<p>profile authors, as well as those who contribute to a work&rsquo;s production without 
</p>
<p>being considered authors, have little to gain from the current system and often 
</p>
<p>have to endure unstable positions. Digitizing a product can lead to lower revenue, 
</p>
<p>because of copying, which then leads to a crisis in this economic model. The ones 
</p>
<p>who suffer the most are people already struggling to make a living.
</p>
<p> If we look at the alliance against copying in the cinema world, it is composed, 
</p>
<p>unsurprisingly, of the major SACEM (Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Auteurs, Compositeurs, et Edit-
</p>
<p>eurs de Musique) authors, but also technicians. The groups taking action against 
</p>
<p>copying are, in part, those profiting from the established system, but also many 
</p>
<p>others struggling to survive who know the economic model is outdated, that copy-
</p>
<p>ing affects financial returns and consequently the investment in production on 
</p>
<p>which their salaries depend. Accordingly they view the expansion of digital con-
</p>
<p>tent as a threat. If sales are affected by digital content, then producers become 
</p>
<p>anxious and try to limit costs, which affects technicians first, destabilizes produc-
</p>
<p>tion teams, and so on. This is why we must tackle the issue of authors&rsquo; rights and 
</p>
<p>find a new form of insurance by changing the cost structure, which we can do 
</p>
<p>through increased dematerialization.
</p>
<p> There are still vast numbers of elements that could be dematerialized. If this 
</p>
<p>lowers costs, then, first of all, prices will drop, making the results more afford-
</p>
<p>able, but it will also be possible to shift the dividing lines, and we will then be able 
</p>
<p>to change current relationships of power. We could consider the possibility of a 
</p>
<p>model in which, through digital channels, products become public and accessible 
</p>
<p>while production, authors, and technical teams would be subsidized. This is how 
</p>
<p>the Opera is currently run in France. When you buy a ticket for 20, 50 or even 200 
</p>
<p>euros, the actual cost is around 1000 euros. The opera is subsidized, along with the 
</p>
<p>press and free access. While in the current system, distribution channels take the 
</p>
<p>lion&rsquo;s share of funding to cover costs, materials, energy and transport, we could 
</p>
<p>conceivably push digitization further along, so that instead of a CD or a DVD, for 
</p>
<p>example, you would use an intangible product (a digital file) that can be distrib-
</p>
<p>uted at very low cost. Of course, there would still be distribution expenses, such 
</p>
<p>as the cost of network administration, but instead of making up 70 percent of the 
</p>
<p>price, they would represent 10, 15 or 20 percent. A large part of the price would in 
</p>
<p>this way be made available simply to pay those with artist roles, but also techni-
</p>
<p>cians and other jobs associated with the creative process.
</p>
<p> The objective is to incorporate free access into economic models, develop chan-
</p>
<p>nels, find finance circuits that use interaction as a resource, and change the legal 
</p>
<p>structure. The point is to move from an extremely primitive copyright system 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>589
</p>
<p>based on elementary, binary notions that says you either have the right to do any-
</p>
<p>thing or no rights at all&mdash;the root of copyright is prohibiting copies&mdash;to a system 
</p>
<p>where the author and the producer exist, where each one&rsquo;s contribution is recog-
</p>
<p>nized and, by extension, brings in a living wage, and where what counts is the way 
</p>
<p>a product is used.
</p>
<p> This brings us to the importance of usus in relation to fructus and abusus&mdash;in 
</p>
<p>other words, it brings us back to property laws. Depending on the situation, it is 
</p>
<p>possible to make the public pay, give it something free of charge, or strike a bal-
</p>
<p>ance between the two extremes. In the system I am describing, the public gains 
</p>
<p>access to products, so in this model, it is the public that trains itself, providing its 
</p>
<p>own references about a product. The public is constantly tagging the product. I 
</p>
<p>always thought that if Paul-Loup Sulitzer&rsquo;s books weren&rsquo;t wrapped in cellophane, 
</p>
<p>if they were on-line, there would be a spontaneous backlash, and nobody would 
</p>
<p>want to read this literature, which is of no interest to any part of the public.2
</p>
<p> The other side of this dynamic is that a good product finds its own audience, 
</p>
<p>which expands and differs according to taste and use and according to people&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>ability to pay. As an academic, for example, I cannot afford an access fee of 150 
</p>
<p>euros for journals and am happy to read what is available on-line. If I read an 
</p>
<p>interesting book, I&rsquo;ll recommend it to the university library and to students. 
</p>
<p>It is clear that putting media on-line does not take away buyer demand. By the 
</p>
<p>same token, it is absurd to view downloads as just so many products not being 
</p>
<p>purchased, especially since people in a position to buy are revealed through the 
</p>
<p>actions of those who aren&rsquo;t and who use downloads instead, because the latter 
</p>
<p>become like consultants. When kids download something and show it to their par-
</p>
<p>ents and friends, customers with spending money are directed toward the product. 
</p>
<p>This is the economic model we should be defending. It is not about destroying all 
</p>
<p>definitions of property, but about removing the effects of closure. The current sys-
</p>
<p>tem is presented as being constructed to encourage inventors and producers, when 
</p>
<p>in fact it tends to breed parasitic chains. We must therefore work to enact much 
</p>
<p>more sophisticated legislation that makes it possible actually to support people 
</p>
<p>who are inventing and creating while taking account of people&rsquo;s income and not 
</p>
<p>creating obstacles to access.
</p>
<p> People need to consider what type of intellectual property protection will ben-
</p>
<p>efit them most. The patent system favors large corporations, because patent regis-
</p>
<p>tration is something small start-ups cannot afford. There have also been more and 
</p>
<p>more problems associated with applying patent protection. There is no worldwide 
</p>
<p>patent authority, and the United States issues a staggering number of patents, 
</p>
<p>many of which are questionable and rightly called into question. Some Brazilian 
</p>
<p>manufacturers were telling me recently that the tangle of patent administration 
</p>
<p>interview with yann moulier boutang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>590
</p>
<p>is becoming an increasingly powerful deterrent to people interested in doing 
</p>
<p>research. This explains why the science community is often particularly cool, if not 
</p>
<p>hostile, when it comes to patents. The author&rsquo;s rights&ndash;royalties system, as used by 
</p>
<p>songwriters, for example, is more favorable to small parties, but difficult to apply: 
</p>
<p>It requires frameworks for listening, attribution, allocation, and so on. If we take 
</p>
<p>the example of a flat fee for downloads that has been discussed, it is clear that the 
</p>
<p>task of attributing and reattributing royalties will not be easy.
</p>
<p> However, there is also a growing interest in brand names, which are much more 
</p>
<p>manageable and affordable for small companies, because their capital and main-
</p>
<p>tenance costs are much lower, which also explains why brand laws tend to be put 
</p>
<p>in place more quickly than other types of intellectual property laws in develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries. Furthermore, brands seem to present us with an interesting model 
</p>
<p>in terms of protecting goods based on traditional knowledge and other collective 
</p>
<p>rights. Generally speaking, the advertising model offers many important advan-
</p>
<p>tages. It allows one to publicize and recognize authorship and thus facilitates attri-
</p>
<p>bution. Publicizing someone&rsquo;s work is not payment in itself, but it does bring pro-
</p>
<p>fessional recognition and help the author to build and promote her career. It is a 
</p>
<p>symbolic wage. On some level, it becomes a form of brand. I believe we should not 
</p>
<p>be fighting the notion of attribution, or the project to codify usage, or the system 
</p>
<p>of economic compensation.
</p>
<p>GK: It is in the nature of intangible goods and their means of production to favor 
</p>
<p>certain kinds of collective action&mdash;sharing, exchange, collaboration, and the pro-
</p>
<p>duction of collective intelligence. Would you say that the A2K movement, which 
</p>
<p>has gained momentum thanks to the arrival of cognitive capitalism, will be able 
</p>
<p>to defeat the movement for increased intellectual property restrictions by simply 
</p>
<p>continuing to push forward in the same direction that it has heretofore followed? 
</p>
<p>In this sense, piracy might be one of the first steps to take, because it allows peo-
</p>
<p>ple to participate in free expansion and also because it would represent a form of 
</p>
<p>direct resistance against control and repression that we would be better off break-
</p>
<p>ing through immediately, before it has a chance to solidify.
</p>
<p>YMB: The problem with piracy is that it can function like the drug dealers&rsquo; tech-
</p>
<p>nique of distributing free samples of the product, then cruelly cutting off access in 
</p>
<p>order then to sell it to users who have become addicts. Microsoft uses this method. 
</p>
<p>The company knows it is unable to force licenses on the entire market in China, 
</p>
<p>even if it can in Shanghai, on the coast. It isn&rsquo;t possible in the rest of the coun-
</p>
<p>try. The important thing is for the standard to become indispensable. So Microsoft 
</p>
<p>allows piracy to take place, which helps its products become the default choice. 
</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s wager is that when people have money to spend, they will go buy 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>591
</p>
<p>the original products and stop using pirated ones, becoming customers. The effect 
</p>
<p>of piracy in this case actually hinders the development of free access.
</p>
<p> From a certain perspective, piracy is the tribute vice pays to virtue. Some acts 
</p>
<p>of piracy, namely, viruses and bugs, are deliberately developed by businesses to 
</p>
<p>stimulate customer use of help hotlines&mdash;there is proof that they do this. The aura 
</p>
<p>surrounding piracy also serves to legitimize the system. It&rsquo;s like the story of Par-
</p>
<p>mentier: To allay people&rsquo;s anxiety about potatoes, he had to put up a fence around 
</p>
<p>the potato patch, which stimulated interest and desire.
</p>
<p> If we take counterfeiting, the business revenue for Swiss watches comes to 5 
</p>
<p>billion per year, perfume is 5 billion, and luxury industries the same. These three 
</p>
<p>industries are favorite targets of counterfeiting. There is, furthermore, an unbe-
</p>
<p>lievably wide range of calibers of counterfeit watches, costing from a few hundred 
</p>
<p>to several tens of thousands of euros. The people who buy copies can&rsquo;t afford to 
</p>
<p>buy real ones, but by buying copies, they are contributing to the image, providing 
</p>
<p>advertising for the brand. Buyers start out with crude counterfeits and progress to 
</p>
<p>closer and closer approximations of the real thing, until they can actually afford 
</p>
<p>it. In China, certain counterfeit retailers offer four or five levels of quality, ranging 
</p>
<p>from very crude copies to undetectable ones. Studies of customs seizures show 
</p>
<p>that wherever counterfeiting spreads, not only does it fail to harm the market for 
</p>
<p>branded products, it in fact boosts the market. The two complement each other, 
</p>
<p>rather than substituting for one another. Counterfeiting stimulates a demand, 
</p>
<p>which turns into a social norm, especially among people with money to spend. It 
</p>
<p>is the same economic model at work in peer-to-peer networks. Piracy, therefore, 
</p>
<p>has a positive effect on sales. It is for this reason that promoters of free access 
</p>
<p>often criticize piracy as being the cause of consolidation of proprietary standards. 
</p>
<p>Some economists view piracy, in terms of a rather sophisticated model, as a form of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;free&rdquo; goods that creates a space for valorization. Having done this, piracy creates 
</p>
<p>a market based on the coralization produced by this particular type of consumer.
</p>
<p> Certain people use piracy because they don&rsquo;t want to pay for something, oth-
</p>
<p>ers out of necessity, others out of defiance, and others do so even while mak-
</p>
<p>ing a public issue of defending intellectual property, because people aren&rsquo;t always 
</p>
<p>consistent in their behavior. So piracy brings together people with widely varying 
</p>
<p>motivations. They have different reasons for using piracy to gain access to knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, but we need to make the consequences clear to them, to explain the advan-
</p>
<p>tages of alternative, nonproprietary systems.
</p>
<p> We also need to make sure all computers have free programs installed on 
</p>
<p>them so that people can choose freely. Logically, along with demanding access 
</p>
<p>to knowledge with as few obstacles as possible, we should also be promoting the 
</p>
<p>development of basic computer know-how, which will be a sort of modern civic 
</p>

</p>
<p>education and allow every computer user to get into the operating system and see 
</p>
<p>it functioning, see its limits and barriers, and so on. Until now, only &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;crackers&rdquo; had these kinds of skills.
</p>
<p>GK: There is a very diverse set of figures behind the movement supporting access 
</p>
<p>to knowledge, people who don&rsquo;t always agree about aims or what kind of philoso-
</p>
<p>phy to put forward, but who come together to lead an offensive. With a wide range 
</p>
<p>of motivations, they manage to join forces in collective action, which gives them 
</p>
<p>a certain power. How do you view this multitude, and what would you say are the 
</p>
<p>alliances and demands likely to emerge from the issues they share in this context? 
</p>
<p>In the fight to abolish slavery, the ultimate goal could be articulated clearly and 
</p>
<p>simply. In the case of A2K, how is the movement taking shape, and how can the 
</p>
<p>goal be articulated? What seems desirable?
</p>
<p>YMB: I think people agree that it is time to condemn the arbitrary reign of cor-
</p>
<p>porate power. The antimonopoly effort is one of their motivations. The demands 
</p>
<p>made, however, are more diverse in nature. Some people are in favor of the prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of free access and believe that the domain of learning ought to be subsidized 
</p>
<p>and not represent another space occupied by merchandizing, for making profits. 
</p>
<p>Another category of people is concerned about the decline and contamination of a 
</p>
<p>public sector as a result of market norms and would like to protect this public sec-
</p>
<p>tor while reigning in market expansion, which is a more sophisticated position. A 
</p>
<p>third type of position claims that the system of barriers protecting property is ill-
</p>
<p>suited to the domain of knowledge and represents an impediment to innovation. 
</p>
<p>There is yet another category that takes a more technical perspective and raises 
</p>
<p>the issue of the standards battle&mdash;which in 1999 led to Tim O&rsquo;Reilly from Open 
</p>
<p>Access splitting with the Free Software Foundation&rsquo;s policies. They are convinced 
</p>
<p>that the fundamental issue in the industrial sector, as well as in the public sector, 
</p>
<p>is the choice of norms, which are used by companies to try to escape the effects  
</p>
<p>of competition.
</p>
<p> Finally, there is another view, which is roughly the one I myself hold, that says 
</p>
<p>the real issue consists in finding economic models that effect a compromise involv-
</p>
<p>ing cognitive capitalism, and a viable system for the public sector and traditional 
</p>
<p>learning, and the radical democratization of society&mdash;these are the three elements 
</p>
<p>to be brought together. This means it is vital to integrate some parts of capital-
</p>
<p>ism, the most interesting ones, because it opens up arenas that the greatest pos-
</p>
<p>sible number of citizens, researchers, students, and customers can use. The battle 
</p>
<p>certainly isn&rsquo;t over yet. We have already seen it in the case of slavery: Almost a 
</p>
<p>century went by between the first revolt and abolition of slavery, in 1804, and the 
</p>
<p>start of its absolute abolition, in Brazil in 1889. It is in any case unsurprising that 
</p>
<p>krikorian </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>593
</p>
<p>certain parties in the so-called &ldquo;real,&rdquo; material economy are opposed to a radical 
</p>
<p>evolution. In some cases, it might be people drawing pensions, but it could also be 
</p>
<p>employees working to produce tangible goods who turn reactionary in the hopes 
</p>
<p>of protecting their jobs, which are more important to them than society becoming 
</p>
<p>authoritarian and noncreative.
</p>
<p> In addition, there are complex alliances at odds with each other. We see this 
</p>
<p>with the issue of traditional knowledge. In the lawsuit over the Amazonian Ror-
</p>
<p>aima Reserve in Brazil, for example, which the Supreme Court decided in favor 
</p>
<p>of the defenders of the reserve, there were landless groups, wealthy settlers who 
</p>
<p>wanted to grow soy, the army, prospectors working for the Brazilian national cor-
</p>
<p>poration Petrobras, wood manufacturers, and ecologists. Their motivations were 
</p>
<p>all interlinked. Native Americans, like the Aborigines in Australia who fought 
</p>
<p>against multinational corporations, actually made a tacit, technical use of prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights by demanding a sort of author&rsquo;s right to resources in the reserve when 
</p>
<p>multinationals refused to recognize the relevance of authorship&mdash;often, in this 
</p>
<p>case, taking the form of collective author&rsquo;s rights. The Brazilian state and army 
</p>
<p>had recognized the Native Americans&rsquo; right to a usufruct, but not to the trans-
</p>
<p>ferability of property, which means, in other words, that they maintained sover-
</p>
<p>eignty. There was a deep-rooted conflict between those who accepted the Native 
</p>
<p>Americans&rsquo; sovereignty and right to oppose the state on issues such as petroleum 
</p>
<p>development and those who denied it. In this conflict, the army pointed to the 
</p>
<p>necessity of national security, and the settlers and landless groups took the same 
</p>
<p>line, while on the other side, an alliance between proponents of Native Americans 
</p>
<p>sovereignty on Amazonian soil and ecologists who wanted to limit the clearing of 
</p>
<p>forest for farmland was endorsed by the local, but not the federal government. 
</p>
<p>Native Americans believe the forest cannot be touched because trees have souls, a 
</p>
<p>belief that they expressed tactically in the language of property because it was the 
</p>
<p>only means of making their message understandable. In the same way, Stallman 
</p>
<p>called for interoperability and nonclosure of systems in bourgeois law by creating 
</p>
<p>the idea of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo; while preventing the ransacking of public space that was 
</p>
<p>attempting to consolidate private property.
</p>
<p> In a political battle, there is unavoidably some mixing of alliances between 
</p>
<p>people with different objectives. There are two parts that make up access to learn-
</p>
<p>ing, for example. There is access considered as an absolute, timeless virtue, and 
</p>
<p>then there is a more historically determined position, which is therefore more stra-
</p>
<p>tegic and raises the issue of rearranging the power structure. The idea of knowl-
</p>
<p>edge communism could represent the locus of this reorganization, the field where 
</p>
<p>all the different groups can reach an agreement. People don&rsquo;t refer to it as &ldquo;com-
</p>
<p>munism,&rdquo; but say &ldquo;for common use,&rdquo; &ldquo;new common ground,&rdquo; &ldquo;common space.&rdquo; The 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>term &ldquo;communism&rdquo; is, in fact, derived from &ldquo;commoners,&rdquo; and we must not forget 
</p>
<p>that in revolutionary history, it was the commoners who started things, not the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;communists.&rdquo; I use the notion of the communism of capital because I think capi-
</p>
<p>talism needs to be brought into common use by the commoners, since they are the 
</p>
<p>ones producing it and generating its income. Free access to learning can provide 
</p>
<p>the impetus for a political representation of society, the development of a coopera-
</p>
<p>tive society in which exploitation is significantly reduced and gradually eliminated 
</p>
<p>as innovative forms of work and creation emerge.

<p>It was with a single experimental film that the phenomenon we now know as 
</p>
<p>Nolly wood came into being. Kenneth Nnebue&rsquo;s 1992 production, Living in Bond-
</p>
<p>age, wasn&rsquo;t very expensive to make and didn&rsquo;t take long to film. For this, his first 
</p>
<p>Igbo-language venture, he played it safe and culled the depths of local ritual lore 
</p>
<p>to form a basis for the plot:
</p>
<p>Andy learned it the hard way&mdash;selling your soul to the devil stinks. He didn&rsquo;t mean 
</p>
<p>for his wife to be killed in a satanic sacrifice. He just wanted to live the high life&mdash;
</p>
<p>get a girlfriend, a nice house, and a car (or two&mdash;a Mercedes and a Pathfinder). But 
</p>
<p>the high priest was insistent, and Andy was in over his head, and well, though her 
</p>
<p>blood tasted terrible, things did really start looking up after Merit died. Fast women, 
</p>
<p>fancy cars, foreign wines, and all the chicken he could eat: if Merit&rsquo;s ghost would 
</p>
<p>just stop haunting him, everything would be fine.1
</p>
<p> Sixteen years and thousands of films later, Nollywood is everywhere. The 
</p>
<p>movement that began almost hesitatingly has catapulted itself into one of the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s significant film factories. (In 2005, Nigeria produced 872 films&mdash;in compari-
</p>
<p>son with 1091 in India and 485 in the United States.2) It is certainly the most prolific 
</p>
<p>and prolifically studied national film industry on the continent of Africa.
</p>
<p> Among Nollywood&rsquo;s most ardent observers are researchers of culture and </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>intellectual property. Culturally speaking, the content of the films may be the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of heated discussion, but one thing is clear: Nollywood has captivated all kinds 
</p>
<p>of audiences. Indeed, cinema is now Nigeria&rsquo;s primary cultural export. Nigerian 
</p>
<p>films can be watched on satellite television in almost every country in Africa, plus 
</p>
<p>a few in Europe and the West Indies. VCDs and DVDs of the most popular films&mdash;
</p>
<p>such as Kingsley Ogoro&rsquo;s 2003 production, Osuofia in London, the country&rsquo;s highest-
</p>
<p>grossing film of all time&mdash;can be found everywhere from Johannesburg to London.
</p>
<p> Odia Ofeimun, the writer and poet, provided a bracing account of the culture of 
</p>
<p>Nollywood at the Nigerian National Film Festival in 2003:
</p>
<p>Rather than wait on the imports from Hollywood which speak to our common 
</p>
<p>humanity by denying or simply being indifferent to whatever we could call our 
</p>
<p>own, the home-video woke up something that was once there but had been stamped 
</p>
<p>underfoot by managers of the national and sub-regional cultural economy. Not to 
</p>
<p>forget, this was happening while swindlers in the political marketplace were emplac-
</p>
<p>ing homegrown democracy with one hand and displacing it with the other. The video 
</p>
<p>arrived in the most homegrown attire that it could weave for itself in a country 
</p>
<p>where the search for foreign exchange had become the defining factor in national 
</p>
<p>dream-making. It turned its back on the dollar trail and reached out for the Naira 
</p>
<p>without hesitation. Rather than the dollar-mania that had overtaken all comers, it 
</p>
<p>sought an import-substitution aesthetic which insisted on building a comparative 
</p>
<p>advantage not as a subaltern of the imported Hollywood stuff but its avid displacer.3

<p>nollywood: how it works 597
</p>
<p> It is the complex, challenging, and often unique process of these films&rsquo; produc-
</p>
<p>tion and distribution, however, that has left a host of observers wondering just 
</p>
<p>how it is done. This interest is not solely academic, for Nigeria has accomplished 
</p>
<p>a feat that many Western countries with far greater capital resources have tried&mdash;
</p>
<p>and failed&mdash;to do. As the producer Zeb Ejiro puts it: &ldquo;You know, once upon a time 
</p>
<p>the French government supported arty films in Francophone countries. But now 
</p>
<p>the French Cultural Centre here in Nigeria wants to bring French moviemakers 
</p>
<p>here to study our methods. They cannot understand how we can make a movie in 
</p>
<p>seven days&mdash;and still enjoy lunchtime.&rdquo;4
</p>
<p> Charles Igwe is the principal consultant at Big Picture, a film production and 
</p>
<p>services company in Lagos. He has worked in the film industry as an execu-
</p>
<p>tive producer, financier, and lobbyist. Prior to his present career, he worked at 
</p>
<p>Citibank. He is a cofounder of the Nigerian film and television expo BOBTV (Best 
</p>
<p>of the Best TV), which showcases and markets Nigerian cinema to the world. He 
</p>
<p>was a panelist at the Yale Law School A2K3 meeting in Geneva in 2008.
</p>
<p> &ldquo;The A2K movement,&rdquo; Igwe told me before we began the conversation recorded 
</p>
<p>here, &ldquo;is even more important to developing countries at a time when knowledge 
</p>
<p>is becoming the prime currency in global affairs. The right to access knowledge 
</p>
<p>is a stronger argument in certain fields of endeavor than others. It seems to me 
</p>
<p>therefore that a modular approach should be taken in these deliberations to distill 
</p>
<p>a graded pattern for exploiting and protecting intellectual property material.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>AP: Charles, I&rsquo;d like to begin by asking how it was that Nollywood came to be. Was 
</p>
<p>there a particular event that catalyzed this industry? Or was there a policy that 
</p>
<p>resulted in this particular outcome?
</p>
<p>CI: Historically, Nigerian television always had a slot for local content. In the 1980s, 
</p>
<p>in the midst of a major cash crunch, state television was asked to seek funding 
</p>
<p>from sources other than the state. This resulted in cost cutting and a narrow rev-
</p>
<p>enue focus, which in turn resulted in shutting out original local content. The policy 
</p>
<p>shift occurred in 1985 and was consolidated by 1990. At around the same time, there 
</p>
<p>were some smart local entrepreneurs who spotted this shift and saw it as a market 
</p>
<p>gap. So they took exactly the format of local entertainment that people had been 
</p>
<p>used to, exactly those television actors who people already knew, and started pro-
</p>
<p>ducing their own films on VHS. That is how this new&mdash;and revived&mdash;industry now 
</p>
<p>known to the world as Nollywood began.
</p>
<p>AP: I&rsquo;d like to understand what the revenue pie looks like from the point of view 
</p>
<p>of a Nigerian film producer. For instance, how is revenue split between DVD sales 
</p>
<p>within Nigeria, DVD sales outside (from Africa, and beyond), and television rights?</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>598
</p>
<p>CI: I would say that the bulk of the money&mdash;far greater than 50 percent&mdash;
</p>
<p>would come from VCD and DVD sales within Nigeria. Recently, we discussed a 
</p>
<p>national distribution framework for audiovisual content that seeks to define who 
</p>
<p>should deal in such products and whether and how such business is to be done, 
</p>
<p>with a view to ensuring that the value chain is more like in other parts of the 
</p>
<p>world . . . because here, it&rsquo;s a little different from everywhere else. People who have 
</p>
<p>dominated the retail business in film so far are people who were originally trad-
</p>
<p>ing in electronic appliances, televisions, VCRs, VCD players, and so on. Up until 
</p>
<p>recently, they remained the main channel for reaching the public. DVD and VCD 
</p>
<p>sales outside of Nigeria are fragmented, and it is hard to say how much revenue 
</p>
<p>they bring in, since most of what is sold outside is pirated.
</p>
<p> The cinema theatre business was disrupted in the 1970s when most foreign 
</p>
<p>operations in Nigeria were nationalized. Cinema theatres have not recovered since. 
</p>
<p>Now, however, this distribution window is enjoying a revival, and some local media 
</p>
<p>groups (working in tandem with major American studios) are driving investment 
</p>
<p>into the infrastructure for cinema theatres. However, it is evident that these devel-
</p>
<p>opments will primarily distribute productions of the self-same American studios.
</p>
<p> In the future, I think we are going to see a lot more cinema made on digital 
</p>
<p>video, which will mean greater control on our part as to how we deliver this cin-
</p>
<p>ema to the viewer.
</p>
<p>AP: How does the distribution of film actually work? Is it similar to the distri-
</p>
<p>bution of any other commodity, where retail returns are based on the number of 
</p>
<p>units sold? Or is it that in some cases, you sell to retail middlemen&mdash;intermediar-
</p>
<p>ies&mdash;who (in exchange for an upfront fee) might be allowed to make their own 
</p>
<p>copies for sale within a territory?
</p>
<p>CI: Both models work here. The latter model&mdash;with retail intermediaries&mdash;tends 
</p>
<p>to be a lot more secure, because what happens is that the people who actually 
</p>
<p>sell these films are often the producers themselves. After spending money to pro-
</p>
<p>duce a film, they tend to be more willing to make immediate deals that will bring 
</p>
<p>immediate revenue for them. So they try to arrange a sale of reproduction rights to 
</p>
<p>someone who has the capacity to make copies and distribute.
</p>
<p>AP: In India, which is where I am from, cinema distribution tends to happen along 
</p>
<p>territory lines, and national theatre chains have only recently entered the fray. 
</p>
<p>This would mean, typically, that there are several intermediaries to whom one 
</p>
<p>would sell a film. How does it work in Nigeria?
</p>
<p>CI: The exercise of mapping territories is what we are trying to put in place now. 
</p>
<p>Up until recently, it was ad hoc: People sold films to others, who more or less sold 
</p>
<p>them on at their will. What has been put in place now is a system of licenses: We 
</p>
<p>prabhala</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>599
</p>
<p>have national distribution licenses, regional distribution licenses, and others. It&rsquo;s a 
</p>
<p>framework with a structure within which producers can decide where they want 
</p>
<p>their films to be seen or bought, and that defines who they would talk to.
</p>
<p>AP: In terms of television rights, do you negotiate these sales when the film is 
</p>
<p>being made? Or has it been your experience that television channels wait to gauge 
</p>
<p>the popularity of a film before deciding to acquire it? A related question I have is, 
</p>
<p>which are the channels you regularly speak to? I&rsquo;m aware of the MultiChoice plat-
</p>
<p>form within southern Africa. What others are there?
</p>
<p>CI: Well, up until recently, as I explained, television stations within Nigeria were 
</p>
<p>not exactly enthusiastic about Nigerian cinema. In 2005, MultiChoice created a 
</p>
<p>channel exclusively devoted to the cinema of the region&mdash;they called it Africa 
</p>
<p>Magic. It proved to be enormously popular all over the continent and even in 
</p>
<p>Nigeria. In the wake of that, our local television channels realized that local cinema 
</p>
<p>resonates strongly with the audience. Now there is a lot of demand for our cin-
</p>
<p>ema, and as a result, there is a lot more conversation between television channels 
</p>
<p>in Nigeria and movie producers there. Today, there are several television channels 
</p>
<p>showing Nollywood, many more than just MultiChoice. We are carried on a chan-
</p>
<p>nel distributed by Sky TV in the UK, on several channels in the Caribbean, and 
</p>
<p>practically everywhere in eastern Africa.
</p>
<p>AP: What would you say is the revenue share that a producer can expect to earn 
</p>
<p>from television?
</p>
<p>CI: I would say that, in the current time, it is between 5 and 20 percent&mdash;because 
</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much interest being shown by television channels now. But prior to recent 
</p>
<p>times, I would say that it was negligible. Television channels had small budgets and 
</p>
<p>could not really devote their attention to our content. A lot of players in the televi-
</p>
<p>sion market expected the content to just come to them&mdash;they had designed their 
</p>
<p>businesses based on merely providing broadcast space for selling airtime.
</p>
<p>AP: I&rsquo;d like to talk about piracy and relate my question to what I have seen and 
</p>
<p>heard from Mumbai, India&rsquo;s Hindi film capital. In India, we regularly hear produc-
</p>
<p>ers bemoaning piracy&mdash;as perhaps is the case everywhere else in the world. We 
</p>
<p>also hear, however, of individual producers, directors, and actors who acknowl-
</p>
<p>edge the inadvertent (and enormous) publicity and outreach that piracy provides. 
</p>
<p>So the reaction to piracy tends to be mixed. The other interesting thing about 
</p>
<p>piracy here is that often, actors themselves earn more money from endorsements 
</p>
<p>and theatrical shows than from the films they act in. This means that to an extent, 
</p>
<p>piracy results in building their reputation more significantly than legal sales of the 
</p>
<p>film would accomplish.

</p>
<p> Turning to Nigeria, Brian Larkin writes that &ldquo;looking at piracy and the wider 
</p>
<p>infrastructure of reproduction it is part of reveals its generative side; piracy is part 
</p>
<p>of the migration of the parallel economy in Nigeria into center stage, mixing legal 
</p>
<p>and illegal regimes, uniting social actors, organizing common networks.&rdquo;5 What do 
</p>
<p>you think of piracy in the context of the Nigerian film industry?
</p>
<p>CI: Look, when we started making films in Nigeria, it wasn&rsquo;t like we had some 
</p>
<p>big business plan or big budgets to drive our products. But somehow, the prod-
</p>
<p>uct caught on anyway&mdash;first within the country, then in West Africa, the rest of 
</p>
<p>Africa, and even elsewhere in the world. A lot of what drove that popularity was 
</p>
<p>piracy&mdash;it was the circulation of pirated films that made it possible. I remember 
</p>
<p>being at a conference in Cape Town and listening to someone from Namibia com-
</p>
<p>plaining about how Nollywood films were coming in to his country illegally. We 
</p>
<p>were aware of it then, we are aware of it now&mdash;and we made a strategic deci-
</p>
<p>sion, along with our lawyers, to recognize that we did not have the means or the 
</p>
<p>finances to pursue our copyright in a restrictive way. We also recognized that 
</p>
<p>Nigerian films had become a global phenomenon not because we went out there 
</p>
<p>and marketed them, but because of pirate networks. What we found is that piracy 
</p>
<p>decreased our own costs, because the pirates opened up markets that we might 
</p>
<p>have otherwise been unable to afford to reach.
</p>
<p> So we considered things and realized that it all balances out. Right now, for 
</p>
<p>instance, we&rsquo;re looking seriously at markets like Kenya, Brazil, and the West 
</p>
<p>Indies, and we see that our existing popularity there is not because we went in and 
</p>
<p>spent money to promote our films, but because the pirates prepared the ground 
</p>
<p>for us. So it works for us, for producers and distributors. Of course, our actors 
</p>
<p>enjoy tremendous (tremendous!) investment from just being so popular all over 
</p>
<p>the world. In some countries, they are treated like royalty. And the reason for this 
</p>
<p>attention is not because we pushed our films in those countries ourselves.
</p>
<p>AP: As more cinema theatres get built in Nigeria, you will presumably have 
</p>
<p>a greater degree of distribution control over your films. How has the growth of  
</p>
<p>Nollywood contributed to the inception of cinema theatres in Nigeria?
</p>
<p>CI: What has happened is that there has been a resurgence of cinema in Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>That resurgence has resulted in a joint venture to build new multiplexes all over 
</p>
<p>the country, as I explained earlier: They are starting in Lagos and expanding to ten 
</p>
<p>more locations. It is an interesting move, because these people are trying to get 
</p>
<p>local film habits restructured. They&rsquo;re trying to get them to go to see films in a the-
</p>
<p>atre. Once these multiplexes are up and running, I think we can work with them 
</p>
<p>to show Nigerian cinema. At the current time, however, they are being designed to 
</p>
<p>distribute Hollywood films.

</p>
<p>AP: One experience that comes to mind from Bangalore, where I live, is the &ldquo;tent 
</p>
<p>screening.&rdquo; It usually works like this: Some enterprising individual gets a hold of a 
</p>
<p>DVD or VCD (it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether the version is legitimate or pirated), 
</p>
<p>organizes a screening, sells tickets, and keeps the profit. Tent screenings are a 
</p>
<p>common feature in low-income neighborhoods within the city and in small towns 
</p>
<p>elsewhere in the state. Does this kind of thing happen in Nigeria at all?
</p>
<p>CI: It&rsquo;s exactly the same here. We don&rsquo;t get revenue directly from these screen-
</p>
<p>ings, of course. But this is where it would be wise to apply some cultural analy-
</p>
<p>sis. Ours is a country where people like to own stuff. With things that they like, 
</p>
<p>people want to buy and own them&mdash;and this is good. What happens is that when 
</p>
<p>people go to these screenings and see the films, they often want to buy a copy for 
</p>
<p>themselves. They use the screening as a trial, to form an opinion of the film. If the 
</p>
<p>opinion is good (and this is a challenge for our filmmakers, to deliver quality that 
</p>
<p>can be appreciated), then not only do the viewers go out and buy a copy for them-
</p>
<p>selves, they often go ahead and recommend the film to others.
</p>
<p>AP: So, like the appraisal of piracy, would you say that producers in general 
</p>
<p>encourage such informal screenings, since there is eventually a direct commercial 
</p>
<p>benefit to the producers themselves?
</p>
<p>CI: Well, not all producers would be encouraging of this trend. If you are a strong 
</p>
<p>producer who produces really good material, then yes, you would encourage such 
</p>
<p>screenings, since you are fairly confident that people will go out and buy your 
</p>
<p>film after watching it once. But if you are at the bottom of the chain, let us say a 
</p>
<p>producer of substandard cinema, you will not encourage such screenings&mdash;since 
</p>
<p>people are unlikely to go out and buy your film after having watched it once.

</p>
<p>AP: I&rsquo;d like to touch upon an issue of intellectual property within the Nigerian film 
</p>
<p>industry itself. One thing that becomes pretty clear is that when a title becomes 
</p>
<p>popular&mdash;as with Living in Bondage or Osuofia in London&mdash;there is inevitably a 
</p>
<p>sequel to come. Have there been any issues within the film industry or disputes, as 
</p>
<p>to the control of actual characters and plot lines? Are the sequels usually produced 
</p>
<p>by the producer of the original film? Or are they sometimes franchised?
</p>
<p> On a side note, I&rsquo;m currently looking at the Wikipedia entry for Osuofia in Lon-
</p>
<p>don, and it says that the film earned $8.9 million in the United States alone! That 
</p>
<p>seems like an extraordinarily high return, does it not?
</p>
<p>CI: That is a very large sum of money, and perhaps a bit exaggerated. We had 
</p>
<p>exactly that kind of dispute with the sequel to Osuofia in London, but it was sorted 
</p>
<p>out. It is a learning process for us, as well. Many people in the industry have no 
</p>
<p>idea of the legal requirements involved with characters, plots, and so on. In terms 
</p>
<p>of disputes, yes, there are a lot of them related to copyright&mdash;but not quite what 
</p>
<p>you are suggesting. For instance, we have had disputes with large on-line sellers of 
</p>
<p>Nigerian films&mdash;there are retailers who sell in the hundreds of thousands. But each 
</p>
<p>time, we weigh such infringing action against the popularity that the on-line sell-
</p>
<p>ers are enabling for us.
</p>
<p>AP: In India, a recent trend in Hindi cinema has been to court the nonresident Indian, 
</p>
<p>or NRI. The NRI film has now become a staple genre of Hindi cinema, which, while 
</p>
<p>made squarely within the same Mumbai commercial complex as its counterparts, is 
</p>
<p>primarily aimed at foreign audiences in North America and Europe and secondarily 
</p>
<p>pitched to urban, middle-class audiences within India. The overseas financial success 
</p>
<p>of Osuofia got me wondering as to whether such a trend has emerged in Nigeria.
</p>
<p>CI: You see, to draw a parallel, let me take the Indian community in Nigeria. They 
</p>
<p>seem very well organized and articulate. So it is presumably easy to target the 
</p>
<p>Indian community in Nigeria (and in other places) as a market. In contrast, Nige-
</p>
<p>rian communities overseas tend to be less aggregated and more fragmented&mdash;yet 
</p>
<p>no doubt they will access our material if we can provide a structured market. Per-
</p>
<p>haps by selling through ethnic food stores and the like, we can target them. We 
</p>
<p>need to find better distribution within those overseas markets, especially since we 
</p>
<p>know they are buying anyway, even now. In terms of making products that are 
</p>
<p>specifically targeted at the overseas market . . . it has not worked for us. Remem-
</p>
<p>ber, however, that we are already making films for overseas markets&mdash;for the West 
</p>
<p>Indies, South America, the UK, and of course, for other countries in Africa. It is all 
</p>
<p>just coming together now, and as the market organizes, things could change.

<p>CI: After the A2K Conference [in Geneva, 2008], it became clear to me that the 
</p>
<p>world is moving toward a knowledge economy. I realized that we did not have any 
</p>
<p>kind of concerted process for capturing our own knowledge here in Nigeria. At the 
</p>
<p>same time, I realized that the film industry in Nigeria has no research base to refer 
</p>
<p>to in terms of cultural activities within the country. Our rich oral traditions, I felt, 
</p>
<p>had not been recorded well enough for those in the film industry to use. I am try-
</p>
<p>ing, through the BOBTV Expo, to see if we can get together and document some of 
</p>
<p>the stories we refer to in our films&mdash;and thereby create a better knowledge base 
</p>
<p>for everyone. This effort has already started, and we have attracted the notice of 
</p>
<p>government, which is now embarking upon a project with a similar agenda.
</p>
<p>AP: A final question. What is the future of Nollywood? What can we expect in the 
</p>
<p>years to come?
</p>
<p>CI: Well, Nigeria has 140 million people; Africa has about 840 million people; and 
</p>
<p>if you count those of African origin in the Caribbean, Europe, and North America, 
</p>
<p>you have altogether more than a billion people. Nigerian films are the most signifi-
</p>
<p>cant cultural factor that links these communities in the present day.
</p>
<p> The first thing that we have to do is build the infrastructure and the capacity 
</p>
<p>to ensure that we stay in business. Once that is set, the content that we produce&mdash; 
</p>
<p>and the service that we do to Nigeria, to Africa, and to various parts of the world&mdash;
</p>
<p>should put us in a place where we are one of the leading suppliers of content glob-
</p>
<p>ally. After all, our stories are universal. It&rsquo;s just that our technology hasn&rsquo;t yet 
</p>
<p>brought us to the point where we are globally accepted.

<p>A	Copyright	Thriller	versus		
</p>
<p>a	Vision	of	a	Digital	Renaissance
</p>
<p>Sarah Deutsch
</p>
<p>On April 1, 2008, a mysterious piece of new legislation appeared in the e-mail  
</p>
<p>in-boxes of those who follow copyright developments. The e-mail warned of a 
</p>
<p>pending bill entitled The Assuring Protections and Remedies for Intellectual Prop-
</p>
<p>erty Laws Act of 2008. Given the Old Faithful&ndash;like eruptions of new copyright bills 
</p>
<p>in Congress every year, this bill seeking familiar additional &ldquo;protections and rem-
</p>
<p>edies&rdquo; appeared to be genuine. The bill contained all of the standard formatting 
</p>
<p>and headers one finds in copyright legislation. It contained the typical &ldquo;findings&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>section, established a new department of intellectual property security, touted 
</p>
<p>new &ldquo;enhancements&rdquo; to copyright rights, new enforcement powers, and additional 
</p>
<p>technological protection measures. It was only upon a slightly deeper look that one 
</p>
<p>figured out that this latest bill was actually a clever and elaborate April Fools joke.
</p>
<p> The Assuring Protections and Remedies for Intellectual Property Laws Act (the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;APRIL Act&rdquo;) parodies many of the new rights and remedies inserted into count-
</p>
<p>less copyright bills introduced over the past years. For example, the recently intro-
</p>
<p>duced sixty-nine-page Pro IP Act proposed creating a &ldquo;White House Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property Enforcement Representative&rdquo; and revamping the Department of Justice&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Enforcement Division. The APRIL Act instead proposes creat-
</p>
<p>ing a Department of Intellectual Property Security (DIPs), along with a Computer 
</p>
<p>Hacking and Intellectual Property Program at DOJ (CHIPs). Hence, the bill&rsquo;s critical 
</p>
<p>Section 104 is entitled &ldquo;Coordination of CHIPS and DIPS.&rdquo; The bill also picks up on 
</p>
<p>the legislative debates surrounding the Grokster decision,1 codifying new forms of 
</p>
<p>secondary liability for &ldquo;attempted infringement,&rdquo; inducement, and adding a new, 
</p>
<p>even deeper and more obscure layer of &ldquo;tertiary liability.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> In a nod to the issue of copyright-term extension, Section 204 of the bill pro-
</p>
<p>poses a term of perpetuity minus one day. The U.S. Constitution requires that a 
</p>
<p>copyright exist only for a &ldquo;limited term,&rdquo; yet the Supreme Court recently refused </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>deutsch608
</p>
<p>to provide any further insight on what a &ldquo;limited term&rdquo; means, although it has 
</p>
<p>been expanded to the life of the author plus seventy years. And in an acknowl-
</p>
<p>edgement of those bills that seek to expand the scope of copyright law, Section 209 
</p>
<p>extends copyright to broadcasting, databases, and fashion designs (with original-
</p>
<p>ity to be determined by an &ldquo;Originality Czar&rdquo;). Many of these noncopyrightable 
</p>
<p>areas that seek protection under a copyright umbrella are already adequately pro-
</p>
<p>tected under existing law (for example, databases are adequately protected under 
</p>
<p>contract law and theft of broadcast signals under a wide array of federal and state 
</p>
<p>laws), and they thrive without the need for additional copyright protection. The 
</p>
<p>mock bill acknowledges new &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; rights for copyright holders, including the 
</p>
<p>right to disable, interfere with, block, divert, or otherwise impair the unauthorized 
</p>
<p>exercise of any of their exclusive rights. For example, someone could find that files 
</p>
<p>have been removed from their computer or that tracking devices have been placed 
</p>
<p>on their hard drive under the auspices of &ldquo;self-help.&rdquo; The Federal Communications 
</p>
<p>Commission is empowered to adopt &ldquo;Dragon Shield&rdquo; copyright security standards, 
</p>
<p>which, among other attributes, are required to be &ldquo;invincible.&rdquo; In reference to both 
</p>
<p>the old proposed &ldquo;Hollings Bill&rdquo; and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, it cre-
</p>
<p>ates liability for any person who tampers with or undermines the Dragon Shield. 
</p>
<p>The final provision repeals the Copyright Act&rsquo;s prohibition against the federal gov-
</p>
<p>ernment owning copyrighted works and bears a bold copyright notice in the name 
</p>
<p>of the United States Congress.
</p>
<p>the authority: a worst-case scenario
</p>
<p>This legislative parody makes sense only because, as the old adage goes, behind 
</p>
<p>every joke is a grain of truth. It was appreciated by those of us familiar with the 
</p>
<p>recent history of copyright law, because it hints at our fears about the future of 
</p>
<p>copyright. As a group, we have been trained to imagine the worst-case scenarios, 
</p>
<p>so when reading the provisions in the APRIL Act, we could easily move beyond 
</p>
<p>this parody and concoct a future where copyright policy in fact has gone mad.
</p>
<p> One could imagine a bad science-fiction thriller movie, The Authority, that 
</p>
<p>would include a sole &ldquo;Copyright Authority&rdquo; who is much more powerful than any 
</p>
<p>of the copyright departments suggested in recent legislation. Our imaginary Copy-
</p>
<p>right Authority (known as The Authority, or perhaps just &ldquo;C&rdquo;) would be virtually 
</p>
<p>omniscient when it comes to detecting copyright violations. In the opening scene 
</p>
<p>of the movie, the camera would pan on &ldquo;C&rdquo; sitting in an office in a high tower 
</p>
<p>behind a spotless modern desk, wearing the requisite black turtleneck, gold chain 
</p>
<p>with shining copyright symbol, and reflective sunglasses. Copyright violations 
</p>
<p>would stream across a floating electronic billboard like the Wall Street stock ticker.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> a copyright thriller versus a vision of a digital renaissance 609
</p>
<p> In this movie, The Authority has found it necessary to declare its first virtual 
</p>
<p>copyright war and would control the strategy, aided by an army of people and 
</p>
<p>robots. Just as in the movie Minority Report, an army of mechanical spiders would 
</p>
<p>crawl the Internet, scurry through the walls into suspects&rsquo; homes and comput-
</p>
<p>ers, and search for infringements, taking whatever &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; measures might be 
</p>
<p>necessary. Perhaps they might destroy files and equipment, automatically deduct 
</p>
<p>fines and penalties from bank accounts, or publicize the faces and names of viola-
</p>
<p>tors on huge screens like those in Times Square. The movie would not have a sat-
</p>
<p>isfying element of conflict and violence unless the spiders also had the power to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terminate&rdquo; (with a capital T) those that the Authority deems the worst offenders.
</p>
<p> Of course, in our movie, due to years of &ldquo;clarifications&rdquo; to existing laws, what-
</p>
<p>ever protections existed for individuals or third-party intermediaries long ago 
</p>
<p>have disappeared. The new laws have created seamless, one-click primary, sec-
</p>
<p>ondary, and tertiary liability. Elders reminisce about their old iPods, Tivos, and 
</p>
<p>home networks as sad relics of the past. The old-timers recall that they used to 
</p>
<p>be able legitimately to stream content to different rooms of the house, space shift 
</p>
<p>recorded programming, and create libraries of time-shifted content. All the com-
</p>
<p>panies who produced the old innovative products and services would have long 
</p>
<p>ago been sued out of existence. Most remaining black market &ldquo;antiquities&rdquo; would 
</p>
<p>have been seized and destroyed by the spiders. The Copyright Authority would 
</p>
<p>approve all new devices and administer all Internet services. The average citizen 
</p>
<p>would have almost no societal memory of the concept of privacy or reasonable 
</p>
<p>uses of copyrighted works, because rights and penalties for violations were doled 
</p>
<p>out like small electrical shocks to a submissive public.
</p>
<p> The movie, however, would need a protagonist. Perhaps the protagonist 
</p>
<p>would be some deeply recessive genetic mutant who chooses to reject the rules. 
</p>
<p>It would be convenient if our protagonist&rsquo;s great-great-grandfather might have 
</p>
<p>left an undiscovered cache of equipment, devices, and communications networks 
</p>
<p>as weapons to fight back against The Authority. And, of course, we would need 
</p>
<p>to figure out how to insert the requisite car chase scene, with the Authority and 
</p>
<p>squadron of spiders in hot pursuit.
</p>
<p> But, this overexaggerated, nightmarish yarn would never pass muster in a real 
</p>
<p>Hollywood movie script. Note that in the real movie Be Kind, Rewind, the protago-
</p>
<p>nists dangerously create and film their own retakes of famous Hollywood movies 
</p>
<p>after their entire inventory of movie rentals is accidentally erased. Their innova-
</p>
<p>tive derivative works become huge word-of-mouth hits in their low-income com-
</p>
<p>munity, and their video store&rsquo;s business begins to thrive. But, the plot does not 
</p>
<p>permit this kind of creative success to continue. The studio executives show up to 
</p>
<p>enforce the protagonists&rsquo; copyright violations with a steamroller, destroying all the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>610
</p>
<p>tapes as the neighbors sadly look on. Fortunately, the protagonists of our movie 
</p>
<p>use their new-found talents to create their own original copyrightable film that 
</p>
<p>unites their community and celebrates their history at the same time.
</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that our copyright thriller would ever become anything 
</p>
<p>more than frightening imaginary and unmarketable plot. But unlike Be Kind, 
</p>
<p>Rewind, the controversial copyright issues at the heart of this script could not be 
</p>
<p>salvaged by the sudden appearance of a steamroller. Fortunately (at least to date), 
</p>
<p>however, most of the worst-case copyright scenarios that appear in legislation 
</p>
<p>never come to pass. While copyright continues to expand through new bills intro-
</p>
<p>duced each year, the worst-case scenarios usually do not survive the U.S. legisla-
</p>
<p>tive process unless they reflect the input of all stakeholders.
</p>
<p>only connect: a best-case vision of a digital renaissance
</p>
<p>Let us now envision a completely different future&mdash;a best-case scenario. In this 
</p>
<p>figment of the imagination (a mere idea not subject to the protections of copy-
</p>
<p>right), copyright policy fights have long been abandoned as futile. All industry 
</p>
<p>players, including copyright owners, on-line intermediaries, device manufacturers, 
</p>
<p>software companies, and other players are completely engrossed in the new task 
</p>
<p>at hand: devoting every possible resource to meet the exploding demand for new 
</p>
<p>content, products, and services. The copyright policy disputes of prior decades 
</p>
<p>now seem irrelevant, and there is money to be made. Users are also too fully occu-
</p>
<p>pied creating their own content and availing themselves of an endless supply of 
</p>
<p>readily available content to waste their time illegally downloading. In a nutshell, 
</p>
<p>everyone is too focused on creating, distributing, and using content to see any 
</p>
<p>need to infringe copyrights, sue each other over them, or seek punitive legislation.
</p>
<p> In this scenario, in the more technologically advantaged societies, where every-
</p>
<p>one now is a copyright owner and creator, all would gain newfound respect for 
</p>
<p>copyright. And in the developing world, citizens would more slowly, but increas-
</p>
<p>ingly gain access to technology, computers, and broadband Internet access and 
</p>
<p>become increasingly interested in developing their own unique cultural content and 
</p>
<p>creations. At the same time, all would recognize that increased interdependence 
</p>
<p>requires flexibility to allow others to make liberal uses of copyrightable works to 
</p>
<p>build upon and add value to existing works. (Our scenario, conveniently, will fast-
</p>
<p>forward through at least a decade of &ldquo;unpleasantness,&rdquo; where the rules governing 
</p>
<p>who gets paid, how much, and what uses are considered fair and reasonable get 
</p>
<p>ironed out.) The notion of &ldquo;user-generated content&rdquo; would become an oxymoron, 
</p>
<p>because the new digital renaissance would encourage everyone to create music, art, 
</p>
<p>films, literature, and new forms of derivative works that defy the imagination. The 
</p>
<p>deutsch</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>611
</p>
<p>marketplace supporting this digital renaissance would profit equally from the dis-
</p>
<p>tribution of creative content in both the physical and the virtual worlds.
</p>
<p> Broadband speeds and services would continue to grow and with them supply 
</p>
<p>an endless array of interactive devices. Users would continuously send streams of 
</p>
<p>content across multiple platforms and devices. Almost any item capable of con-
</p>
<p>taining electronics would become a new mobile device. Innovative and ubiquitous 
</p>
<p>payment systems would develop and along with them interfaces to interact with 
</p>
<p>our constant stream of content. Home networking would extend beyond the home, 
</p>
<p>and words such as &ldquo;time shifting,&rdquo; &ldquo;space shifting,&rdquo; and &ldquo;format shifting&rdquo; would 
</p>
<p>seem as obvious and antiquated as the &ldquo;Information Superhighway.&rdquo; Although dig-
</p>
<p>ital rights management (DRM) and enforcement options would still exist, the need 
</p>
<p>for onerous DRM or expensive enforcement actions would not be nearly as great 
</p>
<p>in a world where the marketplace is thriving.
</p>
<p> Large content companies would be thriving. They would profit from strong 
</p>
<p>partnership arrangements with Internet service providers, device manufacturers, 
</p>
<p>and other suppliers. Consumers would earn new income streams from individual 
</p>
<p>partnership arrangements with content companies and distributors.
</p>
<p> Companies would share revenue with the public and reward the public for cre-
</p>
<p>ating, distributing, and promoting new content in unique one-to-one communica-
</p>
<p>tions. Notably, the ability to share content in a small community means that entire 
</p>
<p>specialized on-line communities could generate content and earn income in both 
</p>
<p>the physical and the virtual worlds. Groups might be devoted to a particular movie, 
</p>
<p>book, or music or might sell unique versions of derivative works. Profit-sharing 
</p>
<p>arrangements would benefit the creators, copyright owners, and users alike. And 
</p>
<p>of course, the newfound societal approval for creating derivative works would 
</p>
<p>now mean that we would laugh more (and live longer) as the best new parodies of 
</p>
<p>the century were celebrated and shared.
</p>
<p> Our technology and content sectors would also embrace the business notion 
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;creative disruptions.&rdquo; Companies would understand that they must adapt to, 
</p>
<p>rather than fight changes that threaten their business models and seek innovative 
</p>
<p>ways to profit from those changes. For example, in the old days of telecommunica-
</p>
<p>tions, criminals sought to profit from schemes to steal long-distance, international, 
</p>
<p>or cellular telecommunications services. As communications companies shifted to 
</p>
<p>selling generous buckets of minutes at reasonable and compelling price offerings, 
</p>
<p>this encouraged increased usage of their services, and the need to steal suddenly 
</p>
<p>seemed irrelevant. This is, after all, the history of the telephone industry, too: In 
</p>
<p>the old days, long-distance or &ldquo;toll calls&rdquo; were very expensive, so people used to 
</p>
<p>steal phone service through black-box devices and other schemes. They no longer 
</p>
<p>do that, because today, the cost of calls or the Internet is low enough that it&rsquo;s not 
</p>
<p> a copyright thriller versus a vision of a digital renaissance</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>612
</p>
<p>worth anyone&rsquo;s effort to steal. Likewise, in the copyright industry, content own-
</p>
<p>ers would explore selling volumes of content through compelling and attractive 
</p>
<p>bundles, including buckets of downloads at fast speeds, and package them with 
</p>
<p>additional content extras not otherwise available. Gradually, the need to download 
</p>
<p>illegally would appear outmoded and irrelevant.
</p>
<p> Our digital renaissance would borrow from the rallying cry in a famous work 
</p>
<p>of literature. In Howard&rsquo;s End, E. M. Forster begins the novel with the call &ldquo;Only 
</p>
<p>connect . . .&rdquo; and carries that theme throughout the book. Howard&rsquo;s End teaches the 
</p>
<p>lesson that fulfillment comes when people with different values&mdash;those focused 
</p>
<p>on spiritual values and those concerned with material goods&mdash;ultimately connect 
</p>
<p>and engage with each other: &ldquo;Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. 
</p>
<p>Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love 
</p>
<p>will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> In our scenario of a digital renaissance, the power to connect requires the need 
</p>
<p>for a robust and healthy broadband market, innovative new devices and services, 
</p>
<p>and the ability to generate and distribute attractive content in a robust marketplace. 
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;only connect&rdquo; scenario might be the unifying theme linking content owners, 
</p>
<p>users, distributors, device manufacturers, and others in a more harmonious future.

<p>1 Copyright liability applies to those who are either found primarily liable (direct infringe-
</p>
<p>ment) or secondarily liable (contributory or vicarious infringement). The Grokster decision 
</p>
<p>explored the concept of whether one could be found secondarily liable for &ldquo;inducing another 
</p>
<p>to infringe,&rdquo; for example by taking purposeful steps in advertising infringing conduct. The 
</p>
<p>APRIL Act imagines that the chain of secondary liability should be further extended down to 
</p>
<p>indirect recipients of copyrighted works in the distribution chain.

</p>
<p>In the future as I envision it, two social mutations are possible. In both, the reach 
</p>
<p>of the Internet and its associated technologies, already broad at the beginning of 
</p>
<p>the new millennium, spread ever more expansively, infiltrating and thus altering 
</p>
<p>many domains of daily life. But intellectual property does not play the same role 
</p>
<p>in both, and the outcomes are very different.
</p>
<p>a marginalization of &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the movement for open-source software and open access is 
</p>
<p>very successful, facilitating the use of open initiatives allowing users to search the 
</p>
<p>Internet and store and share information (for example, Firefox, Wikipedia, blogs, 
</p>
<p>and social-networking sites such as MySpace and the travel site Dopplr) and to par-
</p>
<p>ticipate in open collaborative work, first in the software sector, but soon in many 
</p>
<p>other sectors. More and more information becomes freely available on-line, and 
</p>
<p>scores of scientific and academic data sources are in the public domain, accessible as 
</p>
<p>long as one has access to a computer and can get on-line. The plugged-in population, 
</p>
<p>in turn, grows dramatically, fueled by a number of initiatives, from municipalities, 
</p>
<p>companies, and other institutions, to spread and decentralize broadband and Wi-Fi 
</p>
<p>technology and access. Private-sector attempts to control the &ldquo;tubes&rdquo; through which 
</p>
<p>information is disseminated fail. Open-access policies prevail, denying broadcast-
</p>
<p>ers and Webcasters the copyright they seek to secure on information they publish. 
</p>
<p>Although there remain plenty of content and numerous channels, programs, ser-
</p>
<p>vices, and goods accessible only through the paying property system, users generate 
</p>
<p>and share so much material that people can typically find enough of what they need 
</p>
<p>to avoid that system altogether. In this context, knowledge previously defined by 
</p>
<p>the principle of intellectual property as a scarce resource to which access is limited

<p>through ownership becomes so plentiful that it overwhelms and effectively out-
</p>
<p>dates the notion of ownership.
</p>
<p> In one way or another, countless Internet users get involved in the production 
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;information goods.&rdquo; Networks of users and producers of information form flex-
</p>
<p>ible communities, and many of these users are members of multiple, miscellaneous 
</p>
<p>communities. Of course, networks face internal power relations and experience 
</p>
<p>governance issues, power struggles, and crises. They emerge, grow, transform, or 
</p>
<p>disappear. Some become long-term fixtures, while others experience stunning suc-
</p>
<p>cess and a speedy death. Networks become learning bodies. Users acquire skills 
</p>
<p>as network members, develop them, and pass them on when they migrate to new 
</p>
<p>communities. A noteworthy evolution takes place as users and communities elabo-
</p>
<p>rate models to facilitate information production that remains stable, regardless of 
</p>
<p>the birth or death of any particular network or community.
</p>
<p> An important common aspect of these forms of production and consumption 
</p>
<p>is that money is not the sinew of war. Users seek information, friends, recogni-
</p>
<p>tion, and advice and invest time, humor, sex, knowledge, and resources. What-
</p>
<p>ever the exchange, they deem it worthwhile and participate freely in these  
</p>
<p>creative, sometimes arduous and time-consuming, activities. Their involvement

<p>social mutations in the future 615
</p>
<p>can be passionate or topical and temporary, and of course, there are many who 
</p>
<p>are not members of such networks or communities at all. Substantial portions of 
</p>
<p>the planet&rsquo;s population still do not have access to computers or the Internet, but, 
</p>
<p>in the long run, across the globe, a stable critical mass develop and continues to 
</p>
<p>contribute to the survival and advancement of an open system.
</p>
<p> Studies in Germany, Spain, and India have shown how individuals&rsquo; relation to 
</p>
<p>work, on the one hand, and to the idea of individual performance, on the other, 
</p>
<p>change as a result of the development of these new models and their appropria-
</p>
<p>tion by ever larger segments of the population. Most users do not see the creation, 
</p>
<p>acquisition, and communication occurring on computers after hours as &ldquo;work.&rdquo; In 
</p>
<p>fact, neuroscience studies show that the brain does not treat these activities as 
</p>
<p>work, assuming instead the same resting state as in response to any other hobby. 
</p>
<p>The studies demonstrate that people&rsquo;s perception of their own performance, usu-
</p>
<p>ally shaped first by school and subsequently by the work environment, is readily 
</p>
<p>altered by their participation in creation and communication experiences on the 
</p>
<p>Internet and that the increased sense of self-efficacy encourages them to engage in 
</p>
<p>activities or explore fields they would not otherwise have approached in actual&mdash;
</p>
<p>as opposed to virtual&mdash;reality. Moreover, the various stratification systems that 
</p>
<p>exclude potential participants in &ldquo;real life,&rdquo; such as hierarchy or class, have less 
</p>
<p>traction in the cyberworld, though language, of course, continues to present a con-
</p>
<p>siderable obstacle.
</p>
<p> This overwhelming success of the open-source system is fueled by perfor-
</p>
<p>mance and efficacy. Users no longer need the big software companies when they 
</p>
<p>can update their software gratuitously and reliably. Costing little or nothing, open-
</p>
<p>source software will offer many valuable programs, as well as virtual twenty-four-
</p>
<p>hour help lines of fellow beneficiaries. Of course, this doe not happened overnight. 
</p>
<p>Cognizant of the comparative cost effectiveness of open-source software develop-
</p>
<p>ment, computer companies adopt that model. When Dell subsequently starts to sell 
</p>
<p>Linux-installed computers, consumers quickly catch on, first on account of politics 
</p>
<p>and then simply because of the lower cost. Ultimately, all major computer corpora-
</p>
<p>tions decide to use open-source software and base upon it the services they sell to  
</p>
<p>their customers.
</p>
<p> In some cases, the enforcement of intellectual property protection is precisely 
</p>
<p>the reason users turn to open-access products: Cybercaf&eacute; operators in developing 
</p>
<p>countries, for example, shift to open-source code to preclude the consequences of 
</p>
<p>using illegal software. Governments do so, too, on account of outlay, legality, and 
</p>
<p>software compatibility issues that might otherwise create obstacles to normal gov-
</p>
<p>ernance and the successful implementation of national policies. The same is true 
</p>
<p>of institutions underpinned in part by principles of public service (for example, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>616
</p>
<p>schools, universities, libraries, and hospitals), whose interests in the public good 
</p>
<p>provide sufficient incentive for this sort of change. Once some of these established 
</p>
<p>institutions take the plunge, others follow. Meanwhile, a wide range of open- 
</p>
<p>publishing initiatives and services are created, and millions of open-publishing 
</p>
<p>acts flood the Internet.
</p>
<p> These conditions force a drastic change in the parameters of production and dis-
</p>
<p>tribution in many sectors. A number of industries, including entertainment, com-
</p>
<p>munications, and pharmaceuticals, change their business models, reinstating manu-
</p>
<p>facturing and selling in industrial quantities as the main source of revenue in some 
</p>
<p>cases. An open-source approach to medical research takes hold, as well, in countries 
</p>
<p>in both the Global North and the Global South. Inspired by the openness of the 
</p>
<p>Human Genome Project and first used by public institutions conducting research on 
</p>
<p>tuberculosis, the open-source model rapidly yields positive results and is embraced 
</p>
<p>by the private sector, as well&mdash;in order to access the databases fed by research-
</p>
<p>ers, one needs to be a member and contribute to the general effort, a condition 
</p>
<p>that constitutes a powerful incentive for companies to join the club. Quickly, this 
</p>
<p>open-access approach proves much more effective at fostering innovative research 
</p>
<p>than the secretive patent system. A lot of companies restructure their activities and 
</p>
<p>specialize in the development and organization of clinical tests, as potential drug 
</p>
<p>candidates are identified. Still, probably the most spectacular mutation takes place 
</p>
<p>in education, where open-source software and open access facilitate a new type of 
</p>
<p>legitimization, divorced from conventional institutions and thus positioned to jam 
</p>
<p>the traditional mechanism of the reproduction of the stratified social order.
</p>
<p> In a way, in this scenario, we can witness a popular outflanking not only of 
</p>
<p>the intellectual property system, but of the traditional, stratified social structure 
</p>
<p>that is anchored upon it. The logic and the exercise of open-source production 
</p>
<p>show a tremendous normative effect on cultural production and appropriation, 
</p>
<p>social practices and representations, and the rigid social structures characteristic of  
</p>
<p>most societies.
</p>
<p>the era of free exploitation
</p>
<p>In the second scenario, the spread of the Internet and the persistent enforcement 
</p>
<p>of intellectual property restrictions leads to social mutations that are much less 
</p>
<p>promising: the metastasization of neoliberal logics and practices throughout the 
</p>
<p>knowledge economy and the information society and the consequent exacerbation 
</p>
<p>of social and economic polarities.
</p>
<p> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2011, George Arturp&aacute;n will become 
</p>
<p>the theorist of the articulation between neoliberalism and knowledge capitalism.

</p>
<p>He developed and first used the notion of &ldquo;free accumulation&rdquo; (or &ldquo;free exploita-
</p>
<p>tion&rdquo;), which subsequently and rapidly was adopted as a central concept by many 
</p>
<p>governments. It became the heart of the Treaty for International Development, 
</p>
<p>Free Accumulation, and Trade (TIDFAT), which will be signed after eight years of 
</p>
<p>negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
</p>
<p>Development (UNCTAD).
</p>
<p> In the knowledge society as it develops in this scenario, the slogan is &ldquo;double 
</p>
<p>free.&rdquo; Immaterial goods are not only free to access, they are also free of charge, at 
</p>
<p>least for those producing their quota of creativity units (CUs).
</p>
<p> Once a year, beside one&rsquo;s income, individuals have to declare the CUs they have 
</p>
<p>accumulated throughout the year. The threshold they reach varies from one per-
</p>
<p>son to another and is calculated by the state, taking into account the individual&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>age, creativity quotient (a sort of IQ established during schooling through tests or 
</p>
<p>assessed at the request of the administration for those who did not benefit from 
</p>
<p>normal schooling), and level of education. Ratified by 204 countries, TIDFAT estab-
</p>
<p>lishes these thresholds and modalities of calculation, both of which can be reeval-
</p>
<p>uated, if necessary, during the annual General Assembly of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>The CUs can be capitalized, rolled over from one year to the next in the event of 
</p>
<p>a surplus above one&rsquo;s predetermined threshold, or transmitted to members of the 
</p>
<p>same family. Individuals who meet their CU quota will receive a personal code for 
</p>
<p>Access to the Resources of Information and Communication Technologies (ARICT), 
</p>
<p>allowing them to connect and access the totality of the Global Resources (GR) of 
</p>
<p>the Internet&mdash;as opposed to the Open Resources (OR) accessible without an ARICT 
</p>
<p>code&mdash;which belong to a planetary library of data and information owned by the 
</p>
<p>public as well as by the private sector.
</p>
<p> In addition, each person is a member of a multitude of virtual networks, pro-
</p>
<p>fessional as well as social. Information and interconnection are the two elements 
</p>
<p>that allow individuals to work and produce. Each person is free to perform in the 
</p>
<p>field of her or his choice, which does not have to be the same from one day to 
</p>
<p>another or over the years. Private companies (in fact, there are fewer and fewer 
</p>
<p>traditional firms, and companies are more and more referred to simply in terms 
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;label&rdquo; or &ldquo;brand&rdquo;) and public institutions publish their needs and interests on 
</p>
<p>the Internet. These are circulated as job descriptions or mission profiles. Anyone 
</p>
<p>can register, and thus &ldquo;self-employ&rdquo; oneself, so to speak, in order to fulfill the 
</p>
<p>requested task. Labels or institutions generally set a maximum of possible enroll-
</p>
<p>ments. Once the pool is full, the jobs are no longer available. The remuneration of 
</p>
<p>individuals generally originates from several sources, depending on the different 
</p>
<p>missions or the projects to which they contributed over a period of time. A sal-
</p>
<p>ary for each fulfilled task is calculated and offered by the label or institution that 
</p>
<p>social mutations in the future</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>618
</p>
<p>posted the mission. It comes with a number of CUs and a bonus in cases of particu-
</p>
<p>larly important findings or efficient work.
</p>
<p> The labels are put to work financially according to the pertinence and the inter-
</p>
<p>est of the research they are piloting and the products they make. Their quotations 
</p>
<p>on the stock exchange depend as much on the products they launch as on financial 
</p>
<p>experts&rsquo; estimates of their potential, based on the publication of research projects 
</p>
<p>and mission profiles for which they are recruiting. The one to receive the highest 
</p>
<p>marks may be the first one to launch an interesting request or the first to find the 
</p>
<p>answer to it. Industrial secrecy is actually limited to a minimum, because the trans-
</p>
<p>parency of the research conducted is almost total. Anybody can copy anybody. It 
</p>
<p>is knowing how to conduct and lead innovation&mdash;innovation guided by awareness 
</p>
<p>of society&rsquo;s needs&mdash;that makes the difference. This system allows teeming creativ-
</p>
<p>ity and innovation in all fields of technology.
</p>
<p> Knowledge and information are now considered the raw material accessi-
</p>
<p>ble to individuals. They are a common good freely shared by ARICT code own-
</p>
<p>ers, who develop their creativity and professional activities using computer tools 
</p>
<p>and Internet potential. This work, mostly contributed in a nonsubaltern fashion, 
</p>
<p>is extremely productive. Individuals enjoy much freedom regarding both the con-
</p>
<p>tent of their work and the way it is organized  in time and space, which contrib-
</p>
<p>utes to increasing their motivation, in part by enhancing the pleasure they derive 
</p>
<p>from doing their work. This, connected to the type of cooperation and intercon-
</p>
<p>nection existing through digital networks, allows an extreme efficiency in creation  
</p>
<p>and production.
</p>
<p> However, the United Nations shows that 40 percent of the world population, 
</p>
<p>which represents around 3 billion people, still does not have an ARICT code. These 
</p>
<p>numbers, of course, correlate with known statistics on literacy and level of educa-
</p>
<p>tion. Back in 2000, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Orga-
</p>
<p>nization estimated that around 900 million people in the world did not know how 
</p>
<p>to read. With the population increase in developing countries, this number has 
</p>
<p>reached 1.2 billion. That same year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
</p>
<p>and Development calculated that in fourteen of its twenty member states, 15 per-
</p>
<p>cent of the adult population had reading skills so rudimentary that they had a hard 
</p>
<p>time adapting to the information era&mdash;even, in the United States, the United King-
</p>
<p>dom, Canada, and Switzerland. Almost twenty years later, this figure has barely 
</p>
<p>decreased to 12 percent.
</p>
<p> The dawn of the neoliberal era led to the progressive disintegration of the 
</p>
<p>social benefits inherited from the period of the New Deal and the welfare state, 
</p>
<p>while the structural-adjustment policies of the World Bank and the International 
</p>
<p>Monetary Fund provoked the demolition of the public-health and education 
</p>
<p>krikorian  </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>systems in developing countries. As a consequence, access to training and educa-
</p>
<p>tion institutions is now limited for sizable proportions of the populations in poor 
</p>
<p>countries and for the poor populations in rich countries. Inequalities continue to 
</p>
<p>increase throughout the intervening years, and the capitalization and assimilation 
</p>
<p>of knowledge, which is at the heart of the system of production of free exploi-
</p>
<p>tation, proves to be particularly discriminatory and leads to great exclusions. 
</p>
<p>Globally, the world society is divided into two main social classes: those who live 
</p>
<p>and work in the universe of digital knowledge, play with ideas and data, and are 
</p>
<p>both users and producers of knowledge, on the one hand, and those anchored 
</p>
<p>in postindustrial capitalism, whose performance is based on more traditional 
</p>
<p>accumulation and exploitation mechanisms, on the other. There is also an inter-
</p>
<p>mediary population that does not necessarily reach its CU quota at the fringe of 
</p>
<p>these two systems. From one year to the next, those belonging to this population 
</p>
<p>move from one world to another, depending on the results of their work or their  
</p>
<p>personal choices.
</p>
<p> The old system of creation based on intellectual property is still in place in the 
</p>
<p>postindustrial world, and its enforcement contributes to marking the distinction 
</p>
<p>between the two universes. It ensures a nonporosity, so that free goods in digital 
</p>
<p>networks are not able to be transferred in the market area. Of course, trafficking in 
</p>
<p>ARICT codes and free data exists, but it is staunched and remains marginal. Sanc-
</p>
<p>tions on the illegal use of data, whether it be raw digital data or data transferred to 
</p>
<p>physical media, is extremely harsh. It is even easier to criminalize illegal use and 
</p>
<p>to apply sanctions, since the surveillance and detection of offenses focuses only 
</p>
<p>on a portion of the world population&mdash;those for whom access to technologies is 
</p>
<p>relatively limited. Customs authorities, police, and private companies work hand in 
</p>
<p>hand at the local as well as international levels.
</p>
<p> Surveys conducted on disadvantaged populations show that individuals who 
</p>
<p>live within the postindustrial system globally have a limited interest in the possibil-
</p>
<p>ity of accessing another type of life and work. They are fully absorbed in the world 
</p>
<p>they know, in which they have a job, a life, objectives, and concerns. For many 
</p>
<p>reasons, transfers from one world to the other is rather limited.
</p>
<p> Cases such as that of Miguel Hern&aacute;ndez, the self-educated son of a shepherd 
</p>
<p>who became one of Spain&rsquo;s greatest poets and playwrights of the twentieth cen-
</p>
<p>tury, is rare. Despite the social handicaps they have to deal with, some especially 
</p>
<p>gifted individuals are able to access a universe that has, since birth, treated them 
</p>
<p>as outsiders. However, even those, when they develop the resources for their inte-
</p>
<p>gration, may in the end be reluctant to cut the links with their original anchorage 
</p>
<p>and environment. Thus, as Pablo Neruda recounted about Hern&aacute;ndez in &ldquo;Confieso 
</p>
<p>he vivido&rdquo; (1974):
</p>
<p>social mutations in the future</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>620
</p>
<p>As he did not have enough to live, I looked around to find him a job. It was difficult 
</p>
<p>for a poet to find work in Spain. Finally a viscount, high-ranking official of the 
</p>
<p>Relations, got interested in him and said yes, he was okay, that he had read Miguel&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>verses, that he admired him, and Miguel should indicate what kind of job he was 
</p>
<p>willing to take so that he could write his appointment. Full of joy, I told the poet:
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Miguel Hern&aacute;ndez, you finally have fortune. The Viscount is hiring you. You 
</p>
<p>will be a high employee. Tell me what sort of position do you want to exert so that 
</p>
<p>we can process your hiring.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Miguel remained pondering. His face, with large premature lines, covered itself with  
</p>
<p>a musing mist. Hours went by and we had to wait until the afternoon for him to respond 
</p>
<p>to me. With the bright eyes of someone who finds the solution to his life, he told me:
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Could the Viscount trust me with a herd of goat around here, close to Madrid?&rdquo;
</p>
<p> However, the sharp distinction between the two worlds generates tensions and 
</p>
<p>potential conflicts. The era of free accumulation may not end as a peaceful one. As 
</p>
<p>Hern&aacute;ndez once said, and others might now repeat:
</p>
<p>I gather my hunger, my sorrows, and these scars
</p>
<p>that I wear from my working with stones and axes,
</p>
<p>to your hungers, your sorrows, and your branded flesh,
</p>
<p>because to calm our desperation of castigated bulls
</p>
<p>we have to come together into an oceanic roar.
</p>
<p>We will have to see the fields fertilized with wrongful
</p>
<p> blood,
</p>
<p>We will have to see the fierce crescent of the sickle
</p>
<p> approaching the napes,
</p>
<p>We will have to see it all nobly impassive,
</p>
<p>We will have to do it all suffering a little less than what we
</p>
<p> suffer now from hunger,
</p>
<p>that makes us reach out our innocent animal hands
</p>
<p>toward robbery and crime, our saviors.1

</p>
<p>In the future, would it be possible for essential medicines to be accessible to the 
</p>
<p>majority of the population in developing countries? If we examine worldwide 
</p>
<p>consumption of medicines today, at the end of the first decade of the twenty-
</p>
<p>first century, we find that 80 percent of transnational companies&rsquo; income comes 
</p>
<p>from developed countries such as the United States, Japan, Canada, and Western 
</p>
<p>Europe. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), 30 per-
</p>
<p>cent of the global population has no access to medicines. In poor areas of some 
</p>
<p>countries in Asia and Africa, the population with no access to medicines is above 
</p>
<p>50 percent. The lack of public policies and the indifference of many governments 
</p>
<p>have systematically excluded certain populations from a universal human right&mdash;
</p>
<p>the right to life.
</p>
<p> This exclusionary situation was compounded by the fact that in 1994, transna-
</p>
<p>tional companies were able to insert intellectual property into the global system 
</p>
<p>of free trade via the TRIPS Agreement, allowing them to exert more control over 
</p>
<p>the worldwide market. Until the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tar-
</p>
<p>iffs and Trade in 1986, there was greater flexibility for governments to decide what 
</p>
<p>would be best for their own societies. Over fifty countries did not grant patents in 
</p>
<p>areas considered strategic, such as medicines, and they did not suffer any decline 
</p>
<p>in investments because of this decision. But the system of industrial patents was 
</p>
<p>globalized according to the logic of maximizing profits at any cost, including social 
</p>
<p>costs. The control of the market, including guarantees of noncompetitiveness by 
</p>
<p>generic industries, has constrained developing countries by subjecting them to 
</p>
<p>various types of pressure and threats.
</p>
<p> Today, developing countries are technologically dependent, even when pro-
</p>
<p>moting appropriate public policies such as universal access to medicines for HIV/
</p>
<p>AIDS patients. They are required to pay high fees to the owners of the patents,

</p>
<p>who continue to affirm unfairly that the fees are necessary to recoup their invest-
</p>
<p>ments. The right to life is subjugated to the right to property.
</p>
<p> My greatest concern for the future is that strengthening patent owners&rsquo; rights 
</p>
<p>will have a negative effect on developing countries&rsquo; efforts to improve public 
</p>
<p>health and advance technologically and economically. This is particularly worri-
</p>
<p>some with respect to the effect of patents on the rising price of medicines and the 
</p>
<p>availability of sources for pharmaceutical products.
</p>
<p> In light of the present situation of the international intellectual property 
</p>
<p>system, I will present and analyze two possible future scenarios of the regula-
</p>
<p>tory framework for intellectual property in the future and their consequences for 
</p>
<p>access to medicines and the inalienable right to life.
</p>
<p>first scenario: strengthening international  
intellectual property rules
</p>
<p>The first scenario is based on the current status of the intellectual property sys-
</p>
<p>tem, along with the tridimensional tendency proposed by M. F. Jorge in which the 
</p>
<p>TRIPS Agreement is a minimum standard in the multilateral sphere, while in the 
</p>
<p>regional, bilateral, and local spheres, there is a strengthening of rules, commonly 
</p>
<p>referred to as &ldquo;TRIPS-plus.&rdquo;1
</p>
<p> The flexibilities currently provided in the TRIPS Agreement&mdash;compulsory 
</p>
<p>licensing, provisions for parallel imports in the Doha Declaration, and the under-
</p>
<p>standing that retaliation by member countries is not allowed&mdash;are inadequate, 
</p>
<p>because they do not ensure that when governments attempt to put these flexibili-
</p>
<p>ties to use, they are able to do so easily. The mechanisms are not simple, and many 
</p>
<p>national legislatures have bureaucratic and legal impediments to putting compul-
</p>
<p>sory licensing into practice.
</p>
<p> National laws frequently foresee the importation of medicines and/or active 
</p>
<p>ingredients acquired on the international market. However, currently, they link 
</p>
<p>such acquisition to approval by the title bearer. They do not institute the title 
</p>
<p>bearer&rsquo;s obligations with regard to fully disclosing the know-how for making them 
</p>
<p>or to ensuring that the licensee can acquire the ingredients at accessible prices, and 
</p>
<p>in the case of compulsory licenses, they do not define the procedure for acquiring 
</p>
<p>or managing such licenses.
</p>
<p> Although the current situation is thus already highly unfavorable for access 
</p>
<p>to medicines, the situation could become even more unfavorable if bilateral 
</p>
<p>agreements come to constitute the norm, if the proposed international patent is 
</p>
<p>established, if a move to link patents to registration with regulatory agencies is 
</p>
<p>approved, and if in 2016 the countries that are currently classified as very poor </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the future of intellectual property and access to medicine 623
</p>
<p>lose their right not to recognize patents. Within the regulatory framework of pat-
</p>
<p>ent concession, the situation for access to medicines will deteriorate if the criteria 
</p>
<p>become more flexible in order to allow patents for second use (which is permitted, 
</p>
<p>for example, in Brazilian legislation via procedures of examination of patentability) 
</p>
<p>and patents for products already known to the public, but produced in new com-
</p>
<p>binations such as 3TC+AZT+NVP for treating HIV/AIDS, Furosemida + Captopril  
</p>
<p>for treating hypertension, and Artesunato + Mefloquina for treating malaria.
</p>
<p> Under this scenario, the consequences will be catastrophic for access to medi-
</p>
<p>cines, because generic producers will not have access to the most recent and rel-
</p>
<p>evant technological information for processes, information necessary for the  
</p>
<p>strategy of reverse engineering, which today is possible through the Bolar Excep-
</p>
<p>tion, which holds that the rights of the patent do not apply to research activities or 
</p>
<p>to the registration of the medicine for commercialization.2
</p>
<p> Difficulties exist in applying compulsory licensing when availability of the 
</p>
<p>product on the international market is absolutely lacking. This situation creates 
</p>
<p>an absolute monopolistic power in which weapons are unnecessary for subjugat-
</p>
<p>ing developing countries. In the future, if the decision about who will have access 
</p>
<p>to products is consolidated in the hands of the holders of intellectual property

</p>
<p>rights, even when developing countries have policies that are just, democratic, and 
</p>
<p>nonsubservient, even when civil-society participation is organized and coherent in 
</p>
<p>order to ensure the transparency of public policy, the private rights granted by the 
</p>
<p>state will overpower the rights of citizens.
</p>
<p>second scenario: reform of the international system  
of intellectual property
</p>
<p>The second scenario is based on the premise that the majority of United Nation 
</p>
<p>member countries&mdash;developing countries&mdash;will realize that they need citizens who 
</p>
<p>are healthy in order to survive as a nation and achieve development. They will 
</p>
<p>come to this understanding after the dark period of the AIDS epidemic, when a 
</p>
<p>significant portion of the population has died and others have had their life expec-
</p>
<p>tancy diminished. They will understand the necessity of establishing public poli-
</p>
<p>cies guaranteeing treatment for their populations and that the transparency of the 
</p>
<p>process will be guaranteed only through the participative representation of civil 
</p>
<p>society. In essence, they will understand that human rights should prevail over pri-
</p>
<p>vate rights, guaranteeing access to essential and strategically important medicines.
</p>
<p> They will consider that strategic investments are necessary for discovering new 
</p>
<p>pharmaceuticals. Therefore, clear definitions will be established regarding what 
</p>
<p>should be rewarded with prizes such as patents and how long these rewards should 
</p>
<p>prevail for those discoveries that are in fact inventive and that result in a good  
</p>
<p>for society.
</p>
<p> The developed countries will argue vehemently that universal respect for intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights is a tool for advancing research and development, because 
</p>
<p>exclusive market rights attract the investment of the pharmaceutical industry. Yet 
</p>
<p>to which markets, precisely, does this argument refer? If we look at developing 
</p>
<p>countries, we see that after the TRIPS Agreement was implemented at the end of 
</p>
<p>1994, there were no concrete results with regard to technology transfers or access 
</p>
<p>to knowledge. Furthermore, issues such as the lack of an obligation for local pro-
</p>
<p>duction (a mechanism that promotes technological absorption) and for technologi-
</p>
<p>cal investments in developing countries remained merely issues under discussion, 
</p>
<p>with no actions taken. For all these reasons, the first step in the future will be 
</p>
<p>to delink intellectual property from the laws of commerce, returning intellectual 
</p>
<p>property to its initial institutional locus, internationally, which is the World Intel-
</p>
<p>lectual Property Organization (WIPO).
</p>
<p> This will break the global connection between intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>and the mechanisms for commercial sanctions between nations that do not fol-
</p>
<p>low World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, including TRIPS. The perverse relation 
</p>
<p>pinheiro </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>625
</p>
<p>embedded in TRIPS is the fact that unequals&mdash;developed nations and developing 
</p>
<p>nations&mdash;are treated as equals. As Aristotle taught many years ago in the Nicoma-
</p>
<p>chean Ethics, injustice arises when unequals are treated equally.
</p>
<p> The flexibility of the criteria for approving patents will also be changed, pro-
</p>
<p>hibiting the approval of patents resulting from the redeployment of already known 
</p>
<p>molecules, patents for second use, patents to combine pharmaceuticals already 
</p>
<p>used individually, patents for polymorphic structures, and so on. These changes 
</p>
<p>will seek to valorize the inventive content of the discovery while understanding 
</p>
<p>that, as the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights has noted, &ldquo;Countries 
</p>
<p>need to ensure that their IP protection regimes do not run counter to their public 
</p>
<p>health policies and that they are consistent with and supportive of such policies.&rdquo;3
</p>
<p> In order to stimulate growth in innovation and technology, it will be necessary 
</p>
<p>to revoke patents for pharmaceutical products, allowing patents only for processes. 
</p>
<p>This will allow new routes of chemical synthesis to arrive at the same product. It will 
</p>
<p>stimulate new technologies and increase competition in the field of medicines.
</p>
<p> To guarantee that the pubic interest prevails over private interests, for all dis-
</p>
<p>eases that are prevalent in developing countries, known as &ldquo;neglected&rdquo; diseases, 
</p>
<p>the developed and developing countries will agree that the property rights of an 
</p>
<p>invention will be acquired by the public partner, the research institution or univer-
</p>
<p>sity, that in fact originated the idea. They will agree that the private entity involved 
</p>
<p>in the public-private partnership will have the right only to a nonexclusive license, 
</p>
<p>which may contain clauses to provide proper rewards for its investment, since the 
</p>
<p>public sector has the regulatory prerogative on the final price of the product. They 
</p>
<p>will agree that the private partner can exploit the protected invention under an 
</p>
<p>exclusive license only for nonpharmaceutical uses, for example, a formulation for 
</p>
<p>veterinary use, that is, for a use other than to treat a life-threatening life disease. 
</p>
<p>And finally, they will agree that it is the public partner that will have the right to 
</p>
<p>produce, import, export, and license the protected invention to produce and com-
</p>
<p>mercialize drugs at low prices.
</p>
<p> Making this scenario a reality will require a range of solutions based on an 
</p>
<p>inclusive, plural vision, without power asymmetries between those who create the 
</p>
<p>model and those who implement it. The UN and the WHO should establish centers 
</p>
<p>of development in the least-developed countries, guaranteeing that during this 
</p>
<p>period of transition, in order to deliver treatment to all those who need it, all stra-
</p>
<p>tegic products under patent that are necessary to attend to great endemic diseases 
</p>
<p>will be developed through the transfer of technology.
</p>
<p> The participation of organized civil society also will be absolutely essen-
</p>
<p>tial in order to strengthen this range of proposals and bring about the transition 
</p>
<p>between models. Public participation and accountability will be needed to consider 
</p>
<p>the future of intellectual property and access to medicine</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>626
</p>
<p>collective rights as well as the relationship between the new model and the differ-
</p>
<p>ent public policies in each state, with an emphasis on social policies.
</p>
<p> This second scenario protects the rights of the inventor and the possibility 
</p>
<p>of recuperating investments, as long as the invention of novel pharmaceuticals 
</p>
<p>involves substantial technical and scientific knowledge. In fact, it bans only what 
</p>
<p>interferes with access to medicines.
</p>
<p> The key point for development is technological knowledge. Modifications in 
</p>
<p>the paradigms that govern the mechanisms of innovation are necessary to stim-
</p>
<p>ulate a favorable environment for technological development in the short term, 
</p>
<p>leading to capacity building for local industry and the strengthening of research 
</p>
<p>institutions that produce new inventions in the medium and long term.

</p>
<p>Under the existing regime of intellectual property rights, we already have options 
</p>
<p>in international and national legal instruments, such as exceptions to copyright 
</p>
<p>and limitations on it, to help improve access to knowledge. Are we exploiting these 
</p>
<p>options to their full potential? And what are the alternatives to the current regime&mdash;
</p>
<p>what new initiatives, tools, and methods to disseminate knowledge are available? 
</p>
<p>This essay explores possible futures by investigating two extreme scenarios in order 
</p>
<p>to pose and answer these important questions: What can we expect in the next ten 
</p>
<p>years in the field of copyright, particularly in developing countries? And how will the 
</p>
<p>inevitable changes affect access to information and in turn education and libraries, 
</p>
<p>especially research and academic libraries, and consequently access to knowledge?
</p>
<p>worst-case scenario, 2018: a stronger, more strict  
intellectual property rights system
</p>
<p>In 2018, terms for the duration of copyright, even in the poorest countries, now 
</p>
<p>frequently last for as long as 100 or even 150 years after a work has been pub-
</p>
<p>lished or released to the public. Some developing countries now have increased the 
</p>
<p>term of copyright protection after signing free-trade agreements with the United 
</p>
<p>States or the European Union. Regional harmonization processes then exported 
</p>
<p>these higher standards to neighboring countries. For example, some Arab countries 
</p>
<p>signed free-trade agreements with the United States during the previous decade. 
</p>
<p>In 2015, Arab intellectual property laws were harmonized. This led to the increase 
</p>
<p>of the term of protection in countries that had a term of life of the author plus 50 
</p>
<p>years to life of the author plus 100 years in all these countries. This has delayed 
</p>
<p>indefinitely the transfer of creative works into the public domain, resulting in the 
</p>
<p>weakest public domain in human history.

</p>
<p> By 2018, the consequences of this policy have become evident in the slow-
</p>
<p>ing rate of innovation and the centralization of creativity in the hands of a few 
</p>
<p>transnational corporations. This can be seen clearly in the fields of pharmaceuti-
</p>
<p>cals, information and communications technologies, and education. The price of 
</p>
<p>medicine has doubled, negatively affecting public health everywhere, with poor 
</p>
<p>countries being the worst affected. Education now has become a luxury, even 
</p>
<p>at the elementary, compulsory level, not to mention at the university level. The 
</p>
<p>high price of subscriptions to e-resources and printed materials has contributed to 
</p>
<p>higher illiteracy rates in the Global South.
</p>
<p> Even unoriginal databases are now fully protected by copyright.1 Software that 
</p>
<p>was once subject only to copyright protection now can be protected internation-
</p>
<p>ally by patent law. The public domain is shrinking, instead of growing and flour-
</p>
<p>ishing, despite the usual claims that the intellectual property system stimulates, 
</p>
<p>rather than constricts the public domain.
</p>
<p> Researchers and students in developing countries now have even less access to 
</p>
<p>journals, books, articles, and new, Internet-based archives than ever before. For 
</p>
<p>example, access to fifty-year-old Arabic scholarly articles in sociology is currently 
</p>
<p>restricted to on-line journal subscribers. Moreover, the cost of e-journal subscrip-
</p>
<p>tions has soared, despite the lower costs of maintenance and distribution of on-line 
</p>
<p>journals compared with those in traditional print media. A very small proportion of 
</p>
<p>the population can afford the subscriptions, and most universities, with their lim-
</p>
<p>ited budgets, now can provide access to very few internationally well-known jour-
</p>
<p>nals. The astronomical costs associated with these subscriptions prohibit access for 
</p>
<p>more than 90 percent of Arabic speakers. Furthermore, local and more specialized 
</p>
<p>publications have either perished or become even more expensive.
</p>
<p> By 2028, these trends have contributed to the decline of higher education in 
</p>
<p>the Arab countries and in the Global South in general. This situation has forced 
</p>
<p>more and more students and researchers to leave their home countries so that they 
</p>
<p>can access the information they need to learn and work in richer countries in the 
</p>
<p>Global North.
</p>
<p> Although some groups of stakeholders have raised concerns about copyright 
</p>
<p>issues, no real attention has ever been paid to building the infrastructure neces-
</p>
<p>sary for access. Means such as financial resources, tools, computer equipment, and 
</p>
<p>Internet connections are scarce, compounding the overprotection characteristic of 
</p>
<p>the current system of copyright restrictions.
</p>
<p> Due to the increasing complexities of the existing system, in 2018, academics, 
</p>
<p>researchers, librarians, content creators, and library patrons have very limited 
</p>
<p>knowledge of copyright issues and of the options the system provides, including 
</p>
<p>exceptions and limitations.2 Because of the political or economic pressures that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>options and alternatives to current copyright regimes and practices 629
</p>
<p>developed countries exercise to prohibit the use of these flexibilities in developing 
</p>
<p>countries, these options have become as useless as if they had never existed. Some 
</p>
<p>vestiges still appear in the texts of laws, but nobody is aware of their existence, 
</p>
<p>and nobody knows how to make use of them.
</p>
<p> In 2018, content creators, users, and intermediary institutions are not aware of 
</p>
<p>the new tools available to disseminate knowledge and as alternatives to facilitate 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge. They are not familiar with the digital equipment needed to 
</p>
<p>access the huge amount of information that has now been made available in digital 
</p>
<p>form in order to promote and sustain development.
</p>
<p> In such a world, where individuals are banned from accessing and enjoying 
</p>
<p>the fruits of knowledge that have been accumulated through decades of human 
</p>
<p>history, what are the options and alternatives? Either to suffer from illiteracy and 
</p>
<p>poverty in a backward, unhealthy society or to seek ways to flee to a richer coun-
</p>
<p>try. However, even with the regulations and policies current in the first decade 
</p>
<p>of the twenty-first century, a citizen from a poor country could wait more than a 
</p>
<p>year to be granted a visa to access a European or U.S. territory. By 2018, all these

</p>
<p>regulations have worsened the problems of illegal immigration, terrorism, and 
</p>
<p>security, fostering increasingly fanatic ideologies. In 2018, the world is still not safe 
</p>
<p>or fair. All suffer.
</p>
<p>best-case scenario, 2018: copyright in an open-access world
</p>
<p>By 2018, the unjustifiably long term of protection of copyright has led to question-
</p>
<p>ing of whether the circumstances within which the Berne Convention, which was 
</p>
<p>signed more than 120 years ago, are still valid today. A general consensus emerged 
</p>
<p>that at the levels that prevailed at the turn of the twenty-first century, protection 
</p>
<p>was in effect perpetual, if we consider the duration of protection and the aver-
</p>
<p>age lifetime of a person. Most people would never have seen the majority of the 
</p>
<p>works produced during their lifetime transferred to the public domain. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>the copyright term was reexamined in the World Intellectual Property Organization 
</p>
<p>(WIPO), which influenced World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations later, and 
</p>
<p>thanks to the intensive work of NGOs, experts, and academics, both developed and 
</p>
<p>developing countries agreed to reach a win-win solution using determinants to these 
</p>
<p>terms other than author&rsquo;s life.
</p>
<p> Some countries chose to protect the work for twenty years from the date of 
</p>
<p>making the work available to the public, while others chose a more sophisticated 
</p>
<p>system that now allows monitoring the yearly revenues of the work. So when 
</p>
<p>those revenues are below a certain amount for two years, the work falls into 
</p>
<p>the public domain. Many countries also now have more than one determinant, 
</p>
<p>depending on the nature of the protected work. The new terms give a real incen-
</p>
<p>tive to the author and give a chance for those who invest in the copyrighted mate-
</p>
<p>rials to generate reasonable profits within a reasonable period from the time of 
</p>
<p>making the work available to the public.
</p>
<p> Moreover, by 2018, several initiatives have been launched to compile, docu-
</p>
<p>ment, and classify materials in the public domain in order to make them more 
</p>
<p>accessible to as many people as possible. Systems have been developed to follow 
</p>
<p>up on copyright terms and to produce freely accessible lists of works that fall into 
</p>
<p>the public domain. Some of these systems also take into consideration that some 
</p>
<p>works that may still be under protection in a country with a longer term of pro-
</p>
<p>tection may already be in the public domain in a country with a shorter term of 
</p>
<p>protection. In other words, proposals for the global harmonization of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property laws that assume that one size fits all have failed.
</p>
<p> By 2018, positive steps have been taken to use and activate the options already 
</p>
<p>available in all the international instruments and national laws as exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations to copyright, in order to facilitate the acquisition and utilization of 
</p>
<p>essalmawi </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>631
</p>
<p>protected materials. The real breakthrough was in finalizing the international 
</p>
<p>treaty for exceptions and limitations that had been negotiated and discussed for 
</p>
<p>over a decade. By 2018, several other alternative tools and methods to disseminate 
</p>
<p>knowledge, such as free and open-source software, the GNU Free Documentation 
</p>
<p>License, and Creative Commons licenses, have attained considerable success as tech-
</p>
<p>nical and legal parallel substitutes for classically copyrighted materials and older  
</p>
<p>copyright acts.
</p>
<p> By 2018, higher awareness among stakeholders of users, creators, academics, 
</p>
<p>researchers, officials, public-policy makers, and intermediary institutions working 
</p>
<p>to make information available has altered the structure of copyright regimes and 
</p>
<p>the approaches taken by these groups to balance the benefits that go to creative 
</p>
<p>authors and those that society can claim. After long discussions and many strug-
</p>
<p>gles, free and open access to publicly funded research results has been guaranteed 
</p>
<p>shortly after their publication. This milestone has been praised by the coalition of 
</p>
<p>researchers, users, and libraries that has long called for such a step.
</p>
<p> By 2018, governments have understood that they will boost innovation and 
</p>
<p>get a better return on their investments in publicly funded research if they made 
</p>
<p>research findings more widely available. Consequently, many countries, including 
</p>
<p>developing ones, have adopted policies to promote and support the archiving of 
</p>
<p>publications in open-access repositories after five years of publication. National 
</p>
<p>and academic libraries now implement and manage these repositories. Evidence 
</p>
<p>indicates that open access to research findings brings economic advantages across 
</p>
<p>the world. It increases the potential benefits resulting from research and promotes 
</p>
<p>scholarship in Global North and South.
</p>
<p> The momentum is real, and figures show that in 2018, 40 percent of scholarly 
</p>
<p>journals are now released under an open-access license, while free and open-
</p>
<p>source software now constitutes around 50 percent of all software in operation.
</p>
<p> It is worth mentioning that these radical changes have not completely dimin-
</p>
<p>ished earlier intellectual property rights systems. The intention of these devel-
</p>
<p>opments was to modify previous systems to recognize and activate all possible 
</p>
<p>solutions in favor of education, access to knowledge, and freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression as essential human rights under the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, Articles 19, 26, and 27 of 1948.3 From what can be seen today, in 2018, this 
</p>
<p>goal has been largely achieved. This has also been done with ample space and tol-
</p>
<p>erance for possible parallel alternatives to develop and flourish as complementary 
</p>
<p>to, not superseding the previous systems.
</p>
<p> These are two imaginary scenarios. They represent a personal vision. However, 
</p>
<p>if all stakeholders do not move now to change the current situation of the intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property rights regime and practices by activating available options and 
</p>
<p>options and alternatives to current copyright regimes and practices</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>632
</p>
<p>developing new alternatives, we will be living the worst-case scenario&mdash;or in a 
</p>
<p>reality that is even worse.
</p>
<p> notes
</p>
<p>1 Originality is a prerequisite for copyright. The criterion of originality is satisfied if the work 
</p>
<p>in question is the work of the author and not a copy of another&rsquo;s work. The level of skill 
</p>
<p>and labor required to satisfy the requirement of originality is generally satisfied provided 
</p>
<p>that the creation of the work is not a purely mechanical exercise. The classic example of an 
</p>
<p>unoriginal database is a telephone directory that is organized in alphabetical order.
</p>
<p>2 Exceptions and limitations to copyright involve certain situations in which the exclusive 
</p>
<p>rights granted to copyright holder by law do not apply.

<p>Dionysus . . . decided to reward Midas for his hospitality and granted him one wish. 
</p>
<p>Midas wished that everything he touched be turned to gold. Dionysus warned him 
</p>
<p>about the dangers of such a wish, but Midas was too distracted with the prospect of 
</p>
<p>being surrounded by gold to listen. Dionysus gave him the gift. Initially, King Midas 
</p>
<p>was thrilled with his new gift and turned everything he could to gold, including his 
</p>
<p>beloved roses. His attitude changed, however, when he was unable to eat or drink 
</p>
<p>since his food and wine were also changed to unappetizing gold. He even acciden-
</p>
<p>tally killed his daughter when he touched her, and this truly made him realize the 
</p>
<p>depth of his mistake.
</p>
<p>&mdash;Anna Baldwin, s.v. &ldquo;Midas,&rdquo; Encyclopedia Mythica
</p>
<p>The best and the worst scenarios of access to knowledge can be seen today in two 
</p>
<p>opposite trends. In the genetic field, islands of proprietary genetic material are 
</p>
<p>growing amid a sea of free and open-access biodiversity, while in the information 
</p>
<p>field, islands of free and open-access initiatives are growing amid a sea of propri-
</p>
<p>etary resources.
</p>
<p>the privatization of genes
</p>
<p>In agriculture and genomics, a race to patent and thereby privately own genes contin-
</p>
<p>ues unabated. According to a 2005 study, one-fifth of the human genome has already 
</p>
<p>been patented. Patents are exclusionary devices and are therefore a form of private 
</p>
<p>monopoly, in effect turning genes into private property. Genes are a natural monop-
</p>
<p>oly. As Robert Cook-Deegan, the director of Duke University&rsquo;s Center for Genome 
</p>
<p>Ethics, Law and Policy says, &ldquo;You can find dozens of ways to heat a room besides the 
</p>
<p>Franklin stove, but there&rsquo;s only one gene to make human growth hormone.&rdquo;1

</p>
<p> The privatization of genes is, of course, a prelude to commodification. Com-
</p>
<p>modified goods&mdash;or bads, for that matter, such as carbon credits representing a 
</p>
<p>right to pollute&mdash;then become subject to market mechanisms and forces. If there is 
</p>
<p>carbon trading, can DNA trading be far behind? If we can have commodity futures, 
</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t we have derivatives such as carbon futures or DNA futures?
</p>
<p> Commodification is an all-consuming trend in economics. Commodifica-
</p>
<p>tion respects none and targets all: land, culture, knowledge, information, human 
</p>
<p>beings, water, air,  nature, life, genes, relationships&mdash;truly anything and every-
</p>
<p>thing. Driven by corporate profit seeking and gain maximization, commodification 
</p>
<p>knows no end, no limits.
</p>
<p> Like King Midas, today&rsquo;s corporations and other gain maximizers turn every-
</p>
<p>thing they touch into commodities and, subsequently, into money. Wherever they 
</p>
<p>look, whatever they look at, they see a dollar sign. If we followed their lead or 
</p>
<p>allowed them to continue, our entire world and everything in it as well as outside 
</p>
<p>it would sooner or later be for sale or for rent. Then we would end up like the cynic 
</p>
<p>who &ldquo;knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>the free and open-source trend
</p>
<p>There is, fortunately, an opposite trend. Ideas about information freedom and shar-
</p>
<p>ing have percolated for some time. They are called by different names, represent-
</p>
<p>ing subtle differences in attitudes, perspectives, and approaches toward access to 
</p>
<p>information and knowledge. The earliest were ideas about the public domain and 
</p>
<p>the commons. But as everything turned digital, accelerating the commodification of 
</p>
<p>information, these early ideas were apparently insufficiently developed to deal with 
</p>
<p>the rapidly changing nature of information. For instance, when software was simply 
</p>
<p>released to the public domain, commercial interests were better positioned to take 
</p>
<p>full advantage and incorporate it into their products. Also, object code (in contrast 
</p>
<p>to source code) in the public domain remained largely inaccessible for modification. 
</p>
<p>Thus, while many software utilities and simple programs were distributed as pub-
</p>
<p>lic domain or &ldquo;freeware,&rdquo; no major software projects were. New approaches were 
</p>
<p>also tried that relied on a license based on existing intellectual property concepts. 
</p>
<p>These included the &ldquo;shareware&rdquo; license, the GNU Public License, the BSD License, 
</p>
<p>and their variations. Out of the latter two emerged truly huge software projects 
</p>
<p>such as the Linux kernel, the GNU systems-and-utilities package, the BSD operating 
</p>
<p>system, software application suites such as OpenOffice, and similar software.
</p>
<p> The idea of free and open sharing caught on and extended to other fields. 
</p>
<p>The Creative Commons license extended this idea to other literary and artistic 
</p>
<p>works. The Wikipedia represented another huge effort to accumulate and share  </p>
<p/>

<p>the golden touch and the miracle of the loaves 635
</p>
<p>human knowledge in a completely nonproprietary way.
</p>
<p> This new social movement might be called the &ldquo;free and open-source informa-
</p>
<p>tion movement.&rdquo; It is now being embraced in other fields and promises to become 
</p>
<p>the guiding principle for access to knowledge. In the academic community, free 
</p>
<p>and open on-line journals are now emerging in the spirit of this movement, chal-
</p>
<p>lenging the entrenched publishers of printed academic journals.
</p>
<p> In the future, this movement may merge with other &ldquo;free&rdquo; and &ldquo;open&rdquo; move-
</p>
<p>ments. In the educational field, a &ldquo;free&rdquo; schools movement&mdash;&ldquo;free as in freedom&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>
<p>has been simmering for some time, following the pioneering works of educators 
</p>
<p>Maria Montessori in Italy, A. S. Neill of Summerhill fame in England, and John Holt 
</p>
<p>in the United States. Among the ideas that contributed to the intellectual ferment 
</p>
<p>and the eventual peaceful uprising of the East Europeans was the &ldquo;open&rdquo; society 
</p>
<p>concept given impetus by George Soros. The free exchange and sharing of seeds is a 
</p>
<p>freedom that farmers will defend with their lives. If a convergence happens, a truly 
</p>
<p>historic shift in mindset can occur, promising a freer and more open world.
</p>
<p> We have to divide bread to share it, but sharing knowledge multiplies it. 
</p>
<p>Because knowledge is literally food for the mind, the movement to ensure free and 
</p>
<p>open access to information and knowledge will turn into reality the parable in this 
</p>
<p>Biblical story:
</p>
<p>In those days when there again was a great crowd without anything to eat, he sum-
</p>
<p>moned the disciples and said, &ldquo;My heart is moved with pity for the crowd, because 
</p>
<p>they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. If I send them 
</p>
<p>away hungry to their homes, they will collapse on the way, and some of them have 
</p>
<p>come a great distance.&rdquo; His disciples answered him, &ldquo;Where can anyone get enough 
</p>
<p>bread to satisfy them here in this deserted place?&rdquo; Still he asked them, &ldquo;How many 
</p>
<p>loaves do you have?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; they replied. He ordered the crowd to sit down on 
</p>
<p>the ground. Then, taking the seven loaves he gave thanks, broke them, and gave 
</p>
<p>them to his disciples to distribute, and they distributed them to the crowd. They also 
</p>
<p>had a few fish. He said the blessing over them and ordered them distributed also. 
</p>
<p>They ate and were satisfied. They picked up the fragments left over&mdash;seven baskets. 
</p>
<p>There were about four thousand people.2
</p>
<p> If we join the commodification race, we will all acquire the golden touch. If we 
</p>
<p>adopt the free and open sharing perspective, the knowledge of some can miracu-
</p>
<p>lously feed all. The golden touch or the miracle of the loaves? Whichever road we 
</p>
<p>take will determine whether we will enter a neofeudal period ruled by information 
</p>
<p>and genetic rentiers as they increasingly privatize human knowledge and genetic 
</p>
<p>material or a new flowering of human culture, thanks to free exchange of ideas, 
</p>
<p>information, and knowledge.</p>
