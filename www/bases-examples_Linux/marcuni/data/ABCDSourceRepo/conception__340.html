<p>Of the Origins of the Contract
</p>
<p>1.1.1 The contraction out of nothing that was said to be the 
first origination of the universe continues to express its 
irreducible commitments.
</p>
<p>1.1.2 Even if conceived of as afforded by &ldquo;the death of an-
cient stars&rdquo; is such reducible to having been contract-
ed.
</p>
<p>1.1.3 That the contract had been founded in the origin of 
sunlight as perceptively discovered, whereby that 
which was invasively without became a source of inner 
meaning &mdash; with a concomitant gas to be contracted by 
a later age as &ldquo;atmosphere to live in&rdquo; &mdash; is a fundamen-
tal term that leads to vision. As provisional such term 
will be shown void in light of any later outcome.
</p>
<p>1.1.4 The distance of first vision was a qualitative change 
that led to reason.
</p>
<p>1.1.5 Thus the fictional first cause gave rise to reason &mdash; not 
what reason would contend with.</p>

</p>
<p>1.2.1 The origins of the contract are internal to the contract.
</p>
<p>1.2.2 The awareness of the contract is the origin of man.
</p>
<p>1.2.3 That &ldquo;the universe is founded on the contract&rdquo; is a sec-
ondary term that could be understood to signify in 
countless other ways than that first-given.
</p>
<p>1.2.4 The beginning is impossible to think of but as cause for 
termination.
</p>
<p>1.2.5 Even if the contract is believed to be a product of that 
past that it enabled such is relevant to future under-
standing.
</p>
<p>1.2.6 The universe is brought to light by finance.
</p>
<p>1.2.7 The only obligation is to name.</p>

</p>
<p>of the origins of the contract
</p>
<p>1.3.1 &ldquo;The possession of the earth by means of naming, in 
exchange for an impossible transgression of the na-
ture of the same,&rdquo; was an inadequate conception of the 
contract. It would signify however, to a consciousness 
of redetermination, an obligatory stage that could not 
signify as such to its own subject. It would come to be 
rephrased as &ldquo;The renouncement of the world received 
transcends the prohibition,&rdquo; whereby death became a 
process to adhere to.
</p>
<p>1.3.2 It was not so much the eating of the fruit that gave 
them knowledge of the difference, but by having been 
expelled from perfect ease to the uncertainty without 
whereby they came to understand that they could nev-
er break their law. Thus &ldquo;the knowledge of good and 
evil&rdquo; was a superficial sign of an enduring prohibition. 
Which did not preclude the thought that it be lifted 
from without: as adhered to in the work of prepara-
tion, the forbidding was named &ldquo;faith&rdquo; by those that 
followed.
</p>
<p>1.3.3 The expulsion from that space in which all things had 
been received in certain safety, and obediently nur-
tured by the name that each was given, as it came in 
time to light, by prohibition; was effected by the name 
the same was given and adhered to, as the image of a 
whole that could not substitute the life that had pro-
duced it.
</p>
<p>1.3.4 Perhaps the same was a conception that fell short be-
cause dependent on an interval of climate.
</p>
<p>1.3.5 It was what Adam was incapable of naming that occa-
sioned his original default, which resulted in a second-
ary contract to adhere to. Only later was the prospect 
of such breach to be conceived of as a positive event to 
be prepared for.</p>

</p>
<p>1.4.1 A term of comprehension that facilitates the world to 
come is only an approach that somehow signifies a fu-
ture understanding. An initial understanding merely 
constitutes the need to pass away.
</p>
<p>1.4.2 The expression of a fundamental term perceived the 
rainbow.
</p>
<p>1.4.3 The significance of such exceeds the limited awareness 
it produces.</p>

</p>
<p>1.5.1 A term that only signifies the need for the acceptance 
of another term as yet to be decided may be presently 
observed by letting go.

<p>1.5.2 Allow for the fulfilment of the contract.</p>

</p>
<p>Definitions
</p>
<p>2.1.1 The acceptance of a term is an awareness of the con-
tract as renewed in the return to the beginning.
</p>
<p>2.1.2 Liability implied by that initial understanding is a uni-
versal term-to-be-decided.
</p>
<p>2.1.3 Thus prohibited from knowledge of the world to come, 
the only obligation is to name.
</p>
<p>2.1.4 That the contract came to be cannot be reasoned.

</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>2.2.1 Everything is owing to the contract.
</p>
<p>2.2.2 The essential operation of the contract has defined it-
self as funding.
</p>
<p>2.2.3 For the most part will the contract be assumed without 
awareness of its fundamental role in the unfolding of 
the universe in which there be perception. That it can-
not be a part of this unfolding to observe is what allows 
it to be taken thus for granted.
</p>
<p>2.2.4 Notwithstanding the awareness of the contract is the 
essence of mankind.
</p>
<p>2.2.5 The contract as discovered as the contract is the basis 
of the human thus contracted.
</p>
<p>2.2.6 To speculate on that to which the contract be rela-
tion &mdash; that it be between a &ldquo;god&rdquo; and any &ldquo;human,&rdquo; 
for example &mdash; is to make of this an object that takes 
place among the countlessly diverse specifications of 
the contract, as another mere example of contraction.
</p>
<p>2.2.7 That to which the contract be relation disassociates 
from every speculation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23
</p>
<p>definitions
</p>
<p>2.3.1 A term is a conception of the contract.
</p>
<p>2.3.2 A term is not the cause of all that follows, but allows 
that cause to be.
</p>
<p>2.3.3 A conception of the contract is enabled by the con-
tract.
</p>
<p>2.3.4 Its conception is not knowledge of the contract, but ac-
ceptance of the need for its ulterior fulfilment.
</p>
<p>2.3.5 A conception of the contract is internal to the contract, 
and so cannot be assumed as more than merely an ex-
ample of its funding operation. An example nonethe-
less that would be relevant to every thing contracted in 
the future.
</p>
<p>2.3.6 A term is an example of the contract; or a clause that 
may refer to a specific obligation; or a period of time.
</p>
<p>2.3.7 The contract is a term for that which constitutes the 
contract.
</p>
<p>2.3.8 Beyond this simple act of constitution, its significance 
is void.
</p>
<p>2.3.9 A term that would initiate the contract has no lasting 
application whatsoever.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>2.4.1 Every instance of the contract is the contract as a 
whole. The attention must be undivided always.
</p>
<p>2.4.2 An imperative to concentrate derives from the unique-
ness of each vision. There is no determination that may 
equally apply to all or anything that follows.
</p>
<p>2.4.3 Independently of any other term a term will constitute 
the contract.
</p>
<p>2.4.4 Every term is as the contract, of the contract, and to-
wards another contract.
</p>
<p>2.4.5 That a term be an expression of the contract irrespec-
tive of those past explains their intercontradiction.
</p>
<p>2.4.6 Between the terms may be no obvious connection that 
would constitute the essence of the contract. This may 
never be consistently derived from the conjunction of 
the terms that have already been accepted &mdash; even if 
those terms could be presented in the manner of ob-
jective recognition, which they certainly cannot.
</p>
<p>2.4.7 A term is a fulfilment of the contract, and a sign of its 
eventual fulfilment.</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>25
</p>
<p>definitions
</p>
<p>2.5.1 The contract is not fixed for once and all, but must be 
redefined, or reaccepted, in the wake of every instance.
</p>
<p>2.5.2 It is not to terms already of the contract that would 
have to be adhered, but to ongoing termination.
</p>
<p>2.5.3 Only by continuing acceptance of the terms may the 
agreement be adhered to. Definitions of a stationary 
contract are unable to account for what they cannot 
take account of. Their persistence is the basis of illu-
sion, and illusion could prove deadly.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>2.5.4 The conception of the contract as a process of contrac-
tion &mdash; not as this or that contracted &mdash; is an unfulfilled 
acceptance of the contract. An awareness of the con-
tract is awareness of the need to let such go. Its concep-
tion is ongoing.
</p>
<p>2.5.5 Adherence to the contract is the redetermination of 
the sense to be adhered to, in the sense that this adher-
ence must be learnt each time anew.
</p>
<p>2.5.6 Thus the signing of the contract is the always uninten-
tional acceptance of the sense of an agreement to re-
new in terms of endless resignation.
</p>
<p>2.5.7 The signing of the contract is the tentative acceptance 
of what cannot be conceived by such an instance.
</p>
<p>2.5.8 Thus to sign is to renounce the world as given by the 
contract.</p>

<p>2.6.1 The contract was accepted in the darkness of the womb.
</p>
<p>2.6.2 The conception of the terms, and so the entrance into 
life, cannot be chosen by that life itself elected.
</p>
<p>2.6.3 Live according to the terms.
</p>
<p>2.6.4 An explicit formulation of the contract is a fact of that 
which cannot be returned to.
</p>
<p>2.6.5 A conscience stands in witness to the contract.
</p>
<p>2.6.6 The inherent incompletion of the contract is an open-
ness to other kinds of meaning.
</p>
<p>2.6.7 The capacity to live from day to day will be dependent 
on an openness to other obligations. Funding may not 
ever be procured for once and all, but must be end-
lessly entreated.
</p>
<p>2.6.8 The slow specification of the contract is the differentia-
tion of concerns as they concern.
</p>
<p>2.6.9 The contract must be kept in every moment. This im-
perative derives from the particular import of every 
moment, and the incomparability of any situation.
</p>
<p>2.6.10 Survival is a process of adherence to the contract.
</p>
<p>2.6.11 The ability to keep the terms is given by the terms.
</p>
<p>2.6.12 Keep not to terms, but termination.</p>

<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>2.7.1 Adhere not to an image of the contract, nor of anything 
besides that presupposes the existence of the contract, 
but the contract of itself, as an imperative that brings 
the world to light in an ongoing self-fulfilment.
</p>
<p>2.7.2 The contract is not specified by absolute conditions to 
adhere to, but adaptable provisions to enable.
</p>
<p>2.7.3 To keep the contract one must learn to learn at every 
single turn.
</p>
<p>2.7.4 Every term is a fulfilment of the contract.</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>2.8.1 An adherence to the contract is the swearing of an oath 
not to adhere to this or that.
</p>
<p>2.8.2 To swear is to fulfil an obligation formed already by the 
contract.
</p>
<p>2.8.3 The acceptance of the contract is in heed to its forbid-
ding to begin with. For the matter this would signify 
is yet to be decided. The obedience to terms is their 
acceptance.
</p>
<p>2.8.4 The decisions are not chosen, but accepted as they 
come. A difficult decision is of relevance to failure to 
perceive, and not a conflict of positions.
</p>
<p>2.8.5 The contract is a process of contraction (to adhere to).
</p>
<p>2.8.6 Irreversible contraction of the terms is the perfor-
mance of the contract.</p>

<p>2.9.1 The contract would provide for any outcome.
</p>
<p>2.9.2 The capacity to meet the unexpected is provided by the 
terms.
</p>
<p>2.9.3 The worth of the provisions is impossible to measure 
by whatever other means than realisation.
</p>
<p>2.9.4 No thing may appear without the contract, which is 
not itself a thing to be considered. That implied in the 
perception of whatever is could never be perceived as 
such directly.
</p>
<p>2.9.5 The acceptance of the terms allows for any thing to be.
</p>
<p>2.9.6 That to which the contract has brought access must be 
seen as something borrowed. A definitive account of 
all that is cannot be given.
</p>
<p>2.9.7 A difficulty keeping the agreement may derive from 
the persistency of vision.
</p>
<p>2.9.8 The present application of the terms will be an obstacle 
to future implications.
</p>
<p>2.9.9 Functionality of terms preserves their structure, in 
which every one makes sense, or has a meaning; but 
significance is lost to such a structure.
</p>
<p>2.9.10 The polysemous nature of the terms enables coverage.
</p>
<p>2.9.11 The significance of such a clause will have to be de-
cided. For the time that is its information functions.</p>

</p>
<p>2.10.1 The contract is perceivable by means of its contingent 
applications, but in no such seen directly. The concep-
tion of an absolute totality of means is an invalid ap-
plication of the contract.
</p>
<p>2.10.2 The agreement may be kept as long as active. Only by 
continued demonstration of specific obligations may 
the contract be adhered to.
</p>
<p>2.10.3 The particulars are void &mdash; and the investment must 
continue.
</p>
<p>2.10.4 The lapse of the agreement is to understand as need for 
further funding.

<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>2.11.1 There is no reason for the contract, in the sense that 
it be taken to achieve a given aim. The sole condition 
for whatever aim or purpose is the contract. These are 
consequent to such, and not its reason.
</p>
<p>2.11.2 One is not to presuppose a space of possible occur-
rence, but prepare for unforeseen considerations.
</p>
<p>2.11.3 Understanding of the contract as the source of all that 
is in terms of funding is not knowledge of what can or 
not be funded.
</p>
<p>2.11.4 The terms provide for no specific outcome, but for 
&ldquo;any thing to come.&rdquo; They are provisional in such that 
they allow one to respond to the interminate unknown 
that would invalidate their temporary structure.

<p>2.11.5 Accept the need to alter.</p>

<p>definitions
</p>
<p>2.12.1 Awareness is both consequence and keeping of the 
contract.
</p>
<p>2.12.2 The awareness becomes consciousness when taken 
from the drafting of the contract. As detached from the 
condition of the term it corresponds to the extension 
of an instance of default.
</p>
<p>2.12.3 Incorporation of a fundamental term is a formation of 
the self.
</p>
<p>2.12.4 The signing of the contract is no choice that may be 
taken or discarded. There has never been an option.
</p>
<p>2.12.5 A term is that which frees the self from failure to per-
ceive.
</p>
<p>2.12.6 The acceptance of a term is an expression of consent to 
keep accepting the expression of the terms.</p>

</p>
<p>2.13.1 As considered independent of its own determinations 
will the contract be accepted as the promise of another 
kind to come. The contraction of a term, which as a 
deeper understanding would initiate that other kind of 
contract, will not satisfy the need for its ulterior fulfil-
ment.
</p>
<p>2.13.2 The implication of another kind of contract in the 
presence of some thing before unseen would be the 
only guarantee that such be certain.
</p>
<p>2.13.3 The signing of the contract is what certifies the pres-
ence of all things.
</p>
<p>2.13.4 The contractions are internal to the contract, whereby 
that which was without an understanding may be sud-
denly brought forth by an internal alteration of the 
contract.
</p>
<p>2.13.5 A term is less important than the contract it deter-
mines. The necessity for such could have resulted in 
innumerable such terms &mdash; or at least it would appear 
from a perspective that seems destined to have hap-
pened.
</p>
<p>2.13.6 That when looking back a term appears an unavoidable 
resultant is a given point of view that cannot lay aside 
its late determination.
</p>
<p>2.13.7 Only in the predisposed contingency of hindsight may 
one contract seem implied within one former.
</p>
<p>2.13.8 That that past that would appear as antecedent to the 
term that has enabled its appearance as a cause will 
also signify an undecided future.</p>

<p>Of Interpretation
</p>
<p>3.1.1 A superficial reading of the contract may induce one to 
conceive it as the predetermination of a world where 
every possible response to every possible occurrence 
be implied in its original conception. But between the 
lines that constitute this world draws an immense ac-
countability to realise.
</p>
<p>3.1.2 Accountability is founded in the fact that the condi-
tions are susceptible to renegotiation.
</p>
<p>3.1.3 The function of a term may differentiate according to 
the context.
</p>
<p>3.1.4 The terms themselves are open to alternative concep-
tions, where an unexpected context may disclose an 
unintended second meaning. This however would sup-
pose that they equate to formulations that are written 
to refer to, when in fact they are unique approxima-
tions that may never be repeated. The words are inter-
changeable, and alter what they mean as they attach 
themselves to singular contractions &mdash; the significance 
of which must be decided. (Terminology)
</p>
<p>3.1.5 The lacunae may facilitate renewed interpretation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>3.2.1 The terms may represent a certain world to those that 
contemplate their subject; but to others they may sig-
nify another world to come.
</p>
<p>3.2.2 An obstinate construction of the text extends the inter-
est to reinforce the difference to pay.
</p>
<p>3.2.3 Strict adherence to the terms as understood in the ap-
pearance of the world one has to live in, and the sub-
sequent possession of the image of the same is an ob-
struction to the world to which they signal.
</p>
<p>3.2.4 The significance of this or that expression of the world 
would be alternative expression. As human substitu-
tion for what cannot be perceived by any means that 
are provided, what it signifies would have to be another 
substitution for whatever that may mean. Such expres-
sion is subjunctive, in the sense that it would signify &ldquo;if 
only.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>3.2.5 The terms of everything must signify themselves in 
terms of everything.</p>
<p/>

<p>39
</p>
<p>of interpretation
</p>
<p>3.3.1 There is a certain closure of the terms in the persistence 
of the world one has to live in. Their significance &mdash; and 
not their present function &mdash; is of worlds that are to 
come.
</p>
<p>3.3.2 A clause defines a world in which each term performs a 
function. The perception that results from this in prin-
ciple may endlessly extend; but its constancy depends 
upon an ignorance that cannot be as endlessly main-
tained.
</p>
<p>3.3.3 A clause consists of statements such as &ldquo;because this, 
then that,&rdquo; within a self-sustaining cycle of conclusion. 
Reproducing the appearance of a world that is main-
tained by such to live in, this interior is closed to what 
it cannot take account of. It may come to be disproved, 
or grafted into.

<p>3.3.4 Through the maintenance of life that life is threatened.

ondary function to facilitate survival.</p>

<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>3.4.1 There is a text behind each vision of &ldquo;the cosmos.&rdquo; In-
terpretation redetermines the capacity to see, and so to 
prosper.
</p>
<p>3.4.2 The text is not to read as a definitive instruction, but an 
open sensibility to meaning.
</p>
<p>3.4.3 The covenant with Abraham had no specification to 
depend on, but was pertinent to all that he could pon-
der. The significance of stars was of the one that was 
impossible to realise. Notwithstanding this they sym-
bolised a promise, that the covenant would open to 
such numbers.
</p>
<p>3.4.4 As impossible to specify the covenant was taken as a 
covenant of faith, not strict adherence.
</p>
<p>3.4.5 The polysemous nature of the stars is of the darkness.</p>

<p>of interpretation
</p>
<p>3.5.1 The contract is interpreted by that which is without an 
understanding.
</p>
<p>3.5.2 That which is without an understanding would inter-
pret such a term as would produce it.
</p>
<p>3.5.3 That which would interpret would appear as some-
thing given to return to.
</p>
<p>3.5.4 An interpretation of the document would generate its 
object &mdash; like a line that would interpret.
</p>
<p>3.5.5 Every new interpretation re-establishes the text to re-
interpret.
</p>
<p>3.5.6 A sentence would decide between two contracts.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>3.6.1 Specification is a process of interior fulfilment of the 
contract. This fulfilment is not consequent to terms-to-
be-fulfilled, but the necessity for terms-to-be-contract-
ed. The perceptions that result from these are tempo-
rary claims to be abandoned.
</p>
<p>3.6.2 The inherent incompletion of the contract is not such 
that it be qualified according or compared to a con-
ceivable completion, which needs only to be filled; but 
means that any such completion has no meaning.
</p>
<p>3.6.3 The incompletion of the contract is an opening for 
grace.
</p>
<p>3.6.4 Any new interpretation is the singular contraction of a 
secondary term that will necessitate renewed interpre-
tation. Such a term will be implied within the structure 
of the text it has made sense of. Every new interpreta-
tion opens unforeseen potential to interpret.
</p>
<p>3.6.5 Interpretation needs interpretation.</p>

</p>
<p>of interpretation
</p>
<p>3.7.1 An interpretation of the text cannot define what was 
accepted as &ldquo;the contract&rdquo; in the past, but its accept-
ance for the present.
</p>
<p>3.7.2 The performance of the contract is not limited to this 
or that objective to arrive at, and may have no final 
aim. The &ldquo;unlimited performance&rdquo; is a term that will 
refer to its own reinterpretation.
</p>
<p>3.7.3 The diverse interpretations are not true for every in-
stance, but are true in every instance.
</p>
<p>3.7.4 The contracts of the past have been implied in the 
awareness of the present.</p>

<p>3.8.2 The contract is renewed in the return to the beginning. 
Which beginning has no end, but an ongoing termina-
tion.

<p>3.8.3 The need to learn to read is exponential.</p>

<p>Consideration
</p>
<p>4.1.1 The contract is received as an unlimited capacity to 
fund or to determine.
</p>
<p>4.1.2 Consideration is provisionally defined as without lim-
it, but conditional to terms received as needed.
</p>
<p>4.1.3 Consideration is &ldquo;unlimited resources to depend on,&rdquo; 
but could also be conceived as an &ldquo;unlimited liability 
to realise.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>4.1.4 Funding is received in terms of unforeseen commit-
ments.
</p>
<p>4.1.5 The &ldquo;unlimited resources&rdquo; that are not to be received as 
ready means to be invested, but accepted in the form 
of obligations to adhere to, are translated as &ldquo;unlimited 
endebtment.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>4.1.6 &ldquo;Unlimited liability&rdquo; is defined as liability that cannot 
be defined without increasing.</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>4.2.1 The wealth that would be given by fulfilment of the 
terms cannot be measured in advance of such fulfil-
ment.
</p>
<p>4.2.2 Such a resource is impossible to number. It may only 
be defined by its ongoing operation. Definition of this 
kind can have no end &mdash; but it goes on, and must go on.
</p>
<p>4.2.3 The contract has provisions not for that which might 
occur, but that which happens.
</p>
<p>4.2.4 As the signs of future wealth, the provisions would en-
able the reception of what cannot be predicted.
</p>
<p>4.2.5 The provisions are prescribed with no intention for the 
future, but are open to extreme interpretations.
</p>
<p>4.2.6 &ldquo;What realities may come&rdquo; can be no matter of concern 
until they happen. The provisions only intimate an ul-
timate response to what they cannot take account of.
</p>
<p>4.2.7 A provision would facilitate the unforeseen perception 
of the future. As a vision that precedes its own signifi-
cance is blindness.</p>

<p>4.3.1 The contractual resources are the flexible provisions 
that allow to come to terms with that which threatens 
to disrupt their present order.
</p>
<p>4.3.2 Where the threat grows draws relief.
</p>
<p>4.3.3 A fund would be available as needed.
</p>
<p>4.3.4 The funding is attained by definition of the contract.
</p>
<p>4.3.5 There can be no world to count on &mdash; only an unlimited 
liability to realise.
</p>
<p>4.3.6 The unlimited liability invalidates all previous engage-
ments to allow for the fulfilment of the nearest obliga-
tion.
</p>
<p>4.3.7 A term defines a space to be decided. This can only 
be received as the unlimited liability that signifies the 
need to be attentive.
</p>
<p>4.3.8 The space that has been opened by the signing of the 
contract is not given as a predetermined set of defi-
nitions or co-ordinates or properties, but infinitely 
opens.
</p>
<p>4.3.9 The unlimited liability implied in the awareness of the 
contract is defined by every instance.</p>

<p>4.4.1 The unlimited liability may be realised by uncountable 
contingent obligations.

<p>4.4.2 An obligation is to let such be.
</p>
<p>4.4.3 Every obligation is a singular exception to the world 
that went before it.
</p>
<p>4.4.4 Every good is to receive as a specific obligation, which 
is not to be retained as such to dwell on.
</p>
<p>4.4.5 Obligation signifies not otherwise than this or that re-
ceived consideration.

<p>4.5.3 The imperative to sign is irreducible to any one com-
mitment; for the pressure to repay is universal.
</p>
<p>4.5.4 Obligations are the means with which to meet the need 
to pay.
</p>
<p>4.5.5 The operation of the contract draws new figures to dis-

<p>4.6.1 Consideration is not something to assume, but rather

</p>
<p>4.6.3 Consideration is invested as a means to keep the con-
tract, and let go.
</p>
<p>4.6.4 Considerations serve as a reflection of the contract, 
which as nothing in itself but the prerequisite for any-
thing must separate itself from every last consideration 
to continue.

</p>
<p>Of the Funding
</p>
<p>5.1.1 The facility is not itself a thing to be considered &mdash; as 
a promise for example of unlimited resources that 
will serve as an inducement to the signing of the con-
tract &mdash; but is that which would allow consideration 
to begin with. There is nothing to distinguish what is 
formally referred to as &ldquo;the contract&rdquo; from this faculty 
that funds. The acceptance of its terms is how it func-
tions.
</p>
<p>5.1.2 Funding is received in the performance of the contract, 
which occurs as the expression of the terms. 
</p>
<p>5.1.3 The performance of the contract means not only its ef-
ficient operation, but fulfilment of the terms. This ful-
filment would provide for any outcome.
</p>
<p>5.1.4 The facility may not be circumscribed by every pos-
sible requirement in advance of realisation, but deter-
mines on the go, and as it has to. Thus provisionally 
defined by its particular examples the facility makes 
real.
</p>
<p>5.1.5 The operation of the contract is the unforeseen pro-
duction of the real.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>54
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>5.2.1 The facility escapes the comprehension it enables. As 
prerequisite to things as such in general it is nothing in 
itself but the necessity to yield to its unthinkable condi-
tions.
</p>
<p>5.2.2 The presence of the contract presupposes its own fund-
ing operation. It would follow that the contract would 
invalidate its own determination.
</p>
<p>5.2.3 The contract is the founding operation that has come 
to be accepted as the essence of the world. It is not a 
thing to think of, but considered nonetheless it may 
present itself as such. Although not adequate to that 
which it would seem to be the image, such an image 
represents a subtle shift in its ongoing operation, so 
that that which it would represent must signify as such 
in turn no longer.
</p>
<p>5.2.4 A single definition of the contract merely signifies the 
same as a particular example of its (fictional) opera-
tion.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>55
</p>
<p>of the funding
</p>
<p>5.3.1 The facility is given as what gives consideration. It ap-
pears as such in that there be appearance, not as such 
or such appearance.
</p>
<p>5.3.2 The presumption of the contract in the presence of 
whatever it may be must not be simplified to signify 
&ldquo;a totality that implicates the predetermination of all 
possible perception,&rdquo; as has happened in the past. Defi-
nitions of this kind are to refer to as the obstinate re-
mainder of a single operation of the contract, which 
could never be perceived as such directly. Such totality 
will always be conceived as but another mere example 
to let go of.
</p>
<p>5.3.3 The contract is the faculty for things as such in gener-
al &mdash; not as &ldquo;everything&rdquo; considered, but in every thing 
considered.
</p>
<p>5.3.4 The funding cannot be objective.
</p>
<p>5.3.5 Although it be defined as an unlimited resource this 
form of finance is not measured in the manner of a 
quantitative agency to cover any need, but is the quali-
tative measure of all things. It is contracted out of 
nothing.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>56
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>5.4.1 The facility provides for things not formerly provid-
ed &mdash; such as &ldquo;galaxies beyond the milky way.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>5.4.2 The financial operations that allow for the appearance 
of whatever it may be define the contract. They are only 
to receive in separation from what rights and obliga-
tions have continued until now.
</p>
<p>5.4.3 The acceptance of the terms of resignation would allow 
for things to be.
</p>
<p>5.4.4 To be able to receive one must relinquish.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>57
</p>
<p>of the funding
</p>
<p>5.5.1 The terms that are of relevance to funding may not 
specify what can or not be funded. There is nothing to 
preclude a future outcome. What they signify pertains 
to that which cannot be conceived by a contracted un-
derstanding.
</p>
<p>5.5.2 The facility that lends is not the subject of a limit to 
invest with, but itself provides the limits to adhere to. 
There is nothing to preclude the unpredictable exist-
ence of whatever it may be &mdash; but whatever comes to be 
is not an option to take up, or turn away from.
</p>
<p>5.5.3 Funding therefore cannot be reduced to a specific sum 
to spend on any project. It specifically defines the thing 
invested.
</p>
<p>5.5.4 The sum of all that is is an impossible abstraction.
</p>
<p>5.5.5 The facility enables not according to the means that it 
has ready to dispose &mdash; but by agreement.
</p>
<p>5.5.6 There is no limit to the funding, but each fund provides 
a limit to adhere to.
</p>
<p>5.5.7 A term of understanding to invest is also limit to in-
vestment.
</p>
<p>5.5.8 Every fund is finite.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>58
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>5.6.1 The funding is of singular examples, which are not to 
serve as funding for whatever else besides. They are 
contracted out of nothing, as occurrences of debt that 
have no substance to depend on.
</p>
<p>5.6.2 The use of what is funded for the funding of another 
kind of business or concern is an abuse of the agree-
ment.
</p>
<p>5.6.3 Considerations such as foodstuff, clothes, apartments, 
and unlimited diversions are provided as required by 
individual contractions. Thus to live and to enjoy the 
world one has to come to terms without assuming 
what one has as had to bargain &mdash; for the price of any 
good is irreducible to any good besides.
</p>
<p>5.6.4 A term would be the price of any good that would pro-
duce it out of nothing.
</p>
<p>5.6.5 The singular enjoyment of each aspect of the world re-
ceived is all that may be taken as your own.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>59
</p>
<p>of the funding
</p>
<p>5.7.1 Though the contract may be seen by its examples, it is 
not by such defined. That &ldquo;a house&rdquo; has been provided, 
in conjunction with &ldquo;an automatic vehicle&rdquo; to drive in, 
and with &ldquo;food&rdquo; to be consumed is not construed to 
mean that anything besides may be derived from their 
adjacent constitutions. That they are is not a conse-
quence of conscious calculation, but of gradual accept-
ance of the terms.
</p>
<p>5.7.2 A fund is not reducible to something-to-consider. As 
contracted out of nothing, it is that which has allowed 
some thing to be; which is not to be reduced to parts or 
precedents. The image of &ldquo;an atom&rdquo; is a mere approxi-
mation to begin with, and so cannot be the ground of 
the emergence of whatever else may be.
</p>
<p>5.7.3 A stone is an expression of the universe to equal any 
star. There is no precedence, nor order to adhere to.
</p>
<p>5.7.4 The facility provides in spite of everything provided.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>60
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>5.8.1 The facility implies determination; where the fund that 
it concedes for either this or that proposal presupposes 
the contraction of a term by which the sense of such is 
settled. The term itself is funding. The &ldquo;unlimited re-
sources&rdquo; are not open to the will and inclination of the 
subject (which must constantly expose itself to redeter-
mination). The consequence of which is the negation 
of quotidian concerns: though the subject lose control, 
the need to exercise control is also lifted. While atten-
tive to the terms there is no worry.
</p>
<p>5.8.2 The objects of investment are not precedent to fund-
ing, but suppose it.
</p>
<p>5.8.3 Funding is not granted in accordance to the will of one 
already predetermined, but by terms of the agreement. 
Thus the difficulty met with by deliberate requests for 
further funding.
</p>
<p>5.8.4 To persist in an objective would be reason for a freeze 
on further funding.
</p>
<p>5.8.5 The funding may be frozen by a cause by which a con-
sciousness be held to all remaining obligations. Situa-
tions of this kind are to be recognised in anguish.
</p>
<p>5.8.6 A contractual dysfunction leads to interest.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>61
</p>
<p>of the funding
</p>
<p>5.9.1 Funding may be endlessly received, as long as focus 
is maintained in its disinterested investment, and not 
drawn towards protecting what has come to be in con-
sequence of previous investment.
</p>
<p>5.9.2 Only passively may funding be accepted by the one 
who would invest it. It cannot be decided in accord-
ance with a will that would invest it as it pleases, but 
decided stage by stage as obligation.
</p>
<p>5.9.3 The funding is conceded by allowing it to draw against 
all interests. It is not to be assumed therefore as grant-
ed, but to ask in every instance.
</p>
<p>5.9.4 The facility would function as absolved from the con-
tention that results from the persistence of possession.
</p>
<p>5.9.5 The terms are contradictory to all that may belong 
to any person. The facility provides to those that give 
themselves away.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>62
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>5.10.1 There is &ldquo;I&rdquo; because there is a contract. I cannot decide 
on my acceptance of the contract, and the fact that I 
am able to imagine that I could presumes the contract 
has already been accepted. In the absence of this fact 
there would be nothing to account for.
</p>
<p>5.10.2 The funding is contracted for whatever it may be in 
terms of conscience.
</p>
<p>5.10.3 The implication of my conscience differentiates my 
presence from the presence of whatever else the con-
tract has provided, such as: such or such a bird, or such 
a cloud, or such a ray, or such a flower.
</p>
<p>5.10.4 That the funding be received is not a matter of free 
choice.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>63
</p>
<p>of the funding
</p>
<p>5.11.1 The contract is to operate in terms of resignation.
</p>
<p>5.11.2 To negotiate the terms is not to argue either way, but to 
accept them as directed.
</p>
<p>5.11.3 The facility may never be controlled by any means that 
it has formally provided. It is not to be controlled, but 
given into.
</p>
<p>5.11.4 The performance of the contract is received as an on-
going expectation. The facility facilitates such yielding 
such diverse consideration &mdash; which appears as an in-
centive to continue.
</p>
<p>5.11.5 The entreatment must continue, irrespective of what-
ever has already been provided by the contract.
</p>
<p>5.11.6 Not for this or that, the entreatment is disinterested 
concern for what exceeds the understanding.
</p>
<p>5.11.7 Give up everything for nothing.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>64
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>5.12.1 The need for funding is the need for understanding.
</p>
<p>5.12.2 The production of the universe by funding, which de-
rives from an originary lapse in terms that indicate 
their ultimate fulfilment, whereby that which is agreed 
as insufficient to account for what it stands for is a 
promise to repay the same in future generations, will 
proceed by way of endless resignation.
</p>
<p>5.12.3 The funding cannot constitute a permanent founda-
tion to depend on. The reality produced by its ungrasp-
able contraction must be taken as a debt to be absolved 
from. All reality gives way to the necessity to pay.
</p>
<p>5.12.4 There could be nothing if not given by the contract. 
But the insufficient funding means that nothing in par-
ticular is guaranteed to be. The guarantee refers to that, 
regardless what it be, there must be something to con-
sider. Thus the funding is assured, but not that funded.
</p>
<p>5.12.5 That there be something to consider is condition of the 
contract.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>65
</p>
<p>of the funding
</p>
<p>5.13.1 The term that starts the funding operation is irrelevant 
to each of the specifically invested operations that re-
sult from its spontaneous contraction. There can be 
no valid reference to terms that have contracted in the 
past, but an ongoing termination; which may none-
theless stand still. Lack of funding will eventuate from 
conscious interruption in the process to adhere to.
</p>
<p>5.13.2 The facility withdraws from every formal definition. 
Thus the terms that would appear to comprehend its 
operation are already left behind by its ongoing opera-
tion. Such is contrary to things, which it has nonethe-
less determined.
</p>
<p>5.13.3 The funding is contingently decided.
</p>
<p>5.13.4 The nature of the funding is provided by the terms, but 
not the nature of that funded. This depends upon em-
pirical observation, which is not to be relied on.
</p>
<p>5.13.5 The funding is a fundamental process that must always 
be supposed in the existence of whatever field of refer-
ence; not a thing to be referred to, but supposed by any 
thing that is referred to.
</p>
<p>5.13.6 Every fund that is contracted is implied in the ongoing 
formulation of the contract.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>66
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>5.14.1 That from which the funding has arrived would be im-
possible to know by any funded apprehension.
</p>
<p>5.14.2 The facility as such is irreducible to figures of that past 
that presuppose its own existence. The validity of prec-
edent refers to the importance of reflection.
</p>
<p>5.14.3 That the funding is in general, and in each of its exam-
ples, somehow signifies a universe distinct from than 
that in which had been enabled its emergence.
</p>
<p>5.14.4 While not figures of a gross accumulation, the expres-
sion of the terms implies the funding that has hap-
pened in the past. The capacity to fund is exponential.
</p>
<p>5.14.5 That the funding has no origin in anything that came 
about by funding, nor in anything at all is for the end-
lessly embedded understanding an imperative to yield. 
It may signify to such an understanding as provided by 
the same that it may never be intended.
</p>
<p>5.14.6 The facility received exceeds that funded.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>67
</p>
<p>of the funding
</p>
<p>5.15.1 The implications of the funding for whatever may be 
funded in the future are impossible to know before 
such happens. What however can be &ldquo;known,&rdquo; in the 
reflection of the present situation, is that that which 
has been funded presupposes the financial operations 
that had brought the world to light in former ages.
</p>
<p>5.15.2 That a figure be recorded on a page of the account book 
is significant perhaps for the contraction of another

<p>5.16.1 The facility forbids; and the forbidding guarantees the

<p>5.16.2 That which the forbidding guarantees is this or that, 
but not another situation.
</p>
<p>5.16.3 The forbidding guarantees a situation, in that what 
appears appears to be consistent. Any breach of the 
forbidding would dissolve the situation under ques-
tion &mdash; the result of which is not to be predicted.
</p>
<p>5.16.4 The guarantee of the validity of something is consid-
ered the forbidding of what cannot be conceived of for 
the moment.

<p>5.16.5 The forbidding is conceived of as a promise to repay.</p>

<p>5.17.1 The significance of terms is their forbidding to begin

has nonetheless enabled one to see.

<p>The Investment
</p>
<p>6.1.1 The return on an investment is no matter of concern 
for the investor.
</p>
<p>6.1.2 Investment is determined by the fund that is invest-
ed. With no freedom to invest in whatsoever it would 
please must the investor be prepared to leave whatever 
they have known before behind them. For the funds 
are not decided in accordance to the world that is, but 
world that would become.
</p>
<p>6.1.3 Funding may be granted to invest for an alternative to 
live in. What that world to come might look like is no 
possible concern for the investor, who looks only to 
enable.
</p>
<p>6.1.4 That which is left out of the account is an immeasur-
able return on the investment.
</p>
<p>6.1.5 The investments of the contract are for anyone to come.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>6.2.1 The terms of the investment are not objects of invest-
ment, and impossible to clarify in terms of any actual 
investment.
</p>
<p>6.2.2 The source of funding cannot be accepted as an object 
of investment of the same.
</p>
<p>6.2.3 Terms may never be invested into terms, but into mat-
ters of concern.
</p>
<p>6.2.4 The facility allows for only actual investments, not in-
tangible designs of an uncertain speculation. There is 
nothing to contain the source of funding in the future, 
but the fund for now is finite.
</p>
<p>6.2.5 The acceptance of a term precedes reception of the 
means thereby invested.
</p>
<p>6.2.6 Only one thing at one time may be invested.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>73
</p>
<p>the investment
</p>
<p>6.3.1 That the presently invested be objectively retained for 
use in future situations would invalidate the faculty 
that funded the investment to begin with. This will 
nonetheless retain the term that granted such when 
functional in future.
</p>
<p>6.3.2 The potential to invest is instantaneous, and cannot be 
transferred, or left for later.
</p>
<p>6.3.3 All credit is of limited duration.
</p>
<p>6.3.4 A reality that comes about by credit will depend upon 
that credit to continue.
</p>
<p>6.3.5 Credit may recede without another situation to replace 
the one left owing; in which case that situation will be 
difficult to bear.
</p>
<p>6.3.6 An investment will remain as something owing in it-
self, and thereby signify the need for a renewal of the 
contract.
</p>
<p>6.3.7 Credit is of precedence to swearing.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>74
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>6.4.1 The investment of the funding will take form as sworn 
adherence to the term by which that funding has been 
granted.
</p>
<p>6.4.2 An investment is an oath.
</p>
<p>6.4.3 An oath is that which holds to the agreement. One may 
not therefore be held to such in future &mdash; though this 
oath may be construed in other ways than first intend-
ed.
</p>
<p>6.4.4 Such an oath is not a statement to adhere to, but the 
manner of adherence to the contract.
</p>
<p>6.4.5 A specific affirmation is a promise to adhere made in 
adherence to the contract.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>75
</p>
<p>the investment
</p>
<p>6.5.1 Only as an unresolved provision will an oath concern 
the future. As an oath it is of pertinence to that which 
it adheres to in the present. It is not to be referred to as 
a promise of intention, but may come to be accounted 
for according to a circumstance of which it has no no-
tion. The sense of any oath is always open.
</p>
<p>6.5.2 Left behind as proof of an adherence to the contract, 
and as freely given means by which another may gain 
entry to the contract, the expression of an oath is a spe-
cific affirmation for the future.
</p>
<p>6.5.3 That which has been signified may only be conceived 
of by resigning, which would signify in turn the need 
for signing. A sign is the expression of a promise to 
repay, which at the same time serves as payment.
</p>
<p>6.5.4 A sign is an injunction to invest for the uncertainty it 
points to.
</p>
<p>6.5.5 Swearing to adhere to a condition of the contract the 
investor leaves to other understandings.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>76
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>6.6.1 The potential to invest is not compatible with any incli-
nation to possess the thing invested, nor with any self-
ish aim, nor last objective. Terms are given to facilitate 
what cannot be conceived by the investor.
</p>
<p>6.6.2 That the funding be available depends on the relin-
quishment of previous investments.
</p>
<p>6.6.3 Investments are let go, and left for future generations to 
make use of.
</p>
<p>6.6.4 The return on an investment is for consciences to 
come.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>77
</p>
<p>the investment
</p>
<p>6.7.1 As the funding is impossible to save for reinvestment, 
the account will be a record of all actual investments. 
These however may eventuate as subject to investment 
in the future.
</p>
<p>6.7.2 A provisional account may thus be given as a source of 
future funding.
</p>
<p>6.7.3 To invest is to provision with a name to be recorded on 
a page of the account, for the contraction of return in 
terms of future understanding.
</p>
<p>6.7.4 What the figures of the past may come to signify in 
terms of reinvestment is impossible to speculate at pre-
sent. However, that these figures be susceptible to re-
consideration may be taken from the quality of worth 
in their formation.
</p>
<p>6.7.5 The sense of prohibition is condition for the freedom 
to invest within the present.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>78
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>6.8.1 The worth of an investment is the only guarantee that 
it be valid to begin with &mdash; as the promise of return on 
that investment.
</p>
<p>6.8.2 The worth is incommensurable with something to 
consider.
</p>
<p>6.8.3 The quality of worth that may in no way be accounted 
is the only guarantee for the protection of that given to 
make use of.
</p>
<p>6.8.4 The quality of worth may be conceived of as a promise 
to fulfil in future ages; thus significant of worlds that 
are to come.
</p>
<p>6.8.5 Not as something signified, the quality of worth is the 
significance itself of something given. This significance 
is open.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>79
</p>
<p>the investment
</p>
<p>6.9.1 The quality of worth may only last for the duration of 
the term by which a thing has been provided. In the 
subsequent fixation of this quality this quality escapes 
the thing contracted. Funding cannot be set down to 
be translated, or transferred, by any reason.
</p>
<p>6.9.2 As detached from the financial operation that pro-
duced the thing in question will it be of worth no long-
er. A worthless thing however may yet constitute the 
focus of some future operation.
</p>
<p>6.9.3 A worthless debt may yet attract more funding.
</p>
<p>6.9.4 That which is to pay, as well as that which would enable 
one to pay the same is signified by worth.
</p>
<p>6.9.5 An awareness of the worth is an awareness of the con-
tract.</p>

</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>6.10.1 An investment may facilitate another understanding to 
invest with.
</p>
<p>6.10.2 All that is required is an awareness of the indetermina-
tion of the terms of the investment, and an openness to 
reinterpretation.

</p>
<p>The Account
</p>
<p>7.1.1 The nature of the debt may be accounted for in terms 
of a reflection on the method of accounting.
</p>
<p>7.1.2 At every stage of the ongoing evolution of accounting 
has the nature of that taken to account been universally 
transfigured; in the wake of which has followed a nu-
merical expansion of that nature.
</p>
<p>7.1.3 The formulation of the contract and accountancy were 
not to differentiate when writing was invented. This 
inseparable event was only later to give rise to differ-
ent manners of narration, such as &ldquo;literature,&rdquo; and &ldquo;fi-
nance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the law,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;science.&rdquo; Their con-
traction at the end of this historical occurrence may 
again give rise to other kinds of story.
</p>
<p>7.1.4 The facts in the account book are in fact interpreta-
tions of the contract.
</p>
<p>7.1.5 Only in its strange and disconnected taking place a fact 
is valid.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>82
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>7.2.1 According to the functional requirements of the con-
tract is a qualitative method of accountancy to follow. 
As instructed by the terms that are of relevance to debt 
this is a process of intense negotiation.
</p>
<p>7.2.2 The accountant is in other words to utilise a single-
entry method of accounting that arrives at separate 
figures of that owed without equating any one to any 
other, and records them as received in such a way as to 
allow for an extreme interpretation, by whatever world 
to come (without accounting for that future). Such a 
method corresponds to strict adherence to the con-
tract. It can have as such no end.
</p>
<p>7.2.3 The contraction of a debt will be recorded on a page 
of the account book &mdash; to defer towards the audit of a 
future understanding. The account is thus the form of 
the ongoing formulation of the contract. The delayed 
interpretation of such figures of account may be con-
ceived as the fulfilment of the terms thereby invested.
</p>
<p>7.2.4 The accountant is to separately take note of every term 
that is concluded.
</p>
<p>7.2.5 The secondary terms are to be written as received.
</p>
<p>7.2.6 That &ldquo;an entry may in future be interpreted to signify 
what cannot be accounted for for now&rdquo; will be a funda-
mental premise of this method of accounting.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>83
</p>
<p>the account
</p>
<p>7.3.1 This qualitative method comes to terms with externali-
ties that could not be accounted for by previous com-
mitments.
</p>
<p>7.3.2 That a figure of account can only signify what cannot 
be accounted for for now means that the sense of the 
account cannot be settled.
</p>
<p>7.3.3 It is not that the account is incomplete, but insufficient 
to account for what it cannot take account of it may 
signify diversely from the way it was conceived when 
first recorded. Later entries may requalify the sense of 
all preceding estimations.
</p>
<p>7.3.4 Every entry is a record of receipt of what is only to be-
hold as but a promise to interpret. The capacity to fund 
is not explicitly contained in the account book, but is 
signified by statements left increasingly unclear.
</p>
<p>7.3.5 That which such an entry comes to signify will have to 
be repaid by the contraction of a deeper understand-
ing. That a debt has been accounted for by any final 
figure means that such has been received, and not how 
such may be remitted.
</p>
<p>7.3.6 How to pay is a concern that is impossible to answer 
in advance of an eventual repayment. There is nothing 
to suggest a way to terminate the presence of a debt in 
which a consciousness be endlessly abandoned.
</p>
<p>7.3.7 &ldquo;Quantitative debt&rdquo; would be a quality that indicates 
the pressure to repay.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>7.4.1 Recognition of a debt may not for now be recognition 
of the worth that it may nonetheless be sign of.
</p>
<p>7.4.2 An entry is a sign of that which has to be accounted for 
in future &mdash; whether recognised as such, or misinter-
preted to mean that such has taken an account of such 
already.
</p>
<p>7.4.3 That which cannot be accounted cannot even be per-
ceived as not accounted.
</p>
<p>7.4.4 That which is external to the field of calculation of the 
debt may have no reference beyond such substitution. 
To account for it would need the constitution of an-
other kind of contract.
</p>
<p>7.4.5 That which is excluded from the lines of the account 
may come to light by means of signing.
</p>
<p>7.4.6 That which is accounted is internal to the world and 
therefore given to make use of; but as recognised as 
debt to be completely handed over.
</p>
<p>7.4.7 The fiction of an immanent account is the result of one 
mistaken estimation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>85
</p>
<p>the account
</p>
<p>7.5.1 One could imagine that a term that is conserved in 
written form upon a single piece of paper be the substi-
tute for various new things and situations; where a pri-
mary exchange of a particular occasion be repeated by 
another set of hands for something other than intend-
ed, which proceeds to the exchange of countless other 
situations, in an open-ended space of correspondence. 
However, as removed from the reality that underlies its 
reason, which had even as conceived been insufficient 
to account for what it stood for, this equivalence ap-
pears as a complete equivocation, which will only be 
maintained as long as trusted. Such a space would thus 
collapse as soon as doubted.
</p>
<p>7.5.2 The significance or worth of any promissory note will 
be reduced by the effects of countersigning.
</p>
<p>7.5.3 The value of exchange is an expression of the same that 
could in principle extend forever outwards. As a mere 
approximation to begin with, this autonomous expan-
sion is a reckless imposition that must fail to take ac-
count of what it cannot take account of; which it fol-
lows would invalidate its endless calculation.
</p>
<p>7.5.4 The unlimited liability will make of the within a figure 
owing. The demand will not postpone itself forever. 
One will have to come to terms &mdash; to pay the difference.
</p>
<p>7.5.5 To multiply a fund to try to overcome a reoccurring 
crisis is to reinforce the difference that constitutes its 
cause.
</p>
<p>7.5.6 To calculate the funding as a thing is to conceal the 
very question.
</p>
<p>7.5.7 The interminate cannot be bought with money.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>86
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>7.6.1 The possibility that something be exchangeable for 
something is reducible to absence of attention.
</p>
<p>7.6.2 In the space of the account there is no precedence of 
any one example to another, and no figure may reduce 
to any other.
</p>
<p>7.6.3 The fact that every cause is an effect directly opens to 
the principle of insufficient reason.
</p>
<p>7.6.4 The narration must assume no set relation between any 
given fact and any other, but record the incommensu-
rable appearances of debt as they are given to make use 
of.
</p>
<p>7.6.5 The opening causation goes from this because of that 
to this caused only.
</p>
<p>7.6.6 The figures must be kept apart in order to allow for 
future entries.
</p>
<p>7.6.7 That a figure be reduced to its constituents will consti-
tute an error of accounting.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>87
</p>
<p>the account
</p>
<p>7.7.1 The need to reach a figure is ongoing, irrespective of 
what figures have been drawn to such an end.
</p>
<p>7.7.2 A figure must be reached. Not the figure of a total, 
which would satisfy the need to render payment once 
for all &mdash; for such need is universal, and impossible to 
figure absolutely, in that nothing of the kind could cov-
er all that has or has not been provided. Every figure 
has been borrowed; which must mean that there will 
always be a greater need to pay.
</p>
<p>7.7.3 It is impossible to calculate a figure of the kind that 
would release the self from every obligation.
</p>
<p>7.7.4 To settle the account would need an infinite repay-
ment.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>88
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>7.8.1 Accounting comes to terms with what remains as a re-
sult of such a process. The return on an investment is 
no matter of concern for the investor.
</p>
<p>7.8.2 Any figure that is reached is to refer to as the coming to 
account of that which troubled the relation, by which 
that which it relates concerns no longer.
</p>
<p>7.8.3 The figures are the fatal comprehensions of once im-
manent concerns, set down as clauses.
</p>
<p>7.8.4 A promissory note will stay susceptible to strange in-
terpretations.</p>

</p>
<p>The Debt
</p>
<p>8.1.1 Having from the contract, and unable to accede to 
things directly in themselves, there may be nothing 
else than debt to take account of.
</p>
<p>8.1.2 Other than the evidence of debt there may be nothing 
to refer to.
</p>
<p>8.1.3 The quality of debt transcends all previous distinc-
tions, such as &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; &ldquo;poor&rdquo; and &ldquo;wealthy,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;illusive.&rdquo; But this quality itself as such has 
nothing to contrast with.
</p>
<p>8.1.4 Consciousness is consciousness of debt.
</p>
<p>8.1.5 That there be nothing else than debt for any subject to 
account for is a matter of concern that every subject is 
required to come to terms with.
</p>
<p>8.1.6 To recognise the debt will be to recognise the need for 
recognition as ongoing.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>90
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>8.2.1 Every thing is borrowed, in the sense of guaranteed by 
an unspecified necessity to pay.
</p>
<p>8.2.2 A dependency to debt that may appear to be substan-
tial may continue for a time of peace of mind until its 
seemingly unlimited extension be revealed as based on 
nothing.
</p>
<p>8.2.3 Otherwise with nothing to depend on, the contraction 
of a debt provides a temporary ground on which a con-
sciousness may settle. Such is groundless in itself, and 
will require an operation of refinance. The necessity to 
pay is of the void that would invalidate contemporary 
reason. It is not to be explained as such away, but given 
into.
</p>
<p>8.2.4 That which is to pay is not a figure of that owed &mdash; but is 
the void that would invalidate all figures of repayment.
</p>
<p>8.2.5 The pressure to repay is an unreasonable demand to 
give up everything for nothing.
</p>
<p>8.2.6 All as debt needs funding.
</p>
<p>8.2.7 There is nothing to depend on whatsoever.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>91
</p>
<p>the debt
</p>
<p>8.3.1 The financial operations that facilitate the presence of 
the world thus also signify that such is of the nature of 
endebtment.
</p>
<p>8.3.2 Nothing is external to the field of the account of debt 
contracted. To have taken an account of the beginning 
of the world would be to make of it another mere ex-
ample of endebtment.
</p>
<p>8.3.3 The capacity for finance is conceived as an original 
endebtment.
</p>
<p>8.3.4 Not only debt perceived, but the perception of that 
debt is debt itself to be acknowledged as outstanding.
</p>
<p>8.3.5 Not only what you hear, but that you hear has been 
provided by the contract. The facility facilitates its own 
facilitation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>8.4.1 Debt received is anything. Not anything in such that 
this or that would make no difference, in that anything 
at all would equal anything at all in a perception of in-
difference; but anything in such that, like no other, it 
could never have been written to refer to in advance of 
its particular contraction. The varieties of debt cannot 
be listed to begin with. 
</p>
<p>8.4.2 Understanding of the debt as such in general may have 
no determination on particular endebtments, like &ldquo;that 
apple on that plate.&rdquo; For that apple on that plate has 
been decided by a single operation of the contract.
</p>
<p>8.4.3 Something may exist for the duration of the term by 
which that thing has been decided.
</p>
<p>8.4.4 The quality of debt in something given may suggest 
that it has no secure foundation, so that even its exist-
ence may be doubted. Only that there be a debt is all 
that may be certain &mdash; that is, any debt at all.
</p>
<p>8.4.5 That there be the presence of some debt is a condition 
of the contract.
</p>
<p>8.4.6 The evidence of debt must be accepted as it is, and not 
explained as such away.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>93
</p>
<p>the debt
</p>
<p>8.5.1 The debt appears to manifest itself as without cause.
</p>
<p>8.5.2 There can be no recollection of the terms &mdash; only pre-
sent lack of funding. This predicament is not to be dis-
puted, but accepted as the fact that one exists, which 
fact has never been a matter of free choice. The manda-
tory terms of this existence are so stringently implied 
that they are everywhere at once, and yet irreparably 
behind one. Their restriction may however be relieved 
by the contraction of another obligation. Though the 
debt be absolute, it may be financed.
</p>
<p>8.5.3 That the terms escape the consciousness provided by 
the same may lead that consciousness to calculate the 
presence of the debt as if that debt were independent of 
the contract.
</p>
<p>8.5.4 Although one may arrive at terms to terminate the 
petty obligations that arise from time to time, it is im-
possible to terminate the presence of the debt as such 
completely. The necessity for finance to absolve from 
obligations that have come to be perceived is not re-
ducible to figures of the kind that are progressively de-
manded.
</p>
<p>8.5.5 Payment may be reached by resignation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>94
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>8.6.1 The origin of debt cannot be fathomed.
</p>
<p>8.6.2 Understanding of the origin of debt would be another 
mere example to absolve from.
</p>
<p>8.6.3 That to which the subject be endebted is impossible 
to state without it turning into debt itself contracted. 
Thus the debt is not to &ldquo;god,&rdquo; nor to &ldquo;the market,&rdquo; nor 
to &ldquo;cosmic evolution,&rdquo; nor whatever.
</p>
<p>8.6.4 It may however be supposed that debt is owing to &ldquo;the 
contract.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>8.6.5 To understand the contract as the origin of debt is to 
reduce the same to debt thereby contracted.
</p>
<p>8.6.6 That to which the universe is owed is only recognised 
as yet to be accepted.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>95
</p>
<p>the debt
</p>
<p>8.7.1 An inadequate repayment may be understood to sig-
nify inadequate acceptance.
</p>
<p>8.7.2 To pay is to accept another term that would allow some 
thing to be.
</p>
<p>8.7.3 That which is outstanding &mdash; such as acid in the oceans, 
or the melting of the icecaps &mdash; may be suddenly dis-
charged by the contraction of a fund to be invested.
</p>
<p>8.7.4 The appearance of the world to which and in which the 
endebted is obliged may be abruptly shown invalid by 
another more believable appearance.
</p>

<p>8.7.8 It matters not how much one has to pay, but that one

<p>8.7.9 Anything may serve as a repayment. To assume the

<p>8.8.4 That an instance of the debt be owed to debt breaks

<p>8.8.5 To reduce the debt to debt is an invalid operation of the

<p>8.9.3 The debt is not and cannot be attributed to any other

</p>
<p>8.9.4 To determine that received as equal such or such, or

received could be returned to where it came from, may

could be reduced at all is relative to finance.
</p>
<p>8.9.5 The debt is irreversible. It cannot be returned &mdash; but

<p>the debt
</p>
<p>8.11.1 &ldquo;Debt&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;everything.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>8.11.2 That everything is owed implies a subject.
</p>
<p>8.11.3 Given as a comprehensive picture of the world the debt 
itself contains the mode in which the subject is to act 
to meet the interest. Any debt implies the debtor.
</p>
<p>8.11.4 The structure of the debt is a division of the self into 
an endless field of separate obligations; which as points 
to be referred to, which reciprocally consolidate the 
ultimate identity encumbered by the same, may be dis-
charged by termination of the contract. A restructur-
ing of debt would presuppose another subject.
</p>
<p>8.11.5 Subject is an insufficient term.
</p>
<p>8.11.6 The obliged to keep the contract is created by the same.
</p>
<p>8.11.7 The identity contracted is a single iteration of an end-
less alteration.
</p>
<p>8.11.8 The financial operations draw the self outside the self, 
in recreation of the subject.
</p>
<p>8.11.9 The endless separation of the inside from without 
moves the within towards an ever farther outside.
</p>
<p>8.11.10 Debt cannot be paid, except by coming to new terms, 
in a fulfilling recommitment, which in any case falls 
short.</p>

<p>8.12.1 The financial operations that absolve the self from 
worldly obligations are themselves not of the order of 
this world. So to speak, they are to pray for.
</p>
<p>8.12.2 From an irredeemable prehistory the present debt 
remains without a limit to refer to as the principle to 
pay. The diversions of investment would appear to 
have no end for the endebted understanding. And the 
only means to pay would be the ultimate release from 
obligations that is thought about in fictional accounts 
of &ldquo;what comes after&rdquo;; which as death to that which 
thinks mean less than nothing.
</p>
<p>8.12.3 A figure would be reached in termination of the sub-
ject.
</p>
<p>8.12.4 Debt may be reducible in terms of separation from 
what cannot be returned to.

</p>
<p>8.13.3 Having from that signifies what cannot be perceived

<p>8.13.5 As a sign of an eventual repayment, every debt is to be

<p>Against Property
</p>
<p>9.1.1 &ldquo;Property&rdquo; is founded on an ancient acceptation of a 
term become fixated. The expression of the same in 
terms of legal recognition of that owned is a perpet-
ual construction that dissimulates the sense of what it 
stands for.
</p>
<p>9.1.2 The postulate of property assumes that something tan-
gible may constitute an origin that validates itself as 
independent of the universe in which it has arisen.
</p>
<p>9.1.3 Property may constitute an obvious foundation, 
whereby funding for whatever else be given in relation 
to that principal invested. An intentional extension of 
the measure of the same however constitutes a failure 
to adhere to the conditions of the contract.
</p>
<p>9.1.4 Default may be defined as the possession of the uni-
verse contracted.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>104
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>9.2.1 Rather than a pure appropriation, the contraction of a 
term is an occurrence of endebtment.
</p>
<p>9.2.2 Contraction is assumption of a debt to be discharged, 
and not secure appropriation of what threatened to 
disrupt the field of consciousness within which an ex-
istence was protected.
</p>
<p>9.2.3 The pressure to repay is not an object of potential dom-
ination, but an unfulfilled relation to resign to.
</p>
<p>9.2.4 Property invalidates the contract.
</p>
<p>9.2.5 Any ownership of debt is an internal contradiction.
</p>
<p>9.2.6 Funding cannot operate in face of the possession of 
that given to make use of.</p>

<p>9.3.1 The identity contracted to adhere to that which funds 
is but an instance of adherence, which is not to be ad-
hered to howsoever.
</p>
<p>9.3.2 The identity is given by the contract. When whatever 
be reduced to &ldquo;my legitimate possession&rdquo; my identity 
disrupts the operation of the contract. Who I am in-
validates whoever I may be.
</p>
<p>9.3.3 Everything I own is therefore everything I owe.
</p>
<p>9.3.4 Reality perceived as that belonging to an incidental 
subject must be recognised as groundless. Only fi-
nance may resolve a situation of untenable default (as 
here depicted).</p>

<p>Default
</p>
<p>10.1.1 Debt is to be understood as always overdue. Meaning 
that it comes too late &mdash; and always as an instance of 
default.
</p>
<p>10.1.2 Every human tends by definition to default. This can-
not be avoided absolutely. But by passively accepting 
the uncommon terms of judgement, as they come to be 
expressed, in resignation, the infliction of the punish-
ment is ceaselessly remitted.
</p>
<p>10.1.3 The avoidance of default is to be ceaselessly procured 
by the acceptance of new terms that stand in payment. 
A reduction of the difference that threatens to deprive 
the self of everything is merely a reprieve in an ongoing 
termination.
</p>
<p>10.1.4 An apparent absolution would in any case be shown to 
be an actual default.
</p>
<p>10.1.5 Every full and final payment must be recognised as 
merely a delay in an unceasable proceedings. It is only 
in this way that the default may be avoided.
</p>
<p>10.1.6 There can be no end to payment.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>108
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>10.2.1 The persistence of default is an unwillingness to ques-
tion.
</p>
<p>10.2.2 Unavoidable default, in that it come and come again 
despite all efforts to adhere to the conditions of the 
contract, and regardless of whichever debt is held to be 
in question, is perhaps the only way to understand the 
rather difficult idea of that the void cannot be voided.
</p>
<p>10.2.3 The avoidance of default is a continuous concern for 
the endebted understanding. The intentional rejection 
of that claimed is preparation for the purely uninten-
tional acceptance of the secondary terms of absolu-
tion. Understanding of the need for validation would 
be requisite for any kind of valid understanding.
</p>
<p>10.2.4 Validation is a process of internal understanding of the 
contract.
</p>
<p>10.2.5 A concept is an instance of contractual awareness; but 
as taken from its instance and externally applied as a 
generic understanding it will constitute an instance of 
invalid occupation.
</p>
<p>10.2.6 The persistence of a fund is an invalid proposition. 
The occurrence of default is a derivative of insufficient 
terms.</p>

<p>default
</p>
<p>10.3.1 The conditions of first access to whatever it may be may 
be ignored in the enjoyment of that given. To adhere to 
the conditions would require the pain of parting from 
whatever has provided one with comfort.
</p>
<p>10.3.2 Default may be defined as the neglect of the condi-
tions. This neglect will coincide with the suspension of 
resources.
</p>
<p>10.3.3 Difficulty comes when the facility that funds no longer 
functions. For example, when the funding funds the 
funding operation will result its own unthinkable dys-
function.
</p>
<p>10.3.4 That the finance finance finance makes no sense.
</p>
<p>10.3.5 The refusal of financial intervention on the grounds of 
past investment, in that subsequent possession of the 
same must disallow its operation to continue, may be 
seen in such a manner as to indicate its imminent re-
sumption.
</p>
<p>10.3.6 Disregard for the conditions, in that such or such an 
object be assumed as independent of the contract, 
leads to permanent default and unrelenting prosecu-
tion. The conditions are that nothing be received in 
kind with interest, and that nothing be without them.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>110
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>10.4.1 Default is a condition that takes root in the forgetting 
of the contract. Its forgetting means not only its per-
sistence out of mind, but its inadequate conception to 
begin with.
</p>
<p>10.4.2 The terms that are forgotten are inadequate concep-
tions that continue to enable the presumption of a 
world without awareness.
</p>
<p>10.4.3 The contract is forgotten in such instances of question-
less intent that take the world that is for granted.
</p>
<p>10.4.4 Lack of recognition of the debt thereby mistaken for 
a permanent foundation to depend on is the clearest 
indication that the contract be forgotten.
</p>
<p>10.4.5 The forgetting of the contract corresponds to the for-
getting of the difference-to-pay, whereby it seems as if 
the world did not depend on the conditions of the con-
tract. This is not to be received as if the contract were 
itself the so-called difference.
</p>
<p>10.4.6 Forgotten terms are such that have produced an expec-
tation that consistently falls short of what they stand 
for. Any recognition of the difference will constitute an 
instance of repayment.
</p>
<p>10.4.7 Forgotten terms are grounds for prosecution. To avoid 
the countless consequences leading from default it is 
imperative to ask for further finance. Loss of expec-
tation would eventuate from any operation of that fi-
nance.
</p>
<p>10.4.8 The fact of falling short may lead to endless prosecu-
tion, where the judgement is eternally postponed.

<p>10.5.1 Possession is default; perception error.
</p>
<p>10.5.2 Whether the received consideration be acknowledged 
in itself, or as a promise of fulfilment, is decisive in the 
question of the presence of default.
</p>
<p>10.5.3 Either keep the thing considered, or the contract; in 
the sense of either letting the fulfilment of the terms, or 
holding on to the appearance of the world (as prosecu-
tion).
</p>
<p>10.5.4 Rather than a source of obligation, which is yet and 
ever yet to be determined, the beginning of the world 
may be received as something settled for a subject in 
default; which in consequence continues to assume the 
same and asks no valid question. But according and at-
tentive to the fundamental void the faithful draws the 
deadline forward.
</p>
<p>10.5.5 Pride protects its place within the image of the 
world &mdash; not defending this itself, but by upholding the 
whole image.
</p>
<p>10.5.6 The variations of the presence of default are without 
number. It will be difficult to see as such in every situ-
ation.

<p>11.1.2 The difference may never be reduced as such, but only

</p>
<p>11.1.3 An estimation of the difference is not to be arrived at 
by the means of calculation; but by payment. Yet repay-
ment comes up short in any instance.
</p>
<p>11.1.4 The difference-to-pay is to be understood in terms of

<p>11.3.1 That the finance is to operate in terms of understand-
ing that approximate, but cannot comprehend the so-
called difference, which endlessly defers itself by na-
ture, and in consequence determine the remainder of a 
debt that is inseparable from all that is in such or such 
an era; is itself to be considered as a temporary ground 
on which to settle. The financial operations are as rel-
evant to terms of its continued operation inconsist-
ent, but effective. The facility will have to be entreated 
always otherwise, and always to begin with. There is 
nothing to depend on.
</p>
<p>11.3.2 The facility works only as enabled by the difference. 
With no room by which to move it would not func-
tion. Adequation would be infinite, and nothing would 
be realised.
</p>
<p>11.3.3 Inadequation of the terms leads to ongoing operation 
of the contract.
</p>
<p>11.3.4 Like an exponential promise of production, could the 
difference be said to be the cause of future funding. The 
support received is always only finite.
</p>
<p>11.3.5 The aporia returns; for even the most proximate with-
out would be disclosed as a result of the discordance 
of the contract, the sense of which will signify a fun-
damental term that is to come to meet the difference; 
which though pressured by the difference would con-
sist of an interior fulfilment. Though prefigured, such a 
term would be completely unforeseen.
</p>
<p>11.3.6 The image left will have to be forsaken. For even in the

<p>11.4.1 The interminate necessitates an open sensibility to 
meaning that may passively discern all things as sepa-

appearance; not a preconceived idea of a totality that 
arrogates itself in an illusion of preponderance, where 
everything would seem to be submissive to the will 
that has contracted to fulfil it. Or at least until it wakes 
from such delusion.
</p>
<p>11.4.2 The interminate is not to be commanded, nor to even 
be perceived by an identity that otherwise imagines. It 
will always overcome. Although not known it may ap-
pear to be the source of the forbidding of the image of

<p>11.4.3 The forbidding is impossible to heed, in that an image

means foreseen, may not extend to that perception. It 
may nonetheless remain as most conducive to what-
ever it may signify to other understandings.
</p>
<p>12.3.4 The validity of such or such an image of the world will 
coincide with the irreparable effect of termination; 
whereby that which is perceived as such is recognised 
as fatefully discharged, and so no longer a concern.
</p>
<p>12.3.5 A sentence will be valid for as long as it be open to the 
process of revision. For as soon as it has settled into 
any kind of clause it will refer to only that which is no 
longer; or to that which has already passed away. And

it has to be accepted that the void may not be set as 
such aside, but given into.

<p>Of Finance
</p>
<p>13.1.1 Although it be to come, the finance cannot be con-
ceived as but behind one (past already).
</p>
<p>13.1.2 That the finance be revealed as not the ground of that 
which is, but in the evident relief from that which was 
remains a sign of that to follow.
</p>
<p>13.1.3 That from which and that to which the finance comes 
and goes cannot be present.
</p>
<p>13.1.4 Relief is always past, and yet is always yet to come. For 
the present that remains remains unfounded.
</p>
<p>13.1.5 The terms of finance have always already lapsed.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>128
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>13.2.1 As the lapse that is already left behind is finance fol-
lowed by a consciousness that follows its own lack of 
understanding by which terms may be contracted.
</p>
<p>13.2.2 The finance comes to pass as separation from what 
cannot be remembered, to a consciousness to come.
</p>
<p>13.2.3 That from which and that to which are one.
</p>
<p>13.2.4 The finance would appear as disappearance that leaves 
only an example to refer to, which would have to be let 
go for the financial operation to continue.
</p>
<p>13.2.5 The finance disappears in its provisioning of means of 
substitution. As correctly apprehended will these signs 
be turned away from and abandoned.
</p>
<p>13.2.6 Finance cannot be conceived of as a product of its own 
facilitation; in that debt is not reducible to debt, re-
duced to debt, reduced to nothing.
</p>
<p>13.2.7 It would follow that the only comprehension of the fi-
nance that may ever be achieved will be by means of 
that which signifies its absence.
</p>
<p>13.2.8 The relevance of finance to the fact of that which is may 
be considered in the light of its delayed invalidation.</p>

</p>
<p>13.3.1 If a figure could be drawn for the perception of the fi-
nance it would have to be the figure of a spiral. But this 
figure must be seen as but a point along the edge of its 
own turning.
</p>
<p>13.3.2 An alternative to such would be the figure of the debt 
as the circumference of a circle, with no centre to refer 
to; where the absence of proportion corresponds to an 
inherent need for finance.</p>

</p>
<p>13.4.1 There is no reason for the finance, such as &ldquo;given in 
exchange for a particular good deed.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>13.4.2 That the finance be is ground enough, and needs no 
other reason.
</p>
<p>13.4.3 Any reason that is given to explain either the need or 
the potential for the finance will be reason to obstruct 
its operation.
</p>
<p>13.4.4 The finance is refused in its own relevance to that 
which is provided. A refusal of this kind must coincide 
with its contingent operation.
</p>
<p>13.4.5 A debt is both the product of and obstacle to finance.</p>

</p>
<p>13.5.1 The financial operations are expressions of the void 
that voids all matters of concern.
</p>
<p>13.5.2 A financial operation of the kind that is of relevance to 
any situation will dissociate the same as such by fund-
ing for another.
</p>
<p>13.5.3 The financial operations that release the self from 
worldly obligations are the countless generations of 
such figures of account that are recorded.
</p>
<p>13.5.4 Difficult to comprehend is the necessity to leave that 
which the contract has provided. The appearance of a 
thing would be dependent on the fact that it be lost to 
the perceiver. Separation from that fact would be con-
dition for it being to begin with.
</p>
<p>13.5.5 The finance is conceived as the contraction of exam-
ples of endebtment, which may only be relieved by its 
continued operation. Thus its relevance to debt is both 
as that which gives, and that which takes away.
</p>
<p>13.5.6 To entreat the operation of the finance must the 
consciousness in debt renounce all matters of con-
cern &mdash; that is, including the concern that is for finance.
</p>
<p>13.5.7 The finance is not given when or where one might de-
cide it would be useful, but according to a need that is 
not given to make sense of.</p>

</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>13.6.1 The acceptance of the terms allows the universe to be. 
Its slow emergence corresponds to an imperative that 
separates the consciousness from everything that was 
to that which cannot be predicted.
</p>
<p>13.6.2 The imperative would generate the funding.
</p>
<p>13.6.3 The imperative necessitates the loss of what was given, 
in exchange for the appearance of whatever else might 
be. It may only be perceived in the reflection of its sin-
gular resultants, and not ever shown directly.
</p>
<p>13.6.4 The imperative is heeded by refusing to maintain the 
least attachment whatever has been offered, and allow-
ing it to offer such or such in separation from that of-
fered. To obey is to renounce the world as given by the 
contract.
</p>
<p>13.6.5 To follow the imperative is not to take control of that 
which happens, but to let the matter be.
</p>
<p>13.6.6 The imperative may not be disobeyed in certain in-
stances that signify itself. Though thus heeded when 
it must be, their significance is easy to pass over. Those 
however who have recognised their import will be held 
in preparation for whatever may be asked of them in 
future.
</p>
<p>13.6.7 Follow the imperative regardless.</p>

</p>
<p>13.7.1 It is the finitude of finance that both validates and voids 
its operation.
</p>
<p>13.7.2 The potential to refinance coincides with the financial 
operation, and as long as this continues. This potential 
is invalid if assumed as something given in advance of 
realisation.
</p>
<p>13.7.3 A reality may not precede, but presupposes its accept-
ance.
</p>
<p>13.7.4 The necessity for finance corresponds to the contin-
gency of terms.
</p>
<p>13.7.5 The finance brings about such innovation as the beat-
ing of a heart, which beating signifies what cannot be 
returned to.
</p>
<p>13.7.6 Finance is the endless operation that brings end to that 
which cannot be remembered, leaving instances of 
debt that have no origin to which to be returned.
</p>
<p>13.7.7 That the finance be refinance is a consequence of hav-
ing no commencement to return to.

<p>13.7.8 Nothing reappears beyond the finance.</p>

</p>
<p>Of the Lapse
</p>
<p>14.1.1 If the operation that allows for debt be recognised as 
having passed already, then the consciousness to which 
it has resulted has no option but to follow its own ab-
sence of attention to the lapse that leaves it groundless.
</p>
<p>14.1.2 The lapse is the beginning of the contract, in the sense 
that this be from the first unfounded.
</p>
<p>14.1.3 The debt remains a signal of that lapse by which it 
came to be considered.
</p>
<p>14.1.4 The lapse occurs as finance.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>136
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>14.2.1 That which would enable the perception of the fact that 
it enables such already has already drawn away from its 
inadequate perception. This will nonetheless remain, 
as the provisional account of a financial operation.
</p>
<p>14.2.2 The lapse is to be understood in terms of a deficiency 
of funding.
</p>
<p>14.2.3 The groundlessness of debt appears in reference to the 
lapse that leaves no memory to return to.
</p>
<p>14.2.4 It is not to the specific obligations that a consciousness 
in debt must be attentive &mdash; but the fundamental lapse 
which has already left them void.
</p>
<p>14.2.5 There is no memory of the lapse.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>of the lapse
</p>
<p>14.3.1 Were it not for the originary lapse there would be 
nothing to consider.
</p>
<p>14.3.2 The lapse could be defined as the immemorable first 
cause that may continue to effect the world as finance. 
Thus the relevance of finance to the presence of the 
world will only deepen the irreparably lost cause by 
which it came to be committed.
</p>
<p>14.3.3 The figure to be drawn is of a mythical first time that 
leaves an incremental absence to return to.
</p>
<p>14.3.4 The diverse specifications are so many indications of 
the fundamental lapse that has no meaning save as 
cause for the production of such means of indication.
</p>
<p>14.3.5 The blueness of the sky is an uncanny indication of the 
lapse. It may as such be seen as irredeemable prehis-
tory.
</p>
<p>14.3.6 The lapse is what enables the appearance of the day, 
and of the nighttime.
</p>
<p>14.3.7 The lapse by which the world has been provided will 
continue to evade the kind of fragile speculation it ena-
bles; in that such is not a thing, but an ongoing termi-
nation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>138
</p>
<p>of the contract
</p>
<p>14.4.1 The lapse may not be recognised as such without in-
creasing such as need for recognition.
</p>
<p>14.4.2 The terms are consequential to the lapse for which they 
signify both end and alteration.
</p>
<p>14.4.3 An apparent recognition of the lapse as the condition 
for whatever is must signify its deeper implication. The 
terms implied are pertinent to all that is perceivable at 
present; but to explicate these terms would be to impli-
cate another kind of immanent condition to adhere to.
</p>
<p>14.4.4 The terms implied are not to be referred to to decide 
upon the circumstance at hand, but irreparably im-
plied in its appearance to begin with. The perception 
of whatever comes before has been enabled by what 
cannot be remembered.
</p>
<p>14.4.5 Inherent to the fact that there be something to con-
sider are however many terms that have contracted in 
a past of which no memory may ever have existed; and 
which cannot be conceived except in terms that are of 
relevance to &ldquo;debt&rdquo; and &ldquo;absolution.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>14.4.6 That which is supposed as the condition for the fact 
that there be any thing at all may be conceived in the 
contraction of such secondary terms as have disquali-
fied whatever went before such observation.
</p>
<p>14.4.7 That the universe is debt is said to signify the fact that 
it comes after.</p>

<p>of the lapse
</p>
<p>14.5.1 The lapsing of the deadline is a fundamental breach 
that has to lead to termination of the contract. It is 
critical therefore to the effective operation of the con-
tract; or is critical as such an operation. The contract 
will imply its own occasional disruption.
</p>
<p>14.5.2 A breach of contract would allow for the emergence of 
a consequence that cannot be predicted.
</p>
<p>14.5.3 Only following a breach may something be.
</p>
<p>14.5.4 The deadline always alters as it nears.
</p>
<p>14.5.5 The approaching of the deadline slowly separates the 
world from its ongoing dissolution. It determines all 
that is, as well as all that is no longer.
</p>
<p>14.5.6 The postponement of the deadline brings the universe 
to light.
</p>
<p>14.5.7 A sentence would decide another deadline.

<p>&ldquo;W. dreams, like Phaedrus, of an army of thinker-friends, think-
er-lovers. He dreams of a thought-army, a thought-pack, which 
would storm the philosophical Houses of Parliament. He dreams 
of Tartars from the philosophical steppes, of thought-barbarians, 
thought-outsiders. What distance would shine in their eyes!&rdquo;
