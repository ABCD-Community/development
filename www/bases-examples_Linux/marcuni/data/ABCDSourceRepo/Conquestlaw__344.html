<p>This book has been long coming. The initial work was a project to examine 
the archives of the Livonian High Court (Sw. hovr&auml;tt), one of the oldest high 
courts established in the Swedish realm in the seventeenth century. It soon 
became evident, however, that the functions of the High Court could not be 
understood without setting them in a larger context &ndash; that of the entire new 
judiciary which was emerging after Sweden had conquered Livonia. As is so 
often the case in scholarship, the end product looks rather different to that 
which had been envisaged at the outset.
</p>
<p>At this point, it is my pleasure to thank people who have helped along the 
way. I do not think I would ever have embarked on the first archival trips to the 
Latvian Historical State Archives in Riga had it not been for Pia Letto-Vanamo. 
We delved into the High Court&rsquo;s archive together, and the results of those first 
trips were also published in a co-authored article. I benefited a great deal from 
Pia&rsquo;s expertise in seventeenth-century legal history and sources, which were 
not my strong point at the time. Because of her patience and assistance in the 
early stages, the many trips I made to the beautiful city of Riga afterwards were 
much easier.
</p>
<p>Tartu, which I like to think of as the spiritual capital of Estonia, has been 
just as fundamental for this study as Riga. Mart Kuldkepp spent innumerable 
hours at the Estonian State Archives, collecting material from the Livonian 
lower court archives for this study. Mart was always reliable, knowledgeable &ndash;  
and extremely efficient. The personnel in both the Latvian and the Estonian 
archives deserve special thanks for their flexibility and understanding. Marju 
Luts, my old Tartu connection and good friend, helped me enormously in un-
derstanding the Estonian and Baltic past and present a little better.
</p>
<p>During the past few years, I have been involved in many other projects 
and scholarly undertakings as well. If this work has one common denomina-
tor, it is the comparative method in legal history. Comparative legal history 
has emerged forcefully in recent years, and many of my good friends and col-
leagues in different countries deserve thanks for drawing me into these cir-
cles. I would be a different scholar had I never come to know people such as  
Albrecht Cordes, Serge Dauchy, Dave De ruysscher, Se&aacute;n Donlan, Markus Dub-
ber, Thomas Duve, Dirk Heirbaut, Jaakko Husa, Georges Martyn, Aniceto Mas-
ferrer, Dag Michalsen, Kjell &Aring;ke Mod&eacute;er, Anthony Musson, Peter Oestmann, 
Mathias Schmoeckel, Ditlev Tamm, Alain Wijffels, and James Whitman. Many 
of them have been instrumental in founding the European Society for Com-
parative Legal History and its journal Comparative Legal History, which have 
grown to be vital frameworks for me.</p>

<p>The last phases in making a book are always the most arduous and nerve-
consuming. As my research assistant, Sofia S&ouml;derholm has helped me with ev-
erything that needed to be done: a true administrative talent, Sofia has looked 
for literature, proofread different versions, helped with the index, and kept 
my files in order. With enormous accuracy and speed, Sara Elin Roberts copy- 
edited the manuscript and corrected my English. I am much indebted to Sara 
not only for her technical and linguistic corrections, but for her comments 
on the substance as well. Marcella Mulder at Brill has shown great patience, 
 flexibility, and expertise throughout. Last but not least, Mia Korpiola has read 
several versions of the manuscript and thus made this a much better book. 
However, it has not only been about reading texts. A passionate legal historian, 
Mia has always been ready to engage in discussions on the nature of compara-
tive legal history, and Scandinavian and Baltic legal history. Mia&rsquo;s wide knowl-
edge of literature, and her deep understanding of European legal history and 
archival work never cease to impress me. Despite all these thanks, all remain-
ing mistakes are my own responsibility.

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>1.1 The Research Questions
</p>
<p>This is a book about an early modern territorial conquest and its consequences 
for the law. Livonia became part of Sweden through the Truce of Altmark in 
1629. Before the truce, the region had belonged to Poland for almost 70 years. 
The second half of the sixteenth century and the first third of the seventeenth 
century were an era of almost continuous wars, under which the province 
suffered as a result of pest epidemics and hungers. When Livonia passed into 
Swedish hands, the region had therefore undergone significant economic, so-
cial, and demographic changes. According to some calculations, the population 
of what is now modern Estonia had dropped from the 250,000&ndash;300,000 of the 
mid-sixteenth century to a third of that in the 1620s.1 The chronicle of Thomas 
Hi&auml;rne describes a pest epidemic in 1580 in a sombre way: &ldquo;[&hellip;] within a short 
time period, an innumerable number of people had died of it, and there was not 
one town, castle, or village, where people did not lie sick [&hellip;].&rdquo;2 Because of the 
demographic changes, the manorial economy looked quite different after the 
Polish era to how it had looked before it. Many manors were completely or partly 
destroyed, and the surviving peasants had largely taken to other parts. The audit 
carried out by the Swedish crown in 1627 showed that in the 50 manors 
within the Bishopric of Dorpat, only 622 Haken3 were inhabited, and 1605 were 
deserted.4

<p>3 Haken was a land measurement typical in Livonia. Originally, haken referred to a tract of land 
which could be worked with one horse and plough. In different parts of the Livonia, haken 
could mean different things. As a result of the developing tax system, after 1500 a general 
tendency towards a uniform haken is discerned throughout Eastern Europe. See Ragnar Lilje-
dahl, Svensk f&ouml;rvaltning i Livland 1617&ndash;1634 (Uppsala: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, 1933), 23&ndash;26.

</p>
<p>As a result of the Great Northern War, Sweden lost Livonia to Russia. The loss 
went into effect through the Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710, and 
was finalised through the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. The major research question 
that looms behind the other, more specified questions of this work is: what 
happened to Livonian law during this &ldquo;short Swedish seventeenth century&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Swedish legal system, 
although it had been in contact with the Roman-canon ius commune since 
the thirteenth century, had retained much of its archaic features. Lawyers 
or learned judges were a rare sight in Swedish courts of law, and virtually no 
Swedish legal science existed. The University of Uppsala had been founded 
in 1477, but had been closed down during the turmoil of the Lutheran Refor-
mation. The University had been reopened in the late sixteenth century, but 
mainly in order to train priests.
</p>
<p>Whatever &ldquo;reception&rdquo; of Roman law there had been in Sweden, the layer of 
learned law was thin.5 Compared to the heartlands of ius commune, the layer 
of learned law in Sweden would also remain thin until the nineteenth century. 
However, learned law emerged in some form, and the seventeenth century was 
the main period of the reception. As was the case everywhere in Europe, uni-
versities contributed to this. A new institution of higher learning was estab-
lished in Turku in 1630 and another in the heart of Livonia, Dorpat, in 1632. Like 
their predecessor in Uppsala, both new universities were founded mainly for 
pastoral training. All Swedish universities had law faculties as well, but their 
teaching personnel typically consisted of one professor only.6
</p>
<p>It is no wonder that the universities, for a long time, did not constitute great 
centres of legal learning. Legal training was clearly not a priority for the Swed-
ish crown. The law faculties did not, however, remain insignificant. The facul-
ties gained impact not least because there was a connection between them 
and the high courts. If Swedish universities were founded late, Swedish high 
courts (hovr&auml;tter)7 came late as well. The first wave of European high courts

<p>7 It is debatable whether the Swedish term hovr&auml;tt should be translated as &ldquo;high court&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;appeals court.&rdquo; These courts were instances of appeals in relation to lower courts, but on 
the other hand the institution was originally designed to handle the crown&rsquo;s judicial duties. 
Moreover, a great part of their work, especially in Livonia, was devoted to first-instance cases </p>

</p>
<p>had started with the development of the Papal Curia from the eleventh cen-
tury onwards, and with the founding of the Parlement of Paris and the English 
central courts at Westminster in the thirteenth century. The Grand Council 
of Mechelen and the Imperial Chamber Court of the Holy German Empire 
(Reichskammergericht) then followed in the fifteenth century.8 The first of the 
Swedish high courts was the Svea High Court in Stockholm, not far from Upp-
sala, after which both Turku and Dorpat got high courts in 1623 and 1630, re-
spectively.9 The G&ouml;ta High Court, located in J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping, followed in 1634 and 
the High Court of Greifswald in Sweden&rsquo;s German territories in 1655. The high 
courts in Stockholm, Turku, and J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping were places in which local univer-
sity law students could gain practical experience as auskultanter, literally &ldquo;lis-
teners,&rdquo; in order to qualify for lower court jobs.10 The high courts were also 
some of the most important channels through which the Swedish legal culture 
communicated with its European neighbours.
</p>
<p>If Sweden&rsquo;s European connection came late and was not particularly deep, 
Livonia was different from early on. During the late Middle Ages and the Pol-
ish period, the reception of Roman law had advanced considerably more there 
than in Sweden. David Hilchen&rsquo;s Proposal for Livonian law of 1599, although 
never formally promulgated, is a good example of the extent to which Livonian 
law was integrated in the world of ius commune and especially its German vari-
ant gemeines Recht.11 Until the founding of the University of Dorpat in 1630, 
</p>
<p> of noblemen. I will therefore call these courts high courts throughout the study. The other 
option was chosen in articles of Mia Korpiola (ed.), The Svea High Court in the Early Mod-
ern Period: Historical Reinterpretations and New Perspectives (Stockholm: Institutet f&ouml;r 
r&auml;ttshistorisk forskning, 2014).
</p>
<p>8 On the development of European high courts, see the articles in Alain Wijffels and  
C.H. (Remco) van Rhee (eds.), European Supreme Courts: A Portrait through History  
(Antwerpen: Maklu, 2013).
</p>
<p>9 On the founding of the court see the recent account of Mia Korpiola, &ldquo;A Safe Haven in the 
Shadow of War? The Founding and the raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre of the New Court, Based on its Early 
Activity,&rdquo; in Mia Korpiola (ed.), The Svea High Court in the Early Modern Period: Historical 
Reinterpretations and New Perspectives (Stockholm: Institutet f&ouml;r r&auml;ttshistorisk forskning, 
2014), 55&ndash;108.

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>however, Livonia had no universities, and it boasted no legal literature of its 
own.
</p>
<p>The linguistic and cultural ties of Livonia&rsquo;s German-speaking elite had nev-
ertheless joined the province to gemeines Recht. In addition to the linguistic 
and cultural ties came the political connection: until the dissolution of the 
Order State in 1561, Livonia remained part of the Holy Roman Empire of the 
German Nation. This connection had always been vague, however, as Livonia 
never belonged to the German Kingdom (Regnum Teutonicum) but only to the 
larger and more loosely defined Holy Roman Empire (Sacrum Imperium). The 
essential difference between the two was that the Kingdom had common in-
stitutions, which the estates supported (such as the Reichstag), whereas the 
Empire was universal and more abstract.12
</p>
<p>The tension between the &ldquo;unlearned,&rdquo; archaic law of the Swedish conqueror 
and the learned law of Livonia constitutes the basic framework of this study. 
What happened to Livonian law when the Swedes conquered the province? 
Did the Swedes manage to establish their own legal system in the conquered 
territory, and to what extent did they even attempt to do so? What was the 
impact of Swedish legislation in Livonia? How much did Livonian procedure 
come to resemble the Swedish procedure?
</p>
<p>I will thus focus on three fundamental areas of legal development: the ju-
diciary, the procedure, and the legal sources. First, the establishment of Swed-
ish judiciary in the conquered areas will be addressed: how did the Swedes 
restructure the court system? In what way did they rely on the already exist-
ing judicial structures, and in what way did they import the existing Swedish 
solutions or invent completely new ones? How did the court structure change 
during the Swedish era and for what reasons? Questions concerning &ldquo;access 
to justice&rdquo; arise as well: Who used the courts at the different levels, or in other 
words, did the social standing of the parties determine in which courts their 
legal cases were solved? Did courts exercise judicial power effectively &ndash; was the 
judiciary an important venue for solving legal disputes? And what was the role 
of the High Court of Dorpat, founded according to the general Swedish policy 
(and thus, according to the model of the Imperial Chamber Court) in 1630?

</p>
<p>Did the High Court effectively supervise the six district courts (Landgerichte) 
within its jurisdiction, and to what extent did the High Court act a forum privi-
legiatum for the nobility?
</p>
<p>Secondly, the problem of procedure is pivotal in understanding the func-
tioning of any legal system, the modes of procedure reflecting the level of legal 
learning in any early modern jurisdiction. The ius commune civil procedure 
was still in the early seventeenth century an &ldquo;articled procedure&rdquo; (Artikelpro-
zess), in which points of legal disputes were formulated and enumerated in the 
form of so-called &ldquo;articles.&rdquo;13 The Swedish lower courts did not use this kind of 
procedure &ndash; how about the Livonian ones?
</p>
<p>As for criminal procedure, European early modern legal practice has not 
been the object of much research. We know much more about the early mod-
ern theories of criminal law and their development, for obvious reasons: it is 
much easier to read legal literature than archival material. In a nutshell, the 
problem left largely unanswered thus far is how inquisitorial did the criminal 
procedure become in the early modern period. The early modern legal schol-
ars spelled it out fairly clearly. According to the medieval and early modern 
procedural theory, inquisitorial procedure was always processus extraordina-
rius, secondary to accusatorial procedure. The little legal history literature we 
have on the legal practice, however, claims that in fact accusatorial procedure 
was already extinct in many parts of Europe by the fifteenth and sixteenth cen-
turies. I suspect, however, that this is not the whole story and that, at least, it is 
not the story for the whole of Europe.
</p>
<p>It is certainly the case for the Scandinavian region that the inquisitorial pro-
cedure had made relatively little progress by the early seventeenth century, 
never surpassing the accusatorial procedure even thereafter. As will be ex-
plained below, the level of low legal learning in Scandinavia probably accounts 
for this. The consequent use of the inquisitorial procedure required a judiciary 
that possessed at least some legal learning, as the examples from the European 
core areas show. Even more so can this be said of the conscious and intricate 
interplay and switching between the two modes of procedure. It is therefore 
interesting to examine in what relation the two modes of procedure stood to-
wards one another in Livonia. As I hope the comparison between Sweden and 
Livonia will show, the choice between inquisitorial and accusatorial modes of 
criminal procedure was not only a matter of how learned the judges were. It 
also depended decisively on the political structure of polity. The hypothesis

</p>
<p>I will advance is that the less politically concentrated the polity, the less likely 
it would be to operate its criminal procedure inquisitorially even though it may 
have a learned legal corps available.
</p>
<p>My third major research question has to do with the legal sources that Li-
vonian courts used. Inquiring into their use of Swedish laws inevitably leads 
one to ask how Livonian courts used legal sources in general. In addition to 
legislation, what role did the ius commune or gemeines Recht scholarship, bibli-
cal arguments, or statutory sources play? The problem of legal sources is con-
nected to a larger debate on medieval and early modern legal pluralism, which 
was typical of the early modern period. Wolfgang Wiegand&rsquo;s classic study is an 
important landmark. Wiegand shows how legal theory built on the idea of le-
gal spheres, of which the smallest and closest was always the primary one. If it 
did not provide the rule needed, there was recourse to the next larger sphere.14 
Providing one of the best accounts of legal pluralism in the early modern pe-
riod, then, V&iacute;ctor Tau Anzo&aacute;tegui has carefully tracked the gradual transition 
from what he calls &ldquo;casuism&rdquo; in Spanish colonial law to systematic thinking.15 
Yet few studies exist to show just what legal theory and its pluralism meant 
in legal practice: how were the different legal sources related to each other, 
how they interacted and how they were used in practice. Peter Oestmann&rsquo;s 
Rechtsanwendung und Partikularrecht im Alten Reich provides one of the most  
important of this kind of accounts. Oestmann shows how the different sources &ndash;  
statutes, customs, scholarship, and others &ndash; appeared and were utilized by dif-
ferent actors at the Imperial Chamber Court of the German Empire.16 As for 
the comparative aspect, a recently edited work on legal pluralism and the early 
modern empires is well worth mentioning.17
</p>
<p>Oestmann&rsquo;s study is a good example of how important it is to pay atten-
tion to how legal sources were worked in practice. At the same time, under-
standably, his results do not necessarily tell much about the relative weight 
of the same kinds of legal sources in other areas of Europe, or in courts other 
than the superior ones. Although similar theories of legal sources emerged 
all over Europe, the practical realizations of those theories varied necessarily

<p>according to the respective weight of legal sources and legal actors producing 
them. If towns were strong, town law was likely to be strong. If legal scholar-
ship thrived, literature was probably used in courts as an argument. If high 
courts had acquired an important position, lawyers would refer to judicial 
practice in their briefs. In order for the learned law to gain importance in the 
first place, learned lawyers were needed, and so on. Whatever the weight of a 
particular legal source, it stood in relation to other sources. This was a zero-
sum game: if one source was weak, others would replace it. The exact situation 
of legal sources varied from one region to another. What was true for Spanish 
America was not necessarily true for Germany, and what applied for Germany, 
was not automatically applied for Sweden or Livonia. The only way to find out 
about legal pluralism in a particular region is to go the archives and find out. 
This study is one such attempt to do just this.
</p>
<p>A few words on the methodology of the study are necessary here. Compara-
tive studies have become the order of the day in today&rsquo;s legal history research. 
Comparative legal history offers clear advantages, which traditional legal histo-
ry is lacking. This does not mean that the purely local could no longer serve as a 
framework of research. It certainly can, for the sheer fact that states (although 
not always national states) have been important law-producing entities long 
before they became primary motors of legal change. The point of compara-
tive legal history is rather that one should always be aware of the international 
context of the legal change. Sometimes, perhaps, the comparative context will 
show less in the final research report than in some other cases &ndash; but the con-
text should always be there. Comparative consciousness is not necessary only 
because it helps the researcher to test hypotheses, and to prove or falsify them. 
A legal historian needs to think comparatively in order to find out how legal 
influences and transplants move from one legal order to another.18
</p>
<p>A comparative Western framework is indispensable for this study as well. 
The situation of one legal order spreading to the area of another legal order is 
nothing exceptional in legal history, and neither is it exceptional in the early 
modern Western legal history. The spreading of Roman and Canon law from 
the learned urban centres to rural areas and from the heartlands of Europe to 
the outskirts of the continent is the paradigmatic case in point, for which it 
was characteristic that the learned legal systems more or less came to replace

<p>and suppress local customary laws. The learned laws often changed in the pro-
cess, amalgamating with the traditional legal orders. The emerging dominant 
legal orders were not always run by university-trained legal professionals: the 
victory of the English common law over the seigneurial courts and regional 
laws shows this well, as does the dissemination of German town laws, espe-
cially those of Magdeburg and Leipzig to new Siedlungen in Eastern Europe. In 
some cases, less sophisticated legal orders arrived on top of more sophisticated 
ones, as in the case of Germanic tribal laws over Roman law in the early Middle 
Ages. A myriad of examples exists; in fact, much of medieval and early modern 
legal history could be written precisely from the point of view of legal trans-
plants of the kind described briefly above.
</p>
<p>The concepts of empire, composite state, and colonization are important 
for this study. In the early modern period (not only, but typically then), politi-
cal power was often organised in the form of an empire, which Jane Burbank 
and Frederick Cooper define as &ldquo;large political units, expansionist or with a 
memory of power extended over space, polities that maintain distinction and 
hierarchy as they incorporate people.&rdquo;19 The concept is not easy to distinguish 
from that of a composite state. According to H.G. Koenigsberger, &ldquo;most states 
in the early modern period were composite states, including more than one 
country under the sovereignty of one ruler.&rdquo;20 Some of the empires or com-
posite states were also colonial polities. Colonization was not only a political, 
military, and commercial undertaking, but was always also a legal one, from an 
early period.
</p>
<p>It is not crucial to determine here how and whether empires are to be dis-
tinguished from composite states, and how a colonization differs from the 
other two situations. It is significant to recognize that in all of these cases the 
early modern polity, unlike the nineteenth-century nation-state with its all-
encompassing legal codifications, was flexible. As was true of all builders of 
empires or composite states, and conquerors in the classic cases of coloniza-
tion, Swedes were and had to be concerned with legal questions from the very 
beginning. They entered a province in a state of complete chaos caused by con-
tinuing wars, a region practically lacking any judicial or legal infrastructure. 
That infrastructure had to be created lest chaos continue to reign. Like Spain,

</p>
<p>England, and Portugal, Swedes had the idea of importing at least some of their 
own law to the newly acquired lands on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea. 
However, as we will see, these plans ran into considerable difficulties, the most 
important of which was the strength of the local legal culture. Sweden&rsquo;s wishes 
for legal colonization ought not to be exaggerated, however. As an early mod-
ern (colonial) empire or composite state, it was prepared to let the legal order 
of the new territory take shape according to its particular needs.
</p>
<p>As is evident by the research questions I have formulated above, this is a 
study on Livonian legal practice. The bulk of the research material comes from 
judicial archives. Studies on early modern case material are not abundant for 
any part of the Western world, at least when compared to the amount of stud-
ies undertaken on the legal scholarship of the time. Studies on legal schol-
arship provide an indispensable background, as one tries to understand the 
thinking of the early modern jurist. However, legal scholarship reflects only 
one part of the complex early modern legal world. The theoretical learning of 
the scholars is never, not even today, exactly the same as the practical outcome 
that courts of law produce. It is, and has been since the Middle Ages, the legal 
scholar&rsquo;s job to present the legal order as a harmonious system &ndash; which it rarely 
is in reality. When it comes to the early modern period, this is even less the 
case than it is today,21 even despite the fact that the early modern legal schol-
ars were increasingly approaching the legal practice and incorporating local  
statutory sources into their writings.22 Since specifically Livonian legal schol-
arship was not produced until the nineteenth century, early modern legal  
scholarship is almost no help for the scholar trying to form a picture of Livo-
nian law in the seventeenth century or in the preceding period.
</p>
<p>Legislation is not much more useful, as it depicts early modern legal reality 
notoriously badly. Written laws were rare, with the exception of police ordi-
nances, which poured out of the legislative machines at an increasing speed in 
every European state of the early modern period. The normative standing of 
written laws was, nevertheless, far less important than it is in the modern con-
tinental (and even common law) legal cultures. Yet, at least the early modern 
statutes say something about the legislator&rsquo;s wishes and development plans.
</p>
<p>Swedish laws were meant to be subsidiarily in force in Livonia as well, in ad-
dition to which the Swedish Crown issued special legislation for the province. 
This starting point will be discussed more in detail further on. As I have argued 
</p>
<p>21 Oestmann clearly shows how much the legal practice in the Imperial Chamber Court dif-
fered from the law in the books.
</p>
<p>22 In the gemeines Recht region, this strand of legal literature is called &ldquo;the modern use of the 
Pandects&rdquo; (usus modernus pandectarum).</p>

</p>
<p>elsewhere,23 written law had acquired a strong position &ndash; compared to other 
regions and other sources of law &ndash; by the early sixteenth century in Sweden. It 
makes particular sense therefore to ask to what extent Swedish statutory law 
was applied in Livonia.
</p>
<p>The question concerning the practical significance of Swedish legislation 
or any other source thus cannot be answered without consulting case mate-
rial. Livonia lacked legal literature written, for example, in the vein of Bene-
dict Carpzov, who not only wrote normative legal scholarship but did it largely 
by describing the seventeenth century Saxon legal practice. For other parts of 
Europe, law reports and printed case collections also exist from the medieval 
and early modern periods &ndash; but not for Livonia.24 Therefore, the only way of 
gaining an understanding of the law actually practiced in Livonia is by delving 
into the judicial archives.
</p>
<p>1.2 Archival Material
</p>
<p>The main bulk of the archival material which I have used comes from the ar-
chives of the Livonian lower courts in Tartu (Estonia) and from the archive of 
the Dorpat High Court in Riga (Latvia).25 All of these archives contain rather

the German Imperial Chamber Court (Reichskammergericht) and the Great Council of 
Mechelen &ndash; to mention just a few important examples &ndash; greatly influenced legal practice 
in these differents parts of Europe. Some of the collections were printed, others remained 
in manuscript. See, for instance, the articles in J.H. Baker (ed.), Judicial Records, Law Re-

thus, Dorpat and Pernau, instead of Tartu and P&auml;rnu (which would be the present-day 
Estonian equivalents).</p>

</p>
<p>large amounts of material, but they also contain significant lacunae. The court 
language in Swedish Livonia was German, with occasional documents in 
Swedish.
</p>
<p>The district courts (Landgerichte) were the general lower courts in the 
countryside. The choice of material from these courts has been very much 
determined by what has been available. For instance, the records of the Dis-
trict Court of Pernau are much better preserved than the records of Dorpat. 
Some case material exists for the District Court of Wenden, but material from 
other district courts (Kokenhusen and Riga) is virtually non-existent. As for 
the lower courts, my material includes the cases of the District Court of Pernau 
(Pernauische Landgericht) from the years 1632&ndash;1634, 1640&ndash;1641, 1655, 1675&ndash;1676, 
1688&ndash;1690, 1695&ndash;1698, and 1701&ndash;1773, and the cases of the District Court of Dor-
pat (Dorpatsche Landgericht) from the year 1632, 1666, and 1671&ndash;1673. For a few 
years, criminal protocols were been bound as a separate book (District Court 
of Pernau 1638&ndash;1645). The quality of the material varies from well ordered to 
barely legible. Of course, the amount of information contained in the proto-
cols and decisions also varies.
</p>
<p>As for the town courts, the protocols of the Council of Pernau (Pernauische 
Rat) have been read from the years 1667&ndash;1670, and the protocols of the Lower 
Town Court (Kemnergericht) of Pernau from the years 1662&ndash;1663. The proto-
cols of the Council of Dorpat have been included for the years 1660&ndash;1663. The 
Dorpat Council papers exist also for the last years of the Polish rule (1619&ndash;1623, 
1625), and those have also been included in the material to allow comparison 
with the Polish period.
</p>
<p>In the cities, as was common in early modern European towns, several other 
specialised courts functioned in addition to the council, which also exercised 
important administrative functions in addition to its purely judicial tasks. 
Separate courts decided cases dealing with market commerce, orphanage, and 
police matters. Lower consistories (Konsistorien) and the Upper Consistory 
(Oberkonsistorium) were responsible for the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and the 
University of Dorpat formed a jurisdiction of its own. These specialised courts 
have not, however, been investigated, with the exception of the Kemnergericht 
of Pernau (1660&ndash;1662), which was the court of first instance for civil cases in 
the town and responsible for investigation of crimes as well.
</p>
<p>The High Court of Dorpat, the appeals court for the province and the forum 
privilegiatum for the nobility, forms an important part of the study. The high 
court archives are now kept at the Historical State Archives of Latvia (Latvijas 
valts vēstures arhīvs) in Riga. The archival material is again limited in many 
ways. Because of wars affecting Livonia, the High Court functioned only until 
the first years of the eighteenth century, and the work was interrupted many </p>

</p>
<p>times before that as well. Its archives have suffered substantially from wars, 
and without Bruiningk&rsquo;s reorganizing and catalogizing in the 1910s the archives 
would be in much poorer shape.
</p>
<p>According to Bruiningk, many acts had gone missing as a result of the ar-
chive&rsquo;s evacuation to Sweden in connection to the Great Northern War.26 Bru-
iningk listed the acts he had at his disposal. He started almost literally from 
scratch, describing the situation thus: &ldquo;&hellip; the bundles of cases, of the 14,000 
of which until the year 1797 the old archive consists, formed a chaos, in which 
any trace of chronological or other type of an order had ceased to exist.&rdquo; Bruin-
ingk&rsquo;s catalogue covers the year 1630&ndash;1710 and includes 4,453 cases.27
</p>
<p>For some of the cases, Bruiningk has been able to mark the day of the High 
Court&rsquo;s decision on the dossier (although the decision itself is not necessarily 
in the dossier any more), and sometimes there is information on other proce-
dural phases as well. Later archivists have added information on whether the 
acts of a particular case are still to be found in the archives (or were there at 
least at the time that the archivist was working on the files). The cases are or-
dered according to the day they arrived at the Court. Only civil cases (Zivil- und 
Anklagesachen) are catalogued. Bruiningk would have wanted to catalogue the 
criminal cases as well, but he never managed to do that. The fact that crimi-
nal cases are missing in Bruiningk&rsquo;s catalogue is a lack, but not as serious as 
one might think. This is because the category of Anklagesachen included the 
criminal cases against noblemen, all of which were handled in the accusato-
rial procedure. Criminal decisions (in the contemporary Livonian meaning of 
inquisitorial cases) of the High Court exist for only two years (1672, 1675), in 
addition to which approximately 300 lower court criminal cases exist in the 
archive.28 The High Court&rsquo;s Leuteration cases, or death penalty cases remitted

<p>from the lower courts to the High Court for approval, are available as a separate 
collection for the years 1695&ndash;1703.
</p>
<p>We do not know how much of the case material had already been lost by 
the time von Bruiningk started his work, because original registers are lacking. 
However, it is probable that most of the files were still at Bruiningk&rsquo;s disposal. 
Although many dossiers are missing, we get a reliable picture of the kinds of 
cases the high court handled, of how many cases came to the Courts, the so-
cial status of the parties (at least roughly), as well as of the type of procedure 
in question. This is possible because each of Bruiningk&rsquo;s entries includes the 
names and titles of the parties, the type of case and the date of arrival, and 
sometimes information on the different procedural steps taken.
</p>
<p>Although Riga was part of Swedish Livonia, Riga, for the most part, has been 
left out of the study. This is because the town of Riga did not belong under the 
jurisdiction of Dorpat High Court as did the other lower courts of the region. 
Instead, the Riga appeals went directly to the Svea High Court in Stockholm. 
It was important for the elite of Riga bourgeoisie to secure an independence 
from the Livonian nobility, which, Riga feared, would gain influence on the 
city&rsquo;s legal conditions by way of the high court. Since appeals to Stockholm 
were costly and therefore rare, the solution must have seemed optimal for 
the bourgeoisie elite. Hiring a lawyer both in Riga and in Stockholm would 
not have made sense unless the interest was considerable. Most probably, ap-
peals were discouraged also because appellants could not be certain about the 
Swedish judges&rsquo; knowledge of Livonian law.
</p>
<p>The available material sets its limits. No unbroken series of court protocols 
exist for any of the courts above. Many case files dossiers are lacking, and in 
addition to this, many dossiers contain only a small amount of material. Al-
though the minutes for certain years clearly refer to documental material not 
exposed in verbis in the minutes (referring to the written letter of charge or a 
witness hearing, for instance, with the formula vide acta), most of the time the 
lack of dossiers does not seem to be a problem. Many of the cases are relatively 
simple and not lawyer-driven, thus not likely to have produced written state-
ments that could have been placed in dossiers. Witness hearings are almost 
always written directly into the minutes.
</p>
<p>1.3 Previous Research
</p>
<p>The picture of Livonia&rsquo;s Swedish period has always been sensitive to politics. 
According to Alexander Loit, the historiography has experienced three major 
phases. An understanding of Schweden-Zeit as a &ldquo;good old time&rdquo; grew out of the </p>

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>popular conception &ldquo;genuinely and without literary models.&rdquo; In the nineteenth 
century, a German-Baltic history conception adopted a positive attitude to-
wards the Swedish Protestantism, but was otherwise critical. According to the 
German-Baltic history conception, the Swedish period had been particularly 
harmful to the local administration. Loit sees this in connection to the Rus-
sification politics of the nineteenth century, arguing that the German-Baltic 
historians were anxious to show how independent the Baltic provinces had 
traditionally been. The third history conception, according to Loit, was typi-
cal of the 1920s and 1930s. During this first independence period of the Baltic 
republics, historians looked at the Swedish period in positive terms, although 
not uncritically. Swedes had otherwise been good to the Baltic provinces, but 
the position of the peasants had changed for the worse.29
</p>
<p>The legal historical literature on Livonia roughly follows the trends that Loit 
has sketched with general history in mind, but the legal historiography would 
be better divided into two periods. The first period would encompass the nine-
teenth century, which amounted to a virtual golden era of Baltic legal history. 
The local legal historians, all of German Baltic descent, followed the develop-
ment in German universities closely. Most of them had at least at some point 
studied in these universities and had come under the influence of the German 
historical school from early on.
</p>
<p>Adherents of the German historical school,30 most Baltic legal scholars 
were per definition legal historians, as for instance Friedrich Georg von Bunge 
(1802&ndash;1897). His towering figure dominates all discussions on Baltic legal his-
tory of the 1800s. After a career in the city administration of Dorpat as its le-
gal official, Syndicus, Bunge devoted himself full time to academic life as the 
professor of legal history at the Jurjew University (later to be renamed the 
University of Tartu).31 Baltic laws had not been the object of scholarly studies 
before Bunge&rsquo;s academic teacher C.C. Dabelow started pioneering the field in

ars have been branded &ldquo;Savignyan&rdquo; or proponents of the historical school, even though 
some (like J.L. M&uuml;thel and J.P.G. Ewers) shared little or none of Savigny&rsquo;s basic claims. 
Even Bunge himself did not, according to Luts, follow Savigny all the way. The process of 
the Bunge&rsquo;s Savigny reception was much more complex.

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>the early years of the nineteenth century. Following Dabelow&rsquo;s work, Bunge 
established himself as the founder of &ldquo;provincial legal scholarship,&rdquo; defining 
the legal order in the Baltic Provinces as a separate entity.32 The provincial laws 
were, before the work of these legal historians, not much more than a maze of 
elements stemming from many historical periods.
</p>
<p>However, the nineteenth-century German-Baltic legal history can hardly be 
described as critical towards the Swedish period. More than politically con-
scious, the nineteenth-century legal history of Bunge and his colleagues was 
positivist, avoiding stands either for or against past political power-holders. 
Bunge&rsquo;s stance towards the Swedish legal inheritance was a practical one: he 
followed the opinion of R.J.M. Helmersen, a scholarly active district court 
judge. According to Helmersen&rsquo;s practical opinion, Swedish laws should be fol-
lowed insofar as they had acquired the quality of customary law through legal 
practice.33 The attitude, instead of being measurable in terms of being positive 
or negative, was rather just practical.
</p>
<p>The second period of legal history in the Baltic coincides with the first inde-
pendence period of the Baltic States. The Estonians Adolf Perandi, J&uuml;ri Uluots, 
and Leo Leesment were all noteworthy legal historians who produced lasting 
results. Perandi&rsquo;s work on the peasant courts has greatly inspired some of the

</p>
<p>32 Luts, Juhuslik ja isamaaline, 278. There were in fact nine different legal orders in the Baltic 
provinces: separate legal orders for nobility, towns, and peasants in Livonia, Estonia, and 
Courland. Bunge produced a huge amount of literature, which can be divided into purely 
legal historical works and those with clearly contemporary interest. Only a small fraction 
can be mentioned here. The historical production could further be divided into source 
publications and actual research. Bunge&rsquo;s Altlivlands Rechtsb&uuml;cher contain the law com-
pilation from the Ordenzeit, another work entails the Russian statutes given for the Baltic 
Sea provinces, yet another one the sources of the Tallinn town law. Bunge&rsquo;s actual legal 
historical research comprises works on all possible aspects of Baltic legal history, such as 
the influence of Roman law in the Russian period, the development of Tallinn city laws, 
and general works on the legal history of the Baltic provinces. Bunge also produced works 
on general history, such as on the history of the town of Riga and the Baltic estates. See 
Luts, Juhuslik ja isamaaline, for a good bibliography of Bunge&rsquo;s oeuvre. Besides source pub-
lications, Oswald Schmidt produced a general presentation of the legal history of Livonia, 
Estonia, and Courland. Oswald Schmidt, Rechtsgeschichte Liv-, Est- und Curlands (Jurjew: 
Karow, 1895).

<p>passages of this book,34 and Leesment&rsquo;s archival study of the German Aulic 
Court and the Imperial Chamber Court is extremely interesting.35 Uluots, pro-
fessor of legal history at Tartu University, wrote his major works on Estonian 
agrarian history;36 he is, however, perhaps better known to the wider public 
as the last foreign minister of the first independence era. Much of the legal 
history of the first independence period thus clearly follows the nationalistic, 
peasant-oriented trend.
</p>
<p>The Soviet period produced little noteworthy legal historiography. Although 
a new school of legal history has emerged in the second independence period, 
contemporary Estonian and Latvian legal historians have mostly concentrated 
on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
</p>
<p>The twentieth century, however, did produce some noteworthy literature 
in the field of Livonian legal history outside the borders of the Soviet Union. 
The Swede Ragnar Liljedahl&rsquo;s Svensk f&ouml;rvaltning i Livland 1617&ndash;1634 (1933)37 is 
an older work on the administrative history of Swedish Livonia, but contains 
much useful information. Anna Christine Meurling&rsquo;s Svensk domstolsf&ouml;rvalt-
ning i Livland 1634&ndash;1700 (1967)38 concentrates on the judicial administration 
and is therefore even more relevant for this work. However, neither of the 
Swedish authors was able to use the archival sources behind the iron curtain 
and therefore needed to rely on whatever material was available to them. Her-
mann Blaese&rsquo;s work on the reception of Roman law is, although in many ways 
outdated, still an important reference for anyone interested in the influence of 
ius commune or gemeines Recht, also in the Swedish era.39
</p>
<p>Of the more recent books, four German works are worth mentioning. Ralph

</p>
<p>legal or political history, although the legal history of the Swedish seventeenth 
century, understandably so, only occupies a minor role in Tuchtenhagen&rsquo;s work. 
Herbert K&uuml;pper&rsquo;s Einf&uuml;hrung in die Rechtsgeschichte Osteuropas contains only 
a few pages on the Swedish period of the Baltic provinces.41 Much the same 
can be said about Dimitri Steinke&rsquo;s study on the history of Baltic private law.42
</p>
<p>The only monographic study on a particular theme of Livonian legal history 
of recent years is, as far as I know, Thomas Hoffmann&rsquo;s book on David Hilchen&rsquo;s 
law proposal of 1599.43 Although Hoffmann&rsquo;s research, naturally enough, ends 
before the Swedish period, he provides important background knowledge for 
anyone interested in the legal history of the Swedish period in the Livonian 
history. Hilchen&rsquo;s proposal did, after all, embody much of the law such as it 
stood at the height of the Polish period, and thus probably also at the begin-
ning of the Swedish period a couple of decades later. Hoffmann&rsquo;s research has 
therefore been more than helpful. To sum up, no larger legal historical work 
exists on the Swedish seventeenth century. This book aims to remedy part of 
that lacuna.
</p>
<p>In addition to the legal historical literature, a much larger body of histo-
riography exists from the nineteenth century onwards on many other fields 
of history. Works on economic, political, and ecclesiastical history have been 
particularly helpful for the understanding of Livonia&rsquo;s legal past. These include 
older works such as Leonid Arbusow&rsquo;s Grundriss der Geschichte Liv-, Esth- und 
Curlands (1890) and Die Einf&uuml;hrung der Reformation in Liv-, Est- und Curland 
(1921), Sture Arnell&rsquo;s Die Aufl&ouml;sung des Livl&auml;ndischen Ordenstaates: Das schwed-
ische Eingreifen und die Heirat Herzog Johans von Finnland 1558&ndash;1562 (1937), and

<p>1.4 The Structure of the Book
</p>
<p>To understand the Livonian legal development after the 1630s onwards, some 
background in the earlier history of the Livonian and Swedish legal orders be-
fore the Swedish conquest of Livonia is indispensable. Chapter 2 provides this. 
The purpose of the chapter is to identify the essential characteristics of both 
of these legal orders not only as compared to each other, but also within a 
broader European context. European ius commune and especially its German 
variant, gemeines Recht, will act as a tertium comparationis against which the 
characteristics of Livonian and Swedish law before the conquest will be as-
sessed. My interests here are, broadly speaking, about legal culture and legal 
communication. I will thus not deal primarily with &ldquo;black-letter&rdquo; law, but with

</p>
<p>wider phenomena such as law studies, judicial structure, openness to legal 
transfers, and the effect that the influences from European centres exercised 
on the two peripheries, Sweden and Livonia. Legal culture in this meaning will 
inevitably need to be considered within a larger social and political frame.
</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is about the reorganisation of the Livonian judiciary under the 
Swedish rule and the subsequent development of the Livonian courts. One 
of the first things that the Swedes did after the conquest was to organise the  
Livonian judiciary along the Swedish lines. The grafting of the Swedish judicial 
system onto the Baltic Sea province seems to be, at first sight, the most obvi-
ous of the Swedish legal transfers. The Landgerichtsordnungen of 1630 and 1632 
established an essentially Swedish system of lower courts in the countryside, 
and councils and lower courts (Kemnergerichte) in towns. The top of provin-
cial judicial hierarchy was the Dorpat High Court, which received a statute of 
its own (Hofgerichtsordnung) in 1632. Legal transfers, however, tend to change 
during the process of transfer. Despite the apparent similarities to their Swed-
ish counterparts, the Livonian courts turned out to be quite different in prac-
tice. Whereas laymen enjoyed a high status in the Swedish courts, in Livonia 
they played no role in the Landgerichten staffed by legal professionals. As will 
also be shown, the Livonian lower courts were primarily courts of the nobility. 
Peasants rarely ended up in the lower courts, except when the other party of a 
lawsuit was noble or when a peasant was charged with a serious crime. Tradi-
tional peasant courts operating in manor houses dealt with all other peasant 
cases. This is a clear example of how a different social structure can cause a 
legal institution, in this case a whole judicial structure, to look very different 
from the original after the transfer process.
</p>
<p>Chapter 4 deals with legal procedure. I will start with the civil procedure 
and inquire into the way the gemeines Recht procedure was received into Livo-
nian law. This is the technical side of the law of procedure, and it is interesting 
in its own right, because the way civil procedure is constructed tells a great 
deal about lawyers&rsquo; activities. Professional legal help was first and primarily, 
although not exclusively, used in civil cases. Criminal procedure is interesting 
in another way, because its development reflects the involvement of central 
power through the activity of the judiciary. This activity, in turn, will be ap-
proached with the help of a conceptual apparatus of inquisitorial and accusa-
torial modes of procedure. The functions of official prosecutors merit special 
attention.
</p>
<p>Chapter 5 focuses on legal sources. Again, the approach is comparative vis-
&agrave;-vis Swedish law and ius commune. Since neither Swedish law nor European 
law in general remained stable throughout the 80 years of effective Swedish </p>
<p/>

<p>chapter 120
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>rule in Livonia, their development needs to be appropriately addressed as well. 
As for Livonia, it will be seen that the reception of gemeines Recht retained its 
position and even advanced forcefully during the Swedish rule because of the 
close cultural links to the German legal world. Swedish written law never man-
aged to build a strong bridgehead in Livonia, with a few exceptions that will be 
discussed in detail.

<p>Chapter 6 concludes the findings of the previous chapters.</p>

<p>The Outset: The Livonian and Swedish Legal Orders 
at the Time of the Swedish Conquest
</p>
<p>2.1 Livonian Administration, Judiciary, and the Legal Procedure before 
the Swedish Conquest
</p>
<p>2.1.1 The Livonian &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo; and Its German Roots
According to a chronicler, the old &ldquo;Livonia [&hellip;] [wa]s approximately 100 miles 
long and 20 miles wide, a good kingdom, consist[ing] of six principalities, the 
Teuzschenmeister with its surroundings and regions, and five bishoprics, with 
the offices belonging to them, namely, the Archbishopric of Riga as the largest, 
the Bishopric of Dorpat as the most powerful, the Bishopric of Oesel as the 
richest, Tallinn the smallest and Courland, the most peaceful.&rdquo;1
</p>
<p>The Crusades had first brought Livonia2 into political contact with the 
Western world. The local peoples &ndash; Estonians, Livs and Letts &ndash; had traded with 
Norsemen, Saxons and other Germanic peoples for centuries, but were now 
gradually brought under German control. The official motive for the subjuga-
tion was Christianization, although more worldly motives were certainly in-
volved as well.3 As the first attempts in the 1160 and 1170s to convert the local

<p>1 Cited in Blaese, Bedeutung und Geltung des r&ouml;mischen Privatrechts, 7. There were actually five 
secular principalities, since the bishop of Tallinn possessed no temporal power. The Grand 
Master of the Teutonic Order and the bishops, as temporal lords, were vassals of the Emperor, 
although it was only in 1526 that the Grand Master (Plettenberg) formally acquired a position 
at the Imperial Diet.
</p>
<p>2 The emergence of Livonia in the thirteenth century has been described in terms of a &ldquo;politi-
cal order consisting of several small states (those of the Teutonic Order, the archbishopric of 
Riga, and four bishoprics) characterized by Christianity, towns, literacy, a system of fiefs, and 
other imported Western values,&rdquo; but on the other hand consisting of &ldquo;local communities that 
had undergone serious changes under the influence of the conflicts and coexistence with 
the crusaders but which had managed to maintain their rural character.&rdquo; Andris Šnē, &ldquo;The 
Emergence of Livonia: The Transformations of Social and Political Structures in the Territory

<p>populace to Christianity had failed, in 1198, the first year of his pontificate, 
Pope Innocent iii authorized the believers of Lower Saxony and Westphalia to 
crusade Livonia. The legal terminology developed for the Crusades to the Holy 
Land of Palestine was now effectively adapted to the need of spreading the 
influence of the Catholic Church to north-eastern frontiers of Europe.4
</p>
<p>Innocent&rsquo;s call resulted in a virtual flood of Crusaders, who were to report 
to Bishop Alfred in Riga. As mentioned earlier, the Crusaders were not only 
motivated by the zeal to win new souls to the Church. They were also driven 
by promises of fiefs in Livonia: this was the beginning of the German nobility 
in the region.5 The enterprise was taken over by the military order called the 
Sword-Brothers (Schwertbr&uuml;der), founded in 1202. The Sword-Brothers were 
probably not more than 120, and they came from various backgrounds. Accord-
ing to a chronicler, they were &ldquo;rich merchants, banned from Saxony for their 
crimes, who expected to live on their own without law or king.&rdquo; The Sword-
Brothers formed a heavily armed and well-trained military elite, and they man-
aged to subjugate the Livs and Letts, and finally the Estonians, by the 1220s.

on the Baltic Frontier 1150&ndash;1500 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2001), 21&ndash;44, 43; and Iben Fonnesberg-
Schmidt, The Popes and the Baltic Crusades 1147&ndash;1254 (Leiden: Brill, 2007), 255, according to 
whom the campaign warrants the term &ldquo;quasi-Crusade&rdquo; at least. Most research nowadays 
does not hesitate in defining the Livonian campaigns as Crusades.

<p>23Livonian &amp; Swedish Legal Orders during Swedish Conquest
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>A network of fortified convents, stone blockhouses, and hill-forts from D&uuml;na-
burg in the south to Leal in the north was constructed to secure the conquest.6
</p>
<p>The armed monastic orders laid the basis for the German nobility in Li-
vonia. The conquest of Livonia had been based on an agreement that the 
Sword-Brothers would be entitled to two thirds of the land as fiefs, whereas 
the remaining third would pertain to the Bishopric of Riga. It soon turned out, 
however, that the land did not yield as much as the Sword-Brothers had ex-
pected. This led the Order to press their peasants harder, which led to revolt in 
1222. After an unsuccessful Crusade to Lithuania, most of the  Sword-Brothers  
were killed in battle, and the survivors were placed under the rule of the Teu-
tonic Order, which now assumed control over the Sword-Brothers&rsquo; lands in 
Livonia.7
</p>
<p>Ecclesiastical administration began to take shape in the late thirteenth cen-
tury as well. A regular canon named Meinhard had arrived in &Uuml;xk&uuml;ll, on the 
D&uuml;na River, around 1180 and started a mission there. In 1186, Pope Clement iii  
(1187&ndash;91) consecrated Meinhard as the bishop of &Uuml;xk&uuml;ll. After the founding of 
Riga, Meinhard&rsquo;s successor Albert von Buxh&ouml;vden chose that city as his resi-
dence. Other bishoprics were soon founded in Tallinn, Dorpat, Oesel-Wiek, 
and Courland. In 1255, the Bishopric of Riga became an archbishopric, with the 
Bishops of Dorpat, Oesel-Wiek, and Courland as its suffragans. The Bishopric 
of Tallinn remained under the Archbishop of Lund.8
</p>
<p>After the subjugation of the local peoples, there were also other Germans 
who received fiefs in the region in return for knightly war-service. The fiefs 
were usually bought or they had to be deserved. It was an insecure life. The 
harsh climate was not their only problem. The Germans lived off the services 
of locals, who were forced to work on the estates, to build churches and castles, 
and to serve on the armed forces against their own people or outside foes.9 
Most of the settlers came from a rather limited geographical area between the 
rivers Ems and Elbe, and some from Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and Holstein. 
Most of the fiefs of the Danish king were German settlers as well, whereas 
some, especially in towns, were of bourgeois origin.10
</p>
<p>At an early stage, the fief typically consisted of a village, part of a village or 
several villages, sometimes even a whole ecclesiastical parish (Kirchenspiel). 
The vassal regularly appeared before his peasants in order to demand his tithes

<p>and to sit court. As the living conditions became better and more secure from 
the late 1200s onwards, the noble fief-holders began to construct manor houses 
and castles close to their fiefs. There were considerable differences between 
the noble vassals themselves. For instance in 1241, only 13 percent of the fief-
holders held 86 percent of the fiefs in the Estonian regions of Harrien and 
Wierland. Social mobility existed between the different layers of the landed 
nobility, and hereditary rules in particular could cause mobility.11
</p>
<p>A division into five rival small principalities thus developed during the thir-
teenth century: the State of the Teutonic Order, the Archbishopric of Riga, the 
Bishoprics of Dorpat, Oesel-Wiek and Courland. The five principalities formed 
the Livonian Confederation, the Ordenstaat, until its dissolution in 1561. The 
lands of the Teutonic Order stretched from the Gulf of Finland to Courland, 
with the lands of the bishoprics here and there in between. It was a loose unit, 
held together by a common Diet only, but in practice the Confederation con-
sisted of independent entities. In 1335, however, the Diet ordered the Grand 
Master to consult the estates in future before waging war and to submit ter-
ritorial disputes for the arbitration of the Diet. The strife between the bishops 
and the Order caused the Diet to acquire some additional political strength, as 
in 1422 the Diet of Walk decided that the four estates (the bishops, the Order, 
the knights, and the towns) was to meet annually henceforth.12 Despite this, 
the Confederation was far from centralized, and the looseness of the Confed-
eration proved, in connection to the Livonian War (1558&ndash;1582), to be its main 
weakness, as the principalities were unable to organise a working defence 
strategy, thus contributing to the final dismemberment of the Confederation.13
</p>
<p>The looseness of the Confederation was not only due to Livonia being a 
patchwork of five principalities. Internally, the principalities consisted of the 
lands of knightly vassals, many of which had acquired a considerable degree of 
independence at an early stage, thus benefiting from the continuous struggles 
between the Order and the bishops. The strong position of the knights of Har-
rien and Wierland in what is now northern Estonia stretched back into the 
Danish rule, and although they became vassals of the Grand Master in 1347, 
they managed to maintain their privileges. Otherwise the Order only rarely

<p>conceded fiefs, but instead ruled its lands through an efficient administra-
tive system, which was virtually the same as that used in the Order&rsquo;s Prussian 
possessions. The lands of the Order were divided into approximately 30 dis-
tricts, administered by the functionaries of the Order, from which districts five 
participated in the workings of the inner council of the Order.14 The adminis-
trative system of the Teutonic Order was thus fairly centralized, in contrast to 
that of the bishoprics. To ensure the military resources needed for the defence 
of their possessions, the bishops were forced to grant large fiefs. From their 
fortified castles, some of the vassals held large tracts of land in various bish-
oprics.15 The Tiesenhusen family, for instance, held fiefs in the Bishoprics of 
Dorpat, Oesel, and Riga.16
</p>
<p>The Ordenstaat ended in 1561, when Livonia became part of the Polish-Lith-
uanian state, more precisely, part of the Lithuanian Grand-Duchy.17 The legal 
documents governing the joint state were the following capitulation and union 
treaties: Privilegium Sigismundi (1561), Pacta subjectionis or Provisio ducalis 
(1561), Cautio Radziviliana (1562), Unionsdiplom (1566), and Corpus privilegio-
rum Stepheneum (1581).18 The essential feature in all of these documents was 
that they upheld the previous rights and privileges of the Livonian estates. For 
instance, the Privilegium Sigismundi and the Union Diploma guaranteed the 
basic principles of the Confession of Augsburg and the German law, at least 
&ldquo;until a law book [were] compiled on the basis of customs, privileges and case 
law&rdquo; (&ldquo;bis zur Zusammenstellung eines Gesetzbuches aus Gewohnheiten, Privi-
legien und Pr&auml;judikaten&rdquo;). The position of the German language as the court 
language was also guaranteed.19
</p>
<p>In the Polish period, the legal structure of Livonia was later construed with 
the help of the following pieces of legislation emanating from the Polish kings: 
Constitutiones Livoniae (1582), the first Ordinatio Livoniae (1589), and the sec-
ond Ordinatio Livoniae (1598). In addition to these came the Livonian legal 
products such as the decisions of the Diet, the Landtag, and the city statutes, 
the most important of which were those of Riga (the Procuratorenordnung

<p>2.1.2 The Administrative and Judicial System in the Polish Period
Administration as a term refers to a modern state, which in most European 
regions marked the beginning of the early modern period. Modern state  
organized administrative systems and bureaucratic offices, separate to their 
holder&rsquo;s persons and other functions.21 In a feudal state, which the pre-Polish 
Livonia was, no such modern administration existed. Feudal lords, bishops and 
their vassals governed their lands according to the rules of feudal law. Urban 
settlements either belonged to the domains of a feudal overlord, as in the case 
of the majority of Livonian towns, or had earned some degree of autonomy. 
Livonia, Riga, and Dorpat belonged to the latter category, although Dorpat to a 
lesser extent than the others.
</p>
<p>In the modern sense and in an attempt to unify the administration, the Pol-
ish conquerors established the first administrative system in Livonia. The be-
ginning of the Polish period thus also marks the transition from the Middle 
Ages to the early modern period in the Baltic region. The Polish governor (Stat-
thalter) now represented the royal power in Riga. The area was then divided 
into four districts (Riga, Wenden, Treiden, and D&uuml;naburg), each of which was 
led by a senator of Livonian origin. The senators had been accorded a seat in 
the Lithuanian (later Polish) Diet &ldquo;after the Lithuanian senators.&rdquo;22
</p>
<p>The castles and towns, and their lands, that had fallen to Poland during 
the war were organised into starosties (capitanealia), according to the Polish 
model. The head of the town government was a starost. In Poland, the trend 
had been to accord judicial power to the starosts (capitanei cum jurisdictione, 
capitanei majores), and the same tendency spread to Livonia as well.23 The sta-
rost of Dorpat received full jurisdiction, as the king in 1582 after the conquest of 
Dorpat expressly conferred the powers to the new starost Albert Ręczaiski cum 
integra et absoluta jurisdictione over the town people and those residing in the

<p>suburbs, and soldiers stationed in the town of Dorpat.24 This, however, led to 
conflict with the city council because the starost interpreted his judicial posi-
tion as an appeals instance in relation to the council.25 In Riga, the strong city 
council was able to maintain its judicial power through the Polish period.26 In 
addition, King Sigismund iii founded separate castle courts (Schlossgerichte) 
for Wenden, Pernau, and D&uuml;naburg in 1599, again following a Polish model. 
Castle foremen (Schlosshauptmann), with a landowning nobleman as his vice 
president and with a notary, presided over these courts.
</p>
<p>From the point of view of organising the judiciary, the Privilege of Sigis-
mund Augustus of 1561 already contained some important articles. According 
to Article iv, the administration and the judiciary were to remain regulated by 
the &ldquo;native&rdquo; German laws and customs. Article vi founded a Supreme Court 
for Livonia in Riga. The nobility was to elect the members of the court, and the 
king of Poland would confirm that election. The Court would convene once a 
year to decide appeals, and it would only be possible to appeal its decisions to 
the king in especially difficult cases. The Livonian nobility got also, according 
to Article xxvi and following the model of Estonia, both civil and criminal 
jurisdiction over their peasants.27
</p>
<p>Whether the provision of the Privilege of Sigismund Augustus concerning 
the founding of a supreme court in Riga ever took effect is difficult to know. In 
1582, in any case, King Stephen B&aacute;thory (r. 1576&ndash;1586) reordered the adminis-
tration of the Livonian Duchy into three presidential districts (praesidiatus): 
Wenden, Dorpat, and Pernau. Each was headed by a praeses, combining ad-
ministrative and judicial functions, although the judicial function only applied 
to minor cases. The starosts remained under the praeses.28 The jurisdiction of 
the starost in relation to the council (Rat) was, however, not clear. Theoreti-
cally, the starost represented the king locally and held the entire jurisdiction. 
In Polish towns, councils were administrative bodies not judicial organs and 
were greatly dependent on the starost, whereas the Dorpat privileges had tra-
ditionally established the council as the full jurisdiction and the right to the 
traditional law in Riga. The revised town privileges that the Polish king estab-
lished in 1582 liberated the towns from the jurisdiction of the presidents and 
the district courts. The appeals from the council now went to the provincial 
tribunal. The privileges, however, contained nothing on the council&rsquo;s relation

</p>
<p>vis-&agrave;-vis the starost, which thus remained somewhat unclear for the rest of the 
Polish time. In practice the council was not completely independent of the 
starost. For instance, when King Sigismund iii in 1588 enfeoffed the role of 
starost of Dorpat to Jan Zamoyski for his lifetime, it was expressly stated that 
the enfeoffment concerned arcem et civitatem Derpatensem with full rights, ju-
risdiction included.29
</p>
<p>In the towns, the town council was also the major judicial court and the 
appellate instance in relation to lower town courts. In Riga, the general low-
er court for civil and criminal cases was the bailiff &rsquo;s court (Vogteigericht or 
Niedergericht). Others included the courts for tutelage matters concerning 
orphans and their property and upkeep (Waisengericht), buildings and lots 
(Baugericht), ecclesiastical law (Kirchengericht), and luxury police (Luxuspo-
lizei). The commercial court (Wettgericht) heard commercial cases; and Amts-
gericht was in charge of cases related to handwork and guilds.30
</p>
<p>Dorpat hosted all of these courts as well, except for the church and luxury 
courts. The lower courts were staffed by council members, two or three for each 
court, and the council performed its appellate function in its plenary session.31 
Like Riga, Dorpat also enjoyed the services of the legally trained Syndicus,  
although unlike in Riga he did not have a cadre of secretaries, also versed in law, 
in his service. Each lower court consisted of two council members. When acting 
as lower court members, they would use titles such as Wettherr, Kammerherr,  
and so on. The council chose the Burgermeister from amongst its mem-
bers, and one of them was chosen each year as the presiding Burgermeister  
(der wortf&uuml;hrende B&uuml;rgermeister). Council members divided the various tasks  
among themselves every two years. Besides burgermeisters, Wettherre,  
Waisenherre, Kammerherre, Akzizenherre, inspectors of meat cutters, bakers, 
bearers, and miners were chosen.32 The court met often, for instance in October

30 The dividing line between a court of law and an administrative agency is blurred when 
</p>
<p>it comes to early modern courts. It is especially unclear regarding the smaller and more 
specialized &ldquo;courts&rdquo; above. The Waisengerichte, for instance, was responsible for organiz-
ing tutelage for orphan children and of overseeing their interests. See Katrin Roosileht, 
Vaeslastekohtud (Tartu: Eestiajalooarhiiv, 2003), 44.

besides the representatives of the Polish crown and the council, were the guilds. They 
also had considerable legal significance through their own ordinances. Guilds are not, 
however, at the centre point of this presentation. Two of the council members were ap-
pointed as members to the other town courts; in other words, a council member normally </p>

</p>
<p>1620 sessions were held on seven days, thus almost twice a week. The language 
at the council remained German, although occasionally Polish-language docu-
ments were introduced. Poles often used Latin in the documents handed to the 
council as well.33
</p>
<p>In the countryside, the district court (Landgericht, judicium terrestre) con-
sisted of three judges and two noble by-sitters, which a notary assisted. Each 
of the four (before King Stephen B&aacute;thory&rsquo;s reform in 1582, thereafter three)  
circuits (Kreis) had its own district court. As the manorial lord could delegate 
his judicial function to a steward, so also the feudal overlord would routinely 
nominate the judges for the lower country courts (Manngerichte). At a later 
point, the Diet (Landesrat) also took part in the nomination of the judge. The 
lower court also had &ldquo;by-sitters&rdquo; (Beisitzer) in charge of supervising the pro-
ceedings.34 They were noblemen, just like the judge, and were obliged to obey 
the judge&rsquo;s call to the office. The same applied for the law-finders (Urteilsfinder):  
they were to represent the same estate as the parties and were obliged to take 
office upon call. The job of the law-finders was to decide what was right in 
a case,35 according to the facts of the case and the legal customs. As we will 
see later, the presence of by-sitters and law-finders continued into the Swedish 
period.
</p>
<p>The decisions of the district courts could be appealed to the Senatorial 
Court (Senatorengericht), consisting of four senators, one for each circuit, 
under the presidency of the governor (Statthalter).36 After King Stephen B&aacute;-
thory&rsquo;s37 reforms in 1582, the number of district courts diminished to three &ndash;  
and the number of judges at the Senatorial Court was reduced accordingly 
to three. Instead of four circuits, Livonia was now divided into three presi-
dencies (Wenden, Pernau, Dorpat), and there was one district court in each 
presidency. The composition of the district courts changed and came now 
to consist of one judge, six by-sitters and a notary. Each presidency also had 
a lower judge (Unterk&auml;mmerer), who decided cases of land strife between 
</p>
<p>sat, besides the Council, in at least one or two other courts. See, Dorpat Council 1619

<p>noblemen. The appeals instance was also reformed. The decisions of the 
district courts and the lower judge could be appealed to a Judicial Assembly 
(Gerichtskonvent, conventus iudicialis). It was to convene twice a year in Wen-
den, and the Assembly&rsquo;s decisions were final, except for feudal land cases, 
which could be appealed to the king in Warsaw. The Assembly, however, 
never started to function.38 In 1600, it was replaced by a high court in Wen-
den, consisting of a Statthalter as its president and 15 noble by-sitters. The 
High Court&rsquo;s decisions could not be appealed to the king, unless a case had 
to do with the largest cities, spiritual property, or property strife concerning 
royal and noble property. In addition, Riga, D&uuml;naburg, Wenden, Pernau, and 
Dorpat now came to have castle courts (Schlossgerichte), which exercised 
first-instance jurisdiction in matters both civil and criminal regarding the 
personnel of those castles.39
</p>
<p>2.1.3 Criminal Law in Dorpat in the Polish Period
Relatively little is known about the Livonian legal practice in the Polish period. 
Bunge calls this the &ldquo;dark intermediate period between the old [&hellip;] laws and 
the new creation, which (the Swedish period) called to life.&rdquo;40 Little remains 
in the archives on the lower courts of the countryside, with the exception of 
archival material from the Dorpat Council in the 1620s.
</p>
<p>The town privileges, renewed by the Polish king, gave the council the right 
of jurisdiction according to the inherited local laws. This tells us little of what 
norms were in use. Criminal procedure during the Polish rule was organised, as 
far as serious crime was concerned, along the inquisitorial ius commune prin-
ciples. A case of a Russian called Olisky will demonstrate what this meant in 
practice. The court bailiff (Gerichtsvogt) was responsible for the detaining of 
the criminals and for bringing them to court. In October 1619 two Russians, 
Olisky and Sawka, were accused of the killing of Mr. Andreas Veyhoff &rsquo;s maid. 
In the initial inquiries it had not become clear which of the Russians was guilty 
of the crime. The Council now &ldquo;decided, that Olisky should be once more se-
riously asked, if he still held on to his statement of before.&rdquo; The Council also

<p>31Livonian &amp; Swedish Legal Orders during Swedish Conquest
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>ordered that if necessary the two suspects could be heard simultaneously (&ldquo;das 
Mundt gegen Mundt&rdquo;) to find out which one was guilty.41
</p>
<p>After questioning Olisky once more, the Council decided the same day that 
Olisky, &ldquo;[b]ecause he did not wish to confess and did not want the truth estab-
lished&rdquo; (&ldquo;der Oli&szlig;ky weil er in seinen redden Vnbestendikk vnndt mit der Warheit 
nicht herfier wolte&rdquo;), should be tortured (&ldquo;solte zur Tortur gebracht warden&rdquo;). 
Olisky seems not to have confessed, although this is not expressly stated in the 
protocols at this point, because the next day it was also decided that Olisky 
would be taken to the site of the crime in order to find out more about the cir-
cumstances of the crime (&ldquo;woe die Dirn sampt den kleidern hin geworffen&rdquo;). On 
the same day, 17 October 1619, Olisky was tortured again (&ldquo;peinlich vnndt mit der 
scharffe sol gefragt warden&rdquo;). Clearly, no permission from an upper court was 
necessary to initiate torture.
</p>
<p>The next day the Council pronounced its sentence. The investigations re-
vealed that the maid had first been lured to steal from her master, and Olisky 
had promised to marry her. After this he had murdered her by cutting her 
throat with a knife &ldquo;on the open street.&rdquo; A few points in the sentence are worth 
highlighting, because they characterize the decision and help to locate it in the 
contemporary European criminal procedure. The case, first of all, is classified 
as &ldquo;penal&rdquo; (&ldquo;peinlich&rdquo;). It was thus set apart from the civil cases and accusato-
rial criminal cases. Even though the case is a penal one, there is no prosecu-
tor involved. Instead, the case was &ldquo;Mr. Andreas Veyhoff as plaintiff vs. Olisky, 
accused.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The Council based its decision on Olisky&rsquo;s confession, both voluntary and 
the one given under torture (&ldquo;eigenen so wol gutt: als peinlichen gest&auml;ndtnis 
nach&rdquo;). This was the way the ius commune theory of the criminal procedure 
always had it: confession given under torture did not suffice but had to be reit-
erated voluntarily before the court.
</p>
<p>The Council stated that Olisky had acted &ldquo;against God&rsquo;s law and human law&rdquo; 
(&ldquo;wieder G&ouml;tliche vnndt Menschliche Recht&rdquo;). Olisky was sentenced to having 
his flesh twice torn with hot irons and then decapitated with a sword, after 
which his body was to be placed on the rack and his head on a pole, all this 
&ldquo;as a well-deserved punished and as a warning for others.&rdquo; On the morning of 
19 October 1619, the sentence was carried out. On the same day Sawka was set

<p>free.42 From the crime to the execution it took thus only three weeks, with the 
actual procedure taking only three days. This was also in the spirit of inquisito-
rial procedure. It was common, in ius commune, that confessed cases could not 
be appealed.43
</p>
<p>I will take another example of the ius commune criminal procedure and 
criminal law from the practice of the Dorpat Council. Witchcraft was, not sur-
prisingly, considered to be a problem in early-seventeenth century Dorpat as 
elsewhere in Europe. On 24 May 1623, Matthias Grabbe brought Merten der 
Kargus before the council. Merten had been subjected to a water trial and had 
not sunk. This was, according to the common European legal practice, taken to 
be sufficient circumstantial evidence leading to judicial torture.44 So it was in 
this case as well: it was demanded had &ldquo;he would also be subjected to the proof 
of torture&rdquo; (&ldquo;das er mit der anden Probe der Tortur auch solle belegt warden&rdquo;). 
The Council had its old protocols read to itself and noted that Merten&rsquo;s wife 
had already in 1619 &ldquo;confessed something on him&rdquo; (&ldquo;etwas auff ihn bekennet&rdquo;), 
which also added to the necessary circumstantial evidence. It was decided that 
Merten should be confronted with all this evidence, and if he still would not 
confess, he would be tortured. The Council, interestingly, wanted Matthias to 
promise in writing that the Council would be &ldquo;held harmless&rdquo; (&ldquo;De&szlig;en soll Mat-
thias sich verschreiben, das er E.E. g. auff alle f&auml;lle schadlo&szlig; halten wolle&rdquo;), and 
Matthias promised this. Merten however died in prison after five days. Accord-
ing to the executioner&rsquo;s (Scharfrichter) statement, Merten&rsquo;s neck was broken, 
and he had a loose tooth in his mouth. Reading between the lines suggests 
that Merten had died as a result of the torture; he had not confessed, however, 
which created a legal problem. Should Merten be buried in the sacred ground 
or not? One of the council members, Friedrich Haneken, thought that since 
Merten had failed the water trial and &ldquo;had already confessed before&rdquo; (&ldquo;vorhin 
bekennet&rdquo;), he ought to be buried by the gallows like a criminal. This became 
the consensus of the Council, which decided to let Matthias take care of the 
burial. Matthias said he would let the bailiff (woschna) take a look at the corpse.

<p>The bailiff and the Castle Court did this and observed, according to Matthias, 
that the neck had been broken, &ldquo;as if his neck had been turned around&rdquo; (&ldquo;als 
wehre ihm der hals vmbgedrehett&rdquo;).45
</p>
<p>Witchcraft was also brought up in the case against a peasant named Hans 
and his wife (whose name was not specified). But witchcraft is not the pri-
mary reason why the case is interesting. Instead, it shows how much leeway 
the court was prepared to leave for the parties&rsquo; negotiations even in serious 
criminal cases. Hans and his wife were charged with attacking burgermeister 
Claus Teschen, the wife using a knife, and of slandering him. The Council or-
dered Hans&rsquo;s hand to be cut off and the wife to be put in the pillory. Interest-
ingly, however, after pronouncing the sentence the Council stated that Hans 
and his wife could turn to Teschen for negotiations, in which case the Coun-
cil would refrain from further measures. The negotiation was successful, and 
the next day the court confirmed their result. Teschen would refrain from the 
charges, if Hans would place a guarantee (caution); he would refrain from any 
revenge towards Teschen or the other judges through witchcraft, burning or 
otherwise; and he would not acquire any land from the town of Dorpat. Hans 
produced four persons as surety before the Council (&ldquo;Matthiam Grabbe, Wiribe 
Jahn, Daris vnndt seinen bruder&rdquo;). They &ldquo;held out their hands and promised to 
guarantee all damage that the peasant might cause&rdquo; (&ldquo;dafur hatt er zu burgen 
gesetzett Matthiam Grabbe, Wiribe Jahn, Daris vnndt seinen bruder, welche be-
handtstreckett vor allen schaden so der bawr thun wurde, gut zu sein&rdquo;).46 The 
case, of course, portrays the desirability of social peace within municipal com-
munity. It was easier for the Council to let the parties contract on their prob-
lem than to impose a severe penalty. The case therefore also reflects the weak 
central power that the Council represents. The appearance of the four guaran-
tors or in fact, compurgators, furthers tells us of an ancient custom involved in 
the ritual settling of the case in court.
</p>
<p>The inquisitorial attitude of the Council shows well in a case in which a dead 
child was found in the courtyard of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church. Because &ldquo;the Council 
wished to inquire properly into the matter,&rdquo; it was announced publicly in ev-
ery church that &ldquo;each and every one should inquire into the matter in their

of extra members, &ldquo;capable of the Eastern language&rdquo; (&ldquo;der Ostnischen sprache kundigk&rdquo;) 
were added to the Council. Dorpat Council 1619, nae 995.1.252, f. 60 a.

was typical in the European criminal ius commune. In 1662 Gregor von Santen 
accused Martinus Lelack for sexually abusing his wife while she had been ill. 
The wife had herself talked about this, which had been heard by many people. 
She now denied this and claimed that her illness had caused such talk. The 
court ordered Martinus to take a purgatory oath &ldquo;on the third day.&rdquo; This hap-
pened, and Martinus swore &ldquo;on God Almighty and his Holy Evangelium&rdquo; that 
he had not committed adultery with von Santen&rsquo;s wife. The Council, however, 
did not quite believe Martinus and urged him to confess and not to &ldquo;burden his 
conscience with perjury&rdquo; (&ldquo;sein gewi&szlig;en nicht mit falschen eyde beschweren&rdquo;). 
Martin then confessed to sleeping with the woman but denied taking her by 
force (&ldquo;sondern es sey mit ihrem guten willen geschehen&rdquo;). He asked for mercy,  
which was granted because &ldquo;there was no way of punishing such crimes&rdquo;  
(&ldquo;keine mittel vorhanden damit solche vbelthaten m&ouml;chten gestraffet warden&rdquo;). 
The Council thus ended up in a kind of absolutio ab instantia,48 refraining from 
a hard punishment &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; (&ldquo;behelt sich vor zu gelegener Zeit mit 
scharffer straffe kegen beyde theil zu verfahren&rdquo;). Furthermore, the Council de-
cided to keep its decision secret (&ldquo;Hisce omnibus Senatoribus Silentium imposi-
tum ne ullam hac de re mentionem faciant&rdquo;).49
</p>
<p>In the case of Peter Schwede, a blacksmith, his wife complained about Peter 
treating her &ldquo;worse than any soldier,&rdquo; smashing in windows and sleeping with 
Russian whores. Peter explained his behaviour by claiming that his wife did 
not live with him &ldquo;like a wife&rdquo; should, did not kiss him or cook him food, which 
was why he was obliged to find other company. The Council first sentenced Pe-
ter to the stocks (Pranger), but stated that Peter could instead pay 50 fl. Should 
he continue with his crimes he would, however, be sentenced &ldquo;without mercy&rdquo; 
to death and his property would fall to the wife.50
</p>
<p>The case of Peter Schwede and others above demonstrate how difficult it was 
for the Council to take stern inquisitorial measures against regular, respected 
community members should they decide not to cooperate in clearing out their 
crimes, and how lenient the punishment often turned out to be. The Council 
clearly preferred settling cases whenever possible, as was done in the case of 
Lobot (a Polish worker, Reuter) and Nicolaus von Wicken, whose settlement in

<p>their case involving fighting and defamation (&ldquo;schl&auml;ge vnndt scheltwort&rdquo;) was 
recorded in the court protocols.51
</p>
<p>From all of the above, it is clear that the Council knew the ius commune or 
gemeines Recht criminal procedure and its inquisitorial variant well. Being fa-
miliar with the inquisitorial procedure did not mean, however, that the Coun-
cil would have have used it automatically when it came to serious crime. There 
was room for negotiation especially when the accused was one of the locals. 
However, when it was felt necessary, the Council did not hesitate to take the 
sternest measures against crime.
</p>
<p>In criminal cases, following the contemporary doctrine, appeals were not al-
lowed.52 In civil cases, the appeals from Riga went straight to the king and from 
other parts of the Livonian Duchy to the Statthalter.53 Town courts could not 
judge noblemen, unless caught in flagrante delicto. In such cases the court was 
strengthened by the local castle commander (Schlosshauptmann). If unanim-
ity was not reached, the case was referred to the king to decide.54
</p>
<p>2.1.4 Civil Procedure and Notarial Affairs at the Dorpat Town Council in 
the 1620s
</p>
<p>Civil cases in the Dorpat Town Council in the Polish period started with a 
citation, which the plaintiff asked the Council to deliver to the defendant.55 
The citations reveal that normal ius commune rules of civil procedure were 
followed, although a fully-fledged Artikelprozess was not in use.56 Ficken vs. 
Santen from the year 1621 exemplifies this. After stating that the advocate

<p>51 See, for instance, Fabian Mandelstett vs. Heinrich von Santen; Dorpat Council 1622, nae 
995.1.252, f. 129 a. The Council&rsquo;s willingness to settle even homicide cases was evident in the 
case of Pucke Tith&rsquo;s widow vs. Timp Hans. Hans confessed to having killed Tith with a knife, 
&ldquo;after the Devil had taken hold of him&rdquo; (&ldquo;habe der Teuffel zugetrieben&rdquo;). The court asked 
the plaintiff, &ldquo;what she wanted from the accused&rdquo; (&ldquo;was sie von beklagten begehren&rdquo;) &ndash; a  
clear indication that a capital punishment was not the only alternative and that the 
plaintiff could affect the outcome of the trial. Pucke Tith&rsquo;s widow, however, thought that 
since her husband had died, Hans should also be put to death (&ldquo;weil er der Entleibte Todes 
verblichen als solle der ander auch das leben la&szlig;en&rdquo;). Hans was thus sentenced to death 
&ldquo;according to God&rsquo;s and worldly laws&rdquo; (&ldquo;g&ouml;ttlichen und weltlichen Rechten nach&rdquo;), and the 
sentence was carried out after three days (&ldquo;Ad diem Sabbathi 27 Januarij fiet execution&rdquo;).

<p>Fabian Mandelstadt had personally appeared before the Council, the citation 
contained a brief description of the plaintiff &rsquo;s claims. The property of David 
Ficken&rsquo;s children had been left in deposition at the household of the late Hin-
rich von Santen. According to the claim, part of that property had been sold 
and some other part otherwise disposed of without the consent of the Ficken 
children. Greger von Santen, representing the Santen household, was now cit-
ed &ldquo;for the first, second, and third time&rdquo;57 and on pain of peremptory decision 
to appear before the Council on 20 November. Von Santen was to come to the 
Council either personally or be represented through a power of attorney. If the 
other party did not appear, the &ldquo;obedient party&rdquo; (&ldquo;gehorsam theil&rdquo;) would be 
accorded &ldquo;what is right&rdquo; (&ldquo;was Recht ist&rdquo;). The absent party would be respon-
sible for the expenses.
</p>
<p>As in criminal cases, the procedural forms in civil law were flexible and 
adjusted to the practical needs. In one of the cases the overseer of orphans 
(Weisenherr; one of the Council members) informed the Council that the 
mother-in-law of Hans Kro&szlig; had complained that Hans and his wife, after 
getting along fine with the mother-in-law so far, had now started to treat her 
badly. The mother-in-law wished them to move out and to return the house 
papers (Hausbrief) to her. The court decided to act &ldquo;de simplici et plano&rdquo;58 &ndash; 
summarily &ndash; &ldquo;to help the widow in her trouble.&rdquo; The next day Hans appeared in 
the Council and, although he appeared to be surprised by his mother-in-law&rsquo;s 
complaint because he had always treated her well, the Council ordered Hans 
to treat the mother-in-law in a way that meant that all future complaints would 
be avoided, and to make sure that his wife and her sister would also behave as 
good children ought to (&ldquo;also wie sichs frommen wolgezogenen Kindern eignet 
vnndt geb&uuml;hret, das keine ferner klag kommen&rdquo;). If the problems could not be 
settled within six weeks, Hans (apparently with his wife) would have to move 
out of the house and leave the house papers with the Council.59 Typically for 
the Council, thus, an amicable solution was taken to be the goal, this time by 
way of a summary judgment.
</p>
<p>57 This clearly refers to the ius commune practice, which originated in medieval law, and had 
been taken as part of the medieval Swedish laws as well. See Heikki Pihlajam&auml;ki, &ldquo;Sum-
moning to Court: The Influence of ordines iudiciarii on the Swedish Medieval Legisla-
tion,&rdquo; unpublished presentation at the International Conference on Medieval Canon Law

Equity (Berlin: Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1999), 48&ndash;50. At ius commune, summary procedure 
was often used in cases of personae miserabilae, such as widows.

</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Unlike in many other regions of Europe,60 notaries as a separate legal pro-
fession do not seem to have existed in Livonia during the Polish reign &ndash; and 
nor did they in the ensuing Swedish era. Notarial affairs, such as the drafting 
of contracts, were taken care of by advocates. The Council also participated 
in this: testaments, contracts, and guarantees61 were routinely recorded in the 
Council protocols. On November 4, 1619 Fabian Mandelstatt came before the 
Council asking for a copy of a testament that Chartraudt Hinrich von Santen 
had had the Council record in protocol on 10 October 1603.62 Contracts were 
also registered in the Council protocols, as when &ldquo;the honourable Herman 
Wetter as well as the honourable Christoffer Dringenbergk appeared personal-
ly before the Honourable Council, and they had produced amongst themselves 
the following contract, and asked for the Council to insert it into the protocols 
of the town of Dorpat and that they themselves would allowed a copy of the 
contract.&rdquo; The contract regarded paying back a debt.63 Estate inventories were 
also recorded in the council protocols, such as the one performed by the Coun-
cil Secretary Joachim Gerlach on 12 October 1621 on the estate of Claus von 
Wahlen. The inventory was undertaken in the presence of impartial witnesses, 
and Wahlen&rsquo;s belongings were carefully listed in the protocol.64
</p>
<p>In order for contracts regarding real estate within the city limits to be valid, 
the Council had to approve of them. Most of these were routine, of course, 
but sometimes the real estate sales could be extremely sensitive. The power-
ful Jesuits had an interest in widening their possessions in the town, and they 
regularly came in conflict with the Dorpat Town Council, which feared that its 
tax revenues and jurisdiction would diminish.65 In 1620 Henning Lademacher 
wanted to sell certain houses, which he had inherited, to the powerful Society 
of Jesus, the Jesuits, which needed more space. When the Council raised doubts 
as to Lademachers capability of acting as the seller on behalf of his supposedly

<p>dead brother and some friends of his, Andreas Gescher, the representative of 
the Society of Jesus, asked the Council to wait until he could fetch the Pater 
Rector to the Rathaus. The Council explained its worries to the Pater, and why 
the case had to be postponed until Lademacher&rsquo;s position be clarified.66 The 
Council asked the elders of the guilds for their opinion as well. The elders were 
strongly against the sale: it was &ldquo;against the city privilegia, because no inheri-
tance or land should be brought into the hands of the spirituals, therefore [the 
sale] could not be approved.&rdquo;67
</p>
<p>The Council and the elders decided not to accept the sale. The Council re-
ferred to the Riga statutes, which the king had given to Dorpat as privileges, 
stating that the town of Dorpat went by the Riga law. Paragraph 2 of the fourth 
part of the Riga statutes states that should someone want to sell inherited land 
(Erbe), he should first offer it to his two closest relatives. If they did not wish 
to purchase it, then he would be free to offer it to someone else, however, the 
spirituals were excluded. Because Lademacher had not shown the consent 
&ldquo;that his friends consented to the sale&rdquo; or, for that matter, that his brother 
had died, the sale could not be approved. The Jesuit Pater Rector complained 
(&ldquo;beschweret sich h&ouml;chlichen&rdquo;) of the decision. He claimed that certain noble-
men had previously been allowed to purchase houses, yet now the Jesuits were 
clearly considered less honest. And besides, the paragraph of the Riga law that 
was referred to must have been &ldquo;a new one&rdquo; (&ldquo;ein Neues&rdquo;) and the Pater did not 
think that the king would confirm it.68
</p>
<p>Insolvency-related recordings were common as well. Heinrich Nidderhoff, a 
&ldquo;burgher and inhabitant of Riga,&rdquo; turned to the Court in 1619 following a letter 
issued to all creditors of a burgher called Paul Wapler. Wapler had declared 
himself bankrupt. Nidderhoff claimed a debt of 131 guilders, which he had thus 
claimed &ldquo;in termino competenti&rdquo; and wanted this be protocolled.69 Privileges 
were needed to own houses in the town of Dorpat, and these privileges, given 
by the king of Poland, were also recorded in the protocols,70 as were simple 
debts and mortgages.71

<p>The court records seldom refer to written legal sources, which may be taken 
as a sign of the prevalence of customary law. However, the &ldquo;Polish Constitu-
tion&rdquo; is mentioned in a case concerning interests on a loan. According to the 
defendant, the Polish law declared that no interests were to be paid on loans 
for the period of war. The court accepted this argument, declaring that the 
debtors were to pay interest &ldquo;from 14 December 1594 to 1600 when there was 
peace&rdquo; (&ldquo;von Ao 94 den 14 Decemb: bis Ao 1600 als welche Zeit es friede gewesen 
zu verrenten schuldig sein&rdquo;). The reason was that after that &ldquo;a long-lasting war 
had started&rdquo; and because the debtor had at that time not been able to use the 
money for anything, he was absolved from paying interest for that period.72
</p>
<p>2.1.5 Summary: Sources of Law in Dorpat during the Polish Era
After forty years of Polish rule, the law of Dorpat showed little signs of Polish-
ness in the 1620s. If at any time in the history, it would be expected to find 
Polish influence in these last years before Livonia fell into Swedish hands. This 
however, is not the case. The privileges for houses were given officially in the 
name of the Polish king by his local representative, the starost, but the giving 
of the privileges was routine work and brought with it no invasion of Polish 
law to the town courts, of which the council was the most significant one. Pol-
ish statutes were occasionally mentioned in the sources, but they remained 
exceptional. The Polish officials, the podstarost, and the wozny, interfered in 
the court affairs sometimes when the interests of the Polish citizens or the 
Catholic Church were at stake. Other than that, the town officials were left in 
peace to administer the town affairs.
</p>
<p>The available sources leave open the question of how the Polish officials 
managed their own courts. Council protocols occasionally mention castle 
courts. What cases pertained to its jurisdiction and which law it applied re-
mains unclear. Judging by the range of different cases in the council proto-
cols, both civil and criminal cases as well as notarial affairs, there is a strong 
suggestion that the traditional Livonian town courts in practice enjoyed a full 
jurisdiction at least as far as the town inhabitants were concerned. The castle 
court was probably, then, in charge of the affairs of the Polish officials and their 
families residing in town.73
</p>
<p>If the town court did not apply Polish law, what law did they apply? The 
town law included elements of ius commune and German common law, ge-
meines Recht, in the spheres of private, criminal, and procedural law. The in-
fluence of gemeines Recht was particularly clear in civil procedure, where the

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>regular system of citations was in use. A bankruptcy law existed much in the 
same vein as in other European towns of the era. As for criminal law, statu-
tory theory of proof was observed, with its insistence on confession. Judicial 
torture, although rare, was used as well. The contemporary European termi-
nology, with poena ordinaria and poena extraordinaria as its backbone, was 
common.
</p>
<p>Although elements of &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; law or gemeines Recht thus exist in Dor-
pat of the 1620s, they do not overwhelm the reader. This obviously must have 
something to do with the amount of legal training available at the council. The 
council members, the Ratsherre, were chosen for merits other than legal exper-
tise. Although the membership was not hereditary by law, the Council&rsquo;s right 
to choose the new members itself in practice led to the membership being 
limited to certain families which belonged to the Great Guild.74 Nevertheless, 
although the council members were not trained in law, they probably acquired 
some practical legal knowledge during their long service periods in the council.
</p>
<p>The secretary of the court, instead, had legal training. Throughout the pe-
riod treated above, Joachim Gerlach served as the town secretary of Dorpat. He 
knew Latin, and was able to draw professional-looking contracts and perform 
notarial duties on behalf of the Council. As we have seen, at least three advo-
cates were active in the Dorpat council during the years inspected, and they, 
judging by their use of legal terminology, must also have been legal profession-
als. It is only logical that there was at least some legal expertise in both the ad-
vocacy and on the town council. The legal arguments of the lawyers needed to 
be communicated to the unlearned council members, and this cultural trans-
lation work was carried out by the legally educated council secretary. However, 
given that the Ratsherre themselves remained laymen, the finesses of gemeines 
Recht could not be fully utilized in the proceedings. The argumentation, there-
fore, retains a rough, simple flavour, although it not nearly as provincial and 
unlearned as Swedish procedure still continued to be in the eighteenth century.
</p>
<p>Although politically Dorpat in the Polish era had largely lost its autonomy, 
in judicial affairs its autonomy mostly continued. The appeals (protestatio) 
went to an appellate tribunal in Wenden, and was registered in the council 
protocols. At least in civil cases appeals were sometimes filed, although they 
remain rare. In the war-ridden country the practical affair of appealing was 
probably not easy or cheap.

<p>41Livonian &amp; Swedish Legal Orders during Swedish Conquest
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>The flexibility of the urban criminal justice and its tendency towards settle-
ments deserves to be highlighted. In the period of five years under inspection 
here, judicial torture was used on a few occasions and some capital punish-
ments were enforced. In almost all of these cases, the accused were outsiders 
to the town community. The actual town-dwellers had a much lesser risk of 
being subject to the harshest measures and could in most cases hope to be 
able to settle even the most serious crimes. This reflects the close-knit com-
munity values, both good and bad. Outsiders became easier targets for hostile 
and harsh treatment, whereas the small political community had the tendency 
to treat its own members leniently.
</p>
<p>After this glance into the everyday judicial practice of a Livonian town dur-
ing the Polish rule, Livonian pre-conquest legal sources will be introduced sys-
tematically. This is important because they formed the basis for legal practice 
in the Swedish era.
</p>
<p>2.2 Livonian Law and the Legal Sources: The European Context
</p>
<p>2.2.1 The Feudal Law
In the Middle Ages, Livonia evolved into an estate society. The estates &ndash; nobility,  
clergy, bourgeoisie, and peasants &ndash; continued forming an important structur-
ing element of Livonian society throughout the Swedish period and beyond. 
It is no coincidence that it was Hermann Bruiningk, an official of the Order of 
the Livonian Knights, who saved the archives of the Livonian High Court. The 
Knights had played a crucial role in the development of local written law ever 
since the Ritterrecht, the &ldquo;knightly&rdquo; or feudal law, was put into written form in 
the late Middle Ages. The German origin of this now needs consideration.
</p>
<p>German settlers took their law everywhere they went. It was in the form of 
the Saxon Mirror (Sachsenspiegel) in particular that their law spread eastward 
with the colonizers.75 Knight Eike von Repgow had compiled the Sachsen-
spiegel sometime between 1215 and 1230. It was a combination of customary 
territorial (Saxon) law (Landrecht) and feudal law (Lehnrecht).76 A Livonian 
version of the Saxon Mirror (the &ldquo;Livonian Mirror,&rdquo; Livl&auml;ndische Spiegel) was 
</p>
<p>75 Friedrich Georg von Bunge, Ueber den Sachsenspiegel, als Quelle des mittleren und umgear-
beiteten livl&auml;ndischen Ritterrechts, sowie des &ouml;selschen Lehnrechts (Riga: W.F. H&auml;cker, 1827).

buch,&rdquo; in Ruth Schmidt-Wiegand (ed.), Der Oldenburger Sachsenspiegel: Kommentarband

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>then worked out about a hundred years later. The Livonian Mirror was in many 
ways accommodated to Livonian circumstances.77 The Livonian version was 
shorter than the Saxon Mirror. Whereas the latter was a law of knights and free 
peasants, the Livonian Mirror was more of a general law of the land.78
</p>
<p>It was in the form of the Livonian Mirror that German law took root in Livo-
nia. The Mirror was both directly applied amongst the early settlers, and it also 
served as a model for the first written laws of Livonia.79 The first of them was 
the Feudal Law of Wiek and Oesel (das Wieck-Oeselsche Lehnrecht), consisting 
of the Oldest Knightly Law, and the peasant law of Wieck.80
</p>
<p>The history of medieval Livonian legislation is complex. The laws that had 
made up the Wieck-Oeselsche Lehnrecht were later to form the so-called Knight-
ly Laws (Ritterrechte). The first of these was the Oldest Knightly Law (&Auml;ltestes 
Livl&auml;ndisches Ritterrecht) or the Riga Knightly Law from the early fourteenth 
century. Middle Livonian Knightly Law (Mittleres Livl&auml;ndisches Ritterrecht), 
based on the previous laws, was committed to writing in the late fourteenth 
or early fifteenth century. The dating of the so-called Reformed Knightly Law 
(Umgearbeitetes Ritterrecht, or The Common Episcopal Laws in the Bishopric 
of Riga, called the Knightly Laws, &ldquo;de gemeenen stichtischen Rechte ym Sticht 
van Riga, geheten dat Ridderrecht&rdquo;) has remained unclear. According to Bunge, 
it was probably finished either in the fifteenth or sixteenth century.81 Von Brui-
ningk disagreed, mainly because the Law does not reflect the changes that the 
Roman-Canon law had brought into procedural law, as one might have ex-
pected. The treaties made regarding runaway peasants and certain inheritance 
questions do not seem to have caught the attention of the unknown compiler 
of the Reformed Knightly Law, which leads von Bruiningk so assume that the 
Law must have been compiled very soon after the Middle Knightly Law in the 
early fifteenth century.82 Blaese would date the law to the latter half of the fif-
teenth century, because he sees no reason for the law to have been reformed so 
</p>
<p>77 The parts of the Saxon Mirror that had no practical relevance in Livonia were left out of 
the Livonian Mirror, such as the articles concerning the Verfassung of the Empire, judicial 
duel, and Jews. Blaese, Bedeutung und Geltung des r&ouml;mischen Privatrechts, 16&ndash;17.

</p>
<p>soon.83 The problem cannot be solved here. Bruiningk&rsquo;s dating seems correct, 
nevertheless. We now know, for instance, that Roman-canon law was received 
into the practice of German and Livonian courts by the early sixteenth century.
</p>
<p>It was the Middle Knightly Law which acquired the greatest practical im-
portance in the long run. The collection consisted of 249 articles. The statute 
consists of feudal law,84 law of inheritance, and police and criminal law. The 
Law was printed in 1537, and it was this version, originally in Plattdeutsch, but 
later translated into High German, that continued as the official law text un-
til the nineteenth century.85 This written statement of local law was thus in 
force during the Swedish period. It must, however, be emphasized that the Rit-
terrecht was just one source of Livonian law dealing with the nobility. Others 
included conventions sealed between the Bishops and the Knightly Orders on 
one side and the subjugated clans on the other side; the peace treaties between 
the different Landesherren and the estates; and the decisions of the Landtage.86 
But the validity of the Ritterrechte or other written sources of customary law 
obviously did not rest on their being in writing, but in the extent that they were 
de facto &ldquo;found&rdquo; to be law in day-to-day court proceedings carried out by lay 
judges, Sch&ouml;ffen, in their courts. The written customary laws, obviously, did not 
contain all of the legal customs.87
</p>
<p>Medieval law was polycentric by nature, and Livonian law was no different 
to other European laws in this respect. In addition to customary and feudal 
legal bodies, represented by the Ritterrechte, there were several significant bod-
ies of law gaining in importance during the Middle Ages: Roman law, canon

of the Livonian colonization and before the consolidation of the Ritterrecht, as Bunge 
did? Hermann Blaese denies this. He explains Bunge&rsquo;s enthusiasm for a common Livo-
nian land law by the fact that Bunge also constructed such &ldquo;common&rdquo; norms of Baltic 
private law when drafting the Baltic Private Law Code of 1864. Blaese, Bedeutung und

<p>law, town law, and royal law. Like the customary laws, these bodies of law also 
had a strong connection to Germany.
</p>
<p>2.2.2 The Urban Law in Livonia
In medieval Europe, urban law travelled with colonizers and formed fami-
lies.88 In France, the laws of Loisin, Beaumant-en-Argonne, and Soissons were 
the most widespread, and the major cities of Flanders also adopted identical 
laws.89 As for Germany, Magdeburg law was the source of some 80 central and 
eastern European cities founded as a result of the Ostsiedlung.90 The Baltic cit-
ies followed German models as well. L&uuml;beck law became the law of the town 
of Tallinn, whereas Riga adopted the law of Hamburg. Many smaller towns in 
Livonia, such as Hapsal, then received the Riga law.91
</p>
<p>Bishop Albert of Buxhoevden (ca. 1165&ndash;1229), however, modelled the first 
Riga law according to the model of Visby. It has been a disputed question 
whether Albert actually transplanted the whole of Visby law.92 Nevertheless, 
eight articles have remained, and they consist of privileges accorded to Riga&rsquo;s 
merchants. These included, for instance, the right to bear arms, the right to 
mint Gotland coins, and the exemption from judicial ordeals and customs. 
Killing a man led, according to the statute, to a punishment of 40 marks, and  
it was also declared that no new guilds could be founded without the  
consent of the bishop, who was also the highest judge in the city (principale 
iudicium).93

91 The lord of a new town would grant it the law of a mother city, the Sch&ouml;ffen, from which 
</p>
<p>he would prepare a new edition of the law and then hand it over to the representatives of 
the daughter city. The taking of a new urban charter resembled, according to Harold Ber-
man, a sacrament: &ldquo;it both symbolized and effectuated the formation of the community 
and the establishment of the community&rsquo;s law.&rdquo; Urban law was, thus, essentially com-
munitarian by character. Cities were often founded solemnly by a collective oath, which 
obliged the citizens to respect the charter that was read aloud to them. Berman, Law and 
Revolution, 393.

<p>Albert had meant the whole Law of Visby to be in force in Riga, or only the eight para-
graphs. In 1225, Wilhelm of Modena, as the papal legate, resolved the question in favour  </p>

</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>The first version of the actual Riga law was put into writing in the early thir-
teenth century.94 The Hamburg law (of 1270), then, was adopted sometime 
between 1279 and 1285. Riga had close relations with Hamburg, whose stat-
utes were also one of the most advanced in the Hanseatic region. The Riga 
city law was soon reformed, however, probably in the late thirteenth or early 
fourteenth century (the so-called Reformed Statutes, Umgearbeitete Statuten). 
The Reformed Statutes included paragraphs on many different areas. City ad-
ministration, marriage, inheritance, as well as serious crimes such as battery, 
robbery, theft, and forgery, were covered. Maritime law was devoted a part of 
its own.95
</p>
<p>During the Polish rule, towns developed their statutes just as independently 
as before. The Council of Riga published, to name but some of the most sig-
nificant pieces of statute law, a new Court Order (Gerichtsordnung) in 1581 and 
an Ordinance of Guardianship (Vorm&uuml;nderordnung) in 1591. In the early 1600s, 
plans for a wholesale revision of town law emerged, but nothing came of it.96
</p>
<p>However, civil law questions were largely left untouched, which probably 
left room for ius commune. The Reformed Statutes stayed in force until 1673, 
well into the Swedish period. The Riga law was adopted by other Livonian 
towns as well. Reval (Tallinn) adopted it in 1225 (although it abandoned the 
Hamburg/Riga law for L&uuml;beck law in 1248), Hapsal in 1279, and Pernau in 1318. 
Hafenpoth, Goldingen, Windau, Pilten, Fellin, Dorpat, Wenden, Wolmar, and 
probably some other townships adopted the Riga law for use during the Mid-
dle Ages and the early modern era. The towns also followed the later develop-
ment of Riga&rsquo;s urban law and tended to adopt the same changes to the law that 
Riga did.97 It may thus be said that Riga law acquired the position of common 
urban law in medieval and early modern Livonia.98
</p>
<p>In addition to the city statutes, Burspraken formed an important part of 
town law. They were statutes issued by the town council, which were read pub-
licly once a year and also included in the collection of Burspraken.99

<p>of the strict interpretation. Even after this decision, however, the problem cropped up a 
few times in the remaining centuries of the Middle Ages. See Bunge, Einleitung, 133&ndash;139.

ly Wesenbeck and Narva.

</p>
<p>Wars and political changes also changed the situation of the towns. In 1562, 
the Polish king gained lordship over Riga, and it took until 1581 before the old 
privileges were partly confirmed (Privilegium Stephaneum). The limitations 
on the freedom of religion that the Poles had introduced were lifted in the 
Swedish era, although King Gustav Adolf (r. 1611&ndash;1632) left the institution of 
Burggraf &ndash; a representative of the king in the city council &ndash; in place.100 A roy-
al privilege confirmed Dorpat its old Riga law in 1582, with the exception of 
some important limitations. The starost as a representative shared some of the 
council&rsquo;s judicial power and, although the town dwellers were basically guar-
anteed freedom of religion, it now had to be exercised under the shadow of the 
Catholic Reform. The confirmation of the old town privileges had to wait until 
the Swedish period: Gustav Adolf renewed them in 1626 and Queen Christina  
(r. 1632&ndash;1654) again in 1645. During the Swedish period, the smaller towns were 
enfeoffed to the Swedish magnates: Wenden and Wolmar to Axel Oxenstierna 
(1583&ndash;1654), Fellin and Hapsal to Jacob de la Gardie (1583&ndash;1652), Weissenstein 
to Leonhart Torstenson (1603&ndash;1651), Wesenberg first to the Brederode family 
and then to the Tiesenhausens, and Pernau to the Thurns.101
</p>
<p>2.2.3 The Manorial Law
Manorial law was one of the medieval bodies of law that acquired a written 
form in many European regions after the Renaissance of legal science in the 
twelfth century. Legal historians have, however, remained surprisingly silent 
on the matter, with Harold Berman forming the major exception.102 Peasants &ndash;  
like clergy, townspeople, and the nobility &ndash; were in many parts of Europe gov-
erned by their own legal rules, regulating the life of peasant communities, the 
villages. This is the part of law whose concrete contents are often the most dif-
ficult to find out because it has rarely left written traces. Manorial law can be 
defined as governing lord-peasant relations, in contrast to the closely related 
feudal law, which regulated the relations between lords and vassals. Manorial

101 von zur M&uuml;hlen, &ldquo;Das Ostbaltikum unter Herrschaft,&rdquo; 216, 220.
102 Berman&rsquo;s principal argument on the topic in his path-breaking Law and Revolution (1983) 
</p>
<p>was that manorial custom transformed into a system of manorial law between 1050 and 
1150. The argument about the systematization of manorial law, based on little evidence, 
is not among the best-founded in the book. See Heikki Pihlajam&auml;ki, &ldquo;Berman&rsquo;s Best  
Pupils? The Reception of Law and Revolution in Finland,&rdquo; Rechtsgeschichte &ndash; Legal History 
21 (2013), 212&ndash;214.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>47Livonian &amp; Swedish Legal Orders during Swedish Conquest
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>law regulated and set limits for the services rendered by the serfs to the lords, 
thus balancing the interests, and reciprocal rights of the lord and the serfs.103
</p>
<p>Manorial law was a prerogative of the lord, an integral part of the fief, 
 although most lords exercised &ldquo;low justice&rdquo; (minor affairs) only, whereas the 
&ldquo;high justice&rdquo; (cases involving death punishments) was reserved for royal 
courts. Manorial law was typically administered by &ldquo;an assembly of members 
of the manor, including the serfs, who participated in adjudication of disputes 
under the presidency of the lord&rsquo;s official, the steward.&rdquo; The administration of 
law was thus usually delegated to the lord&rsquo;s steward, whereas the lord himself 
rarely took part in the proceedings.104
</p>
<p>Livonian manorial law (Bauerrecht) turned into ius scriptum early. Leonid 
Arbusow, in the 1920s, remarked that the main events in fixing the Livonian 
feudal law into writing ran parallel to the emergence of the written expres-
sions of the Livonian manorial law. For Arbusow, manorial law could only be 
understood within the framework of &ldquo;the totality of peasant conditions&rdquo; (&ldquo;der 
gesamten b&auml;uerlichen Verh&auml;ltnisse&rdquo;).105 As collections of both Livonian feudal 
and manorial law are considered, the fourteenth century was the decisive pe-
riod of growth, and in the fifteenth century, the development of written law in 
these fields continued in the form of privileges.106
</p>
<p>Written sources of feudal and manorial law are, needless to say, just one 
way of describing and approaching the matter. Lacking court records, we have 
no way of knowing how and whether the written sources were applied, and 
to what extent local legal customs differed from one another. Fortunately 
other sources exist. They help us to understand the procedure, although less 
the substantive law. Balthasar Russow, a famous sixteenth-century chronicler, 
informs us about Livonian manorial courts.107 Russow talks about the &ldquo;oldest 
peasants&rdquo; as being in charge of acting as law-finders, and also states that their 
number was three or four. We are told that in civil cases (b&uuml;rgerliche Sachen) 
the Rechtsfinder not only evaluated the evidence after hearing the plaintiff 
and the answer to that, but also pronounced the decision. The source thus lets 
us understand that civil cases amongst peasants were decided by their own

<p> law-finders, without the lord&rsquo;s interference.108 If the case was criminal, the law 
finding of the peasants was subject to the scrutiny of three sworn noblemen 
as by-sitters (Beisitzer). They could accept the sentence or change it in either 
direction according to the circumstances, but they probably could not touch 
the guilty verdict.109 David Hilchen&rsquo;s Landrechtsentwurf of 1599 does not men-
tion law-finders, but states that &ldquo;whenever between a landed nobleman and 
his peasants a case emerges, where the court must decide over blood, he shall 
not take the decision in consultation and presence of other noblemen, as it has 
been done in olden days [&hellip;].&rdquo;110 One piece information is still worth pointing 
out. In 1601, the conflict between King Sigismund of Poland and Duke Karl had 
escalated to a state of war. At this point, Karl met with the representatives of 
the Livonian Order, who had plans to have Livonia incorporated into Sweden. 
The Livonian knights informed the Duke, among other things, about the way 
Livonian judiciary was built. The Privileges of King Sigismund ii had guaran-
teed the manorial lords a full jurisdiction in both civil and criminal courts over 
the people residing on the manor &ndash; mostly peasants, of course. The lord did 
not, however, exercise the jurisdiction himself; instead, his steward mostly pre-
sided over the court whereas the most respected peasants, &ldquo;die eltesten,&rdquo; were 
involved as members of the court.111
</p>
<p>108 Perandi says that there were six law-finders. The difference may be explained by the 
fact that Perandi speaks on the basis of the Dorpat District Courts protocols from 1632, 
whereas Russow wrote his chronicle about half a century earlier. See Adolf Perandi, Das 
ordentliche Verfahren in b&uuml;rgerlichen Streitsachen vor dem estl&auml;ndischen Oberlandgericht 
zur schwedischen Zeit (Tartu: Verlag des estnischen Zentralarchivs, 1938), 51&ndash;52.

</p>
<p>As will be shown later, both the institution of law-finders as well as that of 
noble by-sitters was still found in Livonia in the early years of the Swedish rule. 
Adolf Perandi, an eminent Estonian legal historian, claimed in an article from 
1931 that the manorial lords had never actually possessed full judicial power, 
which had they had supposedly been granted by Sigismund&rsquo;s Gnade in 1561. 
Instead, the power of the lords had always fallen short of the judicial power 
that was invested in the manorial courts (Bauergerichte), because of the com-
petence of the law-finders in both civil and criminal cases.112
</p>
<p>The Swedish judicial reform of 1630 and 1632, traditionally celebrated as a 
major advance and a &ldquo;golden period&rdquo; in Livonian history, had actually, accord-
ing to Perandi, brought about a virtual destruction of the peasants&rsquo; right to 
decide their own legal problems in their own courts. Perandi&rsquo;s view, however, 
is exaggerated. For one thing, although it is true that the manorial lords never 
possessed full judicial power, it was hardly in their interest to assume such 
powers. A comparative look at manorial law shows that European manorial 
lords gave away only those parts of their jurisdiction which were not important 
to them from the point of view of maintaining control over the peasants resid-
ing on their lands. Thus, the peasants got to decide petty crimes, their internal 
debts, slander cases, and other minor legal affairs, which were of lesser interest 
to the lord &ndash; as long as peace was maintained.
</p>
<p>The peasants were not only allowed to decide these cases; in fact, it was 
their duty to take part in the running of the manorial courts deciding these 
cases. The ordinance of Grand Master Johan Freytag von Loringhoven clearly 
shows this: the duty of the senior peasants to take part in the court proceed-
ings was listed among all the other responsibilities of the peasants. The lan-
guage of rights, even though the written form of Gerechtigkeiten was probably 
experienced by the peasants as being more secure than their relying on custom 
alone, hardly fitted the picture of the Livonian serf-peasant. The running of the 
courts was a service owed to the lord, much in the same vein as producing corn 
or honey for the manor&rsquo;s storage rooms. Besides, although the manorial courts, 
according to the sources available, were staffed by peasant law-finders, the 
courts were headed by stewards, who were the lord&rsquo;s officials. Had the lord had 
an interest in any particular law case, he certainly had the means of making

called Halsgerichtssachen, in cases of serious criminality.
</p>
<p>Even more importantly, peasant courts did not cease to exist during the 
Swedish rule. Throughout the Swedish period, peasant courts continued to 
function. They decided both petty crimes and small civil claims.113 The func-
tioning of the peasant courts will be dealt with more in detail below.114

<p>2.2.4 The Reception of Ius Commune in Livonia
The legal pluralism typical of Europe was thus at work in Livonia, with town 
law, and feudal and manorial law. We still need to consider one typical ingredi-
ent of medieval and early modern legal pluralism and ask whether, and to what 
extent, ius commune, the major driver of legal change in the contemporary 
German Empire, had advanced in Livonia. We have in fact already seen that 
ius commune had gained some authority in the practice of the Dorpat Council 
in the 1620s.
</p>
<p>Patrick Glenn contributed in an interesting way to the reception theories 
in his On Common Laws. According to Glenn, common laws have a &ldquo;relational 
character.&rdquo; They yield to, and define themselves in relation to, particular laws 
or iura propria. They thus have &ldquo;no obligatory or mandatory content.&rdquo;115 The 
learned Roman-canon law of medieval origin was not the only ius commune, 
but many others formed similar systems &ndash; and still do. The Spanish had their 
derecho com&uacute;n (that ruled as subsidiary law not only in Castile, but also in &ldquo;the 
Indies,&rdquo; or Spain&rsquo;s American colonies116), and the French droit commun lurked 
</p>
<p>113 The peasant courts were not allowed to order whip punishments of more than 10 pairs 
or damages greater than 20 thalers. Gustav Johann von Buddenbrock (ed.), Sammlung

<p>114 From the point of view of the Rechtsfinder, fragments of an Estonian translation of  
Livische Bauerrecht (lbr), the manuscript dating to the sixteenth century and found in 
1893 in the Tallinn City Archive, is of great value. Not because it would directly deal with 
how the system Rechtsfinder functioned, but merely because of its existence. Although it is 
unlikely that the any of the peasant Rechtsfinder themselves would have been literate, the 
translation could well have been read aloud to them, as Arbusow assumes. Leonid Arbu-

<p> behind the hundreds of local customary laws. Similarly, it was the gemeines 
Recht that served as the common law patching up for the deficiencies in Ger-
man territorial legal orders, not to mention the English common law, which at 
an early stage came to replace the local customary laws. The relational charac-
ter of the common laws means, for instance, that the continental common laws 
(the French, Castilian, and German) were united by the common Roman-canon 
law (the traditional ius commune), which served as their common background. 
Common laws can in other words be layered, one on top of the other.117
</p>
<p>In this study, Glenn&rsquo;s idea of relational common laws plays a role in explain-
ing why the legal universe of the Swedish Livonia was arranged the way it was. 
Before getting to that question we must, however, inspect how and to what 
extent the reception of Roman-canon law, or gemeines Recht, had proceeded 
prior to the Swedish conquest in the 1620s. Just as elsewhere in Europe, the 
reception has been a classic problem of legal history in the Baltic area. Bunge 
claimed in the 1840s that canon law had never gained any general validity in 
the old Livonia. Instead, only isolated laws (&ldquo;einzelne Extravaganten&rdquo;) had been 
followed directly, in addition to which the synods of Costniss and Basel had 
expressly been taken into use by the Archbishopric of Riga. However, Bunge af-
firms that the provincial synods in fact received the contents of the Decretales 
of Pope Gregor ix (1234, Liber Extra), often word for word.118 Secular courts 
followed canon law as well, and some of the Livonian legal cases reached the 
papal curia.119 Canon law also remained in force, as in other Protestant regions, 
as long as the provisions of canon law were not in conflict with the &ldquo;basic prin-
ciples of the Protestant church.&rdquo;120
</p>
<p>The other half of the Siamese twins, Roman law, apparently became known 
at an early stage. The mastery of canon law already required at least some 
knowledge of Justinian&rsquo;s legal corpus. Thus, Bishop Alfred of Riga notes already 
</p>
<p>117 Glenn, On Common Laws. It should be pointed out that this description surely gives an 
excessively limited picture of Glenn&rsquo;s thoughts. The early modern iura communalia are, 
for him, only examples of common laws, which are, and have, a global phenomenon, very 
much alive today in different shapes and forms.

utatur&rdquo; (Dig. ii, 2; 1 C. Inter alios, vii, 60) and Bishop Nicolaus (also of Riga) in 
1232 &ldquo;cum, secundum legem Imperatoriam, res inter alios acta aliis minime debet 
praeiudicare.&rdquo;121 The document concerning the sale of Estonia by the King of 
Denmark to the Teutonic Order in 1341 is full of Roman law terminology, such 
as iustus titulus, nulla fraus, exceptio non numeratae pecuniae, vindication, and 
bona fides.122 Otto, Bishop of Courland, mentions restitutio in integrum, a typi-
cal instrument of Roman, but especially of canon law,123 in the Middle Ages, in 
a document of 1392.124 The provincial statute of the Archbishop of Riga (1428) 
contains norms about sales contracts (emptio venditio), testaments, marriage, 
and usury, in the vein of Liber Extra of 1234.125
</p>
<p>Yet another attempt to Romanise Livonian law dates to the mid-fourteenth 
century. Emperor Charles iv (r. 1316&ndash;1378) decreed on 18 April 1366, that all 
Livonian statutes and decrees not in accordance with Roman law were not in 
force.126 At first glance, this appears to be a strange decree. After all, by the 
fourteenth century it had become a general rule that Roman-canon law served 
as a subsidiary body of law only, thus applied only if the parochial legislation 
was silent on the question. It now seems that the Emperor wished to leave 
the Livonian laws in place only where ius commune was silent, thus revert-
ing the normal order of the bodies of law. A closer reading reveals however  
that the statute may not be so categorical. Only those &ldquo;statutes and ordinations&rdquo; 
that have been expressly rejected by &ldquo;civil and canonical sanctions&rdquo; are an-
nulled. In other words, perhaps it was not the Emperor&rsquo;s intention to revert the  
established relation between Roman-canon ius commune and municipal law;

</p>
<p>instead, he was referring to specific instances in which the civil or ecclesiastic 
authorities had condemned certain laws. To establish a general preference for 
ius commune would have been unrealistic, given the scarcity of legal learning 
in medieval Livonia.
</p>
<p>From early on, the Teutonic Order employed men versed in learned laws. In 
1352 the Master of the Order, Winrich von Kniprode (r. 1351&ndash;1382), ordered that 
each convent of the Order house two learned persons, one theologian, and one 
lawyer. These learned brothers were responsible for teaching the others.127 Ac-
cording to a chronicler, Winrich also invited &ldquo;excellent jurists,&rdquo; legalists, to the 
Order&rsquo;s headquarters in Marienburg where a sort of a law school was thus es-
tablished. This college of lawyers would then also have acted as a high tribunal 
for Livonia and may even have issued consilia in lawsuits outside Livonia.128 
Pope Martin v (r. 1417&ndash;1431) undoubtedly refers to this same studium generale 
in a bull of June 13, 1422, which conferred to the Brothers of the Order the right 
to acquire titles in civil law and to enjoy the corresponding privileges.129
</p>
<p>As Bunge remarks, doctors of both laws (although mostly canonists) were 
not uncommon in the court of the Grand Master either. It seems, however, 
that whatever ius commune learning there was, it was retained for the use of 
ecclesiastical courts.130 The secular courts seem to have remained virtually 
untouched by ius commune in the Middle Ages. The fact that the private law 
collections and for instance the Ritterrecht do not contain Roman-canon influ-
ences, or contained very little, demonstrated this. Bunge notes that even the 
Formulare procuratorum of Dionysius Fabri of 1538 still contained almost no 
Roman-canon learning, thus forming a striking contrast to its German equiva-
lents of the same time.131 This is only logical considering the fact that learned 
law had begun to advance in the North German territories at the beginning of 
the sixteenth century.

</p>
<p>It was not only imperial legislation which had effect in Livonia. As part of 
the Empire, Livonia came under the jurisdiction of the newly reorganized 
highest judicial authorities of the Empire, both of which derived their jurisdic-
tion from the Emperor, the highest judicial lord in the Empire. These courts 
became lasting institutions and one of the few which gave substance to the ab-
stract and vague idea of the Reich. The Supreme Court of the Holy Roman Em-
pire of the German Nation (Reichskammergericht) had been established at the 
Worms Diet in 1495 as part of the imperial reform and is considered to be one 
of the primary vehicles of the reception of Roman law in the Old Empire.132 
The founding of the Supreme Court of the Reich was closely associated to the 
Perpetual Public Peace (Ewiges Landfrieden), also proclaimed at the Worms 
Diet. The establishment of the Court was seen as necessary to help bring about 
Eternal Peace. The Court was the appeals instance of the Empire, except for 
the territories, which held appeals privileges (privilegium de non appellando). 
Such privileges did not, however, shield the territorial princes against cases of 
refusal or delay of justice (Rechtsverweigerung, Rechtsverz&ouml;gerung).133 Privile-
gia de non evocando, based on Emperor Charles iv&rsquo;s Golden Bull of 1356, meant 
that the holder of the privilege could not be summoned to a court of a Reich-
stand other than his or its own. Privilegium de non evocando was granted to the 
Livonian Order in 1420 and private appeal outside Livonia was forbidden in the 
early sixteenth century (privilegium de non appellando).134
</p>
<p>There are some documentary examples of Livonians already approaching 
the medieval predecessor of these high courts in the fifteenth century. For in-
stance in 1473, the Imperial Chamber Court (Kaiserliche Kammergericht), at 
Baden then, heard a case concerning the dowry of Johan Morrien&rsquo;s widow,135 
and in 1483 the Duke of Pomerani &ndash; commissioned by the Emperor &ndash; heard a 
case of Henvard von der Linden against &ldquo;Tallinn people.&rdquo;136

</p>
<p>Despite the privilegia, Livonians did in fact take advantage of both of the 
imperial high courts, although apparently not to a very large extent. Leo Lees-
ment recorded 29 Livonian cases in the Imperial Chamber Court of the Holy 
Roman Empire in the years 1530&ndash;1564. Almost all of them were appeals cases, 
which had been first decided by the Archbishop of Riga, the Council of Riga, or 
a lower court in Livonia. Leesment also went through some of the documents 
at the Haus-, Hof- und Staatarchiv in Wien, which houses the archive of the  
Aulic Court, and found some precedent cases from Livonia from around mid-
dle of the sixteenth century.
</p>
<p>Leesment&rsquo;s main achievement was bringing the Livonian cases to light, but 
he did less by way of analysing the material. According to Leesment, the pri-
mary reason for the concentration of Livonian cases around the middle of the 
sixteenth century was the fact that that was the time when Livonian relations 
vis-&agrave;-vis the Reich were at their most intense.137 This may be true in part, along 
with the simple fact that it understandably took a few decades before the Li-
vonians learned to take advantage of the imperial high courts, which was also 
true for other regions of the Empire.138 In addition, privilegia de non evocando 
and appellando had been granted, and in principle it made most of the appeals 
illegal. It is difficult to decide to what extent the contact with the Imperial 
Chamber Court and the Aulic Court might have advanced the march of ius 
commune into Livonia. The effect should certainly not be exaggerated.
</p>
<p>Since it is evident that ius commune learning had reached judicial practice 
before the Swedes came, something must have happened in the Polish period. 
The reception process probably advanced around the same time as it did in the 
northern parts of Germany, because of the cultural relations between the Ger-
man Baltic population and Germany. With court records lacking for the most 
part, we must again rely on other sources.
</p>
<p>In 1598, King Sigismund set up a high-profile commission entrusted with the 
task of drawing a new Landrecht for Livonia,139 ordering a wholesale reception

The commissaries decided to delegate the actual task to one of commissaries, 
a Riga-born lawyer and notary of the Wenden District Court, David Hilchen. 
He had been trained in law in the universities of T&uuml;bingen, Heidelberg and 
Ingolstadt, and he had served in various significant legal posts during his ca-
reer.141 Undoubtedly, and unlike many other members of the Commission, 
Hilchen was well prepared to draft the law. After only five months of efficient 
work, Hilchen presented a draft law for scrutiny to the Commission, the rep-
resentatives of the nobility, and the Council of Riga. It has been assumed that 
they considerably influenced the final draft, which was presented to the Diet, 
gathered in Warsaw, in 1600. Sigismund iii&rsquo;s attempt proved unsuccessful, like 
all of its predecessors, this time again because of the resistance it met from the 
side of the Livonian nobility. The matter was postponed to the next Diet, and 
the draft was never promulgated as law.142
</p>
<p>Hilchen&rsquo;s Landrecht has, for a long time, remained a blank spot in Livonian 
legal history. Thomas Hoffmann&rsquo;s recent study on Hilchen&rsquo;s work has now rem-
edied the situation. Apart from some sections, the Landrecht never appeared 
in print.143 This is understandable against the precarious political background 
in which the Polish authorities found themselves in the Livonia of the late 
1590s. As mentioned above, the loyalty of the Livonian nobility was shifting 
towards the Swedes and Duke Karl. In this situation, the Poles could not expect 
too much from the Livonian compilation of land law: it was enough that the 
Polish administrative structure was kept intact. The compilation could then 
protect Livonian law well, as long as it did not encroach on Polish law.144

<p>141 David Hilchen was born in 1561 in Riga. After studying at T&uuml;bingen, Heidelberg, and In-

the Secretary (Oberratssekret&auml;r) of the Riga Council and in 1589 the Stadtsyndicus. He 
also represented the town of Riga at the Imperial Diet and was ennobled in 1591. In 1597 
he became royal secretary and Landgerichtsnotar at Wenden. He died in 1610 at Orisow.

<p>Although never officially approved, Hilchen&rsquo;s Landrecht seems to have been 
in use at least for some years in the Livonian lower courts.145 The Proposal con-
sisted of three books. The book on public law, based on the Ordinatio Livoniae 
of 1598, is divided into 22 titles; the book on private, police, and criminal law 
into 67 titles; and the book on courts and procedure into 31 titles. Each title has 
one or more paragraphs. Hilchen drew on a variety of sources, such as Livonian 
customary law, Polish, Lithuanian, and, of course, Roman law. The private law 
parts of the second book follow the tripartite division of the Institutes, and 
some Roman institutes were directly received into the book. The old Livonian 
Ritterrecht, however, seem to have been used much less. Hoffmann reminds 
us, however, of the fact that many of the provisions of foreign origins probably 
resembled the Livonian customary law of the time. The medieval Ritterrechte, 
although formally in force, had most probably been very much altered by cus-
tomary law. It is therefore also likely that the Livonian nobles were not neces-
sarily against the replacement of those old rules by new ones, albeit of foreign 
origin.146 This explains at least partly why and how the learned law advanced 
in late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Livonia.
</p>
<p>2.2.5 The Royal Law
Livonia was formally incorporated to the Reich as soon as the province was 
conquered by the Sword Brothers and remained so until the dissolution of the 
Ordenstaat and Livonia&rsquo;s subsequent incorporation into the Polish-Lithuanian 
Union in 1561. In the imperial structure, the Bishop of Riga (in temporal mat-
ters) and the Grand Master figured as vassals of the Emperor. They also had 
a seat and voting rights in the Imperial Diet, which they used either person-
ally or via ambassadors. Imperial legislation thus covered Livonia.147 Because 
of the scarcity of such legislation in the Middle Ages, however, imperial law 
never came to have much significance in medieval Livonia, although expres-
sions such as ius scriptum, ius commune, and gemeyne rechte can be found in 
fourteenth-century documents.148 The weight of imperial legislation changed 
in the sixteenth century, and the Livonian Diet expressly demanded the

new lower courts in the region, were ordered to base their civil verdicts on Hilchen&rsquo;s law.

<p> authorities to observe the Imperial Police Ordinance (Reichspolizeiordnung) 
of 1536. The Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (Halsgerichtsordnung, 1532), the 
criminal law of Emperor Charles v (r. 1519&ndash;1556), was taken into active use as 
well. This happened apparently quite soon after its promulgation,149 as the diet 
at Wolmar stated that crimes had to be punished by &ldquo;imperial and domestic 
laws&rdquo; (&ldquo;kaiserlichem und dieser Lande Rechte&rdquo;).150
</p>
<p>The Polish rule from the 1560s to the 1630s brought no drastic or abrupt 
changes to Livonian law. Given the feebleness of the state structures in most 
parts of Europe, continuity rather than change was still more the rule than 
the exception in this type of situation in the sixteenth century. The Livonian 
estates expressed their wish to retain their own laws, customs and privileges 
in the power-of-attorney that was given to the Grand Master Gotthard Kettler 
(r. 1561&ndash;1587) for the capitulation negotiations with the Polish.151 The Polish 
overlord, King Sigismund ii Augustus, did not question the Livonians&rsquo; right to 
their own laws,152 upholding the rights and privileges of the Livonian estate in 
his Privilegium Sigismundi (1561).
</p>
<p>According to Bunge, Sigismund&rsquo;s Privilege referred to the totality of Livo-
nian law at the time of the capitulation. This is apparently the message that 
the King wanted to convey to the Livonian estates. The interpretation of Bock, 
according to which iura Germanorum propria ac consueta would refer to the 
Ritterrecht only,153 is based on a modern, nineteenth-century notion of what 
&ldquo;law&rdquo; means: that law is first and foremost statutory law. Basically the same 
idea of not touching the old law (and not only the law in its statutory form) was

<p>expressed in several other capitulation documents, such as: the capitulation 
treaty between Nicolaus Radziwil (1549&ndash;1616), Sigismund&rsquo;s representative, and 
the Knighthood of the Archbishopric (Cautio Radziviliana) of 4 March 1562; 
the treaty signed by the representatives of the Livonian estates and confirmed 
by Sigismund on the annexation of Livonia to Lithuania (Unionsdiplom, De-
cember 1566); and the Capitulation of Riga (Corpus Privilegiorum Stepheneum, 
Jan. 14, 1581).154
</p>
<p>Sigismund&rsquo;s Privilege, however, was not only about maintaining the priv-
ileges, but was also about clarifying the law. To accomplish this, the estates 
themselves asked the King to issue a general law of the land, to which all Livo-
nians would be bound. The law would be based on the Livonian customs, privi-
leges, and judicial cases.155 The Livonian estates thus wished the new overlord 
to undertake the task of drafting the new Livonian law on the basis of the ex-
isting one. The reason, one might assume, was their willingness to establish 
order into Livonian law, a confusing maze of legal sources as it stood. However, 
this is hardly the best explanation. The Livonian estates could well have un-
dertaken the compilation during the Ordenstaat, had they felt the need to rid 
local law of excessive complexities. That this was not done is understandable, 
for sixteenth-century Livonian law only reflected the medieval social order of 
the Ordenstaat. The situation of each estate having their law &ndash; town law for 
the towns, peasant law for the peasant, feudal law (Ritterrecht) for the noble-
men, and church law for the Church &ndash; suited the Ordenstaat perfectly well. It is 
much more logical to see the sudden urge for compilation as a protective mea-
sure against the invading Poles. The capitulation treaties only went halfway, as 
they let the Livonians keep their old law.
</p>
<p>The estates proposed that a group of legal experts should write this law on 
the basis of legal customs, privileges, and royal judicial decisions. The estates 
would then approve the proposal, and the King would issue and publish it. 
King Sigismund ii consented to this,156 but changed his mind later. In the

<p>Union Treaty of 1566, the Livonian courts were instructed simply to decide 
&ldquo;according to the Livonian laws and rational customs.&rdquo;157 When the estates 
reiterated their wish to have the compilation based on the existing precepts 
of indigenous Livonian sources during the rule of King Stephan B&aacute;thory, the 
King again did not insist on forcing a reception of foreign law on the Livonian 
judiciary. This is clear by Art. 14 of the Constitutiones Livoniae (1582), according 
to which the new district court, established by the same Constitutions, were 
to apply &ldquo;Livonian provincial law.&rdquo; The King wished to have a statement of the 
provincial law presented to him within four months, after which he would 
have it published.158 However, B&aacute;thory never received the codified Livonian 
laws on his desk.
</p>
<p>The Constitutiones of 1582, drafted according to the corresponding Prussian 
model,159 was part of B&aacute;thory&rsquo;s repressive policy towards the Livonian nobil-
ity. The law relegated the Lutheran faith to a level of a tolerated belief only, 
and some of the fundamental status differences between the nobility and the 
bourgeoisie were removed. The bourgeoisie could own manorial land, and the 
nobility could acquire urban property.160
</p>
<p>The tightening grip on the nobility continued in the measures taken by B&aacute;-
thory&rsquo;s successor, King Sigismund iii as well. In 1589, King Sigismund iii issued 
a further major piece of legislation, the Ordinatio Livoniae.161 The law was given 
at the zenith of Polish power in Livonia, which shows in its contents, severely 
limiting the rights of the Livonian nobility.162
</p>
<p>Sigismund iii claimed in Ordinatio Livoniae that there had been &ldquo;no law 
in force&rdquo; (&ldquo;kein Recht gegolten&rdquo;) in the province. The Polish King thus agreed 
with the need to clear up the disorganised Livonian law. However, unlike his 
predecessors, he did not depart from the local legal sources, but returned to

<p>his original idea of transplanting foreign law in the area. Instead, he entrusted 
his Field Marshall Jan Chodkiewicz (1560&ndash;1621), the task of &ldquo;acting so that clear 
and certain law be received in that land, be it Culmian law, or that which is 
used in Prussian lands or any other which [the Livonian] might wish.&rdquo;163 The 
attempt of Sigismund iii proved unsuccessful, like all of its predecessors, this 
time also because of the resistance it met from the side of the Livonian no-
bility. According to the Ordinatio, 26 of the strategically important starosties 
could only be held by Polish or Lithuanian noblemen.164 The Ordinatio caused 
outrage amongst the Livonian nobility, who brought several complaints to the 
King and the Polish Diet.
</p>
<p>Thus, a second Ordinatio Livoniae was issued in 1598, and Livonia was ac-
corded an equal place with other parts of the Swedish realm, of which Poland 
was then part, and thus Livonia as well. The provisions of the the Constitu-
tiones of 1582 and the Ordinatio of 1589 discriminating Livonian nobility were 
removed, and Livonian noblemen were now to be treated equally when fill-
ing governmental posts.165 The second Ordinatio has to be seen against its 
political background. In 1594, Sigismund iii had come to the Swedish throne 
in addition to the Polish one which he already held. Because of the problems 
with his uncle Karl, Duke of S&ouml;dermanland (future King Charles ix of Sweden,  
r. 1604&ndash;1611) Sigismund had been advised to support the Livonian nobility. Re-
ligious conflicts and the first Ordinatio had caused the loyalty of the Livonian 
noblemen vis-&agrave;-vis the Polish crown to wane drastically, and many of them 
positioned themselves at the side of Duke Karl in the war that broke out in 
1600.166
</p>
<p>Still in the same year, 1598, King Sigismund entrusted the task of drawing 
a new Landrecht for Livonia to a commission, which, as was explained above, 
delegated the task to David Hilchen. Hilchen&rsquo;s Draft Code and the tensions 
surrounding the codification effort, together with the other pieces of Livonian 
legal history of the Ordenszeit and the Polish period, form part of the same 
complex legal situation, which the Swedes faced upon their conquest. The con-
tinuous changing of the mind as to which law was to rule in Livonia shows that 
the purpose of the King may not have been to impose a foreign law as such 
on the Livonians, but rather to clarify the unclear system of sources. From the 
crown&rsquo;s point of view, as well as from the estates&rsquo;, a messy situation of legal

<p>sources was the worst alternative, as it was difficult to control. Instead, a sys-
tem based on clear sources, approved by the king and the estates, was better. 
It would be even better if it were written down. The Livonian case was, again, 
perfectly in line with the development towards a growing significance in royal 
law elsewhere in Europe from the sixteenth century onwards. It had been ex-
actly the same case earlier in France, with its Ordonnance de Villers-Cott&ecirc;rets 
(1539), Castile with its Leyes de Toro (1505), and in the all the Protestant world 
where power had increasingly concentrated into the hands of the ruler.
</p>
<p>2.2.6 Conclusion: Livonian Law in the Early Seventeenth Century
What kind of law did the Swedes meet when they set about organizing the 
legal order of the province in the 1620s? Livonian law can best be described as 
medieval in the sense that it was politically and legally polycentric. The Holy 
Roman Empire of the German Nation continued much in the same vein at 
the beginning of the early modern period, albeit with a clear tendency toward 
territorialisation even before the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. This tendency 
had no counterpart in pre-Polish Livonia. Livonia before the Poles was, as it 
had been since the coming of the Germans and the Teutonic Order in the thir-
teenth century, a loose confederation of regions, far from being a state in any 
modern sense of the term, and mostly activated only at times of outside threat 
or in order to convene the Diet. Inside the confederation, power within the 
bishoprics was divided between the bishop and his fiefs. The only part of the 
confederation remotely resembling a modern state in the German territories 
and in Sweden at that time, for instance,167 were the lands of the Teutonic Or-
der, administratively organized quite effectively and with practically no lands 
granted to vassals. However, the general marks of the rising modern state &ndash; a 
standing army, taxation, and professional bureaucracy &ndash; were lacking in the 
lands of the Order as well. Some of the towns had developed a considerable 
degree of independence, with Riga and its strong bourgeoisie clearly carry-
ing the flag, Tallinn and Dorpat more or less following suit. The other towns 
were much more dependent on their surrounding regions. The noble vassals 
of the bishops (and of the Teutonic Order in the Estonian regions of Harrien 
and Wiek) acted like little kings on their manors, with relatively little political 
constraint placed upon them from the other estates of the confederation.
</p>
<p>The political diversity unavoidably influenced the legal landscape. The me-
dieval Ritterrechte, although they changed and developed, continued to be the 
basis of the Livonian customary law governing the life of the nobility well into

<p>63Livonian &amp; Swedish Legal Orders during Swedish Conquest
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>the Swedish period. The peasant law consisted of strongly localised bodies 
of law, Bauerrechte, that ruled the legal relations between the peasants on 
the manor houses and the relations of the peasants vis-&agrave;-vis their lords. The 
town charters of German origin, continued their development throughout the  
Ordenszeit and the Polish period. The estates thus all had their law, and it had 
relatively little influence from the other bodies of law present in the Livonian 
confederation.
</p>
<p>European common law, ius commune, in its German version of gemeines 
Recht nevertheless was gaining influence in Livonia as it did in many other 
regions of the Reich from the late Middle Ages onwards. Like elsewhere, so 
also in Livonia the presence of the learned law was first known in the church 
administration and ecclesiastical courts, as some of the medieval documents 
cited above show. The Teutonic Order also had a clear interest in securing its 
share of legal learning in its ranks, as important as this form of knowledge had 
become in late medieval Europe. Legal learning was of use, if not so much for 
the use of courts in the home lands, then at least when dealing diplomatically 
with the neighbours and the rest of the Empire. Much the same can be said 
about the largest towns, which also, at least in the sixteenth century, would 
regularly contract learned lawyers for some of the key positions of urban  
administration &ndash; David Hilchen of Riga is a good example of this.
</p>
<p>The role of legal learning, as Arvo Tering and others have shown, rose steadi-
ly from the late Middle Ages onwards, and Livonian young men customarily 
embarked on peregrinationes academicae to the renowned universities of the 
Empire and even other parts of Europe. When the students came back, they 
brought their learning with them, although it was first and foremost used to 
benefit church institutions. As Leo Leesment has shown, Livonian connec-
tions to the Imperial Chamber Court and the Aulic Court, the primary vehicles 
of the reception of Roman law in the Reich, intensified in the mid-sixteenth 
century. Without legal knowledge, appeals to the highest courts of the Empire 
would have been unthinkable. The Polish period, despite continuous attempts 
from the side of the crown, did not leave many traces in Livonian law. The resis-
tance of the nobility worked well: without their cooperation, the &ldquo;Polification&rdquo; 
of Livonian law was difficult if not impossible to realize.
</p>
<p>David Hilchen&rsquo;s unofficial compilation of Livonian law was probably, from 
the point of view of the Swedish period, the most lasting achievement that the 
Polish conquerors initiated. That compilation shows clear traces of ius com-
mune learning and was also used in Livonian court practice. To sum up, these 
bits and pieces of information make it clear that ius commune was present in 
the protocols of the Livonian Landgerichte straight from the 1630s onwards, 
when Sweden took over the province.</p>

<p>2.3 Swedish Law before the Conquest of Livonia
</p>
<p>Medieval Sweden was a European periphery. As far as legal history is con-
cerned, Christianisation played a pivotal role there as it did everywhere in 
Europe, although in Sweden the conversion occurred later than in neighbour-
ing Denmark and Norway.168 Swedish Christianisation is usually taken to have 
begun in 829&ndash;830, when Ansgar (801&ndash;865), the Archbishop of Hamburg and 
Bremen, first visited Birka, a trading post in what later became central Sweden. 
Christianisation, however, took much longer to establish its roots. Pope Inno-
cent iii (r. 1198&ndash;1216) let the Archbishopric of Lund be founded in 1104 in the 
province of Scania in present-day southern Sweden. The provincial council of 
Sk&auml;nninge in 1248 then organized the Swedish church along the lines of canon 
law, which has been taken to have been a decisive milestone on Sweden&rsquo;s path 
to become a part of Catholic Europe.169 Although these formal milestones of 
Christianisation have little to do with the Christianisation of the populace, they 
are significant from the point of view of legal history. In principle, the Church 
claimed the same wide jurisdiction as it did elsewhere in the Christendom.170
</p>
<p>Wherever it spread on the outskirts of what later came to be viewed as 
Europe, the Catholic Church brought with it not only a written culture but 
also the idea of fixing customary laws into a written form. All over Europe, 
the thirteenth century was the era when laws were increasingly put in writing. 
However, not all written enactments of law can be put into the same catego-
ry. At one end of the scale we have the written customary laws, such as Cou-

<p>(r. 1252&ndash;1284) of Castile,171 or the Constitutions of Melfi, which Fredrik ii gave 
as the King of Sicily (r. 1198&ndash;1250).172 Magna Carta of England (1215), a list of 
feudal rights but not a thorough legal compilation, cannot be counted in either 
of these groups, but it still reflects the general tendency towards written leg-
islation typical of the period. Hardly by coincidence, written laws emerged at 
the same time in the northernmost parts of Europe as well: Iceland&rsquo;s J&oacute;nsb&oacute;k 
(1281), Norway&rsquo;s Gulating (ca. 1250),173 Denmark&rsquo;s Jydske Lov (1241),174 and the 
Law of Scania (from the early years of the thirteenth century) all represent 
written legislation, although at the provincial level only. The Nordic laws were, 
much like Sachsenspiegel and Ritterrecht, typical enactments of customary law. 
The role of the Church in their emergence was decisive: without the learned 
churchmen, any major piece of legislation would have been unthinkable. The 
participation of the Church had its price, and thus the country came to repre-
sent not only the rising power of the nobility but also the strengthening posi-
tion of the Catholic Church in northern Europe.
</p>
<p>The way for the Church to implement its law in Scandinavia was through 
provincial legislation, which emerged as a compromise between the provin-
cial strongmen, the crown, and the Church. Most of the ecclesiastical crimes 
were explicitly mentioned in the provincial legislation in Sweden. This is clear-
ly the case with perjury, which was mentioned in all of the laws, except for 
the Older Law of Western Gothia. Sorcery was mentioned in some of the laws, 
which assigned the handling of these matters to church courts. This was also 
the case with most sexual crimes, except for adultery, which was developing 
into a mixed cause (causa mixta). The boundaries between secular and church 
jurisdictions were just as unclear as they were elsewhere. Incest, for instance, 
was considered to be a secular crime in the Newer Law of Western Gothia and 
the Law of Dalarna, but only a case of forum internum requiring penance in the 
Law of Sm&aring;land.175
</p>
<p>The first Swedish statutes were thus provincial laws, only some of which 
the king confirmed. In the older literature these laws have been called &ldquo;stat-
ute books&rdquo; (lagb&ouml;cker), instead of law books (r&auml;ttsb&ouml;cker), which were not

<p>assumed to have been officially promulgated but were instead products of pri-
vate initiative. The Laws of Uppland and S&ouml;dermanland are thought to have 
been drafted by judicial commission, and the Law of Uppland was promul-
gated by King Birger Magnusson (r. 1290&ndash;1318); the Law of S&ouml;dermanland by 
King Magnus Eriksson (r. 1319&ndash;1364).176 The distinction into statute books and 
law books no longer holds, as it anachronistically gives weight to royal promul-
gations of some of provincial laws. However, they do not essentially differ from 
the ones that were supposedly not officially approved. In addition, we cannot 
be perfectly sure that some law books would not have had royal approval.
</p>
<p>The oldest written existing manuscripts of the provincial laws date to the 
period between 1280s and 1350s.177 The Swedish provincial laws compromised 
several interests: those of the king, the Church, and the secular magnates. Law 
drafting never starts at the tabula rasa, and especially in the Middle Ages no 
major deviations from the existing customary law were possible.178 However, 
medieval laws did not simply reflect customary law. Instead, scholars tend to 
view the medieval law compilations as contracts. Medieval political power was 
based on consensus. Both secular authorities (emperors and kings) as well as 
the ecclesiastical princes (pope and the bishops) ruled consilio et consensus &ndash;  
by advice and consensus &ndash; of the elective collegium,179 and the conditions un-
der which power was used were confirmed contractually.180 The contractual 
model was particularly clear in the land peace legislation all over Europe. In 
the first phase, the tenth century in southern France, the peace laws protected 
God&rsquo;s peace, the church and its institutions, and by the eleventh century the 
idea had been transformed to safeguard the king and his party wherever they 
were. In the next phase of the Landfrieden, the peace laws covered the whole 
area in which the king and his party resided. In the final phase all crimes taking 
place in the region were thought to violate the interests of not only the plain-
tiff but also those of the king. The sanction for breaching the peace was that

<p>the criminal was pronounced peaceless. Anyone could kill such a person. The 
novelty when compared to the traditional kinship law was that the peaceless-
ness only followed after a certain period (typically a year), during which the 
criminal could try to settle the case with the victim or his or her relatives.181
</p>
<p>The royal peace laws were also the first ones that were in force, at least in 
principle, all across the Swedish realm. The first nation-wide peace law was 
that of Birger Jarl (r. 1248&ndash;1266) from the mid-thirteenth century, and its con-
tents were reiterated in the Rule of Alsn&ouml; in 1280. These peace laws sought to 
limit bloodfeud by prohibiting it after, for instance, the blood money had been 
paid.182
</p>
<p>The normative contents of the first Swedish piece laws were then included 
in the provincial laws, in which the local magnates promised by oath to assure  
peace under certain conditions. These chapters (balkar) of the provincial laws 
were called eds&ouml;rebalkar (literally: the chapters concerning the taking of the 
oath). In these laws, the king promised to punish breaches of home, women, 
court, and church peace as well as illegal feuds, with harsh punishments.  
A good example of this is the provincial law of Eastern Gothia, which was put 
into writing in the 1290s.183 The ecclesiastical chapter of the law included pro-
visions against sexual crimes, modelled after canon law (art. xv, xxvii), and 
crimes against the clergy. The eds&ouml;rebalken takes after the European models, 
although the punishments are milder. Only some of the crimes could result in 
capital punishments, and in most cases the punishment was fines, outlawry, or 
confiscation.184

<p>chapter 268

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>The central tenet of the peace laws, the strengthening of the Church and 
royal power, continued in the fourteenth century, when the first general stat-
utes encompassing the entire realm were issued. These were the Law of the 
Realm of Magnus Eriksson (1347) and his Town Law (1350). The strife between 
Church and the crown was far from settled at the time of drafting of these laws. 
The representatives of the church thought that the commission in charge of 
drafting the Law of the Realm had tried to limit the ecclesiastical privileges 
too much. Because of the Church&rsquo;s protests, no church chapter was included 
in the final statute, although the provincial laws had customarily included 
one; instead, the church chapter of the Uppsala Provincial law continued to 
be applied well into the seventeenth century and until the drafting of the new 
Church Statute in 1686. The town law had mainly been drafted with the Stock-
holm bourgeoisie in mind, but it came to be applied in other towns as well. 
A new version of the country law, the Law of the Realm of King Christopher, 
was issued in 1442. One of the reasons for the perceived need of a new law 
were the different manuscript traditions of the old country law. Four fifths of 
the normative material in the new law was taken from the old one. The novel-
ties of the new laws tended to stress the position of the king, and the criminal 
sanction grew tougher accordingly. The old provincial laws and the Law of the 
Realm of Magnus Eriksson, all continued in force to a certain extent. This situ-
ation was probably brought to an end only in 1608, when Charles ix (1599&ndash;1611) 
reaffirmed that the Law of the Realm of King Christopher was to be in force.185
</p>
<p>In 1397, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden formed a confederation, the so-
called Union of Kalmar, under the crown of Denmark, which lasted until 1523. 
Politically, the Union was weak, and it had little impact on the Swedish legal his-
tory. The dissolution of the union led Gustav Vasa (r. 1526&ndash;1560) to the throne. 
As far as legal history is concerned, one of the most significant developments 
during the time of Gustav Vasa was the Protestant reformation. It changed 
Swedish law remarkably, although the changes did not occur overnight. The 
rural dean&rsquo;s assizes functioned alongside the secular court until the late 1500s, 
when their functions were taken over by secular courts. Unlike many of the 
German Kirchenordnungen, the Swedish church ordinances were not invaded 
by harsh criminal sanctions. Sweden thus seems to belong to the same group 
as Mecklenburg, Courland, and some other territories of northern Germany, 
who chose not to include penal sanctions into their church ordinances. When 
discussing German church ordinances, however, too much should not be made 
of the differences in legislative technique. The Decalogue, a primary vehicle 
of harsh religious punishments in Germany, was turned into law in Sweden as

</p>
<p>well although through separate legislation in 1608 and not by way of church 
ordinances.186
</p>
<p>The church&rsquo;s disciplinary machinery, together with ecclesiastical police 
legislation, acted as a powerful vehicle of social control or Sozialdisziplinier-
ung. Crown and church were partners in social control: the newly established 
modern state was still too feeble in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to 
undertake social control all by itself. The growing Swedish military might have 
needed justification and support from the late sixteenth century onwards, and 
the ideological services that the church was able to render by way of sermons 
were valuable in this respect. For these reasons, it is understandable that the 
crown took advantage of the church, which had its administrative network es-
tablished across the entire kingdom. The alliance was not only beneficial for the 
crown, but for the church as well. The discipline that the church got to practice 
by way of delegation from the secular power served to restore the prestige that 
had been lost in the Reformation.187 All this is not to say that church discipline 
did not simultaneously serve as an instrument for curing souls. For medieval 
Catholics, the whole ecclesiastical law ultimately served only one purpose, to 
guide souls to heaven.188 Luther&rsquo;s two-kingdom theory served much the same 
purpose. From the theological point of view, the final goal of the alliance be-
tween the crown and the church, and their common efforts at efficient social 
control, was salvation. The Protestant church thus remained an important fac-
tor in social life throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Accord-
ing to the precepts of the Lutheran social theory, the church functioned as the 
bracchum seculare of the state when it came to worldly matters entrusted to 
the church. Priests watched the popular morals in matters of sexual discipline, 
but they were also in charge of educating of people.189

</p>
<p>By the seventeenth century, Sweden had developed into a fully-fledged es-
tate society, although different from its European counterparts. The privileges 
of the estates were few, and in the long run the estates were unable to resist 
the strengthening royal power. Because of the weak nobility, feudalism never 
grew to the same proportions as in the Empire, France, or Spain. The propor-
tion of the free peasants was overwhelming, and the decree to which the ten-
ant peasants were tied to manor houses was weak compared to Livonia where 
serfdom was the order of the day. Apart from some exceptions (to which I will 
come soon), the nobility had no jurisdiction over their manors and their power 
over the peasants was always limited. The position of the Swedish nobility in 
the seventeenth century came to be based increasingly on privileges they en-
joyed over royal offices.190 Other estates had their privileges as well, with the 
clergy dominating the ecclesiastical positions, and the bourgeoisie the urban 
administration.
</p>
<p>Small towns produced weak urban legislation. It had already come to be 
different to the law in the countryside through Magnus Eriksson&rsquo;s town law, 
but the decisive difference between that law and the urban charters, and other 
pieces of urban legislation in Livonia and other parts of the Empire, was that 
Swedish urban legislation was not a product of autonomous towns, but part of 
the royal legislation. Bj&auml;rk&ouml;&auml; and Visby town laws had been independent town 
laws, but their golden period dates to the time before the 1350s after which 
Magnus Eriksson&rsquo;s town law became prominent in most towns &ndash; with the ex-
ception of Visby.191 The basic idea of dominium and usus found its expressions 
in Sweden as well,192 but with little of the complexities that the theory devel-
oped in other countries, and feudal law did not develop otherwise either.
</p>
<p>Manorial law, as a separate body of law administered by peasants themselves 
with the manorial lord or his steward acting as an overseer, was relatively in-
significant in Sweden.193 Thus, King Magnus Eriksson (r. 1319&ndash;1364) granted the 
oldest Swedish manorial law (g&aring;rdsr&auml;tt) sometime after 1332. Another mano-
rial law that we know of appears under the regent names of Queen Margaret i

<p>(r. 1387&ndash;1412) of Denmark, Erik of Pomerania (r. 1396&ndash;1439), and Karl Knutsson 
(r. 1448&ndash;1457, 1464&ndash;1465, 1467&ndash;1470). Gustav Vasa, Erik xiv (r. 1560&ndash;1568), John iii  
(r. 1568&ndash;1592), and Charles ix issued manorial laws of their own during the 
sixteenth century. They usually provided harsher punishments than would be 
found in general lawmaking, so that royal manors, often with heavy military 
troops, were well-disciplined. For instance, the g&aring;rdsr&auml;tt of Magnus Eriksson 
forbade slapping another person&rsquo;s face with the hand (&ouml;rfil), or hitting him 
with a stick on pain of corporal punishment, whereas the same king&rsquo;s Law of 
the Realm provided only fines for the similar misdemeanours.194
</p>
<p>G&aring;rdsr&auml;tt (literally: manorial law) thus referred to a body of law, but also to 
manorial courts. The courts could also be called castle courts (borgr&auml;tt).195 The 
g&aring;rdsr&auml;tt of Magnus Eriksson not only established the separate court for royal 
manors, but also extended the right to hold court as a privilege to members 
of the royal councils on their manors (s&auml;tesg&aring;rdar) as well. The reasons were 
undoubtedly similar: noble magnates also needed to keep their troops under 
check.196 This privilege remained in force until 1691, when the last remaining 
borgr&auml;tter (on the manors of Bergkvara, Torpa, and &Auml;ngs&ouml;) of the high nobil-
ity were abolished.197 By the seventeenth century, however, the castle courts 
already decided their cases according to the general Swedish law and no longer 
according to their specific manorial statutes, which had been the case in the 
middle cases.198
</p>
<p>The history of Swedish manorial or patrimonial courts is important, because 
their legal position provides a context for the two patrimonial courts active in 
seventeenth-century Livonia. The medieval g&aring;rdsr&auml;tter have been seen as the 
root of the larger wave of patrimonial courts emerging from the late sixteenth-
century onwards.199 The subject has been poorly researched, but it seems that 
the importance of seventeenth-century patrimonial courts has been under-
estimated. The crux of the matter was that with the growth of Sweden to a 
European great power, the crown was forced to give in to demands of the high 
nobility. One of these demands was the privilege to hold court on their lands,

</p>
<p>which was the case in the European regions with deeper feudal pasts, nearby 
Denmark included.200
</p>
<p>It is probable that high nobility would have carried on holding court de fac-
to, even without express legitimation, due to a privilege by King Gustav Vasa 
from 1526, which guaranteed noblemen the right to their &ldquo;law, privileges, free-
doms, and good old customs.&rdquo; In the Privilege Letter of 1590, King John iii, 
however, expressly forbade nobles, on a general level, from holding courts on 
their manors, stating that legal cases concerning the nobility&rsquo;s personnel or 
peasants were to be decided in &ldquo;lawful courts&rdquo; and according to Swedish law.201 
However, King Erik xiv had given the few barons and counts of the realm the 
right to hold patrimonial courts in 1569,202 and King John iii also consented 
to such patrimonial courts on these larger enfeoffments. He donated a count-
ship and six baronies, mostly to his relatives, and on these enfeoffments the 
newly-grafted high nobility received the right to hold court.203 Thus, there was 
no general right for noblemen to hold patrimonial courts on their estates, but 
counts and barons had the right to courts of their own on their larger fiefs.
</p>
<p>During the early part of the seventeenth century the number of such fiefs 
granted to high nobility rose steeply. By 1650, roughly 50 countships and bar-
onies had been enfeoffed in Sweden (Finland included).204 All of these had 
the privilege to hold court. We do not know for certain whether they all actu-
ally did, but it is probable, given the monetary incentive involved. The essen-
tial benefit was that the patrimonial court gave their lords the right to keep 
the part of the fine monies, which otherwise would have gone to the crown. 
Enough patrimonial court archives have been preserved, furthermore, to draw

<p>It is then altogether another matter what the existence of patrimonial courts 
meant in Sweden. The right to collect tax money was the most obvious benefit 
for the lord. In the Swedish system, the fines were divided into three lots: one

<p>for the victim (or his or her family), one for the judicial community (in charge 
of the practical arrangements involved in running the court), and one for the 
crown. Few lords chaired their courts in person.206 A lord was nevertheless 
entitled to choose his judge independently, whereas in crown courts the ap-
pointment came from the king. In practice, substitute judges (&ldquo;law-readers&rdquo;) 
with little or no legal learning were appointed to chair both kind of courts,207 
and often the same law-readers sat alternately both in crown courts and in 
patrimonial courts.208
</p>
<p>Lay juries (n&auml;mnd) were an essential element in both kinds of courts. Both 
patrimonial courts and regular crown courts based their decisions on the  
same legal sources. Importantly, not only crown courts but also patrimonial 
courts were part of the same judicial hierarchy after the high courts were 
founded. It was thus possible to appeal from the decisions of the patrimonial 
court to the high court.209 Patrimonial courts, like crown courts, only investi-
gated serious criminal cases, the final decisions being made in the upper in-
stances.210 Importantly, the lord was also in charge of executing the decisions 
of his courts.211
</p>
<p>By analogy to the lawman&rsquo;s courts (lagmansr&auml;tt), the patrimonial lord also 
acted as an appeals instance for his own court in civil cases. His decision could 
then be appealed to a high court. As was the case for royal judges (lagman), the 
patrimonial lord in this capacity was entitled to levy a judicial tax. Patrimonial 
lords regularly delegated the judgeship also in appeals cases to paid substitutes 
(underlagman),212 who were to hold court in the barony or countship every 
three years.213 Again, little is known about how this faculty was enforced, al-
though the underlagman was usually appointed.214 At least in Jakob de la Gar-
die&rsquo;s Barony of Kimito, in southern Finland, the institution of patrimonial ap-
peal had fallen almost to desuetude by the 1660s. There had been no cases, and

<p>when one appeared, the count&rsquo;s judge and other personnel of the countship 
had to contact Turku High Court in order to have a lower lawman appointed 
for the case. On the other hand, the proceedings were not extremely formal, 
and sometimes difficult cases could be referred to the lord himself, the local 
governor, or the high court, even without the parties specifically asking for it or 
expressly consenting to the referral.215
</p>
<p>All patrimonial courts judged according to the same general law of the 
Swedish realm as crown courts. The use of g&aring;rdsr&auml;tt in the sense of stricter 
disciplinary law was not permitted on private goods, although they continued 
in use in royal castles and new ones were issued until 1655. However, it seems 
that at least in practice manorial statutes continued in use in private goods 
as well.216 The use of manorial discipline (hustukt) was then legalized during 
the tutorial government dominated by nobility in 1671, but again abolished in 
1675.217
</p>
<p>The fact that keeping a patrimonial court amounted to little judicial  
independence for its lord is crucial compared to the German (and French) 
patrimonial courts. They often enjoyed appeals privileges and because of the 
multiplicity of local customary laws, in practice often had at least some legal  
sources of their own. In comparison to patrimonial courts elsewhere, their 
Swedish counterparts were ordered strictly within the same judicial hierarchy 
as crown courts. Two exceptions are known: Carl Carlsson Gyllenhjelm (1574&ndash;
1650) had the privilege of not having to refer even the types of cases carry-
ing death punishments (livssaker) to a high court, and Per Brahe had a similar 
absolute jurisdiction over his estates in Visings&ouml; confirmed by a privilege in 
1654.218 And most importantly, the Swedish patrimonial judiciary was, at its 
largest, a short-lived phenomenon, lasting only some decades. The patrimonial 
courts of counts and barons were abolished in 1681, and the three remaining 
patrimonial courts with allegedly medieval origins &ndash; at Bergqvara, Torpa, and 
&Auml;ngs&ouml; &ndash; in 1691.219

<p>local district courts (h&auml;radsr&auml;tter). These courts dealt almost exclusively with 
peasant matters, as those of the nobility were (since 1614) by privilege mostly 
excluded and handled by the high courts, and clerical cases belonged to the 
consistories. Taxes were collected from the peasants to meet the costs of the 
courts of the countryside, and the peasants chose their representatives to serve 
in the n&auml;mnd, a rough equivalent of the jury,220 and to various other positions 
such as inspectional boards. Until the time of Gustav Vasa, the peasantry also 
chose the judge for the district courts, but from the 1560s onwards the crown 
took over the right to nominate the judge.221 From then on, and as the judges 
(or before the late 1600s, their substitutes, &ldquo;the law-readers&rdquo;) became increas-
ingly trained and more knowledgeable in legal matters and often even trained 
in law, their position vis-&agrave;-vis the n&auml;mnd grew more powerful.
</p>
<p>Even though district courts were peasant courts in many ways, they differed 
from the Livonian (or other European) manorial courts in some decisive as-
pects. Entities of local administration (socken) determined the scope of their 
jurisdiction, and the manorial lords automatically had no say in the courts, 
although it was to noblemen that the judgeships were enfeoffed. Second, even 
though a vast majority of the cases in country courts involved only peasants as 
parties, the law did not completely exclude noblemen from these courts. Thus, 
instead of manorial courts, the district courts were the equivalent of the Livo-
nian Landgerichte or general lower courts of the countryside. Before the found-
ing of the high courts, the district courts at least in principle dealt with noble 
matters as well. Even after high courts were established in the seventeenth 
century, country courts were in principle (although hardly in practice) respon-
sible for inquiring into the crimes of which a nobleman would be suspected. 
It was only after the initial inquiry that the documents were sent to the high 
court, in which the nobleman&rsquo;s peers took the final decision. In other words, 
even though the peasants largely ran the local country courts, from quite early 
on they became predominantly organs of the state, not judicial organs of the 
peasant estate. This is a big difference reflecting the strength of the Swedish 
state and the weakness of the estate society.
</p>
<p>220 The n&auml;mnds decided, together with the judge, questions of both fact and law. Whether 
this is a decisive difference to the English jury and how the Swedish institution is to be 
compared to the German Sch&ouml;ffen is a matter well meriting a study of its own.

<p>2.3.1 The Influence of Ius Commune in Sweden
The medieval and early modern Swedish legal history differs from the history 
of German law in important respects, which is crucial for understanding the 
differences between Sweden proper and Livonia. Sweden&rsquo;s social structure 
was also markedly different from that of Livonia. Compared to the political 
patchwork of Livonia, Sweden was a politically homogeneous kingdom, cen-
tral power being concentrated in the hands of a relatively small nobility sup-
porting the crown.
</p>
<p>Learned law probably never came to play as significant a role in Sweden 
as it did in Germany and other more southerly regions of Europe. With the 
exception of some expertise in canon law in the medieval Catholic Church, no 
academic legal science existed in Sweden prior to the seventeenth century. The 
situation was thus different from Livonia, where the reception of Roman law 
had advanced earlier and more thoroughly.222
</p>
<p>The influence of ius commune in Sweden is a theme in need of a modern 
legal-historical treatment. The traditional, nationalistic view has it that Swed-
ish law was not very much affected by the learned laws, Roman or canon. This 
view has been dominant since the writings of David Nehrman-Ehrenstr&aring;hle, 
who preferred not to list Roman law amongst the sources of Swedish law.223 
The statement was, for Nehrman, a political one and has to be read in the con-
temporary ideological and political context. In the sixteenth and seventeenth 
century, representatives of usus modernus pandectarum had developed Eu-
ropean legal science into an increasingly nationalistically oriented direction, 
combining Roman law sources with national sources. Some of them, often 
called &ldquo;institutionalists,&rdquo; pressed national legal institutions into the institu-
tionalist scheme of personae &ndash; res &ndash; actiones. Seventeenth-century Swedish 
legal scholars did this too, although (unlike in Germany, the Netherlands, or 
Italy), their influence on legal practice remained scarce.224

bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1960).

</p>
<p>That Roman law was not &ldquo;received&rdquo; has then developed into one of the 
specificities of Swedish legal historiography. The Swedish &ldquo;non-reception&rdquo; 
has to be understood against European legal history, which after the Second 
World War developed the theory of the reception of Roman law.225 The Rezep-
tion could be a wholesale one, Vollrezeption, which was the case in Germany 
itself. In other parts of Europe, such as France, one could talk about a partial 
reception or Teilrezeption.226 Some other parts were supposedly not affected 
at all. The prime examples for the last case were England and Scandinavia.  
In recent research, however, a more nuanced picture of the influence of 
learned laws has emerged. The influence is no longer seen in rigid categories 
of &ldquo;full&rdquo; or &ldquo;partial&rdquo; reception, but more as a combination of substantial and 
procedural components in differing degrees or as a process of &ldquo;scientification&rdquo;  
(Verwissenschaftlichungsprozess).227
</p>
<p>The traditional view has, however, much truth to it. Scandinavian law 
surely differs from the German, French, or Spanish law as far as the degree of 
legal learnedness in the early modern period is concerned. As shown above, 
the influence of canon law in the Middle Ages was already slighter in Swe-
den when compared to the European heartlands. Right up to the nineteenth 
century, Sweden had few legal professionals, which were an absolute prerequi-
site for any thorough reception of Roman law learning. It would nevertheless 
be wrong to belittle the influence of ius commune in Sweden. Several recent 
studies have shown that Swedish law was in continuous communication and 
exchange with the continental legal ideas.228 The leading figures of Swedish 
law, having studied in continental (mainly German) universities, were keenly 
aware of the newest developments in European law. These ideas could and did 
not, however, transfer as such to the Swedish legal system. Far from it, they

<p>were filtered and reprocessed, so that they tended to look sometimes quite dif-
ferent when finally transplanted as parts of Swedish law.229
</p>
<p>Ripples of learned law thus flowed into Sweden from Germany, along the 
same route as the Lutheran Reformation. In Swedish temporal courts, the lay 
judges also began losing their positions to the crown-appointed judiciary in 
the sixteenth century. King John iii reserved the right to appoint lower court 
judges to the king in 1569 and granted the privilege of the tax revenues pertain-
ing to these judicial offices to noblemen. This, however, did not mean that legal 
expertise would have taken over in the courts. Legal training among the judi-
ciary did not become normal in the Swedish courts until the founding of the 
academic legal faculties and appeals courts in the first half of the seventeenth 
century.230 Even then, laymen kept their strong position in the courts, as they 
have done to this day.
</p>
<p>The lack of legal expertise placed limits on the reception of Roman law in 
the secular courts. Complicated legal theories had no fertile soil in Swedish 
legal life. Criminal law as legal science did not exist in sixteenth-century Swe-
den, any more than legal science in general. The situation was different from 
Germany, where the Lutheran Reformation could make use of academically 
trained legal professionals. In spite of this, the Catholic Church had already 
managed to influence Swedish legislation in the Middle Ages. This influence, 
however, is not to be confused with the professionalization of both secular and 
ecclesiastical venues in the more southerly parts of the European continent. 
As to criminal law, the learned theories of proof, torture, and individual guilt 
had little chance of reaching the vast majority of the unlearned secular courts 
of medieval Sweden.
</p>
<p>Examples abound in every field of law. A few may suffice. The first example 
is the legal theory of Olaus Petri. Olaus is mostly known for two things, as the 
chief reformer in Sweden and the author of the Instructions for the Judge. The 
Instructions were not his only legal work, but were clearly the best known. 
Olaus, born either in 1493 or 1497 in the town of &Ouml;rebro, studied theology in 
the University of Uppsala (founded 1477) and thereafter possibly in Rostock.

<p>He certainly continued his studies in Leipzig in 1516 and still in the same 
year in Wittenberg, possibly hearing the lectures of both Martin Luther and 
Philipp Melanchthon. Promoted to magister in 1518, Olaus returned to Sweden 
and made a remarkable career in the church and as Gustav Vasa&rsquo;s Chancellor, 
with whom he vigorously promoted the cause of the protestant reformation in 
Sweden.231
</p>
<p>Olaus was not, however, only a religious reformer but was also an important 
legal writer, thus continuing the medieval tradition in which theologians of-
ten took stands on legal problems as law and morals were in close connection 
to each other.232 Olaus, &ldquo;the first Swedish legal thinker,&rdquo; probably wrote the 
Instructions in the 1530s. Older legal history has shown that Olaus used do-
mestic Swedish law, the Bible, as well as Roman-canon law as material for the 
Instructions.233 Despite the wide array of sources which have been identified 
behind Olaus&rsquo;s work, they have typically been seen as &ldquo;the simple and sound 
rules of the common man.&rdquo;234 This is the notion of the Instructions that has 
been carried over until today: the rules continue to be printed in Finnish and 
Swedish statute collections, and Olaus&rsquo;s instructions are widely respected as 
an expression of wise legal thinking, contrary to overly theorisations of today&rsquo;s 
lawyers&rsquo; law. However, as I have shown elsewhere, this conception of Olaus&rsquo;s

</p>
<p>Instructions for the Judges as representing the common man&rsquo;s justice, or at 
least a kind of Swedish &ldquo;Germanic law,&rdquo; is a product of early twentieth cen-
tury. In fact, Olaus was one of chief importers of European ius commune, as 
far as criminal legal procedure is concerned. His torture rules, although their 
precise meaning is notoriously difficult to decipher, are a good example of ius 
commune exposed in a simplified way for the common man to understand. 
The detailed theories of evidence and other procedural niceties were filtered 
through to the instructions (and Swedish law) in a simplified form which the 
unlearned lower courts could understand. However, in principle Olaus repre-
sents a  Roman-canon theory of the law of proof which imported a simplified, 
watered-down version to Sweden. The reformer took the practical ability of the 
Swedish legal world into consideration, and rejected what he must have con-
sidered to be excessive complexities of the Roman-canon legal theory and phe-
nomena such as judicial torture in its full form, which he obviously thought 
would not properly fit the Swedish system of lay-dominated judiciary.235
</p>
<p>As stated above the influence of learned law has, however, to do with other 
things rather than simply substantial rules. This brings me to my second exam-
ple, police statutes, new legislative technique that conquered Europe from the 
late Middle Ages onwards. Police regulation appeared as part of both church 
and secular legislation.236 The concept of police (politia) was introduced in 
Sweden through German influence in the time of Gustav I around the mid-
sixteenth century.237 Kings had issued statutes (stadga) from the thirteenth 
century onwards, but until the sixteenth century the statutes can more aptly 
be characterized as pacts between the crown and the magnates than as actual

<p>laws given from above.238 The concept of police law was not customarily used 
to separate one class of statute from the others. In legal language the concept 
was, nevertheless, associated with &ldquo;the maintenance of law and order,&rdquo; or order 
in general.239
</p>
<p>Although a few scholarly works drawing on European legislative theory 
were published in Sweden in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,240 the 
concept of police law was never clearly defined or separated from the concept 
of general law. Nevertheless, police ordinances were as important a part of the 
state-building process in Sweden as in elsewhere in Europe.241 The power to 
issue police ordinances, ius politiae, considerably widened the power of the 
prince,242 and that power was at the same time an important building block in 
the powers of the prince. About two thirds of the Swedish police ordinances 
dealt with the economic system and professions, but other areas covered by 
police regulation in other parts of Europe were regulated in Sweden as well.243 
It seems that many of the objectives of the police ordinances could not be met 
in practice, however.244 The fate of the Swedish police ordinances was in this 
respect similar to that of the German ordinances.245

<p>The Catholic Church had sanctioned less serious crimes and other mis-
behaviour before the Reformation, and the Lutheran Church continued the 
practice. The Church Law of 1686 sums up the post-Reformation development. 
The Law of 1686 of course gives only a partial picture of the church&rsquo;s disci-
plinary law.246 As mentioned above, ecclesiastical police legislation was not

</p>
<p>incorporated into the Church Law, the issuing of such legislation being con-
sidered to be the king&rsquo;s personal prerogative.247 The logic is thus the same as 
when secular police legislation was left out of the Swedish Law of 1734. A sig-
nificant amount of ecclesiastical police legislation was in fact issued, much of 
which concerned the consistory court and the parish level. For example, the 
Royal Statute of 1687 on oaths and breaches of the Sabbath contained a num-
ber of prescriptions for punishment in the stocks, those unable to pay a fine 
having &ldquo;to sit in shame in the stocks on Sunday outside the door of the church 
before the whole parish.&rdquo; Those who cursed in church were sentenced to heavy 
fines, which could be commuted to public penance and sitting in the stocks for 
four Sundays.248
</p>
<p>The European influences were filtered to Sweden and changed, becoming 
parts of Swedish law as a result of conscious picking and choosing. In this pro-
cess not only the local needs but also practical possibilities needed to be con-
sidered. As a result, Swedish law at the beginning of the seventeenth century 
remained relatively little influenced by European learned law. At the end of 
the century, Swedish law had acquired many more characteristics of European 
learned law, but was still accommodating them into the local, lay-dominated 
context.
</p>
<p>2.4 Summary
</p>
<p>When the Swedish legal and political situation in the Middle Ages is com-
pared to that of Livonia, clear differences emerge. Livonia&rsquo;s political system re-
mained heterogeneous and dispersed throughout the Middle Ages, right until 
the Swedish era. The Emperor&rsquo;s more or less symbolic position apart, no strong 
central power ever arose in Old Livonia. The bishoprics had yielded much of 
their internal power to the vassals, and although the Teutonic Order was the 
closest thing Livonia had by way of approaching modern statehood, not even 
the Order could secure power over the whole of the loose confederation of 
practically independent states that was Livonia. Consequently, the legal pic-
ture remained colourful. All of the estates were governed by their own bodies  
of law: the towns had their urban laws, the nobles their feudal knightly laws

<p>(Ritterrecht), the Church its canon law, and the peasants their customary ma-
norial laws. In addition to this typically medieval conglomerate of legal bodies, 
some Roman law was received as a consequence of learned legal communica-
tion with the Empire, its universities and high courts. In these respects, medieval  
Livonia was no different to other parts of the medieval Reich. It did, however, 
differ from Castile, England, and France, in which royal power had begun to 
centralise from the thirteenth century onwards and where this centralisation 
was seen in the attempt at legal compilations, or at least in the forming of a 
state wide &ldquo;common law,&rdquo; in the case of England. The Livonian situation also 
distinguished itself from the rest of the Reich in the sixteenth century in that, 
unlike in many other parts of the Empire, very little centralisation occurred at 
the territorial level.249
</p>
<p>The Livonian experience thus differed also from the Swedish situation in 
important respects. The Swedish society, unlike the Livonian one, had weak 
estates as counterparts to the rising royal power. None of the medieval towns 
were comparable to Riga or Tallinn in prosperity, although Visby had been im-
portant until the thirteenth century and Stockholm had been rising since the 
fourteenth. Stockholm with its ca. 10,000 inhabitants around 1600 was, how-
ever, far smaller than Riga with its 30,000 inhabitants but somewhat bigger 
than Tallinn.250 The Church was increasingly making its voice heard from the 
early thirteenth century onwards, but it was forced to do so with the help of 
the local magnates. Canon law as such, a separate body of law administered 
by the Church&rsquo;s own learned bureaucrats and judiciary, was not a viable an 
instrument in Sweden, where the ecclesiastic tradition was thin, and learned 
churchmen and lawyers rare. It was a much better strategy for the Church to 
influence the secular legislation and have its interests secured directly by way 
of making sure that appropriate paragraphs found their way into the chapters 
concerning marriage, inheritance, and other central issues which were impor-
tant for the Catholic Church. The Reformation made whatever canon law that 
had been adapted in Sweden into a part of Swedish law, and the former church 
courts were now subjected to the crown. Sweden was on its way to becoming 
one of the most centralized countries of Europe, not only politically but also 
legally. Positive royal law assumed an important position as far as legal sources 
</p>
<p>249 The &ldquo;territorialisation&rdquo; should not, however, be exaggerated. As Joachim Whaley em-
phasizes, the princely power was internally limited by the Estates and the rights of the 
subjects (according to the principle quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus debet approbari) and 
externally by princes&rsquo; subordination to the emperor. Whaley, Holy Roman Empire, 48.

<p>were concerned, and although we cannot speak of legal positivism in the mod-
ern sense, of course, in relation to other sources the enacted royal legislation 
clearly outweighed the other sources. Importantly, the influence of the learned 
ius commune remained insignificant. The differences between Livonia, resem-
bling a legal mosaic, and the more monolithic Sweden were, then, consider-
able. How would Sweden, having secured Livonia within its possessions in the 
1630s, face this legally asymmetric situation?</p>

<p>The Reorganisation of the Livonian Judiciary

<p>3.1 The Alternatives: Colonial Systems and Their Judicial Organisations
</p>
<p>Recent research has described early modern states in different ways.1 Refer-
ring to territorial aspects of the state, historians use the term &ldquo;composite state.&rdquo; 
The term appears in connection to federative and confederative polities since 
Pufendorf, but was coined in its modern meaning by H.G. Koenigsberger.2 
Historians see the composite state as a way of combining some of the huge 
number of independent or quasi-independent medieval polities. Lacking the 
strength to unify completely all of the territories, early modern princes resort-
ed to the composite state, under the umbrella of which the different territories 
were allowed to retain differing degrees of independence.3
</p>
<p>For Koenigsberger, &ldquo;most states in the early modern period were composite 
states, including more than one country under the sovereignty of one ruler.&rdquo; 
Composite states came in two categories: those whose parts were separated 
by other states or by the sea (such as the Spanish Habsburg monarchy or 
Brandenburg-Prussia), and contiguous composite states (such as England and 
Wales, or Poland and Lithuania).4 J.H. Elliott then developed the idea of &ldquo;com-
posite monarchies&rdquo; (as he called them) further, exploring in detail the rea-
sons for their birth and survival, and the different modes in which composite

<p>monarchies appeared in the early modern world. Elliott refers to the derecho in-
diano scholar Juan Sol&oacute;rzano y Pereira (1575&ndash;1655),5 who in his Pol&iacute;tica Indiana 
(1658) divided newly acquired territories in two classes. In &ldquo;accessory unions,&rdquo; 
the acquired territory became legally a part of the acquiring state, the laws of 
which now governed the new lands as well. In unions aeque principaliter, the 
constituent kingdoms continued as separate entities, with their own laws and 
privileges.6 &ldquo;The greatest advantage,&rdquo; says Elliott, &ldquo;of union aeque principaliter 
was that by ensuring the survival of their customary laws and institutions it 
made more palatable to the inhabitants the kind of transfer of territory that 
was inherent in the international dynastic game.&rdquo;7
</p>
<p>Composite states were often layered, in that their different parts consisted 
themselves of several territories, held together by not much else than a com-
mon ruler: &ldquo;Each territory &ndash; or rather the social elite of each territory &ndash; had its 
distinctive relation to the ruler, its privileges, its own law code, its administra-
tive system staffed by that same local elite, and often its own estate assembly.&rdquo;8 
All composite states share elements of indirect rule, in which the local authori-
ties enjoy some degree of autonomy over the local affairs.9 Conceptually, then, 
composite states differ little from empires, which have been defined as &ldquo;large 
political units, expansionist or with a memory of power extended over space, 
polities that maintain distinction and hierarchy as they incorporate people.&rdquo;10 
Empires do not need to have an emperor.11 In everyday terminology, the term 
&ldquo;empire&rdquo; may of course evoke the image of a large combination of territories, 
whereas a composite state can be small. The difference is vague nevertheless, 
and the two terms can well be used as synonyms.

<p>differs from what is traditionally conceived of as colonization. Spain&rsquo;s con-
quest of Central and South America, England&rsquo;s conquest of its North American 
colonies, or Portugal&rsquo;s conquest of Brazil or its Asian possessions &ndash; the &ldquo;clas-
sic&rdquo; cases of colonization &ndash; can be characterized as professional legal orders 
assuming domination over traditional, non-professional legal orders.12 As re-
gards all of these cases, legal domination was very much in conjunction with a 
military suppression and what is more, with more or less massive founding of 
colonies &ndash; as the name &ldquo;colonization&rdquo; implies. The medieval personality prin-
ciple was followed: the colonizers took their law with them, just as they took 
their language and culture.13 The case of Swedish Livonia was demographically 
different. No large groups of Swedish peasants or town-dwellers immigrated 
to the conquered territories. The most visible group of Swedes in Livonia were 
high aristocrats, such as Jacob de la Gardie and Axel Oxenstierna, who were 
enfeoffed large estates as rewards for their military services, and bureaucrats 
who came to occupy certain key positions in the administration.
</p>
<p>The early modern states &ndash; whether called composite states or empires &ndash; 
aimed at growth in two ways: structurally and territorially. The logic of growth 
led the early modern states to territorial growth, although this was by no 
means an early modern invention. The early modern state needed resources, 
which before industrialism meant agrarian land, urban economies, and other 
humane and material resources. Territorial conquests were an efficient way of 
achieving these resources.14 Structural growth meant that the early modern 
state aimed at reducing, within its traditional boundaries, all competing pow-
ers such as independent cities, feudal enclaves, and other centres of power.15
</p>
<p>Seventeenth-century Sweden was typically such a composite state geared 
at both structural and territorial expansion, with possessions not only in the 
region inhabited by speakers of the Swedish language, but also in Finland, the 
</p>
<p>12 The terminology is introduced in Ugo Mattei, &ldquo;Three Patterns of Law: Taxonomy and 
Change in the World&rsquo;s Legal System,&rdquo; The American Journal of Comparative Law 45 (1997),

</p>
<p>13 Medieval German laws, such as the Mirror of Saxony and the law of Magdeburg are 
the paradigmatic cases in point. See Ernst Eichler and Heiner L&uuml;ck (eds.), Rechts- und

<p>Baltic area, and Germany. The basic composition of the Swedish state thus did 
not differ essentially from other composite states of the early modern period, 
such as France, Spain, or England. Each and every time a European state man-
aged to add new territories to the already existing conglomerate, either by war 
or by inheritance, the conditions of addition were separately negotiated and 
decided. Complete incorporation was an exception rather than the rule, and 
the annexed territory was usually allowed to keep its constitutional arrange-
ment, general law, judicial system, and church organization.16
</p>
<p>When observed as composite states, the difference between colonial powers 
and other early modern states diminishes if not disappears. As state construc-
tions, England, Spain, and Portugal did not fundamentally differ from Sweden, 
Denmark, and Russia. They all aimed at both structural and territorial growth, 
some with greater success than others. In all these countries, structural and 
territorial growth was intertwined. All of them were composite states in the 
way defined by Koenigsberger and Elliott. Just as Elliott explained, compos-
ite states differed as to the extent and the ways the constituent parts of the 
monarchy were integrated into the realm. The dividing line was not, as we 
can conclude reading Sol&oacute;rzano Pereira, whether the state was composed of a  
European monarchy and its overseas colonies, or of culturally and politically 
distinct European polities.
</p>
<p>All early modern powers aiming at territorial growth had to take a stand on 
a series of questions. Economy, church, defence, and administration all need-
ed to be arranged. The legal question was among the most urgent, because it 
had to do with pacifying the conquered lands. A well-functioning military was 
needed to keep the outer enemies at bay, but a well-functioning legal system 
was just as necessary to keep peace within the borders of the territory. Arrang-
ing law and the legal system led to a host of other questions. What law was to 
be followed, which legal sources to be used? How were appeals to be organised: 
within the conquered lands only or all the way to the mother country? Who 
were going to be the judges: learned or unlearned, local or imported? Was ex-
trajudicial conflict-solving to be tolerated and to what extent?
</p>
<p>Spanish America is a perfect example of the difficulties that geography 
could cause. It took about six weeks for a ship to reach America from Spain, 
which obviously made it difficult to administer the region efficiently. The 
Spanish, however, developed a rather efficient means of organizing law and 
administration in their colonies. One of the central instruments of governance 
was statutory law. As time passed and more legislation was issued for the  
Indies specifically, Castilian statutes increasingly became a subsidiary body

<p>of law, retreating into the background. Spanish colonial law, derecho indiano,  
was the &ldquo;compound of legal rules applicable in the Indies, that is, in the  
American, Asian and Oceanic territories dominated by Spain.&rdquo;17 Castilian 
law was used whenever derecho indiano did not provide the answer to a legal 
problem.18
</p>
<p>The crown with its Council of the Indies steered the development of the 
derecho indiano rather effectively not only by employing the most modern 
legislative technique effectively, but by other means as well. Richard Ross has 
pointed out how the crown constantly kept the communication channels be-
tween Madrid and the overseas colonies open. Appeals to the Council of the 
Indies were encouraged and taken advantage of, and the systems of visitation 
and residencia allowed the key officials&rsquo; activities to be supervised.19 Both of 
the institutions had their origin in medieval canon law, but were used particu-
larly effectively in Hispanic America. Visitations were more or less regular in-
spections effected upon any government official or governmental body, and 
</p>
<p>17 The Real Pragm&aacute;tica was the most ceremonial of all statute types that the Crown issued, 
but they were seldom issued for America. Most of the significant pieces of legislation fell 
into the category of Real Provisi&oacute;n, which followed the medieval tradition of royal legisla-
tion. Numerically most of the new statutes were, however, of the type Real C&eacute;dula or Real 
Carta, which mostly handled individual cases and were addressed to individual authori-
ties or people. Ordenanzas and Instrucciones were, then, statutes largely handling entities 
of problems.
</p>
<p>Spanish colonial law can then be divided into a. norms specifically created for the 
Indies (derecho indiano propiamente tal o municipal); b. Castilian law (derecho castellano), 
which was used if &ldquo;proper derecho indiano&rdquo; did contain the normative solution needed; 
and c. Indian law (derecho ind&iacute;gena), or the law of the aboriginals. &ldquo;[E]l conjunto de reglas 
jur&iacute;dicas aplicables en Indias, o sea, los territorios de Am&eacute;rica, Asia y Ocean&iacute;a dominados

Spanish colonial law, defines derecho indiano more in detail as &ldquo;a system of law, doctrines, 
and customs, created or accepted by the Castilian kings, in order to organize the spiritual 
or secular government of the Hispanic New World, regulate the condition of its inhabit-
ants, direct the navigation and commerce, and, above all, ensure the incorporation of the 
Indians to the Catholic faith.&rdquo; For the complicated relation between the notions ius com-

<p>every major official was subject to a residencia procedure at the end of his pe-

ministration, although because of the vastness of the Spanish American terri-
tories a certain degree of local administration was inevitable. Thus, practically 
all levels of administration also issued legislation. Viceroys and audiencias 
could issue statutes of general nature as representatives of the crown. Lower 
level administrative authorities &ndash; general-captains, governors, and district and 
municipal authorities &ndash; issued their own statutes, which were subject to the 
acceptance of the higher administrative organs. Therefore, derecho indiano in-
evitably experienced certain local differentiation over time.20 In spite of the 
production of local legislation and the ensuing differentiation of Spanish co-
lonial law, the Spanish crown thus created mechanisms to ensure that legal 
communication followed smoothly from the colonies to Madrid, as Richard 
Ross has stressed. Communication was not an end in itself; instead, it made 
effective administrative control and legal regulation possible.
</p>
<p>The situation was different in North America. Besides a kind of police 
regulation, which started to develop from early on mainly in the colonies 
themselves,21 the law developed on the basis of the English common law doc-
trines from England. This was, however, not the case right at the beginning 
of the colonization. William Nelson has observed that in Virginia, the &ldquo;rulers 
sought to accomplish their main chore, which was to coerce labor out of the lo-
cal inhabitants, through intimidation and brutality, while New England&rsquo;s lead-
ers strove to create a religious utopia by recourse to the law of God, not the law 
of England.&rdquo; These norms took the form of statutory law, such as Dale&rsquo;s Code 
of Virginia (1611), and in addition, English customary law was also used. In the 
initial period of the colonization, however, English common law was not on 
the agenda.22 Common law with all its intricacies was simply too sophisticated 
a tool for directing the new colonies effectively and, what is more, it could not

<p>function without lawyers. Common law might have been, as Lawrence Fried-
man puts it, &ldquo;somehow the norm; colonial differences, then, were examples of 
some sort of rude primitivity.&rdquo;23
</p>
<p>The common law arrived as soon as lawyers started arriving. They often had 
legal education and continued fomenting their need of legal information read-
ing English treatises.24 The legal orders of the colonies were also at the other 
end of the string held by the Privy Council in London, although, as Richard 
Ross has observed, the Council&rsquo;s decisions were way too few to control the le-
gal life in the colonies effectively. The Privy Council took, for one thing, only 
relatively few cases from the colonies for consideration. In this respect, the 
difference to the Council of the Indies is clear.25
</p>
<p>Although in principle the overseas colonizing experiences thus did not 
differ from the geographical expansions in Europe or elsewhere, differences 
abound as to the ways colonized lands were governed. In addition to the points 
raised above, recent research has emphasized the importance of not only the 
circumstances of the conquered areas but also the legal and political models of 
the mother country. The case of France has been highlighted as one in which 
the complex nature of the legal and political authorities in the colonizing state 
reflected on the colonial state building. According to Helen Dewar, &ldquo;colonial 
state building in the early modern period is usually seen in terms of an actively 
engaged crown of the delegation of power and privileges to private enterprise, 
either a company or an individual proprietor.&rdquo; The &ldquo;government&rdquo; overseas, 
however, far from forming a neat unity, consisted of &ldquo;company representatives, 
agents to the viceroy, and outside traders [who] came armed with knowledge 
of customary privileges, legal instruments, and the labyrinthine justice system 
in France.&rdquo; For instance, the Parliament of Brittany did its best to protect the 
trading privileges of the Breton settlers to New France against the crown&rsquo;s at-
tempt to establish exclusive privileges for other parties. The Parliament had 
a means of doing this, because according to the French law sovereign courts 
(which the provincial parlaments were) had to register royal letters patents 
before they could enter into force.26 The legal pluralism of France was thus 
doubled in the colonies.

<p>The solutions of colonial powers thus differed from each other considerably. 
Their starting points were different, and so were, at least partly, their goals and 
means of achieving those goals. They ranged from Spain&rsquo;s relatively close inte-
gration of the colonies into the administrative and legal structure of the moth-
er country to England&rsquo;s rather loose leash on the North American colonies.
</p>
<p>How does Sweden fit into the picture of these different models? The larg-
est difference between Spain and England on the one hand, and Sweden on 
the other, was perhaps not only differences vis-&agrave;-vis the distances to the new 
territories. Instead, an even greater difference consisted of the fact that the 
new regions falling into the hands of the Swedish conquerors already had le-
gal systems comparable, and indeed in many ways superior according to early 
modern standards, to that of Sweden proper. For Spain and England the cru-
cial question was to what extent they should let their legal orders &ldquo;exported&rdquo; 
overseas diverge from the law of the motherlands, and should they perhaps 
actively foster such development. The question for Sweden was, instead, how 
to deal with the local laws and lawyers, and to what extent should Sweden try 
to influence the laws of the new provinces.
</p>
<p>Livonia was, however, not the first of Sweden&rsquo;s overseas conquests: some ex-
perience was already there. Sweden needed to tackle the same problems as the 
other expanding powers of the early modern period. The challenges that the 
Swedes faced differed, to be sure, from the ones major colonial powers such 
as England, Spain and Portugal encountered when attempting to assume con-
trol over their new possessions much farther away from the motherland than  
Livonia was from Sweden. Similarly, the lack of pluralism, as in the case of Swe-
den, was doubled. The Swedish crown obviously did not have to wrangle with 
the kind of complex legal pluralism of the French kind, although compared to 
Sweden proper Livonian law was clearly more pluralistic. Indeed, the Swed-
ish crown had no easy task in implementing its policies in Livonia. Simply 
formulating those policies was a complex undertaking, in which the interests 
of the Swedish estates as well as those of the Livonian estates had to be con-
sidered and comprised. After the conquest, it had been far from self-evident 
which strategy the Swedes would adopt in relation to the conquered Livonia.  
Governor-General Johan Skytte favoured a thorough incorporation, whereas the 
King and his chancellor adopted a stance that could be called one of political 
realism, in other words, letting Livonia stay relatively loosely aligned to the rest 
of the realm.27 Instead of irritating the Livonian estates, they probably thought 
it politically wise to let the Livonians stay aloof from the Swedish rike. The at-
titude showed in the way the structure of the Livonian Lutheran Church was

</p>
<p>allowed to develop along the lines of German models: instead of the Swedish-
type episcopal chapters (domkapitel) with priests in charge, mixed superinten-
dencies were established in Livonia.28
</p>
<p>Once this policy was formulated and after some initial problems with the 
comital jurisdictions described above were solved, the crown&rsquo;s judicial and 
political authority was not continuously challenged in Livonia. The Swedish 
judicial landscape provided no similar host of alternative judicial instances or 
privileges, as in the French case, which would tend to be reproduced in the 
conquered lands.
</p>
<p>Many models of incorporating annexed territories existed, even within 
Sweden itself, and they were flexibly used to meet different political needs. 
Finland, the eastern half of the realm, had belonged to Sweden as a fully in-
tegrated part since the Middle Ages. Finland thus shared the same legal and 
judicial system, and church organization, as Sweden proper. In 1645, Denmark 
ceded Oesel (Saaremaa), Gotland, J&auml;mtland, H&auml;rjedalen, and Halland to Swe-
den (although at this stage Halland passed to Sweden as a surety only for a 
period of thirty years). A Swedish governor was appointed to rule over Oesel, 
which was otherwise allowed to maintain the relatively free position it had 
enjoyed under Denmark. The other regions were fully incorporated as parts 
of Sweden. The full incorporation brought Swedish law, administration, taxes, 
and church organization to the newly annexed provinces. In exchange, the es-
tates of the incorporated provinces were given seats in the Swedish Diet. The 
fate of Scania, Blekinge, Bohusl&auml;n, and Halland (previously ceded to Sweden as 
a surety) was slightly different. After another victorious war against Denmark, 
Sweden annexed these territories in 1658. They were not, however, fully incor-
porated in that they got to keep their laws and privileges at first, although the 
local estates got their representation at the Diet immediately. Full integration 
only followed in 1683 as a consequence of another (from the Danish point of 
view) unsuccessful war, in which Denmark had attempted to gain back the lost 
provinces.29 By the time the Danish territories came to be joined with Sweden, 
the new mother country had already had the chance to experiment with its 
Baltic and German possessions. Compared to the conquests from Denmark, 
the Baltic regions and the territories within the Holy Roman Empire were al-
lowed considerably more leeway.

<p>3.2 Sweden&rsquo;s Other Overseas Possessions: Organizing the Judiciary in 
Estonia and the Reich
</p>
<p>3.2.1 The Duchy of Estonia
The Livonian war (1558&ndash;1582) brought the Livonian Order State to an end. The 
southern parts fell to the Lithuanian-Polonian Confederation, and Sweden ac-
quired the possession of the northern parts in 1561. After negotiations with the 
representatives of the Swedish crown, the powerful bourgeoisie of Tallinn, and 
the vassals of Harjumaa and J&auml;rvamaa transferred their loyalty from the Ger-
man Knight Order to the Swedish King Erik xiv in June 1561. The King prom-
ised to uphold the old privileges and laws of the nobility. The possessory rights 
to their manors, together with criminal jurisdiction (peinliche Gerichtsbarkeit), 
were confirmed as well.30 A governor (from 1674 onwards a governor-general) 
represented the Swedish crown in the province. The Estonian estates were not 
represented at the Swedish Diet, but the Estonian nobility convened instead at 
their own Landtag.
</p>
<p>Until the beginning of the seventeenth century the law of the Duchy 
of Estonia remained based on its medieval sources. In other words, the law  
continued &ndash; as far as we know &ndash; based on the same premises as it had during the 
Ordenstaat. The oldest medieval collection of feudal law, which has relevance  
mainly in what later became the Duchy of Estonia, was the Feudal Law of 
Waldemar and Eric (Das Waldemar-Erich&rsquo;se Lehnrecht). According to chroni-
cles it was given by the Danish king Waldemar ii and first put into writing by 
King Eric vi of Denmark in 1315. The contents of the law were heavily influ-
enced by contemporary feudal law in Germany, which is understandable tak-
ing into consideration that the royal vassals came from Germany. The Feudal 
Law of Wiek-Oesel (Das Wiek-Oeselsche Lehnrecht) dates roughly to the mid-
fourteenth century. Of its five books, three entail an adoption of the Saxon 
Mirror and the fifth an edition of the oldest Livonian feudal law. The fourth 
book contains the peasant law (Livisches Bauernrecht) probably originating 
from the time of Bishop Albert i of Riga (1198&ndash;1229).31 As in Livonia, the influ-
ence of Roman-canon ius commune or gemeines Recht started at least around 
mid-sixteenth century in secular law, and much earlier in ecclesiastical court 
practice.32 Roman law was customarily used as a subsidiary source whenever

<p>the domestic failed to provide the necessary rule.33 The privileges of the Esto-
nian estates and towns were confirmed in the capitulation treaty of 1561 and 
after that by each new Swedish monarch.34
</p>
<p>Similar to how the Polish conquerors in Livonia initiated David Hilchen&rsquo;s 
codification work, in Estonia the task was given to the Secretary of the Estonia 
Order of Knights, Moritz Brandis (ca. 1550&ndash;ca. 1604).35 &ldquo;The Knightly Laws of 
the Principate of Estonia&rdquo; (Die Ritterrechte des F&uuml;rstentums Estland) of 1600 
was a collection of the court practice of the various courts, both upper and 
lower, of the duchy. The collection had practical goals, and it probably became 
at least to some extent used in the courts.
</p>
<p>However, after fifty years the need for a new collection had emerged. This 
time the Philipp Crusius,36 judge at the Tallinn City Court, took over the job 
and produced the &ldquo;Knightly and Feudal Law of the Duchy of Estonia&rdquo; (Des 
Herzogtums Esten Ritter- und Landrechte) in 1650. The collection was based on 
practically all possible sources: the medieval feudal law, privileges from the 
Danish periods onwards, court practice of the Estonian Upper Court, and the 
Brandis Collection. Crusius built his collection also, much more so than Bran-
dis had done, on the contemporary literature of gemeines Recht. The criminal 
law of the Reich, Constitutio Criminalis Carolina, figures in the sources as well. 
Crusius&rsquo;s work was meant to be confirmed by Queen Christina. She refused to 
do this, however, before she had the chance to compare the collection to the 
sources used. King Charles xii finally confirmed the collection as law in force, 
but only insofar as it was compatible with the privileges and the feudal law.37
</p>
<p>As for the town law, Tallinn had adopted the law of L&uuml;beck in 1248. The town 
had ever since developed pari passu with the law of the mother city, although 
with increasing influence from Hamburg. Even after the coming of the Swedes 
and at least until the end of the sixteenth century, Tallinn followed the legal 
developments of L&uuml;beck closely, and the reforms of the mother town usually 
found their way to Tallinn law as well.38 In addition to keeping up with L&uuml;-
beck law, Tallinn was active in developing its own statutes as well, passing the

</p>
<p>The judiciary continued almost unchanged until the early seventeenth cen-
tury as well. The district courts (Landgerichte) were in charge of the nobility&rsquo;s 
civil and criminal cases. The Manngerichte judged, among other things, bor-
der disputes, and handled the inspection of criminal cases of the lower estates 
(the actual adjucation pertaining to the Landgericht). The Hakenrichter was in 
charge of police cases.40
</p>
<p>In the practice of district courts (Landgericht), the Swedish overlord thus 
made some efforts to unify the complex law of its new duchy. These efforts nev-
er, however, amounted to any &ldquo;Swedification&rdquo; of the law. Instead, the projects 
of both Brandis and especially Crusius probably contributed to the advance-
ment of European ius commune in the region.
</p>
<p>3.2.2 The Territories in the German Reich
As a result of the Thirty Years War and the Peace of Westphalia, Sweden ac-
quired territories within the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. The 
Swedish kings became vassals of the emperor in the Duchies of Bremen-
Verden and Vorpommern, the Principality of R&uuml;gen, the town and the Barony 
of Wismar, and the Cathedral Chapter of Hamburg. Queen Christina, only  
21 years of age at the time, needed to organize the judiciary in these territories. 
Not only did Sweden&rsquo;s own interests as the new lord of the conquered territo-
ries compel her to that, but the provisions of the peace treaty obliged her as 
well. During the peace negotiations at Osnabr&uuml;ck, the Emperor had granted 
the Swedish crown a so-called appeals privilege (privilegium de appellando,  
Appellationsprivilegium). Within the Empire, several kinds of appeals privi-
leges existed traditionally, limiting the appeals to the imperial courts (the Im-
perial Chamber Court and the Aulic Court).41 The Swedish crown managed 
a full appeals privilege (privilegium de non appellando illimitatum) for itself,  
meaning that practically all appeals to the imperial courts were forbidden. 
The full privilege, however, entailed the responsibility of organizing a ter-
ritorial high court to remedy the possibility of appeals which was lacking in

</p>
<p>the system.42 However, not even the full appeals privilege excluded all appeals: 
the so-called nullity claims (Nichtigkeitsklage) and petitions, in which it was 
claimed that the petitioner did not get his or her case heard at all (Rechtsverwei-
gerungsklage), remained still possible.43 In the case of the Swedish territories 
in Germany, these claims still went to the highest tribunals of the Reich, just as 
from all other parts of the empire.44 The Swedish delegation managed, how-
ever, to negotiate still a further privilege of determining in each case whether 
the Imperial Chamber Court or the Aulic Court would hear them (privilegio 
fori electi).45
</p>
<p>A high appellate court (Oberappellationsgericht) was thus founded in Wis-
mar, the location of which was central from the point of view of all Swedish 
possessions in Germany. After a long stage of preparations, the Court could 
finally start operating in 1653. The Court was still not free of troubles, as neither 
the local estates nor the crown itself were willing to finance the new court.  
Johan Oxenstierna, the first President of the Court, managed, however, to 
secure sufficient finances for the Court. The legal planning of the tribunal&rsquo;s 
works was entrusted to its first vice-president, David Nevius, already then a 
prominent lawyer and legal scholar.46
</p>
<p>The upper echelons of the judiciary in the conquered regions was rather 
thoroughly reformed, and the reform work was directed from Stockholm. Not 
only was the High Appellate Court founded in Wismar, but the Swedish crown 
also established new high courts in the provinces. The courts of the &ldquo;middle 
 instance&rdquo; &ndash; the appellate courts and the consistory for the ecclesiastical  affairs &ndash;  
became courts of the Swedish state. This says something of the Swedish in-
terest in making sure that at least the outcome of the most important cases 
could be followed all the way up to Wismar and even to Stockholm. The in-
fluence of estates persisted only at the lowest lever, at which the Swedish re-
form plans could not be carried out as the conquerors had planned. However, 
the estates could secure much judicial power at the lower courts, because the

<p>enfeoffments that the crown ceded to the nobility &ndash; especially during the reign 
of Queen Christina &ndash; often included a right to keep patrimonial courts as well 
(jus primae instantiae). The jurisdictions of these new courts, however, rarely 
coincided with the old jurisdictions. The town courts, then, usually became 
state-run (Alten-Stettin, Bremen, S&uuml;derstadt Verden) or were made part of the 
territorial judicial hierarchy.47
</p>
<p>Little research exists on the substantive legal norms that the courts followed 
in Pomerania, Bremen-Verden, and Wismar, but we can draw certain conclu-
sions based on the study of Kjell &Aring;ke Mod&eacute;er&rsquo;s study on the development of 
Swedish judiciary in the conquered German territories.48 A thorough Swedifi-
cation would have been unthinkable and unrealistic. The Swedes did not have 
enough legally qualified personnel to staff themselves all the new courts that 
they created on German soil. They barely had enough jurists for their own pur-
poses at home. It is therefore likely that the few Swedish judges that took posts 
in the Wismar court and elsewhere accommodated themselves to the legal en-
vironments of German gemeines Recht, without bringing their own influences 
to Germany. The ideology of an early modern conglomerate state did not, as 
discussed above, depart from the idea of automatically completely changing 
the laws of the conquered territories. It was already something to assume con-
trol of the judiciary and to design it hierarchically in such a manner that the 
highest courts &ndash; which the crown controlled &ndash; could sufficiently control the 
lower ones.
</p>
<p>This was not, however, enough for the Swedes. Disagreements between 
the Swedish crown and the Germans as to how closely the German territo-
ries should, as far as law was concerned, be integrated to the Swedish realm  
remained until the end of the Swedish rule. The questions concerning the high-
est judicial power were never brought to a consensus. The privilegium de ap-
pellando illimitatum still left open the question of whether the Swedish crown 
or its courts in Stockholm (for instance, the Svea High Court) might exercise 
judicial control over the Wismar tribunal. The Swedes initially thought so, but 
the German interpretation was such that no regular appeals to the Swedish 
courts were possible. As mentioned above, the extraordinary claims &ndash; such as 
the nullity claims &ndash; continued to go the highest courts of the empire. Another 
bone of contention were the disputes between the individual provincial gov-
ernments (Landesregierungen) and the estates of those provinces. These would 
have ordinarily have belonged to the jurisdiction of the Reichskammergericht 
and the Reichshofrat. As their substitute, the Wismar tribunal now claimed

</p>
<p>the exclusive jurisdiction on these cases. The Swedish crown was against this 
and organised a visitation of the Oberappellationsgericht in 1688. The visita-
tion commission ruled according to the crown&rsquo;s opinion, and the situation was 
only reversed in 1721, when the estates, taking advantage of Sweden&rsquo;s loss of 
the Great Northern War, managed to reverse the commission&rsquo;s ruling. The third 
major problem where differences as to the desired level of integration arose 
had to do with another extraordinary legal instrument, the so-called revision 
(beneficium revisionis). At the start of its rule in the German territories, the 
Swedish crown wanted the revisions to go to the Svea High Court, but the es-
tates of German provinces declined this. Instead, the estates thought that the 
visitation commission &ndash; with representatives from the estates themselves, the 
provincial governments, and the University of Greifswald &ndash; would be an ap-
propriate organ to handle revision petitions. The committee did in fact decide 
a few petitions in 1688, but since after that no other visitation was organised, 
the revision as a legal institution became meaningless in Sweden&rsquo;s German 
territories.49
</p>
<p>The Swedes drafted plans to reform some of the laws, but realised no whole-
sale reforms. The laws effectuating the court reforms were self-evident. In ad-
dition, a Government Ordinance (Regierungsordnung) for Bremen-Verden was 
passed in 1652, and drafts of Consistorial and Church Ordinances were also 
sent to Stockholm but never approved. In Wismar a new Church Ordinance 
was given in 1665, and the same ordinance came to be used in Bremen-Verden 
as well. In Pomerania a new Church Ordinance was given in 1672.50 Mainly 
church laws were thus reformed not the least because of their significance for 
overall governance of the territories.
</p>
<p>The judicial and source-of-law solutions, which the Swedes adopted in Ger-
many and Estonia, thus followed because of several interrelated factors. Many 
of them had already influenced, of course, the capitulation treaties that laid 
the legal base for the conquests. First, foreign policy affected all solutions taken 
in the conquered territories. The position of the local power elite was decisive 
in determining how law was shaped: old privileges had to be respected, and 
those had everything to do with the old law. Second, the legal cultural stand-
ing of the local legal elites and their contacts to the European legal world were 
crucial in determining which possibilities were realistic and tempting for the 
designers of the legal framework &ndash; as the collections of Brandis and Crusius 
show. Third, the social and political situation in the conquered lands unavoid-
ably influenced the legal development after the conquests. As we shall see, all

</p>
<p>of these factors played a role in the treaties and decisions taken in the case 
of Livonia as well, and these factors influenced the direction the legal history 
took in the seventeenth century regardless of the initial intentions and wishes 
of the conquerors.
</p>
<p>Integrating the law of German territories to the Swedish realm thus proved 
extremely difficult. The ties to the German imperial courts were severed after 
the Peace of Westphalia, but never broken completely. The Swedish attempts 
to establish corresponding routes of judicial controls from Wismar to Stock-
holm failed. The strong German legal culture was capable of creating a system 
which could effectively substitute the imperial courts and resist most efforts to 
control on the part of the Swedish overlord. This was a significant difference 
between the German and Baltic territories, although the difference was one 
only of degree. Also in Livonia, the Swedish crown encountered considerable 
difficulties when attempting to establish judicial control.
</p>
<p>3.3 Reforming the Livonian Judicial Structure
</p>
<p>3.3.1 The Social and Political Situation in the Beginning of  
the Swedish Epoch
</p>
<p>After the long, chaotic wars of the Polish era, the Livonian population began 
to increase in the peaceful conditions of the Swedish period. The manorial 
system was largely reorganised, and many manor houses were given to Swed-
ish noblemen as fiefs. The manorial production grew steadily in the 1630s and 
1640s. This has led the traditional German-Baltic historiography, and not with-
out reason, to emphasise how beneficial the Swedish era was &ndash; not only for the 
province in general, but for the peasants in particular:
</p>
<p>The beginning of the Swedish government marks the time when Livonia 
lay in complete ruin, economically [&hellip;] Only very slowly was the wellbe-
ing of the land raised, thanks to the victorious sceptre of the first Swed-
ish regents. Indeed, Livonia has much to be thankful for to Sweden, and 
especially to Gustav Adolf.51
</p>
<p>Yet another contemporary Swedish traveller-chronicler, apparently shocked 
by the contrast between the peasants&rsquo; living conditions in Sweden proper and 
Livonia, describes the life of the peasants in 1645&ndash;46 in much more sombre 
terms:

</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>The peasants along the road [from Riga to Estonia] find themselves in a 
very sad situation. They live in misery, have no clothes nor pelts to rest on 
in the night, as is customary elsewhere. They lie in their kilns, in smoke 
and soot, and it is, indeed, surprising that one can manage to live in such 
a room. There is a big oven in their hut that they light in the morning. The 
smoke has no exit other than through the door and a small hole through 
the wall.52
</p>
<p>Thus, to talk about an improvement in peasant conditions in these early years 
is unavoidably relative. In spite of the more or less chaotic situation that had 
lasted for decades, the Livonian legal culture, along with Estonia and much of 
central Europe, had been on its way to a lawyer-driven reception of ius com-
mune. Reception of Roman law had been advancing, and Livonian lawyers un-
doubtedly felt themselves to be part of the European learned legal community. 
Swedes, in turn, had been filtering the ius commune mass of legal material and 
adapting it in a simplified form for local use.
</p>
<p>The Livonian Diet (Landtag) remained the major organ of noble autonomy 
during the Swedish period. King Sigismund of Poland had already confirmed 
the nobility&rsquo;s right to the Diet in the Privileges of 1561. For the Livonian nobil-
ity, not being represented in the Swedish Diet and having instead a diet of its 
own was important, indicating that the province was not wholly incorporated 
into Sweden. The city of Riga was, as the only town, also represented at the 
Diet. The Livonian Diet enjoyed the right to propose internal taxes and pro-
vincial legislation directly to the king or to the governor. The Diet had been 
headed since 1634 by a land marshal (Landmarschall), elected for a three-year  
period by the governor. The land marshal served as the knighthood&rsquo;s liaison with  
the crown, and observed the proper running of judicial affairs.53 In 1643, the 
Swedes also created a Landratskollegium, a provincial college consisting of six 
(12 from 1648 onwards) Landr&auml;te or noble councillors, to act as a link vis-&agrave;-vis 
the local state administration and the governor-general (generalguvern&ouml;r). The 
original idea had been for the Landsratskollegium to act as counselling organ 
of the governor. However, the Landratskollegium&rsquo;s tasks were increasingly lim-
ited to the knighthood&rsquo;s internal affairs, as the governor acquired counsellors 
of his own (Assistenzr&auml;te). The authority of the Landratskollegium increased

as part of Carolingian absolutist reforms.54
</p>
<p>The Swedish crown also issued legislation specifically for Livonia, especially 
in the area of police law. The Governor-General Clas Tott had them codified in 
1668, and the King ratified the Policeyordnung in 1671.55
</p>
<p>The larger Livonian towns also got their privileges confirmed. This included 
the towns, which were seen as beneficial from the point of view of Swedish 
mercantilist economic policy, in other words those practicing foreign com-
merce with the rights of a Swedish stapelst&auml;der (ius emporii).56 The case of the 
Estonian nobility and the towns was the same, and the position of both the 
knighthoods and the urban corporations differed decisively from the position 
of the noblemen and towns in Ingria and the Kexholm County, the nobility and 
towns of which were represented at the Diet in Stockholm. As Tuchtenhagen 
explains, the relatively insignificant corporations of Ingria and the Kexholm 
County were easier to incorporate into the Swedish state and the Swedish legal 
order than the Livonian estates.57
</p>
<p>This was roughly the situation when the Swedes assumed control over the 
Livonian legal system in the 1630s and began to build a judicial system. The 
clearest difference between the situation in Livonia on one hand, and in Esto-
nia in the 1560s and the 1630s on the other is that whereas in the latter case, the 
Swedes could continue on the basis of the old judicial structure, in the former, 
fewer of the old structures existed that could be built upon. The town courts, 
as the example of the Dorpat court shows, had operated without major inter-
ference from the Polish powerholders and continued to do so under the Swed-
ish rule. We have no reliable information from the district courts, but the fact 
that the social infrastructure had been largely demolished in the countryside 
must certainly have had a bearing on the workings of both the district courts 
of the nobility as well as on the manorial courts in charge of peasant affairs. 
The Polish rulers had created the high court system from scratch in 1582 and

<p>reformed it again in 1600. Indeed, the Swedish conquerors had a lot to do, and 
the construction of the judicial system would take time. The situation called 
for an interim solution, which would take care of day-to-day court cases and, 
not least, sort out the pressing land disputes.
</p>
<p>3.3.2 Commissorial Courts
Early modern law had such a flexible solution: the commissorial court. In early 
modern terminology, the term &ldquo;commission&rdquo; could refer either to a committee- 
like organ put in charge of preparing legislation, or to a special court  
operating outside the regular court system. The latter type of commissions  
interest us here. For the sake of distinction I will call them commissorial 
courts.58 They could function on a relatively permanent basis or could be set up  
with a particular case or group of cases in mind. The use of commissorial courts  
is perhaps best known in the context of witchcraft trials,59 but in addition to 
criminal cases they were often used also in civil cases,60 and in the domain 
of what today would be classified as public law.61 Commissions could serve 
for many different ends: they sometimes took care of only investigating a case 
while leaving the decision to a regular court, and sometimes they also decided

<p>the case. Commissorial courts were often used in distant places, to which a 
high court would displace itself.62
</p>
<p>A commissorial court derived its power from the crown, as did all other 
courts of law.63 Commissioners or members of a commissiorial court were 
usually appointed by the monarch directly. All this was perfectly logical in the 
early modern legal and political thinking which knew no separation of powers. 
Commissorial courts were a general European phenomenon, and they were 
particularly plentiful in seventeenth-century France, and there were efficient 
tools in the hands of absolutist rulers.64 Commissions were common in Swe-
den as well: in 1680&ndash;1730 alone, more than 200 commissions were appointed.65
</p>
<p>Commissiorial courts were frequently used in Livonia as well, although a 
systematic study of their practice falls outside the scope of this work. Com-
missorial courts proved especially useful during the 1620s, during the decade 
when the new regular court system was not yet in place but cases nevertheless 
needed to be decided. After the capitulation of Riga in September 1621, a com-
mission was immediately established to sort out the landed property and to 
decide all property disputes in Livonia. Anyone claiming to own land in the 
lands conquered by the Swedes had to present the necessary documents to the 
commission in order to prove their ownership. The commission consisted of 
Governor Jesper Kruus (1577&ndash;1622), Vice-Governor Johan Derfelt (1561&ndash;1633), 
and representatives of the nobility and the towns.66
</p>
<p>The commissorial court at Riga soon acquired the position of a general court 
of law in Livonia. The old system of courts had most probably ceased to func-
tion, and King Gustav Adolf announced to the Livonian estates in 1622 that a 
new judicial system would be established as soon the province had been paci-
fied. The same year, the commissorial court received an official instruction, 
which clarified its position as a general court of law. The court was to receive 
all cases that his majesty remitted to it as well as all cases which private parties 
brought to it directly. The commissorial court was, however, not allowed to de-
cide cases pertaining to the Riga courts lest the town privileges be violated. The 
court hearings were to take place openly in the presence of the parties. Docu-
ments would be inspected, witnesses heard, and oaths taken. Without specific

<p>royal permission, the court could not arrest or sentence anyone to prison. The 
decisions of the commissorial court could be appealed to the Svea High Court 
in Stockholm.67
</p>
<p>3.3.3 The Lower Courts: The Landgerichte
After the truce of Altmark in 1629 had led to the annexation of Livonia to 
Sweden and the first Governor-General Johan Skytte (1629&ndash;1634) had been ap-
pointed, the reorganisation of judicial administration could truly begin with 
Skytte as its main architect. The combination of three statutes came to deter-
mine the jurisdiction of the Livonian lower courts and the high courts: the Dis-
trict Court Ordinance (Landgerichtsordinanz, lgo) of 1630 (&sect;8), the Improved 
District Court Ordinance (Verbesserte Landgerichtsordinanz, vlgo) of 1632 
(Art. 5&ndash;7), and the High Court Order (Hofgerichtsordnung, hgo) of 1632 (&sect;20).
</p>
<p>The first statute to regulate the judicial system, lgo, was thus issued in 1630, 
and later some further instructions for the individual courts were issued.68 The 
first level to be organised was that of the district courts (Landgerichte), the 
number of which was fixed at five in 1631. The division was kept in the vlgo, 
according to which the province was divided into five royal court districts, 
responsible for both criminal and civil cases in the first instance: Riga, Dor-
pat, Pernau, Wenden, and Kokenhausen. However, the court of Wenden never 
began to function, or functioned only for a few years, because it was too small 
to function as an independent unit after the private court of Chancellor Oxen-
stierna had assumed most of the legal business in the Bishopric of Wenden.69 
The four other courts functioned throughout the Swedish period.
</p>
<p>According to Art. 5 of the vlgo, &ldquo;each and every person, which in these 
lands were directly subject to the Royal Majesty, that is noble or not noble, ec-
clesiastical or secular, and also soldiers placed in castle camps&rdquo; belonged to the 
jurisdiction of the noble court.70 This seemed to include everyone. Art. 6 con-
tinued that all cases (criminalia und civilia) were included in the jurisdiction

69 The royal Wenden District Court was founded in 1634, but surviving records show that at 
</p>
<p>least by 1638 the court had ceased to function. See Meurling, Svensk domstolsf&ouml;rvaltning i 
Livland, 81&ndash;82.
</p>
<p>70 lgo 1632 Art. v: &ldquo;An diese Land-Gerichte geh&ouml;rne alle und jede Personen so in diesen 
Landen der K&ouml;nigl. Majest&auml;t immediate unterworffen, sie seyn Adel oder Unable, Geistlich- 
oder weltlichen Standes, auch im Burglager liegende Reuter und Soldaten.&rdquo; Buddenbrock ii,

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>of district courts, except for those belonging to the High Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction 
according to the Hofgerichtsordnung or &ldquo;the Swedish laws.&rdquo;71
</p>
<p>The division of jurisdictions between the district courts and the High Court 
was thus quite clear &ndash; and almost identical to that in Sweden proper. However, 
as we will see when observing the court practice, the law in action did not ex-
actly correspond to the law in the books. In practice, lower courts dealt primar-
ily with the cases of noblemen.
</p>
<p>Every district court was to have a judge and two assessors. All judicial  
offices &ndash; with the exception of Georg Stiernhielm (1598&ndash;1672), an experienced 
Swedish lawyer &ndash; went to the former commissorial courts members.72 The 
Landgerichtsordinanz also provided for a notary, but since the notaries were 
not paid, they did not figure in the early years. In 1639, two district court judges 
suggested that offices of notaries be set up in the courts; however, the answer 
was that should an assessor not wish to keep protocol himself, he could always 
hire a notary with his own funds. As a result, assessors usually also acted as 
notaries.73
</p>
<p>The main administrative language and the official court language remained 
German, which was only logical, since all the legal tradition of the preceding 
Polish and Ordenstaat period was in German, and the Livonian privileges en-
tailed the right to be ruled by them. The nobility and the learned stratum of 
Livonian society continued in the hands of the German-speaking nobility, al-
though some Swedish officials were recruited as well. The fact that the laws 
intended for use in Livonia only were given in German speaks for itself, and 
that the language relations changed little during the seventeenth century is 
evident from the fact that the Swedish Law of the Realm was translated into 
German in 1695. We shall later return to consider what this tells us regarding 
the theory of legal sources.
</p>
<p>The Swedish reorganisers of the Livonian judiciary thus did not, as far as ju-
dicial culture was concerned, start off with a clean slate, although Livonia had 
stumbled more or less into chaos in the last years before the final ousting of the 
Poles. Whatever the Swedes did, they had to respect the privileges affirmed in 
the capitulation treaties.
</p>
<p>The Swedish h&auml;radsr&auml;tter, by the time of the Livonian conquest, had been 
incorporated as part of a court hierarchy in the Roman-canon meaning of the

<p>71 lgo 1632 Art. vi: &ldquo;Imgleichen geh&ouml;ren zu diesem Gerichte, alle und jede Sachen, crimina-
lia und civilia, die allein ausgenommen, so in der Hofgerichtsordnung excipiret und nach

<p>word.74 Because of the lack of court records, it is difficult to say whether such 
a hierarchy existed in Livonia before the founding of the appeals court at Dor-
pat, during the Ordenstaat or in the Polish period. The fact that cases were 
appealed to the Reichskammergericht and Reichshofrat in the Ordenzeit does 
not alone prove that the whole court system would have turned modern in the 
Roman-canon sense. Nor can it be automatically concluded from the fact that 
the Polish established upper courts of their own. The presence of professional 
lawyers in some Livonian courts already in the first years of Swedish rule nev-
ertheless points a conclusion that a Romanization of the judicial system had 
begun at least during the Polish period. Hilchen&rsquo;s Draft Law points to the same 
conclusion. Both of these phenomena suggest a context of Roman law.

<p>3.3.4 The Patrimonial Courts: Pernau and Wenden
In addition to the four royal courts, there were also two private courts, one in 
Pernau and another one in Wenden. These are not to be confused with the 
royal courts of Pernau and Wenden. The two patrimonial courts represented

<p>74 The Swedish court hierarchy was not fully developed in the 1630s and 1640s. The lack 
of clarity, however, had mainly to do with position of the royal jurisdiction vis-&agrave;-vis the 
high courts. See, for instance, Sture Petr&eacute;n, &ldquo;Hovr&auml;ttens uppbyggnad 1614&ndash;1654,&rdquo; in Sture 
Petr&eacute;n, Stig J&auml;gerski&ouml;ld and Tord O:son Nordberg, Svea hovr&auml;tt: studier till 350&ndash;&aring;rsminnet 
(Stockholm: Norstedt, 1964), 3&ndash;117; and Korpiola, &ldquo;A Safe Haven in the Shadow of War.&rdquo; To 
appreciate the distinction between the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; appeal and the medieval high courts, 
we need to see how the emergence of the appeal has been explained in European legal 
history. Bernhard Diestelkamp distinguishes between Rechtszug and the actual appeal. 
The medieval Rechtszug is closely associated to the idea of Dinggenossenschaft, emerg-
ing from the writings of Max Weber and later developed by J&uuml;rgen Weitzel. In the medi-
eval court, the judge did not participate in the decision-making. He only represented the 
Herrschaftsgewalt, making sure that the proceedings did not deviate from the ordinary 
course. A decision was taken by the populace gathered at the court or their representa-
tives, the law-finders (Urteilsfinder, Sch&ouml;ffen). Similar principles of legal decision-making 
ruled in courts at all judicial levels, from the humblest manorial courts to the royal coun-
cil. If the court was unable to arrive at a consensual decision, an Oberhof or other authori-
tative organ could be asked for a &ldquo;second opinion&rdquo; in the Rechtszug procedure. The final 
decision was given nevertheless in the name of the first court. The appellatio, in turn, 
was directed against the decision of a lower court, the appellate decision replacing the 
first-instance decision. In the German legal sphere, the appeal in this sense emerged dur-
ing the second half of the fifteenth century. See Bernhard Diestelkamp, Die Durchsetzung 
des Rechtsmittels der Appellation im weltlichen Prozessrecht Deutschland (Stuttgart: Franz 
Steiner, 1998), 7&ndash;9.</p>

proper included.75
</p>
<p>The maintenance and income from the private courts belonged to the privi-
leges of the landlords, Pernau to those of the counts of Thurn, and Wenden to 
Count Axel Oxenstierna.76 In Wenden, Oxenstierna had held court de facto in 
1625, receiving the formal privilege only in 1632. The county of Pernau was en-
feoffed to Count Frans Bernhard von Thurn (1595&ndash;1628), who in 1627 received 
jurisdiction over all the subjects of the crown.77 When he died in 1628, the 
Count&rsquo;s widow Magdalena von Thurn (ca. 1600&ndash;1651) began administering his 
goods &ndash; the court included &ndash; in the name of their underage son.78
</p>
<p>Whether the allodial goods of free noblemen were included under the comi-
tal jurisdiction remained a bone of contention practically until the dissolution 
of the patrimonial courts in 1681. The negative attitude of the Livonian Order 
towards such inclusion persisted particularly clearly.79 According to Meurling, 
Oxenstierna was not interested at first in including noblemen in his jurisdic-
tion. His attitude changed, however, and according to Liljedahl the royal letter 
of privilege seems to have extended his jurisdiction to everyone living within 
his enfeoffment.80 The interpretation is supported by the fact that by 1638 the 
royal District Court of Wenden &ndash; previously in charge of those areas in the 
Wenden Kreis not belonging to Oxenstierna&rsquo;s court &ndash; is no longer mentioned 
in the accounts of the Baltic provinces,81 suggesting that the royal court had 
fallen out of business. Whether the cases of noblemen now belonged to Ox-
enstierna&rsquo;s court or to the surrounding royal courts is not quite clear, and no 
court records survive. De facto, the latter was probably the case at least until

<p>1640, when a royal resolution ordered that the cases arising from the lands of 
the free noblemen should not be taken to the private court of the count. Be-
sides, it was ordered that in order to be executed, the decisions of the private 
court would have to be sent to the High Court of Dorpat for approval. In 1649 
the royal resolution of King Gustav Adolf was reversed, and it was now ordered 
by Queen Christina that all the cases from the noble lands situated within the 
country would also belong to the count&rsquo;s jurisdiction. This was in line with the 
royal policy to seek support from the high nobility for a strong central power. 
In Oxenstierna&rsquo;s lands the situation had been the same de facto, even without 
a specific statute regulating the matter. Such a statute was finally given in 1655, 
regarding the private court in Wenden as well.82
</p>
<p>The founding of the court in the region surrounding the town of Pernau was 
not simple, for the Countess Magdalena Thurn bitterly opposed the founding 
of a royal court on her lands. Governor-General Johan Skytte even issued a res-
olution prohibiting the Countess from complicating the founding of the new 
royal district court. A resolution of 1633 and the one of 1640 (mentioned above) 
had it that the free allodial goods of noblemen were excluded from the comital 
court&rsquo;s jurisdiction, and thus pertained to that of the royal court.83 The comital 
court proved unreliable when its responsibility of sending its minutes to the 
Dorpat High Court for inspection was concerned. If the minutes nevertheless 
arrived at the High Court, it was more &ldquo;ad illusionem, als ad leuterationem,&rdquo; as 
the Court&rsquo;s President formulated it.84 In 1644 the High Court even summoned 
the Countess and her judges to respond to the charges according to which the 
comital court had executed sentences without sending them to the High Court 
for approval. The Countess, however, appealed to the king and managed to 
have the summons annulled.85
</p>
<p>The minutes of the Comital District Court from 1632 speak for the rebellious 
attitude of the Countess. In the protocols, the court is not invariably called 
a district court, but instead Gr&auml;ffliches Pernouwsches Obergericht, Gr&auml;ffliches 
Thurnisches Obergericht, Gr&auml;ffliches Landgericht, or Gr&auml;ffliches Schlosgericht.86 
Different names are sometimes used even in the same legal case.

<p>The protocols of the criminal cases handled by the Comital Court of Pernau 
have been preserved in their entirety for 1632&ndash;41.87 The case load was light, 
because the Court only decided cases of serious criminality. The numbers 
of cases per year were as follows: 1632/2, 1633/1, 1634/0, 1635/1, 1636/4, 1637/1, 
1638/0, 1639/1, 1640/0, and 1641/1. Of these 11 cases four were homicide cases, 
four witchcraft cases, two thefts, and one fornication.88
</p>
<p>After the Thurn family became extinct in 1661, the county was enfeoffed to 
the Chancellor of the Realm (rikskansler) Magnus de la Gardie. The Pernau en-
feoffment was now included in the jurisdiction of the comital court covering 
all of de la Gardie&rsquo;s Baltic possessions. In 1681, as part of the Great Reduction, 
the enfeoffments of both de la Gardie and Oxenstierna returned to the state. 
This meant that the two private district courts ceased to exist, and their juris-
dictions were taken over by the royal courts.89
</p>
<p>3.3.5 Dealing with Peasants and Manorial Courts
An additional factor needed consideration on the part of Swedish reformers: 
the tradition of law-finders and the manorial courts. Since the Middle Ages in 
most parts of Europe, manor houses were not only units of agricultural pro-
duction, but they took also part in the legal and general administration. In the 
early modern age, the general European trend was towards the state taking in-
creasing responsibility for these tasks. The centralization was, however, often 
far from thorough, and in some regions manorial units were left with consider-
able judicial and administrative functions. Livonia was one of those regions.90
</p>
<p>The Swedes themselves, as was seen above, were used to the idea of un-
learned peasants taking part in the legal decision-making. In Sweden itself, the 
traditional peasant participation had, by the time Swedes took over Livonia, 
been transformed rather smoothly into a part of the royal judiciary. Peasant 
jurors, as part of the local district courts, together with the crown-appointed 
judge (or his substitute), decided all legal cases. The so-called blood cases were, 
according to the law, investigated in district courts; however, an appeals court 
was always the final decision in these cases.
</p>
<p>In the Ordenszeit the Livonia manorial lords, as vassals of the landlord (the 
Bishop or the Master of the Teutonic Order), were enffeofed the right to hold 
court for their subjects. Manorial courts normally heard both civil and criminal 
</p>
<p>87 Whether the Comital Court decided civil cases as well, is not known, but it is probable.

</p>
<p>cases. As the latter were concerned, the manorial courts thus exercised the 
lord&rsquo;s Halsgerichtsbarkeit, literally, the right to sentence to blood punishments.
</p>
<p>The lord himself or his steward acted as the judge and three or four of the 
most respected of the peasants as law-finders.91 Manorial courts normally had 
three noble assessors who observed that the court acted legally in criminal 
cases. According to David Hilchen&rsquo;s proposal for land law (1599), their presence 
was necessary always when &ldquo;there arose between a nobleman and his peasant 
a case, in which it had to be decided over blood [&hellip;] as had been customary 
since olden times [&hellip;].&rdquo;92 If the assessors found the law-finders&rsquo; sentence to be 
too harsh or too mild, they could alter the sentence.93 The Privilege of Sigis-
mund Augustus confirmed the manorial lords&rsquo; full judicial authority in both 
civil and criminal cases vis-&agrave;-vis the peasants living on their lands.
</p>
<p>In Livonia, the judicial position of the peasantry was limited to the mano-
rial courts where they took part in deciding the legal cases arising from the 
manorial life. The practical difference between the lowest judicial stratum in 
Sweden proper and Livonia was huge: Livonian peasant courts were clearly 
manorial courts, and they had no say in criminal affairs, strictly speaking, or 
those of the nobility. The Swedes basically had a choice between two ways of 
dealing with these ancient judicial organs. They could either assimilate them 
into the new judicial system, or they could let them continue in their functions 
and let them remain as islets of independent judicial decision-making con-
trolled by the manorial lords only. It seems, however, that no clear-cut decision 
was immediately taken.
</p>
<p>Peasant history, manorial courts included, has traditionally been a touchy 
subject in the Baltic countries. Transehe-Roseneck&rsquo;s overwhelmingly positive 
conception of the Swedish period started to be reassessed long ago. In the 
1930s, Johan Vasar criticised the one-sided Protestant orientation, which had 
led the German-Baltic historiography to glorify the Swedish period and, conse-
quently, to downplay the Polish era. The research had concentrated excessively 
on the nobility and forgotten the history of the peasantry.94 If the Swedish pe-
riod could be called at all &ldquo;the good old Swedish time,&rdquo; it was not because the

<p>Swedes would have done much to better the lives of their Baltic subjects, but 
because the ensuing Russian period proved to be even worse.95
</p>
<p>In the newer historiography, Vasar&rsquo;s points, undoubtedly enhanced by the 
first Estonian independence period on the one hand and the general con-
temporary tendency towards histories of the suppressed on the other, have 
been taken seriously, and the emphasis has shifted from the nobility to power 
politics, culture, and social history. Juhan Kahk, J&uuml;rgen Heyde, and Christoph 
Schmidt have shown that the peasant obligations (Fron- und Abgabepflichten) 
increased until the middle of the seventeenth century, and the peasants be-
came more dependent on the manorial lords than they had been before the 
Swedes. In fact, no serious attempt at the betterment of peasants&rsquo; lives was 
undertaken during King Gustav Adolf &rsquo;s time/regency, the most praised of the 
Swedish regents.96
</p>
<p>The Landgerichtsordinanz of 1630, however, changed the competence of the 
manorial lords. The Halsgerichtsbarkeit was taken away from them; from now 
on, the manorial lords were only allowed a right to apply disciplinary justice 
(Hauszucht). According to the Verbesserte Landgerichtsordinanz of 1632, the 
manorial discipline had to be used with &ldquo;Christian modesty&rdquo; (christliche Bes-
cheidenheit). The judicial power of the nobility was severely curtailed.97 Ever 
since the 1560s, the Swedish rulers had regularly attempted to limit the strict 
discipline on the Baltic manor houses. However, as more and more Swedish 
noblemen themselves came into possession of manor houses in the region, the 
attempts gradually wore off.98 At the end of the Swedish period, after the Great 
Reductions, the house discipline became an issue again. The Economy Regula-
tion of 1696 now came to include rules which, at least on paper, regulated the

</p>
<p>use of discipline on crown estates. An almost identical plan emerged to regu-
late discipline on private estates, but the proposal did not lead to legislation.99
</p>
<p>Whereas manorial justice adjudicated by the manorial courts dealt with the 
legal relations between the peasants, the disciplinary justice is associated with 
the peasants&rsquo; responsibilities towards the manor house. An ethical and reli-
gious aspect was also involved: it was the lord&rsquo;s right and duty to make sure that 
his peasants behaved in an orderly way, and sometimes disciplinary measures 
were needed to ensure this.100 According to Oxenstierna&rsquo;s Court Instruction, 
disciplinary measures were taken because of &ldquo;lazy work, disobedience [and] 
not returning to lawful [behaviour].&rdquo;101
</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century Baltic legal history, oriented in the spirit of the Histori-
cal School and legal positivism, was not yet concerned about social and cultur-
al history, or the history of the powerless. The nineteenth century Baltic legal 
history, dominated by Friedrich Georg von Bunge, was not much interested in 
evaluating the preceding periods normatively. Transehe-Roseneck, however, 
thought that the Swedish period definitely changed this for the better. Legal 
historiography followed suit with the general trend of historical science. In 
Estonia during the first independence this meant that a nationalist orienta-
tion combined with a trend away from the Rankean historiography led some 
legal historians to delve into the legal history of the peasants (Perandi, Uluots). 
The newest research again generally states that the legal position of the peas-
ants, by and large, changed for the better in the Swedish period. The peasantry 
regularly raised cases against the noble landlords in the Dorpat High Court, 
as the nobility raised peasant deliveries. The mere existence of such a right, 
confirmed in the Landgerichtsordinanz of 1632 (Art. ix), shows that a major 
change in the power structure of the Livonian society had occurred with the 
coming of the Swedes.102
</p>
<p>The new orientation of the interwar period did not leave the history of the 
peasant untouched. Adolf Perandi, in an important article on the manorial 
courts, claimed that the Swedish Landgerichtsordinanzen of 1630 and 1632 had 
in fact amounted to a virtual destruction of the judicial participation of the 
peasants.103 Perandi departed from the supposition that the manorial lords 
had never held full judicial power in their lands. The peasantry had decided its

</p>
<p>internal legal problems in the manorial courts and in practice without much 
interference from the part of the manorial lord. Perandi interprets the sources 
so that it was the responsibility of the peasantry to hold court on the manor. In 
the peasant court, the lord of manor had no say in any of the cases; in criminal 
cases, however, three noble by-sitters took part in the proceedings.104 Thus, 
whatever judicial power seems to have been taken away from the lords was 
mainly taken away from the peasants who now had no say in the new coun-
try courts. According to Soom, the judicial power in manorial courts was now 
transferred to the lord or his steward.105
</p>
<p>The claim that the manorial lords had no say in the workings of manorial 
courts seems, nevertheless, exaggerated. The Privilege of Sigismund had ex-
pressly allowed the nobility a jurisdiction on their manors, and the privilege 
was not meant to alter the existing state of affairs. Thus, if the lords in practice 
did not usually get much involved with the courts on their lands, which is very 
possible in most cases, that is altogether another matter. It does not mean that 
they could not, should they have felt the need to influence the court directly 
or indirectly by way of their stewards or reeves in individual cases. It is be-
yond doubt that the manorial lords were deprived of their right to issue death 
sentences, of their Halsgerichtsbarkeit. This right was transferred to the lower 
courts and the Dorpat High Court, which administered blood sentences jointly 
and in the same way that was done in Sweden.
</p>
<p>The lgo of 1630 can indeed be read as having ended the system of mano-
rial courts. The wording of the statute suggests that all peasant cases were to 
be taken to the general district courts instead of being tried at their home 
manors. The statute does not mention manorial courts, nor does the vlgo 
of 1632. It allowed the manorial lords only house discipline (&ldquo;eine disziplin&auml;re 
Hauszucht&rdquo;), which was to be exercised with &ldquo;Christian modesty&rdquo; (&ldquo;mit christ-
licher Bescheidenheit&rdquo;).106 Yet, at the beginning of the Swedish period, legal 
administration was uncertain as to what attitude should be adopted to the 
institutions of manorial courts and the Rechtsfinder. Law-finders had been a 
dying breed in the European legal world since the appearance of the profes-
sional lawyer in the high Middle Ages. They had been gradually replaced by

<p>university-trained legal professionals first in southern parts of Europe in the 
Middle Ages and then in Germany from the late fifteenth-century onwards.107 
Instead of laymen, best capable of applying customary law and transmit-
ting it to new generations, legal professionals were now needed to master 
the European ius commune and the increasing masses of statutory law.108 As 
I have suggested elsewhere,109 however, the institution survived the Swedish 
restructuring of the judiciary in Livonia. Swedes, although they pushed the 
law-finders out of the state courts, did not completely demolish the institu-
tion. Instead, the law-finders continued not only as members of the manorial 
courts but sometimes as experts in customary law and local usages in the lower 
courts as well. The law-finders, just like jurors or n&auml;mndem&auml;n, were often able 
to inform the judges (most often not conversant in vernacular languages either 
in Livonia or Sweden) of the local rumours and the reputation of the people. 
They certainly had the fame of knowing the law a little better than the regular 
peasants.
</p>
<p>I will take a few examples of the different solutions taken to deal with the 
problem of manorial courts, peasants&rsquo; legal cases, and law-finders. As Soom 
point outs, the few available sources do not give a uniform picture of the ma-
norial courts after the Swedish reforms.110 It is understandable that, since the 
whole practice was now against the written law, or at least left unregulated, 
different solutions were invented for different manor houses.
</p>
<p>A few instructions for the manorial courts exist. Jacob de la Gardie&rsquo;s archives 
offer interesting insights into the operation of the court on his manors of Fell-
in, Hemlin, and Tarvast. In 1640, the steward of Fellin, Helmet, and Tarvest, von 
Husen, received a memorandum from the count, giving instructions on various 
things. The memorandum is partly in accordance with the lgo. It says that the 
border disputes should be referred directly to the district court (&ldquo;Landrichter&rdquo;), 
and so also cases of severe crime (&ldquo;murder, adultery, witchcraft, and other such 
criminalia&rdquo;). However, the king had given the count all of the rights (&ldquo;Regalia 
und Hoheheit&rdquo;) that he himself would enjoy over such regions. This gave the 
count the right to judge all cases of petty crimes and civil cases. A &ldquo;jury of two

and decide these cases (&ldquo;som togo saken i &ouml;gonsigte och f&auml;llde dom&rdquo;). Without 
doubt, the &ldquo;jury&rdquo; here refers to the law-finders. If the parties were not satisfied 
with the result, the case could be taken to the Count himself to decide, as a 
kind of an appeals instance. However, should one of de la Gardies  &ldquo;fief-holders, 
burghers, or peasants&rdquo; (&ldquo;n&aring;gon af [de la Gardies] L&auml;nnleuten, B&uuml;rgern oder Pau-
ren&rdquo;) appeal a case to the district court, they would lose they land (&ldquo;l&auml;n och 
land&rdquo;).111 Appeals from the manorial court to the district courts were thus effec-
tively forbidden, which explains why practically no peasants or burghers ap-
pear as parties in the district courts. Although the memorandum was directed 
only to de la Gardie&rsquo;s steward, it is probable that judicial matters were arranged 
similarly elsewhere as well.
</p>
<p>Axel Oxenstierna&rsquo;s Judicial Order (Gerichtsordnung) of 1649 accords land 
disputes and small fights between peasants to the steward&rsquo;s judicial compe-
tence. The steward could only apply moderate physical punishments (&ldquo;mit-
telm&auml;ssiger Correction&rdquo;) on the peasants, and he was to send all of the more 
serious cases to the district court.112 Count Claes Tott issued an instruction in 
1649, according to which his stewards should adjudicate disputes concerning 
fields and hay meadows, the responsibility of setting up fences and damage to 
growing grain caused by animals. All other civil and criminal cases belonged to 
the senior steward&rsquo;s (Oberverwalter) competence.113
</p>
<p>In addition to manorial instructions, provincial regulations on manorial 
courts were given as well. Law-finders and manorial courts were already men-
tioned in Tott&rsquo;s Landespolizeiverordnung of 1671, Article ix of which is about 
peasant weddings. Law-finders are expressly mentioned in the context of the 
maximum number of guests allowed.114
</p>
<p>In the Economy Regulation (&Ouml;konomie Reglement; Ch. 5, &sect;2) of 1696 it stated 
that when a peasant&rsquo;s crime could lead to a punishment or damages to be paid, 
the lord of the crown manor could not convict him, but instead had to delegate 
the case to &ldquo;law-finders and objective peasants to be investigated and deter-
mined.&rdquo; If the punishment did not exceed 10 pairs of whips or the damages 20 
Reichstaler, then it could be administered immediately, as long as the plaintiff 
agreed. If the maximum amount of whips or damages was exceeded, or the

to be taken to a district court.115
</p>
<p>Court records offer additional support for the thesis of manorial courts 
surviving through the Swedish time, although not much, because in manorial 
court sessions records were usually not kept. On the island of Oesel, the local 
governor &ndash; not the stewards &ndash; is known to have held court for peasants on the 
estates.116 In the 1950s, Arhold Soom found fragments from a session held by 
a senior steward (Oberverwalter) for Jacob de la Gardie&rsquo;s manor houses on the 
island of Hiiumaa (Dag&ouml;), probably in the 1640s. The protocol consists of four 
cases. One of them seems a typical case of a land dispute, which had led to a 
physical fight. The defendant was condemned to a fine. In the second case, the 
plaintiff was the renter (Besitzerin) of one of de la Gardie&rsquo;s manors, Lauka. She 
accused two peasants of stealing an anchor from her boat. The senior steward 
managed, however, to settle the case. The third case involved a senior peasant 
(Kubias) accusing another peasant of libel. After hearing witnesses, the court 
ordered the defendant to apologize to the Kubias and to suffer a punishment of 
10 pairs of lashes, instead of which he could choose to pay fines. In the fourth 
case, two peasant brothers accused a third man of conducting an affair with 
their mother. Because the accusation was so serious, adultery in fact, the de-
fendant was taken into custody and the case was remitted to the ecclesiastic 
authorities.117 Although the fragment consists of only four cases, they are in-
formative. The cases reveal the way the (upper) manorial court functioned in 
much the same way as a regular district court: witnesses were heard, and both 
corporal and monetary punishments were given. The court actively strove for 
settlements. A case pertained to the jurisdiction of a manorial court if at least 
one of parties was a peasant. De la Gardie&rsquo;s archives also contain fragments of 
notes kept by a scribe at a manorial court. The notes, apparently from the year 
1649, pertain to a complaint that De la Gardie&rsquo;s peasants had filed against his

</p>
<p>The proceedings of the Dorpat District Court in the summer of 1632 com-
bined old and new elements in yet another interesting way. The fact that law-
finders were not mentioned in the district court ordinances quite apparently 
did not, to contemporary lawyers, mean that law-finders were abolished. After 
all, law-finders had not been mentioned in written legislation before either. It 
must therefore have seemed a perfectly possible alternative to deal with the 
peasant representation the way the Dorpat District Court did. In the first ses-
sions it held after the reorganisation of the Livonian judiciary, the Dorpat Dis-
trict Court thought it best to incorporate the law-finders in the workings of the 
court. This solution may largely be explained by the composition of the court, 
which was interesting. Georg Stiernhielm, &ldquo;the father of Swedish poetry,&rdquo; pre-
sided over the court, with two German Baltic jurists, Hermann Liebstorff and 
Andreas Schilling, as assessors.119
</p>
<p>Was Stiernhielm &ndash; or were Liebstorff and Schilling &ndash; a jurist? The concept 
of a jurist is ambiguous in a time when formal degrees were not necessary to 
hold any posts that in today&rsquo;s world require a complete university degree. This 
holds especially true for Sweden, where people with completed degrees were 
few and far between: advocates, judges, and law professors could well be with-
out law degrees.120 Yet some of them were distinguished as &ldquo;learned lawyers&rdquo; 
based on the fact that they had taken at least some university studies in law. 
We know that Stiernhielm had studied Aristotelian philosophy and political 
science in Wittemberg and Greifswald, but whether he also followed lectures 
in law remains obscure.121 However, his work at both the District Court and the

judge (asessor) to the High Court of Dorpat in 1630, in addition to which he sat at court, 
at least occasionally, in the District Court of Dorpat. Stiernhielm was appointed Vice 
President of the High Court in 1648 and stayed until the Russian invasion in 1656. Of these 
years, however, he spent several in Stockholm, first as member of the Law Commission 
and then as Archivist of the Realm.</p>

</p>
<p>High Court shows, as we will see, that Stiernhielm most probably had taken up 
some serious law studies while in Germany.
</p>
<p>For Stiernhielm, it must have seemed perfectly natural to do more or less 
what was done in Sweden with peasants in courts. Swedish law recognized 
the peasant panels (the n&auml;mnd), and they had a prominent role in the pro-
cedures alongside the judge. The Livonian District Court Ordinance of 1632 
did not allow the law-finders a comparable role. However, since the law did 
not expressly abolish the institution, Stiernhielm did his best to accommodate 
the peasant law experts into the system. Thus, a panel (sometimes even called 
Nembd, after the Swedish equivalent) was composed of the law-finders. The 
analogy, however, could not be complete because of the Livonian legislation, 
which, unlike the Swedish laws, provided for three judges, and not just one 
which was the case in Sweden.
</p>
<p>Not only were law-finders incorporated; in one case, the protocol also re-
veals that by-sitters (Beisitzer) continued to be involved. It states: &ldquo;Nicolaus 
Langenborg, who has been sworn in as by-sitter, is now asked for help. Her-
man Schrowe is also ordered to act as by-sitter and sworn in.&rdquo;122 The by-sitters, 
an indigenous Livonian legal institution not known in Germany, were already 
known in the Law of Waldemar and Eric. Their function was act as witnesses to 
the whole court procedure. Interestingly, their number in that record was two, 
which speaks for continuity.123
</p>
<p>From 4 July until 12 August 1632 the court held sessions in fourteen of the 
most important manor houses in its district. If law-finders were wanted in the 
sessions, it was absolutely necessary for the court to go to where they were, not 
vice versa. After all, the law-finders as serfs were glebae adscriptae, tied to the 
turf, and not allowed to leave the premises of their lords freely. Another practi-
cal reason for the travelling district court had to do with parties: were the court 
to replace the old manorial courts and handle the cases which had previously 
belonged in their jurisdiction, it had to hold its sessions at the manors in which 
the parties to the law suits were.
</p>
<p>The manors visited included Timov, Karrifer, Ellistfer, Lay&szlig;, Engefer, Raf-
welecht, Dumpianshoff, Sagnitz, Ultzen, Marienburg, Nihusen, Rappin, Aye, 
and Rallishoff. For nine of the manor houses, the protocol mentions that law-
finders, usually six of them, were chosen using more or less the same formula, 
</p>
<p>122 &ldquo;Nicholaus Langenborg, welcher hiebevoor zum Beysitzer beeydigt, ist f&uuml;r di&szlig;mahll f&uuml;r

und beeydigt worden.&rdquo; Dorpater Landgericht [District Court of Dorpat, from here onwards:

<p>for instance &ldquo;as law-finders chosen and sworn in&rdquo; (&ldquo;zu Rechtfinder erwehlet und 
beeydiget&rdquo;) or &ldquo;as law-finders are ordered and sworn in&rdquo; (&ldquo;zu Rechtfinder seindt 
verordnet und beeydiget&rdquo;). Why law-finders were not elected at every manor is 
difficult to say. It may be that where new law-finders were not chosen, it was 
because the law-finders that had been chosen for previous sessions were still 
available to serve in court. It is possible that the law-finder positions were con-
sidered hereditary to an extent. At least in one case the son of an old and sick 
law-finder was chosen to serve instead of the father.124
</p>
<p>The law-finders were all peasants,125 and most probably some of the most 
respected members of the community to ensure the enforceability of court 
decisions, which at least before the Swedish procedural reforms had been con-
sensual at the manorial courts. In most of the groups of law-finders there were 
at least one or two Kubias, peasants who served as foremen for their peers at 
the manor.
</p>
<p>The local knowledge of Rechtsfinder was frequently used, as might be ex-
pected, and the court asked for their opinion at several occasions. In a witch-
craft case against a peasant called Pudell, it was recorded that &ldquo;the Kubias 
[stated] that Pudell [&hellip;] had been tortured, which the accused confesses, and 
the same is confirmed by J. Nicholaus Langenborg [a by-sitter], and the law-
finders all witness that the accused had a bad reputation.&rdquo;126 The law-finders 
(and the by-sitter, who was also elected at this session) were thus asked what 
they thought of the accused&rsquo;s reputation. This was relevant, because Pudell 
had been tortured. Some evidence was necessary, according to the contem-
porary legal doctrine, for judicial torture to be lawful. Normally, of course, the 
necessary evidence would have needed to be there before the torture. These, 
however, were not normal circumstances. As we shall see, the courts would 
later subject the torture cases, with the necessary evidence, for the appeals 
court to decide.

<p>himself sentenced to a fine of two roubles, or, in the case of insolvency, to be 
whipped. But how many whips equalled to a fine of two roubles in the region: 
&ldquo;The law-finders were asked what the custom out here in the country was, how 
many strikes equalled to one rouble? A[nswer]. One pair of whips, and with 
each pair &ndash; three strikes. Who strikes with the whips? A[nswer]. The house- or 
court soldier. Whereby two law-finders make sure that the punishment is right-
ly administered.&rdquo;127 The interesting information that the law-finders&rsquo; answers 
yields is that they also acted as overseers of the punishment. There is another 
interesting detail here. The case description begins by stating that &ldquo;the oldest 
peasants of the region had issued a sentence, according to which he [Kurbitz 
Jack] should not act against it, at the risk of being fined two roubles.&rdquo;128 I would 
interpret this as part of the transitional phase: Kurbitz Jack probably thought 
that he could now &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; the old, unfavourable from his point of view, mano-
rial court decision to the new district court.
</p>
<p>The Dorpat summer court of 1632 was in many ways a true peasant court. 
Not only did peasants act as law-finders; they were also active as plaintiffs and 
were drawn into the court to be accused of crimes and as witnesses. Peasants 
were accused of crimes (Halsgerichtssachen) such as theft, sodomy, fornica-
tion, witchcraft, and infanticide. They acted as both plaintiffs and accused in 
accusatorial cases, such as iniuria, and they appeared as both plaintiffs and de-
fendants in all kinds of civil cases (such as disputes over hay fields and horses, 
damages, and debt claims) and complaining about the misbehaviour of mano-
rial stewards. Most of the cases were typical of everyday manorial life. On 7 July 
1632, a dispute between Hans Meckene&euml;r and Ju&szlig; Hans was decided at the Lais 
manor. The dispute had to do with a mutilated horse (in puncto equi mutilate) 
and is worth citing at length:
</p>
<p>It is decided. Because the accused himself confesses that he has hit the 
plaintiff &rsquo;s horse twice on the back with a stock [&hellip;] And all the same he 
has rendered the plaintiff &rsquo;s horse incapable of work, so shall the accused, 
according to Chapter 33 in Book 6 of the Swedish law, take the horse to 
heal it and give the plaintiff a useful horse for work, so that when the 
horse is again healed, the plaintiff shall take his horse back and return the

</p>
<p>Some of the cases were between noblemen only, but they were a minority, 
dealing with border disputes, libel cases, or the ownership of peasants.130 The 
picture that the summer protocols remit is that the Dorpat District Court had 
taken the role of the former manorial courts, albeit mixing those functions 
with those of a Swedish-type lower court. The Dorpat District Court, in the 
summer of 1632, was indeed a court for the peasants and by the peasants, 
with the exception that professional judges representing the Swedish crown 
led the proceedings. The presence of noble judges made it also possible for 
the court to handle the few cases involving nobility that were presented to it. 
The procedures are &ldquo;manorial&rdquo; also in the sense that there are no legal profes-
sionals involved, except for the judges. Instead, the peasants plead their cases 
themselves, and the proceedings are completely informal and oral (although 
protocolled) &ndash; much like in Swedish district courts. To reach its customers and 
witnesses, the court rushed from one manor to another at a breakneck speed 
of 15 manors in two months. There is little Roman law in the protocols, one of 
the few exceptions having to do with the torture case referred to above &ndash; and 
even that may not have been recognised as learned law by the contemporaries. 
Swedish law, instead, is mentioned on several occasions, and customary law is 
referred to as well.
</p>
<p>The protocols of the Dorpat District Court from 1632 are, however, an excep-
tion in the archives. Unfortunately, the next surviving protocols from the same 
court date to 1664. Thus we do not know how long the practice developed in 
1632 continued. By 1664, in any case, the procedure of the Dorpat District Court 
had completely changed. No Rechtsfinder, no Beisitzer; instead, the procedure 
had fallen solidly into the hands of the legal professional: legally trained judges

</p>
<p>and advocates now dominated the Court. The procedure had become a writ-
ten procedure, with advocates writing long pleadings to the court. The case 
docket looked completely different, and the peasants now figured only excep-
tionally in other procedural roles, rather than as the accused in penal cases. An 
overwhelming majority of the cases dealt with in the court were now internal 
disputes of the nobility; one looks in vain for horse thefts or calumny cases be-
tween peasants. Consequently, the court had almost ceased to travel: instead 
of the fifteen session sites of 1632, there were only three in 1664. Because the 
Court was no longer a court for the peasants, it was no longer necessary to go 
to where the peasants were. Noblemen and other litigants could instead easily 
come to where the court was.
</p>
<p>The protocols of the Dorpat District Court from the summer of 1632 are im-
portant, because they provide a rare glimpse of the institution of law-finders, 
whose workings had not been protocolled before the Swedish era. The view 
that we get with the help of these protocols is naturally not an authentic pic-
ture of a manorial court, but only of a mixed court, which was most probably 
a creation of Georg Stiernhielm&rsquo;s productive mind. Stiernhielm developed the 
procedure practically from scratch, in a situation in which no working judi-
ciary existed in the war-ridden Livonian countryside. The solution was thus 
unique in its kind, but interesting because of the way Stiernhielm combined 
traditional judicial elements with the new elements imposed by the conquer-
or. Stiernhielm kept the law-finders and the by-sitters, incorporating them into 
the new courts and thus abolishing the manorial courts. Stiernhielm&rsquo;s solution 
did not dominate even at the beginning of the Swedish rule, and also in Dorpat 
the solution to integrate peasants in the workings of the lower court did not 
prove to be a long-lasting solution.
</p>
<p>A different solution was chosen at the beginning in the Pernau Comital 
Court, the patrimonial court of the Thurn family. The first session of the Comi-
tal Court was held on 15 February 1632, thus only two weeks after the District 
Court Ordinance of 1632 had been issued. On that day &ldquo;her high and noble [&hellip;] 
Mrs. Countess of Thurn [&hellip;] allowed a court day to be held for penal affairs.&rdquo;131 
Six assessors had been chosen to assist the President Friedrich Regius. Two of 
them were Herren der Stadt, representatives of the town of Pernau. Apparently 
the principle of parity (Ebenb&uuml;rtigkeit) demanded that the burghers be repre-
sented in the court, since the town figured in one of cases as plaintiff. In the 
years 1632&ndash;1641 the number of the assessors varied from three to ten, with the 
nucleus of the personnel remaining unaltered and the number of additional 
</p>
<p>131 &ldquo;&hellip; hat Ihr Hoch undt Wolgebore: [&hellip;] frau Gr&auml;ffin von Thurn [&hellip;] zum Criminal Gerichtstag 
haltten la&szlig;en.&rdquo; nae 915.1.1.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>chapter 3124
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>assessors changing. Except for the two town burghers mentioned, all of the 
assessors were noblemen. It is most likely that they represented the different 
manors from which the cases originated. But there were no peasants sitting in 
the Court as law-finders.
</p>
<p>Thus, neither of the District Courts of Pernau or Dorpat followed the rules 
of the District Court Ordinance, according to which the district courts were  
to consist of three learned judges. Both district courts diverted from the  
Swedish statute, albeit in different ways and in different directions. The Ordi-
nance said nothing about Rechtsfinder, the parity principle, or additional as-
sessors. As years passed, the differences ebbed out, however, and both courts 
arranged their composition so that it corresponded to the requisitions of the 
statutory law.
</p>
<p>A third example brings us closer to the wording of the District Court Ordi-
nance. A complete protocol of the District Court of Wenden from 1639 remains 
in Stockholm&rsquo;s Riksarkivet. Although the Court only had 11 cases to decide, they 
nevertheless tell us something. The Court was presided over by District Court 
Judge (Landrichter) Franciscus Reiniken, who was assisted by two other noble 
judges. No Rechtsfinder took part in the proceedings. The parties were almost 
all peasants, and their cases ranged from assault (Maij, &ldquo;woman&rdquo; vs. J&uuml;rgen 
Suber, peasant) and witchcraft (J&uuml;rgen Pabbars, peasant vs. Kaus Mayssingh, 
peasant) to cases concerning marriage (Ehrinn, vagrant vs. Hinrich, foot sol-
dier) and pledge (Kauss Stahlen, peasant&rsquo;s wife vs. J&uuml;rgen, peasant). No lawyers 
were involved, and no official prosecution appeared in any of the cases. The 
Wenden District Court was thus similar to the Pernau one as far as its composi-
tion was concerned. Its clientele, then, resembled that of Dorpat more closely. 
It thus seems that in the initial phase of the Swedish rule, the statutory law was 
followed in a flexible way, and that many procedural variations existed side by 
side.
</p>
<p>It is clear that the peasant population must have engaged in all sorts of mi-
nor illegal activities, such as ranging theft, fighting, and violations of police 
ordinances. They also must have had at civil cases also in Pernau as they had 
in Dorpat and Wenden. Therefore, as I suggested above on the basis of statu-
tory material and on the fragmentary manorial court protocols, the manorial 
courts continued to function throughout the Swedish period. The virtual ab-
sence of peasants in the dockets of most of the Livonian district courts offers 
indirect evidence of the existence of manorial courts, where these cases must 
have been taken.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the docket of a Livonian lower court looked quite different from 
what could be gathered simply by reading the Landgerichtsordnung. In 1663, 
the Pernau District Court decided 92 cases in its summer session, from 24 June </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>to 27 July. Only 10 of these cases were criminal cases and the remainder were 
different kinds of civil cases. Except for some cases in which clergy were in-
volved, almost all of the civil cases were between noblemen.132 The nobility 
thus used the lower court voluntarily even though according to the statutory 
law their cases would have belonged to the high court. From the point of view 
of the Livonian nobility, it probably did not make much difference whether 
their cases were heard in the higher or lower courts as long as their peers heard 
their cases &ndash; as they were also in the lower courts. The access to justice might 
have been even easier at the local lower court for pure practical reasons, and 
even tactical considerations may have been involved, although on the basis of 
archival material, venue shopping cannot be shown.
</p>
<p>The District Court of Pernau was, thus, practically a court of the nobility. 
However, some criminal cases, of course with peasants as the accused, were 
also decided in the summer of 1663. All 10 cases involved serious charges: four 
cases of poisoning, two infanticide cases, one murder, two assaults, and one 
theft. But these few cases do not account for the problem of the &ldquo;lost&rdquo; peasant 
cases. It is quite certain that cases involving peasants only cannot have com-
pletely disappeared. Instead, manorial courts operating on the manors must 
have continued deciding them.
</p>
<p>At the end of the century, the Swedes were planning to establish new courts 
with a jurisdiction over the affairs of crown peasants. Legal professionals would 
have presided over these courts, and they would have included peasant juries &ndash;  
the Swedish model, in other words. The outbreak of the Great Northern War, 
however, prevented the reform from taking place.
</p>
<p>3.3.6 The Town Courts
Medieval cities had developed complex jurisdictional systems, typically with 
several specialized courts and overlapping jurisdictions. Much of the medieval 
complexity remained in the early modern period.133 Livonian law in the pe-
riod preceding the Swedish and Swedish law itself were no exceptions when it 
comes to the jurisdictional complexity in the urban centres.
</p>
<p>Riga, the model for the other Livonian towns, continued hosting several 
courts. The Town Council (Rat) was the most important, in charge of both

<p>civil and criminal affairs. It consisted of all the council members and a legally 
trained Syndicus, and enjoyed the services of legally trained secretaries. For 
criminal affairs, there was the public prosecutor (Official), who was also re-
sponsible for ensuring the legality of the proceedings. The council met from 
Wednesday until Friday, excluding feast days. Until the second half of the sev-
enteenth century, all court sessions were open to the public.134
</p>
<p>The Council had first-instance jurisdiction in matters concerning wills, in-
heritance, and immissions. The Council was also the appellate instance for 
several first-instance courts: the Court of Orphans (Waisengericht), the Amts-
gericht, the K&auml;mmereigerichte, the Court of Construction (Baugericht), the 
Church Court (Kirchengericht), and Court of Luxury (or the Court of Statutes; 
Luxuspolizei- or Gesetzesgericht). The general lower instance in town was the 
Bailiff &rsquo;s Court (Voigteigericht or Niedergericht), which handled all criminal and 
civil cases in the first instance.135
</p>
<p>Following the Riga model, the most important courts in Livonian towns 
were the bailiff &rsquo;s courts (Niedergericht or, as it is sometimes called, Vogteig-
ericht or K&auml;mnergericht) and the magistrate acting as court (often Obergericht, 
Rat).136 All urban power concentrated on the magistrate, and it was also the 
most important urban court, in charge of criminal and civil cases. The K&auml;m-
nergericht then, was the first instance, from which the civil cases came to the 
magistrate by way of appeal. The lower town court decided petty criminal cas-
es and inspected the more serious ones, which the town court finally decided. 
Both courts were lay-dominated. Professional lawyers were rarely involved in 
the cases, and the deciding magistrates had of course been chosen for reasons 
other than legal expertise.137
</p>
<p>The courts in small towns could be subjugated to the overlord of the town. 
This was the case at Wolmar, which belonged to Oxenstierna&rsquo;s fief. The town 
privilege given by Erik Oxenstierna in 1652 ordered that the town court&rsquo;s deci-
sions could be appealed to Oxenstierna&rsquo;s district court.138

courts fall outside the scope of this study.

<p>3.3.7 The Castle Courts
When Johan Skytte designed the Livonian judiciary, he took advantage of an 
old Polish institution, the castle courts. Two statutes were issued to regulate 
the castle courts, one in 1630 (Provisional Ordinance on Castle Courts) and the 
other in 1631 (Ordinance on Castle Courts).139 Three courts were established, 
one each in Dorpat, Kokenhusen, and Riga. The governor or commandant pre-
sided over the courts, which included 2&ndash;4 judges. The castle court now became 
an appeals instance between lower courts and the High Court, in addition to 
which the castle courts served as first instance in cases involving interests of 
the crown.140
</p>
<p>Crown interests seem to have been interpreted widely, as one of the few 
remaining protocols of the Dorpat Castle Court shows. In 1630, a Swede called 
Andreas Larsson stood accused of murdering another Swede, Per Israelsson. 
Larsson&rsquo;s lawyer was the learned Georg Stiernhielm, who did not hesitate to 
let his learning show in his writings and his statements to the court. The effort 
paid off, as Stiernhielm&rsquo;s client was not condemned to full ordinary punish-
ment, which would have been death, but to extraordinary punishment only 
(church penance and fines). The court, over which Jost Taube141 presided, han-
dled the case as first instance.142
</p>
<p>Bruiningk&rsquo;s register contains three appeals to the High Court from the Dor-
pat Castle Court (1630, 1634 and 1653), three from the Riga Castle Court (1634, 
and two from 1635) and two from the Narva Castle Court (1631 and 1639). The 
Kokenhusen Castle Court does not appear in the register.143 Of the eight appeal 
cases in the register, three concern land disputes, and five are debt cases.144
</p>
<p>The Swedish judicial reorganization mixed Livonian and Polish tradition 
with Swedish models, without being identical to any of them. Castle courts 
are a good example of this. Meurling has pointed out the analogy between 
the Swedish judicial hierarchy of lower courts &ndash; lawman&rsquo;s court &ndash; high court, 
and the Livonian system. She claims, however, that the similarity is superficial 
</p>
<p>139 Both are published in Friedrich Bieneman, &ldquo;Zur Geschichte der Schlossgerichte in Liv-
land,&rdquo; in Sitzungsberichte der Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Geschichte und Alterthumskunde der Ostsee-
provinzen Russlands f&uuml;r d. Jahr 1900 (Riga: W.F. H&auml;cker, 1901), 17&ndash;36, 25&ndash;31.

The castle courts of Swedish Livonia should not be confused with the few castle courts 
(borgr&auml;tter) in Sweden proper.

<p>only. The Livonian castle courts (unlike lawman&rsquo;s courts in Sweden proper) 
had a clear police function, as they were presided over by the governor.145 The 
leaning towards the interests of the Swedish crown rather than a wish to ac-
commodate the tribunal with provincial interest is reflected in the way legal 
sources were listed in paragraphs 5 and 11 of the Ordinance of 1631. Unlike the 
Ordinance on Landcourts (1632), which builds a hierarchy of sources (Livonian 
law, Swedish law, ius commune), the Ordinance on Castle Courts concentrates 
on Swedish legal sources, only briefly mentions Livonian customs, and fails to 
mention ius commune altogether.146 On the other, it should be noted that the 
appeal cases that came from the castle courts to the Dorpat High Court were 
typical civil cases and similar to those, which lawman&rsquo;s courts decided in Swe-
den proper.
</p>
<p>Because they were identified with the Swedish central government, the 
castle courts met with strong resistance from the very beginning. In 1634, the 
Livonian Order turned to the king asking him to abolish the castle courts. Ac-
cording to the Order, the procedure in Livonia was too slow, and there was 
not enough competent personnel to staff all the courts. Meurling has observed 
that the slowness in the first years of Swedish rule was partly also due to the 
fact that the judiciary had functioned so poorly in the years preceding the 
Swedish rule.147
</p>
<p>The final impetus to abolish the castle courts came from the motherland. 
In 1635, a new Swedish statute on governors (landsh&ouml;vdingar) was issued.148 It 
was applied in Livonia as well and prohibited governors from sitting as judges 
in courts. This complicated the workings of the Livonian castle courts, as a 
result of which the Kokenhusen court was shut down in 1636. The Riga castle 
court disappears from the sources in 1638, and the Dorpat court in 1639.149

</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the last appeal case from the Narva Castle Court to the 
Dorpat High Court came in 1639.
</p>
<p>Meurling explains the abolition of Livonian castle courts not only by the 
statute of 1635 but also by their closeness to the central administration. In this 
respect, the castle courts were different to the district courts and the High 
Court, which were more commonly run by the local Livonian nobility. Neither 
the Livonian nobility nor the Swedish nobility, which had settled in the prov-
ince, was fond of a strong central government in any form. As for the governors- 
general, although Johan Skytte favoured a strong central government, his  
successor Bengt Bengtsson Oxenstierna (1591&ndash;1643) was against it.150 At the 
end of the 1630s, the tide had turned against the castle courts, as the local no-
bility was gaining a leading role in the province.151
</p>
<p>Castle courts, thus, proved to be not much more than a short episode in 
the judicial history of Swedish Livonia. They hardly figure in the High Court 
sources, which is not surprising. As will be shown later, the High Court was 
primarily a first-instance court of the noble estate and received relatively few 
cases at all in appeal. The need to appeal district court decisions was not 
pressing, as mentioned above, since peasants were effectively barred from 
appealing to any court. For the few litigants who needed to appeal district 
court sentences, the High Court sufficed. To have another appeals instance 
below it was costly and time-consuming &ndash; in other words, superfluous.152 
In hindsight, the abolition of the castle courts did not cause problems for 
practical legal life. Livonia, small as it was and with a limited number of legal 
professionals, had a sufficient number of courts already without requiring a 
judicial middle level.

151 On the changing policy of the Swedish crown vis-&agrave;-vis the Livonian nobility, see  
</p>
<p>Heyde, Adelspolitik, 544&ndash;566. Gustav Adolf had treated Livonia as a conquered land, 
showing little understanding of the wishes of the nobility. Heyde argues that this pol-
icy changed under the tutelage government of Queen Christina and Chancellor Axel  
Oxenstierna. The Constitution of 1634 confirmed Livonia&rsquo;s position as a separate prov-
ince. The Livonian nobility was thus prevented from exerting influence on Swedish impe-
rial politics, but on the other hand the provincial Ritterschaft gained more say on internal 
affairs.

pealing district court decisions directly to the High Court. Meurling, Svensk domstolsf&ouml;r-

<p>3.3.8 The High Court of Dorpat
The High Court was established in Dorpat in 1630, as the third in a series of 
high courts founded in seventeenth-century Sweden. The establishment of the 
high courts formed part of the centralization efforts, which King Gustav ii Ad-
olf directed at the administration.153 The first of high courts had been the High 
Court of Svea (1614) and the second, the one in Turku (1623). One further high 
court was founded in the seventeenth century, the High Court of G&ouml;ta (1634) 
in J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping. The High Court of Svea was first established as an institution 
to which royal judicial power would be entrusted.154 However, the Procedural 
Ordinance of 1615 ordered that if a party was not satisfied with a high court de-
cision, he could apply for a beneficium revisionis from the king. The high courts 
thus became appeals instances, although not exclusively so. They were also 
first instance courts for the nobility.155
</p>
<p>The geographical jurisdiction of the Dorpat High Court covered Livonia 
with the exception of Riga, which the local bourgeoisie after serious negotia-
tions managed to secure under the jurisdiction of the distant Svea High Court 
in Stockholm. Skytte was anxious at first to draw the powerful town of Riga 
into the new jurisdiction. However, these plans not only encountered the op-
position of the Riga bourgeois elite, eager to keep its legal affairs out of the 
Livonian nobility&rsquo;s reach, but the plans also received little or no support from 
the king or his politically cautious Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna.156
</p>
<p>The Estonian nobility was strictly against Skytte&rsquo;s original plan to include 
both of the Baltic Sea provinces within the jurisdiction of the new high court. 
</p>
<p>153 As Mia Korpiola shows, the traditional interpretation which situates the founding of high 
courts within a great masterplan to rationalize Swedish administration, is probably far-
fetched; see Korpiola, &ldquo;A Safe Haven in the Shadow of War.&rdquo; It is altogether another matter 
that in hindsight the Svea High Court, together with the other high courts, came to form 
an important part of the Swedish administrative reform of the early seventeenth century.
</p>
<p>154 Several attempts to organise the king&rsquo;s judicial power were made during the reigns of 
Erik xiv and Charles ix, and the founding of Svea High Court should be seen against this 
background. For these earlier attempts, see Jerker Ros&eacute;n, Studier kring Erik xiv:s h&ouml;ga 
n&auml;mnd (Lund: Gleerup, 1955); and G&ouml;ran Setterkrans, &ldquo;Karl ixs h&ouml;gsta domstol,&rdquo; Scandia

</p>
<p>Cautious not to endanger their loyalty, the King finally decided not to include 
Estonia.157
</p>
<p>Ingria belonged to the jurisdiction as well, but was retracted from it and 
moved to the jurisdiction of the Turku High Court in 1684. The redrawing of ju-
risdictional boundaries occurred as a result of the Swedification policies of the 
crown. The Dorpat High Court had, apart from those policies, had problems in 
acting as an appeals court for the region, whose court system was organised 
entirely according to the Swedish model and where Swedish law was in use. 
In 1684 the Governor of Ingria, J&ouml;ran Sperling reported to the King that local 
judges were not doing their work well and that it took too long, sometimes 
years, for the Dorpat High Court to decide appeals. The King first reacted by ap-
pointing new judges to the region and by ordering the High Court to continue 
its sessions until all cases originating from Ingria were decided. The High Court 
was also ordered to make sure that no unqualified substitute judges were used 
in the region&rsquo;s judicial offices. Apparently this was not enough, because the 
King ordered the transfer of Ingria from the jurisdiction of the Dorpat Court 
to that of the Turku High Court after three months. To bring the region under 
the Turku Court, whose judges used Swedish laws on a daily basis, was a logical 
move.158
</p>
<p>The island of Oesel had fallen to Sweden in the Peace of Br&ouml;msebro in 1645, 
and Queen Christina in 1646 guaranteed their privileges to the estates of the 
island. Oesel had a judicial system of its own, which separated it from the 
mainland. The court structure included the district court (Manngericht), town 
courts (castle court and Wackengericht in Arensburg), a court of orphanage 
(Waisengericht), and an Oberlandgericht as an appeals court.159 The privilege 
letter of the Queen had established the Svea High Court as the appeals court 
regarding the decisions of the Oberlandgericht. The opinions of the local nobil-
ity varied, however, as to whether Svea or Dorpat High Court would better cor-
respond to their interests. Meurling suspects that both high courts were used 
until in 1661, when the Queen established by her resolution that the appeals 
would henceforth go to Dorpat.160
</p>
<p>The composition of the Dorpat court followed that of the other Swedish 
high courts. Besides a president &ndash; who was appointed by the king and usually 
came from the Swedish high nobility &ndash; and vice-president, the court consisted

<p>of 12 members (assessors, Assessoren). Half of the judges were noblemen, half 
of them learned jurists. The noblemen received a wage about 16% higher than 
the other assessors. The court also counted among other personnel: a secretary 
(Obernotar), notaries (Notarien), and chancery workers (Kanzlisten). In addi-
tion, the king appointed an advocate-fiscal (Advokatenfiscal, advocatus fisci) 
to oversee the workings of the court. The presidents rarely took part in the 
proceedings personally, which were instead led by the vice-president. Most of 
the vice-presidents were Livonian, with the exceptions of Georg Stiernhielm 
and Johan Stiernstr&aring;le.161
</p>
<p>As in the lower courts, the court language was German. Since the German-
Baltic judges had practically all studied at German universities, they were well 
versed in gemeines Recht, but obviously less knowledgeable in Swedish legal 
sources. Most of the judges had other jobs on the side during the first half of 
1600s: two of the judges (Hein, Stiernstr&aring;le) were professors at the Dorpat Law 
Faculty, some were burgermeisters at the same time as being judges (Stampehl, 
Schmieden), and some were also district court judges (Stiernhielm, Birkholz, 
Ceumern). The Swedish crown forbade high courts judges to hold other posi-
tions on the side in 1667, so that they would not interfere with the main re-
sponsibilities of the office-holders.162
</p>
<p>The High Court received its first statute, Hofgerichtsordnung, in 1630.163 
The Instruction was based on the Swedish Procedural Ordinance of 1615 (R&auml;t-
teg&aring;ngsprocess), of which it was largely a translation.164 As Meurling remarks, 
Paragraph 31, being a direct translation of the corresponding paragraph of the 
Swedish R&auml;tteg&aring;ngsprocess, thus states that the judge in charge of preparing a 
case should see whether the decisions of the lower courts were &ldquo;based on Swed-
ish laws, and [whether they] complied with it or not&rdquo; (&ldquo;in schwedischen Rech-
ten gegr&uuml;ndet, und damit &uuml;bereinkombt oder nicht&rdquo;).165 However, as discussed 
above, the Hofgerichtsordnung should best be understood in the context of the 
Verbesserte Landgerichtsordinanz of 1632, carefully placing the Swedish and  
Livonian law in relation with one another, and with the ius commune. Obviously,

<p>all parts of the judicial system needed to communicate with each other and 
apply the same legal sources.
</p>
<p>Paragraph 20 of the Hofgerichtsordnung, which was by and large an abbre-
viation of the Swedish Procedural Ordinance of 1615, provided the instructions 
regarding the High Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction. As mentioned above, the Court was 
the appeals instance for all civil cases decided by the lower courts in both the 
countryside and the towns in the provinces of Livonia, Ingria, and Carelia. Cas-
es with an interest of less than 50 dalers, however, were not appealable. Cases 
emanating from the courts in Ingria and Carelia were to be decided according 
to Swedish law.
</p>
<p>According to the same paragraph, several other categories of cases were de-
cided in first instance:
</p>
<p>1. The Court decided as first instance all crimes against the royal majesty 
(crimina laesae Majestatis), and against the state or state finances (causae 
fisci). These cases were, however, to be investigated at the lower courts 
(although not decided there).
</p>
<p>2. The Dorpat High Court decided as first instance cases of denegatio iusti-
tiae, or cases where justice had been denied or delayed, or in which the 
lower court was suspected of not being objective or being suspect.
</p>
<p>3. Testamentary cases of the nobility were first instance cases of the High 
Court.
</p>
<p>4. All cases regarding consistories, the church, gymnasiums, schools, hos-
pitals, and the like, as well as cases concerning governors, Statthalter, or 
royal economic interest, which could not be decided otherwise, belonged 
directly to the High Court, as well as
</p>
<p>5. all those cases that the crown itself ordered the High Court to hear and 
decide.
</p>
<p>The hgo needs to be read against the context of the lgo of 1630, which also 
contained important complementary information on the High Court&rsquo;s first 
instance jurisdiction. According to the lgo &sect;8, the following types of case  
belonged to the High Court jurisdiction as well: all cases concerning land privi-
leges, inheritance, succession, possession of noble goods, and serious crimes 
(nec non atrocissimarum injuriarum) by noblemen.166
</p>
<p>166 According to &sect;8 vlgo, if a nobleman was caught red-handed committing a crime, he 
was to be taken into custody and questioned at the local lower court, after which the 
documents and the suspect were to be delivered to the Government in Riga. See also Bud-
denbrock ii, 24, who says that in his time (the early nineteenth century) the norm was </p>

<p>chapter 3134
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Another interesting addition to the High Court jurisdiction came from the 
lgo of 1632 Art. 10, which stated that if peasants had claims against their lords 
or stewards, or the like (Herrschaft, und deren Haupt- und Amptleute oder Ar-
endatoren), because of excessive workloads or overly harsh treatment (wegen 
&uuml;berm&auml;ssiger Bedr&uuml;ckung und untr&auml;glicher Sch&auml;rffe), these claims were to go 
to the High Court directly. Even if a peasant did not make an official claim, a 
district court judge finding about an oppressive situation was obliged to ad-
vise the suspect to employ &ldquo;moderate behaviour&rdquo; (Moderation). Should he not 
comply, the judge was to inform the High Court.167 The normative content of 
the paragraph obviously relates to the contemporary German situation. In the 
German territories, as a result of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century peas-
ant uprisings, peasant-lord relations had become a distinctly legal matter. Lit-
erature, both pro-peasant and pro-landowner, had emerged.168
</p>
<p>Although the Swedish judicial regulation was thus used as a starting point 
when drafting the regulation on the Livonian judiciary, the Swedish laws were 
not slavishly copied but were instead adjusted to the local conditions. The divi-
sion of jurisdictions between the district courts and the High Court was clear 
and practically identical to that in Sweden proper. However, as court practice is 
observed, it becomes clear that the law in books was not necessarily the same 
as the law in action. Above I have already shown this insofar as the manorial 
courts continued to function during the Swedish period. As I will demonstrate 
further on, the Livonian legal reality proved to be considerably different to that 
of Sweden proper also when it came to the procedural practice.
</p>
<p>The Russo-Swedish war (1658&ndash;1660) interrupted the workings of the High 
Court of Dorpat. When Governor-General Clas Tott received instructions in 
1666 from King Charles xi&rsquo;s regency, it was especially noted that the Governor-
General should act in cooperation with the local nobility to ensure that the de-
structed high court building be repaired. Because caseloads had increased &ldquo;for 
this and that reason,&rdquo; it was also ordered that the High Court hold two yearly 
sessions instead of one from that time on.169
</p>
<p>still in full force, except that the case file was then no longer sent to the Governor first but 
straight to the High Court. Interestingly, the Swedish Judicial Ordinance &sect;14 (of which 
&sect;8 lgo was by and large a compendium) stated that crimes committed by all noblemen, 
not just those caught in flagrante delicto, were to be considered at lower courts and then 
decided at appeals courts.

<p>What happened to the High Court of Dorpat when the Great Northern War 
(1700&ndash;1721) broke out has remained something of a mystery. When the war be-
gan, preparations for evacuation started in Dorpat as well, although it took 
some time before the town itself became a target of military operations. In 1704 
the Russians conquered the town, which never returned to Swedish hands. 
Anna-Lisa Meurling, ending her research in the year 1699, fails to mention any-
thing of the Court&rsquo;s later fate during the early years of the eighteenth century. 
Heinz von zur M&uuml;hlen briefly mentions that the Court was transferred to Riga 
in 1700,170 whereas Margus Laidre claims that the Court was instead (in 1700) 
relocated to Tallinn &ldquo;under the King&rsquo;s orders and protected by guards.&rdquo;171
</p>
<p>Laidre&rsquo;s source here is Friedrich Konrad Gadebusch&rsquo;s Livl&auml;ndische Jahrb&uuml;ch-
er. Gadebusch, often regarded as the father of modern Livonian history-writing,  
relied on the records of Dorpat Town Council. According to the council re-
cords, the Court asked for permission to move its office and archives to  
Tallinn in February, 1700, because the town was no longer sufficiently safe. The 
commandant of the local garrison, however, refused to provide the necessary 
horses, which caused the Court to turn to the Council for help. Nothing came 
of the relocation this time.172 In September 1701 the Court informed the Coun-
cil again of its wish to relocate and, again, asked for horses to transport its ar-
chive. Governor-General Eric Dahlberg gave the Council orders to provide for 
two horses. The move was nevertheless delayed to the next year, and the Court 
held its first session in Riga &ndash; thus not in Dorpat &ndash; in 1703,173 where its activities 
as a Swedish high court continued until the capitulation to Russia in 1710.174

<p>important ways different to the other high courts in the Swedish realm. For one 
thing, the judges at the Dorpat court differed from their colleagues in Sweden 
proper. The hgo of 1632 stated that the judges were to be Swedish, German, or 
Livonian. The number of Swedish judges remained low always, however, and 
most of the judges were Baltic Germans. During the first four decades of the 
court&rsquo;s existence there were typically three or four Swedish judges in the court. 
Towards the end of the period there were even fewer Swedish judges, the 1680s 
representing an all-time low. In 1685, for instance, not one single Swedish judge 
sat in the court.175 According to the studies of Tering, half of the assessors (37 
out of 73) in 1630&ndash;1710 were of Estonian or Livonian origins, a rough fourth 
Swedes and a fifth Germans. For the Swedes, the Dorpat court was a stepping 
stone to other posts in the Swedish judiciary, which is why they usually stayed 
in Dorpat for a relatively short time. Although half of the posts were allotted to 
noblemen, they were often &ndash; especially towards the end of the period &ndash; men 
with legal training. This was especially case in the 1690s and 1700s when all as-
sessors, the noblemen included, were trained in law.176 Curiously enough, the 
end of the Swedish era was precisely the time when the Swedish laws poured 
into Livonia much more vigorously than at the beginning of the period.
</p>
<p>The judges of the High Court of Dorpat had studied in at least 20 different 
universities, and two thirds of the learned judges in more than one university. 
The Court was thus one of the most learned establishments in Swedish Livo-
nia. Among the most influential universities in terms of high court judges that 
had studied in them were Uppsala (20), Leiden (15), K&ouml;nigsberg (10), Jena (10), 
Rostock (9), Helmstedt (10), Dorpat (7), Frankfurt an der Oder (6), Leipzig (5), 
and Greifswald (5). However, the influence of Uppsala concentrated on the 
early decades of the 1630s and 1640s.177
</p>
<p>The local university, that of Dorpat, was not as influential for the develop-
ment of the local legal profession as one may think. The reasons are easy to 
understand. After its founding in 1632, the University ceased its functions in 
1656 when the Russians invaded Livonia and occupied the province for sev-
eral years. Already in the 1660s, plans to reopen the old &ldquo;Academia Gustaviana&rdquo; 
in Pernau emerged. Competing ideas, not least from the Town of Dorpat and 
the Livonian nobility, developed as well. Decisive steps were not taken until 
1687, when the Livonian Knighthood proposed to the King and the Governor-
General that the University be reopened in Dorpat. Things finally started to 
move, and Governor-General Johan Jakob von Hastfer (1647&ndash;1695) could hold

<p>his opening speech at the new &ldquo;Academia Carolo-Gustaviana&rdquo; in 1690. The idea 
of the University&rsquo;s reopening in Pernau had never died, not least because the 
construction of a new university building had been started in Pernau already 
before 1690. The move to Pernau became urgent again, connected to the upris-
ing of the Livonian nobility against the Swedes in the early 1690s. In 1699 the 
University was in fact transferred to Pernau, where it was closer to the Swed-
ish mainland and thus more controllable. The university continued to func-
tion until the Russians invaded the region again in 1710 as a result of the Great 
Northern War.178 Altogether the University thus operated for little more than 
four decades during the Swedish reign.
</p>
<p>Tering has been able to trace the career paths of more than a half (36/61) of 
the high court judges (Assessoren). The High Court was, for most, the pinnacle 
of their career, except for the judges of Swedish origin who often moved to 
other high courts in Sweden proper. Of the 36 cases, twelve had been judges in 
other Livonian courts, such as district courts, castle courts, the Upper Consis-
tory, or military courts. Thirteen had served as notaries or secretaries. Some 
university professors were also recruited. Not all judges were legal scholars: for 
instance, one of the earliest representatives of Newtonian teachings in Swe-
den, Sven Dimberg, was given a post in 1706. As mentioned earlier, many judg-
es held other jobs on the side as professors, burgermeisters, or district court 
judges. For instance, Georg Stiernhielm was district court judge at Dorpat (at 
the High Court 1630&ndash;42, 1689&ndash;49), and Caspar Ceumern in Pernau (at the High 
Court 1662&ndash;86). Most of the learned judges were also ennobled at some point, 
although not necessarily at the same time they were appointed.179
</p>
<p>Because the High Court was mostly the high point of a judicial career, it is 
understandable that the careers of the lower court judges were rarely as con-
vincing as those of the high court judges. The lower court judges were, howev-
er, always learned men, because nobility alone did not qualify for these posts.

<p>3.4.2 The Advocates in the Livonian Courts
Professional advocates already appeared in the Livonian district courts in the 
early years of the Swedish rule, although not nearly in all cases. Parties handled

<p>most of the cases themselves. Many legal problems involved manorial inter-
ests, and in those cases the steward usually represented the manor.180 Both 
civil and criminal law suits in the lower courts of the early Swedish period of-
ten took place without lawyers. In 1640, Christoffer Schiltt sued his father-in-
law Wolmer Kloett at District Court of Pernau for taking unlawful possession 
of a piece of land that Schiltt held in pledge (Pfand) from Kloett. Both parties 
wrote briefs in this case, and clearly without legal counsel.181
</p>
<p>Priests often stepped in for their parishes, as on 1 June 1640, when Christof-
fer Stade accused the soldiers Zibbi Muhr and Willy Pavel of the theft of the 
church case (Kirchenkaste).182 Pastors could also assist and represent peasants 
of the church (Kirchbauer): such a situation happened when Pastor Anders 
Friedrich D&ouml;pner represented the widow of one the church&rsquo;s &ldquo;fisher peasants,&rdquo; 
K&ouml;pp&ouml; Marts.183
</p>
<p>In the lower court protocols of the years 1640 and 1641, my material includes 
only three cases in which legal professionals took over the representation of 
a client. Even in these cases, they did advocacy only as a side job, not as full-
time engagement. In the early years of the Swedish rule, it was common for 
judges and prosecutors to handle this type of advocacy business to gain ex-
tra income. When the Pernau Lower Court held assizes in February of 1641 at 
the Luhde Manor, Judge (Landrichter) Gerhard von Lewenwolde represented 
Colonel Casper Ermiss, charging Elias Dirickher with violently preventing  
Ermiss from constructing a tavern (Krug).184 The President of the Pernau Lower 
Court, Ernest von Mengden, represented his nephew Aloff Anrep in a civil case 
in 1641185 and in another civil case against Wilhelm Rehbinder.186 In the third 
case Philipp Tinctorius, the public prosecutor at the High Court (Oberfiskal),  
assisted a client charged with contumacy.187
</p>
<p>180 For instance nae 915.1.3, f. 44. In this case, Philip Nothuelffer, the steward at the Ruien 
Manor, charged Hanss Mytzleff for not returning a peasant that had run away from Ruien 
and from his wife; and see e.g. steward Detmer von Damm on behalf of Johan and Lorens

<p>No professional lawyers appeared in the 1640 sessions of the District Court 
of Pernau when the sessions were held in Fellin, Ruigen, or other manorial 
houses. Some of the sessions were, however, held in the town of Pernau itself: 
there, the first lawyer whom I have not been able to identify as doing advocacy 
as a side-job only appears in the Court. Michael Schultotus appeared &ldquo;in the 
name and on behalf&rdquo; (&ldquo;in nahmen vnd von wegen&rdquo;) of Arendt Eckhoff in a slan-
der case against Isaac Bohn. Philipp Tinctorius, the above-mentioned prosecu-
tor at the High Court, again acted as counsel for the defendant.188
</p>
<p>Wives could also represent their husbands, as in the case of Pastor Joachimus 
Keibelius against the tenant of a manor house (Arrendator) Elias Diricksen. 
Keibelius charged Diricksen with hiring a Pole named Andres Lobbanowsky to 
set fire to Keibelius&rsquo;s house. Diricksen was himself present on 5 February 1641, 
when the case was first discussed in the District Court of Pernau. As the trial 
was continued the next day, Diricksen&rsquo;s wife (no name given) represented him, 
because of the husband&rsquo;s inability to attend because of &ldquo;weakness of the body&rdquo; 
(&ldquo;wegen schwacheit des Leibes&rdquo;).189 In the case of Gotthard Platzbeck vs. Mi-
chel Engelhart, his wife represented the absent Engelhart. The case, however, 
was postponed at the request of Mrs. Engelhart until her husband returned 
home.190
</p>
<p>During the latter half of the Swedish period, at least from the 1660s onwards, 
the lawyerization had advanced much further: advocates were commonly used 
in civil cases at lower courts and practically always at the High Court. The pres-
ence of lawyers clearly affected the court proceedings. In fact, the learned 
advocates seem to have been the prime difference between the Livonian and 
Finnish parts of the Swedish realm, and the most important reason as to why 
Livonian law in action looks almost completely different from the Finnish low-
er court procedures. Whereas Livonian law in the courts was, by the end of the 
sixteenth century, thoroughly learned, Finnish lower court procedures from 
the same period bears few to no signs of learnedness. The differences have to 
do with the way law was and could be communicated in the different parts of 
the realm. The Livonian lower court judges had normally studied in universi-
ties, often abroad, and there were three of them sitting at a lower court. In 
the Swedish and Finnish courts only the presiding judge sometimes had some 
legal training. It would have been much more difficult for the Finnish courts 
to lawyerize to the extent that the Livonian courts had. In the Livonian courts, 
lawyers talked with and wrote to legal professionals sitting in court. In the

</p>
<p>Finnish (and Swedish) courts, parties talked to courts consisting of lay panels, 
and legally trained judges only chaired the courts from the 1680s onwards. The 
strong presence of laymen in the Finnish-Swedish courts forced the court pres-
ident, whether he had legal training or not, to refrain from translating the legal 
disputes into a professional, international language of the law. In the Finnish 
courts of the countryside, learned advocates were virtually unheard of in the 
seventeenth century, whereas in Livonian courts they ran the whole show.191
</p>
<p>Because of the lack of protocols, it is difficult to say when exactly profes-
sional advocates took over the lower courts. At least in the town of Pernau, 
advocates were commonly used in the 1660s. In my example year, 1667, advo-
cates were an everyday occurrence in the Town Court. One of them, G&ouml;rner, 
appeared almost daily in court.192 The other two mentioned were the Town 
Secretary Fredericus Hippius and an advocate named Johannes Finicus, but 
they did not appear regularly in court.193
</p>
<p>Two decades later, lawyers had taken over the country courts as well. Most 
of the advocates showed their learning in the briefs they wrote and the talks 
they delivered in court. A good example of this is advocate Sch&ouml;nfeld and one 
of his several speeches on behalf of Jurgen Poribe, who was accused of slander 
in District Court of Pernau in 1690. I will cite the excerpt untranslated in order 
to preserve the linguistic interplay between Latin and German, so typical for 
Livonian lawyers:

<p>The courts were still small, and there was very little legal business. At the end 
of the century, the same court at Pernau usually still only had two or three ac-
tive advocates who handled cases regularly.195 This is in any case more than a 
couple of decades before the time that G&ouml;rner was clearly the only one lawyer-
ing full-time at Pernau. In addition, the official prosecutor of the High Court 
at Dorpat still often also assisted clients.196 Lawyers were also clearly behind 
many of the briefs signed only by the clients themselves.
</p>
<p>The High Court in Dorpat was, from the outset, a playground for lawyers. 
Practically all of the civil cases featured lawyers on both sides. Let only one 
example suffice. In 1630, Martin Hendesius represented a client (&ldquo;mein princi-
pal&rdquo;), while Johann Gerlach, the secretary of the Dorpat Town Council, repre-
sented the defendant.197
</p>
<p>Courts demanded advocates to prove that they had the right to represent 
their clients. When Advocate Schr&ouml;der appeared per mandatum for Mrs. Doro-
thea Barnowitz against Prosecutor Philipp Schirm for allegedly unpaid rent for 
a house in Pernau, Schirm made a procedural claim according to which he 
had not rented the house from Barnowitz but from her sons. Schr&ouml;der should

<p>have had a valid mandatum from the sons, but he could not produce such a 
document. The Court therefore dismissed the case and condemned Schr&ouml;der 
to fines.198 If an accused was summoned to appear in court personally, it was 
not tolerated that he was represented by an advocate.199
</p>
<p>The basic rule was that the loser in a civil case or an accusatorial criminal 
case paid the expenses of the winner. Sometimes the defendant could be or-
dered to pay the plaintiff &rsquo;s expenses even when he did not lose the case. In 
a libel case in 1696 of Pastor Andreas Hornung against Johan Friedrich Gant 
von Schieffelbein, the latter was acquitted. Schieffelbein had written a letter 
to the pastor, in which he had &ldquo;treated his former Beuchtvater und Seelensorger 
somewhat harshly.&rdquo; Although the contents of the letter did not amount to libel, 
according to the District Court of Pernau, Schieffelbein had &ldquo;given cause to the 
court case&rdquo; (&ldquo;zu [&hellip;] Process Uhrsach und Anlaβ gegeben&rdquo;). He was therefore 
ordered to pay the plaintiff six thalers in expenses. After the sentence, the pas-
tor asked for the immediate execution of the sentence, and the court ordered 
Schieffelbein to pay costs &ldquo;before leaving Holsterhoff&rdquo; (the manor where the 
Court held its session) on pain of double the cost (&ldquo;sub poena dupli&rdquo;).200
</p>
<p>The costs awarded to the advocates were often much less than what they 
tried to charge. Magnus von Linten&rsquo;s bill (&ldquo;Expens-Zettell&rdquo;) that his advocate 
presented to the Pernau Lower Court in 1690 to charge the cost from the other 
party, Lieutenant Anthon Friedrich von Fischbach, the loser of the case, to-
talled up to 47 thalers (Reichsthaler). Of this, the advocate&rsquo;s fee was 10 thalers. 
Although the Court reduced the sum considerably, to only 13 thalers, the bill 
gives some kind of an idea of the costs charged.201 Similarly, in Zimmermann 
vs. Mrs. Schlippenbach et al., the court mitigated the expenses of 71 thalers to 
only 17 thalers; of the original bill, the advocates &ldquo;trouble, journeys, and other 
costs&rdquo; formed 21 thalers.202
</p>
<p>Civil cases were where the money was, and Livonian professional advocacy 
began and flourished with these cases. Advocates seldom appeared in criminal 
cases, as defendants usually came from the poorer social layers and would have 
been unable to pay fees. The situation was the same on the plaintiff &rsquo;s side, at

</p>
<p>least at the beginning of the Swedish period when official prosecutors were 
still not very active in homicide cases. The victim&rsquo;s relatives had then no other 
chance that to bring forth the case themselves. This is what happened in when 
the Curwitz brothers, Fitin, Janus, and Hanss, charged Hanss and T&ouml;nnis Ten-
nacken with killing their brother Mats in a fight. The case was taken to court in 
February 1640, while the alleged crime had taken place in April 1638 &ndash; thus al-
most two years after. The delay was probably due to attempts at reconciliation, 
although the protocols reveal nothing of this.203 Sometimes, as in the Curwitz 
vs. Tennacken case, the plaintiff acted orally, but sometimes even lay plaintiffs 
presented their claims in written form.204
</p>
<p>In the latter part of the century, the accused in criminal cases seem more 
often to have acquired legal help, provided of course that they had the means 
for that. Thus merchant Gustav Nothhelffer hired advocate Beckman for his 
counsel when he had been accused by the official prosecutor of ver&uuml;bter hauss-
gewalt in Pernau Lower Court in 1690. Apart from writing a response brief to 
the actor&rsquo;s libellus, Beckman also produced two written testimonies on behalf 
of his client.205
</p>
<p>Cornet Remling had hired Advocate Beneck as his counsel, when he charged 
Christoph Beckman, the steward at Moysekyla manor, with illegal self-help (Ei-
genthatigheit). Beneck&rsquo;s colourful libellus describes how Beckman had realised 
a thorough, but unlawful search on Remling&rsquo;s premises, looking for peas that 
Beckman thought belonged to him. Beckman, assisted by two peasants, had &ldquo;in  
clear day light&rdquo; gone through &ldquo;rooms and cellars, boxes, and cupboards&rdquo; (&ldquo;kam-
mern und keller, kisten und kasten&rdquo;) searching for the goods. Threatening Rem-
ling&rsquo;s sister-in-law &ndash; who was present &ndash; Beckman had said that he must have 
the peas &ldquo;even if they are under ten keys.&rdquo; As the peas were not found, the al-
leged perpetrators took some boxes away with them. Such self-help was unac-
ceptable and the accused had behaved &ldquo;as if there were no more higher power, 
law and judges in the country, but as if there were only enemies&rdquo; (&ldquo;ob ware 
gar keine hohe obrigkeit, Richter noch Recht im Lander mehr zu finden, sondern 
alles feindl. gewesen&rdquo;). Also, the accused was assisted by a lawyer, Weisensee, 
who naturally did his best to save his client from punishment. The prosecu-
tor, Philipp Schirm, was not completely idle either. Before the Court retired 
for its deliberations, Schirm &ldquo;intervened&rdquo; (interveniendo), stating that he also 
demanded punishment.206 In another case, Philipp Schirm himself assisted

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Brackell in a theft case against Andres Hoch. Typically, 
Schirm did this as private attorney, not as public prosecutor.207
</p>
<p>The right to use advocates was self-evident, up to the point that sometimes 
the need to get a lawyer was used as a reason or maybe even an excuse to post-
pone the procedures. When Town Secretary Fridericus Hippius left the inheri-
tance case of the Damm heirs for the District Court of Pernau to be decided 
in 1688, Johann Schmidt asked the court to postpone the case so that he could 
get himself a lawyer, &ldquo;because he did not understand anything&rdquo; of Hippius&rsquo;s 
argumentation. Hippius protested, because the case was ready to decided, and 
the &ldquo;advocates could give or take nothing&rdquo; (&ldquo;die Advocaten k&ouml;nnen Ihme nicht&szlig; 
geben oder nehmen&rdquo;).208
</p>
<p>Schmidt&rsquo;s frustration is understandable, because Hippius&rsquo;s argumentation 
was not of the easiest kind for a layman to understand. The lawyer argued in a 
sophisticated manner, using Latin phrases in a way which would have hardly 
been accessible to a non-lawyer:
</p>
<p>Actor danckte im Nahmen seiner MittErben pro Citatione, repetirete 
sein vorig einbringen, vndt gebethene Execution, bahtt zue protocolliren, 
da&szlig; Er die handtschrifft vor die Seine Gerichtlich gestanden, worbey sie

</p>
<p>Hippius thus claimed that the exceptiones presented by the defendant in ear-
lier sessions belonged to an ordinary procedure and could not be treated in the 
kind of summary procedure that execution procedure was.209

<p>145Reorganisation of Livonian Judiciary under Swedish Rule
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Lawyers played a growing role in all Livonian courts thus almost from the 
beginning of the Swedish period, more in civil than criminal cases, and more in 
high courts than lower courts. By the end of the seventeenth century, however, 
Livonian legal life was mostly lawyerized. The only major exceptions were the 
serious criminal cases against peasants, who usually had no means of acquir-
ing legal advice.
</p>
<p>3.4.3 The Tower of Babel: The Languages in the Livonian Courts
At least six languages were heard and used in the Livonian courts in the Swed-
ish period: German, Swedish, Latin, Russian, Estonian, and Latvian. Occasion-
ally, French occurs in the court documents as well, and just before the Swedish 
period, Polish documents appeared frequently in the court procedures. The 
position each of these languages had in the daily workings of the courts will 
now be explained.
</p>
<p>The local languages &ndash; Estonian and Latvian &ndash; appear seldom in protocols, 
although they must have been heard every once in a while in court sessions. 
Not much though, since the peasants, who used the vernacular in everyday 
communication, only appeared as defendants in serious criminal cases or as 
witnesses in the lower courts and the High Court.210
</p>
<p>The main court language was German, the language of the educated elite, 
nobility, and townspeople. German had been the language of the elite since 
thirteenth century, when the German Order took over the Baltic area. Together 
with Latin, it was also the language that tied the Livonian legal system to the 
gemeines Recht. In the Baltic region, Middle Low German persisted as a liter-
ary language and a means of oral communication until the first half of the 
sixteenth century. By the 1620s, the transition of written language from Middle 
Low German (Mittelniederdeutsch) to New High German (Neuhochdeutsch) 
had been completed,211 although orthographical differences to the modern 
</p>
<p>210 For the use of vernacular (Estonian), see Pernau Lower Court 1690, f. 618 (&ldquo;Mis sinna te-
het Herris&rdquo;). See also tpc 1688, nae 915.1.1, f. 4, &ldquo;dortigen Sprache nicht kundig&rdquo;; and the 
tpc 1668, nae 1000.1.723, f. 94, &ldquo;Ehstnischen sprache m&auml;chtig.&rdquo; For instances of the Latvian 
language in the Livonian court protocols of the Swedish period, see P. Arumaa, &ldquo;L&auml;ti keelt

<p>language of course abound. The court style, like legal language often is,212 was 
complicated and the sentences often long. One typical example of this will 
suffice:
</p>

der beklagten, wegen despectirung der Gerichtl. brieffe intendirten ac-
tion produciret officialischer Anwalt zu mehren behauptung, einer deren

facti zu convinciren, aller ma&szlig;en producirtes attestatum durch 2. attes-
tantes so fort verificiret werden kan, submittirets hiemit zum abscheide.
</p>
<p>As far as law is concerned, languages are seldom neutral. The incidences of 
Latin in legal texts usually imply exposure to learned law, which in the case of 
Livonian judiciary was the gemeines Recht that they had studied in the German 
universities or the local German-language University of Dorpat. Thus, when in 
the Pernau District Court in 1688 Mrs. Dorothea Barnowitz, &ldquo;an old widow,&rdquo; was 
excused of contumacy charges because of ignorantia iuris, the concept of legal 
ignorance had to be known to the lawyers of the Court.213 Latin concepts such 
as this one were shorthand expressions for legal doctrines and could not easily 
be replaced by vernacular terms.
</p>
<p>The use of French was purely ceremonial. The language appeared in saluta-
tions, addresses, and titles. Philipp Schirm, probably for the sake of change, 
sometimes addressed the President of the Pernau Lower Court in French: 
&ldquo;Monsieur Christian de Ceumer, Assesseur de Justice Royal du Pernau offi-
cieusement &agrave; Fellin.&rdquo;214

</p>
<p>3.4.4 Voting in Court
Voting in courts was no everyday phenomenon but occurred often enough not 
to make it look like a complete rarity. Votes were basically taken over by le-
gal questions, evidence, and the quantity of punishment. As an example of 
the last mentioned, in the case of Philipp Schirm, the prosecutor vs. Gustav  
Nohtthelffer, in the case of breaking domestic peace at the District Court of 
Pernau in 1690, two of the judges thought that the accused had wounded the 
victim with a sword, whereas one of the judges thought that it was only a verbal 
assault. Nohtthelffer was condemned, by majority vote, to a fine of 20 thalers, 
whereas one of the judges would have sentenced him to only a 10-thaler-fine.215
</p>
<p>The District Court of Pernau voted also in a duel case of Schlippenbach vs. 
Wachtell (see above), in which the plaintiff was absent but had left a clearly 
insufficiently formulated libellus to the court. Assessor Harnisch would have 
absolved Wachtell ab instantia. The majority absolved Wachtell, stating how-
ever that &ldquo;should the plaintiff not wish to drop the case completely, it is his 
responsibility for bringing it to the next court session de novo.&rdquo;216
</p>
<p>Assessor Harnisch also dissented in 1690 in a case involving the assessment 
of proof. Prosecutor Schirm accused Inspector Schmidt, the Arrendator or ten-
ant of Tennesilm manor, of not attending church services as he should have 
according to the Royal Prayer Placate. It did not seem certain whether the ac-
cused had been physically in such a bad condition, as he claimed, that he had 
not been able to attend church. According to assessor Harnisch&rsquo;s somewhat 
unclear opinion, the accused was &ldquo;not to be completely absolved of the Her 
Majesty&rsquo;s Criminal Placate&rdquo; (&ldquo;al&szlig; ist Er dahero von der Ihr. K&ouml;nigl. Maytt: straff 
Placat nicht g&auml;ntzlich zu befreyen&rdquo;). The majority (the President and assessor 
von Ceumern), however, wanted to give the inspector a chance to present wit-
nesses, because &ldquo;he was not to be deprived of such a defence&rdquo; (&ldquo;al&szlig; ist ihm 
solches al&szlig; ein defension Mittell nicht abzuschneiden&rdquo;). In the final sentence, 
Harnisch stuck to his opinion, whereas the other judges freed the accused on 
the basis of purgatory oath.217
</p>
<p>Some of the voting had to do with procedural practicalities, as in the case 
of Captain David von Hollern vs. Colonel Wolf Henrich von Anrep&rsquo;s widow, 
Mrs. Anna Dorothea von Ungern Sternberg, in which the cited party did not 
appear before the Pernau Lower Court. Since this was already the second time, 
Harnisch would have sentenced directly according to the plaintiff &rsquo;s demands, 
but the other two judges decided to give Mrs. von Ungern Sternberg one more

</p>
<p>3.4.5 The Courts and the Government
An independent judiciary is a modern invention, which did not exist in the 
early modern period. However, this does not mean that crown officials would 
have continuously interfered in individual cases. The possibility of doing that 
on general level was nevertheless self-evident in the early modern period, 
when judicial, legislative, and administrative powers were not separated. The 
crown steered the working of the high courts with a help of a continuous flow 
of letters, and the high courts themselves also asked for the crown&rsquo;s advice. As 
mentioned above, in both Sweden proper and Livonia, as elsewhere in early 
modern Europe, commissorial courts were a common way of handling politi-
cally or otherwise delicate issues outside the ordinary judicial system.219
</p>
<p>In Livonia, the governor-general as the crown representative was the most 
important official to meddle directly with the courts cases. By law, the gover-
nor-general acted as the executing official of the court decisions. Other than 
that, most of the cases were too unimportant for the governor-general to both-
er with, and in most cases his office had no automatic way of knowing what 
kind of cases were on the docket. Neither do we know of any cases in which 
the governor-general would have attempted to assume any of the legal respon-
sibilities of the judiciary for himself.220
</p>
<p>But in some cases the Governor-General did interfere. In 1690 Joachim  Olrau 
claimed that his female family members had been slandered by the Quarter-
master (Quartiemeister) Wilhelm Stuart, who with a group of other soldiers 
had also unlawfully entered the plaintiff &rsquo;s house and attacked him and his 
household. Olrau thus turned to the Governor-General asking for his protec-
tion (&ldquo;in de&szlig;en mit und meinem Hause f&uuml;r fernern Gewalt sch&uuml;tzen und befreyen 
m&ouml;gen&rdquo;). Olrau also asked that the Governor-General see that the defendants 
be sent to answer at the Town Court of Walk. This was not done, but instead 
the Governor-General sent the defendants to the Pernau District Court.221

<p>149Reorganisation of Livonian Judiciary under Swedish Rule
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>In the case of Pastor von Audern vs. von Linten, at the District Court of 
Pernau in 1690, the Court had also received a rescript from the Governor- 
General.222 Carefully formulated, the Court stated that &ldquo;[w]hile according to 
the Royal Land Ordinance the Royal District Court is to proceed summarily in 
less important matters, and because the rescript of the Royal General Govern-
ment aims at the same,&rdquo; it might be possible in principle to take the case. How-
ever, as the Court felt it problematic to proceed on the basis of what it thought 
was an overly sketchy libel letter (libellus). Therefore, the Court decided not to 
inquire into the case.223
</p>
<p>In sum, little evidence exists to show that the crown either directly or 
through the governor-general would have routinely interfered into the work-
ings of the Livonian judiciary. However, the possibility of establishing commis-
sorial courts for almost any purpose greatly diminished the need of interfering. 
The institution of r&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; judiciaire, in which high courts submitted dfficult legal 
questions for the crown to decide, was also in use. Royal decisions in referred 
cases were communicated to all high courts of the realm.
</p>
<p>3.5 Summary
</p>
<p>Seventeenth-century Sweden was a typical early modern composite state or 
small empire, with possessions in the Baltic area and in Germany. Whenever 
new territories were added to a composite state, the conditions of annexation 
were separately negotiated and decided. A series of questions had to be taken 
into account. The organization of the judiciary belonged to the most urgent of

<p>As is usually the case, the Swedish conqueror had to depart from the exist-
ing circumstances. In spite of the chaotic situation that had lasted for decades, 
Livonians, along with the rest of central Europe, had been on their way to a 
reception of ius commune. In Sweden, the reception had not been taken as far 
and consisted largely of filtering the ius commune norms and adapting them in 
a simplified form for local use.

<p>The town courts were arranged according to the Riga model, which was by 
and large also the Swedish model. The most important courts were the bailiff &rsquo;s 
courts (Niedergericht or, as it was sometimes called, Vogteigericht or K&auml;mnerg-
ericht), and the magistrate acting as court (often Obergericht, Rat). All urban 
power concentrated on the town council (Rat), and it was also the most im-
portant town court, in charge of criminal and civil cases. The K&auml;mnergericht 
then, was the first instance, from which the civil cases came to the magistrate 
by way of appeal. The lower town court decided petty criminal cases and in-
spected the more serious ones, which the town court finally decided. Both 
courts were lay-dominated. Professional lawyers were rarely involved in the 
cases, and although sometimes deciding magistrates could have legal training 
they had been mainly been chosen for their familial standing and not their 
legal expertise.
</p>
<p>The High Court was established in Dorpat in 1630, as the third of a series of 
high courts founded in seventeenth-century Sweden. The judges were to be 
Swedish, German, or Livonian. The number of Swedish judges remained low 
always, and most of the judges were Baltic Germans. Although half of the posts 
were allotted to noblemen, they were often &ndash; especially towards the end of the 
period &ndash; men with legal training.
</p>
<p>In the early years of the Swedish rule, learned lawyers rarely appeared as ad-
vocates. If they did, it was as a side job only. Parties themselves handled most 
cases, or had representatives other than legal professionals. Towards the end of 
the seventeenth century, the situation changed, and lawyers regularly assisted  
clients in civil cases and sometimes in criminal cases as well, especially noble 
clients when accused for crimes. The procedure in the High Court was com-
pletely in the hands of learned lawyers from the outset.
</p>
<p>The Swedish crown seldom interfered the working of the Livonian judiciary. 
The &ldquo;judicial revolution&rdquo; had advanced to a certain extent by the seventeenth 
century. In other words, although the judiciary could not in theory gain inde-
pendence from the crown, in practice the division of labour had developed to 
the point by which the crown and its officials rarely bothered to venture into 
the judicial area. If pressing needs occurred, commissorial courts were always 
at the crown&rsquo;s disposition.</p>

</p>
<p>The Procedure in the Livonian Courts of the 
Swedish Era
</p>
<p>4.1 The Classification of Cases into Civil and Criminal
</p>
<p>In modern law, criminal law involves crimes and punishments, whereas civil 
law does not. Procedurally, a public prosecutor initiates criminal cases, where-
as private parties pursue civil cases. Medieval and early modern law carried 
slightly different distinctions.
</p>
<p>In legal literature, delicts were divided into civil and criminal types. Benedict 
Carpzov, the leading German scholar, enumerated several features separating 
civil law delicts from actual crimes. Civil delicts carried &ldquo;civil&rdquo; punishments 
(b&uuml;rgerliche Strafe), such as fines, whereas crimes carried &ldquo;painful&rdquo; punish-
ments (peinliche Strafe), such as maiming or death. As for civil delicts, the 
defendant could not normally be taken into pre-trial custody (incarceratus), 
except when not able to place a warranty (&ldquo;incarceratus sub cautione fidejusso-
ria est&rdquo;). Torture could only be used in criminal cases. Contrary to civil delicts, 
criminal cases could never be decided on circumstantial evidence or violent 
presumption alone.1 Civil delicts were dealt with through the help of adver-
sarial (also called accusatorial) procedure, whereas criminal delicts called for 
inquisitorial procedure.
</p>
<p>Livonian statutory law did not quite follow the teachings of gemeines Recht, 
which Carpzov typically represents. Criminal cases in the Middle Ages were 
still not clearly distinguished from civil cases. The Mittlerer Livl&auml;ndischer Rit-
terrecht, Chapter 77 stated: &ldquo;Es darf der Richter nicht &uuml;ber das, was nicht vor 
Gericht ausgeklaget wird, Recht sprechen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;wo kein Kl&auml;ger ist, da ist kein 
Richter.&rdquo; Thus, without a plaintiff, there was no case. During the Swedish pe-
riod, criminal procedure had evolved to become status-based. According to 
the vlgo of 1632 (art. xxv), the accusatorial procedure was the main rule in 
all criminal cases against noblemen. The only exception were the &ldquo;hochp&ouml;nli-
che Laster,&rdquo; crimes punishable by capital or corporal punishments, and which 
were to be processed inquisitorially. The term was obviously a translation of 
the Swedish h&ouml;gm&aring;l, which constituted the most serious category of crimes

</p>
<p>in Sweden in the Middle Ages. According to the vlgo, whenever there was no 
private prosecutor but a crime had nevertheless taken place, a district prosecu-
tor (Kreisfiskal) stepped in to perform the duty of the official prosecutor (actor 
officiosus). Although according to the noble privileges noblemen were only to 
be tried in the lower court but were not sentenced there, a prosecutor was 
thus necessary. The high court prosecutor (Oberfiskal), on the contrary, was not 
normally involved in prosecuting noblemen. A major exception to this were 
the majesty crimes (crimina laesae majestatis), which were directly tried in the 
high court as the first instance.2
</p>
<p>The living law was, however, not the same as the law in the books. I will first 
discuss the lower court procedure in four parts: civil procedure, accusatorial 
procedure, accusatorial procedure with a prosecutor, and inquisitorial proce-
dure. After that the high court procedure and the so-called revision procedure 
from the high court decisions to the king will be discussed. To avoid repetition, 
some features, which are common for all procedural types, will be treated un-
der civil procedure.
</p>
<p>To give an idea of the relative frequency of the different modes of proce-
dure, some statistics are necessary. In the winter and summer seasons of 1640 
the Pernau District Court handled 32 cases, of which 12 were civil cases and the 
rest (20) were accusatorial criminal cases. The civil cases were about the own-
ership of serfs and land, in addition to which one isolated debt case appeared.
</p>
<p>Thus, all criminal cases were accusatorial. These included three homicides, 
one of which led to a death punishment. There was also one infanticide case, 
in which the Court asked the High Court of Dorpat for permission to torture 
the suspect, and the permission was granted.
</p>
<p>Almost 50 years later, in 1688, the Pernau District Court heard 94 cases. 
Fifteen of them were civil cases and 26 accusatorial cases; thus, the numbers 
were practically the same as in 1640. However, two other groups had appeared, 
which had not existed at all in 1640. There were 28 prosecutor-driven accusa-
torial cases and 25 inquisitorial cases. The grip of the state on criminal proce-
dures had considerably tightened.
</p>
<p>In addition to the four classes of cases explained above, the town court re-
cords include a considerable number of entries which are, more than anything, 
administrative by nature (Stadtsachen, as they are marked in the protocols). 
For instance, in 1619 the alderman of the Greater Guild, Daniel Reder, brought

<p>a list of petitions to the Council that the Guild wished the Council to consider. 
The Guild thought that it would be wise to start burning chalice at the Land-
g&uuml;ter that the town owned, so that the chalice could be used to repair town 
houses. The Guild was also worried about the custom of those dwelling outside 
the town limits (Vorstedter) who were &ldquo;bringing beer from the countryside and 
selling it in the suburb.&rdquo; This caused damage to the city. The Council promised 
to consider both problems.3 I will not, however, discuss these &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; 
cases further in this study.
</p>
<p>4.2 The Civil Procedure in the Lower Courts
</p>
<p>4.2.1 What was a Civil Case?
Not only were the categories of criminal cases construed differently to the 
way they are classed in modern law, but the early modern society also pro-
duced civil cases, which seem exotic to the modern mind. The legal problems 
concerning peasants are the case in point. Runaway peasants caused a con-
siderable amount of litigation in Livonia. In February 1641, when the District 
Court of Pernau sat at Fellin Manor, Wilibald von Bergen &ndash; the manorial lord &ndash;  
brought the peasant M&ouml;nnicke Michel to court to tell his story, because the 
lord of Karkus, Krausen, was demanding him as his runaway serf. Michel at-
tested that he was originally from Oesel. He had previously been at Karkus, but 
had been freed in order to become a foot soldier (Knecht). Nine years earlier, 
already a free man, he had moved to the estates of Fellin, something which was 
also testified to by a witness.4
</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of Livonian peasants were thus serfs, and were 
treated as property. At the same assizes at Fellin, Gotthard Platzbeck demand-
ed that Michel Engelhart return three of his peasants. Engelhart, represented 
by his wife, claimed that the peasants had been exchanged for other peasants. 
She was willing to return the peasants if she could get her own peasants back. 
After the hearing, the Court concluded that the steward had exchanged the 
peasants without the consent of his lord, and two of them were ordered to be 
returned within four weeks. The third one, Surwa Matz Wilm, according to the 
Court, had only lived at Karkus as a son-in-law (hauss Schwager) and served as a

<p>Knecht there. While he was actually a peasant (&ldquo;Erbbauer&rdquo;) at Fellin (the manor 
of Engelhart), he was not ordered to be returned.5
</p>
<p>The feudal social structure sometimes produced interesting possibilities 
for plaintiffs to pursue their rights. At the Pernau Lower Court in 1641, Andres 
Scharffenbach came forth with a civil case against Aloff Anrep, whose peas-
ant Lauke Peter had allegedly stolen Scharffenbach&rsquo;s horse. Scharffenbach now 
wanted Anrep to pay compensation. After the theft had been proven, the Court 
ordered Anrep to compensate within six weeks. The peasant was to be taken 
into custody (&ldquo;zur gefenglichen haft einschicken&rdquo;), and &ldquo;he was not to be let out 
of prison, before the plaintiff Andres Scharffenbach be fully satisfied including 
expenses.&rdquo;6 The case was thus treated fully as a civil case, and the peasant was 
in fact treated as a guarantee for payment.
</p>
<p>How often were civil cases taken to court and decided in favour of one of 
the parties? How often were cases taken to court, but either not decided defini-
tively (because of an extrajudicial agreement) or ended in an agreement con-
firmed by court decision? And how often were civil cases decided completely 
out of court? Because of the incompleteness of the archives, it is not possible 
to give exact figures. It is, however, clear from the archival material that all 
variants occurred. In one of his letters, Judge Georg Stiernhielm, for instance, 
mentions that a court case of his against the Town of Dorpat had been brought 
to an end thanks to &ldquo;good men&rsquo;s intervention&rdquo; (&ldquo;godhe M&auml;ns interposition&rdquo;), 
meaning arbitrators.7 In this study we must leave these extrajudicial legal phe-
nomena aside, however, and concentrate on the actual judicial processes.8
</p>
<p>4.2.2 Starting the Process: The District Court Ordinance
The vlgo of 1632, as mentioned above, was the major piece of legislation regu-
lating the procedure at the lower courts. It is by no means a complete descrip-
tion of the procedure, leaving many details for the court practice.
</p>
<p>In the Livonian civil procedure, the case began with the plaintiff asking the 
Court for a citation. According to the Landgerichtsordnung (Art. 8), the citation 
had to be obtained from the district court judge (Landrichter). The plaintiff

<p>had to explain the reason he wanted the counterparty cited to court, and the 
citation needed to be delivered at least 14 days before the court session, by one 
or two people. They had to hand the citation to the citatus either in person or 
to someone in his household. The 14 days was a novelty, different to the Ritter-
recht&rsquo;s six weeks, which was also the law in Estonia (Ch. 114).9 If the summoned 
party did not appear in court, he was summoned again. If he then could not 
lawfully explain his absence, he had to pay the costs. If he did not appear at all, 
he lost the case (Art. 14, Verbesserte Landgerichtsordnung).
</p>
<p>The vlgo aimed at establishing oral procedure. According to Article 15 of 
the Ordinance, &ldquo;no written procedure shall be allowed, but everything shall 
be handled orally and summarily.&rdquo;10 The Swedish oral tradition had clearly in-
fluenced the article, but the rule never really took root in the Livonian prac-
tice. Already in the earliest protocols from the 1640s, written statements were, 
however, sometimes used.11 In the latter half of the century, civil procedure 
predominantly consisted of exchanging legal briefs.12 If one of the parties 
wanted the court to proceed summarily, this had to be asked for expressly. Pas-
tor Johannes Vestring accused Advocate G&ouml;nner of slander in 1668, wanting 
a &ldquo;processum summarium,&rdquo; &ldquo;absque strepitu judicij&rdquo; so that the accused would 
be obliged to answer to the charges right away. The lawyer, however, claimed 
that he was &ldquo;not responsible for answering to the charges immediately&rdquo; and 
the plaintiff &ldquo;could not deprive him of the beneficia iuris&rdquo;; instead, he ought to 
proceed &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; (&ldquo;ordentlich&rdquo;).13
</p>
<p>At gemeines Recht, parties in a civil case could demand that the opposing 
party place a guarantee (cautio, B&uuml;rgschaft) with the court.14 The Livonian law, 
unlike Swedish law, knew this institution as well. However, no guarantee was 
demanded on landowning parties, and if people other than a land-owning 
party could not place a guarantee, they were allowed to take an oath instead 
(Art. xvi).
</p>
<p>Calumny oaths (juramentum calumniae or malitiae) were another ius com-
mune institution. A party in a civil case swore that he would not engage himself

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>chapter 4156
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>in court proceedings simply for the sake of chicanery. Already in pre-Justinian 
law, juramentum calumniae was known in relation to specified procedural ac-
tions, and Justinian extended the institution to the complete legal process.15 
Canonists and gemeines Recht authors then developed the institution, so that 
juramentum calumniae now came to refer to the larger version of the institu-
tion whereas juramentum malitiae referred to the more specified oath. Jura-
mentum calumniae found its way also to the J&uuml;ngste Reichsabschied (1654), one 
of the most important pieces of early modern German procedural legislation.16 
Unlike the legal practice in the Estonian Oberlandsgerichte,17 the Livonian Or-
dinance of 1632 squarely forbade juramentum calumniae (Art. xvii). This was 
probably due to the fact that the calumny oath was unknown in Swedish law. 
Neither version of the oath is found in the Livonian legal practice either.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Ordinance left the civil procedure for the court practice to 
regulate. The plaintiff presented his arguments either orally, or in the written 
form of a Klaglibell or libellus, thus setting the stage for the lawsuit. In the early 
protocols, oral arguments appear side by side with written briefs, often drafted 
by lawyers.18

<p>157The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>4.2.3 Procedural Claims
Procedural claims were common in Livonian courts. They were an essential 
part of the advocates&rsquo; strategy to delay the procedures in order to gain time for 
negotiations or to tire the other party out. One of the most common claims 
involved the problem of the correct forum. A good example is from the year 
1688, when Lieutenant Carl Friedrich Lilienfeld, the tenant (Arrendator) of the 
island of Kyhn (Kihnu), was charged by his peasants with their mistreatment. 
The Pernau District Court dismissed the case because the forum was not ap-
propriate. The defendant being a nobleman, the case should have been taken 
to the High Court.19 The Court&rsquo;s interpretation is questionable, however, be-
cause the District Court Ordinance actually stated that the cases of the nobility 
should be inspected in a lower court, which was then to send the documents to 
the high court for the decision.
</p>
<p>This was the stand taken by the same court in another case two years later. 
The question on the forum superioris was discussed in the case of aggravated 
assault at the Pernau Lower Court (1690, Johan Christoff Beneck vs. Lieuten-
ant Caspar Haacken). Advocate Weisensee, on behalf of Haacken, asked the 
Court that &ldquo;Mr. Beneck would let [Weisensee&rsquo;s client] free from this court [&hellip;] 
and [&hellip;] to turn to the High Court with his charge, insofar as he does not wish 
to give it up.&rdquo;20 The Court voted on the matter. Assessor Harnisch, following 
the letter of the law, stated as his opinion (sentiment) that it was the lower 
court&rsquo;s task to make the inquiry (Inquisition) in the case, and then send the 
file to the high court for a decision.21 President von Anrep and Assessor von 
Ceumern, however, thought that the case had been brought to court at such an 
early phase that it was up to the plaintiff first to specify his demands before the 
trial could continue at all.22

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>In another case at Pernau Lower Court in 1688, actor officiosus Philipp 
Schirm brought charges against Johann Grake, Mortiz Bretholz, and their 
wives. Schirm actually charged only the wives for fighting with each other 
in church, and the husbands were summoned because they were their legal 
guardians. In his exceptio, Bretholz identified three problems related to the 
problem of correct forum. For the first, according to the Consistorial Order &sect; 8,  
all cases of alleged violence in church belonged to the consistorial courts.23 
For the second, the name of his wife had not been mentioned in any of the of-
ficial court documents (&ldquo;weder in supplica noch Citatione ihren Nahmen benen-
net&hellip;&rdquo;). Bretholz argued that although he should represent his wife as her legal 
guardian (&ldquo;ehelicher Vormund und Paterfamilias&rdquo;), he ought not to be charged 
for the crime. And for the third, were he nevertheless charged with slander, as 
Grake&rsquo;s writings to the court seemed to imply, his correct forum should then 
be the high court as forum privilegiatum for the nobility. The Court accepted 
Bretholz&rsquo;s &ldquo;exceptio fori declinatoria&rdquo; and advised Schirm to redirect his charges 
to the consistorial court.24
</p>
<p>The argument about forum domicilium also appeared. The advocate of  
Johann Lorentz Hammerin answered the civil charge against his client by 
claiming that Lorentz &ldquo;did not belong under the Royal District Court of Per-
nau.&rdquo; Therefore the plaintiff had to take the case to the Dorpat Court, which was  
where Lorentz resided, &ldquo;because the plaintiff has to follow the forum of the 
defendant.&rdquo;25 In the case of Fiscal Philipp Schirm against Johann Grake et alia, 
the defendants claimed that the citation did not mention their names, thus

<p>23 According to the Livonian Consistorial Order of 1636 &sect; 7, &ldquo;order in ecclesiastical ceremo-
nies&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ordnungh der Kirchen Ceremonien&rdquo;) indeed belonged to the jurisdiction of lower 
consistories. However, the paragraph hardly meant by &ldquo;order&rdquo; violent crimes but rather 
matters of faith. In any case, ecclesiastical jurisdiction in criminal matters never exclud-
ed secular jurisdiction, but came in addition to it. This was typically the case in sexual 
crimes, to which the same &sect;7 also refers. See Ernst Hj. J. Lundstr&ouml;m, Bidrag till Livlands

<p>causing &ldquo;a lack of an important requisite.&rdquo; In the same case, the defendant also 
claimed, in his exceptio, that all iniuria cases against noble people belonged to 
the High Court26 &ndash; and the defendant was correct of course.
</p>
<p>The Pernau Lower Court voted again on procedural issues when the widow 
of Marts K&ouml;pp&ouml;, a fisher peasant for the Auder Pastor, complained about Lieu-
tenant Jakob Linten, who had allegedly taken away her boat, her &ldquo;only means 
of livelihood.&rdquo; The procedural problem was as follows. Judge J.A. von Anrep, the 
President of the Pernau Court, had given a summons at the request of the wid-
ow Marrette. According to the summons, Linten should either replace the boat 
and repair the damages to the widow, or appear at court where the case could 
be solved. Linten complained that he had not enjoyed the 14 day period of 
summons, which he should have had according to the Landes-Constitution, but 
had only 10 days. However, the Court argued that it was &ldquo;all things considered&rdquo; 
(&ldquo;gestalten sachen nach&rdquo;) not &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; (&ldquo;billig&rdquo;) that Linten should be able 
claim that he was not lawfully summoned. Linten was thus ordered to plead to 
the charges, which he did. He was given two hours to prepare himself,27 and he 
came back with a written brief, clearly written by a legal professional. Before 
replying to the charges, Linten still made the Court decide whether the Pas-
tor should be ordered to place a pledge (cautio) to cover for Linten&rsquo;s eventual 
&ldquo;damages and costs.&rdquo; According to the Court, however, it was too early to ask 
for such a pledge.28
</p>
<p>The case was postponed, and when it was taken up again in January 1690 
(after more than six months), the Pastor was armed with a letter from none 
less than the Governor-General Erich Soop,29 in addition to which the pub-
lic prosecutor now appeared on the side of the widow. It is evident that  
the governor-general and the prosecutor did not get involved only to defend 
the poor widow&rsquo;s rights. The Governor-General was careful not to take a stand

<p>on the actual case, and the Prosecutor was (most probably) ordered to take the 
case.30
</p>
<p>Summary procedure was, according to the contemporary criminal law lit-
erature, not used in serious criminal cases. The matter arose in a case at the 
Pernau Town Court in 1667, when Pastor Vestring accused Advocate G&ouml;rner of 
libel. Since, as Vestring argued, G&ouml;rner&rsquo;s crime was obvious and affected the 
priest&rsquo;s professional life so much, the court should proceed summarily (sine 
strepitu iudiciarii). The lawyer, however, replied that he should be given time to 
prepare his defence, because it was not lawful to proceed summarily in &ldquo;seri-
ous cases&rdquo; (causae magnae praejudicii). G&ouml;rner was correct in theory, although 
the kind of crime of which Vestring accused him can hardly be called serious. 
The court took no clear position on this, and Vestring gave the case up by walk-
ing out of the courtroom.31
</p>
<p>4.2.4 Evidence
Whether and to what extent written proofs were superior for witnesses in the 
Middle Ages is a contested affair.32 It is nevertheless clear that written proofs 
had superseded witness proofs in the ius commune civil procedure by the be-
ginning of the early modern period. The idea was encapsulated for instance, 
in the French Ordonnance de Moulins (1566): &ldquo;lettres passent t&eacute;moins.&rdquo;33 The 
principal authors of the gemeines Recht procedure adapted the same idea, and, 
</p>
<p>30 The Pastor, in a new piece of writing, said that the case had been offered to the Prosecu-
tor, who had indeed taken the case. Because he lived close to defendant, it was, however, 
probable &ndash; so the Pastor says &ndash; that he would take care of the case &ldquo;somewhat,&rdquo; taliter 
qualiter. (&ldquo;Den K&ouml;nigl. Fiscalen habe die sache und zwar vor geb&uuml;hr au&szlig;zu f&uuml;hrenaufget-
ragen, der sie zwae angenommen; allein weiln Er bey dem Contraparten wohnet, ist zu be-

<p>161The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>as Schmoeckel has demonstrated, protestant legal scholars took it even further. 
In earlier scholarship, &ldquo;public&rdquo; documents (those attested by a notary) were in 
general regarded to be more trustworthy than private ones. Protestant legal 
scholars, such as Justus Henning Boehmer, no longer made a difference, valu-
ing all written documents equally highly.34
</p>
<p>In Livonian civil procedure, written documents were highly valued but by 
no means exclusive evidence. In 1640, a dispute on the lands of the Karkus 
manor house was taken to the District Court of Pernau. At least according to 
the protocols, the plaintiffs relied exclusively on witness evidence to show 
their title.35 This may of course be due to the unclear state of land owning, 
owing to long-lasting wars, which lasted long into the Swedish period: even if 
documents existed, entire villages had been moved and swept away. This cre-
ated obvious difficulties for landowners, who wished to determine the exact 
limits of their holdings. In many civil cases, documents were hardly available 
at all, such as in cases involving ownership of serfs.36 Sometimes documents 
were produced, such as in the case of Schiltt vs. Klodt. In this case, the defen-
dant produced a contract, which nevertheless did not help him win the case.37 
Debts were mostly documented as well.38
</p>
<p>Witnesses were an important source of evidence. It is therefore understand-
able that witness ability was sometimes questioned, especially if they threat-
ened to become key witnesses for the opposing party. This was the case when 
Pastor Joachimus Keibelius charged tenant Elias Diricksen in 1641 with paying 
Andres Lobbanowsky, a Pole, to set fire to the pastoral residence of Keibelius. 
Diricksen sent a written statement (exceptionsschrifft) to the Lower Court, stat-
ing five reasons why Lobbanowsky was not a reliable witness. Lobbanowsky 
had already given his statement the day before, confirming Keibelius&rsquo;s charge. 
Diricksen, asking for dilatation, had stated that Lobbanowsky had not spoken 
the truth but had acted out of &ldquo;hatred and enmity&rdquo; (&ldquo;hass vnd feindtschafft&rdquo;) 
towards the defendant. In his brief, Diricksen now demanded that Lob-
banowsky&rsquo;s statement be discarded, because 1. he had committed perjury;

<p>4.2.5 The Process Continues: The Exchange of Briefs
The German gemeines Recht procedure &ndash; which the Livonian procedure fol-
lowed in many ways &ndash; consisted essentially of the exchange of briefs. Although 
the written nature of the procedure has traditionally been emphasized in 
literature (quod non est in actis non est in mundo),40 the picture has changed 
somewhat recently. As regards the Reichskammergericht in the sixteenth cen-
tury, Bernhard Diestelkamp has shown that although the civil procedure in 
that court was primarily based on documents and lawyers&rsquo; briefs, oral commu-
nication was more important than has been assumed in traditional research 
based on normative rather than archival sources. For one thing, lawyers read 
their briefs out loud, which prolonged the sessions up to a point where the 
court was sometimes forced to take measures to limit the time spent on read-
ing. But it was not only about reading the briefs aloud. Lawyers were often 
indulged in lively discussions as well, in which they repeated what they had 
written in the briefs. These discussions sometimes concerned legal questions, 
sometimes facts.41 Briefs were read aloud in Livonian courts as well, and some-
times discussions between the advocates were taken on record.42 On the basis 
of available sources, it is not possible to say how many unrecorded discussions 
took place.
</p>
<p>The gemeines Recht procedural terminology consisting of libellus, exception, 
replica, duplica, and litis constestatio already appears in the early years of the 
Swedish rule. The defendant contested the libellus with an exceptio, in which 
he presented his counterarguments and possibly admitted some of the claims. 
Then followed a replica, in which the plaintiff replied to the defendant&rsquo;s points 
of defence. The defendant could still meet the plaintiff &rsquo;s replica with a duplica.

<p>163The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Livonian courts show that advocates could and often did indulge in viva voce 
discussions, in addition to exchanging briefs.
</p>
<p>In the early years written briefs were exchanged in the Landgerichte, which 
points the conclusion that they were already in use there during the Polish 
period in the country courts. As shown above, the town courts did not yet use 
them during the Polish period, at least not in Dorpat Town Court, from which 
archival material survives. By the 1660s at least, the gemeines Recht procedure 
had reached the city courts as well. Thus in the Lower Town Court of Pernau in 
1662, the gemeines Recht procedural terminology was in use.43 Since advocates 
pressed the procedure in these forms in the lower city courts, it hardly sur-
prises that the upper town court protocols are full of similar terminology. So, 
in a debt case in the Pernau Town Court in 1667, when Mrs. Breetfeldt had sued  
Mr. Bruning in a debt case, Bruning &ldquo;as his exceptio&rdquo; (loco exceptionis) claimed 
that the plaintiff also owed him some money.44 The libelli, replicae, and dupli-
cae, as well as litis contestatio45 also appear in abundance, so that one can say 
that the whole civil procedure was clearly organized the gemeines Recht way. 
The more the century advanced and the more lawyer-dominated the proce-
dure became, the more clearly legal proceedings were organized this way. The 
procedural formula is, to the say the least, dominant in the Pernau Landgericht 
protocols of 1690s and 1710s.
</p>
<p>4.2.6 The Article Procedure of the Gemeines Recht and  
the Livonian Procedure
</p>
<p>Another feature of the early modern gemeines Recht civil procedure was that 
the procedure was &ldquo;articled.&rdquo; The literature calls this type of procedure &ldquo;article 
procedure&rdquo; (Artikelprozess) or &ldquo;positional procedure&rdquo; (Positionalverfahren). Af-
ter litis contestatio, the plaintiff had to present the material side of his claim in 
&ldquo;articles&rdquo; (Artikeln), or as they were sometimes called, &ldquo;positions&rdquo; (Positionen). 
They usually began with the words &ldquo;true, that&rdquo; (wahr, dass &hellip;). The answers

</p>
<p>(Responsionen) of the sued party then began with the expressions &ldquo;believes to 
be true&rdquo; (glaubt wahr) or &ldquo;believes not to be true&rdquo; (glaubt nicht wahr).46
</p>
<p>According to G&ouml;nner, in fact &ldquo;the whole theory of the gemeines procedure 
in Germany was based on the articles.&rdquo;47 The Reichskammergerichtsordnung of 
1555 (art. 3, 40, 2) stated that the parties should
</p>
<p>articul principaliter uff die geschicht oder that und nicht uff das gemeyn 
recht, es were dann, da&szlig; eyner das gemeyn reth, so au&szlig; vorarticuliter that 
fleu&szlig;t, anzeygen wolt, welches dann ime unbenommen sein soll, doch 
da&szlig; er die recht nicth &uuml;berfl&uuml;ssig und unnott&uuml;rftig allegir, damit dem 
widertheylzu disputirn und zu cavillirn nit urascah gegeben werde.48
</p>
<p>Statements of law were thus forbidden, insofar as they were known to the 
court.49 The plaintiff had to present his claims, &ldquo;legal or factual positions&rdquo; (po-
sitiones iuris or facti) in the form of articles, which the court then communi-
cated to the defendant.50
</p>
<p>The plaintiff carried the burden of proof regarding the articles that the 
defendant denied in his responsiones to the positiones. The plaintiff had to 
prepare a list of Beweisartikel, &ldquo;articles of proof&rdquo; or evindentiary articles, ac-
cording to which the witnesses were questioned. The list of Beweisartikel was 
then communicated to the defendant, who could add his own list (Fragst&uuml;cke, 
Interrogatoria) to be presented to the witnesses. In the German gemeines Recht 
the word articuli referred to the contents of the positiones and responsiones. If 
evidentiary questions were involved, the term Beweisartikel was used. Some-
times the positiones were already called articles, which were then divided into 
positional and evidentiary articles (Positionalartikeln, Probatorialartikeln). 
The article procedure was not introduced at the territorial level everywhere 
in Germany, because it was considered to be inflexible, in addition to which 
separating the factual side of cases from the legal issues proved to be a con-
tinuous bone of contention in the scholarly discussions. The article procedure 
was not used in the gemeines Recht criminal procedure, except for the fact that

<p>165The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>the questions posed to the accused in the inquisitorial procedure were set out 
much in the same way as in the article procedure.51
</p>
<p>The Kameralprozess served as a model for the gemeinrechtlich civil proce-
dure throughout Germany, even though the procedure was plagued from the 
start by great deficiencies mainly related to its slowness.52 In 1555 the plaintiff 
got the right to choose between an articulated or a summary libellus (rkgo 
1555 iii 12 &sect;8), and in 1570 it was established that the plaintiff had to present his 
articles in his libellus in order to save time. The article procedure, although it 
gave the procedure a clear backbone, however, tended to be cumbersome and 
often led to lengthy processes. Therefore the J&uuml;ngste Reichsabschied of 1654 
finally got rid of the article procedure in both lower and appeals instances, 
except for the evidentiary articles, which remained until the nineteenth cen-
tury.53 Instead of articles, the defendant now had to formulate his or her claims 
summarily and if necessary, as points (Punkten). Both claims and answers had 
to be put clearly and be kept brief.54
</p>
<p>In Livonian civil procedure articles were not used even in the first decades 
of the Swedish rule, although one could expect them to have been in use at 
that time. A reason for this may be that civil law suits in the lower courts  
of the early Swedish period often still took place without lawyers. Article pro-
cedure was also unknown to the pre-seventeenth-century Swedish civil proce-
dure, which operated much less learnedness and predominantly orally. To give 
an example from the Livonian procedure, in 1640 Christoffer Schiltt sued his 
father-in-law Wolmer Kloett at Pernau District Court for taking unlawful pos-
session of a piece of land that Schiltt held in pledge (Pfand) from Kloett. Both 
parties wrote briefs in this case, by nature not of the easiest legal kind, and 
clearly without legal counsel &ndash; and without articles.55
</p>
<p>In later decades of the Swedish rule, the article procedure was neverthe-
less often used, but only insofar as evidentiary articles are concerned. In other 
words, the questions to the witnesses, starting in the latter half of the Swed-
ish rule, are regularly formulated as articles. They were &ldquo;communicated&rdquo; to the 
defendant in order that he could produce his own questions (interrogatoria). 
Both articuli and interrogatoria were delivered to the court in written form,

</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>and the court took care of the questioning.56 Sometimes one or both of the 
question groups were divided into &ldquo;general&rdquo; and &ldquo;special&rdquo; questions, as was the 
case between the lieutenants von Linten and von Fischenbach from the year 
1690. Fischenbach&rsquo;s general interrogatoria included questions such as &ldquo;if the 
witness was not afraid that his lord might to resort to punishments should the 
witness testify against him&rdquo; and &ldquo;whether he did not like to see the plaintiff 
win the case, especially since his own guilt was at dispute here.&rdquo;57 The special 
questions, of course, went straight to the heart of the matter and, insofar as 
interrogatoria were concerned, discussed directly certain specified articuli.58
</p>
<p>To give another example, in a case of a stolen boat at the Pernau District 
Court in 1688, the plaintiff &rsquo;s advocate, prosecutor Philipp Schirm, handed to 
the Court a list of evidentiary articles (articuli probatorii), which he asked the 
Court to communicate to the other party. Schirm listed first eight witnesses 
and then fourteen questions (articuli) to be asked of each one of them.59 When 
Linten&rsquo;s advocate Schr&ouml;der received &ldquo;communication&rdquo; that the articuli had 
been drafted by Schirm, Schr&ouml;der criticized Schirm that the plaintiff &rsquo;s advo-
cate &ldquo;did not yet know what the right focal point of the legal suit&rdquo; was (&ldquo;noch 
zur zeit das rechte punctum actionis nicht wi&szlig;e&rdquo;).60 Schr&ouml;der thought that 
Schirm&rsquo;s articles did not establish clearly what the case was about; the ques-
tions were, according to Schr&ouml;der, &ldquo;impertinent.&rdquo; Many of the articles were in 
fact directed not against Schr&ouml;der&rsquo;s client but against his son or the peasant the 
plaintiff claimed had actually taken the boat. Schr&ouml;der wanted, nevertheless,

<p>to put forth counter questions (interrogatoria), and he handed in a document 
consisting of four questions to be put to the witnesses.
</p>
<p>According to Schirm, his questions were only intended to clear the case 
(&ldquo;w&auml;ren die formirte articuli zu be&szlig;erer erh&auml;upt &ndash; und erleuchterung der an-
geklagten gewaltthat hinweg nehmung des bohts gestellet worden, und k&ouml;nten 
dahero dieselbe vor inpertinentes nicht genennet warden&rdquo;). Schirm claimed that 
Linten&rsquo;s son was, at the time of the deed, under the father&rsquo;s &ldquo;potestas,&rdquo; potest&auml;t, 
and it was therefore not necessary to cite the son personally. The peasant, in 
turn, was no longer under Linten&rsquo;s dominium. Schirm asked the court to decide 
the case summarily, &ldquo;absque ulteriori Iuris strepitu&rdquo; (&ldquo;wegen des hierunter mit 
versirenden Interesse publici rescribirter ma&szlig;en absq ulteriori Iuris strepitu, &amp; 
qvidem levato velo zu verfahren submittirets zum Abscheide&rdquo;). Objecting bitterly 
to this, Schr&ouml;der stated that the plaintiff &rsquo;s claims were worth nothing if they 
were not proven (&ldquo;&hellip;so gelten dicat absq probatione nichts&hellip;.&rdquo;), and the plaintiff 
had not shown that the son was no longer in royal service (which would have 
implied that he was under his father&rsquo;s protection) or that the peasant was un-
der Linten&rsquo;s judicial power (botm&auml;ssigkeit). Schr&ouml;der went on to wonder, &ldquo;how 
far a father [had] a legal responsibility over his son, in case the son sinned, 
especially when the son does not confess himself responsible to answer in 
court.&rdquo;61 The Court decided that &ldquo;although the Royal Land Ordinance allowed 
the courts to proceed summarily in cases of little importance,&rdquo; since in this 
particular case the articuli were rather lengthy and not completely consistent 
with the libellus, the plaintiff &rsquo;s witnesses should nevertheless be heard.62
</p>
<p>The case was taken up again on 18 June of the same year (1690). The plaintiff 
had not produced any witnesses, and von Linten was therefore now ready to 
ask compensation for the expenses that the &ldquo;unnecessary process&rdquo; had caused 
him. The plaintiff, in turn, asked Linten to prove his claim, and Jakob Schr&ouml;der 
produced seven witnesses. The case was again postponed ad proximam, be-
cause the Court did not think that the case was definitely closed from the 
side of the original plaintiff, the Pastor of Audern. The compensation claim of 
Linten was thus premature.63
</p>
<p>The gemeines Recht procedure, written as it was, depended on lawyers, 
and without them there was no article procedure. Instead, the procedure was 
straightforward and uncomplicated. Thus when Christopher Veng sued the 
Stockmann heirs, because he thought their house was causing damage to his, 
</p>
<p>61 &ldquo;&hellip;wie weit ein Vater noch anleitung der Rechte f&uuml;r seinen Sohn, fal&szlig; Er wa&szlig; pecciret, al&szlig;

</p>
<p>Veng simply explained the matter to the court, and the defendants answered.64 
Courts of nobility as the district courts were in practice, the customers of the 
district courts could often afford lawyers, who then presented the witness 
hearing in accusatorial criminal cases in an articled framework.
</p>
<p>Evidentiary articles were often used in accusatorial criminal cases as well. 
The accusing party delivered the court a list of witness, and questions to be 
asked, nomina testium cum articulis.65 For instance, in an accusatorial case 
of the Small Guild vs. Clement Wigandt at the Pernau Council in 1660, the 
plaintiffs handed in &ldquo;positional articles,&rdquo; in which a witness was named.66 The 
situation at the end of the seventeenth century had not altered significantly.  
Witness hearings were still presented in the form of articuli probatoriales 
and the questions of the accused in interrogatoria.67 Even this form of article 
procedure seems to have disappeared in Livonia by the 1690s. Thus, advocate  
Johann Christoff Beneck&rsquo;s long libellus for the District Court of Pernau in 1690 
was followed not by the traditional articulii but instead by puncta, a list of 34 
detailed questions intended to be asked of one particular witness to the case.68

<p>4.2.7 The Final Decision (Urteil)
The final court decision was called Urteil (several spellings occur in the sourc-
es: Urtheil, Urtheill, Urthell), and sometimes in the lawyers&rsquo; Latinised briefs, 
sententia definitiva. The decision begins with the names of the parties and con-
tinues by identifying the type of case (for instance, in puncto debiti ex obliga-
tione). Then the court lists the evidence, according to which the case has been 
decided.69 A ratio decidendi then follows, in which the main arguments for the

<p>plaintiff and for the counter party are weighed against each other, albeit usu-
ally briefly and often stating only the arguments pro the decision.70
</p>
<p>A sentence typically ends in a conclusion, in which the court takes a stand 
on the plaintiff &rsquo;s claims. In the example case here, the court has accepted 
the claim as such, with the addition of six percent in interest, but allowing 
the  payment in two parts. As is usual, the loser is ordered to pay the litiga-
tion  expenses.71 Sometimes, as in the example case, there is an instruction to 
the successful plaintiff to turn to the governor-general for the execution of the 
sentence.72 An abbreviation &ldquo;v.r.w.&rdquo; for &ldquo;Vor Rechts wegen&rdquo; (&ldquo;by law,&rdquo; de jure) is 
added customarily at the very end.73
</p>
<p>After the actual decision, a remark on the appeal was often added. In the 
example, the defendant&rsquo;s lawyer reserved the right to deliberate on the pos-
sible appeal.74 The protocols contained no signatures, but the copies given to 
the parties were signed and sealed.75

<p>4.2.8 Slowness and Inefficiency of the Civil Procedure: Livonian Procedure 
in European Comparison
</p>
<p>Early modern civil procedure was often slow. The Reichskammergericht is the 
prime example. Its slowness culminated in the famous quote from the one-
time junior judge at the Court, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749&ndash;1832):  
&ldquo;[A] monstrous chaos of papers had accumulated and was increasing from 
year to year, since the seventeen assessors were insufficient even for the dis-
patch of current business. Twenty thousand lawsuits had accumulated; sixty

<p>could be settled every year, and double that number were brought forward.&rdquo;76 
Modern research shows that Goethe was not exaggerating. As for the sixteenth 
century, it was not rare that it took up to 30 years for the Court to give its final 
verdict. However, as Manfred H&ouml;rner stresses, all the delays were hardly due to 
the working methods of the Court but resulted at least partly from the different 
functions that the parties set for litigation.77 Anja Amend-Traut observes that 
introducing a lawsuit at the Imperial Chamber Court could sometimes serve 
the strategic interests of the plaintiff by redefining the negotiating positions or 
endangering the reputation of the defendant.78 Obtaining a verdict was only 
one of the goals. For instance, the Kameralprozess offered the defendant sev-
eral possibilities of stalling the procedure for years. In many cases no verdict 
was given because the cases were either formally settled or they were settled 
extra-judicially, so that the case just seemed to fade away in the records.
</p>
<p>Slow justice was by no means a prerogative of German law. Henry Kagan 
has shown that lawsuits in early modern Castilian courts frequently lasted 
for years. Procedural rules in Castile were extremely complex, allowing the 
litigants to stall the proceedings with the help of widespread appeals, lawsuits 
against the judges (recusaci&oacute;n), or by obtaining suspension orders (c&eacute;dula de 
recusaci&oacute;n) from the Crown. Judges had little means of punishing parties wil-
fully delaying procedures. Furthermore, Kagan notes that frequent illnesses 
and deaths of the judges and parties to the lawsuits, as well as poor weather 
conditions, played a role in the delays of justice.79 Similarly, in the sixteenth-
century English Court of Chancery most cases lasted from two to five years,

</p>
<p>and a large number of them were never brought to conclusion but ended with 
an interlocutory decision.80
</p>
<p>The ius commune civil procedure was thus not only accused of being slow, 
but was accused of being inefficient. It also seemed inefficient, because often, 
civil cases remained undecided. For instance, in the Imperial Chamber Court 
(Reichskammergericht) fewer than one fourth of the cases were decided by a 
court decision (Urteil).81 The obvious reason for this is that the parties used 
courts of law not only to obtain formal decisions, but also as strategic weap-
ons. A pending court case could be used as a tool to extract a payment from 
the other party or to make them submit to other demands. This is probably 
part of the reason why parties sometimes tolerated the long duration of the 
procedure as well. The function of the court case was clearly different to what 
it is today.
</p>
<p>The Livonian courts could not, at least usually, be accused of slowness. The 
protocols of 1688&ndash;1690 of the Pernau District Court offer some perspective on 
the duration of the cases. In those years, 14 civil cases were tried at the Court.82 
Six cases were definitively decided, and the others were postponed, usually 
because of defendant&rsquo;s absence.83
</p>
<p>Of the six cases decided definitely, two were decided during the same session 
in which they were initiated.84 The others were tried three,85 four,86 or five87 
times. The trials followed each other, however, in a rather short sequence. The

</p>
<p>case which took the longest was that of Ebert Frohn vs. Dorothea Barnowitz et al.  
(in puncto debiti ex cessione), in which the Court took one year (June 1688 &ndash; 
June 1689) from the initiation to the decision. In one of the cases which were 
not decided definitively,88 the Court nevertheless handled the case nine times 
before it disappeared from the files in February 1690. This shows that the Court 
itself was prepared to proceed with the cases relatively swiftly.
</p>
<p>However, it often happened that civil cases never came to the court after 
they were first introduced there. This seems to have been the case when Peter 
Petersen sued Johann von Harten and his wife Brigitta Elisabeth von Sahlfeld 
for an unpaid debt. The trial started on 6 March 1688, without the defendants.89 
The case did not return to the docket, at least not in the same year, probably 
because it was settled out of court. One cannot help concluding that in many 
situations, the lower court was only used as an instrument to pressurize the 
defendant into action. In many other cases, other means were probably used 
towards the same end, and they never came to court at all. From the plaintiff &rsquo;s 
point of view, even though the Court was rather quick, it must have appeared 
to be toothless, incapable as it was of effectively avoiding the contumacy of 
defendants. The Court was thus not slow, but inefficient, because it was lacking 
the means of enforcing whatever authority it had on its subjects.
</p>
<p>4.3 The Criminal Procedure in the Lower Courts
</p>
<p>4.3.1 European Criminal Procedure in the Middle Ages and  
the Early Modern Period
</p>
<p>Before going into the Livonian criminal procedure such as it figures in the stat-
utes and court practice, in order to build a context, it would be worthwhile to 
take a look at the common European criminal procedure at the beginning of 
the seventeenth century, the time of the Swedish conquest.
</p>
<p>From the time of Pope Alexander iii (r. 1159&ndash;1181), inquisitorial procedure 
was gradually introduced as a regular part of canon law of crimes, starting with 
visitations and disciplinary procedures against cleric. The scientific consensus 
on the formation of the inquisitorial procedure is as follows. The problem with 
the traditional procedures had been that they had entirely dependent on the 
appearance of private accusers. For obvious reasons, private accusers were not 
always available. Should the defendant not be found guilty, the accuser ran the

</p>
<p>risk of facing the same punishment to which the defendant would have been 
condemned if he had been convicted. In practice the punishments in these 
cases tended to be more lenient, but were nevertheless substantial, so that the 
accuser had to be certain of his case. Around the time of Pope Alexander iii, 
in the 1150s and 1160s, the early modern fama procedure evolved into a proce-
dure in which the church officials began to investigate actively into the alleged 
misbehaviour of clergymen. Clerical concubinage was one of the most burn-
ing practical problem calling for a disciplinary solution. A series of decretals 
moulded the inquisitorial procedure into its classical shape, confirmed in the 
Fourth Lateran Council in 1215.90
</p>
<p>Since its birth in the twelfth century, the European criminal procedure had 
been divided into the inquisitorial and the accusatorial, the &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; 
and the &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; procedure.91 Starting in the thirteenth century, the accusa-
torial and inquisitorial modes of criminal procedure were adopted in the secu-
lar legal orders as well. As political power was centralised in the early modern 
age, judicial apparatus began to intervene more often and more effectively in 
petty crime. As a result, the scope of criminal law widened.92
</p>
<p>In the leading early modern Italian and German scholarly presentations, 
the accusatorial procedure was still presented as the basic model of criminal 
procedure, and in principle it remained so until the breakdown of the ancient

<p>regime of criminal law in the nineteenth century. The accusatorial procedure 
remained at the statutory level as well. The criminal law of the Holy German 
Empire, Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (ccc) of 1534, is worth focusing upon 
here, because it was followed in Livonia as well. The ccc presented the accusa-
torial procedure (der Anklageprozess) as the first, ordinary mode of procedure. 
This was despite the fact that the ccc did everything it could to make the ac-
cusatorial procedure as unattractive as possible in the eyes of the potential 
&ldquo;users&rdquo; &ndash; exactly as its predecessors, the Wormser Reformation (1498) and Con-
stitutio Bambergensis (1507), had already done. Article 12 of ccc ordered the 
plaintiff to place a surety (B&uuml;rgen) should the claim not succeed. If the plain-
tiff was unable to provide for the guarantee, he or she was taken into custody. 
According to Eberhardt Schmidt, all criminal proceedings began accusatori-
ally. Should the plaintiff &rsquo;s evidence prove to be unsatisfactory, the procedure 
did not end but was instead continued inquisitorially. The court could then 
attempt to collect the necessary evidence with the help of judicial torture ex 
officio.93 Wolfgang Sellert and Hinrich R&uuml;ping have, however, emphasised that 
the plaintiff by no means lost control of the case after the initiation phase. It 
still remained the plaintiff &rsquo;s task to provide the evidence. If the accused would 
not confess, the plaintiff could ask the court to inflict torture on the suspect.94
</p>
<p>As Massimo Meccarelli has shown, the judicial arbitrium in the ius com-
mune procedure was extremely flexible, and judges were allowed to exercise 
a wide discretion as to the mode of procedure which they wished to pursue. 
The mode of procedure (iter) was frequently changed from inquisitorial to ac-
cusatorial, or vice versa, during the investigation of a single case. Even though 
a case could start as accusatorial or denunciatory, it could later be taken over 
by the court and thus change into an inquisitorial one. The court could assume 
active charge of the proceedings and even apply judicial torture if deemed 
necessary.95

<p>175The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Despite the theoretical subsidiarity of the inquisitorial procedure in relation 
to the accusatorial procedure,96 the numerous exceptions to the main rule in 
practice rendered it more and more obsolete. Historians of criminal law have 
thus shown the text-book picture to be misrepresentative of the reality: at least 
at the beginning of the sixteenth century, it is said, the inquisitorial procedure 
had taken over from the accusatorial one in most parts of Europe. In his clas-
sic work on the history of French criminal procedure (Histoire de la proc&eacute;dure 
criminelle), Adh&eacute;mar Esmein claimed that after the fourteenth century the ac-
cusatorial procedure was &ldquo;a remnant of the past,&rdquo; rarely used. It was gradually 
replaced by the denunciatory procedure, and the Ordonnance of 1670 was then 
wholly dominated by the inquisitorial procedure.97 The continued prevalence 
of the accusatorial procedure fundamentally distinguished Livonia from most 
areas in the heart of Europe, where most early modern states vigorously sought 
to extend their powers in criminal procedure. The inquisitorial procedure was 
an important instrument that the developing states used to gain effective con-
trol over their territories. A logical consequence of the extension of inquisitorial 
procedure was that the use of accusatorial procedure was limited.98 According 
to Eberhardt Schmidt, in Germany, early modern criminal law was characterized 
by the inquisitorial procedure pushing accusatorial procedure out of its way, al-
though the accusatorial procedure never completely lost its importance.99
</p>
<p>Although empirical studies on judicial practice are still largely lacking, the 
picture has become more nuanced than before. Focusing on late medieval 
France, Esther Cohen emphasises that &ldquo;whatever or whenever the shift [from 
the accusatorial to the inquisitorial procedure] began, it was neither unidirec-
tional nor overall.&rdquo; It was a slow process with many reversals, and &ldquo;&hellip; one which 
took place in different areas at different times.&rdquo;100 Nevertheless, not even Co-
hen contends that the inquisitorial procedure would not finally &ndash; at least by 
the seventeenth century &ndash; have completely taken over from the accusatorial 
procedure. Karl H&auml;rter has shown that the accusatorial procedure vanished in

<p>some parts of Kurmainz probably soon after the introduction of Carolina and 
at the latest by the late sixteenth century.101 In canon law, inquisitorial proce-
dure had become the rule by the sixteenth century, and local customs could 
also favour the inquisitorial procedure at the cost of the accusatorial one. How-
ever, European regions vary a lot in this respect.
</p>
<p>Relying on statutory sources, Schmidt also remarked that the accusatorial 
procedure never completely lost its importance in Germany.102 In several Ger-
man territories the accusatorial procedure retained its primary position long 
into the eighteenth century.103 In many territories, the inquisitorial procedure 
evolved into a &ldquo;mixed procedure&rdquo; (prozessuelle Mischform), in which the po-
sition of the official prosecutor (Fiskal) became important. In East Prussian 
processum mixtum, for instance, the Fiskal acted as the prosecutor in an ac-
cusatorial procedure, but could rely on a previous inquisitorial inquisition. 
The procedure was thus started with an inquisition, after which the procedure 
turned accusatorial with the Fiskal taking over. Judicial torture could also be 
used, in which case the inquisitorial features again took over.104 The East Prus-
sian example goes to show how public interest could be taken care of by the 
Fiskalat even in a system with strong accusatorial traits.105 For instance, even 
though the inquisitorial features dominated the peinlich procedure of Kur-
sachsen from the late fifteenth century onwards, elements of ancient oath pro-
cedure did not vanish for a long time.106
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the takeover of the inquisitorial procedure is clearly not the 
whole picture of the European development. It is the picture of the European 
heartland, which fulfilled two important criteria. First, the regions where in-
quisitorial procedure overtook the accusatorial one in the early modern pe-
riod were those where the modern state, in the centralised and bureaucratised 
meaning of the word, also developed. Second, the inquisitorial mode of crimi-
nal proceedings could not develop fully without an effective corps of trained

<p>legal professionals staffing the courts. The core areas of Germany, France, Italy, 
and Spain fulfilled both these criteria more or less successfully.107
</p>
<p>The observations on previous research on the demise of accusatorial pro-
cedure have been made primarily on the basis of material from the heartlands 
of Europe, and it is questionable to what extent they allow for European-wide 
generalisations. The studies of Cohen and H&auml;rter have already questioned the 
thesis of the complete disappearance of accusatorial procedure. More regional 
studies on legal practice are needed, however, to see how well the thesis of the 
vanishing accusatorial principle holds for more peripheral areas. One of aims 
of this study is to provide one such study. As will be shown, the accusatorial 
procedure remained pivotally important in seventeenth-century Livonia (as 
it did in contemporary Sweden as well), and its relation to the inquisitorial 
procedure was far more complicated than one of the procedural modes simply 
giving way to the other. As Schmidt&rsquo;s example on the East Prussian procedure 
shows, it was not only a question of whether the system was ruled by the in-
quisitorial or accusatorial principle. When estimating how active the state was 
in crime control, we need more than two alternatives.
</p>
<p>4.3.2 The Accusatorial Procedure in Livonia
According to vlgo of 1632 Art. xxvi, all criminal cases other than those 
punishable by death and in which a nobleman was accused were to be dealt  
with accusatorially. Criminal procedure depended on the social standing of 
the accused, and on the practical possibility that the crown would have to im-
plement tough measures on criminality.
</p>
<p>The Livonian legislation, which remained largely the same throughout the 
Swedish period, does not get one very far in trying to understand the practice 
of Livonian criminal procedure. Livonian legal practice continued to make fre-
quent use of the accusatorial procedure throughout the Swedish period, but 
the scope of the accusatorial procedure changed in time. Accusatorial proce-
dure was first used against all social classes, but towards the end of the century 
it was increasingly restricted to noblemen as it was supposed to be according 
to the vlgo. At the same time, inquisitorial procedure replaced the accusato-
rial in serious criminal cases involving peasants.
</p>
<p>In 1640, for instance, all criminal cases were accusatorial in the sense that 
a private person initiated them. Relatives of the deceased took the homicide 
cases to court, and in the infanticide case it was the steward of the manor in 
which the accused woman served that took the initiative. The same private

<p/>

</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>initiators also provided witnesses. Thus in the case of Curwitz vs. T&ouml;nni&szlig; and 
Han&szlig; Kennecken, the Curwitz brothers asked the Pernau District Court to 
hear two witnesses in a homicide case. The Court itself was also active in this 
case: the case was postponed for a few days in order to hear two other wit-
nesses, because the accused brothers had &ldquo;in this severe criminal case so often 
referred&rdquo; to them.108 In the third case the Court did not seem active, finally 
convicting the accused Hans Wardi to a fine, instead of a death punishment, 
because there was not enough evidence was for the animo occidendi, and be-
cause Wardi had settled with the relatives of Lellepe Peet, the victim. The High 
Court thought otherwise when the case was subjected to its revision, ordering 
the Lower Court to hear more witnesses.109
</p>
<p>The procedure in accusatorial cases against noblemen was, to a large extent, 
written, and thus in this respect no different to ordinary civil cases. Thus when 
Heinrich von Dam accused Joachim Schumacher of sticking him with a knife 
(injuria realium) in the Lower Town of Pernau in 1662, von Dam&rsquo;s advocate  
Johann Ficken handed the charges to the Court in writing (libellus). Schumacher,  
present at court, replied at once that the case had not taken place at all in the 
way that it was stated in the written charge, but instead he &ldquo;had had to act 
in self-defence.&rdquo; The Court, however, ordered Schumacher to reply in writing 
the next day. On the next day the accused turned up in court again and stated 
that he had not been able to produce the written reply because he was getting 
ready to travel. Instead, he asked whether the accusing party should also ap-
pear in person. Von Dam&rsquo;s advocate did not consent to this, because his client 
was sick.110
</p>
<p>Once a case had reached the court, the criminal procedure was thus flex-
ible enough to be changed to a more inquisitorial mode, if the court felt it was 
necessary to take the initiative in its own hands. Choosing the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; mode 
of procedure was not a matter of principle, and no fixed dividing line existed 
between the accusatorial and procedural modes.111
</p>
<p>Inquisitorial procedure would have opened the possibility of bringing no-
blemen to court by force. This, however, was almost unthinkable in Livonia.

accusatorial and inquisitorial procedure.</p>

<p>179The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Manorial lords, as we have seen, could well be put in charge of ensuring that 
their peasants be held responsible for serious crimes in the district courts. 
However, this could happen only accusatorially, because the courts were lack-
ing the authority to force noblemen into court against their will. The preva-
lence of accusatorial procedure was a practical necessity, and it retained its 
position &ndash; with some important exceptions &ndash; until the end of the Swedish pe-
riod. These exceptions will be discussed later (see 4.6).
</p>
<p>Because all criminal cases were accusatorial in 1640, severe criminal cases 
also included as defendants members of all estates and social classes. Milder vi-
olence between individuals rarely interested the prosecutors even at the end of 
the period, and the victims had to take such cases to court themselves. Philipp 
Schmidt, a burgher from Fellin, charged Michell, a smith&rsquo;s son, with attacking 
him on Christmas Day. Michell with his friends had started calling Schmidt 
names, and the situation had then escalated to the point where Michell bat-
tered Schmidt severely by hitting him on the head and breaking one of his 
ribs.112 Cornet David Remling, assisted by advocate Johann Christoph Beneck, 
accused the steward of Moysekyla manor of violent behaviour at the Pernau 
Lower Court in 1688.113 For the prosecutors, these cases were not the centre 
of attention. Other classic areas of criminal law, such as theft, also depended 
completely on the victim&rsquo;s activity. For instance, in 1688 Lieutenant Colonel 
Brackell accused Andres Hoch, a soldier, of stealing a horse at the funeral of 
Brackell&rsquo;s daughter.114 So also Steward Christian Winkelmann of Aydenhof 
Manor brought charges against the peasant Leuco Thomas for disloyalty and 
theft (&ldquo;in puncto beschuldigter Untreu und Dieberey&rdquo;) in the same assizes.
</p>
<p>Many of the accusatorial cases involved slander: out the 26 cases in 1688, 10 
were such accusations. Slander cases, if proven, resulted in criminal punish-
ment, usually fines, but sometimes prison was also used. Anna K&uuml;hn, for in-
stance, was condemned in 1688 to 14 days of bread and water for grave slander 
(injuria atrocissimarum).115
</p>
<p>Slander cases throughout the period remained completely out of the public 
prosecutor&rsquo;s sphere of action.116 Instead, the procedure depended entirely on 
the injured party&rsquo;s activity. In 1640, Christoffer Schiltt accused Berent Eggert

</p>
<p>of slandering him and his family at his home, and of attacking his wife and his 
children.117
</p>
<p>In the 1688, the criminal procedure had clearly become status-based. Seri-
ous crimes with peasants as defendants were handled almost exclusively in in-
quisitorial procedure. In contrast, most of the accusatorial cases had burghers 
(from small towns belonging to a district court&rsquo;s jurisdiction such as Fellin), 
free subjects of the manors (such as blacksmiths), or sometime noblemen as 
defendants.
</p>
<p>The strong position of the accusatorial procedure also shows in the fact that 
purgatory oath continued in frequent use from the Polish period to the end of 
the Swedish period. The oath suited the system well, where the outcome of the 
case was firmly in the hands of the parties and the public authorities &ndash; both the 
court and the prosecutor &ndash; assumed a more limited role. To give an example, 
the iuramentum corporalis was used in the above-mentioned case when Pas-
tor Joachimus Keibelius in 1641 charged the tenant Elias Diricksen with paying 
Andres Lobbanowsky to commit arson. Lobbanowsky testified in favour of the 
plaintiff, but the defendant questioned the witness&rsquo;s reliability, because he was 
a heretic and &ndash; so Diricksen claimed &ndash; his enemy. The District Court of Pernau 
ordered Diricksen to take a purgatory oath, which was to take place a week 
later. Should Diricksen not appear, he would have to pay 100 thalers.118
</p>
<p>The procedure in the accusatorial cases was often informal, and sometimes 
the court&rsquo;s control was rather vague. A good example is a witchcraft case, in 
which Lorens Erichson accused a man called Hanss. The accused Hanss at first 
refused to confess, until he was &ndash; according to the protocol &ndash; &ldquo;persuaded by the 
witnesses that he should confess.&rdquo; As a result, Hanss was convicted.119
</p>
<p>As has been stressed above, it was not always clear-cut whether a case was 
handled accusatorially or inquisitorially. The way the District Court of Pernau 
handled the case of four peasants accused of the murder of a Finnish soldier 
fits well with the picture of the ius commune criminal procedure as a flexible 
procedure. The case against Zeamick Ewert, Pick Peter, Sava Otti, and Lutzin 
Bertel was brought to the Court by the &ldquo;denouncement&rdquo; (delatio) of Wilibalt 
von Bergen, a nobleman, and the &ldquo;charge&rdquo; (Anklage) of wife of the murdered 
soldier. Technically, the case was thus a mixture of an accusatorial case and 
a denunciatory one. Although torture was not applied in this case, the court

<p>otherwise  did everything it could to solve the case, where von Bergen and the 
victim&rsquo;s wife did not figure actively in the proceedings after they had brought 
the case to court. The Court&rsquo;s primary concern was, of course, to have the 
accused confess. This was not easy, and one of the accused, Zeamick Ewert, 
seemed particularly hardheaded, claiming that Pick Peter and Lutzin Bertel 
had been the killers. The other three confessed more easily, to most of the 
charges. The Court took advantage of this by using the interrogatory technique 
of &ldquo;confrontation&rdquo; (confrontatio), which meant interrogating the suspects si-
multaneously. This proved successful, and after hearing Pick Peter and Lutzin 
Bertel testify against him, Zeamick Ewert&rsquo;s resistance broke down and he con-
fessed as well.
</p>
<p>4.3.3 Accusatorial Procedure with Prosecutor (Staatsanklageprozess)
Three different modes of criminal procedure can be discerned in the Livonian 
legal practice. Besides an accusatorial and inquisitorial procedure, a third one 
gained increasing ground as the century advanced: an accusatorial procedure 
with a public prosecutor as the plaintiff. Although this form of procedure was 
in theory no different to other kinds of accusatorial procedure, it was different 
in practice. The active prosecutor represented an active state, keen on taking 
control of certain kinds of crimes.
</p>
<p>Prosecutors are the least researched party in the continental criminal proce-
dure. The reason is quite obvious: in the pure inquisitorial procedure the role 
of the prosecutor was limited. In Germany, the main reference point for Swe-
den and Livland, prosecutors (Fiskal) in charge of supervising the territorial 
princes&rsquo; fiscal interests were known from the fourteenth century onwards.120 
Fiscal cases were a typical branch of police law,121 and the development of pub-
lic prosecution was typically linked to the growth of police law. The modern of-
ficial prosecutor (Staatsanwalt) did not appear before the unification, in 1877.
</p>
<p>The Swedish experience was not dramatically different. Public prosecution 
developed in Sweden in the seventeenth century, which was not only the pe-
riod of the hierarchisation and professionalisation of the Swedish judiciary, 
but that of police law as well. At the beginning of the century, the Swedish l&auml;ns-
m&auml;n and other civil servants, who later took over the prosecution, were mainly 
responsible for activities other than prosecution. The l&auml;nsman&rsquo;s primary task

<p>was the transportation of crown officials, such as judges. The so-called land 
fiscals (landfiskaler) were given over the responsibility of watching over the 
fiscal interests of the crown in the mid-1500s.122
</p>
<p>The Livonian prosecutors were a German-influenced institution. In the Li-
vonian judiciary of the Swedish period, there were public prosecutors in both 
the lower courts (Unter &ndash; or Kreisfiskal; lower or district prosecutors) and the 
High Court (Oberfiskal), in which it was their duty to supervise the crown inter-
ests. The high court prosecutor also supervised the church administration. The 
law on the high court prosecutor (Oberfiscals-Instruktion) was given in 1630, 
and in the same law (&sect;15) the office of the district prosecutor (Kreisfiscal) was 
also mentioned. However, the law on district prosecutors (Kreisfiscalsinstruc-
tion) was only given two years later, in 1632. Previous scholarship has assumed 
that no hierarchical relationship existed between the two prosecutorial offices, 
and this study affirms this. Each had their tasks, which rarely overlapped.123
</p>
<p>During the nineteenth century, procedural reforms were among the most 
discussed legal problems in Baltic Provinces of the Russian Empire.124 As with 
most of the contemporary legal problems during the zenith of the Historical 
School, procedural questions were also approached historically. With his book 
On the History of Criminal Procedure in Livonia (Zur Geschichte des Criminal-
prozesses in Livland) in 1849, Woldemar von Bock joined in a discussion on the 
nature and importance of different procedural modes. A staunch critic of the 
inquisitorial procedure in his own time, von Bock sought to show with the help 
of historical material that the use of inquisitorial procedure could not be based 
on old Swedish laws.125
</p>
<p>Von Bock criticized the picture of Livonian criminal law history that Gustav 
Johann von Buddenbrock had given in the editorial notes to his collection of old 
Livonian legislation, a few decades before von Bock&rsquo;s time.126 Von Bock blamed

miae: Wankijf, 1672), 68: &ldquo;Inquisitores hi hodie Fiscales nominari coeperunt.&rdquo; All in all,  
however, the history of the Swedish prosecution is a poorly researched area. We have no 
full-length studies or even high quality articles discussing such activities and the position 
of prosecution in the early modern period.

<p>183The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era

</p>
<p>von Buddenbrock and von Himmelstierna for overemphasizing the importance 
of the inquisitorial procedure during the Ordenszeit and downplaying it in the 
period of the &ldquo;Polish barbarians.&rdquo; Von Bock was convinced that accusatorial pro-
cedure had dominated before the Polish rule and that inquisitorial procedure 
&ndash; that &ldquo;spiritual illness&rdquo; &ndash; had gained the upper hand towards the late sixteenth 
century, especially after the promulgation of the Ordinatio Livoniae by King Si-
gismund iii of Poland in 1589. The Ordinatio established the Prussian criminal 
procedure (&ldquo;ordo judiciorum, qui in Prussia retinetur&rdquo;) in Livonia as well, and the 
Prussian procedure was inquisitorial. Whereas the Poles represented the evil and 
the inquisitorial procedure, the Swedes brought with them progress and the ac-
cusatorial procedure. Von Bock believed that the inquisitorial procedure played 
no role in Swedish early seventeenth-century criminal procedure. The Execu-
tionsverordnung of 1669, von Bock believed, finally made accusatorial procedure 
driven by the prosecutor (Staatsanklageprozess) the exclusive form of criminal 
procedure in Livonia.127
</p>
<p>Through quite extensive case material, Bock shows that the Pernau District 
Court in 1678&ndash;1704 used, indeed, only accusatorial procedure with a prosecu-
tor. During the last years of Swedish rule and according to Bock, contrary to 
the law, accusatorial procedure emerged again besides Staatsanklageprozess 
and in some years was even dominant. Accusatorial procedure was not, claims 
Bock, a noble prerogative, but was used on the accused of bourgeois and even 
peasant origin.128
</p>
<p>Bock&rsquo;s findings, however, met with sharp criticism. The leading figure of 
nineteenth-century Livonian legal history, Friedrich Georg von Bunge, wrote in 
a review on Bock&rsquo;s book that his results were not representative because they 
were based on a relatively small amount of case material. According to Bunge 
(and Schwarz), inquisitorial procedure had been taken to be used as part of the 
canonical procedure against Ordensbr&uuml;der. This is probably true, because in-
quisitorial procedure had by the fourteenth century taken over the ecclesiasti-
cal criminal procedure. Bunge also claims that the canon law exerted influence 
on secular criminal law, which by the end of the sixteenth century had turned 
overwhelmingly inquisitorial, the Polish period creating even more favourable 
circumstances for this kind of a development. This is a good guess, but it is 
not supported by archival sources.129 If it had been in use, which is possible, 
inquisitorial procedure seems to have disappeared before the Swedes came.

<p>J.C. Schwartz joined in with Bunge&rsquo;s criticism. Like Bunge and contrary to 
von Bock, Schwartz argued that inquisitorial procedure had at least some in-
fluence on the Swedish legal procedure at the time of the Livonian conquest. 
Schwartz emphasizes, however, that the procedural legislation (lgo, vlgo, 
hgo), which the Swedes issued for Livonia, did not decisively rule which of the 
procedural modes was to prevail. The only exception was that criminal cases 
against noblemen were always accusatorial, with the exception of some excep-
tional crimes (hochpeinliche Sachen). As for the cases against representatives 
of other estates, the statutes did not say anything definite.130 The Execution 
Order of 1669, then, only spoke of the prosecutorial activity in police cases 
(Policey) not in criminal cases in general, as von Bock believed.131
</p>
<p>Schwartz had gone through 400 cases referred from the lower courts to the 
Dorpat High Court in 1630&ndash;1710. His main conclusion was that the accusatorial 
procedure by the prosecutor in fact &ldquo;never played a significant role in the Li-
vonian criminal procedure.&rdquo;132 Instead, the inquisitorial procedure would have 
continued to strengthen throughout the Swedish period. If the prosecutors 
were at all important, their significance showed in the strengthening of the 
inquisitorial procedure and in ensuring its right course.133
</p>
<p>There is, however, a methodological problem in Schwartz&rsquo;s argument. He 
looked only at cases that had reached the Dorpat High Court, in other words 
cases that had been subject to automatic referral or leuteration. These were, as 
was explained above, the most serious criminal cases. The bulk of the prosecu-
torial activity did not, however, deal with these cases but instead with minor 
crimes, which nevertheless were important from the point of view of creating 
and upholding the state&rsquo;s authority. Furthermore, von Bock was correct in as-
serting that prosecutorial activity increased during the seventeenth century. 
The prosecutorial activity increased precisely in the areas in which it could 
grow against the least amount of obstacles: minor crimes against the crown 
and the inquisitorial cases against peasants. Instead, prosecutors had much 
more difficulty taking a firm grip of noble perpetrators, although a clear at-
tempt was made in the 1680s.
</p>
<p>It was up to the prosecutors to watch over the lawfulness of judicial admin-
istration and the behaviour of the parties in courts. The high court prosecutor

<p>ensured that fines were actually paid and other punishments carried out. Fur-
thermore, the high court prosecutor was to make sure that the lower court 
sent their decisions to the High Court each year in due time. The high court 
prosecutor was also entrusted with the supervision of ecclesiastical adminis-
tration.134 The close links of the Livonian prosecutorial offices with police law 
show in the way the prosecutorial tasks were defined as not only supervising 
the abiding of the law in general. Instead, the prosecutor was to ensure espe-
cially the &ldquo;fulfilment of royal ordinances, decrees, and mandates&rdquo; (&ldquo;der Erf&uuml;l-
lung der k&ouml;niglichen Verordnungen, Decrete, Mandate&rdquo;);135 that is, typically the 
kinds of statutes likely to include police law.136
</p>
<p>Livonian lower prosecutors became much more interested in rooting out 
two types of crimes, sexual ones and those reflecting disrespect toward state 
authority. The court itself, by way of the inquisitorial procedure, took charge of 
violent crimes &ndash; although some of the prosecutorial cases involved violence as 
well. The prosecutor-driven cases were always accusatorial.
</p>
<p>Defendants often failed to appear in the early modern courts.137 This was 
also the situation during the Swedish rule in Livonia. For instance, when the 
Pernau Lower Court held assizes at the Fellin Castle in 1641, four civil cases 
involved contumacy.138 Towards the end of the Swedish era, contumacy cases 
became one of the most important activities of the advocatus fisci.139 In clear 
civil cases, where written evidence was available, contumacy was a lesser prob-
lem. If the plaintiff could produce an iou, the absent defendant normally lost 
the case.140
</p>
<p>An example of sexual crimes is the case which Prosecutor Phillipp Schirm 
brought against Jochim Schneck, the weaver, and a woman (&ldquo;Weibst&uuml;ck&rdquo;) called 
Mari, charged with adultery and fornication. Schirm motivated the criminal

<p>charge with the threat of divine punishment.141 Prosecutor Schirm142 also 
charged Captain Ebert Engelhardt and his maid Hillpig Roop with fornica-
tion (scortatio) at the Pernau Lower Court in 1690. Both confessed and were 
sentenced to a fine of 40 thalers.143 Out of the 28 cases of accusatorial activity 
in 1688 at Pernau Lower Court, 14 were sexual crimes.
</p>
<p>Maintaining public order had thus, by the late seventeenth century, become 
of great concern for the prosecutors.144 The wish to maintain public order was 
typical for the prosecutorial cases, as when Prosecutor Schirm raised charges 
against soldier Jacob Bremer for robbery (rapina ex violentiarum). The alleged 
crime had taken place on a highway and was particularly gross. Schirm noted 
that &ldquo;especially this kind of open street violence&rdquo; should be curbed and &ldquo;the 
highway in the future be secured.&rdquo;145 Bremer, represented by Rittmeister Vit-
tinghoff, answered in writing. Thus in the case of Philipp Schirm, the prosecu-
tor, vs. Gustav Nohthelffer (burgher from Fellin), Schirm accused Nohthelffer 
of entering the burgher Ebert Doben&rsquo;s house and of attacking the company 
saddler Zyriatus Iben. According to the charges, Nohthelffer had used a sable 
to wound Iben&rsquo;s hand. Interestingly, Schirm motivates the charge with criminal 
policy: &ldquo;&hellip;should violent crimes such as this go unpunished, no-one would be 
able to live in peace in their houses and under their roofs, and despite of the 
fact that domestic peace should be the most protected, Mr. Gustav Nohthelffer 
gave little thought to this &hellip;&rdquo;146 The victims (Doben and Iben) did not figure as 
parties to the law suit, but the prosecutor prosecuted nevertheless. In its inter-
locutory sentence, the court obliged the prosecutor in summoning the alleged 
victims to the court as witnesses.147

<p>187The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>In the case of Rittmeister Schlippenbach vs. Lieutenant Wachtell, Schirm 
asked for continuation because even though Schlippenbach had &ldquo;passed a case 
involving atrocissimi iniuria&rdquo; to him, the prosecutor had not had time to gather 
&ldquo;enough information&rdquo; on the case.148 It seems thus anyway to have been clear 
to the contemporaries that it was one of the prosecutor&rsquo;s tasks to bring charges 
as far as least some classes of serious crimes were concerned. In this case the 
discussion makes it clear that the term atrocissimi iniuria referred to a duel. 
The Court of Pernau decided to absolve Wachtell, stating however that &ldquo;should 
the plaintiff not wish to drop the case completely, it is his responsibility to 
bring it to the next court session de novo.&rdquo; Perhaps too much attention should 
not be paid to the Court&rsquo;s formulation that it was the plaintiff &rsquo;s responsibility 
to carry on with charges and not that of the prosecutor. However, the two ways 
of carrying charges in what was certainly seen as a serious breach of the law 
were clearly both seen as possible. The duel cases were thus not purely inquisi-
torial, but they could well be processed accusatorially as well.
</p>
<p>Some of the official prosecution cases were intended to maintain public or-
der, even when the crime itself may not have been serious. Cases involving 
disrespect towards authorities were typically lacking private accusers. Thus 
Prosecutor Schirm brought two servants, J&uuml;rgen and Jakob, to the Pernau Low-
er Court, for having a fight.149 To enforce respect for the court and the royal 
authority behind it, it was especially important to keep order in court. Officers 
Arent Turlau, Dettloff vs. Plate, and David Remling were, therefore, charged in 
1688 by Schirm with &ldquo;improper behaviour against each other before the Court&rdquo; 
(&ldquo;in puncto immodesten verfahrung gegen einander vor Gericht&rdquo;). It was, how-
ever, often difficult to get noblemen to appear in court as the accused, even 
though the courts threatened them with punishment.150 Thus in 1690 Schirm 
cited Lieutenant Johan Grack in the District Court of Pernau for disrespect of 
a court order (&ldquo;vilipendirung gerichtlichen befehls&rdquo;).151 Schirm was again active 
in the same year against Inspector Schmid, who was accused of breaking the 
Royal Prayer Placate.152
</p>
<p>In another case at the Pernau Lower Court in 1690, Prosecutor Schirm had 
in 1689 summoned Lieutenant Daniel Br&uuml;ning&rsquo;s wife to Pernau Lower Court

<p>for contempt of court orders. When it turned out that the Lieutenant was 
not at home, the court servant (Gerichtsdiener) had delivered the summons 
to his wife instead. According to the prosecutor, she had thrown the enve-
lope away with &ldquo;highest disrespect and slander&rdquo; (&ldquo;zum h&ouml;schsten despect und 
beschimpffung&rdquo;).153 Although the accused was acquitted for lack of evidence, it 
shows a typical case, the type which interested Livonian prosecutors.
</p>
<p>Schirm&rsquo;s case against Hauptmann Schwenewandel from Fellin, for tearing 
and burning down a fence in connection to an argument about correct bor-
ders, also belongs to the class of cases concerning public order. The burning 
had caused &ldquo;more than a little danger&rdquo; (&ldquo;kein geringer Schade&rdquo;) because of the 
animals moving in the area. Self-help from the side of the accused seemed to 
anger the Prosecutor the most: he had &ldquo;no right to set another person&rsquo;s prop-
erty to unrest, and even less in a violent way.&rdquo;154
</p>
<p>4.3.4 Inquisitorial Procedure
In the early years of the Swedish rule, inquisitorial cases in the strict sense thus 
did not appear, and not even accusatorial cases initiated by public prosecu-
tors were seen. It was not government officials but private parties who initi-
ated the criminal cases. However, cases initiated as accusatorial often acquired 
traits which made them inquisitorial. A leading role taken by the judge in the 
proceedings and the use of judicial torture are the most typical of those traits. 
Similarly, despite the active role of the official prosecutor in initiating cases, 
the records show that towards the end of the seventeenth century it was the 
court that overtook the search for material truth in the criminal cases. The case 
of the official prosecutor Philipp Schirm against Jochim Schenck illustrates 
this. Schenck was a weaver at the Auder manor house, and he was accused of 
adultery, having engaged in an illegal sexual relation with his former servant 
Mari. Schirm had brought the case to court and stated, to begin, that if &ldquo;adul-
tery would not be punished, harmful sins would become so common that no-
one would take them for sins.&rdquo;155

<p>189The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>In Livonia, &ldquo;crime&rdquo; (crimen) was terminologically associated with and lim-
ited to inquisitional procedure. The book of the Pernau District Court minutes 
for the years 1688&ndash;1690 contains a list of Criminalia.156 They are not many, only 
ten, and there is no mention of the proceedings or the sentence. What most 
of these cases have in common is the inquisitorial procedure in the proper 
meaning of the term: eight of the cases are court-driven (&ldquo;Das K&ouml;nigl. Landgrt 
ex officio&rdquo;). Two can be classified as denunciatory, with a pastor prosecuting in 
one case and a peasant in another. All of the crimes are severe ones, such as 
homicide, infanticide, desertion, blasphemy, and incest.
</p>
<p>According to the learned ius commune, the inquisitorial procedure should 
have begun with a &ldquo;general inquisition,&rdquo; in which it was established whether 
the crime had been committed and who the suspect was. A &ldquo;special inquisi-
tion&rdquo; aimed at establishing whether the accused was guilty or not. The Livo-
nian inquisitorial procedure knew no such division into the different phases 
of the inquisitorial procedure. Instead, the accused was taken directly into the 
court, usually by his manorial lord, the steward, or the pastor &ndash; and sometimes 
by the victim, or his or her relatives.157
</p>
<p>After the prosecutor&rsquo;s opening statement, the questioning of the accused 
began and was completely in the hands of the court. This &ldquo;denunciation&rdquo; was 
in fact the prosecutor&rsquo;s most important task. This is also why the difference be-
tween accusatorial procedure driven by the prosecutor and inquisitorial pro-
cedure is often at best unclear, and is not significant.158 In Mari&rsquo;s case also, the 
court asked detailed questions, first of the accused herself. The court wanted 
to know who the father of the child was, where and when the two accused 
had had sex together, and whether the sexual intercourse had taken place only 
once, or more than that. She was also asked whether she knew that Jochim 
had a wife, how Mari and Jochim had communicated (because Jochim only 
spoke German and she the vernacular), and why she had not told anyone that 
Jochim would not &ldquo;leave her in peace&rdquo; but followed her everywhere.159 Jochim 
admitted that he had slept with Mari, but only once, whereas Mari had &ldquo;done it 
with everybody.&rdquo; Jochim also claimed that he had not completed (&ldquo;vollbracht&rdquo;) 
</p>
<p>156 The same book of minutes contains an index of all cases protocolled (and thus handled) 
by the court in those years. This rotulus actorum contains 72 cases. Besides the 10 crimina-
lia, 55 can be classified as other crimes, 15 as civil cases and two as cases of manorial law.

<p>the intercourse. Jochim offered to confirm all this on purgatory oath, which 
was accepted. The purgatory oath, as was customary, did not take place on the 
same day, and the case was dismissed. Before the dismissal, however, Jochim 
was asked whether he could produce witnesses to testify on Mari&rsquo;s sexual pro-
miscuity. He answered that he certainly could but that that would take some 
time.160
</p>
<p>The keeping of public order entailed controlling legal self-help. It was im-
portant for the courts to sanction the independent use of violence. In court 
records, the formula &ldquo;sein eigen richter,&rdquo; to be &ldquo;one&rsquo;s own judge,&rdquo; figures in the 
early years of the Swedish period. Magnus Anrep, for instance, was punished 
for dragging Arendt von Hursen&rsquo;s serf onto Anrep&rsquo;s own manor and having the 
serf slashed. Anrep accused the serf of stealing honey and took also a saddle 
from the serf as a pledge until the honey be replaced. The Court found Anrep&rsquo;s 
activities unacceptable and punished him for being &ldquo;his own judge&rdquo; (&ldquo;weilen er 
sein eigen richter gewest&rdquo;).161

<p>191The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>In an almost separate category were cases in which the lower courts  
proceeded on the basis of a &ldquo;delinquent list&rdquo; (Delinquentenzettel, lista delin-
quentium) provided by a local pastor, who thus denounced wrongdoers from 
their parishes.162 This is close to a denunciatory procedure.163 However, it is 
doubtful whether any one of the legal professionals in the Livonian courts 
conceived of it theoretically as such. The pastor thus initiated the case, after 
which the investigation was taken over by the court. On 29 June 1640, Pastor 
Christoph Sevarius brought three cases to the District Court of Pernau hold-
ing assizes at the Rugen Manor. In this case one of them involved infanticide  
and the two others were cases of fornication.164 The case of a woman named 
Orste will illustrate. After the denunciation, the court took over the inquisi-
tion completely. Orste was probably questioned about her sexual crimes, be-
cause the Court wanted her to list all of her children (four altogether) and their  
fathers. She was sentenced to be whipped and branded for &ldquo;many crimes 
and serious excesses,&rdquo; but the sentence was sent to the magistrate&rsquo;s court for  
approval or leuteration. The answer came within a week: the magistrate&rsquo;s 
courts, having mercy on Orste, expelled her out of town, with the stipulation 
that she would be whipped and branded should she reappear.165 The infanti-
cide case of Maye at the Pernau Lower Court in 1641 is another typical example. 
The local priest Christoph Sevarius, again, denounced Maye in the court. Af-
ter the denouncement, Sevarius no longer appeared in court proceedings, but 
instead the Court itself took over the proceedings. It questioned the suspect 
and decided to proceed to judicial torture, which the High Court of Dorpat 
permitted.166

tion cases, were held consecutively on the same day. All suspects confessed immediately 
and were fined. From the point of the view of the condemned, the cases were not closed, 
however, because they still had to face the Consistory Court and face the ensuing church 
punishment. dcp 1690, nae 915.1.7, f. 494&ndash;499. The formula reserving the consistory court

<p>4.3.5 The Proof in Criminal Cases
By and large, the Livonian courts followed the statutory theory of proof, devel-
oped in the medieval and early modern ius commune. A typical example of a 
decision embodying the essential elements of the theory, the confession and 
the witness statements, is the decision of Pernau District Court in 1690 against 
Jurgen Poribe in a slander case. The conviction was based both on confession 
(although a partial one) and witness statements (&ldquo;theil&szlig; durch eigen gest&auml;nd-
ni&szlig;, absonderlich aber der gef&uuml;hrter Zeugen Eydliche au&szlig;sage &uuml;berwiesen, und 
convinciret&rdquo;).167
</p>
<p>The theory was reflected first and foremost, however, in the significance of 
the confession as the basis for conviction, which was sometimes extracted us-
ing judicial torture. It was an important part of the inquisitorial quest for judi-
cial truth, although torture was already on the decline in seventeenth-century 
Europe.168 In Livonia, judicial torture was used regularly from the early years 
of the Swedish period until 1680s. lgo 1632 Art. xxx and xxxiv regulated tor-
ture following the typical ius commune precepts.169 Judicial torture was law-
ful, if based on &ldquo;sufficient circumstantial evidence&rdquo; (&ldquo;genugsame indicia&rdquo;) and  
&ldquo;presumptions&rdquo; (&ldquo;praesumptiones&rdquo;). The lower court was not to proceed to tor-
ture before it had received permission to do so from the High Court. Depend-
ing on the results, more witnesses could be heard and additional inquisitorial

</p>
<p>measures be taken. The final decision should then again be sent to the High 
Court&rsquo;s approval.
</p>
<p>A witchcraft case may serve as an example. In 1632, Georg Stiernhielm, judge 
at the District Court of Dorpat, referred a witchcraft case to the High Court&rsquo;s 
review. In his cover letter to Per Sparre (President of the High Court in 1631&ndash;34), 
Stiernhielm hoped that the High Court would &ldquo;have some consideration for 
torture in this case&rdquo; (&ldquo;hafva n&aring;got bet&auml;nckiande om Torturen i denne Saken&rdquo;). 
According to Stiernhielm, the crime of witchcraft had become common, prob-
ably because this was an &ldquo;occult crime, which could rarely carry half a proof, or 
even circumstantial evidence, but never full proof.&rdquo; Because of the lack of any 
evidence, the criminals could rarely be brought to torture. Peasants were there-
fore scared of even trying to get witches to courts, thinking that &ldquo;they could get 
themselves no justice&rdquo; (&ldquo;sigh ingen r&auml;tt kunna f&aring;&rdquo;).170
</p>
<p>In European criminal procedure, judicial torture is normally associated with 
inquisitorial procedure. In Livonia this was the case as well although, as ex-
plained above, a case which had started as accusatorial or by denunciation, 
could turn into inquisitorial. After it had been decided to employ judicial tor-
ture, the procedure more or less followed the ius commune rules, which the 
case of Maye shows well.
</p>
<p>In 1641 a woman named Maye was accused of infanticide at the Pernau 
Lower Court, and another woman referred to as &ldquo;the old Saika wife&rdquo; (die alte 
Saikatsche) was charged with acting as accessory to the crime. Both women 
refused to confess. If the lower court thought that the confession should be 
applied in criminal cases, the High Court&rsquo;s decision on that had to be solicited. 
This was done in the case of Maye and the Saika wife.171 Maye was asked &ldquo;seri-
ously to reveal the truth,&rdquo; but she refused to confess. The Saika wife did not 
confess either. When tortured again, Maye confessed. Following the normal ius 
commune procedure, she was asked again, on the next day, before the court. 
She maintained that she had only given birth to one child, but now confessed 
that she had killed the child with &ldquo;her own hands&rdquo; (&ldquo;mit Ihren h&auml;nden geth-
&ouml;tet&rdquo;) and given it to the Saika woman, so that she, with the help of her son, 
would hide the body. According the judicial doctrine, in order to be valid, the

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>confession had to be repeated after the torture. Maye repeated her confession 
word for word (&ldquo;w&ouml;rttlichen&rdquo;) and was condemned to death.172 What happened 
if judicial torture did not produce confession? There are not many examples 
of this. In the infanticide case of Maye, in which the Saika wife was charged 
with acting as accessory, the latter did not confess even when tortured (&ldquo;keine&szlig; 
wege&szlig; bekennen wollen&rdquo;). She did not, however, escape punishment, but was 
sentenced to two pairs of lashes.173 The court thus, as was customary in the 
European common criminal law of the time, took recourse to poena extraor-
dinaria: when there was not enough evidence for capital punishment, the ac-
cused could nevertheless be sentenced to a punishment less than death.
</p>
<p>Judicial torture lessened towards the last decades of the Swedish period, 
following the general European trend.174 In 1668, however, the Pernau Town 
Court decided to torture Karro Hans to find out whether Parrihild Herman had 
really acted as an accessory to him in a horse theft.175 The torture took place 
&ldquo;around 3 o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; on the morning of 8 April 1668. The questions were proto-
colled, as well as the answers. After the torture, Hans was asked whether he still 
held to what he had said under torture. Hans replied affirmatively, &ldquo;after which 
the actus inquisitionis was terminated for this time, and the suspect was taken 
back to his cell.&rdquo;176
</p>
<p>In another case from the Pernau Lower Court in 1679 a peasant woman 
named Oyo stood for charges of infanticide and refused to confess.177 Because 
considerable circumstantial evidence was in place, she was &ldquo;sentenced&rdquo; to  
torture &ldquo;per gradu,&rdquo; although the decision was referred to the High Court&rsquo;s final

<p>decision. The High Court issued the permission, and the accused was subject-
ed to torture with the executioner (Scharffrichter) and the local priest pres-
ent. Oyo was first shown torture instruments, but since that did not have the 
desired effect on her, the actual torture started. She refused to confess, and the 
torture proceeded to the severest phase (summo gradu). The torture still not 
resulting in confession, Oyo was returned to her cell. The District Court then 
declared that since the accused had not confessed, she now was &ldquo;purged&rdquo; of 
the charges. She was acquitted.178 The case is rare, because it seems that Oyo 
was indeed set free and not sentenced to an extraordinary punishment of any 
kind.179
</p>
<p>In early modern European criminal law, one of primary fields of application 
for judicial torture was witchcraft cases. As I have shown elsewhere, the medi-
eval institution of judicial ordeals resurfaced in connection with the witchcraft 
cases in the early modern period. Ordeals of cold water and needle tests were 
used in close connection to the prevailing statutory theory of proof. Witchcraft 
cases were often difficult to prove, and it was often difficult even to acquire 
enough evidence to initiate judicial torture. Ordeals were helpful in this re-
spect: water ordeal or a needle test could provide the necessary semiplena pro-
batio, a half proof, which authorized a court to proceed to judicial torture.180
</p>
<p>The connection between the ordeal and judicial torture is clear in the Livo-
nian witchcraft trials as well. On 22 July 1641, Kiese Wilhelm, a peasant from 
the manor of Sarishoff, brought charges against a man named Morjahn. The 
latter had allegedly used witchcraft against Wilhelm&rsquo;s wife, causing her death. 
Morjahn denied the charges. Urgamus Henn, another peasant, appeared in 
court as well, claiming that Morjahn had cast a spell on his wife as well to the 
effect that she had &ldquo;become immediately sick and raging, had torn her clothes 
off and run around like crazy&rdquo; (&ldquo;sie al&szlig; baldt kranck vnd rasend geworden, die 
kleider vom Leibe abgeriessen, vnd wie vnsinnig herumb gelauffen&rdquo;). Morjahn 
had also offered to teach witchcraft to Wilhem, Henn, and some others. Mor-
jahn then admitted that he had learned magical formulae (&ldquo;Koffaretta, Zeittap 
Sax, Wietta, Weitta Liehatarck&rdquo;) from &ldquo;an old Kerrig,&rdquo; and other tricks from a 
&ldquo;Courlandish peasant&rdquo;; these, however, were all good sorcery and had nothing to

<p>do with evil (&ldquo;dienen dieselbige nicht zum b&ouml;sen&rdquo;). Morjahn refused to confess, 
but because he was &ldquo;ex communi fama&rdquo; a sorcerer, he was ordered to undergo 
the water ordeal and to be tortured. As usual, the decision to apply torture was 
submitted to the High Court&rsquo;s approval, which was obtained.181
</p>
<p>A Royal Letter of December 1686 prohibited judicial torture, although the 
prohibition was not a novelty. The Letter was a response to a r&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; legislatif that 
the High Court of Dorpat had made. The King ordered the High Court to &ldquo;fol-
low the general usage of the Kingdom and the content of the War Articles.&rdquo;182 
In 1683, King Charles xi had issued a Royal Ordinance to regulate the legal 
procedure in courts martial (the War Articles). Article 23 of the Ordinance said 
that &ldquo;Legal proof consists of the accused&rsquo;s own confession, when the accused 
confesses voluntarily and unforced in court [&hellip;] but no one may be tortured 
or persecuted to confession, because torture is forbidden in the Kingdom of 
the Royal Majesty and in itself is dangerous and uncertain.&rdquo; The article was, 
however, also based on an earlier practice: in a high court case of 1652, the Svea 
High Court had already stated expressly that &ldquo;torture is not, and for many rea-
sons, in use here in our country.&rdquo;183 The Swedish law on judicial torture in the 
mid-seventeenth century was, however, still uncertain, which partly explains 
the need of the Dorpat High Court to inquire about its legality in the 1680s. 
The other part of the explanation certainly has to do with the fact that judicial 
torture had indeed been in regular use in Livonia. In Sweden proper this had 
not been the case. The prohibition of the Svea High Court in 1652 has to be un-
derstood as a measure against certain isolated attempts to regularize torture, 
which had also been in use in the Stockholm city court.184
</p>
<p>The Letter of 1686 seems to have been effective. At least the case material 
in this study shows no instances of judicial torture after 1686.185 The following 
year, 1687, a peasant from the island of Kihnu stood accused of incest at the 
Pernau District Court. Since full proof was lacking, the District Court remitted

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>the question of torture to the High Court. It decided that &ldquo;because there is no 
full proof against [the accused] at hand, in this dubious case, he be, according 
to the law on the abolition of torture, acquitted [&hellip;].&rdquo;186 However, the concept 
of torture still needed to be defined. In 1692, the District Court of Dorpat asked 
the High Court whether &ldquo;in order to save the soul of the accused and to arrive at 
a rightful verdict,&rdquo; it might be possible &ldquo;in these circumstances and because of 
the hard-headedness of the accused, without violating his royal majesty&rsquo;s pro-
hibition against torture&rdquo; to proceed to territio verbalis or even territio realis &ndash;  
threatening with torture or preparing for it. The High Court, taking a firm 
stand, answered negatively stating that territio was also considered &ldquo;a sort of 
torture.&rdquo;187 The pressure to use judicial torture in witchcraft cases was appar-
ently there, although it is does not seem probable that the prohibition of tor-
ture contributed to the dying out of witchcraft cases. Their zenith had been 
earlier, in the first half of the century: in the years 1610&ndash;1650, 55 witches were 
executed in Estonia.188
</p>
<p>The prohibition of judicial torture was among those Swedish legal rules, 
which were effectively enforced in the last decades of the seventeenth century. 
Still, it is likely that the prohibition of torture did not contribute much to the 
demise of torture in Livonia. The practice of torturing was on its way out. As we 
saw above, few cases of judicial torture are found in the court protocols of the 
second half of the century that I have analysed. This also explains the District 
Court&rsquo;s need to pose the question to the High Court. The Lower Court prob-
ably felt unsure when the need for judicial torture arose in connection with a 
witchcraft case. It is not strange that the problem arose there, because torture

<p>187 According to Carpzov, territio verbalis and territio realis referred to different preparatory 
stages of torture. In territio verbalis, an executioner prepared verbally for the torture, by 
threatening the accused. In territio realis, the executioner proceeded from the verbal

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>was frequently used in witchcraft cases in other parts of Europe, even when 
the suspects were no longer tortured in other kinds of cases.
</p>
<p>With or without torture, confession was central to the seventeenth-century 
law of proof, which is shown, among other things, by the fact that fictitious 
confessions were sometimes constructed. Arend Turlau was charged with for-
nication in 1690 at the Pernau Lower Court, but did not appear in court. Turlau 
had been cited several times to answer to the charges, but had made himself 
guilty of contumacy over and over again. He had, however, been seen in Fellin 
around the time of the trial without even bothering to send a notification of 
an excuse to the court. The court therefore drew the conclusion that he had 
&ldquo;acknowledged the case lost&rdquo; (&ldquo;der sache verlustig erkannt&rdquo;).189 From the point 
of view of the theory of proof, it is interesting that the Court felt the need to 
construct Turlau&rsquo;s behaviour as a kind of a confession, albeit only a fictitious 
one.190
</p>
<p>As part of the statutory theory of proof, the courts followed the two-witness 
rule. Full proof could thus be constituted not only of a confession but also of 
the statements of two eyewitnesses.191 Thus in the Pernau District Court (1688) 
in the case Carl Friedrich Lilienfeld vs. Herman Jencken (in puncto injuriarum 
verbalium, slander) the fiscal Schirm, as the advocate of Jancken, claimed that 
the plaintiff had only produced one witness (&ldquo;testis unicus&rdquo;) which was not 
sufficient.192
</p>
<p>Claims against the witnesses&rsquo; hability were also made, again line with the 
ius commune theory. The learned advocate Sch&ouml;nfeld, when defending his cli-
ent in a slander case in the District Court of Pernau in 1690, suggested that the 
Court should proclaim the plaintiff &rsquo;s witnesses as &ldquo;not habile.&rdquo;193

<p>199The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>People of all estates were heard as witnesses, although sometimes distrust 
of peasant folk could come through. Thus the advocate Sch&ouml;nfeldt, on behalf 
of quartermaster J&uuml;rgen Poribe (Pernau District Court 1690), reminded the 
Court to ask the plaintiffs&rsquo; witnesses, &ldquo;in order to avoid perjury, to which these 
[&hellip;] people were prone enough, in general whether they prayed, went to the 
holy communion, if they knew that God rewarded perjury with a punishment 
in hell, whether they profited from these cases [&hellip;]&rdquo;194 The Court took Sch&ouml;n-
feldt&rsquo;s point into consideration, although it would probably have asked the 
same questions anyway.195
</p>
<p>Purgatory oath (iuramentum purgatorium) was an important part of the  
gemeines Recht theory of evidence. When half a proof existed, but the alleged 
crime was not serious, the accused could be allowed to purge himself of the 
charges.196 In the case of Schilling, the accused took the oath and was acquit-
ted. However, sometimes the threat of purgatory oath produced a confession. 
When Herman Jancken was shown by one witness (testis unicus) to have li-
belled Carl Friedrich Lilienfeld in 1688, he was ordered to take a purgatory 
oath. After the interlocutory sentence demanding the oath had been given, 
Jancken confessed, and the case was finally settled with a handshake.197 In 1690 
the official prosecutor charged Magnus Geijer with sleeping with a prostitute.

<p>Because the only evidence was the whore&rsquo;s own statement, Geijer was made 
to swear a purgatory oath.198 Soon Geijer stood trial again, this time for having 
illicit sex with the maid of his mother. Again the evidence was strong (grosse 
praesumptiones), but not tantamount to full proof, and Geijer was ordered to 
take the oath. This time, however, he lacked the courage and confessed, thus 
getting himself a fine.199 Similarly, Stephen Dettmer, when charged with for-
nication in the Pernau Lower Court in September, 1690, first denied and was 
given a chance to purge himself by oath. After the Court&rsquo;s warning that &ldquo;he 
should think about what he had done and not soil his soul,&rdquo; he confessed.200
</p>
<p>A standard part of the ius commune theory of proof,201 the concept of no-
toriety, was also known. In a battery case, the Pernau Lower Court stated that 
&ldquo;since the accused does not yet confess to charges [&hellip;], the plaintiff is him-
self responsible for proving his case.&rdquo; The plaintiff replied that he did not  
need any witnesses, because everything he claimed was &ldquo;notorious&rdquo; (&ldquo;&hellip;sey

<p>4.3.6 The Policing and Execution of Punishments: A Function of the 
Manorial Lords
</p>
<p>Modern policing is the product of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,203 
and thus Livonian society had no police forces. In towns, defendants could 
sometimes be taken into custody and for crimes which were not even very seri-
ous. They could be taken into custody into the city hall (Rathaus) if there was 
a risk of contumacy,204 or if the defendant might not be able to place a surety 
(cautio).205 In the countryside, there were no corresponding institutions for 
keeping suspects in custody in existence. Manorial lords were entitled to keep 
order on their estates &ndash; and indeed were responsible for doing so &ndash; as part 
of their powers of house discipline (ius apprehendi et incarcerandi).206 This 
involved taking suspected criminals into custody into the manor&rsquo;s premises, 
both before the trial, during the trial, and after the trial while awaiting the ex-
ecution of the punishment.207 In 1694, the Landrichter Johan Adolph Anrep or-
dered the Steward Didrich Wistinghusen at Fellin Manor to arrest Karja Koera 
Jahn and Jahno Elst, suspected of &ldquo;severe crime&rdquo; (&ldquo;Schwere Missethaten&rdquo;). Jahn 
and Elst were to be put in &ldquo;secure custody&rdquo; (&ldquo;sichere Verhafft&rdquo;) until their day 
in court. Wistinghusen was threatened with a fine of 200 silver thalers, should 
he not succeed in arresting the suspects. He was further ordered to arrange to 
transport Karja Koera Jahn to a prison in Pernau &ldquo;after the inquisition,&rdquo; order-
ing &ldquo;good and trustworthy people&rdquo; to take care of the transportation so &ldquo;that

gesuchet werden&hellip;&rdquo;). The court nevertheless decided to take the defendant immediately 
into custody.

</p>
<p>he does not escape.&rdquo; Wistinghusen was also reminded of a previous court 
order, according to which he was responsible for arresting another criminal 
suspect.208 Wistinghusen apparently tried to avoid the burdensome responsi-
bility and was summoned to court by Prosecutor Schirm for not acting in the 
prescribed manner &ldquo;for such a long time and not in within the set time.&rdquo; After 
the parties had exchanged various briefs, the court decided to give Wistinghu-
sen more time to catch the runaway suspect, stating that should Wistinghusen 
fail to do this, no more writings would be allowed, but the case would then be 
decided on the basis of the material already gathered.209 In an infanticide case 
a steward had taken a peasant in custody. Lacking sufficient evidence, the ac-
cused was ordered to be tortured. In the meantime and in between the torture 
sessions, the steward was ordered to keep the suspect in custody on pain of 100 
thalers &ldquo;according to the Royal Instruction.&rdquo;210
</p>
<p>Sometimes the limits of what manorial authorities were allowed to do law-
fully were trespassed. The case of Remling vs. Beckman of 1688 shows how this 
worked in practice. Remling charged Beckman, the steward at Felix Manor, with 
taking a sack of peas from him during a violent house search initiated by him-
self. The District Court of Pernau had even given a summary order (Mandat) 
to Beckman&rsquo;s superior, Cornet Plathe, to return the peas, but this order had not 
been respected. The Court decided to acquit Beckman, who had acted on the 
command of his superior (&ldquo;auf befehl seines Herren&rdquo;), and Remling was direct-
ed to summon Plathe to court, should Remling want to pursue his charges.211  
Although the case ended in acquittal, the responsibility of the plaintiff himself 
to inspect the crime and take the necessary steps to have the guilty person 
condemned is clear.
</p>
<p>The limits of the master&rsquo;s powers were at times surpassed, as in the case of 
&ldquo;exceeded house discipline&rdquo; (&ldquo;in puncto excedirter Hau&szlig; discipline&rdquo;) of the peas-
ant Jurri. According to Jurri, Steward Bartel had falsely accused him of stealing 
from another peasant. Bartel had arrested Jurri (&ldquo;gefangen genommen&rdquo;) and 
tied his hands behind his back. On the way to the manor house the steward 
had hit Jurri and had kept him prisoner for twelve days. When Jurri had not 
confessed to the theft charges, Bartel had put handcuffs of iron (eyserne Handt-
Fe&szlig;eln) on him and kept them on his wrists for three hours. When Jurri still 
had not confessed, Bartel had finally let him go. In addition to this, Bartel had

</p>
<p>also arrested Jurri&rsquo;s wife and held her for three days. Jurri, without an advocate 
or the involvement of the actor officiosus, now asked the court to punish the 
steward. The steward also appeared by himself, without a lawyer, asking the 
court &ldquo;because he was a stranger [to law], to teach him whether he had to stand 
before the Court with the plaintiff who was a thief&rdquo; (&ldquo;BeKlagter Verwalter trat 
vors Protocoll und baht weill Er ein frembder Ihn zu belehren, ob Er mit Kl&auml;ger, 
al&szlig; mit einem diebe [&hellip;]&rdquo;). The steward had brought a witness, who stated that 
the plaintiff had broken into the witness&rsquo; room &ldquo;before Bartholomew&rdquo; (vor Bar-
tholomei). The witness had followed Jurri&rsquo;s footsteps and had found a box with 
the stolen goods in it near the witness&rsquo; home. The steward confessed that he 
had arrested and held Jurri, but only for half an hour. The Cubias of the manor 
also witnessed that he himself had tied Jurri to a post about a hand wide (&ldquo;[&hellip;] 
habe Klr. Mit den F&uuml;&szlig;en auf einem pfahl einer handt breit gestanden [&hellip;]&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>The Court voted on the outcome of the case. Assessor Harnisch was not 
convinced by the witness statement and the plaintiff &rsquo;s culpability to the theft, 
and since the steward had nevertheless confessed (and the Cubias had also 
witnessed it to the same direction), he was ready to sentence the steward to 
a fine of 20 thalers. Harnisch would have absolved Jurri of the theft charge. 
Judge von Anrep and assessor von Ceumern were not quite so convinced of the 
peasant&rsquo;s innocence and applied the institution of absolutio ab instantia until 
more proofs emerged.212 The decision thus amounted to nothing else as far 
Jurri was concerned. As for Bartel, the majority found him guilty of exceeding 
the limits of lawful house discipline, but decided that it was the official pros-
ecutor&rsquo;s responsibility to prosecute Bartel for the crime. In fact, Bartel walked 
free, although he had been pronounced guilty.213 Again, regardless of whether

</p>
<p>Bartel was condemned or not, the question was about his exceeding the limits 
of house discipline, which in itself included certain police powers.
</p>
<p>The manorial lords could be specifically entrusted with the responsibility of 
ensuring that a defendant showed up in court. An example of this is the case 
heard by the Pernau Lower Court in 1688 at its session at the Karkus Manor, 
in which blacksmith Clas Furstenberg accused the tailor Johan L&uuml;ders, both 
from the Karkus Manor, of slander. According to the Court, L&uuml;ders had been 
seen the night before the court session around the manor, but since he was 
nevertheless present at court either in person or through a representative, he 
was condemned for contumacy. At the same time, the manorial lord was to 
ensure that L&uuml;ders appear in court for the next stage of the proceedings.214 In 
the case of a summons demanding the personal presence of the accused, it 
did not suffice to send a lawyer. When Matthis Donau had been summoned to 
appear in person before of Pernau Lower Court in 1690, he sent his advocate 
Weisensee to ask for continuance instead of coming personally. In its inter-
locutory decision, the court ordered Donau to be kept in custody until the next 
court session.215
</p>
<p>The homicide case that Wilibald Bergen brought against four peasants at 
the Pernau Lower Court in 1641 illustrates the post-sentencing custody: after 
the accused had been sentenced, two of them were ordered into the custody of 
Bergen, one in Michel Engelhardt&rsquo;s custody and one in that of Wolmer Kloett, 
according to which manor house each of them belonged to.216
</p>
<p>Based on vlgo of 1632 (Art. xxxii), the execution of punishments also re-
mained a duty of manorial personnel throughout the Swedish era. The admin-
istration of lashes was routinely entrusted to the manor houses under which 
the sentenced belonged.217 Thus when Cubias Puiste Matz was condemned in 
1688 by the Pernau Lower Court to lashes for selling his lord&rsquo;s rye for his own 
benefit (wegen Untreu), the Court commanded the lashes to be administered 
by &ldquo;a man from the manor&rdquo; (&ldquo;durch einen hoffskerl gestrichen werden&rdquo;).218 It was 
usually the steward of the manor (amtsmann, hauptmann) who would bring 
the accused to the court, keep him available for the proceedings and then

<p>execute the punishment. Stewards were responsible for administering the 
punishment of lashes, but not only that: sometimes even death punishments 
were carried out at the manors and by the manorial personnel. In the homicide 
case against Erich Kiefer in 1641 the Pernau Lower Court, in a sentence at the 
end of the case entry and after pronouncing the death sentence, it is stated 
that &ldquo;the execution will be entrusted to the local steward Arendt von Hursen, 
and he is to undertake the execution in order to avoid legal punishment.&rdquo;219 In 
the infanticide case of Maye, the steward of Maye&rsquo;s manorial lord (Grundherr) 
was commanded to arrange for her execution.220

<p>4.3.7 Between Civil and Criminal Law: The In-court Settlements  
in Swedish Livonia
</p>
<p>The following will show that the inquisitorial and accusatorial principles, 
and the various ways of combining them, were not the only ones in Livonian  
seventeenth-century procedure. One cannot fully understand the Livonian le-
gal system of the seventeenth century in terms of the procedural principles 
only. From the fact that crimes were still largely understood as belonging to the 
accused&rsquo;s private sphere it followed that the individual taking cases to court 
was sometimes allowed to dispose of the case once it reached court. The courts 
were anything but passive in this: they favoured and sometimes even pressed 
parties to settle.
</p>
<p>Both extra-judicial arbitration (arbiter) and active settlement by judicial 
courts themselves had a long pedigree in European legal history by the seven-
teenth century. The procedural handbooks (ordines judiciarii) of the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries, building on Justinian law, developed the topic of 
arbitration and amicable settlement to the minutest detail. As in procedural 
questions in general, canonists &ndash; such as Tancredus &ndash; were especially active 
here. Following canonist literature, Liber extra (1234) contained a title &ldquo;De ar-
bitris&rdquo; (x i, 43), and the enormously influential late thirteenth-century Specu-
lum iudicialis of Guillielmus Durantis then gathered the threads of scholarship

<p>together.221 Different forms of dispute settlements were common in medi-
eval legal practice as well,222 although the terminology varied. Settling agents 
themselves could be called arbitri, arbitratores, diffinitores, amicabili composi-
tores, dispensatores, boni viri, or communes amici.223
</p>
<p>The institution of arbitration, and amicable settlements by and with the 
assistance of judicial courts, survived into the early modern period. As I will 
show later, settlements occurred and were encouraged even in the Council 
of the Realm, which decided cases as the last instance by way of beneficium 
revisionis.
</p>
<p>The medieval Livonian Ritterrecht thus also entailed provisions on the 
theme. Thus Chapter 77 forbids settlements in cases brought to court without 
the court&rsquo;s permission, and Chapter 84 provides rules on how the killer is to 
pay compensation to the victim&rsquo;s relatives.224 I will now establish some cen-
tral characteristics of legal settlements such as they emerge inlight of Livonian 
court practice during the Swedish period.
</p>
<p>My first example is from the Polish period. In an interesting homicide case 
at Pernau District Court in 1624, a minor was charged accusatorially with ho-
micide. The Court refers to the old institution of Wergeld, which &ldquo;in this kind 
of case, gemeines Rechts orders that the criminal accuser does not demand the 
boy&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo; The Wergeld was on its way to extinction, however, because the 
Court sentenced the defendant&rsquo;s father to pay fines and to arrange for the de-
ceased&rsquo;s funeral.225

<p>207The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>On 26 February 1640, Lellepe Peet&rsquo;s widow Anne appeared in the District 
Court of Pernau. Anne demanded punishment for Hans Wardi, whom she ac-
cused of murdering her husband. Hans admitted that he had slain the victim, 
but claimed that this had happened without premeditation (ohn nachgier und 
vorgesetztem eyffer) &ndash; to use the modern English concept in homicide vs. mur-
der. Hans, however, asked the Court to spare himself from the &ldquo;harshness of the 
law&rdquo; (&ldquo;der scharffe des rechten&szlig;&rdquo;).226
</p>
<p>At this point Anne, together with her son and the brother of the deceased, 
intervened, &ldquo;totally resigning their case&rdquo; (totuliter begeben). They asked the 
court to spare the deceased from the ordinary punishment, because the kill-
ing had not been intentional (ex proposito). Anne also notified the court that 
Hans had apologized to the deceased&rsquo;s relatives for the deed. In addition, he 
had promised to live peacefully with them and to take care of the victim&rsquo;s chil-
dren &ldquo;as if they had been his own&rdquo; (al&szlig; sein eigen zu versorgen, angelobet). The 
foreman of the manor house, to which the accused (and most probably the 
victim as well) belonged, also intervened on behalf of the manorial lord (&ldquo;Gen-
eral feldt Herr&rdquo;), reporting that the accused&rsquo;s father and the accused himself 
had both served the manor &ldquo;faithfully and had behaved well.&rdquo; The crime had 
been accidental. Hans had been kept &ldquo;with his hand and feet bound up for a 
whole year,&rdquo; and the case had been &ldquo;settled between friends&rdquo; (&ldquo;diese sache mit 
dem freunden gesuehent vnd vertragen&rdquo;). Therefore, the foreman suggested, the 
Court ought to refrain from resorting to ordinary punishment.
</p>
<p>The Court accepted the petition of the plaintiff and the foreman. The kill-
ing had not occurred wilfully, ex proposito occidendi animo, in addition to 
which Hans had spent almost a year in the manorial &ldquo;hard prison&rdquo; (in schweren 
gefengni&szlig;). The Court was further motivated in its decision by the fact that 
the relatives had given up the charges, and had foregone the ordinary death 
punishment but had sentenced Hans Wardi to a fine of 200 Reichstaler and 
a church punishment. However, Hans had to wait in custody until the High 
Court of Dorpat had accepted the lower court verdict.
</p>
<p>It may seem odd that Anne took the case to court if she was willing to  
settle it anyway. In actual fact, Anne&rsquo;s behaviour makes perfect sense. Most 
probably, she wanted to get the court&rsquo;s approval for the conditions under 
which she was willing to drop the charge. Accordingly, Hans&rsquo; promise to take 
care of Anne&rsquo;s children was recorded in the minutes. This must have been es-
sential for Anne.

<p>The practice of sentencing to a milder punishment in exchange for 
compensation of the victim&rsquo;s damages fits the comparative international

<p>picture well.227 Homicide cases were often settled elsewhere in the German 
cultural sphere in the sixteenth century, but in the seventeenth century the 
practice only remained in the most remote areas of the Empire.228 In line with 
the development in the Reich, the case of Lellepe Peet and Hans Wardi is the 
only settled homicide case I have found in the archives of the Livonian courts 
during the Swedish era. It may therefore be safe to contend that the case of 
Hans Wardi was something of a relic from the past &ndash; at least insofar as set-
tling homicide cases in court was concerned. Interestingly, in Sweden proper  
(that is, the area comprising roughly present-day Sweden and Finland), 
the settlements seem to have continued in use well into the second half of  
the seventeenth century.229
</p>
<p>However, as late as 1696, the District Court of Pernau, in session at Fellin, re-
ceived a manslaughter case in which settlement became an issue. The charges 
involved several allegations of violent crime, of which Parce Andres accused

und Sozialkontrolle im fr&uuml;hneuzeitlichen Territorialstaat (Frankfurt am Main: Vittorio 
Klostermann, 2005), 493, according to whom in early modern Kurmainz &ldquo;Waren Schaden-
ersatz, Opferentsch&auml;digung und Kostenersatz gew&auml;hrleistet, so fielen die Strafen &ndash; vor allem 
bei Gewalt &ndash; und Eigentumsdelikten einheimischer Delinquenten &ndash; meist milder aus.&rdquo;
</p>

Stiftung f&uuml;r Rechtsgeschichte: Germanistische Abteilung 122 (2005), 113&ndash;149, especially 
148&ndash;149. Settlements in homicide cases, again, need to be distinguished from the well-
known practice of commuting death sentences into more lenient punishments, com-
mon in the practice of the Livonian High Court as well as elsewhere in the seventeenth- 
century Swedish Realm. The Swedish legal language referred to this European-wide  
practice of extraordinary punishment (poena extraordinaria) as leuteration. Contrary to 
what has sometimes been claimed, poena extraordinaria (and leuteration) did not con-
ceptually mean commuting a death sentence to a milder one, but instead the term sim-
ply referred to deviating from the ordinary punishment. This could also be commuting 
a milder sentence to a harsher direction. For instance, the Council of Arensburg (on the 
island of Oesel) condemned Terriskiwi Michelstochter to death for infanticide in 1674. On 
22 January 1675 the High Court of Dorpat changed the woman&rsquo;s punishment to a harsher 
one, in that her body was to be burned (Protocollae votarum 1672&ndash;1675, 109.1.11, lva). Leu-
teration, thus, simply meant the referral of the sentence for a higher court&acute;s inspection. 
In practice this most often led to commuting death sentence to a fine, forced labour, or 
something else. It is another matter whether leuteration could be effectively enhanced by 
the fact that compensation had been paid to the victim.

</p>
<p>Kollope Andres and his relatives. As a result of the alleged violence, Andres 
claimed that his three-year-old boy had also accidentally died. From the point 
of view of legal settlements it is interesting to note that at one point in the pro-
ceedings, Andres mentioned that Puste Jasche had told him not to settle the 
case, but to bring it to court.230
</p>
<p>Jasche denied ever having given Parce Andres such advice. Two interesting 
details are nevertheless worth considering here. First, it seems that Andres had 
been willing to settle the killing of his son without court interference. Accord-
ing to Andres, Jasche seems to have thought that the case was too serious to 
be settled, whereas Jasche denies this in court, thus suggesting that the case 
might well have been settled. The sparse markings in the court protocol do 
not allow for decisive interpretations here. It is nevertheless significant that 
settling a manslaughter case was considered to be an option in the first place, 
even if no settlement was reached in this particular case.231 Second, it is impor-
tant to note here that Jasche was not just any neighbour. He was a law-finder 
(Rechtsfinder). It is therefore understandable that Jasche would have offered 
his advice, or that Kollope would even have asked him for it.
</p>
<p>Even though settlements in homicide cases are true rarities in the Livonian 
material, civil cases continued to be settled frequently, and so were petty crimi-
nal cases occasionally. Settlements were especially common in slander cases. 
David Grage vs. Michel Gende of 1641 at the District Court of Pernau is a typi-
cal example. David, a tailor, accused Michel, a foreman (Cubias) at a manor 
house, of slander. Michel had allegedly called David &ldquo;a villain&rdquo; (Schelm), and 
David asked Michel to prove his words before of the Court.232 Should he not be 
able to do so, David demanded that Michel be appropriately punished. When 
Michel then denied having called David names, the plaintiff marched a wit-
ness into the courtroom. The witness, &ldquo;a cook,&rdquo; told that he had indeed heard 
Michel say that when David had been &ldquo;loitering around villages,&rdquo; he had not 
done the work he had promised to do at the manor (where the cook probably 
served). Instead, David had been after alcohol (Ges&ouml;ff). When asked if he had 
any way of proving this, Michel told the Court that he did not, and &ldquo;that he did 
</p>

klagen.&rdquo; nae 915.1.8, f. 101&ndash;113.

ret&rdquo; in case new evidence might turn up.

</p>
<p>not have anything else to say about David.&rdquo; After this, David and Michel shook 
hands &ldquo;amicably&rdquo; and settled the case.233
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that these &ldquo;amicable settlements&rdquo; continued to be made 
throughout the Swedish period. Sometimes courts themselves actively pro-
moted peace between parties. On 20 January 1666, two brothers named Per and 
T&ouml;nnis were charged at the Town Court of Pernau with fighting (schl&auml;gerey) 
and causing each other &ldquo;gross injuries&rdquo; (&ldquo;grobe injurien&rdquo;), in addition to which 
the wives of both brothers had also taken part in the fight. Should they wish 
to avoid lashing, the brothers were &ldquo;seriously advised to withhold from [such 
behaviour] in the future&rdquo; (&ldquo;ernstlich vermahnet sich dergleichen hin kunfftig zu 
enthalten, bey vermeidung der ruthen&rdquo;). According to the protocol, the brothers 
then settled the case and shook hands (&ldquo;allerseit vertragen und ein ander die 
h&auml;nde gegeben&rdquo;).234
</p>
<p>As far as slander cases were concerned, the courts were thus particularly 
active in encouraging the parties to settle their arguments. The frequent use 
of different versions of the formula &ldquo;settled the case and shook hands&rdquo; shows 
well the courts&rsquo; view of themselves as guarantors of social peace. When on 
5 September 1662 the saddler&rsquo;s apprentice Johann von Brehmen accused the 
tailor Caspar Schindler and the glassmaker Johann Spelbing before the Lower 
Town Court of Pernau of slandering him, both of the accused directed a simi-
lar charge at Johann. As none of the charges could be proven properly, the 
court stated that &ldquo;since it has now turned out that neither party has slandered 
the other one, so let the apprentice immediately return to his work, and those 
having taken counter-charges [retorquenten] shall not take recourse to such 
charges, but should instead look for an ordinary judge.&rdquo; And so both the parties 
settled and shook hands with each other.235 On 13 December 1662, Johann Cas-
sel had summoned Johann Schmidt before the Lower Town Court of Dorpat 
to answer a slander case as well. According to Cassel, Schmidt had broken the 
peace at his home by calling him a rogue &ldquo;Schelm&rdquo; and a scoundrel &ldquo;Hundsvott&rdquo; 
in the presence of several other people. After hearing the witnesses, the Court 
</p>
<p>233 &ldquo;Dan er kunne ihm nicht ander&szlig; nachreden al&szlig; wa&szlig; der ehren vnd redligkeit geme&szlig; ist; hi-

nes unterlassen, daf&uuml;r aber den ordentlichen Richter suchen. Wurden also die Parten vertra-
gen und gaben einander die hande.&rdquo; &ldquo;To look for an ordinary judge&rdquo; probably means that, 
instead of having such easy recourse to counter-charges, defendants should raise cases on 
their own &ndash; if they had a case.</p>

<p>declared that since the accusing party had not been able to prove the gross 
injury, but had instead himself started to look like a suspect for the same crime, 
both parties were absolved. Therefore they &ldquo;both as town residents had the 
duty to settle the case soon.&rdquo;236
</p>
<p>When the Pernau Lower District Court sat at the Hostfershoff Manor House 
on 20 March 1688, the administrator of the Aydenhoff Manor House, Christian 
Winckelman, also came forward with a slander case. A peasant named Leuco 
Thomas had, according to Christian, accused him of taking unlawful advan-
tage of his position by selling the manor&rsquo;s corn on his own account and for 
his own benefit. Christian denied this and charged Thomas to step forward 
with evidence. Thomas could not produce any and was sentenced to 10 pairs 
of lashes. At this point Thomas and his wife turned to the court and asked it 
to spare Thomas from the punishment, because it might injure him. Winckel-
man, most probably personally, had already kept Thomas in irons for 14 days. 
&ldquo;The Administrator for a long while would not let this have any effect on him, 
but at last and after a pleading from [Thomas and his wife] and an interven-
tion by other peasants, he agreed that the [accused] would get off with only 
five pairs.&rdquo; The peasants, however, still did not give up. &ldquo;Because they still did 
not give up asking for a complete absolution of the punishment, and as the 
Court had him understand that it depended on him whether Thomas would 
remain unpunished or not, [the Administrator] agreed to Thomas&rsquo;s impunity 
this time, wherefore Thomas then lay down at his feet and thanked him for the 
pardon.&rdquo;237
</p>
<p>The case of Leuco Thomas represents well the kind of social involvement 
that Karl H&auml;rter has described in his studies concerning the court practice in 
early modern Kurmainz. Contrary to the picture sometimes conveyed in the 
older literature, the judge (or the accusing party) and the accused were not 
the only ones involved in criminal cases. Relatives, expert witnesses, adminis-
trative authorities, denunciators, advocates, and many other groups of people 
might have a stake in the proceedings.238 The more important the case and the

</p>
<p>more drastic the potential consequences of the trial, the more extra involve-
ment was to be expected.
</p>
<p>Another variant of settlement is worth presenting here because of the Chris-
tian element involved. In 1688, when the Pernau Lower Court held session on 
the island of Kyhn, Lieutenant Carl Friedrich Lilienfeld raised a case against 
a peasant called Jancken for slander. After it had been demonstrated by one 
witness (testis unicus) that Jancken had libelled Lilienfeld, he was ordered to 
take a purgatory oath. Jancken, however, confessed. He came back to the court 
room after the sentence ordering the purgatory oath had been pronounced, 
and told the court that &ldquo;he could free his consciensce of the possibility that he 
had inflicted some injuries&rdquo; on the plaintiff. Jancken had been so drunk that he 
could not remember what had happened. The Court now decided actively to 
pursue a settlement, telling the parties that &ldquo;the case was of the kind that the 
parties might want to see whether they could agree on a settlement.&rdquo; Jancken 
then offered to ask for &ldquo;Christian forgiveness&rdquo; before the Court, which Lilien-
feld accepted. The ritual was completed with a handshake and the aforemen-
tioned asking for Christian forgiveness.239
</p>
<p>Settlements were not always approved, however. In 1690 Prosecutor Philipp 
Schirm accused the steward of Kirbel Manor, Matthis Donau, of assault on 
Christoph Beckman, the steward of Moysekyla manor. According to the libel-
lum, the parties had settled the case after Beckman had asked the Court for a 
citation on Donau (&ldquo;in zwischen beyde theils hier&uuml;ber vereinbahret [&hellip;]&rdquo;). The 
settlement could not, however, override public interest (&ldquo;[&hellip;] so kan dennach 
dieser Vergleich dem Interesse public nichts derogieren, sondern verdienet billige 
bestrafung.&rdquo;). It may be that Schirm decided to prosecute for the assault, too, 
because he had already tried earlier to get Donau to answer to a fornication 
charge, for which Schirm was prosecuting again.240
</p>
<p>Early modern settlements of criminal cases survived for as long as they 
did in a procedural environment which was becoming increasingly hostile to  
arrangements that left too much say to the parties of the criminal cases them-
selves. This was the grand lineage of the medieval and early modern procedur-
al development. Even though the inquisitorial procedure was thus vigorously

<p>213The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>making its way in early modern Europe from the late Middle Ages onwards, 
there are great geographical and temporal variations to the theme. For in-
stance, the German regions most resistant to the Rezeption (mainly the ones 
in which Sachsenspiegel was relevant) were also resistant to the inquisitorial 
procedure. Even if the Bambergensis and the Carolina already provided for 
the inquisitorial procedure, local legislation still allowed for settlement agree-
ments (S&uuml;hnevertr&auml;ge) in the early seventeenth century. The up-and-coming 
inquisitorial procedure thus lived side by side with the archaic settlements of 
serious crime for a long time.241
</p>
<p>Is it possible to speak of a kind of Justiznutzung, or &ldquo;the use of law,&rdquo; in the 
way this term has been utilized in literature?242 It has been emphasized that 
the law was not only imposed on the parties from above, but that the people 
instead took advantage of the legal services of the community, thus converting 
courts into instruments with the help of which they could press the other party 
to yield concessions, settlement money, and other kinds of benefits. From the 
plaintiffs&rsquo; point of view, the aim was not necessarily to have the other party 
formally convicted, but it was to further other ends. The case of Leuco Thomas 
at least shows that the local populace could sometimes be actively involved in 
the court proceedings.
</p>
<p>The idea of Justiznutzung does not, however, describe well the settlements 
in the Livonian slander cases in general. For one thing, monetary settlements 
were rarely agreed upon or awarded. It seems that the plaintiff never got mate-
rial benefits from taking the case to court and settling it there. The case of Leu-
co Thomas is the only exception in the material, and even that case is from the 
very start of the Swedish era. Instead, the minutes convey a picture according 
to which it was the courts that actively promoted social peace by compelling 
the parties to settle their disagreement. The different variations of the formula 
according which the court had the parties shake each other&rsquo;s hands is telling 
in this respect. It is, of course, possible that settlement money could have been 
exchanged outside the courthouse without it being registered in the minutes. 
The protocols, however, contain no sign of this.
</p>
<p>Cases were settled regardless of whether there was evidence for slander or 
not. In some cases the minutes tell us that the case was clear, in others it was 
not. This also goes to show that it was important for the courts to secure social

<p>peace by getting rid of slander cases that threatened to disturb it. Although 
witnesses were occasionally heard in these cases, finding out what had actu-
ally happened in these cases was clearly of secondary importance compared 
to re-establishing peace.
</p>
<p>Slander cases were almost routinely settled in the Livonian town courts, 
but less often in the country courts. Few slander cases appeared in the district 
courts in the first place. After the 1640s, cases between peasants do not appear 
in the courts observed here; instead, pure peasant cases (be they slander cases 
or otherwise) were decided directly on the manors, probably by some kind of 
peasant court. Peasants normally appeared in the district courts only when the 
other party was of higher social rank (as was the case for Christian Winckel-
mann vs. Leuco Thomas). Slander cases between noble persons, then, seem to 
have been taken directly to the High Court of Dorpat, the forum privilegiatum 
of the nobility.243 This leaves us only with burghers and their municipal courts.
</p>
<p>Civil delicts, such as slander, were procedurally not distinguished from 
other civil cases in the Livonian practice, and there was no legal problem in 
settling them. In fact, the courts actively promoted the settling of these cases, 
suppressing charges and counter-charges whenever possible. Both inquisito-
rial procedure in the more serious cases and the settlements in the relatively 
harmless slander cases could thus be used to further social peace. Inquisitorial 
procedure and the settlements can then perhaps be interpreted as two sides 
of the same coin: the phenomenon that has been called the early modern ju-
dicial revolution.244 Bread and water was used, for instance, in slander cases, 
as when the soldier Hanss was convicted to four days prison with bread and 
water for calling Lorens Erichson a witch, without being able to show that his 
claim was true.245

<p>4.3.8 Summary: From Passive to Active Criminal Adjudication &ndash; and 
towards Gelehrtes Recht in Civil Law
</p>
<p>When the start of the Swedish period is compared to its end, two fundamen-
tal changes in criminal adjudication emerge. First, official prosecution at the 
lower courts became significantly more active towards the end of the century. 
The prosecutors were interested, above all, in cases that involved prohibited 
sexuality or which endangered public order in a narrow sense of the word, thus 
excluding regular violence and property crime. After the duel ordinances of 
the 1680s, prosecutors became active in pursuing duel cases against noblemen

<p>215The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>in the High Court. Second, the use of inquisitorial procedure increased. Cases 
in which the lower court figured as the other party &ndash; as it did in the inquisito-
rial procedure of the ius commune &ndash; do not appear in the early years but be-
come more frequent in the late seventeenth century. Inquisitorial procedure 
was almost exclusively used against peasants.
</p>
<p>Besides changes, there was also continuity. Pure accusatorial procedure, 
without a prosecutor, dominated the Livonian criminal proceedings through-
out the century. Accusatorial procedure was mainly used between social class-
es other than peasants. Cases of theft, violence, and slander were typically 
processed this way. Although the number of criminal cases processed purely 
accusatorially diminished dramatically in the years 1640&ndash;1641 compared to the 
years 1688&ndash;1690 at the Pernau Lower Court, accusatorial cases all but disap-
peared. This is especially the case if the prosecutor-driven accusatorial cases 
are added to the list. The Livonian lower court procedure was thus fundamen-
tally accusatorial throughout the Swedish period.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it should be emphasized that the ius commune proce-
dure was flexible by nature. What started as accusatorial procedure could end 
in the inquisitorial mode. As Schwarz remarked, it could sometimes depend on 
the prosecutor&rsquo;s whim whether he initiated a case as an accusatorial procedure 
or only denounced it, in which case the procedures could continue inquisitori-
ally. Sometimes the terminology wavered: a case could be introduced as actor 
officiosus vs. nn (thus, as an accusatorial case), and when the witnesses were 
heard the term &ldquo;inquisitorial article&rdquo; (articuli inquisitionales) is used.246
</p>
<p>According to the common scholarly opinion, the inquisitorial procedure 
took over from the accusatorial procedure in most of the central parts of Eu-
rope from early on. However, to what extent this is the general European story 
is doubtful. Research is still lacking, and much of the existing research is en-
tirely based on legal literature. Without archival research it is, however, dif-
ficult to say anything definitive about the use of the different modes of proce-
dure in other parts of Europe. This study has hopefully contributed something 
new to the discussion, showing that at least in seventeenth-century Livonia, 
accusatorial procedure had all but lost its importance.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of the Swedish rule, legal professionals as advocates re-
mained a rare sight in Livonian lower courts. Towards the middle of the seven-
teenth century, the lawyerly domination brought with it the learned procedure 
of the gemeines Recht and the ius commune. The procedure turned thus pre-
dominantly written. It started with the plaintiff &rsquo;s libellus, and continued with 
the defendant&rsquo;s replica, duplica, and so on. The briefs were customarily read

</p>
<p>out loud in court. The other party would then ask for a copy of the brief, and 
ask for a postponement in order to be able to prepare his next move. The pro-
cedures advanced slowly and the charges were often dropped at some point.
</p>
<p>The lawyer-dominated nature of the civil proceedings not only brought with 
it the gemeines Recht proceedings but also the gemeines Recht legal sources, as 
lawyers often referred to Corpus iuris civilis, especially the Digest, and some-
times also to ius commune scholarship. The lawyerization of the urban courts 
took longer, but had evolved into a fact by at least the 1660s as well.
</p>
<p>4.4 The Cases and the Procedure at the High Court of Dorpat
</p>
<p>4.4.1 The Cases and Their Handling at the Court: An Appeals Instance or a 
First-Instance Court?
</p>
<p>The Swedish high courts had two functions. Besides being courts of appeal, 
they served in some types of cases as courts of first instance for the nobility, a 
forum privilegiatum, in which noblemen judged their peers. The Dorpat High 
Court also fulfilled both these functions. The legislative basis of the Court&rsquo;s 
position as the court of the nobility was the Hofgerichtsordnung of 1632. In 
Sweden proper (today&rsquo;s Sweden and Finland), the appeals function of the high 
courts was the main feature, compared to the first-instance function. As Mia 
Korpiola has recently shown, however, this was not the case in the Svea High 
Court during its early years, but the situation was soon reversed.247
</p>
<p>The Dorpat High Court, in turn, was predominantly a first-instance court 
throughout the Swedish period. It is understandable that the Court received 
only two appeals cases out of 36 in its first year (1630) of functioning. The num-
ber of appeals, however, remained low even after that: in 1631, there were two 
appeals out of 58 cases; in 1632, three out of 25; and in 1633, one out of 19. Dur-
ing the first ten years (1630&ndash;1639), the Court had 382 cases, of which only 26 
were appeals. The number of appeals then started to rise slightly: in 1640 the 
corresponding figures were 10 out of 32 and in 1650, 10 out of 42. For the rest of 
the Swedish reign, the number of appeals stayed more or less at this level. In 
1670 there were still only 33 appeal cases out of 98; in 1680, 32 out of 94 cases 
were appeal cases; and in 1690, eighteen out of 63. In 1697, the number of ap-
peals was slightly higher (28 out of 58), but remained as under half of all new 
cases at the High Court.248

<p>217The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Why was the Dorpat High Court so different? First, the proportion of noble-
men in Livonia was significantly higher than elsewhere in the Swedish realm, 
which can be presumed to have contributed to the significance of the Dorpat 
High Court as a court of first instance. Second, not only were there more noble-
men in Livonia than elsewhere in the realm, but in Livonia peasants &ndash; the larg-
est bulk of the population &ndash; were practically barred from appealing their cases 
to the High Court. As was explained above, peasants with their civil cases did 
not figure even in the lower courts, because they had their cases handled in the 
manorial courts &ndash; from which no appeal was possible. The Dorpat High Court 
thus received both in absolute and relative terms fewer appeals than the other 
high courts in the Swedish realm.
</p>
<p>The caseload of the High Court of Dorpat concentrated on certain kinds of 
cases. Land quarrels of different kinds figured among the most numerous in 
the four years which we have under scrutiny (1630, 1640, 1650, and 1682). This 
was especially so in the early period, which is understandable given the some-
what chaotic situation after the wars preceding the Swedish conquest. Thus, in 
1630, 18 out of 36 cases were land disputes. Of the 32 cases in 1640, 14 had to do 
with land. In 1650 the corresponding figures were 19/42, compared to 13/86 in 
1682. Injuria, both verbal and corporal, were also frequent: 5/36, 7/32, 3/42, and 
14/86. The third group which stood out was payment demands: 7/36, 5/32, 3/42, 
15/86. Inheritance cases were little more than an isolated phenomenon: 2/36, 
3/32, 4/42, and 6/86. Register, put together by Bruiningk in the first years of 
twentieth century, suggests that the number of cases coming to the High Court 
arose with the years. In 1630, 36 cases were on the Court&rsquo;s docket; in 1640, 32; 
and in 1650, 42. In 1670 we already have 98 cases and 94 in 1680.249
</p>
<p>By far the most numerous criminal cases were the injuria ones, handled ac-
cusatorially, of course. Other criminal cases concerning noblemen were rari-
ties, given the fact that it was extremely difficult for the authorities to bring 
noblemen to court against their will. In 1640, only one case of embezzlement 
figures in the docket.
</p>
<p>The procedure at the Court can best be described as oral and written at 
the same time &ndash; the procedures were thus similar to those at the district 
courts. A typical day at the Court consisted of the following types of business. 
Lawyers would show up to present their cases, which, given the frequent 
postponements, had advanced to different phases. Some were first-instance cases,  
</p>
<p>lhg 109.2.I&ndash;III. The protocol books exist for years 1666&ndash;75 and 1684&ndash;96 and the decision 
books for the years 1666&ndash;69, 1672, and 1693&ndash;94.

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>others appeals. The parties were practically always represented by lawyers, 
of which there were usually four or five active at any one given time at the 
Court.250 The handling of the case began with the plaintiff &rsquo;s lawyers present-
ing the case by reading his justificatio appellationis or libellus out loud and 
then handing it in ad acta, for the record. The defendant&rsquo;s lawyer would then 
ask for the copy and usually deliver his own exceptio the next time the case 
came up on the docket. The subsequent procedural phases, replica and du-
plica, followed the same pattern.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the High Court Prosecutor (Oberfiscal) would present his cases &ndash;  
accusatorial, first-instance and against noblemen, and it would proceed in a 
similar way to the civil cases. In civil cases and the accusatorial cases, most of 
the legal discussion took place in the written statements of the lawyers. Proce-
dural claims were an exception, at times discussed viva voce and recorded in 
the protocol.251
</p>
<p>A presenting judge prepared the draft decisions, which were sometimes 
copied in the protocols. After the presenting judge had read his proposal aloud, 
the other judges expressed their opinion, with a vote sometimes taking place.
</p>
<p>The actual criminal cases (serious crimes, criminalia, those carrying a cor-
poral punishment) would be usually handled in larger groups, typically around 
ten cases at a time, one after another. Criminal cases left very little by way of 
text in the protocols, largely because no lawyers were involved. Another reason 
was that the procedure of leuteration252 was light. Leuteration often entailed 
no more than a summary revision of the lower court document, with judges 
only signing approbat (&ldquo;approve&rdquo;) and their name on the front cover of the 
lower court&rsquo;s decision.
</p>
<p>4.4.2 The High Court as a Court of First Instance
As mentioned above, land disputes, inheritance cases, and payment demands 
formed the bulk of the High Court&rsquo;s daily work. They were mostly first-instance 
cases between noblemen, because civil cases between peasants were decided 
in manorial courts and could not be appealed anywhere. The few appeals cases 
</p>
<p>250 In 1695, for instance, four lawyers dominated the business of the Court: Spalchaber, 
Landenberg, Heinen, and Dieterici. Two others, Schultz and Eggerdes, represented clients 
as well, but the four other ones appeared in court on a daily basis. Protocollum votarum

<p>219The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>that reached the High Court were civil cases (including accusatorial ones) in 
which a town burgher, soldier, or a member of some other group, neither noble 
or peasant, was a party. Another important group of first-instance cases were 
those in which the public prosecutor (Oberfiskal at the High Court) prosecuted 
noblemen. The trend is clear, and again similar to that in the lower courts: the 
number of prosecutor-driven cases increased with time. These cases were ac-
cusatorial, not inquisitorial: the prosecutor thus had fewer procedural weap-
ons at his disposal than when a case proceeded inquisitorially. If the defendant 
refused to show up, which was often the case, he or she could be declared con-
tumax and eventually sentenced to pay fines. Should he or she refuse to pay, 
there was little that they could do.
</p>
<p>An example of a typical prosecutor-driven, accusatorial case at the High 
Court was the Royal Prosecutor (K&ouml;nigl. Oberfiscal) Christoff Wagner vs. Gus-
tav Adolph Boldt. Wagner accused Boldt of the killing of Matthias Lampsius 
in 1682. The Governor-General Christer Horn had decided on 15 February 1682 
that the accused would not be kept in custody, granting him a salvum conduc-
tum. On 28 November 1682 the Court issued the citation, according to which 
Boldt was to appear in court on 29 January 1683. He did not appear, but instead 
sent a letter, in which he claimed to be innocent and asked for permission to 
prove his innocence through witnesses and documents, as his health did not 
allow him to come to court himself. The prosecutor was not convinced: Wag-
ner begged the Court not to let Boldt proceed in writing. After all, this was a 
homicide case, and it was thus not &ldquo;in the interest of the crown&rdquo; (observierung 
des interesse regii) to let the accused get away in such a way. Instead, he should 
be convicted for contumacy. The procedure continued entirely in writing until 
the High Court&rsquo;s decision on 14 February 1685, after six briefs from the accused 
and three from the prosecutor. The prosecutor&rsquo;s evidence consisted of an in-
vestigation conducted by the army in 1681 and written versions of statements 
by witnesses heard in lower courts. The final outcome of the case is unfortu-
nately not known.253
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the sheer changes in the number of prosecutor-driven cases 
and their breakdown into different categories reveal rather a lot about the in-
terests of the early modern state. The first prosecutor-driven case at the High 
Court was High Court Prosecutor (Oberfiskal) Christoph Mebild vs. Heinrich 
Abel Ziegenmeyer on 16 October, 1630, and it was about excessive violence 
against peasants. According to Bruiningk&rsquo;s register, there were 28 prosecu-
torial cases in 1630&ndash;1639. In 1640, the higher court prosecutor had no cases

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>chapter 4220
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>at the High Court, but ten years later (1650), there were four (manslaughter,  
violent behaviour, violent behaviour in the house of the court bailiff, and vio-
lent behaviour in connection to the financial exaction of the state etc.). The 
basic interests of the prosecutor already show in these early cases: his activities 
were about cases which included a dimension of public interest. Killing ful-
filled this criterion, but so did cases in which a royal interest or servants were 
directly violated, as in the case of the bailiff.
</p>
<p>After mid-century, these trends become even clearer. In 1670 there were 12 
prosecutor cases, 12 in 1680, and in 1690, 14 cases. Some of the crimes that fig-
ure among these include disobedience against superiors (Halsstarrigkeit ge-
gen Obrigkeit), unlawful arrest (widerrechtliche Arrestierung), misuse of public 
power (Missbrauch der Amtsgewalt), unlawful fishing (unberechtigte Fischerei), 
unauthorized use of the title of lieutenant colonel (Anwendung des Oberstltns. 
Titel), and destruction of judicial documents (Misshandeln eines Gerichtsak-
tes), in addition to common crimes.254
</p>
<p>Duels formed an important subgroup of the first-instance cases in the early 
years of the 1680s. Bruiningk&rsquo;s register shows a concentration of duel cases dur-
ing the first half of the 1680s. In 1681&ndash;85 there were 20 cases, in contrast to 
the five cases in 1671&ndash;75, none in 1676&ndash;80, three in 1686&ndash;90 and again none in 
1691&ndash;95.255 Some duel cases had already appeared earlier in the seventeenth 
century.256 But why was there such a large concentration of cases in the early 
1680s? A new Duel Placate was issued in 1682,257 serving as a legislative back-
ground to the campaign against duelling. Legislation alone hardly explains  
the craze, however. Following European models,258 duels had already been

<p>outlawed in 1662,259 and the campaign had already begun in 1681, when 10 duel 
cases were prosecuted.
</p>
<p>It is not a coincidence that the reduction in the land possessions of the no-
bility in Livonia started to be planned in the same year and went into effect the 
following year.260 The reduction was part of King Charles ix&rsquo;s so-called Great 
Reduction, which was meant to improve the financial situation of the crown. 
Most of the noble enfeoffments and donations were restored to the crown. The 
reduction was put into effect everywhere in the realm, putting the law of the 
realm vis-&agrave;-vis provincial law, which meant that in Livonia the restitution was 
done without consulting the Landtag. This greatly severed the relations be-
tween the crown and the Livonian nobility, despite the fact that the restitution 
concerned the enfeoffments of Swedish noblemen in Livonia as well. These 
made up about 50 per cent of all the noble possessions in the province.261 The 
curtailment of duelling habits fits this picture well: it can be interpreted as an 
additional strike against the special status of noblemen.
</p>
<p>The office of the Oberfiskal was clearly one of the most important ones pro-
tecting the interests of the crown in the province. It therefore does not come 
as a surprise that the crown took great interest in filling the post with a Swede 
after the death of Oberfiskal Christopher Wagner had left the position vacant. 
Contrary to the crown&rsquo;s interest, the High Court found it more important that 
the new prosecutor knew German and was familiar with Livonian law.262 
Again, this tells something of how little the reception of Swedish law had in 
fact advanced, even at the end of the century.

<p>notorious.263 Thus, in the infanticide case of Maye in the Pernau Comital Court 
(1641), the court proceeded immediately to the capital punishment.264 The Co-
mital Court of Pernau was, as stated above, an exception even in Livonia.
</p>
<p>In Swedish (and Livonian) procedural law, lower court sentences in capital 
cases were never final, but were instead always referred to a high court for fi-
nal approval (the so-called leuteration).265 Leuteration could lead to deviation 
from the letter of the law, either to a harsher or to a more lenient result. In 
practice, leuteration almost always meant that, instead of capital punishment, 
a more lenient punishment (such as forced labour, extradition, or fines) was 
used.
</p>
<p>According to the Swedish Procedural Ordinance of 1614, the High Court 
(Svea being the only one at the time) had the right to decide capital cases only 
if the king was travelling out of the country or if the High Court wished to 
confirm a capital punishment given by a lower court. In all other situations, 
the crown reserved the right to confirm capital punishment.266 In principle, 
the High Court could thus not deviate from a statutory capital punishment 
because of mitigating circumstances. In practice, the high court took more lib-
erties, arbitrating death sentences extensively. In 1641, the high courts then re-
ceived a formal right to arbitrate sentences whenever the circumstances were 
similar as in the cases in which the crown itself had previously deviated from 
statutory punishment.267
</p>
<p>The statute of 1641 thus legalised leuteration at the high courts in Sweden. 
The legal status of leuteration remained, however, a problem well into the 
eighteenth century. In 1653 the high court practice was extended to the lower

himself had pronounced it. At least by 1643, leuteration had come to be understood as a 
privilege of the high courts. See Thunander, G&ouml;ta Hovr&auml;tt, 198.

<p>courts, which also acquired the right to deviate from the strict letter of the 
law.268 This changed again in 1672 and 1674 when King Charles xi ordered that 
both high and lower courts would have to follow the written law stricte.269 De-
spite Charles&rsquo;s law, the high courts kept leuterating the sentences. No wonder, 
thus, that Charles returned to the question in 1684, stating that the high courts&rsquo; 
way of &ldquo;judging according to conscience&rdquo; was a problem, and that they would 
&ldquo;in civil and criminal matters stricte go according to the law and [the king&rsquo;s] 
statutes.&rdquo;270 Even after this, the practice of mitigating sentences continued in 
the high courts.
</p>
<p>King Charles xii, who had taken a firm stand on judicial affairs, again for-
bade deviating from statutory punishment, or leuteration, in 1699. The King 
had observed &ldquo;with miscontent [&hellip;] that [the high courts] had mitigated sen-
tences more than to what law and circumstances would have given reason.&rdquo; 
The application of mitigating circumstances was, once again, to be left to the 
king alone.271
</p>
<p>According to Thunander&rsquo;s study, the G&ouml;ta High Court at least did not effec-
tively observe the prohibition.272 The Dorpat High Court, however, seems to 
have sent their capital cases systematically to Stockholm after King Charles&rsquo;s 
statute was issued in March 1699.273 Apparently, the prohibition did not work 
in practice, since in 1714 the high courts were again given the right to mitigate 
capital sentences. This time, the permission remained in force until the great 
changes of the nineteenth century.274
</p>
<p>Whereas the statute of 1641 allowed for leuteration by high court in Sweden 
proper, in Livonia the institution of leuteration was already made legal in lgo 
1632 Art. xxiv. It stated that all lower courts decisions which concerned cases

<p>carrying the death penalty (&ldquo;hochpoenliche&rdquo;), such as incest, sodomy, rape, 
infanticide, and intentional homicide, should be sent to the High Court for 
approval.
</p>
<p>In the leuteration procedure, the high court could either confirm the sen-
tence, or mitigate or harshen it. The procedure took place on the basis of docu-
ments only, and the accused had no chance to react or speak for himself. It was 
essentially a matter of revising lower court sentences, although in practice it 
became an automatic way of mitigating death sentences to lesser punishment 
in certain types of crimes.
</p>
<p>Neither the prosecutor nor the parties had the opportunity to have their say 
regarding the lower court&rsquo;s decision. The leuteration procedure was not an ap-
peals system in disguise. The review was a summary procedure, the function 
of which in Sweden proper has become quite clear in previous scholarship. It 
may well be assumed that the purpose was to maintain the preventive value of 
death punishment at the lower court level, whereas the High Court could then 
show its benevolence through leuteration.
</p>
<p>As discussed above, the patroness of the Court, Countess Magdalena von 
Thurn, did not acknowledge the authority of the royal high court over the de-
cisions of her court. The Countess finally gave in (see above), but in the other 
Livonian lower courts the leuteration procedure was introduced from as early 
as records begin. In July 1641, the case in which three accused men were sen-
tenced to death and one to deportation was submitted to the High Court of 
Dorpat. The High Court approved of the sentence, which was carried out in 
September.275 The other lower courts adjusted to the leuteration procedure 
without complaint.
</p>
<p>Because of the lack of archives from the lower courts in this period, we can-
not confirm whether the Livonian courts took advantage of the possibility of 
more creative punishment in the 1650s and 1660s. In 1670&ndash;72, the High Court of 
Dorpat received 14 criminal cases from the lower courts. The cases represented 
a wide range of serious crimes (infanticide, manslaughter, uxoricide, theft, for-
nication, and disobedience of soldiers). The number of serious criminal cas-
es sent for review to the High Court from the lower courts varied somewhat: 
for instance, in 1675 (from January to September), 25 cases were reviewed.276  
A little over twenty years later, the number of cases was larger, a total of 77 cas-
es, including 22 infanticide cases, six sodomy cases, five adultery cases, seven 
homicide cases, seven cases of incest, and seven of theft.277 In the archive of

<p>225The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>the Dorpat High Court we have a list of the reviewed criminal cases from the 
years 1695&ndash;1703. The High Court reviewed 263 cases in those years, and with 
only one exception all these cases had ended in a capital punishment in the 
lower court. A vast majority were approved in the High Court: for instance, 
in 1695 the Court &ldquo;approved totally&rdquo; 13 out of 19 cases. In the cases in which 
the Court changed the lower court sentence, a clear policy can be observed. 
In almost all of the cases, a death punishment was altered to whipping and 
extradition.
</p>
<p>For instance, in a case concerning &ldquo;violent behaviour&rdquo; (Gewaltt&auml;tigkeit), the 
capital punishment was changed to &ldquo;twenty pairs of whips administered by the 
headsman and an lifelong extradition after that&rdquo; (&ldquo;zwanzig Paar Ruthen vom 
Scharfrichter gestrichen und darauf des Landes ewig verwiesen sollte&rdquo;; 18 May 
1695). In another case of fratricide (fratricidium), the accused was condemned 
to essentially the same punishment, although the terminology employed dif-
fered from the previous example (&ldquo;extraordinaria poena, nemlich fustigatione 
enim relegatione&rdquo;). In the latter example, we see how the contemporary Livoni-
an lawyers equated leuteratio with poena extraordinaria.278 When on 25 April 
1674 the Dorpat Lower Court had condemned a peasant called J&uuml;rgen to have 
his right ear cut off and to deportation for assault and battery, the High Court 
commuted the sentence to 30 pairs of whips (&ldquo;scharpfe Hausdisciplin [&hellip;] mit 
30. Paar Ruthen&rdquo;).279
</p>
<p>As stated above, the leuteration procedure consisted of a summary inspec-
tion on the basis of documents.280 The work was sometimes done swiftly, and 
the parties had no opportunity to comment on the lower court decision. For 
instance, the Council of Arensburg (on the island of Oesel) had condemned 
Terriskiwi Michelstochter to death for infanticide and Daniel Sommer for the 
same crime to a fine of 100 thalers. The council decision was made on 7 Decem-
ber 1674. By 22 January 1675 the High Court had already reached its own deci-
sion. Interestingly, the woman&rsquo;s punishment was changed to a harsher one, in 
that her body was to be burned; the man&rsquo;s fine, in turn, was lowered to 80 thal-
ers.281 When the reviewed case came from a lower court geographically close 
to the High Court, the High Court could be extremely quick. Thus when the 
District Court of Dorpat on 23 April 1765 condemned both Siwert Hauss and 
Porman Knut Hinrich to death &ndash; for separate crimes, Siwert for homicide and 
</p>
<p>deportation and 40 pairs of lashes lva 109.1.8, in 1673&ndash;75, the High Court handled 11 cases 
by way of leuteration and in 1692&ndash;1693 a total of 72 cases.

approbiret) already on 1 May.282
</p>
<p>The review is not to be confused with appeal, which &ndash; in accordance with 
the contemporary ius commune doctrine283 &ndash; were forbidden in criminal cases. 
When seen in the context of European ius commune, the Saxon-Swedish leu-
teration can be understood as a variant of extraordinary punishment. It was 
thus a way of departing from the punishment (poena ordinaria), when attenu-
ating (or in principle also aggravating) circumstances were at hand. Like ex-
traordinary punishment, the statutory punishment could be either mitigated 
or harshened. In other kinds of crimes, which did not go through leuteration, 
the punishment was often administered immediately. Thus when, at Pernau 
Lower Court in 1696, Puju Jack confessed to assaulting and wounding Jasche 
Matz, and was therefore sentenced to 12 pairs of lashes, the punishment was 
administered immediately.284
</p>
<p>The prohibition of appeals concerned only proper criminal cases, in other 
words those in which the mode of procedure was inquisitorial. Appeals were, 
however, allowed in accusatorial criminal cases just as in regular civil cases. In 
1640, two of the ten appeals cases were accusatorial criminal cases, both deal-
ing with slander. The rest of the appealed cases in that year were civil cases, 
dealing with issues such as disputed land, fishing rights, and tort payments.285
</p>
<p>When the tenant (Arrendator on Luhde Manor) Elias Diricksen was convict-
ed to a fine of 20 thalers for unlawfully obstructing the construction of the tav-
ern (Krug) on Colonel Caspar Ermiss&rsquo;s lands, both parties appealed. Diricksen 
was also ordered to return to Ermiss the same number of refuse bins that had 
removed from the construction site.286 When a civil case was appealed, the ap-
pellant was to inform the court of his intention to appeal. This often occurred im-
mediately after the trial and was recorded (protestatio). If the other party made 
a similar request (reprotestatio), it was also recorded. The appellant placed a 
surety (Appellationspfenning) and was ordered to lodge his appeal &ldquo;at the next

sible for the consequences.&rdquo;287
</p>
<p>The distribution of appeals cases between the different lower courts does 
not produce surprises but was more or less even. For instance, from the ap-
peals cases in 1650 three came from the District Court of Kokenhusen, one 
from the Distirct Court of Wenden, one from the Town Court of Wenden, one 
from the Town of Riga, one from the District Court of Riga, and three from the 
District Court of Dorpat. Decisions of commissorial courts could also some-
times be appealed to the High Court.288
</p>
<p>The High Court of Dorpat supervised the lower courts in several ways other 
ways as well. The high court prosecutor (Obergerichtsfiskal) routinely super-
vised the workings of the lower courts and, when needed, would resort to cor-
rectional measures. The responsibility of sending court books yearly to the 
High Court for inspection was in use in Livonia as well as in Sweden proper. 
The Court actively watched the lower courts and sent circulars and rescripts to 
them. Some of these documents were directed to the lawyers, who were also 
under the judicial supervision of the courts.289
</p>
<p>Many of the &ldquo;constitutions, publications, and circularies&rdquo; concerned advo-
cates and their behaviour. The Court issued an Ordinance on Advocates and 
Parties (Advocaten &ndash; und Parten-Ordinanz) in 1646, giving precise orders of 
how wide the margins were to be left in documents handed to the courts and 
how many lines of writing were allowed per page. Financial reasons were the 
most important here, because each page handed over to the court was taxed. 
The Advocates Ordinance also contained behavioural norms, warning the ad-
vocates against presenting excessively personal remarks, or from engaging in 
&ldquo;philosophical or political discourses.&rdquo; A disobedient advocate would risk a dis-
cretionary punishment or a rejection of his brief.290

</p>
<p>289 Happily, the &ldquo;constitutions, publications, and circularies&rdquo; of the Court were conveniently 
edited and published by Professor Oswald Schmidt in 1875. His main source was the so-
called Brown Book at the High Court&rsquo;s archive, but Schmidt also added some manuscripts

<p>4.5 The Revision Procedure
</p>
<p>In 1865, the Swedish historian C.T. Odhner wrote that Queen Christina&rsquo;s regen-
cy in the 1630s &ldquo;was often disappointed at the Livonian High Court in Dorpat: 
it was difficult from such a distance to exercise sufficient control and despite 
the fact that some Swedes always sat there as judges, this high court showed 
great disposition towards the German legal order.&rdquo; It was therefore considered 
whether the High Court should be replaced with two lawman&rsquo;s courts, which 
in the Swedish judicial hierarchy were situated between lower courts and high 
courts but for civil cases only.291
</p>
<p>Despite these worries and the suggestions of the early years, nothing came 
of the plans. The Swedish crown never acquired systematic control over its 
high courts in Livonia or elsewhere in the realm, nor were ordinary remedies 
available for those dissatisfied with high court decisions. The only remedies 
available were extraordinary. Two kinds existed. First, it was possible to ap-
ply for a pardon against high court decisions in criminal cases. Although early 
modern legal scholarship and statutory law separated the pardon from the 
crown&rsquo;s other judicial function, in practice the difference was not always clear, 
because high courts automatically remitted their death sentences for the ap-
proval of the crown, who then acted &ldquo;out of mercy.&rdquo;292 In civil cases, those in-
volving &ldquo;land, goods, and money&rdquo; (&ldquo;jord, gods och penningar&rdquo;), a legal remedy 
called beneficium revisionis was at the disposal of a party unsatisfied with a 
high court decision. Although the theoretical difference between criminal and 
civil cases was still not always clear in the seventeenth century,293 as a practi-
cal rule the courts held on to the distinction.294 The beneficium was the logical

<p>229The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era

</p>
<p>result of a political system, in which the king theoretically kept all judicial 
power, although he had delegated substantial parts of it to the high courts.
</p>
<p>The revision was regulated in the Hofgerichtsordnung (&sect; 35) and the Royal 
Resolution of 1634 (K&ouml;nigliche Resolution vom 6. August 1634; &sect; 4).295 The revi-
sion cases were decided in the Council of the Realm (riksr&aring;det), either in its 
plenary session or in a special section called the Judicial Revision (justitiere-
visionnen) or Higher Revision (&ouml;vre revisionen). The Lower Revision, in turn, 
consisted of the administrative entity preparing the cases for revision.296 The 
model for the institution of revision came from Germany, where in the six-
teenth century in &ldquo;unappealable&rdquo; cases a &ldquo;supplication&rdquo; or &ldquo;revision&rdquo; could still 
be requested from the territorial prince. If revision was granted, it was based 
on a review of the acts (Revision der Akten), without a new oral hearing.297
</p>
<p>Another variant of the revision procedure emerged as an intermediary 
phase before the Resolution of 1634. The decisions of the high courts operat-
ing in the duchies and the provinces (thus, the Courts in Dorpat, Turku, and 
Wismar) could be revised at the Svea High Court. The court against which the 
revision was directed would send a delegation to Stockholm in order to defend 
the high court&rsquo;s decision at the Svea Court. Sometimes one of the Councillors 
of the Realms could act as an arbitrator between the Svea High Court and the 
other high courts. This procedure seems, however, to have been an intermedi-
ary phase only. After the Svea High Court consolidated its place within the 
Swedish court hierarchy and the revision as a sort of highest instance was fixed 
in the Resolution of 1634, the position of Svea as a primus inter pares of the 
high courts began to mean less and less.298

judges at the same time) did take part in deciding revision cases, especially during the 
king&rsquo;s absences abroad. At times, Svea judges decided, on revision, cases they had previ-
ously decided at the High Court. This, however, came to an end during Axel Oxenstierna&rsquo;s </p>

<p>Parties had no absolute right to have their case reviewed. According to the 
Procedural Ordinance of 1615 (R&auml;tteg&aring;ngsprocessen), the king granted benefi-
cium not &ldquo;through an appeal but through a petition for mercy&rdquo; (&ldquo;genom n&aring;got 
v&auml;djande utan genom &ouml;dmjuk b&ouml;neskrift&rdquo;).299 In practice, though, revision grad-
ually came to be understood as more or less of a right as the petitions became a 
mass phenomenon. The increase in their number also gave rise to discussions 
on how to institutionalize their handling.300
</p>
<p>The need to institutionalize the legal institution that had grown in prac-
tice led to the Placate on the Revision of Legal Cases of 1662. Even though the 
procedures were now formalized in the letter of the law, the revision was ac-
cording to the statute still not intended to be a regular appeal or &ldquo;some new 
instance.&rdquo; Instead, it was only an &ldquo;examen actorum prioris instantiae.&rdquo; No  
new documental evidence was allowed, although the Placate did allow for a 
new hearing (&ldquo;afd&ouml;mda akters &ouml;fverseende och nogare f&ouml;rh&ouml;r&rdquo;). Unlike in ap-
peal, no new arguments were allowed either. If neither of the parties asked for 
revision, the high court decision was left intact. The crown&rsquo;s control was thus 
passive, a kind of &ldquo;institutionalized feedback.&rdquo;301
</p>
<p>As the letter of the High Court of Dorpat mentioned above suggests, the 
pressures to treat revision as appeal had been present from early on. In prac-
tice, and in spite of the 1662 Placate, revision came to resemble a regular ius 
commune appeal more and more as time passed.302 Even new arguments were 
tolerated if the party claimed that they had not been able to present them at an 
earlier stage &ndash; which Almquist calls &ldquo;a Swedish modification of the strict rules 
of the [&hellip;] Roman-canon procedure.&rdquo;303
</p>
<p>Although a thorough, archive-based study of the seventeenth-century ap-
peals and revision procedures in Sweden is still lacking, Almquist&rsquo;s character-
ization sounds intuitively correct. A working Roman-canon or ius commune 
</p>
<p>time in the 1640s. The practice, initially linked to the unclear judicial hierarchy, ended as 
the revision procedures were better organized from the mid-century onwards, culminat-
ing in the founding of the Supreme Court in 1789. Thus the fact that the Svea judges took 
part in the revision procedures in some cases did not elevate the court above the others 
in the hierarchy either de facto or in a formal manner.

<p>231The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>appeals system with strictly enforced preclusion rules does not work without 
a sufficient amount of legal learning at all levels of the judicial system: learned 
lawyers as judges to enforce the rules and learned advocates as watchdogs. 
These were still largely lacking in seventeenth-century Sweden, which prob-
ably led to a rather lax attitude towards strict preclusion rules.304
</p>
<p>It is also difficult to see whose interest strict rules of preclusion would have 
served. The drafters of the Procedural Ordinance of 1615 still thought that the 
royal high court would take of most (if not all) of king&rsquo;s judicial business.305 
This soon proved to be far from realistic as revision petitions started to pour 
into the Royal Chancery. In the second half of the century, it was certainly in 
the crown&rsquo;s interest not to be too selective as to the cases allowed for revision, 
if the aim was a realm-wide uniformity of legal practice. A logical step in the 
development was the requirement of the Form of Government of 1772 that the 
members of the Higher Revision had judicial experience. In 1789 the Higher 
Revision was then reorganized and renamed the Supreme Court.306
</p>
<p>The revision procedure can be observed through the protocols of the Coun-
cil of the Realm. The procedure followed, mutatis mutandis, the Swedish lower 
court procedure. After the supplicant had first received the king&rsquo;s permis-
sion (beneficium), the Council sent citations to both the defendant and the  
high court. Both of them appeared before the Council, either personally or 
represented by a lawyer, and the proceedings were largely oral. The council 
members &ndash; the king or the queen included &ndash; asked questions, and the parties 
answered. After a few sessions, the Council announced its decision.307
</p>
<p>The high courts were thus summoned to the Council of the Realm to an-
swer to the complaints of the appellant. The High Court of Dorpat complained 
bitterly about the burden. In a letter drafted by Judge Georg Stiernhielm to

hundradet till stadf&auml;stelsen af 1734 &aring;rs lag (Stockholm: Nordstedt &amp; S&ouml;ner, 1850). It was 
only from 1772 onwards that the members of the Higher Revision members were required 
to have &ldquo;judicial experience,&rdquo; and even this did not mean that they needed to have legal 
education. More than anything, the members were chosen for political reasons. To be 
sure, by the late eighteenth century the Lower Revision already had legal expertise in its 
ranks.

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>the King in July 1636, the Court asked to be spared the trip to Stockholm. The 
Court argued that the High Court Ordinance said nothing of such a duty, which 
was &ldquo;nowhere in use&rdquo;308 (nirgends br&auml;uchlich). The judges refer here clearly to 
the practice of corresponding high courts in other countries. The Court goes 
on to claim that the judges did enough for their office, when they heard the 
case, wrote the judgment and pronounced it; they should not be bothered with 
anything else. Whatever else which might result could be taken care of in writ-
ing. The Court also maintained that the judges lived far apart from each other, 
many of them having care of more than one office, and besides, the Court was 
far away (&ldquo;zu Waszer vnd lande weit entlegen&rdquo;) which made trips to Stockholm 
expensive. All this tended to diminish the authority of the Court. The Court re-
minded the crown that revision procedures should be based on the high court 
case files alone anyway, so that &ldquo;no new allegations, documents, and evidence&rdquo; 
be added. If these were nevertheless allowed, revision would turn into appeal. 
According to the Court, the reason to &ldquo;cut further appeals from the high courts 
to the crown&rdquo; had been precisely this: &ldquo;to amputate the legal cases, liberating 
the Realm of that dangerous, gloomy pest of commonwealths.&rdquo;309
</p>
<p>In August of 1636, President Johan Ulrich and Judge Georg Stiernhielm nev-
ertheless appeared before the Council of the Realm in Stockholm to represent 
the Dorpat High Court in several cases which had been allowed revision. The 
judges had taken the trip &ldquo;regardless of all incommodities,&rdquo; (&ldquo;oansedt alle in-
commoditeter&rdquo;) and despite it causing them &ldquo;great trouble&rdquo; (&ldquo;itt stortt besv&auml;r&rdquo;). 
On behalf of the Council, Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna thanked the delegation 
for making the arduous trip, from which the government &ldquo;would readily have 
saved them.&rdquo; However, the pertinent cases were of such importance that the 
help of the Dorpat judges was absolutely necessary, so that &ldquo;justice could be 
done&rdquo; (&ldquo;g&ouml;ra een richtigheet&rdquo;).310 The visit to the Council must have been frus-
trating to the delegates, who only appeared during that one session, and also 
handed their statement in writing. No larger discussions are recorded in the 
council protocols, which tend to be quite detailed.
</p>
<p>The practice of sending high court delegates to present revision cases to 
Stockholm caused a clash between two legal cultures: the European learned 
ius commune and the Swedish unlearned law. The practice was undoubtedly 
cumbersome and expensive, but the Dorpat judges seem also to have been

<p>genuinely unconvinced about the benefits of the system, a kind of system 
which was &ldquo;nowhere in use.&rdquo; This was true as far as the procedure at the Im-
perial Chamber Court of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was 
concerned. The Imperial Chamber Court was a natural reference point for the 
Livonian high court judges, but in other parts of Europe high court procedures 
were common. A good example is Denmark, where the whole judicial system 
was, if possible, even more antiquarian than in Sweden.311 In practice, the 
Council gave up on demanding the presence of Dorpat court delegates. The 
incident described above was both the first and the last one.
</p>
<p>The Council of the Realm actively encouraged dispute settlement.312 Revi-
sion being the last possibility of putting judicial pressure on the opponent and 
all remedies having been exhausted, both parties at least sometimes probably 
felt the need to avoid a complete loss in the case.313 I will take two examples 
of this. A contract dispute in 1642 (Lewold vs. Patkel) ended in settlement in 
court. The Council, however, would not approve just any settlement. After a 
few sessions, Patkel&rsquo;s advocate Hans Kemm (&ldquo;and others who had arbitrated 
between Lewold and Patkel&rdquo;)314 informed the Council that the parties had ar-
rived at a settlement of 2800 thalers. The Council wanted to know what the 
basis of this settlement was, &ldquo;because it should be based on justice.&rdquo; Kemm&rsquo;s 
answer, according to which the parties &ldquo;felt that the settlement was based jus-
tice,&rdquo; was apparently not sufficient. The Council interviewed Lewold&rsquo;s lawyer 
Detterman as well. Although Lewold, &ldquo;out of good will&rdquo; (&ldquo;af godh vilje&rdquo;), was 
willing to settle on the said sum, the Council, in a proposal of its own, raised 
the sum to be paid to 3500 thalers. Other detailed provisions were included in 
the settlement contract as well, and the parties finally approved it &ldquo;by hand-
shake and thanks&rdquo; (&ldquo;handslaget och tacksejelse&rdquo;).315 In a commercial dispute

<p>between Gustav Horn and Georg von Schwengeln in 1652, the High Court of 
Dorpat316 had already attempted to settle, but von Schwengeln had refused. 
The High Court&rsquo;s proposal for settlement was read aloud, but neither of the 
parties was willing to accept it. The Court suggested that von Schwengeln draft 
another proposal. The case probably ended in settlement, since it disappears 
from the sources.317
</p>
<p>What kind of cases were decided in the revision procedure? Given the el-
evated cost of litigation, the stakes were understandably high in these cases. 
Land disputes and cases involving commercial contracts were typically taken 
to the Council, and high nobility &ndash; names such as Wrangell, Sparre, and Thurn &ndash;  
appear as parties. Besides the council protocols, the archives of the Justice 
Revision yield additional information. Many of the acts lack documents, and 
it is often difficult or impossible to find out what a particular case handled, 
even. The few remaining documents nevertheless include inheritance cases 
and those involving &ldquo;excess regarding the execution of a sentence&rdquo; (&ldquo;excessus 
in modo executionis&rdquo;). Even criminal cases were sometimes subject to revi-
sion. To mention an example from the Dorpat High Court&rsquo;s reviewed cases, a 
manslaughter case from Ingerman originally decided in 1648 at a lower court 
arrived in Stockholm via beneficium revisionis. The accused, Erich Hassi, had 
denied his guilt, but had not been able to acquire oath-helpers. He had been 
condemned to death at the High Court. Criminal cases could in principle not 
be appealed, but the prohibition did not, it seems, concern revision.318
</p>
<p>How often did the Livonian parties receive beneficium revisionis? As the 
procedure was costly, it is unsurprising that only one to three cases appear 
in the protocols of the Council of the Realm each year. In some cases, it is 
not entirely clear from which high court a revision case originates, but these 
ambiguities hardly change the general picture. Further information is again 
available in the archives, although only little remains there too. From the years 
1632&ndash;1647, 12 (mostly very incomplete) case files remain in the archive. Nine of 
them have to do with the High Court at Dorpat and, interestingly, three with

and for 1653&ndash;1659 another six.321 Supplicants from other Livonian and Baltic 
jurisdictions were much more active: for instance, we have five cases from  
Oesel and seven from Riga &ndash; neither of which belonged under the jurisdiction 
of Dorpat High Court. These numbers are naturally not statistically reliable, 
but they indicate the amount more or less, especially when compared to other 
material. The information, in any case, supports that of the protocols of the 
Council of the Realm.
</p>
<p>A register of the Justice Revision for the years 1670&ndash;1672 exists also in the 
archive, and the register is probably more reliable as to the quantities of re-
vision cases coming from different high courts. Most of the cases came from 
the Svea High Court. For the three years there are 50 cases from Svea, 20  
from Dorpat and two from Turku. For the sake of comparison, 11 cases came 
from G&ouml;ta High Court and 12 from Riga. In addition to these pieces of infor-
mation, the collection of royal letters in the archive of the Dorpat High Court 
includes the petitions (compulsoriales) by way of which the Revision asked the 
Court to provide the Revision with the documents of individual cases in which 
beneficium revisionis had been granted. The number of these is roughly in the 
same category as other information that we have. Thus, in 1680 the Court was 
asked to send the documents in three cases, in 1681 in one case, in 1683&ndash;84 in 
five cases, and in 1685 in five cases.322 To sum up, it seems that no more than a 
few revision cases went from the Dorpat High Court each year.
</p>
<p>4.6 Summary: Legal Procedure in Seventeenth-Century Livonia
</p>
<p>The Swedish intention, judged by the ordinances of the early 1630s, was to 
bring the Livonian legal procedures as close to the Swedish model as possi-
ble. This was clearly the goal even if the Livonian legal tradition was much 
closer to the learned European models than to the Swedish tradition. The ju-
dicial structure was to resemble the Swedish, at least roughly, the Landgerichte  
being the equivalents of the Swedish h&auml;radsr&auml;tter and the Dorpat High Court 
joining the series of other high courts within the Realm. However, even the

</p>
<p>composition of the lower courts was necessarily different to the lower courts 
in Sweden proper. Whereas free peasants formed the backbone of the lower 
courts of the countryside in Sweden, in Livonia too little of such an estate ex-
isted, and serfs could not be made to sit at court. Therefore, the Livonian lower 
courts of the countryside consisted of noble judges, deciding cases in which 
their peers predominantly figured. The cases of serfs continued to be handled 
in manorial courts &ndash; which in the same sense did not exist in Sweden.
</p>
<p>The procedure of the lower courts itself soon drifted further and further 
from the Swedish lay-dominated model, as legal professionals took an effective 
grip of the procedures &ndash; especially the civil one &ndash; in Livonia. The Artikelprozess 
and then a procedure more or less modelled after the procedure of the Impe-
rial Chamber Court became the order of the day in accusatorial cases both 
with and without a prosecutor. The accusatorial procedure as well as civil pro-
cedure became heavily dependent on writing and the exchange of briefs, with 
lawyers frequently appearing in court or at least drafting legal instruments on 
behalf of their clients.
</p>
<p>In proper criminal procedure, or inquisitorial procedure, the differences 
never became as great, undoubtedly because of the sparse involvement of 
professional lawyers. In some respects, the development went in the contrary  
direction: judicial torture, which &ndash; unlike in Sweden proper &ndash; was still com-
monplace in Livonia at the beginning of the period, was rooted out by the 
1680s in Livonia also.
</p>
<p>The high court procedure was also based on written briefs, much in the same 
way as the lower court procedure. The procedure was, however, not completely 
written, as lawyers personally appeared in court to read their briefs and to col-
lect copies of the opposing side&rsquo;s writings. The high court procedure was quite 
similar to that of the Svea High Court and the other high courts in Sweden. The 
similarity is understandable, because all high courts started more or less from 
scratch in that their procedure was not inherited from earlier appeals courts 
in Sweden proper or in Livonia. Instead, the procedure of all of the courts was 
much influenced by the procedure of the German Imperial Chamber Court. 
Furthermore, the learnedness of the high court procedure that came naturally 
for the Livonian high court also became an important feature of the Swedish 
high courts.
</p>
<p>The revision procedure was used only rarely. Given the high costs involved, 
it is understandable that most of the revision cases came from the Svea High 
Court district and not from far away courts like Dorpat. It is also probable that 
the monetary value of the cases in the Svea district were on average higher 
than in Livonia. This, however, must remain a mere guess since no compara-
tive research has been possible here on that particular question.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>237The Procedure In The Livonian Courts Of The Swedish Era
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>The judiciary and the legal procedure were thus heavily under the control of 
the nobility. When the Swedish crown made decisive blows on the position of 
the Livonian nobility in the 1680s and the 1690s, attempts to divert the course 
of legal procedures were made as well. Students at the local university, the Aca-
demia Carolo-Gustaviana, were taught Swedish procedural law, especially after 
the Swedish-born advocate Samuel Aus&eacute;en was appointed Professor of Law in 
1701. So many of the advocates and judges had, however, taken their degrees in 
Germany that whatever teaching was given in Dorpat or Pernau, it could only 
have a limited effect on practical legal life. The procedure in the courts thus re-
mained strongly German, and the Swedes never managed to divert the course 
of legal procedures. In hindsight, this would have been impossible, given the 
structure of the Livonian courts&rsquo; personnel and its traditions, not to speak of 
the social make-up of Livonian society.323
</p>
<p>323 The University Senate complained to the Chancellor in 1696 that the advocates active in 
the Consistory, in charge of the cases involving teachers and students, attempted to &ldquo;im-
pose a straggly, German-type of procedure&rdquo; on the university court. This could lead even 
to petty cases lasting the whole year. The Senate strongly recommended that the Swedish 
procedure be favoured instead.</p>

</p>
<p>Transplanting Swedish Law? The Legal Sources  
at the Livonian Courts
</p>
<p>5.1 The Theory of Legal Spheres
</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of not incorporating Livonia closely to the Swedish realm, 
the solutions taken in relation to the law to be applied in Livonian courts be-
come understandable. It was logical for the Swedes to take the common Euro-
pean model of legal spheres, the statute theory (Statutentheorie), as the point 
of departure. The central idea was thus to give priority to the smallest legal 
sphere and if an appropriate rule was not found, to move to a larger sphere.1 
There was nothing original about this. On the contrary, the solution was known 
in practically every major European country. The French had their Droit com-
mun, the Spaniards their derecho com&uacute;n, the Dutch the Roman-Dutch law, and 
the Germans their gemeines Recht. These local &ldquo;common laws&rdquo; in principle had 
to yield to town laws and local consuetudines, and these national common laws 
were primary in relation to the European ius commune.2
</p>
<p>Article xxix of the Swedish so-called Verbesserte Landgerichtsordnung of 
1632 encapsulates the idea of legal spheres well. According to the paragraph, 
Livonian law came first, then Swedish, and then Roman law.3 According to the 
article, the Livonian and Swedish laws were to be used so that they remained

3 The courts were to judge &ldquo;erstlich nach lieffl&auml;ndischen Rechten l&ouml;blichen Gewohnheiten, so-
</p>
<p>weit dieselbe dem Worte Gottes oder dem K&ouml;nigl. juri superioritatis nicht entgegen, wo dar aber  
nicht eine Gewi&szlig;heit nicht vorhanden, nach Schwedischen Rechten, Constitutionen, Reichs- 
Abschieden, und Gebr&auml;uchen, so mit dem jure saniorum populorum communi einstimmig, spre-
chen und verabschieden.&rdquo; Buddenbrock ii, 104&ndash;105. The wording of the Ordinance on Castle 
Courts (1631) &sect; 11 was slightly different, as it emphasized Swedish law and failed to mention 
ius commune: &ldquo;[&hellip;] schwedischen Rechten, constitutionen, abschieden, reichs- und lieffl&auml;ndisch-
en vern&uuml;nfligen gewohnheiten &uuml;bereinstimmet [&hellip;].&rdquo; In &sect; 5 of the same Ordinance the judicial 
oath contains a list of legal sources, again not quite identical with that in &sect; 11. The judges 
pledge to follow &ldquo;[&hellip;] schwedischen rechten, reichs statute, abhandlungen, abschieden, guten, 
l&ouml;blichen schwedisch- und lieffl&auml;ndischen gebreuchen und sitten [&hellip;].&rdquo; Printed at Bieneman, 
Geschichte der Schlossgerichte, 29. As noted above, this may reflect the castle courts&rsquo; identity 
as a tribunal especially oriented according to the interests of the Swedish authorities.

</p>
<p>&ldquo;in harmony&rdquo; (einstimmig) with ius commune. The common Roman law was 
thus in Sweden, as elsewhere, understood as a device with the help of which 
the local legal orders, both Livonian and Swedish, were to be interpreted. Stat-
utory law and customary law were &ldquo;stricte interpretanda&rdquo; and &ldquo;ut quam minus 
laedent ius commune.&rdquo; Unless a local statute or legal custom was shown to con-
tradict the ius commune, it was supposed that the latter could be applied: the 
ius commune possessed a fundata intentio.4 This was the case at least at the lev-
el of written law. Whether it was also the case in legal practice, we will see later.
</p>
<p>It was thus far from self-evident which strategy the Swedes would adopt 
in relation to the conquered Livonia. Some (like the Governor-General Johan 
Skytte) were keen to have a thorough incorporation; King Gustav ii Adolf and 
Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna favoured adopting a more realistic stance. Ensur-
ing that the King gained the upper hand, the common European model of legal 
spheres, the Statutentheorie, was taken as the point of departure. In this theory, 
priority was given to the smallest legal sphere and then, if an appropriate norm 
could not be found, recourse was taken to larger legal spheres. The Swedish 
solution in Livonia was thus not radically different from the German, French, 
Spanish, or the Dutch solutions.
</p>
<p>5.2 The Ius Commune in the Livonian Court Records
</p>
<p>Above (Chapter 2) it was argued that the reception of Roman law in all its three 
aspects (substantive, procedural, and cultural) had already gained ground in 
Livonia before the coming of the Swedes. The process of Romanization had 
started in the late Middle Ages and progressed during the sixteenth century. 
The unruly conditions of almost continuous warfare had shattered much of 
the Livonian infrastructure in the decades prior to the Swedish period. It is 
difficult to say how much all this affected the composition of the legal profes-
sion, which must have consisted of only a few professionals in the first place. 
One could nevertheless argue that at least some learned legal culture survived 
throughout the Polish era. Otherwise the drafting of a learned piece of legis-
lation such as the Hilchen&rsquo;s Code would hardly have made sense. Above, we 
encountered some learned lawyers in the town courts of Dorpat in the 1620s. 
In addition, legal professionals quickly surface again in the court proceedings 
of the 1630s, as both judges and lawyers &ndash; although full-time, learned advo-
cates still did not exist, and legal learnedness certainly did not dominate the 
proceedings. Nevertheless, the presence of learned lawyers shows that some

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>chapter 5240
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>unbroken  tradition of legal learning had persisted. More than anything, the 
work of legal professionals can be concluded from the way ius commune ap-
pears occasionally in the court papers. I will first pay attention to the early 
years of the Swedish period, and then compare my observations to what hap-
pened later.
</p>
<p>It has already become clear in the preceding pages that the procedural influ-
ences of ius commune were considerable. I will now concentrate on substantial 
rules of Roman law rules in Livonian court records.
</p>
<p>On 21 January 1635 a Junker called Matthias Stahl stood accused of murder 
at Pernau District Court. The procedure was written, lawyerly, and tainted with 
ius commune or gemeines Recht. While the advocate of the accused claimed 
that his client had killed the victim by mistake, the prosecutor (actor officialis) 
answered with a citation from Bartolus: &ldquo;Nam si quis errori ducto alium occidat, 
quim occidere noluit, poena ordinaria homicidij punitendum esse, exto, quod da-
bat operam rei illicita; Bart: in l. respicitadum &sect;. delinquunt in postr. resb. ff. de 
poenis.&rdquo;5
</p>
<p>In another homicide case from 1640 against a nobleman called Jacob Hin-
tze, an experienced lawyer and actually the Oberfiskal or prosecutor at Dorpat 
High Court, Philipp Tinctorius acted as the defence attorney for Hintze. In this 
case Tinctorius used an unusually wide range of legal sources. According to 
Tinctorius, his client had acted in self-defence, defending his house from an 
intruder:
</p>
<p>ferrum cum ferro omni de jure licitum est repellere, ex non solum ic-
tum sed etiam impetum in quo timor consistit salutis. p.l. si ex plagijs &sect;. 
tabernor, ff. de vi et vi armata. [&hellip;] Cum Domus cuiq sua, tutissimum sit 
refugium ac receptaculum ut etiam is qui ingreditur in ucto Domo vim 
inferre videatur. l. pleriq. ff. d. In jus vocando Keysers Caroli des 5. Peinli-
che Halsgerichts Ordnunge, ccxxxviii. et seqq. auch besteht. &ndash; Und ist 
im 24. Capt. lib: 2 juris Suetici.
</p>
<p>Tinctorius thus refers to most of the legal sources mentioned in the District 
Court Ordinances: Roman law, gemeines Recht, and Swedish law. In his conclu-
sive statement, Tinctorius even makes use of the contemporary legal literature, 
namely Andreas Gaill.6
</p>
<p>5 nae 915.1.1, f. 9.
6 Based on Gaill, Tinctorius states that &ldquo;non ex vulnere, sed ex accidenti portiq vulneratq mor-
</p>
<p>tuus praesumitur.&rdquo; In the marginal, there is a referral to Gaill&rsquo;s Observationes (Liber 2, Obs. 111, 
nr. 23). In this passage, Gaill does not speak of accidents, however, but discusses the situation </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>241Transplanting Swedish Law?
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Allusions to legal literature were not frequent, however. Besides the one to 
Gaill mentioned above, few others appear. Georg Stiernhielm acted as advo-
cate for a Swede named Andreas Larsson, when he was charged for manslaugh-
ter at the Dorpat Castle Court in 1630&ndash;31. In one of his written statements to 
the Court, Stiernhielm referred to Baldus.7 In a case of counterfeiting money 
and robbery from 1635, Stiernhielm now acted as the Referent, the member in 
charge of preparing the decision. In his pro voto statement,8 following all the 
basic precepts of Roman-canon evidence law, Stiernhielm shows that he was 
well aware of the contemporary literature on criminal procedure. The main 
legal problem in the case had to do with evidence, which will serve as an ex-
ample of Stiernhielm&rsquo;s argumentation. For instance, Stiernhielm stresses that 
&ldquo;proofs in criminal cases need to be brighter than daylight,&rdquo; and therefore also 
the witnesses must be particularly credible (&ldquo;in Criminalibus causis, [&hellip;] pro-
bationes luce meridiana debent esse clariores, Testes omni exceptione majores 
requiruntur&rdquo;). Since the witness in question had been condemned to death 
for another crime and because, in addition, his statement was not internally 
consistent, Stiernhielm did not give the statement any weight. The same con-
clusion applied to another witness, who was underage, was therefore deposed 
under oath, and he repeated exactly the same words as the other witness men-
tioned above &ndash; with whom the underage witness had come to the hearing (&ldquo;de-
poniret gleich als aus einem munde mit dem Carpofsin mit deme er gekommen 
[&hellip;]&rdquo;). Stiernhielm mentions Josephus Mascardus (&ldquo;de prob. Concl. 1371&rdquo;)9 and 
Julius Clarus (&ldquo;Criminalibus, &sect; fin. q. 53&rdquo;) as his authorities on evidence.10 As 
for the robbery, Stiernhielm arrives at the conclusion that the accused should 
not be condemned to the ordinary punishment (poena ordinaria) for lack of 
proof. Stiernhielm ponders also whether the accused would deserve at least an 
extraordinary punishment if he cannot be sentenced to an ordinary one. If and 
when an extraordinary punishment is appropriate, the accused would have  
</p>
<p> in which a wounded person contracts fever or another illness and dies. Then, according to 
Gaill, it should be presumed that the death occurred because of the illness, not violence. 
Later, Tinctorius refers to another passage of Observationes (2.110.11I; see also Pastor An-
dreas Hornung vs. Lieutenant Johann Friedrich Gant vs. Shieffelbein, dcp 1696 915.1.8, f. 213.
</p>
<p>7 &ldquo;Melius sit mori, quam vili pendi.&rdquo; nae 4036.1.1.
8 These statements contained an elaborated version of ratio decidendi, whereas much less 
</p>
<p>was disclosed to the parties in the final decision of the High Court. The pro voto statement 
was thus essentially meant as an internal document of the Court. This statement has been 
kept in Stiernhielm&rsquo;s private archive.

</p>
<p>already served it anyway, having been kept in pre-trial custody (&ldquo;[&hellip;] biszhero 
mit l&auml;nglicher gef&auml;ngn&uuml;sz auszgestanden.&rdquo;).11 Stiernhielm&rsquo;s argument is entire-
ly based on ius commune.
</p>
<p>Stiernhielm&rsquo;s adherence to ius commune is also evident in a suplicatio of  
20 August 1655, to the High Court of Dorpat. Stiernhielm was himself party to 
the case. He did not accept that the lower court judge (Unterlagman) of Ingria, 
Jasper Jansson, had refused to let Stiernhielm appeal in a case between himself 
and Antonius Rosenbr&ouml;ijer, in addition to which Jansson had proceeded to the 
execution of his decision without waiting for the appeals court decision. The 
poet-lawyer based his claims on Roman and canon law (de iure civili quam ca-
nonico), allegedly resulting in that the decision of a lower court was null and 
void (ipso iure nulla). He further claimed that &ldquo;all laws state&rdquo; that it was unlaw-
ful to execute a lower court decision without waiting for the appeal court&rsquo;s  
decision on the matter. Even &ldquo;all laymen&rdquo; (&ldquo;idiotae&rdquo;) knew this, and equity  
(Billigkeit) demanded as much. In this same supplication, he refers to the pro-
cedural works of Roberto Lancelloti (Lancellotus, d. 1586; an Italian canonist, 
professor in Perugia and later advocate in Rome) and Jean Masuer (Mansu-
erius, d. 1450; a French canonist).12
</p>
<p>Let us take one more example of how Stiernhielm argued with Roman law 
or ius commune in his own legal cases &ndash; of which there were many. In 1652, he 
had a legal problem with Johan Adam Schraffer concerning a peasant tavern, 
which both parties thought was situated on their premises.13 Stiernhielm char-
acterized Schraffer&rsquo;s claims as aiming at &ldquo;actionem nullitatis, &amp; restitutionis in 
integrum,&rdquo; and complains that he (Stiernhielm) had not been cited to answer 
these claims. Nullity claims14 and restitutio ad integrum15 were both important 
institutions of ius commune. According to Stiernhielm&rsquo;s analysis, the claim was 
ad petitoriam (about ownership), thus in distinction from ad possessoriam 
(about mere possession).16 He calls his opponent&rsquo;s claim &ldquo;frigidum &amp; frivolum,&rdquo;

<p>16 The difference was well entrenched in ius commune.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;senseless and manifestly insufficient,&rdquo; a saying which also belonged to com-
mon European legal phraseology.17
</p>
<p>Livonian lawyers sometimes referred to passages of Corpus iuris civilis. 
When Advocate Sch&ouml;nfeldt defended Jurgen Poribe in a case which Hinrich 
Niehusen had raised in Pernau Lower Court in 1690, the advocate claimed that 
the plaintiff &rsquo;s charge, according to Lex Aquilia, amounted to injuria.18 Even 
larger legal spheres are referred to, such as &ldquo;the procedural orders of all the 
world,&rdquo; which supposedly spoke in favour of the standpoint of the accused&rsquo;s 
advocate.19
</p>
<p>In criminal cases the intentionality of the deed was observed, following 
ius commune. Advocate Sch&ouml;nfeldt argued with the concept of intention in 
a slander case against his client in 1690, stating that &ldquo;according to all laws [&hellip;] 
animus offendendi or laedendi, or dolus should be observed, and the plaintiff 
has not been able to show by way of witnesses or otherwise that the accused 
would have had inuriandi animo against the plaintiff [&hellip;].&rdquo;20 In another case at 
the Pernau Lower Court in 1690, Prosecutor Schirm had summoned Lieuten-
ant Daniel Br&uuml;ning&rsquo;s wife to Pernau Lower Court in 1689 for disrespect towards 
court orders. When it turned out that the Lieutenant was not at home, the 
court servant (Gerichtsdiener) had delivered the summons to his wife instead.

<p>According to the prosecutor, she had thrown the envelope away with &ldquo;the high-
est disrespect and slander&rdquo; (&ldquo;zum h&ouml;chsten despect und beschimpffung&rdquo;). When 
heard as witness, however, the court servant stated that the lady of the house 
had not come to know about the content of the letter, and the witness does not 
seem to have mentioned anything of her disrespectful behaviour. She had only 
said that she would not take it and had given the letter back to the court ser-
vant. The Court decided that, as the lady &ldquo;had not been aware that [the letter] 
was a court summons, she cannot have shown disrespect towards the Court by 
handing the summons back&rdquo; to the court servant.21
</p>
<p>Gemeines Recht, the German variant of ius commune, is rarely mentioned as 
a term. Town Secretary Hippius acting as advocate in the Town Court of Per-
nau, however, did so in a case concerning a debt. When the defendant Johann 
Schmidt replied to the charge that he had been underage at the time when he 
had entered into the obligation, Hippius argued that since the case was a sum-
mary one (because it was based on documentary evidence), defences based on 
&ldquo;fear, violence, or youth&rdquo; could not be observed &ndash; they had significance in ordi-
nary procedure only.22 However, Hippius stated that according to the gemeines 
Recht, 14 years was the age of marriage, and according to the Riga law (which 
was also the mother law of Pernau) the legal age was 18.23
</p>
<p>5.3 The Influence of Swedish Law in Livonia
</p>
<p>Swedish law fundamentally influenced Livonian judicial structures, although 
Swedish structures were by no means copied as such. In this chapter, however, 
these observations will not be repeated. Instead, attention will be paid to Swed-
ish sources in the way courts and lawyers used them in their argumentation.
</p>
<p>During the first decades of the Swedish rule, the law of the realm is seldom 
mentioned, and the attempts of the Swedish crown to introduce at least some 
Swedish law in Livonia were frustrated early on. Eager for quick results, the 
Council of the Realm noted in 1635 that it was difficult to control the Dorpat 
High Court from such a distance. Although some of the judges were always 
Swedish, the Court was inclining more and more towards German law. As a

<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>remedy, the Council suggested that two lawman&rsquo;s courts (lagmansr&auml;tt) be 
founded to replace the High Court. The lawman&rsquo;s court could, so the Council 
felt, be more readily used to introduce Swedish law in the province.24 This plan 
never amounted to more than ink on paper.
</p>
<p>Above all, Swedish law was followed in procedural questions and especially 
insofar as the high court procedure is concerned. It thus makes certain sense 
that Georg Stiernhielm, in a legal case of his own at the Dorpat High Court in 
1652, writes that &ldquo;the High Court [as far as the law of appeals is concerned] 
primarily uses Swedish law.&rdquo;25 However, as mentioned before, the procedure in 
the Swedish high courts cannot be regarded as a national, Swedish, phenom-
enon, but entailed a conscious reception of ius commune and gemeines Recht 
models. From the very beginning, ius commune citations occurred frequently 
in the protocols of the Svea High Court.
</p>
<p>In the substantial law of Livonia, Swedish influences or similarities with 
the Swedish system are more difficult to detect. Towards the end of the seven-
teenth century, the courts began to mention Swedish legislation increasingly 
often in their decisions, and the parties also refer to Swedish statutes. In 1688, 
the Fiscal Philipp Schirm accused Soldier Jacob Bremer in puncto Rapina ex 
violentiarum, violent robbery, in the District Court of Pernau. Schirm based his 
demand for punishment on Swedish law:
</p>
<p>&hellip;al&szlig; bittet actor officiosus bekl. wegen solcher frewellthaten, damitdie 
heer und Landt-stra&szlig;en in k&uuml;nfftige gesichert und I.K.M. Werordnung in 
mehrem nachdruck erhalten werden m&ouml;gen, andern zum merckl. exem-
pell und schrecken, mit einer in Rechten enthaltenen Criminal=straff, id 
gz cum refusione expensarum, gerechtsambst zu bestraffen&hellip;26
</p>
<p>Sometimes the courts referred to the &ldquo;nature of things,&rdquo; which is not surprising 
in the age of natural law. Thus the Pernau District Court in 1688 motivated its 
interlocutory sentence, approving an exceptio fori declinatoria in the following 
way:
</p>
<p>24 The Protocol of the Council of the Realm 10 December, 1635 and 25 May, 1641; cited at 
Odhner, Sveriges inre historia under drottning Christinas f&ouml;rmyndare, 139.
</p>
<p>25 The legal case concerned a lucrative peasant tavern, which both parties claimed was lo-
cated on their land. Wieselgren, Samlade skrifter av Georg Stiernhielm, 3:1, 146; 3:2, 150: 
&ldquo;Wasz in simili casu Contumaci fur ein beneficium juris reserviret wirdt, haben Sie zu ersehen 
ausz dem 13.cap. Tingmalb.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>26 dcp 1688, nae 915.1.7, f. 51&ndash;52.</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>da&szlig; des Mittbeklagten H. Moritz Bretholtz exceptio fori declinatoria bil-
lig statt hat, und dahero, weil diese Sache ihrer natur und eigenschafft,

billig dahin mediante citatione au&szlig; zu f&uuml;hren, zu werweisen sey, wie Er 
den hiemit falcher gestalt dahin werwiesen wird.27
</p>
<p>In this case the nature-of-things argument was thus not the only, perhaps even 
not the decisive argument, but was instead combined with an argument from 
a royal ordinance, that is, Swedish statutory law.
</p>
<p>Swedish influences on substantial law thus remained insignificant. The 
Livonian legal culture was a learned one, and like learned legal cultures ev-
erywhere in Europe and America, the Livonian legal culture was dependent 
on the written text. Books of law were a major tool of legal communication, 
without which any degree of a common legal culture was unthinkable. Be-
cause of the rudimentary form of Swedish legal literature, such forms of legal 
communication could not exist between Sweden and Livonia. The only way of 
communicating the Swedish law to the Baltic province was by way of statutory 
law and by court decisions. Statutory law, however, had not yet developed into 
the effective tool of governance it is today. Beneficium revisionis, the functional 
equivalent of a supreme court of the Swedish realm, was too costly and cum-
bersome an instrument to steer the Livonian legal development effectively.
</p>
<p>5.4 The Livonian Legal Sources
</p>
<p>Livonian law remained a vague concept throughout the Swedish period. Livo-
nian law is best identified with the medieval feudal laws, the Ritterrechte, and 
in the peasant laws (Bauerrechte). Both kinds of law were codified in several 
layers in the Middle Ages.28 As was the case with all legal sources, local Livoni-
an law was rarely mentioned in the court documents. Some exceptions where

<p>spite several attempts and petitions from the Estonian and Livonian knighthood. The Mit-
tlere Ritterrecht was not provisorily confirmed as law before 1648, when Queen Christina 
did so. This action taken by the Queen, however, did not lead to a final approbation. The 
Livonian Landesordnungen of 1671 and 1707 never received a royal confirmation either.

<p>archives, however. In a witchcraft case, the Dorpat Lower Court argued with 
God&rsquo;s laws (three specifically mentioned passages of the Old Testament), &ldquo;all 
secular and common laws,&rdquo; Swedish law and Livonian law (the Ritterrechte).29
</p>
<p>However, the cases referring to feudal or manorial law are understandably 
scarce. Both bodies of law had been compiled in the Middle Ages, and most 
of their development had taken place since then in customary law. As far as 
peasant law is concerned, it was primarily applied in manorial courts, which 
mostly operated without written records.30 The district courts and the Dorpat 
High Court normally had little use for feudal and manorial law.
</p>
<p>Cases in which no sources at all were mentioned were much more com-
mon. This does not of course mean that these case decisions would be void of 
any normative content. If the legal source is not specifically mentioned, then 
sometimes it may the case that the decision is based on customary law. The 
settlement cases were treated in detail above, and there is no need to repeat 
that discussion here. The habit of settling all kinds of criminal cases belongs 
to the oldest layer of law, which predated the reception of learned law. Cus-
tomary law is, however, extremely difficult to identify. In 1638, we are quite 
clearly dealing with customary law. In that year, the District Court of Pernau 
sentenced Daniel Piski to death for homicide. The Court &ldquo;condemned [Piski] 
according to the common laws of the land to [be beheaded by] the sword.&rdquo;31 
In another murder case, not only the beheading was founded on the common 
laws of the land but also cutting off the defendant&rsquo;s right hand, with which he 
had struck his father the fatal blow.32 In a case concerning violence, from the 
year 1655, the court referred to &ldquo;Livonian laws&rdquo; (&ldquo;livl&auml;ndische Rechte&rdquo;), probably 
meaning the medieval Ritterrechte. The Court recognized the local law, accord-
ing to which the crime would have merited a corporal punishment. However, 
because of the young age of the accused, he was instead ordered to pay a fine 
before leaving the court. If he were not able to pay, the accused would have to 
spend two months imprisoned on bread and water.33

</p>
<p>Livonian civil law remained largely customary until 1865, when Friedrich 
Georg von Bunge collected the different kinds of Livonian law and compiled 
it into the Baltic Civil Law.34 The uncodified state of Livonian law helped the 
Swedes, when trying to ascertain a place for the Swedish law in the Livonian 
legal heterogeneity, in their initial negotiations with the estates.35 The decision 
not to codify the Livonian law even later in the Swedish era may have been 
intended to strengthen the Swedish reception of Swedish law. Yet, paradoxi-
cally, the ambiguity of Livonian law also enabled the local judges to juggle a 
wide variety of sources according to their discretion. For Swedish judges active 
in Livonia, establishing what Livonian law was in a particular case must have 
presented considerable difficulties.
</p>
<p>5.5 Divine Law and Natural Law
</p>
<p>Livonian lawyers in the Swedish period, as early modern legal professionals in 
general and as a reflection on law&rsquo;s medieval heritage, thought in the catego-
ries of both secular and &ldquo;higher&rdquo; law. This higher law was in the Lutheran re-
gions of Europe, no longer church law (except for cases specifically retained in 
its domain) but &ldquo;divine&rdquo; law (g&ouml;ttliches Recht) as expressed in the Decalogue.36 
Already in the Polish time, the courts use formulae which included a reference 
to God&rsquo;s laws. Thus when the Dorpat Council sentenced Timp Hans to death in 
1622, he was sentenced &ldquo;according to divine and worldly laws&rdquo; (&ldquo;g&ouml;ttlichen und 
weltlichen Rechten nach&rdquo;).37
</p>
<p>Divine law is not mentioned in the briefs of lawyers or the court decisions 
of the Livonian courts any more often than the other sources. When it is, one 
gets the impression of it being utilized in passing and mainly for rhetorical 
purposes. This view is, however, probably not correct. Divine law is in many 
ways comparable to natural law, which Richard Helmholz has studied. Helm-
holz observes that although natural law may not have been frequently invoked

</p>
<p>in early modern European and American courts, it nevertheless demonstrates 
often enough that it had an important place in the thinking of the legal profes-
sional. Natural law was understood to be a source of positive law, not its rival. 
Natural law&rsquo;s authority was often used to strengthen the argumentation that 
flowed from sources of positive law.38
</p>
<p>Much the same can be said of divine law. It was never mentioned as a source 
by itself, but both courts and lawyers invoked divine law&rsquo;s authority to fortify 
their arguments. Every legal professional fresh from their studies, as Helmholz 
argues, felt that natural law was above positive law.39 Similarly, they also knew 
that divine law was, just as clearly, superior to positive law, if not even more so. 
By the fifteenth century, it was a well-established doctrine that all legal cus-
toms, in order to be valid, needed to be at least tacitly approved by the king, 
and they could not go against God&rsquo;s laws.40
</p>
<p>The use of God&rsquo;s law in their rhetoric reveals something of the early modern 
legal professional&rsquo;s set of mind. Rhetoric does not work unless it has as cred-
ible basis. Thus when the advocate of Herman Fick&szlig; and Johan Bagge, in a 
slander case (in puncto injuriarum verbalium) in 1690, called the alleged &ldquo;verbal 
injuries&rdquo; &ldquo;in godly and secular laws the highest punishable&rdquo; (&ldquo;in g&ouml;ttl[ichen] 
und Weltl[ichen] Rechten h&ouml;chststraffbahr&rdquo;), he really meant what he wrote.41 
This basic concept of two separate bodies of law is even more obvious when a 
pastor issued a document, certifying that a certain lieutenant had no illegiti-
mate children (Huren-Kinder) registered in the church books, stating that &ldquo;in 
God&rsquo;s Holy Scripture, as well as in worldly laws, it is forbidden to give false oath 
against one&rsquo;s neighbour.&rdquo;42

<p>had learned at the university also found its way into the Livonian statutory law. 
The early modern theory of legal sources was in turn based on the medieval 
statute theory. As Wolfgang Wiegand has shown, local law was always to pre-
vail against a law of a larger sphere. On the other hand, the court had to know 
ex officio only ius commune &ndash; Roman and canon law &ndash; and the local law that 
was fixed in writing and taken into the statute book (ius commune in loco).43 
According to the Reichskammergerichtsordnung (Art. 3), the judges swore to 
judge according to the local laws presented to them, and then according to the 
&ldquo;common laws of the Empire.&rdquo;44 Parties needed to show the normative con-
tents of all other bodies of law, and in case of uncertainty, the ius commune 
prevailed (fundata intentio).45
</p>
<p>Some details of this picture have been challenged. The point is not that Wie-
gand was wrong, but that the theory he reconstructed only represents the me-
dieval starting point. From the late fifteenth century onwards, this theory was 
in constant flux, and many versions of the medieval theory were developed 
to meet the needs of the different political situations in the German territo-
ries and elsewhere. In addition, the legal practice did not necessarily follow 
any of the theories. For instance, Klaus Luig has shown that in the period of 
usus modernus, judges did not always expect the parties to prove the content 
of norms, but instead researched them ex officio.46 Fundata intentio was also 
taken by some authors to refer to gemeines Recht, &ldquo;common German law,&rdquo; not 
ius commune, which was to be proven.47 Territorial rulers had been, since 1692, 
under obligation to inform the Imperial Chamber Court of their new laws  
(Rechtsbeibringungspflicht).48

<p>Aritsune Katsuta has helpfully divided the statute theory into two parts, 
absolute and conditional. The absolute statute theory (die absolute Statuten-
vorrangtheorie) developed in the medieval Italian city-states after the Glossa-
tors. This is a theory in which the law of the closest and smallest sphere was 
given preference over the larger spheres. The judge was expected to know both  
the local law and the ius commune. The theory changed as it was adopted 
to meet the needs of canon law. The Pope and the judges representing the  
Papal See could only be expected to know the common law of the organisation, 
not all of the local ones. The statute theory at the Imperial Chamber Court 
was structured in the same way. Ex officio the judges were supposed to know  
ius commune only, whereas the contents of other bodies of law needed to be 
proven to the court (the conditional statute theory; die bedingte Statutenvor-
rangtheorie). In addition to this, the judges would evaluate the rationality of 
the local customs presented to them. According to Katsuta, both absolute 
and conditional versions of the theory were adopted in different imperial 
territories.49
</p>
<p>The Spanish theories offer an interesting example of the versatility of the 
statutory theories and may also be an aid in understanding the Livonian  
version of the statutory theory. Castile-Le&oacute;n, together with France, was a 
classic example of exemptio imperii, or a region not pertaining to the Reich.  
Exemptio imperii led to the idea that the princes of regions not belonging to 
the Empire enjoyed full legislative powers in their lands. Roman law as ius com-
mune thus had no political justification in Castile or France. Roman law never-
theless gained a position as an expression of rationality (pro ratione), as part of 
customary law, or by force of royal acceptance. Royal laws in the non-imperial 
regions such as Castile were no longer considered to be ius proprium, but now 
ius commune. Roman law still continued to be considered ius commune as well, 
but in the writings of Spanish scholars it often carried epithets such as law &ldquo;of 
the Romans,&rdquo; &ldquo;of the emperors,&rdquo; or &ldquo;of the jurisconsultants and emperors.&rdquo;50
</p>
<p>The French humanists went even further: Fran&ccedil;ois Duaren (1509&ndash;1559) and 
Hugo Donellus (1527&ndash;1591) equalled ius gentium with ius commune. For them, 
Roman law was now just an example of ius proprium. However, since Roman 
law embodied the essential elements of natural law and law of nations, the in-
tellectual operation of the humanists led to the same result arrived at by others

</p>
<p>using other justifications: Roman law as an embodiment of the law of nations 
obliged all nations, including those outside of the Empire.51
</p>
<p>This versified international doctrinal context of the sixteenth century Eu-
ropean jurisprudence helps to understand the Livonian formula. The Livonian 
version had it that recourse should be taken to Swedish laws &ldquo;whenever one 
could not be sure&rdquo; of the local sources (&ldquo;wo dar aber nicht eine Gewi&szlig;heit nicht 
vorhanden&rdquo;). It does not use any variant of the usual phrase of the conditional 
theories: the Livonian law does not talk about &ldquo;bringing the law&rdquo; to the court. 
Thus, it seems to imply that the parties were not responsible for proving the 
existence of the local sources and their normative content. The court was sup-
posed to know it ex officio, which makes sense in the relatively small territory 
with no huge amount of local laws. The Swedish law was presumed to prevail 
in unclear situations &ndash; a case of fundata intentio, in other words.
</p>
<p>Second, a material check was to be performed on the Livonian sources. They 
were to be applied only if they were not against &ldquo;the word of God or the royal 
ius superioritatis&rdquo; (&ldquo;soweit dieselbe dem Worte Gottes oder dem K&ouml;nigl. juri supe-
rioritatis nicht entgegen&rdquo;). This is an original solution not seen elsewhere, and 
one which lessens the significance of the local sources, or at least underlines 
divine law&rsquo;s authority as the source of law.
</p>
<p>The other part of Livonian formula is also interesting. It does not say, in the 
usual German way, that ius commune or Kaiserrecht would be subsidiary to 
Swedish law. Instead, it is said that the Swedish laws need to be in accordance 
(&ldquo;einstimmig&rdquo;) with the ius saniorum populorum, in other words, the law of na-
tions. As we saw above, the sixteenth-century French humanist jurisprudence 
(as well as the Spanish scholars) had justified the use of Roman law by equat-
ing it with the law of nations and natural law. This again makes perfect sense in 
Livonia, which had ceased to part of the Empire and was now part of Sweden, 
which had never pertained to the Empire. Instead of calling ius commune Ro-
man law, it was politically more suitable to speak of ius saniorum populorum.
</p>
<p>The wording of the Livonian statutory clause is interesting in yet another 
way. The local Livonian laws shall be applied, if they do not contradict the 
Swedish laws or the word of God. The Swedish laws shall be applied if no lo-
cal law is available, if the Swedish law does not contradict the ius commune. 
In other words, the ius commune dominates the construction. Livonian law 
cannot violate Swedish law, which cannot violate ius commune (expressed as 
&ldquo;the common laws of the civilized peoples&rdquo;). This seems to have been intended 
to diminish the importance of Swedish law in relation to ius commune. The  
Livonian courts were to judge according to the local customs in the first

</p>
<p>place &ndash; insofar as they were not against God&rsquo;s law or royal law, and the contents 
were known &ndash; then according to the Swedish law, and in the last instance ac-
cording to ius commune. The principle of fundata intentio was in force in the 
sense that Swedish laws were to be interpreted in accordance with the &ldquo;com-
mon laws of the civilized peoples.&rdquo;52
</p>
<p>The particular version of the Livonian statute theory can well be under-
stood as further development of the capitulation treaties, which had guaran-
teed the Livonian estates the right to continue using their own laws. Already in 
1601, when Swedes conquered parts of Livonia for the first time, Duke Carl of  
S&ouml;dermanland guaranteed the representatives of the nobility (Ritterschaften) 
of Wenden, Dorpat, and Pernau that they would get to keep &ldquo;all their privileges, 
ancient contracts, statutes, and customs of the land&rdquo; (&ldquo;alle Privilegien, uralten 
Vertr&auml;ge, Beliebungen, Recesse, Statuten und Gewohnheiten des Landes&rdquo;). In 
1614, when Gustav ii Adolf had just reconquered Livonia from the Poles, the 
noblemen of Dorpat and Riga hastened to beg the King that he remove the Pol-
ish laws violating their privileges. After the final conquest in 1629 the privileges 
were confirmed again, although in a provisory way and in general terms only: 
it was the idea of the Swedish crown to go through them later in more detail, 
although this never happened. Instead, the privileges of the Livonian estates 
were confirmed many times during the Swedish era as well. This was habitual 
in the early modern period whenever a new regent stepped to the throne, but 
it still tells us something about the strong position that the local laws had even 
from the point of view of the Swedes. The town privileges were also confirmed 
one by one at the start of the conquest.53
</p>
<p>To sum up, the wording of the Livonian statutory theory was probably a 
political compromise: the local customs, in order to be applied, could not con-
tradict Swedish law, and Swedish law could not contradict ius commune. Many 
different versions of the statutory theories were developed in sixteenth &ndash; and 
</p>
<p>52 The courts were to judge &ldquo;erstlich nach lieffl&auml;ndischen Rechten l&ouml;blichen Gewohnheiten, 
soweit dieselbe dem Worte Gottes oder dem K&ouml;nigl. juri superioritatis nicht entgegen, wo dar 
aber nicht eine Gewi&szlig;heit nicht vorhanden, nach Schwedischen Rechten, Constitutionen, 
Reichs-Abschieden, und Gebr&auml;uchen, so mit dem jure saniorum populorum communi ein-
stimmig, sprechen und verabschieden.&rdquo; Buddenbrock ii, 104&ndash;105.
</p>
<p>53 See Bunge, Geschichte der livl&auml;ndischen Rechtsquellen, 198&ndash;200. Queen Christina con-
firmed the privileges in 1648, confirming also the mittleres livl&auml;ndisches Ritterrecht. Gus-
tav x confirmed the privileges provisorily in 1658, and so did Queen Hedvig Eleonora in 
1660, however making a reservation again, as ius superioritatis of the Swedish crown was 
concerned. Charles xi did the same in 1678, stating that the privileges, laws, and customs 
that had been in force before the Polish time were still in force.</p>

<p>seventeenth-century Europe and America to meet varying political realities. 
The solution grafted for Livonia was just one amongst the many.
</p>
<p>But statutory theories, varied and customized as they may have been, were 
only a starting point. Legal practice lived its own life. The sources encountered 
in the German sources of the early modern period show a legal practice differ-
ent to the legal theory. The system of legal sources in the German courts has 
been explained in two important works, one by Peter Oestmann and another 
one by Steffen Wunderlich.54 The picture that we get from the early modern 
German legal practice is quite different from the picture (or pictures) that old-
er research has produced of the early modern scholarship. The parties would 
present to the courts all kinds of sources they deemed necessary regardless 
of whether they were or should have been known to the courts according to 
the principle of iura novit curia.55 The advocates, on behalf of their clients, 
used a wide variety of all possible legal sources, from canon and Roman law to 
natural law, privileges, extracts of legal scholarship to prejudicates, customary 
law, and statutory sources (both domestic and foreign, and town laws), thus 
producing a true &ldquo;multiplicity of law&rdquo; (Rechtsvielfalt).56 The courts themselves 
used a wide variety of sources as well, referring frequently to legal scholarship 
and case law too.57 One thing that was clearly according to the contemporary 
theory and the prevailing modern description thereof was that courts  treated 
Roman law according to the principle of fundata intentio: in unclear cases  
Roman law was given prevalence.58

nian circumstances? How much was taken into the statutory text, and what

derlich&rsquo;s from the sixteenth century and Oestmann&rsquo;s from the whole period of the Court&rsquo;s 
existence, 1495&ndash;1806. The Imperial Chamber Court was the most learned of German 
Courts, as far as both its judges and its advocates are concerned, but obviously cannot 
be directly compared to the Livonian lower courts or even to the High Court. Oestmann&rsquo;s 
work, however, not only aims to expound the legal sources of the Reichskammergericht, 
but also those of the lower courts from which the cases were appealed to the highest 
instance. Wunderlich&rsquo;s book is an edition of a private notebook of a Reichkammergericht 
judge.

<p>was supposed to be known self-evidently by the learned lawyers, was a practi-
cal matter. The general theory behind both statutes, as far the teachings on 
the admissibility of customary law and the hierarchy of legal sources was con-
cerned, was the same. However, although the theory was the same, the cir-
cumstances in which the propositions were applied were different. The whole 
question of whether the Livonian courts knew the content of local laws was, at 
best, theoretical, and does not appear in the sources at all. One only rarely runs 
into references to legal sources in Livonian court records. In this respect, they 
are no gold mines. It is exceptional to encounter Swedish or domestic Livonian 
sources, gemeines R echt, Roman law, or divine law either in the lawyers&rsquo; briefs 
or the ratio decidendi of the courts themselves. The observer does not run into 
a complex mass of legal sources, presented to court by the advocates. The small 
size of the province largely explains the fact that legal sources are rarely men-
tioned in the court protocols. Even when legal sources are mentioned, their 
contents and validity appear self-evident and uncontested. The very fact that 
the sources so rarely deserve a mention &ndash; either by the court or by the parties &ndash;  
speaks for the fact that it was, most of the time, fairly clear to everyone in-
volved what the law was.</p>

<p>Conclusions
</p>
<p>6.1 The Starting Point: Livonian and Swedish Law before the Conquest
</p>
<p>The introduction of Swedish rule in Livonia caused the need to organize the 
judicial system, which was more or less in ruins after many wars. The situation 
is not unique in legal history. Legal reforms, however, tend to be conservative 
and path-dependent, even when reformers might in principle wish or have to 
rebuild a system more thoroughly. Resources rarely allow for more than partial 
reforms &ndash; one takes what one has and takes that as a starting point. Time is one 
of the limited resources: a functioning legal and judicial order helps create and 
maintain peace and order, which are fundamental priorities when securing a 
successful change of power. It is in the interest of the conqueror to establish 
a functioning legal order as soon as possible. Human resources also tend to 
be limited. Implementing a new legal order successfully requires profession-
als, who are experts in the legal systems of the conquering power, in the legal 
system of the conquered area, or in both. Limited resources in most cases lead 
the new power-holder more or less to rely on the existing structures. Examples 
from different epochs and different parts of the world abound. Napoleon&rsquo;s Civ-
il Code, often thought to have produced a true revolution in law, was largely 
based in the already existing civil law literature such as Robert-Joseph Pothier&rsquo;s 
(1699&ndash;1772) Trait&eacute; des obligations.1 Although no-one can deny the huge chang-
es the Russian revolution of 1917 brought to all walks of life, law included, the 
revolution did not change all law overnight.2 The Maoist revolution in China 
caused deep-going transformations in law, but was hardly a point zero: for in-
stance, the Confucian philosophy, so fundamental for the Chinese legal think-
ing, has ever since continued to influence Chinese law in various ways.3
</p>
<p>All these examples are from the modern period, and so from the epoch of 
the powerful state much more capable of effecting the desired legal changes

<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>than the early modern political powerholders were. Napoleon&rsquo;s Code is famous 
for its wish to render all other legal sources unnecessary. No doubt also both 
Communist revolutions were marketed as completely new beginnings, shed-
ding the bourgeois legal past. This is typical of modern legal positivism, in 
which a whim of the legislator or a court &ndash; although neither is omnipotent &ndash;  
can create new legal realities much more effectively than before. However, if 
even modern legislators have proved themselves incapable of complete legal 
transformation, this was so much less the case in the early modern period, 
when written statutory law had yet not gained a supreme position. The other 
sources &ndash; court practice, legal literature, customary law &ndash; would always re-
main. Therefore, the idea of completely replacing old law with a new legal or-
der should be taken with a grain of salt, as a modern invention. Just as it did not 
automatically occur to an early modern conqueror to substitute a new political 
system for the old one, normally the idea was not to introduce a wholesale 
legal reform, but rather to build on the existing one. This was the modus ope-
randi of the early empire or the conglomerate. Seventeenth-century Sweden 
was a typical early modern empire, with possessions added through war in the 
former Danish territories, Germany, and the Baltic region. Whenever new ter-
ritories were added to a composite state, the conditions were always separately 
negotiated. Nothing else was plausible.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to know on which base the Swedish conquerors 
began to build the Livonian legal system in the 1630s. Because reforms of this 
kind always presuppose interaction between the old legal system and that of 
the conqueror, it has been important first to draw a comparison of the Livo-
nian and Swedish law before the conquest.
</p>
<p>Clear differences emerge between Livonian and Swedish law in the early 
seventeenth century. Livonia&rsquo;s political and legal system remained heteroge-
neous from the Middle Ages until the Swedish era. Until the Polish era (from 
the 1560s onwards), Livonia was a loose confederation consisting of four bish-
oprics and the land of the Teutonic Order. Of these, the Order was more cen-
tralized than the bishoprics, but all of them had yielded much of the power 
to their vassals. All of the estates were governed by their own bodies of law: 
the towns had their urban laws, the nobles their feudal knightly laws (Ritter-
recht), the Church its canon law, and the peasants their customary manorial 
law (Bauerrecht). To a certain extent, learned Roman law had been adopted 
as a consequence of Livonia belonging to the Holy Roman Empire, through its 
universities and high courts. Medieval Livonia was thus essentially not differ-
ent from other parts of the medieval Reich.
</p>
<p>The Polish overlords changed the Livonian administrative system, but 
touched on the legal order only very little. As the existing court archives reveal, </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>the law of Dorpat shows hardly any signs of Polish law in the 1620s. The Polish 
kings made several attempts to codify Livonian customary law, and to intro-
duce Roman and German law to the region. Constitutiones Livoniae (1582), the 
first Ordinatio Livoniae (1589), and the second Ordinatio Livoniae (1598) each 
created controversies of their own, especially as the position of the nobility is 
concerned. David Hilchen drafted his proposal for Livonian Landrecht (1600), 
building the public law part on the second Ordinatio, and the private law part 
on Roman law and on Livonian legal practice. It is probable that Hilchen&rsquo;s Lan-
drecht influenced Livonian legal practice during the last decades of the Polish 
rule, but this cannot be verified without empirical studies.
</p>
<p>The law of Sweden proper was different from Livonian law. The Swedish 
estates were weak, whereas royal power had been on the increase since Gus-
tav Vasa (1523&ndash;60). The Reformation made former church courts part of the 
state machinery, and much of the canon law was incorporated into secular 
law. Sweden became centralized not only politically but legally as well, with 
royal statutory law gaining paramount importance and clearly outweighing 
the other sources.
</p>
<p>The difference between Livonia and the monolithic Sweden was indeed 
vast. In spite of the chaotic situation that had lasted for decades, Livonians, 
along with the rest of central Europe, had been on their way to a reception of 
ius commune. In Sweden, the reception had not been taken as far and consisted 
largely of filtering the ius commune norms and adapting them in a simplified 
form for local use.
</p>
<p>Compared to Swedish legal culture, its Livonian counterpart was more 
learned and more professional. Its links to the German cultural sphere were and 
remained stronger than its links to Sweden, the legal culture of which had not de-
veloped a transferable export product in theway that ius commune or gemeines 
Recht had. Swedish law was rooted in the Swedish peasant society: it had devel-
oped only little from the medieval, peasant-run legal order to a learned, profes-
sional one. In the early seventeenth century, the Swedish law was a legal order 
for the peasants and by the peasants. This showed not only in the material legal 
norms, but also in the way legal procedure and the judiciary were organized.
</p>
<p>6.2 The Organization of the Judiciary in Swedish Livonia
</p>
<p>The organization of the judiciary belonged to the most urgent questions that 
the Swedes needed to decide in Livonian lands. Even though early modern em-
pires generally felt no pressing need to unify their legal systems, in the case of 
Livonia the Swedes found little left of the old structures and were obliged to </p>
<p/>

<p>259Conclusions
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>construct a new judiciary. The Swedish intention, judged by the ordinances 
of the early 1630s, was to bring the Livonian legal procedures as close to the 
Swedish model as possible. This was clearly the goal even if the Livonian legal 
tradition was much closer to the learned European models than to the Swed-
ish tradition. The judicial structure was to resemble the Swedish. The Livoni-
an Landgerichte were the counterparts of the Swedish h&auml;radsr&auml;tter and the 
Dorpat High Court joined the series of other high courts within the Realm. 
The lower courts became, however, different from the lower courts in Sweden 
proper, where free peasants formed an essential part of the countryside courts, 
the h&auml;radsr&auml;tter. In Livonia, free peasants were too few for the judicial system 
to be built on their contribution, and serfs could not be made to sit in general 
law courts. Thus, the Livonian lower courts of the countryside (Landgerichte) 
thus came to consist of noble judges, who mostly decided cases in which es-
tates other than peasants figured as parties. Peasants usually appeared as the 
accused in criminal cases. Manorial courts handled the rest of the peasant 
cases: disciplinary cases, petty criminal cases, and civil cases.
</p>
<p>The urban courts followed the Riga model. The most important were the 
bailiff &rsquo;s courts (Niedergericht, Vogteigericht, or K&auml;mnergericht) and the magis-
trate acting as court (often Obergericht, Rat). The K&auml;mnergericht decided petty 
criminal cases and inspected the more serious ones, which the town court 
finally decided. Both courts were lay-dominated. Professional lawyers were 
rarely seen in any of the courts.
</p>
<p>The High Court of Dorpat was established in 1630, as the third of a series of 
high courts founded in seventeenth-century Sweden. The judges were to be 
Swedish, German, or Livonian. The proportion of Swedish judges remained 
always low, and most of the judges were Baltic Germans. Although half of the 
posts were allocated to noblemen, they were often &ndash; especially towards the end 
of the period &ndash; men with legal training.
</p>
<p>Even though the Swedish conquerors thus needed to build the Livonian ju-
diciary almost from scratch, local social circumstances limited the options de 
facto available for the conquerors. Swedes could not simply transplant their 
own laws to Livonia, where the estates were much more developed and power-
ful than in Sweden proper. This was reflected in the shape that country courts, 
town courts, and the high court took.
</p>
<p>6.3 The Judicial Procedure
</p>
<p>The structure of the judicial system remained unchanged throughout the Swed-
ish era, something which cannot be said about the legal procedures. Let us take  </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>criminal procedure first. Two fundamental changes in criminal adjudication 
emerge, when the beginning of the Swedish period is compared to its end.  
First, official prosecutors became more active towards the end of the century. 
The prosecutors got involved, above all, in sex crimes and those which threat-
ened public order. Duel cases, after the duel ordinances of the 1680, are a good 
example. Second, the use of inquisitorial procedure increased. It did not ap-
pear in the early years at all, but became frequent during the latter half of the 
seventeenth century. Inquisitorial procedure was practically only used against 
peasants.
</p>
<p>Besides changes, there was also continuity. Pure accusatorial procedure, 
without a prosecutor, dominated the Livonian criminal proceedings all 
throughout the century. Accusatorial procedure was mainly used between 
social classes other than peasants. Cases of theft, violence, and slander were 
typically processed this way. Comparing the years 1640&ndash;1641 to the years  
1688&ndash;1690 for the Pernau Lower Court shows that the number of purely ac-
cusatorial criminal cases diminished to a half. In general, it could be said  
that accusatorial cases all but disappeared. This is especially the case if the 
prosecutor-driven accusatorial cases are added to the list. The Livonian lower 
court procedure was thus fundamentally accusatorial throughout the Swed-
ish period. On the other hand, it should be emphasized that the ius commune 
procedure was flexible by nature. What started as accusatorial procedure could 
end in the inquisitorial mode.
</p>
<p>According to the common scholarly opinion, the inquisitorial procedure 
took over from the accusatorial procedure in most of the central parts of  
Europe from early on. However, it is doubtful to what extent this is the general 
European story. Research is still lacking, and much of the existing research is 
entirely based on legal literature. Without archival research it is, however, dif-
ficult to say anything definitive about the use of the different modes of proce-
dure in other parts of Europe. This study has hopefully contributed something 
new to the discussion, showing that at least in seventeenth-century Livonia 
accusatorial procedure had all but lost its importance.
</p>
<p>The lawyer-dominated nature of the civil proceeding not only brought  
with it the gemeines Recht proceedings but also the gemeines Recht legal  
sources, as lawyers often referred to Corpus iuris civilis, especially the Di-
gest, and sometimes also to ius commune scholarship. The lawyerization of  
the urban courts took longer, but had also evolved into a fact at least by the 
1660s.
</p>
<p>Professional advocates appeared in both kinds of Livonian district courts 
already in the early years of the Swedish rule, although nearly not in all cases. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>261Conclusions
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Parties themselves handled most cases, or had representatives other than le-
gal professionals. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the situation 
changed, and lawyers regularly assisted clients in civil cases and sometimes in 
criminal cases as well, especially noble clients when accused for crimes. The 
procedure in the High Court was from the outset completely in the hands of 
learned lawyers.
</p>
<p>The Swedish crown seldom interfered the working of the Livonian judiciary. 
The &ldquo;judicial revolution&rdquo; had by the seventeenth century advanced to a certain 
extent. In other words, although in theory the judiciary could not gain inde-
pendence from the crown, in practice the division of labour had developed 
to the point in which the crown and its officials rarely bothered to venture 
into the judicial area. If pressing needs occurred, commissarial courts were 
always at the crown&rsquo;s disposition. They could be established flexibly to handle 
all kinds of cases which needed special attention and for which the regular 
judiciary was not deemed sufficient.
</p>
<p>The procedure of the lower courts itself soon drifted further and further 
from the Swedish lay-dominated model, as legal professionals took an effec-
tive grip on the procedures &ndash; especially the civil one &ndash; in Livonia. Procedures  
more or less modelled after the procedure of the Imperial Chamber Court 
became the order of the day in accusatorial cases both with and without a  
prosecutor. The accusatorial procedure as well as civil procedure became heav-
ily dependent on writing and the exchange of briefs, with lawyers frequently 
appearing in court or at least drafting legal instruments on behalf of their 
clients.
</p>
<p>In proper criminal procedure, or inquisitorial procedure, the differences 
between Livonia and Sweden proper never became as great, undoubtedly be-
cause of the sparse involvement of professional lawyers. In some respects, the 
development went to the opposite direction: judicial torture, which was still 
commonplace in Livonia at the beginning of the period &ndash; unlike in Sweden 
proper &ndash; but was rooted out in Livonia also by the 1680s.
</p>
<p>The high court procedure was also based on the exchange of written briefs, 
in much the same way as the lower court procedure. Lawyers appeared person-
ally in court to read their briefs and to collect copies of the opposing party&rsquo;s 
writings. The high court procedure was quite similar to that of the Svea High 
Court and the other high courts in Sweden. The similarity is understandable, 
because all high courts started more or less from scratch, in that their pro-
cedure was not inherited from earlier appeals courts in Sweden proper or  
Livonia. Instead, the procedure of all of the courts was much influenced by 
the procedure of the German Imperial Chamber Court. The learnedness of the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>chapter 6262
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>high court procedure that came naturally for the Livonian high court also be-
came an important feature of other Swedish high courts.
</p>
<p>High court decisions could not be appealed in the ius commune sense  
of the term. Parties could instead petition for an extraordinary remedy, ben-
eficium revisionis. Revision petitions against decisions of the Dorpat High 
Court remained rare, however. Revision procedures were expensive, and it is  
understandable that most of the revision cases came from the Svea High  
Court district and not from more distant courts such as Dorpat. It is also  
probable that the monetary value of the cases in the Svea district were on  
average higher than in Livonia. This, however, must remain a mere guess,  
since no comparative research has been possible here on that particular 
question.
</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the Swedish rule, the Livonian nobility firmly 
controlled the local judiciary and legal procedure. Swedish attempts to change 
this came late, and Livonian legal procedures remained closely oriented  
towards gemeines Recht until the end of the Swedish period &ndash; and in fact 
beyond.
</p>
<p>6.4 Legal Sources in the Courts of Swedish Livonia
</p>
<p>References to legal sources of any kind are rare Livonian court records. Only 
exceptionally does one encounter Swedish or domestic Livonian sources, 
gemeines Recht, Roman law, natural law, or divine law either in the lawyers&rsquo; 
writing or the courts&rsquo; ratio decidendi. When legal sources are mentioned, their 
contents and validity appear self-evident and uncontested. This can probably 
best be explained by the small size of the province. Most of the time it was 
clear to the courts and the lawyers what the law was. This is different to what 
we know about courts in European heartlands, in which lawyers and courts 
invoked learned legal sources much more frequently.
</p>
<p>The Livonian practice of using legal sources was, however, different from 
not only the European heartlands but from Sweden proper as well. Swedish 
high courts, established in the seventeenth century, were staffed largely with 
learned lawyers, which shows in the way they used legal sources. Swedish lower 
courts were different: lay-dominated as they were, practically the only sources 
encountered in their protocols are royal statutory law and, sometimes, custom-
ary law. The Livonian practice of referring to a wider variety of legal sources at 
least sometimes reveals that their way of understanding sources was relatively 
open and less dependent on statutory law.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>263Conclusions
</p>
<p>&lt;UN&gt;
</p>
<p>Legal practice reveals that Swedish statutory law gained only limited influ-
ence in Livonia. The most obvious exception were the duel ordinances, which 
were effectively applied. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the pro-
hibition of judicial torture was also enforced onto Livonian courts. Despite 
these exceptions, it is fair to say that Swedish law could only acquire limited 
bridgehead in Livonia during the eight decades of the Swedish rule.</p>
