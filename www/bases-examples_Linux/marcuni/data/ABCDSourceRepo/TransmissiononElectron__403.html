<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Preface
</p>
<p>How is this book different from the many other TEM books? It has several unique
</p>
<p>features but what we think distinguishes it from all other such books is that it is truly a
</p>
<p>textbook. We wrote it to be read by, and taught to, senior undergraduates and starting
</p>
<p>graduate students, rather than studied in a research laboratory. We wrote it using the
</p>
<p>same style and sentence construction that we have used in countless classroom
</p>
<p>lectures, rather than how we have written our countless (and much-less read) formal
</p>
<p>scientific papers. In this respect particularly, we have been deliberate in not referencing
</p>
<p>the sources of every experimental fact or theoretical concept (although we do include
</p>
<p>some hints and clues in the chapters). However, at the end of each chapter we have
</p>
<p>included groups of references that should lead you to the best sources in the literature
</p>
<p>and help you go into more depth as you become more confident about what you are
</p>
<p>looking for. We are great believers in the value of history as the basis for under-
</p>
<p>standing the present and so the history of the techniques and key historical references
</p>
<p>are threaded throughout the book. Just because a reference is dated in the previous
</p>
<p>century (or even the antepenultimate century) doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t useful! Likewise,
</p>
<p>with the numerous figures drawn from across the fields of materials science and
</p>
<p>engineering and nanotechnology, we do not reference the source in each caption.
</p>
<p>But at the very end of the book each of our many generous colleagues whose work we
</p>
<p>have used is clearly acknowledged.
</p>
<p>The book consists of 40 relatively small chapters (with a few notable Carter
</p>
<p>exceptions!). The contents of most of the chapters can be covered in a typical lecture
</p>
<p>of 50-75 minutes (especially if you talk as fast as Williams). Furthermore, each of the
</p>
<p>four softbound volumes is flexible enough to be usable at the TEM console so you can
</p>
<p>check what you are seeing against what you should be seeing. Most importantly
</p>
<p>perhaps, the softbound version is cheap enough for all serious students to buy. So
</p>
<p>we hope you won&rsquo;t have to try and work out the meaning of the many complex color
</p>
<p>diagrams from secondhand B&amp;W copies that you acquired from a former student. We
</p>
<p>have deliberately used color where it is useful rather than simply for its own sake (since
</p>
<p>all electron signals are colorless anyhow). There are numerous boxes throughout the
</p>
<p>text, drawing your attention to key information (green), warnings about mistakes you
</p>
<p>might easily make (amber), and dangerous practices or common errors (red).
</p>
<p>Our approach throughout this text is to answer two fundamental questions:
</p>
<p>Why should we use a particular TEM technique?
How do we put the technique into practice?
</p>
<p>In answering the first question we attempt to establish a sound theoretical basis
</p>
<p>where necessary although not always giving all the details. We use this knowledge to
</p>
<p>answer the second question by explaining operational details in a generic sense and
</p>
<p>showing many illustrative figures. In contrast, other TEM books tend to be either
</p>
<p>strongly theoretical or predominantly descriptive (often covering more than just
</p>
<p>TEM). We view our approach as a compromise between the two extremes, covering
</p>
<p>enough theory to be reasonably rigorous without incurring the wrath of electron
</p>
<p>physicists yet containing sufficient hands-on instructions and practical examples to
</p>
<p>be useful to the materials engineer/nanotechnologist who wants an answer to a
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>materials problem rather than just a set of glorious images, spectra, and diffraction
</p>
<p>patterns. We acknowledge that, in attempting to seek this compromise, we often gloss
</p>
<p>over the details of much of the physics and math behind the many techniques but
</p>
<p>contend that the content is usually approximately right (even if on occasions, it might
</p>
<p>be precisely incorrect!).
</p>
<p>Since this text covers the whole field of TEM we incorporate, to varying degrees,
</p>
<p>all the capabilities of the various kinds of current TEMs and we attempt to create a
</p>
<p>coherent view of the many aspects of these instruments. For instance, rather than
</p>
<p>separating out the broad-beam techniques of a traditional TEM from the focused-
</p>
<p>beam techniques of an analytical TEM, we treat these two approaches as different
</p>
<p>sides of the same coin. There is no reason to regard &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; bright-field imaging
</p>
<p>in a parallel-beam TEM as being more fundamental (although it is certainly a more-
</p>
<p>established technique) than annular dark-field imaging in a focused-beam STEM.
</p>
<p>Convergent beam, scanning beam, and selected-area diffraction are likewise integral
</p>
<p>parts of the whole of TEM diffraction.
</p>
<p>However, in the decade and more since the first edition was published, there has
</p>
<p>been a significant increase in the number of TEM and related techniques, greater
</p>
<p>sophistication in the microscope&rsquo;s experimental capabilities, astonishing improve-
</p>
<p>ments in computer control of the instrument, and new hardware designs and amazing
</p>
<p>developments in software to model the gigabytes of data generated by these almost-
</p>
<p>completely digital instruments. Much of this explosion of information has coincided
</p>
<p>with the worldwide drive to explore the nanoworld, and the still-ongoing effects of
</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s law. It is not possible to include all of this new knowledge in the second
</p>
<p>edition without transforming the already doorstop sized text into something capable
</p>
<p>of halting a large projectile in its tracks. It is still essential that this second edition
</p>
<p>teaches you to understand the essence of the TEM before you attempt to master the
</p>
<p>latest advances. But we personally cannot hope to understand fully all the new
</p>
<p>techniques, especially as we both descend into more administrative positions in our
</p>
<p>professional lives. Therefore, we have prevailed on almost 20 of our close friends and
</p>
<p>colleagues to put together with us a companion text (TEM; a companion text,
</p>
<p>Williams and Carter (Eds.) Springer 2010) to which we will refer throughout this
</p>
<p>second edition. The companion text is just as it says&mdash;it&rsquo;s a friend whose advice you
</p>
<p>should seek when the main text isn&rsquo;t enough. The companion is not necessarily more
</p>
<p>advanced but is certainly more detailed in dealing with key recent developments as
</p>
<p>well as some more traditional aspects of TEM that have seen a resurgence of interest.
</p>
<p>We have taken our colleagues&rsquo; contributions and rewritten them in a similar conversa-
</p>
<p>tional vein to this main text and we hope that this approach, combined with the in-
</p>
<p>depth cross-referencing between the two texts will guide you as you start down the
</p>
<p>rewarding path to becoming a transmission microscopist.
</p>
<p>We each bring more than 35 years of teaching and research in all aspects of TEM.
</p>
<p>Our research into different materials includes metals, alloys, ceramics, semiconduc-
</p>
<p>tors, glasses, composites, nano and other particles, atomic-level planar interfaces, and
</p>
<p>other crystal defects. (The lack of polymeric and biological materials in our own
</p>
<p>research is evident in their relative absence in this book.) We have contributed to the
</p>
<p>training of a generation of (we hope) skilled microscopists, several of whom have
</p>
<p>followed us as professors and researchers in the EM field. These students represent our
</p>
<p>legacy to our beloved research field and we are overtly proud of their accomplish-
</p>
<p>ments. But we also expect some combination of these (still relatively young) men and
</p>
<p>women to write the third edition.We know that they, like us, will find that writing such
</p>
<p>a text broadens their knowledge considerably and will also be the source of much joy,
</p>
<p>frustration, and enduring friendship.We hope you have asmuch fun reading this book
</p>
<p>as we had writing it, but we hope also that it takes you much less time. Lastly, we
</p>
<p>encourage you to send us any comments, both positive and negative. We can both be

<p>Foreword to First Edition
</p>
<p>Electronmicroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of materials by completing
</p>
<p>the processing-structure-properties links down to atomistic levels. It is now even
</p>
<p>possible to tailor the microstructure (and mesostructure) of materials to achieve
</p>
<p>specific sets of properties; the extraordinary abilities of modern transmission electron
</p>
<p>microscopy&mdash;TEM&mdash;instruments to provide almost all the structural, phase, and
</p>
<p>crystallographic data allow us to accomplish this feat. Therefore, it is obvious that
</p>
<p>any curriculum in modern materials education must include suitable courses in
</p>
<p>electron microscopy. It is also essential that suitable texts be available for the prep-
</p>
<p>aration of the students and researchers who must carry out electron microscopy
</p>
<p>properly and quantitatively.
</p>
<p>The 40 chapters of this new text by Barry Carter and DavidWilliams (like many of
</p>
<p>us, well schooled in microscopy at Cambridge and Oxford) do just that. If you want to
</p>
<p>learn about electron microscopy from specimen preparation (the ultimate limitation);
</p>
<p>or via the instrument; or how to use the TEM correctly to perform imaging, diffrac-
</p>
<p>tion, and spectroscopy&mdash;it&rsquo;s all there! This, to my knowledge, is the only complete text
</p>
<p>now available that includes all the remarkable advances made in the field of TEM in
</p>
<p>the past 30 to 40 years. The timing for this book is just right and, personally, it is
</p>
<p>exciting to have been part of the development it covers&mdash;developments that have
</p>
<p>impacted so heavily on materials science.
</p>
<p>In case there are people out there who still think TEM is just taking pretty pictures
</p>
<p>to fill up one&rsquo;s bibliography, please stop, pause, take a look at this book, and digest the
</p>
<p>extraordinary intellectual demands required of the microscopist in order to do the job
</p>
<p>properly: crystallography, diffraction, image contrast, inelastic scattering events, and
</p>
<p>spectroscopy. Remember, these used to be fields in themselves. Today, one has to
</p>
<p>understand the fundamentals of all these areas before one can hope to tackle signifi-
</p>
<p>cant problems in materials science. TEM is a technique of characterizing materials
</p>
<p>down to the atomic limits. It must be used with care and attention, in many cases
</p>
<p>involving teams of experts from different venues. The fundamentals are, of course,
</p>
<p>based in physics, so aspiring materials scientists would be well advised to have prior
</p>
<p>exposure to, for example, solid-state physics, crystallography, and crystal defects, as
</p>
<p>well as a basic understanding of materials science, for without the latter, how can a
</p>
<p>person see where TEM can (or may) be put to best use?
</p>
<p>So much for the philosophy. This fine new book definitely fills a gap. It provides a
</p>
<p>sound basis for research workers and graduate students interested in exploring those
</p>
<p>aspects of structure, especially defects, that control properties. Even undergraduates
</p>
<p>are now expected (and rightly) to know the basis for electron microscopy, and this
</p>
<p>book, or appropriate parts of it, can also be utilized for undergraduate curricula in
</p>
<p>science and engineering.
</p>
<p>The authors can be proud of an enormous task, very well done.

<p>Foreword to Second Edition
</p>
<p>This book is an exciting entry into the world of atomic structure and characterization
</p>
<p>in materials science, with very practical instruction on how you can see it and measure
</p>
<p>it, using an electron microscope. You will learn an immense amount from it, and
</p>
<p>probably want to keep it for the rest of your life (particularly if the problems cost you
</p>
<p>some effort!).
</p>
<p>Is nanoscience &lsquo;&lsquo;the next industrial revolution&rsquo;&rsquo;? Perhaps that will be some combi-
</p>
<p>nation of energy, environmental and nanoscience. Whatever it is, the new methods
</p>
<p>which now allow control of materials synthesis at the atomic level will be a large part
</p>
<p>of it, from the manufacture of jet engine turbine-blades to that of catalysts, polymers,
</p>
<p>ceramics and semiconductors. As an exercise, work out how much reduction would
</p>
<p>result in the transatlantic airfare if aircraft turbine blade temperatures could be
</p>
<p>increased by 2008C. Now calculate the reduction in CO2 emission, and increased
</p>
<p>efficiency (reduced coal use for the same amount of electricity) resulting from this
</p>
<p>temperature increase for a coal-fired electrical generating turbine. Perhaps you will be
</p>
<p>the person to invent these urgently needed things! The US Department of Energy&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>Grand Challenge report on the web lists the remarkable advances in exotic nanoma-
</p>
<p>terials useful for energy research, from separation media in fuel cells, to photovoltaics
</p>
<p>and nano-catalysts which might someday electrolyze water under sunlight alone.
</p>
<p>Beyond these functional and structural materials, we are now also starting to see for
</p>
<p>the first time the intentional fabrication of atomic structures in which atoms can be
</p>
<p>addressed individually, for example, as quantum computers based perhaps on quan-
</p>
<p>tum dots. &lsquo;Quantum control&rsquo; has been demonstrated, and we have seen fluorescent
</p>
<p>nanodots which can be used to label proteins.
</p>
<p>Increasingly, in order to find out exactly what new material we have made, and
</p>
<p>how perfect it is (and so to improve the synthesis), these new synthesis methods must
</p>
<p>be accompanied by atomic scale compositional and structural analysis. The transmis-
</p>
<p>sion electron microscope (TEM) has emerged as the perfect tool for this purpose. It
</p>
<p>can now give us atomic-resolution images of materials and their defects, together with
</p>
<p>spectroscopic data and diffraction patterns from sub-nanometer regions. The field-
</p>
<p>emission electron gun it uses is still the brightest particle source in all of physics, so that
</p>
<p>electron microdiffraction produces the most intense signal from the smallest volume
</p>
<p>of matter in all of science. For the TEM electron beam probe, we have magnetic lenses
</p>
<p>(now aberration corrected) which are extremely difficult for our X-ray and neutron
</p>
<p>competitors to produce (even with much more limited performance) and, perhaps
</p>
<p>most important of all, our energy-loss spectroscopy provides unrivalled spatial reso-
</p>
<p>lution combined with parallel detection (not possible with X-ray absorption spectro-
</p>
<p>scopy, where absorbed X-rays disappear, rather than losing some energy and
</p>
<p>continuing to the detector).
</p>
<p>Much of the advance in synthesis is the legacy of half a century of research in the
</p>
<p>semiconductor industry, as we attempt to synthesize and fabricate with other materi-
</p>
<p>als what is now so easily done with silicon. Exotic oxides, for example, can now be laid
</p>
<p>down layer by layer to form artificial crystal structures with new, useful properties.
</p>
<p>But it is also a result of the spectacular advances in materials characterization, and our
</p>
<p>ability to see structures at the atomic level. Perhaps the best example of this is the
</p>
<p>discovery of the carbon nanotube, which was first identified by using an electron
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>microscope. Any curious and observant electron microscopist can now discover new
</p>
<p>nanostructures just because they look interesting at the atomic scale. The important
</p>
<p>point is that if this is done in an environmental microscope, he or she will know how to
</p>
<p>make them, since the thermodynamic conditions will be recorded when using such a
</p>
<p>&lsquo;lab in a microscope&rsquo;. There are efforts at materials discovery by just such combina-
</p>
<p>torial trial-and-error methods, which could perhaps be incorporated into our electron
</p>
<p>microscopes. This is needed because there are often just &lsquo;too many possibilities&rsquo; in
</p>
<p>nature to explore in the computer &mdash; the number of possible structures rises very
</p>
<p>rapidly with the number of distinct types of atoms.
</p>
<p>It was Richard Feynman who said that, &lsquo;&lsquo;if, in some catastrophe, all scientific
</p>
<p>knowledge was lost, and only one sentence could be preserved, then the statement to
</p>
<p>be passed on, which contained the most information in the fewest words, would be
</p>
<p>that matter consists of atoms.&rsquo;&rsquo; But confidence thatmatter consists of atoms developed
</p>
<p>surprisingly recently and as late as 1900 many (including Kelvin) were unconvinced,
</p>
<p>despite Avagadro&rsquo;s work and Faraday&rsquo;s on electrodeposition. Einstein&rsquo;s Brownian
</p>
<p>motion paper of 1905 finally persuadedmost, as did Rutherford&rsquo;s experiments.Muller
</p>
<p>was first to see atoms (in his field-ion microscope in the early 1950s), andAlbert Crewe
</p>
<p>two decades later in Chicago, with his invention of the field-emission gun for his
</p>
<p>scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The Greek Atomists first sug-
</p>
<p>gested that a stone, cut repeatedly, would eventually lead to an indivisible smallest
</p>
<p>fragment, and indeed Democritus believed that &lsquo;&lsquo;nothing exists except vacuum and
</p>
<p>atoms. All else is opinion.&rsquo;&rsquo; Marco Polo remarks on the use of spectacles by the
</p>
<p>Chinese, but it was van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) whose series of papers in Phil.
</p>
<p>Trans. brought the microworld to the general scientific community for the first time
</p>
<p>using his much improved optical microscope. Robert Hooke&rsquo;s 1665 Micrographica
</p>
<p>sketches what he saw through his new compound microscope, including fascinating
</p>
<p>images of facetted crystallites, whose facet angles he explained with drawings of piles
</p>
<p>of cannon balls. Perhaps this was the first resurrection of the atomistic theory of
</p>
<p>matter since the Greeks. Zernike&rsquo;s phase-plate in the 1930s brought phase contrast to
</p>
<p>previously invisible ultra-thin biological &lsquo;phase objects&rsquo;, and so is the forerunner for
</p>
<p>the corresponding theory in high-resolution electron microscopy.
</p>
<p>The past fifty years has been a wonderfully exciting time for electron microscopists
</p>
<p>in materials science, with continuous rapid advances in all of its many modes and
</p>
<p>detectors. From the development of the theory of Bragg diffraction contrast and the
</p>
<p>column approximation, which enables us to understand TEM images of crystals and
</p>
<p>their defects, to the theory of high-resolution microscopy useful for atomic-scale
</p>
<p>imaging, and on into the theory of all the powerful analytic modes and associated
</p>
<p>detectors, such as X-rays, cathodoluminescence and energy-loss spectroscopy, we
</p>
<p>have seen steady advances. And we have always known that defect structure in most
</p>
<p>cases controls properties &mdash; the most common (first-order) phase transitions are
</p>
<p>initiated at special sites, and in the electronic oxides a whole zoo of charge-density
</p>
<p>excitations and defects waits to be fully understood by electron microscopy. The
</p>
<p>theory of phase-transformation toughening of ceramics, for example, is a wonderful
</p>
<p>story which combines TEM observations with theory, as does that of precipitate
</p>
<p>hardening in alloys, or the early stages of semiconductor-crystal growth. The study
</p>
<p>of diffuse scattering from defects as a function of temperature at phase transitions is in
</p>
<p>its infancy, yet we have a far stronger signal there than in competing X-ray methods.
</p>
<p>The mapping of strain-fields at the nanoscale in devices, by quantitative convergent-
</p>
<p>beam electron diffraction, was developed just in time to solve a problem listed on the
</p>
<p>Semiconductor Roadmap (the speed of your laptop depends on strain-induced mobil-
</p>
<p>ity enhancement). In biology, where the quantification of TEM data is taken more
</p>
<p>seriously, we have seen three-dimensional image reconstructions of many large pro-
</p>
<p>teins, including the ribosome (the factory which makes proteins according to DNA
</p>
<p>instructions). Their work should be a model to the materials science community in the
</p>
<p>constant effort toward better quantification of data.
</p>
<p>Like all the best textbooks, this one was distilled from lecture notes, debugged over
</p>
<p>many years and generations of students. The authors have extracted the heart from

<p>Acknowledgments
</p>
<p>We have spent over 20 years conceiving and writing this text and the preceding first
</p>
<p>edition and such an endeavor can&rsquo;t be accomplished in isolation. Our first acknowl-
</p>
<p>edgment must be to our respective wives and children: Margie, Matthew, Bryn, and
</p>
<p>Stephen and Bryony, Ben, Adam, and Emily. Our families have borne the brunt of our
</p>
<p>absences from home (and occasionally the brunt of our presence). Neither edition
</p>
<p>would have been possible without the encouragement, advice, and persistence of (and
</p>
<p>the fine wines served by) Amelia McNamara, our first editor at Plenum Press, then
</p>
<p>Kluwer, and Springer.
</p>
<p>We have both been fortunate to work in our respective universities with many
</p>
<p>more talented colleagues, post-doctoral associates, and graduate students, all of
</p>
<p>whom have taught us much and contributed significantly to the examples in both
</p>
<p>editions. We would like to thank a few of these colleagues directly: Dave Ackland,
</p>
<p>Faisal Alamgir, Arzu Altay, Ian Anderson, Ilke Arslan, Joysurya Basu, Steve Bau-
</p>

</p>
<p>In addition, many other colleagues and friends in the field of microscopy and
</p>
<p>analysis have helped with the book (even if they weren&rsquo;t aware of it). These include
</p>
<p>Ron Anderson, Raghavan Ayer, Jim Bentley, Gracie Burke, Jeff Campbell, Graham
</p>
<p>Cliff, David Cockayne, Peter Doig, the late Chuck Fiori, Peter Goodhew, Brendan
</p>

</p>
<p>imer, Harald Müllejans, Dale Newbury, Mike O&rsquo;Keefe, Peter Rez, Manfred Rühle,
</p>
<p>John-Henry Scott, John Steeds, Peter Swann, Gareth Thomas, Patrick Veyssière,
</p>
<p>Peter Williams, Nestor Zaluzec, and Elmar Zeitler. Many of these (and other) collea-
</p>
<p>gues provided the figures that we acknowledge individually at the end of the book.
</p>
<p>We have received financial support for our microscopy studies through several
</p>
<p>different federal agencies; without this support none of the research that underpins the
</p>
<p>contents of this book would have been accomplished. In particular, DBW wishes to
</p>
<p>thank the National Science Foundation, Division of Materials Research for over 30
</p>
<p>years of continuous funding, NASA, Division of Planetary Science (with Joe Gold-
</p>
<p>stein) and The Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences (with Mike Notis and
</p>
<p>Himanshu Jain), Bettis Laboratories, Pittsburgh, and Sandia National Laboratories,
</p>
<p>Albuquerque. While this edition was finalized at the University of Alabama in
</p>
<p>Huntsville, both editions were written while DBW was in the Center for Advanced
</p>
<p>Materials and Nanotechnology at Lehigh University, which supports that outstand-
</p>
<p>ing electron microscopy laboratory. Portions of both editions were written while
</p>
<p>DBW was on sabbatical or during extended visits to various microscopy labs: Chal-
</p>
<p>mers University, Göteborg, with GordonDunlop andHans Nordén; TheMax Planck

</p>
<p>Laboratory with Terry Mitchell; Dartmouth College, Thayer School of Engineering,

<p>with Erland Schulson; and the Electron Microscope Unit at Sydney University with
</p>
<p>Simon Ringer. CBC wishes to acknowledge the Department of Energy, Basic Energy
</p>
<p>Sciences, the National Science Foundation, Division of Materials Research, the
</p>
<p>Center for Interfacial Engineering at the University of Minnesota, The Materials
</p>
<p>Science Center at Cornell University, and the SHaRE program at OakRidgeNational
</p>
<p>Laboratories. The first edition was started while CBC was with the Department of
</p>
<p>Materials Science and Engineering at Cornell University. This edition was started at
</p>
<p>the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of
</p>
<p>Minnesota where the first edition was finished and was finalized while CBC was at the
</p>
<p>University of Connecticut. The second edition was partly written while CBC was on
</p>
<p>Sabbatical Leave at Chalmers University with Eva Olssen (thanks also to Anders
</p>
<p>Tholen at Chalmers), at NIMS in Tsukuba with Yoshio Bando (thanks also to Dmitri
</p>
<p>Golberg and Kazuo Furuya at NIMS at Yuichi Ikuhara at the University of Tokyo)
</p>
<p>and at Cambridge University with Paul Midgley. CBC also thanks the Master and
</p>
<p>Fellows of Peterhouse for their hospitality during the latter period.
</p>
<p>CBC would also like to thank the team at the Ernst Ruska Center for their
</p>
<p>repeated generous hospitality (special thanks to Knut Urban, Markus Lenzen,
</p>
<p>Andreas Thust, Martina Luysberg, Karsten Tillmann, Chunlin Jia and Lothar
</p>
<p>Houben)
</p>
<p>Despite our common scientific beginnings as undergraduates in Christ&rsquo;s College
</p>
<p>Cambridge, we learned our trade under different microscopists: DBW with Jeff
</p>
<p>Edington in Cambridge and CBC with Sir Peter Hirsch and Mike Whelan in Oxford.
</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the classic texts by these renowned microscopists are referred to
</p>
<p>throughout this book. They influenced our own views of TEM tremendously, con-
</p>
<p>tributing to the undoubted bias in our opinions, notation, and approach to the whole
</p>
<p>subject.

<p>List of Initials and Acronyms
</p>
<p>The field of TEM is a rich source of initials and acronyms (these are words formed by the initials), behind which we hide
both simple and esoteric concepts.While the generation of new initials and acronyms can be a source of original thinking
(e.g., see ALCHEMl), it undoubtedly makes for easier communication in many cases and certainly reduces the length of
voluminous textbooks. You have to master this strange language before being accepted into the community of micro-
scopists, so we present a comprehensive listing that you should memorize.

<p>About the Companion Volume
</p>
<p>As described in our Preface, the many years since the publication of the first
edition have seen a significant increase in the number of TEM (and related)
techniques and the sophistication of the microscope&rsquo;s experimental capabilities,
as well as new hardware designs, astonishing improvements in computer control of
the instrument and amazing developments in software to handle and model the
gigabytes of data generated by these (now almost completely digital) instruments.
Much of this explosion of information has coincided with the world-wide drive to
explore the nanoworld, and the still-ongoing effects of Moore&rsquo;s law. It is not
possible to include all of this new knowledge in a textbook, and the primary
objective of the second edition is still to teach you to understand the essence of
the TEM before you attempt to master the latest advances. We also personally
cannot hope to comprehend fully all of the new techniques, especially as we both
descend into more administrative positions in our professional lives.
</p>
<p>Therefore, we have prevailed on almost 20 of our close friends and colleagues
to put together with us a companion applications text (Carter and Williams, eds.,
Springer, 2010) to which we will refer throughout this second edition. The com-
panion text is just as it says; it&rsquo;s a friend whose advice you should seek when the
main text is not enough. The companion is not intended to be more advanced but
it certainly provides much more detail on key recent developments and somemore
traditional aspects of TEM that have seen a resurgence of interest. We have taken
our colleagues&rsquo; contributions and worked with them to produce chapters that are
in a similar conversational vein to this main text. While Transmission Electron
Microscopy, Second Edition, is a completely stand-alone textbook, we think that
you will find the cross-referencing between the two texts to be of great value as you
continue along the rewarding path of becoming a transmission microscopist.

<p>TEM is a visual science, and any TEM text is heavily dependent on figures, halftones, and (more recently) full color
images to transmit its message. We have been fortunate to work with many colleagues over the years who have
generously given us fine examples of the art and science of TEM; we would like to acknowledge them here. We have
also used our own work, and the work of others, whose permission has been sought as listed below.

<p>The Transmission Electron Microscope
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>A typical commercial transmission electronmicroscope (TEM) costs about $5 for each electron
volt (eV) of energy in the beam and, if you add on all available options, it can easily cost up to
$10 per eV. As you&rsquo;ll see, we use beam energies in the range from 100,000 to 400,000 eV, so a
TEM is an extremely expensive piece of equipment. Consequently, there have to be very sound
scientific reasons for investing such a large amount of money in onemicroscope. In this chapter
(which is just a brief overview ofmany of the concepts that we&rsquo;ll talk about in detail throughout
the book) we start by introducing you to some of the historical development of the TEM
because the history is intertwined with some of the reasons why you need to use a TEM to
characterize materials. Other reasons for using a TEM have appeared as the instrument
continues to develop, to the point where it can seriously be claimed that no other scientific
instrument exists which can offer such a broad range of characterization techniques with such
high spatial and analytical resolution, coupled with a completely quantitative understanding of
the various techniques. Indeed as nanotechnology and related areas seize both the public and
the technological community&rsquo;s imaginations, it is increasingly obvious that the TEM is the
central tool for complete characterization of nanoscale materials and devices. Unfortunately,
coupledwith the TEM&rsquo;s advantages are some serious drawbacks and youmust be just as aware
of the instrument&rsquo;s limitations as you are of its advantages, so we summarize these also.
</p>
<p>A TEM can appear in several different forms, all of which are described by different
acronyms such as HRTEM, STEM, and AEM, and we&rsquo;ll introduce you to these different
instruments. We&rsquo;ll also use the same acronyms or initials (go back and read p. xxi) to denote
both the technique (microscopy) and the instrument (microscope). We regard all of the
different types of TEM as simply variations on a basic theme and that is why only &lsquo;TEM&rsquo; is
in the book title. We will also describe some of the basic physical characteristics of the
electron. Throughout the book you&rsquo;ll have to confront some physics andmathematics every
now and again because understanding what we can do with a TEM and why we operate it in
certain ways is governed by the fundamental physics of electrons, how electrons are con-
trolled by magnetic fields in the microscope, how electrons interact with materials, and how
we detect the many signals emitted from a specimen in the TEM.
</p>
<p>Finally we will summarize some of the most popular computer software packages for
TEM.We will refer to many of these throughout the text. We are including them in the first
chapter to emphasize the central role of the computer in today&rsquo;s TEM operation and
analysis. A basic lesson to take away from this chapter is not just the versatility of the
TEM but the fact that it is fundamentally a signal-generating and detecting instrument
rather than simply a microscope for high-resolution images and diffraction patterns (we&rsquo;ll
call them DPs), which is how it operated for many decades.

<p>1.1 WHAT MATERIALS SHOULD WE
STUDY IN THE TEM?
</p>
<p>The materials scientist has traditionally examined
metals, alloys, ceramics, glasses, polymers, semiconduc-
tors, and composite mixtures of these materials, with
</p>
<p>sporadic adventures into wood, textiles, and concrete.
In addition to thinning them from the bulk state, parti-
cles and fibers of some of these materials are also com-
monly studied and, in such shapes, they are sometimes
thin enough for direct TEMexamination. Nanotechnol-
ogy, which will feature as a common theme throughout

<p>this book, is defined as &lsquo;&lsquo;the ability to understand and
control matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nan-
ometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applica-
tions. Encompassing nanoscale science, engineering and
technology, nanotechnology involves imaging, measur-
ing, modeling, and manipulating matter at this length
scale&rsquo;&rsquo; (URL #1).
</p>
<p>THE CRUCIAL WORDS
&lsquo;&lsquo;Imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating
matter&rsquo;&rsquo; can be accomplished with the help of the
TEM and are often thrown together as part of the
emerging field of &lsquo;nanocharacterization,&rsquo; a term
which we will try not to use too often.
</p>
<p>When we create nanoscale materials, they come with
specific dimensional limits in 1D, 2D, or 3Dand theTEM
iswell suited to observing them, precisely because of these
limits.Wewill include examples of archetypal dimension-
ally limited structures throughout thebook. For example,
single layers (such as graphene sheets or quantum wells),
nanotubes and nanowires, quantum dots, nanoparticles,
and most catalyst particles can be viewed as 1D struc-
tures. We can put all of these types of specimen into the
TEM without modification, since 1D is always thin
enough for direct observation; 2D nanomaterials include
interfaces, and complex 3Dnanomaterials are typified by
multilayer, semiconductor devices, functional materials,
or nanoporous structures such as substrates for catalyst-
particle dispersions. Lastly, we should note the rapidly
growing interface between the nano- and the bio-worlds.
While much of biological electron microscopy has been
superceded in the last decade or more by less-damaging
techniques such as confocal, two-photon, multi-photon,
and near-field lightmicroscopies, there is still amajor role
for TEM in biomaterials, bio/inorganic interfaces, and
nano-bio/biomaterials.
</p>
<p>1.2 WHY USE ELECTRONS?
</p>
<p>Why should we use an electronmicroscope? Historically
TEMs were developed because of the limited image
resolution in light microscopes, which is imposed by
the wavelength of visible light. Only after electron
microscopes were developed was it realized that there
are many other equally sound reasons for using elec-
trons, most of which are utilized to some extent in a
modern TEM. By way of introduction to the topic, let&rsquo;s
look at how the TEM developed and the pros and cons
of using such an instrument.
</p>
<p>1.2.A An Extremely Brief History
</p>
<p>Louis de Broglie (1925) first theorized that the electron
had wave-like characteristics, with a wavelength sub-
stantially less than visible light. Then in 1927 two
</p>
<p>research groups, Davisson and Germer and Thomson
and Reid, independently carried out their classic
electron-diffraction experiments, which demonstrated
the wave nature of electrons. It didn&rsquo;t take long for the
idea of an electron microscope to be proposed, and the
term was first used in the paper of Knoll and Ruska
(1932). In this paper they developed the idea of electron
lenses into a practical reality and demonstrated electron
images taken on the instrument shown in Figure 1.1.
This was a most crucial step, for which Ruska received
the Nobel Prize (&lsquo;&lsquo;somewhat late&rsquo;&rsquo; he was quoted as
saying), in 1986, shortly before his death in 1988.Within
a year of Knoll and Ruska&rsquo;s publication, the resolution
limit of the light microscope was surpassed. Ruska, sur-
prisingly, revealed that he hadn&rsquo;t heard of de Broglie&rsquo;s
ideas about electron waves and thought that the wave-
length limit didn&rsquo;t apply to electrons. Some idea of the
power of Ruska&rsquo;s breakthrough is the fact that commer-
cial TEMs were first developed only 4 years later. The
Metropolitan-Vickers EM1was the first such instrument
and was built in the UK in 1936. Apparently it didn&rsquo;t
work very well and regular production of commercial
TEMs was really started by Siemens and Halske in
Germany in 1939. TEMs became widely available from
several other sources (Hitachi, JEOL, Philips, and RCA,
inter alia) after the conclusion of World War II.
</p>
<p>For materials scientists a most important develop-
ment took place in the mid-1950s when Bollman in
Switzerland and Hirsch and co-workers in Cambridge,
in the UK, perfected techniques to thin metal foils to
electron transparency. (In fact, because so much of the
early TEM work examined metal specimens, the word
&lsquo;foil&rsquo; came to be synonymous with &lsquo;specimen&rsquo; and we&rsquo;ll
often use it this way.) In addition, the Cambridge group
also developed the theory of electron-diffraction con-
trast with which we can now identify, often in a quanti-
tative manner, all known line and planar crystal defects

<p>in TEM images. This work is summarized in a formid-
able but essential text often referred to as the &lsquo;Bible&rsquo; of
TEM (Hirsch et al. 1977). For the materials scientist,
practical applications of the TEM for the solution of
materials problems were pioneered in the United States
by Thomas and first clearly expounded in his text. Other
materials-oriented texts followed, notably the first stu-
dent-friendly &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; text by Edington.
</p>
<p>Today TEMs constitute arguably the most efficient
and versatile tools for the characterization of materials
over spatial ranges from the atomic scale, through the
ever-growing &lsquo;nano&rsquo; regime (from &lt; 1 nm to � 100 nm)
up to the micrometer level and beyond. If you want to
read a history of the TEM, the book byMarton (1968) is
a compact, personal monograph and the text edited by
Hawkes in 1985 contains a series of individual reminis-
cences. Fujita&rsquo;s (1986) paper emphasizes the substantial
contribution of Japanese scientists to the development
of the instrument. The field is now at the point where
many of the pioneers have put their memoirs down on
paper, or Festschrifts have been organized in their
honor (e.g., Cosslett 1979, Ruska 1980, Hashimoto
1986, Howie 2000, Thomas 2002, Zeitler 2003) which
detail their contributions over the decades, and compile
some useful overview papers of the field. If you enjoy
reading about the history of science, we strongly recom-
mend the review of Fifty Years of Electron Diffraction
edited by Goodman (1981) and Fifty Years of X-ray
Diffraction edited by Ewald (1962) (the spelling of X-
ray is discussed in the CBE Manual, 1994). More
recently, Haguenau et al. (2003) compiled an extensive
list of references describing key events in the history of
electron microscopy. As always, there is a wealth of
information, some of it accurate, available on the Web.
</p>
<p>1.2.B Microscopy and the Concept
of Resolution
</p>
<p>When asked &lsquo;&lsquo;what is a microscope?,&rsquo;&rsquo; most people
would answer that it is an instrument for magnifying
things too small to see with the naked eye, and most
likely they would be referring to the visible-light micro-
scope (VLM). Because of the general familiarity with
the concept of the VLM, wewill draw analogies between
electron and light microscopes wherever it&rsquo;s instructive.
</p>
<p>The smallest distance between two points that we
can resolve with our eyes is about 0.1&ndash;0.2 mm, depend-
ing on how good our eyes are, and assuming that there&rsquo;s
sufficient illumination by which to see. This distance is
the resolution or (more accurately) the resolving power of
our eyes. So any instrument that can show us pictures
(or images as we&rsquo;ll often refer to them) revealing detail
finer than 0.1 mm could be described as a microscope,
and its highest useful magnification is governed by its
resolution. A major attraction to the early developers of
the TEM was that, since electrons are smaller than
atoms, it should be possible, at least theoretically, to
</p>
<p>build a microscope that could &lsquo;see&rsquo; detail well below the
atomic level. The idea of being able to &lsquo;see&rsquo; with elec-
trons may be confusing to you. Our eyes are not sensi-
tive to electrons. If a beam of high-energy electrons was
aimed into your eye, youwouldmost likely be blinded as
the electrons killed your retinal cells, but you wouldn&rsquo;t
see anything (ever again!). So an integral part of any
electron microscope is a viewing screen of some form
(now usually a flat-panel computer display), which dis-
plays electron intensity as light intensity, which we first
observe and then record photographically or store digi-
tally. (We&rsquo;ll discuss these screens and other ways of
recording electron images in Chapter 7.)
</p>
<p>VLM
We&rsquo;ll try to avoid the phrases &lsquo;optical microscope&rsquo;
(they all are) and &lsquo;light microscope&rsquo; (some are very
heavy).
&lsquo;Visible-light microscope/y&rsquo; is simple and appropriate
use of the hyphen.
</p>
<p>The resolution of a TEM means different things for
different functions of the instrument, and we&rsquo;ll discuss
them in the appropriate chapters. It&rsquo;s easiest to think of
the image resolution in TEM in terms of the classic
Rayleigh criterion forVLM,which states that the smallest
distance that can be resolved, d, is given approximately by
</p>
<p>d &frac14;
0:61l
</p>
<p>m sin b
(1:1)
</p>
<p>In equation 1.1, l is the wavelength of the radiation, m
the refractive index of the viewing medium, and b the
semi-angle of collection of the magnifying lens. For the
sake of simplicity we can approximate m sin b (which is
sometimes called the numerical aperture) to unity and
so the resolution is equal to about half the wavelength of
light. For green light in the middle of the visible spec-
trum, l is about 550 nm, and so the resolution of a good
VLM is about 300 nm. In TEMs we can approximate
the best resolution using an expression similar to equa-
tion 1.1 (actually � 1.22l/b) which, as we&rsquo;ll see later, is
very small.
</p>
<p>Now although 300 nm is a small dimension to us, it
corresponds to about 1000 atom diameters, and, there-
fore, many of the features that control the properties of
materials are on a scale well below the resolution of the
VLM. Also, 300 nm is well above the upper limit of the
nano regime which we defined earlier. So there&rsquo;s a real
need in nano/materials science and engineering to image
details, all the way down to the atomic level, if we want to
understandandultimately control the properties ofmate-
rials, and that&rsquo;s a major reason why TEMs are so useful.
</p>
<p>This limit of lightmicroscopy was well understood at
the turn of the last century and prompted Ernst Abbe,
one of the giants in the field, to complain that &lsquo;&lsquo;it is poor
comfort to hope that human ingenuity will find ways
</p>
<p>1.2 WHY U SE ELECTRONS ? ........................................................................................................................................................................ 5</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>andmeans of overcoming this limit.&rsquo;&rsquo; (He was right to be
so depressed because he died in 1905, some 20 years
before de Broglie&rsquo;s ingenuity solved the problem.)
Louis de Broglie&rsquo;s famous equation shows that the
wavelength of electrons is related to their energy, E,
and, if we ignore relativistic effects, we can show
approximately (and exactly in Section 1.4 below) that
(ignoring the inconsistency in units)
</p>
<p>l &frac14;
1:22
</p>
<p>E1=2
(1:2)
</p>
<p>In this equation E is in electron volts (eV) and l in nm.
So from equation 1.2 you can work out that for a
</p>
<p>100 keV electron, l � 4 pm (0.004 nm), which is much
smaller than the diameter of an atom.
</p>
<p>V AND eV
Remember that we should be precise in our use of
these units: V represents the accelerating voltage of
the microscope while eV refers to the energy of the
electrons in the microscope (look ahead to equation
1.4 to see the relation between the two).
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see later that we cannot yet build a &lsquo;perfect&rsquo;
TEM that approaches this wavelength-limited limit of
resolution, because we can&rsquo;t make perfect electron
lenses (see Chapter 6). Until recently, a top of the line
lens could rightly be compared to using the bottom of a
Coca-ColaTM bottle as a lens for light microscopy. Pro-
gress was rapid after Ruska&rsquo;s early work on lenses and
since the mid-1970s many commercial TEMs have been
capable of resolving individual columns of atoms in
crystals, creating the field of high-resolution transmis-
sion electron microscopy or HRTEM, which we&rsquo;ll dis-
cuss in Chapter 28. A typical HRTEM image is shown
in Figure 1.2A.
</p>
<p>The advantages of shorter wavelengths led in the
1960s to the development of high-voltage electronmicro-
scopes (HVEMs), with accelerating potentials between 1
and 3MV. In fact, rather than push the resolution limits,
most of these instruments were used to introduce con-
trolled amounts of radiation damage into specimens, in
an attempt to simulate nuclear-reactor environments.
Three-Mile Island and Chernobyl contributed to
changes in the emphasis of energy research; recently
there has not beenmuch call for HVEMs. Today, climate
change is forcing a reconsideration of nuclear power.
Only one HVEM (1 MV) for HRTEM imaging was
constructed in the 1980s and three 1.25MV machines
in the 1990s. Intermediate voltage electron microscopes
(IVEMs) were introduced in the 1980s. These TEMs
operate at 200&ndash;400 kV, but still offer very high resolu-
tion, close to that achieved at 1 MV. In fact, progress is
such that most IVEMs purchased these days are, effec-
tively, HRTEMs with atomic resolution.
</p>
<p>We are still improving the resolution, and recent
breakthroughs in spherical- and chromatic-aberration
corrections (see Chapters 6 and 37, respectively) are
revolutionizing the TEM field. Among many advan-
tages, corrections of spherical aberration (which, for
reasons we&rsquo;ll explain in Chapter 6, we abbreviate to
Cs) and chromatic aberration (Cc) allow us to produce
sharper atomic-resolution images. By filtering out elec-
trons of different wavelengths we can also better image
thicker specimens.
</p>
<p>The combination of IVEMs and Cs correction has
pushed TEM image resolution to well below the 0.1 nm
(1 Å) barrier. Today the point has perhaps been reached
where the drive for much better resolution is now no
longer paramount and the TEM will develop more con-
structively in other ways. As we&rsquo;ll illustrate many times
throughout the book and elaborate in the companion
text, Cs correction is perhaps the most exciting advance
in TEM technology in several decades and Figure 1.2B
and C shows beautifully the difference in a typical
atomic-resolution image with and without Cs correction.

</p>
<p>1.2.C Interaction of Electrons with Matter
</p>
<p>Electrons are one type of ionizing radiation, which is the
general term given to radiation that is capable of remov-
ing the tightly bound, inner-shell electrons from the
attractive field of the nucleus by transferring some of
its energy to individual atoms in the specimen.
</p>
<p>One of the advantages of using ionizing radiation is
that it produces a wide range of secondary signals from
the specimen and some of these are summarized in Fig-
ure 1.3. Many of these signals are used in analytical
electron microscopy (AEM), giving us chemical infor-
mation and a lot of other details about our specimens.
AEM uses X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry
(XEDS) and electron energy-loss spectrometry (EELS).
For example, Figure 1.4A shows X-ray spectra from
very small regions of the TEM specimen imaged in
Figure 1.4B. The spectra exhibit characteristic peaks,
which identify the different elements present in different
regions.We can transform such spectra into quantitative
</p>
<p>images of the distributions of all the elements present in
the specimen (Figure 1.4C) and from such images extract
quantitative data describing elemental changes asso-
ciated with inhomogeneous microstructures as shown
in Figure 1.4D. This and similar analyses with EELS
comprise Part 4 of the book. In contrast, microscopes
using non-ionizing radiation, such as visible light,
usually only generate light (but not much heat, which is
good).
</p>

</p>

</p>

<p>interacts with a thin specimen. Most of these signals can be detected

<p>in different types of TEM. The directions shown for each signal do not
</p>
<p>always represent the physical direction of the signal, but indicate, in a
</p>
<p>relative manner, where the signal is strongest or where it is detected.
</p>
<p>CS,CC AND MAGNIFICATION
Having extolled the virtues ofCs correction it is worth
pointing out that most TEM images are recorded at
magnifications where such correction makes no dis-
cernible difference.Most TEM specimens are not thin
enough to produce images with resolution that bene-
fits from Cs correction. For thicker specimens Cc
correction via energy filtering is much more useful.
</p>
<p>1.2 WHY U SE ELECTRONS ? ........................................................................................................................................................................ 7</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In order to get the best signal out of our specimens
we have to put the best signal in, and so the electron
source is critical. We are now very accomplished in this
respect, as you&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 5; modern TEMs are
very good signal-generating instruments. To localize
these signals we need our TEM to produce a very
small electron beam (or probe as it is often called),
typically &lt;5 nm and at best &lt; 0.1 nm in diameter. We
combine TEM and scanning electron microscope
(SEM) technology to create a scanning transmission
electron microscope (STEM). The STEM is both the
basis for AEMs and a unique scanning-imaging (or
scanned-probe) microscope in its own right. In fact
there are instruments that are only capable of operating
in scanning mode and these are sometimes referred to as
dedicated STEMs or DSTEMs. AEMs offer improved
analytical performance at intermediate voltages, similar
to the improvement in image resolution gained in stan-
dard TEMs.
</p>
<p>Most importantly, Cs correction permits the genera-
tion of smaller electron probes with higher currents,
thus significantly improving both analytical spatial
resolution and sensitivity. Chromatic-aberration cor-
rection (i.e., energy filtering) also offers the opportunity
to form images of electrons with a whole range of spe-
cific energies, permitting such breakthroughs as band-
gap imaging and chemical-bond imaging.
</p>
<p>1.2.D Depth of Field and Depth of Focus
</p>
<p>The depth of field of a microscope is a measure of how
much of the object that we are looking at remains in
focus at the same time; the term depth of focus refers to
the distance over which the image can move relative to
the object and still remain in focus. If you are confused,
it may help to recall that depth of field and field of view
both refer to the object in everyday photography. The
lenses in the TEM govern these properties just as they
determine the resolution. Electron lenses are not very
good, as we&rsquo;ve already mentioned, and one way to
improve their performance is to insert very small limit-
ing apertures, narrowing the beam down to a thin &lsquo;pen-
cil&rsquo; of electrons which at most is a few micrometers
across. These apertures obviously cut down the intensity
of the electron beam, but they also act to increase
the depth of field of the specimen and depth of focus
of the images that we produce, as we explain in detail in
Chapter 6.
</p>
<p>While this large depth of field is chiefly used in the
SEM to produce 3D-like images of the surfaces of
specimens with large changes in topography, it is also
critical in the TEM. It turns out that in the TEM, your
specimen is usually in focus from the top to the bottom
surfaces at the same time, independent of its topogra-
phy, so long as it&rsquo;s electron transparent! Figure 1.5
shows a TEM image of some dislocations in a crystal.
</p>
<p>The dislocations appear to start and finish in the speci-
men, but in fact they are threading their way through
the specimen from the top to the bottom surfaces, and
they remain in sharp focus at all times. (By the time you
finish reading this book, you should be able to work
out which is the top and which is the bottom surface of
the specimen.) Furthermore, you can record the final
image at different positions below the final lens of the
instrument and it will still be in focus (although the
magnification will change). Compare these properties
with the VLMwhere, as you probably know, unless the
surface of your specimen is flat within the wavelength
of light, it is not all in focus at the same time. This
aspect of TEM gives us both advantages and disadvan-
tages in comparison to the VLM. You should note
that, in this rare situation, Cs correction is not an
advantage since it permits the use of larger apertures
without degrading the resolution of the lens. But smal-
ler apertures are the ones that give better depth of focus
and depth of field (see Section 6.7). However, if you are
using a Cs corrector, your specimen has to be so thin
that it will still remain in focus except under extreme
conditions. We&rsquo;ll see more on this topic in the compan-
ion text and also mention using TEM in a &lsquo;confocal&rsquo;
mode.
</p>
<p>1.2.E Diffraction
</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted, Thompson, Reid, Davisson, and
Germer independently showed that electrons could be
diffracted when passing through thin crystals of nickel.
Performing electron diffraction in TEMs was first rea-
lized by Kossel andMöllenstedt (1939). Today, electron
diffraction is an indispensable part of TEM and is argu-
ably the most useful aspect for materials scientists and
nanotechnologists for whom crystal structure (and par-
ticularly crystal defects) is an essential characteristic
when it comes to controlling properties. Figure 1.6
</p>

</p>
<p>dislocations in the band across the middle of the image are on slip planes

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>shows a TEM DP that contains information on the
crystal structure, lattice repeat distance, and specimen
shape (as well as being amost striking pattern).We&rsquo;ll see
that the pattern can always be related to the image of the
area of the specimen from which it came, in this case
shown in the inset. You will also see in Part 2 that, in
addition to the things we just listed, if you converge the
usually parallel TEMbeam to a focused probe, then you
can produce even more striking convergent-beam pat-
terns (see Figure 2.13D) from which you can conduct a
complete crystal-symmetry analysis of minuscule crys-
tals, including such esoteric aspects as point-group and
space-group determination. You shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
by now if we tell you that aberration correction can
produce even better DPs, which are both sharper (by
reducing chromatic aberration) and come from smaller
regions of the specimen (by reducing Cs). The crystal
structure produces no diffraction information in a VLM
because of the relatively large wavelength of visible
light.
</p>
<p>So a TEM can produce atomic-resolution images, it
can generate a variety of signals telling you about your
specimen chemistry and crystallography, and you can
always produce images that are in focus. There are
</p>
<p>many other good reasons why you should use electron
microscopes. We hope they will become evident as you
read through this book. At the same time there aremany
reasons why you should not always seek to solve your
problems with the TEM, and it is most important that
you realize what the instrument cannot do, as well as
knowing its capabilities.
</p>
<p>1.3 LIMITATIONS OF THE TEM
</p>
<p>1.3.A Sampling
</p>
<p>All the above advantages of the TEM bring accom-
panying drawbacks. First of all, the price to pay for
any high-resolution imaging technique is that you only
look at a small part of your specimen at any one time.
The higher the resolution therefore, the worse the
sampling abilities of the instrument. Von Heimendahl
(1980) reported a calculation by Swann around 1970
estimating that all TEMs, since they first became
available commercially (�15 years), had only exam-
ined 0.3 mm3 of material! Extending that calculation
to the present time probably increases this volume to
no more than 103 mm3. So we have an instrument that
is not a good sampling tool! This sampling problem
only serves to emphasize that, if you&rsquo;re just starting
your research, before you put your specimen in the
TEM you must have examined it with techniques that
offer poorer resolution but better sampling, such as
your eyes, the VLM, and the SEM. In other words,
know the forest before you start looking at the veins in
the leaves on the trees.
</p>
<p>1.3.B Interpreting Transmission Images
</p>
<p>Another problem is that the TEM presents us with 2D
images of 3D specimens, viewed in transmission. Our
eyes and brain routinely understand reflected light
images but are ill-equipped to interpret TEM images
and so we must be cautious. Hayes illustrates this pro-
blem well by showing a picture of two rhinoceros side by
side such that the head of one appears attached to the
rear of the other (see Figure 1.7). As Hayes puts it &lsquo;&lsquo;when
we see this image we laugh&rsquo;&rsquo; (because we understand its
true nature in 3D) &lsquo;&lsquo;but when we see equivalent (but
more misleading) images in the TEM, we publish!&rsquo;&rsquo; So
beware of artifacts which abound in TEM images.
</p>
<p>One aspect of this particular drawback (sometimes
called the projection-limitation) is that generally all the
TEM information that we talk about in this book
(images, DPs, spectra) is averaged through the thickness
of the specimen. In other words, a single TEM image has
no depth sensitivity. As we noted in Figure 1.5 there
often is information about the top and bottom surfaces
of the thin foil, but this is not immediately apparent. So
</p>
<p>FIGURE 1.6. TEM DP from a thin foil of Al-Li-Cu containing various
</p>
<p>precipitate phases, shown in the inset image. The central spot (X) contains
</p>
<p>electrons that come directly through the foil and the other spots and lines
</p>
<p>are diffracted electrons which are scattered from the different crystal
</p>
<p>planes.
</p>
<p>KEY POINT TO REMEMBER
At all times the crystallographic information in the
DP (and all the analytical information) can be related
to the image of your specimen.

<p>other techniques which are more clearly surface sensi-
tive or depth sensitive, such as field-ion microscopy,
scanning-probe microscopy, Auger spectroscopy, and
Rutherford backscattering, are necessary complemen-
tary techniques if you want a full characterization of
your specimen.
</p>
<p>However, there has been progress in overcoming
this limitation, which was much more of a problem for
biologists interested in the shape of complex mole-
cules, cells, and other natural structures. So they
invented the technique of electron tomography,
which uses a sequence of images taken at different
tilts to create a 3D image, identical in principle to
the more familiar medical CAT (computerized-axial
tomography) scans using X-rays. Recently, there has
been rapid improvement in specimen-holder design to
permit full 3608 rotation and, in combination with
easy data storage and manipulation, nanotechnolo-
gists have begun to use this technique to look at com-
plex 3D inorganic structures such as porous materials
containing catalyst particles. This relatively new
aspect of TEM for materials scientists is explored in
depth in the companion text.
</p>
<p>1.3.C Electron Beam Damage and Safety
</p>
<p>A detrimental effect of ionizing radiation is that it can
damage your specimen, particularly polymers (andmost
organics) or certain minerals and ceramics. Some
aspects of beam damage are exacerbated at higher vol-
tages, and with commercial instruments offering up to
400 kV, beam damage can now limit much of what we
do in the TEM, even with refractory metals. The situa-
tion is even worse with more intense beams made
</p>
<p>possible because of advances inCs correction. Figure 1.8
shows an area of a specimen damaged by high-energy
electrons.
</p>
<p>However, all is not lost and we can combine more
intense electron sources with more sensitive electron
detectors and use computer enhancement of noisy
images to minimize the total dose received by the
specimen to levels below the damage threshold. Mini-
mum-dose microscopy techniques, often combined
with specimen cooling (cryo-microscopy) and low-
noise, charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras (see
Chapters 7 and 31, respectively), are standard
approaches in biological TEM and permit images to
be obtained even when only a few hundred electrons/
nm2 are hitting the specimen. These approaches are
finding increasing usage in TEM of materials where
digital control of the beam in STEMs is another way
to minimize radiation damage.
</p>
<p>The combination of high kV beams with the intense
electron sources that are available means that you can
destroy almost any specimen, if you are not careful. At
the same time comes the danger that should never be
forgotten, that of exposing yourself to ionizing radiation.
Modern TEMs are remarkably well engineered and
designed with safety as a primary concern, but never
forget that you are dealing with a potentially dangerous
instrument that generates radiation levels that will kill
tissue (and managed to damage some operators in the
early days of the technique). So nevermodify yourmicro-
scope in any way without consulting the manufacturer
and without carrying out routine radiation-leak tests. If
in doubt, don&rsquo;t do it!

<p>1.3.D Specimen Preparation
</p>
<p>Your specimens have to be thin if you&rsquo;re going to get
any information using transmitted electrons in the
TEM. &lsquo;Thin&rsquo; is a relative term, but in this context it
means electron transparent. For a specimen to be trans-
parent to electrons, it must be thin enough to transmit
sufficient electrons such that enough intensity falls on the
screen, CCD, or photographic plate to give an interpre-
table image in a reasonable time. Generally this require-
ment is a function of the electron energy and the average
atomic number (Z) of your specimen. Typically for
100-keV electrons, specimens of aluminum alloys up to
�1 mm would be thin, while steel would be thin up to
about several hundred nanometers. However, it is an
axiom in TEM that, almost invariably, thinner is better
and specimens &lt;100 nm should be used wherever possi-
ble. In extreme cases such as doing HRTEM or electron
spectrometry, specimen thicknesses &lt;50 nm (even
&lt;10 nm) are essential. These demands become less strict
as the beam voltage increases, but this is offset by the
production of beam damage.
</p>
<p>Again these words of caution are balanced by the
development of a specialized specimen-preparation
tool called a focused ion beam (FIB) which is essential
to the semiconductor-device fabricators who use
them (by the dozen) to prepare, in a matter of a few
tens of minutes, thin foils of specific, individual gates
or junctions from one of the many millions of such on
a 12-in. VLSI wafer. The only drawback is that, to
buy a FIB, you have to pay as much as it costs to buy
a TEM. We&rsquo;ll talk about this and other methods of
specimen preparation in Chapter 10 and in the com-
panion text.
</p>
<p>A terminological distinction is worth noting here. The
words sample and specimen are often used interchange-
ably but, in this text, we&rsquo;ll distinguish the specimen spe-
cifically as the thin piece of material that you insert into
the TEM in a specimen holder and we&rsquo;ll assume that the
specimenwas thinned from amuch larger, bulk sample of
the material you are interested in studying. Sometimes
we&rsquo;ll mix the terms to test your understanding.
</p>
<p>So it should be obvious to you by now that while
TEM and associated techniques are tremendously
</p>
<p>powerful characterization tools when used properly,
they should never be used in isolation to solve a materi-
als problem. You must understand your material at low
magnification with your eyes and with VLM and SEM
before venturing into TEM studies. Otherwise you may
fall-foul of some of the limitations we have just listed.
But you should also have got the message that we are
constantly improving the technique and overcoming
these limitations while, at the same time, making the
positive aspects even better.
</p>
<p>1.4 DIFFERENT KINDS OF TEMs
</p>
<p>As you read through the previous sections you will have
seen that TEMs come in a wide variety of types:
HRTEMs, HVEMs, IVEMs, STEMs, and AEMs.
Complete books have been written on each of these
instruments, but it is our philosophy that all these are
simply different forms of the basic TEM. So in this book
we intend to treat them as such. Indeed a current 200 or
300 keV TEM can combine aspects of all the above
microscope types. Figure 1.9 shows several of the dif-
ferent kinds of TEMs we have mentioned. It is instruc-
tive to consider some of the features of the instruments
shown here. AnHVEMusually requires a two- or three-
story room; the operator shows the scale of this
instrument. A modern machine essentially is an elec-
tron-optical column in which we can maintain a good
vacuum but the lenses and most other functions can be
controlled by one or more computers. Note that the
DSTEM only has a flat-panel display: there is no (inter-
nal) viewing screen. This aspect is becoming a more
popular design feature in TEMs because, if the screen
is not in the microscope, then the operator doesn&rsquo;t have
to be in the room or in the building or even in the same
country. Removing the operator from proximity to the
TEM overcomes many of the factors that limit the
performance of the best instruments. Remote operation
(or telepresence) is an increasingly attractive feature,
which will give many more researchers access to the
most sophisticated TEMs, as already happens in the
world of astronomy with major telescopes.
</p>
<p>1.5 SOME FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES
OF ELECTRONS
</p>
<p>Many times in the bookwe&rsquo;ll have to refer to some of the
basic properties of electrons. You know that electrons
show both particle and wave characteristics, illustrating
one of the great puzzles of quantum physics that we all
seem to accept without too much trouble. In fact the
TEM routinely demonstrates both the particle and wave
characteristics of the electron, repeating the electron
analog of GI Taylor&rsquo;s famous experiment in which he
</p>
<p>THIN SPECIMENS
A major limitation of the TEM is we need thin speci-
mens. Methods to prepare thin specimens exist for
almost all materials, and we talk about them in
Chapter 10. But as a general rule, the thinning pro-
cesses that we use do affect the specimens, changing
both their structure and chemistry. So you need to be
aware of the drawbacks of specimen preparation and
learn to recognize the artifacts introduced by stan-
dard preparation methods.

<p>demonstratedYoung&rsquo;s slits interference patterns despite
using such a weak light source that only one photon
passed through either slit at any one time. The electron
beam current in a TEM can be as high as � 0.1&ndash;1 mA,
which corresponds to about 1012 electrons passing
through the specimen plane. But, as we&rsquo;ll see below,
with 100 keV energy, these electrons travel at about
0.5c (actually �1.6 � 108 m/s), so they are separated
by �1.6 mm and this means that there is never more
than one electron in the specimen at any one time.
Nevertheless, electron diffraction and interference
occur, both of which are wave phenomena, and
</p>
<p>require interaction between different electron waves.
Despite this dilemma, we know a lot about the elec-
tron and its behavior, and some of the basic charac-
teristics are summarized in Table 1.1, along with
some relevant physical constants.
</p>
<p>There are a few important equations that you should
know. First of all, based on de Broglie&rsquo;s ideas of the
wave-particle duality, we can relate the particle momen-
tum p to its wavelength l through Planck&rsquo;s constant, thus

<p>In the TEM we impart momentum to the electron by
accelerating it through a potential drop, V, giving it a

</p>
<p>If you look back, this equation is equivalent to equation
1.2. The inverse relationship between l andV introduces a
very important concept: by increasing the accelerating vol-
tage we decrease the wavelength of the electrons. So you,
the operator, can do this whenever you wish!
</p>
<p>Equations 1.2 and 1.6 are useful expressions for
deducing ballpark estimates, but be careful to note the
differences. We can use equation 1.6 to calculate the
non-relativistic electron wavelength for typical commer-
cial TEM operating voltages as listed in Table 1.2.
</p>
<p>The simple treatment we just went through neglects
relativistic effects and, unfortunately for electron
microscopists, relativistic effects cannot be ignored at
energies &gt; �100 keV because the velocity of the elec-
trons (as particles) becomes greater than half the
speed of light! So to be exact we must modify equation
1.6 to give

</p>
<p>A full listing for many more voltages can easily be
generated by putting equations 1.6 and 1.7 into a
spreadsheet. The effect of relativity is greater for higher
accelerating voltages as shown in Table 1.2 which com-
prises all the commercial TEM accelerating voltages.
</p>
<p>There will bemany times when it&rsquo;s useful to refer back
to these numbers, especially when we consider the resolu-
tion of the microscope and when we need to make calcu-
lations about the way electrons interact with matter.
</p>
<p>Aword about units: as we noted above, we should all
be using SI units. We don&rsquo;t for two reasons: first, some
special units are ideal for the purpose at hand; secondwe
forget to include special conversion factors in some
formulas. The difference between, e.g., the Gaussian
system of units and SI units is summarized in the invalu-
able reference by Fischbeck and Fischbeck (1987) or in
the electronic version of the almost 100-year-old stan-
dard source, Kaye and Laby (1986) (URL#2), or on the
NIST database from which you can quickly find any
number or constant that you need (URL #3).

<p>1.6 MICROSCOPY ON THE INTERNET/
WORLD WIDE WEB
</p>
<p>TEM users are well integrated into the Internet and the
World Wide Web (WWW) and this is a source of useful
information (and also some useful knowledge!) about
what&rsquo;s going on in the field. You can view research
TEMs in real time over the Internet and, as we&rsquo;ve seen,
you may not only see other instruments but you may be
able to operate them remotely (a quick search on tele-
microscopy or telepresence microscopy will get you
some useful hits). So rather than spend a week in
sunny Storrs operating an advanced TEM you can
(regretfully) do it from the comfort of your own office
or lab (or even from the beach in Aruba if there&rsquo;s a good
broadband connection). As Internet2 and the National
Lambda Rail further penetrate research labs in the Uni-
ted States and equivalent systems spread throughout the
world, the rapid exchange of experimental information
and the parallel simulation of data via access to high-
end computational resources will continue to expand
the options available to microscopists and analysts.
</p>
<p>In addition, specialized software packages are also
available on theWebwhich allow you to carry outmany
of the advanced analyses that we will introduce in this
text (e.g., DP analysis and image/diffraction/spectral
simulation). In many cases access to this software is
limited (i.e., you have to pay for it) but any serious
microscopy operator should have access to such soft-
ware on site. Sometimes it is useful to explore the pos-
sibilities before you purchase.
</p>
<p>We have already referenced a few important URLs in
this chapter and we will continue to do so throughout the
book and give lists at the end of each chapter. We have
tried to keep the referencedURLs to sites associated with
longstanding, reputable organizations such as national
labs, professional societies, and major publishers. A list
of broadly useful sites is included below and, not surpris-
ingly, much of this list is very different from the one that
we gave more than a decade ago when the first edition of
this text was published. Nothing much has changed in
this respect and so we cannot guarantee that these same
URLs will still be active when you get round to searching
for them. Such is life in the age of the Web.

of minutes by specifying the orientation relation
between the grains, the interface plane, and the
zone axis. CrystalKit allows the user to freely
rotate the crystal, identify planes, measure angles
and distances between atoms, visually move
atoms, delete atoms, and add new atoms or cre-

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
TEMs comprise a range of different instruments that make use of the properties of electrons,
both as particles and as waves. The TEM generates a tremendous range of signals so we can
obtain images, DPs, and several different kinds of spectra from the same small region of the
specimen. In the rest of this book we&rsquo;ll take you through the fundamental aspects of TEM,
trying to explain at all times why we do certain things in certain ways. We&rsquo;ll also explain to
some degree how we carry out certain operations. Since many different commercial TEMs
exist, there&rsquo;s no point in being specific in how to operate a particular TEM, but we can explain
in a generic sense, in many cases, what you have to do to get your particular one to deliver the
enormous amounts of information that it can generate. Not least of course, we also describe
what you need to know to interpret the images, DPs, and spectra that you obtain.
</p>
<p>If you count up the different imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopic operations that are
available in a TEM there are almost 40 different modes of forming an image, DP, or
spectrum, each of which produces different information about your specimen. (Your last
homework, when you&rsquo;ve finished the book, is to validate this claim!) Each of these informa-
tion planes can be understood in a quantitativemanner, to the extent that we can simulate all
TEM images, DPs, and spectra in a computer. No other characterization technique comes
close to the combination of versatility and quantification that is produced by this remark-
able instrument, particularly when you consider the enormous range of magnifications over
which the information is obtainable.
</p>
<p>There is a wealth of other sources of information about TEM and in the general reference
list below we give a selection of appropriate books that emphasize materials science and

<p>nanotechnology (most of which remain in print) as well as some standard journals and
regular conference proceedings. We also encourage you to get on the WWW and see
what&rsquo;s out there, but be careful about the validity of the content on any particular site. It
is probably reasonable to trust the Web sites from reputable institutions such as govern-
ment labs, commercial TEM and related equipment manufacturers organizations where,
once you get past any sales pitch, there&rsquo;s often great educational material, and of course
the Web pages of professional electron microscopists such as that associated with this text
(URL #4).
</p>
<p>REFERENCES PHILOSOPHY
In the reference sections throughout the book, we will annotate the references but we won&rsquo;t necessarily spell
</p>
<p>them out in the text (we&rsquo;ll give clues); we don&rsquo;t want the chapters to look like journal papers themselves and
</p>
<p>we want to encourage you to look at these reference sections. (This chapter is the exception.) In addition,
</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget the references for the figures right at the end of the textbook where you&rsquo;ll find much more than
</p>
<p>is in the figure captions. We do encourage you to explore the literature&mdash;you really have no choice if you
</p>
<p>want to understand TEM.

<p>Scattering and Diffraction
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>The electron is a low-mass, negatively charged particle. As such, it can easily be deflected by
passing close to other electrons or the positive nucleus of an atom. These Coulomb
(electrostatic) interactions cause electron scattering, which is the process that makes TEM
feasible. We will also discuss how the wave nature of the electron gives rise to diffraction
effects. What we can already say is that if the electrons weren&rsquo;t scattered, there would be no
mechanism to create TEM images or DPs and no source of spectroscopic data. So it is
essential to understand both the particle approach and the wave approach to electron
scattering in order to be able to interpret all the information that comes from a TEM.
Electron scattering from materials is a reasonably complex area of physics, but it isn&rsquo;t
necessary to develop a detailed comprehension of scattering theory to be a competent
microscopist.
</p>
<p>We start by defining some terminology that recurs throughout the book and then we
introduce a few fundamental ideas that have to be grasped. These fundamental ideas can be
summarized in the answers to four questions.
</p>
<p>&amp; What is the probability that an electron will be scattered when it passes near an atom?
&amp; If the electron is scattered, what is the angle through which it is deviated?
&amp; What is the average distance an electron travels between scattering events?
&amp; Does the scattering event cause the electron to lose energy or not?
</p>
<p>The answer to the first question concerning the probability of scattering is embodied in
the idea of a cross section. The angle of scattering (usually determined through the differ-
ential cross section) is also important because it allows you as the TEM operator to control
which electrons form the image and therefore what information is contained in the image.
We will develop this point much further when we talk about image contrast in Part 3 of the
book. The third question requires defining the mean-free path, an important concept given
that we use thin specimens. The answer to the fourth question requires distinguishing elastic
and inelastic scattering. The former constitutes most of the useful information in DPs
obtained in the TEM, discussed in Part 2, while the latter is the source of X-rays and
other spectroscopic signals discussed in Part 4. The distinction between electrons that lose
energy and those that don&rsquo;t is important enough that we devote the next two chapters to
each kind of electron and expand on the basic ideas introduced here.
</p>
<p>2.1 WHY ARE WE INTERESTED IN
ELECTRON SCATTERING?
</p>
<p>We need to know about electron scattering because it is
fundamental to all electron microscopy (not just TEM).
You know well that your eyes cannot see any object
unless it interacts with visible light in some way, for
example through reflection or refraction, which are
two forms of scattering (e.g., we can&rsquo;t see a light beam
unless it is scattered by dust within it or it hits a surface).
Similarly, we cannot see anything in EM images unless
</p>
<p>the specimen interacts with and scatters the electrons
in some way. Thus, any non-scattering object is
invisible and we will come across situations where
&lsquo;invisibility&rsquo; is an important criterion in TEM
images. In the TEM we are usually most interested
in those electrons that do not deviate far from the
incident-electron direction. This is because the TEM
is constructed to gather these electrons primarily and
they also give us the information we seek about the
internal structure and chemistry of the specimen.
Other forms of scattering, such as electrons which
are scattered through large angles (e.g., backscattered
</p>
<p>2.1 WHY ARE WE INTERESTED IN ELECTRON SCATTER ING ? ........................................................................................................... 23</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>electrons) and electrons ejected from the specimen
(such as secondary electrons) are also of interest and
we will not totally neglect them (although they are of
much greater interest in the SEM where they provide
atomic number contrast and surface-sensitive, topogra-
phical images, respectively).
</p>
<p>In this chapter we introduce the fundamental
ideas of electron scattering; then, in the next two
chapters, we discuss the two principal forms of scat-
tering, namely, elastic and inelastic. Both forms are
useful to us, but you&rsquo;ll see that the latter has the
unfortunate side effect of being responsible for speci-
men damage and ultimately limits what we can do
with a TEM.
</p>
<p>To give you some feel for the importance of electron
scattering, it is worth illustrating at this stage the basic
principles of the TEM. You will see in due course that in
a TEMwe illuminate a thin specimen with a broad beam
of electrons in which the intensity is uniform over the
illuminated area.
</p>
<p>We will often refer to incident and scattered elec-
trons as beams of electrons, because we are dealing with
many electrons, not an individual electron; these elec-
trons are usually confined to well-defined paths in the
microscope. So the electrons that hit the specimen are
often called the incident beam and those scattered by the
specimen are called scattered (or sometimes specifically,
diffracted) beams. Electrons coming through a thin spe-
cimen are separated into those that suffer no angular
deviation and those scattered though measurable
angles. We call the undeviated electrons the &lsquo;direct
beam&rsquo; (in contrast to most texts that describe this as
the &lsquo;transmitted beam&rsquo; despite the fact that all electrons
coming through the specimen have been &lsquo;transmitted&rsquo;).
As the electrons travel through the specimen they are
either scattered by a variety of processes or they may
remain unaffected. The end result, however, is that a non-
uniform distribution of electrons emerges from the exit
surface of the specimen, as shown schematically in Figure
2.1. It is this non-uniform distribution that contains all the
structural, chemical, and other information about our
specimen. So everything we learn about our specimen
using TEM can be attributed to some form of electron
scattering.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 9 that the TEM is constructed to
display this non-uniform distribution of electrons in two
different ways. First the spatial distribution (Figure
2.1A) of scattering can be observed as contrast in images
of the specimen, and the angular distribution of scatter-
ing (Figure 2.1B) can be viewed in the form of scattering
patterns, usually called diffraction patterns. A simple
(and fundamental) operational step in the TEM is to
use a restricting aperture, or an electron detector, of a
size such that it only selects electrons that have suffered
more or less than a certain angular deviation. So you as
the operator have the ability to choose which electrons
you want to use and thus you control what information
</p>
<p>DIRECT BEAM
The beam that comes through the specimen, but
remains parallel to the direction of the incident elec-
trons is a very important beam, which we will term
the direct beam.

<p>(B)
</p>
<p>FIGURE 2.1. (A) A uniform intensity of electrons, represented by the hori-
</p>
<p>zontal lines, falls on a thin specimen. Scattering within the specimen changes
</p>
<p>both the spatial and angular distributions of the emerging electrons. The
</p>
<p>spatial distribution (intensity) is indicated by thewavy line. (B) The change in
</p>
<p>angular distribution is shown by an incident beam of electrons being trans-
</p>
<p>formed into several forward-scattered beams.
</p>
<p>WAVE AND PARTICLE
The electron is treated in two different ways through-
out this book: in electron scattering it is a succession
of particles, while in electron diffraction it is treated
by wave theory. The analogy to X-rays or visible light
would be to compare a beam of photons and an
electromagnetic wave. However, you must always
remember that electrons are charged particles and
that Coulomb forces are very strong.

<p>will be present in the image. Therefore, to comprehend
these images, you have to understand what causes elec-
trons to scatter in the first place. The same is true for
DPs since you can also control (to a lesser extent) the
angular-scattering distribution, e.g., by tilting your
specimen.
</p>
<p>We devote the whole of Part 2 to diffraction
phenomena and Part 3 to images. Lastly, Part 4 deals
with ways in which we use inelastic scattering for
analytical electron microscopy (AEM) to study, e.g.,
the chemistry and the bonding of the atoms in our
specimen.
</p>
<p>2.2 TERMINOLOGY OF SCATTERING
AND DIFFRACTION
</p>
<p>Electron-scattering phenomena can be grouped in dif-
ferent ways. We&rsquo;ve already used the most important
terms: elastic and inelastic scattering. These terms,
respectively, describe scattering that results in no loss
of energy or in some measurable loss of energy (usually
very small with respect to the beam energy). In either
case, we can consider the beam electrons and specimen
atoms as particles, and scattering of the incident elec-
trons by the atoms in the specimen can often be approxi-
mated to something like billiard balls colliding. The
billiard-ball analogy will be good through Section 2.7
after which we&rsquo;ll be talking about waves.
</p>
<p>However, we can also separate scattered electrons
into coherent and incoherent, which refers, of course,
to their wave nature. These distinctions are related
since elastically scattered electrons are usually coherent
and inelastic electrons are usually incoherent (note the
modifier &lsquo;usually&rsquo;). Let&rsquo;s assume that the incident elec-
tron waves are coherent, that is, they are essentially in
step (in phase) with one another and of a fixed wave-
length, governed by the accelerating voltage. You&rsquo;ll see
that this isn&rsquo;t a bad assumption in most circumstances.
Then, coherently scattered electrons are those that
remain in step and incoherently scattered electrons
have no phase relationship, after interacting with the
specimen.
</p>
<p>The nature of the scattering can result in different
angular distributions. Scattering can be either forward
scattering or back scattering (usually written as one
word) wherein the terms refer to the angle of scattering
with respect to the incident beam and a specimen that is
normal to that beam. (Note: you will sometimes see the
</p>
<p>term &lsquo;forward scattering&rsquo; used in another sense.) If an
electron is scattered through &lt; 908, then it is forward
scattered and &gt; 908 it is backscattered. These various
terms are related by the following general principles,
summarized in Figure 2.2.
</p>
<p>&amp; Elastic scattering is usually coherent, if the specimen
is thin and crystalline (think in terms of waves).
</p>
<p>&amp; Elastic scattering usually occurs at relatively low
angles (1&ndash;108), i.e., it is strongly peaked in the for-
ward direction (waves).
</p>
<p>&amp; At higher angles (&gt;�108) elastic scattering becomes
more incoherent (now think of particles).
</p>
<p>&amp; Inelastic scattering is almost always incoherent and
is very low angle (&lt;18) scattering (think particles).
</p>
<p>&amp; As the specimen gets thicker, fewer electrons are
forward scattered and more are backscattered. Inco-
herent, backscattered electrons are the only rem-
nants of the incident beam that emerge from bulk,
non-transparent specimens (think particles).

<p>ELECTRON SCATTERING
This theme permeates the whole text and connects
ALL aspects of TEM.
</p>
<p>2.2 TERMINOLOGY OF SCATTER ING AND D I FFRACT ION .................................................................................................................... 25</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The notion that electrons can be scattered through
different angles is related to the fact that an electron can
also be scattered more than once. Generally, the more
scattering events, the greater the angle of scattering
(although sometimes a second scattering event can
redirect the electron back into the direct beam, so it
appears to have undergone no scattering).
</p>
<p>The simplest scattering process is single scattering
and we often approximate all scattering within a TEM
specimen to this process (i.e., an electron either under-
goes a single-scattering event or it suffers no scattering).
We&rsquo;ll see that this can be a very reasonable assumption if
the specimen is very thin (something you can control). If
the electron is scattered more than once, we use the term
plural scattering and if it is scattered &gt;20 times, we say
multiple scattering. It is generally safe to assume that,
unless you have a particularly thick specimen (through
which you probably can&rsquo;t see anything anyhow), multi-
ple scattering will not occur in the TEM. The greater the
number of scattering events, the more difficult it is to
predict what will happen to the electron and the more
difficult it is to interpret the images, DPs, and spectra
that we gather. So, once again, we emphasize the impor-
tance of the &lsquo;thinner is better&rsquo; criterion, i.e., if you create
thin enough specimens so that the single-scattering
assumption is plausible, your TEM research will be
easier.
</p>
<p>Diffraction is a very special form of elastic scattering
and the terminology used can be confusing. Collins&rsquo;
Dictionary defines diffraction as &lsquo;a deviation in the
direction of a wave at the edge of an obstacle in its
path&rsquo; while scattering is defined as &lsquo;the process in
which particles, atoms, etc., are deflected as a result of
collision.&rsquo; The word scatter can also be a noun denoting
the act of scattering. So scattering might best apply to
particles and diffraction to waves; both terms thus apply
to electrons! You should also note that the term diffrac-
tion is not limited to Bragg diffraction which we&rsquo;ll
emphasize in TEM; it refers to any interaction involving
a wave, but many texts are not consistent in this respect.
</p>
<p>In the TEMwe utilize the electrons that go through a
specimen; it is important to note that such electrons are
not simply &lsquo;transmitted&rsquo; in the sense of visible light
through window glass. Electrons are scattered mainly
in the forward direction, i.e., parallel to the incident
beam direction (and we&rsquo;ve already noted the confusion
between &lsquo;direct&rsquo; and &lsquo;transmitted&rsquo;). We&rsquo;ll tell you in a
short while what fraction of the electrons are forward
scattered and how this varies with the thickness of the
specimen and atomic number of the &lsquo;target&rsquo; atom. This
</p>
<p>scattering is a direct consequence of the fact that there is
such a strong interaction between electrons and matter.
</p>
<p>Forward scattering includes the direct beam, most
elastic scattering, diffraction, particularly Bragg diffrac-
tion (see Chapter 3), refraction, and inelastic scattering
(see Chapter 4). Because of forward scattering through
our thin specimen, we see a DP or an image on the
viewing screen, and detect an X-ray spectrum or an
electron energy-loss spectrum outside the TEM column.
But don&rsquo;t neglect backscattering; it is an important
imaging mode in the SEM.
</p>
<p>When physicists consider the theory of electron inter-
actions within a solid, they usually consider scattering of
electrons by a single, isolated atom, then progress to
agglomerations of atoms, first in amorphous solids and
then in crystalline solids and we&rsquo;ll follow a similar path.
</p>
<p>2.3 THE ANGLE OF SCATTERING
</p>
<p>When an electron encounters a single, isolated atom it
can be scattered in several ways which we will cover in
the next two chapters. For the time being, let&rsquo;s imagine
simply that, as shown in Figure 2.3, the electron is
scattered through an angle y (radians) into some solid
angle o, measured in steradians (sr). We have to define
this angle first because you&rsquo;ll see that it plays an impor-
tant role in the subsequent discussion of cross sections.
</p>
<p>Often we assume that y is small enough such that
sin y � tan y � y. When y is this small, it is often
convenient to use milliradians or mrads; 1 mrad is
0.05738, 10 mrads is �0.58.
</p>
<p>The characteristics of the scattering event are con-
trolled by factors such as the incident-electron energy
and the atomic number/weight of the scattering atom.
When we consider a specimen rather than a single

Note that the scattering angle y is in fact a semi-angle,
not a total angle of scattering. Henceforth, whenever
we say &lsquo;&lsquo;scattering angle&rsquo;&rsquo; we mean &lsquo;&lsquo;scattering semi-
angle.&rsquo;&rsquo;

<p>atom, factors such as the thickness, density, crystal-
linity, and angle of the specimen to the incident beam
also become important. To understand these variables,
we need to examine the physics of scattering in more
detail. Of necessity, we&rsquo;ll be rather brief and often
imprecise since we&rsquo;re trying to condense much of
Mott and Massey&rsquo;s substantial and classic textbook
into just a few pages.
</p>
<p>2.4 THE INTERACTION CROSS SECTION
AND ITS DIFFERENTIAL
</p>
<p>The chance of a particular electron undergoing any kind
of interaction with an atom is determined by an inter-
action cross section. The concept of a cross section is
well described by the following analogy given by Rudolf
Peierls (Rhodes 1986)
</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;If I throw a ball at a glass window one square foot
in area, there may be one chance in ten that the
window will break and nine chances in ten that the
ball will just bounce. In the physicist&rsquo;s language
this particular window, for a ball thrown in this
particular way, has a disintegration (inelastic!)
</p>
<p>cross section of 0.1 square feet and an elastic
cross section of 0.9 square feet.&rsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>So each possible interaction has a different cross
section which depends on the energy of the particle, in
our case the beam energy. The cross section (for which
we&rsquo;ll use the Greek letters) has units of area (not square
feet as used in Peierls&rsquo; analogy, but a tiny fraction of the
area of an atom termed a &lsquo;barn&rsquo;). One barn is 10&ndash;28 m2
</p>
<p>(that&rsquo;s (10&ndash;5 nm)2) and the name arises because of the
perverse sense of humor of some of the early atomic
physicists who considered that this unimaginably small
area is &lsquo;as big as a barn door.&rsquo; The cross section does not
represent a physical area but, when divided by the actual
area of the atom, it represents a probability that a scat-
tering event will occur.
</p>
<p>2.4.A Scattering from an Isolated Atom
</p>
<p>First of all we&rsquo;ll consider the scattering cross section for
a single isolated atom, then extend the concept to a
specimen with many atoms. We&rsquo;ll use a generalized
form to start with in this chapter and then break down
the concept of a total cross section into cross sections for
individual processes such as elastic scattering and the
various inelastic processes in the next two chapters.
</p>
<p>Following Heidenreich (1964), we can define the
cross section (an area) in terms of the effective radius
of a single, isolated atom, r
</p>
<p>satom &frac14; pr
2 &eth;2:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>where r has a different value for each scattering process
as we&rsquo;ll see in the next chapter. What interests us in the
TEM is whether or not the scattering process deviates
the incident-beam electrons outside a particular scatter-
ing angle y such that, e.g., they do not go through the
aperture in the lens or theymiss the electron detector. So
we have to know the differential cross section (ds/dO)
which describes the angular distribution of scattering from
an atom. As shown in Figure 2.3 electrons are scattered
through an angle y into a solid angle O and there is a
simple geometrical relationship between y and O
</p>

<p>The larger the cross section, the better the chances of
scattering.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>So the differential scattering cross section for a sin-
gle, isolated atom can be written as
</p>
<p>ds
</p>
<p>dO
&frac14;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2p sin y
</p>
<p>ds
</p>
<p>dy
&eth;2:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>Now, we can calculate satom for scattering into all
angles greater than y by integrating equation 2.4 from y
to p
</p>
<p>satom &frac14;
</p>
<p>&eth;p
</p>
<p>y
</p>
<p>ds &frac14; 2p
</p>
<p>&eth;p
</p>
<p>y
</p>
<p>ds
</p>
<p>dO
sin y dy &eth;2:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>The limits of the integration are governed by the
fact that the values of y can vary from 0 to p,
depending on the specific type of scattering. If we
work out the integral we find that s decreases as y
increases (which makes physical sense). Since ds/dO
is often what is measured experimentally (but not in
the TEM), equation 2.5 gives us an easy way to
determine the cross section for a given atom
(satom) for all values of y, by working out the inte-
gral of (ds/dO)siny from 0 to p.
</p>
<p>2.4.B Scattering from the Specimen
</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s move on from the cross section for a single
isolated atom (with units of area) and consider that the
specimen contains N atoms/unit volume. Therefore, we
can define the total cross section for scattering from the
specimen (in units of m�1) as
</p>
<p>stotal &frac14; Nsatom &eth;2:6&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since N= N0r/A where N0 is Avogadro&rsquo;s number (in
units of atoms mol�1), A is the atomic weight of the
scattering atoms in the specimen (kg mol�1) which has
density r (kg m�3), we can write
</p>
<p>stotal &frac14; Nsatom &frac14;
N0satomr
</p>
<p>A
&eth;2:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>Thus, stotal is the number of scattering events per unit
distance that the electron travels through the specimen.
If the specimen has thickness t, then the probability of
scattering from the specimen is given by
</p>
<p>stotalt &frac14;
N0satom&eth;rt&THORN;
</p>
<p>A
&eth;2:8&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;ve gathered together the product of r and t
because this is called the mass thickness of the speci-
men (e.g., doubling r produces the same effect as dou-
bling t) and we&rsquo;ll come across this term again when
we discuss image contrast and also X-ray absorption.
Equation 2.8 is an important expression, since it contains
all the variables that affect the scattering probability from
a real specimen. We&rsquo;ll use it again when we consider how
certain kinds of image contrast arise in the TEM.
</p>
<p>So we can now appreciate, through a few (rather
simplified) equations, the relationship between the phy-
sics of electron scattering and the information we collect
in the TEM.
</p>
<p>Expressions for the cross section become more com-
plicated as they are modified to give better approxima-
tions for the scattering in a real specimen, as we&rsquo;ll see in
the next couple of chapters. However, the more complex
equations don&rsquo;t alter the basic scattering behavior pre-
dicted by the simple equations we&rsquo;ve just given.
</p>
<p>2.4.C Some Numbers
</p>
<p>Because of all the variables that affect satom and stotal,
it is only possible to give a ballpark (barnyard?) value
for the cross section. For TEM electron energies
(100&ndash;400 keV), the elastic cross section is almost
always the dominant component of the total scatter-
ing. If you look ahead to Figure 3.3, typical small-
angle, elastic cross sections for transition metals bom-
barded by 100-keV electrons are �10�22 m2. This is a
good number to remember for typical elastic scatter-
ing. Inelastic cross sections are generally smaller and
range from �10�22 m2 down to 10�26 m2 depending on
the specific type of scattering and the material. Going
back to equation 2.1, a typical scattering radius (r) is
�10�11 m or �0.01 nm, which might seem a bit small
(about a tenth of an atomic radius) but, since the
scattering is localized to the inner or core shells which
are closer to the nucleus or to a particular electron-
electron interaction, perhaps this isn&rsquo;t such a bad esti-
mate, given all the caveats.
</p>
<p>2.5 THE MEAN FREE PATH
</p>
<p>Instead of using an area to describe the interaction we
can use a length since the distance an electron travels
between interactions with atoms is clearly going to be
important when we are using thin specimens. This new
parameter is then the average distance that the electron
travels between scattering events. This distance is impor-
tant because, if we know what it is, we can work out how
thin we have to make our specimen, so plural scattering
is not significant, thus making it easier to interpret our
images and spectroscopic data in terms of single-scatter-
ing theory. The termstotal can be expressed as the inverse
</p>
<p>INTEGRATE
If we integrate from 0 to y then we determine the
cross section for scattering into all angles less than y
which is in fact more relevant to the TEM situation.

<p>of the mean free path, l. Because the dimensions ofstotal
are m�1 (you can check this using equations 2.1 and 2.7)
there is a simple expression for the mean free path l
which has units of length

<p>A
</p>
<p>N0satomr
&eth;2:9&THORN;
</p>
<p>Typical values of l for scattering at TEMvoltages are of
the order of tens of nm, so single-scattering approxima-
tions imply specimen thicknesses of this order. It is,
unfortunately, conventional to use l to denote the
mean free path; it is not the wavelength of the electron.
From equation 2.9 we can define a probability of scat-
tering p as the electron travels through a specimen thick-
ness t

</p>
<p>which is (stotalt) from equation 2.8.
Although computational resources are constantly
</p>
<p>improving, our knowledge of the values of s, l, and y
is imprecise at best, particularly at the 100&ndash;400 keV
beam energies used in TEMs. Cross sections and mean
free paths for particular scattering events may only be
known within a factor of two, but we can often measure
y very precisely in the TEM. We can combine all our
knowledge of scattering in Monte Carlo simulations to
predict the electron paths as a beam is scattered through
a thin foil.
</p>
<p>The first Monte Carlo calculation was developed by
two of the United States&rsquo; foremost mathematicians,
John von Neumann and Stanley Ulam, at Los Alamos
in the late 1940s. Ulam actually rolled dice and made
hand (!) calculations to determine the paths of neutrons
through deuterium and tritium which proved that Tell-
er&rsquo;s design for the &lsquo;Super&rsquo; (H-bomb) was not feasible
(Rhodes 1995). Monte Carlo methods are used more
often in SEM imaging and X-ray calculations (see,
e.g., NIST&rsquo;s Web site (URL #1), Joy 1995, Goldstein
et al. 2003) but they have a role in TEM in determining
the expected spatial resolution of X-ray analysis as we&rsquo;ll
discuss in Chapter 36. Figure 2.4 shows Monte Carlo
simulations of electron paths through thin foils of Cu
and Au.
</p>
<p>2.6 HOW WE USE SCATTERING
IN THE TEM
</p>
<p>So why have we made you go through all this math?
Because when you select electrons that have been
scattered through a certain angle (choosing a y), you are
changing the effective scattering cross section (sy), because
the scattering strength generally decreases as the angle of
scattering increases. Therefore, there will generally be less
scattering at higher angles, which explains why we said at
the start of the chapter that we are mainly interested in
forward scattering in the TEM. Most scattered electrons
are contained within �58 of the direct beam.

So called because random numbers are used in the
computer programs; the outcome is always predicted
by statistics!
</p>
<p>300 VERSUS 100 kV
Total s decreases as E0 increases; electron scattering
at 300 kV will be less than at 100 kV. Higher-density
regions of your specimen scatter more than lower-
density regions. The target becomes smaller as the
bullets become faster!
</p>
<p>2.6 HOW WE U S E SCATTER ING IN THE TEM ....................................................................................................................................... 29</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>You also have control of the scattering cross section
in other ways. First, the accelerating voltage, which
determines the electron energy E0 (eV), will affect the
cross section as implied in equation 2.3 (specifically for
elastic scattering). In fact, for all forms of scattering,
the total cross section decreases as E0 increases. There-
fore, intermediate- and higher-voltage TEMs will
result in less electron scattering than typical 100-kV
instruments and, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 4, this has
important implications for electron-beam damage in
delicate specimens, such as polymers. Second, and
more intuitively, you can choose specimens with dif-
ferent densities. Denser materials scatter more strongly,
so you have to make them thinner to keep the single-
scattering approximation valid.
</p>
<p>We shall see in the next two chapters that the effect
of the atomic number of the atom is more important in
elastic than inelastic scattering and, as Z increases, elas-
tic scattering dominates. This behavior helps when we
consider ways to enhance scattering (and therefore con-
trast) in low-Z materials such as polymers and biologi-
cal tissue.
</p>
<p>2.7 COMPARISON TO X-RAY
DIFFRACTION
</p>
<p>There is a very good reason why electrons are used in
microscopy: they have a &lsquo;suitable interaction&rsquo; with mat-
ter. Most descriptions of the interaction of electrons
with matter are based on scattering. You will come
across such topics as kinematical scattering and dynam-
ical scattering in addition to elastic and inelastic scatter-
ing, and we will use the formalism of a scattering factor
to describe the process mathematically. It is this scat-
tering process that varies with the structure or composi-
tion of the specimen, permitting us ultimately to image a
microstructure, record a DP, or collect a spectrum.
We&rsquo;ll see in the next chapter that scattering factors are
used when we consider electrons as waves and their
diffraction as a specific form of scattering.
</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s time tomove from billiard balls to waves.
Historically, it was diffraction that provided most of the
crystallographic information we have about materials,
and the majority of those studies used X-rays. This is
partly why X-ray diffraction is so well documented in
the scientific literature. A good understanding of X-ray
diffraction helps considerably in understanding electron
diffraction; however, the primary processes by which
electrons are scattered are very different to the processes
by which X-rays are scattered. Electron scattering is
much more complex.
</p>
<p>X-rays are scattered by the electrons in a material
through an interaction between the negatively
charged electrons and the electromagnetic field of
the incoming X-rays. The electrons in the specimen
</p>
<p>respond to the applied field of the X-ray flux,
oscillating with the period of the X-ray beam. These
accelerated charged particles then emit their own elec-
tromagnetic field, identical in wavelength and phase
to the incident X-rays. The resultant field, which
propagates radially from every scattering source, is
called the scattered wave.
</p>
<p>Electrons are scattered by both the electrons and
the nuclei in a material; the incoming negatively
charged electrons interact with the local electromag-
netic fields of the specimen. The incoming electrons
are therefore directly scattered by the specimen; it is
not a field-to-field exchange as occurs for the case of
X-rays.
</p>
<p>2.8 FRAUNHOFER AND FRESNEL
DIFFRACTION
</p>
<p>Diffraction of visible light is well understood, so we
should carry over as much of the analysis as possible.
Optics is a venerable discipline with a history of several
hundred years and what we&rsquo;re trying to do here is con-
dense the principal messages from classic texts such as
Hecht (2003) into a few pages. So, as with electron
scattering, we&rsquo;ll be making a few simplifications. If you
have any experience with diffraction of visible light
you will have encountered Fraunhofer and Fresnel
diffraction.
</p>
<p>&amp; Fraunhofer diffraction occurs when a flat wavefront
interacts with an object. Since a wave emitted by a
point becomes planar at large distances, this is
known as far-field diffraction.
</p>
<p>&amp; Fresnel diffraction occurs when it&rsquo;s not Fraunhofer.
This case is also known as near-field diffraction.
</p>
<p>We will see later that electron-diffraction patterns
correspond closely to the Fraunhofer case while we &lsquo;see&rsquo;
the effects of Fresnel diffraction in our images.
</p>
<p>In TEM we will find both forms of diffraction.
We will briefly go through the Huygens&rsquo; explanation
of how a wave propagates, then consider Fraunhofer
diffraction from two slits (Young&rsquo;s slits) and then
extend this process to many slits. So why discuss
these topics now? There are two reasons for review-
ing this analysis
</p>
<p>ELECTRONS VERSUS X-RAYS
Electrons are scattered much more strongly than
X-rays.

<p>&amp; It reminds us that coherent interference is purely a
matter of physical optics.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can introduce the concept of phasor diagrams
which we&rsquo;ll use in later chapters.
</p>
<p>Huygens explained the propagation of any wave-
front by imagining that each point on the wavefront
itself acts as a new source for a spherical wavelet. The
wavelets interfere with one another to give the new
wavefront and the process is repeated.
</p>
<p>2.9 DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT FROM SLITS
AND HOLES
</p>
<p>In this section we will very briefly review the topic
known as physical or geometric optics as it relates
to diffraction. Much of what we know about diffraction
of electron waves has been carried over from the under-
standing of the diffraction of visible light and X-rays.
There are textbooks on this topic if you don&rsquo;t vaguely
remember it from high school.
</p>
<p>Two slits (the Young&rsquo;s slits experiment)
</p>
<p>We start with diffraction caused by a wavefront
incident on a pair of very narrow slits. We then select
just two of the Huygens wavelets; these wavelets then
must have the same phase at the slits. As they propa-
gate past the slits, their phases differ depending on the
position of the detector. The important term is the
path difference L = d sin y as shown in Figure 2.5.
The two wavelets propagating in direction r have a
path difference of L and a phase difference of 2pL/l,
i.e., 2pd sin y/l. If d and l are such that this phase
difference is actually a multiple of 2p (so d sin y/l =
an integer, n) then the rays are again in phase and their
amplitudes add. The condition for this additive inter-
ference is thus that d sin y= nl. Therefore, there is an
inverse relationship between d and y for a given d; as d
decreases, sin y increases. If we think of each wavelet
as having an amplitude and a phase we can represent
each by a vector&mdash;a phasor. When the phasors are
parallel to one another (in phase) they add; when
they are antiparallel, they cancel (since they have
equal lengths). A phasor diagram is a way to plot the
amplitude and phase of the total scattered wave; in
other words, when we add the amplitudes of beams we
must take into account their phase.
</p>
<p>Many slits (the diffraction grating)
</p>
<p>When we extend this analysis to more than two slits
we see a similar result but with added subsidiary peaks.
The origin of the subsidiary peaks can best be illustrated
by considering a series of phasor diagrams. (We&rsquo;ll find
similar diagrams useful when we discuss TEM images in
Chapter 27.) We&rsquo;ll examine the case of five slits. Each of
the polyhedra in Figure 2.6 represents a different value
of y. When y is zero, the five rays are all in phase and we
simply add all of the amplitudes (the phasor vectors are
aligned); as y increases the rays become out of phase but
the phasors can still add to give a large resultant vector
but can also add to give zero. For example, when y is
exactly 728 (3608/5 for 5 slits) the phasor diagram is a
closed pentagon (shown in the figure) and the resultant
amplitude is zero. This process repeats at 1448 (2�7208/
5) and 2168 (3�3608/5). In between these values at 1088

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(1.5�3608/5) we produce a local maximum in amplitude
which is repeated at 1808 (2.5�3608/5). If we plot the
amplitude as a function of y, we produce the curve with
a series of subsidiarymaxima shown in Figure 2.6. From
this figure you see that the amplitude is a strong func-
tion of y and you&rsquo;ll learn in the next chapter that the
electron intensity (which is what we see in images and
DPs) is proportional to the square of the amplitude (so
negative amplitudes don&rsquo;t mean anything) and the scat-
tered electron intensity is, therefore, a similarly strong
function of y.
</p>
<p>A single wide slit
What happens if we allow the slit to have some width
</p>
<p>as shown in Figure 2.7? Now the rays from within a
single slit will interfere with each other. We can think
of the single slit as beingmany adjacent slits of width dw.
Imagine dividing the one slit into 11 slits of width dw/11.
This one slit would then produce a phasor diagram as
shown in Figure 2.8; if we make dw increasingly small,
</p>
<p>the phasor diagram becomes a curve: instead of having
Figure 2.8, we have Figure 2.9 (for several different
values of y). If you do the full analysis you&rsquo;d find that
the amplitude from a single slit varies asA=A0f
</p>
<p>�1sin f
wheref is the phase pw sin y/l for a slit of widthw (which
reminds you of the analysis fromFigure 2.5). For one slit,
wewould see a zero in the phasor diagramwhenf=�np.
If we plot the intensity (rather than A) we obtain the Airy
plot shown in Figure 2.10.

resolution in TEM, as we will discuss in Chapter 6. If

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Scattering from a circular hole
</p>
<p>Now the real purpose of the exercise: without going
into the detailed math we can replace the slit of width w,
</p>
<p>by a circular hole or aperture of diameter D. The result-
ing peak width in the plot of amplitude versus y then has
amaximum at 1.22l/D as shown in Figure 2.11, which is
a 3D representation of Figure 2.10 (but the third dimen-
sion is I, not I/I0).
</p>
<p>Because of the circular symmetry of the aperture, the
calculation needed to obtain the number 1.22 involves
the use of Bessel functions which you can find in texts on
physical optics, a few of which we reference at the end of
the chapter.
</p>
<p>As the diameter of the aperture,D, decreases, the mini-
mum resolvable spacing, r, increases (i.e., the resolving
power gets worse). This expression for the Airy disk
diameter also shows that as l decreases, r decreases
(so decreasing l by increasing the accelerating voltage
of the TEM will improve resolution).
</p>
<p>Why is this relevant to TEM?
</p>
<p>The important point about this analysis for TEM is
that we&rsquo;ll see the same relationship in several later chap-
ters. In those chapters, we will replace the slits by an
aperture or we&rsquo;ll replace the hole by an atom or by your
specimen. In other words, this analysis of diffraction
from slits and holes is just geometry applied to optics&mdash;
it&rsquo;s geometric optics.
</p>
<p>2.10 CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE
</p>
<p>To expand on this point, consider an infinite plane wave
described by the usual characteristics of amplitude and
phase. We can describe the wave function c by the
standard expression
</p>
<p>c &frac14; c0exp &frac12;if� &eth;2:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>where c0 is the amplitude and f the phase of the wave.
The phase depends on position x, such that if the path
length changes by one wavelength l, the phase differ-
ence is 2p. Stated another way, the phase difference Df
between any two monochromatic (same wavelength)
waves is related to the path difference Dx they must
travel in going from the source to the detector. The
relationship is
</p>
<p>Df &frac14;
2p
</p>
<p>l
Dx &eth;2:12&THORN;
</p>
<p>This phenomenon of constructive interference is pre-
cisely what we discussed in Figure 2.6. Constructive
interference between waves relies on the fact that the
amplitudes of the waves add when you take account
of the phase. If all waves scattered by all of the atoms
in the specimen are to interfere constructively, they
must all differ in phase by integral multiples of 2p.
Clearly this condition requires that the path differences

<p>traveled by all of the waves be integer multiples of the
wavelength of the incident wave. We can ensure this by
requiring that the scattering centers be periodically spaced;
fortunately this can happen for all crystals. So the
mathematical description of constructive interference
is simplified (as we&rsquo;ll see in Part 2 of this text). The
point here is that this analysis was carried out for
X-rays and was not changed for electrons since it
does not depend on the scattering mechanism, only
on the geometry.
</p>
<p>2.11 A WORD ABOUT ANGLES
</p>
<p>Since angles (remember we mean semi-angles) are so
important in the TEM (you can control some of them
and the specimen controls others) we want to try to be
consistent in our terminology.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can control the angle of incidence of electrons on
the specimen and we will define the angle of inci-
dence as a, as shown in Figure 2.12.
</p>
<p>&amp; In the TEMwe use apertures or detectors to collect a
certain fraction of the scattered electrons and we will
define any angle of collection as b.
</p>
<p>&amp; We will define all scattering angles controlled by the
specimen as y. This may be a specific angle, such as
twice the Bragg angle (where y = 2yB) (see Section
11.4) or a general scattering angle y. So y is the scatter-
ing semi-angle for diffraction even though it is 2yB!
</p>
<p>In fact the only angle of interest in TEMwhich is not
given as a semi-angle is the solid angle of collection of
X-rays by the XEDS detector (see Chapter 32) which is
such amiserably small fraction of the total solid angle of
X-ray generation (4p sr) that it is traditionally given in
terms of the full collection angle!
</p>
<p>2.12 ELECTRON-DIFFRACTION
PATTERNS
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned a couple of times that the TEM is
uniquely suited to take advantage of electron scattering
because it can form a picture (DP) of the distribution of
scattered electrons, which we&rsquo;ll discuss in Part 2 in
much more detail. To understand fully how a DP is
formed in the TEM, you need to go to Chapter 6 to
see how electron lenses work and then to Chapter 9 to
find how we combine several lenses to create the TEM
imaging system. But before we take you through these
concepts it is worth just showing a few of themany kinds
of DPs that can be formed in the TEM. At this stage, all
you have to do is imagine that a photographic film is
placed directly after the thin specimen and that electrons
scattered by the specimen as in Figure 2.1B impinge
</p>
<p>directly on the film. Under these circumstances, the
greater the angle of scatter, the further off center the
electron hits the film.
</p>
<p>Even using this simple description, however, you
can comprehend some of the basic features of DPs.
Figure 2.13 is a montage of several kinds of DPs, all of
which are routinely obtainable in a TEM. You can see
that several points we&rsquo;ve already made about scattering
are intuitively obvious in the patterns. First, most of the
intensity is in the direct beam, in the center of the
pattern, which means that most electrons appear to
travel straight through the specimen. Second, the scat-
tered intensity decreases with increasing y (increasing
distance from the direct beam), which reflects the

angles of scatter at the specimen.

<p>decrease in the scattering cross section with increasing y.
Third, the scattering intensity varies strongly with the
structure of the specimen. You&rsquo;ll see much more of this
in Part II.
</p>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve only considered the amplitude/inten-
sity of the electron wave and neglected the phase.
When a wave is scattered, it will change its phase
</p>
<p>with respect to the incident wave. This is because a
wave cannot change direction and remain in step with
a wave that is not scattered. The phase of the scattered
wave is most important in the specific topic of phase-
contrast images, which have until recently been the
principal form of high-resolution, atomic-level images
such as shown back in Figure 1.2. We&rsquo;ll also come
across the importance of the phase of the scattered
wave when we consider the intensity of diffracted
electron beams and the intensity in diffraction-con-
trast images. But at this stage all you need to know
is that the electrons in the beam are in phase when
they hit the specimen and the process of scattering, in
any form, results in a loss of phase between the scat-
tered and direct beams.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Remember that electrons are strongly scattered because they are charged particles. This is
the big difference compared to X-rays. Electrons are scattered by the electron cloud and by
the nucleus of an atom. Remember X-rays are only scattered by the electron cloud. (In case
you are physics oriented, a quantum-mechanical calculation does give the same distribution
as the classic calculation for the Coulomb force.)
</p>
<p>We have defined four important parameters in this chapter:
</p>
<p>satom the scattering cross section of one atom
stotal the number of scattering events per unit distance traveled in the specimen
ds/dO the differential scattering cross section of one atom
l the mean free path of (average distance traveled by) an electron between
</p>
<p>scattering events
</p>
<p>Finally, a note on grammar! Should we discuss electron scatter or electron scattering?
Electrons are scattered and we observe the results of this scattering (a gerund) but in fact
we see the scatter (noun) of the electrons, which can be measured. However, if you&rsquo;ve been
observant you&rsquo;ll have noticed that we have always used scattering to denote the effect. Our
practice is also consistent with the popular usage, which goes back to the early work of
Bragg and others.

</p>
<p>Elastic Scattering
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Elastically scattered electrons are the major source of contrast in TEM images. They also
create much of the intensity in DPs, so we need to understand what controls this process.
First we&rsquo;ll consider elastic scattering from single, isolated atoms and then frommany atoms
together in the specimen. To comprehend elastic scattering we need to invoke both particle
and wave characteristics of electrons.
</p>
<p>Scattering from isolated atoms can occur either as a result of electrons interacting with
the negatively charged electron cloud, which results in angular deviations of only a few
degrees, or by attraction toward the positive nucleus which scatters the electrons through
much larger angles, up to 1808. Such scattering can often be interpreted in terms of billiard-
ball type, particle-particle collisions, cross sections, and mean free paths that we introduced
in the previous chapter. We&rsquo;ll introduce the Rutherford differential cross section, which
explains the strong dependence of high-angle elastic scattering on the atomic number (Z) of
the atom. Later in the book, we&rsquo;ll show how to use this Z dependence to form images that
reflect the chemistry of the specimen. When we treat the electrons as waves, their coherency
becomes important. The coherency of the scattered electrons is related to their angle of
scattering (y). As this angle becomes larger, the degree of coherency becomes less and
electrons that are Rutherford-scattered out to high angles are incoherent.
</p>
<p>In contrast to Rutherford scattering, electrons that are scattered elastically through
small angles (which we&rsquo;ll define as &lt;38) are coherent. The intensity of this low-angle
scattering is strongly affected by the arrangement of atoms within the specimen. As we
introduced in the previous chapter, such collective scattering by the atoms is referred to as
diffraction and can only be understood if we treat the electron as a wave. Diffraction is
controlled mainly by the angle of incidence of the electron beam to the atomic planes in the
specimen, the spacing between these planes, and interatomic distances within the planes. So
this small-angle, coherent scattering is invaluable for characterizing the crystallography of
the specimen and is undoubtedly the most significant scattering phenomenon in the TEM.
</p>
<p>So as we discuss elastic scattering, you&rsquo;ll see that we often use the wave-particle duality
simultaneously, because both lines of thought are necessary for a full understanding.
</p>
<p>3.1 PARTICLES AND WAVES
</p>
<p>We have two different ways of looking at how an elec-
tron beam interacts with our TEM specimens. We can
consider the beam as a succession of particles or as a
number of waves.Whatwewant to do is understand the
relationship between the two approaches and we can
summarize the two viewpoints thus:
</p>
<p>Electrons are particles so they have the following
properties, which we introduced in Chapter 2.
</p>
<p>&amp; They have a scattering cross section and a differen-
tial scattering cross section.
</p>
<p>&amp; They can be scattered through particular angles
(remember our angles are semi-angles).
</p>
<p>&amp; The electrons interact with the nucleus and the
electron cloud throughCoulomb forces.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can relate this process to scattering of other parti-
cles such as a particles, so lots of analysis can carry over
from other systems.
</p>
<p>PARTICLES AND WAVES
When we discuss X-ray and electron spectrometry
you&rsquo;ll see that we have to use a particle description.
When we discuss imaging, HRTEM, and DPs you&rsquo;ll
see that we use a wave description.
</p>
<p>3.1 PART ICLE S AND WAVES ....................................................................................................................................................................... 39</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Electrons have a wave nature and the electron beam
is almost a plane wave, hence:
</p>
<p>&amp; Waves are diffracted by atoms or &lsquo;scattering centers.&rsquo;
&amp; How strongly a wave is scattered by an atom is
determined by the atomic-scattering amplitude.
</p>
<p>&amp; When we gather atoms together into a solid, the
diffraction process gets much more complicated
but it is central to TEM.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can relate the process to the diffraction of
X-rays, so lots of analysis already exists.
</p>
<p>3.2 MECHANISMS OF ELASTIC
SCATTERING
</p>
<p>In the previous chapter we simply stated that elec-
trons going through a thin specimen are either scat-
tered or not scattered and either lose energy or don&rsquo;t
lose energy. It&rsquo;s now time to describe the ways in
which this scattering occurs and in this chapter we&rsquo;ll
confine our attention to elastic events, saving inelas-
tic scattering for Chapter 4.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s convenient to divide elastic-scattering mechan-
isms into two principal forms: electron scattering from
single, isolated atoms and collective scattering from
many atoms together within the specimen. We&rsquo;ll start
in the same way we did in the previous chapter by
looking first at the interaction of a single electron with
an isolated atom. In this situation, elastic scattering can
occur in one of two ways, both of which involve Cou-
lomb forces. As shown in Figure 3.1, the electron may
interact with the electron cloud, resulting in a small
angular deviation. Alternatively, if an electron pene-
trates the electron cloud and approaches the nucleus, it
will be strongly attracted andmay be scattered through
a larger angle that, in rare cases in the TEM, can
approach 1808 (i.e., complete backscattering).
</p>
<p>In fact many electron-electron interactions are
inelastic, as we&rsquo;ll see in the next chapter. We&rsquo;ll also see,
for example, that the nuclear interaction may result in
the generation of a bremsstrahlung X-ray or may even
result in the displacement of the atom from its site in the
crystal, both of which involve some energy loss for the
electron. Indeed, the higher the angle of scattering of an
electron emerging from the specimen, the greater the
</p>
<p>chance that it will have undergone an inelastic event at
some time during its passage through the specimen.
Despite all this, we&rsquo;ll continue to ignore any inelastic
effects in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The second principal form of elastic scattering occurs
when the electron wave interacts with the specimen as a
whole. We&rsquo;ve already mentioned the best-known form of
this interaction, namely, diffraction, which is particularly
important at low-scattering angles. Understanding dif-
fraction involves treating the electron beam as a wave,
rather than as a particle as we did in Figure 3.1. Following
the original approach of Huygens for the diffraction of
visible light, we imagine each atom in the specimen
that interacts with the incident plane wave acts as a
source of secondary spherical wavelets, as illustrated in
Figure 3.2.
</p>
<p>Thus, the low-angle, elastic scattering distribution is
modified by the crystal structure of the specimen, and
strong diffracted beams emerge at specific angles. The
</p>
<p>INTERFERENCE
These wavelets reinforce one another in certain angu-
lar directions and cancel in other directions: both
reinforcement and cancellation are extremely useful
phenomena.
</p>
<p>ELASTIC?
You should be aware that either of these two inter-
actions may not be truly elastic, so our separation of
scattering into elastic and inelastic is a bit of a
simplification.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 3.1. An isolated atom can scatter a high-energy electron by two
</p>
<p>mechanisms. Coulombic interaction within the electron cloud results in
</p>
<p>low-angle scattering; Coulombic attraction by the nucleus causes higher-
</p>
<p>angle scattering (and perhaps complete backscatter when y &gt; 908). The
potential within the electron cloud is always positive.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>diffracted beam scattered through the smallest angle is
called the first-order beam and we&rsquo;ll discuss these and
higher-order effects in depth in Chapters 11 and 12.
We&rsquo;ll now go on to examine these two forms of elastic
scattering in more detail, starting with the billiard-ball
approach. Then we will briefly describe the scattering of
a wave to show how it relates to this particle-based
treatment and later we&rsquo;ll use the wave approach as the
basis for a full analysis of diffraction.
</p>
<p>3.3 ELASTIC SCATTERING FROM
ISOLATED ATOMS
</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at two possible paths for a beam electron
interacting with an isolated atom as shown in Figure 3.1.
Whether it interactsmore strongly with the nucleus or the
electrons, the electron is scattered through an angle y.
</p>
<p>If we just consider an electron, charge e, accelerated
through a voltage V before being scattered from an
isolated atom, the electron-electron and electron-
nucleus scattering paths are hyperbolic and can be
given by two simple equations (Hall 1953) which are
useful because they summarize the principal factors that
control elastic scattering
</p>
<p>re &frac14; e=Vy (3:1)
</p>
<p>rn &frac14; Ze=Vy (3:2)
</p>
<p>where r is the radius of the scattering field of the nucleus
and the electron. The different cross sections for scatter-
ing through angles &gt; y are given by prn
</p>
<p>2 for the nucleus
and Zpre
</p>
<p>2 for the scattering by Z electrons in the cloud.
If we sum the two components and (just as back in
equation 2.8) multiply by N0rt/A we&rsquo;ll get a sense of
the total elastic scattering through a film of thickness t.
</p>
<p>This approach is &lsquo;&lsquo;defective in many respects&rsquo;&rsquo; as Hall
says but gives you a good qualitative sense of the various
parameters that affect elastic scattering. You can see that
the atomic number Z of the atom controls the elastic
interaction with the nucleus, but the electron-electron
scattering is more a function of the incident-beam energy
V (which has to be in esu if the dimensions of these
equations are to be correct). We&rsquo;ll see later in Chapter
22 that the strong effect of Z becomes important when
we need to enhance scattering in low-Zmaterials, such as
polymers and biological tissue, in order to get better
TEM image contrast. Notice that when the electron
passes close to the nucleus (rn is small) the angle y will
be large. We&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 22 that this dependence on
y directly relates to TEM-image contrast. The electron-
beam energy can also control the image contrast to some
extent. So Z, V, and y all affect image contrast and are
the three major reasons why you cannot avoid having to
study the physics of electron scattering.
</p>
<p>3.4 THE RUTHERFORD CROSS SECTION
</p>
<p>For the next three sections, we&rsquo;ll ignore the low-angle,
electron-electron scattering and concentrate only on scat-
tering by the nucleus. The high-angle, electron-nucleus
interaction is analogous to the backscattering of a parti-
cles from a thin metal foil. The first observation of such
backscattering in 1911 by H. Geiger (of counter fame) and
a Manchester University undergraduate, E. Marsden,
enabled their professor, Ernest Rutherford, to deduce
the existence of the nucleus (never overlook undergradu-
ate research results!). Rutherford (1911) described back-
scattering as &lsquo;&lsquo;the most incredible event that has ever
happened to me&rsquo;&rsquo; (even though he&rsquo;d already won the
Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1908), and he derived the
following expression for the differential cross section for
this high-angle scattering by the nucleus alone

<p>significant energy through inelastic processes, so that
the energy of the electrons,E0 (in keV), is fixed. Aswe&rsquo;ve
already noted, although strictly inaccurate, these
assumptions can be tolerated in the TEM (at least at
100 keV or below).
</p>
<p>3.5 MODIFICATIONS TO THE
RUTHERFORD CROSS SECTION
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll often see the Rutherford differential cross
section in different, but mathematically similar, forms.
For example, equation 3.3 neglects the so-called screen-
ing effect of the electron cloud. Screening can be
thought of as making the nucleus appear somewhat
less positive to the incident electron (although the over-
all charge within the electron cloud is always positive).
So the differential cross section is effectively reduced
and the amount of scattering is lowered. Screening is
only important when the beam electron passes far from
the nucleus and under these circumstances the scattering
angle will be small (say&lt;�38). If we wish to account for
screening, we replace the sin2(y/2) term with [sin2(y/2)
+ (y0/2)
</p>
<p>2] where y0 is called the screening parameter
given by
</p>
<p>y0 &frac14;
0:117Z1=3
</p>
<p>E0
1=2
</p>
<p>(3:4)
</p>
<p>(Here E0 is in keV.) What we are saying is that the
screening parameter can be described by a particular
scattering angle, y0. When the scattering angle is greater
than y0we can neglect electron-electron interactions and
the electron-nucleus interaction is dominant. The value
of y0 at 100 keV is only �28 for Cu and less for lighter
elements, so above a few degrees, all scattering can be
approximated to Rutherford high-angle scattering.
</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted, so far all our equations are non-
relativistic, which is unfortunate since relativistic
effects are significant for electrons with energies
&gt;�100 keV (which is the case for most materials inves-
tigations in the TEM). Fortunately, we can easily cor-
rect for relativity to give a more accurate cross section
by using lR, the relativistically corrected electron
wavelength (see equation 1.7), and a0, the Bohr radius
of the scattering atom
</p>
<p>a0 &frac14;
h2e0
</p>
<p>pm0e2
(3:5)
</p>
<p>where e0 is the dielectric constant. Using the other
constants listed in Table 1.1 we find a0 is 0.0529 nm
(if you&rsquo;re old enough you can easily remember this as
0.5 Å). The net result of adding screening and relativity
corrections is that

</p>
<p>This expression describes the screened, relativistic, differ-
ential Rutherford cross section. One very important
effect of incorporating screening into these equations is
that the cross section does not go to infinity as the scat-
tering angle goes to zero which is an important limita-
tion of all the simpler equations that we used initially.
</p>
<p>The screened Rutherford cross section is the one
most widely used for TEM calculations, although it
has particular limitations at the highest operating vol-
tages (300&ndash;400 kV) and for heavier elements (Z&gt;30)
which scatter electrons through large angles. Under
these circumstances, you should use another cross
section, such as that of Mott, for which you should
consult the text byMott andMassey (which we referred
to in Chapter 2) or Newbury (1986).
</p>
<p>So, as we did for the basic cross section back in
Chapter 2, we can integrate this expression to obtain
the total cross section over specific angular ranges. We
can substitute appropriate values for the various con-
stants and integrate the differential cross section from y
to p to obtain the total nuclear cross section (in scatter-
ing events/electron/atom/m2) for electrons elastically
scattered into angles &gt; y

(3:7)
</p>
<p>(From what we told you in Chapter 2 you ought to be
able to work out the integration necessary to determine
the probability of electrons being scattered into angles
&lt;y.) Again we see that the beam energy (E0), the angle of
scattering (y), and the atomic number (Z) all affect the
probability that an electronwill be scattered by the nuclei
of atoms in the specimen. If you simplify this last expres-
sion by assuming that y is small you should be able to see
some parallels with Hall&rsquo;s less accurate equation 3.2 for
nuclear scattering. However, there&rsquo;s much more to this
whole scattering process than we have covered here and
you should read Newbury (1986) and Jones (1992) for
further discussion of these calculations once you really
appreciate their significance.
</p>
<p>The best way to summarize the characteristics of
cross sections is to present some data. Figure 3.3
shows the variation of the screened Rutherford cross
section in equation 3.7 with scattering angle for (a) three
different elements and (b) two different beam energies.
As you can see for Cu, the cross section decreases by
several orders of magnitude from �10�22 to �10�28 m2
</p>
<p>as the scattering angle increases from 0 to 1808; so, as
we&rsquo;ve already told you, scattering is most likely to occur
in the forward (y � 08) direction and drops off rapidly

<p>above a few degrees. Increasing Z from carbon to gold
can increase the cross section by a factor of�100, which
is why you need proportionately thinner TEM speci-
mens if you want to &lsquo;see&rsquo; through higher-Z materials.
Doubling the electron-beam energy can lower the cross
section by a factor of two or three, which is why higher-
energy electrons are less likely to be scattered by your
specimen than lower-energy electrons, all else being
equal. Figure 3.4 plots the related mean free paths for
elastic scattering. From this graph you can see that
very few high-angle elastic scattering events will occur
</p>
<p>if you can make your specimen &lt; 100 nm in thickness.
Within such specimens, most electrons either undergo
a single-scattering event or are not scattered and we&rsquo;ll
assume that this simplification is a viable approxima-
tion to what&rsquo;s actually going on in the microscope
many times throughout this text. This approximation
is the main reason why, as we&rsquo;ve already noted that in
almost all TEM studies, the &lsquo;thinner is better&rsquo; criterion
applies.

<p>3.6 COHERENCY OF THE RUTHERFORD-
SCATTERED ELECTRONS
</p>
<p>Up to now, in this chapter, we&rsquo;ve treated the electron as a
particle, but there is useful insight to be gained if we
examine the wave nature of the scattered electron.
High-angle Rutherford-scattered electrons are incoher-
ent: i.e., there is no phase relationship between them.
This is a tricky concept because we are scattering
particles. Such incoherent scattering is important in
two respects. First, the high-angle, forward scattering
can be used to form exceptionally high-resolution

<p>images of a crystalline specimen in which the image
contrast is due solely to the value of Z, not the
orientation of the specimen (as is the case for low-
angle coherent diffraction). Such Z-contrast images,
as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 22, provide qualitative atomic-
resolution elemental analysis, in addition to showing
atomic-resolution detail at interfaces between regions
of different Z. Compared to other image-contrast
mechanisms, Z-contrast imaging is a relatively new
technique for most microscopists but, particularly
since the availability of Cs-correctors, it has consis-
tently held the record for the highest-resolution
images and analysis in the TEM (e.g., Varela et al.
2005) and is already beginning to revolutionize our
understanding of the atomic-level structure and chem-
istry of crystal defects.
</p>
<p>Second (but much less important), the high-angle
backscattered electrons (BSEs) can be used to form
images of the beam-entrance surface of the specimen,
in which the contrast is not only due to differences inZ,
but also to changes in surface topography of the speci-
men. BSE images are rarely used in the TEM because
the BSE signal is small. If you go back and look at the
Monte Carlo simulation in Figure 2.4 you&rsquo;ll see that
out of 103 incident electrons in Cu only about three
(0.3%) were backscattered. Therefore, the quality of
this signal is very poor, the images are noisy, and the
contrast is low. The contrast is much better for bulk
specimens in an SEM inwhichmanymore electrons are
backscattered (e.g., about 30% in Cu) and BSEs pro-
vide a stable, high-contrast imaging technique in SEMs
in which you can discriminate between the signals from
adjacent elements in the periodic table. In principle, Z-
contrast should be able to do the same in the TEM.
</p>
<p>3.7 THE ATOMIC-SCATTERING FACTOR
</p>
<p>The classic Rutherford differential cross section cannot
be used to calculate the cross section exactly, because it
ignores the wave nature of the electron beam. A full
treatment involves wave mechanics and is well beyond
the scope of this text. Perhaps the most familiar aspect
of the wave approach to cross sections is the concept of
the atomic-scattering factor f(y), which is related to the
differential elastic cross section by a simple equation
(more on this in Section 3.8)
</p>
<p>f y&eth; &THORN;j j2&frac14;
ds y&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>dO
(3:8)
</p>
<p>What we will now do is to highlight some of the impor-
tant features that lead to this result by outlining the
basic arguments.
</p>
<p>&amp; f(y) is ameasure of the amplitude of an electron wave
scattered from an isolated atom.
</p>
<p>&amp; |f(y)|2 is proportional to the scattered intensity.
</p>
<p>From these two statements and given the importance of
scattered-electron intensity in images and DPs, you can
appreciate why f(y) is such an important parameter in
TEM.
</p>
<p>The scattering-factor approach is complementary to the
Rutherford differential cross section analysis, because it is
most useful for describing the low-angle (i.e.,&lt;�38) elastic
scattering where the Rutherford model is inappropriate.
Usually, f(y) is defined in the following manner

<p>&eth;Z� fx&THORN; (3:9)
</p>
<p>All the terms have been previously defined (note
that we&rsquo;ve dropped the screening term, so remember
what this implies). If you need a more detailed approach
you could consult the physics-based text by Reimer.
Because we&rsquo;re now thinking in terms of waves, we need
thewavelength l (controlled of course by the beam energy
E0), and fx is the scattering factor for X-rays, which is well
known. The most widely referenced source of electron-
scattering factors for TEMwas usually the classic work of
Doyle and Turner (1968), but you can now find values in
software packages (see Section 1.6) and you can even do
your own calculations using the free software on the
NIST database (also in Section 1.6 and URL #1). The
appearance of fx in equation 3.9 is a reminder that f(y) is a
fundamental result of the wave nature of the electron.
</p>
<p>We can plot this angular variation for a single iso-
lated atom. Figure 3.5 summarizes graphically what we
already know about the magnitude of elastic scattering
(see equations 3.1 and 3.2)
</p>
<p>&amp; It decreases as y increases (y&frac14; 08 for the incident-
beam direction).
</p>
<p>&amp; It decreases as l decreases (i.e., as the accelerating
voltage (V) increases).
</p>
<p>&amp; It increases with Z for any value of y.
</p>
<p>COHERENCY
Coherency of the scattered electron is a wave prop-
erty. If the scattered electron waves have a phase
relationship they must be coherent.
</p>
<p>f(q)
The atomic-scattering factor f(y) depends on l, y,
and Z.
</p>
<p>44 .................................................................................................................................................................................. ELAST IC SCATTER ING</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This expression (equation 3.9) for f(y) contains
components of both elastic nuclear scattering (the Z
term) and elastic electron-cloud scattering (the fx
term). We&rsquo;ll see later in the chapters on diffraction
in Part 2 that the f(y) approach is used exclusively
and, if we neglect the fx term, then it can be shown that
|f(y)|2 is mathematically equivalent to the high-angle
Rutherford differential cross section, as we defined it
in equation 3.6. So now we&rsquo;ve tied together the
particle and wave approaches to elastic scattering.
</p>
<p>3.8 THE ORIGIN OF f(q)
</p>
<p>Since f(y) relates to the amplitude of a scattered wave,
we&rsquo;ll consider briefly how it arises. The following anal-
ysis is not intended to be completely rigorous, but only
to give the fundamental ideas behind the meaning of f(y)
and its relation to the differential scattering cross
section. You can safely delay studying this topic until
curiosity wins, then you can go and read the really thick
physics textbooks.
</p>
<p>To find the total elastic-scattering cross section,
we have to integrate ds/dO. Note that this is a particle
model, but you should also be aware of how the wave
nature of the electrons is brought in. We can consider
the wave nature by looking at Figure 3.6 (which
you should realize is closely related to Figures 2.3
and 2.12).
</p>
<p>We can describe the incident beam as a wave of
amplitude c0 and phase 2pkr
</p>
<p>c &frac14; c0e
2pikr (3:10)
</p>
<p>In this definition of phase, k is the magnitude of the
wave vector and r is the distance that the wave has
propagated, as we&rsquo;ll discuss in detail later in Chapter
11. When the incident plane wave is scattered by a
point charge, a spherical scattered wave is created
which has a different amplitude csc but keeps the
same phase apart from a p/2 addition which we return
to in a moment
</p>
<p>csc &frac14; c0f y&eth; &THORN;
e2pikr
</p>
<p>r
(3:11)
</p>
<p>In this equation, f(y) is the amplitude we would have
if c0&frac14; 1, i.e., it is the atomic-scattering amplitude.

</p>
<p>ANGLE VARIATION
The important point to remember is that both the
differential cross section and the scattering factor are
simply measures of how the electron-scattering inten-
sity varies with y.
</p>
<p>3.8 THE OR IG IN OF f (y) ............................................................................................................................................................................. 45</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>So obviously we need to know f(y) and an accep-
table model is essential to make the problem manage-
able. Up to this point, our treatment has been quite
rigorous and ideally, the model would distinguish
between a neutral atom in a metal, a covalently bonded
atom, and an ion. If you&rsquo;re desperate, the quantity f(y)
can always, in principle, be calculated from the
Schrödinger equation. In practice, however, we usually
use a simple approximation which we&rsquo;ll now describe.
</p>
<p>If we write down the expression for the scattering
process shown in Figure 3.6, then we have
</p>
<p>csc &frac14; c0 e
2pikI � r &thorn; if y&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>e2pikr
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(3:12)
</p>
<p>You should note first of all that, as usual for Huygens
wavelets, there is a 908 phase shift (shown by the
inclusion of &lsquo;i &rsquo; in the second term) between the incident
and scattered beams and secondly, that f(y) can be
expressed as
</p>
<p>f y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; f y&eth; &THORN;j jeiZ y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; f y&eth; &THORN;j j cosZ y&eth; &THORN; &thorn; i sinZ y&eth; &THORN;&eth; &THORN; (3:13)
</p>
<p>which means that the phase, Z(y), of f(y) also depends
on the angle of scatter, y.
</p>
<p>First aside: In writing equation 3.12, we have
introduced two wave-propagation parameters:
the vector kI for the incident plane wave and
the scalar k for the spherical scattered wavelet.
By writing the 2p factor separately as part of the
phase term, we have implicitly defined k to be 1/l.
Many physics textbooks include the 2p in k so they
have k given by 2p/l. Just be careful when you
compare similar formulas in two textbooks.
</p>
<p>Second aside: The 908 phase change for
the scattered-wave component in equation 3.13
can be easily understood if you consider
the following. If the amplitude of the wave
is initially c0sin(2pkr) then, after it has passed
through the specimen, it will be ctot. After scatter-
ing, the phase is increased by f, so we can express
the new ctot as
</p>
<p>ctot &frac14; c0 sin 2pkz&thorn; f&eth; &THORN; &frac14; c0 sin 2pkz&eth; &THORN; cosf
</p>
<p>&thorn;c0 cos 2pkz&eth; &THORN; sinf (3:14)
</p>
<p>Now if f is small, then cos f � 1 and sin f � f; cos y is
always the same as sin (y + p/2), hence
</p>
<p>ctot &frac14; c0 sin 2pkz&eth; &THORN; &thorn; c0f sin 2pkz&thorn;
p
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(3:15)
</p>
<p>The p/2 term would arise if we used the exponential
rather than the sine to denote phase, so we can now
write equation 3.15 as
</p>
<p>ctot &frac14; c&thorn; icsc (3:16)
</p>
<p>This equation has the same form as that given in equa-
tion 3.12.
</p>
<p>3.9 THE STRUCTURE FACTOR F(q)
</p>
<p>The next introductory step in discussing electron scatter-
ing is to take the idea of individual atoms scattering
electrons (i.e., f(y)), which we&rsquo;ve just discussed in some
detail, and consider what happens when the atoms are
stacked together regularly in a crystal structure. (We can,
in principle, also do this for an amorphous solid but we&rsquo;ll
stick to crystals for simplicity.) We will deal with this
approach in great detail in Chapter 13, but for now we
can introduce the structure factorF(y),which is ameasure
of the amplitude scattered by a unit cell of a crystal
structure. Because F(y) is an amplitude like f(y), it also
hasdimensionsof length.We candefineF(y) as the sumof
the f(y) terms from all the i atoms in the unit cell (with
atomic coordinates xi yi zi) multiplied by a phase factor.
The phase factor takes account of the difference in phase
between waves scattered from atoms on different but
parallel atomic planes with the same Miller indices (hkl).
The scattering angle y is the angle between the incident
and scattered electron beams. So we can write
</p>
<p>F y&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
X
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>fie
2pi hxi&thorn;kyi&thorn;lzi&eth; &THORN; (3:17)
</p>
<p>The amplitude (and hence its square, the intensity)
of scattering is influenced by the type of atom (f(y)),
the position of the atom in the cell (x,y,z), and the
specific atomic planes (hkl) that make up the crystal
structure. None of this is very surprising, but it turns
out that this equation predicts that in certain circum-
stances the amplitude of scattering is zero. This beha-
vior is intrinsic to the scattering process, is implicit
back in Figure 3.2, and is often a very useful diagnostic
test when determining crystal structures in the TEM.
</p>
<p>1/l AND 2p/l
Sometimes k&frac14; 1/l and sometimes k&frac14; 2p/l and it&rsquo;s
sometimes difficult to find out which definition is
being used.
</p>
<p>ZERO SCATTERING
Under specific conditions, electrons scattering in a
crystal may result in ZERO scattered intensity. Why
might this occur?

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to this point in Chapter 13 in much
more detail.
</p>
<p>3.10 SIMPLE DIFFRACTION CONCEPTS
</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, electron diffraction is by
far the most important scattering phenomenon in the
TEM. The reason for this importance, as we&rsquo;ll show
you in Chapters 11 and 12, is that we can use
diffraction to determine the spacing of planes in
crystals and, as you&rsquo;ll see later in Chapters 20, 21,
and in the companion text, there is a whole field
termed electron crystallography which gives an
unprecedented amount of crystallographic informa-
tion from space-group symmetry data right down to
the dimensions of single unit cells. At the most basic
level, the interplanar spacings in different crystal
structures are characteristic of that structure.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see that the positions of the diffracted beams
of electrons are determined by the size and shape of
the unit cell and the intensities of the diffracted beams
are governed by the distribution, number, and types of
atoms in the specimen. We&rsquo;ll also show you in Part 3
how diffraction leads to contrast in TEM images
which is controlled by the orientation of a crystal
with respect to the electron beam and which you can
control simply by tilting your specimen.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see, in a qualitative manner, how diffrac-
tion modifies the distribution of the low-angle scatter-
ing, described by f(y), and shown for a single atom in
Figure 3.5. When we consider the effect of the arrange-
ment of atoms in the specimen, then Figure 3.5 has to be
modified. For an amorphous specimen, the atoms are
almost (but not quite) randomly arranged. A random
arrangement would result in a plot similar to Figure 3.5,
but there are certain interatomic spacings that tend to
occur in an amorphous structure (e.g., first- and sec-
ond-nearest neighbor spacings are usually relatively
well defined). As a result, the amplitude (and hence
the intensity) of diffraction is stronger at some angles
than at others, so we see diffuse, bright rings on the
TEM screen. If the specimen is crystalline, then the
intensity of the diffracted beams is a maximum at
specific angles because the interplanar spacings are
very well defined. The variation of f(y) with y plotted
in Figure 3.7A and B is equivalent to the radial
</p>
<p>intensity variation across the DPs in Figure 2.13A
and C, respectively, and thus emphasizes the strong
relationship between f(y) and diffracted intensity.
We&rsquo;ll describe this important relationship mathemati-
cally in Section 3.10.B below.
</p>
<p>3.10.A Interference of Electron Waves; Creation
of the Direct and Diffracted Beams
</p>
<p>To interpret low-angle elastic scattering (which is pri-
marily from the electron cloud) it is best to think in
</p>
<p>DP PLUS IMAGE
We can distinguish different crystal structures by
observing and measuring DPs. The combination of
the DP and the electron image(s) is a most powerful
tool for characterizing crystals and particularly their
defects.

<p>terms of electron waves and not in terms of particle-
particle interactions that characterize high-angle
Rutherford scattering. If you go back and look at
Figure 3.2 you see a periodic one-dimensional array
of scattering centers (slits), and a monochromatic
wave (i.e., fixed l) is advancing toward these centers.
Each center acts as a new source of a wave of the same
l. Thus many new waves are created and, when more
than one wave is present, the waves can interfere with
one another. This process happens from even the
thinnest specimens and is entirely a wave phenom-
enon that doesn&rsquo;t need concepts such as cross section,
which we apply when we think of the electron as a
particle.
</p>
<p>A rule of wave theory is that waves reinforce one
another (this is constructive interference) when they are
in phase. Waves also cancel one another (destructive
interference) when they are out of phase. What you see
in Figure 3.2 is that the diffracted waves are in phase
with one another only in certain directions. There is
invariably a zero-order wave that proceeds in the same
direction as the incident wave, which in the TEM we&rsquo;ll
refer to as the direct beam of electrons, as we defined at
the start of Chapter 2. There are also higher-order waves
that propagate in forward directions that are at some
fixed (but very small) angle to the incident wave and
we&rsquo;ll call these the diffracted beams.
</p>
<p>So diffraction creates many electron beams trav-
eling at specific angles relative to a single mono-
chromatic incident beam. In the chapters on
diffraction in Part 2, we&rsquo;ll find ways to measure
these angles and relate them to the spacing of the
scattering planes.
</p>
<p>3.10.B Diffraction Equations
</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;ll introduce the mathematical relationships
that describe the diffraction process. The idea of using
diffraction to probe the atomic structure of materials
was credited to von Laue (1913) in Germany, although
others such as Ewald were working on similar ideas at
the same time. Von Laue&rsquo;s crucial idea was that much
shorter electromagnetic rays than lightwould cause diffrac-
tion or interference phenomena in a crystal. Although his
colleague Sommerfeld, with whom he discussed the idea
while skiing, disagreed, Friedrich, one of Sommerfeld&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>assistants, and Knipping tested the idea experimentally
by irradiating a copper sulfate crystal and became the
first to observe diffraction from crystal planes. In fact it
was a remarkable stroke of luck that the CuSO4 dif-
fracted the X-rays at all because of the strict equations
that govern diffraction.
</p>
<p>Von Laue used the well-known light-optics
approach to argue that the diffracted waves are in
phase if the path difference between waves scattered by
adjacent scattering centers is a whole number of wave-
lengths, hl (h is an integer). Thus, as shown in Figure
3.8, if the scattering centers (B and C) are spaced some
distance a apart and the incident beam (wavelength l)
makes an angle y1with the line connecting the scattering
centers and is diffracted at an angle y2, then the path
difference AB &ndash; CD is
</p>
<p>a&eth;cos y1 � cos y2&THORN; &frac14; hl (3:18)
</p>
<p>Now in three dimensions, two more Laue equations
can be written for two more distances b and c and
appropriate angles yn
</p>
<p>b&eth;cos y3 � cos y4&THORN; &frac14; kl (3:19)
</p>
<p>c&eth;cos y5 � cos y6&THORN; &frac14; ll (3:20)
</p>
<p>These three simultaneous equations bear von
Laue&rsquo;s name and for his original suggestion and the
analysis of the experiments of Sommerfeld&rsquo;s students,
he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914 (nice
work: three equations). We&rsquo;ll show in Chapter 11 that

<p>incident at an angle y1 and scattered at an angle y2 from two atoms (B and
</p>
<p>C) spaced distance a apart. The path difference between scattered waves is
</p>
<p>AB &ndash; CD.
</p>
<p>DIRECT AND DIFFRACTED
The direct beam consists of electron, scattered in the
same direction as the incident beam. Often in TEM
terminology these electrons are called the transmitted
beam but this term is ambiguous since, in fact, all
forward-scattered beams are &lsquo;transmitted&rsquo; through
the specimen.
</p>
<p>48 .................................................................................................................................................................................. ELAST IC SCATTER ING</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>in a TEM specimen, when all three Laue equations are
satisfied simultaneously a diffracted beam is produced.
We&rsquo;ll also show you in Chapters 11 and 12 that the
letters hkl are the indices of the diffracted beam and
are equivalent to theMiller indices (hkl) of the diffract-
ing crystal plane (or some multiple thereof).
</p>
<p>Usually in TEM, we use a simpler approach to
describe diffraction. Von Laue&rsquo;s approach was simpli-
fied by the family team of Sir William H. (obviously the
dad) and Mr. W. Lawrence Bragg (the son) in England
who proposed (Bragg and Bragg 1913) that the waves
behaved as if they were reflected off atomic planes as
shown in Figure 3.9.
</p>
<p>In parallel with von Laue&rsquo;s optical approach, the
Braggs argued that waves reflected off adjacent scattering
centers must have a path difference equal to an integral
number of wavelengths, if they are to remain in phase.
So, in the TEM the path difference between electron
</p>
<p>waves reflected from the upper and lower planes in Fig-
ure 3.9 is (AB + BC). Thus, if the &lsquo;reflecting&rsquo; hkl planes
are spaced a distance d apart and the wave is incident and
reflected at an angle yB, both AB and BC are equal to
d sin yB and the total path difference is 2d sin yB. So we
can write what is known as Bragg&rsquo;s (although gramma-
tically and historically it should be Braggs&rsquo;) law
</p>
<p>nl &frac14; 2d sin yB (3:21)
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll reserve yB for the Bragg angle, which is the
most important scattering angle (remember we really
mean semi-angle) in TEM and you&rsquo;ll come across it
many more times in this text. The Braggs also received
a Nobel Prize in Physics a year after von Laue but this
time for only one equation (even nicer work!) and
despite the fact that the idea of reflected electrons,
while mathematically correct, is physically wrong.
We&rsquo;ll continue to use the term Bragg reflection to
describe diffraction in the TEM because everyone
does so, even though it&rsquo;s inaccurate, and because it is
extremely useful. However, we&rsquo;ll demonstrate to you,
in a rigorous fashion, the mathematical equivalence of
the Bragg and von Laue approaches in Chapter 12.
</p>
<p>It is simple to see from the Bragg equation that
atomic planes which are closer together give rise to
larger angles of scatter. This reciprocal relationship (d
is proportional to 1/y; see Chapter 12) is very impor-
tant in diffraction-pattern interpretation. So, if you
know l for the incident electron (which you control
by choosing the accelerating voltage) and you can
measure y experimentally, you can work out the inter-
planar spacings in your specimen. It is this crystallo-
graphic information that makes diffraction such an
important aspect of the TEM.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
What should you remember from this chapter? Until you have time to study this material
very carefully you may find it difficult, so here are a few suggestions:
</p>
<p>&amp; Know the words! In particular, we can describe the scattering process by three param-
eters
</p>
<p>s(y) the scattering cross section
</p>
<p>ds y&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>dO
the differential scattering cross section
</p>
<p>f(y) the atomic-scattering amplitude
</p>
<p>In particular, don&rsquo;t be put off because &lsquo;differential scattering cross section&rsquo; sounds
difficult. All three terms are very important in different parts of TEM.
</p>
<p>&amp; The relationships between f(y) and s(y) are very important (as a principle, but not
much used in practice).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; The relationship between f(y) and the intensity in a DP is very important.
</p>
<p>Remember that, although we often write s(y) as s, there is an angle involved in any s
</p>
<p>&amp; The fact that the electron is a charged particle is critical to the whole scattering process.
&amp; The strength of the scattering, f(y), depends inversely on the scattering angle, y.
</p>
<p>Yes, a really rigorous treatment of scattering would take into account the wave nature of the
electron (wave mechanics), relativity, and the electron charge, all at the same time. Because
we&rsquo;re good guys wewon&rsquo;t inflict this on you or ourselves. Fortunately, if required, we can do
very well using compiled tables of cross sections and scattering data, which are available on
the web (e.g., URL #1).
</p>
<p>We can describe the effect of the crystal structure on the electron scattering by one more
parameter, the structure factor F(y)
</p>
<p>&amp; F(y) is a measure of the amplitude scattered by a unit cell and F&eth;y&THORN;j j2 is proportional to
the scattered intensity.
</p>
<p>The diffraction process from aTEM specimen is usually described by the Bragg equation
which tells us the important reciprocal relationship between atomic-plane spacings and
scattering angles.
</p>
<p>A final point to think about: remember that f(y) is the property of a &lsquo;scattering center.&rsquo; We
usually think of this center as being an atom.What happens if the scattering center is an ion (i.e.,
if it is charged)? Is the scattering process affected by how this atom is bonded to its neighbors?
What changes if the atom has a covalent rather than a metallic bond? These are important
questions (otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t ask them) and we&rsquo;ll teach you the answers as we go on.

</p>
<p>Inelastic Scattering and Beam Damage
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we discussed elastic scattering of the electron beam in which the
incident electrons lost no energy as they traversed the specimen. Inelastically scattered
(often termed energy-loss) electrons are equally important and we&rsquo;ll discuss many of these
processes here, but leave the applications till later. Why are we interested in inelastic
scattering? Well, such scattering generates a whole range of signals, each of which can tell
us more about the chemistry of the specimen than we can find out from the elastic electrons.
In addition to the energy-loss electrons themselves, the most important signals are the
characteristic X-rays, secondary electrons, and, occasionally, visible light (cathodolumines-
cence (CL)) and sowe&rsquo;ll emphasize how these arise.Wewill also tell youwhy all these signals
are useful, to varying degrees, to materials scientists, engineers, and nanotechnologists.
</p>
<p>So how do we use these inelastic signals? First we have to detect them and we&rsquo;ll describe
electron detection in general in Chapter 7 and the spectrometers that disperse electrons
according to their energy in Chapter 37. Then in Chapters 38&ndash;40 we&rsquo;ll talk about analyzing
these energy-loss electrons. We will discuss how to detect X-rays in Chapter 32 and how we
get quantitative, elemental information from the spectra in Chapters 33&ndash;36. In all cases we
get complementary information to that gained in TEM images and DPs. We&rsquo;ll briefly
discuss CL images and spectra in Chapter 29. Obviously there&rsquo;s a lot of useful information
in these signals and this is a major advantage to using ionizing radiation. However, the other
side of the coin is that all the inelastic processes deposit energy in your specimen, which can
be damaged if it is beam sensitive. So we must also look at the downside of the inelastic
processes andwe end the chapter by discussing this problem under the general topic of beam
damage or radiation damage.
</p>
<p>A warning: This chapter is based on some quite difficult theoretical, physical concepts.
However, these concepts form the basis of AEM,which constitutes Part 4 of the book, so we
have to address the material. You can safely delay studying much of this material in detail
until you reach Chapter 32 and beyond.
</p>
<p>&amp; What you need to get out of this chapter is an appreciation that a modern TEM is
primarily a signal-generating and detecting instrument, not just a tool for producing
high-magnification images.
</p>
<p>One redeeming feature is that in all these processes we can treat the electron as a particle.
So this is (almost) a wave-free chapter, which generally means that it is more easily under-
standable unless you have an in-depth physics background.
</p>
<p>4.1 WHICH INELASTIC PROCESSES
OCCUR IN THE TEM?
</p>
<p>Historically, the conventional TEM used only two
elastic signals, namely, the direct beam and the dif-
fracted beam(s). As we&rsquo;ve seen, these signals constitute
the DP and we&rsquo;ll see in due course how they can be
used to produce images. In operating a TEM in this
</p>
<p>classical manner we are being extraordinarily ineffi-
cient; we throw away a vast amount of information
about our specimen which is contained in the signals
that result from inelastic scatter. Some of these signals
are shown back in Figure 1.3 and are often used pre-
dominantly in related instruments such as the SEM
and the Auger electron spectrometer (AES), but we
can also use TEMs to detect many of these signals,
</p>
<p>4 .1 WH ICH INELAST IC PROCES SES OCCUR IN THE TEM? ................................................................................................................ 53</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>thus allowing for a more complete characterization of
the specimen.
</p>
<p>Because some of the incident-beam electrons lose
energy, all these signals are related to the general topic
of electron energy-loss spectrometry (EELS). The
EELS signals and the accompanying X-ray signals
constitute analytical electron microscopy (AEM),
which we cover in Part 4. In seeking to detect more
signals from the specimen, we find that practically we
cannot do everything at once, nor can we do it all with
equal efficiency. Nevertheless, various kinds of analyt-
ical TEMs exist which, in one form or another, can
detect all the signals shown in Figure 1.3. With the
advent of aberration correction, the spatial resolution
and the detection limits of the various techniques have
reached or closely approach the single-atom level and
so are very well suited to the characterization of
nanostructured materials.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we&rsquo;ll cover all the signals that are
detectable and what use (if any) they are to the nano-
technologist. We need to know
</p>
<p>&amp; What are the inelastic-scattering interactions?
&amp; What is the range of energy losses associated with
each process?
</p>
<p>&amp; What is the likelihood that each energy-loss process
will occur?
</p>
<p>&amp; What is the scattering angle for the various energy-
loss electrons?
</p>
<p>When a high-energy electron encounters an atom, it
first penetrates the outer, loosely bound electron cloud,
then it passes the more tightly bound inner (or core) shell
electrons, and finally it may encounter the nucleus.
</p>
<p>This range of inelastic scattering produces a range of
scattering angles, but there is no simple relationship
between the energy lost and the scattering angle. We&rsquo;ll
separate the inelastic processes into three components
</p>
<p>&amp; Processes that generate X-rays
&amp; Processes that generate other (secondary) electrons
&amp; Processes that result from collective interactions
with many atoms or electrons
</p>
<p>We know the first two rather well, but the third
is usually poorly defined. Figure 4.1 shows the cross
sections for the most important inelastic processes
</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about. As you can see, the elastic and
one of the inelastic (plasmon excitation) processes
are by far the most likely events and together
account for almost all of the total scattering cross
section that we discussed back in Chapter 2 (with the
caveat that the data in this figure are for small-angle
scattering only). These cross sections vary over sev-
eral orders of magnitude and this fact alone should
give you some feel for the relative generation prob-
ability of each signal. We&rsquo;ll discuss the specific cross
sections for inelastic scattering in more detail as we
describe each individual scattering event.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see throughout the book that energy-loss pro-
cesses are both useful and damaging. For example, in
Chapter 19 we describe how energy-loss electrons cause
Kikuchi lines to arise in DPs and these are extraordina-
rily useful. In contrast, some of those same energy-loss
electrons cause diffuse scatter that lowers the signal to
background information in all DPs and images. If your
specimen is thick enough, the energy-loss electrons hide
all the useful contrast information, but we&rsquo;ll see in Part 4
how to use EELS to filter out those electrons from
images and DPs. This filtering improves the quality of
both image and DP and allows the study of much
thicker specimens.
</p>
<p>RULE OF THUMB
The deeper the electron penetrates into the atom, the
greater the energy that may be lost. It is possible (but
very rare) for the electron to lose all its energy in a
single nuclear interaction.

<p>4.2 X-RAY EMISSION
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll consider X-ray emission first because it&rsquo;s the most
important secondary signal generated in the specimen.
From X-rays we can quickly find out what elements
constitute the part of the specimen interacting with the
electron beam and we can also quantify the amount of
each element in quite a straightforward manner. (The
way to do all of this is described in Part 4.) Two kinds of
X-rays are produced
</p>
<p>&amp; Characteristic X-rays; we&rsquo;ll see these are very useful
for local elemental analysis of nano-structuredmate-
rials and crystal defects.
</p>
<p>&amp; Bremsstrahlung X-rays, which are useful to the biol-
ogist, but generally regarded as a nuisance by most
materials scientists (nano or otherwise).
</p>
<p>4.2.A Characteristic X-rays
</p>
<p>Howdowe produce characteristic X-rays and of what are
they &lsquo;characteristic&rsquo;? First of all, a high-energy beam elec-
tronmust penetrate through the outer conduction/valence
bands and interact with the inner-shell (or core) electrons.
If more than a critical amount of energy is transferred to
an inner-shell electron, that electron is ejected; i.e., it
escapes the attractive field of the nucleus, leaving a hole
in the inner shell. In an isolated atom, the electron is
ejected into the vacuum while in a solid it escapes above
the Fermi level into the unfilled states. The atom is then
left in an excited state because it has more energy than it
would like, and we describe it as ionized.
</p>
<p>The ionized atom can return almost to its lowest
energy (ground state) by filling in the hole with an
electron from an outer shell. This transition is accom-
panied by the emission of either an X-ray or an Auger
electron. This latter process was first described byAuger
(1925) and won him the Nobel Prize for Physics. (Since
the discoverer was French, we pronounce his name
&lsquo;&lsquo;Ozhay&rsquo;&rsquo; with a soft g as in beige.) In both the X-ray
and Auger cases, the energy of the emission is character-
istic of the difference in energy between the two electron
shells involved and this energy difference is unique to
the atom. The process of X-ray emission is shown sche-
matically in Figure 4.2. We&rsquo;ll cover Auger emission in
Section 4.3.B
</p>
<p>Note that characteristic X-rays can also be produced
if an atom is ionized by a process other than electron
irradiation. For example, ionization can occur as a
result of X-ray bombardment also, in which case we
use the term fluorescence. It is customary not to refer
to electron-induced X-ray emission as fluorescence,
although you may occasionally come across such
usage in the literature.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to detect X-rays in electron micro-
scopes for many years, but Auger electron detection is
</p>
<p>rather specialized and usually carried out in a dedi-
cated AES. More recently, however, we&rsquo;ve found
ways to detect the Auger signal in ultrahigh vacuum
(UHV) TEMs and so we&rsquo;ll discuss this in Section 4.3.B
below.
</p>
<p>You need to know several aspects of the ionization
process to understand why the characteristic X-rays are
so useful and what it takes to generate them
</p>
<p>&amp; What are electron shells?
&amp; Why do we use the terms X-ray lines, families, and
weights?
</p>
<p>&amp; What is the critical ionization energy and the ioniza-
tion cross section?
</p>
<p>&amp; What controls the X-ray energy and wavelength?
&amp; What is the fluorescence yield ?
</p>
<p>Electron shells: We use a specific terminology to iden-
tify the different characteristic X-rays. To understand the
terminology you must be familiar with the simple Bohr
theory of atomic structure in which the electrons are
circling the nucleus in specific shells. (The electrons stay
in their shells rather than spiral into the nucleus because
of the constraints imposed by quantum theory.)
</p>
<p>Aside: For historical reasons, the innermost elec-
tron shell is called the K shell and the next inner-
most is the L shell, the next the M, and so on, as
used in Figure 4.2. All the shells (except the K shell)
may themselves have subshells (e.g., L1, L2, etc.).
We name the characteristic X-rays in terms of the
shell being filled and the shell from which the elec-
tron comes. (The K, L, M, etc., terminology was
first introduced by Charles Barkla, an early X-ray
spectroscopist and has nothing to do with Royal

</p>
<p>occurs. The beam electron loses energy but continues on through the

<p>Dutch Airlines. The reason Barkla chose K as the
first shell may have been because he wasn&rsquo;t sure if
he&rsquo;d need a J shell but knew he&rsquo;d need an L shell!)
</p>
<p>Remember that the difference between the two shell
energies equals the energy of the characteristic X-ray.
Thus, if we fill a K-shell hole from the L shell we get a
Ka X-ray, but if we fill it from the M shell we get a Kb
X-ray. If the hole is in the L shell andwe fill it from theM
shell we get an La X-ray, and if we fill it from the N shell
we get an Lb X-ray. The notation is in fact much more
</p>
<p>complex because we differentiate the aX-rays in terms of
a1 and a2 depending on which subshell of the outer
shell the electron falls from to fill the hole. The a1 X-ray
is from the outermost subshell (e.g., the LIII or MV), the
a2 from the next innermost (the LII orMIV). Tomake this
a bit clearer you can look at the diagram in Figure 4.3,
although it may in fact confuse you more since it&rsquo;s not at
all obvious why, with all these possible electron transi-
tions, only a small fraction generates sufficient X-rays for
us to use. Suffice it to say that X-ray physics is an arcane
discipline. Fortunately, for X-ray detection in the TEM

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to worry about such details because, as
you&rsquo;ll see later, the detectors we use can&rsquo;t usually discrim-
inate between the X-rays from different subshells,
except at the highest X-ray energies, so K, L, and M
and a and b are about all you&rsquo;ll need to remember.
</p>
<p>X-ray lines, families, and weights: Often we refer to
specific characteristic X-rays as &lsquo;lines&rsquo; because they ori-
ginally appeared as lines on photographic plates from
early spectrometers. Each characteristic X-ray line has
a specific wavelength or energy. Groups of lines that
arise from transitions to a specific K, L, or M shell are
often called &lsquo;families.&rsquo; Muchmore detail can be found in
books on X-rays and X-ray spectrometry, and we&rsquo;ll tell
you more in Chapter 34.
</p>
<p>Not all electron transitions are equally probable
(think of those cross sections again) and this is taken
into account by the different &lsquo;weights&rsquo; (i.e., relative
intensity compared with the most intense line) of the
X-ray lines that are given in Table 4.1. These weights are
only important within a given K, L, or M family and do
not relate families (e.g., K to L), because experimental
conditions affect X-ray generation in each family differ-
ently. In X-ray analysis in the TEMwe only use themost
intense lines, usually the a lines (or, if the spectrometer
can&rsquo;t resolve them, both a and b lines). This will become
more obvious when you&rsquo;ve learned about X-ray quali-
tative analysis in Chapter 34.
</p>
<p>Critical ionization energy: The electron beam has to
transfer an amount of energy greater than a certain
value to the inner-shell electron in order to ionize the
atom. This energy is called the critical ionization energy
(Ec). If we want to generate a useful number of X-rays,
then the beam energy E0 must be significantly greater
than Ec. The value of Ec increases as the electrons are
more tightly bound to the nucleus so, for a given ele-
ment, the innermost shell (K) has a higher Ec than the
next (L) shell, and so on. Atoms with higher Z have
more protons binding the core electrons to the nucleus
and, therefore, have a higher Ec. You can see this effect
if you go and look at an X-ray spectrum, e.g., in Figure
1.4A (or one ofmany others throughout Part 4) in which
</p>
<p>the energy of the X-ray peaks increases with increasing
atomic number. Since there&rsquo;s a lot of shells and a lot of
atoms, the list of critical ionization energies is long, as
you&rsquo;ll find out if you consult any X-ray textbook. A
similar list is also invaluable in EELS since the Ec
obviously corresponds to a critical amount of energy
lost by a beam electron and thus gives rise to peaks
(usually called edges) in the energy-loss spectrum. As
we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 39, EELS edges, like characteristic
X-ray peaks, can also be used to identify uniquely the
presence of a particular element in the specimen.
</p>
<p>The cross section for ionization (s): It is shown in
Figure 4.1 for K- and L-shell electrons. It is not a strong
function of energy and has a relatively large value, and
so we expect to see X-rays generated in all TEMs. In
low-voltage SEMs we have to worry about another
parameter called the overvoltage, U, which is the ratio
of the beam energy E0 to the ionization energy Ec. The
cross section varies withU as shown in Figure 4.4. What
this figure tells you is that if E0 is close to Ec then there
isn&rsquo;t much chance of ionization occurring. However, in
the TEM E0 is � 100 keV and Ec is generally &lt; 20 keV
so U is usually &gt; 5. Therefore, X-ray generation is
expected and the cross section is pretty constant with
energy. Despite this relatively simple behavior, there is
considerable uncertainty about the absolute value of the
ionization cross sections because few reliable experi-
mental measurements have beenmade at TEMvoltages.
Most models are variations on the original expression
given by Bethe (1930) which describes the total (not the
differential) ionization cross section as

<p>where the only new terms are ns, which is the number
of electrons in the ionized subshell, and bs and cs, which
are constants for that shell. We are not particularly
concerned with any angular variation in the ionization
process. The differential form of the Bethe expression

<p>This modified Bethe cross section can bemanipulated to
fit almost any X-ray data just by altering bs and cs,
although such parameterization is not always justified.
Several cross section models have been developed, all
of which are modifications to Bethe&rsquo;s approach (e.g.,
Newbury 1986, Goldstein et al. 1986). A good source of
cross section data can be found on the NIST Web site
(URL #1).
</p>
<p>The X-ray energy/wavelength: X-rays are electro-
magnetic radiation and so we usually think of them of
as waves with a specific wavelength l. But, just like
electrons, X-rays can show particle-like characteristics
and then we describe them as photons with a specific
energy such as EK or EL, where the subscript refers to
the shell from which the core electron was ejected.
</p>
<p>There is a similar inverse relationship between the
X-ray wavelength and its energy, as we saw for electrons
back in Chapter 1. However, there are a couple of
important differences which you must remember.
</p>
<p>&amp; An X-ray is a photon of electromagnetic energy, so
the concepts of rest mass and momentum embodied
in the electron energy are irrelevant; an X-ray has no
mass.
</p>
<p>&amp; X-rays, like all electromagnetic radiation, travel at
the speed of light (c) in vacuum and consequently
we don&rsquo;t have to make increasing relativistic correc-
tions as their energy increases. So the quantized
X-ray energy is just hn where h is Planck&rsquo;s constant
and n is the frequency and in order to express this
energy in eV we equate it to E, where E is the X-ray
energy.
</p>
<p>Thus
</p>
<p>E &frac14; hn &frac14;
hc
</p>
<p>l
(4:3)
</p>
<p>Now since h and c are constants we can substitute
values with appropriate units into the equation and find
that the X-ray wavelength is given by
</p>
<p>l &frac14;
1:24
</p>
<p>E
(4:4)
</p>
<p>where l is in nm and E in keV. This expression is very
similar to the expression for the uncorrected electron
wavelength (1.22/E1/2) where E is the electron energy
in eV (not keV) that we gave back in Chapter 1. You can
easily confuse the two, so beware!
</p>
<p>Because the X-ray energy depends on the difference
in the inner-shell energies and these differences increase
monotonically with Z, we can use the detection of a
characteristic X-ray with a specific energy as an unam-
biguous sign of the presence of an element in the speci-
men (although it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that that
element is intrinsic to your specimen, as we&rsquo;ll see in
Chapter 33). The concept of the atomic number (Z) of
the specimen and its relationship to the X-ray energy/
wavelength was reported by the brilliant young physi-
cist, HGJ Moseley. Soon after his discovery, Moseley
volunteered for the British army and, despite his talents,
was dispatched to the trenches of Gallipoli in 1915
where he was promptly killed before he could be nomi-
nated for the Nobel Prize, which would undoubtedly
have been his. He is remembered by Moseley&rsquo;s law
which states
</p>
<p>l &frac14;
B
</p>
<p>Z� C&eth; &THORN;2
(4:5)
</p>
<p>where B and C are constants. So we can also generate a
list of X-ray energies which are associated with each
atomic transition. As with Ec the complete list is
enormous and given in Bearden&rsquo;s tables. More compact
lists are given in the software attached to the XEDS
system on your TEM or in handy &lsquo;slide rules&rsquo; by the
manufacturers of X-ray spectrometers, in textbooks,
review articles, or on trusted Web sites such as NIST
(URL #2) or NPL (URL #3).
</p>
<p>If you compare the value of Ec and the relevant
characteristic X-ray energy you&rsquo;ll see that they are not
quite identical. The X-ray energy, EK or EL, is invari-
ably less than Ec. Table 4.2 lists a comparison of critical
ionization energies and corresponding X-ray energies
for a range of elements. Note how the differences in
energy increase with increasing Z. The differences arise
because the atom doesn&rsquo;t return completely to ground
state when the X-ray is emitted. If the electron that fills
the hole in the ionized inner shell comes from an outer
shell then this process will leave a hole in that outer shell.
</p>
<p>SPEED
Don&rsquo;t confuse electromagnetic waves (e.g., X-rays),
which always travel at the speed of light, with elec-
tron waves whose speed depends on their energy.
</p>
<p>58 ....................................................................................................................................... INELAST IC SCATTER ING AND BEAM DAMAGE</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This hole must also be filled by another electron with
perhaps the emission of another X-ray (much more
likely as Z increases) and so on until eventually a free
electron from the conduction or valence band fills the
last hole in the outermost core shell.
</p>
<p>An example: A Cu K-shell electron requires
8.993 keV of energy for ionization (Ec =
8.993 keV). One possible sequence by which this
extra energy within the atom is lost is first by the
creation of a Cu Ka X-ray (8.048 keV), then an La
X-ray (0.930 keV). These X-ray energies total
8.978 keV and the remaining few eV could come
from the hole in the M shell being filled from the
conduction band with the emission of a photon or
the generation of phonons (see below).
</p>
<p>The possible variations are enormous and affected
by such events as Coster-Kronig transitions, in which
the atomic shells rearrange their energies after the elec-
tron transition. The situation is further complicated if
the ionized atom is bound to a different atom, in which
case the energy of the X-ray can be shifted slightly (&lt;�5
eV). Such detail is well beyond what you need to know
now but a textbook on X-ray spectrometry will give you
more, if you so wish.
</p>
<p>Fluorescence yield: Remember that an ionized
atom does not have to lose energy by giving off a char-
acteristic X-ray but can emit an Auger electron instead.
The probability of X-ray versus Auger emission is
described by the fluorescence yield, o, which is the
ratio of X-ray emissions to inner-shell ionizations. The
fluorescence yield is a strong function of atomic number
as shown in Figure 4.5, decreasing at a rate proportional
to Z4 as Z decreases. One common expression for o
gives
</p>
<p>o &frac14;
Z4
</p>
<p>a&thorn; Z4
(4:6)
</p>
<p>where a � 106 for the K shell. While an approximation,
this equation still describes a formidable dependence on
Z. For carbon (Z=6),o is� 10�3 and for Ge (Z=32),
o is � 0.5. So you have to ionize 1000 carbon atoms
before you get a single C Ka X-ray but only two ioniza-
tions are needed to produce a Ge X-ray. So if you ionize
low-Z atoms, the chances are you won&rsquo;t see an X-ray
and therefore XEDS is not the best way to analyze light
elements; you should use EELS (see Part 4) because we
can always detect the energy-loss electron whether or
not it has generated an X-ray. If you want to knowmore
about the chances of generating X-rays in your micro-
scope then the database by Hubbell et al. is a good
source.

<p>4.2.B Bremsstrahlung X-rays
</p>
<p>If the electrons in the beam penetrate completely
through the electron shells they can interact inelastically
with the nucleus. If the electron interacts with the Cou-
lomb (charge) field of the nucleus, it can suffer a sub-
stantial change in momentum and during this process it
may emit an X-ray. Since the electron can suffer any
amount of energy loss, depending on the strength of its
interaction, then these X-rays can have any energy up to
the beam energy. Such X-rays are known by their origi-
nal German name of bremsstrahlungwhich can be trans-
lated as &lsquo;braking radiation.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>The likelihood of bremsstrahlung creation is usually
described by the cross section derived by Kramers. This
expression is often used for thin TEM specimens,
although it was originally derived for bulk samples. It is
common to use the Kramers cross section to predict the
bremsstrahlung production rather than the probability of
interaction. The approximate expression used is
</p>
<p>N E&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
KZ E0 � E&THORN;&eth;
</p>
<p>E
(4:7)
</p>
<p>whereN(E) is the number of bremsstrahlung photons of
energy E (i.e., the intensity) produced by electrons of
energy E0, K is Kramers&rsquo; constant, and Z is the atomic
number of the ionized atom. This relationship predicts
that it is far more likely that the interaction causes a
small loss of energy and exceedingly rare that the elec-
tron loses all its energy in one deceleration at the
nucleus. So the bremsstrahlung intensity as a function
of energy is shown in Figure 4.6. In contrast to the
</p>
<p>isotropic emission of the characteristic X-rays, the
bremsstrahlung is highly anisotropic, showing strong
forward scattering which increases as E0 increases.
This anisotropy is very useful since it allows us to design
spectrometers that collect many more useful charac-
teristic X-rays than relatively useless bremsstrahlung
X-rays.
</p>
<p>The bremsstrahlung has a continuous energy
spectrum on which the characteristic X-rays that we
just talked about are superimposed, as also shown
schematically in Figure 4.6 and experimentally in the
spectrum back in Figure 1.4. Since the characteristic X-
rays have a narrow energy range, they appear as
sharp peaks in the spectrum centered at specific
energies, indicated by computer-generated lines on
the display (now another reason to call them
&lsquo;lines&rsquo;). The bremsstrahlung intensity depends on
the average Z of the specimen and this is useful to
biologists or polymer scientists who are interested in
this aspect of their specimens. But materials scien-
tists generally dismiss the bremsstrahlung as a signal,
which only succeeds in obscuring characteristic lines.
We&rsquo;ll come back to the X-ray spectrum in more
detail in Chapters 32&ndash;36.
</p>
<p>4.3 SECONDARY-ELECTRON EMISSION
</p>
<p>Secondary electrons (SEs) are electrons within the speci-
men that are ejected by the beam electron.
</p>
<p>&amp; If the electrons are in the conduction or valence
bands then it doesn&rsquo;t take much energy to eject
them and they typically have energies &lt;� 50 eV.
</p>
<p>&amp; If the electrons are ejected from an inner shell by the
energy released when an ionized atom returns to the
ground state, then these SEs are called Auger elec-
trons. The process is often termed a non-radiative
transition (since no X-ray emerges from the atom)
and the energy undergoes an &lsquo;internal conversion&rsquo;
(which is not quite a religious experience).
</p>
<p>Historically, SEs were usually considered only in
relation to the SEM where they are used to form
(often stunning) images which are sensitive to surface
topology.We&rsquo;ll now discuss each of these SE signals and
their relative importance in the TEM.
</p>
<p>4.3.A Secondary Electrons
</p>
<p>SEs are ejected from the conduction or valence bands of
the atoms in the specimen. The actual emission process
can be quite complex and no simple cross section model
covers all production mechanisms. The data in Figure
4.1 indicate that SE emission is a far less likely process
than all the other inelastic processes we&rsquo;ve discussed, but
enough are generated for them to be useful in the TEM.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Usually, SEs are assumed to be free electrons, i.e., they
are not associated with a specific atom and so they
contain no specific elemental information. Because
SEs are weak they can only escape if they are near the
specimen surface. So we use them in SEMs for forming
images of the specimen surface. While SEs are the
standard signal used in SEMs, they are also used in
STEMs where they can provide very high resolution,
topographic images of the specimen surface. We&rsquo;ll dis-
cuss ways to detect SEs in Chapter 7 andwe&rsquo;ll talk about
the images themselves in Chapter 29.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll discuss several reasons for the improved (SE)
resolution in STEM in Chapter 29. However, recent
developments in high-resolution field-emission gun
(FEG) SEMs have produced SE image resolution &lt;0.5
nm (close to surface atom resolution) at 30 kV. (We
discuss FEGs in the next chapter.) A STEM at 100 kV
can offer similar or better resolution even without an
FEG, so the SEs are very useful. Aberration correction
in STEM naturally brings about even higher-resolution
SE images, close to the atomic level.
</p>
<p>The number of SEs does depend on energy; it rises
to a maximum at about 5 eV and drops close to zero
with energies &gt;�50 eV. (You should know that, on
rare occasions, strongly bound inner-shell electrons
can be ejected with energies up to about 50% of the
beam energy. Such fast SEs are generally ignored
because they do not seem to limit the resolution of
XEDS in the TEM.) The SE yield (number of SEs/
incident-beam electron) is generally regarded as being
independent of E0; if there is any Z dependence (which
is still a matter of some debate) then it is very small.
The angular distribution of emitted SEs is not impor-
tant since the detector uses a strong field to gather SEs
emerging from the surface at any angle. But the number
of SEs increases with specimen tilt because SEs escape
more easily as the surface is tilted parallel to the beam.
This behavior is a critical aspect of SE emission
because it mimics Lambert&rsquo;s cosine law of visible-
light reflection, accounting for the great similarity
between SE images of rough specimens and the every-
day, reflected-light images we are accustomed to seeing
with our eyes.
</p>
<p>4.3.B Auger Electrons
</p>
<p>Remember we said at the start of this chapter that the
emission of Auger electrons is an alternative to X-ray
emission as an ionized atom returns to its ground state.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.7 shows how such an atom ejects an outer-shell
(Auger) electron; it&rsquo;s instructive to compare with Figure
4.2 for X-ray emission. The ejected electron has an
energy given by the difference between the original exci-
tation energy (Ec) and the binding energy of the outer
shell from which the electron was ejected. This explains
the rather complex nomenclature used to describe each
Auger electron (see the caption to Figure 4.7). So the
Auger electron has a characteristic energy that is depen-
dent on the electronic structure of the ionized atom and
is almost identical to the energy of the alternative, char-
acteristic X-ray.
</p>
<p>Because they have such low energies, the Auger
electrons that do escape come from very close to the
specimen surface. They contain chemical information
and consequently AES is a recognized surface-chemis-
try technique. Because of the similarity in energy bet-
ween Auger electrons and characteristic X-rays, you
might ask, why is light-element X-ray analysis in the
TEM not just a surface technique? What you have to

SE images in a STEM have much better resolution
than SE images in the (relatively) low-kV SEMs.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>remember is that characteristic X-rays are much less
strongly absorbed in the specimen than electrons of
similar energy. So most X-rays generated in a thin
TEM specimen can escape and be detected. (So it&rsquo;s
all to do with the cross sections for interaction in the
first place.)
</p>
<p>Because Auger emission is a surface phenomenon,
the state of the specimen surface is paramount.
Oxidation or contamination will prevent interpretable
Auger analysis of the true surface chemistry and so we
only carry out AES in a UHV system. As a result, the
Auger signal has traditionally been ignored by electron
microscopists and confined to the realm of surface
chemistry, along with such techniques as ESCA and
SIMS. However, as TEMs are being built with better
vacuums and UHV STEMs become more common, the
Auger signal may receive more interest. Unfortunately,
it is not simple to attach an Auger system to a STEM
unless you build a dedicated instrument in which rou-
tine AEM is difficult, so such studies are still very rare.
</p>
<p>4.4 ELECTRON-HOLE PAIRS AND
CATHODOLUMINESCENCE (CL)
</p>
<p>These two signals are closely related. We&rsquo;ll see in Chap-
ter 7 that one way to detect electrons is to use a semi-
conductor that creates electron-hole pairs when hit by
high-energy electrons. So if your specimen happens to
be a direct-gap semiconductor then electron-hole pairs
will be generated inside it.
</p>
<p>Cathodoluminescence is explained schematically in
Figure 4.8. The emitted photon has a frequency (i.e.,
color) equal to the energy of the gap (EG) divided by
Planck&rsquo;s constant (h). If the band gap varies for some
reason, there will be a spectrum of light given off or the
color of the light will vary depending on what part of the
specimen is being observed. So CL spectroscopy has
applications in the study of semiconductors and impur-
ity effects therein. While the spatial resolution of CL is
not down to the nanometer level like X-rays or second-
ary electrons, it is still well within the nano-scale range,
typically defined as &lt;100 nm.
</p>
<p>Now if you apply a bias to your specimen or if it
happens to be a p-n junction or a Schottky-barrier
diode, then the electrons and holes can be separated
by the internal bias. You can pick up this charge if
you ground the specimen through a picoammeter. In
this situation, your specimen is acting as its own
detector! The current you then detect is sometimes
called the electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) sig-
nal. If you detect this signal and use it to form an
image then you are doing charge-collection micro-
scopy (CCM).
</p>
<p>The CL and CCM modes of operation are stan-
dard methods of characterizing bulk samples in the
SEM. In principle, there is nothing to prevent us doing
the same in a STEM, and a few people have built
dedicated instruments, but generally the space avail-
able in the TEM stage limits the efficiency of signal
collection. This may improve with Cs correction, but,
in general, these two techniques are rare and mainly
limited to studies of semiconductors (e.g., Boyall et al.)
although some minerals also exhibit CL. We&rsquo;ll describe
</p>
<p>CATHODOLUMINESCENCE
Electrons and holes will recombine and in doing so
give off light; this process is referred to as CL.
</p>
<p>AUGER
The Auger process is favored in atoms having small
binding energies, i.e., the lighter elements. Typical
Auger electron energies are in the range of a few
hundred eV to a few keV and are strongly absorbed
within the specimen.

in Chapter 29. Just remember that CL and CCM
are potentially powerful, but highly specialized,
techniques.
</p>
<p>4.5 PLASMONS AND PHONONS
</p>
<p>We can link these two phenomena because they are both
examples of what we call collective oscillations.
</p>
<p>We can consider plasmons as analogous to sound
waves, since they are longitudinal oscillations of the
free-electron gas, which create regions of varying elec-
tron density as shown schematically in Figure 4.9. These
oscillations are damped out in less than a femtosecond
and the wave is localized to &lt;10 nm. If you go back to
Figure 4.1, you&rsquo;ll see that the plasmon process has the
largest cross section so it&rsquo;s by far the most common
inelastic interaction occurring in materials and, as we&rsquo;ll
see in Chapter 38, plasmon peaks are strong features of
EEL spectra. Plasmons can occur in any material with
weakly bound or free electrons, but they occur predom-
inantly in metals, particularly ones like aluminum
which have a large Fermi surface and, therefore, a
high free-electron density. The plasmon oscillation is
quantized and the mean free path for plasmon excita-
tion is �100 nm. As we&rsquo;ll also see in Section 38.3.C this
</p>
<p>quantization makes the number of plasmon excitations
a useful way to measure your specimen thickness. Also,
the plasmon energy is a function of the free-electron
density and this changes with composition (see Chapter
38 also), so the plasmon excitation is chemically depen-
dent, although we rarely use it for elemental analysis.
</p>
<p>The differential cross section for plasmon excitation
has a general Lorenztian form

<p>where a0 is the Bohr radius, y is the scattering angle, and
yE is the so-called characteristic scattering angle given by
EP/2E0 (which is always going to be small given the large
value of E0 in TEMs). Since EP, the plasmon energy, is
almost fixed (�15&ndash;25 eV), the cross section is a strong
function of y, dropping rapidly to zero at values much
above 10 mrads, indicating once again the strong for-
ward scattering of such energy-loss electrons.
</p>
<p>When a high-energy electron strikes an atom in the
specimen, the lattice shakes, just like hitting a chain-
link fence with a stick. This process occurs because, as
shown in Figure 4.10, all the atoms are linked together
elastically. Phonons can also be generated by other
inelastic processes occurring within the atom; for exam-
ple, the energy of Auger or X-ray emission or an inter-
band transition is sometimes converted internally to
lattice vibrations. Any shaking of the atoms is equiva-
lent to heating up the specimen and the net result of all
phonons is that the specimen gets warmer. As we will
see, this is particularly damaging to some specimens.
</p>
<p>The incident electron can generate phonons in any
solid specimen, even amorphous ones in which there is
no periodic crystal structure. Typically, a phonon vibra-
tion causes a very small energy loss of &lt; 0.1 eV but the
phonon-loss electrons are scattered out to quite large
angles (5&ndash;15 mrads), and these electrons account for the
diffuse background intensity present between the Bragg
intensity maxima in DPs. Phonon-scattered electrons
carry no useful chemical information nor do they carry
contrast useful to the microscopist.
</p>
<p>It is not important to know the phonon-scattering
cross section exactly, but it is useful to remember that
</p>

</p>
<p>PLASMONS AND PHONONS
Plasmons are collective oscillations of free electrons
that occur when a beam electron interacts with the
free electron &lsquo;gas.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Phonons are collective oscillations of atoms in a
solid that arise when the atomic lattice is struck by a
beam electron.

<p>4 .5 PLASMONS AND PHONONS .................................................................................................................................................................. 63</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>phonon scattering increases with Z with a dependence
� Z3/2, which is a somewhat weaker dependence than
for true elastic scattering. Also, because of the effect of
temperature on atomic vibration, phonon scattering
increases as the temperature rises. This accounts for
the increase in thermal-diffuse scattering with tempera-
ture and is themajor reasonwhywe cool specimens if we
want to obtain good, sharp DPs. The mean free path for
phonon scattering at room temperature varies from a
couple of nm for Au up to about 350 nm for Al, and at
liquid-He temperatures these values increase � 2&ndash;3X.
</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t use either plasmons or phonons directly to
form images (although in principle this is possible), but
we do detect the electrons that caused them, and we&rsquo;ll
discuss the (rather limited) uses of plasmon energy-loss
electrons in Chapter 38.
</p>
<p>There are other inelastic processes that can occur as
the beam electron traverses the specimen, such as inter-
band and intra-band transitions within the valence or
conduction bands. The bonding between the atoms and
local atomic arrangements within the specimen can also
affect many of the inelastic events that we have
described in ways that we can both predict and discern.
Other electronic features such as the band gap can
affect the possibility of certain inelastic interactions
occurring. In principle, any atomic or electronic char-
acteristic of your particular specimen that reduces the
energy of a beam electron during its passage through
the specimen can be detected, measured, and perhaps
quantified and simulated. These signals can all be used
to form images containing information which comple-
ments that contained in the elastic-electron (mainly
diffraction-contrast) images that constitute traditional
TEM studies of materials. We&rsquo;ll give you plenty of exam-
ples of such inelastic images in Part 4.
</p>
<p>4.6 BEAM DAMAGE
</p>
<p>The inelastic collisions that give us all the useful signals
we&rsquo;ve just discussed bring with them an unfortunate side
effect, electron-beam damage. We are often less precise
and call this phenomenon radiation damage. The
damage, which affects the structure and/or the chemistry
of the specimen, depends, in some form or other, on the
incident-beam energy. Certainmaterials aremore suscep-
tible than others but, in the end, you can damage virtually
anything that you put into the TEM, particularly now
that aberration correction permits even more electron
current to be focused into even smaller beams. Therefore,
damage represents a real physical limit on what the TEM
can do andmay be regarded as the microscopists&rsquo; analog
of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in that the very
act of observing your specimen can change it.
</p>
<p>On the other hand,we can sometimes use beamdamage
to aid certain in-situ transformations that are speeded up
by the damage process or we can use electron damage to
emulate other forms of radiation damage. Generally, how-
ever, beam damage must be considered undesirable.
</p>
<p>Damage takes one of three principal forms
</p>
<p>&amp; Radiolysis: Inelastic scattering (mainly electron-
electron interactions such as ionization) breaks the
chemical bonds of certainmaterials such as polymers
and alkali halides.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 4.10. An illustration of the crystal lattice as a group of atoms
</p>
<p>linked elastically by springs. The bonds vibrate when struck by a high-
</p>
<p>energy electron creating lattice oscillations or phonons and these vibra-
</p>
<p>tions are equivalent to heating the specimen.
</p>
<p>PHONONS
These oscillations involve all the atoms in the crystal
lattice vibrating collectively. Such vibrations are
equivalent to specimen heating. You can reduce the
number of phonons by cooling your specimen.
</p>
<p>DAMAGE
Once its structure or chemistry is changed, your thin
specimen is not representative of its parent material
and interpreting any of your TEM images, DPs or
spectra becomes more difficult.
</p>
<p>64 ....................................................................................................................................... INELAST IC SCATTER ING AND BEAM DAMAGE</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Knock-on damage or sputtering:Knock-on damage is
the displacement of atoms from the crystal lattice
and creates point defects. If atoms are ejected from
the specimen surface we call it sputtering. These
processes are ubiquitous if the beam energy (E0) is
high enough.
</p>
<p>&amp; Heating: Phonons heat your specimen and heat is a
major source of damage to polymers and biological
tissue.
</p>
<p>We will see that, paradoxically, radiolysis is reduced
at higher E0 while knock-on damage is increased; so
there is sometimes no way around the damage problem;
you can get it at all energies. Cooling your specimen
can obviously help if it is likely to be damaged by
heating.
</p>
<p>All these processes occur in the voltage range avail-
able in commercial TEMs and so you must be aware of
the dangers. The actual processes can be very compli-
cated and are also specimen-specific, so we could get
bogged down in an enormous amount of detail. What
we&rsquo;ll do, however, is describe the fundamental processes
in different materials, explain how you can determine if
your specimen is being damaged and describe how you
can minimize or eliminate the problem.
</p>
<p>If you find you need to know more about radiation
damage, the text by Jenkins and Kirk is the place to
start. But we should also note upfront that whole areas
of TEM such as in-situ studies and environmental TEM
actually take advantage of radiation damage to enhance
particular reactions.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start our brief overview of damage in different
kinds of TEM specimens by explaining the terms we use
to measure damage.
</p>
<p>4.6.A Electron Dose
</p>
<p>In the TEM we define the electron dose as the charge
density (C/m2) hitting the specimen. It is easy to convert
this to the number of electrons/unit area (usually e/nm2)
knowing that e=1.6� 10�19 C. This term is not the
same as for radiation effects on the human body, for
which we define dose as the energy absorbed per unit
volume. This human dose is defined by the Gray (Gy)
which is the absorption of 1 J of ionizing radiation/kg of
material and 1 Gy = 100 rads (in pre-SI units). If we
convert the incident electron dose to an absorbed dose it
can easily be shown that typical electron exposures
inside the TEM are well above the lethal limit for
human tissue and early microscopists occasionally
found this out to their cost (although we hasten to
add that, to our knowledge, while no deaths occurred,
digits were apparently lost). While this fact is another
warning about the dangers inherent in TEM it is more
pertinent as a reminder to you that we put an enormous
amount of energy into our specimens. This latter point is
</p>
<p>well illustrated if you calculate the total power input
into the specimen, as we do in the next chapter. Fortu-
nately, such a small fraction of the beam energy is
transferred to a thin specimen that most specimens sur-
vive this, otherwise hostile, environment.
</p>
<p>4.6.B Specimen Heating
</p>
<p>Specimen heating is difficult to measure experimentally
because of the many variables that can affect the result,
such as the thermal conductivity, thickness, and surface
condition of the specimen as well as the beam size,
energy, and current. Hobbs has calculated the effects
of beam current and thermal conductivity on the speci-
men temperature, as shown in Figure 4.11. From these
results we can say that, as a rule for metals and other
good conductors, beam heating is negligible under stan-
dard TEM conditions but, for insulators, it can be quite
substantial. To minimize heating, follow the instruc-
tions given at the end of the next section.
</p>
<p>You will often hear questions about beam heating
from people who don&rsquo;t use TEM.
</p>
<p>&amp; If thermal conduction is very high, heating is
negligible.
</p>
<p>&amp; If thermal conduction is poor, heating can be quite
substantial.
</p>
<p>So, beam heating for metals is usually minimal but
small ceramic particles may be heated by the beam to
temperatures of�17008C. If a good thermal conductor is

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>beam heating can occur. Most electrons go through a
thin specimen and lose very little energy, as we&rsquo;ll see in
our discussion of EELS.
</p>
<p>4.6.C Beam Damage in Polymers
</p>
<p>Polymers are particularly sensitive to the electron-electron
interactions since these can break chemical bonds creating
new structures; we call this process radiolysis.
</p>
<p>&amp; Electrons can cause the main polymer chain to
break, thus changing its basic structure.
</p>
<p>&amp; Electrons can cause side groups to break off, leaving
reactive free radicals which may crosslink to form a
new structure.
</p>
<p>Breaking a polymer chain this way is known as scis-
sion. Generally, polymers show a tendency either to
break down or to crosslink under electron irradiation.
In the former case, the polymer will continue to lose
mass while, in the latter, the polymer eventually
becomes mainly carbon. Mass loss can sometimes be
measured directly by EELS in the TEM and it can also
manifest itself as a major dimensional change in your
specimen because, ultimately, a hole appears in the
damaged area; if you&rsquo;re watching carefully you&rsquo;ll see
that the image contrast will usually change before the
hole appears!
</p>
<p>If your polymer specimen was originally crystal-
line, then radiation damage results in a loss of crys-
tallinity, which you can measure quantitatively from
the loss of diffraction contrast in the image or the
loss of sharp peaks in the DP (which are gradually
replaced with diffuse scattered intensity characteris-
tic of amorphous structures (go back and look at
Figure 2.13A). Sometimes you can preserve the crys-
tal structure by staining with a heavy metal such as
Pb or U. However, whenever you stain your speci-
men you affect its structure and change the chemis-
try, so this isn&rsquo;t ideal.
</p>
<p>There are several methods you can use to minimize
beam damage in polymers
</p>
<p>&amp; Use low-dose imaging techniques (see Chapter 31).
&amp; Cool the specimen to liquid N2 temperatures or
lower T, if possible.
</p>
<p>&amp; Coat the specimen with a conducting metal film.
&amp; Use STEM imaging (Section 22.3).
&amp; Do all of the above, if necessary.
</p>
<p>In addition to these practical steps, any contribution
to damage from beam heating is generally minimized by
reducing the cross section for inelastic scatter, i.e., by
using the highest available voltage. So HVEMs are
better for the study of heat-sensitive materials. If the
specimen is thinner than the mean free path for inelastic
</p>
<p>interaction then less energy is transferred to the speci-
men and the result is less damage due to heating effects.
</p>
<p>4.6.D Beam Damage in Covalent and Ionic
Crystals
</p>
<p>In covalent and ionic materials such as ceramics and
minerals, radiolysis can change the specimen chemistry
and possibly its structure through a series of reactions
driven by the electron beam. The inelastic interaction
primarily responsible for radiolysis is the interband
transition, similar to that which causes CL. The transi-
tion of a mobile, valence-band electron to the conduc-
tion band leaves a hole in the original energy level.
Rather than emitting a photon, the electrons and
holes may partially recombine via an intermediate,
metastable state called an exciton which, through a
rather complicated sequence of events, can create an
anion vacancy and a cation interstitial. Crystalline
quartz (although a very hard material) can be amor-
phized by a similar process. Often radiolysis can result
in the formation of new compounds, which can be
identified in situ as they form, by electron diffraction
and AEM. The formation of Ag from Ag halides in a
photographic emulsion is a (rare) example of useful
radiolysis. So, somewhat paradoxically, if we use
photographic film we depend on radiation damage to
record the information we generate in our TEMs (more
about this in Chapter 7).
</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t stop radiolysis simply by cooling or coating
our specimen, since it isn&rsquo;t affected by heat-transfer
considerations. The best way is to lower the cross sec-
tion for the initiating electron-electron interactions and
we can do this by using higher voltages and thinner
specimens (thinner is better again). Nevertheless, radi-
olysis remains a major limitation in the TEM when
looking at certain ceramics and minerals and most
polymers.
</p>
<p>4.6.E Beam Damage in Metals
</p>
<p>The primaryway thatmetals are damaged is by knock-on
or displacement/sputtering damage. This process occurs
by the direct transfer of the beam energy to atoms in the
solid, knocking them out of their atomic site and creating
a combination vacancy and interstitial (or Frenkel pair).
For an atom to be kicked out of its very comfortable and
stable crystal lattice site, the beam electron has to pene-
trate close to the nucleus and be effectively stopped in its
tracks by the Coulombic attraction, thus transferring
most, if not all, of its energy to the atom.
</p>
<p>KNOCK-ON DAMAGE
It is directly related to the incident beam energy.

<p>How strongly the atoms are bonded to their neigh-
bors will also be a factor. A simple expression given by
Hobbs for the displacement energy Ed allows us to
determine the threshold energy (Et) for displacement
of atoms of atomic weight A

</p>

(4:9)
</p>
<p>where Et is in MeV and Ed is in eV. Ed is typically in the
range from 5 to 50 eV, but varies with bonding type. If
you can transfer more than the threshold energy to an
atom then you will displace it from its site. This concept
is summarized in Figure 4.12. So, for example, at
400 keV, &gt; 80 eV can be transferred to a carbon atom,
about 45 eV can be transferred to anAl atom, and about
25 eV to a Ti atom. If we assume an average displace-
ment energy of� 25 eV then it is quite evident that if you
have a 400-kV intermediate voltage TEM, you can dis-
place any atom with an atomic weight below about Ti
</p>
<p>(unless it happens to be bonded so that Ed is much
greater than the typical value in Figure 4.12). If you&rsquo;re
using an HVEM with beam energies of 1 MeV or more
you will invariably cause displacement damage, except
perhaps in the heaviest elements. The only way to avoid
displacement damage is to operate below threshold and
you should determine this energy experimentally given
the very approximate nature of Figure 4.12.
</p>
<p>How can you identify displacement damage? The
only sure way is to record images of the same area before
and after radiation and compare the contrast under the
same imaging conditions. Knock-on damage often
manifests itself as small vacancy clusters which appear
as black-white lobe contrast or dot contrast, as we
showed back in Figure 1.8. Sometimes damage is dis-
cernible as dislocation loops and stacking fault tetrahe-
dra caused by the agglomeration of vacancies. Such
crystal defects could of course be easily confused with
defects that are intrinsic to the material rather than
introduced by the act of observing the materials in the
TEM.Displacement damage can also occur in polymers

<p>andminerals, of course. The problem here is that we just
suggested going to higher voltages as one way of mini-
mizing thermal effects and radiolysis and in doing so, we
may well induce knock-on damage. So depending on
your material, there may in fact be no way to avoid
damaging your specimen in one way or another except,
perhaps, by becoming a metallurgist.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the only bright side to displacement damage
is that we can study it for its own sake. It can be argued,
though by no means conclusively, that electron-beam
damage in materials can be equivalent to neutron
damage, such as that occurring in nuclear reactors. A
general rule of thumb is that a few minutes&rsquo; exposure in
an HVEM is equivalent in terms of damage to many
years in a nuclear reactor and so accelerated studies of
materials degradation in reactor environments were pos-
sible. With this justification, an enormous amount of
work was carried out in the 1960s when nuclear power
was in vogue. ThreeMile Island and Chernobyl seriously
reduced the number of such studies but there are many
reviews extant in the older literature and an occasional
more modern reference. Given that the current political
climate (!) is more favorable toward nuclear energy than
for some decades, it is not unreasonable to suspect that
beam damage might see a resurgence in importance. So,
if you haven&rsquo;t settled on a career yet, you may wish to
spend a little time studying this field because all known
radiation-damagemicroscopists have retired or are close,
and the hard-earned knowledge from the early halcyon
years is in danger of being forgotten!
</p>
<p>Vacancies caused by displacement damage can
enhance diffusion processes which, in turn, can speed
diffusional transformations when they&rsquo;re being studied
in situ in the IVEM/HVEM. There are many other prob-
lems that can arise during in-situ observations, so inter-
pretation isn&rsquo;t always straightforward. The book by
Butler andHale is recommended formore facts, practical
hints, and many beautiful images of reactions occurring,
in real time, in thin foils. More recently, Gai has edited a
volume of contributed chapters on in-situ TEMand there
is much excitement in the field about the possibilities for
growth of this important area due (not surprisingly) to
the advent of Cs correction bringing about TEM stages
with larger pole-piece gaps, thus permitting easier inser-
tion of gas-reaction stages.
</p>
<p>4.6.F Sputtering
</p>
<p>The displacement of surface atoms, or sputtering, occurs
in the TEM at voltages which are &lt;0.5Et. If your speci-
men is quite thick then this problem is minor since the
average, through-thickness, characteristics of the speci-
men are not changed significantly by any changes on the
surface. But, as we&rsquo;ve already noted many times, your
specimen should really be very thin (thinner is better yet
again) if you want to get the best images and the best
analytical information. In these specimens, modifications
of the surface structure and chemistry may be sufficient
to affect the image interpretation and/or change the
average through-thickness composition enough to affect
the accuracy of any quantitative analysis. Table 4.3 lists
typical sputtering threshold energies (Es) compared with
displacement thresholds (Ed) and their relative values
compared to how much energy can be transferred by
electrons of different energies. As you can see, there is
cause for concern even with 100-keV beams. A STEM
can easily drill a hole through MgO.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Inelastic scattering transfers energy to your specimen, generating a lot of useful signals with
which we can form different images or get spectroscopic information about the chemistry
and electronic structure of the specimen. Much of this information is localized at the
nanometer level or below.
</p>
<p>&amp; The generation of many different characteristic signals all localized with nanometer-
scale (or below) spatial resolution is a most powerful aspect of TEM.

<p>&amp; Unfortunately, these same inelastic processes create beam damage and heat which can be
disastrous under certain conditions for all kinds of TEM specimens. To minimize heat
transfer, cool your specimen and use higher voltages and thinner specimens but beware:
</p>
<p>&amp; If the accelerating voltage is high enough, knock-on and sputtering damagewill occur in all

<p>Electron Sources
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>A reliable source of electrons to &lsquo;illuminate&rsquo; the specimen is one of themost important parts of a
TEM. Fortunately, electron sources are plentiful, but to get the best images and other signals
out of our expensive microscope, we need to use the best available source. There are stringent
requirements to produce the beam of electrons with the necessary properties and these are best
met by only two types of source: thermionic and field-emission sources (or &lsquo;guns&rsquo; as they are
often called). Thermionic sources are (now rarely) tungsten filaments or (now commonly)
lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) crystals, and field emitters are fine tungsten needles. In this
chapter we&rsquo;ll first explain briefly the physics of the different electron-emission processes because
then you&rsquo;ll understand why we operate the sources in certain ways. Next we&rsquo;ll tell you the
characteristics we need from our electron beam. Then we&rsquo;ll compare the sources and show you
that no one source is best for all aspects of TEM, but all have their roles. Finally, we&rsquo;ll explain
ways to check that a particular source meets your needs.
</p>
<p>Because the source is so critical to the performance of the microscope, the technology is
advancing rapidly with the aim being to have complete computer control, which would leave
you, the operator, with very little to do except push the &lsquo;on&rsquo; button. This state of affairs ismost
advanced for the field-emission source, and since these are both delicate and expensive, it is
just as well. But the majority of TEMs still use thermionic sources, and these may need a fair
bit of operator control. In these circumstances, you should know how these sources work and
why you do certain things to them. So we&rsquo;ll spend much of this chapter talking about
thermionic sources, although field emission is essential for the best performing TEMs of
any kind (imaging, analytical, etc.), so there&rsquo;s a good chance that field emission will expand to
be the source of choice in the future.
</p>
<p>5.1 THE PHYSICS OF DIFFERENT
ELECTRON SOURCES
</p>
<p>We use two kinds of electron sources in TEMs: the first
kind is called a thermionic source, which, as the name
suggests, produces electrons when heated, and the second
type is a field-emission source, which produces electrons
when a large electric potential is applied between it and
an anode. Schottky sources combine both heat and field
emissions. These sources are part of an assembly which
we refer to as the electron &lsquo;gun.&rsquo; Now, from a physics
standpoint, it is really quite interesting to know the
details of how electron sources work and there&rsquo;s a great
deal of active research into new and improved sources,
and carbon nanotubes show some real promise. (Like
future TV screens but using higher voltages.)
</p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, you don&rsquo;t have to
know too much about the physics, and we can sum-
marize the essential points very briefly, using two
</p>
<p>simple equations. Keep in mind two points as you
read about sources
</p>
<p>&amp; Your TEMwill use a thermionic source (W or LaB6)
or a field-emission (W) source and the two cannot be
interchanged.
</p>
<p>&amp; Field-emission sources give more monochromatic
electrons; thermionic sources are less monochro-
matic and give &lsquo;whiter&rsquo; electrons.
</p>
<p>The analogy here is to X-rays or visible light. The
&lsquo;color&rsquo; of electrons depends on their energy spread
(which translates into a frequency or a wavelength
range using equation 1.6); we&rsquo;ll discuss this in Section
5.2. You don&rsquo;t always need to use monochromatic elec-
trons, even if your field-emission TEM did cost twice as
much as a conventional microscope would with a therm-
ionic source.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.1.A Thermionic Emission
</p>
<p>If we heat any material to a high-enough temperature,
we can give the electrons sufficient energy to overcome
the natural barrier that prevents them from leaking out
from the surface. This barrier is termed the work func-
tion (F) and has a value of a few eV.
</p>
<p>The physics of thermionic emission can be summar-
ized in Richardson&rsquo;s law which relates the current den-
sity from the source, J, to the operating temperature, T
in Kelvin
</p>
<p>J &frac14; AT2e�
F
kT (5:1)
</p>
<p>Here k is Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant (8.6 � 10�5 eV/K)
andA is Richardson&rsquo;s constant (A/m2K2), which is only
constant for a given sourcematerial. From this equation
you can see that we need to heat the source to a tem-
peratureT such that energy&gt;F is given to the electrons;
then they will escape from the source and be available to
form an electron beam. Unfortunately, when we put a
few eV of thermal energy into most materials they either
melt or vaporize. So the only viable thermionic sources
are either refractory (high melting point) materials or
those with an exceptionally low F. The source used for
the first several decades of TEMs (and still used in some
SEMs) was tungsten which melts at 3660 K and the only
thermionic source used by modern TEMs is lanthanum
hexaboride (LaB6) which has a low F. If you look at
Table 5.1, you&rsquo;ll see the relative values of Jc,T, andF for
tungsten and LaB6.
</p>
<p>We use several different words to describe the
sources. We called tungsten sources filaments, because
tungsten was drawn into fine wire similar to the filament
used in an incandescent light bulb. LaB6 crystals (which
should not be called filaments) are usually grown with a
&lt;110&gt; orientation to enhance emission. Sometimes we
call both tungsten and LaB6 sources cathodes because,
as we&rsquo;ll see, the complete gun assembly acts as a triode
system in which the source is the cathode.
</p>
<p>So all you need to know from the physics is that
heating up a thermionic source gives you a higher J.
But there is a limit, because higher temperatures shorten
</p>
<p>the source life through evaporation and/or oxidation.
So we seek a compromise operating temperature. We
thus operate under a condition called &lsquo;saturation&rsquo; which
we&rsquo;ll discuss in &lsquo;Thermionic Guns.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>5.1.B Field Emission
</p>
<p>Field-emission sources, usually called FEGs (for field-
emission guns: pronounced either as &lsquo;F-E-Gs&rsquo; or as
&lsquo;fegs&rsquo;) operate in a fundamentally different way to therm-
ionic sources. The principle behind FE is that the
strength of an electric field E is considerably increased
at sharp points because, if we have a voltage V applied
to a (spherical) point of radius r, then
</p>
<p>E &frac14;
V
</p>
<p>r
(5:2)
</p>
<p>We call the fine needles &lsquo;tips.&rsquo; The technique of
atom-probe field-ion microscopy (APFIM) is another
well-established experimental tool for materials char-
acterization. APFIM uses specimens with a very fine
needle shape, and so there&rsquo;s a lot of expertise available
to help produce FE tips. One of the easiest materials to
produce with a fine needle point is tungsten wire which
can readily be given a tip radius of&lt; 0.1 mm. If we apply
a 1-kV potential to this tip then E is 1010 V/m and this
lowers the work-function barrier sufficiently for elec-
trons to tunnel out of the tungsten. The tunneling pro-
cess is the same as you&rsquo;ve met in semiconductor devices.
Applying such high fields imposes a severe stress on
the tip and the material must be mechanically strong
to remain intact. FE, like thermionic emission from
LaB6, varies with the orientation of the tungsten crystal-
line tip; the &lt;310&gt; orientation is found to be best.
</p>
<p>For FE to occur, the surface has to be pristine, i.e.,
it must be free of contaminants and oxide. We can
achieve this by operating in ultra-high vacuum
(UHV) conditions (&lt;10�9 Pa). In this case the tungsten
is operated at ambient temperatures and the process is
called &lsquo;cold&rsquo; FE. Alternatively, we can keep the surface
in a pristine condition at a poorer vacuum by heating
the tip. The thermal energy assists in electron emission

<p>so much that, in fact, the electrons don&rsquo;t tunnel
through the barrier. For such &lsquo;thermal&rsquo; FE, surface
treatments with ZrO2 improve the emission character-
istics, particularly the stability of the source, and such
Schottky emitters are the most popular. There are pros
and cons for both CFE and TFE, which we&rsquo;ll talk
about later in the chapter.
</p>
<p>5.2 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
ELECTRON BEAM
</p>
<p>The electron beam in a TEM requires certain charac-
teristics which are controlled by the source itself and
how we integrate the source into a gun assembly. We
describe the performance of an electron source by such
words as brightness, coherency, and stability. While
these words mean something to you already, they
have very precise meanings in TEM terminology, so
we&rsquo;ll go through the various characteristics, tell you
what they mean and why they are important in the
TEM.We&rsquo;ll then compare the properties of the various
sources that you may have in your microscopes. You&rsquo;ll
see that there&rsquo;s no best source for all applications, but
for specific applications one source or other is usually
better.
</p>
<p>Before we define the electron-beam characteristics
needed in a TEM, it is worth summarizing a few of the
properties of electron beams in general and how these
vary with kV.
</p>
<p>5.2.A Brightness
</p>
<p>The word brightness is often confused with intensity and
indeed the two terms are related. For instance, when we
look at the viewing screen of a TEM, we may say how
&lsquo;bright&rsquo; it is, when we are really referring to the intensity
of light coming from the screen. When we think of the
intensity of any radiation source, it is in terms of the flux
emanating from it. For a light bulb, it would be the
number of photons per unit area per unit time. For
electron sources we talk about the current density,
which is the number of electrons (or charge) per unit
area per unit time.
</p>
<p>Electron sources differ considerably in their size and,
as a result, the electrons leave the source with a range of
divergent angles, so we can&rsquo;t ignore the angular
</p>
<p>distribution of the electrons. Brightness is particularly
important when we are using very small convergent
probes, as we do in AEM and STEM. The concept of
brightness is less important in conventional TEMwhere
we use a relatively large, defocused beam, but it is still
relevant to the intensity we see on the screen, and so it
affects how easy it is to operate the microscope and see
our images and DPs.
</p>
<p>So we can consider an electron source as having the
following characteristics
</p>
<p>&amp; Diameter d0
&amp; Cathode emission current ie
&amp; Divergence angle a0 (remember when we say angle
we mean semi-angle)
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll describe the actual way in which these charac-
teristics are achieved in Section 5.3, where we discuss
the complete gun assembly, but if you look at Figure 5.1
you&rsquo;ll see that ie, d0, and a0 are actually defined at the gun
crossover, that is, the point at which the electrons are
focused after leaving the source. The current density
</p>
<p>BRIGHTNESS
While current density can be a useful term, it is more
important to define the brightness. Brightness is the
current density per unit solid angle of the source.

</p>
<p>(5:3)
</p>
<p>This brightness equation is an important one which you
should remember.What is not shown in this equation is the
important fact thatb increases linearlywith increasing accel-
erating voltage for thermionic sources. This was one reason
for the development of intermediate-voltage (300&ndash;400 kV)
instruments.
</p>
<p>Obviously, the higher the value of b, the more elec-
trons we can put into a beam of a given size, and so the
more information we can generate from the specimen
and also the more we can damage sensitive specimens.
The beam current is an important part of the brightness
equation. Measuring the beam current in situ can be a
very good diagnostic tool. We&rsquo;ll talk about this later in
the chapter whenwe discussmeasuring b, but for the time
being you can again look at Table 5.1 to see how the
various sources compare in brightness.
</p>
<p>Now we can consider some real numbers. With a
cold FEG at 100 keV, we can put 1 nA into an area of
diameter 1 nm. If you convert this current density to units
of power (1watt=1J/s), you&rsquo;ll find that the energy the
electron beam puts into this small area of the specimen is
nearly 150MW/mm2. By comparison, the output of a
typical electric power-generating turbine is anywhere
from 350 to 1000MW. If all this energy were in fact
absorbed by the TEM specimen the technique would be
useless since the specimen would vaporize. We&rsquo;ll find out
later why this doesn&rsquo;t happen but clearly we can alter our
specimenwhenwe look at it in the TEM, aswe discussed in
relation to beam damage in the previous chapter.
The energy density we just calculated is such that a TEM
electron source is the brightest, continuously radiating
source known; it is considerably brighter than a supernova.
</p>
<p>The brightness is particularly important in AEM,
which is the quantitative analysis of the many signals
that come from a specimen irradiated by an electron
beam, shown back in Figure 1.3. As you&rsquo;ll see in Part
4, we need to put the most beam current into the smal-
lest probe to optimize both spatial resolution and ana-
lytical sensitivity. Similarly, as we go to higher
magnifications in HRTEM, the intensity of light com-
ing from the viewing screen (see Chapter 7) becomes less
because we are viewing only a small fraction of the
illuminated area of the specimen. The electron density
can be increased by using the brightest source. Then
</p>
<p>images can be recorded with reasonably short exposure
times minimizing image drift and other instabilities. So
brighter is better for AEM and HREM.
</p>
<p>5.2.B Temporal Coherency and Energy Spread
</p>
<p>The coherency of a beam of electrons is a way of defin-
ing how well the electron waves are &lsquo;in step&rsquo; with one
another. You know that white light is incoherent,
because it consists of photons with a range of frequen-
cies (colors), and so to get a coherent beam of electrons
we must create one in which all the electrons have the
same frequency (i.e., wavelength) just like monochro-
matic light. We refer to this aspect of coherency as
temporal coherency, which is a measure of how similar
the wave packets are. If the packets are all identical they
have the same coherence length. A definition of the
coherence length lc is
</p>
<p>lc &frac14;
vh
</p>
<p>DE
(5:4)
</p>
<p>where v is the electron velocity, DE is the energy spread of
the beam, and h is Planck&rsquo;s constant. This means we must
have stable power supplies to the source and a stable high-
voltage supply (or high tension, as it is sometimes called
for historical reasons) so that all the electrons have a small
DE, thus giving a well-defined wavelength. We&rsquo;ll show in
detail in Section 37.7 how we can add an energy-selecting
spectrometer to the gun to choose electrons with an
energy-spread of as little as 10 meV. Such monochroma-
tors are expensive and cut down the total beam current
tremendously but, for certain very specialized applica-
tions, they are invaluable. This loss of current can be
offset somewhat by Cs correction (even more expense)
and instruments with combinations of monochromators
andCs corrector are the most expensive (and rare) TEMs
in the world. If you look at Table 5.1 you&rsquo;ll see that,
without a monochromator, typical DE values for the
three sources are in the range 0.3&ndash;3 eV (which is still
remarkably small compared with a total energy of
100&ndash;400 keV). So it isn&rsquo;t really correct to imply as we
did at the start of the chapter that thermionic sources give
&lsquo;white&rsquo; electrons since DE is so very small. From these
values of DE, if you take care to get the units consistent,
you can calculate typical coherence lengths, which turn
out to be a few hundred nanometers.
</p>
<p>Temporal coherency is important when the energy
spread of the electrons that are incident on the specimen
affects the microscopy. Because we can make such good
high-voltage power supplies, the incident electron-
energy spread rarely limits any aspect of TEM except
the highest energy-resolution EELS (see Chapters
37&ndash;40). In other words, for most practical purposes
our electron sources are stable enough. However, we&rsquo;ll
see that it&rsquo;s a very different matter when we have to
consider the electrons that have come through the speci-
men because they may have lost substantial amounts of

<p>energy and that&rsquo;s where energy-filtered TEM technology
really comes into its own (see Section 37.6).
</p>
<p>5.2.C Spatial Coherency and Source Size
</p>
<p>Spatial coherency is related to the size of the source.
Perfect spatial coherence would imply that the electrons
were all emanating from the same point at the source. So
source size governs spatial coherence and smaller sources
give better coherency (just as they give higher brightness).
The spatial coherence is strictly defined by looking at
electron-interference fringes in the equivalent of a Fresnel
biprism experiment in light optics, with which you may
be familiar. We can define the distance dc, the effective
source size for coherent illumination, to be
</p>
<p>dc &frac14;
l
</p>
<p>2a
(5:5)
</p>
<p>where l is the electron wavelength and a is the angle sub-
tended by the source at the specimen. We can control a by
inserting an aperture in the illumination system, as we&rsquo;ll see
when we describe the construction of a TEM in Chapter 9.
But if this aperture is not limiting then it is the smallest source
which subtends the smallest angle, and thus has the highest
spatial coherence. Putting reasonable values for 100-keV
electrons into equation 5.5 we find that the spatial
coherence is at best only about a nanometer. To max-
imize the coherency, you can choose several approaches
</p>
<p>&amp; Make the source size, dc, smaller, e.g., by using a FE
source. This explains why research into using nano-
tubes as electron sources is ongoing.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use a smaller illumination aperture, thus reducing a.
&amp; If your source size is large (e.g., a W hairpin)
decrease the accelerating voltage and thus increase l.
</p>
<p>A small electron source subtends a small angle at the
specimen, and we can help by using small limiting aper-
tures. Small beams are more spatially coherent than
large beams and give better spatial resolution of analysis
(see Part 4). The more coherent and parallel the beam,
the better the quality of the phase-contrast images (Part
3), the sharper the DPs (Part 2), and the better the
diffraction contrast in images of crystalline specimens
(Part 3). So that&rsquo;s why spatial coherence is important.
The whole concept of coherence is rather more com-
plex than we have described here and an in-depth and
rather mathematical description of electron coherency
in the TEM is given in the review by Hawkes and in the
companion text.
</p>
<p>5.2.D Stability
</p>
<p>In addition to the stability of the high-voltage supply to the
source, it is also important that the electron current coming
from the source is stable. Otherwise the screen intensity
would vary, making it difficult for you to take correctly
exposed images and also making quantitative analytical
measurements impossible. Thermionic sources are gener-
ally very stable except when they are first installed or
when they are about to fail. Typically, you can expect
variations of &lt; �1%/hr in the current and TFE sources
are similarly stable. For CFE sources, however, the emis-
sion current is not very stable, and electrical feedback
circuits are required to maintain stability to &lt;�5%. Sta-
bility improves with better UHV conditions in the gun.
</p>
<p>To summarize: the important properties of electron
sources are their brightness, temporal coherency, energy
spread, spatial coherency and stability. A smaller source
size gives higher b and better spatial coherency, but less
stability.
</p>
<p>Now that we know the critical characteristics required
of electron sources, let&rsquo;s examine those used in com-
mercial TEMs.
</p>
<p>5.3 ELECTRON GUNS
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no good just having a source. We need to be
able to control the electron beam and direct it into
the illumination system of the TEM. We do this by
incorporating the source into a gun assembly which, in
effect, acts as a lens to focus the electrons coming from
the source. The design of the gun is different for
thermionic sources and FE sources.
</p>
<p>5.3.A Thermionic Guns
</p>
<p>LaB6 is the only thermionic source used in modern
TEMs so we&rsquo;ll just describe these. The LaB6 crystal is
used as the cathode in a triode gun shown in Figure 5.1.
In addition to the cathode, there is a grid called a
Wehnelt cylinder and an anode at earth potential
with a hole in its center. What these three components
look like in practice is shown inFigure 5.2, where they are
all separated. The cathode is attached to the high-voltage
cable that, in turn, connects to the high-voltage power
supply. The LaB6 crystal is bonded to a metal wire such
as rhenium, which is resistively heated to cause therm-
ionic emission.
</p>
<p>When the electrons leave the cathode they have a
negative potential of whatever accelerating voltage you
have chosen (say 100 kV) with respect to the earthed
anode. So they accelerate through this potential differ-
ence, acquiring an energy of 100 keV and a velocity
greater than half the speed of light.
</p>
<p>Now to get a controllable beam of electrons through
the hole in the anode and into the microscope itself, we
apply a small negative bias to the Wehnelt cylinder. The
</p>
<p>COHERENCY
Spatial coherency is more important practically
than temporal coherency; smaller source &ndash;&gt; higher
b, better spatial coherency, but lower stability.
</p>
<p>5 .3 ELECTRON GUNS ................................................................................................................................................................................. 77</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>electrons coming off the cathode see the negative field
and are converged to a point called a crossover between
the Wehnelt and the anode as shown in Figure 5.1. We
could operate the controls for the cathode heating and
</p>
<p>theWehnelt bias independently, but the electronic circuitry
of the gun is designed so that as the emission current
increases, the Wehnelt bias increases; this arrangement
is called a self-biasinggun.The result is shown inFigure 5.3,
which plots the emission current (ie) against the current
used to heat the cathode (if). As you can see, ie reaches
a maximum such that a further increase in if doesn&rsquo;t
increase the current going into the TEM column. This is
the saturation condition and all thermionic sources should
be operated at or just below saturation. Operating above
saturation reduces the source life without any compensat-
ing advantage; operating significantly below saturation
reduces the current into your specimen, thus reducing the
intensity of all the signals coming out of your specimen
although on occasions, as we&rsquo;ll see later, undersaturation
can be useful.
</p>
<p>In addition to optimizing the source life, operating at
saturation also optimizes brightness. If you look at
Figure 5.1, the crossover is the source size d0 that we
used back in the brightness equation (equation 5.3) and
the divergence angle at the crossover is a0 in that same
equation. The current in the crossover is the emission
current ie. Now, as shown in Figure 5.4A, if theWehnelt
bias were too low (diagram i) d0would not be very small
and if the bias were too high (diagram iii) the cathode-
emission current would be suppressed. In either case b
would be low. The optimum b is at an intermediate-bias
setting (diagram ii), as summarized in Figure 5.4B. You
would be right if you thought that the small bias on the

</p>
<p>WEHNELT
The Wehnelt acts as a simple electrostatic lens: the
first lens the electrons go through in the TEM.
</p>
<p>BEAM CURRENT
As the cathode heating current (if) increases, T
increases until thermionic emission occurs; then an
emission current from the cathode ie can be mea-
sured. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll find this current referred to
as the beam current. This is misleading; the true beam
current is that which enters the specimen after the
electrons have left the gun and gone through the
illumination system of the TEM.
</p>
<p>78 .....................................................................................................................................................................................ELECTRON SOURCES</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Wehnelt acts against the accelerating voltage, so the
true beam voltage should be the applied kV minus the
Wehnelt bias (which may be up to 2 kV), but this is
compensated for in the design of the gun, so don&rsquo;t
worry.
</p>
<p>So how do we achieve saturation? One way is to look
at the meter which displays ie and watch it rise to a
maximum as if is continuously increased. This method
may not be easy because the appropriate readouts may
not be available or, if they are, they may not be very
sensitive. So the standard way is to look at the image of
the source crossover on the TEM screen. This image
shows you the distribution of electrons coming off the
source. As thermionic emission starts, the electrons may
come from both the central tip and/or a region sur-
rounding the tip of the crystal. Since LaB6 sources
have well-defined crystal facets (Figure 5.5A) the under-
saturated image is as shown in Figure 5.5B. With
increasing emission the halo collapses in on the central
bright disk, although some structure may still be visible.
The cathode is truly saturated when no structure is
visible (Figure 5.5C).
</p>
<p>It is best to operate an LaB6 source just below
saturation, since this will extend the source life without
undue loss of signal. The electrons in the halo are more
coherent than those in the central bright region and
have reduced energy spread. LaB6 crystals are suscepti-
ble to thermal shockwhich can cause them to break, and
so you should take care when heating and cooling an
LaB6 source (often the TEM computer takes control of
this). If you have to switch the source on and off manu-
ally then increase/decrease the heating current slowly,
with 10&ndash;20 seconds pause between each setting. This is
particularly critical after you&rsquo;ve installed a new LaB6
source.
</p>
<p>The appearance of the image of the source, as in
Figure 5.5, can also be used to align the gun assembly
so that the beam is aligned along the optic axis of the
TEM.This is the only other adjustment you have to do to
the gun, apart from saturating it. The source is usually
pre-aligned by the manufacturer, so alignment should be
simple when it is put inside the Wehnelt. Typically, a
misaligned, undersaturated source image is asymmetrical
as in Figure 5.5B and, in those circumstances, all you
have to do is adjust the gun to make it symmetrical prior
to final saturation. Detailed instructions will be in the
manufacturer&rsquo;s handbook. Most modern TEM guns are
so well constructed that slight electronic corrections are
all that you need to ensure alignment.
</p>
<p>In an SEM, which always requires a small probe
rather than a broad beam, the gun is carefully adjusted
by themanufacturer to produce optimumb at saturation;
youmay not have any external control of theWehnelt. In
a TEM, particularly when you are operating in a broad-
beam mode, there is no need to optimize b, but you may
need to increase the current density and make the image
appear brighter. You can do this by decreasing theWeh-
nelt bias, using the gun-emission control. When you
decrease the bias, you should go back and adjust if to
ensure you&rsquo;re at saturation, since the saturation condi-
tionwill changewith changing bias. So now youwill have
a greater current density falling on the screen, but the
crossover size will have increased, thus decreasing b. This

<p>is not important when you&rsquo;re operating with a broad
beam. However, if you want to operate at maximum b
with a focused beam, as is the case for AEM, then you
need to be able to measure b; we&rsquo;ll show you how to do
this in Section 5.5.
</p>
<p>5.3.B Field-Emission Guns (FEGs)
</p>
<p>In many ways, FEGs are much simpler than thermionic
guns. In order to get a FEG to work we make it the
cathode with respect to two anodes. The first anode is
positively charged by several kV with respect to the tip.
This charge produces the extraction voltage since it gen-
erates the intense electric field which enables electrons to
</p>
<p>tunnel out of the tip. Increasing the extraction voltage
when you first switch on the gun has to be done slowly,
so the thermo-mechanical shock doesn&rsquo;t fracture the tip.
This is the only practical step you have to carry out to run
a FEG; it is invariably computer controlled.
</p>
<p>&amp; Anode 1 provides the extraction voltage to pull elec-
trons out of the tip.
</p>
<p>&amp; Anode 2 accelerates the electrons to 100 kV or more.
</p>
<p>The electrons are accelerated through the appropri-
ate voltage by the second anode. The combined fields
of the anodes act like a refined electrostatic lens to
produce a crossover, as shown in Figure 5.6A. This

<p>lens controls the effective source size and position, but
it isn&rsquo;t very flexible. Incorporating a magnetic lens into
the gun gives a more controllable beam and larger b.
The faults (known as lens aberrations) in the gun lens
are very important in determining the source size; we&rsquo;ll
talk extensively about lens aberrations in Chapter 6.
</p>
<p>We have already noted that CFE requires a pristine
surface and, even in UHV conditions, surface contami-
nants build up on the tip. With time, the emission cur-
rent falls and the extraction voltage must be increased to
compensate. Eventually it becomes necessary to remove
the contamination by &lsquo;flashing&rsquo; the tip. This just means
reversing the potential to the tip and &lsquo;blowing off&rsquo; the
surface layer of atoms, and/or heating the tip quickly to
�5000 K to evaporate the contaminants. In most CFE
guns flashing occurs automatically, when the extraction
voltage increases to a certain predetermined level.
Because they are continuously heated, Schottky FEGs
do not form the same surface contamination layer and
so don&rsquo;t need flashing. A typical FEG tip is shown in
Figure 5.6B.
</p>
<p>A future generation of ultra-bright field-emission
electron sources might well be based on carbon
nanotubes which have already demonstrated a
brightness in excess of 1014 A/m2 sr although such
a laboratory demonstration is a long way from reli-
able service in a commercial IVEM in a student-
oriented lab. It is perhaps more likely that this tech-
nology will be developed for tips in scanning-probe
microscopes or electron emitters for flat-panel dis-
play technology well before it becomes an electron
source in a TEM.
</p>
<p>5.4 COMPARISON OF GUNS
</p>
<p>The important characteristics of the three guns we&rsquo;ve
talked about are summarized in Table 5.1. For historical
reasons, we&rsquo;ve included tungsten sources which are the
worst in most respects (except price).
</p>
<p>LaB6 is a much more useful source for several
reasons. While it is not as refractory as tungsten, LaB6
has a much lower value of F and, since F appears in the
exponential in the Richardson equation, its effect on the
current density is dominant. LaB6 crystals can be pro-
duced with a fine tip about 1 mm in radius, which
accounts for the smaller crossover size. As a result,
LaB6 current densities are considerably higher than for
</p>
<p>tungsten and the brightness is typically 10 times greater,
even though LaB6 is usually operated at a much lower
T to increase operating life. The decreased source size
also results in improved coherency and the energy
spread approaches 1 eV.
</p>
<p>Because LaB6 is highly reactive, the gun vacuum
has to be good enough to minimize oxidation during
operation, thus ensuring a reasonable life expectancy.
Anything that requires improving the vacuum is
good since better vacuums improve most aspects of
TEM performance, but this improvement comes at a
price.
</p>
<p>The increased brightness, higher coherency, and
longer life are tremendous advantages and explain why
the only thermionic sources we should now use in TEM
are LaB6. You, as the operator, may have considerable
control over its performance and unless the computer
control overrides you, careless heating, cooling, and
oversaturation can easily destroy a LaB6 crystal. So
treat LaB6 sources gently and you will be well rewarded.
If users are not careful, your TEM supervisor may
extend the life of the LaB6 to the point where it behaves
no better than a W filament. LaB6 sources don&rsquo;t die,
they fade away.
</p>
<p>In FEGs, the current density is enormous and b is
correspondingly high. The values in Table 5.1 are all for
100 kV-accelerating voltage and you should remember
that for thermionic sources, b increases linearly with kV,
so there are advantages to using 300- and 400-kV instru-
ments. However, the LaB6 source brightness at 400 kV
still does not approach b of a FEG at 100 kV. So for all
applications that require a bright, coherent source, the
FEG is best. This is the case for AEM, HRTEM, and
such special applications as electron holography and
Lorentz microscopy (for looking at magnetic domains).
However, as we&rsquo;ll see later, the coherence of the source
may produce a new complication: we must interpret the
image!
</p>
<p>There are significant differences between a CFE and
a Schottky (TFE) sources and, depending on what you
need from your TEM, one or the other may be signifi-
cantly better. First of all, the extremely small source size
of a cold FEG means that the beam is highly spatially
coherent and the resulting energy spread is the smallest
available without monochromation. Thermally
assisted Schottky FEGs have a somewhat larger source
size and larger energy spread but they provide greater
stability of beam current and lower noise. A CFE
requires UHV; such technology is expensive and gen-
erally requires a higher level of operator competence.
However, a UHV brings other advantages such as a
cleaner specimen stage and reduced contamination
from the microscope system. Cleaning the tip by heat-
ing as we do for a Schottky rather than flashing as in a
CFE lowers the stress on the tip, ensuring a longer life.
But the cleaner UHV system for a CFE gun also
</p>
<p>VACUUM IS IMPORTANT
In a vacuum of 10�5 Pa, one monolayer of contami-
nants will form on a substrate in less than a minute.
At 10�8 Pa, it will take 7 hours to form a monolayer.
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ensures a long life and so both FE sources offer similar
lifetimes measured in the thousands of hours (if you&rsquo;re
careful!). In summary, if you are doing EELS and need
the lowest possible energy spread or you are doing the
highest resolution STEM imaging and X-ray analysis
in which the highest brightness and smallest probe size
are required, then a cold FEG has advantages. For
routine FEG work a Schottky gun is better, more
reliable, and easier to operate.
</p>
<p>Lastly, we should note that for routine, relatively
low magnification (&lt;50&ndash;100,000�) TEM imaging, a
FEG is far from ideal because the source size is too
small. It is thus not possible to illuminate large areas
of your specimen at low image magnifications without
losing current density, and therefore intensity, on the
screen. So you can&rsquo;t see your image clearly at low mag-
nifications. Under these circumstances, a LaB6 source is
better. However, increased computer control and the
need for optimal performance means that FEG TEMs
are increasingly popular and for the best high-resolution
imaging and analytical performance, as we&rsquo;ve made
clear, there is no alternative. If you still don&rsquo;t get it,
there&rsquo;s a good interactive summary of both thermion-
ic and FE electron guns and how they work on
URL #1.
</p>
<p>5.5 MEASURING YOUR GUN
CHARACTERISTICS
</p>
<p>This section requires that you know how to operate a
TEM. If you&rsquo;re a novice, you should skip this part of the
chapter for now because we are going to refer ahead in
the book for much of what you need to know.
</p>
<p>For conventional TEM imaging and diffraction and
many other routine uses, all you need to do is saturate
and align the (thermionic) gun or just switch on the
FEG and then ignore it. In many instruments the com-
puter takes care of this. There are, however, times when
we need to be able to measure the brightness and coher-
ency. The source brightness is a most important param-
eter to measure in an AEM since, if the gun is not
operating at its maximum b, then the quality of the
analytical information that is generated will be poorer.
Similarly, knowing the energy spread of your source is
important for EELS and having a measure of the beam
coherency can be important for some more advanced
techniques that we&rsquo;ve just mentioned. So let&rsquo;s see how
we can measure the various parameters that we&rsquo;ve just
discussed. We&rsquo;ll start with b, then DE, and finally the
coherency.
</p>
<p>Bymeasuring the three variables in equation 5.3, i.e.,
the beam current, the beam diameter, and the angle of
convergence, we can determine b. However, while we
can easily get a measure of the emission current at the
gun, it is impossible to measure d0 and a0 there (think
</p>
<p>about why this is so). So we make the approximation
that, if we neglect lens aberrations, b is constant
throughout the electron-optical system so it doesn&rsquo;t
matter where it is measured. It is easiest, practically, to
determine b at the plane of the specimen and we&rsquo;ll now
show you how to do this. (Neglecting lens aberrations is
reasonable but you should be aware that Cs correction
in TEMs can effectively increase the brightness of the
electron beam at the specimen since we can use larger
apertures to permit higher currents in the probe without
broadening the probe dimensions.)
</p>
<p>5.5.A Beam Current
</p>
<p>You can measure the beam current at the specimen ib
directly using a Faraday cup in a specimen holder. A
Faraday cup consists of a small aperture above a rela-
tively deep hole in an earthed metal block. If the aper-
ture is small enough (e.g.,�50 mm) and the metal block
deep enough (�2mm), and made of something light
like Al to minimize backscatter, then it is a reasonable
assumption that no electrons escape back out of the
entrance aperture. All the electrons going into the
aperture therefore go to earth, and you can measure
the electron current using a picoammeter in the earth
line. (Ideally a Faraday cup would be available perma-
nently in the column of a TEM, and this would permit
constant monitoring of the beam current but no TEM
manufacturer offers such.) You should calibrate your
Faraday-cup measurement against the TEM screen
exposure meter or the electron energy-loss spectrom-
eter shield current. Carrying out this procedure
allows you to make a rapid estimate of ib at any time
you need it.
</p>
<p>In modern TEMs equipped with a Schottky FEG,
the beam-current fluctuation should be less than a few
percent over many hours of operation. The stable
beam current in Schottky-FEG TEMs does not need
to be monitored frequently and can be calibrated
easily through the readout from the viewing screen.
Conversely, the beam current decreases with time in
cold-FEGTEMs. Figure 5.7 shows the time dependence
of the emission and the beam current measured after tip-
flashing in the cold-FEG STEM. While the emission
current decreases almost linearly, the beam current
drops parabolically up to 3 hours after flashing. In
thermionic-source TEMs, the beam current also
decreases after stabilization. This variation would not
be nearly so large for a Schottky FEG which, of course,
never needs flashing.
</p>
<p>MEASURING THE BEAM
AFaraday cup is a black hole for electrons and a very
useful diagnostic tool for your TEM performance.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll show in Chapter 6, ib is a strong function
of the beam size. Therefore, the current is controlled
by the first condenser (C1) lens strength and the size
of the final beam-limiting aperture in the second
condenser (C2) lens. If you look ahead to Figures
9.10 and 9.11 you will see the variation of ib as a
function of C1 lens strength and the effect of C2
aperture size on a0.
</p>
<p>&amp; The beam current is usually in the range from
nanoamps to picoamps.
</p>
<p>&amp; The emission current is typically several microamps.
</p>
<p>So the current decreases by three to six orders
of magnitude between the gun and the specimen:
most is lost in the illumination system, as we&rsquo;ll see in
Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>5.5.B Convergence Angle
</p>
<p>You can easily measure the convergence angle a from
the convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) pat-
tern, which you can see directly on the TEM screen.
(You will need to read Chapter 21 in order to find out
how to generate CBED patterns.) In the schematic dia-
gram in Figure 5.8, the total convergence angle 2a is
proportional to the width of the diffraction discs, a. This
width can easily be calibrated if the specimen has a
known Bragg angle 2yB (see Chapter 11), since 2yB is
proportional to the distance, b, from the 000 disc to the
hkl disc. Thus
</p>
<p>2a &frac14; 2yB
a
</p>
<p>b
(5:6)
</p>
<p>The convergence angle, a, at the specimen is not only
important in the brightness equation, but we&rsquo;ll see that it
also plays a major role in CBED, STEM imaging,
XEDS, and EELS. So you must know how to measure
and control a because it is essential in many aspects of
TEM. The value of a is controlled by the size of the final
limiting aperture in the illumination system andwe&rsquo;ll see
how this works in Chapter 6.
</p>
<p>5.5.C Calculating the Beam Diameter
</p>
<p>While it is a relatively simple matter to measure ib and
determine a, the measurement of d, the beam diameter,
is not so straightforward. However, d is a major factor
in all aspects of TEM such as AEM and STEM imaging
where we use a fine focused beam. We can either calcu-
late d or measure it experimentally. The former is easy
but imprecise, the latter is difficult and can be equally
imprecise. The first problem with determining d is that
there is no universally accepted definition of the beam
diameter. The manufacturer will give you a list of nom-
inal beam sizes for each setting of the C1 lens. These
values are calculated and may differ from the actual
beam size by large amounts. The calculation assumes
that the electron-intensity distribution in the beam is
Gaussian, and the beam diameter is defined as the
full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian
distribution, defined in Figure 5.9. To approach a
Gaussian intensity distribution, the beam must be well
aligned, any astigmatism in the condenser lenses cor-
rected (see Chapter 9), and all apertures in the illumina-
tion system accurately centered. Even under these
conditions you cannot obtain Gaussian conditions for

<p>every possible beam size. For example, there may be
six different C1 lens excitations, each of which gives a
different calculated beam size, but there are invariably
fewer than six C2 apertures available, so each beam size
cannot be correctly apertured; spherical-aberration (Cs)
effects will broaden the beam size beyond a true
Gaussian (see Chapter 6). If you select too small an
aperture, then the intensity distribution will be trun-
cated at a fraction of the full Gaussian curve. If you
use too large an aperture, the actual beam will extend
out well beyond the calculated size and this has very
important implications for XEDS in the TEM as we
describe in Section 33.3.A.
</p>
<p>To make a complete calculation of the beam size, we
assume that it is determined by an initial Gaussian
diameter at the gun (dg). This diameter is broadened
by the effects of spherical aberration in the beam-form-
ing lens (ds) and diffraction at the final aperture (dd). All
these terms can be added in quadrature (although for no
better reason than that it seems reasonable) to give a
total, calculated beam size, dt

<p>where Cs is the spherical-aberration coefficient, which
we discuss in detail in Chapter 6. This is the full diameter
containing 100% of the beam current. Clearly, this term
is not Gaussian unless the beam is correctly apertured,
which, as we just discussed, is not always possible. How-
ever, Cs correction is now available in probe-forming
TEMs and then, of course, this contribution to the beam
broadening goes away. The calculated diameter due to
diffraction is

these definitions clearly do not define the same
diameter of the electron distribution, the summation
in quadrature is still assumed to give a first approxima-
tion of the FWHM of the beam. Figure 5.10
shows the result of calculations of the three
contributions to the beam diameter in a VG HB501

measurements carried out, as we&rsquo;ll now describe.

<p>Given all the (somewhat inaccurate) assumptions
we made, the agreement with experiment is quite
reasonable.
</p>
<p>5.5.D Measuring the Beam Diameter
</p>
<p>Given the uncertainties in the calculation of the probe
size which we just described, it would seem much more
reliable to measure d experimentally. To measure the
beam size in a TEM you must form an image of the
beam on the viewing screen or computer display under
conditions where you know, or can calibrate the
magnification. This is a non-trivial exercise and you
may need to consult the manufacturer&rsquo;s handbook to
be sure that you are doing it correctly. You can then
photograph the beam and determine the intensity
distribution from a microdensitometer trace across
the film, or an electronic scan across the readout from
the CCD detector (see Chapter 7) as shown in Figure
5.11.What you&rsquo;ll learn later on in Chapter 9 is that the
first-condenser lens (C1) is responsible for controlling
the beam size (and hence the current) and that is
why different settings of C1 are mentioned in Figures
5.10&ndash;5.12. From Figure 5.11 a couple of important
points can be drawn
</p>
<p>&amp; The FWHM contains 50% of the integrated inten-
sity. It is the value used by the manufacturers when
they calculate beam sizes. It is also the important
dimension when considering the effect of d on the
(S)TEM image resolution.
</p>
<p>&amp; The full width at tenth maximum (FWTM) contains
90% of the integrated intensity. It is a more relevant
dimension generally because the Faraday cup (or
any probe-current measuring method) measures the
current in the total beam, which is much closer in size
to the FWTM. This dimension is also more relevant
to measurement of the XEDS spatial resolution.
(Think about it and see Chapter 36 later.)
</p>
<p>When you insert the beam diameter in the brightness
equation, either the FWHM or the FWTM can be used.
The FWTM is equal to 1.82 � FWHM and this is also
shown in Figure 5.9. You should note, therefore, that
you overestimate b if you use the smaller FWHM.
</p>
<p>In a dedicated STEM you can&rsquo;t image the beam
directly, since there are no post-specimen lenses to mag-
nify its image, no screen on which to project it, and no
photographic film to record it. The value of d must be
determined indirectly, as in other scanning instruments.
The worst method (apart from all the rest) involves
scanning the beam across a knife-edge specimen and
monitoring the intensity change that occurs, for exam-
ple, by recording the output from the annular dark-field
detector (see Chapter 9). The specimen should be
atomically sharp and not transparent to electrons until
right at the edge. Such specimens don&rsquo;t exist. This
approach yields an integrated intensity profile, as
shown in Figure 5.12. In order to extract a value of the
FWHM or FWTM from the profile, you must make
measurements between various points determined by
integrating the intensity from one side of a two-dimen-
sional Gaussian to the other. Nevertheless, the two
experimental beam-size measurements in Figure 5.10
show reasonable agreement with the values calculated
from the brightness equation. The measurement of d is
clearly not a simple procedure.
</p>
<p>5.5.E Energy Spread
</p>
<p>Remember that the energy spread (DE) of the electron
beam is a measure of the temporal coherency. This
spread is important in EELS and, in fact, the only way
to measure the energy spread is to use an electron spec-
trometer. Under conditions where the spectrometer
itself is not limiting the resolution of the spectrum, the
value of DE can be simply measured by collecting a
spectrum of electrons without a specimen in the way of
the beam as we describe in Section 37.3.C. The spectrum
then consists of a single Gaussian peak and the resolu-
tion of the spectrum is defined as the FWHM of this
peak. Typical values of DE for the various electron

&lt;�100 meV.
</p>
<p>5.5.F Spatial Coherency
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult tomeasure the coherency of the beam experi-
mentally although, as we&rsquo;ve discussed, small sources
ensure spatial coherency. One practical way ofmeasuring
the coherency is to form an image of the edge of a hole in
a specimen such as a thin holey carbon film. When you
operate slightly out of focus you see alternating dark and
bright fringes called Fresnel fringes as shown in Figure
5.13A. Typically, for a thermionic source, only one or
two fringes are visible. These fringes are a phase-contrast
effect (which we cover in great detail in Part 3). We can
also use the fringes to correct astigmatism in the objective
lens, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 6. The number of visible
fringes is a measure of the beam coherency and Figure
5.13B shows the enormous number that can be generated
by a FEG.
</p>
<p>5.6 WHAT kV SHOULD YOU USE?
</p>
<p>For the materials scientist and nanotechnologist, this is
usually an easy question to answer: we&rsquo;ll call it the kV
axiom.
</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions to this axiom and the
most obvious is avoiding knock-on beam damage, but
we&rsquo;ll see others later in the book. So don&rsquo;t forget that
you can always operate a modern 300-kV TEM at
100 kV. It&rsquo;s like being able to change the wavelength
of a monochromatic light source in a visible-light
microscope. As we saw in Chapter 4, the threshold
for displacement damage for most metals is less than
400 kV, which is the highest available voltage on &lsquo;off-
the-shelf&rsquo; TEMs. For lighter and more beam-sensitive
materials such as some ceramics and polymers, lower
kV may be better. For most materials specimens, there
is not much use going below 100 kV since the images
will be rather dim and you&rsquo;ll have to make very thin
specimens to see anything useful. However, when
studying a crystalline specimen by diffraction contrast,
100 kV is better than 200 kV is better than 300 kV,
providing you can still see through the specimen! For
biological specimens, there is significant advantage to
the increased contrast available in lower-kV images
and STEM in (30-kV) SEMs is an increasingly useful
imaging tool.

trace.
</p>
<p>THE kV AXIOM
You should always operate at the maximum avail-
able kV (unless you shouldn&rsquo;t).

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Apart from these exceptions, the reasons for choos-
ing the highest kV are
</p>
<p>&amp; The gun is brightest so you get the most signal to put
into your specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; The wavelength is shortest; the image resolution is
potentially better.
</p>
<p>&amp; The cross section for elastic scatter is also reduced so
beam broadening is reduced and analytical spatial
resolution is enhanced.
</p>
<p>&amp; The cross section for inelastic scatter is smaller, so
heating effects may be smaller.
</p>
<p>&amp; You can &lsquo;see&rsquo; through thicker specimens.
&amp; The peak to background ratio in X-ray spectra is
improved (see Chapter 36).

<p>When you&rsquo;ve learned about EFTEM later on, return
to this chapter and ask: why not 80 kV?
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Most TEMs use LaB6 thermionic sources. Take care when heating and cooling your LaB6
crystal; always operate just below saturation to maximize the lifetime of the source and
(almost) always operate at the highest kV. If you&rsquo;re doing high-resolution work of any kind,
find a FEG TEM and for high-resolution imaging, then the degree of coherency is impor-
tant too. If you&rsquo;re doing XEDS, get some idea of the beam current that you can get from
your FEG under typical operating conditions. Also measure the beam size and convergence
angle to give a measure of b. If you&rsquo;re doing EELS then the energy spread is essential
information and you may need to find one of the rare, monochromated TEMs. Treat your
source particularly carefully if your TEM is of such a vintage that you have to change it,
align it, saturate it, or switch it off. There&rsquo;s nothing more annoying than losing your source
since it usually happens at some critical point during your work. Fortunately, computer
control is making such events much rarer.

<p>SOME HISTORY
</p>
<p>Why include a note on history? Because you should/will study old papers. The sources used in the 1950s
</p>
<p>and 1960s were so-called W hairpins. The simple hairpins were replaced by pointed W filaments (hairpins
</p>
<p>with an atom-probe-like tip attached). In the 1970s, LaB6 filaments replaced W as more efficient emitters.
</p>
<p>Other materials might be more efficient, but. . . In the late 1980s, FEGs began to be used in several labs. By
</p>
<p>the 2000s, these are the sources of choice, especially for those who can afford them. So, we are back to the
</p>
<p>pointed filament. Now, consider how the TEM techniques had to be different in those old papers.

<p>Lenses, Apertures, and Resolution
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Electron lenses are the TEM&rsquo;s equivalent of the glass lenses in a visible light microscope
(VLM) and, to a large extent, we can draw comparisons between the two. For example, the
behavior of all the lenses in a standard TEM can be approximated to the action of a convex
(converging) glass lens on monochromatic light. The lens is basically used to do two things
</p>
<p>&amp; Take all the rays emanating from a point in an object and recreate a point in an image
&amp; Focus parallel rays to a point in the focal plane of the lens
</p>
<p>The lens can&rsquo;t collect all the rays from the object and we often deliberately limit the
collection angle with an aperture. We can draw ray diagrams showing how electron lenses
control beams of electrons. These diagrams correspond directly to the ray diagrams used in
physical optics. Of course the analogy with light fails for certain aspects, but basically it will
pervade this chapter. So we&rsquo;ll start by reminding you of the principles of light optics insofar
as they relate to electron optics. Then we&rsquo;ll discuss the electron lens in more detail, showing
how an electron behaves as it passes through such a lens. We&rsquo;ll describe some actual lenses
and tell you how we use different kinds of electron lenses to do different things in the
microscope.
</p>
<p>A major limit to the use of electron lenses is the fact that we aren&rsquo;t very good at making
them. They suffer from rather severe spherical and chromatic aberrations which we usually
control by inserting limiting apertures to select electrons nearest to the optic axis since these
are least affected by the lens aberrations. Recent technical developments have permitted
these aberrations to be largely overcome, but aberration-corrected TEMs are both rare and
expensive; most microscopists still have to live with these limitations. So you need to
understand lens aberrations, since they play a major role in deciding what we can and
cannot do with the microscope. In particular, lens aberrations (rather than the wavelength
of the electrons) limit the resolution of the TEM (unlike in the VLM). Since resolution is
often the single most important reason for buying a TEM, you need a firm understanding of
this concept. Unfortunately, we electron microscopists aren&rsquo;t always very precise in our
definitions of resolution. Finally, we describe how the apertures we use aid both the depth of
field and the depth of focus of the instrument.
</p>
<p>6.1 WHY LEARN ABOUT LENSES?
</p>
<p>Why should we learn about electron lenses? As in a
VLM, the lenses in a TEM control all the basic opera-
tional functions of the instrument. As you are well
aware, we have to physically move glass lenses up and
down in a VLM to control the intensity of the illumina-
tion and to focus the image. The focal length of a glass
lens is fixed so we have to change lenses to change the
magnification. We choose stronger lenses for higher
magnification. By contrast, in a TEM, the positions of
</p>
<p>the lenses are fixed but we can change the strength of the
lens at will.
</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll see, in most cases the lenses we use are
electromagnetic, so we change their strength by
</p>
<p>CHANGING THE LENS
We change focus, change the intensity of illumination
or change magnification by changing the strength of
the lenses.
</p>
<p>6 .1 WHY LEARN ABOUT LENSES ? .......................................................................................................................................................... 91</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>changing the current through a coil around a soft-iron
core which changes the strength of the resultant mag-
netic field. Almost any operation we carry out on the
TEM involves changing magnification or focus; we use
electron lenses to magnify and focus the electron beam,
the images, and the DPs.
</p>
<p>These factors are critical in the principal functions
of a TEM: imaging, diffraction, and analysis which,
respectively, comprise the next three parts of this book.
An aperture is used to select different electron beams to
form different images, thus manipulating the image
contrast. Another aperture is used to select different
regions of the specimen to contribute to the DP as
we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>So knowing how these aperture/lens combinations
work allows you to understand how we control the
TEM and why we do certain operations on the
microscope.
</p>
<p>An understanding of electron lenses will help us to
answer such questions as
</p>
<p>&amp; Why can we see finer detail with an electron micro-
scope than with a light microscope?
</p>
<p>&amp; Why can&rsquo;t we see as much detail as we might expect
from physics?
</p>
<p>&amp; Why does the TEM have a better depth of field and
depth of focus than the VLM?
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see that the answers to these questions lie in
the quality of the lenses, and how we use them. In this
chapter we&rsquo;ll discuss the basics of how a lens/aperture
combination works. Throughout the book you&rsquo;ll
come across different uses and combinations of lenses
and apertures. So this is a central chapter for the
serious microscope operator but it is only an intro-
duction to the important aspects of electron optics,
which is a field in itself. For this you need to explore
Chapter 2 in the companion text and the electron-
optics texts in the references. Apart from the tremen-
dous advances brought about by aberration correc-
tion, electron optics is relatively static these days but
traditional light optics is undergoing a renaissance
from which electron optics can only benefit. If you
are interested you should consult any of the optics
textbooks that we referenced back in Chapter 2 and
check out URL #1.
</p>
<p>6.2 LIGHT OPTICS AND ELECTRON
OPTICS
</p>
<p>You are already familiar with the action of a magnifying
glass lens on light rays. The magnifying glass is a convex
lens. It can be used in two ways to control the light rays
coming through it. First, it can produce a magnified
image of the object you&rsquo;re looking at. Second, it can
focus a parallel beam of light to a point, in the focal
plane of the lens. (Whenyounger, we&rsquo;ve all used this latter
property to set something or someone on fire by focusing
the (parallel) sun&rsquo;s rays.) These two actions, forming an
image of an object and focusing parallel rays to a point,
are all we need in order to understand how the lenses in a
TEM work. The reason that we can get away with this
simple approach is because the electron lenses act, to a
reasonable approximation, like convex glass lenses; in
detail they&rsquo;re often equivalent tomore complex combina-
tions of convex lenses and aberration correction involves
the equivalent of a divergent or concave lens. We intro-
duce the practical use of lenses in the TEM in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>6.2.A How to Draw a Ray Diagram
</p>
<p>In traditional light optics it&rsquo;s customary to drawdiagrams
of the paths of light rays through the lens and these ray
diagrams are usually drawn horizontally because the tra-
ditional optical bench on which light-optical experiments
are carried out is a horizontal setup. Likewise, we draw
diagrams of the electron trajectories through electron
lenses but, since the TEM is a vertical instrument, we
will draw all our ray diagrams vertically assuming the
gun is at the top of the column of lenses (although this
isn&rsquo;t invariably so, as we describe in Chapter 9).
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by drawing ray diagrams to illustrate the
two fundamental lens actions of image formation and
the focusing of parallel rays. In these and all subsequent
diagrams we&rsquo;ll draw all the lenses in the TEM as convex
lenses. We will draw all electron ray paths as straight
lines outside the lens, and we&rsquo;ll start by assuming that the
lenses are perfect. We&rsquo;ll also draw the lenses as so-called
&lsquo;thin&rsquo; lenses, which means their thickness is small com-
pared to their radii of curvature. Actually, we&rsquo;ll make the
lenses very thin. We&rsquo;ll see that these assumptions are all
precisely wrong, yet sufficiently reasonable that tradi-
tional ray diagrams are nonetheless very useful.
</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to have a base line on
which to draw our diagrams; this line is called the optic
axis (also called the rotation axis in the TEMbecause, as
you&rsquo;ll learn, the electrons actually rotate through the
lens even thoughwe draw the ray paths as straight lines).
</p>
<p>APERTURES
We use apertures in the lenses to control the diver-
gence or convergence of electron paths through the
lenses which, in turn, affects the lens aberrations and
controls the current in the beam hitting the specimen.
</p>
<p>THE OPTIC AXIS
An imaginary line down the column of the TEM
passing through the center of each lens.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Now the first action of a lens that we want to show is
how it produces an imageof anobject. In aTEMtheobject
will usually be the specimen itself or an image of it, but it
may also be the electron source, which is an object for the
illumination system. If we assume the object is a point and
the radiation is emanating fromthatpoint (a so-called &lsquo;self-
luminous object&rsquo;), then a perfect lens will gather a fraction
of that radiation and form a point image. This action is
shown in Figure 6.1 in which the point is on the optic axis.
The fraction of the rays from the object gathered by the
lens is an important variable, defined by the angle b in
Figure 6.1. Ultimately, as you can see, b is governed by the
size of the lens, but we often choose to limit b by inserting
an aperture, as we&rsquo;ll discuss later in this chapter. You&rsquo;ll
often see the angle of collection defined as a, but we will
reserve a for convergence angles (see Section 2.7). From
now on, as we did in earlier chapters, we&rsquo;ll talk about
angles when we actually mean semi-angles.
</p>
<p>However, as you know from Chapters 2 to 4, most
electrons are strongly forward scattered, so we can in
practice gather a high fraction of the scattered electrons.
</p>
<p>The angles in Figure 6.1 and in the other ray dia-
grams we&rsquo;ll draw are all greatly exaggerated.
</p>
<p>If the object has a finite size, we can illustrate this by
an arrow, asymmetrically positioned with respect to the
optic axis, as in Figure 6.2. Then the lens creates an
image of the arrow, rotated by 1808. To draw this figure,
the first step is to draw line 1 from the arrowhead
through the center of the lens, because rays crossing
the optic axis in the lens (or on-axis rays which travel
down the axis) are not affected by the lens at all and
remain as a straight line.
</p>
<p>The second step is to draw line 2 which is a ray from
the arrowhead that is parallel to the optic axis.We could
draw such a ray from any point along the arrow and the
further away rays are from the optic axis, the more
strongly they are bent by a convex lens. So we take line
</p>
<p>FIGURE 6.1. Image formation by a convex lens. A point object is imaged
</p>
<p>as a point and the collection angle of the lens is defined relative to the object
</p>
<p>(b) or the image (a).
</p>
<p>LENSES ARE FINITE
All lenses are imperfect insofar as they cannot gather
all the radiation emitted by an object and so can never
create a perfect image.
</p>
<p>EXAGGERATE ANGLES
In practice, a typical value of b is maybe a few tens of
milliradians (10mrad� 0.578) so if the diagramswere
drawn to scale they would be many times longer than
they were wide and all the ray paths would be exceed-
ingly narrow. Since drawing to scale is impractical,
we always exaggerate the angles considerably in all
electron ray diagrams.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 6.2. How todrawa raydiagram: first construct ray path#1 through
</p>
<p>the middle of the lens, then draw ray path #2 (initially parallel to the
</p>
<p>optic axis) to determine the lens strength. Where path #2 intersects the
</p>
<p>optic axis defines the focal plane.
</p>
<p>6 .2 L IGHT O PT IC S AND ELECTRON O PT IC S .......................................................................................................................................... 93</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2 and bend it toward the optic axis as it passes through
the lens. We can choose to make the lens as strong as we
wish, and the strength determines how much the ray
is bent and where lines 1 and 2 meet to recreate an
image of the arrowhead. Where ray path 2 intersects
the optic axis (and thus intersects a ray path along the
axis) defines the focal plane of the lens and thus illus-
trates the second fundamental action of a convex lens,
i.e., the lens brings rays that are initially parallel to a
focus.
</p>
<p>Some important points on electromagnetic lenses
</p>
<p>&amp; The strength of the lens determines where the paral-
lel electrons are focused: stronger lenses having
shorter focal lengths.
</p>
<p>&amp; The focal plane is where initially parallel rays inter-
sect after passing through the lens.
</p>
<p>&amp; The image formed by the lens is rotated by 1808 with
respect to the object.
</p>
<p>Now a full ray diagram for an object of finite size,
symmetrically positioned about the axis, combines aspects
ofFigures6.1and6.2, as shown inFigure6.3. InFigure6.3,
all rays from a point in the object are brought back to a
point in the image and all parallel rays (whether parallel to
the optic axis or not) are brought to a focus in a plane at a
position depending on their angle to the axis.
</p>
<p>Note that on-axis parallel rays are focused on axis
and off-axis parallel rays are focused off axis.
</p>
<p>This is a most important property, since it allows the
lens to create DPs in the focal plane. We&rsquo;ll use this
diagram to introduce you to the principal terms used
in lens optics.
</p>
<p>6.2.B The Principal Optical Elements
</p>
<p>From the above diagrams, we can define several principal
planes to which we will often refer. The first plane is the
planeof the lens. Ina thin lens this plane canbe imaginedas
a line through the middle of the lens. The object plane is
the plane containing the object point in Figure 6.1 or the
object arrow in Figures 6.2 and 6.3. The object plane
always lies above the lens in question in the diagrams in
this text. The image plane (sometimes called theGaussian-
image plane) is the plane containing the image point or
arrow and it always lies below the lens. These two planes
</p>
<p>are said to be conjugate, whichmeans optically equivalent.
Rays leaving a point in one plane are brought to a
point (if the lens is perfect) in a conjugate plane and
vice versa. In other words, the electron doesn&rsquo;t care
which way it goes through the lens and this is the
basis for the theorem of reciprocity which we&rsquo;ll dis-
cuss when we compare TEM and STEM imaging in
Chapter 9. The focal plane of the lens is the plane in
which the parallel rays are brought to a focus as
shown in Figures 6.2 and 6.3. In the image-forming
process in a TEM, the focal plane lies after or
&lsquo;behind&rsquo; the lens and so the plane is sometimes
called the back-focal plane (BFP). There is also an
equivalent front-focal plane (FFP) and a convex lens
would take all the rays coming from a point in the
front-focal plane and create a parallel beam of
radiation, in exactly the reverse manner to Figures
6.2 and 6.3.
</p>
<p>6.2.C The Lens Equation
</p>
<p>From the above diagrams we can define three important
distances, labeled in Figure 6.3: the distance from the
object plane to the lens (the object distancedo), the distance
fromthe lens to the imageplane (the imagedistancedi), and
the distance from the lens to the back-focal plane (the focal

<p>(distance do from the lens) that are gathered by the lens converge to a point in
</p>
<p>the image (distance di from the lens) and all parallel rays coming from the
</p>
<p>object are focused in the focal plane (distance f from the lens).
</p>
<p>FOR A THIN LENS
A fundamental principle of how a lens works is that
an electron passing through the middle of the lens is
unaffected so we can draw its path as a straight line.
All other electron paths are bent when they pass
through the lens.

<p>length f).Now if the lens is symmetric in strength either side
of the lens plane (i.e., the front and back-focal planes are
the same distance from the lens) then we can write the
following basic equation
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>f
&frac14;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>do
&thorn;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>d i
(6:1)
</p>
<p>which is known as Newton&rsquo;s lens equation. You&rsquo;ll find a
proof in any standard optics text (several were refer-
enced back in Chapter 2). The distances do and di are
measured from the two different principal planes in a
thick lens, but from the same plane in the middle of a
thin lens, which we are assuming here. In all cases that
we&rsquo;ll consider, the object distance (and therefore the
image distance) is greater than the focal length. Thus a
real image is produced on the other side of the lens
beyond the back-focal plane. If the object were within
the (front) focal length, then a virtual image would be
produced on the same side of the lens as the object, and
this is often the case in light optics. Since we don&rsquo;t deal
with virtual images in the TEM we&rsquo;ll ignore this aspect.
</p>
<p>6.2.D Magnification, Demagnification, and
Focus
</p>
<p>We can use Newton&rsquo;s lens equation to define the mag-
nification of a convex lens as
</p>
<p>M &frac14;
di
</p>
<p>do
(6:2)
</p>
<p>M is also approximately equal to the ratio of the collec-
tion angles of the lens subtended at the object (b) and at
the image (a) as shown in Figure 6.1, assuming that
these angles are small, as they invariably are in a
TEM. In this example the magnification is unity.
</p>
<p>Nowwemay sometimes want to demagnify an object
(for example, whenwe want to form a small image of the
electron source, to create the smallest possible probe at
the specimen). If that is the case, we define the demag-
nification as 1/M. In a VLM we could change the
</p>
<p>magnification by moving the object relative to the lens
or vice versa, and adjusting our eyes accordingly, but
generally we rotate in another objective lens of different
strength (curvature). In a TEM we change magnifica-
tion in this latter way by changing the strength of the
lens, but you&rsquo;ll see that we can do this without changing
the lens itself. So electron lenses differ fundamentally
from glass lenses in that one lens can be adjusted to a
range of strengths.
</p>
<p>If we make the lens stronger, then the focal length is
shortened as shown in Figure 6.4. If f is shortened but do
is unchanged, then di must be correspondingly shorter
and the image magnification is smaller, or the demagni-
fication is larger.
</p>
<p>How do we get the high magnifications that we need
to form images of atomic columns such as Figure 1.2?
Since, as you&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 9, we tend to operate the
objective lens of the TEM at a fixed strength, we move
the object plane close to the lens thus making do small
and M correspondingly large (see equation 2). We then
make the image plane of the first lens, the object plane
for the next lens and repeat this for several lenses in
tandem one after the other. So we end up with a multi-
lens system like a compound VLM. We&rsquo;ll discuss many
more details of lens combinations in the illumination
and imaging systems of the TEM in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>Now, in principle, there&rsquo;s nothing to stop us magni-
fying as much as we wish. However, above a certain
magnification, we will see no more information because

</p>
<p>STRENGTH VERSUS MAGNIFICATION
Under conditions normally found in the TEM, strong
lenses magnify less and demagnify more. In VLMs
stronger lenses produce greater magnifications.
</p>
<p>THE PLANES
The principal planes of a lens comprise the object,
image and focal planes.

<p>other factors limit the image detail and therefore the
resolution of the microscope. We&rsquo;ll discuss this point
later in Section 6.6. We&rsquo;ll also see that there are times
when we want to look at an image of the focal plane
(because this contains the DP). To do this, the back-
focal plane of the upper lens must become the object
plane for the subsequent lenses in the imaging system.
</p>
<p>When discussing the focus of images we need
another convention because we&rsquo;ll find that there is
much useful information to be gained and certain
technical advantages to operating out of focus. This
situation is somewhat different to almost any other
form of microscopy wherein out-of-focus images are
generally less useful or, more likely, completely use-
less. However, in TEM we need to define the follow-
ing two conditions relative to the plane in which a
focused image is formed
</p>
<p>&amp; If the lens strength is increased such that the image
forms above (i.e., before the rays get to) the image
plane, then the image will be out of focus and we say
the lens is overfocused.
</p>
<p>&amp; If the lens is weakened and the image forms below
(i.e., after) the image plane, the image will be out of
focus and the lens is said to be underfocused.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to confuse these two terms unless you
think in terms of the vertical frame of the microscope as
shown in Figure 6.5. One point to note from Figure 6.5,
which we&rsquo;ll find useful, is that the electrons are closer to
being parallel to the optic axis when the lens is under-
focused than when it is overfocused.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll exploit underfocused imaging conditions on
many occasions in the future. We&rsquo;ll also find there are
times when we should operate with our DPs out of focus
and also get different information to when it is in focus.
So even dexterously challenged TEM operators or those
with aging eyes can still do well!
</p>
<p>6.3 ELECTRON LENSES
</p>
<p>Electrons were first successfully focused by Busch in
1927; he used an electromagnet of the sort that Ruska
later incorporated into the first TEM shown in Figure
1.1. Busch also showed that it was possible to focus
electrons using electrostatic fields and we&rsquo;ve already
seen how this works in thermionic electron guns in Chap-
ter 5. In practice, magnetic lenses are superior in many
respects, particularly because they are not susceptible to
high-voltage breakdown. The TEMs that we&rsquo;re discuss-
ing in this text all use magnetic lenses, so we won&rsquo;t discuss
electrostatic lenses further here but they are examined in
the companion text.
</p>
<p>6.3.A Polepieces and Coils
</p>
<p>To make a magnetic electron lens we need two parts.
Both are drawn schematically in cross section in
Figure 6.6. First there is a cylindrically symmetrical core
of soft magnetic material such as soft iron, with a hole
drilled through it. We call this soft iron a polepiece and
the hole is called the bore of the polepiece. (Soft refers to
themagnetic not themechanical behavior.) Inmost lenses
there are two polepieces (upper and lower), which can be
part of the same piece of soft iron as in Figure 6.6 or they
may be two separate pieces. The distance between the
polepiece faces is called the gap and the bore-to-gap ratio
is another important characteristic of such lenses, con-
trolling the focusing action of the lens. Some polepieces
are machined to a cone shape; the cone angle is then an
important variable in the lens performance.
</p>
<p>The second part of the lens is a coil of copper wire
which surrounds each polepiece. When we pass a current
through the coil, a magnetic field is created in the bore.
</p>

tron beam. Remember a1 and a2 are very small.

Don&rsquo;t confuse the two.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This field is inhomogeneous along the length of the lens,
but axially symmetric. It is the strength of the field in a
magnetic lens that controls the electron trajectories or
ray paths. As you can see, the electron path through the
lens is a reasonable approximation to the schematic dia-
gram back in Figure 6.1.
</p>
<p>The resistive heating of the coil means that the lenses
have to be cooled and a water recirculating system is an
essential part of TEM lenses. A real lens removed from
the column of a TEM is shown in Figure 6.7.
</p>
<p>6.3.B Different Kinds of Lenses
</p>
<p>The principles that we&rsquo;ve just described are incorporated
into different kinds of lenses used in the TEM. Most
lenses in the microscope are weak lenses with large
gaps. Either they act to demagnify the source image
onto the specimen or they magnify the image or DP
from the specimen and project it onto the viewing screen
or CCD in ways that we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 9. Typically
these lenses are of the sort shown schematically in Figure
6.6. An aperture can be introduced into the bore of the
lens, as we&rsquo;ll discuss later.
</p>
<p>Compared to the other lenses in a TEM, the objective
lens is a very strong lens. Several types exist, depending on
the needs of the particular TEM. The most flexible objec-
tive lens is that in which the upper and lower polepieces
are separated and have their own coils as shown in
Figure 6.8A. This geometry gives the space needed to
allow us to insert both the specimen and the aperture
between the polepieces. With this type of polepiece, other
instruments such as X-ray spectrometers can have rela-
tively easy access to the specimen. For the same reason, it
is straightforward to design specimen holders that do a
variety of tasks such as tilting, rotating, heating, cooling,
straining, etc. This versatility accounts for the popularity of
the split-polepiece lens inTEMs.
</p>
<p>With split polepieces it is possible from to make the
upper polepiece behave differently from the lower pole-
piece. The most common application of this is to excite
the upper-objective polepiece very strongly. This kind of
(asymmetrical) lens is ideal for an AEM/STEM because
it can produce both the necessary broad beam of elec-
trons for TEM and a fine beam of electrons for AEM
and STEM. We&rsquo;ll see how this is accomplished in more
detail in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>If high resolution is a major requirement, then we&rsquo;ll
see that it is essential to keep the focal length of the
objective lens short and this means a very strong lens is
</p>
<p>FIGURE 6.6. Schematic diagram of a magnetic lens. The soft-iron pole-
</p>
<p>pieces sit in the hole down the middle of the lens and are surrounded by the
</p>
<p>copper coils through which the current runs to magnetize the polepieces.
</p>
<p>When viewed in cross section, the bore and the gap between the polepieces
</p>
<p>are visible. The magnetic field is weakest on axis and increases in strength
</p>
<p>toward the sides of the polepiece, so the more the electrons travel off axis
</p>
<p>the more strongly they are deflected.
</p>
<p>PRACTICAL HINT
You should be able to get a readout (on the TEM
computer display) of the current through any lens
coil. It is a useful thing to know the standard lens
currents for your common operating modes such as
imaging and diffraction and for creating various
beam sizes.
</p>

</p>
<p>to magnetize the polepieces, and cooling water is circulated in and out of
</p>
<p>the two holes in the top plate of the lens to dissipate the resistive
</p>
<p>heat generated in the coils. Compare this picture with the schematic in

<p>needed. This is traditionally accomplished by using an
immersion lens. The specimen is dropped into (i.e.,
immersed in) the center of the lens field as shown in
Figure 6.8B. In such a top-entry stage the specimen is
surrounded by the objective lens and so it is a more
difficult engineering feat to manipulate, heat or cool
the specimen and it is not possible to get X-ray detectors
near the specimen, so analytical microscopy is very
inefficient. If the focal length is kept really short to
give the highest resolution, then it becomes difficult to
tilt the specimen more then a few degrees. So in the
highest-resolution TEMs you can&rsquo;t do much apart
from imaging and diffraction over a restricted range of
tilt (see Chapter 8 on stages). This limitation can be
overcome by designs such as the snorkel lens as shown
in Figure 6.8C, which is a single polepiece lens with a
small bore to give a strong lens. Spherical-aberration
correction also reduces the need to have the strong
</p>
<p>lenses for high resolution, so larger gaps are feasible in
aberration-corrected TEMs without compromising
resolution.
</p>
<p>The limitations of ferromagnetic polepieces can be
overcome using superconducting lenses. We cannot
make soft-iron polepieces stronger than their satura-
tion magnetization and this limits the focal length
and the probe-forming capability of the lens. Super-
conducting lenses can overcome these limitations but

<p>THE OBJECTIVE LENS
The most important lens in the TEM. It forms the
images andDPs that aremagnified by the other lenses.
It is also the most difficult to construct since the speci-
men must be located close to the plane of this lens.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>since a superconductor generates a fixed field, it
cannot be varied in the same way as a conventional
ferromagnetic lens and so it is not very flexible.
Periodically there are increased fluxes of papers
describing superconducting lenses because they are
small, they don&rsquo;t need water cooling, and they cool
the area around the specimen which improves the
vacuum, helps minimize contamination, and pre-
serves biological or polymeric specimens. Such lenses
also saw a brief flurry of activity after the discovery
of high-Tc superconductors. These lenses can gener-
ate intense fields (&gt;100 T compared to the maximum
of �2 T in electromagnetic lenses) which are very
promising for forming fine probes with high-energy
electrons (useful in AEM). Superconducting lenses
are so strong that their aberrations (which we&rsquo;ll get
to in Section 6.5) are inherently small and they could
feasibly be used to construct very compact TEMs.
</p>
<p>In addition to these variations on the theme of a
single or double polepiece, it is also possible to design
a quadrupole, sextupole, or octupole lens in which the
focusing action is achieved by four, six, or eight pole-
pieces, respectively. Adjacent polepieces are of opposite
polarity as shown in Figure 6.8D. These lenses are not
used in TEMs as magnifying lenses but are used to
correct lens defects such as astigmatism (see Chapter 9),
are used as lenses in aberration correctors (see
Section 6.5.A) and also in electron energy-loss spectrom-
eters (Chapter 37). These lenses require less power, and
they don&rsquo;t introduce any rotation into the image, which
as we&rsquo;ll now show, is a characteristic of standard, electro-
magnetic lenses.
</p>
<p>6.3.C Electron Ray Paths Through
Magnetic Fields
</p>
<p>We need a bit of mathematics to explain how magnetic
lenses actually work. When an electron with charge
q (= &ndash;e) enters a magnetic field with a strength B (Tesla)
and an electric field of strength E, it experiences a
force F, known as the Lorentz force, which depends on
the velocity of the electron, v. All these factors are related
through the equation
</p>
<p>F &frac14; q&eth;E&thorn; v� B&THORN; &frac14; �e&eth;E&thorn; v� B&THORN; (6:3)
</p>
<p>where the term in parentheses is a vector cross-product.
Since we are not applying an electric field within the lens,
the resulting (Lorentz) force F is a vector normal to v and
B, which are inclined to one another at an angle y. You
can easily work out the relative directions of E, v, B, and
F using the right-hand rule in which your thumb repre-
sents the direction of the force acting on a positive charge
moving in the direction of the middle finger through a
field in the direction of the index finger. So the force on
the electron acts in the opposite direction to your thumb.
</p>
<p>The force on an electron entering a uniform mag-
netic field, nearly 908 to B is
</p>
<p>F &frac14; evB sin y &frac14; evB &frac14;
mv2
</p>
<p>r
(6:4)
</p>
<p>where r is the radial distance of the electron from the
optic axis (sometimes called the cyclotron radius for
historical reasons which you should be able to recog-
nize) andm is the mass of the electron.We can rearrange
equation 6.4 to give an expression for
</p>
<p>r &frac14;
mv
</p>
<p>eB
(6:5)
</p>
<p>Since v is a relativistic velocity, we should write this
equation as
</p>

</p>
<p>� �h i
</p>
<p>eB
</p>
<p>1 2=
</p>
<p>(6:6A)
</p>
<p>where m0 and E0 are the rest mass and energy of the
electron, respectively. This form of the equation allows
us to substitute known constants to estimate r (in
meters)
</p>
<p>r &frac14;

</p>
<p>� �� �1 2=
</p>
<p>B
(6:6B)
</p>
<p>In deriving equation 6.4, we made a rather gross
oversimplification. If y equals 908, the electron is travel-
ing straight down the optic axis and is not focused; in
fact it doesn&rsquo;t even notice that a lens is there! It is the
deviation from y = 908 that gives the lens effect. The
next step, therefore, is to separate the electron velocity v
in a magnetic field into two components, v1 perpendic-
ular to, and v2 parallel to the magnetic-field direction B,
as shown in Figure 6.9, where v1= v sin y and v2= v cos
y. The parallel component, v2, results in motion parallel
to the optic axis in the z direction, with z= v2t, while the
perpendicular component produces circular motion
with a radius given by equation 6.5.
</p>
<p>RIGHT-HAND RULE
Field: Forefinger
Velocity (Speed): Second finger
Thrust: Thumb
</p>
<p>THE FIELD
For V = 100 kV and B=1Tesla, from equation 6.5
the radius, r, is &lt; 1mm.

<p>So all the ray diagrams that we draw ignore this
complicating factor which also explains why the optic
axis is sometime referred to as the rotation axis. The
period of rotation (Tc) through the field gives rise to the

(6:7)
</p>
<p>From these various relationships, we can calculate
the complete ray paths through the lens. The most
important equations are called the paraxial (i.e.,
near-axis) ray equations. These equations determine
both r and the angle of rotation (y) about the axis as
the electron moves around the axis in the direction z:
it rotates under the influence of the rotationally
symmetrical field, B. These equations, which neglect
electron trajectories far off axis, are derived in texts
</p>
<p>on electron optics. As Hawkes succinctly states &lsquo;&lsquo;a
straightforward, but quite lengthy calculation yields&rsquo;&rsquo;

<p>2V1 2=
(6:9)
</p>
<p>whereV is the accelerating voltage of the microscope and
Z is (e/2m0c
</p>
<p>2)1/2. You can see from equation 6.8 that the
rate of change of r along the optic axis is smaller formore
energetic electrons (larger V) and larger for more intense
field strengths (larger B). Likewise, from equation 6.9,
the angular rotation rate increases with increasing field
strength and decreases for more energetic electrons.
</p>
<p>While these conclusions might be intuitively obvious,
the implication is often missed. When we change the
TEM accelerating voltage, we change the lenses in the
microscope! (Think what this would mean in a VLM.)
Therefore, the calibration of the TEM and the lens &lsquo;con-
stants&rsquo; change as we change the kV. Remember the initial
paraxial assumption; we&rsquo;ll use non-paraxial rays to
explain the effect of spherical aberration on resolution
a little later in Section 6.5.A.
</p>
<p>While all these ray equations are approximations,
they form the basis for more detailed mathematical
models of electron motion through lenses (see Chapter
2 in the companion text and URL #2). The more com-
plete models are used in advanced software which simu-
lates the effects of new lens shapes, bore/gap ratios, etc.,
and has permitted significant advances in the design of
lenses to meet the more stringent demands of the latest
TEMs.

becomes less if we do not change the energy, because
the electrons rotate round the axis more often per
unit path length along the axis (z).
</p>
<p>SPIRAL
The electron spirals through the lens field: a helical
trajectory. For electrons with higher keV, we must
use stronger lenses (larger B) to get similar ray paths.

<p>shown on standard ray diagrams. You&rsquo;ll see this effect
as you operate your TEM because the image or DP
rotates on the display screen as you try and focus or if
you change magnification. This rotation may require
calibration as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 9, unless the manufac-
turer has compensated for it by including an extra lens.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen in Figure 6.4 that if we change
the strength of the lens while keeping do fixed, the posi-
tion of the focal plane and the image plane will also
change. Because of this, we have to define a standard
object plane for themain imaging lens of themicroscope
and we call this the eucentric plane. Your specimen
height should always be adjusted to the eucentric plane
because an image of an object in this plane will not move
as you tilt the specimen around the primary tilt axis of
the holder. (The image will still move if you tilt orthog-
onally, unless the TEM stage is completely computer
controlled to compensate for this.) All other planes in
the imaging system are defined with reference to the
eucentric plane.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll tell you much more about this very important
reference plane in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>6.3.E Deflecting the Beam
</p>
<p>There are many occasions during the operation of the
TEM when we want to deflect the beam entering the
lens. We may wish to deflect the beam laterally off axis
or tilt it to a certain angle with respect to the optic axis.
In STEM, these operations are essential to the whole
process of forming a scanning image. It is also useful in
AEM to be able to blank the beam, i.e., deflect it off axis
so it goes into a Faraday cup to measure the current, or
to prevent the beam from hitting the specimen when no
useful spectroscopic data are being gathered. The way
we do this is to apply an electromagnetic field to tilt or
traverse the beam or an electrostatic field to blank it.
Electromagnetic scan times are of the order of millisec-
onds while electrostatic blanking can occur in fractions
of a microsecond.
</p>
<p>Although we are assuming that the lens is thin and
has effectively zero thickness along the optic axis, the
magnetic field actually acts over a lengthL. The angle of
deflection e is (for small e)
</p>
<p>e &frac14;
eLB
</p>
<p>mv
(6:10)
</p>
<p>From this equation we can show that to tilt the beam
by 58 we need a coil carrying about 0.2A and �100
turns applied along a length of 10mm, giving a field
of 0.01 T. For electrostatic blanking we need about
2 kV/mm.
</p>
<p>6.4 APERTURES AND DIAPHRAGMS
</p>
<p>We mentioned earlier that an aperture is often inserted
into a lens. The aperture limits the collection angle (b) of
the lens as shown schematically in Figure 6.10 and such
an aperture in the objective lens allows us to control the
resolution of the image formed by the lens, the depth of
field and the depth of focus, the image contrast, the
collection angle of the electron energy-loss spectrom-
eter, the angular resolution of the DP, and so on. In
other words, this aperture is important! Physically, the
aperture may reside above, in, or below the plane of the
lens as we draw it in ray diagrams (but it doesn&rsquo;t really
matter since the actual effect will be the same and we&rsquo;ve
already seen that the electron doesn&rsquo;t care which way it
is going). Apertures can also perform other functions,
which we&rsquo;ll come across later, such as protecting the
specimen from stray radiation in the illumination sys-
tem, measuring the current in the beam or changing that
current.
</p>
<p>Usually the apertures are circular holes in metal
disks and the disks are made of either Pt or Mo, which
are both refractory metals.
</p>
<p>A quick word on terminology: While the aper-
ture is the hole in the disk, the metal surrounding
the aperture is called the diaphragm (like the vari-
able iris diaphragm in a VLMor your camera).We
use the aperture to allow certain electrons to pass
through the lens and exclude others by causing
them to hit the surrounding diaphragm. This
&lsquo;aperture/diaphragm&rsquo; wording, while strictly cor-
rect English, is a bit cumbersome, andmicroscopists
tend to be lazy and use &lsquo;aperture&rsquo; in both the correct
sense of a hole, but also incorrectly to describe the
action of the diaphragm. So we might say that &lsquo;&lsquo;the
objective aperture was used to exclude high-angle
scattered electrons from the image&rsquo;&rsquo; or, as we indi-
cated above, &lsquo;&lsquo;the aperture protects the specimen
from stray radiation&rsquo;&rsquo; while, strictly speaking, the
diaphragm did the excluding and protecting. We&rsquo;ll
try to be both consistent and correct in our usage of
both terms, but sometimes the precise terminology is
awkward.
Diaphragms come in several forms, depending on
</p>
<p>their function and the particular microscope. They can
be either individual disks, each with a particular aper-
ture diameter, or they can be a series of different aper-
tures in a single metal strip (as shown in Figure 6.10).
The diameter can be as small as 10mm, which is about
</p>
<p>EUCENTRIC PLANE
If your specimen is in the eucentric plane, then the
objective lens strength is always the same when the
image on the screen is in focus.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the smallest circular aperture we can make consistently,
or up to� 0.3mm (300 mm). The individual diaphragms
or the strips are usually a heavy metal such as Mo or Pt
and � 25&ndash;50 mm thick, but if their job is also to prevent
X-rays from hitting the specimen they may be several
millimeters thick (see Chapter 33), which means they
can be quite expensive if they&rsquo;re made of Pt.
</p>
<p>Often the diaphragm collects contamination caused
by the electron beam cracking residual hydrocarbons in
the vacuum (as we describe in Chapter 8). The contam-
ination tends to accumulate on the edges of the aperture,
destroying their circular shape and causing astigmatism.
So the diaphragms need occasional cleaning, which can
be done by heating them to red heat in the central blue
part of a butane flame. In some TEMs, this problem is
eliminated by making the diaphragm from very thin
metal foil (e.g., Au or Mo). The foil gets hot in the
electron beam and any contamination boils off. But
such &lsquo;self-cleaning&rsquo; diaphragms are delicate and often
crack, thus allowing electrons through other gaps,
which defeats the object of the exercise of producing a
well-defined aperture.
</p>
<p>6.5 REAL LENSES AND THEIR PROBLEMS
</p>
<p>It might appear from what we&rsquo;ve discussed so far that
the analogy between electromagnetic lenses and convex
glass lenses is complete, but that is not so. Over the 300
years since van Leeuwenhoek first constructed a light
microscope, glass lenses have developed to a point
where perfect lenses can be fabricated. In the 80 years
since Busch&rsquo;s first magnetic lens, we haven&rsquo;t progressed
so far and our lenses are still very imperfect. We&rsquo;ve
already compared the best electromagnetic lens to the
equivalent of using the bottom of a well-known soft-
drink bottle as a magnifying glass. Another common
description is that if the lenses in your own eyes were as
good as our best electromagnetic lens, then you&rsquo;d be
legally blind! So we have to modify all the ideal ray
diagrams we&rsquo;ve drawn to take into account the imper-
fections of the lenses. These imperfections all limit the
resolution of the microscope but, paradoxically, help us
</p>
<p>A SAFETY NOTE ON X-RAYS
X-rays with energies up to the beam energy are gen-
erated within the lens wherever the electron beam hits
a surface (particularly a limiting diaphragm). So sub-
stantial, carefully designed lead shielding is incorpo-
rated into the column of the TEM to prevent
irradiation of the operator. Obviously, it could be
very dangerous to tamper with the lenses or dia-
phragms of the microscope in any way and only
qualified engineers should dismantle, take apart, or
repair the lenses or remove the diaphragms.

<p>to get better depth of focus and depth of field from the
microscope.
</p>
<p>There are many kinds of lens defects (see Chapter 2
in the companion text) and, at one time or another, the
effects of all the various defects can be seen in an image
or DP. In practice, however, most of us don&rsquo;t need to
know about all of them and we&rsquo;ll emphasize the ones
that limit the microscope performance in substantial
ways. These comprise spherical aberration, chromatic
aberration, and astigmatism.
</p>
<p>6.5.A Spherical Aberration
</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;spherical aberration&rsquo; has almost entered the
popular vocabulary since its presence was discerned in
the main optics of the Hubble Space Telescope (unfor-
tunately after launch). This defect occurs when the lens
field behaves differently for off-axis rays. For our elec-
tromagnetic lenses, the further off axis the electron is,
the more strongly it is bent back toward the axis. As a
result, a point object is imaged as a disk of finite size,
which limits our ability to magnify detail because the
detail is degraded by the imaging process. As we&rsquo;ve told
you many times, we can now correct for this aberration,
but it still limits the resolution of most TEMs so we need
to examine it carefully.
</p>
<p>The effects of spherical aberration are shown in
Figure 6.11. A point object P is imaged at P 0 in the
Gaussian image plane. The image is not a point but is
instead a central high-intensity region surrounded by a
halo of decreasing intensity (similar to Figure 2.11).
Spherical aberration is most important in the objective
lens because it degrades the detail that we can resolve in
TEM images: all the other lenses magnify any error it
introduces. It is equally deleterious in the condenser
lenses in an AEM or STEM which we use to form the
smallest probe with the most current. What we can
accomplish at the resolution limits of all forms of TEM
is almost always limited by spherical aberration; which is
why we&rsquo;re so excited that we can now correct for it.
</p>
<p>From Figure 6.11 you can see why we use the term
&lsquo;spherical&rsquo; to describe the aberration. The effect of
this aberration is to take the curved (spherical) wave-
front from the source and increase the curvature. Now
if you go back and look at Figure 6.9, you&rsquo;ll see that
electrons traveling through a point P on axis intersect
the axis again at point P 0 where the distance PP 0 is
given by
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>So the diameter of the Gaussian image of a point formed
by paraxial rays is given by this expression, which we
will write as
</p>
<p>d &frac14; Csy
3 (6:14)
</p>
<p>where Cs is a constant (a length) for a particular lens
called the spherical aberration coefficient. As you will
have noticed, we often use &lsquo;Cs&rsquo; to mean spherical aber-
ration as in &lsquo;Cs correction,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cs corrector&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cs cor-
rected.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll see in a while that this equation is very
important because of its effect on the resolution of the
TEM and so we need to make a few points of clarifica-
tion here.
</p>
<p>&amp; Equation 6.14 was for paraxial rays only. In a real
TEM, the apertures are usually large enough that
paraxial conditions do not apply and the sharp
image is made more diffuse. As a result the spherically
aberrated Gaussian image under non-paraxial condi-
tions is broadened to a diameter of d = 2Csy
</p>
<p>3 (see
Figure 6.11).
</p>
<p>&amp; You&rsquo;ll often see equation 6.14 written as d= Csy
3M
</p>
<p>when referring to the image plane but because
most discussion of TEM resolution refers back
to the minimum distance that we can resolve in
the object plane (i.e., the specimen) the magnifi-
cation term is sometimes left out and we will use
this approach.
</p>
<p>&amp; When referring to resolution in TEM images it is the
radius of the point that is more important than the
diameter.
</p>
<p>&amp; In a real lens the value of y in equation 6.14 which
describes the angle of the electron to the optic axis is
replaced by the maximum angle of collection of the
(objective-lens) aperture, b.
</p>
<p>So, in the forthcoming discussion of resolution, we&rsquo;ll
use the radius, we&rsquo;ll refer to the object plane, and we&rsquo;ll
use b to define the objective-lens angle of collection.
This latter approach is compared to our use of a when
discussing beam size in Chapter 5, since a defined the
angle of beam convergence. Be careful: many other
TEM texts use a somewhat more indiscriminately for
both collection and convergence angles.
</p>
<p>So we end up with an expression for the radius of
the spherically aberrated disk of intensity rsph in the
Gaussian image plane, referred back to the specimen
plane, under non-paraxial (i.e., realistic) conditions,
given by
</p>
<p>rsph &frac14; Csb
3 (6:15)
</p>
<p>Because b (in radians) is small, then b3 is a very strong
dependence. The units of r and Cs have to be the same
and since Cs is typically a few mm, then we can measure
</p>
<p>r in (very small fractions of) mm. From this derivation
(and linking equations 6.13 and 6.14) you can see thatCs
has the dimensions of length and typically it is approxi-
mately equal to the focal length of the lens, which for
objective lenses in most TEMs is 1&ndash;3 mm, but in high-
resolution instruments may be well below 1 mm (or not,
if they have a Cs corrector).
</p>
<p>If you look at Figure 6.11, you will see that the
smallest dimension of the cone of rays formed by the
lens does not occur at the Gaussian image plane. As we
note in the figure, the smallest dimension is formed at a
plane closer to the lens which goes by the delightful
term &lsquo;plane of least confusion&rsquo; or sometimes &lsquo;plane of
minimum confusion&rsquo;; this disk has a radius of 0.25Csb
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>and a diameter of 0.5Csb
3. As we&rsquo;ll discuss in Section
</p>
<p>6.6.C, some texts use this smaller dimension to define
the resolution limit imposed by spherical aberration
and it is popular with the TEM manufacturers since it
is smaller than the disk in the Gaussian image plane
and thus the resolution of the microscope appears
better!
</p>
<p>The way that a corrector compensates for Cs in a
magnetic lens is in effect to create a diverging (i.e.,
concave) lens which spreads out the off-axis beams
such that they re-converge to a point rather than a
disk in the Gaussian-image plane. In practice this cor-
rection is achieved by a highly complex, computer-
controlled set of quadrupoles and hexapoles or octu-
poles. There are two main approaches to the solution
of Cs correction. The first is due to the work of Rose
and colleagues in Germany embodied in the CEOS
commercial system and is used for both probe correc-
tion in STEMs and image correction in TEMs. The
second is due to Krivanek et al. and is used in Nion
dedicated STEMs and has also been retrofitted to sev-
eral VG STEMs. Figure 6.12 shows schematic ray dia-
grams for the Nion corrector and the CEOS system.
We&rsquo;ll leave a more in-depth discussion of Cs correction
to the companion text.
</p>
<p>6.5.B Chromatic Aberration
</p>
<p>This term is related to the &lsquo;color&rsquo; (i.e., frequency, wave-
length, or energy) of the electrons.We&rsquo;ve assumed so far
that the electrons are monochromatic, but they aren&rsquo;t
really. However, we can make very good high-voltage
</p>
<p>CONFUSION
Beware when reading about TEM image resolution
because of the confusion between the definition that
refers to the Gaussian image plane and that referring
to the plane of least confusion.

<p>supplies and the variation of the electron energy due to
the power supplies is usually smaller than one part in
106, which is 0.1 eV for a 100-keV beam. As we discussed
in Chapter 5, depending on the electron source the actual
energy spread in the beam may vary from �0.3 eV (cold
FEG) to�1 eV (LaB6). This range is still so small that we
generally don&rsquo;t have to worry about chromatic aberra-
tion affecting the image resolution. The exception is if
you happen to have a Cs corrector, in which case, after
compensating for Cs, Cc is the next most-persistent aber-
ration. Lens elements that can correct for Cc are being
developed.
</p>
<p>Chromatic aberration could be almost completely
ignored if we didn&rsquo;t put a specimen into the beam.
Unfortunately, this rather essential action creates elec-
trons of a whole range of energies emerging from the
thin foil (for reasons we described in Chapter 4). The
objective lens bends electrons of lower energy more
strongly and thus electrons from a point in the object
once again are blurred to form a disk in the Gaussian-
image plane (Figure 6.13) (and a smaller disk in the
plane of least confusion). The radius rchr of this disk
(referring to the object plane) is given by

<p>E0
b (6:16)

the lens. Cc, like Cs, is a length, approximately equal to
the focal length. While DE in the incident electron beam

<p>USING A MONOCHROMATOR
Correcting for Cc effects only makes sense if you are
dealing with specimens that are thin enough such that
specimen-induced chromatic effects do not dominate
the resolution. (Correcting Cs is similar.)

<p>6 .5 REAL LENSES AND THE IR PROBLEMS ............................................................................................................................................. 105</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is &lt;�1 eV as we just noted, it is typically 15&ndash;25 eV for a
good fraction of the electrons coming through a typical
50&ndash;100 nm thick foil so, as you can easily calculate, rchr
is quite a large number (compared to atomic dimen-
sions). Chromatic aberration gets worse for thicker spe-
cimens and is better for thinner ones (remember the
almost ubiquitous &lsquo;thinner-is-better&rsquo; criterion). So you
can do something cheaply to minimize the effects of this
aberration; make thin specimens!
</p>
<p>The mechanics of Cc correction depend on whether
we&rsquo;re trying to compensate for beam effects or speci-
men-induced effects. We just reminded you that the
energy range of electrons coming from the gun is gov-
erned by the type of electron source so there are limits
depending on which source you have in your TEM.
Monochromating the source is a (very expensive) solu-
tion. We discuss monochromators at various times in
Chapters 37&ndash;40 on EELS because that is where such
correction pays the greatest dividends.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for the vast majority of TEM studies,
our specimens are not thin enough and, when we have to
live with Cc limitations due to having a thick specimen,
energy-filtering (EF) is the best solution. EFTEM can
correct for the poor resolution that arises when we form
images or DPs with electrons that have lost substantial
amounts of energy in the specimen, as we&rsquo;ll also discuss
in detail in the EELS chapters.
</p>
<p>6.5.C Astigmatism
</p>
<p>Astigmatism occurs when the electrons sense a non-uni-
form magnetic field as they spiral round the optic axis.
This defect arises because we can&rsquo;t machine the soft-iron
polepieces to be perfectly cylindrically symmetrical down
the bore. The soft iron may also have microstructural
inhomogeneities which cause local variations in the mag-
netic field strength. Even if these difficulties were over-
come, the apertures we introduce into the lens may
disturb the field if they are not precisely centered around
the axis. Furthermore, if the apertures are not clean, the
contamination charges up anddeflects the beam. So there
are a variety of contributions to astigmatism, which dis-
torts the image by an amount rast where
</p>
<p>rast &frac14; bDf (6:17)
</p>
<p>and Df is the maximum difference in focus induced by
the astigmatism. Fortunately, astigmatism is easily cor-
rected using stigmators, which are small octupoles that
introduce a compensating field to balance the inhomo-
geneities causing the astigmatism. There are stigmators
in both the illumination (condenser lenses) system and
the imaging system (objective lens) and we&rsquo;ll describe
how to use them in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>In summary, spherical and chromatic aberration and
astigmatism are the three major defects in electromag-
netic lenses. There are several minor defects, such as
barrel and pincushion distortion, which are self-expla-
natory in terms of how they distort the image. They are
occasionally seen at very low magnification where elec-
trons traveling well off axis and close to the bore of the
polepiece appear in the image. Other defects such as coma,
and field curvature we will ignore for now.
</p>
<p>Again, if you want to learn more about any of these
defects they are covered in Chapter 2 in the companion
text.
</p>
<p>6.6 THE RESOLUTION OF THE ELECTRON
LENS (AND ULTIMATELY OF THE TEM)
</p>
<p>Another note on terminology:We electron microscopists
tend to be rather imprecise in our definition and use
of the words &lsquo;resolution&rsquo; and &lsquo;resolving power&rsquo; and
related expressions. We&rsquo;ve borrowed these terms from
classical VLM, which is concerned with the imaging of
incoherent light waves through amplitude contrast.
High-resolution performance in the TEM is a different
matter and traditionally involves phase-contrast ima-
ging of reasonably coherent electron waves, so perhaps
we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a different usage has devel-
oped. But we should at least define the terms we use.

<p>resolving power of the microscope is the ability to
distinguish in the image two points, which are closely
adjacent in the object. The minimum distance apart of
these points in the object is the minimum-resolvable
distance. Since electron microscopists customarily
talk about the resolution of the TEM in terms of
distances in the object (usually a fraction of a nano-
meter), we should then use the term minimum-resol-
vable distance but instead everyone says resolution.
</p>
<p>Because the lens defects that we&rsquo;ve just dis-
cussed cause a point object to degrade into a Gaus-
sian image with a finite radius (some combination of
rsph, rchr, rast) they limit the resolution of the electron
lens, and hence that of the microscope. The image
resolution in the TEM is governed by the ability of
the objective lens to image the object, while in the
STEM the image resolution is governed by how
much beam current we can put into a small probe
which is an image of the electron source demagnified
onto the specimen. In either case, aberrations limit
the resolution.
</p>
<p>6.6.A Theoretical Resolution (Diffraction-
Limited Resolution)
</p>
<p>If there are no aberrations at all, the resolution of any
lens (glass, electromagnetic, electrostatic. . .) is custom-
arily defined in terms of the Rayleigh criterion, which
we introduced back in Equation 1.1 for light optics.
Rayleigh&rsquo;s criterion for resolution is arbitrary in the
sense that it is not a fundamental physical rule but
more a practical definition. This criterion gives us a
figure of merit in terms of our eyes&rsquo; ability to distinguish
separate images of two self-luminous, incoherent point
sources.
</p>
<p>This diffraction results in a point being imaged as a
disk (called the Airy disk) which has a schematic cross
section intensity profile as shown in Figure 6.14A (and
</p>
<p>also in Figure 2.11). This effect should be familiar to
anyone who has encountered basic physical optics. If
the two disks overlap so much that they cannot be
resolved as in Figure 6.14B, then the points in the
object cannot be resolved. Rayleigh assumed that if
the maximum from one source lies over the first mini-
mum from the other source, as shown in Figure 6.14C,
then your eye can discern this dip as two overlapping
images, thus indicating the presence of two separate
objects. Under Rayleigh conditions, when the overall
intensity profile exhibits a dip in the middle that is
above 80% of Imax, the two points cannot be resolved.
The separation of the two incoherent point sources is
then defined as the theoretical resolution of the lens rth
and is given by the radius of the Airy disk, which is
similar in form to equation 1.1
</p>
<p>rth &frac14; 1:22
l
</p>
<p>b
(6:18)
</p>
<p>Any standard text on physical optics (which we&rsquo;ve
already referenced) will show you how to derive this
criterion.
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking we should not use this equation for
electron sources because they are not incoherent. When
dealing with high-resolution images, a different
approach is used (see Chapter 28). But for our intro-
ductory purposes here, we will be content with this
approximation.
</p>
<p>From equation 6.18 we see that we can get higher
resolution if we lower l or increase b. This terminol-
ogy can initially be confusing because, as we just did,
</p>
<p>RESOLUTION AGAIN
We will use the word resolution, but we define it to
mean (usually) the minimum-resolvable distance in
the object!

<p>that they cannot be distinguished, but in (C) the two are separated such
</p>
<p>that the maximum in the image of P1 overlaps the minimum in P2. This
</p>
<p>latter situation is the definition of resolution defined by the Rayleigh
</p>
<p>criterion and is the best (diffraction-limited) resolution.
</p>
<p>POINTS BECOME DISKS
A single point source will not be imaged as a point,
even if no aberrations or astigmatism are present.
The finite size of the lens results in diffraction of the
rays at the outermost collection angle of the lens,
usually defined by the limiting aperture.
</p>
<p>BEWARE!
Sometimes in EM texts you&rsquo;ll find the diameter rather
than the radius is used. Reason: the beam diameter
defines image resolution in STEM and SEM; in
TEM, the radius controls the image resolution.
(Hence the factor 1.22 in equation 5.10.)

<p>6 .6 THE RE SOLUT ION OF THE ELECTRON LENS (AND ULT IMATELY OF THE TEM) .................................................................. 107</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>microscopists often use the expression &lsquo;higher resolu-
tion&rsquo; when in fact they mean &lsquo;better resolution.&rsquo; The
word higher is then associated with a lower number!
It&rsquo;s a smaller r in equation 6.18. It&rsquo;s not just micro-
scopists; a vacuum is also &lsquo;higher&rsquo; if its magnitude is
smaller. The improvement in resolution with lower l
is a major reason why there are intermediate and
high-voltage TEMs since l decreases with keV, as
we saw back in equation 1.6. The obvious question
is, why don&rsquo;t we just increase b (i.e., use a bigger lens
aperture or remove it altogether). Well, we could do
this if we had perfect lenses, but that isn&rsquo;t the case.
All the lens aberrations increase as we increase b (see
equations 6.15&ndash;6.17); which is why Cs correction is
so interesting.
</p>
<p>6.6.B The Practical Resolution Due to Spherical
Aberration
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume first of all that we have corrected for
any astigmatism and our specimen is thin enough
that chromatic aberration is negligible. Under these
circumstances, the spherical aberration error rsph lim-
its the resolution. Now if you go back and look at
equation 6.15 you&rsquo;ll see that rsph increases with the
cube of b, a very strong dependence. The resolution
in the object, then, is given by some combination of
the Rayleigh criterion and the aberration error.
Hawkes gives a particularly clear description of
how this combination leads to a value for the resolu-
tion of the microscope. Since this is very often the
principal figure of merit used when investing hun-
dreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in a
TEM, it is essential that you understand that the
definition is not exact.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start by summing the radii of the Rayleigh
disk and spherical-aberration disk (in the Gaussian
image plane) in quadrature (remember it&rsquo;s radii
for image resolution, diameters for probe-limited
resolutions)
</p>
<p>r &frac14; &eth;r2th &thorn; r
2
sph&THORN;
</p>
<p>1 2=
(6:19)
</p>
<p>Therefore, since both these terms are approximate
</p>
<p>r&eth;b&THORN; �
l
</p>
<p>b
</p>
<p>� 	2
</p>
<p>&thorn; Csb
3
</p>
<p>� �2
</p>
<p>" #1=2
</p>
<p>(6:20)
</p>
<p>Since the two terms vary differently with the aperture
collection angle b, a compromise value exists when the
differential of r(b) with respect to b is set to zero and we
find that
</p>
<p>l2
</p>
<p>b3
� C2sb
</p>
<p>5 (6:21)
</p>
<p>So we come up with an optimum expression for b which
Hawkes (1972) gives as
</p>
<p>bopt &frac14; 0:77
l1 4=
</p>
<p>C
1 4=
s
</p>
<p>(6:22)
</p>
<p>The exact value of the numerical factor depends on
the assumptions made about the various terms included
in the definition of resolution and so is often written
simply asA. Sometimes, this compromise value is deter-
mined by simply equating the equations for rth and rsph
rather than going through the summation in quad-
rature. A quick calculation for 100-keV electrons
(l = 0.0037 nm) for an instrument with Cs = 3mm
gives a bopt value of �4.5mrads.
</p>
<p>If this expression for bopt in equation 6.22 is sub-
stituted into equation 6.20 we get a minimum value
of r(b)
</p>
<p>rmin � 0:91 Csl
3
</p>
<p>� �1 4=
(6:23)
</p>
<p>This is the expression we want; it gives the practical
resolution of the TEM.
</p>
<p>The numerical factor in equation 6.23 is often writ-
ten as B. Typically, the value for rmin is �0.25&ndash;0.3 nm
and the best high-resolution instruments have rmin
�0.1&ndash;15 nm; 1-Å TEMs are about the best available
without Cs correction and about 0.07 nm is (at the
time of writing) the best reported resolution with Cs
correction. So, as we showed back in Figure 1.2, we
can resolve rows of atoms, which in most crystalline
materials have a separation close to rmin (although
low-index planes in some metals are still below this
resolution). It&rsquo;s worth noting that since your eyes can
resolve a distance of�0.2mm, then themaximumuseful
magnification of the best high-resolution TEM is
�3�106. Above this magnification, no more detail will
be revealed.
</p>
<p>Hawkes (1972) reminds us that the decision to add in
quadrature back in equation 6.19 was arbitrary, and
simply summing rth and rsph is another possible way to
determine rmin (as we&rsquo;ll see in Section 28.7). But any way
you combine the two terms for r (or diameter if you&rsquo;re
discussing a probe-limited resolution) leads to expres-
sions that have the same general form as equation 6.22
for bopt and equation 6.23 for rmin. In some cases,A and
B are put equal to unity and not even included, and if
you&rsquo;re not pushing any limits in your calculations or
experiments this latter approach is a very reasonable
approximation.
</p>
<p>As we indicated right at the beginning of our discus-
sion, electron microscopists are rather imprecise in our
definition of the resolution. However, the resolution is
often given as a very precise number!

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.6.C Specimen-Limited Resolution Due
to Chromatic Aberration
</p>
<p>Remember that we assumed in the previous section
that there was no contribution from chromatic aberra-
tion. However, if you have a thick specimen then a
significant number of electrons will lose 15&ndash;25 eV of
energy (a typical value of the most probable (plasmon)
energy loss; see Figure 4.1). If you put 20 eV into the
chromatic-aberration resolution limit given by equation
6.16 you&rsquo;ll find that, at 100 keV with bopt of 4.5 mrads
from equation 6.16, the value of rchr is �2.5 nm.
</p>
<p>If you have a thick specimen, it doesn&rsquo;t matter
what voltage you use or how low your Cs is; it
doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;ve got a 1-MeV TEM or access
to a Cs corrector; you&rsquo;ll have an image resolution in
the 1&ndash;3 nm range and you can see all the available
information in your specimen at a magnification as
little as �105�. In fact, the vast majority of all
recorded TEM images have Cc-limited resolution:
your images will too!
</p>
<p>So how thick is thick? Well, it depends on TEM
voltage and the mean free path for elastic and inelas-
tic scatter in your specimen, which increases with Z
(see Chapter 4). For good high resolution at 100 keV
your specimen should be &lt;� 30 nm, while at 300 keV
you can probably get away with � 50 nm before Cc
effects begin to control resolution, assuming Z &lt;� 30.
So for higher-Z specimens the &lsquo;thinner is better&rsquo;
axiom is even more important. A more restrictive
rule of thumb given by Sawyer and Grubb is
that, for biological and polymeric specimens, the
resolution limit is about one tenth the specimen thick-
ness. As we noted when we first talked about chro-
matic aberration, the solution to this problem is in
your hands (and in Chapter 10).
</p>
<p>6.6.D Confusion in the Definitions
of Resolution
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to the subject, you don&rsquo;t have to read
this section because it may confuse you still further,
but if you&rsquo;ve read other TEM texts you may
have noticed discrepancies in the definitions of
resolution.
</p>
<p>We used the expression for rsph, measured at the
Gaussian-image plane. Strictly speaking, it is only
</p>
<p>under ideal conditions (i.e., if Cs = 0) that we should
use the Gaussian image as a measure of the resolution
limited by the lens and it is only really correct to use the
Gaussian image under paraxial conditions, that is
with a very small objective aperture. As we&rsquo;ve already
noted, in the TEM b is usually large enough that
paraxial conditions do not apply. So the disk in the
plane of least confusion is the relevant feature from
which to define the best image resolution, as shown
back in Figure 6.11.
</p>
<p>If this is so, why did we choose the definition of rsph
as the radius of the disk in the Gaussian image plane?
</p>
<p>The answer to this question is discussed by Hawkes.
Defocusing the image slightly, to bring the plane of least
confusion to the Gaussian image plane, will indeed lead
to a decrease in the value of the numerical factor in
equation 6.23 from 0.91 to 0.43. Hawkes also comments
that since this latter value is smaller, manufacturers tend
to use it to define the resolution of their instrument!
However, this whole treatment of resolution assumes
incoherent illumination, which is not the case in the
TEM. Also, the resolution depends on the contrast in
the image and how the lens transfers information from
the object to the image. As a result, Hawkes concludes
that (see equation 6.23) B� 1 (from the Gaussian image)
is &lsquo;&lsquo;a more prudent choice&rsquo;&rsquo; (i.e., closer to reality) than B
= 0.43 (from the disk in the plane of least confusion)
even though, strictly speaking, the plane of least confu-
sion refers to the conditions operating in the TEM.
</p>
<p>So it is basically a matter of opinion whether to
use the diameter or the radius of the disk in the
Gaussian image plane or that in the plane of least
confusion. Fortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter too
much since, in the end, the choice only alters the
value of the numerical terms A and B, which we&rsquo;ve
already mentioned are often approximated to unity
anyhow. For example, the value of A will depend on
exactly which of the several quoted expressions was
used for rsph, e.g., if there was 0.25, 0.5, or 1 in front
of Csb
</p>
<p>3. After these various terms are fed into the
equations and the value of bopt is extracted, A only
varies by about �15%. A small variation in B will
occur also, for the same reason.
</p>
<p>We have tried to be consistent in our use of the
radius of the Airy disk and the radius of the aberra-
tion/astigmatism error. Obviously, it doesn&rsquo;t really
</p>
<p>CC-LIMITED RESOLUTION
This is typically 10� larger than the Cs-limited reso-
lution. When you&rsquo;re looking through a thick speci-
men the performance of your TEM is 10�worse than
its specified resolution.
</p>
<p>BEWARE!
1. There are inconsistencies in the definition of the
</p>
<p>terms used to describe the effects of Cs on TEM
resolution
</p>
<p>2. We use the Gaussian image radius referred back at
the object plane, i.e., we use rsph = Csb

<p>matter whether you use the radius or the diameter,
so long as you are consistent. Occasionally, however,
you may find the Airy disk radius is used in combi-
nation with the diameter of the disk in the plane of
least confusion or the Gaussian image plane, so this
also contributes much to the discrepancy between
various TEM texts.
</p>
<p>The question to any student learning HRTEM is: do
you know what your resolution really is?
</p>
<p>6.7 DEPTH OF FOCUS AND DEPTH
OF FIELD
</p>
<p>You should have got the message that, because of
the poor lens quality we have to use small apertures
to minimize their aberrations. This generally means
that we cut out many of the electrons that would
otherwise be gathered by the lens. Fortunately, our
electron sources are so bright that we can live with
substantially reduced beam currents hitting our spec-
imen. In fact there are advantages to using small
apertures, despite the price we pay in image inten-
sity, probe current, and diffraction-limited resolu-
tion. These advantages come in the form of better
depth of focus and better depth of field. These terms
can be confusing, and once again, the TEM litera-
ture is variable. So we need to go back to physical
optics to find the correct definition of these terms.
</p>
<p>Basically, we are trying to find out how much of the
object (the specimen) is in focus at the same time and
over what range the image is in focus. (This latter ques-
tion is irrelevant in SEM and dedicated STEMs without
post-specimen lenses where we don&rsquo;t use conventional
lenses to form the image, so both terms are equivalent.)
In TEM both terms are important.
</p>
<p>The depth of field, Dob, is measured at, and refers
to, the object. It&rsquo;s the distance along the axis on both
sides of the object plane within which we can move the
object without detectable loss of focus in the image.
The depth of focus, Dim, is measured in, and refers to,
the image plane. It is the distance along the axis on
both sides of the image plane within which the image
appears focused (assuming the object plane and objec-
tive lens are fixed). Note that we say &lsquo;&lsquo;appears&rsquo;&rsquo; in both
cases and this of course also depends on how good
your eyes are.
</p>
<p>We can derive expressions for these definitions using
Figure 6.15. Imagine that ray 1 originates at the highest
point up the column where the object can appear to
be in focus within the resolution and that this ray
arrives at the farthest point down the column where
the image can appear to be in focus. Ray 2 represents
the other extreme but travels at the same inclination
to the optic axis. If these two rays appear to come
from the same point (to within the resolution of the
</p>
<p>lens) the distances dob and dim correspond to the
smallest distances which we can resolve in the object
or image, respectively. Note immediately that dim is
greater than dob. Now we can show that angles aim
and bob, which are both small, are given by
</p>
<p>aim � tanaim &frac14;
dim=2

<p>Dim &frac14;

<p>bob
M2T (6:29�)
</p>
<p>and the depth of field is
</p>
<p>Dob &frac14;
dob
</p>
<p>bob
(6:30)
</p>
<p>Notice that for a correct calculation of either Dob
or Dim you must be careful to select the right value
of b. Under different circumstances, the limiting
angle is defined by the illumination aperture a (in
the C2 lens) or the objective aperture bo (in the
objective lens). In thin specimens, which scatter
weakly, most electrons emerge from the specimen in
a cone closer to that defined by aim, which is often
very small (�10�4 rad). In a thicker, more strongly
scattering specimen, the objective aperture defines the
angle and bo is usually about 10
</p>
<p>�2 rad.
</p>
<p>For a collection angle, bob, of 10mrad and a dob
of 0.2 nm, equation 6.30 tells us that the depth of
field will be 20 nm, i.e., a specimen of this thickness
can all be in focus at the same time. If you only need
2-nm detail in your image, then you can use a speci-
men which is 200 nm thick and it will still all be in
focus.
</p>
<p>If we want to see detail at the 0.2 nm level we
need to use a magnification of about 500,000�.
Equation 6.29 tells us that, under these conditions,
the depth of focus will then be 5 km! If we only need
to see 2 nm, we can use a magnification of 50,000�
and the depth of focus is 5m. In either case, we have
tremendous latitude in where we put the photo-
graphic negative or CCD camera because it would
still record a focused image many meters either side
of the screen. This explains why we can use a CCD
camera which can be inserted just below the final
projector lens, and still get a focused image with a
TV camera well below the standard film camera. In
fact, the TEM image would be in focus on the floor
under the microscope (or maybe even the floor below
if your TEM lab has the misfortune not to be on the
lowest floor) if you projected it there but MT would
be different!
</p>
<p>Now things get a little more complicated if you&rsquo;re
using a Cs-corrected TEM because, for example, in
STEM we can use much larger condenser apertures
which give much larger convergence angles and thus
define the probe a lot more strictly, over distances
less than the specimen thickness. In this case, rather
than worrying about the reduced depth of field it
becomes feasible to think about focusing the probe
at different levels within the specimen to explore any
structural or chemical variations through the foil
thickness. So now we can think about overcoming
the projection limitation of TEM images. (Remember
the rhino?) The first attempts at imaging single
atoms at specific depths within a thin specimen
have already been reported.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
We&rsquo;ve introduced you to the principles of how an electromagnetic lens works, and how we
describe its functions in simple ray diagrams. There are two principal operations: either we
use the lens to create an image of an object or we use it bring parallel rays to a focus. We&rsquo;ll
see in later chapters that the former operation is used to create magnified images of the
specimen on the screen of the TEM. It is also used to create small electron probes (demag-
nified images of the electron source) at the plane of the specimen in a STEM or AEM. The
latter operation is used to create DPs in the back-focal plane of the objective lens.
</p>
<p>Our lenses are rather abysmal in their performance, resulting in the need for small
limiting apertures. The lens aberrations limit the resolution of the microscope and we
usually need an optimum aperture to get the minimum resolution. The small apertures cut
down the electron beam intensity, but also give us remarkable depth of focus and depth of
</p>
<p>FOCUS AND FIELD
So we get a much greater depth of focus and field by
using small apertures (small b).

<p>RESOLUTION
All texts on TEM will include a discussion of resolution. Particularly useful are those in Reimer 1997,
</p>
<p>Edington 1976, Fultz and Howe 2002 and Hirsch et al. 1977.
</p>
<p>q Points to be wary of when reading about definitions ofCs-limited resolution: (see references in Chapter 1)
</p>
<p>Sawyer and Grubb (2008) and Egerton 2005 use the Gaussian image radius referred back at the object plane,
</p>
<p>just as we do; i.e., rsph =Csb
3. Reimer 1997 and Fultz and Howe 2001 use the diameter of the disk in the
</p>
<p>plane of least confusion; i.e., dsph = 0.5Csb
3 although both also describe the radius at the Gaussian image
</p>
<p>plane as we do. Beware: Edington 1976 implies, and Hirsch et al. 1977 state, that Csb
3 is the radius of the
</p>
<p>disk in the plane of least confusion, which it is not, since by definition it must be less than the Gaussian-
</p>
<p>image radius (see Figure 6.11).

<p>q Points to be wary of when reading about depth of field and depth of focus
</p>
<p>Bradbury et al. 1989 give a particularly clear discussion of the topic. Reimer 1997 uses the term depth of

<p>focus for the depth of field and uses depth of image for depth of focus; a rare inconsistency! The terms
</p>
<p>are used interchangeably in SEM because there is no lens between the object and the image.

<p>companion text. There, you&rsquo;ll also find more on the principles of lens optics and onNewton&rsquo;s lens equation
</p>
<p>in particular. Lenses may also be used in other components of the TEM such as electron spectrometers or,
</p>
<p>in effect, the electron gun; you&rsquo;ll find more on these topics in the same chapter. Quadrupoles, sextupoles,
</p>
<p>and octupoles are critical components in the correction of aberrations and in some spectrometers; we

<p>How to &lsquo;See&rsquo; Electrons
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>If we are studying the structure of a material, when all is said and done, all we have to show
for learning how to operate our expensive TEM, the many hours spent in specimen
preparation, etc., is an image or a DP. These images and DPs, which are just different
distributions of electron intensity, have first to be viewed in somemanner. After viewing, we
have to decide if we want to save the results for future reference, perhaps so we can print out
the data for a presentation, technical report, or scientific publication. Since, as we noted in
the opening chapter, our eyes are not sensitive to electrons, we have to find ways to translate
the electron-intensity distributions generated by the specimen into visible-light distribu-
tions, which we can see. This chapter will explain how we &lsquo;see&rsquo; electrons.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll break the process down into two parts: first, detection (and display) of the image,
and second, recording of the image. Both these areas are undergoing rapid change because
of ongoing advances in electronic imaging and storage technology, and so this chapter will
undoubtedly contain anachronisms by the time you read it. In particular, numbers are
favored over photographic data; how can we quantitatively compare two photographs?
Comparing two sets of numbers is routine.
</p>
<p>7.1 ELECTRON DETECTION AND DISPLAY
</p>
<p>As we saw back in Figure 2.1, images and DPs are
different kinds of two-dimensional, electron-density dis-
tributions which are produced when a thin specimen
scatters electrons. We detect and display them in differ-
ent ways depending on whether we are using a TEM or
STEM, as we&rsquo;ll explain in Chapter 9. In a conventional
TEM, the images and DPs are static, because the inci-
dent beam is fixed, and so we can easily project them
onto a viewing screen within the microscope column.
TEM images, for example, are analog images of electron-
density variations in the image plane of the objective
lens. We cannot manipulate the image or its contrast in
any way between the electrons leaving the image plane
and being projected onto the viewing screen. So we will
briefly discuss the properties of the viewing screen. The
manufacturer controls the choice of screen materials so
you might think there&rsquo;s not much need to understand
this aspect in any depth. You might be surprised by the
limitations you don&rsquo;t need to accept or the improve-
ments which could be made.
</p>
<p>When we operate our TEM as a STEM, or we use a
dedicated STEM, the image is not static; it is built up
over time as the small probe is scanned across the area of
interest. Under these circumstances, we can detect the
</p>
<p>electron signals in several ways. If we are seeking sec-
ondary electron (SE) or backscattered electron (BSE)
signals, then these detectors sit in the specimen stage
area. If we are seeking the same forward-scattered elec-
trons that we view on the TEM screen, the detectors are
in the viewing chamber of the TEM. After we&rsquo;ve
detected any one of these signals, it is usually digitized
and the digital scanning image is presented on a fluo-
rescent screen as an analog image. You may hear this
fluorescent screen referred to as the CRT, which are the
initials for cathode-ray tube and a relic from the early
days of electron physics. It is becoming much more
common for the image or DP to be displayed on a flat-
panel screen beside the main TEM column (or even on a
plasma or LCD screen on the wall of the EM lab)
controlled by the TEM&rsquo;s computer.
</p>
<p>We should point out that the sequential or serial na-
ture of the scanning imagemakes it ideal for on-line image
enhancement, image processing, and subsequent image
analysis. The signal from any electronic detector can be
digitized and electronically manipulated prior to display
on the CRT or computer screen, in a way that is impos-
sible with analog images. We can adjust the digital signal
to enhance the contrast or to reduce the noise. Alterna-
tively, we can store the digital information and process it
mathematically. The availability of cheap memory and

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>fast computers permits on-line image processing and the
rapid extraction of quantitative data from the scanning
image;wediscuss all this andmore inChapter 31.Because
of developments in computer technology, there is great
interest in recording analogTEMimages via aTVcamera
in order to digitize them; charge-coupled device (CCD)
cameras are readily available for on-line viewing and
processing, particularly of HRTEM images. CCD tech-
nology is advancing rapidly, driven largely by the digital-
cameramarket andmicroscopists will continue to benefit
from the availability of ever-larger CCD detectors. So
we&rsquo;ll spend part of this chapter on CCDs which you&rsquo;ll
have now worked out are equally sensitive to visible light
and high-energy electrons.
</p>
<p>In attempting to compare the properties of detection
and recording devices we often use the concept of the
&lsquo;detection quantum efficiency&rsquo; or DQE. If a detector is
linear in its response then the DQE is defined simply as
</p>
<p>DQE &frac14;
</p>
<p>Sout
Nout
</p>
<p>� �2
</p>
<p>Sin
Nin
</p>
<p>� �2
(7:1)
</p>
<p>where S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio of the output or
input signal. So a perfect detector has aDQE of 1 and all
practical detectors have a DQE &lt;1.
</p>
<p>Note on terminology: We use several different terms,
often imprecisely, to describe how we &lsquo;see&rsquo; electrons.
Since our eyes can&rsquo;t in fact see electrons, we have to
resort to the phenomenon of cathodoluminescence (CL)
(which we introduced back in Section 4.4) in order to
provide an interface between electrons and our eyes.
Any electron display system that we look at relies on
CL at some point. The CL process converts the energy
of the electrons (cathode rays) to produce light (lumi-
nescence). As a result, any electron display screen emits
light in proportion to the intensity of electrons falling on
it. A few definitions are in order
</p>
<p>&amp; Light emission caused by ionizing radiation is
scintillation.
</p>
<p>&amp; The process of fluorescence implies rapid emission.
&amp; Phosphorescence implies that the wavelength and the
delay time are longer than for fluorescence.
</p>
<p>All these terms are used in electron microscopy
(interchangeably and often inaccurately) because the
&lsquo;fluorescent&rsquo; screen is coated with a long-delay phos-
phor (see Chapter 9).
</p>
<p>7.2 VIEWING SCREENS
</p>
<p>The viewing screen in a TEM is coated with a
material such as ZnS, which emits light with a wave-
length of�450 nm. The ZnS is usually modified (doped)
</p>
<p>to give off green light at closer to 550 nm; hence you&rsquo;ll
see screens of different shades of green which, being in
the middle of the visible spectrum, is most relaxing for
your eyes. As long as sufficient light is emitted, the main
requirement of the viewing screen is that the ZnS parti-
cle (grain) size be small enough so that your eye cannot
resolve individual grains. This means that grain sizes
&lt; 100mmare acceptable (although you can see the grain
size if you look at the screen through the auxiliary
focusing binoculars). Typical screen coatings are
made with a ZnS grain size of �50 mm, although they
may be as small as 10 mm for the highest-resolution
screens.
</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen in Chapter 4, the cross section for
inelastic interactions (and hence the emission intensity
of most signals, including CL) decreases with increas-
ing beam voltage. You would thus expect the light
intensity to degrade at higher voltages, but this is offset
by the increase in gun brightness. In some HVEMs the
support for the small focusing screen is made of a
heavy metal such as Pt to enhance backscatter and
increase screen intensity, Of course, this backscattering
will broaden the volume where light is generated and
blur the image, so we don&rsquo;t gain very much. In fact
most TEMs have very similar screens. Other signals are
also given off by the viewing screen, such as X-rays,
and whenever you look at the screen you are protected
from this lethal radiation flux by lead glass, which is
carefully selected to reduce transmitted radiation to
levels at or below ambient background. In HVEMs
this can amount to several tens of millimeters of glass
and, invariably, the optical transmission capabilities
are degraded as the glass gets thicker, but obviously
we have no alternative if we want to view the screen
directly.
</p>
<p>A FEW WORDS OF CAUTION ABOUT YOUR
SCREEN
</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much you can do about choosing the best
material for the viewing screen since the manufac-
turer selects it for you, but you can extend its life
substantially by taking care to minimize overexpo-
sure. The greatest source of screen damage is the
intense direct beam that comes through thin speci-
mens and constitutes the central spot in DPs. Using
what you&rsquo;ll learn about operations of the TEM in
Chapter 9, you canminimize burning of the screen by
(a) only going to diffraction mode with the selected-
area aperture inserted, (b) only going to diffraction
mode with the C2 lens overfocused, and (c) if the spot
appears exceptionally intense despite these precau-
tions, then insert the beam stop while you&rsquo;re observ-
ing the pattern on the screen (but not when
recording it).
</p>
<p>116 ..........................................................................................................................................................................HOW TO &lsquo; SEE &rsquo; ELECTRONS</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>While it is surprising that a modern TEM still
relies on an analog screen, the end is perhaps already
in sight. One of the latest TEM models (go back and
look at Figure 1.9) is built without an operator&rsquo;s
viewing screen; all the information is shown on flat-
panel computer displays on a console that is separate
from the column. Such a design breaks away from
more than 70 years of TEM design but has the
distinct advantages that
</p>
<p>&amp; Anyone in the room (or indeed anyone connected via
the Internet) can see the images and DPs, which
creates a much better teaching environment.
</p>
<p>&amp; The lights don&rsquo;t have to be out to view and record the
information.
</p>
<p>&amp; The TEM column can be placed in a room that is
separated from the operator, whose presence invari-
ably reduces the resolution capabilities of the highest-
performance microscopes.
</p>
<p>Moving to digital display and recording brings with
it the possibility of processing the image or DP to
enhance or suppress information prior to publication
or presentation. There are obvious ethical considera-
tions here since the scientific community expects that
published data be presented with sufficient background
information that others would be able to reproduce and
cross-check the experiment. So if you process digital
images it is wise to publish the unprocessed data at the
same time so others can see what data processing has
been used. We&rsquo;ll talk a lot more about such ethical
issues and related topics when we discuss image proces-
sing in Chapter 31.
</p>
<p>7.3 ELECTRON DETECTORS
</p>
<p>We have several alternatives to the fluorescent screen
for detecting electrons. These other electron detectors
play a major role in STEMs and AEMs (as well as in
SEMs). They are actually essential to the STEM
image-forming process that we&rsquo;ll describe in Chapter
9. Such detectors are usually one of two kinds: semi-
conductor (Si p-n junction) detectors or scintillator-
photomultiplier systems. We&rsquo;ll examine the pros and
cons of each of these two types and end with a
section on CCDs.
</p>
<p>7.3.A Semiconductor Detectors
</p>
<p>A full understanding of how semiconductor detectors
work requires a fair knowledge of solid-state physics.
We&rsquo;ll just give a brief outline of the principles as they
affect the use of the TEM but if you want to dig
deeper the place to start is the excellent text by
Pierret.
</p>
<p>The semiconductor detector, shown schematically in
Figure 7.1, is a doped single-crystal sheet of Si (often
inaccurately described as a solid-state detector). We
make the Si into an electron-sensitive detector by creat-
ing a p-n junction beneath the Si surface in one of two
ways. In one type of detector, we create the junction by
doping the Si (e.g., by ion implantation of n-type impur-
ity atoms into p-type Si or vice versa). This doping
disturbs the equilibrium charge carrier concentration
and creates a region across the p-n junction that is free
of majority carriers which we call a &lsquo;depletion region.&rsquo; A
conducting metal layer is evaporated onto both surfaces
to provide ohmic contacts. The alternative type of detec-
tor is called a surface-barrier detector (or sometimes a
Schottky diode) and we fabricate this by evaporating a
thin layer of Au on the surface of high-resistivity n-type
Si, or evaporating Al onto p-type Si. This surface layer
acts as an electrical contact and also creates a depletion
layer and a p-n junction just inside the Si.
</p>
<p>When we put either of these detectors into a beam of
high-energy electrons, most of the beam energy is trans-
ferred to valence-band electrons in the Si which are
excited across the band gap into the conduction band
thus creating electron-hole pairs (see Figure 4.8). We
can separate the electrons and holes most efficiently by
applying an external reverse bias to the detector; that is,
we put a negative bias on the p side of the junction and a
positive bias on the n side. In practice, however, somany
electron-hole pairs are created at TEM beam energies
</p>

</p>
<p>a configuration where it would be used to detect high-energy, forward-
</p>
<p>scattered electrons. The direct beam is detected by a small circular detector
</p>
<p>on the optic axis of the microscope surrounded by a concentric wide-angle
</p>
<p>annular detector, which detects any scattered electrons.

<p>that an external bias is not usually necessary, and the
internal bias of the p-n junction acts to separate the
electrons and holes. Because the electrons and holes
move quite quickly in Si, it takes only a few nanoseconds
to gather most of the carriers over an area of�1 mm2. So
the semiconductor detector is remarkably responsive to
electrons. The net result is that the incoming electron
signal is converted to a current in the external circuit
between the surface contacts, as shown in the surface-
barrier detector in Figure 7.1.
</p>
<p>Since it takes approximately 3.6 eV to produce an
electron-hole pair in Si at room temperature, a 100-keV
electron can theoretically produce �28,000 electrons.
This represents a maximum detector gain of close to
3�104 but in practice there are losses due to electron
absorption in the metal contact layer and recombina-
tion of the electrons and the holes close to the Si surface
(in a region called the dead layer), and we actually get a
gain of closer to 2�104.
</p>
<p>These semiconductor detectors are very efficient at
picking up and amplifying electron signals. Unfortu-
nately, they have an inherently large capacitance, so
they are not very responsive to rapid changes in signal
intensity. Such changes are quite likely to occur during
the rapid scanning process of STEM imaging. In other
words, the detector has a narrow bandwidth (typically
100 kHz); this is not a good property for a detector
which is subject to widely varying signal intensities.
We could lower the capacitance by decreasing the detec-
tor area, but if we do this, the signal-to-noise ratio will
be lowered. It is the S/N ratio that ultimately limits the
quality of all scanning images.
</p>
<p>Semiconductor detectors have several advantages
</p>
<p>&amp; We can easily fabricate them.
&amp; They are cheap to replace.
&amp; They can be cut into any shape, as long as it is flat.
</p>
<p>This latter advantage makes them ideal for squeez-
ing into the confines of TEM stages and columns. For
example, we can make the semiconductor detector in
annular form so that the main electron beam goes
through the hole in it, but the scattered electrons are
very efficiently detected. This produces a dark-field
(scattered electron) detector. We can also make detec-
tors that are divided into halves or quadrants and each
segment is insulated from the other(s). These detectors
are very useful for discriminating directional signals
such as those coming from magnetic specimens.
</p>
<p>There are also some drawbacks to semiconductor
detectors
</p>
<p>&amp; They have a large dark current (the current regis-
tered when no signal is incident on the detector).
This dark current arises from thermal activation of
electron-hole pairs, or from light falling on an
</p>
<p>uncoated detector. Since the detectors in a TEM
invariably have a metal ohmic contact, the light
problem is minimal because light can&rsquo;t penetrate
the metal film. Now we could minimize thermal
activation by cooling the detector to liquid-nitrogen
temperatures but that step is impractical and intro-
duces a cold surface into the vacuum which would
simply collect contamination, so we live with noise
due to the thermal activation.
</p>
<p>&amp; Because noise is inherent in the semiconductor
detector, its DQE is poor for low-intensity sig-
nals, but rises almost to unity for high-intensity
signals.
</p>
<p>&amp; The electron beam can damage the detector, partic-
ularly in intermediate voltage microscopes. In these
circumstances, a doped p-n detector is less sensitive
than a surface-barrier detector, because the deple-
tion region is deeper in the Si.
</p>
<p>&amp; They are insensitive to low-energy electrons such as
secondary electrons.
</p>
<p>Despite these drawbacks, both types of Si detector
are far more robust than the alternative scintillator,
which we will now describe.
</p>
<p>7.3.B Scintillator-Photomultiplier
Detectors/TV Cameras
</p>
<p>A scintillator emits visible light when struck by electrons
because of the same CL process that occurs in fluores-
cent screens. While we are viewing a static TEM image,
we want the fluorescent screen to continue emitting light
for some time after the electrons hit it, so we use a long-
delay scintillator. Of course, when we are using a scin-
tillator to detect rapid changes in signal as in scanning
beam imaging, we want the light emission to decay
rapidly. So we don&rsquo;t use ZnS in scintillator detectors
but rather materials such as Ce-doped yttrium-aluminum
garnet (YAG) and various doped plastics and glasses.
These materials have decay times on the order of nano-
seconds rather than the microseconds needed for ZnS.
Once we&rsquo;ve converted the incoming electron signal to
visible light, the light from the scintillator is amplified
by a photomultiplier (PM) system, attached to the scin-
tillator via a light pipe. Figure 7.2 shows a schematic
diagram of a scintillator-PM detector setup to detect
secondary electrons in a TEM, but the design used to
detect primary scattered electrons in the STEM is essen-
tially identical.
</p>
<p>The scintillators that we use in STEMs or SEMs are
often coated with a 100-nm-thick layer of Al to reflect
any light generated in the microscope and stop it from
entering the PM tube where it would add noise to the
signal. If the detector is in the stage of the microscope,
this light could come from the specimen itself if it is
cathodoluminescent, or it could be light coming down
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the column from a thermionic source and reflected from
the polished surface of the specimen. If you have an
uncoated scintillator detector in the viewing chamber,
then room light may also hit the detector, so you should
cover the windows of the viewing chamber.
</p>
<p>The advantages of the scintillator-PM system are
</p>
<p>&amp; The gain of the system is very high. The gain for the
total detector system is of the order of 10n, depend-
ing on the number (n) of electrodes (often called
dynodes) in the PM. A value of 108 is not unusual
(compare with �104 for the semiconductor detector).
This performance is reflected in a typical DQE of
close to 0.9 for several commercial scintillators.
</p>
<p>&amp; The noise level in a scintillator is low compared with
semiconductor detectors, and the bandwidth of the
scintillator is in the MHz range. As a result, both
low-intensity images and TV-rate images are easily
displayed. There is a tremendous practical advan-
tage to TV-rate imaging of digital signals, because
such images, when suitably processed and displayed
can be viewed, stored, and recorded under normal
conditions of room illumination. So you don&rsquo;t have
to work in the dark while operating your (S)TEM.
</p>
<p>The disadvantages of the scintillator-PM system
are
</p>
<p>&amp; The scintillator is not as robust as the semiconductor
detector, being even more susceptible to radiation
damage, particularly after longtime exposure to the
beam.
</p>
<p>&amp; The scintillator-PM combination is also substan-
tially more expensive and bulky compared to semi-
conductor detectors and therefore it does not fit well
within the TEM stage, nor is it easily manufactured
into multi-detector configurations; it is also more
expensive. However, plastic scintillators can be
shaped to give large collection angle, such as the
Robinson BSE detector used in many SEMs.
</p>
<p>&amp; The energy-conversion efficiency of a scintillator is
also rather low (� 2%&ndash;20%) compared to a semi-
conductor detector and, typically, we only get about
4000 photons per incident 100-keV electron, � 7�
less than for the semiconductor detector. This low
efficiency is offset by the gain in the PM tube.
</p>
<p>On balance, the scintillator-PM detector is preferred
over the semiconductor detector for most general elec-
tron detection in TEM/STEM systems. However, you
must take care to minimize any high-intensity beams
that may damage the detector and lower its efficiency.
Therefore, you need to take more care when operating
scintillator detectors.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already mentioned that you can view the
TEM image directly through a TV camera, rather
than looking at the fluorescent screen. There are
real advantages to TV cameras, e.g., for on-line view-
ing of faint HRTEM images (see Chapter 28) or for
recording of dynamic in-situ events (see Chapter 29).
Also, from a teaching standpoint, anything that pulls
the TEM image, in real time, out of the viewing
chamber (which only the operator can see into
clearly) and onto a classroom or laboratory compu-
ter screen or plasma display makes life so much
easier. With the increased interest in telemicroscopy,
TV cameras and webcams are becoming much more
common within the TEM room (e.g., URLs #1 and
#2). TV cameras attached to TEMs come in both
analog and digital forms. Typically the cameras are
placed below the viewing screen so you have to lift
up the screen to detect the TV image. The camera
may have to be offset if there is another post-column
attachment such as an EELS system. Sometimes the
camera is placed within the column and is then
moved on axis when needed.
</p>
<p>Analog YAG-based scintillator TV cameras may be
used for applications requiring image intensification if
you are dealing with faint images (e.g., if you are using
low-dose techniques because your specimen would
otherwise be damaged by the beam). Also, wide-angle

<p>cameras are available that collect a much greater area of
the image or DP than the standard TEM photographic
plate. However, the most widely used TV cameras use
only digital-detection technology, which we&rsquo;ll now
discuss.
</p>
<p>7.3.C Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) Detectors
</p>
<p>Electronic technology for recording images and spectra
is rapidly closing in on the more traditional analog
methods. CCD cameras are becoming the norm for
real-time TV recording of images and DPs. They are
also being used for two&ndash;dimensional arrays for parallel-
collection EELS and energy-filtered images, as we
describe in Chapter 37.
</p>
<p>CCDs are metal-insulator-silicon devices that
store charge generated by light or electron beams.
CCD arrays consist of several mega- (millions of)
pixels which are individual capacitors electrically
isolated from each other through the creation of
potential wells under each CCD cell, so they can
accumulate charge in proportion to the incident
radiation intensity, as shown in Figure 7.3A. The
largest CCD arrays, as of writing this text are giga-
pixels (109). Because such systems are so expensive,
they are typically developed for use in major astro-
nomical telescopes for detecting very faint light
sources. In fact there isn&rsquo;t a good reference text for
CCD use in electron microscopy but there is a great
one by Howell for astronomy that gives excellent
background material if you are interested in digital-
image recording.
</p>
<p>The maximum size of CCD currently available for
TEM use is 4k�4k but the size will only increase
with time. (It is also possible to stitch together multi-
ple CCD images using software so, if you have the
time, the size of the CCD itself is not a serious issue.)
The individual cells currently can be as small as 6 mm
although a more typical size range is �10&ndash;15 mm. To
create a picture, we have to read out the array. We
do this by changing the applied potentials to transfer
the charge serially from each potential well along a
line in the array into an output amplifier, as shown
in Figure 7.3B. With good design of the electrodes,
charge-transfer efficiencies of 99.999% can be achieved.
Once all the cells are empty the array can be re-
exposed. This so-called &lsquo;full-frame&rsquo; design is simple
and robust and offers the highest resolution and highest
pixel density.
</p>
<p>Rather than serial readout of full-frame CCDs, it is
also possible to have frame transfer CCDs in which the
whole frame is transferred to an adjacent storage array
leaving the main array free to collect a new signal flux.
This method allows for shorter frame times, and thus a
faster image acquisition, but is muchmore complex and,
since more of the device is taken up with the storage, the
</p>
<p>CCD has lower resolution and much higher cost. The
typical frame times needed to record TEM images are
long enough that high-speed frame transfer is not
usually needed.

<p>The frame time for reading the CCD depends on
the size of the image and the specific technology used
to readout the detected signal. Ultrahigh-speed CCD
cameras are available with &gt;105 frames/second, but
such high speeds are not essential in standard TEM.
It is worth noting, however, that time-resolved TEM
is an area of growing importance and, in such dedi-
cated instruments, ultra-fast recording is required.
Routinely, frame times of &lt;0.001 seconds, well
below standard TV rates of 0.033 seconds, are avail-
able for in-situ recording of fast events. But the
frame time can equally well be several minutes (e.g.,
for picking up diffuse scattering in faint DPs).
Obviously, the longer the exposure, the more the
image is susceptible to external vibration, drift, etc.;
so long exposures, e.g., for HRTEM images, are not
good.
</p>
<p>CCD detectors have several advantages
</p>
<p>&amp; When cooled, they have very low noise and a good
DQE (&gt;0.5) even at low input signal levels.
</p>
<p>&amp; The dynamic range is high, making them ideal for
recording DPs which can span an enormous inten-
sity range.
</p>
<p>&amp; They respond linearly to changes in input signal and
show a fairly uniform response across many pixels.
</p>
<p>There are some drawbacks to CCDs, not least of
which is their cost, but that is always decreasing, as
with any Moore&rsquo;s-law-based technology. However,
&lsquo;blooming,&rsquo; which occurs when too much signal
fills up the pixel and the signal overflows into sur-
rounding pixels, can be a problem. This problem can
be overcome substantially by building anti-blooming
or overflow drain structures within the device.
Apart from these minor factors it is clear that, in
the end, CCDs, or other electronic technology, will
eventually record and store all TEM images, DPs,
and spectra.
</p>
<p>7.3.D Faraday Cup
</p>
<p>In conventional TEM there isn&rsquo;t much need to know
the beam current, but for X-ray analysis in the AEM, it
is essential, since there is often a need to compare
analytical results obtained under identical beam current
conditions. A Faraday cup is a detector that simply
measures the total electron current in the beam. We
don&rsquo;t use it for any imaging process, but rather as a
way of characterizing the performance of the electron
source as we saw in Chapter 5. Once the electrons enter
the Faraday cup, they cannot leave except by flowing to
ground through an attached picoammeter that measures
the electron current.
</p>
<p>You can easily construct a Faraday cup to go in an
SEM, but it is more difficult to design one that fits in the
</p>
<p>stage of a TEM. A dedicated Faraday cup holder is
shown in Figure 7.4A. The entrance aperture is small
and the chamber is relatively deep and lined with a low-
Zmaterial to minimize backscatter. If you tilt it slightly,
the electrons have little chance of being scattered
directly back. With such a holder you can only find the
hole if you can image the upper surface with SE or BSE
detectors, and if these are not available then you must
have a cup with a hole in the lower surface too. When
the cup is not tilted, the electrons go straight through; if
you tilt the cup, then all the electrons are trapped as
shown in Figure 7.4A. The way to ensure that you are
measuring the maximum current is to look at the
picoammeter reading as you tilt the cup. Some manu-
facturers now incorporate a Faraday cup in the speci-
men holder. You can measure the current by deflecting
the beam into the cup or partially extracting the holder
so the beam falls into the cup (Figure 7.4B).
</p>

<p>FIGURE 7.4. (A) Schematic diagram of a dedicated Faraday cup in the
</p>
<p>end of a side-entry specimen holder (more details about these holders in
</p>
<p>Chapter 8). The entrance aperture has to be found by imaging the top
</p>
<p>surface using SEs or BSEs. In (B) the specimen holder is retracted so the
</p>
<p>electrons fall into a cup on the tip of the holder (in which position of
</p>
<p>course the TEM image of your specimen cannot be seen). In either case,
</p>
<p>the electron current is measured as it goes to ground through a picoam-
</p>
<p>meter attached to the outside of the holder.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a Faraday cup, it is possible to
get an approximate reading of the current by just
measuring the current through an insulated line from
a bulk region of your specimen and correcting for
electron backscatter. Backscattering is independent of
the accelerating voltage and approximately linear with
atomic number up to about Z = 30. For example, the
backscatter coefficient for Cu is about 0.3 and for Al
is about 0.15. It is also possible to deflect the beam
onto the last beam-defining diaphragm (see Chapters 6
and 9) and measure the current via an insulated feed-
through (also correcting for backscatter).
</p>
<p>7.4 WHICH DETECTOR DO WE USE FOR
WHICH SIGNAL?
</p>
<p>As we mentioned at the start of the chapter, the princi-
pal electron signals that we can detect are the forward-
scattered electrons (which as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 9 form
the most common TEM images) and the BSE and SE
signals from the beam-entry surface of the specimen.
</p>
<p>Semiconductor detectors are only sensitive to elec-
trons with sufficient energy (&gt;5 keV) to penetrate the
metal contact layer. So we use these detectors mainly for
high-energy forward-scattered imaging and high-energy
BSE imaging. Because of the surface contact layer we
don&rsquo;t use semiconductor detectors for low-energy SEs
but instead use a scintillator-PM system. Remember
that the scintillator may also be coated with Al to pre-
vent visible light from generating noise. This coating
would also prevent low-energy SEs from being detected.
So for SE detection, either there must be no coating or
the electrons must be accelerated to an energy high
enough to penetrate the coating; we achieve the latter
by applying a high kV (&gt;10 kV) positive bias to the
scintillator.
</p>
<p>The capacitance is relatively high for semiconduc-
tor detectors so they are not the detector of choice in
dedicated STEMs where high scan-rate TV images
are the normal viewing mode, i.e., you need a quick
response. The scintillator-PM system is again preferred
under these circumstances. As most microscopes move
toward TV-rate display of scanning images it is likely
that the scintillator-PM will be used increasingly for
forward-scattered TEM imaging. Semiconductor detec-
tors may only be used for BSEs, which is not a major
imaging mode in TEMs. A summary of all the various
electron detectors in a TEM/STEM is given in Figure
7.5. We&rsquo;ll talk more about the methods of imaging in
Chapter 9 and later in Part 3 but the primary detectors
in (S)TEM pick up the forward-scattered electrons on-
axis (called the bright-field (BF) detector), forward-
scattered through small angles &lt;�38 (called the annu-
lar dark-field (ADF) detector), or scattered out to
</p>
<p>higher angles (called the high-angle annular dark-field
(HAADF) detector).
</p>
<p>Sometimes we examine specimens which themselves
exhibit cathodoluminescence under electron bombard-
ment. We discussed CL back in Chapter 4 and we&rsquo;ll
give an example of why CL imaging might be useful in
Chapter 29. A mirror is used to focus the light from the
specimen into a scintillator-PM system; one design is
shown in Figure 7.6. In this setup, the specimen must be
moved and tilted until, in combination with the collimat-
ing lens, the maximum signal is detected by the PMT.
This setup effectively prevents detection of most other
signals, including X-rays, because the mirror occupies all
the free space in the TEM stage. So you have to dedicate
the TEM to CL detection alone and ignore other signals.
There are only a few such CL-TEMs in the world.
</p>
<p>7.5 IMAGE RECORDING
</p>
<p>7.5.A Photographic Emulsions
</p>
<p>Although photographic film is the oldest recording
medium, it still retains sufficient advantages that we
continue to use it in some TEMs (and most that
are &gt;10 years old). Photographic emulsions are suspen-
sions of silver halide grains in a gel. Electrons strike the
</p>
<p>FIGURE 7.5. The various electron detectors in a STEM. Scintillator-
</p>
<p>PM detectors are invariably used for SE detection and semiconductor
</p>
<p>detectors for the BSE. The on-axis and annular forward-scattered and
</p>
<p>high-angle dark field detectors may be either type, depending on the
</p>
<p>microscope. The SE detector is rare, the BSE detector is a waste of
</p>
<p>time: only the forward-scattered electron detectors are standard.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>halide, ionize it, and transform it to silver. The emul-
sions are supported on a polymer film which, unlike
the earlier glass plates, outgas and shrink during pre-
pumping, or processing. However, glass plates were
heavy, occupied an enormous volume compared to
film, and Murphy&rsquo;s law meant that your best plates
invariably broke because you spent more time handling
them. Many aging microscopists still call their EM
films &lsquo;plates.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>If you are still using film, you have a choice of
photographic emulsions, just as you do for your
camera (since you&rsquo;ll probably still have a film camera
if you&rsquo;re using TEM film). Different speed emulsions
are available, with the usual compromise that faster
film means a larger grain size and therefore less
resolution.
</p>
<p>&amp; In principle, for the highest-resolution images, the
slowest (finest grain) film is best.
</p>
<p>&amp; In practice, we usually minimize the exposure time
and go for the fastest film.
</p>
<p>We usually want to minimize beam damage and
blurring due to movement (drift) of the specimen/
stage, so we keep the exposure short. In fact grain
sizes for the faster film are about 5 mm compared to
</p>
<p>about 4 mm for the slowest film, so we don&rsquo;t lose much
resolution. The loss of resolution is more than offset
by the shorter exposure times which minimize the
overall dose to the specimen. The only time you may
need to use slower film is if you have a problem with
poor image contrast. This problem is more common
when imaging amorphous, biological, or polymer
specimens.
</p>
<p>Although the grain size of the emulsion may be as
small as a few micrometers, the actual resolution of the
recorded image is worse than this because of electron
spreading in the emulsion. The practical resolution may
only be about 20&ndash;50 mm.Despite this degradationwe still
have more than 107 picture elements or pixels available
to store information in a standard 100 mm � 100 mm
image (KodachromeTM film has the silver halide equiva-
lent of 1.8 � 107 pixels). Film has a high DQE, although
its dynamic range is rather limited. What this means is
that you can easily saturate the film (change all the halide
to silver) and you lose any linear relationship between
electron intensity and gray scale in the film. As we&rsquo;ve
already noted, CCDs have a high dynamic range, are
linear in response, uniform in output, have anti-bloom-
ing technology and the latest CCDs boast &gt;109 pixels.
Perhaps the end is indeed in sight!

<p>7 .5 IMAGE RECORD ING ............................................................................................................................................................................. 123</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Removing photographic film from the TEM will be
a major operational improvement, because the absorbed
water degrades the vacuum.
</p>
<p>Both the emulsion and the support outgas, which is a
major contribution to the residual high pressure of
hydrocarbons and water vapor in the instrument
which, in turn, cause contamination of your specimen.
</p>
<p>We used to use Polaroid instant film for record-
ing scanning images from the CRT display in STEM
mode and there may be a few older instruments
around that still require such. But it will generally
be good to see the end of any kind of film because
they were analog, expensive, used nasty chemicals,
and created a lot of mess around the TEM lab.
Also there was always the chance that someone
before you had loaded the film incorrectly, thus ren-
dering your precious time on the microscope useless
and subsequently provoking occasional melees in
graduate-student hangouts.
</p>
<p>7.5.B Other Image-Recording Methods
</p>
<p>Digital images can be stored and retrieved, for example,
magnetically on hard drives, or optically on compact
discs, DVDs, or, most recently, holographic storage
disks. These devices are cheaper and easier to use than
photographic recording and images on an optical disc
will not degrade with time even after years of storage.
However, the usual drawback to digital-storage tech-
nology is the question of how long will the technology
be around to read any particular stored image. How
many images do you still have on a 3.5&rsquo;&rsquo; floppy? Prob-
ably not many! Or a zip drive? Perhaps lots more but
you can&rsquo;t read them anymore.
</p>
<p>An alternative is the image plate, manufactured by
Fuji, which is a kind of re-usable, digital photographic
plate. The plates can be used, read, and re-used and this
capability permits on-line image processing of the data.
While this technology is seeing a lot of use in medical
X-ray laboratories, it has not caught on in the TEM
field, mainly because it is so expensive.
</p>
<p>To present a stored image for publication you still
have to print it in some way; photographic methods are
still occasionally used. However, laser printers now have
</p>
<p>the quality required for publishing the highest resolution
images (1200 dpi or 48/mm) means that the dot size is
well below the resolving power of human eye. Likewise
the advent of artificial coloring of electron images, DPs,
and spectral images over the last decade or so means that
photographic methods of printing are becoming comple-
tely obsolete because color photography was never a

<p>7.6 COMPARISON OF SCANNING IMAGES
AND STATIC IMAGES
</p>
<p>We have a choice of creating analog static images in
conventional TEM mode or digital scanning images via
electronic detection and display. Which is best? While
we can only form BSE and SE images in a scanning
mode, the answer is not clear for conventional BF
and DF images, and the answer depends somewhat on
the contrast mechanism that is operating in the speci-
men, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 22. Regardless of which
detector you use, scanning images are always displayed
on a computer screen, and this limits the amount of
information in the image. Typically the viewing screen
will have up to 103 lines with a maximum of 103 pixels
per line, giving a total of 106 pixels in each frame.
Currently, high-definition TV displays offer at least
1920 pixels per line and 1080 lines per frame giving a
total of 2� 106 pixels. In contrast, as we just noted, a
TEM image recorded directly onto photographic emul-
sion will have a higher information density, with &gt;107
</p>
<p>pixels of information available in a 100 mm � 100 mm
image. Furthermore, if a scanning image is to be recorded
in a reasonable time, the electron beam can only stay on
each point in the image (i.e., each pixel on the display) for
a very short time. Typical dwell times per pixel are
&lt;&lt;1 ms and this means that the signal-to-noise ratio in
a scanning image is liable to be quite low. The combina-
tion of the lower pixel density compared to a photo-
graphic emulsion and the short dwell times means that,
almost invariably, STEM images are poorer in quality
than static TEM images. However, with the increasing
availability of FEG (S)TEMs, increased probe current
through Cs correction and improved detection and
display technology, STEM digital picture quality com-
pares quite well with analog TEM images. The former
technology will continue to improve with the main chal-
lenge being our ability to read/access data; the latter will
continue to fade away, slowly turning to shades of sepia
with increasing time.

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Although it might seem surprising for such a high-end scientific instrument, the TEM is still
in the age of analog images. We look at fluorescent screens and computer displays and we
still record some of our pictures on photographic film. But darkrooms have disappeared
from many labs and the whole area of electron detection is in a state of rapid flux as new
electronic technology develops. Semiconductor detectors, scintillators, and CCDs all bring
with them the advantage of digital signal collection and therefore the images can be
processed and subsequently stored either magnetically or optically. As we said back in
1996, &lsquo;&lsquo;anything we say about this technology will probably be obsolete before it is pub-
lished.&rsquo;&rsquo; It is probably safe to speculate thatmost analog detection, recording, and storage of
images and DPs will eventually be replaced by digital methods and the CCDmanufacturers
are already pronouncing &lsquo;the end of film.&rsquo; So, TEM will produce numbers, but remember
that we can all interpret images on film from the 1880s. Can you read data from computer
punchcards from the 1970s or from zip disks of the 1990s? A final thought: we encourage
you to read the original papers on TEM. All those images were recorded using a photo-
graphic emulsion.

<p>Pumps and Holders
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>In the past three chapters we&rsquo;ve described the sources, lenses, and detectors that make up a
TEM. The only other parts of the instrument you need to know about in detail are those
that, if you are not careful, can seriously degrade the quality of the information you generate
even if the rest is perfect. These two parts are the holder in which you put your specimen and
the vacuum that surrounds it. While there isn&rsquo;t much you can do to improve the vacuum,
beyond buying a better microscope, there is a lot you can do that will degrade the quality of
the vacuum in the column and, in doing so, contaminate your specimen. So we&rsquo;ll tell you a
few basics about how the vacuum pumps work, and how the vacuum system is put together.
Although the vacuum system is under computer control in most TEMs, you still affect the
vacuum bywhat you put in themicroscope. Consequently, you need to knowwhat not to do
on those occasions when you might otherwise degrade the vacuum.
</p>
<p>The vacuum in the stage of a typical TEM is �10�5Pa, compared with atmospheric
pressure of �105Pa. It is quite remarkable that we can transfer a specimen into the TEM,
reducing the ambient pressure at its surface by 10 orders of magnitude in a matter of a few
seconds. This rapid transfer is a testament to the skills of TEM designers, and particularly
the construction of the specimen holder and the airlock system. Specimen holders are the
physical contact between you and your specimen across this extraordinary vacuum range.
You must transmit all the experimental variables that you want to inflict on your specimen
by way of the holder. The most basic requirement is that you should be able to move the
specimen laterally to look at different areas; to optimize the imaging you should also be able
to move the specimen vertically. In addition we&rsquo;ll describe how you can tilt, rotate, heat,
cool, strain, and bias the materials that you are studying. Unfortunately, the holder also
transmits vibrations, drift, and contamination to the specimen and may be a source of
X-rays that can degrade any analysis that you want to perform. Care of your specimen
holders is extremely important since damaged or worn holders reduce the quality of the data
generated by the microscope. If you are not careful, a $10,000 holder can easily limit the
information generated by a million-dollar TEM.
</p>
<p>8.1 THE VACUUM
</p>
<p>You know already that electrons are strongly scattered
by atoms, which accounts for the versatility of TEM,
and the need for thin specimens. Strong scattering also
occurs in gases and we can&rsquo;t transmit coherent, con-
trolled electron beams very far through air, so all EMs
operate under vacuum. This means that your specimen
has to go through an airlock into the TEM. Therefore,
you can only control your specimen remotely, not
directly, and this makes TEMs more expensive to
build. In addition to permitting the electron beam to
travel through the instrument undisturbed, the vacuum
</p>
<p>also plays a role in keeping the specimen clean (or mak-
ing it dirty). Contamination of the specimen by vacuum-
borne contaminants such as hydrocarbons and water
vapor can be a problem in many aspects of TEM. Gen-
erally, the better the vacuum, the less contamination,
but it is the partial pressure of contaminants, not the
absolute pressure, which is important. Fortunately, the
vacuum systems in most TEMs today are reasonably
clean, fully automated and their operation is transpar-
ent to the user. Despite this, you should have some
understanding of vacuums and how to control them,
so this chapter will cover, very superficially, the princi-
ples of vacuum systems and pumps.
</p>
<p>8 .1 THE VACUUM ........................................................................................................................................................................................ 127</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>First of all, a word on units which, as usual, are
in disarray. The SI unit of pressure is the pascal; other
non-SI units are the torr and the bar. You&rsquo;ll come across
all three units in TEM texts and inmanufacturers&rsquo; hand-
books, so you need to know the conversions.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll mainly use the pascal, but since the torr is still
very common terminology, we&rsquo;ll occasionally put
approximate torr values in parentheses to remind you
of the conversion. Since we deal with very low pressures,
the numbers are small, although we perversely use the
expression &lsquo;high vacuum&rsquo; for these low pressures. We
think of vacuum in terms of rough, low, high, and
ultrahigh. A roughing pump gives a pressure between
100 and 0.1 Pa; 0.1&ndash;10�4Pa is low vacuum and
10�4&ndash;10�7Pa is high vacuum (HV). If the pressure is
&lt;10�7Pa you have an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). These
values are approximate, not standardized definitions. A
typical modern TEMhas a pressure inside the column of
�1.3 � 10�5 Pa (10�7Torr), which is in the HV range.
UHV TEMs operate below 10�7 Pa and the gun region
of an FEG TEM operates at �10�9Pa (10�11Torr). To
have an electron beam inside the TEM that is not scat-
tered significantly by the air molecules in the column,
the pressure must be &lt;�0.1 Pa. This was achievable
with simple mechanical pumps in the early days of the
instrument, but there are good reasons to operate at
much lower pressures (higher vacuums), for which you
need more sophisticated and more expensive apparatus.
</p>
<p>Generally we use one type of pump to create a rough
vacuum and another type to create the higher vacuum.
The TEM is kept permanently under vacuum, unless
it&rsquo;s being repaired or serviced. If you need access to
the inside of the column to change specimens, electron
sources, or photographic plates, you do this via an
airlock system, which can be pumped separately, as
we&rsquo;ll explain later. There are many different kinds of
</p>
<p>pumps used in TEMs, and you often have a choice
when purchasing an instrument. As with most
things, you get what you pay for; a clean UHV
system is very expensive. We can divide pumps into
roughing pumps and HV/UHV pumps, as we&rsquo;ll now
discuss.
</p>
<p>8.2 ROUGHING PUMPS
</p>
<p>The most common roughing pump is a mechanical (rotary)
pump in which a belt-driven, eccentrically mounted recipro-
cating mechanism sucks air through an inlet valve into a
chamber and expels it through an exit valve, as shown in
Figure 8.1. Such pumps are very reliable, relatively inexpen-
sive, noisy, and dirty and only lower the pressure to
�10�1Pa (�10�3Torr). Mechanical pumps should be
housed outside your TEM room, and connected to the
column through a line that doesn&rsquo;t transmit their vibration.
These pumps use a hydrocarbon oil as a medium. If you
have such a pump, the line from the pump to the vacuum
should contain a foreline trap to condense out oil vapor
before it is deposited in the column. Also, the exhaust line
from the pump must also be trapped to prevent (possibly
carcinogenic) oil vapor escaping into the room where you
are working. There are alternative &lsquo;dry&rsquo; roughing pumps
which do not use oil. These are more expensive and some-
what less reliable; they do not pump to such low pressure.
</p>
<p>PRESSURE
1 Torr is � 130Pa
1 Pa is 7.5� 10�3Torr
One bar is atmospheric pressure (�760Torr) and is
equivalent to �105Pa.
The name is the torr; the unit is the Torr, but either
way the torr is not an accepted SI unit.
100&ndash;0.1 Pa (�1&ndash;10�3Torr) is a rough vacuum.
0.1&ndash;10�4Pa (�10�3&ndash;10�6Torr) is low vacuum.
10�4&ndash;10�7Pa (�10�6&ndash;10�9Torr) is high vacuum
(HV).
&lt;10�7Pa (�10�9Torr) is ultrahigh vacuum (UHV).
Be careful when you hear a phrase like &lsquo;&lsquo;the vacuum
in the gun is 10�8&rsquo;&rsquo; and remember the pascal unit is Pa
and the torr unit is Torr.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 8.1. A mechanical pump for roughing vacuums. The eccentric
</p>
<p>motion of the pump creates a vacuum in the RH side when it rotates and
</p>
<p>the vacuum sucks air into the inlet valve. As the cylinder rotates further, it
</p>
<p>cuts off the inlet and forces the air through the outlet on the LH side,
</p>
<p>creating a vacuum again on the inlet side as it does so. Because of the
</p>
<p>constant contact between the rotating cylinder and the inside of the pump,
</p>
<p>oil is needed to reduce frictional heating.

<p>8.3 HIGH/ULTRAHIGH VACUUM PUMPS
</p>
<p>8.3.A Diffusion Pumps
</p>
<p>These pumps use a hot plate to boil oil, which then
forms a series of concentric vapor jets. The jets drag
air molecules out of the microscope as shown in
Figure 8.2, then condense onto a cold surface, freeing
the air molecules which are extracted by the mechanical
pump &lsquo;backing&rsquo; the diffusion pump. While this may
seem an inefficient way to move air, diffusion pumps
can in fact transport more than a hundred liters of air
per second, which is quite sufficient to pump out a TEM
column. With no moving parts, diffusion pumps are
inexpensive and very reliable, but they need external
water cooling to aid condensation of the vapor. Failure
of the cooling water supply and burnout of the hot plate
are about the only possible causes of failure. The
absence of moving parts ensures vibration-free opera-
tion. As with the mechanical pump, the oil diffusion
</p>
<p>pump would contaminate the vacuum in the TEM if
oil vapor were to escape into the column. To minimize
this you must use synthetic nonhydrocarbon oils with
low vapor pressures, such as FomblinTM or Santo-
vacTM. (Never use a silicone-based oil, of course.) A
liquid-N2 cold trap sits on top of the pump and con-
denses out any residual oil molecules. If you have diffu-
sion pumps you must keep the cold traps full of liquid
N2 to maintain a clean system.
</p>
<p>Diffusion pumps are capable of very efficient pump-
ing from �10�1 to �10�9Pa (10�11Torr) and, if prop-
erly trapped, will provide a clean UHV system that is
very reliable. The VG series UHVDSTEMs use only oil
diffusion pumps to attain UHV conditions.
</p>
<p>8.3.B Turbomolecular Pumps
</p>
<p>Turbomolecular pumps, or turbopumps, as the name
implies, use a turbine to force gases from the microscope.
They have many parts moving at high speeds (in excess of
20,000&ndash;50,000 rpm is common), so they are more liable to
fail than diffusion pumps. The mechanics of the pump are
very simple as you can appreciate from Figure 8.3. They
do not use oil so they don&rsquo;t introduce hydrocarbons to
contaminate the microscope, and the best models (unlike
earlier versions) are very quiet and almost vibration-free.
In fact, modern turbopumps are being used to prepump
the specimen chamber when this is critical, as in the cryo-
transfer technique (see Section 8.10). If you buy a turbo-
pump, make sure to specify that its use will not transmit
vibrations to the TEMcolumn, where it would destroy the
image resolution. The turbopump can start (slowly) at
</p>
<p>FIGURE 8.2. Principles of diffusion pump operation. A heater plate at
</p>
<p>the base of the pump boils synthetic oil. The expansion of the oil vapor on
</p>
<p>boiling creates a pressure which forces the vapor up the central column
</p>
<p>and out of several holes . The stream of oil vapor pulls gas molecules out
</p>
<p>of the top of the pump down to the base where the oil condenses and the
</p>
<p>air is pumped out of the base by a mechanical backing pump.
</p>
<p>THE ROOM
The microscope room should be acoustically quiet.
You should never feel a draft. All computers with
fans should be replaced or moved out of the room&mdash;
the fan just moves heat around the room. All moni-
tors should be flat panels.
</p>

</p>
<p>ing more than a small turbine that rotates at high speed. Like a jet turbine
</p>
<p>it pulls air in at the front end and forces it out of the back. The blades are
</p>
<p>designed like airfoils to enhance the flow of gas through the system.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ambient pressures, increasing speed as the pressure is
lowered, ultimately providing UHV conditions at high
enough speeds. It is usual, however, to back the turbo-
pump with a dry mechanical pump.
</p>
<p>8.3.C Ion Pumps
</p>
<p>Ion pumps do not contain oil, so they cannot contaminate
the TEM column. They also have no moving parts, relying
solely on the ionization process to remove air. The ion
pump emits electrons from a cathode. These ions spiral in
a magnetic field (see Section 6.3) and ionize air molecules,
which are then attracted to the cathode. The energetic gas
ions sputter Ti atoms from the cathode and they condense
throughout the pump chamber, mainly on the cylindrical
anode, trapping gas atoms. Thus ion pumps remove gas
atoms in twoways; by chemisorption on the anode surfaces
and by electrical attraction to the cathodes. The smaller the
ion current between the electrodes, the lower the vacuum,
so the pump acts as its own vacuum gauge. Ion pumps are
only efficient at high vacuums, so they are usually
switched on after a diffusion pump has lowered the pres-
sure to &lt;�10�3Pa (10�5Torr). It is common to add ion
pumps directly to the stage or gun chambers of TEMs to
focus their pumping action on these important regions.
Since these pumps are very common on TEMs, we
include a diagram (Figure 8.4) showing how they operate.
</p>
<p>8.3.D Cryogenic (Adsorption) Pumps
</p>
<p>As the name implies, cryogenic pumps (cryopumps)
rely on liquid N2 to cool molecular sieves with large
surface areas. The cold surface efficiently removes air
molecules from ambient pressure down to �10�4Pa
(10�6Torr). Because they are oil-free, cryopumps are
also used to back ion pumps and prevent their acci-
dental contamination through backstreaming from
oil-bearing pumps.
</p>
<p>We also use cold surfaces to enhance vacuums in the
stage of most non-UHV TEMs. Such &lsquo;cold fingers&rsquo; or
&lsquo;anticontaminators&rsquo; provide an alternative site (rather
than your specimen) for condensation of residual com-
ponents in the vacuum.
</p>
<p>The same is true if the anticontaminator in your
stage is allowed to warm up; then it will degrade the
vacuum around your specimen. So you must use
another pump such as a diffusion or mechanical
pump to remove the air molecules as they are released
from captivity. Otherwise, this outgassing will degrade
the quality of the vacuum around your specimen,
increasing contamination.
</p>
<p>8.4 THE WHOLE SYSTEM
</p>
<p>As shown schematically in Figure 8.5 the modern TEM
has at least two separate pumping systems: one that
evacuates the column and one that pumps the camera
and screen chamber. We pump the camera separately
because the film is one of the primary causes of vacuum
degradation since outgassing occurs from the emulsion
that contains the AgI grains. So this part of the TEM is
usually pumped by a combination mechanical/diffusion
pump. The stage is often pumped by a separate ion
pump, turbopump, or cryopump, or some combination
of these. If the instrument has an FEG, then there is a
separate UHV pumping system for the gun region,
which often consists of several ion pumps. Each part
of the vacuum system consists of roughing pumps
(mechanical or turbo) that pump out the appropriate
part of the microscope to give the vacuum where the
HV/UHV pumps can start to operate.
</p>
<p>Looking at Figure 8.5, there are three valves, which
are now all computer controlled.
</p>
<p>&amp; #1 connects the mechanical pump to the column (the
roughing valve).
</p>
<p>FIGURE 8.4. Schematic diagram showing how ion pumps trap ionized
</p>
<p>gas atoms by layers of Ti atoms at electrodes. Once trapped, the ions
</p>
<p>cannot escape until the pump is turned off.
</p>
<p>TRAPPING PUMPS
Ion pumps and cryopumps are trapping pumps. They
keep the air molecules within them and release them
when turned off or warmed up, respectively.
</p>
<p>EXHAUST PUMPS
Mechanical, diffusion, and turbopumps are all
exhaust pumps; they pull in air from one end and
expel it from the other.
</p>
<p>130 ...................................................................................................................................................................................PUMPS AND HOLDERS</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; #2 connects the mechanical pump to the bottom of
the diffusion pump (the backing valve).
</p>
<p>&amp; #3 connects the diffusion pump directly to the TEM
column (the butterfly valve).
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re pumping down from atmospheric pressure,
you first use the mechanical pump to back out the
diffusion pump, till it gets to a low enough pressure so
its heater can be safely switched on without oxidizing.
So close #1, open #2, and close #3.
</p>
<p>When the diffusion pump is warmed up, you rough
out the column: open #1, close #2, and #3, until the
</p>
<p>column is at a low enough pressure that the diffusion
pump can be used.
</p>
<p>At this point, close #1, open #2, and then #3, so the
diffusion pump is open to the TEM and may be con-
tinuously backed by the mechanical pump. The better
approach incorporates a vacuum reservoir between the
mechanical and diffusion pumps. When the reservoir is
pumped to &lt; 0.1 Pa, the mechanical pump is closed off
and the diffusion pump exhausts into the reservoir.
When the pressure builds in the reservoir, the mechan-
ical pump will automatically switch on and lower the
pressure.
</p>
<p>Similar arrangements work for other pumps; e.g.,
a diffusion pump may be used to lower the pressure
in the stage and gun sufficiently for the ion pumps
to be switched on, and so on. In most TEMs the
stage and gun have significantly better vacuums than
the camera region, so the camera/screen is isolated
from the rest of the column by a differential pump-
ing aperture (not shown in Figure 8.5). This aperture
often coincides with the BFP of the projector lens,
since all the electrons have to pass through it and
the DP in the BFP localizes all the electron trajec-
tories close to the optic axis. A similar arrangement
exists between the stage and gun in FEG systems to
preserve the tip in case of a vacuum leak in the
stage.
</p>
<p>The advent of high-quality digital recording
which will remove the need for film in the camera
will do more to improve the quality of vacuums in
TEMs than any advances in pumping technology.
</p>
<p>8.5 LEAK DETECTION
</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Nature abhors a vacuum,&rsquo;&rsquo; as Franois Rabelais said in
1534. That&rsquo;s the reason why the pumps must keep
pumping: the TEM leaks. But some leaks are too
large for the pumps to handle, and then the instrument
performance degrades. If you can&rsquo;t run the electron
gun, your TEM is useless. Under these circumstances,
you have to find the leak, cure it, and repump the
instrument, (this is usually a job for your service engi-
neer) but some labs or older TEMs don&rsquo;t have service
contracts. Leak detection involves using a mass spec-
trometer, which can be put into the pumping lines of
the microscope. You then release helium gas close to
the various parts of the TEM where you suspect a leak
(the stage airlock, which sees a lot of use, is a common
point of failure). The small He atoms are relatively
easily sucked into the column through any leak and
register on the mass spectrometer. When a leak is iso-
lated, the TEM may have to be opened to the atmo-
sphere to permit replacement of the defective part, such
as the O-ring seals.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The most common cause of a leak is your specimen
holder. The O-ring seal on the shaft of a side-entry
holder (see the second half of this chapter) is easily
contaminated with dust or a hair since it is continually
inserted and extracted from the column, and left on the
bench while you pore over it. Never touch the O-ring,
make sure it doesn&rsquo;t dry out, but if it does (because you
don&rsquo;t have someone else looking after the TEM), lubri-
cate it with a very thin film of vacuum grease.
</p>
<p>After repairing a leak, when you&rsquo;ve pumped down
again, it is often useful to &lsquo;bake&rsquo; the column. Baking
means heating the internal surfaces to &gt;1008C
(or &gt;150&ndash;2008C in UHV TEMs) to boil off residual
water vapor and hydrocarbons that may have entered
the system when it was down to air. Usually, you can
achieve the bakeout by leaving the lenses running with-
out their cooling water (check this very carefully with
the manufacturer before proceeding). In some cases,
special heating panels are constructed around the col-
umn. Baking can also introduce other leaks as the whole
system expands and then contracts, so sometimes leak
detection and cure is an iterative process. For UHV
systems, you must bake to reach the ultimate vacuum,
and the higher the temperature the better.
</p>
<p>Be wary, however, since sometimes the TEM acces-
sories, such as XEDS and EELS systems, are not
designed to be baked to the same high temperature as
the column.
</p>
<p>8.6 CONTAMINATION: HYDROCARBONS
AND WATER VAPOR
</p>
<p>As we said right at the start of the chapter, the vacuum
(or rather what is still present in the column) can be a
source of contamination. Residual hydrocarbons from
the pump oil crack under the electron beam. Carbo-
naceous material then deposits on your carefully
thinned specimen, making it difficult to do sensible
high-resolution imaging or microanalysis. So a clean
vacuum (one in which the hydrocarbon partial
pressure is &lt; 10�9Pa) is essential. Fortunately, most
modern TEMs are relatively contamination-free, par-
ticularly if you use synthetic oils and appropriate traps
on the pumps. (See also Section 8.12.)
</p>
<p>However, even if you&rsquo;ve paid dearly for a clean
vacuum system, contamination often occurs; it comes
primarily through the airlock with your specimen. You
can minimize this by heating the specimen to&gt;1008C in
a heating holder or with a halogen lamp in the prepump
chamber, or cooling the specimen to liquid-N2 tempera-
tures in a cooling holder. It may help if the prepump
chamber is pumped with an oil-free pump. More
recently, plasma cleaning of the specimen holder and
specimen prior to insertion in the TEM has proven a
very successful way to ensure a clean specimen (more on
this in Section 8.12).
</p>
<p>Polymers and biological specimens can easily
introduce hydrocarbon contaminants, as they outgas
in the vacuum, so it is sensible to cool such specimens
(since heating or plasma cleaning destroys them).
However, when you cool your specimen, it attracts
water vapor which condenses as ice on the surface;
so load your specimen first, then cool it down in the
TEM before you switch on the beam. A low partial
pressure of H2O in the vacuum is obviously essential.
Also, warm up any cooled specimens in the TEM
before bringing them out to ambient atmosphere,
otherwise they will immediately ice up (unless it&rsquo;s a
very dry winter&rsquo;s day). There will be more about this in
the sections on specimen holders.
</p>
<p>In addition to the specimen, you personally can be a
major source of contamination. Take care never to touch
anything that will enter the vacuum, i.e., the specimen
itself, the grids, specimen holder (beyond the O-ring seal
on the rod), clamping rings, replacement diaphragms,
new filaments, replacement Wehnelt, components of
XEDS and EELS systems, etc. Use latex gloves when-
ever you load a specimen, and don&rsquo;t breathe on it. Store
specimen holders and specimens in a dry box containing
a desiccant such as silica gel, which should be replaced
regularly. Always prepump fresh film in a vacuum desic-
cator (which is sometimes integrated into the TEM itself
but probably best done elsewhere). Better still, never use
film if you can avoid it. Simple precautions like this will
minimize contamination of your specimens and the
microscope in general and bring a much greater return
in terms of good data per TEM session.
</p>
<p>8.7 SPECIMEN HOLDERS AND STAGES
</p>
<p>To look at your specimen, place it in a specimen
holder and insert this assembly into the TEM stage.
Therefore, there are two key components which are
often not separated, namely, the holder and the stage.
In this part of the chapter, we will emphasize the
holder but the stage is also critical. Suitable design of
the stage is the essential precursor to computer-con-
trolled, remotely accessed TEM, which is already
happening.
</p>
<p>The cold trap, cold finger, or cryo-blades are a crit-
ical part of the stage. Ideally, this cold finger will com-
pletely surround the specimen: it cryo-pumps the region
around the specimen. However, the cold surfaces,
usually brass, provide a source of stray electrons and
X-rays which is undesirable for AEM (see Chapter 33),
so these blades should be removable for AEM.
</p>
<p>X-ray diffractometers use goniometers to hold and tilt
the specimen; so do TEMs. Conventional SEMs use a
stub on which you mount the specimen so that you can
bring the specimen close to the objective lens. However,
some high-resolution SEMs use a specimen holder which
</p>
<p>132 ...................................................................................................................................................................................PUMPS AND HOLDERS</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is very similar to those used in the TEM, because the
specimen is inserted inside the lens, rather than under-
neath and outside it.
</p>
<p>The reason the specimen holder is so important in
TEM is that your specimen must invariably be located
within the objective lens and the aberrations associated
with the objective lens determine the resolution of the
TEM.
</p>
<p>Historically, microscopists have used two different
designs and a lot of what you&rsquo;ll read here or elsewhere
has a strong historical background.
</p>
<p>&amp; The traditional side-entry holder is a rod with a
motor attached to tilt and/or rotate the specimen
and a lead connecting it to a power supply and
control box, or liquid-N2 dewar.
</p>
<p>&amp; The traditional top-entry holder is a cartridge which
you load into the TEM but is detached from the out-
side world when you use the microscope.
</p>
<p>The actual cup that holds your specimen is either 2.3 or
3.05mm in diameter, so the specimen disk or support grid
has to be the same dimension, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 10.
The reasons for these dimensions are again partly histor-
ical. In the top-entry holder the specimen and part of the
holder fit through the bore of the upper polepiece (see
Figures 6.7 and 6.8). Clearly, the specimenmust be smaller
than the bore diameter. So the original top-entry holders
used small specimens.
</p>
<p>Side-entry holders are more versatile and larger spec-
imen dimensions first appeared when they were intro-
duced. However, side-entry holders connect the
specimen directly to the outside world via a long lever
arm, which is undesirable, unstable, and also not neces-
sary in many cases! Ideally, the side-entry holder should
leave the specimen in the stage, not connected to the
outside world, and all manipulations should be con-
ducted through the stage itself, not the holder. This ideal
is being approached as stages become more computer-
controlled.
</p>
<p>8.8 SIDE-ENTRY HOLDERS
</p>
<p>Side-entry holders are now the standard, although their
design has changed quite radically in recent years. The
traditional design is shown in Figure 8.6. The key parts
of this holder are:
</p>
<p>&amp; The O-ring, which is one mechanical link to the
microscope column. Some holders have two
O-rings and the gap between the O-rings is pumped
separately to improve the vacuum.
</p>
<p>&amp; The jewel bearing, which is the other mechanical
link to the microscope column. You push on this
bearing to move your specimen back and forth and
from side to side. Like the O-ring, you must keep
the bearing clean otherwise the specimen will not
be stable.
</p>
<p>&amp; The cup, which actually holds your specimen and
thus provides the immediate environment which is
seen by stray electrons and any X-rays coming down
the column. So cups in holders for AEM are made of
Be to minimize the generation of X-rays that would
interfere with microanalysis.
</p>
<p>&amp; The clamping ring or screw, which holds the speci-
men in the cup. This ring (not shown in the figure),
which may also be Be, must be carefully designed.
It must hold your specimen firmly (so, e.g., mag-
netic disks cannot be pulled out of the cup by the
lens field). However, the ring must not be so diffi-
cult to tighten that you put undue pressure on
your specimen. Brittle disks may break as you
are loading them. There are two kinds of retaining
rings: screw-thread rings, which are easier to con-
trol and do not damage metals, but you&rsquo;ll find they
may break ceramics because they transfer shear
stresses to the disk; spring clips are difficult for
the novice to master, but with practice you&rsquo;ll find
they offer more control over the load that you put
on the specimen, so we recommend them for the
experienced ceramist. Unfortunately, no one we
know makes Be spring clips!
</p>
<p>In a more modern design, the jewel bearing is
omitted so that the holder is supported at just one
pivot point.
</p>
<p>THE WORD &lsquo;TRADITIONAL&rsquo;
Holders are changing; new manufacturers and new
capabilities are emerging. Ideally, the holder should
not be moved after it is inserted in the TEM.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 8.6. Principal parts of a side-entry holder that is held in the
</p>
<p>goniometer stage. The specimen is clamped into the cup at the end of the
</p>
<p>rod. A small jewel at the end of the rod (usually sapphire) fits into another
</p>
<p>jewel bearing in the stage to provide a stable base for manipulating the
</p>
<p>specimen. The O-ring seals the end of the holder inside the vacuum.
</p>
<p>Manipulating the specimen is accomplished from outside the column via
</p>
<p>controls within the rod. (See Figures 8.8&ndash;8.11 to see just where the speci-
</p>
<p>men goes.)

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.9 TOP-ENTRY HOLDERS
</p>
<p>Top-entry holders are becoming less common because
they essentially preclude XEDS analysis in the TEM.
Also, it is more difficult to design such holders so that
the specimen can be manipulated (e.g., rotated or
strained). Their great advantage was that they were
much less susceptible to drift since they were not con-
nected directly to the outside, so early HRTEM
required top-entry holders. Today, however, nearly all
TEMs up to 400 kV use side-entry holders; only the
DSTEMs retain the top-entry (bottom entry?) design.
</p>
<p>Another drawback of such holders is that the
bore of the objective lens must be asymmetric
(using an upper and a lower polepiece), which actu-
ally limits the ultimate resolution by constraining the
</p>
<p>lens designer. Figure 8.7 shows a schematic diagram
of such a holder.
</p>
<p>8.10 TILT AND ROTATE HOLDERS
</p>
<p>One feature of TEMs which may surprise you if you are
a new user is that a wide variety of holders is available
for the TEM. Figure 8.8 shows illustrations of these
different designs for the side-entry holder:
</p>
<p>&amp; Single-tilt holder: This is the basic holder with which
any novice should start practicing. You can only tilt
around the axis of the rod. It is relatively cheap,
robust, and can at least give you some idea of the
usefulness of tilting a specimen for diffraction-con-
trast studies.
</p>
<p>&amp; Quick change holder: This is also a single-tilt holder
that clamps the specimen with a lever arm which you
raise and lower onto your disk or grid. It doesn&rsquo;t put
a high stress on the specimen, but it doesn&rsquo;t hold it
very strongly either. Don&rsquo;t use it for magnetic speci-
mens, but it can be great for ceramics. Different
retainers can be substituted for the clamp as shown
in Figure 8.8 (bottom), creating a more versatile
multipurpose holder
</p>
<p>&amp; Multiple-specimen holder: This is usually a single-tilt
holder, but you can load up to five specimens into
the column at one time as shown in Figure 8.9A. A
two-specimen, double-tilt version is also available
(Figure 8.9B). Such holders can be useful if you are
not very good at specimen preparation, or you want
to compare different specimens under identical con-
ditions without turning off the beam. However, in
</p>

</p>
<p>(B)
</p>
<p>FIGURE 8.7. Top-entry holder: (A) cross section; (B) top view. The car-
</p>
<p>tridge has a cone shape which fits into the tapered bore of the objective lens
</p>
<p>polepiece. The specimen sits in a cup at the base of a column through the
</p>
<p>cone down which the incident beam travels. Simple manipulations such as
</p>
<p>tilting or rotating require complex micromechanical design, since the speci-
</p>
<p>men is at the base of the cartridge and completely surrounded by the
</p>
<p>polepiece. To tilt, e.g., as shown in (A), push rods are pressed against springs
</p>
<p>in two orthogonal directions, displacing a central ring around the column
</p>
<p>(see B), thus tilting the specimen cup.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 8.8. Examples of different designs for the side-entry holder.
</p>
<p>From the top, they are: a rotation holder, a heating holder, a cooling
</p>
<p>holder, a double-tilt holder, and a single-tilt holder.
</p>
<p>134 ...................................................................................................................................................................................PUMPS AND HOLDERS</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>modern TEMs, specimen exchange is relatively
quick, except in UHV instruments where the multi-
holder would probably be more useful although it is
less common.
</p>
<p>&amp; Bulk specimen holder: This holder is used for surface
imaging and diffraction, e.g., using SE or BSE in a
STEM or for reflection diffraction and imaging in a
TEM (see Chapter 29 for more about these tech-
niques). The bulk specimen is larger than the tradi-
tional 3-mmdisk (usually�10mm� 5mm) so if you
can create a thin specimen of these dimensions, the
bulk holder will allow you to sample more of your
material at one time (Figure 8.10).
</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t always think that you are limited to 3-mm
specimens!
</p>
<p>&amp; Double-tilt holder: This is the most popular holder
since it gives you the most flexibility in orienting the
specimen. It is absolutely essential for imaging and
diffraction studies of crystalline specimens. The tilt
axes are fixed as two orthogonal directions. In some
designs, you can remove the cup while the specimen
is in place which means that you can reinsert your
specimen in the same orientation. This feature is
extremely useful if your specimen is robust.
</p>
<p>&amp; Tilt-rotate holder:You would often like to be able to
orient your specimen parallel to the tilt axis (along
the rod). This holder lets you do just that. It&rsquo;s a
strength for the side-entry holder: one tilt axis is
always parallel to the rod of the holder which also
gives the largest tilt angle.
</p>
<p>&amp; Low-background holder: The cup and clamping ring
are made of Be to minimize the generation of brems-
strahlung X-rays and characteristic X-rays. So they
are required for XEDS studies. They can be double
or single tilt and may be cooled also.
</p>
<p>&amp; Tomography holder: This is a new design that
allows you to tilt the sample through a full 3608.
It&rsquo;s ideal for looking at needles (like an AFM or
atom-probe tip).
</p>
<p>8.11 IN-SITU HOLDERS
</p>
<p>Special holders have been developed that allow you to
change your specimen while you observe it in the TEM;
in other words you can do experiments (heat, cool,
strain, twist, compress, etc.) on a specimen in the TEM.
</p>
<p>&amp; Heating holder: Such holders in a conventional TEM
can go to �13008C which is measured by a thermo-
couple attached to the cup. In HVEMs, the tempera-
ture can go higher because of the larger gap between
the polepieces. You have to be careful to calibrate
the temperature and remember that the temperature
may be different for different specimens. You should
also be sure that the material you are studying does
not form a eutectic alloy with the material forming
the holder! If the eutectic does form it will have a
lower melting point, so youmay deposit part of your
specimen and the holder on the objective lens, or
down onto the screen, if the microscope is well
aligned.
</p>
<p>&amp; Cooling holder:This is available for either liquid-N2or
liquid-He temperatures. These holders, which can be
single or double tilt, are a great asset forXEDS,EELS,
and CBED studies since they minimize surface-borne
contamination. They are also essential for in-situ
studies of superconducting materials and ideal for
polymers or biological tissue. However, you should
remember that the cold holder can also act as a small
cryo-pump so that it actually attracts contamination.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Since you are necessarily changing the temperature at
the specimen relative to its surroundings, be prepared
for specimendrift. It takes time for thewhole system to
stabilize. The Polara from FEI is a modification of the
cooling holder which fits in a special dedicated stage;
the tip of the holder detaches from the rod with
obvious advantages.
</p>
<p>&amp; Cryo-transfer holder: Certain specimens are pre-
pared at cryogenic temperatures such as liquids,
latex emulsions, and tissue in general. This holder
permits you to transfer such cold specimens into the
TEM without water vapor from the atmosphere
condensing as ice on the surface.
</p>
<p>&amp; Straining holder: This holder clamps the specimen
at both ends then applies a load to one end, via a
load cell or screw-thread mechanism, as shown in
Figure 8.11. The sample can be in the shape of a
small tensile specimen and it is thinned in the middle
of the gauge length (see inset). The motion of dis-
locations, cracks, etc., are then easily monitored, so a
video camera is an essential accessory. You can vary
the load, to study cyclic as well as tensile loading,
and the strain rate is another variable that is easily
controlled. In Figure 8.11 a furnace is present, so the
specimen can be heated while under load. The use of
piezoelectric drives is leading to great improvements
in this type of holder.
</p>
<p>&amp; Probing holders: These are like AFM holders for the
TEM. You can use them to &lsquo;poke&rsquo; your specimens&mdash;
just like an AFM, STM, or an indenter&mdash;while you
observe the effect in the TEM.
</p>
<p>&amp; EBIC and CL holders: The essential feature is the
electrical feed-through that allows you to control the
</p>
<p>charge recombination in a semiconductor or certain
mineral specimens by applying a bias across the
specimen surface.
</p>
<p>Beware: heating and straining holders, in particular,
can produce effects in thin foils that are totally uncharac-
teristic of your bulk sample. So youmust use these holders
carefully and interpret your results cautiously. Often, sur-
face reactions will dominate internal reactions when you
are trying to induce a phase transformation by heating.
The surface may also stop grain boundaries from migrat-
ing at temperatures where they would do so in the bulk
material. Obviously, defect motion under applied stress
may also be strongly affected since the 3D stress field will
be very different in bulk specimens compared to thin foils.
</p>
<p>These problems can be overcome to some extent if
you use thicker specimens and examine them in an
HVEM, or at least an IVEM, and the whole field of in
situ studies, particularly, heating and/or straining, is
best performed in such microscopes (Butler and Hale
1981 and Section 29.12). However, the high-energy elec-
trons in these microscopes may introduce lattice defects
that affect the very phenomenon that you want to study,
e.g., beam-induced vacancies can change diffusional
phase-transformation kinetics very easily.
</p>
<p>It is also possible, but muchmore difficult and expen-
sive, to manipulate specimens in top-entry stages. The

<p>used elsewhere to provide a method to clean the sample
before growing thin films on the sample by molecular-
beam epitaxy (MBE) or thermal evaporation.
</p>
<p>One of the reasons for using higher accelerating
voltages is that this gives more room in the specimen-
stage region. Thus, even 400-kV microscopes can be
fitted with a small, differentially pumped environmental
chamber. Such a chamber allows in situ studies of cor-
rosion, degradation of catalysts, etc., especially when
combined with a heating holder.
</p>
<p>Development of new holders and their use for in-situ
studies is going to be one of the most exciting topics in
TEM.We&rsquo;ll expand on this topic in the companion text.
</p>
<p>8.12 PLASMA CLEANERS
</p>
<p>Plasma cleaners have been available for removing
surface contamination and modifying surfaces (for
example, changing wettability) for over 30 years. The
unit is now marketed as a small box (e.g., as shown in
Figure 8.14A) that can usually accommodate one speci-
men holder; the rod of the holder is placed inside a
plasma chamber, as shown in Figure 8.14B, just before
it goes into the TEM. Plasma cleaners have long been
used to modify/clean surfaces of glass, semiconductors
and other ceramics, metals, and even polymers and
</p>
<p>biomaterials. The development of plasma cleaners for
cleaning both the TEM holder (the part that goes into
the vacuum of the TEM) andmore specifically the speci-
men that has already been placed in the TEM holder, is
more recent, but the possibilities are clear. This cleaning
is generally regarded as essential for small-probe AEM.
Most of the contamination that occurs in the electron
beam originates on your specimen, not from a &lsquo;dirty&rsquo;
vacuum.
</p>
<p>Although the processes occurring in the plasma are
complex (like the plasma itself) the basic idea is illus-
trated by the removal of hydrocarbon contamination on
the specimen shown in Figure 8.15A. The plasma con-
sists of a mixture of energetic electrons and ions that
bombard the surface and break the C&ndash;H bonds. With
short duration exposure, the surface of the specimen
itself is essentially unaffected. The hydrocarbon is thus
gradually reduced in molecular weight and pumped
away in the vacuum of the cleaner. The user has some
flexibility in the choice of the plasma gas although the
manufacturer usually limits this. Although many gasses
can be used in principle, O2, N2, and Ar are the most
common. The graph in Figure 8.15B shows the effect of
using an oxygen plasma&mdash;it reduces the rate at which
the contamination grows under the electron probe; the
effect of the oxygen-reactive gas is similar to that found
when using iodine in the ion mill.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The vacuum and the holder are the two parts of the TEM that most closely affect your
specimen. You have to treat both carefully if you want to be sure of getting the most out of
your TEM. The vacuum is usually automated, so you don&rsquo;t have too much control over it.
However, you can degrade the vacuum easily if you are a careless operator; e.g., if you don&rsquo;t
bother to prepump your film. You don&rsquo;t want to touch any part (including the specimen
holder) that will go into the vacuum. In fact, you should treat the specimen holder as if it
were a rare jewel; it may actually contain a couple of synthetic ones and it certainly costs as
much as a diamond of several carats! (It&rsquo;s also probably worthmore than its weight in gold.)
</p>
<p>With the range of holders available today, you can conduct many materials science
experiments on your thin specimen while observing it in the TEM. However, if you&rsquo;re
looking at crystalline material, the most common manipulation is still tilting the specimen
in two orthogonal directions to orient different crystal planes parallel to the electron beam.
You&rsquo;ll understand more fully why this is important after you&rsquo;ve finished reading Parts 2
and 3 (and even in Part 4).

<p>The Instrument
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Over the preceding four chapters we&rsquo;ve now introduced all the essential components of the
TEM and it&rsquo;s time to see how the guns (Chapter 5), lenses (Chapter 6), detectors/screens
(Chapter 7), and specimen holders (Chapter 8) are combined to form the instrument. Just as
we do for the VLM, it&rsquo;s convenient to divide up the TEM into three components: the
illumination system, the objective lens/stage, and the imaging system. The illumination
system comprises the gun and the condenser lenses and its role is to take the electrons from
the source and transfer them to your specimen. You can operate the illumination system in
two principal modes: parallel beam and convergent beam. The first mode is used primarily
for TEM imaging and selected-area diffraction (SAD), while the second is used mainly for
scanning (STEM) imaging, analysis via X-ray and electron spectrometry, and convergent-
beam electron diffraction (CBED).
</p>
<p>The objective lens and the specimen holder/stage system is the heart of the TEM. This
critical region usually extends over a distance of �10mm at the center of the TEM. Here is
where all of the beam-specimen interactions take place and the two fundamental TEM
operations occur, namely, the creation of the various images and DPs that are subsequently
magnified for viewing and recording. Clearly the objective lens is the most important lens in
a TEM because its quality determines the quality of all the information about the specimen
that we seek. Because of the various defects inherent in magnetic lenses, our specimens must
be placed close to the center of the objective lens and this restricts our ability to manipulate
the specimen and gain access to the various signals generated. However, as we&rsquo;ve mentioned
many times already, we can now overcome many of the defects that limit lens performance
by inserting complex aberration-correction systems into the column, but only the most
expensive TEMs are so equipped.
</p>
<p>The imaging system uses several lenses to magnify the image or the DP produced by the
objective lens and to focus these on the viewing screen or computer display via a detector,
CCD, or TV camera.We&rsquo;ll refer to the magnifying lenses as the intermediate and diffraction
lenses and the final lens as the projector lens (since it projects the final image or DP onto the
viewing screen or detector). All TEM operations involve observing the electrons on a screen
of some form, with or without a specimen in place. In many current TEMs you will have a
button for focus, another for magnification, and another for diffraction (or a slide on the
computer screen). These three components, the illumination system, stage, and imaging
system, are often called the &lsquo;column&rsquo;, for obvious reasons. Throughout this book, the
electrons will invariably be shown as traveling &lsquo;down&rsquo; the column because this is the
construction of most (but not all) TEMs.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to go through the principal functions of the many
lenses in the column and give you some feel for what is happening in the microscope
when you press a button, rotate a knob or trackball, or drag your mouse. The better
you understand the operation of a TEM, the more you can be sure that you are getting
the most out of it.
</p>
<p>We do NOT intend to teach you how to operate a specific TEM since individual
manufacturers choose different ways to manipulate the many lenses, apertures, deflectors,
etc., in the TEM column to achieve the same ends. What we will do is introduce specific
operational procedures that we hope are generic enough such that you should, in concert
with the operating manual of your own TEM, be able to carry out all the basic procedures.

<p>9.1 THE ILLUMINATION SYSTEM
</p>
<p>The illumination system takes the electrons from the
</p>
<p>gun and transfers them to the specimen giving either a
</p>
<p>broad beam or a focused beam (often called a &lsquo;probe&rsquo; or
</p>
<p>&lsquo;spot&rsquo;) entering the specimen. We can think of these two
</p>
<p>cases as analogous to a floodlight or a spotlight. In
</p>
<p>Chapter 5 we described how the gun produces an
</p>
<p>image of the source (called a crossover). This crossover
</p>
<p>acts as the object for the first lens in the illumination
</p>
<p>system that consists of several condenser lenses (C1,
</p>
<p>etc.). We will discuss the two different ways to use the
</p>
<p>illumination system: formation of a parallel electron
</p>
<p>beam (although it is almost never truly parallel) or a
</p>
<p>convergent beam (which may be divergent).
</p>
<p>9.1.A TEM Operation Using a Parallel Beam
</p>
<p>In the traditional TEM mode, the first two condenser
lenses (C1, C2) are adjusted to illuminate the specimen
with a parallel beam of electrons, typically several
micrometers across at reasonable magnifications
(20,000�&ndash;100,000�). As shown in Figure 9.1, the
C1 lens first forms an image of the gun crossover. In
the case of a thermionic source, the original crossover
may be several tens ofmicrometers across, and this cross-
over is demagnified by an order of magnitude or more.
In the case of a FEG, the source size may be less than
the desired illumination area on the specimen so it may
be necessary to magnify the crossover (so the condenser
lenses don&rsquo;t always condense!). The simplest way to
produce a parallel beam is shown in Figure 9.1A in
</p>
<p>(A) (B)
</p>
<p>FIGURE 9.1. Parallel-beam operation in the TEM: (A) the basic principle illustrated, using just the C1 and an underfocused C2 lens. (B) The practical
</p>
<p>situation in most TEMs; using the C1 and C2 lenses to image the source at the FFP of the condenser-objective lens, thus creating a parallel beam at the
</p>
<p>specimen plane. Therefore, the upper objective is sometimes termed the C3 lens.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>which the C2 lens is weakened to produce an under-
focused image of the C1 crossover (although no TEM
today has only two condenser lenses). Remember from
Section 6.2.D andFigure 6.5 that any lens operates either
in focus or out of focus and there are times when each
mode is useful. In its out-of-focus condition, a lens is said
to be overfocused if it is strong and the crossover occurs
before the image plane and underfocused if the lens is
weak and the crossover occurs after the image plane.
Remember also that underfocus gives a more parallel
beam at the specimen than overfocus.
</p>
<p>While the beam in Figure 9.1A is not exactly parallel
to the optic axis, a under these conditions is&lt; 10�4 rads
(0.00578), which is effectively a parallel beam.
</p>
<p>When generating the small probes we need in
STEM and AEM, the upper polepiece of the objective
lens acts as the C3 lens (see the next two sections) and
controls the beam hitting the specimen as shown in
Figure 9.1B. If the C2 lens is focused to produce an
image (of the crossover) at the front-focal plane (FFP)
of the upper-objective polepiece then a parallel beam
of electrons is formed by the lens. The so-called con-
denser-objective (c/o) lens system is standard on
almost all TEMs used for materials characterization
but there is no c/o lens in dedicated STEMS, TEMs
made before �1980 and those designed primarily for
imaging of biological specimens. The c/o lens system
complicates the electron optics, as we shall see in Sec-
tion 9.1.C below.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see that parallel illumination is essential to get the
sharpest selected-area DPs (SADPs) (Chapter 18) and,
in principle, the best classical image contrast (Part 3). In
fact, we usually assume that the incident beam is parallel
when interpreting our classical images. Usually you
should underfocus C2 until the illuminated area on
your specimen fills the viewing screen. The higher the
magnification the more you have to strengthen C2 (mak-
ing the beam less parallel) in order to keep the illuminated
area just filling the screen and thus illuminating less of the
specimen.
</p>
<p>In parallel-illumination TEM mode, such as you
would use for diffraction-contrast imaging and SADP
formation, there is usually no need to change C1,
which is therefore kept at some intermediate setting,
recommended by the manufacturer. The only other
variable is the C2 aperture. A small aperture reduces
the electron current reaching your specimen. How-
ever, if you use a smaller aperture, you decrease the
angle of beam convergence and therefore make the
beam more parallel, as is evident from Figure 9.2.
</p>
<p>9.1.B Convergent-Beam (S)TEM Mode
</p>
<p>Now, there are times when you may wish to focus the
beam more, so that the intensity of the beam on a
specific area of the specimen is increased. Let&rsquo;s look at
various ways to do this.
</p>
<p>If you want tominimize the area of the specimen that
you are illuminating, you simply change the C2 lens so it
is focused rather than defocused and you form an

mination isn&rsquo;t really parallel, it&rsquo;s just not very

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>image of the C1 crossover at the specimen, as shown in
Figure 9.3A. This is the condition under which you can
view the source image to adjust its saturation (go back
and look at Figure 5.5B and C) or to measure the
dimensions of the beam (see Section 5.5.D). When C2
is focused like this, the beam is at its least parallel and
most convergent. While the intensity of illumination on
the viewing screen will be greatest, your image contrast
will be reduced and any SADP will be distorted. Ideally,
for routine TEMwork, your specimen should always be
thin enough so that you never have to operate with C2
focused but, in practice, you&rsquo;ll often find yourself focus-
ing C2 to compensate somewhat for poor transmission
through a thick portion of your specimen.
</p>
<p>However, there are times when we do need to create
a focused, convergent beam at the specimen. We then
use the other principal way to operate the illumination
system: the convergent-beam (or probe/spot) mode.
When you use this mode you won&rsquo;t immediately see a
useful image; the convergence destroys the parallelism
and reduces the image contrast. So to see an image we
have to scan the beam; this mode of operation of the
illumination system is standard for STEM and AEM.
</p>
<p>Now, if you have a FEG it&rsquo;s possible to use the C1
and C2 lenses to produce Å-level probes but, with a
thermionic source, it isn&rsquo;t possible to use just those
two lenses (as in Figure 9.3A) to demagnify the relatively
large thermionic-gun crossover to less than several
nanometers. So to get the desired probe sizes of &lt;&lt; 1 nm
for analysis, etc., the usual solution, as we just noted, is
to introduce a C3 or c/o lens. We can only do this if the
objective lens is split into two polepieces with separate
coils and then we can make the upper polepiece of the
objective lens much stronger than usual and weaken C2
or even turn it off, as shown in Figure 9.3B. In addition,
C1 must be strongly excited so the image of the gun
crossover is a long way from C3. Thus the C3 image
distance (di) is much less than the object distance (do),
which gives a large demagnification of the C1 crossover
(see equation 6.2).
</p>
<p>PROBE
The convergent beam is a probe. We use a probe to
localize the signals coming from the specimen, as in
XEDS, EELS, CBED, or HAADF.

</p>
<p>and large convergence angles. Note that C2 is shown here as having no effect on the ray paths (i.e., it is effectively switched off). The large do/di ratio gives
</p>
<p>the maximum demagnification of the image of the gun crossover.
</p>
<p>144 ..........................................................................................................................................................................................THE INSTRUMENT</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>From Figure 9.3B you can see that, although C2 is
switched off, the C2 aperture still controls the conver-
gence angle (a) of the beam on the specimen. As was the
case for parallel-beammode, a smaller C2 aperture gives
a smaller a. You&rsquo;ll see later in Chapter 20 that the
correct choice of C2 aperture is important in CBED
and also in defining the exact dimensions of the probe
for XEDS or EELS analysis (see Part 4). Some TEMs
such as the FEI and older JEOLs use a double-gap C1
lens (check the situation for your own TEM in the
manufacturer&rsquo;s handbook). In these TEMs there is a
single C1 lens winding but effectively four polepieces
and hence two crossovers occur in the bore of the lens.
In some other TEMs (e.g., the Akashi 002B, the JEOL
2010, and Hitachi 8100 and later instruments) there
are actually three independent lenses. Without this
additional crossover, it&rsquo;s not possible to get a probe
&lt; �10 nm. An additional condenser lens will yield a
probe size about 10� smaller. Even though you only
get to use two controls (C1 and C2) there are at least
three crossovers. So, as you can see, condenser-lens
configurations can get much more complicated than
the basic principle shown in Figure 9.3B. The more
lenses you have, the more flexible the optics and there-
fore the more operations that a single TEM can
perform.
</p>
<p>So, in probe-forming TEMs, the role of C1 is funda-
mentally different from its role in traditional, parallel-
beamTEM. The C1 lens is used to control the probe size
(and thus the current) at the specimen. As shown in
Figure 9.4, a strong C1 gives you a small probe while a
weak C1 creates a large probe. This difference occurs
because increasing the strength of C1 shortens its di,
thus lengthening do for the probe-forming C2 (or C3)
lens and, therefore, increasing the demagnification (but
remember that this is a very simplified diagram).
</p>
<p>9.1.C The Condenser-Objective Lens
</p>
<p>When convergent-beam TEMs were first constructed, it
was not possible to design an objective lens that would
give both a parallel or a convergent beam at the speci-
men. So you had to change polepieces in order to change
operating modes, which was highly inconvenient. To
solve this problem, the condenser/objective (c/o) lens
was developed in the mid-1970s. In a c/o lens, the mag-
netic field between the polepieces of the objective lens is
very strong (� 2 Tesla). This strong field has a dual
function. First, it acts as a condenser lens and effectively
causes the beam to converge on the specimen. Thus, as
we mentioned above, we can refer to the condenser part
of the lens as the C3. Second, once the beam has pene-
trated the specimen, it is focused just as it would be in a
conventional lens. The beam is almost never parallel in a
c/o lens and so, as shown in Figure 9.5, yet another lens
is introduced into the column between the C2 lens and
</p>
<p>the objective lens. This extra lens is a condenser mini-
lens (called a twin-lens in Philips/FEI instruments) and
it is standard on TEMs that also operate as STEMs or
analytical TEMs (i.e., it&rsquo;s standard on all modern TEMs
used in materials characterization). Without the con-
denser mini-lens, the action of the c/o is always similar
to the objective lens in a dedicated STEM because, in
such instruments, parallel-beam imaging conditions are
never required. All imaging and analyses are accom-
plished with a convergent probe. However, in TEM
where both parallel and convergent beams are needed,
when the mini-lens is activated, the convergent effect of
the c/o lens can be offset by forming a crossover at the
FFP of the objective. Here the FFP is actually acting as
the condenser part of the c/o lens. Thus, unlike in con-
ventional objective lenses (see Figure 6.5), the parallel-
beam condition is met in the overfocus condition in the
c/o lens. If you&rsquo;re feeling confused, take another look at
Figure 9.5.
</p>
<p>THE c/o LENS
In older TEMs without a c/o lens, underfocus gives a
more parallel beam at the plane of the specimen than
overfocus. This is not the case if the objective lens is a
c/o lens and the beam is more parallel at the specimen
when the c/o lens is overfocused.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 9.4. Effect of the C1 lens strength on probe size: a stronger
</p>
<p>C1 lens (A) results in greater demagnification by any subsequent lens
</p>
<p>(C2 and/or C3), giving a smaller electron beam at the specimen. A

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Figure 9.5 shows the various ray paths through a c/o
lens, with a mini/twin lens, as the strength of the C2 lens
is changed. As you can see, the beam at the specimen
varies from parallel through convergent, divergent, and
then back to parallel, as C2 is strengthened. Therefore,
because of this interaction between C2 and the c/o
lens, changing C2 changes the focus of the probe at
the specimen and thus changes the focus of the STEM
image and the CBED pattern and also changes the
spatial resolution of any XEDS or EELS analyses, as
we&rsquo;ll describe in detail in Part 4. So you have to be
aware that, when you are operating in probe mode,
two lenses control the focus, which can really mess
things up unless you are fully aware of the situation. If
you are operating in conventional parallel-beam TEM
mode then you can simply use the objective lens (lower
polepiece) to focus the image (see Section 9.3) and you
don&rsquo;t need to adjust the illumination-system optics.
</p>
<p>All recent probe-forming TEMs operate at a very
specific c/o lens excitation where the STEM probe can
be imaged in TEM mode on the viewing screen/
</p>
<p>computer display. This c/o condition for simultaneous
focus and image is a very limited one. (Look in the
manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions to find out how to set this
condition exactly on your own TEM.) If you don&rsquo;t do
this, you&rsquo;re not at the correct objective-lens excitation
and the beam can act in contrary ways; the beam con-
vergence can decrease when you expect it to increase and
the electron distribution in the probe can be spread into
a broad halo rather than a fine focused point. So find
out how to do this whenever you&rsquo;re operating in probe-
forming mode.
</p>
<p>In a c/o lens, while the convergence angle can be
effectively reduced to zero, the helical path of the
electrons through the strongly excited upper-objective
polepiece never permits truly parallel illumination. In
contrast, in the older conventional C1/C2 optics, the
objective pre-field is not strong and the spiraling is
greatly reduced. Therefore, image contrast and other
effects arise as a result of c/o lens operation. If you
read Christenson, and Eades all of this is very well
explained.

<p>9.1.D Translating and Tilting the Beam
</p>
<p>There are certain operations where we need to translate
the beam laterally on the specimen (e.g., to position a
fine probe on a feature of interest for analysis). Simi-
larly, there are times when we need to tilt the beam off
the optic axis so it impinges on the specimen at a specific
angle (e.g., for centered-DF imaging using a specific
diffraction spot which we describe in Section 9.3.C or
for hollow-cone imaging/diffraction (Section 9.3.D) and
precession diffraction (Section 18.8)). Both translating
and tilting are also essential for aligning the beam down
the column and are accomplished by varying the current
through potentiometers (which we call &lsquo;scan coils&rsquo;) to
generate a local magnetic field which deflects (rather
than focuses) the beam. There are several sets of scan
coils in the column, some of which tilt and others which
translate the beam. Ray diagrams to explain translating
and tilting the beam are shown in Figure 9.6A and B.
</p>
<p>When we create a scanning beam for STEM imag-
ing, the beam must always move parallel to the optic
axis to mimic the parallel-beam illumination conditions
of standard TEM. Such scanning is accomplished by
tilting the beam twice with two sets of scan coils (one
above the other) to ensure that the beam crosses the
optic axis at the FFP of the upper-objective-lens
polepiece. Then, wherever the beam enters the upper-
objective-lens field, it is tilted to follow a path parallel to
the optic axis (so sometimes you have to tilt in order to
translate!). You need computer control to do this rather
complex adjustment (look ahead to Figure 9.17). Like
</p>
<p>many other procedures on a modern TEM, this adjust-
ment is made automatically when you select a particular
(in this case STEM) operating mode.
</p>
<p>9.1.E Alignment of the C2 Aperture
</p>
<p>Instructions for alignment vary for different TEMs so
we&rsquo;ll simply describe the principles. Even if you won&rsquo;t be
doing the alignment you will want to check that the
microscope is correctly aligned; you can recognize if
the wheels are not aligned on your car and you know it
is important to balance them for best performance of the
vehicle, even if you have to ask someone else to perform
the task. If youwant the best out of yourmachine, you&rsquo;ll
want to be able to fine-tune this alignment.
</p>
<p>If your illumination system is correctly aligned, the
gun crossover is on the optic axis and the electrons can
then travel down the optic axis in a straight line through
the lenses and apertures until they hit the specimen.We&rsquo;ll
assume that your gun is aligned so that the source cross-
over is on the optic axis of the column, as we described
back in Chapter 5. Alignment of the illumination system
used to be a tedious, manual affair involving tilting and
translating each of the condenser lenses and centering the
apertures on axis. Now most of the lens components are
machined accurately enough so that onlyminor electron-
ic tilts and translations are needed and usually these are
computer controlled. Under these circumstances, center-
ing the C2 aperture remains the most critical step in
obtaining the best performance out of your TEM, partic-
ularly if you intend to operate in scanning mode for
STEM imaging and analysis. (Other apertures in the
illumination system are usually left untouched.) The C2
alignment remains a manual operation on most TEMs,
although undoubtedly this will not always be the case.
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #1 You must always have the
C2 aperture accurately centered on the optic axis of the
TEM. If the aperture ismisaligned, the image of the beam
on the screen moves off axis and distorts as you under-
focus or overfocus C2, as shown in Figure 9.7. To adjust
the diaphragm so the aperture is on axis we have to
alternately focus and defocus theC2 lens (we&rsquo;ll arbitrarily
start by overfocusing but it actually doesn&rsquo;t matter if you
under- or overfocus first). It&rsquo;s best to start at a low mag-
nification so you can find the aperture image then repeat
at the magnification range where you wish to operate.
</p>
<p>&amp; First, overfocus C2 (strengthen the lens) so the beam
is spread on the screen and the image of the C2
aperture is visible (make sure any other apertures
in the imaging system are out of the column).
</p>
<p>&amp; Then use the external manual drives (or computer
control if you are lucky enough) to move the dia-
phragm so the aperture image is centered on the screen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Next, weaken C2 so the image of the beam is focused
to its minimum diameter.

<p>the beam illuminates the same area of the specimen, but from a different
</p>
<p>angle of incidence.
</p>
<p>9 .1 THE ILLUMINAT ION SYSTEM ............................................................................................................................................................. 147</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Then, center the beam with the condenser deflector
controls.
</p>
<p>&amp; Now underfocus the C2 lens (i.e., continue to weaken
it) until you canagain see the aperture image and center
the image again with the external drives.
</p>
<p>&amp; Now strengthen the lens until the spot is focused and
center it with the deflector coils.
</p>
<p>&amp; You have to repeat this whole operation iteratively
until the image of the beam expands and con-
tracts around the center of the screen as shown in
Figure 9.8.
</p>
<p>In TEM mode this operation should only be neces-
sary on the rare occasions when you change the dia-
phragm or the C1-lens setting but, in STEM, any change
of probe size requires re-alignment of the C2 aperture.
</p>
<p>9.1.F Condenser-Lens Defects
</p>
<p>The illumination-system lenses suffer from all the stan-
dard lens defects we described in Chapter 6, such as
</p>
<p>aberrations and astigmatism. These defects don&rsquo;t really
limit the operation of the TEM in parallel-beam mode,
but they are crucial if you&rsquo;re intent on forming the finest
probe possible for STEM and analytical work. Let&rsquo;s
look at the role of each of the major defects.
</p>
<p>Spherical Aberration This defect plays no role in
limiting parallel-beam formation. However, as we dis-
cussed in Chapter 5, in adjusting the illumination system
to form the finest possible probe with the maximum
available current, spherical aberration in the probe-
forming lens (C3) controls the minimum possible
probe size. In exactly the same manner as we control
the image resolution (see Chapter 6), spherical aberra-
tion limits the probe dimensions to a minimum radius
(equation 6.22) of rmin� 0.91(Csl
</p>
<p>3)1/4. So the C3 probe-
forming lens has a short focal length to minimize Cs.
The final probe-limiting aperture in C2 needs to be
carefully chosen to be the optimum value (equation
6.23) for the selected probe size aopt = 0.77 l
</p>
<p>1/4/Cs
1/4.
</p>
<p>In practice, however, there are always more C1 settings
than available C2 apertures, so it is not possible to
choose the optimum aperture for each probe. This can
cause problems if you need a specific probe size for a
certain spatial resolution, as we discuss in Chapter 36. Of
course, if you are lucky enough to be using a STEMwith
a Cs-corrected probe then this problem is minimized.
</p>
<p>Chromatic Aberration Remember this aberration
depends on the energy spread of the electrons. Since

</p>
<p>WOBBLING
Usually there&rsquo;s a control that will introduce an AC
current into the lens coil, in effect &lsquo;wobbling&rsquo; the lens
setting either side of focus. This &lsquo;wobbler&rsquo; saves you
from manually underfocusing and overfocusing the
lens, but think what you are doing.

<p>have a very small energy spread we generally regard
them as monochromatic and there is no detectable
degradation of the probe dimensions. However, for the
very best image resolution or the very best EELS,
Cc-correction via monochromation of the beam can
help, as we&rsquo;ll describe later in Section 37.7.
</p>
<p>Astigmatism This is the most common defect in the
TEM illumination system and arises either because the
final limiting aperture in C2 is misaligned or it is con-
taminated and charging up, thus deflecting the beam.
We&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;ve centered the C2 aperture as we just
described and we&rsquo;ll now tell you how to detect and
correct any residual astigmatism due to contaminated
apertures. The condenser stigmators introduce a com-
pensating field (like a scan coil) which corrects this
distortion.
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #2A&mdash;Detecting Astigmatism
You can discern astigmatism in the illumination system
by looking at an image of the electron source on the
display/screen as follows
</p>
<p>&amp; Operate in image mode with no specimen inserted
(or look through a hole in your specimen).
</p>
<p>&amp; Focus C2 so the beam is a minimum diameter (i.e., in
spot mode with the size governed by C1).
</p>
<p>&amp; Adjust the C2 aperture and the beam traverses so the
spot is in the middle of the screen and the image of the
beam is circular, as you didwhen aligning the aperture.
</p>
<p>&amp; Wobble the C2 lens either side of the focal setting so
the image of the beam expands and contracts about
its minimum dimension.
</p>
<p>&amp; If there is astigmatism, the image is not circular, but
distorts elliptically and rotates through 908 either
side of focus, as shown in Figure 9.9.
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #2B&mdash;Correcting Astigmatism
&amp; First overfocus the beam so you can see the effect of
the astigmatism (i.e., the beam appears elliptical) in
one direction.
</p>
<p>&amp; Then adjust the stigmators so the image appears
circular.
</p>
<p>&amp; Now underfocus the beam and repeat the correction.
&amp; Repeat the whole over/underfocus procedure itera-
tively until the image of the beam remains circular as
you expand and contract it on the screen with the C2
lens (see Figure 9.8). Again, a wobbler can help here
once you get the hang of the interplay between defo-
cusing and the stigmators.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you can&rsquo;t make the image circular, you&rsquo;ll have to
increase the range of strength of the stigmators. If
you are on maximum strength, then there is too
much contamination on the aperture and you either
need to replace or flame-clean the diaphragm, as we
described in Chapter 6.
</p>
<p>9.1.G Calibration
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already described in Section 5.5 what it takes to
measure the performance of the electron gun and to
optimize the brightness in STEM operation so that the
maximum beam current goes into the minimum probe
size. We also have to calibrate the illumination system.
The major variables are the probe size (and current) for
various C1 settings and the convergence angle for var-
ious C2 aperture sizes.
</p>
<p>The C1 lens strength controls the probe size at the
plane of the specimen. We&rsquo;ve described in some detail
how to measure the beam dimensions at the specimen
back in Section 5.5.C. in Chapter 5. Figure 9.10A shows
the variation of the calculated (not measured) probe size
as a function of the C1 lens setting for a typical TEM.
These calculations are approximate, since they define the
probe width as the FWHM and assume the C2 aperture
correctly limits the Gaussian distribution. Despite these
approximations you can clearly see the expected trend of
decreasing probe size with increasing C1 strength. The
probe current is a strong function of the probe size. If
you look in the text byGoldstein et al. you&rsquo;ll find that the
maximum probe current is proportional to (almost) the
cube of the probe diameter: if you increase the probe size
by a factor of 10, the current will increase by almost
1000�. This is an extraordinary dependence and explains
why, particularly for probe-related TEM work (XEDS,
EELS, STEM imaging, and CBED), we are very

<p>concerned about knowing and measuring the probe size
and current. (There&rsquo;s much more about this in Part 4.)
Figure 9.10B shows the variation of probe current with
probe size for a FEG AEM.
</p>
<p>The C2 aperture size governs the convergence (semi)
angle a, as we also discussed in Chapter 5 when we were
determining the gun brightness.
</p>
<p>&amp; We measure the total convergence angle 2a from a
CBED pattern (Figure 5.8).
</p>
<p>&amp; We increase a by increasing the C2 aperture size
(Figure 9.11).
</p>
<p>Obviously the probe current will also be affected
by the aperture size (e.g., if you double the aperture
diameter you would expect four times the number of
electrons to come through it). But, as you learned
back in Chapter 6 (equations 6.22 and 6.23), because
of the increasing lens aberrations with increasing a,
there is an optimum aperture that gives the maxi-
mum probe current (and hence the best image reso-
lution) that we just mentioned. You might well
expect that, if there is a Cs corrector in the TEM
illumination system, this limit can be overcome and
you would be correct.
</p>
<p>On some instruments the C2 aperture is virtual (so
you have an effective aperture size), which makes it
rather difficult to measure 2a. (See the Goldstein et al.
text for a detailed description of this problem, which is
common in SEMs.) Furthermore, if the C2 lens is
excited, it can also change a and then you have to
calibrate a both as a function of the aperture size and
the C2 lens setting, which is an extremely tedious
exercise.
</p>
<p>9.2 THE OBJECTIVE LENS AND STAGE
</p>
<p>This combination is the heart of the TEM. We use
the stage to clamp the specimen holder in the correct
position so the objective lens can form images and
DPs in a reproducible manner. As we discussed in
Chapter 8, there are two different types of holder,
top-entry and side-entry and these determine the
geometry of the polepiece and the flexibility which
you have to make adjustments. We&rsquo;ll only consider
side-entry holders here since they are standard but top-
entry holders require the same adjustment of the z-
control or specimen height.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As a practical consideration, you&rsquo;ll find that you
would like to be able to tilt the specimen without
changing its height on the optic axis. Otherwise you
will be continuously using the z-control whenever
you tilt. Clearly this means that you should ensure
that the region of the specimen you want to work on
is located close to the tilt axis of the specimen rod.
</p>
<p>The central requirement here is the need to define a
reference plane so that our calibrations will be reproduc-
ible. The reference plane (see Chapter 6) for a side-
entry holder is called the eucentric plane. This plane is
normal to the optic axis and contains the axis of the
specimen-holder rod; clearly there could be many such
planes. What is special about the eucentric plane is that
when your specimen is located at this plane and the
image is in focus, the objective-lens current is a standard
reference value. The position of this plane within the
objective lens is known as the eucentric height. If you
put your specimen in the eucentric plane, then a point on
the optic axis does not move laterally when you tilt it
around the holder axis, which makes many essential
imaging and diffraction operations very easy. Unfortu-
nately, if you tilt your specimen normal to the holder
axis, or rotate/traverse it off axis, then the area you&rsquo;re
examining almost invariably moves out of the eucentric
plane upon tilting and the image can easily disappear
from the screen. This limitation can only be overcome
by complete computer control of all five axes (three
translations (x, y, z) and two tilts (parallel and orthogo-
nal to the axis of the holder)) and such stages are often
called double-eucentric. They are becoming more com-
monly available and are extremely useful. Get one if
you can!
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #3A The first thing you must
always dowhen inserting your specimen into the TEM is
to ensure that it is in the eucentric plane. To do this, first
find the z-control, which is usually a knob on the outside
of the goniometer stage near the hole where you insert
the holder. Then
</p>
<p>&amp; Select a recognizable feature in the image and position
it at the center of the screen at a reasonable magnifi-
cation (20&ndash;50,000�).
</p>
<p>&amp; Tilt the goniometer stage a few degrees clockwise
or anticlockwise until the feature moves close the
limit of the viewing screen. (If the slightest tilt
has this effect then go to a lower magnification
until you can tilt a few degrees and still see the
feature on the screen.)
</p>
<p>&amp; Adjust the height of the specimen holder until the
feature returns to the center of the screen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Tilt the goniometer the other way and repeat the
process.
</p>
<p>&amp; Continue to increase the tilt both ways and com-
pensate with the z-control until the image of the
specimen remains stationary when you tilt the
specimen through about �308 either side of zero
tilt.
</p>
<p>&amp; Repeat at a higher magnification as needed.
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #3B: Another Way to Set the
Eucentricity The eucentric position of the stage is a
mechanical point located in the column. As we men-
tioned earlier, the optimal c/o lens setting in a STEM/
TEM is a very well-defined and reproducible excitation
of the objective lens. This lens condition also defines a
mechanical point somewhere between the polepieces.
We need to make the two points (eucentric position
and the optimal c/o lens excitation position) the same.
To find the eucentric point when these conditions are
met, you need to
</p>
<p>&amp; Set the lens condition to the optimal c/o operating
condition.
</p>
<p>&amp; Focus the image using the z-control.
&amp; The specimen height will now be set to the eucentric
position.
</p>
<p>With practice you can set these two points to differ
by &lt;10 mm, and &lt; 3 mm is not uncommon.
</p>
<p>With computer control and auto-focusing techniques
becoming common, this operation can be automated. As
a result, in a completely eucentric stage, your specimen
doesn&rsquo;t move off the optic axis and remains in focus no
matter around what axis it is tilted or rotated. If you
don&rsquo;t have such a computer-controlled stage, be cautious
and develop the skill to tilt and change the z-control
simultaneously.
</p>
<p>The eucentric plane should also be symmetrically
positioned with respect to the upper and lower objective
polepiece fields. At this condition, the eucentric plane
coincides with the plane at which the electron beam is
imaged, in both TEM and STEM modes. If the sym-
metric plane and the eucentric plane are not coincident,
then the images and DPs will appear at different magni-
fications and different focus settings in TEM and
STEM. Obviously this requirement has no meaning in
a DSTEM where there is no TEM mode.
</p>
<p>FOCUSING AND HEIGHT
We cannot emphasize too strongly that we need to fix
the height of our specimen on the optic axis so we can
always work at the same objective-lens current and
thus at a fixed objective-lens magnification.
</p>
<p>This is really important! This is usually ignored!
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ensuring coincidence of the eucentric and symmetric
planes is usually carried out by the manufacturer. You
can check it by comparing the focus of a DP or an image
in TEM and STEM modes. You should not have to
refocus the image or DP with the objective lens when
you change from one mode to the other. If you find this
is a problem, talk to your technical staff.
</p>
<p>9.3 FORMING DPs AND IMAGES: THE TEM
IMAGING SYSTEM
</p>
<p>You know already that the objective lens takes the elec-
trons emerging from the exit surface of the specimen,
disperses them to create a DP in the back-focal plane
(BFP), and recombines them to form an image in the
image plane (see Figure 6.3). We can use this ray diagram
to introduce the basic operations for forming static-beam
images and DPs in the TEM. We&rsquo;ll then describe how to
do the same thing with a scanning beam in STEMmode.
</p>
<p>In this discussion, we will skip many of the
details and concentrate on the role of the instrument.
In Chapter 11 we&rsquo;ll discuss the details of the diffraction
process and then expand these ideas in Chapters 16
through 21. We&rsquo;ll then discuss the images formed in
the TEM in Chapters 22 through 31.
</p>
<p>The first operation that you need tomaster when using
the TEM is viewing the DP (diffraction mode). In all the
subsequent imaging modes, we&rsquo;ll form our images by
using the objective aperture and the DP to select electrons
that have been scattered through particular angles.
</p>
<p>&amp; Diffraction mode: to see the DP you have to
adjust the imaging-system lenses so that the
BFP of the objective lens acts as the object
plane for the intermediate lens. Then the DP is
projected onto the viewing screen/CCD as shown
in Figure 9.12A.
</p>
<p>&amp; Image mode: if you want to look at an image instead,
you readjust the intermediate lens so that its object
plane is the image plane of the objective lens. Then an
image is projected onto the viewing screen/CCD, as
shown in Figure 9.12B.
Let&rsquo;s look now at the details of these two fundamen-
</p>
<p>tal operations from the point of view of the instrument.
</p>
<p>In subsequent chapters, we will discuss how to under-
stand the images/DPs and why we form them in the
ways we do.
</p>
<p>9.3.A Selected-Area Diffraction
</p>
<p>As you can see from Figure 9.12A, the DP contains
electrons from the whole area of the specimen that we
illuminate with the beam. Such a pattern is not very
useful because the specimen will often be buckled.
Furthermore, the direct beam is often so intense that it
will damage the viewing screen or saturate the CCD
camera. So we perform a basic TEM operation which
both selects a specific area of the specimen to contribute
to the DP and reduces the intensity of the direct beam in
the DP on the screen.
</p>
<p>If you look at Figure 9.12A, there are two ways we
could reduce the illuminated area of the specimen con-
tributing to the DP.
</p>
<p>&amp; We could make the beam smaller
&amp; We could insert an aperture above the specimen
which would only permit electrons that pass through
it to hit the specimen
</p>
<p>The first option involves using C2 and/or C3 to con-
verge the beam at the specimen. We use this approach to
form CBED patterns, which we&rsquo;ll discuss in great detail
inChapters 20 and 21. Converging the beamdestroys any
parallelism, and spots in the pattern are not sharply
defined but spread into disks. If we wish to obtain a DP
with a parallel beam of electrons, the standard way is to
use the selected-area aperture. Now, we can&rsquo;t insert an
aperture at the specimen plane, because the specimen is
already there! But if we insert an aperture in a plane
conjugate with the specimen, i.e., in one of the image
planes of an imaging lens, then it creates a virtual aper-
ture at the plane of the specimen. This is exactly what we
do. This operation is called selected-area diffraction or
SAD, and is shown in Figure 9.12A.
</p>
<p>The conjugate plane that we choose is the image
plane of the objective lens. As shown in Figure 9.13,
we create SADPs by inserting what we call the SAD
aperture into the image plane of the objective lens and
we center this aperture on the optic axis in the middle of
the viewing screen. You can see this aperture if you want
to change it or center it, by projecting the image plane
onto the viewing screen/CCD, as we&rsquo;ll discuss in Section
9.3.B below.
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #4 The specific steps to form
an SADP are as follows (while it looks complicated
you&rsquo;ll soon find that it only takes a few seconds to do
all these steps)
</p>
<p>&amp; Choose image mode so you can see an image of your
thin specimen on the viewing screen.
</p>
<p>PUSH-BUTTON TEM
There are buttons to push on the console or icons
to click on the computer screen by which you
choose either image mode or diffraction mode.
These are the primary modes, central to TEM
operation. Now TEM is so easy it has never
been more difficult!

<p>image mode: projecting the image onto the screen. In each case the intermediate lens selects either the BFP (A) or the image plane (B) of the objective

</p>

</p>
<p>9 .3 FORMING DP S AND IMAGES : THE TEM IMAGING SYSTEM ..................................................................................................... 153</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Spread the beam by underfocusing C2.
&amp; Make sure that the objective diaphragm is retracted.
The image contrast will be poor and it will be diffi-
cult to focus but that&rsquo;s all right at this stage.
</p>
<p>&amp; Insert the SAD diaphragm and start by choosing
the largest available aperture to make finding the
aperture easy (there may be three to five different
apertures depending on the specific TEM you are
using).
</p>
<p>&amp; If the screen then goes blank and you can&rsquo;t see any-
thing, the aperture you chose is not on axis and you
should lower the imagemagnification until you can see
the aperture and center it on the axis.
</p>
<p>&amp; If the illuminated area of the image isn&rsquo;t restricted
when you insert the aperture then you are at too high
a magnification; so lower it until you can see the
image of this aperture on the viewing screen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Traverse the specimen if necessary to make sure the
specific region you are interested in is visible through
the aperture.
</p>
<p>&amp; You must focus the SAD aperture by adjusting the
intermediate lens so it is conjugate with (i.e., exactly
in the plane of) the image of the specimen that we
focused with the objective lens.
</p>
<p>&amp; Switch to diffractionmode and an SADPwill appear
on the screen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Focus the SADP with the diffraction-focus controls
so the spots are sharp. Further underfocusing C2
may also help at this stage.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you need a smaller aperture to select a smaller
region of the specimen, simply click the diaphragm
holder in or out to choose a smaller aperture and
repeat the above procedure.
</p>
<p>Under these conditions,with anSADaperture inserted
and the objective apertures removed, any electron that hits
the specimen outside the area defined by the virtual aper-
ture will hit the diaphragm when it travels onto the image
plane. Such electronswill thus be excluded fromcontribut-
ing to the DP that is projected onto the viewing screen.
In practice, we can&rsquo;tmake apertures smaller than�10 mm,
and the demagnification back to the plane of the specimen
is only �25� which gives a minimum selected area
of�0.4 mm&mdash;which isn&rsquo;t as small as we&rsquo;d like, particularly
in today&rsquo;s nano-world. We&rsquo;ll discuss in Chapter 11
whether or not smaller values would be useful. As always,
you really need to know these values for the TEM you are
using, so do the calibration.
</p>
<p>The SADP is often displayed on the viewing screen
at a fixed magnification so that you can recognize dif-
ferences in the magnitude of g.
</p>
<p>By analogy with an X-ray diffractometer or pinhole
camera,we define a distance called the &lsquo;camera length&rsquo; (L).
We think of this length as being the distance of the record-
ing plane from the DP (look ahead to Figure 9.23); it&rsquo;s
analogous to a real distance in a real camera. We choose
the value of L such that inter-spot or ring spacings in the
DP are easily discernible on the viewing screen and on the
recording medium. This magnification can be changed by
adjusting the intermediate lenses. We&rsquo;ll describe how we
calibrate this magnification in Section 9.6.B.
</p>
<p>At this stage, however, it&rsquo;s worth noting that, with a
c/o lens, calibration of L can be a challenge because
changing the condenser-lens focus as we just described
changes the diffraction crossover and, if you re-focus
the SADP with the intermediate lens, then you&rsquo;ll mea-
sure a different L.
</p>
<p>Beware: in all the early TEM books, SAD is the only
standard diffraction technique. As a result, some micro-
scopists only use SAD to obtain diffraction information.
However, CBED, which we discuss in Chapters 20 and
21, provides a great deal of complementary diffraction
information and must be used by all TEM operators in
thematerials and nanotechnology fields. But there are still
certain times when your best option is to form an SADP
</p>
<p>&amp; When you need to select a spot from which to form a
BF or DF image (see next section)
</p>
<p>&amp; When diffraction spots are very close to one another
and would overlap in CBED patterns (see examples
in Chapters 23 and 24)
</p>
<p>FIGURE 9.13. Ray diagram showing SADP formation: the insertion of
</p>
<p>an aperture in the image plane results in the creation of a virtual aperture
</p>
<p>in the plane of the specimen (shown here slightly above the specimen
</p>
<p>plane). Only electrons falling inside the dimensions of the virtual aperture
</p>
<p>at the entrance surface of the specimen will be allowed through into the
</p>
<p>imaging system to contribute to the SAD pattern. All other electrons
</p>
<p>(dotted lines) will hit the SAD diaphragm.
</p>
<p>SAD
It is a basic principle of TEM operation that when
you want to look at the DP (i.e., the BFP of the
objective lens), you put an SAD aperture into the
image plane of the objective lens.
</p>
<p>154 ..........................................................................................................................................................................................THE INSTRUMENT</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; When you are looking for fine structure in the DP
such as streaks (see Chapter 17)
</p>
<p>&amp; When your specimen is beam sensitive
</p>
<p>On all other occasions, when the diffraction maxima
provide the most important information in the pattern,
you should use CBED.
</p>
<p>9.3.B Bright-Field and Dark-Field Imaging
</p>
<p>When the SADP is projected onto the viewing screen/
CCD, we can use the pattern to perform the two most
basic imaging operations in the TEM. No matter what
kind of specimen you&rsquo;re looking at, the SADP will
contain a bright central spot that contains the direct-
beam electrons and some scattered electrons (as shown
in Figure 2.13A&ndash;C), the distribution ofwhich will depend
on the nature of your specimen.
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #5 When we form images in
the TEM, we either form an image using the central spot
or we use some or all of the scattered electrons. The way
we choose which electrons form the image is
</p>
<p>&amp; Starting with both SAD and objective diaphragm
holders retracted, select image mode to observe an
image of the desired region of your specimen on the
screen. It will not be a good image because there is no
objective aperture inserted, but that isOKat this stage.
</p>
<p>&amp; Form an SADP of a selected region as we described
in operational procedure #4.
</p>
<p>&amp; Insert the objective diaphragm so an aperture appears
in the BFP of the objective lens, thus blocking out
most of the DP, except that small area which is visible
through the aperture. As with the SAD operation
above, we use the external drives tomove the aperture.
</p>
<p>&amp; Adjust the external diaphragm drives so the aperture
selects the direct beam on the optic axis.
This centering procedure is absolutely critical to form-
ing the best image. If you have binoculars, view the
TEM screen at a much higher magnification to ensure
the best possible centering; otherwise do the equivalent
using the digital image.
</p>
<p>&amp; Return to image mode, remove the SAD aperture,
and focus the image with the objective lens. We call
the resultant image, formed by the direct-beam elec-
trons, a bright-field (BF) image (Figure 9.14A).
</p>
<p>&amp; If instead we choose scattered electrons (e.g., a spe-
cific diffracted beam (usually) or a portion of a
</p>
<p>diffraction ring), then we call the image a dark-field
(DF) image (Figure 9.14B).
</p>
<p>You can view the BF and DF images at any magnifi-
cation simply by adjusting the intermediate lenses of the
microscope and typical magnification ranges will
be �25,000� to 100,000� for a wide field of view, but
up to 106� for high-resolution images. Usually you&rsquo;ll
have to calibrate the actual magnification and also be
able to relate directions in the image at anymagnification
to directions in theDP at a fixed camera length. These are
the two basic calibrations required for any TEM.
</p>
<p>The insertion and removal of the SAD and objective
apertures can be confusing to the beginner and often the
wrong aperture is inserted or not removed when it should
be. You have to practice obtaining SADPs and BF/DF
images to get used towhat aperture should be inserted and
when. Both apertures are inserted below the objective lens.
The objective aperture goes into the BFP, so it is closer to
the lens (i.e., higher up the column) than the SAD aper-
ture, which is in the image plane. Remember that if you&rsquo;re
looking at a DP the (lower) SAD aperture should be
inserted and the (upper) objective aperture removed. If
you want to look at an image, the objective aperture
should be inserted and the SAD aperture removed.
</p>
<p>9.3.C Centered Dark-Field Operation
</p>
<p>If you look at Figure 9.14B, the electrons that are
selected by the aperture travel off the optic axis,
since we displace the aperture to select the scattered
electrons. The more off-axis the electrons are the
greater the aberrations and astigmatism they suffer.
Therefore, such a displaced-aperture DF (DADF)
image is difficult to focus on an older TEM. You&rsquo;ll
find that the image will move on the screen as you
adjust the objective-lens strength. While there may
be situations where you want to use such a DADF
image, almost invariably you have to get any
</p>
<p>IMAGING
It is another basic principle of TEM operation that if
you want to view an image (i.e., the image plane of the
objective lens), you insert an aperture called the
objective aperture into the BFP of the objective lens.
</p>
<p>BF AND DF
Select the direct beam to form a BF image.
Select only electrons that are not in the direct beam to
form a DF image.
</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE APERTURE
This is the most important aperture in the TEM.
When inserted, its size controls the collection angle
(b); hence, it determines the effect of the aberrations
of the most important lens in the instrument and thus
directly influences the resolution.
</p>
<p>9 .3 FORMING DP S AND IMAGES : THE TEM IMAGING SYSTEM ..................................................................................................... 155</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>scattered electrons back on the optic axis and then
form a DF image under this condition. This opera-
tion is called centered dark-field (CDF) imaging. It
is the conventional way to do DF imaging so we&rsquo;ll
tell you how it&rsquo;s done. If you have a new TEM (with
a small Cs) you should consider using only DADF
for SAD because it&rsquo;s easier and you&rsquo;ve eliminated
the reason for forming CDF images!
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #6
&amp; Start with an SADP on the screen and instead of
moving the objective diaphragm so the aperture
selects scattered electrons, adjust the aperture so it
is on axis, as for BF imaging.
</p>
<p>&amp; Retract the objective diaphragm drive so you can see
the SADP.
</p>
<p>&amp; Switch on and adjust the beam-tilt (DF) potenti-
ometers above the objective lens so that the
scattered-electron beam that you wish to use to
form the CDF image moves toward the central, on-
axis position.
</p>
<p>&amp; Looking through the binoculars, switch the potenti-
ometers on and off to ensure that the scattered beam
exactly superimposes where the direct beam was
when the potentiometers are on and the direct beam
is back on axis when the potentiometers are off.
</p>
<p>&amp; Re-introduce the objective diaphragm and check
that the aperture is still centered around the on-axis
scattered beam.
As with BF imaging, this aperture-centering proce-
dure is absolutely critical to forming the best CDF
image.
</p>
<p>&amp; Select image mode again and focus the CDF image.
</p>
<p>What you are doing here is making the incident
beam hit the specimen at an angle equal and opposite
to the scattering angle. In this way the scattered elec-
trons will now travel down the optic axis, as shown in
Figure 9.14C.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to BF, CDF, DADF, and SAD opera-
tions when we discuss specific contrast mechanisms
that occur in TEM images in Chapter 22.

<p>9.3.D Hollow-Cone Diffraction and Dark-Field
Imaging
</p>
<p>One obvious limitation to either DADF or centered
CDF imaging is that we are only using a small fraction
of the scattered electrons. When that fraction is a spe-
cific diffraction spot from a crystalline specimen that
can indeed be very useful, as we&rsquo;ll see in Part 3 of the
book. However, if, for example, we want to see all the
portions of the specimen or all the precipitate phases
that are diffracting into a set of diffraction spots (e.g.,
{111} rather than (111)) then we can either take separate
CDF images from all the individual (111) reflections in
the SADP (which is obviously a pain) or we can carry
out hollow-cone (also called conical) diffraction andDF
imaging. Likewise, if your specimen is micro/nanocrys-
talline so it generates a ring pattern, or if it is amorphous
so diffuse-intensity rings are formed, then we can use the
same technique to maximize the information in the
images. There are two ways to do hollow-cone DF
imaging: hardware and software. In essence, in either
method, a specific set of diffracted beams is collected
by the objective aperture when the conical-scanning
beam satisfies a particular Bragg reflection condition
(see Section 3.10 and Chapter 11).
</p>
<p>&amp; Hardware: Use an annular condenser aperture such
that a cone of electrons illuminates the specimen at a
fixed angle to the optic axis. Annular apertures fab-
ricated by FIB techniques (see Chapter 10) are
becoming more commonly available. (Think about
how to make an annular aperture so that the middle
doesn&rsquo;t just fall out of the doughnut shape leaving
just a large circular hole?) So then we basically have
multiple DPs formed; the direct (000) beam travels
through the specimen and emerges off axis and a set
of diffracted beams (depending on the cone angle) is
always scattered on axis.
</p>
<p>&amp; Software: Use computer control of the scan coils to
spin the incident (and thus the direct) beam around
the optic axis. Thismethod is obviouslymore flexible
because, while an annular C2 aperture gives a fixed
cone (semi) angle, the scan coils can be adjusted to
give a variable cone angle. Thus, with the software
approach, all the electrons scattered at a specific
angle can be integrated into a single DF image
which you can envisage as spinning (Figure 9.14C)
around so that a set of diffraction spots always
rotates through the optic axis. The principle of
hollow-cone diffraction and imaging is shown in
Figure 9.15.

</p>
<p>from dozens of grains. The scale bar is 500 nm.
</p>
<p>9 .3 FORMING DP S AND IMAGES : THE TEM IMAGING SYSTEM ..................................................................................................... 157</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Computer control of the scan coils allows you to
select the angle, i.e., the radius of the circle, thus select-
ing which (hkl) ring is to be on the optic axis. You can
also control the speed of the rotation so you can syn-
chronize a single rotation with sufficient exposure time
to record the DF image. This process is analogous to
the normal DF tilt controls that shift the DP in the x&ndash;y
plane (by tilting the incident beam as in Figure 9.14C)
being replaced with r&ndash;y axis controls. If you observe
the rotating DP with the objective aperture removed,
the direct (000) beam describes a circle, radius r,
around the optic axis. Any point in the DP that is
distance r from the (000) spot will at some time pass
through the optic axis during the rotation of the DP.
An example of a hollow-cone DP (not spinning) is
shown in Figure 9.15C. The SAD aperture was
about the size of the image (� 50 mm across) and
the objective aperture was small enough to permit
diffracted intensity from only one ring to be col-
lected. Figure 9.15B, D and E shows, respectively,
a BF image of a polycrystalline metal film from which
the DP in Figure 9.15C was obtained, a conventional
CDF from a few spots in the DP ring and the hollow-
cone DF, revealing many more diffracting grains. You
usually have to take a series of time exposures to get a
good hollow-cone image. Figure 9.15E was a 20-second
exposure during which time the DP rotated about 1000
times through the objective aperture!
</p>
<p>Hollow-cone DPs are also discussed in Section 18.6.
A closely related technique, precession diffraction, is
covered in Section 18.8. The STEM equivalent of hol-
low-cone DF imaging is annular-DF imaging, which
we&rsquo;ll talk about in the next section.
</p>
<p>9.4 FORMING DPs AND IMAGES:
THE STEM IMAGING SYSTEM
</p>
<p>If you want to use a fine probe to form STEM images
then the objective-lens optics are a little more complex
than in TEM. The key feature to remember is that the
scanning beammust not change direction as the beam is
scanned (unlike in an SEM where the scanning beam
simply pivots about a point above the specimen). If the
incident direction varies then the electron scattering
(particularly the diffraction) processes would change
as the beam intercepts the specimen at different angles.
So interpreting the image contrast would be rather dif-
ficult to say the least.
</p>
<p>As we show in Figure 9.16, the way we achieve
parallel incidence is to use two pairs of scan coils to
pivot the beam about the FFP of the upper objective
(C3) polepiece. The C3 lens then ensures that all elec-
trons emerging from the pivot point are brought parallel
to the optic axis and an image of the C1 lens crossover is
formed in the specimen plane. Now, if the objective lens
is symmetrical, and the lower objective polepiece is
similarly strong, then a stationary DP is formed in the
BFP (this pattern does not move, even though the beam
is scanning, since it is conjugate with the FFP, as shown
in Figure 9.17). If we stop the beam from scanning, then
we have a CBED pattern in the BFP and we can project
that onto the TEM computer screen if we wish. So let&rsquo;s
first discuss how to form STEM images.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 9.16. Scanning the convergent probe for STEM image forma-
</p>
<p>tion using two pairs of scan coils between the C2 lens (usually switched
</p>
<p>off) and the upper-objective polepiece. The double-deflection process
</p>
<p>ensures that the probe remains parallel to the optic axis as it scans across
</p>
<p>the specimen surface.
</p>
<p>STEM
The beam must scan parallel to the optic axis at all
times so that it mimics the parallel beam in a TEM
even though it&rsquo;s scanning.
</p>
<p>THE STEM IMAGING LENS?
The STEM image quality depends on the probe. The
probe has aberrations because we use a lens to form
it. So the STEM image quality does depend on a lens
(just not on an imaging lens).
</p>
<p>158 ..........................................................................................................................................................................................THE INSTRUMENT</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>One potentially very big advantage for STEM is that,
just like in an SEM, we don&rsquo;t use lenses to form the
image. So defects in the imaging lenses do not affect our
image resolution, which is limited by the beam dimen-
sions. Hence chromatic aberration which (as we saw
back in Section 6.5.B) can seriously limit TEM image
resolution, is absent in STEM images. This is a great
advantage if you&rsquo;re dealing with a thick specimen.
However, there are drawbacks also, as we&rsquo;ll discuss
below and in Part 3, and STEM images aren&rsquo;t widely
used, particularly for crystalline specimens.
</p>
<p>9.4.A Bright-Field STEM Images
</p>
<p>Image formation in the scanning mode is fundamentally
different from static-beam TEM image formation. As
you&rsquo;ve just seen in the TEM, we select a portion of the
electrons emerging from an area of the specimen and
project that distribution onto a screen. The principle of
scanning-image formation is shown in Figure 9.18. Sim-
ply stated, we scan the beamon the specimen by adjusting
the scan coils; these same coils are used to scan the
computer display synchronously. The electron detector
acts as the interface between the electrons coming from
the specimen and the image viewed on the display screen.
Since it takes up to 2048 scan lines to build up an image
on the recording screen, the whole process of creating a
STEM image is much slower than TEM imaging: it&rsquo;s
serial recording instead of parallel recording.
</p>
<p>This process is exactly the same principle as used in
any scanning-beam instrument such as an SEM or an
STM (scanning-tunneling microscope). Remember that
to form a TEM-BF image, we inserted an aperture into
the plane of the TEM DP and only allowed the direct
electrons through it into the imaging system. In STEM
modewe use an electron detector, in exactly the sameway
aswe use the aperture: we only allow the electrons that we
want to contribute to the image to hit the detector. So we
insert a BF (either a semiconductor or scintillator-PM)
detector onto the axis of the microscope and it intercepts
the direct-beam electrons no matter where the beam is
scanning on the specimen, as shown in Figure 9.19A. So
a variable, direct-beam signal travels from the detector
via an amplification system to modulate the signal on
the computer display, thus building up a BF image as
also shown in Figure 9.19D.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Now in a TEM we can&rsquo;t physically put the detector in
the BFP of the objective lens to form a STEM image,
because it would interfere with the objective aperture.
Therefore, we usually insert the detector into a conjugate
plane to the stationary DP (Figure 9.19B). So when you
form a STEM image in a TEM, you operate the TEM in
diffraction mode and insert a detector into the viewing
chamber of the TEM, either above or below (in which
case you raise) the screen. The stationary DP falls on the
detector and the signal goes to the display. In a DSTEM,
there may not be any imaging-system (or post-specimen)
lenses, in which case the detector is indeed positioned
immediately after the objective lens. Much of what
we&rsquo;ve just said is automatically done when you &lsquo;hit the
STEM button&rsquo;. The message is the same: understand
what is happening in your microscope and why.
</p>
<p>9.4.B Dark-Field STEM Images
</p>
<p>The approach is analogous to that of TEM. We form a
DF image by selecting any or all of the scattered elec-
trons, rather than the direct-beam electrons. Remem-
ber, in a TEM we tilt the incident beam so the scattered
electrons we want to form the image travel down the
optic axis and are selected by the objective aperture. In a
STEM, we do things rather differently.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple to do this with the DP centering controls
or you could also displace the C2 aperture. The former is
to be preferred since doing the latter misaligns the illu-
mination system.
</p>
<p>9.4.C Annular Dark-Field Images
</p>
<p>Rather than using the BF detector for DF imaging, we
usually use an annular detector, which surrounds the BF
detector, and then all the scattered electrons fall onto
that detector. We call this process annular dark-field
(ADF) imaging and it has certain advantages, depend-
ing on the contrast mechanism operating in the speci-
men, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 22. As we show in Figure
9.19A, the ADF detector is centered on the optic axis
and has a hole in the middle, within which the BF
detector sits. The resultant ADF image in this simple
example (Figure 9.19C) is complementary to the BF
image (Figure 9.19D). As you&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 22, we
can also use another annular detector that sits around
</p>
<p>the ADF and picks up the electrons scattered out to
even higher angles forming so-called high-angle (HA)
ADF (or Z-contrast) images in which Rutherford-scat-
tering effects are maximized and diffraction-contrast
effects are smoothed out.
</p>
<p>We can take this idea further and make detectors of
any size or shapewewish. For example, we could design a
detector in which the annulus is split into two halves or
four quadrants and electrically isolate each part of the
detector. Then we can form different images from elec-
trons that fall on different parts of the detector. It&rsquo;s
impossible to do this in a TEM, because the objective
aperture that does the selecting is a hole and can&rsquo;t be cut
up like a semiconductor detector. We&rsquo;ll talk more about
these kinds of detectors when we discuss specific contrast
mechanisms in TEM and STEM images in Chapter 22.
</p>
<p>9.4.D Magnification in STEM
</p>
<p>All the STEM images that we have just described appear
on the computer screen at amagnification that is controlled
by the scan dimensions on the specimen, not the lenses of
the TEM. This is a fundamental difference between scan-
ning and static image formation.
</p>
<p>Because scanning images are not magnified by lenses,
they are not affected by aberrations in the imaging lenses.
They are, however, affected by aberrations of the probe
itself and, therefore, can be improved by (illumination-
system) aberration correctors.
</p>
<p>If the scanned area on the specimen is 10mm� 10mm,
and the resultant image is displayed on a computer screen
with an area 100 mm by 100 mm, then the image magni-
fication is 10�. If the scan dimension is reduced to 1 mm,
the magnification on that same screen is 100�, and so on,
up tomagnifications in excess of 107�, which are common
in dedicated STEMs. As with the TEM, we have to cali-
brate the STEM magnification and the camera length of
the DP we use to create the images.
</p>
<p>9.5 ALIGNMENT AND STIGMATION
</p>
<p>9.5.A Lens Rotation Centers
</p>
<p>You only need to perform two alignments to ensure
that the imaging system is operating correctly. By far
the most important is the alignment of the objective
lens center of rotation and the second is the align-
ment of the DP on the optic axis. To get the best out
of your TEM, you must master these two fundamen-
tal alignments.
</p>
<p>STEM IMAGES
STEM images are NOT magnified by lenses.
</p>
<p>DF STEM
If we want a specific beam of scattered electrons to
fall on the BF detector, we can simply shift the sta-
tionary DP so that the scattered beam is on the optic
axis and hits the BF detector.
</p>
<p>9 .5 AL IGNMENT AND ST IGMAT ION ......................................................................................................................................................... 161</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Basically, the idea of the objective-lens rotation
alignment is to ensure that the objective lens field is
centered around the optic axis, so that the direct-
beam electrons emerging from the specimen see a
symmetric field as they pass through the lens. If
the field is off-center, then the electrons will move
off axis, suffer more aberrations, and your image
will rotate about a position off-axis as you change
the objective lens (focus), as shown schematically in
Figure 9.20.
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #7
</p>
<p>&amp; To center the objective rotation, start at a rela-
tively low magnification (say 10,000�), select an
obvious reference point in the image and move it
to the middle of the screen, and observe the way
the point rotates as you wobble the objective lens
from overfocus to underfocus and back again. If
the point rotates without moving off center, the
lens is aligned, but check the accuracy of the
alignment by going to much higher magnifica-
tions (&gt;105�).
</p>
<p>&amp; If the point moves off center at 10,000� then use the
beam tilts to move the point in the image that is the
center of rotation to the middle of the screen while
continuously wobbling the objective. Repeat the pro-
cess at higher magnifications.
</p>
<p>&amp; Above�105� the wobbler may introduce too large a
rotation, so you may have to defocus the objective
lens manually. The actual steps to do this are instru-
ment-dependent, so consult the manufacturer&rsquo;s
handbook. This process is also called &lsquo;current
centering.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&amp; When the image wobbles (rotates) about the center
of the screen at magnifications &gt;105�, the objective
lens rotation center is well aligned. The higher the
magnification at which you can achieve this, the
better the alignment and the better quality all your
pictures will be.
</p>
<p>This operationmay be computer controlled in modern
TEMs. In some instruments you can also perform &lsquo;voltage
centering&rsquo; in which a varying voltage is applied to the gun
and the objective lens is aligned to ensure that the electrons
remain on axis through the lens as their energy varies. Not
all instruments are capable of this alignment.
</p>
<p>If you change the DP magnification (i.e., the camera
length, L) the whole pattern will move off axis if the
diffraction center is misaligned. To align the center you
have to adjust the projector lens until the central spot in
the DP is on axis and it rotates around the axis as L is
changed. Check themanufacturer&rsquo;s handbook on exactly
how to do this alignment.
</p>
<p>Centering the DP is useful for STEM-image forma-
tion, since you have to center the DP such that the direct
beam hits the BF detector and the scattered beams hit the
ADF detector. Apart from this simple operation, the
STEM imaging system needs no lens alignment.
</p>
<p>9.5.B Correction of Astigmatism in the Imaging
Lenses
</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve centered the image and DP, the main cause
of problems in the imaging system is astigmatism in the
objective and intermediate lenses.
</p>
<p>Despite careful centering of the objective aperture,
residual contamination may also cause astigmatism and
then you have to use the objective stigmators to intro-
duce a compensatory field. You&rsquo;ll find that the effects of
objective astigmatism are harder to see than condenser
astigmatism, which is easily visible on the screen as we
just described. Correct objective astigmatism as follows:
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #8Either look for a small hole
in your specimen or look at a rough corner where the
specimen edge curves through &gt; 908. Ideally you might
use a holey carbon film to correct residual astigmatism,
before you insert your specimen, especially while learning
this procedure, which we illustrate in Figure 9.21.

<p>center is correctly aligned, the image will rotate about the center of the
</p>
<p>screen.
</p>
<p>ASTIGMATISM
Objective-lens astigmatism occurs if the objective
aperture is misaligned, so you must always carefully
center the aperture on the optic axis, symmetrically
around the electron beam used to form the BF or DF
image.
</p>
<p>162 ..........................................................................................................................................................................................THE INSTRUMENT</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Often you can only see objective astigmatism at the
highest magnifications so form a BF image of the
hole or the specimen edge at high magnification
(&gt;105�). First, adjust the illumination system to
ensure a reasonably parallel beam. (Remember:
how to do this depends on whether you have a c/o
lens or not.)
</p>
<p>&amp; Now defocus the objective lens (either over- or under-
focus; it doesn&rsquo;t matter). A Fresnel fringe (which is a
phase-contrast effect, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 27)
should be visible at the thin edge of your specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Alternately underfocus and overfocus the objective
lens (i.e., use the wobbler again).
</p>
<p>&amp; If there is astigmatism, you should see streaking in
the image and this streaking effect will rotate
through 908 as you wobble either side of exact
focus. The streaking is most easily seen by watching
the Fresnel fringe at the edge, as we describe below
for Figure 9.21.
</p>
<p>&amp; Adjust the objective stigmators to compensate for
the streaking at overfocus and then again at
</p>
<p>underfocus (until you&rsquo;re very skilled, you&rsquo;ll probably
have to switch off the wobbler to do this and manu-
ally defocus the objective).
</p>
<p>&amp; Repeat these steps until there is no obvious image
streaking as you defocus and the image merely blurs
when going out of focus.
</p>
<p>&amp; Go to a higher magnification and repeat the
procedure. As with the rotation center, the higher
the magnification at which you can correct the
astigmatism, the better and &gt;250,000� should be
possible. But remember that at higher magnifications
the image intensity will be reduced. Don&rsquo;t try and com-
pensate for this reduced intensity by condensing the
beam because doing sowill destroy the parallelism, thus
reducing the Fresnel-fringe (phase) contrast.
</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 9.21A, when you underfocus the
objective lens, there is a bright Fresnel fringe round the
edge of the hole. If this fringe is uniform around the
hole, then there is no astigmatism. If the fringe varies in
intensity, as in Figure 9.21D, then the focus of the lens is
changing around the hole because of astigmatism. Then
you have to adjust the objective stigmators to make the
fringe uniform. The same operation must be repeated at
overfocus, when there is a dark fringe around the edge
of the hole (Figure 9.21B). At exact focus, you should
see no fringe and the image contrast is minimized (Fig-
ure 9.21C).
</p>
<p>This method of correcting the astigmatism is reason-
able at magnifications up to several hundred thousand
times.
</p>
<p>In practice, if you&rsquo;re working at such high magnifi-
cations, you&rsquo;ll probably have to check the astigmatism
throughout your TEM session, so you should get used
to looking at the Fresnel fringes on a thin, curved edge
of your specimen rather than the ideal holey carbon
film.
</p>
<p>For high-resolution imaging at magnifications
of &gt;300,000�, we have to use the streaking in the
image to correct for astigmatism. We&rsquo;ll talk about this
when we discuss HRTEM in Chapter 28.
</p>
<p>Intermediate-lens astigmatism is of secondary
importance and only affects the DP. Because the DP is
at zero magnification in the objective lens, the inter-
mediate lenses are responsible for magnifying it. So if
there is residual astigmatism in these lenses, then the DP
will show orthogonal distortions as you take it through
focus. This effect is small and can only be seen in the
binoculars as you focus the DP with the diffraction

Magnification calibration is so sensitive to so many
variables that some users deposit a standard material
on thematerial they are studying so that the calibration
will be done under exactly the same conditions and
will appear in the same image as your area of interest.

<p>focus (intermediate lens) control. Make sure that the
incident beam is strongly underfocused to give the sharp-
est spots. As with objective astigmatism in the image,
simply adjust the intermediate stigmators to compen-
sate for any spot distortion at underfocus, and over-
focus until the spots expand and contract uniformly in
all directions through focus. You should be aware that
not all instruments have the requisite intermediate stig-
mators to carry out this correction.
</p>
<p>9.6 CALIBRATING THE IMAGING SYSTEM
</p>
<p>Your TEM should be calibrated when it is first installed
and then periodically throughout its life, especially if you
wish to carry out accurate measurements from images or
DPs. If the instrument is modified substantially (e.g., a
burned-out lens coil is replaced), then it must be recali-
brated. In all cases you must specify a set of standard
conditions under which the calibrations are carried out
(e.g., objective lens current and other lens settings,
eucentric height, etc.). You can find a full description
of all the detailed concerns with all the TEM calibrations
in Edington (1976). Remember, if you&rsquo;re serious about
TEM don&rsquo;t rely on someone else&rsquo;s calibrations.
</p>
<p>9.6.A Magnification Calibration
</p>
<p>We use standard specimens to calibrate the magnifica-
tion. The most common specimen we use is a thin car-
bon-film replica of an optical-diffraction grating of
known spacing, as shown in Figure 9.22A. The typical
linear density of lines in the replica is 2160/mm (giving
a line spacing of 0.463 mm with an error that will
depend on how many grating spacings you can mea-
sure). Grating replicas enable calibration up to magni-
fications of �200,000�. Above this magnification,
individual grating spacings are wider than the recording
film. So we can then use small latex spheres (50&ndash;100 nm
diameter) although they are susceptible to beam damage
and shrinkage under electron bombardment. At the
highest magnifications, phase-contrast images of
known crystal spacings, such as the 0002 spacing in the
graphite structure (0.344 nm) can be used or the 111
fringes of Si. What we are doing is just using a known
periodicity in the crystal; careful consideration of the
objective-lens defocus and specimen thickness is
required before the phase-contrast lattice image can be
directly interpreted, as we discuss in detail in Chapters
27 and 28.
</p>
<p>THE LAST USER
Since you usually will not be the first user, you should
take the time to check the existing calibration. Don&rsquo;t
assume it is correct.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Operational Procedure #9
</p>
<p>&amp; Insert the calibration specimen and ensure the holder
is at the eucentric height.
</p>
<p>&amp; Ensure the illumination is parallel and the objective
aperture is well centered on the 000 spot in the
SADP.
</p>
<p>&amp; Switch back to image mode and then focus the BF
image (see below for the best way to be consistent in
focusing).
</p>
<p>&amp; Record images of the diffraction grating at all mag-
nification settings, taking care to re-check the focus
after each change of magnification.
</p>
<p>&amp; Calculate the magnifications experimentally from
the images knowing the true spacing.
</p>
<p>Figure 9.22B shows the classical magnification calibra-
tion for a Philips CM30 TEM. Today, you&rsquo;ll use a crystal
lattice at�300 k�, relate it to the same area at say 50 k�,
repeat at 10 k�, and then at all magnifications in between.
</p>
<p>You have to calibrate the magnification because the
TEM imaging system does not give stable and reproduci-
ble lens strengths. The lens strengths will change with
ambient temperature (e.g., how many people are in the
room), with the efficiency of the cooling system of the
lenses and with lens hysteresis. Therefore, if you want to
makeaccuratemeasurements fromyourTEMimages, you
must carryout themagnification calibrationat the timeyou
make the measurements. In particular, you have to mini-
mize the lens hysteresis by always approaching image focus
consistently from overfocus or underfocus and/or revers-
ing the lens polarity several times before finally coming to
focus.Also, youmust remember that theremay be barrel
or pincushion distortions in the image particularly at
very low magnification (&lt; 5000�) where the lens is not
designed to workwell. (As students you ought to be able
to work out what the first distortion does to your image,
but you might not be familiar with the latter distortion
at this early stage of your life!)
</p>
<p>Remember that the area of the specimen you are work-
ing on must be at exactly the right &lsquo;height&rsquo; in the col-
umn. Because of the magnification error, the TEM is
not the best instrument for absolute measurement of
particle sizes, etc. However, relative measurement is
easily done with reasonable accuracy (�5%), so long
as you note the precautions we&rsquo;ve just described. With-
out a calibration, the digital readout is probably no
better than �10% accurate, and so it is unwise to state
magnifications to better than �10%. You should be
suspicious of any micrographs that you see in the litera-
ture with a magnification that is more precise than three
(or even two) significant figures such as 52,550�. It may
indicate that the microscopist does not understand
the limitations of their instrument and the work should
be interpreted with due caution.
</p>
<p>We used to call these lines &lsquo;micron bars&rsquo; for obvious
reasons but TEM magnifications have become larger
and &lsquo;nano bars&rsquo; would often be more appropriate
(even though neither one is related to barrel distortion).
All modern TEMs automatically put such a marker on
the negative. However, its accuracy is only as good as
your operational skills.
</p>
<p>You can use an identical procedure to calibrate the
STEM-display magnification despite the fact that the
digital STEM-image magnification is, in principle,
easily calculated from the scan-coil strengths. The
image magnification differs from the digital readout
because of variations in the objective lens. Table 9.1
shows the difference between a typical digital STEM
magnification and the experimentally determined mag-
nification using a diffraction-grating replica.
</p>
<p>9.6.B Camera-Length Calibration
</p>
<p>As mentioned already, we describe the magnification of
the DP by the camera length (L), a term that arises from
X-ray projection-diffraction cameras which operate with-
out lenses (because focusing X-rays is very difficult). In
such cameras, magnification is increased by moving the
recording film further away from the specimen, in exactly
the same way that you magnify your computer-slide
presentations onto a screen by moving the projector
further away. (You can always tell non-microscopists
who try to focus their slides in the same way, or those

<p>The camera-length concept can be applied in the

</p>
<p>The camera length is a calculated value rather than a

angle 2y at the specimen (as in a typical diffraction event
described in Chapters 2 and 11), then the distance
between the direct and diffracted beams as measured

focused then focus with the first intermediate lens (dif-
fraction focus) control. Be careful if you have a c/o lens
because changing the illumination conditions (e.g., try-
ing tomake the beammoreparallel)will change theDP
focus. If you then sharpen the DP by changing the
diffraction focus, the camera length will change. If in
doubt, consult the manufacturer&rsquo;s handbook.
</p>
<p>&amp; Since we know the lattice parameter of the metal, we
can measure the ring radius R on the photographic
film or computer display for any plane that is diffract-
ing (seeChapter 18 to find out exactly howwe do this).
</p>
<p>&amp; Since we know l we can easily determine L from
equation 9.2.
</p>
<p>A typical TEM camera-length calibration is shown
in Table 9.2. The STEM camera-length calibration may
be different to the TEM if the objective lens setting is not
exactly the same in TEM and STEM modes, and this
depends on the vintage andmake of your instrument. So
you should check with the manufacturer before taking
the time to perform the calibration.

<p>It&rsquo;s worth explaining in more detail the effect of a c/o
lens on the SAD calibration. In a c/o lens, as shownback in
Figure 9.5, the beam can go from divergent to convergent
conditionsat the specimenplane.However, unless thebeam
is parallel, your DP focus will change with illumination
angle. In this case, the diffraction-lens setting at the point
of focus of your DP will differ for different illumination
conditions. So Lwill change (by as much as 15%) depend-
ing on the angle of convergence/divergence. In order to
ensure the same L, you must pick one condition and use it
for every calibrated DP. There are several ways to do this.
</p>
<p>&amp; Set the diffraction lens to the same excitation for
each pattern and focus the DP with the C2 lens.
</p>
<p>&amp; Focus the pattern at the objective aperture (espe-
cially if the BFP of the objective and the objective
aperture share the same position).
</p>
<p>&amp; Go to themaximumvalue of theC2 lens, focus theDP,
and use the C1 lens to adjust the brightness of the DP.
</p>
<p>There are other possibilities which you&rsquo;ll be able to
work out as you get more skilled but, above all, be
consistent and always use the conditions you chose
when you did the calibration.
</p>
<p>9.6.C Rotation of the Image Relative to the DP
</p>
<p>Anyone studying crystalline materials must determine
the angle between directions in the image and directions
in the DP. At a fixed camera length, the DP always
appears on the screen in a fixed orientation. But if you
record images at different magnifications, the images
will rotate by an angle f with respect to the fixed DP.
(In some TEMs this rotation has been removed by the
addition of a compensating projector lens and, in this
case, there is always a fixed rotation (ideally 08) between
directions common to both image and DP.)
</p>
<p>Operational Procedure #11 To determine this rota-
tion, we often use a specimen of a-MoO3, because it
forms thin, asymmetric crystals with a long edge
known to be parallel to the 001 direction in the crystal.
</p>
<p>&amp; Take care to ensure that, as usual, the image is
focused with the specimen at the eucentric plane.
</p>
<p>&amp; Insert the SAD aperture and ensure that it is focused
(using the intermediate lenses) to coincide with the
image plane.
</p>
<p>&amp; Switch to diffraction mode with the beam parallel
and adjust the diffraction focus to give sharp diffrac-
tion maxima.
</p>
<p>&amp; Take a double exposure of the DP and the image as
shown in Figure 9.24A.
</p>
<p>&amp; Repeat the whole exercise for different magnifica-
tions and plot out the variation of the angle f as
shown in Figure 9.24B.
</p>
<p>&amp; You can do the same, if necessary, for different
values of L, which introduce a systematic change in
f. For this reason, we recommend that you carry out
all your SAD work at a standard value of L;
500&ndash;1000mm is usually optimum.
</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN RULE
Always do the calibrations yourself. Do not rely on
factory calibrations. The conditions you use in your
laboratory may differ from those chosen by the
manufacturer.

</p>
<p>9 .6 CAL IBRAT ING THE IMAGING SYSTEM ............................................................................................................................................. 167</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A further complicating factor is that, as the image
magnification is increased, the TEM lens control logic
may switch off, or switch on, one of the imaging-system
lenses. When this happens, a 1808 inversion is intro-
duced into the image. You can see this happen if you
watch the image carefully as you change the magnifica-
tion. This inversion has to be included in the rotation
calibration, otherwise a 1808 error will be made in the
assignment of directions in the image. One way to see if
the image has a 1808 inversion is to look at the DP
and defocus it slightly so the BF image in the direct
beam can be seen directly at very low magnification.
The 1808 inversion is immediately obvious, as shown in
Figure 9.25. As we already noted, some manufacturers
adjust the imaging-system lenses to compensate for the
rotation, thus keeping a constant image-DP rotation
angle at all magnifications. Likewise, in STEM mode,
since the imaging lenses are not used for magnification,
there is a fixed angle between the images and DPs.
</p>
<p>McCaffrey and Baribeau used molecular-beam epi-
taxy to create a cross section TEM specimen made from
a single-crystal Si/Ge wafer specimen that can perform
these three major calibrations (magnification, camera-
length, and image/DP rotation). Similar specimens are
</p>
<p>available from suppliers of TEM consumables (see
URLs 1&ndash;3, for example). These suppliers also offer a
range of standard specimens for other TEM needs (e.g.,
XEDS and EELS analysis). If you are serious about
your microscopy, buy your own standards, keep them
safe and clean, and use them often.
</p>
<p>9.6.D Spatial Relationship Between Images
and DPs
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t use a double exposure when comparing
images and DPs (or indeed when comparing directions
in any two films) you need a fixed reference line. This
line must be independent of slight variations that may
arise depending on the film size, how you loaded it,
etc. The best reference line is the edge of the plate-
numbering system that is superimposed on each film.
</p>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s advice:
Whenever you&rsquo;re comparing images and DPs, it is
essential to compare the photographic negatives
with the emulsion side up. This is contrary to usual
photographic practice, but it&rsquo;s necessary to preserve
the relationship betweenmanipulations of your speci-
men and what you see happening on the screen. If you
don&rsquo;t do this, it is easy to introduce a 1808 error into
the relationships between images and DPs.
Today&rsquo;s advice:
Don&rsquo;t use film. If you use a CCD, you&rsquo;ll never think
of inverting the image!
</p>
<p>9.7 OTHER CALIBRATIONS
</p>
<p>The accelerating voltage: The selected voltage may differ
from the absolute voltage by detectable amounts. There
are several ways to determine the actual voltage: First,
you can measure the electron wavelength, l, by measur-
ing the angle, f, between two Kikuchi line pairs (see
Chapter 19) that intersect a distance R from the direct
beam
</p>
<p>tanf &frac14;
R
</p>
<p>L
&frac14;
</p>
<p>l
</p>
<p>d
(9:3)
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you canmatch simulationsofHOLZ lines to
experimental lines in CBED patterns (see Chapter 21) and
determine which l gives the best match. Finally, in princi-
ple, you could get your XEDS computer system to display
the X-ray spectrum (Chapter 34) out to E0, the beam
energy, and the bremsstrahlung intensity vanishes to zero
at the exact beam energy (this is called the Duane-Hunt
limit). However, XEDS computer displays rarely show
energies&gt; 30&ndash;40 keV.

</p>
<p>rotated with respect to the image on the screen, as in (C) and (D), then a
</p>
<p>1808 inversion is required to determine the correct angle between direc-
</p>
<p>tions in the DP and directions in the image. In (A) and (B), no rotation
</p>
<p>occurs between the DP and BF image.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The specimen tilt axis and the sense of tilt: In a side-
entry stage, the principal tilt axis is parallel to the speci-
men-holder rod. Since the image is usually rotated on
the screen relative to the specimen, how can you locate
this tilt-axis direction? Well it&rsquo;s easy if you can move the
specimen in a known direction. From this movement,
you can determine the direction of the tilt axis for a
specimen of known geometry.
</p>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s advice:
If you gently push on the end of your side-entry speci-
men holder, the image moves parallel to the principal
tilt axis. But don&rsquo;t pull the holder in the other direc-
tion since youmay inadvertently cause air to leak into
the airlock.
Today&rsquo;s advice:
We&rsquo;re not letting you remove the draft-excluder
(which covers the end of your specimen holder) to
touch the holder after it has equilibrated. Monitor
how you load the specimen instead which takes care
and practice&mdash;but so do most TEM operations.
</p>
<p>If you are looking at the DP, defocus the pattern so
you can see the BF image in the direct-beam spot, as in
Figure 9.26, then carry out the same exercise. If you are
using a top-entry holder you will need to calibrate this
tilt using a known specimen geometry, which is more
challenging.
</p>
<p>Focal increments of the objective lens: If you&rsquo;re going
to do high-resolution, phase-contrast imaging and you
don&rsquo;t have a Cs corrector, then you need to know the
</p>
<p>value of each defocus step of the objective lens so you
can correctly calculate and interpret the image contrast.
There is a simplemethod for determining this step value.
Superimpose a focused image and an image defocused
by a known number of objective-lens focal increments
(Df). The two images will be separated by a distance Dx
which is related to Df by
</p>
<p>Df &frac14;
Dx
</p>
<p>2Mmy
(9:4)
</p>
<p>where M is the magnification, m is the number of
focal increments, and y is the Bragg angle for the
reflectionused to form the image. If you insert some typical
values, you&rsquo;ll find that it is difficult to be very accurate
with thismethod.We&rsquo;ll return to this topic in Chapter 28.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
We&rsquo;ve now shown you how aTEM is put together.While themanufacturer does the best job
possible, there are still some essential steps for you, the operator, to carry out. You must
understand how to align the illumination system so the beam is on axis. You can then create
a parallel beam for TEM and a convergent one for STEM. The C2 aperture is a crucial part
of the whole illumination system and the most easily misaligned. Astigmatism is not too
much of a problem if the instrument in general and the apertures in particular are kept clean.
The objective lens/stage combination controls all the useful information that is created as
the beam is scattered by your specimen. Always start a microscope session by fixing the
eucentric height and, before you do any worthwhile imaging, align the objective center of
rotation, and minimize any objective astigmatism at high magnification. Diffraction and
STEM operations require a centered, focused DP.
</p>
<p>If youwant tomake any quantitativemeasurements from your images andDPs (and you
really ought to do this if you have any aspirations to be a real microscopist), then calibration
cannot be avoided. Your images and DPs are relatively useless unless you know their
magnification and camera length, respectively, and the angular relationship between the
two. So take the time to do this early in your studies. In doing so you will not only ensure
that you produce quality data, but you will also learn an enormous amount about how these
complex instruments work.
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that some of the data (e.g., Figure 9.12B and Table 9.1) are for older
TEMs. It would be better to use data from even older machines (&lsquo;&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;&rsquo; you should ask)
but you are unlikely to see such machines in operation.

<p>between thediffractiondisks). If the specimenholder ismoved in thedirection
</p>
<p>of the principal tilt axis, the image will move and identify the relationship
</p>
<p>between that tilt axis and the crystallographic direction in the DP.

SAD was invented by LePoole in 1947. Some early machines used a pair of blades with a 908 bend that slid

<p>Specimen Preparation
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Specimen preparation is a very broad subject; there are books devoted to this topic alone.
The intention here is to summarize the techniques, suggest routes that youmight follow, and
above all to emphasize that there are many ways to produce a TEM specimen; the one you
choose will depend on the information you need, time constraints, availability of equip-
ment, your skill, and the material. So we&rsquo;ll concentrate on the &lsquo;principles of cooking,&rsquo; but
won&rsquo;t try to list all the possible &lsquo;recipes.&rsquo; One important point to bear in mind is that your
technique must not affect what you see or measure, or if it does, then you must know how.
Specimen preparation artifacts may be interesting but they are not usually what you want to
study. Incidentally, we&rsquo;ll make &lsquo;specimens&rsquo; from the &lsquo;sample&rsquo; we&rsquo;re investigating so we&rsquo;ll
look at &lsquo;TEM specimens,&rsquo; but sometimes we, and everyone else, will interchange the two
words.
</p>
<p>The TEM specimen, when you&rsquo;ve made it, must be electron transparent (usually) and
representative of the material you want to study. In most cases (but not all) you would
like your specimen to be uniformly thin, stable under the electron beam and in the
laboratory environment, conducting, and non-magnetic (we&rsquo;ll discuss some exceptions
as we proceed). Few specimens approach the ideal and usually you have to compromise.
In general we can divide specimens into two groups: self-supporting specimens and
specimens resting on a support grid or thin washer; the grid or washer is usually Cu but
could be Au, Ni, Be, C, Pt, etc. Before discussing these two groups we will briefly review
the most important part of specimen preparation, namely, safety. You may damage the
microscope later, but this is the stage where you could domuch worse to yourself and your
colleagues.
</p>
<p>It is often assumed that preparation of the TEM specimen will take several hours.
Actually this time could be as short as 5 minutes or as long as 2 days even for the same
material. For example, as you&rsquo;ll see, if you want to examine a piece of YBa2Cu3O6+x, the
high-temperature superconductor, you could crush the sample in a pestle andmortar using a
nonaqueous solvent, catch the small particles on a carbon film, and put the specimen in the
TEM; time required is about 10 minutes. Alternatively, you might cut the sample into thin
slices using a diamond saw, cut 3-mm-diameter disks from the slice, thin the disk on a
grinding wheel, dimple the thinned disk, then ion mill to electron transparency at liquid-
nitrogen temperatures, carefully warm the specimen to room temperature in a dry environ-
ment, and put it in the TEM; time required is 1 or 2 days. Which method you choose would
depend on what you want to learn about your material.
</p>
<p>10.1 SAFETY
</p>
<p>Either the specimen itself or the best method for prepar-
ing it for viewing in the TEM may require extreme care.
Even materials which are safe and relatively inert in bulk
form may be hazardous in powder form. Four favorite
(because they work so well) liquids for polishing solu-
tions are hydrogen cyanide, hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid,
</p>
<p>and perchloric acid. These liquids may be poisonous,
corrosive (HF quickly penetrates the body and then dis-
solves the bone), or explosive (perchloric acid and nitric
acid when mixed with certain organic solvents). It is
clearly essential that you check with your laboratory
manager, the reference texts, and the appropriate materi-
als safety data sheets (MSDS) before you begin specimen
preparation. This checking might also save a lot of time.
</p>
<p>10 .1 SAFETY ................................................................................................................................................................................................. 173</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In spite of these restrictions you may still need/want
to use these acids and acid/solvent mixtures. The ion
thinner may not be available or you may not be able to
accept the damage that ions produce. In this event there
are five brief points that you should bear in mind.
</p>
<p>&amp; Be sure that you can safely dispose of the waste
product before you start.
</p>
<p>&amp; Be sure you have the &lsquo;antidote&rsquo; at hand.
&amp; Never work alone in the specimen-preparation labora-
tory. Always wear safety glasses when preparing speci-
mens and/or full protective clothing, including face
masks and gloves, if so advised by the safety manual.
</p>
<p>&amp; Only make up enough of the solution for the one
polishing session. Never use a mouth pipette for
measuring any component of the solution. Dispose
of the solution after use.
</p>
<p>&amp; Always work in a fume hood when using chemicals.
Check that the extraction rate of the hood is suffi-
cient for the chemical used.
</p>
<p>Since these four acids can be so dangerous, we&rsquo;ll
mention them specifically, but remember&mdash;always seek
advice before chemically preparing specimens.
</p>
<p>Cyanide solutions: If possible, avoid this solution
even though you may see it in the textbooks. The only
metal where it really excels is gold and you can thin this
by very careful ion milling.
</p>
<p>Perchloric acid in ethanol or methanol: If you have to
use this &lsquo;universal polish&rsquo; you should be aware that
many laboratories require that you use a special dedi-
cated hood which can be completely washed down since
crystallized perchloric acid is explosive. The phase dia-
gram in Figure 10.1 for the perchloric-acetic (acid)-
water system makes the message clear. If you have to
use perchloric-acetic acid mixtures or indeed when using
any perchloric-containing mixtures, keep the density
below 1.48. If you are very careful, if you always add
the acid to the solvent, and youmake sure that the liquid
never becomes warm, then perchloric acid solutions can
be used to produce excellent TEM specimens of Al,
stainless steel, and many other metals and alloys.
</p>
<p>Nitric acid: In combination with ethanol, this acid
can produce explosivemixtures, especially if left for long
periods of time and exposed to sunlight. It is preferable
to use methanol rather than ethanol, but in either case,
keep the mixture cool and dispose of it properly.
</p>
<p>HF: This acid is widely used in the semiconductor
industry and in &lsquo;frosting&rsquo; light bulbs; the reason in both
</p>
<p>cases is that it dissolves SiO2 leaving no residue. Careful
use of dilute solutions can produce specimens that have
large thin areas. Remember: if you use HF, completely
cover any exposed skin; HF rapidly penetrates the flesh
and dissolves bone and you won&rsquo;t even feel it!
</p>
<p>10.2 SELF-SUPPORTING DISK OR USE
A GRID?
</p>
<p>The type of TEM specimen you prepare depends on
what you are looking for so you need to think about
the experiment that you are going to do before you start
thinning. For example, is mechanical damage to be
avoided at all costs, or can it be tolerated so long as
chemical changes don&rsquo;t occur&mdash;or vice versa? Is the
specimen at all susceptible to heat or radiation?
Depending on the answers to these questions, some of
the following methods will be inappropriate. A flow
diagram summarizing the different preparation philos-
ophies is shown in Figure 10.2.
</p>
<p>A self-supporting specimen is one where the whole
specimen consists of one material (which may be a
composite). Other specimens are supported on a grid
or on a Cu washer with a single slot. Several grids are
</p>
<p>SAFETY FIRST
This whole section should, of course, be in a big red
box. Some of the chemicals we use are really dangerous.
We remember HF, perchloric acid, and HCN all being
used concurrently in one small specimen-prep room.

Think about your choice of material for the support-

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>shown in Figure 10.3. Usually the specimen or grid will
be 3 mm in diameter.
</p>
<p>Both approaches have advantages and disadvan-
tages. Both offer you a convenient way of handling the
thin specimen, since either the edge of the self-support-
ing disk or the grid will be thick enough to pick up with
tweezers. If possible, never touch your specimen when it
is thin. We recommend vacuum tweezers, but you&rsquo;ll
need to practice using them; you can quite easily vibrate
the specimen and break the thin area. You can get round
this by usingmouth-vacuum tweezers but see the section
on safety first. Mechanical stability is always crucial.
For example, single crystals of GaAs or NiO break very
easily, so it is usually an advantage to have your speci-
men mounted on a grid since you then &lsquo;handle&rsquo; the
grid. However, if you are performing X-ray analysis on
</p>
<p>a specimen the grid may contribute to the signal,
because the X-rays can also arise from the grid. Thus
you see a Cu peak in the X-ray spectrum where no Cu is
present in the specimen. We&rsquo;ll talk in Chapter 33 about
how to minimize this artifact. Of course, the self-sup-
porting specimen essentially has the same problem&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just not as obvious! In fact, the preferred geometry for
such analysis is usually the one where the specimen is
thinnest.
</p>
<p>Why 3-mm disks? The disk diameter is usually a
nominal 3.05 mm. We thus refer to the specimen as a
3-mm disk. Occasionally you will encounter a micro-
scope which uses a 2.3-mm disk. The smaller diameter
was used in earlier microscopes and has two important
advantages, which are not fully exploited by modern
machines. Ideally, the region of the specimen which
you want to study will be located at the center of your
disk, no matter how large the disk is. As we saw in
Chapter 9, the reason is that, as you tilt the specimen
in the microscope, the region of interest will then stay at
the same position (height) above the objective lens and
on the optic axis. Since, for a self-supporting disk, the
rim of the specimenmust be relatively thick and the total
area of the material you&rsquo;ll study is small and confined to
the center of the disk, you can makemore 2.3-mm speci-
mens from a given volume of material. This may be very
important if the specimen is particularly special (expen-
sive, rare) or if specimens break easily. A sample which
is 5 mm� 5 mmwill give one 3-mm disk or four 2.3-mm
disks. The second advantage of such specimens relates
to tilting; the smaller specimen holder can be manufac-
tured to allow a greater tilt angle. Don&rsquo;t forget that if
you need only one axis of tilt you may find the bulk
holder useful. Then you can use a specimen which may
be up to 10 mm long and 3 mm wide.

<p>10.3 PREPARING A SELF-SUPPORTING
DISK FOR FINAL THINNING
</p>
<p>Preparation for final thinning involves three parts

<p>&amp; Initial thinning to make a slice of material between
100 and 200 mm thick.
</p>
<p>&amp; Cut the 3-mm disk from the slice.

the disk to a few micrometers.

THE DIAMETER OF TEM SPECIMENS
</p>
<p>Why are the TEM specimens 3.05 mm in diameter?
Because the manufacturers say so. Must this always
be the case? Only if you need to double-tilt or tilt-
rotate.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The method you use will depend on what you want
to study and the physical characteristics of the material
(whether it is soft or hard, ductile or brittle, delicate or
robust, single phase or a composite, etc.).
</p>
<p>10.3.A Forming a Thin Slice from the Bulk
Sample
</p>
<p>The materials you may need to thin can vary enor-
mously. Clearly, we have to treat ductile and brittle
materials differently.
</p>
<p>(a) Ductile materials such as metals. Usually you
don&rsquo;t want to introduce mechanical damage. For exam-
ple, you may want to study the defect structure or the
density of defects in processed materials. The ideal
method is to use a chemical wire/string saw, a wafering
saw (not diamond&mdash;the soft metal will dull the blade), or
spark erosion (electro-discharge machining) to get a
thin slice &lt; 200 mm. (A string saw works by passing
the string through an acid or solvent and then across the
sample until the string &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; through the sample; for
example, you can use dilute acid to cut copper.) You
could also roll the material to, very thin sheet, then
anneal it to remove the defects introduced by rolling
but that&rsquo;s a different material-processing route.
</p>
<p>(b) Brittle materials such as ceramics. Here there are
two cases: (i) where you must not introduce mechanical
damage, (ii) where you don&rsquo;t mind introducing mechan-
ical damage or the material won&rsquo;t damage. You have
several options depending on the material. Some mate-
rials (Si, GaAs, NaCl, MgO) can be cleaved with a razor
blade; these are materials with a well-defined cleavage
plane and it is possible to carry out repeated cleavage to
electron transparency (see Section 10.6.E). The ultrami-
crotome (see Section 10.6.B) allows you to cut very thin
slices for immediate examination. If you don&rsquo;t want to
cleave the specimen or you want to prepare a specimen
parallel to a plane that doesn&rsquo;t cleave, you will need to
use a diamond wafering saw. There are special tech-
niques for some materials: you can, for example, use
water as the solvent on a string saw to cut rock salt. One
of the main limitations with sawing is that the process
destroys some of your sample.
</p>
<p>10.3.B Cutting the Disk
</p>
<p>The same constraints hold for the coring process as for
cutting slices: if the material is reasonably ductile and
mechanical damage is not crucial, then the disks can be
cut using a mechanical punch. A well-designed punch
can cut disks with only minimal damage around the
perimeter, but the shock can induce shear transforma-
tions in some materials. For more brittle materials the
three principal methods are spark erosion (also essential
when you need to avoid damage in a metal), ultrasonic
drilling, and using a grinding drill. In each case the cutting
</p>
<p>tool is a hollow tube with an inner diameter of 3 mm.
Again, you want the wall of the tube to be thin to
minimize the amount of material that is wasted. Spark
erosion is used for conducting samples and introduces
the least amount of mechanical damage. The choice
between an ultrasonic drill (vibrating in H2O) and a
grinding (or slurry) drill is often a matter of personal
preference or availability. Both remove material
mechanically and are widely used for ceramics and semi-
conductors. The drill may leave small particles in the
specimen, and all mechanical thinning methods leave
some surface damage. As a rule of thumb, abrasives
produce damage to 3� their grit size. So a 1-mm abrasive
will cause damage to 3 mm below the surface of each side
of the specimen. Hence the final disk must be thicker
than the 2� the damage depth or else mechanical
damage will always be visible in the final specimen.
Four different coring instruments from one manufac-
turer are shown in Figure 10.4.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Note that there are variations for all these tech-
niques: e.g., for Si, GaAs, and some other materials,
you can glue the sample to a support, coat it with a
protective layer, and cut circles through the film&mdash;then
chemically etch the desired region. You need to experi-
ment but the method should introduce no mechanical
damage.
</p>
<p>10.3.C Prethinning the Disk
</p>
<p>The aim of this process is to thin the center of the disk
while minimizing damage to the surface of the sample.
In general we will refer to this stage as &lsquo;dimpling&rsquo; no
matter how the thinning is achieved. Any damage you
create at this stage will have to be removed during the
final thinning process (if you&rsquo;re interested in defects or if
the damage changes your chemistry).
</p>
<p>Most commercial mechanical dimplers use a small-
radius tool to grind and polish the disk to a fixed radius
of curvature in the center. Although the first instru-
ments for dimpling were &lsquo;home built&rsquo; the commercial
models (see Figure 10.5) are now well developed. You
can control the load, precisely determine the thickness
of removed material (the depth of the dimple), quickly
change the polishing tool, and interrupt the process to
remove the sample for closer examination before con-
tinuing. The investment is well justified for materials
laboratories. One alternative that has been used success-
fully is a (recycled) dentist&rsquo;s drill and some imagination.
Typically dimpling can be carried out to produce
regions �10 mm thick although, in principle, precision
dimpling with microprocessor control can sometimes
produce electron-transparent specimens which are
&lt;1 mm thick.
</p>
<p>For mechanical dimpling, as a general rule, the same
guidelines apply as to all mechanical polishing; always
gradually decrease the &lsquo;grit&rsquo; size and conclude with the
finest available, again ensuring that the final specimen
thinness is &gt;2� the damage depth of the smallest grit
dimension. The better the polished surface, the better
the final specimen. If both sides of a disk are dimpled the
chances of final perforation occurring in the center are
substantially increased, but in some cases you may wish
to preserve one side of the specimen and thin from the
other side only. One-sided dimpling is then essential
prior to thinning to perforation.
</p>
<p>Dimpling can also be performed chemically. Often
in the case of Si this is achieved by allowing a jet of HF
and HNO3 to impinge (from below as shown in Figure
10.6) on the Si disk which has the edges lacquered to
produce a supporting rim. The HNO3 oxidizes the Si
and the HF removes the SiO2. Similar approaches use
Br and methanol for thinning GaAs. This dimpling
method uses dangerous chemicals, but it is very effi-
cient. It can even be carried to final perforation with
care.
</p>
<p>TEM specimen preparation has been revolution-
ized through the development of the tripod polisher;
this tool can help you to thin your sample mechani-
cally to less than 1 mm. You must consult the general
references at the end of the chapter before using this
tool. The tripod polisher, so called because it has
three feet, is simply a device to hold your specimen
while you mechanically thin it on a polishing wheel.
You can purchase a tripod polisher commercially or
build your own.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For some materials, such as Si, you can use this
polisher to thin the specimen to electron transparency.
</p>
<p>There are, however, several secrets in using the tri-
pod polisher.
</p>
<p>&amp; You must use a very flat polishing wheel; the recom-
mended approach is to use a glass platen. Take the
greatest care in adjusting the micrometer to level the
tripod.
</p>
<p>&amp; You need a supply of fine diamond lapping films;
these are not inexpensive but it is a false economy to
use them after they are worn. Always use a new sheet
for polishing the second side of your sample since it
is then particularly vulnerable.
</p>
<p>&amp; The diamond lapping films must not have an adhe-
sive backing; you &lsquo;fix&rsquo; them to the glass platen using
the surface tension of the water and ensure that they
are flat using a wiper blade. Bumps under the films
will destroy your specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Any debris on the filmwill reduce its useful life; if the
pad dries with polishing paste still present you
should discard it.
</p>
<p>&amp; Minimize the effect of debris, which you produce on
the polishing film as you thin your sample, by paying
careful attention to where you place the specimen on
the polishing wheel; orient interfaces in cross section
samples normal to the radius and don&rsquo;t cross the
debris trail.
</p>
<p>With practice, tripod polishing can dramatically
reduce the time required for the final thinning step.
This tool has had a major impact on making TEM a
quality-control instrument, particularly in the semicon-
ductor industry.
</p>
<p>10.4 FINAL THINNING OF THE DISKS
</p>
<p>10.4.A Electropolishing
</p>
<p>Electropolishing can only be used for electrically
conducting samples such as metals and alloys. The
method can be relatively quick (a few minutes to an
hour or so) and it can produce foils with no mechan-
ical damage. But it can change the surface chemistry
of the specimen and it can be hazardous to your
health as you can see from the safety section at the
start of the chapter.
</p>
<p>The basic premise is that there is a certain applied
voltage at which the current due to anodic dissolution of
the specimen creates a polished surface rather than etch-
ing or pitting, as shown in Figure 10.7. The classical jet
polish is shown in Figure 10.8A. By keeping the volume
of the reservoir constant, the jet falls under constant
pressure. The voltage is applied between the tip of the
pipette and the specimen. A twin-jet apparatus can be
used to pump a jet of electrolyte onto both sides of the
dimpled disk, as shown schematically in Figure 10.8B. A
laser beam or light sensor detects transparency and a
warning sound is given. At the warning, the electrolyte
flow must be cut off immediately to prevent loss of thin
area and the disk must be rapidly extracted from the
electrolyte and washed in solvent to remove any residual
film of electrolyte which may etch the surface.
</p>
<p>Undoubtedly you get better at electropolishing with
practice, but reproducing the correct conditions of tem-
perature, electrolyte solution chemistry, stirring rate,
applied voltage, polishing current, etc., can only be
achieved through trial and error.
</p>
<p>10.4.B Ion Milling
</p>
<p>Ion milling involves bombarding your delicate thin
TEM specimen with energetic ions or neutral atoms
and sputtering material from your film until it is thin
enough to be studied in the TEM. A schematic diagram
and a commercial model are shown in Figure 10.9.
The variables which you control include the voltage,

</p>

in the gem industry. It just looked different.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>temperature of the specimen (e.g., cold milling (liquid
N2)), the nature of the ion (Ar, He, or a reactive ion
(iodine)) and the geometry (the angle of incidence).
</p>
<p>An accelerating voltage of 4&ndash;6 keV is usually used.
The ion beamwill always penetrate the specimen to some
extent, so we minimize this by inclining the incident ion
beam to the surface of the specimen. In the past, we often
aligned the ion beam at an angle of 15&ndash;258 to the sur-
face. However, Barna has shown that this angle of
incidence should be avoided in many cases since it
leads to compositional thinning; use an inclination of
�58 to avoid preferential thinning and minimize ion
implantation. Some implantation will occur so that the
chemistry of the near-surface region is changed and the
</p>
<p>material is physically damaged (the top layer is often
amorphized). If you use a low angle of incidence (&lt; 58),
you&rsquo;ll deposit the energy of the ion beam in a region
close to the surface of the specimen. A lower beam
energy or a lower Z ion will also do less damage, but
in both cases milling time will increase (Figure 10.10).
In principle, you could also control the vacuum around
the sample.
</p>
<p>One thing you must remember is that ion thinning is
closely related to ion-beam deposition. One manufac-
turer uses a similar arrangement to coat samples for
SEM. The result is that material removed from one

initial surface topology, initial chemistry, initial
orientation, initial crystallography of the surface,
beam energy, and beam profile. Note the word initial.

<p>part of the sample can easily be redeposited elsewhere
on the sample.
</p>
<p>The theory of ion milling is complex. We can define
the sputtering yield to be the number of atoms ejected
per incident ion; the yield depends on the mass of the
incoming ion. The yield also depends on the ion used
and the sample being milled. The principal variables are

<p>&amp; The ion: mass, energy, charge, and angle of incidence

<p>Ar is used because it is inert, heavy, and not naturally
present in most samples. Special applications may use
reactive iodine, or add oxygen, etc.; this idea of reactive-

sing. The problem is that the reactive ion may contam-
inate or corrode your thinning device, the diffusion
pumps, etc. Heavy ions give less penetration, but create
more damage.
</p>
<p>Most of the thinning parameters are generally fixed
except the ion energy, the angle of incidence and any
rotation, and the temperature of the specimen. A typi-
cal approach is to start with rapid thinning conditions
(heavy ions, high incidence angle) and slow the thin-
ning rate as perforation approaches. The effect of inci-
dence angle on the thinning process is shown in Figure
10.10. Cooling the specimen is recommended for
almost all materials; otherwise, it is possible that the
ion beam might heat it to 2008C or higher. Even in
metals which have good thermal conductivity, the crea-
tion of vacancies through ion damage can cause diffu-
sional changes equivalent to heat treatment at such
temperatures.
</p>
<p>You may encounter discussions of whether to use
ions or neutral atoms; one idea is that neutralized ions
should not be affected by charging of a non-conducting
specimen. It is not clear that neutral atoms remain
neutral throughout the thinning process so this may be
a moot point.
</p>
<p>Ion milling is the most versatile thinning process,
being used for ceramics, composites, polyphase semi-
conductors and alloys, and many cross section speci-
mens. In addition, fibers and powders, which constitute
a wide range of important materials, can also be thinned
by ion milling. To do this, you have to first embed the
particles or fibers in epoxy and transfer the mixture into
a 3-mm brass tube for strength. The next step is to saw
the tube/epoxy mixture into 3-mm disks and finally
dimple and ion mill to electron transparency, as shown
in Figure 10.11. A similar method (but without the brass
tube) can be used prior to ultramicrotomy of powders
and fibers (see Section 10.6.B).

best illustrate this. Goodhew reports that Ar bubbles

foration approaches.

<p>form in silicon at a depth of �10 nm after 5-keV thin-
ning. Elemental analysis (XEDS) of some b-aluminas
which had the correct structure by HRTEM (composi-
tion K2O �11Al2O3) gave a composition with the K
completely replaced by Ar. Glasses and zeolites can
also accommodate large amounts of Ar. Cooling the
specimen can often reduce contamination and surface
damage. It is best to use two ions guns. If this is not
acceptable, because you want to study the surface
region, then you may want to coat one side with a
polymer-protective lacquer and then dissolve this coat-
ing after thinning to remove sputtered material.
</p>
<p>Why Rotate and Cool the Specimen? The specimen is
usually rotated (at a few rpm) during thinning, other-
wise you tend to get surface structure&mdash;grooves which
run in certain directions; if you see these, check to see
that the rotation has not stopped. In the preparation of
cross-section specimens, you may use beam blockers
and rotation control. In the first, you physically block
the sample to shield it in certain directions from the ion
beam so that it cannot thin, say an interface, preferen-
tially. In the second, you vary the rate at which you
rotate the sample to achieve the same effect. The latter
is preferred if it is available since the time spent thinning
the specimen is maximized.
</p>
<p>Why cool the specimen? You can minimize atom
migration in or on the specimen. We noted above that
the specimen might be heated to &gt;2008C otherwise. An
additional advantage is that the cooling system also
cools the surroundings to give a contribution of cryo-
pumping and simple cryotrapping. However, you have
to give the specimen time to warm up after milling which
can increase preparation times.
</p>
<p>Tilting the Specimen This depends on your ion miller
but if you&rsquo;re choosing a new machine there may be an
advantage in tilting the gun rather than the specimen. If
</p>
<p>the specimen is inclined, then you need a clamping ring
and you may sputter this when you thin the specimen.
This has led to the development of ion polishing instru-
ments (see later) where the ion thinner has been opti-
mized to provide a low angle without a retaining clamp.
The specimen rests on a support and can be thinned at
an angle of 4&ndash;58.
</p>
<p>Practical Design of the Ion Miller The schematic
diagram in Figure 10.9 doesn&rsquo;t do justice to a modern
ion miller which is a highly sophisticated piece of equip-
ment. Two ion guns are available to thin from each side.
The operating vacuum is &lt; 10�3 Pa without Ar and
10&ndash;10�1 Pa when Ar is bled into the gun. The ion guns
are basically hollow chambers into which the Ar is
introduced; then it is ionized and accelerated through
a hole in the cathode. The hole gradually enlarges due to
ion sputtering and cathodes need replacing after some
time to maintain a high-intensity ion beam. More
advanced gun designs incorporate saddle fields to
focus the ion beam at the specimen and increase the
thinning rate. The beam can be neutralized in some
systems if the charged ions cause too much damage.
</p>
<p>Some special phrases you&rsquo;ll encounter
</p>
<p>&amp; Reactive ionmilling. The classic example is the use of
iodine in the work described by Cullis and Chew.
Iodine has a clear advantage for InP where the for-
mation of In islands under Ar thinning is suppressed.
In CdTe only growth defects were observed in
iodine-thinned specimens, but many other defects
were found in the same material thinned using Ar
ions (Figure 10.12).
</p>
<p>&amp; Beam blockers and variable rotation speeds. Often
the epoxy in a cross-section specimen thins faster
than the specimen. Therefore we want to direct the
ion beam at the different materials for different
amounts of time. The two approaches used are
blocking the beam geometrically using &lsquo;beam block-
ers&rsquo; or varying the rotation velocity; e.g., you don&rsquo;t
want the beam to thin along the interface. The latter
approach can be extended further to oscillate the
specimen, always keeping the ion beam at the same
angle of incidence, so that it is never parallel to the
interface.
</p>
<p>&amp; Low-angle, low-energy ion mills. Examples include
the PIPS (Gatan&rsquo;s precision ion polishing system)
and Baltec&rsquo;s Gentle Mill. These ion mills combine
high-powered ion guns and a low angle of incidence
(48) to thin one side of a specimen with minimum
surface damage and heating. The low incidence
angle removes any surface roughness and differen-
tial thinning problems, while the high-power guns
ensure reasonable thinning rates. The Gentle Mill
can even be used to thin FIBbed specimens (when
not on a C foil) (see Section 10.7).

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Some final points to remember
</p>
<p>&amp; Materials thin at different rates. It&rsquo;s a good idea for
the person responsible for the ionmillers to run a test
specimen periodically with nominally the same con-
ditions, to be sure that the machine is still working
optimally.
</p>
<p>&amp; Don&rsquo;t start with a thick sample. Always make the sur-
face as smooth as possible before beginning to ion thin.
</p>
<p>&amp; Keep a record of what conditions you use: record
the beam current, angle of incidence, rotation rate,
and kV.
</p>
<p>&amp; Ion milling will form a layer on one surface or both
which will probably be a combination of amor-
phous, highly damaged, and implanted material!
The chemistry of the layer will differ from the rest
of the specimen. The thickness of crystalline material
will thus be less than the total thickness.
</p>
<p>10.5 CROSS-SECTION SPECIMENS
</p>
<p>The cross-section specimen is a special type of self-sup-
porting disk. You must master this preparation tech-
nique if you are studying interfaces. We have often
stressed that one of the principal limitations of the
TEM is its insensitivity to variations in the structure
and chemistry of the specimen in the direction of the
electron beam. Therefore, if we are to look at structural
and chemical variations close to an interface we have to
prepare specimens in which the interface is parallel to the
electron beam and this involves cross sectioning the
sample. The most widely studied cross-section samples
are semiconductor devices which often have multiple
layers and therefore have multiple interfaces. But any
composite materials, samples with surface layers (e.g.,
oxide-metal interfaces), MBE specimens, quantum-well
heterostructures, etc., are candidates for this type of
preparation.
</p>
<p>There are numerous techniques for preparing cross-
section specimens.Manydetails are reported in fourMRS
proceedings so we&rsquo;ll only describe a few basic principles.
First, rather than trying to thin one interface only, the
sample can be cut and glued together to produce several
layers, rather like a club sandwich. Then the sandwich is
sectioned such that we can see the layers, as shown sche-
matically in Figure 10.13. In this process, a critical step is
the gluing of the sections to form the sandwich. Several
epoxies are available that cure at low temperatures, so that
you won&rsquo;t heat treat the specimen inadvertently. The
thickness of the epoxy layer must be such that it is thick
enough for good adhesion, but not so thick that it is
completely thinned away during final ion milling.
</p>
<p>You can then cut the glued sections into 3-mm rods
using an ultrasonic drill. Alternatively, you can cut the

</p>
<p>inexpensive material so that they are wider than the slot in the grid. The
</p>
<p>&lsquo;club&rsquo; sandwich is then itself glued to the grid (over the slot) and ionmilled
</p>
<p>to perforation.

<p>samples smaller and encase them in a 3-mm thin-walled
tube. Section the filled tube into disks which you can
then ion thin. The advantage of this method is that the
final specimen has a thick ring of the tubemetal around
it, which gives it mechanical stability. With multiple
interfaces the final thinning is almost always guaran-
teed to produce electron transparency at a useful
region.
</p>
<p>10.6 SPECIMENS ON GRIDS/WASHERS
</p>
<p>The alternative to self-supporting disks is to make small
electron-transparent portions of the specimen or create
particles and support them on a thin film on a grid or
washer. We can deposit these small particles on amor-
phous or crystalline films. The classic example is the
amorphous carbon film (the holey carbon film), but
this is not always the best choice. Some of the particles
of the material of interest will be located partially over a
hole so that they do not overlap anything else.
</p>
<p>The thin supporting film should have a uniform
thickness; the idea is that you are not actually interested
in this material and therefore want to minimize its effect
on the image of the material you are interested in.
</p>
<p>The particles may stick to the film or may have to be
clamped between two grids. Special hinged &lsquo;oyster&rsquo; grids
(see Figure 10.3) are available which make this very
easy. Some of the processes we&rsquo;ve already discussed
can be used to make these specimens.
</p>
<p>10.6.A Electropolishing&mdash;The Window Method
for Metals and Alloys
</p>
<p>Electropolishing is an application of electrochemistry
and is regarded by many as a &lsquo;black art&rsquo;: a recipe which
works one day but might not work the next. We can
electropolish a thin sheet of metal. First cut the sheet into
a square �10 mm on the side, then seal the edges with a
polymer lacquer to prevent preferential attack. The &lsquo;win-
dow&rsquo; of exposed metal is immersed in electrolyte (usually
cooled to slow the rate of dissolution), surrounded by a
cathode and a voltage is applied, as in Figure 10.14A.
The solution may or may not be stirred. The correct
voltage will ensure that a viscous layer of electrolyte
builds up at the surface of the specimen which results in
uniform controlled thinning without pitting or corro-
sion. After some time, which you have to determine
experimentally, the sheet is removed, cleaned, and turned
through 1808 and replaced in the bath as shown schemat-
ically in Figure 10.14B. If this procedure is done cor-
rectly (and this might require several rotations) the sheet
will finally thin in the center. If final thinning occurs too
near the top of the sheet, the edge of the perforation is
smooth and relatively thick. After perforation, remove
the sheet and cut off slivers of material from around the
</p>
<p>perforation using a scalpel under an inert solvent such as
ethanol. Catch the floating slivers on oyster grids, dry
them and they are ready for viewing.
</p>
<p>10.6.B Ultramicrotomy
</p>
<p>The microtome has long been used for sectioning bio-
logical materials. A tome is a &lsquo;piece cut off&rsquo; so a micro-
tome refers to the instrument used to cut a very thin
tome (not like the one you&rsquo;re reading). With care and

<p>is probably too thick.

<p>much practice the biologist can reconstruct a 3D pic-
ture of the specimen. For visible-light microscopy the
specimens are usually &lt;0.1 mm thick; for the TEM the
slices may be &lt;100 nm thick and the instrument is
known as an ultramicrotome. These instruments are
routinely used for biological samples or for polymers
where the samples tend to be quite soft. More recently,
they have been used for many studies of crystalline
materials. The principal advantages of the technique
are that it leaves the chemistry unchanged and is thus
ideal for AEM specimens, and you can use it to create
uniform thin films of multiphase material. The main
disadvantage, of course, is that it fractures and/or
deforms the samples and therefore is most useful in
cases where the defect structure is of secondary (i.e.,
zero) importance.
</p>
<p>The ultramicrotome operates by moving the speci-
men past a knife blade. The blade can be glass (cheap)
for soft materials but will be diamond for harder ones.
Since there are so many possible applications, we will
describe a few and refer to the references at the end of
the chapter for more details. Two processes can occur in
principle: the knife can cut a soft sample or it can cause a
partly controlled fracture in a hard/brittle sample. In
either case the limiting process is usually plastic defor-
mation of the sample. The principles of this technique
are shown in Figure 10.15.
</p>
<p>You may also find ultramicrotomy useful if you want
to study particles or fibers which are too small to thin
individually but are too large to be electron transparent.
You can embed the sample as we saw for the ion-thinned
particles but without using the metal sheath (see
Figure 10.11). We also use epoxy if the sample contains
so many interconnected pores that it cannot be thinned
mechanically. For porous materials, place the sample in a
vacuum chamber, pump out the chamber, and coat the
sample with epoxy using a dropper in the chamber.When
the sample is fully encapsulated, admit air to the chamber
so as to push the epoxy into the pores. After curing, you
can ultramicrotome the sample in the usual way.
</p>
<p>10.6.C Grinding and Crushing
</p>
<p>Many brittle materials such as ceramics and minerals
are most easily prepared by crushing in a clean pestle
and mortar (preferably in an inert liquid). The liquid
containing the particles can then be ultrasonically stir-
red and allowed to settle. Particles suitable for TEM are
too small to be seen by eye and the supernatant liquid in
which they remain should appear clear. A drop of this
liquid, if placed on a holey carbon film on a grid, will
evaporate in a dry environment, leaving a distribution
of the particles on the support film. If the particles
have to be crushed dry, then agglomeration can be a
problem. Electrostatic forces sometimes cause small
particles to clump together and distributing them on a
</p>
<p>grid can be very difficult. In these cases, it sometimes
pays to mix up the crushed material in an epoxy, then
ultramicrotome the epoxy, as we just described in the
previous section.
</p>
<p>We can collect dust particles found in airborne
pollution by simply exposing a support film (on a
grid) to the atmosphere for a period of time. Inter-
stellar dust can be sampled from a spacecraft or a
high-flying plane.
</p>
<p>10.6.D Replication and Extraction

preparation techniques. We use direct replication to

<p>study fracture surfaces or surface topography in gen-
eral. Evaporate a carbon film on the surface of interest,
then etch away the underlying surface with an acid so
that the carbon film floats off. If you coat this film with a
heavy metal at an oblique angle, you will thus produce a
sample that shows enhanced mass-thickness contrast
(see Chapter 22); support the film on a grid for observa-
tion. As an alternative (Figure 10.16A) you can first
replicate the surface by softening a plastic, pressing it
on the surface, and allowing it to harden. Pull off the
plastic replica, coat it with carbon, then dissolve the
plastic with a suitable solvent, and pick up the carbon
replica on a support grid. If the carbon replica is
produced directly from a metal surface, it may be neces-
sary to dissolve some of the metal with acid then float off
the carbon onto distilled water before picking up on a
grid, as shown in Figure 10.16B. After picking up on a
grid it may be useful to coat the replica obliquely with a
heavy metal to enhance any topographic (thickness)
contrast.
</p>
<p>Extraction replication has seen a resurgence of inter-
est since AEM techniques appeared, because we can
extract a particle from its surrounding matrix, thus
</p>
<p>allowing us to analyze that phase alone without inter-
ference from electron scattering into the matrix.
</p>
<p>The various steps for extraction are shown in
Figure 10.17A. The sample is polished metallographi-
cally to expose the particles on the surface. An appro-
priate etching process is used to remove the
matrix such that the particles stand proud of the
surface. A carbon film is evaporated onto the surface
and scored into �2 mm squares. Then the etching is
continued. As the matrix is dissolved, the squares of
carbon film float to the surface carrying the particles
with them. Catch one of these squares on a grid and
you have your specimen ready for the TEM as shown
in Figure 10.17B. Again, oblique shadowing may be
useful to enhance image contrast, but not if you plan
to use AEM.

<p>10.6.E Cleaving and the SACT
</p>
<p>Cleaving is one of the oldest techniques and has been
used to make thin specimens of graphite, mica, and
other layer materials that are weakly bonded along
one plane. The classical idea is to attach adhesive
tape to both sides of the sample and then pull the
two pieces of tape apart. This process is repeated
until the specimen is thin enough for TEM. You can
really only tell this by experience: as it becomes thin-
ner, graphite becomes a lighter shade of gray in trans-
mitted visible light. Molybdenite (MoS2) becomes a
lighter shade of green as illustrated in Figure 10.18.
Place the tape with the thin flake of material in a
solvent to dissolve the glue (all traces of glue must
be removed). This technique is not as easy as it once
was. The glues used to be readily soluble in trichlor-
ethylene which is now a known carcinogen.
</p>
<p>A special variation on cleaving, known as the
small-angle cleaving technique (SACT), is illustrated in
Figure 10.19. The idea is to propagate a crack through
the sample along a plane that is not a natural (crystal-
lographic) fracture plane and then create another
crack that is shallowly inclined to the first fracture sur-
face. The technique can be applied to crystalline samples
such as Si coated with thin films or to coated glass
samples (as shown in Figure 10.19) that have no pre-
ferred fracture plane. In the case of glass, this is parti-
cularly attractive since the only alternative is ion milling
which tends to implant argon into the open structure of
the glass and is thus not suitable for AEM specimens.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.19A shows a sample that has been scribed
with several parallel lines. Each of the rectangular sam-
ples can then be fractured again by pressing on it with a
stylus to produce a sharply wedged specimen. With luck,
the resulting sample is electron transparent as seen in
Figure 10.19D where a small particle of NaCl is imaged
</p>
<p>between a glass substrate and a coating layer. Although
it is a hit-and-miss technique, you can make so many
specimens in one sitting that a hit is assured (with lots
of practice). You can then put this sample into the FIB
and produce an even better sample without spending
too much FIB time (money).
</p>
<p>10.6.F The 908 Wedge
</p>
<p>The 908-wedge specimen was developed because many
compound semiconductors such as GaAs are grown with
a (001) surface and can be easily cleaved on the (110) and
(1�10) planes that are perpendicular to this growth sur-
face. When you are practiced at cleaving the sample as
shown inFigure 10.20, you can examine a specimen in the
TEM within 30 minutes of completing the growth.
</p>
<p>Mount the specimen as shown in the figure, prefer-
ably so that you won&rsquo;t need to tilt it in the microscope.
Although the specimen is only transparent close to the
edge of the &lsquo;hole,&rsquo; you will have a long strip of material
suitable for viewing. As always, beware of artifacts. If
your specimen is perfect, you will know exactly how
</p>
<p>SACT
The small-angle cleaving technique is invaluable for
films on Si or glass where there is no crystal structure;
making the 908 wedge would be a LACT!

find this wedge useful when we discuss image contrast in
Part 3.
</p>
<p>10.6.G Lithography
</p>
<p>Here we use a technique developed for advanced engi-
neering applications. Lithography is used in the micro-
electronics industry to define fine lines of width down to
100 nm. An illustration of how lithography can be used
specifically to prepare TEM specimens (as opposed to
</p>
<p>generating a structure whichmight best be characterized
by TEM) is shown in Figure 10.21.We can draw lines on
the layered material using standard lithographic tech-
niques. Material on either side of the lines is then
removed by etching (chemical or ion) to give a plateau
which is thin in one direction. We then remove most of
the remaining substrate and attach the specimen to a
support washer. We can then observe the specimen
directly in the TEM. Although the width (formerly
height) of the electron-transparent region is narrow it
can extend across the entire hole in the 3-mm disk. The
major disadvantages or limitations of the technique are
(i) the dimension in the direction of the electron beam is
fixed by the lithographic capabilities and (ii) tilting the
specimen may quickly cause the thicker region to block
the electron beam.
</p>
<p>10.6.H Preferential Chemical Etching
</p>
<p>The principle behind this technique is the same as for
lithography: we remove part of the sample to leave an
area which is electron transparent. The trick is to keep
part of the final specimen thick enough for handling, or
ideally for supporting, the specimen. Naturally, this
approach only works with certain materials although
the principle might be extended to other thin films. The
technique has been used for III&ndash;V compounds where
Al1�xGaxAs acts as an etch stop for GaAs and for
Si where an etch stop can be produced by implanting
with boron (Figure 10.22). In both cases, the resulting
thin layers may be used as substrate materials for thin-
film studies rather than as the subject of study in their
own right. An extreme example of this approach is the
use of thin films of Si3N4 as an &lsquo;etch stop&rsquo; so that a
uniform layer of amorphous Si3N4 remains across
the window. Such specimen supports are com-
mercially available; diamond films can be made in a
similar way.

<p>10.7 FIB
</p>
<p>The focused-ion beam (FIB) instrument is becoming
much more readily available as prices moderate and
their value is realized; however, a FEG-equipped FIB
can still cost more than your TEM. We deal with FIB
more extensively in the companion text but include a
summary here because you must know about it even if
you can&rsquo;t get access to one yet.
</p>
<p>When preparing TEM specimens we can think of the
FIB essentially as an SEM with a built-in ion mill.
(Sometimes it&rsquo;s an ion gun with an SEM attachment.)
The single ion gun produces a well-controlled beam of
Ga ions (rather than Ar used in the ion mill). In the
simplest (cheaper) design the ion beam also acts as
the electron beam of the SEM with the secondary elec-
trons being used to form the &lsquo;SEM&rsquo; image of the sample.
A schematic of the FIB is given in Figure 10.23. The
various stages in the preparation process are shown in
Figure 10.24. The pad in (A) is the coating of Pt. The
two Xs, to mark the region of interest, have been drawn
on the sample using the ion beam, and another Pt strap
</p>
<p>is deposited between them (B). Next, two staircases are
cut out on either side to leave the thin wall shown in (C)
and (D). In (E) the &lsquo;wall&rsquo; has been trimmed away at the
sides so that it is only supported at the top. The last step

</p>
<p>layers evident. Etching between the barrier layers, shown in (B), produces
</p>
<p>an undercutting down to the implanted layer which acts as an etch stop,
</p>
<p>producing a uniform layer �10 mm thick. Further thinning with a differ-
</p>
<p>ent solution produces large areas of uniformly thin material (not shown)
</p>

<p>(F) is to ion-polish the thin wall until it is really a thin
TEM specimen and finally attach it to a probe for lift
out or use static electricity to lift it out and place it on a
supporting (usually C) film. Attaching the FIBbed spe-
cimen to a probe is becoming the norm since it allows
the FIBbed specimen to be further cleaned to remove
Ga contamination and/or reduce the thickness further.
An FEI version of the instrument is shown in
Figure 10.25. We&rsquo;ll discuss the details of FIB in the
companion text because not everyone can afford
</p>
<p>to buy a FIB or can afford to use one even if it is
&lsquo;available&rsquo;!
</p>
<p>10.8 STORING SPECIMENS
</p>
<p>The best advice is to look at your specimen as soon as
possible after preparation. If that is not possible, then
keep your specimens under optimum conditions.
Usually this means keeping them dry (water vapor
affects the surface region of most materials), perhaps
in an inert atmosphere (dry nitrogen works well, or a
dry-pumped, oil-free vacuum desiccator) and in an inert
container (a glass petri dish with filter paper).
</p>
<p>The next problem is long-term storage; for periods
up to 1 month, you can use the above procedure. If you
want to keep the specimen longer, your choices can be
more difficult. Don&rsquo;t use gelatin capsules for anything
resembling &lsquo;delicate&rsquo; material. Don&rsquo;t use slotted grid-
holders for anything which might deform (break or
bend) during handling; that rules out self-supporting
ceramics, metals, and semiconductors. Always use
vacuum tweezers to manipulate delicate specimens
(remember safety when using mouth-vacuum tweezers).
Remember, your most important specimen is the one
most likely to break, bend, interact with sharp tweezers,
or jump onto the floor.
</p>
<p>Last, old specimens can be cleaned by ion polishing
or chemical cleaning. This process does thin the speci-
men further so you may lose the area you originally
studied. Ion polishing can also be useful for &lsquo;sectioning&rsquo;
specimens. The &lsquo;safer&rsquo; re-cleaning (or refreshing)
method is to use a plasma cleaner but this can change
your sample.
</p>
<p>If your specimen is a collection of nanoparticles, you
will realize that such particles can be so reactive that
they may have changed before they reach the TEM
even for the first time. You may then have to use tech-
niques that are more familiar to cryo-transfer users,
such as transferring the specimen from the preparation
chamber to the TEM in a controlled environment.
Such a procedure is not routine using conventional
holders.
</p>
<p>10.9 SOME RULES
</p>
<p>We stress once again that youmust knowwhat youwant
to study in your specimen before you begin specimen
preparation. Figure 10.26 is a second flow chart to
summarize the various possible options. Be aware of
the limitations of the method you choose, particularly
the artifacts introduced. Table 10.1 summarizes the
artifacts introduced by various methods.

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Specimen preparation is a craft and there is no substitute for hard work, careful, detailed
experimentation and lots of practice as you seek to master it. This is the most tedious aspect of
all of TEM work but, if you invest the time, your reward will be the best of times on the TEM
itself. The quality of your data is at least directly proportional to the quality of your specimen
(and this relationship is often far stronger than the linear nature just implied). You simply have
to find the method that works best for your particular material. While there are many cook-
books available, the recipes are often too individualized and not to your specific taste.
</p>
<p>There are few rules for specimen preparation except that thinner is usually better,
although such specimens are more prone to artifacts. Think about each step and what it
might do to change the microstructure or microchemistry of your material. Take care to
avoid the physical dangers that are present whenever you use dangerous chemicals, ionizing
radiation, or sharp knives. Be clean, use fresh materials, tidy up after yourself, and apply all
the other lessons that you learned in kindergarten!
</p>
<p>Although all the equipment mentioned here is available commercially, most were
originally developed on a shoestring budget in someone&rsquo;s lab so you can always build
your own electropolisher or even an ion mill. If you are working with brittle materials,
buy or build a tripod polisher and learn how to use it.
</p>
<p>A last reminder: The recipe books listed below are a great source of ideas. New recipes
are appearing all the time. As is often the case in cooking it helps to see an expert chef in
action to realize what is possible. In other words, when you have seen a really good TEM
specimen, you&rsquo;ll know what yours should look like.

<p>Diffraction in TEM
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>This chapter will set the stage for our discussion of imaging using diffraction contrast. Put
simply, diffraction contrast arises because the intensity of the diffr3acted beams is different
in different regions of the specimen. These variations may arise because of changing
diffracting conditions or because of differences in specimen thickness. In our study of
diffraction in the TEM, we will see spots&mdash;lots of them. Sometimes the &lsquo;spots&rsquo; will be
small faint points and other times they will be large disks, which themselves contain
&lsquo;structure&rsquo; and more information. Other patterns will contain lines that we will examine in
Chapters 19&ndash;21.
</p>
<p>We need to know how to use the information that these spot patterns (diffraction
patterns or DPs) contain. We will discuss the practical question of how we can best record
the DPs, so that we can maximize the information they contain, but we will not try to give a
rigorous proof of every equation used. These DPs give direct crystallographic information
about small areas of the specimen. This capability is one of the most important features of
the TEM, because we can relate the crystallography to the images we see.
</p>
<p>In reading this chapter you should remember our discussion of the scattering of waves
using an array of slits (Chapter 2). Much of the analysis is geometrically the same as we
found for visible light&mdash;it&rsquo;s essentially the same physical optics. The big differences are that
we have &lsquo;modulated&rsquo; holes which are located in 3D space and both our wavelengths and the
spacing of the &lsquo;holes&rsquo; are very small.
</p>
<p>A note on history: spot patterns in DPs have always been recorded using a photographic
emulsion but many TEMs no longer have photographic plates. The CCD has a much greater
dynamic range but you may need to record the DP using several different camera lengths.
Plus&mdash;burning a hole in photographic film is one thing, doing the same to theCCD is another.
</p>
<p>11.1 WHY USE DIFFRACTION IN THE TEM?
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin by looking at an experimental DP. The
pattern shown in Figure 11.1, like those we introduced
in Chapter 2, was recorded from a thin specimen, in this
case silicon. The main features to note are there are
many spots and the spots vary in intensity and size
(these are related effects).
</p>
<p>We can list some of the questions you might ask on
first seeing such a DP.
</p>
<p>&amp; What is it?
&amp; What can we learn from it?
&amp; Why do we see it?
&amp; What determines the scale? What determines the dis-
tances between the spots or the positions of the lines?
</p>
<p>What do we want to know about our specimen? To
a materials scientist, perfect crystals are often pretty
</p>
<p>boring and can usually be better studied using such
techniques as X-ray diffraction (for structural charac-
terization), the electron microprobe (for chemical
characterization), etc., although new EM techniques
may change this situation. The TEM is the instrument
of choice when the specimen is not perfect, particularly
when the feature of interest is what makes the material
imperfect or, paradoxically, useful!
</p>
<p>The questions that we can address using DPs
obtained in the TEM include the following
</p>
<p>&amp; Is the specimen crystalline? Crystalline and
amorphous materials have very different properties.
</p>
<p>&amp; If it is crystalline, then what are the crystallographic
characteristics (lattice parameter, symmetry, etc.) of
the specimen?
</p>
<p>&amp; Is the specimen monocrystalline? If not, what is the
grain morphology, how large are the grains, what is
the grain-size distribution, etc.?
</p>
<p>11 .1 WHY U SE D I F FRACT ION IN THE TEM? ....................................................................................................................................... 197</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; What is the orientation of the specimen or of
individual grains with respect to the electron beam?
</p>
<p>&amp; Is more than one phase present in the specimen? If
so, how are they oriented?
</p>
<p>In general, if we see spots then the specimen is at least
partly crystalline. (We&rsquo;ll discuss quasicrystals later.) The
ability to determine crystallographic orientations
locally (down to the nm level) gives TEM its great
advantage over SEM and visible-light microscopes.
Later on we can make this determination even more
precise (to an accuracy of �0.0018) using convergent-
beam patterns, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 21.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we will restrict the discussion to the
geometry of the spot patterns. These are necessarily asso-
ciated with crystalline materials. We&rsquo;ll see that spot patterns
provide a great deal of information themselves; they also
provide the basis for understanding other DPs.Wewill find
that standardDPs which are common to a group ofmateri-
als allow us quickly to recognize particular orientations and
even certain grain boundaries and twin boundaries, etc.,
without having to index the pattern from scratch. For
example, in a particular orientation, all cubic crystals give
the same array of spots although some of the spots may
have no intensity!We will consider the intensity of the spots
in Chapter 12.
</p>
<p>Remember, however, that SADPs patterns are not
always the most useful DPs, since CBED (Chapters 20 and
21) can give you other useful information. Nevertheless, we
are emphasizing SADPs here, since we use them to explain
the contrast in TEM images, in Part III.
</p>
<p>11.2 THE TEM, DIFFRACTION CAMERAS,
AND THE TV
</p>
<p>The use of electron diffraction formaterials studies began
around 1930 using diffraction cameras which very much
resembled X-ray tubes in their physical appearance.
Later on, if you pursue TEM in depth, you will find
many of the earlier texts on electron diffraction useful
for gaining a deeper understanding of TEM. It will be
helpful to bear in mind some of the historical circum-
stances behind these developments when reading some of
these texts. For example, many articles show ray dia-
grams with the optic axis horizontal. One reason for
this is that much of the early theoretical analysis was
developed as an extension of X-ray diffraction (XRD)
or by researchers who were actively using either X-ray or
electron-diffraction cameras. In each case, the optic axis
of the instrument was horizontal as is still the case for
visible-light optical benches. The optic axis of all electron
microscopes is now vertical although the beammay orig-
inate at either the top or the bottom of the column.
Actually, more than one of the early TEMs, e.g., the
Philips EM100, was built with the optic axis horizontal
and the electron beam directed at the observer. This
arrangement is similar to that used for television, but
remember that in TEM we are using very high energy
electrons (�100keV rather than 20keV used in a TV).
References to some of the early texts, and their historical
significance, are given at the end of this chapter. When
you are reading early texts on TEM remember that many
were written at a time when most TEMs operated at
100kV. This fact may easily be overlooked but it affects
many features of diffraction including the camera length.
</p>
<p>We will be talking about positions of spots and not
their intensities for most of the time in this book. This
type of analysis differs from many X-ray studies. The
reason that beam intensities are not measured in TEM
is that the electron beams are diffracted many times in a
typical TEMspecimen. A similar, but not identical, situa-
tion actually occurs when producing powder patterns by
X-ray diffraction (XRD); diffraction then occurs inmany
different grains at the same time. We can compare the
electron-diffraction pattern with that encountered in
XRD. In the X-ray case, if you have a single crystal,
then you either have to rotate the crystal to &lsquo;see&rsquo; all the
beams or use &lsquo;white&rsquo; radiation (i.e., essentially use a range
of wavelengths). Electron diffraction is very different.We
can use a single wavelength and still see many diffracted
beams. The techniques differ also with respect to the time
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>by underfocusing the beam.

<p>it takes to record a DP on a photographic plate; XRD
takes minutes or hours unless you have a synchrotron or
a position-sensitive detector to count every photon, while
electron-diffraction patterns can be recorded in &lt;1 sec-
ond although longer is usually better because it means
you will have &lsquo;spread the beam&rsquo; (made the incident beam
more parallel); for photographic film you&rsquo;ll use several
seconds to a minute or more.
</p>
<p>Much of the discussion of electron diffraction fol-
lows directly from the analysis of XRD. This has advan-
tages and disadvantages, depending on whether or not
you are familiar with XRD. Several references to XRD
are given at the end of the chapter. When considering
diffraction, remember that there are important differ-
ences between electrons and X-rays:
</p>
<p>&amp; Electrons have a much shorter wavelength than the
X-rays commonly encountered in the research lab.
</p>
<p>&amp; Electrons are scattered more strongly because they
interact with both the nucleus and the electrons of
the scattering atoms through Coulomb forces.
</p>
<p>&amp; Electron beams are easily directed because electrons
are charged particles.
</p>
<p>It is particularly important that the electron beam
can be deflected off the optic axis a short distance above
the specimen and then pass through the specimen; this
process of tilting the beam was described in Section
9.1.D. The most obvious effect of this deflection on the
DP is that the whole DP is translated relative to the
viewing screen. The more subtle effect results from the
change in the direction of the incident beamwith respect
to the crystal lattice, as we will discuss in subsequent
chapters.
</p>
<p>11.3 SCATTERING FROM A PLANE
OF ATOMS
</p>
<p>If you go back to Chapter 3 on elastic scattering you&rsquo;ll
see that we introduced the two different ways of think-
ing about diffraction: the Laue conditions and Bragg&rsquo;s
law. In this chapter we&rsquo;ll derive Bragg&rsquo;s law again,
introducing a vector notation that we&rsquo;ll use throughout
the rest of the book. In Chapter 12, we&rsquo;ll do the same
with the Laue conditions.
</p>
<p>The simple diagram in Figure 11.2 shows an initial
wavefront, WI, being scattered by a plane of atoms to
produce a diffracted wavefront, WD. Whether or not
WD corresponds to a diffracted beam will depend on
whether the atoms are scattering in phase, which itself
is determined by the angles between the incident
beam, the diffracted beam, and the diffracting planes.
The conditions for the individual waves being in
phase are known as the Laue conditions, which we
introduced in Section 3.10.B. To analyze the situation
</p>
<p>we first simplify the diagram as shown in Figures 11.3
and 11.4. These figures define the wave-propagation
vectors, which we will refer to simply as the wave
vectors or the k-vectors. We begin by considering
scattering from only two atoms.
</p>
<p>Notice that we are already mixing the concepts of
waves and beams.
</p>
<p>(A) (B) (C)
</p>
<p>FIGURE 11.3. Definition of the scattering vectors: (A) the incident
</p>
<p>wavefront normal is kI, the diffracted wave normal is kD; (B) K is the
</p>
<p>difference vector (= kD &ndash; kI); (C) sin y is defined as K/2KI.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 11.2. Scattering from two planes of atoms. WI and WD are the
</p>
<p>incident and diffracted wavefronts, respectively.
</p>
<p>11 .3 SCATTER ING FROM A PLANE OF ATOMS ...................................................................................................................................... 199</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We&rsquo;ll only consider plane wavefronts, i.e., the wave-
front is flat and k is normal to this wavefront. The
diagrams in Figure 11.3A and B define vectors kI, kD,
and K and gives us the following important equation
(which is just vector addition)
</p>
<p>K &frac14; kD � kI (11:1)
</p>
<p>where kI and kD are the k-vectors of the incident and
diffracted waves, respectively. The vector K is thus the
change in k due to diffraction. An important feature of
this analysis is that this construction can be made for
any kD and thus for any value of K; the angle y shown
here need not be a Bragg angle.
</p>
<p>Following our discussion in Section 3.10.B, we can
always write that
</p>
<p>k1j j &frac14; kDj j &frac14;
1
</p>
<p>l
&frac14; kj j (11:2)
</p>
<p>providing the energy of the electron is unchanged during
diffraction, i.e., the scattering process is elastic. From
Figure 11.3C we can write an expression for y using
simple trigonometry
</p>
<p>sin y &frac14;
Kj j=2
</p>
<p>kIj j
(11:3)
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>Kj j &frac14;
2 sin y
</p>
<p>l
(11:4)
</p>
<p>|K|, like |kI|, has units of nm
&ndash;1 if l is measured in nm.
</p>
<p>K and kI are then referred to as reciprocal-lattice vectors.
Note that this scattering process is taking place inside
the crystal and therefore the k-vectors are all appropri-
ate to the electrons inside the crystal (rather than in the
vacuum).
</p>
<p>If we now extend this argument to consider the inter-
ference between waves scattered from two points (which
you can visualize as being atom sites) then we have the
situation sketched in Figure 11.4. This figure should
remind you of the idea of constructive and destructive
interference which we discussed back in Section 3.10. You
will recognize that the geometry of Figure 11.4 is essentially
a cross section of the two slits used by Young to demon-
strate the wave nature of light (see also Section 2.10). We
can then define two planes P1 and P2 to be normal to the
vectorCBwhich has length d. The distance traveled by ray
R1 is then larger than that traveled by ray R2 by the path
difference AC+CD. Simple geometry shows that
</p>
<p>AC&thorn; CD &frac14; 2d sin y (11:5)
</p>
<p>which is the basis for Bragg&rsquo;s law, as we&rsquo;ll now see.
</p>
<p>11.4 SCATTERING FROM A CRYSTAL
</p>
<p>We introduced the Bragg angle in Figure 3.9 as the most
important scattering angle in TEM; at the Bragg angle
the electron waves interfere constructively. If we now
analyze Figure 11.4 further, we see that when y equals
the Bragg angle, yB, equation 11.4 becomes
</p>
<p>Kj j &frac14;
2 sin yB
</p>
<p>l
(11:6)
</p>
<p>When y is yB, the path difference in equation 11.5 is
nl, where n is any integer, and the equation becomes
</p>
<p>nl &frac14; 2d sin yB (11:7)
</p>
<p>This is Bragg&rsquo;s law (equation 3.21). If n is 1
</p>
<p>2 sin yB &frac14;
l
</p>
<p>d
(11:8)
</p>
<p>but we already know from equation 11.6 that, at the
Bragg angle,
</p>
<p>2 sin yB &frac14; ljKj (11:9)
</p>
<p>FIGURE 11.4. Two beams are scattered from two points, C and B, which
</p>
<p>lie on different planes, P1 and P2. The rays travel different distances giving
</p>
<p>a path difference of AC + CD.
</p>
<p>EQUATION 11.4 IS VERY IMPORTANT
Whenever you see the term sin y/l remember that it is
just K/2 and is thus related to a change in wave
vector.
</p>
<p>200 ................................................................................................................................................................................ D I FFRACT ION IN TEM</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>so when we are at the Bragg angle, the magnitude of the
vector K has a special value, KB,
</p>
<p>KBj j &frac14;
1
</p>
<p>d
(11:10)
</p>
<p>and we define this vector, KB, to be g so that
</p>
<p>KB &frac14; g (11:11)
</p>
<p>This sequence of steps may seem rather pedantic but the
conclusion is extremely important. Bragg&rsquo;s law and the
geometry used to &lsquo;prove&rsquo; it will be used so frequently in
our discussions that it is worthwhile to delve a little into
what it really tells us. Although it is not really a valid
treatment of the phenomenonwe are seeing, Bragg&rsquo;s law
gives us a very useful physical picture of the diffraction
process because the diffracting planes appear to behave
as mirrors for the incident electron beam. Therefore, the
diffracted beams, or the spots in the DP, are often called
&lsquo;reflections&rsquo; and we sometimes refer to the vector g as
the diffraction vector. This derivation is simply geome-
try. In Section 12.3 we will derive the Laue equations
and hence deduce Bragg&rsquo;s law from first principles.
</p>
<p>The reason that this derivation of Bragg&rsquo;s law is not
really valid (it just gives the right answer) is that it really
applies to scattering at a glancing angle where the beam
exits the same surface as it enters, not transmission.
</p>
<p>We mentioned earlier that the angles shown in all of
our figures are exaggerated for the case of diffraction in
the TEM. For example, for 111 planes in Cu, d is 0.21nm;
l is 3.35pm (0.00335nm or 0.0335 Å) for 120-kV elec-
trons; equation 11.8 then gives y = 7.97 mrads (0.468)
for n=1. As a rule of thumb, the Bragg angles of interest
are usually no more than 18 when we are forming images
(although important informationmaybe present inDPs at
much larger, 10&ndash;208, angles). You will find it useful to
remember the order of magnitude of these numbers.
</p>
<p>We can now generalize from single atoms to planes
of atoms. Let&rsquo;s imagine that Figure 11.4 shows two
&lsquo;planes of atoms,&rsquo; P1 and P2, and that the points B and
C are not necessarily atoms but are simply points on
these planes and that d is the shortest distance between
</p>
<p>the two planes. How is the &lsquo;in-phase&rsquo; nature changed if
we move atom B but keep it on plane P2?
</p>
<p>Consider scattering from a single plane as shown in
Figure 11.5. Geometry shows that while ray R1 travels a
distance EJ, ray R2 travels a distance HF and that these
two distances are equal. Thus there is no path difference
for scattering from atoms located anywhere on a partic-
ular plane. This seemingly trivial result means that we
can generalize our conclusions from Figure 11.4.
</p>
<p>This result is summarized in Figure 11.6. Rays R1, R2,
and R3 all scatter in phase if y=yB.
</p>
<p>Next we extend this analysis to includemany parallel
planes each a distance d from its neighbors, as is shown
in Figure 11.7.
</p>
<p>In the special case of Bragg diffraction, the scattering
semiangle between the incident beam and the Bragg-
diffracted beam is twice the Bragg angle (2yB). See
Figure 11.7 and refer back to Section 2.12.DIFFRACTION, NOT REFLECTION
</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget we are really dealing with diffraction,
not reflection, and we derived Bragg&rsquo;s law by con-
sidering just two atoms. We still examine reflections,
but they&rsquo;re not.
</p>
<p>DEGREES AND RADIANS
Remember 10mrads is 0.5738, i.e., about 0.58.
</p>
<p>SCATTERING FROM A PLANE
It does not matter how the atoms (scattering centers)
are distributed on these two planes; the scattering
from any two points on planes P1 and P2will produce
the same path difference 2d sin y.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 11.5. Two beams are scattered from two points, E and F, which
</p>
<p>lie on the same plane P1. This simple diagram shows that the two beams
</p>
<p>travel the same distance since triangles EHF and FJE are congruent.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Bragg reflection, g, is then perpendicular to
the set of planes. Clearly this is just another way of
expressing equation 11.11. Figures 11.2 and 11.7
remind us that Bragg diffraction occurs when K has
the value g.
</p>
<p>11.5 MEANING OF n IN BRAGG&rsquo;S LAW
</p>
<p>As is shown in Figure 11.7, and in the DP in Figure 11.1,
in practice there will not just be one Bragg reflection but a
series of reflections which are periodically spaced along a
line; these are known as a systematic row of reflections,
&ndash;G, 0, G, 2G, 3G, etc., with corresponding diffraction
vectors, g�, 0, g, 2g, 3g, etc.
</p>
<p>Notation: When discussing beams in diffraction pat-
terns, the letter O will refer to the &lsquo;direct&rsquo; beam
which is present even when there is no specimen; the
letter G (not bold&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a vector) will refer to any
single diffracted beam; the number 0 (bold) will refer
to the diffraction vector for beam O (it is a vector of
zero length) and the letter g (always bold to remindus
that it is a vector)will denote the diffraction vector (in
the DP) for beam G. Having said that, many micro-
scopists use G and g interchangeably, so beware.
</p>
<p>These other reflections (ng, where n 6&frac14; 1), called
higher-order reflections, are particularly important in
TEM. Pictorially, you can imagine them as arising
from the interference of electrons scattered from planes
which are a distance nd apart, where n is a rational
fraction. To understand the physical meaning of this
statement, put a plane P3 half way between P1, and P2
as shown in Figure 11.8.
</p>
<p>Now planes P1, P2, and P3 will scatter in phase when

The vector g is pronounced &lsquo;&lsquo;bar g&rsquo;&rsquo; and connects O to

hear g pronounced &lsquo;&lsquo;g bar.&rsquo;&rsquo;

<p>As we noted in the discussion of Figure 11.3, this
scattering from plane P3 will occur no matter how the
atoms (scattering centers) are distributed on this
plane&mdash;even if there are no atoms on the plane! Thus
we will always see g2=2g and similarly g3=3g, etc.
So we can generalize equation 11.12 to be

d
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>sin y &frac14; l (11:15)
</p>
<p>or rewrite this as
</p>
<p>2d sin y &frac14; nl (11:16)
</p>
<p>which gives a physical explanation for the n in
equation 11.7.
</p>
<p>To summarize: electrons are diffracting from a set
of planes of spacing d such that we have both construc-
tive and destructive interference. We can consider n in
equation 11.15 as indicating that electrons are diffract-
ing from a set of planes with spacing d/n rather than d.
This equation can then be applied to planes that are
occupied by different atoms. Although this treatment
is not rigorous, it will prove to be very useful in prac-
tice. The alternative, but equivalent, view is obtained
by considering the Laue equations which we will do
in Chapter 12. You might consider why we don&rsquo;t
have diffraction from planes which are nd apart instead
of d/n.
</p>
<p>11.6 A PICTORIAL INTRODUCTION
TO DYNAMICAL EFFECTS
</p>
<p>Dynamical diffraction traditionally strikes fear into the
heart of the non-mathematician. Unfortunately, in
TEMmost practical imaging situations involve dynam-
ical scattering. The terminology derives from X-ray
theory (where it is not nearly so important). The reason
it is very important in electron diffraction is that the
electron beam interacts so strongly with the atoms in the
crystal. For most purposes, dynamical diffraction can
be thought of in quite a simple manner, as you can see
in Figure 11.9.
</p>
<p>DYNAMICAL DIFFRACTION
The beam, which has been strongly Bragg diffracted
once, is necessarily in the perfect Bragg orientation to
be diffracted back into the direct beam by the same
set of planes.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 11.8. Scattering from three planes with plane P3 positioned
</p>
<p>exactly half way between planes P1 and P2.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 11.9. The beam can be scattered more than once. Any beam
</p>
<p>which is oriented so as to be Bragg scattered once is automatically in the
</p>
<p>ideal orientation to be rescattered. This gives rise to the phenomenon of
</p>
<p>dynamical scattering because the beam can be scattered again and again.
</p>
<p>11 .6 A P I CTOR IAL INTRODUCT ION TO DYNAMICAL EFFECT S ........................................................................................................ 203</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This beam is then said to be a rediffracted beam. The
likelihood of this process occurring will increase as the
thickness of the specimen increases. Clearly, the redif-
fracted beam is also perfectly oriented to be diffracted
again, and so on. The two beams in Figure 11.9 are said
to be dynamically coupled.
</p>
<p>11.7 USE OF INDICES IN DIFFRACTION
PATTERNS
</p>
<p>In Chapter 18 we&rsquo;ll teach you how to indexDPs, i.e., how
to associate a spot in the DP with a diffracting plane in
the specimen. For the time being it will be useful if we just
introduce the conventions, rather than the methods, of
indexing patterns.
</p>
<p>First remember that a particular crystal plane is
defined by the Miller indices (hkl); crystallographically
equivalent (hkl) planes are denoted as the {hkl} planes.
We define the direct beam as the 000 reflection and each
diffracted beam as a reflection with different hkl indices.
It is a crystallographic convention to refer to the diffrac-
tion spot from a specific (hkl) plane, as hkl, i.e., without
the parentheses. If we assign hkl to g, then the second
order (2g) spot is 2h 2k 2l, the 3g spot is 3h 3k 3l, etc.
Similarly, the &ndash;g reflection is hkl. We&rsquo;ll discuss these
points further in Section 12.3.
</p>
<p>Now we can explain why we see so many spots in the
DP. If we look along a zone axis in a crystal, we will see
sets of planes in the edge-on orientation. Remember
that a zone axis is the direction along the intersection
of two or more planes.
</p>
<p>Notation: The zone axis, [UVW], is a direction
which is common to all the planes of the zone. So
[UVW] is perpendicular to the normal to the
plane (hkl) if the plane is in the [UVW] zone.
Later, we will see that [UVW] is defined as the
incident beam direction. This result applies to
all crystal systems and gives the Weiss zone law
hU+kV+lW = 0.
</p>
<p>If there are many planes close to the Bragg orienta-
tion, then we will see spots from many different planes.
We still have not explained why we can see the 200 spot
and the 400 spot in the same pattern: they clearly can&rsquo;t
both satisfy the Bragg condition at the same time. We
see both spots because of the physical shape of the TEM
specimen, as we&rsquo;ll discuss in Chapters 12 and 17.
</p>
<p>11.8 PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF
DIFFRACTION-PATTERN FORMATION
</p>
<p>Remember from Chapter 9, we can form diffraction
patterns in the TEM in two complementary ways,
SAD and CBED patterns.
</p>
<p>SADPs are sharply focused spot patterns that we
use to select reflections for all imaging modes. We can
easily associate the sharp spots with our diffraction
vectors, g.
</p>
<p>CBDPs are arrays of disks. We can associate a g
vector with each disk but the location of g requires
more extensive consideration. For this reason, we&rsquo;ll
delay more detailed discussion of CBDPs while we
develop diffraction theory and then devote Chapters
20 and 21 to the topic, because it is very important.
</p>
<p>11.9 MORE ON SELECTED-AREA
DIFFRACTION PATTERNS
</p>
<p>We discussed how you form a DP in the SAD mode in
Chapter 9. Now we will discuss some of the practical
implications and drawbacks of the method.
</p>
<p>Why do we want to select a specific area to contribute
to the DP? All foils are distorted to some extent so that
diffraction conditions change as we move around the
specimen; hence we need to select areas of constant orien-

<p>maywant to study theDP from a small particle within the
foil. Figure 11.10 is a reminder that the DP is formed at
the back focal plane (BFP) of the objective lens. A similar
diagram was shown in Figure 9.13.
</p>
<p>The SAD method for selecting an area is to place an
aperture in the first image plane below the objective
lens. In this case we really are selecting an area, which
is the area in an image, but we always refer back to the
volume of the diffracting specimen. Since we are work-
ing at an image, plane we do not need to focus the
condenser lens, in fact we generally weaken (underfo-
cus) this lens to give more parallel illumination so that
all the rays are focused at the same plane, i.e., the BFP.
The spots in the DP then become sharper. In practice,
you will generally need to &lsquo;fine-tune&rsquo; the focus of the
DP since its focus depends on the excitation of the
condenser lens.
</p>
<p>The key practical steps in forming an SAD pattern
were described in procedure #4 in Section 9.3.A. The
two key points to remember are (i) be sure that you are
at the eucentric focus position, with an image of the area
of interest focused on the screen and (ii) remember to
focus the DP with the intermediate lens (diffraction
focus).
</p>
<p>Remember that using an aperture to select an area in
the image plane gives an additional advantage: the area
has already been magnified, typically 25�. Thus a 50-mm
diameter aperture will select a 2-mmdiameter area on
the specimen.
</p>
<p>You might ask: why can&rsquo;t we just use a smaller SAD
aperture to select a smaller area? We can provide the
answer by looking at Figure 11.11: the objective lens is
not perfect. As we saw in Chapter 6, the beams which
are farther away from the optic axis are bent more
strongly as they pass through the objective lens. For
rays entering the objective lens at an angle b to the
optic axis, the image formed at magnification M is
translated a distance rM given by
</p>
<p>rM &frac14; MCsb3 (11:17)
</p>
<p>So the area we select using the SAD aperture corre-
sponds to the area PP1 in the object plane only for the
direct beam. The error increases as b increases, so that
it&rsquo;s larger for a larger Bragg angle or for a larger g. The
result is illustrated schematically in Figure 11.12 with
values given in Table 11.1. (Note that we divide rM byM
to give the distance at the specimen.) The values in the
middle column were calculated for a Cs of 3.3mm and
100-keV electrons. If you use a smaller aperture, select-
ing an area of less than 1-mm diameter, even the fourth-
order 111 reflection, i.e., the 444 reflection, from this
area would not contribute to the SADP. Instead, a
different area, possibly even an adjacent crystal, would
contribute.
</p>
<p>We will produce another selection error if the aper-
ture is not located at the image plane. This effect can be

<p>seen clearly in Figure 11.13 where the objective lens is
focused on plane Pf rather than on the specimen. The
effect is seen by simple geometry if you extend the
diffracted rays back to the specimen plane. The dis-
placement at the first image plane (where the SAD
aperture is located) corresponds to a distance y at the
specimen plane where y is given by
</p>
<p>y &frac14; Db (11:18)
</p>
<p>On some older machines, a &lsquo;click&rsquo; on the medium
image focus control (i.e., of the objective lens) corre-
sponded to a change in focus,D of�3 mm.You will still
find onmany TEMs that the aperture in the SAD plane
is not always in focus when the DP is in focus. You
might also consider the implications when we study
very thick specimens. Remember that these two
sources of error may be additive and therefore quite
substantial.
</p>
<p>You may still sometimes want to use an aperture
which conventional wisdom tells you is &lsquo;too small for
SAD.&rsquo; Perhaps the best advice when this is the case is, if
possible, use CBED. However, you should remember
that &lsquo;conventional wisdom&rsquo; is often based on Table 11.1,
which was first calculated by Hirsch et al. in �1963 and
applied to a machine built in the 1950s! A modern
300-kV machine may have a Cs of �1mm and a l (at
300 kV) of 1.968 pm. The values for Csb
</p>
<p>3 then become
much smaller as shown in the right-hand column of
Table 11.1. Clearly you could now use a much smaller
SAD aperture, but 10mm is about the smallest that can
be manufactured.
</p>
<p>One question which is often asked is: if the SAD
aperture is placed at the first image plane, how can it
affect the DPwhich is formed above it? The relationship
between the SAD pattern and the image(s) can be illus-
trated by forming a multiple dark-field image of the
type illustrated in Figure 11.14A. To do this, you must
first form the SAD pattern in the usual way. Then
increase the strength of the intermediate lens so that
it&rsquo;s focused below the BFP in Figure 11.14B. Instead
of a point we then see a disk, because the beam is
convergent at the BFP. To understand what is
</p>
<p>happening we must realize that the magnification of
the specimen at the BFP is zero (i.e., when &lsquo;X&rsquo; in Figure
11.14B is in the BFP plane)! As we increase the strength
of the intermediate lens, staying in diffraction mode, we
increase the magnification of these images (one bright-
field image and many dark-field images). Of course,
these images are not in focus but this can be corrected
by adjusting the strength of the objective lens, which is
just conventional focusing.
</p>
<p>Now you can appreciate directly that each disk cor-
responds to a reflection in the SADP. The reflections
that were bright now correspond to bright disks; the

<p>area was close to the Bragg condition for that reflection.
It is at first surprising to realize that none of the disks is
uniformly bright. Conversely most of the disks are
partly bright! We&rsquo;ll examine the reasons for this varia-
tion in Chapter 13.
</p>
<p>This uncertainty in the area selected to form the
SADPs is one reason that CBDPs can have some
</p>
<p>advantage whenever you want to get crystallographic
information about specific regions of your specimen.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll end with some more practical points.
You can change the detail present in your DP
</p>
<p>simply by changing the C2 lens setting and the expo-
sure time.
</p>
<p>To record the SADP you should never use an expo-
sure of &lt;10 seconds (but you will). You don&rsquo;t need to
use a 1-second exposure to limit drift! If you&rsquo;re inter-
ested in the details in the diffraction pattern you should
take as many as three exposures; on film, youmight use
10, 30 and 100 seconds. So spread the beam with C2
and remove that beam stop (better still, don&rsquo;t use it;
you&rsquo;re damaging your specimen if the beam is that
intense). Correct the astigmatism in the intermediate
lens after you&rsquo;ve spread the beam; this astigmatism
becomes noticeable when your spots are small (not all
microscopes allow you to do this). Focus the spots to
sharp points with the diffraction (intermediate) lens;
now you&rsquo;ve focused the DP. Just for the exercise, focus
the spots in the SADP as you generally view it with the
beam condensed down to a minimum diameter. Now
spread the beamwith C2 and refocus the spots; you will
see quite a difference in how sharp the spots are. Use
the binoculars for focusing the spots after you&rsquo;ve
spread the beam. Unless the pattern is well focused,
you will miss many of the fine details that make SAD
so useful.
</p>
<p>Deciding which pattern is best really depends on
what information you require. If you would like to see
fine detail in your SADP, you will probably need to
underfocus the beam using C2. If the beam of interest
is of low intensity, you may need to increase the expo-
sure time at the risk of broadening the more intense
spots, hence the need to record patterns with a range
of exposures. DPs can be recorded on video or sent
directly to the computer using a video camera. The use
of a CCD camera can give a much greater range of
intensities than the photographic film; this will become
the preferred method of recording DPs in the future.
However, you may have no alternative (i.e., no
darkroom).
</p>
<p>Cooling your specimen can reduce the thermal-
diffuse scattering and thus reduce the background inten-
sity considerably. Changes in the lattice parameter will
not usually be a problem in SAD since we are not
looking for that level of accuracy, but they will be
noticeable in the HOLZ CBDPs (see Chapter 21).
</p>
<p>Finally, if your specimen charges, you&rsquo;ll probably
have to coat it with a thin film of carbon. Do practice
this. Repeat several thin coatings if necessary and be
sure that the charging is not due to your specimen not
contacting the specimen holder or the holder not con-
tacting the ground.

<p>ary) is slightly shifted from the adjacent images, reflecting the increased error
</p>
<p>in area selection for higher-order reflections; (B) formation of a disk occurs
</p>
<p>because a defocused beam is either convergent or divergent at the BFP. An
</p>
<p>underfocused convergent beam is preferred, since it is more parallel than an
</p>

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
DPs are the basis of all image formation in the TEM as well as all crystallographic analysis
and defect characterization. We can understand DPs in terms of Bragg reflection from
planes of atoms in the specimen and we can define the diffraction vector g associated with
each Bragg reflection and associate each gwith a crystal plane hkl. The diffracting planes are
all in a specific zone axisUVW,whichwe can define as parallel to the incident beamdirection.

</p>
<p>Thinking in Reciprocal Space
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, you&rsquo;ve already encountered vectors k and g and seen that they have
lengths with units of nm&ndash;1. These vectors are referred to as reciprocal-lattice vectors. Now
we are going to discuss what this reciprocal lattice is. The reciprocal lattice is simply a lattice
in reciprocal space. Note that this lattice is just as real as the &lsquo;real lattice&rsquo; in &lsquo;real&rsquo; space. It&rsquo;s
like a newworld inGulliver&rsquo;s Travels but the relationship to &lsquo;our&rsquo; world is not a linear scaling
factor but a reciprocal one. If something (an object or a length) is large in real space, then it&rsquo;s
small in reciprocal space.
</p>
<p>When you see an object in real space you need to think, &lsquo;&lsquo;What would it look like in
reciprocal space?&rsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>The reciprocal lattice is a purely geometrical construction. We&rsquo;ll separate the discus-
sion into two parts: (i) the math and (ii) the properties of this lattice. The first is the same as
you will meet in any text on condensed-matter physics; the second relates to how we use
this construction in TEM. What we will find is that the lattice gives us a method for
picturing the geometry of diffraction; it gives us a &lsquo;pictorial representation&rsquo; of diffraction.
It helps us to visualize how DPs will vary as the orientation and physical characteristics of
the specimen vary.
</p>
<p>12.1WHY INTRODUCEANOTHERLATTICE?
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to the field of diffraction, the concept of
reciprocal space may seem a daunting theoretical proposal.
You must persevere. This model gives a physical picture
of diffraction geometries that is extremely helpful to you,
the experimentalist. The best approach is to think of any
crystal as having two lattices. The first describes the arrange-
ment of the unit cells of atoms in the crystal (your specimen).
The second is an array of points which is uniquely defined
for any given crystal but does not correspond to arrays of
atoms; instead, each point is associated with a particular set
of planes in the crystal. Of course, the reciprocal lattice is
just as real as the &lsquo;real&rsquo; lattice; both are simply geometrical
constructions. We&rsquo;ll use the reciprocal lattice to give a
physical picture of what happens when a crystal diffracts.
</p>
<p>In Chapter 11 we showed that Bragg diffraction of
electrons by crystals occurs when K is equal to g. The
reciprocal-lattice concept allows us to define a lattice
where all the lattice points correspond to the possible g
vectors.
</p>
<p>To understand why we use the reciprocal lattice,
remember that we can always write Bragg&rsquo;s law (equa-
tions 11.2 and 11.3) as
</p>
<p>2 sin yB
</p>
<p>l
&frac14; n
</p>
<p>d
&frac14; Kj j (12:1)
</p>
<p>Thus the vector K is reciprocally related to d and vice
versa. Before using this new lattice, however, wemustwork
through its formal definition.
</p>
<p>HISTORICAL NOTE
The reciprocal lattice was rediscovered independently
by Ewald and Laue in 1911&ndash;1914, but it had been
described by Gibbs in 1881 and by Bravais (in a
somewhat less useful form) in 1850! The discussion
in 1962 of Ewald&rsquo;s contribution to the subject is
recommended reading.
</p>
<p>RECIPROCAL
Think of any crystal as having two lattices, one real
and the other reciprocal. In the reciprocal lattice, sets
of parallel (hkl) atomic planes are represented by a
single point located a distance 1/dhkl from the lattice
origin.
</p>
<p>12 .1 WHY INTRODUCE ANOTHER LATTICE?...................................................................................................................................................... 211</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.2 MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION
OF THE RECIPROCAL LATTICE
</p>
<p>In this section we will go through the definition of the
reciprocal-lattice as a mathematical construction and
prove some of the special mathematical properties of
the vector, g. You don&rsquo;t need to learn the proofs but you
will need to know these equations.
</p>
<p>The mathematics of the reciprocal-lattice construc-
tion is simple vector algebra.
</p>
<p>In real space, we can define any lattice vector, rn, by
the equation
</p>
<p>rn &frac14; n1a&thorn; n2b&thorn; n3c (12:2)
</p>
<p>where the vectors a, b, and c are the unit-cell translations
in real space and n1, n2, and n3 are all integers.
</p>
<p>Any reciprocal-lattice vector, r*, can be defined in a
similar manner
</p>
<p>r* &frac14; m1a*&thorn;m2b*&thorn;m3c* (12:3)
</p>
<p>where a *, b*, and c* are the unit-cell translations in
reciprocal space andm1,m2, andm3 are all integers. The
directions of these new vectors are defined by the
relations
</p>
<p>a* � b &frac14; a* � c &frac14; b* � c &frac14; b* � a &frac14; c* � a &frac14; c* � b &frac14; 0 (12:4)
</p>
<p>In words, a* is normal to both b and c, etc.
We define the lengths of these vectors by another set
</p>
<p>of relations
</p>
<p>a* � a &frac14; 1; b* � b &frac14; 1; c* � c &frac14; 1 (12:5)
</p>
<p>Equation 12.5 then uniquely defines the length of the
vector a* in terms of the length of the vector a. There-
fore, these equations give the scale or dimension of the
reciprocal lattice. The product of the projection of a* on
the vector a multiplied by the length of a is unity. Be
careful; this result does not mean that a* is parallel to a
(think about this!). The direction of a* is actually com-
pletely defined by equation 12.4. It is perpendicular to
both b and c and must therefore be the normal to the
plane containing b and c.
</p>
<p>The vector, a*, is always perpendicular to the plane
(100) even when a is not.
</p>
<p>We can see that if a, b, and c are large, then the
corresponding reciprocal-lattice vectors will be small if
we choose conventionally shaped unit cells.
</p>
<p>Since Vc, the volume of the unit cell, is given by
a�b^c, then from equation 12.5 we can write a* as
</p>
<p>a* &frac14; b ^ c
Vc
</p>
<p>(12:6)
</p>
<p>This definition emphasizes that the vector a* is
orthogonal to the vectors b and c. However, just as a,
b and c need not be normal to one another, a*, b*, and
c* are also not necessarily normal to one another. We
use the usual clockwise convention in defining the vec-
tor product in equation 12.6.
</p>
<p>12.3 THE VECTOR g
</p>
<p>We can generalize our definition of g a little more. Any
vector in reciprocal space can be defined as a combina-
tion of the vectors a*, b*, and c*. In particular, we can
write K in a form for use later
</p>
<p>K &frac14; x a*&thorn; Z b*&thorn; z c* (12:7)
</p>
<p>Here x, Z, and z are any three numbers, not necessa-
rily integers. A particularly important reciprocal-lattice
vector is the vector ghkl which is defined as
</p>
<p>ghkl &frac14; ha*&thorn; kb*&thorn; lc* (12:8)
</p>
<p>where h, k, and l are all now integers and together define
the plane (hkl).

You can prove this by taking the dot product ofAB and

and each is normal to ghkl. All that we now have to prove
is that the length of the vector, |ghkl|, is given by (dhkl)

To show this relationship, consider a unit vector, n,
normal to the plane (i.e., parallel to ghkl) and take the
dot product with any unit vector inclined to this plane
(e.g., a/h or b/k).
</p>
<p>The unit vector, n, parallel to g is simply g/|g|. There-
fore, the shortest distance from the origin O to the plane
is the dot product of n with vector OB (or OC, etc.)

<p>&amp; The definition of the (hkl) indices is OA&frac14; a/h; OB&frac14;

</p>
<p>&amp; The plane ABC can then be represented as (hkl).
</p>
<p>We should emphasize a few points before moving on.
</p>
<p>&amp; Remember: the reciprocal lattice is so called because
all lengths are in reciprocal units.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you are familiar with the derivation of band-gap
concepts in elementary solid-state physics, you will
have already used these ideas. The difference is that
the energies of the electrons being produced in the
microscope are �100 keV, whereas those in solids
are �1 eV. This will affect the magnitudes of k but
the a*, etc., will not change with kV.
</p>
<p>&amp; Reciprocal-space notation. We introduced the use
of brackets in Section 11.7. Now we&rsquo;ll extend this
notation to the reciprocal lattice: (hkl) is shorthand
notation for a particular vector in reciprocal space
because it is normal to the (hkl) plane in real space;
{hkl} is then the general form for these reciprocal-
lattice vectors. [UVW] is a particular plane in recip-
rocal space, e.g., it may contain many {hkl} points so
that in real space it would be a direction&mdash;the zone
axis for the {hkl} real-space planes (see Table 12.1).
</p>
<p>When indexing diffraction spots, you will often find
that the brackets have been entirely omitted; this is a
sort of convention. You should use brackets if there
is any ambiguity or for emphasis.
</p>
<p>&amp; In non-cubic material, some special vectors may be
parallel to one another, but most pairs will not be
parallel. This difference can surprise even the experi-
enced microscopist, particularly if you&rsquo;re used to
studying cubic metals. For example, if you orient
the electron beam to be along the [123] zone axis in
an orthorhombic crystal such as olivine, the beam
will not be normal to the (123) plane.
</p>
<p>12.4 THE LAUE EQUATIONS AND THEIR
RELATION TO BRAGG&rsquo;S LAW
</p>
<p>To understand the value of the reciprocal lattice, we will
now reconsider some of the terms we discussed pre-
viously. We use Bragg&rsquo;s law (Section 11.5) because it is
so useful. It gives us a physical picture of the construc-
tive-interference phenomenon, but it does not really cor-
respond to the actual situation in TEM. Our justification
in using Bragg&rsquo;s law is that we can derive it as a special
form of the Laue equations, which really do describe
diffraction in the TEM.
</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll now derive Bragg&rsquo;s law from the Laue equa-
tions using simple vector algebra. For much of our
discussion we assume that the crystal is infinitely large;
we can always take the reciprocal lattice to be infinite.
We can then use intuition to see that constructive inter-
ference will only occur when
</p>
<p>K &frac14; g (12:12)
</p>
<p>FromFigure 12.2 we can see that the magnitude ofK
is always (2 sin y)/l. At the Bragg condition it is also

<p>equal to the magnitude of g, i.e., 1/d. Therefore, at the
Bragg condition we can write
</p>
<p>2 sin y
</p>
<p>l
&frac14; 1
</p>
<p>dhkl
(12:13)
</p>
<p>Hence we can write
</p>
<p>l &frac14; 2d sin y (12:14)
</p>
<p>which is Bragg&rsquo;s law.
Equation 12.12 represents the Laue conditions for
</p>
<p>constructive interference; so we will refer to this as the
condition for Laue, or Bragg, diffraction. Prove for
yourself that g�rn is always an integer, N. Then we can
use equation 12.2 to write the Laue conditions
</p>
<p>K � rn &frac14; N (12:15)
</p>
<p>This equation tells us that we must satisfy certain
conditions on K in order to have Bragg (or Laue)
diffraction.
</p>
<p>Using equation 12.7 and multiplying this dot
product we can see that this equation only holds when
</p>
<p>{n1 x + n2 Z + n3 z} is an integer; K�rn &frac14; N when x, Z,
and z are the integers h, k, and l.
</p>
<p>Note: this is a very special case. By setting rn equal to
the three unit vectors in turn, equation 12.15 gives three
relationships
</p>
<p>K � a &frac14; h (12:16)
</p>
<p>K � b &frac14; k (12:17)
</p>
<p>K � c &frac14; l (12:18)
</p>
<p>Of course, these equations are the same Laue diffrac-
tion conditions which we introduced back in Section
3.10.B, as given in equation 12.15. In Section 11.5 we
quoted Bragg&rsquo;s law, with an &lsquo;n,&rsquo; as
</p>
<p>nl &frac14; 2d sin y (12:19)
</p>
<p>We also discussed the physical reason for n. We can
now treat the same situation mathematically. If the
integers h, k, and l have a common factor then we can
write
</p>
<p>ndnh;nk;nl &frac14; dhkl (12:20)
</p>
<p>So the n is implicit in the d used in equation 12.14.
You will find that there are many other methods for
treating this problem. We have chosen this approach to
emphasize the underlying geometric principles.
</p>
<p>12.5 THE EWALD SPHERE
OF REFLECTION
</p>
<p>The reciprocal lattice is a 3D array of points, each of
which we will now associate with a reciprocal-lattice
rod, or relrod for short, which is centered on the point.
Furthermore, we will arrange each relrod to be normal
to the thin foil, but to have a finite thickness parallel to
this foil normal. This geometry of the relrods holds even
when we tilt the specimen. The fact that we have rods is
the result of the shape of our TEM specimen. At this
stage this is purely an empirical construction to allow us
to explain why we see spots in the DP even when the
Bragg condition is not exactly satisfied.We will examine
the shape of these rods and their origin in Chapter 16.
</p>
<p>We now construct a sphere of radius 1/l. The sphere is
known as the sphere of reflection or generally, and more
simply, the &lsquo;Ewald sphere&rsquo; in honor of its inventor P.P.
Ewald. Due to Ewald&rsquo;s German origins, Ewald is pro-
nounced &lsquo;A. Valt&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;E. Walled.&rsquo; Ewald&rsquo;s paper
which first described the sphere was published in 1913 and
was entitled &lsquo;Contributions to the Theory of Interferences
of X-rays in Crystals.&rsquo; It appears, in translation, in the
monograph edited by Cruickshank et al., along with sev-
eral of his other papers; the articles collected in this review

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>give a wonderful insight into the whole development of
the theory of diffraction.
</p>
<p>The sphere is usually represented in two dimen-
sions by a circle and in most figures is drawn
together with a two-dimensional section through the
reciprocal lattice as shown in Figure 12.3.
</p>
<p>The key point is that when the sphere cuts through
the reciprocal-lattice point the Bragg condition is satis-
fied.When it cuts through a rod you still see a diffraction
spot, even though the Bragg condition is not satisfied.
</p>
<p>We combine the concept of the reciprocal lattice, the
relrods, and the Ewald-sphere construction to picture
how the intensity of each diffracted beam varies as we
tilt the specimen or the electron beam. You may see the
position of a spot in the DP move when the Ewald
sphere is moved relative to the reciprocal lattice.
</p>
<p>We can draw a sphere of radius 1/l in reciprocal space
so that it passes through the origin of the reciprocal lattice,
point O, as defined in Chapter 11. If any point in the
reciprocal lattice intersects the surface of the sphere, the
set of planes corresponding to that point must satisfy the
Bragg equation and hence the planes will diffract strongly.
Equation 12.11 suggests that we define a vector g which
can represent the quantity d�1. The vector has a length and
a direction. We choose the obvious length for g to be d�1
</p>
<p>and make g the only unique vector for the plane (hkl), i.e.,
parallel to the normal to this plane.
</p>
<p>Of course, the diagram drawn in Figure 12.3 shows a
cut through the Ewald sphere. We usually draw such a
diagram to include the vector describing the incident
beam CO but this is not a requirement; in fact it is the
exception, since our diagram is a two-dimensional cut
through a 3D sphere. When we draw such a diagram we
usually choose the plane of the diagram to contain the
</p>
<p>point O, since this point represents the direct beam. A
common cause for confusion concerns the location of
the center of the Ewald sphere, C. The point C is not the
origin; the origin is the point O. In fact C will probably
not coincide with a reciprocal-lattice point.
</p>
<p>Now you can appreciate that it is only when the inci-
dent beam lies in our chosen plane that the vectorCOwill
lie in that plane. For example, we may choose the plane to
be parallel to the optic axis of the microscope but tilt the
incident beam off this axis; in such cases we will still often
be interested in the plane containing both the optic axis
and the incident beam. Also notice that kD could be any
vector which begins at C and ends on the sphere.
</p>
<p>Consider the relative dimensions of dhkl and l. We can
see that forX-rays where l is�0.2nmand 1/l is�5nm�1,
the Ewald sphere can only intersect a small number of
relrods because 1/d is only �3nm�1. This explains why it
is necessary in X-ray diffraction to use white radiation
(giving a wide range of l) or to oscillate, rotate, or powder
the specimen (thus producingmany variations of d and y) in
order to produce enough diffraction spots to analyze the
structure. For 100-keV electrons, however, l is 3.7pm and
1/l is 270nm�1. So the surface of the Ewald sphere is
almost planar (but fortunately, as we will see in Section
12.6, not quite) in comparison with the array of reciprocal-
lattice spots. Therefore, in a TEM, the Bragg condition is
nearly satisfied for many planes and, as we saw in Figure
11.1, many diffraction spots are observed from a thin speci-
men corresponding to a section through the reciprocal
lattice.
</p>
<p>Rather than carry out the exercise of identifying
arrays of spots for every orientation of the specimen, it
is common practice to orient the specimen such that
</p>
<p>FIGURE 12.3. The Ewald sphere of reflection is shown intersecting a
</p>
<p>non-cubic array of reciprocal-lattice points. The vector CO represents kI,
</p>
<p>the wave vector of the incident wave, and O is the origin of the reciprocal
</p>
<p>lattice. kD is any radius vector. When the radius of the sphere is similar to
</p>
<p>the spacing between the points in the reciprocal lattice, as is the case for X-
</p>
<p>rays, the sphere can only intersect a few points.When l is much smaller, as
</p>
<p>for 100-keV electrons, the radius is much larger, the sphere is flatter, and it
</p>
<p>intersects many more points.
</p>
<p>WHERE IS C?
The vector CO is kI and has length 1/l; this defines
where C is located, i.e., we start with O and measure
back to C.
</p>
<p>INTENSITY AND RECIPROCAL SPACE
We can associate an &lsquo;intensity&rsquo; with any position in
reciprocal space, and in particular with any position
along one of these rods.
The value for this intensity is such that if the Ewald
sphere cuts through that point in reciprocal space,
then the diffracted beam, g, will have that intensity.
In general, if the Ewald sphere moves, the intensity
will change. The important idea to keep in mind is
that the reciprocal lattice is just a construction we use
to give us a pictorial way of looking at diffraction.

<p>the beam is incident almost parallel to a low-index zone
(U,V, andW are all small numbers), and then to compare
the observed zone-axis pattern (ZAP) with standard
ones. We&rsquo;ll show you some standard patterns in Chapter
18. This approach is fine if you already know the crystal
structure of your material. However, you&rsquo;ll need to know
the full procedure if you have a material whose structure
you don&rsquo;t knowor if you are not able to rotate it to a low-
index zone axis. This situation might arise, for example,
when you are characterizing a grain boundary.
</p>
<p>12.6 THE EXCITATION ERROR
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll now introduce a new quantity, s, known as the
excitation error or the deviation parameter. Always use
these terms carefully! If the beam is exactly parallel to
any zone axis then, according to the Laue conditions,
there should be no spots in the DP. Clearly there are
many spots (e.g., see Figures 1.6 and 2.13B), so there is
intensity in the diffracted beams even when the Bragg
condition is not exactly satisfied. The actual intensity
will depend on how far we are away from the Bragg
condition. This distance is measured by a vector, s, in
reciprocal space such that
</p>
<p>K &frac14; g&thorn; s (12:21)
</p>
<p>The Ewald sphere intersects the reciprocal-lattice
point at the center of a relrod when s = 0. Equation
12.21 is very imprecise! Although g is well defined, K
is not, because it depends on kD, which could be any
vector terminating on the Ewald sphere. In Figure 12.4,
we show two special values of s by choosing two special
values of kD. In one, kD lies along the vector CG so sc is
also parallel to CD; in the second, sz is chosen to be
parallel to vector CO, the incident-wave vector. A third
special situationwould be to define sm as being perpendic-
ular to the surface of the specimen, but we don&rsquo;t know
where that is. Actually, we will often assume that sm is
perpendicular to OG, but this need not be the case. We
will refer to s in several ways: sg will emphasize that s is
defined for a particular gwhile szwill emphasize that s lies
along the z-axis, which often corresponds to the incident-
beam direction and the foil normal. We write s when we
are not being specific.
</p>
<p>When we drew Figure 12.4, you noticed that we placed
the point G outside the Ewald sphere. Note that we
are using G to emphasize that we are referring to the
point, not the vector, g, from the origin to the point. In
</p>
<p>Figure 12.4, the rowof reciprocal-lattice points is essentially
at 908 to the incident beam. If we take all such rows, we
define a plane of points (only G is shown) which are all at
908 to the incident beam. This plane of points is called the
zero-order Laue zone (ZOLZ). We can now number all
the planes of points which are parallel to the ZOLZbut do
not contain the point O, and call these the higher-order
Laue zones or HOLZ. The first of these (going toward C)
is the FOLZ, the second is the SOLZ, and the rest are just
HOLZ.
</p>
<p>If we now draw the Ewald sphere as shown in
Figure 12.5, you can see that it will intersect points in
the FOLZ and other HOLZ.We&rsquo;ll see examples of these
kinds of DPs in Chapters 20 and 21.
</p>
<p>We can change the value of s in two ways.
</p>
<p>&amp; First, if we tilt the specimen, the row of spots moves
but the Ewald sphere does not.
</p>
<p>&amp; Second, if we tilt the beam above the specimen, the
Ewald spheremoves, becausekI tilts, becauseCmoves!
</p>
<p>FIGURE 12.4. Two special values of s are illustrated. When kD lies along
</p>
<p>CG then sc is parallel to CD. Alternatively, we can choose s to be parallel
</p>
<p>to the incident beam direction CO; then s = sz. and kD becomes k
0
D. In
</p>
<p>each case, kD ends on the Ewald sphere.
</p>
<p>THE VECTOR s
This vector, s, is a measure of how far we deviate
from the exact Bragg condition.
</p>
<p>SIGN CONVENTION
We define the sign of s to be negative when G is
outside the sphere, while s is positive when G is inside
the Ewald sphere.

<p>Convince yourself of this. The DPs with different
values of smay appear identical, but be cautious (more
about this in the next chapter). The difference between
these two processes is shown in Figure 12.6.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll conclude this section by giving you an experi-
mental DP to think about. Figure 12.7 is from a slightly
misoriented twin boundary: all you need to know is that
different grains are diffracting to give two different DPs.
</p>
<p>You can identify a ring of bright spots from each crystal.
The question is: why are the rings displaced from one
another? Yes, you&rsquo;re right, there is much more to this
pattern than first meets the eye, as we&rsquo;ll see in Section 17.3.
</p>
<p>12.7 THIN-FOIL EFFECT AND THE EFFECT
OF ACCELERATING VOLTAGE
</p>
<p>Wewill return to this topic in detail in Chapter 17 after
we&rsquo;ve examined a little more of the underlying theory.
Here, we will briefly remind you that the radius of the
Ewald sphere changes as we change kV. As the kV
increases, the surface of the sphere becomes flatter.
In a way, we were lucky with the initial choice of
100-keV electrons for TEMs since the sphere for
100-keV electrons has a very useful curvature. How
does this curvature affect the DP? Well, we know that
kI�kD=K= gwhere |g| is d�1. Therefore, g does not
change as we change l. Since d does not change but
l does, then Bragg&rsquo;s law tells us that y must
decrease as the kV increases. Therefore, if you keep
the camera length constant, it will appear that the
length of g in the DP decreases as l decreases. Notice
that the key word here is &lsquo;appear.&rsquo; If you look back at

<p>zones (HOLZ) at large angles to the incident-beam direction. If the radius

<p>Section 9.6.B, you&rsquo;ll realize that the problem is that
you must recalibrate the camera length for the new
accelerating voltage.
</p>
<p>The specimen is unchanged so the reciprocal lattice is
the same.However, as the kV increases, the radius of the
Ewald sphere increases and the diffraction spots appear
to move closer together.
</p>
<p>What is very important for TEM is that because l is
small, the radius of the Ewald sphere, l�1, is large and
</p>
<p>hence the Ewald sphere is quite flat. Note that this is
very different from what we find in LEED or a typical
back-reflection Laue X-ray pattern. The result is that
we see many spots in the DP. Some values of the radius
of the Ewald sphere are given in Table 12.2. You&rsquo;ll
find it a useful exercise to generate this table yourself
using a spreadsheet. Use the values from Chapter l:

Nm s and 1eV=1.602�10�19Nm.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
When combined with the Ewald-sphere construction, the reciprocal lattice gives us a very
simple way of thinking about diffraction. When the sphere exactly cuts through a point,
Bragg&rsquo;s law or the Laue equations are exactly satisfied. When the sphere just misses a point,
we define a distance s to quantify this excitation error. In other words, s is a measure of
where we cut the relrod. Ideally you will become as familiar with tilting reciprocal lattices in
space as you are with tilting real lattices in your specimen holder. Remember that the lattices
are rigidly connected to one another: when one turns the other does by exactly the same
amount. Although Lilliput does not exist, reciprocal space does&mdash;at least for the electron
microscopist!
</p>
<p>Keep in mind the geometry and the dimensions.
</p>
<p>&amp; The Ewald sphere has a radius of 1/l and always passes through the point O in the
reciprocal lattice.
</p>
<p>&amp; Reciprocal-lattice dimensions are nm�1 although you&rsquo;ll still see Å�1. Youknow10 Å=1nm;
it&rsquo;s not as easy to remember that 1 Å�1 = 10nm�1.

<p>Diffracted Beams
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>In Chapter 11 we discussed why diffraction occurs; in this chapter we give a more detailed
mathematical treatment. It may be more detailed than you need at this stage. Diffraction is
one of those phenomena that lends itself directly to a detailed mathematical modeling, but
there is a danger: don&rsquo;t become so engrossed in the math that you miss the principles involved;
conversely, don&rsquo;t ignore the subject because it is mathematically daunting! The topic of this
chapter is one which causes major problems for many microscopists. The treatment we will
follow is known as the &lsquo;dynamical theory.&rsquo; Later we will make some gross simplifications,
partly because this is instructive and partly because these simplifications do apply to some
important special cases; the kinematical approximation is one such simplification. Many
other texts begin with the so-called &lsquo;kinematical&rsquo; treatment and then advance to the more
realistic, more general dynamical case. We will not do this but we will introduce the words
and assumptions in Chapter 27.
</p>
<p>The main principle of dynamical scattering was discussed in Chapter 11: an electron
beam can be strongly scattered by a set of planes of atoms. When these planes are suitably
oriented with respect to the beam, they produce a diffracted beam. This diffracted beam can
then be rediffracted by a second set of planes in the same specimen, and so on. The physical
reason for this repeated, or dynamical, diffraction, is that the electron beam and the atoms
in the crystal interact strongly due to Coulomb forces. (X-rays are much less strongly
affected by atoms and are thus more likely to be only scattered once, i.e., kinematical
scattering.) This repeated scattering between the diffracted beams and the direct beam is
the persistent topic of this chapter.
</p>
<p>If you have a strong background in physics, youmay find the simplifications used in this
treatment somewhat unsatisfactory because we should be considering Bloch waves in a
periodic object (our crystalline sample). We will discuss the analysis of Bloch waves in
Chapter 14. Remember that experimentally we will associate arrays of spots in DPs with
Bragg beams. Then we will relate these beams to images.We see both images and &lsquo;beams&rsquo; on
the screen of the TEM.
</p>
<p>In future chapters, we will always discuss the thickness of the specimen in terms of the
extinction distance. This is a term which we introduce here as a characteristic length for a
particular diffracted beam. So, even in a rigorous Bloch-wave analysis, it is still important to
understand the origin of the terminology introduced here (Table 13.1). Remember that the
reason for looking at these equations is that they are directly useful to you when you are
using the microscope, because they describe both the intensity of the electron beam in DPs
and the contrast seen in TEM images of crystalline materials.
</p>
<p>13.1 WHY CALCULATE INTENSITIES?
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will consider only scattering from
perfect, defect-free, crystalline materials.
</p>
<p>Ultimately we want to understand the images we see
in the microscope. The detail we see in these images is
determined by the intensity of the electron beam or
beams and this varies for different positions in the
</p>
<p>image. Our motivation for calculating the intensity of
diffracted beams is, therefore, to understand contrast
features in TEM images.
</p>
<p>In general, the analysis of the intensity of diffracted
beams in the TEM is not simple because a beamwhich is
diffracted once will easily be rediffracted. We call this
repeated diffraction &lsquo;dynamical diffraction.&rsquo; In a perfect
crystal, imagine dividing the crystal into two halves, one
</p>
<p>13 .1 WHY CALCULATE INTENS IT I E S ? .................................................................................................................................................... 221</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>above the other. The upper half diffracts the direct
beam. The lower half further diffracts the direct beam
but also rediffracts the diffracted beam. Don&rsquo;t confuse
this rediffraction with the term &lsquo;double diffraction,&rsquo;
which has a special meaning, described in Chapter 23.
If instead of cutting the specimen into two, you cut the
specimen into many thin slices, you have multiple,
instead of just double, diffraction. We call this effect
dynamical diffraction.
</p>
<p>Because of dynamical diffraction, we cannot use the
intensities of spots in electron DPs (except under very
special conditions such as CBED) for structure determina-
tion, in the way that we use intensities in X-ray patterns.
Actually, a more important practical consideration is that
the intensity of the electron beam varies strongly as the
thickness of the specimen changes; the thickness may
change across distances which are much smaller (as small
as 1.5nm or less) than the lateral dimensions of the elec-
tron beam (typically &gt;1mm in the TEM imaging mode).
As we will see in Chapters 24&ndash;27 when we discuss images,
the beam intensity also changes when lattice defects are
present which is why we can &lsquo;see&rsquo; defects in the TEM.
</p>
<p>13.2 THE APPROACH
</p>
<p>The approach we take here is to develop the basic equa-
tions describing the diffraction process and to identify
parameters which will be important in understanding
the contrast in the image. The different images will then
be discussed in Part 3.
</p>
<p>Inside a crystallinematerial, we should think in terms of
Bloch waves because only certain wave-propagation vec-
tors are allowed in infinite periodic structures: fortunately
you don&rsquo;t need to have a thorough understanding of Bloch
waves to understand contrast features in the microscope.
However, we will consider them in Chapter 14, because a
full understanding of the fundamental principles of dif-
fraction from crystals will require this knowledge. What
we &lsquo;see&rsquo; in a DP relates directly to &lsquo;beams&rsquo; because the
DP,whether in themicroscope or on a print, is outside the
crystal. In this chapter, we will follow the analysis of
</p>
<p>Chapter 11, considering the amplitudes of beams simply
because this gives a good intuitive understanding of the
images&mdash;what we see in the TEM is the intensity, which is
directly related to the amplitude (I / |f|2).
</p>
<p>So, what do we need to calculate? We need to calculate
the intensity of the beam at the exit surface of the speci-
men, e.g., at all points, such as P in Figure 13.1, because
this becomes the &lsquo;image&rsquo; after suitable magnification.
</p>
<p>TABLE 13.1 Terminology and Notation
</p>

<p>f0 The amplitude of the direct beam. Don&rsquo;t use the term &lsquo;transmitted&rsquo; beam; all the beams we are studying are transmitted. Don&rsquo;t call it the

<p>A NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY
In Figure 13.1 we have labeled both the diffracted
beams and the spot in the DP, Gi (i=1, 2, etc.). When
discussing images we will often refer to g1, the diffrac-
tion vector for the beamG1. Then colloquially we will
call g the &lsquo;reflection g&rsquo;; the origin for this terminology
goes back to the diagram for Bragg diffraction: geo-
metrically it looks like &lsquo;reflection.&rsquo;

<p>Before concluding this topic, we will briefly discuss
the approximations we are making. One of the most
important of these is the column approximation,
which is introduced almost without being noticed. It is
not a necessary assumption but it simplifies calculations
and again aids intuitive understanding. You will also
recognize many similarities to visible-light microscopy,
but be wary, there are also many differences.
</p>
<p>13.3 THE AMPLITUDE OF A DIFFRACTED
BEAM
</p>
<p>In the analysis of diffracted beams we will consider only
crystalline materials. Since any crystal can be constructed
by stacking unit cells, we begin by remembering the ampli-
tude scattered by a single unit cell.We can rewrite equation
3.18 so that the amplitude of the electron beam scattered
from a unit cell is
</p>
<p>Acell &frac14;
e2pikr
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>fi&eth;y&THORN;e2piK�r (13:1)
</p>
<p>where the summation is over all i atoms in the unit cell and y
is the angle at which the diffracted beam is traveling relative
to the incident beam.Wehave included the termoutside the
summation because of how the wave propagates; the r�1
</p>
<p>term is present because we have a constant flux of electrons
traveling through an expanding spherical surface, radius r.
The quantities k, K, and r were defined in Chapter 11 and
f(y) is the atomic-scattering factor. You will often see the
sign of the exponent after f(y) reversed. Unfortunately,
there are two conventions! These conventions are discussed
in Section 13.12; we will use the positive convention to be
consistent with most materials-science texts.
</p>
<p>Figure 13.2 reminds us that K=kD� kI. The vec-
tors r and ri are different: r is the distance from a point P
</p>
<p>on the bottom of the specimen to the scattering center
and ri defines the position of an atom in the unit cell.
Remember that fi (y) is the scattering strength for the &lsquo;i &rsquo;
atom (fi (y) is greater for Au than for Al, etc., as we saw in
Figure 3.5). Since we are summing over all the atoms in
the unit cell, we can rename this sum asF(y), the structure
factor of the unit cell. (It&rsquo;s just the scattering factor of the
unit cell.) Notice that F(y) depends on the nature of all
the atoms in the unit cell, their positions, and the direc-
tion in which the beam is propagating (related to K and
hence y). Go back and check Section 3.9.
</p>
<p>Therefore, expression 13.1 can be rewritten as
</p>
<p>Acell &frac14;
e2pik�r
</p>
<p>r
F&eth;y&THORN; (13:2)
</p>
<p>To find the intensity at some point P, we then sum
over all the unit cells in the specimen. For simplicity, we
will not solve this problem mathematically here but
simply quote the result and discuss its meaning. Let&rsquo;s
say we have n unit cells per unit area on a plane parallel
to the crystal surface and a is the distance between these
planes. The volume of a unit cell, Vc, is simply a/n. The
amplitude in a diffracted beam (in the direction identi-
fied by y) is denoted as fg and is given by
</p>
<p>fg &frac14;
pai
</p>
<p>xg
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>e�2piK�rne�2pikD�r (13:3)
</p>
<p>Here rn denotes the position of each unit cell. (Think
about the signs in this equation.) In this analysis, the
quantities f(y) and F(y) both have dimensions of length.
We&rsquo;ll now explain what the length xg means in equation
13.3; it is a length because fg, the scattering amplitude, is
dimensionless (x is pronounced &lsquo;ksi,&rsquo; rhymingwith &lsquo;sigh&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>The derivation of these equations involves some
tricky manipulation which we will return to later.
Some analyses actually make the unrealistic assumption
that the intensity of the direct beam, |f0|
</p>
<p>2, remains
unchanged. This assumption is usually not justified,
especially when the specimen has a finite thickness! If
|fg|
</p>
<p>2 is not zero then |f0|
2 cannot still be 1.
</p>
<p>13.4 THE CHARACTERISTIC LENGTH xg
</p>
<p>At this stage in our analysis it is best to think of the
quantity xg as a &lsquo;characteristic length&rsquo; for the diffraction
vector g so as not to have any preconceived ideas of
what it represents. A detailed analysis shows that the
magnitude of xg can be expressed as
</p>
<p>xg &frac14;
pVc cos yB
</p>
<p>lFg
(13:4)
</p>
<p>where Fg is the F(y) for reflection g (i.e., Fg is a special
value of F(y) when y is the Bragg angle).

<p>correspond to a diffracted beam. (B) shows the relation between the
</p>
<p>radius of the spherical wavefront, r, the position vector of the ith atom,
</p>

<p>13 .4 THE CHARACTER I S T IC LENGTH xg ................................................................................................................................................ 223</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The quantity xg is an extremely important one; it
gives us a way of thinking about nearly all diffraction-
contrast phenomena. It is measured in nanometers (or
Å) and is known as the &lsquo;extinction distance&rsquo; for reasons
that will become obvious.
</p>
<p>From equation 13.4, you can see that the magnitude
of xg is related to Fg (and through Vc to the lattice
parameter) and the wavelength of the electrons, l. If
the structure factor (Fg) is large, xg will be small. There-
fore, xg will be small for Au but large for Si. Fg is large
when the atomic number is large, because the Coulomb
interactions are larger and f(y) is large. Similarly, as the
accelerating voltage is increased, xg, for a particular
material, will increase because the wavelength of the
electrons decreases. Table 13.2 lists some useful extinc-
tion distances (all for 100-keV electrons).
</p>
<p>The effect of the lattice parameter on xg is illu-
strated nicely by comparing values of x111 for diamond,
Si, and Ge: the value for Si is larger than for Ge, as
expected, because of the smaller atomic number but
note that xg for Si is also larger than that for diamond,
which has a lower atomic number! Diamond has a
particularly small lattice parameter, hence there are
more atoms in a given volume.
</p>
<p>13.5 THE HOWIE-WHELAN EQUATIONS
</p>
<p>The direct and diffracted beams are detected outside the
crystal and we see them on the viewing screen. Now we
can think of the wave function inside the crystal as being
</p>
<p>the sum of the beams passing through the crystal. The
direct beam has amplitude f0 (bold 0 to emphasize that
the diffraction vector has zero length) and the ampli-
tudes of the diffracted beams can be written as fg1, fg2,
etc. Each beam has an appropriate phase factor. We
write cT, the total wave function, as a series
</p>
<p>cT &frac14; f0e2piwo�r &thorn; fg1e
2piwG1 �r &thorn; fg2e
</p>
<p>2piwG2 �r &thorn; . . . . . .(13:5)
</p>
<p>where the wave vectors are wO and wD (w (chi) is pro-
nounced &lsquo;kai&rsquo; and rhymes with sky); wO is often written
simply as w. We use wO here to emphasize that it is a
vector which terminates on the point O in reciprocal
space; wG1 terminates on the &lsquo;point&rsquo; G1, etc. At this
stage, we are using wave vectors wO and wD which
describe the wave in the vacuum rather than in the
crystal. We will change to being inside the crystal
shortly. Most of the time, you could write w as k, but
there are occasions when the difference is important so
we start with w and then change over.
</p>
<p>First, we simplify equation 13.5 by considering only
one diffracted beam G, i.e., we make a &lsquo;two-beam
approximation&rsquo; (O is the other beam). This is a very
important approximation, which we&rsquo;ll use often. Two-
beam conditions mean that we tilt the crystal so there is
only one strong diffracted beam (with s = 0). All other
diffracted beams are weak (s &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt; 0), and we
ignore their contribution to fg. Then if the amplitude
fg changes by a small increment as the beam passes
through a thin slice of material which is dz thick we
can write down expressions for the changes in fg and
f0 by using the concept introduced in equation 13.3 but
replacing a by the short distance dz

( )
</p>
<p>dz (13:7)
</p>
<p>Here wO�wD is the change in wave vector as the fg
beam scatters into the f0 beam. Similarly wD�wO is the
change in wave vector as thef0 beam scatters into thefg
beam. Now the difference wO�wD is identical to kO�kD
although the individual terms are not equal. Then
remember that kD�kO (=K) is g + s for the perfect
crystal.
</p>
<p>Youmight wonder whywe have introduced the wave
vector w when it appears to be the same as the k we used
in equation 13.1. The reason is that equation 13.1 is a
very general equation describing scattering from any
group of atoms, but we are now going to consider two
special cases, namely, an electron in the vacuum (wave
vector w) and one in a crystal (wave vector k). Inciden-
tally, the excitation error, s, should really be written as
sg, since it refers to a particular g vector. You can think
</p>
<p>SUMMARIZE xg
xg is the characteristic length for the diffraction vec-
tor g. We call it the extinction distance because of a
property we&rsquo;ll discover later.
</p>
<p>Note that xg is a scalar quantity. xg depends on the
lattice parameters (through Vc), the atomic number
(through Fg), and the kV used (through l).

angle corresponding to a diffraction vector g.

<p>Microscopists usually refer to this pair of equations
as the &lsquo;Howie-Whelan&rsquo; equations after Howie and Whe-
lan (1961), who laid the foundations for understanding
diffraction contrast in the TEM; you may also see them
referred to as the &lsquo;Darwin-Howie-Whelan equations&rsquo;
since Darwin (1914) developed the dynamical theory
for X-rays! Note that we are further simplifying the
expression by writing
</p>
<p>e�2pis�r &frac14; e�2pisz (13:10)
</p>
<p>In doing so, we aremaking the approximation that s and
r are both parallel to z, i.e., at this time, we ignore
components of s that are not parallel to the electron
beam. The approximation may be written as
</p>
<p>sg
�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>� &frac14; sz (13:11)
</p>
<p>We then drop the z subscript; just remember it is still
there. There are situations where the difference can
become important.
</p>
<p>Although this approach is totally phenomenological
(i.e., we haven&rsquo;t really given any physical justification
for the assumptions we have made and actually we
know we should use Bloch waves), you will see that it
provides enormous insight into the interpretation of
your images and DPs. In Chapter 25, we will use these
ideas to understand why we see defects in the TEM.
</p>
<p>The fundamental idea is that, at any given position
in the specimen, the change in the amplitudes of both the
direct beam and the diffracted beam depends on the
amplitude of both beams. The fact that part of the
change in f0 is due to the magnitude of f0 itself, gives
rise to the term forward scattering; remember the origin
of scattering from Section 2.2. Note that scattering from
</p>
<p>fg to fg is also forward scattering, although it takes
place in a different forward direction (i.e., y= yB and
scattering is parallel to kD rather than kO). So forward
scattering does occur but it does not change the direc-
tion of the beam. However, it does have a characteristic
length, x0; this length is another way of saying we have a
refractive-index effect for electrons which we&rsquo;ll address
later in Section 14.4.
</p>
<p>13.6 REFORMULATING THE HOWIE-
WHELAN EQUATIONS
</p>
<p>From here on, the math is quite straightforward. What
we are going to do may seem like a lot of work to derive
one equation (13.48) but the result will allow you to
picture more clearly what is happening. If you don&rsquo;t
want to bother with the math, you can skip to equations
13.47 and 13.48 but you must not miss those two equa-
tions; they are essential for understanding images of
crystalline materials.
</p>
<p>The pair of equations, 13.8 and 13.9, can be simpli-
fied by making the substitutions (i.e., a transformation
of variables)
</p>
<p>f0&eth;sub&THORN; &frac14; f0e
�piz
x0
</p>
<p>(13:12)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>fg&eth;sub&THORN; &frac14; fge
2pisz�piz
</p>
<p>x0 (13:13)
</p>
<p>Then equations 13.8 and 13.9 become
</p>
<p>dfg&eth;sub&THORN;
dz
</p>
<p>&frac14; pi
xg
</p>
<p>f0&eth;sub&THORN; &thorn; 2pisfg&eth;sub&THORN; (13:14)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>df0&eth;sub&THORN;
dz
</p>
<p>&frac14; pi
xg
</p>
<p>fg&eth;sub&THORN; (13:15)
</p>
<p>Since f0 and f0(sub) only differ by a phase factor, we
will ignore the difference in calculating intensities since
only the amplitude is then important; similarly for fg
andfg(sub). The result of our substitution is that we have
removed the phase factor involving x0, i.e., we&rsquo;ve
removed the refractive-index effect. Equations 13.14
and 13.15 can be combined to give the second-order
differential equation for f0
</p>
<p>DIRECT
Remember: don&rsquo;t refer to the direct beam as the
unscattered or the transmitted beam!

<p>We can obtain a similar equation for fg and then

</p>
<p>Note that the only other quantities appearing in this
equation for f0 are z, s, and xg: z and s are geometric
parameters; the nature of the material only enters
through xg.
</p>
<p>13.7 SOLVING THE HOWIE-WHELAN
EQUATIONS
</p>
<p>If we can solve the Howie-Whelan equations, then we
can predict the intensities in the direct and diffracted
beams (i.e., |f0|
</p>
<p>2 and |fg|
2 in the two-beam case). If we
</p>
<p>take it step by step, then we know that solutions to
equation 13.16 (a second-order differential equation in
one variable, f0) must have the form
</p>
<p>f0 &frac14; C0e2pigz (13:17a)
</p>
<p>So we can write that
</p>
<p>df0
dz
</p>
<p>&frac14; 2pigC0e2pigz (13:17b)
and
</p>
<p>d2f0
</p>
<p>dz2
&frac14; �4p2g2C0e2pigz (13:17c)
</p>
<p>What we need to determine is the phase g and the
amplitude C0. Note that since z is a distance in real
space, then g must be a distance in reciprocal space.
Substituting this expression into equation 13.16 shows
that g must be a solution to the algebraic equation
</p>
<p>g2�sg�
x�2g
4
</p>
<p>&frac14; 0 (13:18)
</p>
<p>Now fg is related to f0 through equation 13.15. By
substituting equation 13.17a into equation 13.15 we find
that for each f0, we also have a fg given by
</p>
<p>fg &frac14; 2xggC0e2pigz (13:19)
</p>
<p>To emphasize the similarity to equation 13.17a we
can define
</p>
<p>fg &frac14; Cge2pigz (13:20)
</p>
<p>Then we can see directly that
</p>
<p>Cg
</p>
<p>C0
&frac14; 2xgg (13:21)
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually got this far without solving any equa-

(13:23b)
</p>
<p>We have now found two solutions to the Howie-
Whelan equations.
</p>
<p>There are two different values for f0 and two corre-
sponding values for fg.
</p>
<p>Now we need to understand what these solutions
mean physically. Specifically, what can we learn about
g(1) and g(2) ? Note that they are always real but may be
positive or negative depending on the sign and size of s
and that they are independent of z.
</p>
<p>13.8 THE IMPORTANCE OF g (1) AND g (2)
</p>
<p>Since g(1) and g(2) are solutions of equation 13.18 from
the properties of quadratic equations or by combining
equations 13.23a and b, we know that
</p>
<p>g&eth;1&THORN; &thorn; g&eth;2&THORN; &frac14; s (13:24)
</p>
<p>which is a purely geometric quantity, and
</p>
<p>g&eth;1&THORN; � g&eth;2&THORN; &frac14; � 1
4x2g
</p>
<p>(13:25)
</p>
<p>which is a property of thematerial. Remember that g is a
length in reciprocal space.
</p>
<p>In order tomake the equations easier to workwith, it
is useful to define another quantity, w, which is dimen-
sionless but has the same sign as s.
</p>
<p>w &frac14; sxg (13:26)
</p>
<p>In practical situationswmay vary from 0 to�10.We
can then express the two forms of equation 13.21
(because there are two values of g) in terms of g or,
more conveniently, in terms of w

</p>
<p>(the superscripts on C&eth;1&THORN;g , etc., correspond to the super-
scripts on g(1) and g(2), i.e., the two solutions to the original
quadratic equation). Now it is useful to make another
substitution (or transformation) to simplify these relation-
ships. We define b by
</p>
<p>w &frac14; cot b (13:29)
</p>
<p>Now we can impose a restriction on the absolute
magnitudes of f0 and fg so that they satisfy the
relations
</p>
<p>C
&eth;1&THORN;2
0 &thorn; C&eth;1&THORN;2g &frac14; 1 &frac14; C
</p>
<p>&eth;2&THORN;2
0 &thorn; C&eth;2&THORN;2g (13:30)
</p>
<p>By normalizing these values forC separately for each
value of g, we are restricting the intensity of the beam to
values between 0 and 1 (see below). Then if we substitute
equation 13.29 into equation 13.27 and then into equa-
tion 13.28 we find (using 1�cos b = 2 sin2 (b/2) and
sin b = 2sin(b/2)cos(b/2)) that the C values have the
following simple forms
</p>
<p>C
&eth;1&THORN;
0 &frac14; cos b2 C
</p>
<p>&eth;1&THORN;
g &frac14; � sin b2
</p>
<p>C
&eth;2&THORN;
0 &frac14; sin b2 C
</p>
<p>&eth;2&THORN;
g &frac14; cos b2
</p>
<p>(13:31)
</p>
<p>Now you can understand why we introduced b in
equation 13.29. The two independent solutions to the
reformulated Howie-Whelan equation for f0 (13.16) are
then f0=C0
</p>
<p>(1)exp(2pig(1)z) and f0=C0
(2)exp(2pig(2)z)
</p>
<p>and each value has a corresponding value for fg.
We can already see that the ratio of the amplitudes
</p>
<p>of the diffracted and direct beams, Cg to C0 (and there-
fore the intensities), in equation 13.21 depends on g,
the phase of the wave, and hence on s, the excitation
error. Hence the ratios in equations 13.27 and 13.28
depend on how close the specimen is to the Bragg
orientation. We are particularly concerned about the
Bragg condition because we have chosen a two-beam
situation.
</p>
<p>In the two-beam approximation, equation 13.5 is
expressed in terms of f0 and fg, both of which depend
on g (equation 13.17), so equation 13.5 can then be
written in terms of both values of g (and hence C0
</p>
<p>(1),
C0
</p>
<p>(2), etc.), giving two independent quantities b(1) and
b(2). Either of these two functions could be cT, the total
wave function. Alternatively, the total wave function
could be some combination of them, i.e., part b(1) plus
part b(2). Both of these wave functions are dependent
on r and have their own values of k that we identify
as k(j).
</p>
<p>Each value of g gives a different value of k that we
call k(j).
</p>
<p>Thus we can write expressions for b(1) and b(2).

</p>
<p>&eth;2&THORN;&thorn;g&THORN;�r (13:33)
</p>
<p>Remember: each of these Bloch-wave functions
could be a wave in the crystal&mdash;each one depends on
only one of the k values. In general, the total wave
function will be a combination of these two waves.
We&rsquo;ll return to the important relationship between k
and g in Section 13.9. We use the letter &lsquo;b&rsquo; here because
we&rsquo;ve actually obtained expressions for the Bloch waves
mentioned in Section 13.2, which we&rsquo;ll discuss in the
next chapter.
</p>
<p>13.9 THE TOTAL WAVE AMPLITUDE
</p>
<p>We have now found two different wave functions
which can both propagate in the crystal. We still have
to determine whatf0 andfg are. The total wave vector,
cT, is a combination of the two (Bloch) waves, b(1)
</p>
<p>and b(2)
</p>
<p>cT &frac14; A&eth;1&THORN;b&eth;1&THORN; &thorn; A&eth;2&THORN;b&eth;2&THORN; (13:34)
</p>
<p>where the constants A(1) and A(2) determine the relative
contribution of each (Bloch) wave. We can now com-
bine the last few equations (13.31�13.33 and 13.34) to
give

(13:35)
</p>
<p>All that now remains is to determine the magnitudes
ofA(1) andA (2)whichwe can do by remembering that we
have a thin TEM specimen. In mathematical terminol-
ogy the constants A(1) and A(2) must now be determined
using the boundary conditions.
</p>
<p>It is helpful to rearrange equation 13.35 first
</p>
<p>THE SUBSTITUTION
Because of this simple substitution you can easily
confirm that, for this two-beam situation, the prob-
ability of finding the electron in one beam or the
other remains unity (|cT|2 = 1). Hence the reason
we use a normalized intensity in equation 13.30.

</p>
<p>Only the second term depends on g, so this must be
the fg term. We know that at the top of the specimen (r
= 0), f0 is unity and fg is zero (independent of g)&mdash;the
amplitude of the diffracted beam is zero before it&rsquo;s
diffracted! It follows directly that
</p>
<p>A&eth;1&THORN; &frac14; cosb

</p>
<p>A&eth;2&THORN; &frac14; sinb

</p>
<p>(13:38)
</p>
<p>These equations (13.37 and 13.38) tell us that A in
equation 13.34 is just determined by the value of s, i.e.,
the deviation from the Bragg condition. So you can
adjust the values of A by changing s, which we now
know just involves tilting the specimen.
</p>
<p>Now, finally, we can write down the general expres-
sions forf0 andfg, each as a function of z. First we need
to modify equation 13.5 by using the substitution of
equations 13.12 and 13.13, so it becomes
</p>
<p>cT &frac14; f0e2pi k�r &thorn; fge2pi&eth;k&thorn; g&THORN;�r (13:39)
</p>
<p>(Remember that wD= wO+ g+ s (or kD= kO+ g+ s),
where kO is written as k and D is G1 in equation 13.5;
then you&rsquo;ll see that the term containing s in equation
13.13 drops out.) The f0 and fg components in equa-
tion 13.36 are easily recognized by the presence of
exp(2pig�r). Comparing equations 13.36 and 13.39 (hav-
ing replaced A using equations 13.37 and 13.38) we see
that

</p>
<p>(13:40)
</p>
<p>Since we are only considering the z component, we
know, from equations 13.17 and 13.19, that the expo-
nential term must have the phase 2pigz, i.e.,
</p>
<p>&eth;k&eth;2&THORN; � K&THORN;z &frac14; g&eth;2&THORN; and &eth;k&eth;1&THORN; � K&THORN;z &frac14; g&eth;1&THORN; (13:41)
</p>
<p>What we are interested in is the magnitude of g(1) and g(2).
We can now manipulate equation 13.40 using equa-
</p>
<p>tion 13.41 and the expression eiy=cos y+i sin y to give
</p>
<p>f0 &frac14; cos pzDk&eth; &THORN; � i cosb: sin&eth;pzDk&THORN;f gepisz (13:42)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>fg &frac14; &thorn;i sinb: sin&eth;pzDk&THORN;:episz (13:43)
</p>
<p>In these equations Dk is simply |k(2) � k(1)|. Leaving
the term episz in these equations does not affect the
</p>
<p>amplitudes of f0 and fg or the beam intensities but it
will make it easier for you to check that these expres-
sions satisfy, for example, equation 13.16.
</p>
<p>13.10 THE EFFECTIVE EXCITATION ERROR
</p>
<p>We can now write down the intensity at the bottom (exit
surface) of the specimen (z = t) and manipulate the
equations by substituting for Dk and w. The term Dk
in equations 13.42 and 13.43 is the same as Dg, i.e.,
g(2)� g(1) (see equation 13.41). We can therefore write
down Dk by considering equations 13.27 and 13.28

diffracted beam. In writing down equation 13.47, we
have defined another important new quantity seff, so
labeled because it&rsquo;s the effective excitation error.
</p>
<p>A KEY RESULT
We have shown directly that f0 in equation 13.39 is a
mixture of terms containing k(1) and k(2). This is why
fg depends on Dk.

<p>2(ptDk). Ig and I0 are both
periodic in both t and seff. As fg increases and decreases,
f0 behaves in a complementary manner so that
</p>
<p>I0 &frac14; 1� Ig (13:49)
</p>
<p>Remember when testing this formula that I = ff*
(f* is the complex conjugate of f).
</p>
<p>The effective excitation error, seff, is a very important
quantity. We can summarize some important properties
</p>
<p>&amp; The quantity seff is never zero.
&amp; When s is zero, seff is xg
</p>
<p>�1.
&amp; When s is very large, then seff becomes essentially the
same as s.
</p>
<p>13.11 THE COLUMN APPROXIMATION
</p>
<p>When we form an image, we try to focus the objective lens
on a plane in or below the specimen (remember that here,
belowmeans underfocus). One special planewe can choose
is the plane which corresponds to the bottom of the speci-
men, assuming that this plane is perpendicular to the direc-
tion of the propagating beam. Whatever plane we choose,
what we see depends on the beams that finally leave the
bottom of the specimen, so let&rsquo;s concentrate on this one
plane. Look at Figure 13.3A; P is the point at the bottomof
the specimen, and we are calculating the values of f0 and
fg at this point to construct our image. Where do the
electrons come from in order to contribute to f0 and fg?
The answer is the cone APBwhere the angle APB is�2yB.
In other words, we don&rsquo;t just have a diffracted beamwhich
</p>
<p>propagates through the specimen from the top to point P.
There is actually a cone of material which contributes to
the intensity at point P. The shape of the cone can be
calculated using the Fresnel-zone construction, which was
actually developed nearly 200 years ago for visible-light
optics. Figure 13.3B, which is how the cone is usually
drawn, summarizes the relevant parameters; don&rsquo;t forget
that a cone, not a triangle, of material contributes to the
intensity at P. A clear derivation is given by Hecht. Why is
it a Fresnel diffraction? The answer is that we form an
image, i.e., look at a plane, which is very close to where the
diffraction &lsquo;event&rsquo; occurred, we are in the near-field, or
Fresnel, regime (see Section 2.9).
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider some actual numbers: At 100 kV, l=
3.7 pm, yB� 0.01 radians or�0.58. So if the thickness of
the specimen is 100 nm, then AB is � 2 nm. If we
increase the t, then the width of the column will also
increase. However, if we increase the accelerating vol-
tage so as to increase the thickness we can penetrate, the
wavelength decreases causing the Bragg angle also to
decrease. This allows us to make the approximation
shown in Figure 13.4A and B when calculating f0 and
fg. This model is known as the column approximation.
</p>
<p>The great advantage of this approximation is that it
allows us to calculate the scattering from slices which have
a constant width as we pass down the column, which itself
lies in awell-defined direction (generally parallel tokD).We
might anticipate problemswith very small defects on a very

positions in the foil. The more correct, non-column treat-
ment was introduced byTakagi; the analysis byHowie and
Basinski is what we use in computer programs.
</p>
<p>13.12 THE APPROXIMATIONS
AND SIMPLIFICATIONS
</p>
<p>In order to minimize the mathematics and to emphasize
the underlying physical principles involved in the analysis
of diffracted beams, we have made a number of assump-
tions, simplifications, and approximations. Although we
are not going to cover all of these points, you should be
aware of some of them
</p>
<p>&amp; We have completely neglected any effects due to
backscattering of the electrons. This approximation
is reasonable since we are dealing with electrons
which have very high energies. However, if you are
familiar with SEM, you will have encountered back-
scattered electron (BSE) imaging and possibly, rock-
ing-beam channeling patterns (RCPs) or electron
backscattered diffraction (EBSD) patterns. So
some electrons must be backscattered.
</p>
<p>&amp; In some parts of the discussion, it is an implicit
assumption that the crystal has a center of symmetry.
This assumption is hidden in our use of xg. If the
material is non-centrosymmetric, then the BF image
and images formed using only a systematic row of
reflections will not be affected. Differences will occur
in some DF images or when non-systematic reflec-
tions contribute to the image. In these cases, you will
need to use a computer program to predict or inter-
pret the contrast.
</p>
<p>&amp; From Chapter 11, you know that it is impossible to
set up a true two-beam condition for a thin TEM
specimen. There will always be more than one dif-
fracted spot visible. So how dowemeasure xg exactly?
The answer is that we don&rsquo;t, but we can make a very
good estimate.
</p>
<p>&amp; Remember the use of z and t. When we consider
the diffracted beam, then z and t are measured
along the direction of the diffracted beam. In
general, this distance will be different for each
beam. The saving feature is that we are usually
concerned with small Bragg angles. As a thought
exercise, you might consider the effect of having
a steeply inclined wedge or a specimen which,
although parallel sided, is steeply inclined to the
electron beam.
</p>
<p>&amp; The full analysis of scattering includes a term in
r�1 which says that the intensity falls off as r�2.
This is just the standard flux relation&mdash;the number
of electrons passing through a spherical surface
around the scattering point is constant. (The sur-
face area of a sphere is proportional to r2.) This
term has been omitted throughout our discussion
since it only affects the absolute intensity. A prac-
tical lesson from this is that you should use the
lowest magnification that will give you the desired
resolution; remember that the highest useful
magnification in a TEM image is about 106 (see
Section 6.6.B).
</p>
<p>In the quantum mechanical convention, the time-
dependent Schrödinger equation is written as
</p>
<p>h2
</p>
<p>8p2m
r2c &frac14; �i h
</p>

</p>
<p>with the full solution being
</p>
<p>c&eth;r; t&THORN; &frac14; Ae&thorn;i&eth;k�r�ot&THORN; (13:52)
</p>
<p>&amp; The concept of a refractive-index effect for electron
waves is directly analogous to that for visible-light
waves, or any other electromagnetic radiation, in
that the potential of the crystal causes a change in
the kinetic energy of the electrons (because their
total energy is unchanged) and therefore, their veloc-
ity is changed. Normally, of course, we think of this
as a change in the wavelength of the electrons. The
magnitude of k will always be larger than that of w.
</p>
<p>&amp; We have not mentioned the absorption of Bragg
beams, yet we know that this must occur since we
can only examine thin specimens in the TEM.
Absorption of beams is considered in Section 14.6
and Section 23.8.
</p>
<p>TWO OPPOSITE CONVENTIONS
</p>
<p>Two conventions are used to describe the exponential
dependence on k and r; both are commonly used.
</p>
<p>e2pik�r or e�2pik�r
</p>
<p>These conventions have been discussed by Spence. In
our analysis, we have chosen to use e2pik.r which
Spence has termed the &lsquo;quantum-mechanical&rsquo;
convention.
Note that Spence uses the alternative &lsquo;crystallo-
graphic&rsquo; convention, except when he discusses Bloch
waves.
</p>
<p>COLUMN APPROXIMATION
The column approximation often hides itself very
well, but it is actually used in many calculations of
images.

<p>Both equations now only have one variable, the
thickness of the specimen. We will refer to these equa-
tions when we discuss images in Chapter 23, but we
can note immediately that Ig is zero at t= 0 and again
at t= xg (or in general at t= nxg, where n is an integer).
This is the reason we call xg the extinction distance.
This situation corresponds to two coupled simple-
harmonic oscillators with energy (i.e., intensity, I0 and
Ig) being continuously transferred from one to the other
and back again. Notice that Ig can only increase to unity
when s = 0.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have derived equations and introduced terminology that will form the
basis for our discussion of diffraction-contrast images. It is not necessary for you to be able
to reproduce the mathematical derivations but equations 13.47 and 13.48 are crucial and
must be understood. Our analysis was quickly limited to two beams, the direct beam and
one Bragg-diffracted beam. In deriving the Howie-Whelan equations, we must consider
both forward scattering and Bragg diffraction. We introduced a new parameter, the critical
length xg, and explained why this parameter is called the extinction distance. This length was
defined in equation 13.4 which shows that xg depends on thematerial, the reflection, and the
wavelength of the electrons. Two particular points you need to remember are
</p>
<p>&amp; If the voltage increases then l decreases and xg increases.
&amp; The contribution of each Bloch wave is determined by s.
</p>
<p>In Section 24.3, we&rsquo;ll show how the two-beam analysis can be extended using the concept of
the scattering matrix.

<p>Bloch Waves
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>This topic is rather mathematical, with long sequences of differential equations. The
discussion of Bloch waves given here follows the treatment of Hirsch et al. which, in turn,
was based on the original analysis of electron diffraction by Bethe (1928). The notation we
will use closely follows that used by Bethe. Remember that g can be any reciprocal-lattice
vector, although we will also use it to represent a specific vector.
</p>
<p>This analysis leads directly to one of the most important concepts used to understand
images of defects in thin foils: it explains the physical origin of the extinction distance, xg,
and thus shows why it is so important. So again it is worth persevering. However, many
successful microscopists have skipped this topic. We suggest you first skim through this
chapter. Then, when you&rsquo;ve recognized its importance and seen the key equations, go back
to the beginning and work your way through.
</p>
<p>We make certain assumptions about the materials we are considering and what voltages
are used. Youmust keep these assumptions inmindwhen applying these concepts. Themost
important point is that, within the limits of our approximations, the analysis is rigorous and
we can really understand the meaning of xg. If you&rsquo;ve previously come across the idea of
kinematical diffraction, this chapter will make it clear why this theory is, at best, only an
approximation to reality.
</p>
<p>We start by considering the property of a crystal which we know quite well, namely, the
inner potential. You should remember that, strictly speaking, everything we are about to go
through in this section applies only to perfect crystals; crystals with surfaces are not
&lsquo;perfect.&rsquo; The periodic nature of the crystal potential leads to the concepts of Bloch func-
tions and Bloch waves.
</p>
<p>We include a discussion of the two-beam case, since this can easily be solved analytically
and can be related directly to the results discussed in Chapter 13 on diffracted beams. In
Chapter 15 we will discuss a graphical representation of the equations we are deriving here.
As with the Ewald sphere and reciprocal lattice, the diagrams make for an easier under-
standing and give a useful guide when you are actually using the TEM. We will consider
absorption of Bloch waves here but when we use it in, e.g., Section 24.7, the physical
significance will be more obvious.
</p>
<p>14.1 WAVE EQUATION IN TEM
</p>
<p>We are going to modify the Schrödinger equation for
use in TEM to explain why the Bloch waves have the
form they do. We are not going to try to be mathe-
matically rigorous in deriving this modified equation;
reference texts for this purpose are listed at the end of
the chapter. Let&rsquo;s start with the time-independent
Schrödinger equation

</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>c&eth;r&THORN; &frac14; Ec&eth;r&THORN; (14:1)
</p>
<p>The first term (in r2) represents the kinetic energy
and the second term, the potential energy; E represents
the total energy. In TEM we usually talk in terms of
the accelerating voltage and the crystal potential and,
therefore, we rearrange this equation in terms of vol-
tages. In doing so, we have to be careful about signs
since the charge on the electron is negative and the
applied electric field (associated with the accelerating
voltage) points toward the gun! All that equation 14.1
says is that the electron has a kinetic energy due to the
acceleration it is given in the gun. Initially, this is the
total energy of the electron. When the electron passes
</p>
<p>14.1 WAVE EQUAT ION IN TEM ................................................................................................................................................................ 235</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>through the crystal, it will have a potential energy due
to the periodic potential associated with the atoms in
the crystal.
</p>
<p>Now we can rearrange equation 14.1 in terms of the
accelerating voltage and the crystal potential
</p>
<p>r2c&eth;r&THORN; &thorn; 8p
2me
</p>
<p>h2
V&thorn; V&eth;r&THORN;&frac12; �c&eth;r&THORN; &frac14; 0 (14:2)
</p>
<p>The task before us is obvious: we have to solve equation
14.2. In general, however, this is a difficult problem!
What makes it possible for us is that V(r) has special
properties because we are only considering crystalline
materials.
</p>
<p>14.2 THE CRYSTAL
</p>
<p>The basic property of a crystal is that its inner potential,
V(r), is periodic. We can therefore express this property
as
</p>
<p>V&eth;r&THORN; &frac14;V&eth;r&thorn;R&THORN; (14:3)
</p>
<p>where R represents any lattice vector of the crystal
and, as usual, r represents any real-space vector.
Equation 14.3 is the fundamental definition of a perfect
crystal: the environment at point r is identical to that at
point r+ R. We can draw this inner potential as shown
in Figure 14.1 for the one-dimensional case and you can
imagine it in 3D. The atomic nuclei are positively
charged; the surrounding electrons gradually screen
this charge and the atom appears neutral from the out-
side. In a crystal, a nucleus is never far away, so an
electron which we &lsquo;shoot&rsquo; through the crystal will always
</p>
<p>see a positive potential; hence V(r) is always positive as
noted in Section 14.1 and in Figure 3.1.
</p>
<p>The electron beam can be described by its total
wave function ctot which must always be a solution of
the Schrödinger equation; i.e., this equation describes
how an electron behaves both inside and outside the
crystal.
</p>
<p>In the discussion which follows, we will use poten-
tials so the units will be volts. You can always change to
the energy formalism, but remember that the charge on
the electron is a negative number.
</p>
<p>We know that for any crystal the inner potential
must be real, i.e., the potential energy must be real, so
that V(r) and its complex conjugate, which we denote as
V*(r), are identical

<p>V&eth;r&THORN; &frac14; V �&eth;r&THORN; (14:4a)
</p>
<p>Now tomake the treatment simple, we consider the case of
crystals with a center of symmetry
</p>
<p>V&eth;r&THORN; &frac14; V&eth;�r&THORN; (14:4b)
</p>
<p>The case of non-centrosymmetric crystals, such as
GaAs, could be considered, but the equations would
</p>
<p>THE SIGNS
&amp; The charge on the electron, q, is a negative num-
ber, &ndash;e, where e is a positive number.
</p>
<p>&amp; The accelerating voltage, &ndash;V (usually between
100 kV and 1MV), is negative for a positive
charge leaving the gun. This quantity, &ndash;V, is really
the &lsquo;electric-field potential.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&amp; The initial energy given to the electron is a posi-
tive number, E (in eV); it is just the charge times
the accelerating voltage. We can write this as eV
where both e and V are positive numbers.
</p>
<p>&amp; The potential inside the crystal, V(r), is a positive
number reaching a local maximum at the nucleus
of an atom; the nucleus is positive.
</p>
<p>&amp; The potential energy, V, of the electron outside the
crystal is zero; it decreases when the electron is
inside the crystal (V is q times V(r), i.e., &ndash;eV(r))
and is therefore always a negative number.

<p>Here Vg is, by definition, the g component of V in the

simpler we define a parameter Ug related to Vg by
</p>
<p>Vg &frac14;
h2
</p>
<p>2me
Ug (14:6)
</p>
<p>In the Fourier series given in equation 14.5 andmodified
by equation 14.6, Vg and Ug are referred to as the Fou-
rier coefficients. Equation 14.5 becomes

<p>Now V(r) has been expanded as a Fourier sum; all the
conditions on Vg also apply to each Ug so that

g &frac14; U�g (14:8)
</p>
<p>You can check these relationships by just replacing r
by &ndash;r, etc. Before continuing, however, you may find it
useful to review the relative magnitudes of the energies
which are summarized in Table 14.1.
</p>
<p>Much of what we are now discussing is mathemati-
cally the same as you may have seen in condensed-
matter physics. The big difference is that we are injecting
electrons with kinetic energies which are 5&ndash;6 orders of
magnitude greater than the band gap of Si. Notice that
the mean inner potential energy is V in equation 14.1.
The actual value of V is not as precise as it might
sometimes appear. You should remember that it is the
average background potential energy and is directly
related to the characteristic length x0 that we introduced
in Chapter 13. More values of V are given in Table 14.2.
One interesting feature of this table is that the magni-
tude of V only varies by a factor of 3 when the atomic
number changes from 4 to 74.
</p>
<p>14.3 BLOCH FUNCTIONS
</p>
<p>Since the electron is in a periodic potential its wave
function must have the symmetry of the crystal. The
solutions to the Schrödinger equation which always
have the required translation property are known as
Bloch waves. Since these wave functions, c(j)(r), are
special, we&rsquo;ll define them as
</p>
<p>c&eth;j&THORN;&eth;r&THORN; &frac14; b k&eth;j&THORN;; r
� �
</p>
<p>&frac14; b&eth;j&THORN;&eth;r&THORN; (14:9)
</p>
<p>The reason for the &lsquo;j &rsquo; is that each Bloch wave has a single
value of k (each Bloch wave is a plane wave) which we can
denote as k(j); in general, there will be more than one Bloch
wave for a particular physical situation. The notation we
will use is such that, whenever we have k(j) in an expression,
we will identify this by the superscript which implies that
the function varies withk(j). Bloch&rsquo;s theorem states that this
wave function in a periodic potential can be written as
</p>
<p>b&eth;j&THORN;&eth;r&THORN; &frac14; b k&eth;j&THORN;; r

</p>
<p>&eth;j&THORN;
� r (14:10)
</p>
<p>such that the Bloch function, m(j)(r), can itself be
expressed as a Fourier series since m(r) is also a periodic
function of r
</p>
<p>m&eth;j&THORN;&eth;r&THORN; &frac14;

<p>C&eth;j&THORN;g k
&eth;j&THORN;
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>e2pig � r (14:11)
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call C
&eth;j&THORN;
g the j-sub-g plane-wave amplitude
</p>
<p>and generally refer to the C values as the plane-wave
amplitudes; they depend on which k(j) we are consider-
ing, but not on r. We combine these definitions to give b
which is itself dependent on j
</p>
<p>b&eth;j&THORN;&eth;r&THORN; &frac14;

<p>g
</p>
<p>C&eth;j&THORN;g e
2pi&eth;k&eth;j&THORN; &thorn; g&THORN; � r (14:12)
</p>
<p>Using our notation, the superscript on C indicates that
C( j) depends on j because it is associated with k( j). We
can now write the expanded expression for b(j)(r), which
is a solution to the Schrödinger equation

<p>The first term in this series is C0; the subscript is
zero is because the length of this g vector is 0. Much
of the following analysis is exactly the same as you
may have encountered in studying semiconductor
band-gap theory. The difference will be that we
can make certain approximations which are only
valid because the electrons used in TEM have much
higher energies (100keV to 1MeV) than the inner
potential of the crystal (�7&ndash;24 eV). It is always impor-
tant to keep in mind the magnitude of the quantities we
are considering and remember that the Bloch function
has the periodicity of the lattice. When you are reading
other texts, you&rsquo;ll see that physics textbooks will tend to
omit the term 2p in such expressions so that |k|
becomes 2p/l instead of 1/l.
</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done anything yet, just restated the prob-
lem and remembered Bloch&rsquo;s theorem. The analysis we&rsquo;ve
just completed follows the original treatment of Bethe
(1928).We can now expressctotusing equation 14.9 to give

<p>In this equation, A (j) will be determined by the specimen
type, the specimen orientation, etc., i.e., the boundary
conditions. The As are known as the Bloch-wave excita-
tion coefficients, since they tell us the relative contribu-
tions of each Bloch wave, i.e., how strongly each Bloch
wave is excited.
</p>
<p>14.4 SCHRÖDINGER&rsquo;S EQUATION FOR
BLOCH WAVES
</p>
<p>Whatwe are now going to do is to rewrite the Schröding-
er equation to incorporate the properties of Bloch
waves automatically. If you wish, you can skip this
section and just accept the result given in equation
14.27. The way we include the periodicity is to express
the inner potential in equation 14.2 as the Fourier series
given in equation 14.7

<p> !
</p>
<p>c&eth;r&THORN; &frac14; 0 (14:17)
</p>
<p>Next, we can introduce a new quantityKwhich is defined by
the equation
</p>
<p>K2 &frac14;
2meE
</p>
<p>h2
&thorn;U0 &frac14; w
</p>
<p>2 &thorn;U0 (14:18)
</p>
<p>With this definition we have removed theU0 term from the
sum over all g, so that equation 14.15 is now

</p>
<p>4p2
r2c&eth;r&THORN; &thorn; K2c&eth;r&THORN; &thorn;

</p>
<p>g 6&frac14;0
</p>
<p>Uge
2pig � rc&eth;r&THORN; &frac14; 0 (14:19)
</p>
<p>The reason for doing this is that we are going to be con-
cerned with different diffraction vectors, g. The U0 term
does not depend on g. We call U0 the (scaled) mean inner
potential of the crystal; this potential is thus a &lsquo;background&rsquo;
or continuum property of the crystal; it does not directly
depend on the crystal structure. (You may recognize this
manipulation as the refractive-index idea reappearing.)
</p>
<p>WhenV(r) is 0, thenU0 is 0 so thatK
2 takesonaspecial
</p>
<p>value which we have already called w2
</p>
<p>w2 &frac14;
2meE
</p>
<p>h2
(14:20)
</p>
<p>The mass,m, is actually the relativistic mass, not the rest
mass; eE is the kinetic energy of the electron (in the
vacuum between the gun and the specimen). We know
that
</p>
<p>1
</p>

<p>2m
&frac14;
</p>
<p>hk&eth; &THORN;2
</p>
<p>2m
(14:21)
</p>
<p>where v is the velocity, p the momentum, and k a wave
vector. Thus w is the wave vector of the electron outside
the crystal as we had in Chapter 13.
</p>
<p>The meaning of K is now clear: K is the wave vector
of the electron inside the specimen, i.e., after correcting
for the refractive-index effect. SinceU0 is a positive num-
ber, K is always larger than w. Hence the kinetic energy of
the electrons in the crystal is greater than in the vacuum.
The potential energy inside the crystal is negative so, even
</p>
<p>EACH BLOCH WAVE
The main point to remember is that each Bloch
</p>
<p>wave is associated with just one k(j) but it is a con-
tinuously varying function of r. Each Bloch wave is a
sum over all the points in reciprocal space. In other
words, each Bloch wave depends on every g, and
conversely, each g beam depends on every Bloch
wave!
</p>
<p>238 ................................................................................................................................................................................................BLOCH WAVES</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>though it may be counterintuitive, you now know that
electrons travel faster in the crystal! The wavelength of the
electrons in the crystal is therefore smaller than the wave-
length outside (l is the reciprocal of k).
</p>
<p>Remember that light is electromagnetic radiation.
The refractive index for light is n = c/v and is always
�1; c is the velocity of light in a vacuum and v is the
velocity in any other material. This is one of those cases
where we have to be wary when applying ideas derived
for light waves to electron waves.
</p>
<p>Equations 14.18 and 14.20 are dispersion relations.
Such equations relate the magnitude of the wave vector,
K or w, to the energy of the electron.
</p>
<p>We want to simplify equation 14.19. We know that
c(r) is a Bloch wave (given by equation 14.12) so we can
obtain an expression forr2c(r) by differentiating b(j)(r).
Remember that C

<p>&eth;14:24&THORN;
</p>
<p>In doing so we replace the g in the summation in equa-
tion 14.19 by h just for clarity (!); both are called
&lsquo;dummy&rsquo; variables. If we sum over all the values of a
variable we can &lsquo;center&rsquo; the variable wherever we wish.
We can further simplify the third term in equation 14.24
by combining the exponential terms and renaming g

</p>
<p>Now the sum over all g&ndash;h vectors is the same as the sum
over all g vectors so we replace g&ndash;h by g. (Remember, all
we are doing is renaming these dummy variables in a
consistent way.) Then equation 14.24, and hence 14.19,
becomes much simpler

<p>&eth;14:26&THORN;
</p>
<p>We can obtain a useful relation by noting that the coeffi-
cients of each term in exp(2pig�r) must separately be
equal to zero. The only way that equation 14.26 can be
true is if the term inside the bracket is always zero. The
result is a series of equations (one for each value of g)

</p>
<p>This is another really important setof equations; they restate
the Bloch-wave expression of the Schrödinger equation.
</p>
<p>Notice that we are not summing over g in equation
14.27. The reason for excluding h=0 from the sum is
that we have already included it in the first term.
</p>
<p>14.5 THE PLANE-WAVE AMPLITUDES
</p>
<p>We can rewrite and reorder equation 14.27 by, yet
again, renaming the variable h as g&ndash;h. When we do
this, we must exclude h= g in the sum
</p>
<p>K2 � k&eth;j&THORN; &thorn; g

</p>
<p>Ug�hC
&eth;j&THORN;
h &frac14; 0 (14:28)
</p>
<p>The reason for making this change is that it emphasizes
that the &lsquo;U&rsquo; terms are the features which couple together
the &lsquo;C&rsquo; terms. In other words, this equation tells us how
the potential of the crystal, the U terms, mixes the
different Bloch waves. The C terms are the Bloch-wave
amplitudes. This is the dynamical coupling concept.
</p>
<p>This equation represents a set of equations which are
the fundamental equations of the dynamical theory.
(They are called the secular equations in condensed-
matter physics texts.) This equation also links the con-
cepts of Bragg beams and Bloch waves.
</p>
<p>Ug&ndash;h is the component of the inner potential which
couples the Bragg beams with reciprocal-lattice vectors
g and h to one another.
</p>
<p>Now we again simplify the situation by limiting the
treatment to two beams, O and P; i.e., we consider the
case where the only values of Cg which are non-zero are
C
</p>
<p>&eth;j&THORN;
0 and C
</p>
<p>&eth;j&THORN;
p but Up and U&ndash;p are both allowed.
</p>
<p>DISPERSION
When discussing light, the word dispersion means
separation of electromagnetic radiation into constitu-
ents of different wavelength. In electron optics, the
meaning is exactly the same but we emphasize differ-
ent k vectors or different energy.
</p>
<p>ELECTRON SPEED IN A CRYSTAL
Electrons travel faster in the crystal. Light slows
down in a crystal.

<p>The mean inner potential of the crystal is usually 	20V
while the energy of the electrons is �100,000 eV. Because
|k(j) + p| and |k(j)| are both very close to K, it&rsquo;s the differ-
ence that is important. Since P could be any diffracted
beam, we can rename it G to make it look more familiar!

<p>It is important not to confuse k(j) with kI or kD and to
remember that |K| (= |kD� kI|) is notK. Incidentally, it
is not until we write this equation that we use the
assumption that the crystal has a center of symmetry
(see equation 14.4b).
</p>
<p>Equation 14.34 is a more complex dispersion rela-
tion than equations 14.18 and 14.20. Since k(j) can point
in any direction, this dispersion relation defines a sur-
face, known as the dispersion surface, which is just the
locus of all allowed k(j) vectors for a particular fixed
energy. (See Chapter 15.) The simpler relations given in
</p>
<p>equations 14.18 and 14.20 each defined a sphere; the
vectors K and w can point in any direction.

<p>Some points to notice are
</p>
<p>&amp; The terms Ug, C
&eth;j&THORN;
g , and ag are related by a set of
</p>
<p>linear equations (the matrix in 14.37).
&amp; We can&rsquo;t solve for actual values of theC
</p>
<p>&eth;j&THORN;
g terms, but
</p>
<p>we can find the ratios C
&eth;j&THORN;
g =C
</p>
<p>&eth;j&THORN;
0 .
</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t take this topic much further here but refer
you again to the excellent article by Metherell who
shows that equation 14.37 can be expressed as an eigen-
</p>
<p>value equation where C
&eth;j&THORN;
g
</p>
<p>n o
</p>
<p>appears as the eigenvectors
</p>
<p>and the wave vectors k(j) appear as the eigenvalues. He
expresses this equation as
</p>
<p>MfC&eth;j&THORN;g
o
</p>
<p>&frac14; g&eth;j&THORN; C&eth;j&THORN;g
n o
</p>
<p>(14:42)
</p>
<p>where the matrix M has diagonal elements mgg and off-
diagonal elements mgh. The reason we mention this fact
here is that the mgg terms correspond to the excitation
errors, sg, and the mgh terms correspond to the extinc-
tion distance xg&ndash;h. Remember that h is the column and
notice that the subscript here is g&ndash;h; this extinction
distance is related to the interference between the g
beam and the h beam. Now if you&rsquo;re intrigued and
your math is strong, see Metherell&rsquo;s article.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with this math approach, you&rsquo;ll
recognize that eigenvectorsmust satisfy certain relations
for normalization and orthogonality. If you look back
to Chapter 13, you&rsquo;ll see that we normalized C
</p>
<p>&eth;j&THORN;
g in
</p>
<p>writing equation 13.30.
As you can see, the math is beginning to become
</p>
<p>tricky! In the next chapter, we will derive explicit expres-
sions for x0 and xg in the two-beam case, namely
</p>
<p>x0 &frac14;
2K cos yB
</p>
<p>U0
(14:43)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>x0 &frac14;
2K cos yB
</p>
<p>Ug
&frac14; 1
</p>
<p>Dk
(14:44)
</p>
<p>In our derivation we will use a graphical representa-
tion of the dispersion equations. This approach has
much in common with the Ewald-sphere/reciprocal-
lattice approach to understanding diffraction. It&rsquo;s par-
ticularly useful since it gives you, the microscopist,
another picture, this time related to imaging.
</p>
<p>14.6 ABSORPTION OF BLOCH WAVES
</p>
<p>When we have just two beams excited, O and G, we
showed in Section 13.9 that we can express the wave
function c as
</p>
<p>c r&eth; &THORN; &frac14; A&eth;1&THORN;b&eth;1&THORN; r&eth; &THORN; &thorn; A&eth;2&THORN;b&eth;2&THORN; r&eth; &THORN; (14:45)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>A&eth;1&THORN; &frac14; cosb
2
;A&eth;2&THORN; &frac14; sinb
</p>
<p>2
(14:46)
</p>
<p>We can plot these curves for A(1) and A(2) in relation to
the positions of the atoms in a simple-cubic crystal
where the electron beam is close to the [001] zone axis.
Figure 14.2 shows that the intensity in Bloch wave 1 is
centered on the column of atoms (Figure 14.2A) while
that in Bloch wave 2 is centered between the atoms
(Figure 14.2B). (If you read Hirsch et al., you should
note that they have 1 and 2 reversed.) Therefore Bloch
wave 1 interacts more strongly with the column of
atoms and will be &lsquo;absorbed&rsquo; preferentially. Conversely,
Bloch wave 2 will be channeled through the specimen.
The intensity in the g beam depends on the thickness of
the specimen because of the interference between these
two Bloch waves. This preferential absorption means
that we may expect to &lsquo;lose&rsquo; this thickness dependence
even though we can still &lsquo;see&rsquo; through the specimen.
We&rsquo;ll return to this topic in Chapter 24.

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
We told you at the beginning of the chapter that this discussion would seem to be just theory
or manipulating equations. There are, however, some really important ideas
</p>
<p>&amp; A basic property of a crystal is that its inner potential, V(r), is periodic and positive.
&amp; An electron in a crystal can be described by a sum of Bloch waves which themselves are
solutions to the Schrödinger equation.
</p>
<p>&amp; The wave functions f0 and fg are not solutions to this equation and therefore don&rsquo;t
actually exist as waves in the crystal.
</p>
<p>&amp; All Bloch waves have the same total energy.
</p>
<p>Therefore, if we really want to understand what goes on in the crystal, wemust be able to
understand the concept of Bloch waves. However, you can understand how to relate images
to the structure of the specimen without considering Bloch waves. You just have to accept
that the analysis using beams (hence f0 and fg) is phenomenological. Equations 14.27 and
14.28 give you the essential clue to what really happens: each set of equations tells us how the
Bloch waves are coupled. When you&rsquo;ve worked through this chapter, go through Sections
13.8 and 13.9 again.
</p>
<p>There are many possible solutions to the Schrödinger equation, and each Bloch wave is a
plane wave; that is, it can be associated with well-defined propagation vector k(j) as shown in
equation 14.9.
</p>
<p>The Bloch waves are generally different because theUg terms are different, i.e., they have
different potential energies. Therefore, they have different kinetic energies and different
wave vectors.
</p>
<p>Finally, a word on relativity. We&rsquo;ve kept our treatment as simple as possible, but you
should remember that the equations should be relativistically corrected; most texts have
ignored relativistic effects when discussing this topic.

<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>The analysis of Bloch waves given in the previous chapter is closely related to the classic
analysis of waves that you&rsquo;ve seen in condensed-matter physics or semiconductor theory. In
semiconductors in particular, we often talk of band diagrams and indirect or direct band
gaps. We use terms like conduction bands, valence bands, and Brillouin-zone boundaries
(BZBs). We visualize these quantities by drawing diagrams of E(k), the electron energy
(which is a function of k) versus k, the wave vector. This plot of E(k) versus k is known as a
dispersion diagram. To remind you of the magnitudes involved, the band gap in Si is 1.1 eV
and that of Ge is 0.7 eV. In a good insulator, it can be 10 eV. We now follow the same
approach to represent pictorially what we described in equations in Chapters 13 and 14.
Remember that the big difference from the solid-state physics approach is that the energy of
the electrons in the beam in the TEM is �100 keV.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we will see the real origin of the extinction distance xg, which we
introduced in equation 13.4. We will discuss how it relates to particular materials and
why it varies with the diffraction vector being used. We will then discuss the physical origin
of the concept of the effective extinction distance: i.e., the value which the extinction
distance appears to have when s 6&frac14; 0. This discussion of dispersion surfaces is included as
a separate chapter, so that you can omit it without affecting your understanding of the rest
of the text. We should give you a warning: this is a subject which has probably turned off
many potential microscopists. It can be very mathematical, pure theoretical physics, or it
can provide many useful insights into image formation. We are trying for the latter. If we
aren&rsquo;t completely successful, take heart; nearly every established microscopist has survived
without completely mastering this concept!

<p>15.1 INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>The analysis of Bloch waves as they apply to electrons in
solids is well documented in the condensed-matter phys-
ics literature. However, what we want from the theory
is different from what an electrical engineer might want:
we want to understand how it applies to the formation
of contrast in TEM images and DPs. With this aim
in mind, we will again follow the treatment given in
Metherell&rsquo;s classic and well-hidden article, already refer-
enced in Chapters 13 and 14. In Chapter 14, we derived
equations relating k to Ug. (See Section 14.2 for the
definition of Ug.) Specifically, we found that there
are two Bloch waves if there are two Bragg beams, 0
and g. We can rewrite equation 14.35 incorporating
equation 14.32 as
</p>
<p>C
&eth;j&THORN;

</p>
<p>C
&eth;j&THORN;

</p>
<p>Ug
</p>
<p>k&eth;j&THORN; &thorn; g
� �2
</p>
<p>�K2
(15:1)
</p>
<p>whereC0
(j) is the amplitude of the plane wave with wave
</p>
<p>vector k( j), and Cg
( j) is the amplitude of the plane wave
</p>
<p>with wave vector k( j)+g. The Bloch wave was given in
equation 14.12 as
</p>
<p>b&eth;j&THORN;&eth;r&THORN; &frac14;

</p>
<p>g
</p>
<p>C&eth;j&THORN;g e
2pi k&eth;j&THORN;&thorn;g&eth; &THORN; : r (15:2)
</p>
<p>Equation 15.1 says that the values of Cg
(j) and C0
</p>
<p>( j) are
directly related to k( j)2&ndash;K2 and thus to k( j)&ndash;K.
</p>
<p>In the general many-beam case (actually, in any
situation where we have more than two beams), the
situation is more complicated. However, we can sepa-
rate the problem into two parts
</p>
<p>&amp; Determine all the allowed wave vectors k(j) in a crys-
tal, including all possible orientations of the crystal.
</p>
<p>&amp; Determine which set of the allowed k( j) wave vectors
is actually present when you fix the orientation of
your crystal.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The first statement fixes the total energy of the electron
and selects the crystal. The second statement applies the
boundary conditions for the particular situation you are
considering, as we&rsquo;ll illustrate in Sections 15.5 and 15.6.
</p>
<p>The solution to the first part of the problem is found by
setting |A( j)|= 0. (We definedA( j) in Section 14.3 and gave
an expression for it in Section 14.5.) If you multiply the
determinant, you get a polynomial to the power 2n in k( j)
</p>
<p>A2n k
&eth;j&THORN;
</p>
<p>� �2n
</p>
<p>&thorn; A2n�1 k&eth;j&THORN;
� �2n�1
</p>
<p>&thorn; K &frac14; 0 (15:3)
</p>
<p>The coefficient An depends on K
2 (i.e., the energy) and g
</p>
<p>(i.e., the crystal).
So, the polynomial in k(j) relates k(j) to the total energy.
</p>
<p>This is a dispersion relation as we defined the term in
Section 14.4. The equation has 2n roots and some might
be complex. To quote Metherell, &lsquo;&lsquo;at first sight therefore,
the situation appears to be a complicated one!&rsquo;&rsquo; So in
following Metherell we make two simplifications
</p>
<p>&amp; We consider only the high-energy case.
&amp; Weassume that we only excite reflections in the ZOLZ.
</p>
<p>There are three reasons for reminding you of these
simplifications
</p>
<p>&amp; If you want to make a Bloch-wave calculation where
you include more than two Bragg beams, then you
will need a computer.
</p>
<p>&amp; The diagrams we&rsquo;re considering in this chapter are a
pictorial representation. The diagrams help us think
about what is actually happening to the Blochwaves.
If we just did the calculation, we would lose the
physical &lsquo;feel&rsquo; for the problem.
</p>
<p>&amp; None of the diagrams we will draw will consider
HOLZ reflections; if we make the beam energy high
enough, we don&rsquo;t need to consider them. However, the
energy is not really that high andHOLZ reflections are
not only seen experimentally, but can also provide
valuable information, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapters 20 and
21. The saving factor is that modern computers have
no problems in handling these equations, especially
since they are so amenable to matrix manipulation.
</p>
<p>15.2 THE DISPERSION DIAGRAM WHEN
Ug = 0
</p>
<p>We start with equation 14.34, namely
</p>
<p>k&eth;j&THORN;
�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>�� K

<p>�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>4K2
(15:4)
</p>
<p>Remember that this equation was derived for the two-
beam case. When the electrons are in the vacuum, i.e.,
outside the specimen, the Fourier coefficients Ug are 0.
When Ug = 0, the left side of this equation is zero and
the equation has two solutions.
</p>
<p>K &frac14; k&eth;j&THORN;
�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>� or K &frac14; k&eth;j&THORN; &thorn; g
�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>� (15:5)
</p>
<p>where j is 1 or 2. If we plot out these two solutions we
find, as shown in Figure 15.1, that we have two inter-
penetrating spheres, since both kI and kD can lie in any
direction. Since these two k vectors have the same
length, the two spheres represent surfaces of constant
energy, called dispersion surfaces, one centered on O
and the other centered on G.
</p>
<p>Of course, we already know that the energy of the
electron in a vacuum is related to its wave vector by
</p>
<p>E &frac14; p
2
</p>
<p>2m
&frac14; h
</p>
<p>2w2
</p>
<p>2m
(15:6)
</p>
<p>where p, the momentum, is related to the wave vector in
a vacuum, c, by p=hc. Here, c is the K when the
electron is in a vacuum.
</p>
<p>Rearranging, we have
</p>

<p>The dotted line drawn in Figure 15.1 represents a plane
that is defined by the circle created by the intersecting
spheres. You will probably be very familiar with the
BZB from condensed-matter physics.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 15.1. Cross section through two spheres of radii kI and kD
centered on O and G, respectively. The spheres represent surfaces of
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>While you work through the diagrams in this chap-
ter, you must remember that for high-energy electrons
the scattering angles, e.g., 2yB, are usually small and
the region of interest in reciprocal space is, therefore,
close to the BZB. We can redraw part of Figure 15.1 to
show an enlarged view of the region close to the
BZB in Figure 15.2. At high energies, we approximate
the surfaces as a pair of straight lines because l is very
small.
</p>
<p>15.3 THE DISPERSION DIAGRAM WHEN
Ug 6&frac14; 0
</p>
<p>When Ug 6&frac14; 0 we know from equation 15.4 that K can
never be equal to |kI| or |kD|. Since equation 15.4 is
quadratic we must have two values for |k|. So, the two
&lsquo;spheres&rsquo; can&rsquo;t intersect if Ug 6&frac14; 0. You noticed that
equation 15.4 resembles that for a hyperbola, xy = a,
where the x and the y axes are shown in Figure 15.2. We
can draw these two hyperbolae with their asymptotes as
</p>
<p>shown in Figure 15.3. These surfaces (remember we are
in three dimensions) are known as branches of the dis-
persion surface. The upper branch (identified here by
the &lsquo;1&rsquo;) corresponds to k(1) and the lower (identified by
the &lsquo;2&rsquo;) to k(2). We now have vectors k(1) and k(2) where
we used to just haveKI. There are some critical points to
remember in this discussion from Chapters 13 and 14
</p>
<p>&amp; The Bloch wave b(1)(k(1), r) is associated with k(1).
&amp; The Bloch wave b(2)(k(2), r) is associated with k(2).
&amp; The intensity of the Bragg beam is a function of
thickness |fg(t)|
</p>
<p>2 / sin2(ptDk) (from equation
13.45).
</p>
<p>The difference between Figures 15.1 and 15.3 is the
gap between the two branches in Figure 15.3. This gap is
present becauseUg is not zero;Ug is not zero because we
have a periodic array of atoms, i.e., a crystal. This gap is
directly analogous to the band gap in semiconductor
theory where there are forbidden electron energies
within the crystal.
</p>
<p>15.4 RELATING DISPERSION SURFACES
AND DIFFRACTION PATTERNS
</p>
<p>We can gain a lot of physical insight into Bloch waves
using the dispersion-surface construction rather than
solving the Bloch-wave equations on the computer. Our
approach is relatively simple.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; We start with the dispersion surface shown in
Figure 15.4A and draw an initial line to represent
the incoming beam traversing the thin foil. We
assume an idealized thin specimen with parallel sur-
faces that are perpendicular to the vertical, optic axis
of our TEM and we choose g to be parallel to the
surface. The incident beam is allowed to be inclined
to the surface of the specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; We then draw a line normal to any surface that the
initial line encounters. This allows us to match the
components of wave vectors parallel to that surface.
This is the wave-matching construction.
</p>
<p>&amp; We then extend the pointsM1 andM2 back to the &lsquo;k&rsquo;
spheres in Figure 15.4B; these spheres are the c
spheres when we are in the crystal.
</p>
<p>&amp; The last part of the process is always to relate the
waves in the crystal to the beams in the vacuum since
our recording film, CCD camera, etc., is always out-
side the crystal.
</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the plan&mdash;now we go through it step by step.
As shown on the enlarged view in Figure 15.5, each of
the k vectors has an associated wave amplitude Cg
</p>
<p>( j)
</p>
<p>associated with it.
In this discussion, we will limit ourselves to the two
</p>
<p>beams, O andG. As we know from Section 13.8, the only
values of C (the coefficients of the Bloch waves) that will
then be non-zero are C0

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>First, we need to know which points on the dispersion
surface will actually correspond to the diffraction condi-
tionwe have chosen.We also need to know the orientation
of the specimen relative to the beam and the orientation of
the Bragg planes (which is why we start by fixing this).
</p>
<p>To begin. We consider the case where the surface of
the specimen is parallel to g; we will explain why we are so
specific on this point in a moment.
</p>
<p>Nowwe have fixed the specimen and g relative to the
optic axis. Next we orient the incident beam. Note that
the beam is not parallel to the (hkl) planes; its k1 is
determined by c but isn&rsquo;t shown in the figure. We
will excite points M1
</p>
<p>B and M2
B on separate branches of
</p>
<p>the dispersion surface because this is where the dotted
line cuts the two surfaces. The extinction distance will
then correspond to Dk�1 for s=0 as in Section 13.10. If
we now tilt the incident beam so that c moves closer to
the vertical (keeping the specimen fixed), then the
excited points become M1, and M2 and, as we see in
Figure 15.4, s becomes negative.
</p>
<p>We define the lines M1
BM2
</p>
<p>B and M1M2 to be tie lines
because they tie together points on the different
branches of the dispersion surface. Both tie lines are
parallel to the BZB because we chose the top surface
of the specimen to be parallel to g.
</p>
<p>Each of these tie lines is normal to the surface that
produces it.
</p>
<p>The diagrams of the dispersion surface in Figures 15.4
and 15.5 contain lots of reminders
</p>
<p>&amp; For this orientation, kx is the same for all k vectors
ending on O.
</p>
<p>&amp; You can recognize g(1) and g(2) from Section 13.7.
&amp; The vacuum wave vector c is always shorter than K
or k.
</p>
<p>We can understand these changes from the following
argument. The O beam is always excited so C0
</p>
<p>(1) and
</p>
<p>C0
(j) will always be relatively large. Which other values
</p>
<p>of C are large will depend on where the Ewald sphere
cuts the systematic row of relrods.
</p>
<p>Now we can consider what happens when the surface
of the specimen is not parallel to g. Here, the normal to the
surface, n, is not parallel to the BZB (since the BZB is
normal to g). However, the tie line is always parallel to n
so the tie line is no longer parallel to the BZB. Remember:
this construction is graphically matching the components
of the k vector which are parallel to the surface of the
specimen. We saw this clearly in Figure 15.4 where we
commented that kx is the same for all the vectors ending
on O because we chose g to be parallel to the surface and
the surface to be normal to the optic axis in that case.
</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need tie lines in solid-state physics if the
electrons are always moving in a perfect lattice where we
don&rsquo;t consider surfaces.
</p>
<p>We are now ready to consider the more common
TEM wedge specimen shown in Figure 15.6A and then
we&rsquo;ll see how these excited Bloch waves relate to the DP.
</p>
<p>In this figure we have drawn the wedge with the top
surface horizontal. Thus we have tie line n1 along the
optic axis. When the electrons exit the crystal at the
inclined bottom surface, we again match components
parallel to this surface so we have tie line n2. Notice that
we must draw n2 through both M1 and M2. These tie
lines don&rsquo;t excite extra points on the dispersion surface
because we are leaving the crystal.
</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;re outside the crystal, we know that the
wave vector must be c and that c defines a pair of spheres
centered on O and G. So we extend the n2 tie lines until
they reach thec spheres.Nowwehave excited four points,
as we see graphically in Figure 15.6A. The points on theO
circle are labeled O1 and O2; those on the G circle are D1
and D2. We have labeled the subscripts this way because
they correspond to the plane waves c0
</p>
<p>(1), c0
(2), etc., as also
</p>
<p>shown in Figure 15.6A.
To conclude. Now we have reached the final step.
</p>
<p>We have to relate these beams to the DP. Yes, they are
real beams, not Bloch waves, because we are now
outside the specimen and in a vacuum. We show this
in Figure 15.6B. All of the c beams have been related
to point O1 because c0
</p>
<p>(1) is the incident beam. Remem-
ber: c0
</p>
<p>(1) is not vertical because we made g horizontal
and tilted the incident beam. The vectors c0
</p>
<p>(1) and
c0
</p>
<p>(2) are not quite parallel because although they are
both radii of the same sphere of radius w, they actually
originate at different points on the circle (see
Figure 15.6A).
</p>
<p>The conclusion is that we will have two spots at O
and two spots at G. In other words, the fact that we have

<p>a wedge specimen has split the spots at G. We will see
these split spots in Chapter 18 and we will return to this
topic in Chapter 23 when we discuss images.
</p>
<p>It can be useful to extend the wedge case to the double
wedge. For example, imagine an inclined planar defect in
a parallel-sided slab with g parallel to the slab surface as
shown in Figure 15.7. Everything is as before at the
top surface. At the inclined interface then, tie lines do
create new excited points B1 and B2 on the 1 and 2
branches of the dispersion surface.
</p>
<p>Now, n3 is the tie line due to the bottom surface and
n3 is parallel to n1. We extend the n3 tie lines to the c
spheres and find that now we have three c0 vectors and
three cD vectors. Translating these c vectors to O1 as the
common origin produces the beam diagram shown in
Figure 15.7B. Now we have three spots at O and three
spots at G. We will return to this topic in Chapter 24
when we discuss images of planar defects, but here let&rsquo;s
summarize the new concepts they give us
</p>
<p>&amp; The dispersion surface is a graphical approach to
thinking about Bloch waves.
</p>
<p>&amp; We have tomatch the components of any wave enter-
ing and leaving any surface, internal or external.
</p>
<p>&amp; Weuse the exit-surface tie line to link to the c spheres.
&amp; Having two inclined surfaces causes a splitting of the
Bragg beams.
</p>
<p>&amp; An internal interface, such as a stacking fault, increases
the number of points excited on the dispersion surfaces
and the number of spots at reflection G!
</p>
<p>To understand the importance of these ideas, try to
imagine what will happen when a defect, which is not
abrupt, is present in the crystal (more on this in Section
15.8).
</p>
<p>15.5 THE RELATION BETWEEN Ug, xg,
AND sg
</p>
<p>We can best appreciate the importance of the disper-
sion-surface construction by looking at Figure 15.4. This
figure shows the original spheres as dashed lines: they
are nearly flat close to the BZB. The electron beam is

<p>FIGURE 15.6. (A) The same diagram as Figure 15.4B, but for a wedge specimen with the top surface parallel to g (normal n1) and the bottom surface

<p>normal n2. Instead of exciting two points, O1 and O2, we excite twomore, D1 andD2, which correspond to the plane waves w0
(1), w0
</p>
<p>(2), outside the crystal. In
</p>
<p>(B) we relate all the beams to the point O1 andwe produce two beams at O and two at G. Thus we can predict that a wedge foil will give doublets at O andG.

<p>initially traveling with wave vector w outside the crystal.
When the beam enters the crystal the z component of
this wave vector changes (this is the refraction effect we
saw in Chapters 11 and 13), but the xy component is
unchanged. Therefore, the allowed k vectors in the
crystal are k(1) and k(2). One k vector begins on branch
1 and ends at O, while the other begins at branch 2 and
ends at O.
</p>
<p>Clearly we can draw in kg
(2) and kg
</p>
<p>(1) by adding g.Now,
how does k0
</p>
<p>(1), say, relate to K? The point K is also deter-
mined by the tie line through c, and lies on the circle
centered on O. Most importantly, neither k1 nor k2 is
equal to K. If you look back at equation 13.41 you can
see that
</p>
<p>k&eth;i&THORN;z � Kz &frac14; g&eth;i&THORN; (15:8)
</p>
<p>So g(i) is simply the distance of the point Mj from the K
sphere centered on O. We can write this relationship
explicitly

<p>BRANCHES AND BEAMS
There are only two k vectors because there are only
two branches of the dispersion surface. There are two
branches of the dispersion surface because we have a
crystal potential (hence Ug). There are only two
branches because we are considering only two beams.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Notice that the last term here is independent of i. Look
again at Figure 15.4. We can see that Dkz is a minimum
when M1 and M2 lie on the BZB. In that situation
</p>
<p>Dkzmin &frac14; g&eth;1&THORN; � g&eth;2&THORN; (15:11)
</p>
<p>Simply by looking at the diagram, and as expected from
Chapter 13, you also know that
</p>
<p>g&eth;1&THORN; � g&eth;2&THORN; &frac14; Ug

</p>
<p>&frac14; 1

</p>
<p>So
</p>
<p>Dkz &frac14;
1
</p>
<p>xg
(15:13)
</p>
<p>The origin of the thickness oscillations that we will
see in the two-beam TEM image is the difference in
wavelength of the two Bloch waves. It&rsquo;s the beating
between the two Bloch waves.
</p>
<p>Thus we see that the gap Dkz at the BZB is given by
the reciprocal of the extinction distance. We&rsquo;ll summar-
ize again to be quite sure that it is clear!
</p>
<p>&amp; We have a crystal, therefore Ug 6&frac14; 0.
&amp; SinceUg 6&frac14; 0 we have two branches to the dispersion
surface and hence a band gap.
</p>
<p>&amp; The bandgap is Dkz.
&amp; Hence we have a finite extinction distance (i.e., xg is
not infinite).
</p>
<p>An aside: think how seff and s would be related if xg
were infinite. (Go back to equation 13.47.)
</p>
<p>If the tie line M1M2 does not lie on the BZB then
when we draw the Ewald sphere centered just belowM1
(with radius of length 1/l or |K|) we see that sg is non-
zero. We can easily see from the equations in Section
13.10 that, in general, Dkz is given by
</p>
<p>Dkz &frac14; seff &frac14;
1
</p>
<p>xeff
(15:14)
</p>
<p>This equation is the key to understanding the origins of
the extinction distance and why the effective extinction
distance depends on the size of the excitation error, s. It
says that the band gap increases as we increase s. Look-
ing at it another way, as we move the tie line off the
BZB, the band gap Dk increases.
</p>
<p>Some questions raised here are
</p>
<p>&amp; What is the physical reason that Dkz is related to s?
&amp; What happens if g is not parallel to the foil surface
or, indeed, if the foil surfaces are not parallel to one
another?
</p>
<p>You can also appreciate why we had a problem defining
s when we first encountered it!
</p>
<p>15.6 THE AMPLITUDES OF BLOCHWAVES
</p>
<p>In Section 13.9, we found that the total wave function
for the two-beam case can be expressed as the sum of
two Bloch waves
</p>
<p>c r&eth; &THORN; &frac14; A&eth;1&THORN;b&eth;1&THORN; &thorn; A&eth;2&THORN;b&eth;2&THORN; (15:15)
</p>
<p>We showed that the relative contributions of the two
Bloch waves A(1) and A(2) are cos b/2 and sin b/2, respec-
tively; in addition, w = cotb = sxg.
</p>
<p>We also showed in Section 13.8 that
</p>
<p>b&eth;1&THORN; k&eth;1&THORN;; r

</p>
<p>&frac14; C&eth;1&THORN;0 e2pik

</p>
<p>&eth;1&THORN; &thorn; g&eth; &THORN; : r (15:16)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>b&eth;2&THORN; k&eth;2&THORN;; r
� �
</p>
<p>&frac14; C&eth;2&THORN;0 e2pik
&eth;2&THORN; : r &thorn; C&eth;2&THORN;g e2pi k
</p>
<p>&eth;2&THORN; &thorn; g&eth; &THORN; : r (15:17)
</p>
<p>The Bloch wave coefficients were given by equation set
13.31
</p>
<p>C0 &eth;1&THORN; C0 &eth;2&THORN; Cg &eth;1&THORN; Cg &eth;2&THORN;
</p>
<p>cosb/2 sinb/2 &ndash;sin b/2 cos b/2
</p>
<p>Now we can consider some special cases and exam-
ine the actual values for C0
</p>
<p>(1), A(1), etc. (Table 15.1).
For the Bragg case, sg=0, g is exactly excited and
</p>
<p>A
(1) and A(2) are both equal to 1/
</p>
<p>p
2. In other words, the
</p>
<p>two Bloch waves are equally excited.
For the case where sg&lt;0, we now have cos (b/2)&gt;sin
</p>
<p>(b/2) so that A(1) is greater than A(2). If we reverse the
sign of s, cos (b/2)&lt;sin (b/2) and A(1) is less than A(2).
</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s relate this information to the dispersion
surface shown in Figure 15.4. When sg&lt;0, as shown
here, the M1M2 tie line is to the left of the BZB, which

<p>is associated with reflectionG.When the tie line is closer
to O than G, Bloch wave 1 is more strongly excited; the
reverse is true when the tie line crosses the BZB. We
should remember that the analysis in Chapter 13 was for
a two-beam case, where we were close to the Bragg
condition. So this discussion of A(1) and A(2) only applies
to small values of s.
</p>
<p>15.7 EXTENDING TO MORE BEAMS
</p>
<p>If we allow more beams to contribute to the image,
we can imagine the dispersion surface for the case
where Ug = 0 by constructing more spheres, shown in
Figure 15.8. If we have n beams then we will have n
spheres. Note that each sphere is centered on its corre-
sponding reciprocal-lattice point and neighboring
spheres intersect periodically spaced BZBs. The gap
in Figure 15.3 always occurs at the BZB. The BZB itself
always corresponds to a plane which is the perpendi-
cular bisector of a g vector. Thus the diagram for &gt;2
beams shown in Figure 15.8 will become more compli-
cated with many band gaps and many branches as
shown in Figure 15.9. The magnitude of the band gap
does decrease as the rank of the neighboring branches
increases.
</p>
<p>In Chapter 27, we&rsquo;ll discuss what happens in images
when 3g is excited. We will actually consider the two-
beam condition where 0 and 3g are the two beams.
</p>
<p>We follow the convention used byMetherell and num-
ber the branches of the dispersion surface from top down.
</p>
<p>Then i = 1 corresponds to the branch with the highest
kinetic energy. Remember that all the electrons have the
same total energy in this treatment. You must also be
aware that some earlier texts number the top branch two
and the second branch one, following Hirsch et al. This
was fine when only two branches were considered.
</p>
<p>We can still associate the amplitudes C0, Cg, etc.,
with the sphere centered on 0, g, etc. The result is
shown by the labels C0, Cg, etc., in Figure 15.9. For

</p>
<p>centered on O, �G and �2G, etc.; C0 is &lsquo;normal&rsquo; to the sphere centered on O, while Cg is &lsquo;normal&rsquo; to the sphere centered on g, etc.
</p>
<p>15.7 EXTEND ING TO MORE BEAMS ......................................................................................................................................................... 253</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>example, imagine the original spheres centered on 0 and
g; they intersect on the BZBwhich passes through g/2 so
the C0, Cg are labeled as shown.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the spheres centered on 0 and 3g intersect on
the BZB which passes through 3g/2 soC0,C3g are labeled.
As a general rule, Cng will be largest for the pair of
reflections which are excited, i.e., 0 and ng and will be
related by the ng/2 BZB.
</p>
<p>We now extend these arguments to the situation where
many beams are excited. Values of C other than C0 and
Cng will be non-zero since it&rsquo;s no longer a two-beam case.
So the tie line M1M2 will then intersect many branches of
the dispersion surface. The reason these contributions
are smaller when g is excited is that they do not intersect
the 0 circle. However, they can contribute to the image.
Figure 15.9 shows how this can be visualized. (Remember
the dispersion surface is a way of visualizing Bloch wave
coefficients.) If we satisfy reflection 2G, then C0
</p>
<p>(1), C0
(2),
</p>
<p>C2g
(1), and C2g
</p>
<p>(2) are all large. The gap Dk4,5 between
branch 4 and branch 5 at G (on the BZB) is small; the
&lsquo;circles&rsquo; would have intersected in the vacuum. If we think
about the Ewald sphere we can show that the s values for
�g and 3g are identical. We&rsquo;ll see later (Chapter 26) that
these reflections will actually couple strongly, although
both are weakly excited and the extinction distance is
large (because the gap Dk4&ndash;5 is small). The extinction
distance for the coupling of �g and 3g when 2g is strongly
excited is x4g (x3g&ndash;(&ndash;g)). We can see this is true by looking
at the branch 4/5 gap on the BZB for G.
</p>
<p>15.8 DISPERSION SURFACES AND
DEFECTS
</p>
<p>The original reason for introducing the concept of Bloch
waves was that only Bloch waves can exist in a periodic
potential, i.e., there are no beams in the crystal. So what
happens when a defect is present? We&rsquo;ll discuss this
situation in some detail in Chapters 23&ndash;26 but will men-
tion the basic ideas here, emphasizing the Bloch waves
rather than the defects.
</p>
<p>In Section 15.4, we discussed the effect that a planar
fault can have on the Bloch waves using the dispersion-
surface representation. What we were actually doing
was matching the components parallel to the planar
defect, so the effect of the planar fault was to create
new tie lines n2. The general result is that, when a defect
is present, energy is transferred from one Bloch wave to
the other along the tie line; this is known as interband
scattering. This concept is not only important for our
understanding of images of planar defects but also illus-
trates a general principle for defects.
</p>
<p>The difficulty with non-planar defects is that the tie
lines are not so well defined. You can, however, imagine
the result: instead of having points on the dispersion sur-
face, we will have a distribution of points. We then relate
this distribution to the DP. We do this with the tie lines
normal to the exit surface and then translate to O1 in the
usual way. So, our distribution of points on the dispersion
surface will become a distribution of spots in the DP; this
distribution is what we will call a streak in Chapter 17.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Dispersion surfaces allow us to draw diagrams to represent the equations given in Chapter
14. These surfaces are essentially plots of the k vector of the Bloch waves (which is directly
related to the energy) versus the K vector. They correspond directly to the band diagrams,
which are used extensively to represent energy levels in semiconductors; the difference is that
in semiconductors, we emphasize energy by plotting energy versus reciprocal-lattice vector
(our K vector). The k vectors themselves vary because, although the total energy of each
electron is a constant, the potential energy decreases when the electron is close to the
nucleus, causing the kinetic energy to increase.
</p>
<p>Themost important equation for imaging theory is 15.14, which relatesDkz, seff, and xeff.
Notice that Dkz is defined for two Bloch waves but is only small when the Bragg equation is
nearly satisfied. This relationship links Bloch waves and Bragg beams. Dk is non-zero
because we have a crystal which produces a periodic potential. Dk gives rise to thickness
fringes and all thickness effects. Thus we see that thickness variations are due to the
interference, or beating, of pairs of Bloch waves. As we increase n, xg increases because
the gap between the two relevant branches of the dispersion surface becomes narrower.
Defects present in the crystal cause a mixing or coupling of the Bloch waves: they &lsquo;tie&rsquo; the
branches of the dispersion surface and cause interband scattering.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve emphasized throughout this chapter that the dispersion surface is a pictorial
representation of the k versusK relationship.We&rsquo;ll close by quoting the result derived byKato.
</p>
<p>In any wave field, the direction of energy flow is along the normal to the surface of the
dispersion surface. This result is equally valid for &lsquo;electron wave packets&rsquo; and other waves.
The physicist might say that the Poynting vector is normal to the dispersion surface.

<p>Although there are many texts that discuss dispersion surfaces and band gaps in
semiconductors, beware of the 2p/l versus 1/l problem since many of the texts are written
by, and for, physicists. Defect analysis using Bloch waves has generally been the preserve of
the physicist. However, there are some excellent programs available which use a Bloch-wave
approach analysis.
</p>
<p>We give the usual caveat: beware of black boxes.Metherell&rsquo;s article goes to greater depth
than covered here. However, it has been an inspiration formuch of this chapter and is highly
recommended for advanced study. It is beautifully written and explained, but is certainly
more advanced than our text. If you want to delve deeper into this topic, this is the article.

<p>Diffraction from Crystals
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Since our emphasis is on crystalline materials, we will first discuss how the details of the
crystal symmetry affect the DPs we expect to see. What we&rsquo;re doing here is taking the
concepts of the reciprocal lattice and applying it to particular examples. There are two basic
lessons.
</p>
<p>&amp; Youmust learn some of the rules that we will derive for particular crystal structures; one
example will be to determine which reflections are allowed for an fcc crystal.
</p>
<p>&amp; The other lesson is more general and is really concerned with why we have these rules.
Why are certain reflections absent or weak and how can you use this information to learn
more about your material?
</p>
<p>We can deduce some selection rules for different crystal structures that tell you which
reflections are allowed. We suggest you learn the most common ones by heart. Throughout
this chapter, we&rsquo;ll assume that the crystal is perfect and infinite, which it never is. In Chapter
17, we will examine what happens when we include defects or allow the diffracting crystal to
become relatively small. In Chapter 18, we&rsquo;ll go through the process of indexing experi-
mental DPs.
</p>
<p>16.1 REVIEW OF DIFFRACTION FROM A
PRIMITIVE LATTICE
</p>
<p>In Chapters 11&ndash;15, we examined diffraction from a
regular array of lattice points. We will now define such
an array as a primitive lattice where there is only one
lattice point in the unit cell. Actually, we did begin to
consider the present topic when we discussed the mean-
ing of n in the Bragg equation 2d sin yB= nl in Sections
11.5 and 12.4. We showed that the diffraction from the
(200) planes would give rise to a 200 reflection even
when there were only atoms on the (100) planes.
</p>
<p>By combining equations 13.3 and 13.4, we can see
that the amplitude of the diffracted beam is given by
</p>
<p>fg &frac14;
a ilFg
</p>
<p>Vc cos y
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>e�2piK � rne2piKD � r
</p>
<p>where Fg is the structure factor for the material. Since
the same type of atom was at each lattice point, we only
needed to consider one atomic scattering factor f in
Chapter 13. Now we are going to include different
types of atoms as we build up real crystal unit cells.
From Section 3.7 we know that f varies with the
</p>
<p>scattering angle. However, in this chapter we are going
to restrict ourselves to small values of y (excluding zero)
and will assume that we have fixed values of f; you can
easily extend this analysis to other scattering angles. For
convenience, we&rsquo;ve summarized some useful values of f
in Table 16.1.
</p>
<p>If you study the original paper of Ibers, from which
these data were taken, you will appreciate that these
numbers are not really well known. This is unfortunate
since much of our analysis depends on the values of f.
Furthermore, we have an additional reason for choos-
ing y not to be zero in Table 16.1 because these values
are even less reliable. Fortunately, what saves us is that
we are only interested in the details of the intensities in
some special cases and then the effects are really insen-
sitive to the precise value of f.
</p>
<p>We are just going to take these numbers and move
on, but you may want to investigate a little further.
Some points you should consider are
</p>
<p>&amp; Why are these numbers not better known? We dis-
cussed this topic in Chapters 2 and 3. The atomic
scattering factor is related to the differential scatter-
ing cross section (Section 3.7)

</p>
<p>(16:2)
</p>
<p>and the cross section is not well known at typical TEM
voltages.
</p>
<p>&amp; If the crystal is ionic, do we use f(y) for the atom or
for the ion?
</p>
<p>&amp; If the material is covalently bonded, how can we
incorporate the bonds into our scattering model?
</p>
<p>How we calculate f(y) depends on the model we use
to describe the atom. You can find more details in the
references at the end of the chapter, but beware, this is
not an easy topic.
</p>
<p>The simplest method is just to ignore any ionic char-
acter! If you look at Table 16.1, you&rsquo;ll see that if the atomic
number is large enough, then the change in f caused by
removing an electron may not be great. In ionic materials,
we form ions by removing or adding outer electrons so the
interaction of the electron beam with the nucleus is not
significantly affected.However, you should remember that
this argument applies only to f. We&rsquo;ll see in Part 4 that we
can detect differences between differently bonded atoms
using EELS. So, bonding does affect the electron beam.
</p>
<p>The overall effect of the covalent, i.e., directional,
component of the bonding is usually ignored. However,
as you realize, all the bonds in Si, for example, are
aligned along one particular type of crystallographic
direction so you may indeed be able to detect some
special features in the DPs.
</p>
<p>16.2 STRUCTURE FACTORS: THE IDEA
</p>
<p>In this section, we are building on Chapter 12. To keep
things simple, we will illustrate the concept of the struc-
ture factor for cubic crystals. If we have a simple-cubic
</p>
<p>crystal, then all possible values of g can give a reflection in
the DP. Each reciprocal-lattice point will then correspond
to a possible beam. The next step will be to add the basis
(i.e., the group of atoms associated with each lattice point)
to the primitive lattice. Since we still have the primitive
lattice, all of these points will still exist in the reciprocal
lattice but the reflections will be weighted. You will find
that there are three different ways to look at the situation,
which in fact are all equivalent
</p>
<p>&amp; Selection rules: This is perhaps closest to physics.
The structure of the crystal imposes certain selection
rules which determine which beams are allowed.
</p>
<p>&amp; Weights (or weighting factors): We can assign a
weight (which may be zero) to each of the points in
the reciprocal lattice. This is the terminology used by
Ewald. The nice feature about weighting factors is
that they are analogous to scattering factors.
</p>
<p>&amp; Structure factors (F): These are the unit-cell equiva-
lents of the atomic-scattering amplitude, f(y); they
can be thought of as unit-cell scattering amplitudes.
This is the terminology favored in materials science.
</p>
<p>There are two ways to address this topic:
</p>
<p>&amp; We can examine the physical idea of interference
as we did in Chapters 2 and 3. This approach can
give some useful guidelines to you, the experimen-
talist. For example, we&rsquo;ll see that the 200 reflec-
tion in Si should usually be absent; it should
always be present, though weak, in GaAs. Simi-
larly, in Ni3Al, the 100 reflection is weak, but in
Ni it is absent.
</p>
<p>&amp; Some materials have a special lattice in real space,
for example, fcc or bcc lattices. In these cases, we
can describe a corresponding special lattice in
reciprocal space. What this means is that certain
reflections are always forbidden for these particu-
lar structures; these are known as &lsquo;kinematically
forbidden&rsquo; reflections. (We&rsquo;ll see, however, that
they can be present due to dynamical scattering
events, and structure factors do not take any
account of dynamical scattering.) The reciprocal
lattice (of allowed reflections) of an fcc crystal is
bcc, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>In equation 13.1 we described the scattering from the
unit cell by the expression
</p>
<p>Acell &frac14;
e2pikr
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>fi y&eth; &THORN;e2piK � ri (16:3)
</p>
<p>What this equation says is that the atoms within the unit
cell all scatter with a phase difference given by 2piK � ri
where ri is a vector which defines the location of each
atom within the unit cell

This equation applies whether there is one atom or

<p>one hundred atoms in the unit cell, nomatter where they
are located, and it applies to all crystal lattices. What we
do next is simply insert the atomic coordinates into
equation 16.6 and calculate Fhkl.
</p>
<p>16.3 SOME IMPORTANT STRUCTURES:
BCC, FCC AND HCP
</p>
<p>We will now calculate the structure factor for bcc and
fcc crystals, because they illustrate the points we just
made in Section 16.2 and because, as a materials scien-
tist, you must know these results. You can regard the
reciprocal lattice in two ways
</p>
<p>&amp; The reciprocal lattice for bcc and fcc are themselves
special lattices.
</p>
<p>&amp; All reciprocal lattices of cubic materials are simple
cubic, but some of the lattice points have a zero
structure factor.
</p>
<p>Body-centered cubic: The bcc structure is particularly
easy. If we set the origin on one lattice point at (0, 0, 0),
the other lattice point is at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and we sub-
stitute these values of (x, y, z) into equation 16.6, then
</p>
<p>F &frac14; f 1&thorn; epi h&thorn;k&thorn;l&eth; &THORN;
n o
</p>
<p>(16:7)
</p>
<p>Now, since h, k, l are all integers, if we define the sum h
+ k+ l=N, then the exponential can take two values:
+1, for N even, and &ndash;1, for N odd.
</p>
<p>Thus, we can say that
</p>
<p>&amp; F = 2f if h + k + l is even,
&amp; F = 0 if h + k + l is odd.
</p>
<p>There are no other possibilities. The resulting
indexed bcc reciprocal lattice is shown in Figure 16.1.
This lattice of allowed reflections is face-centered cubic.
The reason it may not look like the familiar fcc lattice in
real space is that the indices in reciprocal space must all
be integers.
</p>
<p>Face-centered cubic: If we take the same approach
for the fcc structure, we now have to include four atoms
in the unit cell. We can view this cell as simple cubic with
a four-atom basis. The coordinates of the atoms are
</p>

<p>(16:8)
</p>
<p>Substituting these values for ri into equation 16.6 gives
</p>
<p>F &frac14; f 1&thorn; epi h&thorn;k&eth; &THORN; &thorn; epi h&thorn;l&eth; &THORN; &thorn; epi k&thorn;l&eth; &THORN;
n o
</p>
<p>(16:9)
</p>
<p>Again, we consider the possible values of the integers h,
k, l. If all three are either odd or even, then all of the
exponential terms are e2npi. Therefore, all the phases of
the diffracted waves aremultiples of 2p and are in phase.
However, if one of h, k, or l is odd but the other two
even, or vice versa, then two of the three phase factors
will be odd multiples of p giving two terms of &ndash;1 in
equation 16.9. Therefore
</p>
<p>&amp; F = 4f if h, k, l are all even or all odd,
&amp; F = 0 if h, k, l are mixed even and odd.
</p>
<p>The resulting lattice is shown in Figure 16.2. This
time the reciprocal lattice of allowed reflections is bcc
with all the indices being integers.
</p>
<p>Hexagonal close-packed: Generally DPs from hcp
crystals are more difficult to index for two reasons
</p>
<p>&amp; Except for (0001), the patterns can be different for
every material because the c/a ratio is different.

<p>&amp; We use the three-index notation to derive the struc-
ture-factor rules.
</p>
<p>&amp; We use the four-index Miller-Bravais notation to
index the lattice planes and thus the DPs.
</p>
<p>For the hcp structure, we only have to include two
atoms in the unit cell. We can view this cell as a simple
rhombohedral cell with a two-atom basis. The coordi-
nates of the atoms are

X; the complication is simply that X may be a fraction.
The analysis is quite straightforward if we consider |F|2,
which is what we need in the expression for intensities.
Then we can rearrange as follows.
</p>
<p>Fj j2&frac14; f 2 1&thorn; e2piX

� �
</p>
<p>(16:13)
</p>
<p>Now we can write down the rules for hcp which depend
mainly on whether or not h + 2k is a multiple of 3.
</p>
<p>&amp; |F|2 = 0 if h + 2k = 3m and l is odd,
&amp; |F|2 = 4f 2 if h + 2k = 3m and l is even,
&amp; |F|2 = 3f 2 if h + 2k = 3m � 1 and l is odd,
&amp; |F|2 = f 2 if h + 2k = 3m � 1 and l is even.
</p>
<p>Thus the 11�20 and 11�26 reflections will be strong but
the 11�23 reflection will be absent. Likewise 10�10 and 20�20
are weak but 30�30 is strong. Most importantly, 0001 is
absent. You can see that the four-index Miller-Bravais
notation takes some time to master. The third index is
only included to emphasize the symmetry; if the third
index were not included, you might not realize that, e.g.,
the (110) and &eth;1�20&THORN; are crystallographically equivalent.
</p>
<p>You need to know a few other expressions for this
system. If you are working with hcp materials, youmust
have a copy of Frank&rsquo;s (1965) paper on indexing this
system.
</p>
<p>If the direction [uvtw] lies in the plane (hkil), then we
can show that
</p>
<p>uh&thorn; vk&thorn; ti&thorn; wl &frac14; 0 (16:14)
</p>
<p>The normal to the plane (h,k,i,l) is actually the Car-
tesian vector [h,k,i,l/l], and likewise the crystallographic
direction [u,v,t,w] is actually the vector [u,v,t,lw] in the
Cartesian system. So using the four-index Cartesian
vector notation, equation 16.14 can be written as
</p>
<p>&frac12;u; v; t; lw�&frac12;h; k; i; l=l� &frac14; 0 (16:15)
</p>
<p>In cubic crystals, the direction [hkl] is always normal
to the plane (hkl), but this is not the case for hcp crystals.
You can show using some simple geometry that

</p>
<p>We can now write down an expression for the angle,
f, between two planes (hkil) and (defg).We use equation
16.17 to deduce the normals to the planes, then take the

that there are three crystallographically equivalent axes
x, y and u, and that the indices of any plane can be
written as (uviw) where i = (u + v).
</p>
<p>16.4 EXTENDING FCC AND HCP
TO INCLUDE A BASIS
</p>
<p>What we did in the previous section was to calculate the
reciprocal lattice of a simple-cubic crystal with a basis of
four atoms in fcc and two atoms in bcc. We can take this
analysis one step further by starting with fcc and adding a
basis. This extension both illustrates the technique and
deduces structure-factor rules for three importantmaterials.
</p>
<p>NaCl, GaAs, and Si: Each of these three crystal
structures is an fcc lattice with a basis. In other words,
we can separate out the atoms lying on the fcc lattice and
those which make up the basis.
</p>
<p>NaCl: Let&rsquo;s locate each of the Na atoms on an fcc
site; although NaCl is ionic, we&rsquo;ll refer to the ions as
atoms since we generally do not take account of the
charge on the ion.
</p>
<p>We usually say that for every Na atom, there is a Cl
atom related to it by the vector [1/2, 0, 0]. However, to
emphasize the cubic symmetry, we can choose the alter-
nate basis vector [1/2, 1/2, 1/2]. The phase factor for the
</p>
<p>Cl atomwill be the same as for the Na atom, but with an
additional phase of pi(h+ k+ l). Of course, the atomic
scattering amplitudes, f, are also different for the two
atoms. We can write this expression for F as
</p>
<p>F &frac14; fNa &thorn; fClepi h&thorn;k&thorn;l&eth; &THORN;
n o
</p>
<p>1&thorn; epi h&thorn;k&eth; &THORN; &thorn; epi h&thorn;l&eth; &THORN; &thorn; epi k&thorn;l&eth; &THORN;
n o
</p>
<p>(16:19)
</p>
<p>This again gives rise to some rules:
</p>
<p>&amp; F = 4(fNa + fC1) if h, k, l are all even,
&amp; F = 4(fNa � fC1) if h, k, l are all odd,
&amp; F = 0 if h, k, l are mixed.
</p>
<p>Clearly, the third condition is the same as for any fcc
structure because the factor with four terms is then zero,
exactly as we deduced for fcc. You can check this if you
imagine that fCl is zero. Whether the sign in (fNa � fC1) is
positive or negative is the new feature. What this means in
practice is that reflections with h, k, l all even will appear
muchmore intense in the DP than those with h, k, l all odd.
Lookat the values given for f inTable 16.1. LiF,KCl,MgO,
NiO, FeO, andErAs all have theNaCl structure. Since they
have different pairs of atomic-scattering amplitudes, the
term corresponding to 4(fNa � fC1) will be different in each
case. Reflections with h, k, and l all odd are thus sensitive to
the chemistry of the compoundandwe call them &lsquo;chemically
sensitive reflections.&rsquo; We will see further examples in Chap-
ter 29 of how this sensitivity can be used in imaging.
</p>
<p>GaAs: You should repeat the above exercise with
the Ga located on the fcc lattice and the As related
to it by the basis vector [1/4, 1/4, 1/4]. (Crystallogra-
phers will immediately note that this puts the As atom
in the tetrahedron instead of the octahedron as
found in NaCl.) Now the expression for F becomes
(see equation 16.9 for Ffcc)
</p>
<p>F &frac14; fGa &thorn; fAse
p
2
i h&thorn;k&thorn;l&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>n o
</p>
<p>Ffcc (16:20)
</p>
<p>So the rules are slightly more complicated:
</p>
<p>&amp; F=0 if h, k, l aremixed as always for fcc,
&amp; F = 4(fGa � i fAs) if h, k, l are all odd,
&amp; F = 4(fGa � fAs) if h, k, l are all even and h+k+l
</p>
<p>= 2N where N is odd (e.g., the
200 reflection),
</p>
<p>&amp; F = 4(fGa + fAs) if h, k, l are all even and h+k+l
= 2N where N is even (e.g., the
400 reflection).
</p>
<p>You can appreciate the difference between the
200 reflection and the 400 reflection by drawing a pro-
jection onto the (001) plane and applying the physical
ideas we discussed in Chapter 11. The case where all
three indices are odd is interesting. However, for this
case remember that we only see intensities (i.e., |F|2 not
F) so |F|2 is 16(fGa
</p>
<p>2 + fAs
2) and is independent of the

<p>sign initially present. Of course, the structure factor is
still different from the others derived here.
</p>
<p>Si: Now we can easily extend this analysis to Si, Ge,
or diamond. Just replace both fGa and fAs in our results
by fSi. The major change is that F is zero when h+k+l
= 2N and N is odd. The best known example of this is
again the 200 reflection. For Si andGe, it has F=0, but
F is finite for GaAs.
</p>
<p>Now for &lsquo;hcp.&rsquo;
Wurtzite: The wurtzite structure is to hcpwhatGaAs
</p>
<p>(or zinc blende) is to fcc! It is an important structure
because it includes BeO, ZnO, AlN, and GaN, all of
which have been widely studied. We can think of it as
adding a second hcp lattice displaced by [1/3, 1/3, 1/8] or
[0, 0, 3/8] relative to the first. The problem is that we
now have a four-atom basis because the second atom in
the hcp cell does not lie at a lattice site. This is a good
exercise for Section 16.8, if you look ahead.
</p>
<p>16.5 APPLYING THE BCC AND FCC
ANALYSIS TO SIMPLE CUBIC
</p>
<p>Extending bcc to NiAl (B2): For this material, we can
easily modify the original treatment of the bcc structure,
since now the centering atom is different, so NiAl is
simple cubic. If we choose to place the Ni atom at (0,
0, 0) and the Al atoms at [1/2, 1/2, 1/2], then
</p>
<p>F &frac14; fNi &thorn; fAlepi h&thorn;k&thorn;l&eth; &THORN;
n o
</p>
<p>(16:21)
</p>
<p>This leads to two values for F, neither of which is zero.
</p>
<p>&amp; F = fNi + fAl if h + k + l is even,
&amp; F = fNi � fAl if h + k + l is odd.
</p>
<p>This would, of course, be the bcc result if fNi and fAl
were the same. The result of this difference is that all of
the reflections for NiAl will be present in aDP because F
is never zero. This result is, of course, exactly what we
would expect, because NiAl really is simple cubic. Other
materials with this structure include CsCl, CoGa, FeAl,
and CuZn. Reflections like (100) are chemically sensi-
tive for NiAl.
</p>
<p>The Cu3Au (L12) structure: There are many impor-
tant ordered intermetallics with this structure such as
Al3Li and Fe3Al. The most important is Ni3A1 (because
of its role in Ni-base superalloys). We can treat Ni3Al in
a similar manner to NiAl. Here the Al atom sits on the
(0, 0, 0) site and the three Ni atoms center the faces. The
expression for F now becomes
</p>
<p>F &frac14; fAl &thorn; fNi e
pi h&thorn;k&eth; &THORN; &thorn; epi h&thorn;l&eth; &THORN; &thorn; epi k&thorn;l&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>n o
</p>
<p>(16:22)
</p>
<p>The rules for Ni3Al are
</p>
<p>&amp; F = (fA1 + 3fNi) if h, k, l are all even or all odd.
&amp; F = (fA1 � fNi) if h, k, l are mixed.
</p>
<p>Again, all of the possible reciprocal-lattice points for
Ni3Al will give rise to Bragg reflections because the
structure is really simple cubic. The mixed hkl reflec-
tions are now the chemically sensitive reflections. This
material is particularly interesting since it can be heat-
treated so as to randomize the distribution of the two
elements; then each site will be occupied by 75% Ni,
25% Al, and F for mixed hkl will be zero. For this
reason, reflections with mixed hkl are referred to as
superlattice reflections (see Section 16.7).
</p>
<p>16.6 EXTENDING HCP TO TiAl
</p>
<p>The TiAl structure is not as well known as the previous
two cases, but illustrates a similar class of materials. We
noted in Section 16.4 that the two atoms in the hcp
structure are not equivalent. In TiAl, we actually make
them chemically distinct too. This means that the rules
for hcp will be modified again. Using equation 16.11, we
find that
</p>
<p>F &frac14; fTi &thorn; fAle
2pi h
</p>
<p>3
&thorn;2 k
</p>
<p>3
&thorn; l
</p>
<p>2&eth; &THORN; (16:23)
</p>
<p>The most important result is that the (0001) reflection is
now allowed since F= fTi � fAl. TiAl really does have a
primitive hexagonal unit cell.
</p>
<p>16.7 SUPERLATTICE REFLECTIONS
AND IMAGING
</p>
<p>The reciprocal lattices for Ni3Al and NiAl are shown in
Figure 16.4; the small circles indicate the chemically
sensitive reciprocal-lattice points. The terminology
which has developed calls the chemically sensitive reflec-
tions superlattice reflections; the idea is that the fcc
lattice is viewed as the lattice and the chemically sensi-
tive reflections then lie on a lattice with a finer scale in
reciprocal space. The chemically sensitive superlattic
reflections are all forbidden in the disordered fcc
structure.
</p>
<p>Superlattice reflections are those present because the
material is ordered such that the actual real-space unit
cell is larger and thus the reciprocal-space cell is smaller.
</p>
<p>For many years, these superlattice reflections were
regarded as a special feature in some unusual materials.
However, ordered materials, particularly the ordered
intermetallics which we mentioned in Section 16.4, are
finding increased uses.Wewill illustrate the wide variety
of superlattice effects by selecting some examples.
</p>
<p>Figure 16.5 shows an image from Cu3Au, the arche-
typal A3B ordered fcc structure. The crystal has been

<p>irradiated with ions so that small regions known as
cascades have been damaged just enough that the Cu
and Au have been mixed up, i.e., the ordering has been
destroyed locally (Jenkins et al.). The DF image has
been formed using the 110 reflection, which we know
is a superlattice reflection. By destroying the ordering,
</p>
<p>we &lsquo;destroy&rsquo; the superlattice reflection for the disordered
region, so the disordered region appears black when the
ordered matrix appears bright. Thus, we can &lsquo;see&rsquo; the
disordered region, measure its size, etc., even though it is
not diffracting electrons. The dark bands between the
domains are inclined anti-phase domain boundaries
(APBs), a specific kind of planar defect which we&rsquo;ll
examine in more detail in Section 24.6.
</p>
<p>Figure 16.6A and B shows a 002 DF image and the
corresponding DP from aGaAs/AlxGa1�xAs quantum-
well structure. The AlxGa1�xAs appears lighter than the
GaAs because the 002 reflection is a superlattice reflec-
tion; remember, it would be forbidden for GaAs if fGa
and fAswere equal. The reason the AlxGa1�xAs appears
lighter is that we have replaced a fraction x of the Ga
atoms with the lighter Al atoms, thus increasing the
difference fIII � fV. Clearly, this is a classic example of
chemically sensitive reflections. At this point we should

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>remind you about intensities in images and DPs. The
discussion we have just gone through assumes that we
have a thin specimen, so that we are within the first
thickness zone (i.e., the specimen is thinner than one
extinction distance). In other words, be wary of trying to
be quantitative about these intensities since superlattice
beams are also dynamically diffracted.
</p>
<p>Our third example is from a ceramic, vanadium
carbide. The structure of VC is the same as for NaCl
so we already have the rules. However, this carbide is
usually non-stoichiometric, having the composition
VxCy, where x &gt; y. The two images and DPs shown in
Figure 16.7 were taken from well-ordered V6C5 and
V8C7 where 1/6 and 1/8 of the carbon sites are not
occupied by C: we say these sites are occupied by vacan-
cies and the vacancies have formed ordered arrays.
Clearly since we only have four atoms of each element
in the unit cell, the vacancies must be distributed over
more than one cell so the new lattice parameter must be
greater than the lattice parameter (a) of the VC fcc
lattice. So, we expect to see extra spots that are closer
to the origin than (001). This is the case in both patterns
shown here. The ordering actually destroys the cubic
</p>
<p>symmetry, so we have several orientations of the
ordered carbides that are related to one another by the
way they break the symmetry. By forming DF images,
we can identify which region of the specimen corre-
sponds to which variant (Dodsworth et al.).
</p>
<p>16.8 DIFFRACTION FROM LONG-PERIOD
SUPERLATTICES
</p>
<p>In the previous section, the atoms or vacancies in the
different structures essentially arranged themselves to
increase the lattice parameter and therefore give rise to
superlattice reflections. In this section, we will discuss
several examples where either we (or nature) have
arranged the materials to give much larger superlattices.
We will begin by considering the image and DP shown
in Figure 16.8, which are from an artificial GaAs/Alx-
Ga1�xAs superlattice. The superlattice is created chemi-
cally by changing from four layers of GaAs to four of
(AlxGa1�x)As. So we see a series of three closely spaced
extra spots in the DP which correspond to the new long
lattice parameter in real space.
</p>
<p>Another example is shown in Figure 16.9. This is a
very long period (�10 nm) artificial superlattice of alter-
nating layers of Si and Mo. The extra reflections
are very close and are not as useful as they were in
Figure 16.6, but they do allow us to check the periodic-
ity of the real-space structure very easily and quickly
and without needing to use HRTEM (Chapter 28). This
can be useful, particularly for artificially grown super-
lattices, since the superlattice periodicity is &lsquo;internally
calibrated&rsquo; in the DP by the lattice spacing of the mate-
rial. (Remember that, for comparison, the magnifica-
tion of a TEM image is usually subject to a �10%
uncertainty.)

<p>16.9 FORBIDDEN REFLECTIONS
</p>
<p>Wementioned in Section 16.2 that certain reflections are
always forbidden for some structures because they have
F=0. They are known as kinematically forbidden reflec-
tions, because such reflections can sometimes actually be
present due to dynamical scattering events. This process
is illustrated in Figure 16.10. The DP is the [011] pattern
in Si so that the 200 reflection should be absent according
to Section 16.4. The reason it is usually present is that,
since we are oriented at the zone axis, the 11�1 beam,
which has F 6&frac14; 0, acts like a new incident beam and is
rediffracted by the (1�11) plane. The result is that we
appear to excite the 200 reflection since
</p>
<p>&eth;11�1&THORN; &thorn; &eth;1�11&THORN; &frac14; &eth;200&THORN; (16:24)
</p>
<p>From this example, you can appreciate the use of the
phrase &lsquo;kinematically forbidden.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>16.10 USING THE INTERNATIONAL
TABLES
</p>
<p>As long as you work with fcc or bcc metals or the other
special structures listed here, you can use the simple
rules derived in this chapter. Once you venture further,
</p>
<p>you should quickly become familiar with the Interna-
tional Tables for Crystallography (Hahn), in particular
with the introductory booklet. You must know the
crystal structure of your material; if not, you will in
principle be able to determine it after studying Chapter
21. If, for example, you were working with a-Al2O3, you

thick. (B) Expanded DP around 000 showing many superlattice spots

<p>(arrowed). The large spacing of the superlattice in real space results in
</p>
<p>very small spacing of the superlattice reflections in the DP in reciprocal
</p>
<p>space. Compare with Figure 16.8.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 16.10. The [011] DP from Si. The 200 reflection is forbidden,
</p>
<p>but it is present because the allowed 11�1 diffracted beam acts like a new
</p>
<p>incident beam and is rediffracted by the (1�11) plane. The sum of the two
</p>
<p>allowed reflections (11�1) + (1�11) results in a 200 reflection, which is so
</p>
<p>weak you may not see it.

<p>would know that the space group is R�3c or No. 167.
Looking this up in the International Tables, you would
find the information shown in Figure 16.11A. In this
case, you&rsquo;d have to decide whether you want to use
rhombohedral axes or hexagonal axes; you&rsquo;ll notice
that there are three times as many atoms in the hexago-
nal cell. The tables in Figure 16.11B tell you which
</p>
<p>reflections are allowed, although you can work out or
look up the values of F if you want them. You know the
chemical formula of your material, but you still need to
know which sites are occupied. Look up the positions
from X-ray diffraction data. The paper by Lee and
Lagerlof summarizes the analysis for this particular
example.

<p>That was the traditional approach. Now, you
should have access to EMS or Crystal Kit. Alterna-
tively, use jEMS over the WWW (Section 1.6). In all
</p>
<p>these software packages you can just type in your space
group or pull down a menu to find the structure-factor
information.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
When we introduced the primitive lattice at the beginning of this chapter, we only con-
sidered the lattice sites which actually define the unit cell. If there are other lattice points,
these would give us the Bravais lattices. We will conclude by summarizing some of the
selection rules for the different structures in Table 16.2.
</p>
<p>In practice, it will become important that you simply know some of the DPs for your
material. You can, however, look up these patterns in some of the textbooks listed in
Chapter 1, but the best sources are the texts by Andrews et al. and Edington; we reproduce
some of them in Figures 18.17&ndash;18.19. Alternatively, software (e.g., jEMS) available on the
WWW (Section 1.5) will print out standard spot patterns of most important crystal
structures. When you&rsquo;re sitting at the TEM, you don&rsquo;t have time to index a pattern from
first principles and then decide whether or not you are at a pole that contains the reflection
you want to use. To do this you&rsquo;ll have to be able to index the DPs and determine the beam
direction, which we&rsquo;ll describe in detail in Chapter 18.
</p>

</p>
<p>Diffraction from Small Volumes
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>A very important concept in TEM is that we only ever diffract from small volumes. These
volumes are now called nanoparticles, nanograins, nanobelts, etc. By definition, no TEM
specimen is infinite in all directions and all defects are small. Of course, the beam is also
never infinitely wide! This chapter therefore discusses how the size of what we are examining
influences the appearance of the DP. Although we will discuss many different aspects of
diffraction, there are three important ideas that underlie all this discussion
</p>
<p>&amp; We are diffracting from small volumes.
&amp; We are diffracting from crystals.
&amp; We need to index the DPs we see and relate the patterns to the image.
</p>
<p>The fact that it is possible to obtain diffraction from several planes in a zone at the same
time is due to the effect of the specimen shape on the diffracted-intensity distribution. The
diffraction spot is only a mathematical point if the specimen is perfect and infinite in all
directions. For example, a TEM specimen is effectively infinite (�3 mm) relative to the unit-
cell dimensions in the plane of the specimen, but very thin (&lt; 0.5 mm) parallel to the electron
beam. This means that the diffracted intensity can be represented in the reciprocal lattice as
a relrod (see Chapter 12) stretched parallel to the electron beam in reciprocal space, rather
than as a point, and the relrod does have a width. Therefore, over a range of angles, the
Ewald sphere will still intercept the relrod and diffracted intensity will still be generated.
This is equivalent to saying that the Laue condition is relaxed in one dimension in the TEM
owing to the specimen shape. For this reason, accurate structural analysis of unknown
specimens is very difficult in conventional TEMdiffraction, andX-rays are usually themost
accurate method for structure determination if your specimen is large. However, we will
reconsider this statement in Chapter 21.
</p>
<p>17.1 INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>In Chapter 12, we stated that each point in the recipro-
cal lattice can actually be associated with a rod. This
construction allowed us to discuss the geometry of DPs,
taking account of the experimental fact that we see spots
in the DP even when s is not exactly zero. In fact, with-
out this construction, there is no reason to discuss s.
Now we are going to show quantitatively why we have
rods. As we suggested earlier, the reason is that we have
a thin specimen: a small thickness in real space gives a
large length in reciprocal space. This concept is valid in
all directions, not just parallel to the electron beam.
Hence, we call this the &lsquo;shape effect.&rsquo; The intensity in
the diffracted beam is strongest for a given thickness
</p>
<p>when K &frac14; g, but we still have intensity when K is not
exactly equal to g, or when
</p>
<p>K &frac14; g&thorn; s (17:1)
</p>
<p>Then we can write, from equation 13.48

</p>
<p>We model the specimen as a thin rectangular slab as
shown in Figure 17.1. To keep the math simple, we will
assume that we have a rectangular unit cell with sides a,
b, c and that there are Nx cells in the x direction, Ny in

<p>the y direction andNz in the z direction. All that we have
to do to determine the total diffracted amplitude is to
add the amplitudes from each cell, allowing for the
phase factor that is present, because the cells are dis-
placed from one another. Each cell has the same struc-
ture factor F.
</p>
<p>We can do the addition of amplitudes in two ways.
The first way is to do the summation. In the second, we
will show how the same result follows if you start with
the integral expression for fg. These expressions lead to
the important idea of a relrod and subsidiarymaxima; in
DPs we can see the effects of the relrods, but you may
never see the subsidiary maxima.
</p>
<p>What we are going to do is derive equations for the
shape of the relrods which were introduced in Section
12.5 and which we used in Chapter 13 to explain why we
&lsquo;see&rsquo; spots in the DP even when s 6&frac14; 0. This whole
approach gives us a pictorial aid to understanding dif-
fraction from small volumes. After developing the the-
ory for the simple case, we will go on to discuss the
complications introduced because we look at real mate-
rials, and specimens of real materials are usually not flat
platelets.
</p>
<p>17.1.A The Summation Approach
</p>
<p>This approach starts with expressing the total ampli-
tude, A, of the diffracted beam as the sum of contribu-
tions from all the individual cells in a parallel-sided
specimen. (Note: this is a kinematical approach and
ignores dynamical scattering.)
</p>
<p>A &frac14; F
X
</p>
<p>nx
</p>
<p>ei 2pnxK�a
X
</p>
<p>ny
</p>
<p>ei 2pnyK�b
X
</p>
<p>nz
</p>
<p>ei 2pnzK�c (17:3)
</p>
<p>Here nx, ny and nz have their usual meanings and all are
integers; we haveNx�Ny�Nz cells in the specimen. As
shown in Figure 17.1, we will let nx vary from 0 to Nx&ndash;1
and similarly with ny and nz. The location of each unit
cell is then defined by the vector rn
</p>
<p>rn &frac14; nxa&thorn; nyb&thorn; nzc (17:4)
</p>
<p>To simplify the first summationwe setX equal to ei2pK �a.
Then each separate summation term is a geometric se-
ries, so we can sum the nx series as
</p>
<p>S &frac14;
P
</p>
<p>nx&frac14;Nx�1
</p>
<p>nx&frac14;0
</p>
<p>X n &frac14; X 0 &thorn; X 1 &thorn; :::X Nx�1
</p>
<p>SX &frac14; X 1 &thorn; X 2 &thorn; :::X Nx &frac14; X Nx � X 0 &thorn; S
</p>
<p>S &frac14;
1� XNx
</p>
<p>1� X
</p>
<p>(17:5)
</p>
<p>Now replace X by ei2pK�a to find the sum.
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>nx&frac14;Nx�1
</p>
<p>nx&frac14;0
</p>
<p>ei 2pnxK�a &frac14;
1� ei 2pNxK�a
</p>
<p>1� ei 2pK�a
(17:6)
</p>
<p>Since we are interested in the intensities, wemultiply this
sum by its complex conjugate. To do this we use some
simple trigonometric relationships

<p>Equation 17.9 is the basis of the shape effect and leads
to the idea of the relrod, which you recall is the
name we give to a reciprocal-lattice rod (look back at
Section 12.5).
</p>
<p>17.1.B The Integration Approach
</p>
<p>If we take equation 13.2, which is the amplitude dif-
fracted by a single unit cell, and sum this over all the
cells in the specimen, the amplitude of the diffracted
beam can be written as
</p>
<p>fg &frac14;
e2pik�r
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>Fne
�2piK�rn&eth; &THORN; (17:12)
</p>
<p>Since we have defined K to be g+ s, we can rewrite this
equation as
</p>
<p>fg &frac14;
e2pik�r
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>Fge
�2pi g&thorn;sg&eth; &THORN;�rn&eth; &THORN; (17:13)
</p>
<p>Now we know that g�rn is an integer by the definition of
g and rn and we will refer to sg as s. Hence we can write
equation 17.13 as
</p>
<p>fg &frac14;
e2pik � r
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>Fge
�2pis � rn&eth; &THORN; (17:14)
</p>
<p>where s is the deviation parameter for reflection g. If
we make the approximation that the crystal contains
many unit cells, we can replace this sum by an inte-
gral to give
</p>
<p>fg &frac14;
e2pik � r
</p>
<p>rVc
Fg
</p>
<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>crystal
</p>
<p>e �2pis � rn&eth; &THORN;dv (17:15)
</p>
<p>This is where the present treatment differs from the first.
If we now express s and rn as the vectors
</p>
<p>s &frac14; ua� &thorn; vb� &thorn; wc� (17:16)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>rn &frac14; ha&thorn; kb&thorn; lc (17:17)

<p>then we can write

</p>
<p>(D is an unimportant phase factor.) The intensity is then
as given by equation 17.9, but we have explicitly kept the
r�2 and Vc
</p>
<p>�2 dependence for the intensities.
You should recognize the form of equations 17.9 and
</p>
<p>17.20. These equations have the same form as that given
back in equation 2.12 for diffraction from a diffraction
grating. The corresponding diffraction grating has Nx
lines which are spaced a distance a apart. The physical
similarity is that the grating, just like our crystal, has a
finite size.
</p>
<p>17.2 THE THIN-FOIL EFFECT
</p>
<p>Equation 17.9 is very important for TEM. It tells us
why the relrods we introduced in Chapter 12 have a
finite length if we measure them to the first minimum.
It also tells us that the diffracted intensity does depend on
the value of s; it is not a constant for any position along the
rod.
</p>
<p>We can better appreciate this variation along the rod if
we plot the intensity and draw theEwald sphere, as shown
in Figure 17.2. We only draw the intensity plot for one
direction at a time. This diagram shows the Ewald sphere
cutting the relrod on one side while showing the intensity
along the relrod on the right-hand plot.
</p>
<p>Figure 17.2 is an extension of Ewald&rsquo;s &lsquo;pictorial
representation&rsquo; of diffraction. We can now draw the
reciprocal lattice as shown for a simple-cubic crystal in
Figure 17.3, such that every point is replaced by a relrod
and every relrod is described by equation 17.9. If the
surface of the crystal is exactly parallel to the (112)
plane, but we orient the specimen slightly off the [001]
pole, then the Ewald sphere cuts the relrod as different
positions relative to the square array of spots, which is
the projection of the spots at zero tilt (Figure 17.3B).
The DP will appear as shown in Figure 17.3C. In Figure
17.3C, C is the projected position of the center of the
</p>
<p>RELRODS AND INTENSITY
Just remember that when we said &lsquo;&lsquo;the intensity&rsquo;&rsquo; we
meant &lsquo;&lsquo;the intensity which the diffracted beam will
have if s takes a particular value; i.e., if the Ewald
sphere cuts the relrod at that point.&rsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>17.2 THE THIN -FO IL EFFECT ................................................................................................................................................................... 273</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ewald sphere. As an exercise, consider whether the
pattern would differ if the surface were cut slightly off
(001) but oriented at the [001] pole. Then repeat the first
exercise but instead of tilting the specimen, tilt the elec-
tron beam through the same small angle.
</p>
<p>Remember that we deduced equation 17.9 by simply
adding the amplitudes from all the unit cells, taking the
position of the cells into account.
</p>
<p>We calculated a &lsquo;structure factor&rsquo; for the whole
volume which contributes to fg: we call this calculated
factor the shape factor.
</p>
<p>We should then use this shape factor rather than the
structure factor (since F is included in equation 17.9) in
our dynamical calculations of fg. The problem is, of
course, that the shape factor can be different for every
specimen we examine.
</p>
<p>We have just deduced a method for picturing how the
shape of a perfect parallelepiped (of sides Nx a, Ny b and
Nz c) affects theDP.Now for the next step, wewill use this
conceptof the shape factor to examinehow theDPswill be
affected bymore complex shapes, such as thewedge shape
ofmany real TEMspecimens or the perfect parallelepiped
of the stacking fault. Then we will consider defects which
themselvesdonothavesharpboundaries; thedislocation is
a perfect example of such an imperfection.
</p>
<p>17.3 DIFFRACTION FROM WEDGE-
SHAPED SPECIMENS
</p>
<p>MostTEMspecimens donot have parallel surfaces but are
wedge-shaped. In drawing the relrods for such a wedge-
shaped specimen, we extend the results of Section 17.2
</p>
<p>by saying that the relrod will always be normal to the
surface. So, for a wedge-shaped specimen (Figure 17.4A)
wemust have two relrods as shown in Figure 17.4B.What
we see in the DP is determined by how the Ewald sphere
cuts these two relrods. As shown in Figure 17.4C and D,
we will see two spots which lie along a line which is normal
to the edge of the wedge. Notice that all the pairs of spots
are aligned in the same direction as we expected and that
their separation is larger for larger values of s. This simple
relrod model predicts that we would see only one spot if
s&frac14; 0. In fact, we should see two or more spots because the
relrod model fails when we are in a strongly dynamical
diffraction condition. We will return to this point in the
next section and again in Chapter 24.

<p>17.4 DIFFRACTION FROM PLANAR
DEFECTS
</p>
<p>The shape factor concept can be readily applied to
understand diffraction from a flat platelet or planar
fault. The geometry is shown in Figure 17.5. The idea
is that the platelet is itself a thin parallelepiped which is
inclined to the specimen parallelepiped (Figure 17.5A).
The result is that we have two relrods, one normal to the
specimen surface and a much longer one normal to the
thin platelet (Figure 17.5B and C). When we cut these
relrods with the Ewald sphere we produce two spots in
theDP and, as for the wedge specimen, the separation of
the spots increases with increasing s. The line MN lies
normal to the trace of the platelet. There are, however,
some differences in this case. Although the m and n
relrods are very different in length and actual intensity,
</p>
<p>the diffracting volume is much greater for the specimen
than for the platelet. Thus, we can usually distinguish
reflections M and N.
</p>
<p>Providing we know the orientation of the specimen
relative to the DP, we can tell whether the inclination
angle is less than or greater than 908; i.e., we can deter-
mine the inclination of the planar defect withoutmoving
the specimen or using any theory of image contrast (see
Chapter 24). As in Section17.3, we would actually see
two spots when s &frac14; 0 if we could make the spots small
enough. We&rsquo;ll return to this topic in Section 17.7.
</p>
<p>A stacking fault in an fcc crystal can be thought of as
a very thin platelet of hcp material as shown in Figure
17.6; so it really is a platelet with perfect lattice matching
parallel to its surface.
</p>
<p>We can understand diffraction effects from other
planar interfaces by considering two cases
</p>
<p>&amp; If the grains on either side of the interface contain a
common reflection, then the diffraction effects can
be modeled by the thin platelet.
</p>
<p>&amp; In the case where a reflection is not common to the
two grains, then for that reflection the diffracting
crystal behaves like a wedge specimen with one sur-
face parallel to the planar defect. We can ignore the
crystal that is not diffracting.
</p>
<p>The two DPs in Figure 17.7 show that you really do
see pairs of spots for these two types of boundary. As

</p>
<p>that when s&lt; 0, relrod 1 is on the left of relrod 2 but the order reverses
</p>
<p>when s becomes&gt; 0. The effect of this pair of relrods is to create a doublet
</p>
<p>shown in (C) and (D). The middle spot is the matrix relrod for a parallel-
</p>
<p>sided thin foil and is absent for the wedge in A.

</p>
<p>tions in (B) and (C).

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>before, the two spots lie normal to the boundary traces,
i.e., the intersection of the boundary with the surface of
the specimen.
</p>
<p>There are two reasons for emphasizing the extra
spots which are present because of the interface
</p>
<p>&amp; You should always check that any extra spots you
see cannot be explained in this way.
</p>
<p>&amp; You must be careful when determining spot spacing
(as when estimating lattice parameters). You must
set s to zero for this purpose and that can usually
only be done for a few reflections at any time (one
reflection always being O, not D, of course).
</p>
<p>Twin boundaries are often found to consist of flat
segments in particular orientations. The first-order twin
boundary in fcc crystals tends to facet parallel to the
common {111} plane as shown schematically in Figure
17.8A. This means that if we orient the specimen so that
this common plane is nearly parallel to the beam, we will
excite the common {111} reflection. Now our platelet is
parallel to the beam so that its relrod is normal to the
beam. If the specimen is also thin, we can arrange that
the Ewald sphere cuts along the length of the relrod.
Now, as we can see in Figure 17.8B, we see a &lsquo;streak&rsquo; in
the DP rather than a spot. The streak actually extends
from in the [111] direction because, as you can appreci-
ate from Figure 17.8A, the twin is a very thin platelet.

<p>FROM NANOPARTICLES
Since we&rsquo;ll only detect any effect when the particle is
�100 nm, these particles could be called nanoparti-
cles. Anyone working with such particles must
understand this effect which is closely related to
Debye-Scherrer analysis in XRD.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If we regard the surface as a planar defect, we can
also observe extra spots in the DP due to a reconstruc-
tion of the surface. One factor to be cautious about is
that the apparent reconstruction might be influenced by
contamination since the TEM is not generally a UHV
system.
</p>
<p>17.5 DIFFRACTION FROM PARTICLES
</p>
<p>Particles come in all shapes and sizes, so we will not try
to be exhaustive. Actually, the principle involved in
determining the shape factor in reciprocal space is sim-
ply &lsquo;small becomes large&rsquo; and vice versa. The shape
factors are shown schematically for several particles in
Figure 17.9. You should be aware that you will prob-
ably never see the subsidiary minima shown in these
diagrams.
</p>
<p>One example which is common is the platelet shown
in Figure 17.10; these can occur as GP zones or other
</p>
<p>thin disk-shaped precipitates. When the platelets are
oriented parallel to the beam, we see streaks in the DP
just as we saw them in Figure 17.8B. The difference in
this figure is that the platelets can lie on all the crystal-
lographically equivalent planes in the crystal. For these
GP zones they lie on {001} planes so the streaks run in
&lt;001&frac14; directions for the cubic crystal connecting, for
example, 000 and 200. You should notice that these
spots would still be connected if the crystal were not
cubic. You&rsquo;ll also see that there is a sharp point at the
100 position even though 100 is not an allowed reflec-
tion for bcc crystals. The reason we see this spot is that
we are cutting the relrod which runs parallel to the
electron beam in the [001] direction.
</p>
<p>The smallest &lsquo;particle&rsquo; can be thought of as a
vacancy, a substitutional atom or an interstitial atom.
Wewill not expect to see any clear effect of a single point
defect but, as we saw in Section 16.7, these point defects
can order to give a clear superlattice, and therefore extra
spots.
</p>
<p>As you might expect then, if we have many point
defects but not enough to give long-range order, we
might expect short-range ordering. Perhaps the clearest
example of this phenomenon again occurs in the metal
carbides. The effect is shown in Figure 17.11. The short-
range ordering gives rise to diffuse scattering in the DP
which at first appears quite random, sometimes as cir-
cles around the spots and appearing at other times as
circles between spots or not circles at all! By combining
many different patterns, Sauvage and Parthé proposed
that the diffuse scattering could be mapped out as
shown in Figure 17.11D. This figure strongly resembles
a Fermi surface diagram which you may have encoun-
tered in condensed-matter physics. We will discuss some
aspects of imaging using diffusely scattered electrons in
Section 29.4, but the important points to recognize are
</p>
<p>&amp; Point defects really can cause diffraction effects,
especially if they interact with one another.
</p>
<p>&amp; Diffuse scattering can still be interpreted by the
Ewald-sphere construction.

<p>If you are intrigued by this topic, you will find the
literature on discommensurate structures in intercalated
material a complementary challenge. A library/web
search on &lsquo;discommensurate&rsquo; and &lsquo;intercalated&rsquo; will
quickly net more recent papers.
</p>
<p>17.6 DIFFRACTION FROM DISLOCATIONS,
INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY
</p>
<p>In Chapter 25 we will discuss images of dislocations. A
dislocation is a line defect that is characterized by its line
direction and its Burgers vector. The crystal around the
defect is distorted or strained.
</p>
<p>For a single dislocation, this strain is not expected to
cause new spots in the DP, but we do expect diffuse
scattering since the dislocation is a line defect. If a region
from 0.2 to 1 nm around the core is greatly distorted
(we&rsquo;ll see the effect of this strain in Chapter 25), then the
diffuse scattering will extend from 1 nm�1 to perhaps
5 nm�1 from the reciprocal-lattice points, giving a dif-
fuse disk (the reciprocal shape of a long needle). Some
planes are essentially unaffected by the dislocations, so
we might expect the diffuse scattering to vary in magni-
tude for the different reciprocal-lattice points. (We&rsquo;ll
examine this g�b = 0 effect in Chapter 24.)
</p>
<p>With this simple discussion and without ever seeing
this diffuse scattering, we can draw an important con-
clusion: if we want to learn about the structure of a
dislocation core, we must include the diffuse scattering
in the image-formation process. We must include that
intensity in the objective aperture and the correspond-
ing image calculations.
</p>
<p>Because the distorted volume associated with a sin-
gle dislocation is so small, we do not expect to see this
intensity in the DP unless we have many dislocations in
an ordered array (just like the point defects in Section
17.5). We can demonstrate that this intensity is present
by diffracting from an ordered array of dislocations as
shown in Figure 17.12. The specimen used to form this
image was rather special. Dislocations are present in
region A, but not in region B. The array actually
forms a structured grain boundary in A, but a layer of
glass is present in B. The insets show the same part of the
SADPs from the two regions. In B, you can see three
spots. The top two are from one grain, the bottom one is
from the other grain. The reason for the pair is that s is

</p>
<p>strongly resembles a Fermi surface shown in (D).
</p>
<p>DIFFUSE SCATTERING
The diffuse intensity from a dislocation is not located
at the reciprocal-lattice point.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 17.12. Diffraction from an ordered array of dislocations. Dis-
</p>
<p>locations are present in region A, but not in region B. The insets show a
</p>
<p>small part of theDP from the two regions. The extra spots present in A are
</p>
<p>caused by the visible array of dislocations; these spots are a doublet
</p>
<p>because there is also a second, nearly orthogonal, set of dislocations
</p>
<p>present which acts as a separate grating. The other pair is due to the
</p>
<p>wedge shape and so is common to both DPs.
</p>
<p>278 .................................................................................................................................................... D I FFRACT ION FROM SMALL VOLUMES</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>large for that grain, but almost zero for the other. This is
an example of the application of Section 17.3.
</p>
<p>In A you see the same three spots (because the two
grains are still present) but now there are two extra
spots. The reason we see two extra spots is that we
have two arrays of dislocations. You are seeing the
scattering from the dislocations because they have
formed an array with long-range ordering, just like the
vacancies in V8C7 in Chapter 16.
</p>
<p>If you look at the DP when the array of dislocations
lies parallel to the beam, you may be able to see a set of
streaks as shown in Figure 17.13. The separation of the
streaks is the inverse of the actual separation of the
dislocations. You see streaks because you have relrods
in reciprocal space and we are cutting along these rods
with the Ewald sphere. The length of the relrods gives
you a measure of how far the strain field of the disloca-
tions extends out into the two grains. In other words, we
are seeing a thickness of the strain-field regions. The
object of this discussion is not to examine grain bound-
aries, but to show that the strain field from an array of
dislocations causes scattering in theDP and thus to infer
that one dislocation will also cause scattering, but it will
just be much more diffuse (and very weak).
</p>
<p>Before moving on, consider the diffraction spots in
Figure 17.12 again. Why are the pairs of dislocation
spots (arrowed) located where they are? Put another
way: which of the two spots in region B corresponds to
the N relrod and which corresponds to the M relrod?
(See Figure 17.5 for the definition of M and N.)
</p>
<p>We then ask a simple question: howmany objects are
required in order to produce a detectable effect in the
DP? The answer is two! This point is illustrated in
Figure 17.14, which shows a DP and an image of two
twin boundaries which are �15 nm apart. The spacing
of the new spots between the twin spots in the DP
(expanded in the inserts) is 0.067 nm�1, as expected.
Now, why can this occur? The analogy is the Young&rsquo;s
slits experiment in visible-light optics. The illustration
also reminds us of a special feature of the TEM, namely,
that even without a FEG, the electron beam is remark-
ably coherent.
</p>
<p>17.7 DIFFRACTION AND THE DISPERSION
SURFACE
</p>
<p>Several times in this chapter, we have said &lsquo;&lsquo;actually, we
will see two spots when s &frac14; 0,&rsquo;&rsquo; even though the relrod
model says that you will only see one. The origin of two
spots from a wedge specimen (there may be more for
more complicated defects) is due to the dynamical na-
ture of the scattering process. The theory has been
derived by Amelinckx and his co-workers in a series of
papers. Unfortunately, this group used a different nota-
tion, but they did summarize their results graphically.
We will also return to this topic when we discuss images in
Chapter 24. As an example, the relrod diagram given for
the stacking fault in Figure 17.5 should be drawn so
that the relrods are the asymptotic to two straight lines,
as shown in Figure 17.15. When the Ewald sphere cuts
these curves at s &frac14; 0, we see that there are two spots
which move apart as we increase s (either positive or, as
shown here, negative) until they are at the points
defined by the straight lines. So, will there not be a
vector that exactly corresponds to g? The answer, of
course, is yes, because of the adjacent perfect crystal so
we must have three spots, but these are very difficult to
see because smust be very close to zero. Without going
into any theory, we can guess the origin of these curves:
they look remarkably like the curves of the dispersion
</p>
<p>THE PERIODICITY RULE
If there is a structural periodicity in real space, then
there will be an array of points or relrods in reciprocal
space and an array of spots or streaks in the DP.

<p>surface which also had asymptotes (see Figure 15.3).
These curves are indeed directly related.
</p>
<p>When you increase s, you move out of the dynam-
ical regime and into the kinematical one, where the
simple relrod model applies (see Chapter 26). At
s&frac14; 0, the distance between the curves is inversely
proportional to xg, the extinction distance for reflec-
tion g.
</p>
<p>You can understand why this is so in the following
pictorial way. What you see in the image will be deter-
mined by the DP.What you see in the DP is determined
by which relrods, or surfaces, the Ewald sphere inter-
sects. All the information about extinction distances
and coupling of diffracted beams is fundamentally
contained in the dispersion surface (xg is just Dk
</p>
<p>�1 at
s&frac14; 0). Both the dispersion surface and the reciprocal-
lattice/Ewald-sphere models are just pictorial repre-
sentations of the same diffraction process. So, all the
information in the dispersion-surface model should
also be present in the reciprocal-lattice/Ewald-sphere
model.
</p>
<p>The relrods are the asymptotes to these two hyper-
bolas. Alternatively, we could say that the relrods and
the asymptotes are a result of the kinematical diffraction

<p>approximation. There is a one-to-one correlation
between what happens at the dispersion surface in the
vicinity of the BZB to what happens when the Ewald
sphere cuts the relrods in the vicinity of the reciprocal-
lattice point, G. Imagine rotating the dispersion-surface
diagram through 908. These ideas have been extensively
studied by van Landuyt, de Ridder, Gevers, Amelinckx
</p>
<p>et al., as summarized in the general references at the end
of this chapter. What Amelinckx&rsquo;s group has done is to
give us the rules on how to transfer this information
from the dispersion surface to the reciprocal lattice and
hence to theDP. In Section 24.9, we&rsquo;ll relate this concept
to images. If you thought dispersion surfaces were diffi-
cult, make s large and stick to relrods!
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have begun to examine the unique features of diffraction in the TEM.
These features arise because we are always diffracting from small volumes. The sizes of both
our specimen and the special features present in our specimen are always small, so that we
must take into account the shape effect. This is particularly important for nanoparticles and
nanograins&mdash;you must keep this in mind when imaging. Of course, the same considerations
will also apply to other forms of diffraction; it&rsquo;s just that only TEM can examine the
diffraction information from the vicinity of crystal defects. In other words, the shape effect
is not a limitation due to the fact that we are using high-energy electrons. By understanding
the concept of the shape effect you can actually learn more about defects in crystals;
conversely, you can make some major errors if you do not understand the shape effect.
Two points to remember are
</p>
<p>&amp; When a platelet is parallel to the beam its relrod is normal to the beam. If the specimen is
also thin, we can arrange that the Ewald sphere cuts along the length of the relrod. Now
you see a &lsquo;streak&rsquo; in the DP rather than a spot.
</p>
<p>&amp; Beam splitting at s&frac14; 0 and the dispersion surface both arise because of dynamical scattering.

<p>THE COMPANION TEXT
Although there is great interest in nanomaterials and XRD is often used to characterize them, diffraction
</p>
<p>from suchmaterials in the TEM is used much less because imaging is then almost routine. Hence there have
</p>
<p>not been recent advances in electron diffraction except as CBED, which is treated in the companion text.

</p>
<p>Obtaining and Indexing Parallel-Beam
Diffraction Patterns
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>The core strength of TEM is that you can obtain both aDP and an image from the same part
of your specimen (not to mention various spectra). To obtain the crystallographic data, a
method for interpreting and indexing the DP is essential and this aspect is the theme for the
next four chapters. We&rsquo;ll start in this chapter by considering classic selected-area diffraction
(SAD) patterns (SADPs) and how to index them, but also introduce other related, if less
widely used, parallel-beam diffraction methods.
</p>
<p>You can proceed to index your pattern in several ways, depending on howmuch informa-
tion you already know about your specimen. We will begin the chapter by considering the
experimental approachwith the aimof being able to identify shortcutswhenever possible. The
experienced microscopist will readily identify many patterns just by looking at them, but will
still need to index new patterns or to identify unfamiliar ones. The fastest and most efficient
experimental approach may take advantage of several concepts covered in the preceding two
chapters and the following three. Today, sophisticated computer software is available which
takes much of the tedium out of the indexing process.
</p>
<p>Most DPs in a TEM are single-crystal (spot) patterns because the area from which we can
routinely obtain SADPs (&lt; 1 mm) is smaller than typical grain sizes of most engineering
materials. However, with increased emphasis on nanocrystalline materials (grain size
&lt; 0.1 mm), it is more usual for the DPs to contain contributions from many crystals and
so ring/textured SADPs are increasingly common. (We&rsquo;ll cover convergent-beam (CBED) and
other forms of micro/nanodiffraction patterns, which can come from regions &lt; 10 nm, in
Chapters 20 and 21.) Using the DP, we can identify the crystal (which we often already know)
and its orientation (which we probably don&rsquo;t) with respect to both the beam and to any
adjacent crystals. The positions of the allowed hkl reflections are characteristic of the crystal
system. Indexing associates each spot or ring in theDPwith a plane (hkl), or set of planes {hkl},
in the crystal. From the indexing of the spots, you can deduce the orientation of the crystal in
terms of the zone axis [UVW] in which the indexed planes lie.
</p>
<p>If you want to know the orientation relationship between two crystals, you need to know
more than one [UVW] for each crystal and, as we&rsquo;ll show, it is the determination of
orientation relationships between different phases or differently oriented crystals that is
the most useful information to come out of DP indexing. Orientation determination in the
TEM is so important that we devote a complete chapter to the topic in the companion text.
Now, computer control of both DP formation and DP indexing is very much the norm, but
if you don&rsquo;t understand the principles, you shouldn&rsquo;t believe the computer output (GIGO).
So we deliberately confine our discussion of computer-assisted indexing to the end of this
chapter.
</p>
<p>BEAM DIRECTION
It is convention to define [UVW] as the beam direc-
tion. This direction is normal to the plane of the DP
and anti-parallel to the electron beam.

<p>18.1 CHOOSING YOUR TECHNIQUE
</p>
<p>The technique you choose to study your specimen will
depend on what you want to learn and what you can
learn. For example, if you want to learn about the crystal
structure of a particular region, diffraction is generally
the way to go although you may find moiré fringes
(Chapter 23) orHRTEM(Chapter 28)more appropriate.
Basically there are three diffraction approaches:
</p>
<p>&amp; You can spread the beam to give nearly parallel
illumination and then use an aperture to select an
area in the first image formed by the objective lens
(giving the SADPs of Chapters 9 and 11). We
emphasize SAD indexing in this chapter.
</p>
<p>&amp; SADPs often contain Kikuchi lines which give
more accurate orientation determination (see
Chapter 19).
</p>
<p>&amp; You can focus the beam on a small area of your
specimen to form a CBED pattern (we won&rsquo;t use
CBDP) (see Chapters 20 and 21).
</p>
<p>We can also summarize the possibilities as a function
of the grain size of the material. Let&rsquo;s consider this
particular specimen characteristic
</p>
<p>&amp; The grain size may be very small, &lt;&lt;10 nm, typical
of many nanocrystalline thin films. This is a problem
because it&rsquo;s rare that a single grain will extend
through the thickness of your specimen, in which
case you can&rsquo;t easily index an individual crystal pat-
tern. (This is the rhino problem (Figure 1.7) for
DPs!) However, in this case you probably won&rsquo;t
want to know the orientation of a particular grain
but will instead be interested in knowing the texture
of the material.
</p>
<p>&amp; The grain size is between 10 and�100nm.HereCBED
may be useful because it gives you a small probe.
However, much of the benefit of CBED comes from
having specimens which are &gt;100nm thick; the best
thickness depends on the structure factor (atomic num-
ber) of your specimen. If you&rsquo;re careful and are using a
recent-model TEM in which Cs and l are small, you
might be able to use SAD in this range of grain size, as
we saw in Table 11.1.
</p>
<p>&amp; The grain size is in the range 100nm to�2mm. In this
situation, SAD can be used quite routinely in a mod-
ern TEM. You must be aware of the limitations and
</p>
<p>be prepared to unravel a complex DP. Because of
errors due to Cs and Df, the problem will be distin-
guishing which spots arise from the area you selected
and which spots arise from neighboring areas.
</p>
<p>&amp; The specimen is uniformly thin with grain size
&gt; 2mm. This type of specimen is just a simpler ver-
sion of the last case. You should have no problem in
applying SAD techniques even at lower voltages and
in older microscopes. Now CBEDwill be very useful
in examining local changes within a grain.
</p>
<p>&amp; The grains of interest are large (&gt; 2 mm, even better if
they are&gt; 5 mm) with both thin areas (&lt; 100&ndash;300 nm
thick, depending on the material) and areas which
are sufficiently thick for Kikuchi lines to be visible
(see next chapter). Now you can use any of these
techniques, except texture analysis, which becomes
more difficult! For the latter, you should now con-
sider the electron-backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
technique using a bulk specimen in an SEM to give
better statistics (Schwartz et al.).
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll concentrate on the hands-on
approach to SAD analysis and leave CBED to Chapters
20 and 21. We&rsquo;ll also introduce hollow-cone and preces-
sion diffraction which make your SADPsmore useful at
times. We can&rsquo;t give you a foolproof guide since the best
technique(s) will depend on your specimen.
</p>
<p>18.2 EXPERIMENTAL SAD TECHNIQUES
</p>
<p>By now you should know how the experimental camera
length (L) compares to the value you read from the
microscope. You also know how the SADP is rotated
with respect to the image as the magnification changes
(unless your particular TEM automatically compen-
sates for this rotation). You&rsquo;ve checked that you haven&rsquo;t
missed a 1808 inversion; leading researchers have missed
this in the past. Go back to Sections 9.3&ndash;9.6 and 11.9 if
you need to refresh the details of the practical steps
involved in obtaining SADPs.
</p>
<p>You can vary L but your pattern may rotate as you
do so. We generally use a value of �500mm for SAD,
but that will depend on your TEM, whether you want
to see detail in the HOLZ and on the interplanar
spacings in your specimen. It&rsquo;s good practice to choose
a particular value of L and always use that value for
your SADPs with a particular instrument/specimen
combination. You may want to increase L for special
high-resolution diffraction, but you&rsquo;ll give up a large
number of other reflections and enlarging the photo-
graphic film will almost always provide the magnifica-
tion you need. This is where a wide-angle CCD camera
(Chapter 7) that captures a much larger area of recip-
rocal space than standard TEM film can be really
useful.
</p>
<p>SAD ACRONYMS
SADP versus SAD pattern, SAED versus SAD and
CBEDP versus CBDP versus CBED pattern. We try
to useDP throughout the book but some conventions
are very well established!

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Tilting and rotating your specimen. One of the biggest
assets of the TEM is that you canmonitor the DP as you
tilt or rotate your specimen. Rotating the pattern
requires a rotation holder (Chapter 8), which is ideal
if you want to align a particular reflection parallel to
the tilt axis, especially for a side-entry holder. This
alignment is particularly helpful in stereomicroscopy
(see Chapter 29). Tilting the specimen is far more com-
mon than rotating, since all side-entry holders auto-
matically have one tilt axis parallel to the specimen
rod. We discussed the importance of eucentricity in
Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>It is good practice to note the tilt settings whenever
you are recording images. If you want to use these
settings to give a rough estimate of how far you&rsquo;re tilting
the specimen, you should remember that there may be
some backlash due to mechanical hysteresis. So you will
always need to approach a particular setting from the
same tilt direction if you need to be exact. In the next
chapter, we&rsquo;ll describe how we use Kikuchi maps to
guide us as we tilt the specimen. If you don&rsquo;t have
Kikuchi lines because your specimen is too thin, or too
bent, you can still use the idea. Select a particular
strongly diffracted beam and then tilt the specimen so
that that particular beam remains excited.What you are
doing is tilting the specimen so that the same plane
remains nearly parallel to the electron beam (think
about what this means and the crystallographic infor-
mation that it can give you).
</p>
<p>Tilting the beam. If you are really interested in exam-
ining the detail present in the DP and the image is less
important, you can change the diffraction conditions in a
very controlled and reversible way by tilting the beam
using the DF deflection coils. You can be much more
precise than mechanical tilting with the goniometer since
there is no problem with backlash. To increase your
accuracy, you may want to increase L. This technique is
particularly helpful when you want to examine the effect
of small changes in s on the appearance of diffraction
spots.
</p>
<p>For example, if you want to excite the third-order
reflection 3g in BF, you could use the approach shown
in Figure 18.1. (You wouldn&rsquo;t, but this exercise is
useful!)
</p>
<p>&amp; Use the beam tilt (dark-field deflection coils) to put �g
on the optic axis (where 0 was) (Figure 18.1A). Now
tilt the sample so that g is excited. Then tilt the beam
to put 0 back on the optic axis. 3g is now excited.
</p>
<p>Next, repeat the exercise but with the aim of exciting 5g.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use the beam tilt (dark-field deflection coils) to put
2�g on the optic axis (where 0 was) (Figure 18.1B).
Now tilt the sample so that g is excited (as before).
Then tilt the beam to put 0 back on the optic axis. 5g
is now excited.
</p>
<p>Repeat the exercise againbutwith theaimof exciting7g.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use the beam tilt (dark-field deflection coils) to put
3�g on the optic axis (where 0 was) (Figure 18.1C).
Now tilt the sample so that g is excited (as before).
Then tilt the beam to put 0 back on the optic axis. 7g
is now excited.
</p>
<p>Now you can see that if you want to excite 11g, but
you won&rsquo;t be able to see 11g on the DP, start by moving
5�g to the optic axis. You should now appreciate the
possibilities.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll develop other variations of this technique in
Chapter 19, and we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 27 that the situation
in Figure 18.1 does arise in weak-beam microscopy at
higher voltages. Computerized control of the beam tilt is
essential to hollow-cone and precession diffraction meth-
ods which we&rsquo;ll discuss toward the end of the chapter.

<p>18.3 THE STEREOGRAPHIC PROJECTION
</p>
<p>DPs not only tell us the direction of the electron beam
but also the complete orientation of that region of the
specimen illuminated by the beam. If we have a grain
boundary or interphase interface (or indeed any planar
defect) present in the specimen, we can determine the
orientation of both grains and the plane of the interface.
As we show in great detail in the companion text, what
we often want to know is how the two crystals are
related to one another. But first, we need a method for
visualizing this relationship; this is where the stereo-
graphic projection or stereogram is an invaluable aid.
Unfortunately the classic materials texts by Johari and
Thomas and by Smaill are out of print, so to get an in-
depth appreciation of this technique, you&rsquo;ll have to
resort to crystallography texts, such as those listed in
the general reference section or a dedicated stereo-
graphic-projection text in another field (e.g., Lisle and
Leyshon). Like other tools, you&rsquo;ll have to understand it
and use it before you fully appreciate its value. We
strongly recommend that you take time out to do this
if you&rsquo;re not already familiar with the construction. Any
introductory crystallography text is a good place to start
and several are listed in the references.
</p>
<p>The construction. Imagine a crystal located inside a
sphere as shown in Figure 18.2. Draw a line normal to
each crystal plane from the center of the sphere (the
</p>
<p>sphere of projection) to intersect the sphere at point P
in the northern hemisphere; the cross section view may
be easier to visualize. Now draw a second line from the
south pole to point P.
</p>
<p>This second line cuts the equatorial plane at the
point P 0. The disk of the equatorial plane is the stereo-
graphic projection and the point P 0 uniquely represents
the plane whose radial normal cuts through P. If P is in
the southern hemisphere, we draw the line from the
north pole instead and identify this P 0 on the projection
with a circle instead of a dot.
</p>
<p>Look again at the crystal; it&rsquo;s cubic to keep it simple
but the construction is completely general. The normals
to the planes (100), (111), (011) and &eth;�111&THORN; all lie on the
circumference of a circle around the sphere of projec-
tion. In this special case, all of the points on this cir-
cumference project onto the same great circle on
the stereographic projection whose circumference
we call the &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; great circle. The Wulff net in
Figure 18.3 shows 90 such great circles all passing
from the north pole to the south pole and another
around the equator: a great circle always passes through
opposite ends of a diameter in the projection. These are
the familiar lines of longitude on the globe. Circles on
the sphere which do not contain the center of the sphere
are smaller; they also project as circles called the small
</p>
<p>FIGURE 18.2. The stereographic projection. The crystal is at the center
</p>
<p>of the sphere. Normals to the crystal planes are projected until they
</p>
<p>intercept the sphere at P, then projected back to the south pole &eth;00�1&THORN; of
the sphere. Where this projected line crosses the equatorial plane at P&rsquo; is
</p>
<p>the point that uniquely represents the original plane in the crystal. Note
</p>
<p>that planes in the same zone on the crystal project as a great circle in the
</p>
<p>stereographic projection. An example of such a great circle is its diameter
</p>
<p>(or line of longitude); another is the circumference in the equatorial plane.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 18.3. AWulff net which contains 90 great circles like the one in
</p>
<p>Figure 18.2; each great circle is 28 apart so the net covers 1808. The only
</p>
<p>great circle that actually appears as a circle in the net is the circumference
</p>
<p>of the projection, called the primitive great circle. Points on the primitive
</p>
<p>represent planes whose normals are 908 from the north pole (which
</p>
<p>projects in the center of the Wulff net). Thus all distances on the net are
</p>
<p>proportional to angles in real space but only correspond exactly to angles
</p>
<p>around the primitive.
</p>
<p>286 ....................................................................................... OBTA IN ING AND INDEX ING PARALLEL -BEAM D I FFRACT ION PATTERNS</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>circles which, if concentric with the primitive, are famil-
iar as lines of latitude. (Note, however, that most small
circles are not concentric with the primitive.) We can
then rotate the Wulff net, as we wish, to realign our
great circles.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can represent plane normals (also called poles)
and directions on the same projection even if they are
not parallel to one another. Better still, we can read
off the angles between them. Remember that, in
general, the normal to the plane (hkl) is parallel to
the direction [hkl] only for cubic materials.
</p>
<p>&amp; The zone axis is always 908 away from any plane
normal that is in its zone. All the plane normals in a
particular zone, [UVW], will lie on a single great
circle.
</p>
<p>&amp; The angle between any two planes is the angle
between their plane normals, measured along a
great circle using the Wulff net.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can use the same construction to summarize all the
symmetry elements of any particular crystal system.
</p>
<p>These poles at the UVW zone axis represent the
possible diffracting planes for that zone; [UVW] is the
beam direction. So if [UVW] is in the center of the projec-
tion, the hkl reflections will be around the circumference
of the projection (the primitive great circle). Now you
should appreciate why stereograms can be so useful in
interpreting DPs.
</p>
<p>Several examples of stereographic projections are
shown in Figure 18.4. Look at the Wulff net and check
some simple facts. For example, for the cubic system,
check which poles are 908 away from the [001] direction.
How large is the angle between &eth;0�11&THORN; and (011)? How
would this angle change if the material were forced to be
tetragonal with c/a&gt; 1?What happens in this case to the
&eth;1�11&THORN; pole or the &eth;1�10&THORN; pole? Now consider the more
extensive plot shown in Figure 18.5. If the specimen is
cubic with the [001] foil normal, what pole would you tilt
</p>
<p>to if you wanted to form an image with the 0�22 reflec-
tion? (One answer is the [011] zone axis, but why?). For
the same specimen, if you want to excite the �111 reflec-
tion, you could tilt toward the &frac12;0�11� zone axis keeping
the 200 reflection excited, not toward the [011] zone axis.
</p>
<p>&amp; You could work this out using equations, but the
stereographic projection tells you what to do while
you are sitting at the microscope.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you are working with a non-cubic material, buy a
large Wulff net and construct your own stereo-
graphic projection; you can buy standard projec-
tions for cubic materials so, as usual, it&rsquo;s easier to be
a metallurgist than a ceramist or mineralogist.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use a program like EMS to help you plot the points,
or download appropriate software from the Web
(e.g., URL #1).
</p>
<p>&amp; Wulff nets and plotting software are also available
on-line (e.g., URL #2).
</p>
<p>18.4 INDEXING SINGLE-CRYSTAL DPs
</p>
<p>Remember the fundamental relationship in a DP
(Section 9.6.B).
</p>
<p>Rd &frac14; lL (18:1)
</p>
<p>Any distance between the direct beam and a specific dif-
fraction spot or the radius of a diffraction ring, R, which
we measure on the DP, is related to a specific spacing
between planes in the crystal, d. Since lL is a constant,
we can measure several values of R and know that
</p>
<p>R1d1 &frac14; R2d2 &frac14; R3d3 &frac14; R4d4 &frac14; . . . (18:2)
</p>
<p>If you know the lattice parameter of your crystal,
then you know the allowed reflections and only certain
d-spacings will be associated with diffraction spots.

some cubic systems. Rules for more crystal systems are
given in Table 16.2.

<p>Once you have tentatively identified possible values
for g1 and g2, you need to cross-check your answers
using the angles between the g vectors (i.e., the angles
between the plane normals). The fully indexed patterns
at the end of this chapter (Figures 18.19&ndash;18.21) show the
principal interplanar angles and the principal ratios of
g1/g2. Hence, in practice, youwill rarely have tomeasure
more than two or three spacings in order to index a

</p>
<p>to tilt about a pole that is 908 from the 0�22 reflection, such as the [100], [111] or [311] zone axes.

<p>particular zone-axis DP. However, if your specimen is
not oriented close to a zone axis, you&rsquo;ll need to look
ahead to Section 18.10.
</p>
<p>TheWeiss zone law only holds for diffraction into the
zeroth layer of the reciprocal lattice and the diffraction
spots that we see here are called the zero-order Laue zone
(ZOLZ). There are circumstanceswhenwe can see diffrac-
tion from higher-order Laue zones (HOLZ) and we&rsquo;ll talk
a lot more about this phenomenon in Chapters 20 and 21.
All SADPs, particularly those that we talk about and
index in this and the next chapter, are ZOLZ patterns.
</p>
<p>The angle between normals to the planes (h1k1l1) and
(h2k2l2) is f; the angle between directions [U1V1W1] and
[U2V2W2] is r. You can work these out and cross-check
them with your DPs. These are standard equations in
many texts (e.g., those by Edington and Andrews et al.).
You&rsquo;ll probably find that the equations for the cubic
system are the most useful.

<p>Remember that you can always work out these expres-
sions for any crystal system using the equation for the
dot product of the two appropriate vectors.
</p>
<p>In principle, if we don&rsquo;t know the crystal structure,
we can still work out the d-spacings of the diffracting
planes using equation 18.1. However, you should
remember that SAD is not the most accurate method
fordetermining the spacingof latticeplanes,dhkl, or theangles
between them, f. SAD is generally very good at distinguish-
ing patterns, but it completely fails when the difference
between the two patterns is a 1808 rotation, as occurs in
some patterns of polar material, like GaAs or GaN.
</p>
<p>To summarize
</p>
<p>&amp; Tilt your specimen to a low-index pole.
&amp; Set s=0 for the innermost reflections.
&amp; Record the SADP.
&amp; Repeat the exercise using higher-order reflections
after tilting the specimen to set s&frac14; 0. These measure-
ments will be more accurate, but only if you make
sure that s&frac14; 0.
</p>
<p>The discussion on relrods in Chapter 16 told you
that both d and f could be seriously in error if reflec-
tions are not set to have s&frac14; 0, especially since you&rsquo;ve
probably tilted the specimen.
</p>
<p>So far, you have only indexed one DP. You&rsquo;ll prob-
ably need more than one to determine orientation rela-
tionships. While you&rsquo;re at the microscope, tilt to pole #2
keeping g1 (see Figure 18.6) strongly excited. Repeat the

<p>indexing procedure. Go back to pole #1 and tilt to pole
#3 keeping g2 strongly excited. You can repeat this
indexing as many times as you wish. The important
idea is that you now have angular measurements allow-
ing you to cross-check your determination of both g1
and g2 and the zone axes. Of course the task is simple for
an fcc crystal, as you can see in Figure 18.7, which is an
experimental illustration of this procedure. The chal-
lenge comes when the crystal has less symmetry. If you
already know the crystal structure, then you should plot
out the most important poles, relating their orientations
to one another (more on this in Section 18.11 and
Chapter 19) and pay particular attention to the infor-
mation from systematic absences which occur when the
structure factor is zero (go back and check Section 3.9
and Chapter 13).
</p>
<p>18.5 RING PATTERNS FROM
POLYCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS
</p>
<p>Diffraction from polycrystalline specimens (especially
when the grain sizes are at the nanoscale) can be viewed
in much the same way as X-ray diffraction from pow-
ders. For a completely random polycrystal, we rotate
the reciprocal lattice about all axes and produce a set of
</p>
<p>nested spheres. When we intersect these spheres with the
Ewald sphere (which, in the TEM, approximates to a
plane) we will see the rings which are recorded in powder
patterns.
</p>
<p>If a polycrystal is textured, then there is usually one
special plane which is common to nearly all the grains.
Since the grains are small, all the reciprocal-lattice
points will be broadened by the shape effect; so will
the sphere or circles for the polycrystals. This situation
will be exacerbated for nanocrystals.
</p>
<p>If we then rotate the reciprocal lattice about the
lattice vector normal to the texture plane, we pro-
duce a set of circles in reciprocal space, as shown in
Figure 18.8. If we are examining cubic materials, the
reciprocal-lattice vector ghkl will be parallel to the direc-
tion [hkl] in real space. Otherwise this will not generally
be the case.
</p>
<p>The DP in either of these examples appears as shown
in Figure 18.9A and B which differs because the grain

</p>
<p>Laue zone (N &frac14; 1, 2, etc.) produces a set of concentric circles for each
allowed reflection in each zone.
</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN RULE
Make the task as easy as possible. Record ALL the
DPs you might need and how they relate to one
another (draw road maps) while you&rsquo;re at the
microscope.
</p>
<p>NANO AND DPs
Smaller grains give broader spots in the DP. Nano-
crystals should give the largest spots, or. . .

<p>290 ....................................................................................... OBTA IN ING AND INDEX ING PARALLEL -BEAM D I FFRACT ION PATTERNS</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>size is different. A larger grain size gives a more speckled
pattern.
</p>
<p>You candistinguish the pattern producedby a textured
specimen from one produced by a random polycrystal by
tilting. If your specimen is textured, the rings become arcs
as shown in the pattern in Figure 18.10A together with the
Ewald-sphere construction in Figure 18.10B. You can
locate the grains which give rise to the arcs by forming a
</p>
<p>CDF image with the arc of diffracted intensity. In Figure
18.10C, these oriented grains are uniformly distributed,
but you might encounter a situation where this is not the
case. Think how the pattern might differ in this case.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.10D and E emphasizes that these ring
patterns can be quite varied. In this case the specimen
is a-Ag2Se, which is textured about an axis inclined to
the beam.When the Ewald sphere cuts the circles now, it
produces elongated spots which lie on an ellipse.
Vainshtein et al. point out that all the &lsquo;spots&rsquo; on one
ellipse can be indexed with the same hk indices but a
different l, and call such a pattern an oblique-textured
electron DP. You should also be careful in indexing
these textured patterns since not all possible dhkl values
need be present, depending on the texture plane.
</p>
<p>There is more information in ring patterns than spot
patterns. Like a powder pattern, you could estimate the
grain size from thewidth of the rings, but it&rsquo;s more direct
(and more reliable) to just look at the DF image. You
can see kinematically forbidden rings because you don&rsquo;t
necessarily have single scattering from each grain but
there are ways around this problem.
</p>
<p>Nanocrystalline materials, which fall into our small-
est range of �10-nm grain size, are very challenging
because there&rsquo;s probably always more than one grain
through the foil thickness. Careful DF imaging com-
bined withHRTEMorCBEDwith the smallest possible
probe (often called nanodiffraction, see Section 21.8.B),
is probably optimal, but you need to look for clustering
of similarly oriented grains.
</p>
<p>18.6 RING PATTERNS FROM
HOLLOW-CONE DIFFRACTION
</p>
<p>We can combine the advantages of ring patterns from
small-grained materials with individual spot patterns
from larger-grained materials, As we noted back in
Section 9.3.D, if you have a nano/microcrystalline speci-
men, it is rather inefficient to get a DP from one grain at
a time by carefully tilting your specimen and then get-
ting individual DF images of single areas, or of phases
within a single grain, by carefully tilting the incident
beam. So we can use a computer to continuously change
the beam orientation so it samples many angles of inci-
dence and gather DPs from all the crystals superim-
posed on one another (i.e., get a ring pattern, even
from a relatively large-grain material). This is the prin-
ciple behind hollow-cone (sometimes called &lsquo;conical&rsquo;)
diffraction (go back and look at Figure 9.15). In the
same section we also introduced the idea of hollow-
cone DF imaging. In earlier TEMs, before computer
control of the beam, hollow-cone illumination was
achieved by using an annular C2 aperture rather than
a circular hole. Thus the beam that came through the
annulus irradiated the specimen from a fixed angle

</p>
<p>finer grain size, as in (B) produces a more continuous ring pattern, but the
</p>
<p>width of the rings of diffracted intensity in fact becomes broader and can
</p>
<p>be used as an inverse measure of the grain size.

<p>around the optic axis, as shown schematically back in
Figure 9.15A. It&rsquo;s much easier and more flexible to use
the computer to control the pre-specimen scan coils
and bring the beam onto the specimen at a fixed (or a
range of) conical scan angle and a typical conical-scan
DP is shown in Figure 9.15B. (If you look ahead, you
can see another example of a hollow-cone DF image
from an amorphous DP in Figure 18.14C.) Of course,
we index the rings in exactly the same way as we
described in Section 18.5 for ring patterns obtained
from a polycrystalline specimen where the grain size
is much smaller than the beam size.
</p>
<p>With hollow-cone illumination, we can create a DF
image of all the crystals in a film that are diffracting
from their {hkl} planes, rather than imaging only that
small fraction diffracting into the part of the diffraction
ring that happens to be selected by the aperture. The
difference in information content between these two
approaches is shown back in Figure 9.15B and C. The
hollow-cone technique is widely used in CBED (see
Chapter 21) and has more recently been used as the
basis for precession diffraction (see Section 18.8.)
</p>
<p>18.7 RING PATTERNS FROM
AMORPHOUS MATERIALS
</p>
<p>Amorphous materials used to represent somewhat of a
fringe field in materials science but the rapid growth in
glass technology over the last decade, fueled by the
optical-communications bubble, the development of
bulk metallic glasses and the increased awareness of
the role of glassy films at interfaces (particularly the
gate oxide in semiconductors) have all conspired to
crystallize the following question: is the material really
amorphous or is it (sub) nanocrystalline? Actually this
question is still debated when discussing both amor-
phous materials and, more intensely, oxide and metallic
glasses because there&rsquo;s still no broadly accepted defini-
tion of when grains become small enough that a deter-
minable crystal structure no longer exists. At best we
should think of a continuum of states from nanocrystal-
line to amorphous.
</p>
<p>Rudee and Howie showed that electron scattering
from regions of �1.5 nm diameter could be coherent.
Graczyk and Chaudhari proposed modeling these
materials as random networks. If we are careful, we
can learn quite a lot about the structure of amorphous
</p>
<p>materials, but we should first say what we mean by
&lsquo;amorphous.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>An amorphous material is one where the locations
of the neighboring atoms are defined by a prob-
ability function such that the probabilities are
never unity.
</p>
<p>This idea is best illustrated by a plot of the probability
which we call the radial distribution function (RDF). The
RDF, r(r), is the probability, per unit element of volume,
that an atom will be found at a distance r from another
atom. The first example in Figure 18.11A compares the
curves for liquid sodium and crystalline sodium; the
numbers on the crystalline curve remind us that in the
crystal each sodium has eight nearest neighbors, etc. The
second plot, Figure 18.11B, shows the RDF for vitreous
silica. This time the peaks are associated with distances

<p>DPs AND AMORPHOUS MATERIALS
The DP from an amorphous material looks similar to
that from polycrystalline material but the rings are
broader and there is no speckle.

<p>&amp; The two curves both show definite peaks.
&amp; The two curves are different.
</p>
<p>Some diffraction theory. Since these materials are so
different, we&rsquo;ll give a brief introduction to the theory of
scattering from amorphous materials. We make the
assumption that the electron beam is only scattered
once; this is kinematical, but it&rsquo;s more realistic than for
crystals at the Bragg condition. Following Howie, we
express the kinematical intensity, I(k), by the expression
</p>
<p>I&eth;k&THORN; &frac14; f&eth;k&THORN;j j2
X
</p>
<p>i;j
</p>
<p>ei2pk� ri�rj&eth; &THORN; (18:5)
</p>
<p>Here we assume that there are N identical atoms con-
tributing to the scattered intensity and they are located
at the different positions (ri or rj).
</p>
<p>The f(k) terms are the atomic scattering amplitudes,
with k reminding us that there is an angular dependence
to f. If the material is isotropic, we can simplify equation
18.5 as follows

<p>I&eth;k&THORN; &frac14; N f&eth;k&THORN;j j2 1&thorn;

<p>This equation means that, in principle, the RDF can be
obtained directly from DPs. This process is enhanced if
the patterns are energy-filtered to remove inelastic con-
tributions (see Chapter 37 and the work of Cockayne
et al.) as shown graphically in Figures 18.12 and 18.13.
Compare these figures with Figure 2.13A. Other ways to
determine the RDF include extended X-ray absorption
fine structure (EXAFS) studies in a synchrotron X-ray
and, less expensively but more noisily, via EXELFS (see
Chapter 40). Alternatively, we can rearrange equation
18.6 again to give a &lsquo;reduced-intensity function&rsquo; as illu-
strated by the work of Graczyk and Chaudhari who
</p>
<p>showed clearly that the structure correlation can extend
to 1.5nm or more. Life gets more interesting as we
explore the structure out beyond the nanometer
level and Treacy et al. review a new imaging technique
called fluctuation microscopy which is a hybrid imaging/
diffraction technique sensitive to the presence of me-
dium-range order in amorphous materials. We&rsquo;ll discuss
this techniquemore inChapter 29. If you get the idea that

<p>the study of amorphous materials is at the frontiers of
TEM materials-structure determination, you are right!
</p>
<p>To summarize this discussion, the scattering theory
is well known but the capability for routinely removing
the inelastic contribution is only now becoming avail-
able and is still not commonplace. Probably the best
way to answer whether a material is nanocrystalline or
amorphous will come from a combination of SAD and
EELS. A BF image of amorphous material is generally
uninformative (Figure 18.14A), but if you try to form a
DF image you will see a speckle of white spots against a
dark background, as shown in Figure 18.14B. The size
of the speckle increases as the defocus increases, so be
wary of interpreting the image in terms of the size of
regions in the amorphous structure. Hollow-cone DF
imaging, as shown in Figure 18.14C, gives even more
and finer &lsquo;structure&rsquo; in the image. The fact that you can
produce this type of speckled contrast is important
because you may well want to study small particles
(e.g., catalysts) supported by an amorphous film. In
such a case, you need to know what the image of the
support film looks like before you add a new
component.
</p>
<p>Glass at interfaces and grain boundaries. Another
area where it is important to know whether or not an
amorphous material is present, occurs in the analysis of
grain boundaries in ceramic materials or gate oxides in
semiconductor devices. Answering this problem
severely taxes the limits of HRTEM when the film
thicknesses are &lt; 1 nm, which is the case for the gate
oxide in the latest semiconductor devices. For somewhat
thicker films we can use conventional HRTEM and
another technique, known as diffuse-dark-field (DDF)
imaging, which essentially forms an image from the
region in the SADP where the amorphous ring would
be, if glass were present.We&rsquo;ll return toDDF imaging in
Chapter 29.
</p>
<p>18.8 PRECESSION DIFFRACTION
</p>
<p>Precession is a relatively new approach to performing
electron diffraction; it is similar to the X-ray method
which goes by the same &lsquo;name&rsquo; (although in XRD the
crystal, rather than the beam, is precessed) and it is
closely related to hollow-cone diffraction that we just
talked about. The main advantage that precession brings
is to remove strong dynamical effects from the patterns
leaving high-quality kinematical data, eliminating, e.g.,
extra spots due to dynamical effects. Precession diffrac-
tion can also be used for crystal structure and full sym-
metry determination. While the method was first tried in
a TEM by Vincent andMidgley, recent advances in both
CCD cameras and (you&rsquo;ve guessed it) aberration correc-
tion make both the operational aspects and the interpre-
tation of precession DPs much easier.
</p>
<p>In precession diffraction we double-deflect the inci-
dent beam (either parallel or convergent) using the usual
DF scan coils in a circular hollow cone (radius G and
angle C) about a centered zone-axis direction (Figure
18.15) and de-scan the beam onto the plane of the DP.
So it is really a double conical beam-rocking system.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Unlike standard TEM hollow-cone where we are seek-
ing to get multiple (i.e., ring) patterns sampling many
grains, in precession mode we are usually trying to
average out the diffraction conditions within a single
grain and obtain a single-crystal pattern inwhich dynam-
ical effects are reduced. If the hollow-cone angle is
large enough, all the diffraction data correspond to a
two-beam condition and show reduced dynamical dif-
fraction because not many reflections are simulta-
neously excited off the zone-axis condition. When we
precess the beam, we integrate the diffracted intensities
through the Bragg condition, so small specimen-tilt
changes are averaged out and we can more reliably
interpret crystal-symmetry information in the DP. Con-
tinuous changing of the precession angle over several
degrees can help with point and space-group determina-
tion (see Chapter 21, the companion text and Morniroli
et al.&rsquo;s paper). Figure 18.16A and B shows, respectively,
the differences between small and large precession-angle
DPs from a Si single crystal. The larger angle removes
the kinematically forbidden reflections that are present
in the smaller-angle DP because the multiple-diffraction
paths to them are unlikely to occur during the preces-
sion movement. Most of the time, only the direct beam
and one diffracted beam are strongly excited as the
beam precesses. This does not mean that the dynamical
interactions disappear, they just occur between the
direct beam and one diffracted beam (as in the two-
beam case).
</p>
<p>Precession is an area of electron diffraction that is
seeing a rapid growth in applications across many fields.
Commercial retrofits are available for any TEM (e.g.,
URL #3) but, if you want to do it on your own, then
Own et al. give good detailed instructions.
</p>
<p>18.9 DOUBLE DIFFRACTION
</p>
<p>Double diffraction occurs when a diffracted beam trav-
eling through a crystal is rediffracted either within the
same crystal or when it passes into a second crystal. If
the initial diffraction vector of the beam is g1 and it is
rediffracted by reflection �g2 , then the resultant diffrac-
tion vector of the double-diffracted beam is (g1&ndash;g2). If g2
is not an allowed reflection in the first crystal, the dou-
ble-diffracted beam is characteristic of neither the first
nor the second crystal.
</p>
<p>Reflections attributable to double diffraction are a
common feature of DPs recorded from two-phase mate-
rials exhibiting epitaxy or topotaxy including, e.g., oxi-
dized metallic specimens. Quite complicated patterns
may be formed, requiring careful analysis to distinguish
the &lsquo;real&rsquo; reflections from the double-diffraction reflec-
tions. Double diffraction is directly responsible for the
moiré effect in the electron images that we will discuss in
Chapter 23. As an example of this effect, we&rsquo;ll consider
small a-Fe2O3 (hematite) islands grown on a single-
crystal a-Al2O3 (alumina or sapphire) substrate as

<p>shown in Figure 18.17A. The position of the double-
diffraction spots relative to the hematite and alumina
reflections actually changes depending on whether the
islands were on the top or bottom surface of the speci-
men. This particular top&ndash;bottom effect can be derived
from simple geometry; however, dynamical diffraction
effects must also be considered when the materials are
thicker.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.17B shows the [0001] SADP recorded
from one of these a-Fe2O3 particles. The closest reflec-
tions to the direct beam are the six f11�20g reflections.
The next closest reflections are the six f3�300g reflec-
tions, only four of which are visible in the figure.
Double-diffraction spots are visible around each of
these primary reflections. They also surround the direct
beam, although they are hidden by the flare from that
beam in Figure 18.17B.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.17C and D shows enlargements of regions
near the f11�20g reflections in the [0001] SADPs
recorded when the hematite island was on the top sur-
face in (C) and on the bottom surface of the sapphire in
(D). Both g and �g reflections are shown for the two
cases. In (C) the ring of six double-diffraction spots
surrounds the Al2O3 reflection while in (D) the double-
diffraction spots surround the Fe2O3 reflection.
</p>
<p>The same observation can be made for the {�3300}
regions of theSADPsas shown inFigure 18.17EandF. In
this case, an inner ring of double-diffraction spots (small
filled circles) with the same spacing and orientation as the
double-diffraction reflections in Figure 18.17C andD are
still visible, as are the outer rings of spots (large filled
circles). In general, the outer ring of double-diffraction
spots is more intense than the inner ring.
</p>
<p>This top-bottom effect in particular, and double
diffraction in general, can be explained by the simple
geometric analysis we show in Figure 18.18; the bottom
crystal is Al2O3, which has the smaller lattice param-
eter and therefore has the larger reciprocal-lattice vec-
tors. Double-diffraction spots can be formed around
the primary hematite reflection, gH, by two different
routes
</p>
<p>&amp; 2gH &thorn; �gA (A: alumina, H: hematite) giving the
double-diffraction spot just inside gH.
</p>
<p>&amp; �gH &thorn; 2gA gives a double-diffraction spot just outside
gH.
</p>
<p>These two routes at first appear to be equivalent.
However, if we take into account the curvature of the
Ewald sphere, then the deviation parameters of the two
routes are very different. In the case of diffraction through
the upper crystal, the deviation parameter of the 2g beam
is slightly more than twice that of the �g beam. This differ-
ence will not significantly affect the intensities from a very

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>thin epilayer due to streaking of the reciprocal-lattice spots
parallel to the beam direction (the shape-factor effect).
</p>
<p>Now we can analyze the effects of diffraction
through the lower crystal
</p>
<p>&amp; Draw the reciprocal lattice with the origin of the
Ewald sphere at 2gH for the first case and on �gH in
the second.
</p>
<p>&amp; Keep the radius of the Ewald sphere unchanged
since only elastic interactions are considered.
</p>
<p>&amp; The incident beam for the lower crystal is in the 2g or
�g directions for the two cases.
</p>
<p>&amp; The height of the ZOLZ is slightly different in the
two cases since the deviation parameter at the origin
must be zero.
</p>
<p>You can see from Figure 18.18A that the deviation
parameter for 2gA is approximately zero, whereas for �gA
it is of the same order as gH. The total deviation param-
eter is thus much smaller for the second route than the
first. A similar analysis for the inverted structure is shown
in Figure 18.18B. In both cases, the deviation parameter
for the route �g (upper) plus 2g (lower) produces a much
smaller deviation parameter than the route 2g (upper)
</p>
<p>plus �g (lower). So the double-diffraction spot, which
occurs on the same side of the diffraction spot from the
upper crystal as the diffraction spot from the lower crys-
tal, will bemore intensely excited than the double-diffrac-
tion spot which occurs on the opposite side. In two
dimensions, for thin films, the strongest double-diffrac-
tion spots will always be those arranged symmetrically
around the diffraction spot from the lower crystal.
</p>
<p>For thicker layers, the relative intensity of the �g and
2g beams will vary as dynamical diffraction effects
occur. We can simulate the DPs from these structures
using the MacTempas program (see Chapter 30 and
Section 1.6.B) The top-bottom effect is evident in the
case of 2.7 nm of hematite on 13 nm of alumina, but only
just discernible for the case of 2.6 nm of alumina on
13.5 nm of hematite. In the latter case, the dynamical
diffraction effects are stronger.
</p>
<p>We will meet this topic in Chapter 23 when we dis-
cuss moiré fringes. We have made this analysis a little
more complicated than usual since we have considered
the details of where the spots will actually be found. You
can make this process simpler
</p>
<p>&amp; Trace the patterns from each crystal (if you know
what tracing paper is).
</p>
<p>&amp; Then construct a new pattern using each diffracted
beam from the upper crystal as an incident beam for
the lower crystal.
</p>
<p>The extent of the moiré pattern gives you an idea of
just how strong dynamical scattering is, even for thin films!
</p>
<p>18.10 ORIENTATION OF THE SPECIMEN
</p>
<p>Once you have identified three g vectors g1, g2 and g3 in
a single-crystal DP, you can calculate the direction of
the beamB. You can actually estimateB to within about
108 from the vector cross product as follows
</p>
<p>B &frac14; g1 � g2 &frac14;
i1 i2 i3

</p>
<p>For the three-beam case, you can determine B with an
accuracy of �38. You first need to make sure that the
three vectors are taken in the correct order. Draw a
circle through these three reflections: if O is inside the
circle, then the g vectors should be numbered counter-
clockwise; if O is outside, number them clockwise.
Check your labeling; the determinant of the matrix in
equation 18.13 should be positive

<p>In Figures 18.19&ndash;18.21, we illustrate some of the
most useful DPs for bcc, fcc and hcp crystals. You can
extend these patterns as far as you wish using vector
addition; remember the reflections correspond to recip-
rocal-lattice vectors. For example, in Figure 18.19C

</p>
<p>&frac14; 110&eth; &THORN; &thorn; 01�1

</p>
<p>(18:15)

<p>You can extend the patterns in this way and then
apply the selection rules to find the corresponding
patterns for Si, etc., using the specific examples as a
guide.
</p>
<p>&amp; bcc real space &mdash;&gt; fcc reciprocal space.
&amp; fcc real space &mdash;&gt; bcc reciprocal space.
</p>
<p>Take the example used by Edington, as shown in
Figure 18.22 for an fcc crystal. Measure the distances
to the reflections x, y and z. Since the material is fcc, we
can ratio d 2 values to find suitable indices or use a
calibrated camera length. Thus we find that plane
A&frac14; (4�20), B&frac14; (111) and C&frac14; (�331); check that the
angles are correct using
</p>
<p>cos fAB&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
gA�gB
gAj j gBj j
</p>
<p>(18:16)
</p>
<p>and so on for fBC and fCA. You should immediately
recognize that this is the�&frac12;12�3� pole, but continue. Now
you can plug pairs of these indices into equation 18.11
or all of them 18.14 to show that B &frac14; &frac12;�1�23�.
</p>
<p>Finally, use the [001] stereographic projection.
Draw a great circle that passes through the (111),
&eth;2�10&THORN; and &eth;�331&THORN; points using your Wulff net: they all
lie on one great circle because they are in the same zone.
Now identify the zone axis directly by measuring 908
from all the poles. The result is, of course, the same in
each case.
</p>
<p>&amp; Notice that if you used the stereographic technique
with a non-cubic material, you would locate a direc-
tion, not a plane normal.
</p>
<p>&amp; You can make the determination of Bmore accurate
by making s&frac14; 0 for each reflection you use and then
estimating your deviation from this idealized orien-
tation. If the specimen is thicker, use Kikuchi lines
(Chapter 19).
</p>
<p>18.11 ORIENTATION RELATIONSHIPS
</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve learned how to index a DP and determine
B, you can determine orientation relationships (ORs),
which are one of the most useful aspects of diffraction in
the TEM for the materials scientist and nanotechnolo-
gist because the orientation between different grains,
phases or crystals controls many properties of engineer-
ing materials. For example, the OR will determine how
well the atomic planes in two different phases or grains
fit together and this controls the nature of the interphase
interface (e.g., coherent or incoherent) or grain bound-
ary (special or random) which, in turn, governs the ways
dislocations interact with the planar defect, thus con-
trolling the mechanical behavior of the material. There
are many other such effects of ORs; for example, we
often want to know how a fiber is oriented to the sur-
rounding matrix, a nanoparticle or a thin film to its
supporting substrate. So the OR between two different
crystals is important in many materials and can be
described in one of two ways
</p>
<p>&amp; Two directions or plane normals (or two sets of
parallel planes) can be parallel in the two crystals
(the parallel-plane/direction relationship). We use
this description for precipitate-matrix (b &ndash; a) orien-
tation relationships where the crystal systemsmay be
different.
</p>
<p>&amp; The two crystals have a common direction (axis) so
that one crystal can be rotated through some angle

to index both single-crystal patterns directly. If one of
them shows too few spots, you should try to record a
complementary Kikuchi pattern (next chapter) or
CBED pattern (subsequent two chapters) to provide
more information. With CBED patterns from very
small regions, you&rsquo;ll have to take a pattern in one crys-
tal, translate the specimen or traverse the beam and take
another pattern from the other grain.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go through the experimental steps for analyz-
ing the parallel-plane/direction relationship for two
phases a and b
</p>
<p>&amp; Tilt to the zone-axis pattern (ZAP) 1 in phase a, the
matrix phase. Record and index it to determine
B1(a).
</p>
<p>&amp; Translate the precipitate, b, onto the axis without
touching the beam-tilt controls and record another
DP. This pattern may not be exactly on a zone axis,
so it may be more difficult to index; then Kikuchi
lines may help considerably. Nevertheless, you need
to determine a parallel-beam direction,B1(b), for the
precipitate.
</p>
<p>&amp; Translate back to the matrix. Tilt the specimen in a
known direction until you find a different ZAP
(again, Kikuchi maps will help you do this). Record
and index ZAP 2 to give B2(a).
</p>
<p>&amp; Translate back to the precipitate, record the DP and
index it, giving you B2(b).
</p>
<p>&amp; Plot the position of B1 and B2 for both a and b on a
stereogram and construct the poles of the important
planes that are normal to each B. These will be the
low-index planes that you indexed in each pattern.
</p>
<p>So now you know that B1(a) is parallel to B1(b) and
B2(a) is parallel to B2(b). You can also see which plane
normals are parallel (if any) from the stereogram. So
you can quote the OR in terms of these two pairs of
parallel directions, or a pair of directions and a pair of
plane normals in the zone of each B. It may well be the
case that you can&rsquo;t find two low-index planes or direc-
tions that are parallel, in which case the orientation
relationship is not a strong one. However, there are
some well-known ORs between phases that you should
know
</p>
<p>&amp; Best known is the cube/cubeOR. If an fcc precipitate
forms inside an fcc matrix (e.g., Al3Li (d
</p>
<p>0) in an Al-Li
(a) solid solution), then we find:
</p>
<p>[100]d0 is parallel to [100]a,
(010)d0 is parallel to (010)a.
</p>
<p>Obviously, in these circumstances, any two
&lt;UVW&gt; directions or {hkl} planes in the cubic
system would be parallel. It&rsquo;s just convention to
choose the lowest-index planes or directions to
define the OR. When the lowest-index planes and
directions align, the surface energy between the
phases tends to be lowest, so this configuration is
thermodynamically favored.
</p>
<p>&amp; The Kurdjumov-Sachs OR is often found relating
fcc and bcc crystalline grains. The close-packed
planes (or closest packed in bcc) and close-packed
directions are parallel, but these are not now
identical
</p>
<p>(111)fcc is parallel to (011)bcc (the closest-packed
planes),
</p>
<p>&frac12;10�1�fcc is parallel to &frac12;11�1�bcc (the close-packed
directions),
</p>
<p>&eth;�12�1&THORN;fcc is parallel to &eth;
�21�1&THORN;bcc.
</p>
<p>&amp; The Nishiyama&ndash;Wassermann OR is related to the
Kurdjumov&ndash;Sachs OR
</p>
<p>&frac12;0�11�fcc is parallel to [001]bcc,
&eth;�111&THORN;fcc is parallel to &eth;
</p>
<p>�110&THORN;bcc (the closest-packed
planes),
</p>
<p>(211)fcc is parallel to (110)bcc.
</p>
<p>If you plot this out on a stereogram, you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s only a
few degrees away from the Kurdjumov&ndash;Sachs
relationship.
&amp; The fcc and hcp systems also share an OR in which
the close-packed planes and directions are parallel:
</p>
<p>(111)fcc is parallel to (0001)hcp (the close-packed
planes),
</p>
<p>&frac12;1�10�fcc is parallel to &frac12;1
�210�hcp (the close-packed
</p>
<p>directions).
</p>
<p>If you want to determine an axis-angle pair you
proceed in a similar way. Obtain two indexed beam
directions, B1 and B2, in each crystal, and plot them on
a stereogram. Then you need to determine from the
stereogram which angle brings the directions and
planes from one crystal into coincidence with the
other crystal.
</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a full discussion of these methods in Eding-
ton&rsquo;s text; Randle and Ralph summarize the various
methods available to determine boundary crystallogra-
phy and many more examples of ORs are described in
the companion text.
</p>
<p>18.12 COMPUTER ANALYSIS
</p>
<p>Although you must be able to analyze and index DPs
&lsquo;by hand,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;ll use one of the many
available software packages, especially if your specimen
is not cubic (see, e.g., Section 1.6 and URLs #1, 4&ndash;7).
The main challenge comes when you have to index the
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>DP of a new material. Your laboratory should have the
standard reference sources listed at the end of the chap-
ter. The approach simply requires that you collect all the
data you can and then search through the ICDD pow-
der diffraction files, or better still the NIST/Sandia/
ICPD electron-diffraction database (see URL #5),
until you find a match. Yes, it is a lot of work and you
have to remember some rules
</p>
<p>&amp; Measurements made on calibrated SADPs will be
accurate to 1&ndash;2%. If you think you&rsquo;remore accurate,
you may eliminate the material you&rsquo;re seeking from
your database search!
</p>
<p>&amp; Check for multiple domains and double diffraction
first. A schematic of such a DP is shown in Figure
18.23. As you can appreciate from the schematic, you
must be careful not to confuse such patterns with
those showing systematic absences.
</p>
<p>A strategy for search-and-match procedures has been
given by Lyman and Carr. The goal of the exercise is to
identify all the possible compounds that could produce
yourDP. Then you can use other data (e.g., the chemistry
deduced by XEDS or EELS) to make the final identifica-
tion. Computers not only give us the speed to make such

<p>searches possible, but are also more objective. The proce-
dure has four simple steps
</p>
<p>&amp; Obtain reliable data (and do not be too optimistic or
overconfident in your accuracy).
</p>
<p>&amp; Search the database for possible matches. With the
right database, chemical information will help.
</p>
<p>&amp; Test the matches you find. Are any of them possible
given what you know about your specimen?
</p>
<p>&amp; Confirm the identification. Now you can go back to
the microscope and use CBED to explore symmetry
elements, improve your lattice-parameter measure-
ments, etc. (Chapters 20 and 21).
</p>
<p>&amp; You should also simulate the DPs to confirm that
the popular software packages do reproduce what
you see. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea to carry out this exercise
up front using known areas of your specimen or
standard specimens before you attack the identifica-
tion of unknowns.
</p>
<p>18.13 AUTOMATED ORIENTATION
DETERMINATION AND ORIENTATION
MAPPING
</p>
<p>In a parallel way to EBSD patterns in the SEM, a
sequence of computer-indexed DPs can be transformed
into an orientation map, which is an image in which the
contrast or color links areas of similar orientation. One
way to do this is via Automated Crystallography for
TEM (ACT) developed by Dingley and available
</p>
<p>commercially via EDAX. ACT gives you on-line orien-
tation determination using hollow-coneDF imaging. As
shown back in Figure 9.15A, the beam is tilted and
rotated by the scan coils and strong diffracted beams
travel sequentially down the optic axis as individual
Bragg reflections occur. Digital DF images are collected
at each beam position by an on-axis CCD camera as
each grain diffracts at different orientations and a par-
allel-beam SADP is built up.
</p>
<p>When the incident beam satisfies the Bragg con-
dition for a given grain, the corresponding area in
the DF image appears bright. After scanning, the
recorded DF images are examined. In the DF
images, recorded at different incident-beam posi-
tions, a specific pixel always corresponds to the
same area in the specimen. The intensity of each
pixel can be drawn as a function of beam tilt and
rotation angle (i.e., a DP). Adjacent pixels having
the same DP are from the same grain, and thus a
grain map can be built. Figure 18.24A shows four
grains with five grain boundaries in a specimen of
Cu. Figure 18.24B shows a set of reconstructed DPs
from four grains (I&ndash;IV). Once the DPs for all the
grains are reconstructed, the orientation relation-
ships across the boundaries (1&ndash;5) between the neigh-
boring grains can be extracted and Figure 18.24C
shows the orientation map for the four grains. As in
the SEM it is easy to contemplate combining the
diffraction data with elemental data gathered by
XEDS and/or EELS and carrying out on-line phase
identification.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter has been concerned almost entirely with experimental technique.
</p>
<p>&amp; The stereographic projection is a very helpful aid. It&rsquo;s similar to projections we use to
map the earth. Diffraction space (like global space) is three-dimensional. The stereo-
graphic projection gives us a two-dimensional map to guide us from pole to pole!
</p>
<p>&amp; How do you obtain the best DP from your specimen? Use the right exposure, always
focus the DP and use the best technique (CBED or SAD�Kikuchis) for the size of the
area of interest.
</p>
<p>&amp; Take the trouble and time always to get good DPs. You never know when you&rsquo;ll really
need that information and an extra 9 or 29 seconds exposure time is not long, con-
sidering how long you&rsquo;ll spend analyzing the results!
</p>
<p>&amp; Which type of DP should you use? This depends on the characteristics of your speci-
men and what you want to know.
</p>
<p>&amp; Remember that reflections with moderately large values of g should give you the best
value for both d and f, but be absolutely sure that s&frac14; 0 for your chosen g.
</p>
<p>&amp; DPs from polycrystalline, nanocrystalline and amorphous materials contain a wealth
of information. The added value that the various TEM techniques bring over X-ray
diffraction is the spatial resolution and the accompanying images. TEM may not give
the best statistics; XRD only gives statistics.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Computer indexing of DPs should be the norm and should be automatic if you know
your material. If you understand the principles discussed here, you will avoid a few
pitfalls.
</p>
<p>&amp; Computer control of the beam and computer indexing can also be combined to
form orientation maps of the distribution of different grain orientations or
textures.
</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll repeat our word of caution: there is a very famous paper on interstitial
defects in a ceramic and a follow-up paper on vacancy defects. The first paper missed the
1808 ambiguity in the DP! Don&rsquo;t fall into such good company.

<p>TEXT-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
T18.1 Describe how you would excite 13g when O is on the optic axis if you can&rsquo;t see 13g on the screen.
</p>
<p>T18.2 Index the DPs in Figure 18.7 to be consistent with the (invisible) Kikuchi lines and with each other (after

<p>you&rsquo;ve read Chapter 19).
</p>
<p>T18.3 We note in Section 18.6 that, unlike those from polycrystalline materials, DPs from amorphous

<p>materials do not show speckle. However, speckle from amorphous materials is the basis for the

<p>Kikuchi Diffraction
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>In this chapter and the following two, we will discuss two special cases of electron diffrac-
tion. We&rsquo;ll see that incoherently scattered, divergent beams of electrons give rise to paired
arrays of lines in SADPs, known as Kikuchi patterns. In the next two chapters, we will form
DPs with a convergent rather than a divergent (or, as in the previous chapter, parallel)
beam. These two techniques have a lot in common. In the first, the electrons are initially
being scattered by the atoms in the crystal so that they &lsquo;lose all memory of direction&rsquo; and
may also lose energy. We can then think of these electrons as traveling in diverging
&lsquo;incident&rsquo; directions into the specimen. When the direction is appropriate, these electrons
can be scattered again, this time by Bragg diffraction. In the second technique, we intention-
ally form a convergent beam in the illumination system tomake the electrons incident on the
crystal over a range of different angles and create convergent-beam electron diffraction
(CBED) patterns. In this case, we have another advantage in that we can focus the beam on
a much smaller area of the specimen than in SAD. In both cases the information gained is
enhanced if the specimen is thicker; in the case of Kikuchi patterns it has to be thick enough
for inelastic scattering to occur and in CBED it has to be thick enough for dynamical
scattering. So these next three chapters are particularly useful if you can&rsquo;t make your
specimen thin enough for almost all other TEM techniques, which generally produce better
quality information if the specimen is thinner.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will show that these Kikuchi patterns can be used to give us
much more accurate information on the beam direction than SADPs and can also give
a direct link in reciprocal space to the stereographic projection. The topics we&rsquo;ll cover
are basically experimental (although the phenomenon is well understood theoretically)
and software for computer simulation of Kikuchi patterns is readily available and very
useful. The ideas we develop in this chapter will carry over to the next two chapters
when we discuss higher-order Laue-zone (HOLZ) lines in CBED patterns (where
Kikuchi lines can also appear).
</p>
<p>19.1 THE ORIGIN OF KIKUCHI LINES
</p>
<p>The reason Kikuchi patterns form is that, if the speci-
men is thick enough, it will generate a large number of
scattered electrons which travel in all (but mainly for-
ward) directions; i.e., they have been incoherently scat-
tered but not necessarily inelastically scattered
(although obviously some of themwill have lost energy).
They are sometimes referred to as diffusely scattered
electrons. These electrons can then be Bragg diffracted
by the crystal planes. The rest of the story is merely
geometry.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll discuss a little of the theory in Section 19.5, but
for now we&rsquo;ll note the following experimental facts
</p>
<p>&amp; Since typical energy losses are small (15&ndash;25 eV) com-
pared to E0 (100&ndash;400 keV) the diffusely scattered
electrons can be assumed to have the same l as the
incident electrons. This assumption holds as long as
the specimen is not too thick.
</p>
<p>&amp; When first formed, most of the diffusely scattered
electrons travel close to the direction of the incident
beam. You learned back in Chapter 3 that inelastic
scattering is &lsquo;peaked in the forward direction.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>19.1 THE OR IG IN OF K IKUCH I L INES ..................................................................................................................................................... 311</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; The ideal specimen thickness will be such that we can
see both the spot pattern and the Kikuchi lines as
illustrated in Figure 19.1. As noted, this is one of the
few situations when thinner is not necessarily better.
</p>
<p>&amp; Although this phenomenon is related exclusively to
electron scattering, Kikuchi described it in 1928,
before the development of the TEM; it can occur in
any crystalline specimen.
</p>
<p>Diffuse scattering will again be important when we
discuss forming images from these electrons in Section
31.5. We can select a region of reciprocal space contain-
ing diffusely scattered electrons to form the image
and these electrons can be separated from the inelasti-
cally scattered electrons with an energy filter (see Sections
38.2 and 40.5). Your specimen needs to be thick enough
but, if it is too thick, then there will be no Kikuchi lines
because inelastic scattering then dominates and there is
no detectable Bragg diffraction of these electrons. There
will also be no Bragg spots and no useful DP!
</p>
<p>19.2 KIKUCHI LINES AND BRAGG
SCATTERING
</p>
<p>The geometry of Kikuchi patterns can be understood
from Figure 19.2 which relates what happens in the
specimen to what we see in the DP. Let&rsquo;s imagine
(Figure 19.2A) that electrons have been generated at
the point shown and are scattered in all directions (but

<p>hkl planes. The diffracted electrons formKossel cones centered at P on the

<p>diffracting planes. The lines closest to the incident beam direction are dark
</p>

</p>
<p>intercept the Ewald sphere, creating parabolas which approximate to
</p>
<p>straight lines in the DPs because yB is small.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>mainly forward). So we draw them as diverging from a
point even though, in fact, they&rsquo;ll be scattered at differ-
ent points throughout the specimen thickness. Some of
these electrons will travel at an angle yB to the hkl planes
as shown in Figure 19.2B and then be Bragg diffracted
by these specific planes. Since the scattered electrons are
traveling in all directions, the diffracted beam will lie on
one of two cones (Figure 19.2C). In other words, we see
cones of diffracted electrons rather than well-defined
beams because there is a range of incident k-vectors
rather than a single k-vector. We construct the cones
by considering all the vectors oriented at angle yB to the
hkl plane; these are called Kossel cones and the cone
angle (90&ndash;yB) is very small (remember, angle really
means semi-angle). There is a pair of Kossel cones for
�g, another pair for �2g and so on.
</p>
<p>Since the screen/detector is flat and nearly normal to
the incident beam, the Kossel cones appear as parabo-
las. If we consider regions close to the optic axis, these
parabolas appear as two parallel lines. (Remember how
close to 908 the cone angle is.) We&rsquo;ll sometimes refer to
this pair of Kikuchi lines as a &lsquo;Kikuchi band&rsquo; to include
the lines and the region between them; the contrast
associated with the region between the lines is actually
quite complex (Section 19.6).
</p>
<p>We can make another important observation on the
intensity of these lines by considering Figure 19.2 again.
In Figure 19.2B you can see that the scattered beam
which was initially closest to the optic axis, and therefore
themore intense, is farther away from the axis after being
Bragg diffracted. This beam then gives the excess (bright)
line and the other the deficient (dark) line. You can see
that this simple idea really does work in Figure 19.1.
</p>
<p>The value of this result comes when we want to index
a pair of Kikuchi lines: if you find a bright line, its
partner must not only be parallel to it but must also be
closer to O, and dark. The pair is separated by 2yB.
</p>
<p>The cones shown in Figure 19.2C act as if they are
rigidly fixed to the plane hkl; they are thus &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; to the
crystal. We can draw a line half way between the two
Kikuchi lines to represent the trace of the plane (hkl).
Remember our angles are all small. This simple
</p>
<p>observation explains why we have a whole chapter on
Kikuchi lines.
</p>
<p>The location of the Kikuchi line will also tell us
whether s is positive or negative. We can&rsquo;t usually
deduce that from the spot pattern.
</p>
<p>The distance in reciprocal space between the �g and g
Kikuchi lines is g (not 2g) because the angle between the
two Kossel cones is 2yB. This relationship is very valu-
able for the following reasons
</p>
<p>&amp; When the g Kikuchi line passes through the reflec-
tion G, sg = 0 (i.e., the Bragg condition is exactly
satisfied) and the �g Kikuchi line passes through O.
So we can use the Kikuchi lines to set up specific
diffraction conditions exciting specific reflections as
we tilt the specimen (see Figure 19.3). We&rsquo;ll see later
that we can also use Kikuchi lines to determine the
exact value of sgwhenwe are close to, but not exactly
at, an exact Bragg condition.
</p>
<p>&amp; A corollary: if the direct beam is exactly parallel to the
plane hkl, the g and �gKikuchi lines are symmetrically
displaced about O with the g Kikuchi line &lsquo;passing
through&rsquo; g/2 and the �g line &lsquo;passing through&rsquo; �g=2.
</p>
<p>In this latter case, our simple explanation of Kikuchi-
line formation breaks down, because Figure 19.2 predicts
equal intensity in both excess and deficient Kikuchi lines
and they would both, therefore, be indistinguishable
from the diffuse-scattered background. So no Kikuchi
lines should be visible if the beam is exactly down a zone
axis, and this is patently not true. So the full Kikuchi-line
explanation is more complex and (unfortunately)
requires Bloch-wave theory. But we do understand the
process in great detail.
</p>
<p>19.3 CONSTRUCTING KIKUCHI MAPS
</p>
<p>If instead of just taking pictures of Kikuchi-line pairs, we
assemble amontage of all Kikuchi lines and spot patterns
</p>
<p>FOR ANY PAIR OF KIKUCHI LINES
One line corresponds to yB and the other to �yB; one
is the gKikuchi line and the other the �gKikuchi line.
Neither of them is the 0Kikuchi line.
</p>
<p>TILTING AND KIKUCHI LINES
If we tilt the crystal through a very small angle, the
Kikuchi lines will move but the intensities of the diffrac-
tion spots will hardly change and the positions of the
spots will not change. So Kikuchi lines are much more
sensitive to beam/specimen tilts than spots in SADPs.
</p>
<p>SEEING KOSSEL CONES
What we see in the DP is the intersection of these two
cones with the screen or detector.
</p>
<p>KIKUCHI MAP
Making a Kikuchi map is a highly recommended
exercise if you are going to be doing detailed diffrac-
tion-contrast images/SAD experiments because
familiarity with the Kikuchi map will help you to
immediately identify the orientation of your speci-
men on your TEM screen.
</p>
<p>19.3 CONSTRUCT ING K IKUCHI MAPS ..................................................................................................................................................... 313</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>over a wide array of reciprocal space, then we create a
Kikuchi map.
</p>
<p>The method for constructing Kikuchi maps is illu-
strated in Figure 19.4A. First, we draw the lines for
the case where the [001] pole is exactly on the optic
axis. The lines are then the perpendicular bisectors of
every g-vector you can find in the ZOLZ. The distance
between each pair of lines is then automatically |g|. We
can then give each line a unique label g.
</p>
<p>Next, we can construct the map for the [101] pole.
We start as shown in Figure 19.4B, keeping the
common 020 g-vector pointing in the same direction.
So, the 020 and 0�20 Kikuchi lines are common to
the two patterns. Although the angle between the
[001] and [101] poles is 458, we draw the 020 lines
as parallel and straight because we are always look-
ing at a small segment of the Kikuchi pattern.
Notice that we can define all the distances in terms
of their equivalent angles, as in any DP.
</p>
<p>Now we add the [112] pattern. This pattern shares
the 2�20 and �220 reflections with the [001] pole and shares
the �1�11 and 11�1 reflections with the [101] pole. The
corresponding pairs of Kikuchi lines will then also be
common, so we produce the triangle shown in
</p>
<p>Figure 19.5A.We can addother poles andpairs ofKikuchi
lines as shown in Figure 19.5B to get the full pattern.
</p>
<p>A Kikuchi map for an fcc material is illustrated in
Figure 19.6. The maps are available in the literature for
fcc, bcc, diamond cubic and some hcp materials. Such
maps are mainly from Thomas and co-workers (Levine
et al. 1966,Okamoto et al. 1967, Johari andThomas 1969),
who developed the technique. Edington (1976) presents
several Kikuchi maps in the appendices. Maps can also
be downloaded from the Web using EMS (URL #1).
</p>
<p>You can appreciate the value of Kikuchi maps in non-
cubic materials from the map shown in Figure 19.7. The
map has been drawn for Ag2Al, which has the same c/a
ratio as Ti. TheKikuchi bands are labeled (remember that
they correspond to planes). The zone axes are also labeled:
they correspond to directions. Thinking back to our brief
discussion of Frank&rsquo;s paper on four-index notation in
Chapter 16, you should see an obvious application here.
</p>
<p>&amp; For cubic materials you need only the [001], [101],
[111] triangle shown in Figure 19.5B.
</p>
<p>&amp; For hcp materials, the angles will generally depend
on the c/a ratio of your material and you&rsquo;ll need a
larger area of the map.

<p>&amp; For most non-cubic materials and particularly if
you are working withmonoclinic or triclinic crystals,
it&rsquo;s not practical to construct the complete map
experimentally. It&rsquo;s probably easier to become a
metallurgist!
</p>
<p>We can use the following procedure to generate a
valuable experimental aid for any material.
</p>
<p>&amp; Construct segments of the map to scale as we&rsquo;ve
illustrated in Figure 19.5B. You can use one of the
software packages to help you in this task.Make two
copies of each map.
</p>
<p>&amp; While you&rsquo;re at the TEM, record the Kikuchi pat-
tern for several special low-index poles along with
the spot pattern.
</p>
<p>&amp; Index the DPs consistently.
&amp; Print both DPs for each zone axis at the scale you
used in your line drawing of the Kikuchi map.
</p>
<p>&amp; Now add the experimental patterns to the line dia-
grams and you have two very useful experimental
aids. An illustration is given in Figure 19.8.
</p>
<p>When discussing Kikuchi maps, we like to use the
road-map analogy. (Repeatedly!) What we just recom-
mended is that you record the maps of the towns with
pictures so that you&rsquo;ll recognize them. When you&rsquo;re on
the highway traveling from town to town, you don&rsquo;t
much care what the road looks like although you do
want to know how far you&rsquo;ve traveled and how much
farther you have to go.
</p>
<p>By now youwill appreciate evenmore the value of the
stereographic projection we introduced in Chapter 18.

together. The stereographic projection concisely sum-
marizes all the relative locations of all the plane normals
and the zone axes. Use the stereographic projection to
relate Storrs and Huntsville, but use the Kikuchi map to
locate the Benton Museum of Art and the Von Braun
Center.
</p>
<p>19.4 CRYSTAL ORIENTATION AND
KIKUCHI MAPS
</p>
<p>In the previous chapter we showed how you could use
SADPs to estimate the orientation of the beam relative
to the crystal with an accuracy of �38. Using Kikuchi
patterns you can increase this accuracy to �18.
</p>
<p>A routine method for orientation determination was
developed by Thomas and co-workers (e.g., Okamoto
et al.); they pioneered the use of Kikuchi maps in TEM
analysis. The beam direction [UVW] lies along the optic
axis O in Figure 19.9. A, B and C are major poles (i.e.,
zone axes) which we can determine by observation and
measurement. Let the indices of A = [p1 q1 r1], B = [p2
q2 r2] and C= [p3 q3 r3]. Having indexed these poles, we
can check our result by measuring the angles a, b and g
between the traces of the planes in Figure 19.9A (which
equals the angle, f, between the plane normals in all
systems); we must calculate each angle using equation
18.3 if the specimen is cubic.
</p>
<p>If we measure the distances OA, OB and OC in
Figure 19.9A, we can convert them into angles r1, r2
and r3 (which are defined in Figure 19.9B) by using our
calibrated camera length. If [UVW] is the direction of
the beam, then we can use the same vector-dot-product
approach (equation 18.4 for the cubic case) to give
equations for r1, r2 and r3. Notice we are distinguishing
between r andf (see Section 18.4). The angles a, b and g
in Figure 19.9A are slightly distorted values of (90 &ndash;f).
</p>
<p>We can solve these three equations for the three
unknowns U, V and W and hence we have B. Finally,
you should always check the sign of B, as we described
in Section 18.10.

</p>

<p>It is possible that the DP you have to work with is
not obviously near a zone axis. All is not lost if you can
just find pairs of Kikuchi lines as shown in Figure 19.10.
If you see an excess line you will find the deficient line
quite easily, closer to 000. Now trace these lines in both
directions and you have found the poles. Use your
knowledge of the d-spacings to index the pairs of Kiku-
chi lines. Remember that the zone axis lies parallel to
each plane so it&rsquo;s defined by where the two plane traces
meet. Now, if you can index three poles, you can obtain
B as in Figure 19.9.
</p>
<p>19.5 SETTING THE VALUE OF Sg
</p>
<p>Since the Kikuchi lines are &lsquo;rigidly attached&rsquo; to the
crystal, they give us a very accurate measure of the
excitation error sg. The diffraction geometry is shown
in Figure 19.11 following Okamoto et al. When sg is
negative, the gKikuchi line is on the same side of g as O;
</p>
<p>when sg is positive, the line lies on the opposite side of g.
If you look at Figure 19.10 you&rsquo;ll see that the bright
diffraction spot at the top LH corner of the DP is under
sg positive conditions (excess Kikuchi line outside the
spot), the bright spot at the middle/upper RH side is
under sg zero conditions (the excess Kikuchi line
through the spot) and the bright spot toward the bottom
of the DP is under sg negative conditions (the excess
Kikuchi line inside the spot).
</p>
<p>For high-energy electrons, and knowing the camera
length L, we can write an expression for the angle Z in
Figure 19.11
</p>
<p>FIGURE 19.10. To index a DP well away from a low-index zone axis,
</p>
<p>extend the Kikuchi lines. The dark lines 1&ndash;4 represent the traces of the
</p>
<p>diffracting planes which intercept at a pole (P). For Kikuchi lines 1 and 2,
</p>
<p>the higher-order extensions are also drawn. From the d-spacings, index
</p>
<p>the Kikuchi-line pairs. The angles between the beam direction and the
</p>
<p>poles, P, can then be measured directly.

<p>19.6 INTENSITIES
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll conclude with a few remarks for further thought
</p>
<p>&amp; Tan et al. have shown experimentally that the dis-
tance between a pair of Kikuchi lines may change at
larger specimen thicknesses due to dynamical
scattering.
</p>
<p>&amp; Kikuchi lines can also be produced by the backscat-
tered electrons. In the SEM these patterns are termed
electron-backscatter DPs (sometimes EBSPs) and the
technique as EBSD. They were regarded as a curios-
ity until it was shown (see Dingley&rsquo;s paper) that you
can map out the texture of polycrystalline materials
using these patterns, without thinning the sample.
Not much happened for a decade or more until new
detection systems, using CCD cameras and fast com-
puter algorithms led to the development of orienta-
tion imaging microscopy (OIM) (see Dingley&rsquo;s
review). As we saw in Section 18.13, similar techni-
ques are available for automatic indexing of TEM
DPs and Kikuchi maps. They aren&rsquo;t as automated,
nor can they index as many patterns as EBSD soft-
ware because there are usually far fewer thin grains in
our specimens than crystals in an SEM specimen. But
TEM can, in principle, give the interface plane much
more accurately, so the two techniques will become
more complementary with time.
</p>
<p>&amp; In the next chapter, we&rsquo;ll discuss HOLZ lines; HOLZ
lines are very closely related to Kikuchi lines but are
a little more complicated, since the Bragg planes are
always inclined to the direct beam.
</p>
<p>&amp; In Chapter 24, we&rsquo;ll discuss ZAPs, or zone-axis pat-
terns, in images; these ZAPs are, inmany respects, the
real-space version of Kikuchi lines. However, you&rsquo;ll
see that their physical origin is completely different;
the most important features of ZAPs are not asso-
ciated with incoherent, inelastic or diffuse scattering.
</p>
<p>&amp; Bloch waves with vector k1, for example, are more
strongly scattered than those corresponding to
branch 2 of the dispersion surface. Therefore, we
can expect anomalous absorption (see Chapter 24)
to influence the intensity of Kikuchi patterns. Such
effects do in fact lead to excess and deficient Kikuchi
bands. Since we haven&rsquo;t yet found any use for the
information in these bands we&rsquo;ll leave them as an
exercise for further reading!
</p>
<p>&amp; We mentioned earlier that the contrast between the
Kikuchi lines, i.e., theKikuchi band, is complex. The
contrast is strongly influenced by anomalous
absorption of the Bloch waves which are formed by
coherent scattering of the incoherently scattered
electron, so all is clear.
</p>
<p>&amp; There are strong similarities between the Kikuchi
process and the operation of a monochromator in
optics: both select and diffract a particular wave-
length or frequency.
</p>
<p>&amp; You can appreciate that the scattering is quite com-
plex by considering what happens when the diffract-
ing plane is exactly parallel to the incident beam: as
we&rsquo;ve mentioned, the two Kikuchi lines will both be
visible although you might have guessed otherwise.
</p>
<p>Back in Chapter 6 we noted that electron ray paths
rotate through the objective-lens field, but in all our
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>discussion on diffraction (including Kikuchi lines and
the CBEDpatterns in the next two chapters) we draw all
the electron paths as straight lines, ignoring any rota-
tion. However, particularly in a modern condenser-
objective lens TEM, the lens field is relatively strong
and can introduce a significant rotation into the off-
axis incident and diffracted electrons (we described c/o
</p>
<p>lenses and their effects on ray paths back in various
sections of Chapter 9). An interesting consequence of
this effect is that Kikuchi lines in modern TEMs may be
less sharp than in older TEMs, unless you illuminate
only a very small area of the specimen. If you&rsquo;re in-
trigued by this problem then you must read &lsquo;&lsquo;Skew
thoughts on parallelism&rsquo;&rsquo; by Christenson and Eades.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Pairs ofKikuchi lines define the road and, taken together, the roadsmake up amapof reciprocal
space. However, the key is different from real-space road maps because in our Kikuchi maps,
narrow roads are the most important! What is the relevance of the roadside curbs? Well, they
define the roads and tell us when we are standing on them, but we are not too interested in their
detailed appearance.You should by nowbe under the (correct) impression that we viewKikuchi
lines and maps as an invaluable tool for the microscopist. The key points are
</p>
<p>&amp; The Kikuchi lines arise from Bragg diffraction of divergent, incoherent
electrons scattered within the specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; The Kikuchi lines consist of an excess (bright) line and a deficient (dark) line.
In the DP, the excess line is farther from the direct beam than the deficient line.
</p>
<p>&amp; The Kikuchi lines are effectively fixed to the crystal so we can use them to
determine orientations accurately.
</p>
<p>&amp; The trace of the diffracting planes is midway between the excess and deficient lines.
&amp; We can use the Kikuchi lines to set up specific (e.g., two-beam) diffracting conditions
which are central to diffraction-contrast imaging.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can control and determine the value of sg by measuring the separation between the
gKikuchi line and the G reflection (the separation is 0 when sg =0). The precise value
of sg is also very important in controlling diffraction contrast.
</p>
<p>Kikuchi lines and maps are two of the most important aids you have when orienting (or
determining the orientation of) crystalline specimens. Knowing the orientation of your
specimen is essential for any form of quantitative TEM, whether you&rsquo;re analyzing disloca-
tion Burgers vectors by diffraction contrast, imaging grain boundaries with lattice resolu-
tion or measuring chemistry variations by EELS or XEDS. Kikuchi maps are especially
useful when combined with the map of zones and poles (directions and plane normals) on
the stereographic projection. Use a computer to check or to assist you in constructing such a
map for your material but if you&rsquo;re doing any serious crystallography, never leave home or
sit at your TEM without a map to guide you.

</p>
<p>Obtaining CBED Patterns
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>We know that SAD, while giving us useful information about the specimen, has two severe
limitations.
</p>
<p>&amp; We have to be very cautious in interpreting SADPs from areas which are &lt; �0.5 mm in
diameter because the information in the pattern may not be limited to that region. This
scale is still large compared to the dimensions of many crystalline features that interest us
in materials science and much larger than nanotechnology dimensions.
</p>
<p>&amp; SADPs contain only rather imprecise 2D crystallographic information because the
Bragg conditions are relaxed for thin specimens and small grains within the specimen
(see Chapter 17).
</p>
<p>The technique of CBED overcomes both of these limitations and also generates much
new diffraction information which we will introduce to you in Chapter 21 and expand in
greater depth in the companion text.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will show you how simple it is to use the versatility of modern TEMs
to create a range of CBEDpatterns containing a variety of very useful contrast effects such
as higher-order Laue-zone (HOLZ) spots and lines. In Chapter 21 and the companion
text, you will see why these HOLZ features are so useful. They can give us a complete 3D
crystallographic analysis of our specimens. By now you are well aware that a major
advantage of doing anything in TEM is that we can get the information at high spatial
resolution at the same time as we are looking at the TEM image. CBED is no exception.
For most TEM operations, thinner specimens are better, but CBED patterns, like Kikuchi
patterns, are generally more useful from thicker specimens in which dynamical scattering
is occurring. Finally, as with many other sophisticated analytical techniques, CBED uses
various obscure initials and acronyms which we will attempt to clarify as we introduce
them.
</p>
<p>20.1 WHY USE A CONVERGENT BEAM?
</p>
<p>Historically, CBED is the oldest electron-diffraction
technique used in the TEM. It was originally developed
by Kossel and Möllenstedt, well before LePoole devel-
oped SAD. While SAD is the classic way to relate the
diffraction-contrast information in the TEM image to
the specimen orientation, it has a notable disadvantage.
Remember, we saw back in Chapters 9 and 11 that the
diameter of the smallest area you can select by SAD is
� 0.5 mm, with an uncertainty of similar dimensions.
However, if you have an intermediate-voltage HRTEM
with a very low Cs you may be able to extend the range
of SAD to analyze areas �100 nm in diameter, which is
still too large for examining any nanoscale material
</p>
<p>(particles, films, devices) as well as all crystal defects
and most second-phase precipitates which influence
the properties of conventional engineering materials.
All these features are much smaller than 0.1 mm. As
we described back in Figure 9.4, one way we can over-
come this limitation is to use a convergent beam of
electrons. The region sampled by the convergent beam
is a function of its size and the beam-specimen interac-
tion volume, which increases with specimen thickness
but is generally a lot smaller than the spatial limitations
of SAD. In fact, several so-called micro- and nanodif-
fraction methods have been developed over the past
40 years to overcome the spatial-resolution limitations
of SAD in a TEM. But CBED is by far the most
simple and versatile of these techniques and easily
</p>
<p>20.1 WHY U SE A CONVERGENT BEAM ? .................................................................................................................................................. 323</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>penetrates the nanotechnology domain (&lt; 100 nm), in
fact all the way down to single unit-cell dimensions
(truly nanodiffraction).
</p>
<p>In addition to offering improved spatial resolution,
CBEDpatterns contain awealth of crystallographic and
other data which are difficult or impossible to obtain via
SAD and we&rsquo;ll describe much of this new information in
the next chapter and in the companion text.
</p>
<p>With such capabilities, CBED has transformed dif-
fraction in the TEM from the &lsquo;poor relative&rsquo; of X-ray
and neutron diffraction to a more versatile and, in some
senses, a unique technique. CBED has already begun to
intrude significantly into XRD&rsquo;s traditional domain of
quantitative crystallography, as a cursory reading of the
contents of Acta Crystallographica will show.
</p>
<p>Some would argue persuasively that CBED should be
the diffraction method of first choice when operating a
TEM and this is not surprising given all the new informa-
tion you can access via CBED. However, much of diffrac-
tion theory, indexing methods, etc., were historically
developed for parallel-beam SADPs, and standard BF/
CDFandother imaging techniques build on suchpatterns.
So we have chosen to construct the text starting with SAD
and treat CBED as an &lsquo;enriched&rsquo; variant of SAD.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will concentrate on how you can
control the experimental variables to acquire and index
CBEDpatterns. In the next chapter, wewill introduce to
you, among other things, how to perform the basics of
what is known as &lsquo;electron crystallography.&rsquo; All the
advantages of CBED can simultaneously be coupled
with TEM images and spectrometry data thus allowing
you to achieve a remarkable degree of characterization
of the same region of your specimen at the same time.
</p>
<p>There are two potential drawbacks which you
should always keep in mind
</p>
<p>&amp; The focused probe may generate contamination
which can cause localized stresses.
</p>
<p>&amp; The convergent beam may heat or damage the cho-
sen region of your specimen.
</p>
<p>In early probe-forming TEMs, the operator only had
a few seconds to observe and record the CBED pattern
before carbon contamination built up to a thickness
which masked all the information. Modern TEMs, par-
ticularly UHV instruments, should not suffer from this
problem (see Chapter 8). You should be able to study
small regions of a clean specimen for many minutes or
even hours without contamination.
</p>
<p>As we described in Chapter 4, beam heating/damage
may be a problem in materials with poor thermal con-
ductivity but this can be minimized by applying a thin
conductive coating or, preferably, by using a liquid-N2
cooling holder. This latter approach has other advan-
tages for CBED, as we&rsquo;ll see.
</p>
<p>You will probably find that it is experimentally easier
to do CBED rather than SAD. SAD is used if your
primary interest is the image. In CBED, there&rsquo;s no insert-
ing and removing of diaphragms andmore information is
almost always obtained, invariably from smaller regions.
You might not find this fact reflected in your reading of
the TEM literature, but remember that researchers
(including the authors) often use the technique with
which they are most familiar, rather than the best one
available. It&rsquo;s also appropriate here to mention why we
include the &lsquo;E&rsquo; inCBEDbut rarely in SAD; it&rsquo;s only sowe
can pronounce the initials as &lsquo;&lsquo;see-bed.&rsquo;&rsquo; (Happily no one
ever says &lsquo;&lsquo;sad&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;said&rsquo;&rsquo; for thatmatter.) But if the world
were logical then all men would ride sidesaddle.
</p>
<p>20.2 OBTAINING CBED PATTERNS
</p>
<p>First, which holder should you use?As with SAD you will
need to do a lot of tilting so a double-tilt holder is
required. Some of the diffraction phenomena we will
be describing become more visible if the specimen is
cooled to liquid-N2 temperatures. If you want to carry
out XEDS and CBED simultaneously then you&rsquo;ll also
need a low-background holder.
</p>
<p>Single-tilt rotation holders can sometimes be advan-
tageous (e.g., to line up interfaces in certain directions)
and again are best if they can be cooled and are low
background (for XEDS).
</p>
<p>Second, which kV should you use? Indiffraction,unlike
most other TEM techniques, there is often an advantage to
using lower kVs since the elastic-scattering cross section is
higher. So the patterns are more intense. Also the Ewald
sphere ismore curvedat lowerkVsand so it interceptsmore
electrons scatteredat higher angles than those in theZOLZ.
However, higher kVs give higher-resolution information
from smaller volumes of your specimen and you can &lsquo;see&rsquo;
through thicker specimens. So you may have to compro-
mise and gather patterns over a range of kVs.
</p>
<p>CONTAMINATION
Most contamination is caused by the specimen-
preparation process or your careless handling of
your specimen.
</p>
<p>THE CBED ADVANTAGE
. . .over all other diffraction techniques is that most of
the information is generated from minuscule regions
beyond the reach of other diffraction methods. THE CBED HOLDER
</p>
<p>A double-tilt, cooling, low-background holder is
really useful for CBED.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third, how thick should your specimen be? As we
already mentioned, unlike most other TEM techniques,
thicker specimens can bemore useful than thinner speci-
mens since more dynamical scattering occurs. Much of
the undesirable diffuse scattering that hides the dynam-
ical information can be filtered out in an EFTEM (much
more about this later and in Section 38.2).
</p>
<p>20.2.A Comparing SAD and CBED
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s consider the differences in the electron optics of
SAD and CBED. In SAD the electron beam incident on
your specimen is parallel (fixed incident vector k) and
relatively large (usually �1&ndash;10 mm in diameter). In
CBED, the beam is convergent (range of k vectors) and
relatively small (usually �1&ndash;100nm in diameter) as
shown inFigure 20.1. (Compare this situationwithKiku-
chi patterns which are generated by a divergent beam of
electrons within the specimen.) We&rsquo;ve already seen in
Chapters 11 and 16 that parallel illumination means
that the SADP consists of an array of sharp maxima (or
spots) in the BFP of the objective lens and, as mentioned
inChapter 9, the beam convergence inCBEDgives rise to
a pattern of disks of intensity. Figure 20.2A shows an
SADP from pure Si and Figure 20.2B is a CBED pattern
from a much smaller region of the same Si specimen.
While it isn&rsquo;t obvious that the CBED pattern comes
from a smaller region of the specimen (i.e., has better
spatial resolution), you can certainly see that it contains a
wealth of contrast detail not present in the SADP. The
dark lines within the 000 disk and between the diffraction
</p>
<p>disks are HOLZ effects which we&rsquo;ll return to many times
throughout this and the next chapter. Converging the
beam, in effect, opens up a greater angular range of
reciprocal space for you to look into and in doing so it
reduces the angular resolution of the DP (which is not
something we worry about too much).
</p>

<p>lens system focuses the beam at the specimen, the illuminated area is very
</p>
<p>small compared with parallel-beam SADP formation. A convergent beam

<p>objective lens.

</p>
<p>RELATING SAD AND CBED
You can imagine CBED as magnifying the informa-
tion within the spots in the SAD. Like SAD, CBED is
most useful when you either orient the beam along a
zone axis in the crystal to give a symmetrical zone-
axis pattern (ZAP) or when you tilt to strong two-
beam conditions. Unlike SAD, CBED is also even
more useful when the probe is deliberately under- or
overfocused.
</p>
<p>20 .2 OBTA IN ING CBED PATTERNS ......................................................................................................................................................... 325</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>From Figure 20.1 you can see that we need a con-
denser/objective (c/o) lens (i.e., a strong upper-objective
polepiece) to create a convergent beam, so any probe-
forming TEM or dedicated STEM can generate such
patterns. We&rsquo;ve already described the lens systems and
ray diagrams associated with forming a convergent beam
in Chapters 6 and 9, so here we will emphasize the experi-
mental variables that you can control. The various steps
we describe below are covered in far greater detail, both
operationally and in terms of extraordinarily detailed ray
diagrams, in the essential text by Morniroli. We&rsquo;ll start
with TEM mode and then describe STEM operation.
</p>
<p>20.2.B CBED in TEM Mode
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to start practicing CBED with a thin,
single-crystal Si specimen or a stainless steel foil with
large grains, since these specimens give immediately
useful patterns containing many of the features that
we&rsquo;ll be describing (without the need for cooling). The
Si is a little easier since the parent wafer will be in a
specific orientation such as&lt;111&gt; and you&rsquo;ll invariably
get a pattern like Figure 20.2B.
</p>
<p>When you converge the beam in image mode, you&rsquo;ll
lose any useful image contrast and you&rsquo;ll just see a
bright spot on the TEM screen or computer display.
But if you aligned the condenser system correctly then
the beam will be focused on the region you chose. You
will develop your own procedure as you gain experience.
Basically the approach is as follows:
</p>
<p>&amp; Start with your specimen in the eucentric plane, as
usual. Weaken C2 to give a broad, parallel beam,
then focus an image with the feature from which you
want to obtain the CBED pattern in the middle of
the screen. It helps if you can do this without the
objective diaphragm inserted. If you need it, then
you&rsquo;ll have to take it out later (see below).
</p>
<p>&amp; Select a largeC2aperture about 100&ndash;200mmindiameter,
carefully center it, then adjust the C2 lens to converge
the beam to a focused spot on the area of interest.
</p>
<p>&amp; Keep C1 weakly excited to give a relatively large
spot, about 100 nm FWTM (see Chapter 5) which
should contain sufficient current to give a high-
intensity pattern.
</p>
<p>&amp; Select a small camera length, &lt; 500 mm to give a
wide-angle view of the pattern.
</p>
<p>&amp; To observe the CBED pattern, just switch to diffrac-
tion mode, making sure the objective and SAD dia-
phragms are retracted.
</p>
<p>Remember that you control the minimum illumi-
nated area on the screen (i.e., the beam diameter at the
specimen) by the strength of the C1 lens, so after these
initial steps, you might want to select a smaller probe
size by increasing the C1 strength.
</p>
<p>20.2.C CBED in STEM Mode
</p>
<p>You should first get a focused STEM image of the
specimen as we described in Section 9.4.
</p>
<p>The procedure is quite simple because in STEM
you&rsquo;re always operating with a focused probe and
you don&rsquo;t have imaging-system diaphragms to worry
about
</p>
<p>&amp; First, stop the beam scanning (i.e., select &lsquo;spot&rsquo; mode
on the STEM control system).
</p>
<p>&amp; Second, position the spot on the STEM screen on the
region of interest.
</p>
<p>A CBED pattern should then be visible on the TEM
screen, but to see it you may have to remove the STEM
detector if it sits above the TEM screen, or lower the
TEM screen if the detector is below. The CBED pattern
is present because the TEM is operated in the diffraction
mode during STEMoperation. As before, youmay have
to reduce L to ensure that several orders of diffraction
maxima are visible on the screen. The other variables are
the same, except that in STEM, the C2 lens in some
TEMs is automatically switched off. This means that
the C2 aperture alone governs a and you can only focus
the pattern with the objective lens.
</p>
<p>In a DSTEM you can see both image and DP at the
same time because the CBED pattern can be viewed by
introducing a screen after the last post-specimen lens
and viewing this screen with a TV camera. A hole in the
screen allows any selected portion of the pattern to
travel through the EELS to the BF detector and thus
both image and DP can be viewed simultaneously. If
you don&rsquo;t have post-specimen lenses then you can&rsquo;t vary
L; the CBED pattern is then viewed either directly using
a TV camera to image the BFP of the objective lens or by
scanning the pattern across the BF detector using post-
specimen scan coils (see Section 21.8).
</p>
<p>If you send the CBED pattern through the EELS
before viewing it, then you can switch on the EELS and
use it to filter out energy-loss electrons, or form the
patterns with electrons of a specific energy. Energy-
filtered CBED (which you can do in a TEM as well as
a STEM) is a most powerful technique, as we&rsquo;ll see (look
ahead to Figure 20.10).
</p>
<p>The choice of operating mode then is really up to
you; TEM and STEM both have their advantages.
</p>
<p>STEM AND CBED
In TEM you can&rsquo;t see the area of the specimen you
have chosen without spreading the convergent beam;
in STEM you can always scan the convergent beam
to see the image.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.3 EXPERIMENTAL VARIABLES
</p>
<p>To form CBED patterns, you have to create a small
(&lt; 100 nm) beam with a convergence semi-angle (a)
�10 mrads. There are at least five microscope variables
you need to control when forming a CBED pattern
</p>
<p>&amp; The beam-convergence angle a (remember, we mean
semi-angle)
</p>
<p>&amp; The camera length L (i.e., the magnification of the
pattern)
</p>
<p>&amp; The size of the beam (the probe diameter)
&amp; The thickness of the specimen
&amp; The focus of the pattern (under/over or exact)
</p>
<p>The last variable is the most complex because there
areCBED techniqueswhich require focused patterns and
those where we deliberately defocus the beam out of the
specimen plane to gain other advantages. So we&rsquo;ll deal
with this last variable separately. You can also change the
kV if you want and as we noted above, low kV gives
better contrast, but this is more than offset by the drop in
gun brightness and the increased beam spreading. So, for
materials specimens, most CBED is done at the highest
kV, as with most other TEM techniques.
</p>
<p>20.3.A Choosing the C2 Aperture
</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve read the next few sections you&rsquo;ll probably
conclude that any full CBED study should include pat-
terns taken with a range of camera lengths, a range of
exposures, a range of C2 apertures and that the more C2
apertures you have in your TEM the better. You&rsquo;ll be
right on all counts!
</p>
<p>Once the CBED pattern is visible on the screen you
can adjust a by changing the C2 aperture, making sure
to center the aperture you finally choose. The size of the
diffraction disks depends on a as shown in Figure 20.3
(go back and check equation 5.6). Let&rsquo;s start by choos-
ing a small aperture so we get a pattern of discrete disks,
similar to an SADP and we&rsquo;ll use the terminology first
introduced by Steeds.
</p>
<p>To get a K-M pattern you must select a C2 aperture
such that the disk size (governed by a) is less than the
spacing of the disks (governed by yB) for the particular
specimen and orientation. Typically, the Bragg angle is
a few milliradians, and C2 apertures in the 10&ndash;50mm
range will usually ensure that you have satisfied the K-M
conditions.
</p>
<p>If a is large enough for substantial overlap of the
disks to occur such that individual diffraction maxima
are no longer discernible, then the term &lsquo;Kossel pattern&rsquo;
is used (although this can cause confusion with the
classic use of the term for geometrically similar X-ray
patterns). Figure 20.3A&ndash;C shows a series of ray dia-
grams illustrating the transition from a K-M pattern
to a Kossel pattern by increasing 2a. Equivalent experi-
mental patterns from pure Al are shown in Figure
20.3D&ndash;F. The patterns in Figure 20.3 were all taken at
a small camera length and, although the contrast is not
particularly strong, you can clearly see rings of intensity
which arise from electrons scattered to quite high angles
(�108). We&rsquo;ll continue to read more about these HOLZ
diffraction effects throughout this chapter.
</p>
<p>Kossel patterns are most useful when viewed with a
small camera length (see next section) because they dis-
play a relatively extensive area of reciprocal space, and
the large value of a gives rise to Kikuchi bands. For
reasons we&rsquo;ll describe in Section 20.7, Kikuchi lines are
much more prevalent in CBED than in SADPs and
don&rsquo;t require the usual thick specimen. As we described
in Chapter 18, the Kikuchi bands intersect in the center
of the pattern when the beam is incident down a zone
axis, as you can see in Figure 20.3F. Thus it is very easy
for you to tilt to a particular zone axis, simply by follow-
ing the bands until they intersect. So, to form aZAP, it is
best to start at very smallLwith a large a. Later, you can
worry about the best choice of C2 aperture, best choice
of L and focusing the pattern. Because these Kossel
patterns cover a large angular range in reciprocal
space they are also an example of a whole class of
large-angle CBED or LACBED patterns (see Section
20.4.B below) in which we defocus the beam to enhance
the contrast compared with the Kossel patterns.
</p>
<p>Because we need to be able to vary a, a range of C2
apertures from about 10 mm up to 200 mm is desirable,
consistentwith the needs of other techniques.A reasonable
choice if you have only three C2 apertures: one of about
200 mm for routine TEM, EELS and Kossel patterns, a
50&ndash;70 mm ultra-thick aperture for XEDS (which can also
be used for STEM imaging and someK-Mpatterns) and a
10&ndash;20 mm aperture for most K-M patterns. Some TEMs
provide more than three apertures. More is better!
</p>
<p>Because the C2 lens is excited in TEMmode, you can
use it to change a; if you do, the objective lens has to be
changed to maintain a focused pattern. You need to
adjust C2 if you change the beam size with the C1 lens
or if you want a value of a between those given by the
fixed C2 apertures.
</p>
<p>KOSSEL AND MÖLLENSTEDT
The pattern of non-overlapping disks is a Kossel-
Möllenstedt (K-M) pattern. The pattern of com-
pletely overlapping disks is a Kossel pattern.
</p>
<p>STAY IN FOCUS!
Use the specimen-height (z) control to maintain the
specimen in the eucentric plane as you tilt. A compu-
ter-controlled stage is a great advantage.
</p>
<p>20 .3 EXPER IMENTAL VAR IABLES ............................................................................................................................................................. 327</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If you need to know the value of a, you should use a
known crystal to calibrate its variation with C2 aperture
size for typical C2 lens excitations, as we described back
in Section 9.1 and in equation 5.6.
</p>
<p>20.3.B Selecting the Camera Length
</p>
<p>The choice ofL depends on the information that youwant
to obtain from the pattern and it&rsquo;s easy to be confused
because L controls the magnification of the DP.
</p>
<p>Typically we adjust the post-objective lenses in the
imaging system to give L&gt; 1500&ndash;6000mm when we
want to observe detail in the 000 (BF) disk at the highest
</p>
<p>possible magnification. We reduce L to &lt; 500 mm to
view the low-magnification pattern, sometimes called
(not surprisingly) the &lsquo;whole pattern&rsquo; (WP) that contains
electrons scattered out to high angles. Figure 20.4 shows
three CBED patterns obtained over a range of L and
you can see that if we start at a highLwe can only see the
000 disk (Figure 20.4A), then we see the array of ZOLZ
disks that is equivalent to an SADP (Figure 20.4B) but
at the smallest L the HOLZ diffraction effects that we
just mentioned become visible as a ring of intensity at
high angles (Figure 20.4C). So it&rsquo;s often necessary to
record your CBED patterns over a range of L (in addi-
tion to a range of a).

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In dedicated STEMs that don&rsquo;t have post-specimen
lenses, the CBED pattern is projected onto the BF
and/or ADF detector at a fixed magnification.
</p>
<p>20.3.C Choice of Beam Size
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already mentioned that you should start with a
reasonably large beam with enough current to give a
good intense pattern on the screen. Of course, a large
beam size doesn&rsquo;t help if the crystal you&rsquo;re trying to
analyze is small. The volume sampled by the beam defines
the spatial resolution and so it is important to control the
beam diameter. For the thinnest specimens, spatial resolu-
tion is close to the beam size but, in thicker specimens,
elastic scattering will spread the beam and degrade the
resolution in a manner similar to XEDS (see Chapter
36). Using the thinnest specimens and an FEG, CBED
patterns can be obtained from extraordinarily small
regions; we&rsquo;ll see in Section 21.8.B that sub-nanometer
diffraction is possible. However, there is a drawback to
using the thinnest specimens because they don&rsquo;t exhibit
dynamical-diffraction effects which, as you&rsquo;ll soon see, are
really useful.
</p>
<p>20.3.D Effect of Specimen Thickness
</p>
<p>If your specimen is very thin youmay have kinematical-
diffraction conditions. Then the diffraction disks have a
uniform intensity and are devoid of contrast, as shown
in the ZAP in Figure 20.5A.Moving to a thicker area of
the specimen in the same orientation transforms the
</p>
<p>pattern from an array of kinematically bland disks to
a display of striking dynamical contrast (Figure 20.5B),
which we&rsquo;ll discuss in great detail. So to get themost out
of a CBED pattern, your specimen should be thicker
than one extinction distance (see Chapter 16). As we&rsquo;ve
now mentioned many times, this requirement differs
from that of almost all other TEM techniques, such as
HRTEM, XEDS and EELS where the best information
is obtained from the thinnest foils. So if your specimens
are too thick for anything else, you can almost always
get something useful out of them with CBED! As we&rsquo;ll
discuss in Section 20.5, you can always energy-filter
your CBED patterns from thick specimens and reduce
the diffuse-scattering background to enhance the useful
dynamical contrast.
</p>
<p>20.4 FOCUSED AND DEFOCUSED CBED
PATTERNS
</p>
<p>There are times when you need to focus the CBED
pattern and times when you have to defocus it. If you
think about it, a focused CBED pattern will always
come from the smallest possible region of your speci-
men and if you don&rsquo;t focus your patterns you will miss
a lot of the fine detail! However, if the beam is defo-
cused then what happens is that some image informa-
tion appears in the CBED pattern (in an equivalent
way to creating multiple DF images, which we used
to calibrate the SADP rotation back in Section 9.6).
Thus, in defocused CBED techniques we sample both
direct and reciprocal space. In addition, slightly defo-
cusing the objective lens increases the contrast in the
patterns. Both of these advantages turn out to be par-
ticularly useful for direct analysis of crystal defects
such as dislocations and grain boundaries using large-
angle CBED (LACBED).
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.4.A Focusing a CBED Pattern
</p>
<p>Your TEM image is focused if your specimen is at the
eucentric height and you can adjust the C2 lens to form
the smallest spot on the TEM screen before switching to
diffraction mode. To focus the CBED pattern
</p>
<p>&amp; Select K-M conditions (choice of C2 aperture) and
choose a value of L so you can clearly see the 000
disk.
</p>
<p>&amp; Deliberately underfocus (weaken) the objective lens
until a BF image is visible in the disk. This is because
the beam is now spread at the plane of the specimen;
see Figure 20.6A and the equivalent ray diagram
back in Figure 6.5C.
</p>
<p>&amp; Strengthen the objective lens. As the beam crossover
moves toward the specimen plane the image expands
to higher magnifications until it goes through an
inversion point at exact focus (see Figure 20.6B,
which is equivalent to Figure 6.5B).
</p>
<p>&amp; Overfocus and again you can see a BF image in the
000 disk, inverted with respect to the underfocused
image (Figure 20.6C). As you can see in Figure 20.6B
there is non-spatial (i.e., diffraction-contrast) infor-
mation in the 000 disk when you are at focus. (As
we&rsquo;ll see in the next section, there are in fact several
CBED techniques which deliberately use either an
under- or overfocused beam).
</p>
<p>If you leave the objective-lens current fixed and
focus the beam on the specimen by adjusting C2
you&rsquo;ll see a similar effect to that shown in Figure
20.6, because the two lenses are coupled in a c/o
system. If you use the second (non-eucentric) tilt
axis or move to another region of the specimen,
you will probably have to refocus the pattern with
the z control, unless you have a stage that is fully
computer controlled.
</p>
<p>The CBED pattern also has to be correctly focused in
the BFP and you can do this in the conventional manner
using the intermediate-lens fine focus to sharpen the image
of the C2 aperture. As you&rsquo;ll see, you can also defocus the
pattern by moving the specimen above or below the
eucentric plane and this is just fine, unless you need to
tilt the specimen to set up specific diffraction conditions,
in which case the loss of eucentricity can make tilting
tedious because the image will shift as you tilt.
</p>
<p>20.4.B Large-Angle (Defocused) CBED Patterns
</p>
<p>The reason we want to defocus the objective lens is that in
some cases, aswithTEMimages, the contrast isminimized

<p>OBJECTIVE LENS CURRENT
Know the value of the objective-lens current
that focuses the beam at the eucentric plane in
your TEM. If your CBED pattern is focused
at a different value, then adjust the lens current
and refocus with the z control to maintain
eucentricity.

<p>at exact focus. This is clear if you go back and look at
the focusedKossel pattern inFigure 20.3F.At exact focus,
the defect and excess Kikuchi lines overlap and reduce the
overall contrast as shown in Figure 20.7A (although at the
edge of the pattern, (i.e., where the electrons are traveling
far off axis.) spherical aberration improves the contrast; a
rare advantage for this otherwise-limiting lens defect).
However, if you defocus the objective lens (either over or
under) then the contrast in that same Kossel pattern is
increased remarkably, as shown in Figure 20.7B. This

<p>20 .4 FOCUSED AND DEFOCUSED CBED PATTERNS ............................................................................................................................ 331</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>novel approach was pioneered by Tanaka and co-workers
in Japan (see the references). There are several forms of
defocused CBED patterns and we&rsquo;ll summarize three here
and show you some applications of the techniques in the
companion text.
</p>
<p>The first and most common defocus technique is
large-angle CBED or LACBED (Tanaka et al. 1980).
These patterns are extraordinarily useful, as a perusal
of Morniroli&rsquo;s book will confirm, and they are invalu-
able in analyzing line and planar crystal defects such as
dislocations and interfaces (e.g., Spence and Zuo).
There are a couple of ways that you can form
LACBED patterns but they are based on Kossel pat-
terns which, as we&rsquo;ve noted, display the largest area
of reciprocal space because they use the largest possible
C2 aperture. Now if you want to defocus the pattern, as
we just described in Figure 20.6, it&rsquo;s simple enough:
you can either change the height of your specimen
by adjusting the z control on the stage or you can
defocus the C2 lens so that the beam does not form a
crossover in the plane of the specimen as shown
schematically in Figure 20.8A. This is a beautiful but
initially daunting diagram, characteristic of many by
Morniroli, but well worth taking the time to
understand.
</p>
<p>Start by looking at the cone of incident electrons in
which two planes (ABE and CDE) are indicated where
the electrons satisfy the Bragg condition for �hkl and
these planes are bisected by the trace of the hkl plane
itself. The beam is focused on the object plane of the
objective lens and the specimen is raised a distance Dh
out of that plane so it is illuminated by a disk of inten-
sity. This has the effect of separating out the � ghkl
diffracted electrons. The electrons incident along the
lines AE-BE and CE-DE are Bragg diffracted and form
�ghkl diffraction spots at K and L, respectively, in the
object plane, and the direct-beam electrons form the 000
spot at E. All the electrons diverge through the spots
and are re-focused by the objective lens to form spots in
the image plane (K0, L0, and E0), respectively, and Figure
20.8B shows such a spot pattern. In the BFP there is a
LACBED pattern consisting of a disk of intensity
crossed by deficient lines (like Kikuchi lines but arising
from elastic scattering) which are called Bragg lines (see
Section 20.7 below). These deficient lines (AF-BF and
CF-DF) correspond to the lines in the specimen along
which strong diffraction occurred from the �hkl dif-
fracting planes as shown in Figure 20.8C and arise
from the superpositioning of the �h�k�l excess lines on the
hkl deficiency line (AF-BF) and vice versa (CF-DF). As
you can see, there are lines frommany diffracting planes
in this figure while, for simplicity, Figure 20.8A only
includes the ray paths for two strongly diffracting planes
exactly at s = 0.
</p>
<p>Figure 20.8A shows that the key to getting the
best LACBED patterns is careful use of the SAD
</p>
<p>aperture. If you insert an SAD diaphragm into the
image plane and permit only the direct beam to go
through the aperture, the (BF) LACBED pattern
you see on the screen is remarkably enhanced, as
shown in Figure 20.8D (compare this with Figure
20.8C which is a LACBED pattern without the SAD
aperture inserted). A DF LACBED pattern can be
acquired simply by selecting one of the ghkl reflec-
tions in the image plane with the SAD aperture and
such a pattern consists of just a single �hkl excess
line of intensity. It is possible to improve the con-
trast in the LACBED pattern by choosing a smaller
SAD aperture to cut out some of the inelastic,
higher-angle scattering. If you look carefully at Fig-
ure 20.8D, you see that, as in all LACBED patterns,
there is some real-space information about the speci-
men but the reciprocal-space information clearly
dominates. Figure 20.9 shows a montage of BF
and multiple DF LACBED patterns from Si in the
[111] orientation. The beauty of such a pattern is
only enhanced by the fact that the symmetry infor-
mation can be used to determine the point group of
the crystal directly; more about that in the compan-
ion text.
</p>
<p>The second technique is called convergent-beam
imaging or CBIM, which is a little younger than
LACBED (Humphreys et al.). CBIM saw relatively
little use because all it really did was give you an
image of the area of your specimen from which you
were obtaining the CBED pattern. If you include an
objective aperture, a very small spot size and an
energy filter the quality of the CBIM patterns is
close to that of LACBED patterns although invari-
ably CBIM emphasizes real-space over reciprocal-
space information.
</p>
<p>The last defocus technique in this acronym soup is
parallel recording of dark-field images (PARODI) as a
function of specimen thickness. The intensity variation
in the multiple DF images visible in a systematic row of
diffraction disks of a defocused CBED pattern (Wu et
al.) can be recorded in a single exposure and, if you
understand a lot of physics, you can use this approach
to determine various properties of your crystalline speci-
mens such as structure factors and valence-electron
distributions.
</p>
<p>There are several other mechanisms for obtaining
LACBED patterns summarized by Morniroli, such as
eucentric LACBED, specimen rocking, BF and DF
LACBED and montages of CBED patterns, the last of
which is illustrated in Figure 20.9.
</p>
<p>20.4.C Final Adjustment
</p>
<p>Sometimes, in either defocused or focused CBED pat-
terns, it is quite difficult to make the ZAP exactly sym-
metrical as in Figure 20.2B. It often seems as if your last

<p>minor tilt or traverse of the specimen is not precise
enough, or mechanical backlash occurs. If this is the
case, use the beam tilts or deflectors to make your final
adjustments to obtain a symmetrical pattern. In Sec-
tion 18.2, we used the same method to excite high-
order reflections in SAD. You can also move the C2
aperture and center it on the zone axis, but this
misaligns the illumination system so it should be
the last resort.
</p>
<p>As with SAD, a range of exposure times for all
CBED patterns will give you the most information.
</p>
<p>We can now summarize the experimental steps to
obtain a CBED pattern
</p>
<p>&amp; Focus the beam to a crossover on your specimen
at the eucentric plane and go to diffraction mode
in TEM (or stop the beam from scanning in
STEM).
</p>
<p>&amp; Decrease L to see the full pattern including HOLZ
scattering and tilt to the desired orientation.
</p>
<p>&amp; Adjust the convergence angle with the C2 aperture.
&amp; Increase the beam size if necessary with the C1 lens
to make the pattern brighter.
</p>
<p>&amp; Decrease the beam size and/or go to a thinner por-
tion of the specimen to select a smaller region (which
generally increases the quality of the pattern).
</p>
<p>&amp; Increase L to examine the 000 disk and focus the
pattern.
</p>
<p>&amp; Defocus the pattern with the objective lens or raise/
lower the specimen from the eucentric plane if you
want to do LACBED, PARODI, CBIM or some
form of defocused CBED.
</p>
<p>20.5 ENERGY FILTERING
</p>
<p>Every kind of DP contains electrons that have lost
energy in going through the specimen. As we&rsquo;ve seen
already, these inelastically scattered electrons can be
very useful if they cause Kikuchi lines, but if your
specimen is thick enough, then the diffuse, inelastic
scattering can raise the background intensity to levels
that mask the useful contrast in the pattern. This is
particularly the case in CBED patterns because, as
we noted back in Section 20.2 and Figure 20.5,
CBED is one of the few TEM techniques wherein
more useful information is present in patterns from
thicker specimens because they give rise to much
more interesting dynamical contrast within the CBED
disks.
</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a balance here: we want thicker specimens
to enhance dynamical effects but if the specimen is too
thick the diffuse, inelastic scattering hides the useful
contrast. If this is the case we can, in fact, have our
cake and eat it at the same time. All we have to do is
remove the diffuse-scattered electrons from the pattern
using an energy filter.
</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ll talk a lot more about energy filtering
when we discuss EELS in the last four chapters of
Part 4 and the seminal text on filtering is edited by
Reimer. Filtering can be achieved either with an in-
column or post-column filter. If we remove inelastically
scattered electrons, the CBED pattern contains elec-
trons that have lost no energy. Thus, in effect we have
removed any specimen-induced chromatic-aberration
effects from the pattern, and all the contrast pheno-
mena in the pattern appear much sharper because all
the electrons are focused in the (same) BFP (or image
plane if it is a LACBED pattern). All this text pales
in comparison with the example shown in Figure
20.10. This improvement is so dramatic that it really
never makes sense to do anything other than filter
your CBED patterns if you have the necessary
instrumentation.

If you can energy-filter your CBED patterns, you
should always do so.

<p>20.6 ZERO-ORDER AND HIGH-ORDER
LAUE-ZONE DIFFRACTION
</p>
<p>20.6.A ZOLZ Patterns
</p>
<p>If you increase L above �800 mm you will magnify the
pattern on the screen and only see the first few diffrac-
tion maxima, as shown in Figure 20.4A. Assuming the
</p>
<p>C2 aperture is small enough, the CBED pattern consists
of disks, similar to the array of spots in an SADP, i.e.,
discrete diffraction maxima surrounding the central 000
disk. Remember that such a pattern is termed a ZOLZ
pattern (see Section 18.4) since the permitted hkl diffrac-
tion maxima must all satisfy the Weiss zone law hU +
kV + lW = 0, where UVW is the beam direction.
Remember also that all the hkl maxima in the DP
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>correspond to points in the reciprocal-lattice plane con-
taining the origin, 000, of the reciprocal lattice, and this
plane is also called the ZOLZ. So in fact SADPs are
usually ZOLZ patterns, although we don&rsquo;t always
describe them as such. From ZOLZ patterns, we can
obtain the usual interplanar spacings and angles, the hkl
maxima can be indexed and UVW identified, in exactly
the same manner as we described in Section 18.4 for an
</p>
<p>SADP. The two options are the method of ratios or
using a calibration standard to determine the camera
length.
</p>
<p>Because of the finite size of the diffraction disks, you
must take care to select equivalent points in each disk
when measuring the hkl spot spacings. If a is too large
(Kossel conditions) you might not see individual max-
ima and you should then select a smaller C2 aperture
(K-M conditions).
</p>
<p>20.6.B HOLZ Patterns
</p>
<p>The central portion of the CBEDpattern is bright due to
the relatively intense low-angle scattering (go back and
check Figure 3.5). At higher angles, the ZOLZ intensity
drops because the atomic-scattering amplitude, f(y),
decreases and the Ewald sphere no longer intercepts
the relrods from the ZOLZ. However, the intensity
increases again when the Ewald sphere intercepts the
relrods from the HOLZ reciprocal-lattice points and a
circle or ring of diffracted intensity is observed around
the ZOLZ pattern as in Figures 20.3D&ndash;F and 20.4C.
(You should recall that a circle can be defined geomet-
rically as the interception of a sphere and a plane).
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve chosen a small enough aperture for K-M
conditions you&rsquo;ll see a ring of discrete HOLZ spots as in
Figure 20.3D while a large C2 aperture gives a HOLZ
ring of intersecting lines as in Figure 20.3F. The HOLZ
intensity arises from relatively weak high-angle diffrac-
tion from crystal planes that are not parallel to the
beam. Low temperatures increase the HOLZ scattering
and also minimize the thermal-diffuse (phonon) scatter-
ing that, in some materials with a large Debye-Waller
factor, masks the weak HOLZ intensity. So this is why
you&rsquo;ll find a liquid-N2 cooling holder very useful at
times. You can&rsquo;t reduce the diffuse scattering via an
energy filter because phonon scattering has a very
small energy loss (�1 eV) and most of these electrons
still contribute to the filtered pattern.
</p>
<p>Consider the intersection of the Ewald sphere with the
reciprocal lattice. The plane of HOLZ reciprocal-lattice
points/relrods intercepts the sphere (unlike the zero layer
which is tangential to the Ewald sphere). The first ring is
called the FOLZ because the possible hkl reflections
satisfy the relationship hU + kV + lW = 1, and so on.
Where the Ewald sphere intersects the HOLZ relrods,
diffracted intensity is expected, taking into account the
usual structure-factor effects (see the next section).

<p>many TEM lab Christmas cards.
</p>
<p>SMALL L, LARGE ANGLE
Remember that the radial distance from 000 in a DP
is related to the angle of scattering; use a smaller L to
see higher-angle scattering.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Because the beam converges on the specimen over an
angular range 2a, the Ewald sphere is effectively rotated
2a about the origin, and thus a range of angles along
each HOLZ relrod is sampled, as shown in Figure
20.11A. This range of angles manifests itself as the
CBED disk reflecting the effective angular broadening
of the relrod, as shown in Figure 20.11B. Different
interception points on the relrod correspond to different
points in the disk as shown in Figure 20.11C. Figure
20.11D shows a K-M CBED pattern containing the
expected distribution of diffraction maxima from the
Ewald-sphere construction in Figure 20.11A.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make use of this 3D information in the next chap-
ter and in the companion text.
</p>
<p>To observe HOLZ rings in addition to the ZOLZ
pattern, choose a very small L (&lt; 500 mm) so that you
can see the full angular range of the BFP permitted by
the imaging system (��108). As shown schematically in
</p>
<p>Figure 20.11A, the Ewald sphere only intercepts relrods
in HOLZs many orders of diffraction maxima away
from the direct beam. Because of the large scattering
angle, the intensity in the HOLZ spots is relatively low
and the exposure time to reveal HOLZ maxima is
usually long enough to ensure that the ZOLZ is over-
exposed on the negative (go back and see Figure 20.3).
You might be lucky with your thin area; sometimes you
can produce reasonable ZOLZ and HOLZ intensity on
the same exposure as in Figure 20.11D. But generally, if
you&rsquo;re still stuck with recording your patterns on film
you will probably have to record at least two DPs: a
relatively short exposure for the ZOLZ pattern contain-
ing only 2D crystallographic information and a longer
exposure for the weak HOLZ reflections containing the
3D information. As we&rsquo;ve already said, a range of expo-
sures is useful for all DPs.
</p>
<p>There are some alternatives
</p>
<p>&amp; A CCD camera will give a greater dynamical range
making it easier to record a good pattern showing
detail at both low and high scattering angles.
</p>
<p>&amp; You can use image-processing techniques on your
computer to combine differently exposed patterns
(see Chapter 31).

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The HOLZ ring radius is defined by the interception
of the Ewald sphere with the allowed HOLZ relrods in
the reciprocal lattice and so depends on the interplanar
spacing in the crystal, the electron wavelength (i.e., the
kV), L and any off-axis lens distortion. Depending on
</p>
<p>the crystallography of the specimen, the HOLZ rings
may have very large diameters making them difficult to
observe experimentally even at very small L. Under
these circumstances, you should tilt to a low-symmetry
zone axis (e.g., &lt;114&gt;) since this gives you a better
chance of observing the FOLZ than a high-symmetry
zone axis such as &lt;001&gt;. (If the reason for this is not
clear, then look at Figure 20.12.) Cooling your speci-
men will reduce thermal-diffuse scattering that can
mask HOLZ effects. If you still can&rsquo;t see a HOLZ
ring, then the last thing you can try is increasing l by
lowering the kV. If all this fails, you need to pick
another specimen!
</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will show you how to index
HOLZ patterns and howHOLZ ring measurements can
be used to deduce the lattice-repeat vector of the crystal
parallel to the beam direction. You&rsquo;ll see that you can
then determine the unit cell, the crystal system and also
the type of lattice centering.

PATTERNS

<p>in part because the convergent beam samples a much
smaller region of the specimen than that selected by the
SAD aperture. So, in the volume of specimen contribut-
ing to the CBED pattern, there is usually little or no
strain, either elastic (due to specimen bending) or plastic
(due to lattice defects). As a result, CBED Kikuchi lines
will in general be sharper than SAD lines. This effect is
shown in Figure 20.13A which is a conventional SADP
containing very diffuse Kikuchi lines. This pattern was
obtained from a large region of heavily deformed copper.
By comparison, Figure 20.13B shows a CBED pattern
from a much smaller region of the same specimen show-
ing several pairs of well-definedKikuchi lines. So you can
use Kikuchi lines in CBED patterns to attack problems
which are beyond the capability of SAD, for example, to
determine accurate misorientation relationships between
small grains in deformed materials (see Heilman et al.).
However, if you put the probe right on a defect which has
significant strain associated with it then even the CBED
pattern may be blurred. On the positive side, this effect is
used in LACBED patterns to characterize the crystal-
lography of defects (e.g., the Burgers vectors) and this is
explained in detail in the companion text. So, unless you
want to study defects, always check the TEM image and
tilt around to make sure that the area is clear of defects
before getting your CBED patterns.
</p>
<p>If the CBED pattern is not a ZAP, as in Figure
20.13B, the Kikuchi lines appear as pairs of excess
(bright) and deficient (dark) lines, as in SADPs. But
when you obtain a ZAP, the ZOLZKikuchi lines appear
as bright bands. These bands increase in intensity and
definition as you increase the convergence angle, as
shown back in Figure 20.3D&ndash;F. A similar effect is seen
in channeling patterns in the SEM that are generated by
rocking a parallel beam around the optic axis. If you need
to understand the difference between Kikuchi lines in
SADPs and Kikuchi bands in CBED patterns, Reimer
gives a clear discourse in his 1997 text.
</p>
<p>The generation of Kikuchi lines in a CBED pattern is
marginally more complex than in an SADP. Remember
how Kikuchi lines arise in a specimen illuminated by a
parallel beam (see Chapter 19) and how a divergent beam
of scattered electrons samples the various crystal planes
(see Figure 20.14A). In Figure 20.14B you can see what
happens when a convergent beam is used. In this case the
incident rather than the scattered electrons span an angu-
lar range and therefore, just as in Kikuchi-line genera-
tion, some electrons in the beam will probably be at the
exact Bragg angle to a ZOLZplane (this is identical to the
argument we used to explain the Kikuchi lines in
LACBED patterns back in Figure 20.8A). Thus, there
will be an elastic-scattering contribution to the Kikuchi
lines where they cross the ZOLZ disks in CBEDpatterns.
If you choose Kossel conditions (i.e., 2a &gt; 2yB) as in
Figure 20.3F, there will always be electrons in the beam
with the correct trajectory for exact Bragg diffraction
from the planes in the UVW zone and so there will
invariably be an elastic contribution to the Kikuchi lines.
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, we should only use the term &lsquo;Kiku-
chi lines&rsquo; when inelastic scattering alone is responsible
for their formation (i.e., the lines between any hkl disks).
However, the term is used rather loosely in the literature
to describe the ZOLZ intensity bands, despite the elastic
contribution to the scattered intensity. Morniroli has
proposed that this uncertainty be resolved by using the
term &lsquo;Bragg lines&rsquo; for the deficiency lines in CBED and
LACBED patterns; this terminology is gaining wider
acceptance.
</p>
<p>20.8 HOLZ LINES
</p>
<p>20.8.A The Relationship Between HOLZ Lines
and Kikuchi Lines
</p>
<p>As we just noted, Kikuchi lines can also arise from
inelastic scattering by the HOLZ planes and HOLZ
Kikuchi lines exist in many CBED patterns. You can
see the array of deficient HOLZ Kikuchi lines between
the ZOLZmaxima in Figure 20.2B. These HOLZKiku-
chi lines are, in principle, more useful than ZOLZKiku-
chi lines because they come from planes with much
larger Bragg angles (and g vectors) so they are even
more sensitive to changes in lattice parameter than the
ZOLZ lines. Since

</p>

(20:1)
</p>
<p>then for smaller d values, the value of |Dg| is much larger
at the same Dd. We take advantage of this fact, not by
using HOLZ Kikuchi lines specifically, but by seeking
out a closely related phenomenon called HOLZ lines.
HOLZ lines are simply the elastic part of the HOLZ
Kikuchi lines, that is, they are the segments of the lines

<p>which appear within the diffraction maxima. By ana-
logy with the production of Kikuchi lines and, as
already shown in Figure 20.8A for LACBED patterns
(although both these situations referred to ZOLZ dif-
fraction), the HOLZ lines arise when electrons within
the cone of the incident probe are at the correct Bragg
angle for diffraction by a HOLZ plane. Therefore,
these electrons are diffracted out to very high angles
compared with ZOLZ diffraction. The result of this
scattering is a bright line through the HOLZ disk and
a dark line across the 000 disk. Not surprisingly, given
what you&rsquo;ve learned in the preceding nine chapters, the
theory for the origin of HOLZ lines is much more

<p>An example of HOLZ lines is shown schematically in
Figure 20.15, which compares with the experimental pat-
tern in Figure 20.32B. Because these HOLZ lines contain
3D information they show the true, fcc, 3D, threefold
{111} symmetry, while the ZOLZKikuchi lines and spots
show sixfold, 2D, {111} symmetry. We will make use of
</p>
<p>these differences when we discuss indexing such patterns
and crystal-symmetry determination in Chapter 21 and
in the companion text.

<p>PAIRS OF HOLZ LINES
HOLZ lines come in pairs, likeKikuchi lines, with the
bright (excess) lines within the HOLZ hkl maxima
and the dark (deficient) lines within the 000 disk.

<p>HOLZplanes are shown in the regions between the ZOLZ diffraction disks
</p>

</p>
<p>acteristic of looking down the &lt;111&gt; direction in a 3D crystal.

<p>20.8.B Acquiring HOLZ Lines
</p>
<p>Steeds (1981) described the practical problems of
recording HOLZ lines in some detail. Nothing much
has changed in the intervening decades and the main
points you have to consider are
</p>
<p>&amp; The lines are often only visible &lsquo;on the negatives&rsquo; and
not on the screen, so you should record all the DPs,
not just ones on which you can see the lines. This
poor visibility is less of a problem with a CCD
because you can easily enhance the gain.
</p>
<p>&amp; You may have to make small changes in the operat-
ing voltage or the orientation in order to view the
HOLZ rings, especially if the crystal has a small
lattice-repeat spacing parallel to the beam and the
angular view of the BFP is poor.
</p>
<p>&amp; Strains in the specimen from bending and thermal stress-
es smear out the HOLZ-line intensity. Choosing the
smallest region (i.e., the smallest beam) may help this
problemandwill alsominimize local thickness variations.
</p>
<p>&amp; Planar or point disorder as well as thermal (Debye-
Waller) effects can reduce high-angle scattering. In
practice, this means that cooling the specimen and
reducing the kV can help to increase HOLZ-line vis-
ibility by reducing contamination and beam heating.
</p>
<p>&amp; Minor adjustments in HOLZ-line positions can help
to distinguish HOLZ lines that overlap. To do this
you need to change the kV by a small amount.
</p>
<p>The experimental procedure for observing HOLZ lines
is quite straightforward but, since the lines themselves
can be rather elusive, as we suggested at the start of the
chapter, you should practice with a specimen such as Si
or stainless steel in which the lines are almost always
visible. The best way to search for the lines is
</p>
<p>&amp; Select the largest C2 aperture and go to the smallest
L (� 3&ndash;500mm) at which you can see the full angular
view of the BFP.
</p>
<p>&amp; Examine the Kossel/LACBED pattern (make 2a
large) which should reveal Kikuchi bands intersect-
ing at many poles, spanning a good fraction of the
stereographic triangle as shown in Figure 20.16A.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you tilt to such a pole, as shown in Figure 20.16B,
you should see the ring of HOLZ intensity.
</p>
<p>&amp; Tilt to a suitable zone axis for optimizing HOLZ
effects. Remember, the best orientation for seeing
the HOLZ lines in the 000 disk is not a low-index,
high-symmetry pole such as &lt;100&gt; or &lt;111&gt; , but
a higher-index, lower-symmetry one such as&lt;114&gt;.
</p>
<p>&amp; To see the deficient lines, increase L to look in detail at
the 000 region of the pattern, and if necessary, put in a

<p>tilted to a high-symmetry &lt;111&gt; ZAP and a smaller C2 aperture is
</p>
<p>inserted, a ring of excess HOLZ lines appears. In (C) taken at high L, the
</p>
<p>deficient HOLZ lines are visible in the central 000 disk of the lower
</p>
<p>symmetry &lt;114&gt; pattern.

<p>CONTROLLING kV
Continuous kV control is an essential accessory to
your TEM for serious CBED work.

<p>smaller C2 aperture, center it and look for the fine dark
lines crossing the bright disk as in Figure 20.16C.
Usually, you&rsquo;ll just need this deficient-line distribution.
</p>
<p>You have to use a range of L (from �300 to
1500 mm) to obtain all this information and this is
easy in any post-1980 TEM. DSTEMs with sufficient
post-specimen lenses are as versatile. Energy filtering
improves everything that we&rsquo;ve just described.
</p>
<p>20.9 HOLLOW-CONE/PRECESSION CBED
</p>
<p>As we described in Chapter 18, for SAD, we can acquire
CBED patterns by rotating the incoming convergent
beam about the optic axis in a hollow cone. Just as
with SAD, hollow-cone CBED supplements the infor-
mation we get in a stationary-beam pattern (i.e., all the
patterns we&rsquo;ve discussed so far). Remember, hollow-
cone operation deflects the incident beam and rotates
the pattern in the BFP while precession de-scans the
beam so that the actual pattern is stationary. A good
review of hollow-cone CBED and its relationship to
other CBED methods is given in Tanaka&rsquo;s 1986 paper.
Hollow-cone patterns do not show specific diffraction
spots like CBED patterns since the rotating disk inten-
sity is averaged out and the only stationary features are
diffraction events at specific angles such as HOLZ lines.
We can take advantage of this because if, for example,
the cone angle is set to that of the FOLZ ring then the
pattern consists predominantly of an array of excess
HOLZ lines as shown in Figure 20.17. The ZOLZ
disks, which would normally be so bright that they
</p>
<p>might mask the excess lines, are removed because the
rotation of the incident beam averages out the intensity.
</p>
<p>Precession of CBED patterns has all the advantages
of precession of SADPs as discussed in Section 18.8. A
comparison of a precessionDP and a standard DP under
K-M conditions is shown in Figure 20.18. Precession
extends the FOLZ ring into an annulus of width of �10
mrad. This dynamical background averaging can
improve intensity measurements from DPs by consider-
ably simplifying the problem of background subtraction.

clearly defined. Dynamical scattering still contributes to the pattern so a
</p>
<p>thinner specimen would be better.

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
In this chapter we&rsquo;ve covered how to obtain different CBED patterns experimentally.
Particular points and terms that you should know are
</p>
<p>&amp; If you vary the specimen thickness, a, L, and the focus you can obtain CBED and
LACBED patterns showing many different features. As with SAD, two-beam and
zone-axis conditions are the standard operating conditions to get the most useful
information.
</p>
<p>&amp; You&rsquo;ll probably have to record patterns at different values of a and L, each with different
exposure times.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you have an EELS then always filter your patterns.
&amp; Even if you can filter the patterns, we strongly recommend using a double-tilt holder,
cooled to LN2 temperature.
</p>
<p>&amp; You must be able to change the kV by very small steps, if you are studying HOLZ lines.
&amp; You can precess your CBED patterns or form them with hollow cones of incident
electrons.
</p>
<p>&amp; Learn the meaning of such terms as ZAP, ZOLZ, FOLZ, HOLZ, K-M, and Kossel
patterns.
</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we&rsquo;ll show you how to use this contrast information to get the
maximum amount of crystallographic information from your specimen.

<p>Using Convergent-Beam Techniques
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>In the preceding chapter, we described how to obtain a variety of CBED patterns under
various experimental conditions. In this chapter you will find out why these patterns are so
useful: they contain a wealth of quantitative data, much of which you can&rsquo;t obtain by any
other technique and many of which augment standard X-ray crystallographic methods (but
always at higher spatial resolution). The established techniques largely depend on simple
observation of the patterns whereas newer techniques involve quantitative simulations of
the patterns.
</p>
<p>CBED gives quantitative data on
</p>
<p>&amp; Specimen thickness
&amp; Lots of crystallographic data such as the unit cell and associated lattice parameters, the
Bravais lattice, crystal system, and full 3D crystal symmetry (point group and space
group)
</p>
<p>&amp; Precise lattice-strain measurement (invaluable for semiconductors and other multilayer
nanostructures)
</p>
<p>&amp; Enantiomorphism and polarity
&amp; Valence-electron distribution, structure factors, and chemical bonding
&amp; Characterization of line and planar defects
</p>
<p>Between this chapter and in the companion text, we&rsquo;ll cover most of these applications of
CBED. First, we&rsquo;ll show how to index the patterns and the HOLZ lines when they occur
within those patterns. We&rsquo;ll also show you how to measure the specimen thickness, which is
very useful in many aspects of TEM, particularly the spectrometry that we describe in Part
4. Next, we&rsquo;ll introduce the steps for a complete symmetry analysis of your specimen, which
is fully described in the companion text. Then, we&rsquo;ll introduce you to methods of determin-
ing extremely small changes in lattice parameter which can be used to measure lattice strain
and, indirectly, composition. Like any other TEM technique, we can simulate the contrast
in CBED patterns in extraordinary detail and we&rsquo;ll tell you a little about how this is done.
Other CBED methods are also available as well as different micro- and nanodiffraction
methods, all of which offer better spatial resolution than SAD and we&rsquo;ll briefly summarize
these at the end of the chapter.
</p>
<p>We should warn you at this stage that some of the analyses we introduce here require a
very good understanding of crystallography. Both the learning and the doing can be time-
consuming processes, depending on your background. If you&rsquo;re a metallurgist, in a pre-
dominantly cubic world, then life is relatively easy, but in the rest of materials science, in
functional materials, and in much of the nano-world, more complex crystal structures are
common. In studying these materials, CBED is absolutely invaluable, but also really
challenging. We suggest that you skim the chapter and see how many of the topics you
can already relate to, given your current knowledge of crystallography and crystal defects. If
you draw a blank, then it&rsquo;s time to read some of the basic texts listed in Chapter 18 before
moving ahead.

<p>21.1 INDEXING CBED PATTERNS
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen in the preceding chapter that, in addition to
improved spatial resolution, CBED patterns often con-
tain a wealth of new and sometimes spectacular contrast
information not available in SADPs. However, before
you do anything quantitative, you have to index the
patterns. Indexing CBEDZOLZ patterns is no different
to indexing SADPs, which we&rsquo;ve already described back
in Chapter 18. With indexed CBED patterns you can do
exactly the same kind of orientation determination as
with SADPs, but on a much smaller dimensional scale,
suitable for crystallographic analysis of nanostructures,
as shown in Figure 21.1, which also shows the power of
CBED-pattern simulation.
</p>
<p>What you need to learn now is how to index HOLZ
spots, disks, and lines and understanding these requires a
little extra thought since such diffraction effects come from
lattice planes that, unlike those contributing to SADPs, are
not parallel to the electron beam and, thus, are the key to
obtaining 3D information about your specimen.
</p>
<p>21.1.A Indexing ZOLZ and HOLZ Patterns
</p>
<p>Remember that in a ZAP the HOLZ reflections appear
as a ring of spots (or a ring of intensity) (see Figures
20.3, 20.4, 20.11, and many others). If you&rsquo;re not at a
zone-axis orientation, the HOLZ spots might appear as
an arc or somewhat randomly distributed, but always
farther away from the direct beam than the ZOLZ
</p>
<p>reflections. As with SAD, it&rsquo;s easiest to index ZAPs, so
tilt around under Kossel conditions until you find a
ZAP where Kikuchi bands intersect, then select a C2
aperture size to form diffraction disks (K-M conditions)
in the HOLZ ring (like Figures 20.11D and 20.16B),
which you can index as follows
</p>
<p>&amp; Index the ZOLZ for which hU+ kV+ lW= 0 (see
Section 18.4).
</p>
<p>&amp; Consult a stereographic projection to identify the poles
of the principal planes constituting the FOLZ (hU +
kV+ lW=1) and SOLZ (hU+ kV+ lW=2), etc.
</p>
<p>&amp; Alternatively, you can just solve the Weiss zone law
(see Section 18.4) for the appropriate UVW.
</p>
<p>&amp; Check to see if the poles on the stereographic projec-
tion constitute allowed reflections.
</p>
<p>&amp; Index the HOLZ maxima.
</p>
<p>If you want to make use of a stereographic projec-
tion, see Chapter 18. Remember that the stereographic
projection just gives you the major, low-index, hkl

</p>
<p>Examples of indexed ZOLZ, FOLZ, and SOLZ pat-
terns are shown in Figure 21.2A&ndash;C for the fcc lattice
under (a) [001], (b) [110], and (c) [111] beam directions;
Figure 21.3A&ndash;C show similar patterns for the bcc lat-
tice. Only the first few orders of diffraction maxima are
shown in these figures but, paradoxically, you&rsquo;ll rarely
find these reflections, and you&rsquo;ll never see them if you&rsquo;re
under zone-axis conditions. This is because the Ewald
sphere intercepts the HOLZ at large scattering angles
(go back and check Figure 20.11) so relatively high
orders of diffraction maxima are present in the
HOLZs. Therefore, the schematic patterns in Figures
21.2 and 21.3 should be extended accordingly to match
up with the experimental patterns. From the schematic
HOLZ patterns in Figures 21.2 and 21.3, you can see
that the symmetry of each &lt;UVW&gt; zone is retained in
each HOLZ pattern, but they are often shifted by a
displacement vector relative to the ZOLZ because there
is no allowed HOLZ reflection on the zone axis (i.e.,
directly above 000 in the ZOLZ). Note that in the HOLZ
patterns we do not index the central spot. This displace-
ment can be calculated for any zone axis using equations
which we&rsquo;ll discuss in a while. So you should generate
similar diagrams for the major zone axes of any speci-
men that you are going to study by CBED. You may
have to generate less symmetrical patterns than those in
Figures 21.2 and 21.3 (e.g., [233] or [114]), since these
give rise to FOLZ rings with smaller radii (Figure 20.12),
in which HOLZ phenomena are easier to see.
</p>
<p>In some circumstances, the first ring of spots
observed is from the second layer of the reciprocal
lattice but it is still called the FOLZ. Well-known exam-
ples, as you can see in Figures 21.2 and 21.3, are the fcc
(110) and bcc (111) patterns. You can&rsquo;t predict the total

CBED pattern.
</p>
<p>21.1.B Indexing HOLZ Lines
</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re recording the pattern containing the defi-
cient HOLZ lines, you must also record another pattern
with a smallL and a small a to show the FOLZ disks. The
first thing youhave todo is index theFOLZ hklmaxima in
the manner we just described. Then observe which max-
ima show the clearest HOLZ excess lines. Each HOLZ-
line pair will be perpendicular to the g vector from 000 to
theFOLZdisk.There shouldbe aparallel deficientHOLZ
line in the 000 disk, and this linemust be assigned the same
indices as the FOLZ disk. If you repeat this exercise
around the FOLZ ring, most of the HOLZ lines should
be indexed, as shown in Figure 21.5. Below the schematic
pattern is a magnified drawing of the 000 disk and you
should be able to see the association of each HOLZ line
with a corresponding FOLZ maximum (Ecob et al.).
</p>
<p>In some cases you may find it difficult to associate a
specific HOLZdeficient line in 000with a specific FOLZ
reflection due to strong excitation of two diffraction
</p>
<p>maxima. Under these circumstances, the two deficient
lines may merge and appear to form a hyperbola. If you
make small changes in the kV, the overlaps may resolve
into two discrete lines. You should also be aware that
faint HOLZ lines in the 000 disk may sometimes arise
from second-order or even third-order Laue zones;
these very high order lines are even more sensitive than
first-order HOLZ lines to changes in kV and lattice
parameter. As with the HOLZ patterns themselves, the
indexing of HOLZ lines also lends itself to computer
assistance. As we just showed in Figure 21.4, such pro-
grams can generate simulated HOLZ line patterns for a
given orientation, lattice parameter, and kV. Matching
of the computer simulation with the experimental pat-
tern then allows direct indexing. This procedure is also

Be aware when you are indexing HOLZ rings that
structure factors can cause every reflection in a FOLZ
to be forbidden. So then we call the SOLZ the FOLZ!

<p>the first step in measuring the lattice parameter of the
specimen and we will discuss this, along with other
applications such as composition and strain measure-
ments later in this chapter. Fournier et al. give a clear
introduction to the step-by-step indexing and you
should read this and then practice indexing some pat-
terns by hand once or twice, just to get the hang of it.
New software continues to become available to refine
the various methods of HOLZ-line indexing (e.g.,
Morawiec).
</p>
<p>21.2 THICKNESS DETERMINATION
</p>
<p>As you read through this book, you will become aware
that a direct and accurate measure of the specimen
thickness is essential for many aspects of TEM and
AEM, such as the correction of X-ray intensities for
absorption within the specimen (Chapter 35), determin-
ing the attainable X-ray spatial resolution (Chapter 36),
and obtaining EELS data with reasonable P/B (Chap-
ters 37 and 38). A most useful application of CBED
patterns is that you can use them to measure the thick-
ness of a crystal.
</p>
<p>When you record a ZAP under conditions where 2aS
&lt; 2yB such as shown back in Figure 20.2B, the 000 disk
usually contains concentric diffuse fringes known as
Kossel-Möllenstedt (K-M) fringes. If you move the
specimen under the beam and it is not too bent then
you will see that the number of these fringes changes. In
fact the number of fringes increases by one every time
the thickness increases by one extinction distance, xg; if
the specimen is &lt; xg in thickness, then you&rsquo;ll see no
fringes and the 000 and hkl disks will be kinematical
and uniformly bright and boring, as shown back in
Figure 20.5A. So these fringes clearly contain thickness
information. In fact, because the foil thickness can be
measured at precisely the point you are doing diffrac-
tion and analysis, and because the method is very amen-
able to computerization, it has become a most popular
use for CBED patterns. The region of the foil you select
should be flat and undistorted (this is relatively easy
when you are using a small focused probe, compared
to a broad beam for SAD) and the beam must be
focused at the plane of the specimen. The method is, of
course, limited to crystalline specimens and it can be a
bit tedious, but it is one of the best and, certainly for
fully crystalline materials, the most accurate method of
thickness determination.
</p>
<p>In practice, to simplify the interpretation, we don&rsquo;t
make thickness measurements under zone-axis condi-
tions. You need to tilt to two-beam conditions with only
one strongly excited hkl reflection. If you do this you
will see that the CBED disks contain parallel rather
than concentric intensity oscillations, as shown in
Figure 21.6.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 23 that these fringes are the
reciprocal-space analog of rocking-curve intensity oscil-
lations that occur across a bend contour in two-beam
BF and DF images. We&rsquo;ll also see in Chapter 23 that
bend contours arise when elastic deformation bends the
diffraction planes and so an incoming parallel beam
&lsquo;sees&rsquo; a range of scattering angles across the bent region
(see Figure 21.7A). In a similar manner, when you use a
convergent beam and the illuminated region is unde-
formed, then the convergent beam provides a range of
incidence angles to the diffracting hkl planes (see Figure
21.7B). The procedure to extract the thickness from the
fringe pattern was first described by Kelly et al., refined
by Allen, and is easily computerized. Energy filtering
also helps to improve the clarity of the K-M lines.

<p>But before you click on yourWeb browser, let&rsquo;s do it
first by hand so you understand the process. If you look
at the hkl disk through a 10� Lupe containing a grati-
cule then it is easy to measure the distances between the
middle of the central bright fringe and each of the dark
fringes with an accuracy of about�0.1 mm. The central
bright fringe is at the exact Bragg condition where s=0.
The fringe spacings correspond to angles Dyi as shown
schematically in Figure 21.8A, and from these spacings
you can obtain a deviation si for the i
</p>
<p>th fringe (where i is
an integer) from the equation
</p>
<p>si &frac14; l
Dyi
</p>
<p>2yBd
2
</p>
<p>(21:1)
</p>
<p>where yB is the Bragg angle for the diffracting hkl plane,
d is the hkl interplanar spacing, and we&rsquo;ll use the magni-
tude of s, ignoring its sign. The angle 2yB in the CBED
pattern is, of course, just the separation of the 000 and
hkl disks. The specimen in Figure 21.6 is pure Al and the
200 reflection is excited. For Al, d200 is 0.2021 nm. If the
extinction distance xg is known, then you can determine
the foil thickness t since

</p>
<p>2
k
</p>

t2
</p>
<p>(21:2)
</p>
<p>where nk is an integer (k is an integer identical to i or
differing from i by a constant integer not related to l). If
you don&rsquo;t know xg, then you have to use a graphical
method, plotting the measurements for several fringes
as follows.
</p>
<p>&amp; Arbitrarily assign the integer n=1 to the first fringe,
which corresponds to an excitation error s1.
</p>
<p>&amp; Then assign n = 2 to the second fringe, s2, etc.
&amp; Plot (si/nk)
</p>
<p>2 versus (1/nk)
2. If the result is a straight
</p>
<p>line, your arbitrary assignment was good. That is,
the relationship between i and k is given by k= i+ j
where j is the largest integer &lt;(t/xg).
</p>
<p>&amp; If your plot is a curve, then repeat the procedure by
re-assigning n = 2 to the first fringe.
</p>
<p>&amp; Continue to iterate until you find a straight line, as
shown in Figure 21.8B.
</p>
<p>You have to do all this because the minimum thick-
ness may be &gt;xg. From the straight-line plot, the inter-
cept is t&ndash;2 and the slope is �xg�2. We will now go
through an example in detail.
</p>
<p>An example: If we apply this method to Figure
21.6, we find that the first set of values of si for
the three dark fringes are s1, s2, and s3 given in
Table 21.1. Now we guess the values of n as
shown in column 2 to give the values for (sj/nj)
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>in column 3.
These data do not plot as a straight line because
</p>
<p>both (s1/1)
2 and (s3/3)
</p>
<p>2 are less than (s2/2)
2. So
</p>
<p>we then assign the integer 2 to the first fringe, etc.
We then find a second set of values as shown
in Table 21.2, and these numbers plot as a str-
aight line as shown in Figure 21.8B. The intercept
of the line with the ordinate is 1/t2, and this

</p>
<p>Now you can see why this procedure lends itself to
computerization.You can digitize the fringes by scanning
the pattern on your TEM screen across the STEM detec-
tor or do it directly via a CCD camera. As we noted,
software is available to do this analysis but this isn&rsquo;t
difficult and you may even want to try writing the pro-
gram yourself or incorporate equation 21.2 into a spread-
sheet/graphing program. A good example of the relative
strengths of CBED and EELS thickness measurements
for a nanostructured material is given by Berta et al.
</p>
<p>21.3 UNIT-CELL DETERMINATION
</p>
<p>Before you start on the more esoteric aspects of crystal-
structure determination, such as the analysis of point
groups and space groups, you can make life much easier
for yourself by determining the unit cell of your speci-
men. Remember
</p>
<p>The unit cell is the smallest group of atoms or
molecules which, when repeated in 3D, generates
the lattice structure of the crystal.
</p>
<p>The unit cell possesses the symmetry and properties
of the lattice (assuming we could ever test a single,
isolated unit cell!). In fact, determination of the unit
cell is only possible if you already know the crystal
system of the specimen. So don&rsquo;t start with an unknown
structure! Remember
</p>
<p>There are seven different axial/coordinate systems
into which all crystals are classified: cubic, ortho-
rhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, trigonal, mono-
clinic, and triclinic.
</p>
<p>Now in TEM investigations it is rare that we look at a
totally unknown specimen and so, in this chapter, we&rsquo;ll
assume that you know the crystal structure of your speci-
men. If in fact you don&rsquo;t know the structure, then you
have to start with symmetry determination to find the
point group/space group (also see the companion text)
and then you can deduce the crystal system. Remember
</p>
<p>The point group defines a set of 2D symmetry
operations (rotations or reflections), acting through
a point, which leaves the crystal unchanged. There
are 32 unique point groups.
</p>
<p>We can extend the definitions of symmetry to 3D.
Remember
</p>
<p>The space group is the complete set of 3D symme-
try operations (rotations, reflections, translations,
and combinations thereof) that leave the crystal
unchanged. There are 230 space groups.
</p>
<p>So, assuming you know the crystal system, let&rsquo;s
determine the unit-cell dimensions. We saw in the pre-
vious chapter that a CBED pattern at small L often
reveals one or more rings of HOLZ intensity and
you&rsquo;ve just learned how to index the diffraction disks
that make up these rings and the pairs of HOLZ lines
that attach themselves to the HOLZ reflections. If you
don&rsquo;t know the crystal structure, then, of course, it will be
rather difficult to index the pattern since you don&rsquo;t know
the appropriate systematic absences. But these rings are
useful, even if you haven&rsquo;t indexed the individual disks.
</p>
<p>If you measure the radii of the rings (G), you can
deduce the lattice-repeat vector of the crystal parallel to
the beam direction.
</p>
<p>So by tilting to an orientation in which the beam is
coming down an axis of the unit cell such as [001] in an
orthorhombic crystal, the disk spacings in the ZOLZ
pattern will give you the [100] and [010] lattice param-
eters and the HOLZ-ring radius will give you [001].
(Now you see why you can&rsquo;t do this if you don&rsquo;t know
the crystal system to start with, since you don&rsquo;t know
what lattice spacings and angles to expect.)
</p>
<p>So you should be able to determine all the lattice
parameters of the unit cell from a single ZOLZ/HOLZ
pattern. If you&rsquo;re not sure which pattern to choose, any
low-index (i.e., high-symmetry) pattern is a good starting
point. There are appropriate analytical expressions for
calculating the spacing between atomic planes parallel to
the beam and we&rsquo;ll discuss them next. These expressions
give you the lattice parameters, since the lattice spacing is
related to the lattice parameter by standard equations,
given in basic crystallography texts (see Chapter 18).
Then you have to look at differences between the
ZOLZ and HOLZ disk patterns to determine the type
of lattice centering. So we&rsquo;ll now show you how to utilize
a unique aspect of CBED patterns, namely, that from a
single 2D pattern, you can obtain 3D information about
your crystalline specimen.
</p>
<p>21.3.A Experimental Considerations
</p>
<p>The first thing you have to do is get CBED patterns
containing clear ZOLZ and HOLZ maxima. The pat-
terns should have a small L to reveal one or more rings.
</p>
<p>WARNING
If you don&rsquo;t recognize any of these definitions then
stop, do not pass this section. Return to the basic
crystallography texts (referenced in Chapter 18).
</p>
<p>TWO PATTERNS
It is good practice to record two patterns, one with a
large C2 aperture (therefore large a, Kossel condi-
tions) and one with a small C2 aperture to show the
individual disks (K-M conditions).
</p>
<p>354 ..............................................................................................................................................U S ING CONVERGENT -BEAM TECHNIQUES</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Such a pair of patterns is shown in Figure 21.9A and
B.Wewill use the ring pattern tomeasureG and the disk
pattern to index individual HOLZ reflections and
observe both the relative spacings and positions of
ZOLZ and HOLZ reflections.
</p>
<p>21.3.B The Importance of the HOLZ-Ring
Radius
</p>
<p>If you go back and look at Figures 20.11A&ndash;D and 20.12
you will be able to work out the simple geometrical
relationship between H and G.
</p>
<p>&amp; H in Figure 20.12 is the spacing of the reciprocal-
lattice planes parallel to the electron beam.
</p>
<p>&amp; Gn is the projected radius of a HOLZ ring that you
measure on the recording of the pattern. If the
HOLZ ring is split, always measure Gn using the
innermost ring.
</p>
<p>&amp; If the order of the ring is high, then the electrons are
scattered out to large angles (� � 108), and your
measurements may suffer from the effects of lens
distortion because the electrons are traveling close
to the polepiece. If this is happening, you must
calibrate the distortion in reciprocal space using a
known specimen from which G1, G2, etc., can be
calculated and compared with the values you obtain
experimentally. Of course, Cs correction will mini-
mize such distortion.
</p>
<p>Experimentally, you&rsquo;ll find it much easier tomeasure
G from a Kossel pattern because the HOLZ intensity
appears as one or more rings as in Figure 21.9A. Since
the radius of the Ewald sphere increases with decreasing
electron wavelength l, the value of G for any given
orientation will increase as the accelerating voltage is
raised, so it becomes increasingly difficult to see HOLZ
rings at intermediate voltages.
</p>
<p>From the geometry of Figures 20.11 and 20.12, and
assuming that terms inH2 are negligible, the radii of the
FOLZ and SOLZ rings, G1 and G2, are
</p>
<p>G1 &frac14;
2H
</p>
<p>l
</p>
<p>� �1=2
</p>
<p>(21:3)

<p>And from a theorem you learned in high-school
geometry

<p>G2 &frac14; 2

</p>
<p>l
</p>

</p>
<p>(21:4)
</p>
<p>where both G andH are in reciprocal-space units (nm&ndash;1
</p>
<p>or Å�1). Similar expressions can be developed, if you
need them, for third- and higher-order zones. In prac-
tice, most people find it easier to think in real space
rather than reciprocal space and so we rewrite these
equations in terms of the spacing between Laue zones
(H�1) in real-space units. We use the inverse relation-
ship between real and reciprocal spaces to give, for the
FOLZ

camera constant lL (nm mm)

<p>(21:6)
</p>
<p>You must take the time to measure lL carefully (see
Section 9.6) because this will minimize errors in H�1
</p>
<p>which could be quite large due to the (lL)2 dependence
in equation 21.6. From the above equations and from
Figure 20.12, you can see that a low-symmetry zone axis
with a smallHwill give rise to a smaller HOLZ ring than
for a high-symmetry zone. The smaller ring will be easier
to observe at any chosen L.
</p>
<p>Summarizing the story so far: by measuringR values,
you can determine the real-lattice spacing (H�1) parallel
to the beam direction. The next thing to do is compare
this measured value, H�1m with calculated values H
</p>
<p>�1
c
</p>
<p>assuming a certain unit cell. NowH�1 is directly related
to the magnitude of the real-space direction vector
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>H
&frac14; j&frac12;UVW �j (21:7)
</p>
<p>and so this magnitude can be calculated for a specific
beam direction [UVW].
</p>
<p>An example: For an fcc crystal (Steeds 1979)
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>H
&frac14; a0&eth;U
</p>
<p>2 &thorn; V2 &thorn;W2&THORN;1=2
p
</p>
<p>(21:8)
</p>
<p>where a0 is the lattice parameter, p &frac14; 1 when
(U+V+W) is odd, and p &frac14; 2 when (U+V+W)
is even. For bcc crystals p&frac14; 2 ifU,V, andW are all
odd, otherwise p &frac14; 1. These conditions for p just
take account of structure-factor effects which
cause systematic absences of some reflections, or
in some cases whole rings. If a whole ring is absent,
the calculated reciprocal-lattice layer spacing H�1c
must be an integer multiple of the measured spac-
ing H�1m . Thus

<p>Hc
&frac14; n 1
</p>
<p>Hm
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(21:9)
</p>
<p>where nmust be an integer. If n is non-integral then
your indexing is wrong. A generalized method for
determining which Laue zone you should see has
been given in Jackson&rsquo;s 1990 paper. If you have
indexed the ZOLZ (i.e., [UVW] is known), R is
measured and l is known, then you can determine
Hwithout the need to index individual spots in the
HOLZ ring of intensity.
</p>
<p>There are more generalized equations for H�1
</p>
<p>than equation 21.8 (see Raghavan et al. and Ayer).
</p>
<p>Other examples: In a crystal system with orthogo-
nal axes (orthorhombic, tetragonal, or cubic sys-
tems, with lattice-repeat spacings a, b, c) if there
</p>
<p>are no absences of HOLZ layers (p=1) then for a
given zone axis UVW

<p>H
&frac14; &eth;a2&eth;U2 &thorn; V2 �UV&THORN; &thorn; c2W2&THORN;1=2 (21:11)

<p>1
</p>
<p>H
&frac14; &eth;3&eth;U2 &thorn; V2 &thorn;UV&THORN;2 &thorn; c2W&THORN;1=2 (21:12)

</p>
<p>H
&frac14; &eth;U2a2 &thorn; V2b2 &thorn;W2c2 &thorn; 2UWac cos b2&THORN;1=2
</p>
<p>(21:13)
</p>
<p>If you are working with a low-index, high-symmetry
zone axis it may be just as easy to determineH�1 directly
from reciprocal-lattice constructions rather than using
equations. However, for lower-symmetry crystallo-
graphic directions, such constructions are effectively
impossible to visualize and then you should use these
equations.
</p>
<p>So in summary we can give some guidelines
</p>
<p>&amp; Measure the radius of the HOLZ ring to give a value
of the reciprocal of the spacing between the HOLZ
and the ZOLZ, H�1m .
</p>
<p>&amp; Compare the measured spacing with the spacing
calculated assuming a given unit cell, H�1c .
</p>
<p>&amp; Themeasured value should agree with, or be amulti-
ple of, the calculated value. For example, if given a
square ZOLZ DP, you assume a cubic crystal then
the unit-cell repeat vector should be identical in all
three dimensions. So the FOLZ ring diameter should
give the same value ofH�1 as that determined for the
other two axes from the square [100] pattern. If H�1
</p>
<p>is different, then the crystal is not cubic but another
system, such as tetragonal.
</p>
<p>21.3.C Determining the Lattice Centering
</p>
<p>When you have measuredH�1 from the Kossel pattern,
the next thing to do is to compare the ZOLZ and FOLZ
reflections in the K-M pattern obtained with a small C2
aperture such as Figure 21.9B. The superposition of the
FOLZ and ZOLZ gives you information on the type of
lattice you are dealing with, since centered lattices of all
types will give different superposition patterns com-
pared with a primitive lattice.

</p>
<p>is indexed. (B) Schematic illustration of the superposition of the FOLZ

<p>tron beam down [001] showing the differences in the superposition for
</p>
<p>(P) primitive, (A) A-centered, (B) B-centered, and (C) I-centered lattices.
</p>
<p>In a primitive lattice, the FOLZ will superimpose
directly on the ZOLZ because there are no systematic
absences. However, face-centered and body-centered lat-
tices will give rise to displacements of the FOLZ pattern
with respect to the ZOLZ in certain beam directions as
illustrated schematically in Figure 21.10A. You can quite
easily work out the displacement in terms of a shift vector
for cubic crystal patterns in low-index orientations and we
showed examples back in Figure 21.2 and 21.3. It is not so
simple in more complex crystals but Jackson (1987) has
developed a generalized method of determining the shift
vector t for all crystal systems and all orientations
</p>
<p>t &frac14; g� u� HNLju�j
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(21:14)
</p>
<p>where g is the vector for the hkl HOLZ reflection, u* is
the vector normal to the ZOLZ and parallel to H, and
NL is the number of the Laue zone containing hkl. To
determine t then all you do is look up values of H, u*,
and H/|u*|, tabulated by Jackson.
</p>
<p>An example: We can illustrate the shift due to
lattice type, by looking at Figure 21.10B, which is
a series of schematic patterns for an orthorhombic
cell (given byAyer) oriented along the [001] axis. In
each pattern the experimentally observed distribu-
tion of ZOLZ and FOLZ reflections is shown and
adjacent to it is the same pattern but containing the
FOLZ reciprocal-lattice points. So the FOLZ ring
of spots is always coincident with the FOLZ recip-
rocal-lattice points. In the top pattern (P) the
ZOLZ and FOLZ superimpose exactly and this
would be the case for a primitive unit cell. In (A)
the FOLZ lattice is displaced from the ZOLZ
reflections by half the spacing of the ZOLZ recip-
rocal-lattice points in the [010] direction; this is the
situation expected for an A-face-centered lattice.
The next two patterns (B and I) show the expected
displacements for a B-face-centered and an I
(body-centered) lattice.
</p>
<p>So you now know how to measure the lattice-repeat
vectors in three dimensions and determine the type of
lattice centering. This information should be sufficient
to allow you to determine the correct unit cell of your
specimen, particularly if you have further information,
such as elemental analysis by XEDS or EELS.
</p>
<p>21.4 BASICS OF SYMMETRY
DETERMINATION
</p>
<p>21.4.A Reminder of Symmetry Concepts
</p>
<p>Before you study the following two sections in the com-
panion text, you must have a basic understanding of
crystal-symmetry elements (both rotational and
</p>
<p>21 .4 BAS ICS OF SYMMETRY DETERMINAT ION ...................................................................................................................................... 357</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>translational) and be familiar with the standard inter-
national notation for point groups and space groups
(see Section 16.10). You will also need to know how to
represent the point-group symmetry of a crystal using
the stereographic projection we discussed in Section
18.4. In Figure 21.11 we reproduce the standard point-
group table familiar to any student of crystallography.
</p>
<p>Historically, point-group determination has been
the domain of X-ray crystallographers and electron
microscopists have gladly avoided such concepts. How-
ever, the point group is not only useful for classifying
crystals with common symmetry elements, but it is also
an important indicator of many of the properties of the
crystal, such as anisotropy in the electrical resistivity or
the refractive index (all described in glorious detail in
the classic text by Nye). With the availability of CBED
you can determine the point group of a crystal directly
in the TEM, simply by recording two or three low-index
ZAPs.
</p>
<p>This process has a tremendous advantage over clas-
sic X-ray techniques because
</p>
<p>&amp; We obtain this information from much smaller
regions than is possible using X-rays.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can also distinguish all 32 possible point groups
unambiguously, which is a non-trivial process using
X-rays.
</p>
<p>So as an electronmicroscopist, youmust nowmaster
the details of point-group determination if you are to
take full advantage of the capabilities of a modern
TEM. This is described in detail in the companion text
and you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s not too difficult an exercise, but
there is no escaping the need to comprehend some of the
basic principles of crystal symmetry. The exercises will
require quite a lot of careful work and time. Therefore, if
you can uniquely identify the unknown phase in your
specimen through some other technique, such as XEDS
or EELS, do so.
</p>
<p>21.4.B Friedel&rsquo;s Law
</p>
<p>Symmetry determination in crystals has evolved from
the early work of Friedel and von Laue on the kinemat-
ical theory of XRD. We can summarize a fundamental
aspect of Friedel&rsquo;s work by Friedel&rsquo;s law.
</p>
<p>If this law holds, then it is not possible to tell by
diffraction whether an inversion center is present in the
crystal or not. This is the case for most XRD patterns
</p>
<p>from single crystals, because most XRD occurs under
kinematical conditions.
</p>
<p>So, under kinematical diffraction conditions, we
cannot readily distinguish amirror plane from a twofold
rotational axis (diad) parallel to the mirror plane. That
is equivalent to saying that we cannot distinguish point
groups m and 2. Similarly, the presence of a fourfold
rotation axis (tetrad) in a crystal, parallel to the c axis,
results in Ihkl &frac14; I�hkl &frac14; I�h�kl &frac14; Ih�kl where Ihkl denotes the
diffracted intensity of a reflection of type hkl. This DP
cannot be distinguished from one containing two per-
pendicular mirror planes whose intersection is parallel
to the rotation axis.
</p>
<p>XRD is thus severely limited for point-group deter-
mination because of Friedel&rsquo;s law. Since crystals which
do not possess true centers of symmetry (non-centro-
symmetric crystals) still appear in X-ray DPs to possess
a center of symmetry; they cannot be readily distin-
guished from centrosymmetric crystals. If you go back
and look at the 32 point groups in Figure 21.11 and
remove all those which do not contain a center of symme-
try, then you are left with only 11 centrosymmetric point
groups: �1, 2/m (equivalent to mm), mmm, �3, �3m, 4/m, 4/
mmm, 6/m, 6/mmm, m�3, and m�3m. These 11 point groups
are known as the Laue classes in XRD. Except under
&lsquo;anomalous&rsquo; scattering conditions, XRD can only deter-
mine these 11 symmetry groups.
</p>
<p>So, to get the full symmetry information, the crystal
must be thick enough for you to see dynamical diffrac-
tion contrast within the CBED disks. If you then exam-
ine the intensity distributions within individual hkl
reflections you can distinguish centrosymmetric and
non-centrosymmetric crystals. Thus, in CBED patterns,
the 32 crystal point groups are not reduced to the 11
Laue classes, as occurs in XRD.
</p>
<p>21.4.C Looking for Symmetry in Your Patterns
</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t perform point-group determination with-
out learning how to discern symmetry elements in
</p>
<p>FRIEDEL&rsquo;S LAW
Under kinematical diffraction conditions, the inten-
sity of a reflection hkl is equal to the intensity in its
opposite reflection �h�k�l.
</p>
<p>MIRROR PLANE
The presence of a mirror plane in a crystal, parallel to
axes a and b, makes the intensity of all reflections of
type hkl equal to the intensity of the corresponding
�h�k�l reflection.
</p>
<p>WHEN FRIEDEL FAILS
In CBED patterns, Friedel&rsquo;s law breaks down
because of dynamical scattering.

<p>CBED patterns. When we look at CBED-pattern sym-
metry we use the same notation as for point groups,
i.e., a number X (=1, 2, 3, 4, or 6) for a rotation axis
and m for a mirror plane parallel to the rotation axis
and a second m for any independent mirror plane.
Inversion symmetry or a mirror normal to the beam
direction cannot be discerned and so the terms of the
</p>
<p>formX or X/m are not used. The only combinations
we can get are the same as for the 10 2D point groups:
1, 2,m, 2mm, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, or 6mm. These symbols
refer to the observable symmetry in the pattern, and
four examples of different pattern symmetries are
shown schematically in Figure 21.12.

<p>Symmetry determination is generally carried out
using ZAPs although there is useful information in off-
axis patterns. Remember, to get a well centered ZAP
</p>
<p>&amp; You may find it easier to do the final adjustments to
get an exact ZAP using the beam tilt/shift controls.
</p>
<p>&amp; As a last resort, you may have to displace the C2
aperture slightly off axis to center it precisely around
the center of symmetry in the ZAP.
</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got a centered ZAP, there are specific
kinds of symmetry for which to search
</p>
<p>&amp; Whole-pattern (WP) symmetry.
&amp; Bright-field (BF) symmetry.
&amp; Projection-diffraction symmetry.
</p>
<p>The first andmost important is theWP symmetry.
To be sure you get the correct symmetry, you
</p>
<p>should take a small camera-length pattern to include
the HOLZ rings since HOLZ effects are not always
visible in the ZOLZ (e.g., they may be hidden by the
intense 000 disk). The pattern can be either a Kossel or a
K-M pattern. The WP symmetry at any orientation
must belong to one of the 10 2D point groups listed.
</p>
<p>The second kind of symmetry is the BF symmetry.
In this case, the presence of the HOLZ lines ensures
</p>
<p>that the BF-disk symmetry contains 3D information.
Take care to ensure that the C2 aperture is small enough
so that you can see the 000 disk without any overlap
from other diffraction disks. For example, the 000 disk
back in Figure 20.2B has an array of deficient HOLZ
lines which displays 3m BF symmetry.
</p>
<p>If there is only 2Ddiffuse intensity within the disk, or
if you ignore theHOLZ lines, then the symmetry is more
correctly called the BF projection symmetry. The sym-
metry in either of these latter cases should again be
classified into one of the 10 2D groups just listed.
You&rsquo;ll see in the companion text that combination of
the WP and BF symmetry in three ZAPs is often suffi-
cient to determine the point group.
</p>
<p>On some occasions the projection-diffraction symme-
try may be all that is available.
</p>
<p>The diffuse contrast within these disks arises from
dynamical interactions within the zero-order reciprocal-
lattice layer of the crystal that give rise to K-M fringes,
which we used above for thickness determination. The
projection-diffraction symmetry is simply the symmetry
displayed in SADPs. Since this symmetry is only 2D, it is
not as useful as the WP and BF symmetry. If you go
back and examine Figure 20.2B, the projection-diffrac-
tion symmetry is visible in the ZOLZ Kikuchi bands
which show a sixfold rotational symmetry with two
independent mirror planes, one within the Kikuchi
bands and one between them, giving 6mm symmetry.
Similar symmetry is shown in the SADP from Si in
Figure 20.2A.
</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned the basics you should be able
to breeze through the companion text which describes the
process for point-group determination, step by step. After
point-group determination you&rsquo;ll also be shown how to
determine space groups. This exercise is a little more
challenging and space groups are somewhat less impor-
tant than point groups in terms of relating crystal sym-
metry to materials properties. Nevertheless, the space
group of your specimen is an important crystallographic
characteristic and since there are 230 of them it is a much
more selective characteristic than the point group.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll now go on to discuss some more informa-
tion that is available in HOLZ lines but, before you
do this and before you read the CBED chapter in the
companion text, we must warn you that symmetry
determination from CBED patterns requires that
you use your eyes to make a judgment on the pres-
ence or absence of certain symmetry elements and so
this is not an exact science. There are &lsquo;error bars&rsquo; in
CBED symmetry and guidance on how to judge
whether imperfections in the symmetry of the pat-
terns can be ignored or not is also given in the
companion text.
</p>
<p>21.5 LATTICE-STRAIN MEASUREMENT
</p>
<p>Strain arises from local changes in the lattice spacings of
the material. Strain may arise from the presence of
defects such as dislocations and coherent precipitates
</p>
<p>WP SYMMETRY
The WP symmetry is just what it says: it&rsquo;s the sym-
metry of the whole pattern, including the relative
positions of the HOLZ reflections and any HOLZ
Kikuchi lines.
</p>
<p>PROJECTION-DIFFRACTION SYMMETRY
This is displayed by the intensity in the direct 000
beam plus the hkl diffracted beams in the ZOLZ layer
and corresponds to the projected 2D symmetry of the
crystal down the zone axis that you have selected. It
ignores any contributions fromHOLZ layers, such as
HOLZ lines and HOLZ reflections, but includes any
diffuse intensity within these disks.
</p>
<p>BF SYMMETRY
BF symmetry is the symmetry of the 000 disk
</p>
<p>only, when HOLZ lines are present.

<p>or through local changes in chemistry. Such chemical
changes can arise naturally or can be carefully intro-
duced by controlling the deposition parameters for
layered nanostructures formed by MBE or CVD meth-
ods. Either way, knowing the exact value of the strain is
important in areas as diverse as mechanics, electronics,
and optics. We can get a reasonably accurate measure-
ment of the lattice constants (�2%) by indexing the
reflections in the ZOLZ and/or by measurement of the
HOLZ-ring diameter. However, the best method is to
use the positions of HOLZ lines in the BF disk which,
because they arise from very high order reflections, are
very sensitive to changes in lattice parameter. Results
that are an order of magnitude more precise (�0.2%)
can be obtained by computer simulation of the position
of the HOLZ lines using different lattice constants. The
values that produce the best match with the experimen-
tally observed HOLZ-line positions can be identified as
the lattice constants of the crystal. So by measuring the
HOLZ-line positions we can measure changes in lattice
parameters. Materials scientists and nanotechnologists,
particularly in the electronics industry, are most inter-
ested in changes due to lattice strain.
</p>
<p>Local measurement of lattice strain has always been
of interest to materials scientists and indeed we devote
the whole of Chapter 25 to imaging of strain effects.
Typically, direct lattice-strain measurements were per-
formed by X-ray methods but the need for higher spatial
resolution in semiconductor technology and nanostruc-
tured materials has created a tremendous market for
CBED-based methods. For example, in semiconductor
manufacturing and optical technologies, strain-layer
superlattices (e.g., epitaxial layers of GaAs and AlGaAs
which differ slightly in their precisely controlled lattice
parameters) are widely used. Specific infrared sensors can
be tuned, optical waveguides can be modulated, the
</p>
<p>threshold voltages of lasers can be tweaked, and so
on. Introducing local strain into the channel in semi-
conductor junctions to enhance carrier mobility and
reduce the resistance between the source and drain has
increased chip performance markedly, permitting
Moore&rsquo;s law to be extended for yet a few more years.
This concept is also referred to as &lsquo;strain engineering&rsquo;
and is central to the success of nanostructured electron-
ics and optical devices.
</p>
<p>Early CBED work in this area involved the measure-
ment of strain around precipitates in thin foils (Rozeveld
andHowe) and this has been extended down to nanometer-
size probes coupled with sophisticated algorithms for
matching the HOLZ-line patterns and extracting the strain
measurement. Figure 21.13 shows the extraordinary match
that can now be achieved between experiment and theory
using Zuo&rsquo;s software which is a development of the early
algorithms given in Spence and Zuo. Similar software is
continuously being refinedbymany researchers andvarious
forms are available on the Web at the URLs listed at the
end of the chapter. As always, check the validity of the
software by checking how well it simulates patterns from
known specimens in known orientations: caveat emptor
even if it&rsquo;s free!
</p>
<p>In early computer programs, the position of the
HOLZ lines in the simulation was derived from kinemat-
ical diffraction theory only, but dynamical effects may
be important and should always be included, otherwise
the match is incorrect (Eades et al.). The method is
summarized in three steps.
</p>
<p>&amp; Start with a standard specimen of known lattice
parameter to establish the exact electron wavelength
for subsequent simulations.
</p>
<p>&amp; Adjust the continuous kV control. Since you know
the lattice parameter, you can determine the exact kV.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; At this predetermined kV setting, obtain a HOLZ-line
pattern from the unknown and compare the experi-
mental pattern with simulated patterns generated for a
range of lattice parameters, until good matching is
achieved between the simulated and experimental pat-
terns (see Figure 21.13). Theoretically, an accuracy of
0.02% should be achievable but in practice an accu-
racy of 0.2% is generally obtained.
</p>
<p>While this approach has demonstrated reasonable suc-
cess in measuring lattice-parameter shifts as reviewed by
Randle et al., you should be wary of other possible causes
of HOLZ-line shifts and the difficulties of exact matching
between theory and experiment. Often the HOLZ-line
patterns display asymmetries which make matching diffi-
cult. Remember, you&rsquo;ll probably need to cool the speci-
men so you can see HOLZ lines in some materials. There
are some necessary precautions you should take
</p>
<p>&amp; Compare your standard and unknown under identi-
cal conditions.
</p>
<p>&amp; Take account of any differences in thermal-contrac-
tion coefficient if you cool the specimen to liquid-N2
temperatures.
</p>
<p>&amp; Watch for problems such as surface relaxation, or
local strain, or the presence of dislocation lines
which can give rise to spurious measurements of
lattice parameter.
</p>
<p>With this same approach we can also make localized
measurements of strain around precipitates or defects,
but the data are always averaged through the foil thick-
ness and in one dimension and so the interpretation can
be difficult. Furthermore, strain relaxation due to the
presence of the surfaces of the specimen is an ever-
present challenge. However, particularly in planar,
thin-film layered structures it is often possible to tilt
the specimen so that the local strain is projected along
the beam direction. It is also feasible to use this HOLZ-
line shift approach to infer, indirectly, the composition
of a specimen by comparing the lattice parameter of an
unknown with a standard of known composition and in
the case of binary solid solutions, extrapolating to other
compositions assuming that Végard&rsquo;s law applies. Such
an analysis is not limited by elemental considerations or
absorption, as is the case for XEDS, and does not
require ultra-thin specimens as for EELS. However,
this method is indirect and makes several assumptions
that may not always apply. It&rsquo;s a last resort.
</p>
<p>21.6 DETERMINATION
OF ENANTIOMORPHISM
</p>
<p>The terms &lsquo;handedness,&rsquo; &lsquo;chirality,&rsquo; and &lsquo;enantiomorph-
ism&rsquo; all refer to the same thing. We say that a crystal or
molecule is &lsquo;handed&rsquo; if two forms of the structure occur,
and if we describe the atomic coordinates of one of them
in a right-handed set of axes, the atomic coordinates of
the other structure will be identical in a left-handed coor-
dinate system. These two structures, termed &lsquo;enantio-
morphic&rsquo; or &lsquo;chiral,&rsquo; are mirror images of each other
and we refer to them as the right-handed and left-handed
forms. (Look at your hands and try and rotate them into
exact coincidence and all this should be clear.) If you go
back and look at the section on symmetry concepts, you
should be able to convince yourself that any crystal that
contains a mirror (m), inversion center (�1), or a fourfold
inversion axis (4) cannot show chirality.
</p>
<p>By the way, if you don&rsquo;t think such an esoteric topic
as enantiomorphism is important then a salutary fact is
that the drug thalidomide (2-(2,6-dioxo-3-piperidyl)
isoindole-1,3-dione) comes in enantiomorphic crystal
forms. One enantiomer (the S-form) causes catastrophic
birth defects in children and the other (R-form) provides
the desired therapeutic effects for women suffering dif-
ficult pregnancies and is particularly efficacious as a
treatment for disfiguring skin lesions such as those aris-
ing from leprosy. Thousands of seriously deformed chil-
dren were born because of the failure to distinguish the
different effects of the two enantiomorphs. This tragedy
gave rise to the whole field of single-enantiomer drug
development (currently a $100B/yr market in the USA
alone), avoiding the common racemic mixture of both
forms that is produced in most chemical processes.
</p>
<p>So, although we don&rsquo;t often need to know which of
the two-handed forms we are looking at, there are occa-
sions when it is of the utmost importance, and several
groups have worked hard on the determination of hand-
edness from CBED.
</p>
<p>Enantiomorphism is an essentially 3D phenomenon
(again, look at your hands). Since the projection of a
crystal is a 2D object, a projection of the structure
cannot tell you anything about the handedness. This
means that, in ZAPs, to see handedness, we must look
at effects of HOLZ diffraction or, more generally, if
your specimen is not at a zone axis, there must be
diffraction involving at least three non-coplanar diffrac-
tion vectors in addition to the direct beam. This condi-
tion does not necessarily mean that we have to look at a
HOLZ pattern. It means that we have to look at HOLZ
diffraction effects which, as you now know well, may
appear in the ZOLZ as well as in HOLZ directly. In the
example given in Figure 21.14, the asymmetric effects
are visible only in the reflections in the first HOLZ ring.
</p>
<p>Looking at HOLZ effects, we can readily see the
difference between enantiomorphs. But just observing
</p>
<p>LATTICE PARAMETERS FROM CBED
For determining precise values, compare the experi-
mental HOLZ-line patterns to the computer-
simulated version.
</p>
<p>21 .6 DETERMINAT ION OF ENANT IOMORPH I SM ..................................................................................................................................... 363</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the difference does not let us to say which structure is
which hand. It does allow us to say whether two crystals
have the same or opposite handedness.
</p>
<p>The determination of whether a particular crystal is
right-handed or left-handed requires a dynamical calcu-
lation to simulate CBED patterns which you must then
compare with the experimental patterns. But note
</p>
<p>&amp; You&rsquo;ll find that such a comparison with experiment
is not always easy because there is often ambiguity in
the indexing of the pattern and, if your indexing is
wrong, the handedness will be wrong.
</p>
<p>&amp; To perform the simulation and thus to determine the
handedness, you need to know the full crystal
structure.
</p>
<p>&amp; Some authors have suggested that the dynamical cal-
culations (needed to say which enantiomorph is which)
can be done by hand, e.g., by calculating the phases of
the structure factors and working out the effects of
multiple-diffraction paths. However, this calculation
requires considerable understanding of dynamical dif-
fraction and it is surely easier, as well as more reliable,
to perform a full dynamical simulation using some of
the software we&rsquo;ve already referenced.
</p>
<p>Recently Inui et al. have systematically tabulated
appropriate zone axes for the determination of handed-
ness for all the point groups that can show handedness.
In studies of enantiomorphism, it is crucial to determine
</p>
<p>whether or not a CBED pattern contains mirror sym-
metry or not. You&rsquo;ll find that doing this is not always
easy but, if you use off-axis patterns rather than ZAPs,
the asymmetries tend to be stronger, as described by
Jones (and also shown in Figure 21.14).
</p>
<p>21.7 STRUCTURE FACTOR AND CHARGE-
DENSITY DETERMINATION
</p>
<p>When you read the literature about CBED and its
applications, you&rsquo;ll often come across references to
extraction of structure factor (Fhkl) values via CBED.
(Go back to Chapter 3 to remind yourself of the impor-
tance of structure factors in electron diffraction.) You
should remember that |F(y)|2 is direct measure of the
diffracted intensity. Direct, reproducible, and quantita-
tive measurement of the diffracted intensity is basically
impossible in SADPs but is quite feasible in CBED
patterns, especially when they are energy-filtered. When
we determine a specific crystal structure for our specimen,
it is, in fact, equivalent to assigning a structure-factor
phase to the diffraction disks in the pattern. There are
</p>

</p>
<p>slightly away from the zone axis to improve the contrast. The ZOLZ
</p>
<p>(the bright spots just below the center of the figure) shows mirror sym-
</p>
<p>metry but in the HOLZ ring (above the center) the reflections are clearly
</p>
<p>asymmetric. If the specimen had the other chirality, the HOLZ ring would
</p>
<p>be mirrored across the vertical axis of the pattern.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 21.15 A three-dimensional rendering of the experimental differ-
</p>
<p>ence map between the static crystal charge density (determined from quan-
</p>
<p>titative analysis of CBED patterns) and the superimposed spherical charge
</p>
<p>density of O2&ndash; and Cu+ ions. The color scheme is blue where the difference
</p>
<p>in charge density is negative (Dr &lt; 0), white where it is zero (Dr= 0), and
</p>
<p>red where it is positive (Dr&gt; 0). The difference would be zero everywhere
</p>
<p>if cuprite were purely ionic (i.e., the ions were indeed spherical). The non-
</p>
<p>spherical charge distortion on the Cu atoms shows the characteristic
</p>
<p>shape of d orbitals. The positive charge in the tetrahedral interstitial
</p>
<p>regions suggests Cu&ndash;Cu covalent bonding.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>several ways to do this and advances in computer simu-
lation and CCD cameras make the direct, quantitative
interpretation of diffracted intensity much more tract-
able, but the essential steps were all described by Spence
and Zuo. Basically, we match computer simulations of
intensity variations in the CBED disks with the experi-
mental patterns, assigning specific values of Fhkl to each
of the reflections until the best fit is obtained. So it is
computer-intensive, but that is not a problem today.
</p>
<p>Once the structure-factor data are obtained, a very
useful side effect is that the valence-electron density can
be measured from the low-order structure factors and
this characteristic is otherwise inaccessible experimen-
tally for crystals without an inversion symmetry (Spack-
man et al.). Once measured, the valence-electron density
can be mapped out and the culmination of much of this
work was the first-ever direct imaging of an atomic
bond (Zuo et al.) (Figure 21.15).
</p>
<p>21.8 OTHER METHODS
</p>
<p>21.8.A Scanning Methods
</p>
<p>Diffraction is as useful in scanning-beam instruments as
in TEM. As we discussed back in Chapter 18, electron-
backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies are as ubiqui-
tous today as SAD and CBED and very complemen-
tary. Many more crystals can be studied by EBSD and
the specimen does not need to be thinned. EBSD pat-
terns contain HOLZ lines just like CBED patterns.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Historically, electron channeling was another way to
obtain crystallographic information in the SEM but the
patterns are of such low contrast that EBSD has ren-
dered the channeling technique obsolete (for now).
</p>
<p>Scanning DPs can be obtained in STEMs using
either one or two sets of coils both before and after the
specimen. In both cases the beam is stationary at the
plane of the specimen and rocks back and forth in a
manner similar to the hollow-cone or precession meth-
ods we described in Chapters 18 and 20. Using only one
scan coil below the specimen partially &lsquo;de-rocks&rsquo; the
beam but two coils fully &lsquo;de-rock&rsquo; the beam such that,
instead of the DP scanning across the BF STEM detec-
tor and being recorded sequentially, the 000 disk is
always on the optic axis and thus on the BF detector.
However, the HOLZ lines, etc., move continuously
across the detector because, like Kikuchi lines, they are
&lsquo;fixed&rsquo; to the specimen. The resulting double-rocking
patterns, which are often named after their inventor,
Alwyn Eades, cover several degrees in comparison
with the fractions of a degree visible in a normal
CBED disk. These patterns are very striking as you
can appreciate from Figure 21.16; such patterns can be
viewed in BF orDF and, as with all CBED patterns, can
be sharpened by energy filtering. These scanning meth-
ods can be used to study the occurrence of forbidden
</p>
<p>reflections which are important in crystal-symmetry
determinations and more detail is given in the compan-
ion text.
</p>
<p>21.8.B Nanodiffraction
</p>
<p>Nanodiffraction, as the term implies, involves diffrac-
tion with a nanometer-scale beam and has been pio-
neered by Cowley. Nanometer beams have only a few
picoamps of current so the patterns are noisy and
require a FEG-TEM (or DSTEM), which also provides
a coherent beam. If you scan the literature, you&rsquo;ll find
that nanodiffraction permits determination of local var-
iations of crystallography within large individual unit
cells, dislocation cores, grain-boundary segregant films,
individual nanotubes or nanoparticles such as catalysts.
Figure 21.17 shows nanodiffraction patterns from a
single, multi-walled, carbon nanotube.
</p>
<p>In addition, it is possible to assess crystallographic
effects associated with medium-range ordering by
correlating atom positions over distance of a few nan-
ometers. Nanodiffraction methods have helped develop
the new field of fluctuation microscopy which we men-
tion again in Chapter 29; they are also essential for
diffractive imaging with atomic resolution.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
CBED patterns contain contrast information which gives a complete crystallographic
characterization of small crystals, as well as other information such as thickness. To make
the most of this capability you need detailed knowledge of crystal-symmetry concepts,
stereographic projections, and the ability to produce ZAPs from a variety of orientations.
In addition, the determined operator is often rewarded with patterns that are both very
useful and stunningly beautiful. Before you go and read about CBED in the companion text,
remember that, if you want to determine the point group and/or the space group from your
CBED patterns, you need to determine
</p>
<p>&amp; WP symmetry
&amp; BF symmetry
&amp; Projection-diffraction symmetry
</p>
<p>CBED symmetry information from the HOLZ-line distribution in the 000 disk is also
very useful for measuring other characteristics of our specimens which cannot be deter-
mined, on a nanoscale, by other techniques. The examples we showed were lattice strain, an
essential variable in the electronics and optical industries, enantiomorphism, structure-
factor and charge-density determinations. If you&rsquo;ve successfully worked your way through
these two chapters, then you&rsquo;re ready for the companion text and the more challenging
aspects of CBED, such as measurement of defect crystallography, structure factors, Debye-
Waller factors, polarity, and charge density which are discussed in depth in the essential
texts by Spence and Zuo and by Morniroli.

<p>Amplitude Contrast
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already mentioned in Chapters 2&ndash;4 that TEM image contrast arises because of the
scattering of the incident beam by the specimen. The electron wave can change both its
amplitude and its phase as it traverses the specimen and both types of change can give rise to
image contrast. Thus a fundamental distinction we make in the TEM is between amplitude
contrast and phase contrast. In most situations, both types of contrast actually contribute to
an image, although we usually select conditions so that one will tend to dominate. In this
chapter, we&rsquo;ll discuss only amplitude contrast and we&rsquo;ll see that there are two principal
types, namely, mass-thickness contrast and diffraction contrast. This kind of contrast is
observed in both TEM and STEM and in both BF and DF images. We&rsquo;ll discuss the
important differences between the images formed in each of these two modes of operation.
Then we&rsquo;ll go on to discuss the principles of diffraction contrast, which are sufficiently
complex that it takes Chapters 24&ndash;27 to show you how this form of contrast is used to
identify and distinguish different crystal defects. Diffraction-contrast imaging came into
prominence in about 1956 when it was realized that the intensity in a diffracted beam
depends strongly on the deviation parameter, s, and that crystal defects rotate the diffract-
ing planes near the defect. Therefore, the diffraction contrast from regions close to the defect
will depend on the properties (in particular, the strain field) of the defect.We&rsquo;ll then consider
phase contrast and how it can be used to image atomic-level detail in Chapters 23 and 28.
Other forms of TEM imaging and variations on these major types of contrast are gathered
in the catch-all Chapter 29.
</p>
<p>22.1 WHAT IS CONTRAST?
</p>
<p>Before we start to describe specific types of contrast it&rsquo;s
worth a quick reminder of what exactly we mean by the
word &lsquo;contrast.&rsquo; We can define contrast (C) quantita-
tively in terms of the difference in intensity (DI) between
two adjacent areas
</p>
<p>C &frac14; I2 � I1&eth; &THORN;
I1
</p>
<p>&frac14;
DI
</p>
<p>I1
(22:1)
</p>
<p>In practice your eyes can&rsquo;t detect intensity changes
&lt;5% and even &lt;10% is difficult. So unless the contrast
from your specimen exceeds&gt;5&ndash;10% you won&rsquo;t see any-
thing on the screen or on the recorded image. However, if
your image is digitally recorded, you can enhance low-
contrast images electronically to levels at which your eyes
can perceive the contrast. We&rsquo;ll return to image proces-
sing and contrast enhancement in Chapter 31.
</p>
<p>So we see contrast in TEM images as different
levels of green light coming from the viewing screen
</p>
<p>or the computer display. On the photograph or com-
puter screen, contrast is seen as different gray levels
and our eyes can only discern about 16 of these. If we
want to quantify the contrast, we need to make direct
intensity measurements, e.g., via a microdensitometer
if we&rsquo;re using film or directly from the CCD, but
usually it&rsquo;s only necessary to see qualitative differ-
ences in intensity. Be careful not to confuse intensity
with contrast when you describe your images. We can
have strong or weak contrast but not bright or dark
contrast. The terms &lsquo;bright&rsquo; and &lsquo;dark&rsquo; refer to density
(number/unit area) of electrons hitting the screen or
detector, and the subsequent light emission that we
see. In fact, you generally get the strongest contrast
under illumination conditions that lower the overall
intensity. Conversely, you can try to increase the num-
ber of electrons falling on the screen by condensing the
beam onto a reduced area of the specimen, but then
you&rsquo;ll usually lower the image contrast. These points
are summarized in Figure 22.1, which defines intensity
and contrast.
</p>
<p>22.1 WHAT I S CONTRAST ? .......................................................................................................................................................................... 371</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Before we discuss the two forms of amplitude con-
trast in detail, we need to remind you of the operational
principles for creating amplitude contrast in your image.
We obtain contrast in our images either by selecting
specific electrons or excluding them from the imaging
system. We have two choices: we can form either BF or
DF images by selecting the direct or scattered electrons,
respectively. So this chapter builds on what you learned
about electron scattering in Chapters 2&ndash;4 and how to
operate the TEM, described in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>22.2 AMPLITUDE CONTRAST
</p>
<p>Amplitude contrast results from variations in mass or
thickness or a combination of the two: the thickness
variation can produce contrast because the electron
interacts with more material (hence, more mass). Alter-
natively, diffraction can vary locally because the speci-
men is not a perfect, uniformly thin sheet.
</p>
<p>22.2.A Images and Diffraction Patterns
</p>
<p>If you look back at Figure 2.1, you&rsquo;ll see that the uni-
form electron intensity in the incident beam is trans-
formed into a non-uniform intensity after scattering by
the specimen. So a variable electron intensity hits the
viewing screen or the electron detector, which translates
into contrast on the screen. Now you also know that the
DP shows you this non-uniformity because it separates
the diffracted and direct beams. Therefore, a fundamen-
tal principle of imaging in the TEM is: first, view the DP,
since this pattern tells you how your specimen is scatter-
ing. The relationship between the image and the DP is
most critical for crystalline specimens showing diffrac-
tion contrast. However, you should view theDP first, no
matter which contrast mechanism you want to use, or
the specimen you are studying.
</p>
<p>22.2.B Use of the Objective Aperture or the
STEM Detector: BF and DF Images
</p>
<p>In order to translate the electron scatter into interpretable
amplitude contrast, we select either the direct beam or a
diffracted beam in the SADP to form BF and DF images,
respectively. (Remember that a small aperture will
enhance the contrast but might decrease the resolution.)
Notewe are justified in using the &lsquo;beam&rsquo; terminology, since
the electrons have left the specimen.We&rsquo;ve already seen in
Section 9.3 that in aTEMwe select the direct or a scattered
electron beam with the objective aperture. Remember, if
we form an image without the aperture, the contrast will
be poorer (lower) because many beams then contribute to
the image so we lose diffraction contrast. Furthermore,
aberrations due to the off-axis electrons will make it
impossible to focus your image. Your choice of the aper-
ture size governs which electrons contribute to the image
and you thus control the contrast.
</p>
<p>Figure 22.2 shows a DP from a single-crystal Al
specimen with two possible positions of an objective
aperture indicated by white circles. In this figure, if the
aperture is in position A it selects the direct beam only
and thus a BF image will be formed in the image plane of
the lens. This arrangement will produce amplitude con-
trast whether the specimen is crystalline (as in this case)
or amorphous. If the aperture is in position B, it will
select only electrons scattered in that specific direction.
Thus a DF image will be formed. Traditionally (for 50
years), we have tilted the incident beam such that the
scattered electrons remain on axis when forming a DF
image. We thus create a centered dark-field (CDF)
image, which we described back in Section 9.3. We&rsquo;ll
discuss CDF techniques later in Section 22.5 and we&rsquo;ll
usually assume CDF is the operational mode in DF
imaging. However, you already know that it would be
much better if we did not tilt the specimen but instead
displaced the aperture (so the BF and DF are formed
with the same diffraction conditions). We&rsquo;ll see later

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>that if you want to observe phase contrast, you have to
use an objective aperture that is large enough to gather
more than one beam.
</p>
<p>In a STEMwe select the direct or scattered beams in
an equivalent way but use detectors rather than aper-
tures. We compare the two different operational modes
in Figure 22.3. Again, we saw back in Section 9.4 that we
insert a BF on-axis detector, or an annular DF (ADF)
detector, in a plane that&rsquo;s conjugate with the back focal
plane.We control which electrons fall on which detector
and thus contribute to the image by adjusting the post-
specimen (imaging) lenses to change the camera length.
Clearly, for DF imaging, the ADF detector will prob-
ably gather many more electrons than the objective
aperture, which is good for imaging some specimens
and bad for imaging others, as we&rsquo;ll see.
</p>
<p>So, in summary, we can create BF orDF images with
the direct beam or scattered beams, respectively. In
</p>
<p>order to understand and control the contrast in these
images you need to know what features of a specimen
cause scattering and what aspects of TEM operation
affect the contrast.
</p>
<p>22.3 MASS-THICKNESS CONTRAST
</p>
<p>Mass-thickness contrast arises from incoherent elastic
scattering (Rutherford scattering) of electrons. As we
saw back in Chapter 3, the cross section for Rutherford
scatter is a strong function of the atomic number Z
(hence the mass or the density, r) and the thickness, t,
of the specimen. Rutherford scattering in thin specimens
is strongly forward peaked. Therefore, if we form an
image with electrons scattered at low angles (&lt;�58),
mass-thickness contrast dominates (but it also competes
with Bragg-diffraction contrast). However, we&rsquo;ll also
see that at high angles (&gt;58), where Bragg scattering is
usually negligible, we can pick up low-intensity, scat-
tered beams. (The former is often referred to as coherent
and the latter as incoherent; we&rsquo;ll discuss these terms
later.) The intensity of these beams depends on atomic
number (Z) only. Thus we can also get so-called Z-
contrast, which contains elemental information like
that in BSE images in the SEM. We can obtain these
images with atomic resolution, particularly in a
DSTEM. It is also feasible to form BSE images in a
TEM but, because the specimen is thin, the number of
BSEs is so small that the images are noisy and of poor
quality, so no one does it. You shouldn&rsquo;t waste your
money buying a BSE detector (but a secondary-electron
detector can be very useful).
</p>
<p>Mass-thickness contrast is most important if you are
looking at non-crystalline materials, such as polymers
and it is the critical contrast mechanism for biological
scientists. But as we&rsquo;ll see, any variations in mass and
thickness will cause contrast. As you learned in Chapter
10, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to thin a bulk sample uni-
formly (although a FIB can get close) and so nearly all
real specimens will show some mass-thickness contrast.
In some cases this will be the only contrast you can see.
</p>
<p>In this section, we&rsquo;ll assume that there is no contri-
bution to the image from diffraction contrast. This is
automatically so if the specimen is amorphous. If the
specimen is crystalline, then remove the objective aper-
ture or use the ADF detector to minimize any diffrac-
tion contrast. You should still use an objective aperture
to enhance the mass-thickness contrast to minimize the
effects of lens aberrations. You&rsquo;ll still create BF and DF
images of amorphous materials.
</p>
<p>22.3.A Mechanism of Mass-Thickness Contrast
</p>
<p>The mechanism by which differences in mass and thick-
ness cause contrast is shown in Figure 22.4 and at this

<p>stage we&rsquo;ll talk about the process qualitatively. As elec-
trons go through the specimen, they are scattered off
axis by elastic nuclear interactions, i.e., Rutherford scat-
tering. You know two factors from Chapter 3
</p>
<p>&amp; The cross section for elastic scattering is a function
of Z.
</p>
<p>&amp; As the thickness of the specimen increases, there will
be more elastic scattering because the mean free path
remains fixed.
</p>
<p>So, using a very simple, qualitative argument you
would expect high-Z (i.e., high-mass) regions of a speci-
men to scatter more electrons than low-Z regions of the
same thickness. Similarly, thicker regions will scatter
more electrons than thinner regions of the same average
Z, all other factors being constant. Usually, mass-
thickness contrast images are interpreted in such a
purely qualitative fashion, although we&rsquo;ll see a little
later that it is possible to quantify the scattering
intensity. So, as you can see from Figure 22.4, for the
</p>
<p>case of a BF image, thicker and/or higher-mass areas
will appear darker than thinner and/or lower-mass
areas. The reverse will be true for a DF image.
</p>
<p>This is all you need to know for the simplest inter-
pretation of mass-thickness contrast images. Some-
times mass-thickness contrast is explained in terms of
different amounts of electron absorption within the
specimen and so you may come across the expression
&lsquo;absorption contrast.&rsquo; We think that this term is mis-
leading, because in thin foils the actual amount of
electron absorption is small; scattering outside the
aperture or the detector, not absorption within
the specimen, causes the contrast. For much the same
reason, we prefer not to use the term &lsquo;structure-factor
contrast&rsquo; that is sometimes used to describe this phe-
nomenon, since this implies a Bragg contribution,
which may or may not be present.
</p>
<p>However, you should be aware that if there are small
crystals of different atoms in a given foil thickness,
differences in their structure factor (F) from that of the
matrix will cause contrast changes, since I a |F|2. For
example, you can detect the presence of nanometer-size
clusters of Ag atoms in very thin foils of Al alloys in this
way. Conversely, an absence of atoms (e.g., a void) will
also scatter differently, although Fresnel contrast (see
Chapter 23) is a better way to detect voids and bubbles.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first look at a few images showing mass-
thickness contrast and see which TEM variables you
can control.
</p>
<p>22.3.B TEM Images
</p>
<p>Figure 22.5A is a TEMBF image of some latex particles
on an amorphous-carbon support film. Assuming the
latex is predominantly carbon, we have a constant Z
and varying t. So the latex particles are darker than the
support film since they are thicker. What you are basi-
cally seeing is a shadow projection image of the latex
particles. Because it is a projection image, you cannot
say that the particles are spheres (which in fact they are).
They could equally well be disks or cylinders. One way
to reveal the shape in a single image is to shadow-coat
the particles, i.e., evaporate a thin heavy metal (Au or
Au-Pd) coating at an oblique angle as shown in Figure
22.5B.The shape of the shadow reveals the true shape of
the particles.
</p>
<p>Shadowing introduces some mass contrast to what
was just a thickness-contrast image. If we assume the
Au-Pd film is very thin compared to the carbon support
film, then the contrast across the edge of the shadow is
predominantly mass contrast, due to the difference in
average Z of the Au-Pd and the carbon film. If the
spheres are small, there may also be an intensity change
across the latex spheres due to the preferential deposit of
Au-Pd on the side of the sphere towards the source of
the evaporated metal.

<p>It is an intriguing exercise to print Figure 22.5B in
reverse (or take a DF image) as shown in Figure 22.5C.
In this image, the latex spheres now appear to stand
proud of the surface, even though you&rsquo;re still viewing a
</p>
<p>two-dimensional projected image. Because the shadows
are now dark your brain interprets the picture as it
would a reflected-light image and endows it with a 3D
nature. While the interpretation in this case is correct, it
may not always be so. Once again we stress that you
must be careful when interpreting 2D images of 3D
specimens.
</p>
<p>In addition to the use of shadowing to enhance mass-
thickness contrast, it is common practice to stain differ-
ent areas of polymer and biological specimens with
heavy metals such as Os, Pb, and U. The stain leaves
the heavy metal in specific regions of the structure (e.g.,
at unsaturated C=C bonds in a polymer and cell walls
in biological tissue) and therefore these areas appear
darker in a BF image. Figure 22.6 shows a BF image
of a stained two-phase polymer. Since the specimen is of
constant thickness (it was ultramicrotomed) the image
shows mass contrast only.
</p>
<p>If you select a larger aperture, you allow more scat-
tered electrons to contribute to the BF image. So the
contrast between scattering and non-scattering areas is
lowered, although the overall image intensity increases.
If you choose a lower kV, both the scattering angle and
the cross section increase. Hence, more electrons will be
scattered outside a given aperture, hitting the dia-
phragm, and contrast will increase at the expense of
intensity. The decrease in intensity will be worse for
TEMs with a thermionic source because the gun bright-
ness decreases as the kV is lowered. Figure 22.7 shows
how a smaller aperture size results in improved contrast.

The TEM variables that affect the mass-thickness

<p>Of course, any decrease in intensity can be offset by
increased exposure times until specimen drift becomes
a limiting factor.
</p>
<p>Now for DF images, there isn&rsquo;t much more to be
said: the images will generally show regions of contrast
that are complementary to those seen in the BF (analo-
gous to the reversed contrast in Figure 22.5B and C) but
be prepared for exceptions (in Chapter 24). The overall
intensity of the DF image will be much lower than the
BF image (hence the relative terms &lsquo;dark&rsquo; and &lsquo;bright&rsquo;)
because the objective aperture will select only a small
fraction of the scattered electrons. It&rsquo;s easy to remember
that the BF image of a hole in your specimen will be
bright and a DF image will be dark. However, remem-
ber that the corollary of low intensity is high contrast
and DF images generally show better contrast.
</p>
<p>22.3.C STEM Images
</p>
<p>In a STEM you have more flexibility than in a TEM
because by varying L, you change the collection angle of
your detector and create, in effect, a variable objective
aperture. (We&rsquo;ll mention the old TEMs later where you
could do this and the SAD aperture was a triangle or a
square.) So you have more control over which electrons
contribute to the image. Even so, STEM BF images offer
littlemore thanTEMBF images.Generally, STEMimages
are noisier than TEM images (unless you&rsquo;ve got an FEG
STEM). Figure 22.8 shows a noisy STEM BF image of
the same two-phase polymer as shown in the TEM
image in Figure 22.6. The STEM images have generally
shown poorer resolution because, with good thin speci-
mens, the beam size dominates the resolution. To get
reasonable intensity in a scanning image in reasonable
time we have to use a large beam, as we discussed when
we compared scanning and static images back in
Chapter 9. Figure 22.9 shows the difference between
(A) TEM and (B) STEMBF images from a low-contrast
</p>
<p>specimen. The STEM image contrast has been enhanced
and is considerably greater than in the TEM image, but
the noise in the image is alsomore visible.However, if you
record your TEM image using a CCD camera, or digitize
the negative, you can enhance the contrast (see Chapter
31). A good way to do this is with one of the several kinds
of image processing software (see Chapter 31) as you can
see in Figure 22.9C.
</p>
<p>In a STEM DF image, the scattered electrons fall
onto the ADF detector. This gives rise to a funda-
mental difference between the TEM and STEM DF
modes
</p>
<p>&amp; DF TEM images are usually formed by permitting
only a fraction of the scattered electrons to enter the
objective aperture.
</p>
<p>&amp; STEM images are formed by collecting most of the
scattered electrons on the ADF detector.
</p>
<p>(A) (B)

</p>
<p>contrast, in a similar manner to lowering the kV.
</p>

</p>
<p>parison with the TEM image in Figure 22.6 shows that while the contrast

STEM in a TEM is now a routine high-resolution
technique.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Therefore, STEM ADF images are less noisy than
TEM DF images, as shown in Figure 22.10. Because
lenses aren&rsquo;t used to form the STEM image (although
they are used to form the probe), the ADF images don&rsquo;t
suffer aberrations, as would the equivalent off-axis
TEM DF image.
</p>
<p>STEMADF image contrast is greater than TEMDF
contrast: in STEM, L can be adjusted to maximize the
ratio of the number of scattered electrons hitting the
detector to the number of electrons going through the
hole in themiddle of the detector. You can thus improve
the contrast quite easily, just by watching the computer
screen and adjusting L.
</p>
<p>However, as you can see fromFigure 22.10, while the
TEMDF image shows poorer contrast and is noisier, it
still shows better resolution. Thermionic-source STEM
images generally only show better resolution than TEM
images when thick specimens are being imaged, because
the chromatic aberration effects from thicker specimens
do not affect the STEM images. If contrast is more
important than resolution, then STEM is more useful.
Indeed, in a STEM, you can study unstained polymer
specimens which would show negligible contrast in a
TEM.
</p>
<p>STEM imaging is also useful if your specimen is beam
sensitive, e.g., some polymers. A scanning beam lets you
precisely control the irradiated region of the specimen,
so it&rsquo;s a form of low-dose microscopy (see Section 4.6).
You&rsquo;ll lose some image resolution unless you have
access to a FEG STEM.
</p>
<p>The comparison we&rsquo;ve made of TEM and STEM
images here is qualitative, but there have been many
quantitative comparisons of STEM and TEM contrast,
particularly for biological specimens. When STEMs were
first introduced in the 1970s, the absence of chromatic
aberration effects led to prophesies that STEM image
resolution would invariably be better than TEM; there
were even predictions of the end of classic TEM imaging!
This hasn&rsquo;t happened because, as we&rsquo;ll see, there is more
than just the chromatic aberration factor that governs the
image quality, particularly for crystalline specimens. In
summary, then, there are occasions when you might
want to use STEM mass-thickness contrast images
</p>
<p>&amp; The specimen is so thick that chromatic aberration
limits the TEM resolution.
</p>
<p>&amp; The specimen is beam-sensitive.
&amp; The specimen has inherently low contrast in TEM
and you can&rsquo;t digitize your TEM image or negative.
</p>
<p>&amp; Your specimen is ideally suited for HRTEM by Z-
contrast imaging.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll examine the latter in the next section and in
Chapter 28, and in much more detail in the companion
text.
</p>
<p>This said, be aware that STEM in the TEM has greatly
improved sincemanyof thecomparisonstudieswere carried
out. Second, low-dose techniques in TEM will improve in
the future.Third, youmustbe able todigitize your negatives
now&mdash;negatives will be obsolete in the near future.

<p>22.3.D Specimens Showing Mass-Thickness
Contrast
</p>
<p>Mass-thickness is the primary contrast source in amor-
phous materials, which is why we&rsquo;ve illustrated this
chapter mainly with polymer specimens. Replicas also
display thickness contrast (see Figure 22.11A). Remem-
ber from Chapter 10 that replicas recreate the specimen
topography, e.g., for a fracture surface. The amorphous-
carbon replica can be as prepared (without shadowing)
(Figure 22.11A) or shadowed (Figure 22.11B). The
uneven metal shadowing increases the mass contrast
and thus accentuates the topography, as for the latex
particles in Figure 22.3. An extraction replica (Figure
22.11C) or a collection of particles dispersed on a sup-
port film will also show mass-thickness contrast; shad-
owing could be useful to reveal the shape of these
particles too. If the particles are crystalline there will
also be a component of diffraction contrast. Don&rsquo;t shad-
ow if you want to do elemental analysis of the particles.

</p>
<p>in BF the STEM image shows higher contrast but lower resolution. Also,
</p>
<p>the ADF aperture collects more signal than the TEM objective aperture
</p>
<p>so the STEM image is less noisy.
</p>
<p>CONTRAST IN STEM
Remember, you can always increase the contrast in
the STEM image by adjusting the signal-processing
controls, such as the detector gain and black level and
the contrast and brightness controls on the computer
screen; such options aren&rsquo;t available for analog TEM
images.

<p>DP AND STEM
The STEM must be well aligned so the DP expands
and contracts on axis.

<p>22.3.E Quantitative Mass-Thickness Contrast
</p>
<p>Because mass-thickness contrast is governed by Ruther-
ford scattering, we can use the equations given back in
Chapter 3 to predict the effect of Z and t on the scatter-
ing angle, y, and the effect of kV on the cross section.
We assume that the atoms scatter independently. (We
then say that the scattering is truly incoherent.) This is
actually not really the case, since even DPs from amor-
phous specimens show diffuse rings rather than uniform
intensity (Figure 2.13A). Nevertheless, we&rsquo;ll still assume
incoherent scattering.
</p>
<p>As we stated at the start of this chapter, the contrast
C is given by DI/I and it can be shown that a change in
thickness, Dt, at constant atomic number Z creates
contrast
</p>
<p>DI
</p>
<p>I
&frac14; 1� e�QDt (22:2)
</p>
<p>Q is the total elastic scattering cross section. So C
becomes QDt for QDt&lt; 1. If 5% is the minimum con-
trast we can see, then the minimum Dt that we can see is

(22:3)
</p>
<p>whereA is the atomic weight, N0 is Avogadro&rsquo;s number,
s is the single-atom scattering cross section, and r is the
density.
</p>
<p>A similar argument can be made if there is a DZ (in
which case s or r changes). So, if we want to calculate
the contrast, we need to know s. As we&rsquo;ve seen in
equation 3.8, for low-angle scattering, the differential
Rutherford cross section is equal to f(y)2 where f(y) is
the atomic scattering factor, given by equation 3.9

<p>Z� fx&eth; &THORN; (22:4)
</p>
<p>The Z term represents the Rutherford scattering. For
unscreened Rutherford scattering (where we ignore the
effects of the electron cloud),s is therefore proportional
to Z2. This unscreened behavior is quite a good approx-
imation for electrons scattered through angles (remem-
ber, we mean semiangles when we talk about scattering)
above �58 (e.g., for Cu) although it is dependent on E0
and Z. At lower angles, scattering becomes increasingly
screened (less dependent on Z), and more dominated by
inelastic scattering and diffraction. There is no precise
angle which we use to define the transition from low- to
high-angle scatter but the effect of screening effectively
disappears at angles &gt;y0, the screening parameter,
defined back in equation 3.4.
</p>
<p>We can use the atomic scattering factor (equation 22.4)
to determine the probability that an electron will be
scattered through greater than a given angle. To do
this, we integrate f y&eth; &THORN;j j2 from an angle b (defined by
the angle of collection of the objective aperture) to
infinity. Thus

see directly the effect of Z and kV on electron scatter
and hence on contrast. As we&rsquo;ve already described,
higher-Z specimens scatter more while lowering E0
increases scattering. The effect of thickness is deduced

<p>from the mean free path for elastic scatter, l (which is
inversely proportional to s). So, thicker specimens scat-
ter more.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that n0 electrons are incident on the
specimen and dn electrons are scattered through an
angle &gt;b. Then, from equation 22.6, ignoring any
inelastic scattering (which isn&rsquo;t really reasonable, but
we&rsquo;ll do it to simplify matters), the reduction in the
number of electrons going through the objective aper-
ture to form the BF image is given by

<p>n
&frac14; �Ns b&eth; &THORN;dx (22:7)
</p>
<p>where N=N0/A and N0 is Avogadro&rsquo;s number, s(b) is
given by equation 22.6, and x = rt. So this expression
gives the dependence of the contrast on Z and t. If we
integrate
</p>
<p>ln n &frac14; �Nsx&thorn; ln n0 (22:8)
</p>
<p>and if we rearrange this expression
</p>
<p>n &frac14; n0e
�Nsx (22:9)
</p>
<p>which describes the exponential decrease in the number
of scattered electrons (n) as the specimenmass-thickness
(x = rt) increases.
</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll have gathered, this equation is something
of an approximation but it does give you a feel for the
factors that controlmass-thickness contrast. For a given
specimen, the variables are local changes in Z and t;
within the microscope, the variables are b and E0, which
you can control to change the contrast, as we saw in
Figure 22.7.
</p>
<p>In principle, you could use these equations and equa-
tion 22.1 to calculate the expected contrast arising from
differences inZ or t and see if they were detectable at the
5% contrast level. In practice, however, image-contrast
calculations are not carried out for simple mass-thick-
ness contrast in materials specimens.
</p>
<p>22.4 Z-CONTRAST
</p>
<p>Z-contrast is the name given to a high-resolution
(atomic), mass-thickness (Z), imaging technique. We&rsquo;ll
talk about it here because it represents the limit of mass-
thickness contrast where detectable scattering arises
from single atoms or column of atoms.
</p>
<p>Back in the 1970s, early FEG STEMs demonstrated
the remarkable capability of imaging single heavy atoms
(e.g., Pt and U) on low-Z substrates as shown in Figure
22.12. These images were formed by the ADF detector
collecting low-angle elastically scattered electrons only.
Single atoms scatter incoherently and the image inten-
sity is the sum of the individual atomic scattering
</p>
<p>contributions. There was sometimes a problem with
thickness changes in the substrate and contributions to
the ADF signal from inelastically scattered electrons.
This problemwas overcome by dividing the digital ADF
signal by the inelastic (energy-loss) signal from the
EELS system. A drawback to this technique is that
diffraction contrast (e.g., from a crystalline substrate)
is preserved in the low-angle EELS signal, which can
confuse the image interpretation. In Figure 22.12, the
large bright regions arise from the Al2O3 substrate dif-
fracting onto the ADF detector, obscuring the scatter
from the Pt atoms.
</p>
<p>Because of Bragg scattering, this early approach to
Z-contrast was not suited to the study of crystalline
specimens. Since the normal ADF detector will always
collect some Bragg electrons, it was necessary to design
an ADF detector with a very large central aperture.
Z-contrast images could then be formed from thin crys-
tals (Figure 22.13). You can decrease the camera length
with the post-specimen lenses to ensure that the Bragg
electrons (including any HOLZ scatter) don&rsquo;t hit the
detector. Thus only the electrons scattered through
very high angles contribute to the image.
</p>
<p>Bragg effects are avoided if the HAADF detector
only gathers electrons scattered through an angle of&gt;50
mrad (�38). Remember that cooling your specimen has
the effect of increasing coherent HOLZ scatter, so don&rsquo;t
cool it unless you must. Electron channeling effects

<p>HAADF
The detector is called a high-angle ADF or HAADF
detector.Z-contrast images are also termed HAADF
images. The outer diameter of the FischioneHAADF
detector is 28 mm; the inner diameter is 4 mm.

<p>remain at high scattering angles, so imaging away from
strong two-beam conditions and closer to zone-axis
orientations is wise.
</p>
<p>So, what do these Z-contrast images of crystals look
like? Figure 22.14 shows a TEM BF image of Bi-
implanted Si and below is a Z-contrast image. In the
TEM BF image, formed from the direct beam, defects
associated with the Bi implant are shown (we&rsquo;ll talk
about such diffraction contrast from defects in Chapter
26) but otherwise there is no contrast associatedwith the
Bi. In the Z-contrast image the Bi-implanted area is
bright, but note that defect contrast isn&rsquo;t preserved in
this image. You can relate the intensity differences in
Figure 22.14 to an absolute measure of the Bi concen-
tration. To do this you need to choose a suitable elastic
scattering cross section. The contrast is related directly
to the cross section for elastic scatter by the matrix (sA)
and the alloying or dopant element (sB)

</p>
<p>where cB is the atomic concentration of the alloying
element and FB is the fraction of the alloying element
that substitutes for matrix atoms. The intensity can be
quantified to an absolute accuracy of better than
�20%.
</p>
<p>In an FEG with probe sizes of &lt;0.3 nm, Z-contrast
image resolution of close to the probe diameter is
possible. Figure 22.15A shows a high-resolution
</p>
<p>phase-contrast TEM image of Ge on Si with an amor-
phous SiO2 surface layer. The Si and Ge are indistin-
guishable by phase contrast. In Figure 22.15B, which
is a STEM Z-contrast image of the same region, the
higher-Z Ge crystal region is clearly visible and the
lower-Z SiO2 layer appears very dark. The atomic
structures of the Si and Ge crystals are visible in
both phase-contrast and Z-contrast images, although
the Z-contrast image is noisier. Phase-contrast TEM
images can show similar Z-contrast effects, as we&rsquo;ll
detail in Chapter 28. Figure 22.15C shows a model of
a grain boundary superimposed on a Z-contrast image
which has been refined and processed to reduce the
noise via a maximum-entropy approach. You can
easily see atomic-level detail.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 28 that interpretation of atomic-
resolution phase-contrast images requires knowledge of
t and Df. Some microscopists claim that Z contrast will
become the principal method of high-resolution imag-
ing in the future as more FEG STEMs become avail-
able; others strongly disagree!

<p>We can think of the image in Figure 22.15B as a
direct map of the f(y) variation in the specimen. In that
respect, it is similar to an X-ray map showing the dis-
tribution of a certain element.
</p>
<p>So why do we need a STEM forZ-contrast imaging?
We are constrained in TEM if we use an analog screen
rather than a digital detector to form the image. Never-
theless, we can do Z-contrast imaging in a TEM but we
have to create electron-optical conditions which are
equivalent to those used in STEM. So the beam-conver-
gence angle in TEM must equal the collection angle of
the HAADF detector. This is an example of the so-
called &lsquo;principle of reciprocity&rsquo; which we&rsquo;ll discuss in
more detail in the next section. To converge the TEM
beam to the required angular range, we use so-called
&lsquo;hollow-cone&rsquo; illumination, which requires an annular
C2 aperture. However, the highest incidence angles pos-
sible in hollow-cone illumination are typically a few
mrad rather than the 50&ndash;150mrad (up to �98) collected
by the STEM HAADF detector. So TEM Z-contrast
images are not equivalent to STEM and will always
contain some diffraction contrast from crystalline speci-
mens. This leads us into the topic of diffraction contrast,
which is the other form of amplitude contrast we see in
TEM images.
</p>
<p>The future (see Section 39.10): Z-contrast images
can be collected at the same time and from the same
location as the EELS data. There is no other combina-
tion of techniques to match this, if it gives the informa-
tion you need.
</p>
<p>22.5 TEM DIFFRACTION CONTRAST
</p>
<p>Bragg diffraction, as we discussed in Part 2, is controlled
by the crystal structure and orientation of the specimen.
We can use this diffraction to create contrast in TEM
images. Diffraction contrast is simply a special form of
amplitude contrast where the scattering occurs at spe-
cial (Bragg) angles. We&rsquo;ve just seen how incoherent
elastic scattering causes mass-thickness contrast. Now
we&rsquo;ll see how coherent elastic scattering produces dif-
fraction contrast. As you know, crystalline specimens
usually give a single-crystal DP, such as in Figure 22.2.
So, as for mass-thickness contrast, we can form BF
images by placing the objective aperture around the
direct beam (Figure 22.2A) and DF images by selecting
any of the diffracted beams (Figure 22.2B). Remember
that the incident electrons must be parallel in order to
give sharp diffraction spots and strong diffraction con-
trast. So, if you can, underfocus C2 to spread the beam.
</p>
<p>22.5.A Two-Beam Conditions
</p>
<p>There is one major difference between forming images
to show mass-thickness contrast or diffraction contrast.
We can use any scattered electrons to form a DF image
showing mass-thickness contrast. However, to get good
strong diffraction contrast in both BF and DF images

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>we tilt the specimen to two-beam conditions, in which
only one diffracted beam is strong. Of course, the direct
beam is the other strong spot in the pattern.
</p>
<p>Remember: the electrons in the strongly excited hkl
beam have been diffracted by a specific set of hkl planes
and so the area that appears bright in the DF image is
the area where the hkl planes are at the Bragg condition.
Hence the DF image contains specific orientation infor-
mation, not just general scattering information, as is the
case for mass-thickness contrast.
</p>
<p>We can tilt the specimen to set up several different
two-beam conditions. Figure 22.16A includes a zone-
axis DP from a single-crystal specimen in which the
beam direction is [011]. The surrounding patterns are a
series of two-beam conditions in which the specimen has
been tilted slightly so that different hkl spots are
strongly excited in each pattern. We can form DF
images from each strongly diffracted beam after tilting
the specimen, and each will give a different image.
</p>
<p>As you can see in Figure 22.16B and C, the BF and
DF images show complementary contrast under two-
beam conditions. We&rsquo;ll explain the image contrast in
detail in Chapter 23. Obviously, to set up a series of
two-beam conditions, we need precise tilt control, which
explains why a double-tilt eucentric holder is the holder
of choice for viewing crystalline specimens.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see in the following chapters that two-beam
conditions are not only necessary for good contrast but
they also greatly simplify interpretation of the images.
This is why we emphasized two-beam theory in our
discussion of diffraction in Part 2.
</p>
<p>22.5.B Setting the Deviation Parameter, s
</p>
<p>Setting up two-beam conditions is very simple. While
looking at the DP, tilt around until only one diffracted
beam is strong, as in Figure 22.16. As you can see, the
other diffracted beams don&rsquo;t disappear because of the
relaxation of the Bragg conditions, but they can be
made relatively faint. Now if you just do as we&rsquo;ve
described, the contrast might still not be the best. For
reasons we&rsquo;ll discuss in detail in the next chapter, to get
the best contrast from defects, your specimen shouldn&rsquo;t
be exactly at the Bragg condition (s=0) as in Figure
22.17A. Tilt your specimen close to the Bragg condition
but make s small and positive. (The excess hkl Kikuchi
line, just outside the hkl spot; go back and check the text
for Figures 19.10 and 19.11.) This will give you the best
</p>
<p>possible strong-beam image contrast as in Figure
22.17B. If you tilt the specimen slightly, so s increases
further as shown in Figure 22.17C, the defect images
become narrower but the contrast is reduced.
</p>
<p>22.5.C Setting Up a Two-Beam CDF Image
</p>
<p>We described the basic mechanism of forming BF and
DF images back in Chapter 9 (Figure 9.14A). To pro-
duce the best BF diffraction contrast, tilt to the desired
two-beam condition as in Figure 22.18A, and insert the
objective aperture on axis as in Figure 22.2A. A two-
beam CDF image is not quite as simple. You might
think it involves just tilting the incident beam so the
strong hkl reflection moves onto the optic axis. If you
do that, you&rsquo;ll find that the hkl reflection becomes
weaker as you move it onto the axis and the 3h3k3l
reflection becomes strong, as shown in Figure 22.18B.
What you&rsquo;ve just done is in fact set up a weak-beam
image condition, which we&rsquo;ll discuss in Chapter 27. To
set up a strong-beam CDF image, tilt in the �h�k�l reflection
which was initially weak, and it becomes strong as it
moves on axis, as shown in Figure 22.18C. The CDF
technique is absolutely crucial for obtaining and inter-
preting diffraction-contrast images, so we will take you
through it in detail
</p>
<p>&amp; Look at the SADP and tilt the specimen until the
desired hkl reflection is strong. Make sure the inci-
dent beam is well underfocused.
</p>
<p>&amp; Now tilt the specimen until the �h�k�l reflection is
strong: hkl will now be weak.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use the DF tilt controls to move the 000 reflection
towards the strong �h�k�l reflection. The weak hkl
reflection will move towards the optic axis and
become strong.
</p>
<p>&amp; When hkl is close to the axis, switch off the DF
deflectors, insert and carefully center the objective
aperture around 000.
</p>
<p>&amp; Switch the DF tilt coils on and off while looking
through the binoculars. Check that the hkl and 000
reflections appear in the same position. Make fine
adjustments to the DF coils until you can see no shift
between 000 and hkl when the deflectors are off and
on, respectively.
</p>
<p>&amp; Switch to image mode. If necessary, condense the
beam slightly with C2 until you can see the CDF
image. If you can&rsquo;t see an image, either the hkl reflec-
tion is too weak (unlikely) or your tilt coils are mis-
aligned (common). In the latter case, realign the coils
(see the manufacturer&rsquo;s handbook).
</p>
<p>TWO-BEAM CONDITIONS
If you&rsquo;re working with crystalline materials, you&rsquo;ll
spend a lot of time tilting the specimen to set up
different two-beam conditions.
</p>
<p>USE s&gt;0
Never form strong-beam images with s negative; it&rsquo;s
easier to see the defects when s&gt;0.

<p>Now go back and study Figure 9.14C carefully.
You&rsquo;ll see that the beam was tilted through an angle
2yB to bring the weak beam in Figure 9.14B onto the
optic axis.
</p>
<p>Notice that �g is excited in the DF condition; g was
excited in the BF condition. If you want to form a CDF
image with g excited, you must tilt the beam and the
specimen. Alternatively, just displace the aperture but
be cautious.
</p>
<p>22.5.D Relationship Between the Image and the
Diffraction Pattern
</p>
<p>From what we&rsquo;ve just described, there is clearly an imp-
ortant relationship between the DP and a diffraction-
</p>
<p>contrast image. If we change the DP in any way,
the contrast in the image will change. So it is critical to
relate the DP to the image. We need to indicate the
direction of the g vector in the image. To relate the two,
remember that you may have to calibrate the rotation
between the image and the DP if, whenever you change
magnification, your image rotates but your DP does not.
We described this calibration in Section 9.6.C. You
should usually show the g vector in any BF or DF two-
beam, diffraction-contrast image after correcting for any
rotation between the image and the DP. Remember: you
should always check the calibration of any microscope,
especially a TEM, and be careful with possible 1808
rotations.
</p>
<p>We will expand on diffraction contrast in far more
detail in the subsequent chapters, making use of the fun-
damental operational principles we have just described.
</p>
<p>22.6 STEM DIFFRACTION CONTRAST
</p>
<p>The principle of forming BF andDF images in STEM is
just the same as for mass-thickness contrast; i.e., use the
BF detector to pick up the direct beam and the ADF

<p>detector to pick up the diffracted beams. To preserve
two-beam conditions, the ADF detector must only pick
up one strong diffracted beam and this can be ensured
by inserting the objective aperture and selecting only
one diffracted beam. Alternatively, the DP could be
displaced so the chosen hkl reflection falls on the BF
detector. Either way the computer screen will display a
DF image.
</p>
<p>However, the diffraction contrast observed in the
STEM image will generally be much poorer than TEM
contrast; the normal STEM operating conditions are
not equivalent to the TEM conditions that ensure
strong diffraction contrast. To understand the contrast
in STEM images you need to know the beam conver-
gence and detector collection angles. It&rsquo;s rare in fact that
you&rsquo;ll need to do this, but we showed you how to deter-
mine the beam convergence angle back in Section 5.5.
To calculate the collection angle, you need to carry out a
similar exercise as we use to determine the EELS spec-
trometer collection angle in Section 37.4.
</p>
<p>Remember, there are three conditions that must be
fulfilled for strong contrast in your image
</p>
<p>&amp; The incident beam must be coherent, i.e., the con-
vergence angle must be very small.
</p>
<p>&amp; The specimen must be tilted to a two-beam
condition.
</p>
<p>&amp; Only the direct beam or the one strong diffracted
beam must be collected by the objective aperture.
</p>
<p>This condition is shown schematically in Figure 22.19A.
We define the TEM convergence angle as aT and the
objective aperture collection angle as bT. In a STEM, the
equivalent angles are the beam convergence angle aS and
the STEM detector collection angle bS as shown in Figure
22.19B. Therefore, we have identical operating conditions if

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Now it should be immediately clear that we can&rsquo;t get
such equivalence in a STEM because the convergence
angle of the beam is very much greater than in a TEM
(since in STEM we deliberately create a convergent
rather than a parallel beam). However, there is a way
around this dilemma and it depends on a theorem that is
often used in electron optics called the principle of reci-
procity. In essence this principle says that so long as the
electron ray paths contain equivalent angles (of conver-
gence and collection) at some point in the electron opti-
cal system, the image contrast will be identical.
</p>
<p>In other words, while the conditions in equations
22.11 can&rsquo;t be fulfilled, we can create conditions such that
</p>
<p>aS &frac14; bT (22:12a)
</p>
<p>aT &frac14; bS (22:12b)
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances the electrons in TEM and
STEM do see equivalent angular constraints, although
not at the equivalent points of convergence and collection.
</p>
<p>&amp; Since the objective-aperture collection angle in TEM
is about equal to the convergence angle in STEM,
the first of this pair of equations is easily satisfied.
</p>
<p>&amp; To satisfy the second pair, we have to make a very
small STEM collection angle bS.
</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t simply increase aT, because we must keep a
parallel beam to get good TEM diffraction contrast and
making the beam non-parallel (large aT) destroys the
contrast.
</p>
<p>There is an obvious drawback tomaking bS small. The
signal falling on the STEM detector becomes very small
and the STEM image becomes noisy. So STEM diffrac-
tion-contrast images become noisier as we attempt to
increase the amount of diffraction contrast, as in Figure
22.20. (See Chapter 24 for an explanation of the contrast
(bend contours) in this figure.) Having an FEG helps to
offset this increase in noise, but in general, STEM diffrac-
tion-contrast images (in both BF and DF) compare so
unfavorably with TEM images (see Figure 22.20C) that,
while they may be useful if you&rsquo;re performing analysis,
they are rarely used to show diffraction-contrast images of
crystal defects. This is solely the domain of TEM, as we&rsquo;ll
discuss in detail in the next few chapters.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Mass-thickness contrast and diffraction contrast are two forms of amplitude contrast. Both
arise because the specimen scatters electrons. The operational procedures to produce BF
and DF images are identical. Interpretation of mass-thickness contrast is generally simpler
than interpretation of diffraction contrast. In fact, the interpretation of diffraction contrast
is sufficiently complex that we need to devote several subsequent chapters to the various
forms arising in perfect and imperfect crystals.
</p>
<p>We can summarize the characteristics of mass-thickness contrast
</p>
<p>&amp; Areas of greater Z and/or t scatter electrons more strongly (in total), and therefore appear
darker in BF images and brighter inDF images. The contrast can be quantified if necessary.
</p>
<p>&amp; TEM mass-thickness contrast images are better quality (lower noise and higher resolu-
tion) than STEM images, but digital STEM images can be processed to show higher
contrast than analog TEM images.
</p>
<p>&amp; STEM mass-thickness contrast images are most useful for thick and/or beam-sensitive
specimens.
</p>
<p>&amp; Z-contrast (HAADF) images can show atomic-level resolution.
</p>
<p>We can summarize the characteristics of diffraction contrast
</p>
<p>&amp; Diffraction contrast arises when the electrons are Bragg scattered.
&amp; To form a diffraction-contrast image in TEM, the objective aperture selects one Bragg-
scattered beam. Often, the STEM detectors gather several Bragg beams which reduce
diffraction contrast.
</p>
<p>&amp; Diffraction-contrast images in TEM always show better contrast than in STEM images,
which are always noisier and almost never used.
</p>
<p>Some of the statements made in the First Edition are not now valid! FEGs are now
common. The original DSTEMwas discontinued in�1985; but DSTEMs are nowmade by
Hitachi, JEOL, andNion.Cs correctors are becomingmore available.Modern TEMs all use
digital recording. Z-contrast imaging has greatly improved on commercial machines and
rivals CTEM in many applications.

<p>Phase-Contrast Images
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>We see phase contrast any time we have more than one beam contributing to the image. In
fact, whenever we say &lsquo;&lsquo;fringes,&rsquo;&rsquo; we are essentially referring to a phase-contrast phenomenon.
Although we often distinguish phase and diffraction contrast, this distinction is generally
artificial. For example, in Chapters 24 and 25, we will examine thickness fringes and stacking-
fault fringes; both types of contrast result from interference of waves so both are phase-
contrast images although we usually think of them as two-beam, diffraction-contrast images.
</p>
<p>Phase-contrast imaging is often thought to be synonymous with high-resolution TEM.
In fact, phase contrast appears in most TEM images even at relatively low magnifications.
We will draw your attention to its role in the formation of moiré patterns and Fresnel
contrast at defects. This Fresnel contrast has the same origin as the Fresnel fringes that we
used in Chapter 9 to correct the astigmatism of the objective lens.
</p>
<p>As withmany of the topics we&rsquo;ve discussed, we can approach the problem at several different
levels. One danger is that you may be tempted to use one of the prepackaged simulation
programs to predict phase-contrast images, without first learning about the limitations of such
packages. The second danger is that with a modern HRTEM you can very easily obtain phase-
contrast images that show great detail without you fully knowing/understanding the conditions
used to obtain the image. This may impress your advisor but you should know better.
</p>
<p>We will begin this chapter by discussing some simple approaches to understanding
phase-contrast effects as they relate to lattice-fringe imaging.
</p>
<p>23.1 INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>Contrast in TEM images can arise due to the differences in
the phase of the electron waves scattered through a thin
specimen. This contrast mechanism can be difficult to
interpret because it is very sensitive to many factors: the
appearance of the image varies with small changes in the
thickness, orientation, or scattering factor of the specimen,
and variations in the focus or astigmatism of the objective
lens. However, its sensitivity is the reason phase contrast
can be exploited to image the atomic structure of thin
specimens. Of course this also requires a TEM with suffi-
cient resolution to detect contrast variations at atomic
dimensions and the proper control of instrument param-
eters that affect the phases of the electrons passing through
the specimen and the lenses. If you know what you are
doing, the procedures can be straightforward; the level of
operator skill that is necessary to obtain such images can
be acquired with practice; the challenge is in getting
enough practice and knowing when you have!
</p>
<p>The most obvious distinction between phase-contrast
imaging and other forms of TEM imaging is the number
</p>
<p>of beams collected by the objective aperture or an elec-
tron detector. As described in the previous chapters, a BF
or DF image requires that we select a single beam using
the objective aperture. A phase-contrast image requires
the selection ofmore than one beam. In general, the more
beams collected, the higher the resolution of the image.
However, we will see that there are reasons why some
beams, which are apparently admitted through the aper-
ture, might not contribute to the image. The details of
this process depend on the performance of the electron-
optical system. We&rsquo;ll first examine the theory and then
consider the practical aspects.
</p>
<p>23.2 THE ORIGIN OF LATTICE FRINGES
</p>
<p>We can understand the origin of lattice fringes by extend-
ing the analysis of Chapter 13 to allow the two beams, 0
and g, to interfere; i.e., use the objective aperture to select
only two beams. We begin by rewriting equation 13.5
</p>
<p>c &frac14; f0 z&eth; &THORN; exp 2pi kI � r&eth; &THORN; &thorn; fg z&eth; &THORN; exp 2pikD � r&eth; &THORN; (23:1)
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>where we know
</p>
<p>kD &frac14; kI &thorn; g&thorn; sg &frac14; kI &thorn; g0 (23:2)
We are thus using a two-beam approximation but
allowing sg to be non-zero. Now we will make some
simple substitutions setting f0(z)=A and take e
</p>
<p>2pikI.r
</p>
<p>out as a factor. We will also represent the expression for
fg from equation 13.5 as
</p>
<p>fg &frac14; B exp id (23:3)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>B &frac14; p
xg
</p>
<p>sinptseff
</p>
<p>pseff
(23:4)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>d &frac14; p
2
� ptseff (23:5)
</p>
<p>The p/2 in the expression for d takes care of i in equation
13.5 and we&rsquo;ll pretend that the specimen is so thin that we
can replace seff by s. Thus equation 23.1 becomes
</p>
<p>c &frac14; exp 2pikI � r&eth; &THORN; A&thorn; B exp i 2pg0 � r&thorn; d&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � (23:6)
</p>
<p>The intensity can then be expressed as
</p>
<p>I &frac14; A2 &thorn; B2 &thorn; AB exp i 2pg0 � r&thorn; d&eth; &THORN; &thorn; exp�i 2pg0 � r&thorn; d&eth; &THORN;&frac12; �
(23:7)
</p>
<p>I &frac14; A2 &thorn; B2 &thorn; 2AB cos 2pg0 � r&thorn; d&eth; &THORN; (23:8)
</p>
<p>Now g0 is effectively perpendicular to the beam so we&rsquo;ll
set it parallel to x and replace d giving
</p>
<p>I &frac14; A2 &thorn; B2 � 2AB sin 2pg0x� pst&eth; &THORN; (23:9)
</p>
<p>Therefore, the intensity is a sinusoidal oscillation nor-
mal to g0, with a periodicity that depends on s and t.
(Note that g and s are not bold in equation 23.9 because
they represent the magnitude of the vectors, not the
vectors themselves.) We can, with care, relate these
fringes to the spacing of the lattice planes normal to g0.
Although we have obtained this equation using a very
simple model, it gives us some useful insight, which will
also be helpful when we talk about many-beam images
in Chapter 28.
</p>
<p>The intensity varies sinusoidally with different
periodicities for different values of g0. This model will
be equally valid even if the incident beam is tilted
slightly off the optic axis.
</p>
<p>23.3 SOME PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF
LATTICE FRINGES
</p>
<p>23.3.A If s = 0
</p>
<p>If we just have 0 and g in the objective aperture and we
then set s = 0 for reflection G (so g0= g), we will see
fringes in the image (Figure 23.1A) which have a peri-
odicity of 1/g in the x direction; i.e., the fringe periodic-
ity is the same as the spacing of the planes which give rise
to g. This result holds wherever s = 0 no matter how 0
and g are located relative to the optic axis, even if the
diffracting planes are not parallel to the optic axis.
</p>
<p>Figure 23.1B shows the ideal geometry for produc-
ing images like Figure 23.1A. It is called the &lsquo;tilted-beam
condition&rsquo; and it means that the planes of interest lie
parallel to the optic axis. If we use the geometry shown
in Figure 23.1B we have s=0 and the planes are parallel
to the optic axis but not parallel to the incident beam.
Therefore the fringes cannot correspond directly to the
individual planes. If we use the on-axis geometry shown
in Figure 23.1C, the planes are viewed edge on, but s 6&frac14; 0
for reflection G; so we must also consider reflection &ndash;G.
</p>
<p>23.3.B If s &bdquo; 0
</p>
<p>If the specimen is not exactly flat, then s will vary across
the image; even if you set s= 0 in the DP, it will not be

<p>axis; g is normal to the fringes. (B) Ideal diffraction geometry to produce
</p>
<p>tilted-beam fringes. (C) On-axis, three-beam geometry.
</p>
<p>DELOCALIZATION
This simple analysis shows that the location of a
fringe does not necessarily correspond to the location
of a lattice plane.
</p>
<p>CONFUSING
The trouble is that the fringes look so like atomic
planes that we can be easily misled into thinking that
they are atomic planes.
</p>

<p>zero everywhere. If s is not zero, then the fringes will
shift by an amount which depends on both the magni-
tude of s and the value of t, but the periodicity will not
change noticeably.We expect this s dependence to affect
the image when the foil bends slightly, as is often the
case for thin specimens. We also expect to see thickness
variations in many-beam images, since s may be non-
zero for all of the beams; s may also vary from beam to
beam.
</p>
<p>23.4 ON-AXIS LATTICE-FRINGE IMAGING
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just seen that two beams can interfere to give an
image with a periodicity related to |Dg|�1. Since one
beam is the direct beam, |Dg|�1 is just d, the interplanar
spacing corresponding to g. If you align your beam
parallel to a low-index zone axis then you&rsquo;ll see fringes
running in different directions; these fringes in the image
must correspond to an array of spots in the DP. The
spacings of the spots may be inversely related to the
lattice spacings, as shown in Figure 23.2 which extends
Figure 23.1 to the many-beam case. In general, this
array of spots bears no direct relationship to the position
of atoms in the crystal.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see more on this when we discuss image simu-
lation in Chapter 30. In case you are in doubt, compare
the beautiful image shown in Figure 23.3A with the
projected structure of Si in Figure 23.3B. The Si dumb-
bells are a pair of atoms which are 1.4 Å apart in this
projection of the structure. The aperture used to form the
image included 13 reflections, as shown in Figure 23.3C.
The difficulty is that in the image, the spots in the dumb-
bell image are really only 1.3 Å apart but the point reso-
lution of the TEMwas only�2.5 Å. You can see from the

<p>structure that the real dumbbell spacing corresponds to
the (004) plane spacing, but the 004 reflection was not
used to form the image. The explanation was given by
Krivanek andRez; the dumbbells in the image are caused
by the crossing {113} fringes&mdash;so the contrast is an arti-
fact, if we are interested in the real structure.
</p>
<p>The lesson is: we only knew the image did not corre-
spond to the structure because we knew the structure!
Taking this example as your guide, consider the case
where a defect is present in an image where the perfect
crystal spots are all in the &lsquo;correct&rsquo; position. Could you
still be certain that the detail in the image close to the
defect gives you a true picture of the location of the
atoms close to the defect? The answer is, of course, &lsquo;&lsquo;no.&rsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>On-axis lattice-fringe images are perhaps best used
as a measure of the local crystal structure and orienta-
tion. The exception, as we&rsquo;ll see in the next chapter, is
when these images can only be interpreted using exten-
sive computer simulation. Figure 23.4 illustrates some
typical applications of the imaging mode, where we can
learn a lot about our material by intuitive interpretation
</p>
<p>without the need for simulating their images. Our guess
is that at least 99% of all lattice-fringe images are inter-
preted without using image simulation.
</p>
<p>Figure 23.4A shows the interface between a spinel par-
ticle and an olivinematrix; Figure 23.4B shows howwe can
locate dislocations at a heterojunction; Figure 23.4C shows
the atomic-scale faceting of a grain boundary in Ge; and
Figure 23.4D illustrates the faceting of a surface.
</p>
<p>23.5 MOIRÉ PATTERNS
</p>
<p>Moiré (pronounced mwa-ray) patterns can be formed
by interfering two sets of lines that have nearly com-
mon periodicities. We can demonstrate two fundamen-
tally different types of interference: the rotational
moiré and the translational (often referred to as misfit)
moiré. It&rsquo;s easy to understand moirés if you make three
transparent sheets of parallel lines (two with the same
spacing and one slightly different): you can generate
such sets of lines readily using any computer, choosing
the line widths to be similar to the gaps between them.
Then try these three exercises. (You should &lsquo;do&rsquo; the
experiment by making your own &lsquo;specimen&rsquo; or using
those on the Web site.)
</p>
<p>&amp; Take two misfit sets and align them exactly. This
gives a set of moiré fringes which are parallel to the
lines forming them, as shown in Figure 23.5A.

</p>
<p>FRINGES NOT PLANES
So lattice fringes are not direct images of the struc-
ture, but just give you information on lattice spacing
and orientation.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Take two identical sets of lines and rotate them.
Now, we produce a set of moiré fringes which is
perpendicular to the average direction of the initial
lines (Figure 23.5B).
</p>
<p>&amp; Take the first two sets and rotate them sowe produce
moiré fringes as in Figure 23.5C; but note that their
alignment to your reference sets is not obvious.
</p>
<p>When the misfit or misorientation is small, the moiré
fringe spacing is clearly much coarser than that of the
lines themselves. In particular, if the sets of lines in
Figure 23.5 are actually lattice planes in a crystal, the
moiré fringes may give information about the crystals
even if you cannot resolve the lattice planes. The sim-
plest way to analyze the spacings and orientation of the
moiré fringes is to consider the diffraction vectors from
the two &lsquo;lattices.&rsquo; Incidentally, the term &lsquo;moiré&rsquo; origi-
nated in the textile industry; it&rsquo;s related to the French
word for &lsquo;mohair,&rsquo; the silky hair of the Angora goat,
hence the watery or wavy pattern seen in silk fabrics&mdash;
and the lowercase &lsquo;m&rsquo;!
</p>
<p>23.5.A Translational Moiré Fringes
</p>
<p>In this case, since the planes are parallel, the g-vectors
will also be parallel. If we write these as g1 and g2, we
produce a new spacing gtm given by
</p>
<p>gtm &frac14; g2 � g1 (23:10)
</p>
<p>In Figure 23.6A, we have assigned g2 to the smaller
&lsquo;lattice&rsquo; spacing and tm indicates &lsquo;translational moiré&rsquo;
fringes. The vector gtm corresponds to a set of fringes
with spacing dtm, as shown by the following simple
manipulation
</p>
<p>dtm &frac14;

<p>(23:11)
</p>
<p>23.5.B Rotational Moiré Fringes
</p>
<p>We follow the same procedure as above, but now the two
g-vectors are identical in length and rotated through an
angle b so that the new g-vector, grm, has length 2g sinb/2,
as shown in Figure 23.6B. The fringe spacing is then

</p>
<p>23.5.C General Moiré Fringes
</p>
<p>If we use the same approach to locate ggm (gm: &lsquo;general
moiré&rsquo;) we can readily show that, for small misorienta-
tion, the spacing dgm of our fringes is given by
</p>
<p>dgm &frac14;

</p>
<p>23.6 EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS
OF MOIRÉ FRINGES
</p>
<p>Moiré fringes in TEM images were first reported early in
the history of the microscope. They were used byMinter
to identify a dislocation before lattice imaging was pos-
sible. Later, they were regarded as an imaging artifact
that obscured the true dislocation structure in twist
boundaries. Most recently, there has been renewed
interest due to the widespread development of thin
films grown on different substrates.
</p>
<p>Youmust be wary of the limitation or pitfall of using
moiré fringes to learn about interfaces and defects.
Moiré patterns result purely from the interference of
two &lsquo;sets of planes.&rsquo; Their appearance will be essentially
the same even if the two &lsquo;crystals&rsquo; are not in contact.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In TEM the moiré patterns correspond to interfer-
ence between a pair of beams, g1 and g2. If g1 is gener-
ated in the upper crystal and g2 in the lower, then each
reflection g1 in crystal 1 acts as an incident beam for the
lower crystal and produces a &lsquo;crystal-2 pattern&rsquo; around
each g1 reflection, as shown in Figure 23.7A. This pro-
cess is another example of double diffraction, as dis-
cussed in Section 18.9. Figure 23.7A is from a pair of
</p>
<p>perfectly aligned but misfitting cubic crystals viewed
along their common [001] zone axis; the pattern is
indexed in Figure 23.7B. When we have many planes
diffracting at a zone axis, as in this pattern, we expect to
see crossed moiré fringes.
</p>
<p>In the following three sections we will discuss exam-
ples of the use of moiré fringes.
</p>
<p>23.6.A Translational Moiré Patterns
</p>
<p>When a continuous film is grown on a thick substrate, one
question which is asked is: &lsquo;&lsquo;Do the lattice parameters of the
thin film correspond to the values of the same material in
bulk form?&rsquo;&rsquo; For example, a thin film of a cubic material on
an (001) substrate may be tetragonally strained so that the
afilm lattice parameter is smaller than abulk, but the cfilm
parameter is larger. If the bulk material has its bulk lattice
parameter, then the measurement of dtm, the translational
moiré spacing, can give a very accurate value for afilm.
Furthermore,we can tilt the specimen458 or 608 anddeduce
a value for cfilm to estimate the tetragonal distortion directly.
</p>
<p>Tilting the specimen can also give us information about
misfitting islands, as illustrated inFigure 23.8. In this case,we
see a hexagonal array of fringes when the two pseudo-hex-
agonal materials are viewed parallel to their common c-axis.
The variation in the contrast of the moiré fringes around the
edge of the particle occurs because the particle facets on
inclined planes, as is confirmed when we tilt the specimen.
In this system, when the islands are grown on different
substrates, they may still grow as platelets. In Figure 23.8B
and C the platelet is thick in the direction of the beam but,
when tilted over, we again seemoiré fringes. In particular, we
can see moiré fringes at the top of the platelet.
</p>
<p>23.6.B Rotational Moiré Patterns
</p>
<p>We often see rotational moiré fringes at twist bound-
aries, as illustrated for Si in Figure 23.9. A complicating
factor is that the misfit may be accommodated by an
array of dislocations having a periodicity which is
related to the moiré-fringe spacing. The periodic strain
field from the dislocations is, of course, only present if
the two materials are in intimate contact. This image is
actually recorded under rather special conditions, which
we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 27.
</p>
<p>23.6.C Dislocations and Moiré Fringes
</p>
<p>Since the moiré pattern can often be thought of as a
magnified view of the &lsquo;structure&rsquo; of the materials, such

<p>fringes. Closed circles (g1) correspond to crystal 1, open circles (g2) to
</p>
<p>crystal 2 and � double diffraction of g1 beams by crystal 2. Only �
reflections close to g1 and g2 have appreciable intensity.
</p>
<p>INTERFERENCE NOT STRUCTURE
We know that the top of an inclined island is not in
contact with the substrate yet it shows fringes; so this
reminds us that moiré fringes do not tell us about the
interface structure!

<p>patterns can be used to locate and give information on
dislocations which are present in one material but not
the other (but &lsquo;&lsquo;which?&rsquo;&rsquo; is the question).We can form an
image which contains information on the dislocation if
it is associated with a terminating lattice plane in one
material, but we don&rsquo;t actually &lsquo;see&rsquo; the dislocation. This
effect is illustrated in Figure 23.10; the image appears as
a magnified view of the projection of the dislocation.

</p>
<p>of it cannot readily be related to the structure of the defects.

</p>

</p>
<p>this thick particle is tilted over, moiré fringes are seen at both the top and
</p>
<p>the bottom.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This result can be deceptive, as you can see in Figure
23.11, where we have rotated the perfect grain slightly
and changed the dislocation fringe spacing.
</p>
<p>The images can always be related directly to the
projected Burgers vector of the dislocation, but you
must know which planes give rise to the fringes. So
make some models and experiment.
</p>
<p>This analysis even works if you have two or more
terminating fringes, but don&rsquo;t put too much emphasis
on the actual location of the fringes. Remember, the
dislocation may not be parallel to the beam. Moiré
fringes may be related to a dislocation in the plane of
the interface, since these locally relax the misfit. One
example of such an application comes from the work of
Vincent who showed that as Sn islands grew on a thin
film of SnTe, the moiré-fringe spacing around the perim-
eter of the islands gradually increased. Suddenly, the
strain at the interface was so large that a dislocation was
nucleated to relax the strain and the process began
again. The analysis of the changes in moiré-fringe spac-
ing is shown in Figure 23.12.
</p>
<p>Since the spacing of moiré fringes essentially gives a
magnified view of the misfit between aligned particles
</p>
<p>and a substrate, we can use them tomeasure the strain in
such particles. In its simplest form, in one dimension,
the strain is given by

and the substrate, respectively. Youmay need to modify
this equation if the alignment is not simple cube-on-
cube.
</p>
<p>23.6.D Complex Moiré Fringes
</p>
<p>Since moiré fringes can occur whenever Dg is small
enough to be included in the objective aperture, we can
have a situation where the relative rotation is rather
large (458 or even 908) so that g1 and g2 correspond to
different sets of planes. This is illustrated in Figure 23.13
for YBCO grains rotated 458 on anMgO substrate. You
can see that, as a bonus, the moiré fringes allow you to
locate the 458 boundaries directly. Small rotations of the
diffracting planes cause small rotations of g but large
rotations of Dg.
</p>
<p>Two overlapping lattices produce a pattern of inter-
ference fringes that is much coarser than the original
pattern and is very sensitive to differences in lattice
spacing and relative orientations. We can use this sensi-
tivity to provide an optical method for examining small
rotations or lattice-parameter differences in HRTEM
images. Make transparencies of the &lsquo;distorted&rsquo; image
such as that shown in Figure 23.14A and a reference
lattice; the reference lattice could be the perfect-crystal
image or a template you have created on the computer.

<p>to one another. You will have created a new artificial
moiré image similar to that shown in Figure 23.14B,
which was formed for a special grain boundary in Al
by Hetherington and Dahmen. This boundary is special
because one set of {111} planes in the upper grain is
nearly normal to one set in the lower grain. How near is
near? Hetherington and Dahmen overlapped their
experimental image with a template that was drawn to
have two sets of lines normal to one another. Overlaying
the two images gave moiré fringes, which were not quite
perpendicular to one another. Careful measurements
of the rotation and fringe spacing showed that the
fringes in the experimental image were actually 89.38
apart, not 908.
</p>
<p>23.7 FRESNEL CONTRAST
</p>
<p>We saw in Chapter 9 that we can use Fresnel-contrast
images of holes in carbon films to correct the astigma-
tism of the objective lens. We&rsquo;ll now discuss how we can
use this same contrast mechanism to learn more about
particular features in the specimen. In the classic
demonstration of Fresnel contrast using visible light,
bright fringes can appear in the geometric shadow of
an opaque mask or dark fringes can appear in the illu-
minated region. The complication introduced in the
TEM version is that the &lsquo;mask&rsquo; is not opaque but simply
</p>
<p>has a different inner potential. Therefore, in any situation
where the inner potential changes abruptly, we can pro-
duce Fresnel fringes if we image that region out of focus.
Since we still focus the objective lens on a plane that is
close to the specimen, we are in the near-field or Fresnel
regime. Since we often study lines, planes, or platelets by
this technique, we&rsquo;ll often see Fresnel fringes.
</p>
<p>23.7.A The Fresnel Biprism
</p>
<p>We can demonstrate a particularly simple interference
phenomenon by placing a wire at a position F on the
optic axis, as shown in Figure 23.15A. Since the beam
is narrow, the wire should be less than 1 mm in diameter
and can be made of a drawn glass fiber coated with Cr
or Au. If we apply �10 V to the wire, it will bend the
electron beam on either side in opposite directions. The
resulting interference fringes can be recorded on
photographic film, as shown in Figure 23.15B, or on
the CCD. The wire here is acting as a beam splitter;
we&rsquo;ll encounter it again when we discuss holography in
Section 29.11. The visible-light analog is the prism.
Notice how the wire acts to produce two virtual
sources s1 and s2, which are Ds apart. Horiuchi gives

<p>23.7.B Magnetic-Domain Walls
</p>
<p>Although we&rsquo;ll discuss imaging magnetic materials in
Chapter 29, it is appropriate here to consider briefly the
similarity of Lorentz microscopy of magnetic-domain
walls to other interference images. We know from our
</p>
<p>discussion of magnetic fields in the electron lens in
Chapter 6 that the Lorentz force acting on an electron
with velocity v is proportional to v�B. If the sign ofB is
opposite in two adjacent domains, then the electrons
will be deflected in opposite directions as shown in
Figure 23.16. The &lsquo;converging&rsquo; domain wall is remark-
ably similar to the electron interferometer in the pre-
vious section. We can indeed produce a series of
interference fringes. You should consult the original
analysis of Boersch et al.; the basics are given in the
book by Hirsch et al. who show that we can calculate
the fringe spacing Dx using
</p>
<p>Dx &frac14; l L&thorn; l&eth; &THORN;
2 l bm
</p>
<p>(23:16)
</p>
<p>where bm is the angle of deflection of the beam, l is the
electron wavelength, l is the &lsquo;source&rsquo;-to-specimen dis-
tance and L is the specimen-to-&lsquo;detector&rsquo; distance. Quo-
tation marks are used to emphasize that these are
&lsquo;effective&rsquo; distances like the &lsquo;camera length.&rsquo; The value
of Dx can be �20nm. You&rsquo;ll only see such interference
fringes if you form the image using parallel illumination.
We&rsquo;ll return to the imaging of magnetic specimens in
Chapter 29.

<p>23.8 FRESNEL CONTRAST FROM VOIDS
OR GAS BUBBLES
</p>
<p>Youmight think that it would be difficult to image voids
or small gas-filled cavities when there is no associated
strain field, because voids or cavities do not scatter
electrons. However, we can image holes that are fully
enclosed inside the specimen by defocusing the image
and observing the special phase contrast; this is the
Fresnel contrast that we introduced back in Sections
2.9 and 9.5. In principle, we can apply this technique
to holes that contain a liquid or even a solid (i.e., a
second phase). In the latter case, however, the Fresnel
contrast is likely to be hidden by strain contrast in the
specimen.
</p>
<p>You can image small voids or gas bubbles in two ways
</p>
<p>&amp; By orienting the region of interest so that s = 0; the
cavity then reduces the &lsquo;thickness&rsquo; of material locally.
</p>
<p>&amp; By using Fresnel contrast.
</p>
<p>In the Fresnel technique, the image shows contrast
whenever the objective lens is not focused on the bottom
surface of the specimen.
</p>
<p>Wilkens expressed the wave function as
</p>
<p>c t; r0&eth; &THORN; &frac14; c0 t&eth; &THORN; 1&thorn; Dr r0&eth; &THORN; &thorn; iDi r0&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � (23:17)
</p>
<p>Here c0(t) is the wave function in the absence of the
cavity; Dr and Di are real functions which depend on
</p>
<p>&amp; The location and dimensions of the cavity.
&amp; The extinction distance and absorption parameter of
the matrix (xg and xg
</p>
<p>0).
&amp; The potential difference, DV, between the inner
potential of the matrix, V0, and that of the cavity,
Vc (it could be filled or empty).
</p>
<p>In the case of thick foils where zc, the size of the
cavity in the direction of the beam, is &lt;0.1xg, the wave
function can be expressed as
</p>
<p>c t; r0&eth; &THORN; &frac14; c t&eth; &THORN; 1&thorn; iDi r
0&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � (23:18)

dence is damped out (the foil is thick), the intensity can
be expressed quite simply as

<p>(23:21)
</p>
<p>We can summarize some results from this analysis
</p>
<p>&amp; When the image is in focus, the cavity is invisible so
we view it out of focus to observe the Fresnel-fringe
contrast.
</p>
<p>&amp; The contrast depends on the difference in the inner
potential of the matrix and the cavity; we usually see
the most contrast if the content of the cavity is
vacuum, because then e0 is greatest.
</p>
<p>&amp; The contrast does depend on the wavelength of the
electrons through both k and E.
</p>
<p>&amp; Cavities as small as 1&ndash;2 nm in diameter can be
imaged using Df values of 0.5&ndash;1.0 mm.
</p>
<p>&amp; In the case where w=0 and 2e0&gt; xg
�1 (so Di is&lt; 0),
</p>
<p>if Df &lt; 0, the image is a bright dot surrounded by a
dark fringe; if Df&gt; 0 the dot is dark and the fringe is
bright.
</p>
<p>&amp; This is the same behavior as we saw in Figure 9.21,
where we had a dark fringe at underfocus and a
bright fringe at overfocus.
</p>
<p>The contrast is illustrated in Figure 23.17. You should
note that it is not the same as the black-white contrast
from small precipitates that result from strain fields
as we&rsquo;ll discuss in Chapter 26. You&rsquo;ll find a more detailed
analysis in the article by Rühle and Wilkens, but you
can already appreciate the relevance for imaging
nanoparticles.

<p>23.9 FRESNEL CONTRAST FROM
LATTICE DEFECTS
</p>
<p>This topic is one that is receiving more attention as
computers and simulation programs become, respec-
tively, more powerful and more user-friendly. The rea-
son for this increased attention is clear, as Bursill et al.
showed in their pioneering studying of Fresnel fringes
from edge-on defects. They demonstrated that if you
take great care in determining all the electron-optical

<p>parameters (particularly what defocus steps you are

information for a full analysis. We&rsquo;ll refer you to their

dislocations and edge-on grain boundaries; in both cases,

<p>23.9.A Grain Boundaries
</p>
<p>We might expect almost any grain boundary to show
a localized change in the inner potential. However,
following the original suggestion by Clarke (1979),
Fresnel-contrast imaging has been used most exten-
sively to study those interfaces which are thought to
contain a thin layer of glass. Part of the reason for this
emphasis is simply that other techniques tend to give
ambiguous results for such interfaces.
</p>
<p>When you use the Fresnel-fringe technique to study
grain boundaries or analyze intergranular films, you
must orient the boundary in the edge-on position so
that you can probe the potential at the boundary.
Later, in Section 30.11, we will consider the actual
shape of this &lsquo;potential well.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>In a real TEM specimen, the specimen thickness is
likely to change at the grain boundary even if only by a
nanometer or so. Since the specimen will be quite thin,
this change can give an appreciable contribution to the
difference in the &lsquo;effective inner potential&rsquo; seen by
the electron beam. You can defocus the image to see
the Fresnel contrast shown in Figure 23.18.
</p>
<p>The Fresnel-contrast technique can equally well be
applied to phase boundaries, with perhaps the most thor-
oughly studied example being the Si/SiO2 interface. Since
the details of the contrast are sensitive to the abruptness of
the change in the inner potential, the technique can also
produce information on this aspect of the interface.Never-
theless, youmust always look for associated changes in the
real geometry that can occur even when you&rsquo;re just form-
ing Fresnel fringes from the edge of the specimen.
</p>
<p>23.9.B End-On Dislocations
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just seen that we can detect Fresnel-fringe contrast
from edge-on high-angle grain boundaries.Wemight then
ask: &lsquo;&lsquo;is it possible to detect similar contrast from low-angle
grain boundaries, i.e., grain boundaries which consist of
arrays of distinct dislocations?&rsquo;&rsquo; It is indeed possible, as
shown in the series of images from a tilt boundary in NiO
in Figure 23.19. This through-focus series, and images of
other grain boundaries, was analyzed by assuming that
</p>
<p>there is a change inDV(r) in themean inner potential at the
core of the dislocation. Two models were proposed for
DV(r). In model 1, when r &lt; r0
</p>
<p>DV r&eth; &THORN; &frac14; DV0 1� e
� r� r0&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>( )
</p>
<p>(23:22)
</p>
<p>but when r &gt; r0
</p>
<p>DV r&eth; &THORN; &frac14; 0 (23:23)
</p>
<p>The constant a is �0.1r0. In model 2
</p>
<p>DV r&eth; &THORN; &frac14; DV0 exp �r2 r20
� �
</p>
<p>&eth;23:24&THORN;
�
</p>
<p>In both cases, DV0 is negative. As an example of the
quantities involved in these equations, if the Burgers
vector of the dislocations is 1/2 [110], Rühle and Sass
found thatDV0=0.09V0 for r0=3.2 Å. They could not
distinguish between the two models for DV(r) but two
clear points come out of this study
</p>
<p>&amp; You must know the inclination of your foil surface.
If the lower surface is inclined to the horizontal, then
thicker parts of the specimen can be much closer to
the objective lens than in the thin area; you can do a
quick calculation to prove this point.
</p>
<p>&amp; The inner potential at a dislocation core is not the
same as the bulk value. You should expect the value
of DV0 to be influenced by a change in stoichiometry
or impurity segregation.
</p>
<p>Before leaving this topic, we should point out that the
inner potential at the grain boundarymay not be uniform,
perhaps because the width of the interface varies or the
interface facets on a mesoscopic scale. You can still see
Fresnel effects which relate to the periodicity in the grain
boundary even if this periodicity is not associated with
dislocations. A particularly clear example of such a varia-
tion is shown in Figure 23.20, where a twin boundary in
spinel is essentially constructed of parallel triangular tubes;
the inner potential inside the tube is much lower than the
matrix value and the tubes are only about 1.2 nm high.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Phase contrast will occur whenever we have more than one beam contributing to the image.
The clue is: if you see fringes (periodic contrast) of any sort, then you are almost certainly
observing a phase-contrast image. This conclusion even applies to thickness fringes (Chap-
ter 24) and stacking-fault fringes (Chapter 25) in what are traditionally called two-beam
diffraction-contrast images.
</p>
<p>Phase-contrast images are widely used in three forms
</p>
<p>&amp; Images which relate directly to the structural periodicity of the crystalline specimen

&amp; Fresnel-contrast

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It is even possible for an image to show all three effects at the same time. So you must
remember that phase-contrast effects don&rsquo;t just occur when you are forming high-resolution
images. You will create Fresnel contrast whenever your specimen is thick or you are work-
ing out of focus. We should note that it is difficult, but in principle not impossible, to be
quantitative in your analysis of Fresnel fringes.
</p>
<p>The usefulness of moiré fringes continues to surprise even experienced users of the TEM.
However, you still have to exercise caution when interpreting what they are telling you
about defects in your material.
</p>
<p>The appearance of the Fresnel image varies with small changes in the thickness, orienta-
tion, or scattering factor of your specimen, and variations in the focus or astigmatism of the
objective lens.

</p>
<p>Thickness and Bending Effects
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>We see diffraction contrast in an image for two reasons: either the thickness of the specimen
varies or the diffraction conditions change across the specimen: the t effect and the s effect!
</p>
<p>The thickness effect: when the thickness of the specimen is not uniform, the coupling
(interference) of the direct and diffracted beams occurs over different distances, thus
producing a thickness effect. Don&rsquo;t confuse diffraction contrast due to thickness changes
with mass-thickness contrast discussed in the previous chapter. The effects are very differ-
ent. The diffraction contrast changes with small changes in tilt, but the mass-thickness
contrast doesn&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>The bending effect:Whenever the orientation of the diffracting planes changes, i.e., when
the diffracting planes tilt relative to the beam, the contrast changes. To interpret changes in
image contrast we need to understand how the contrast is related to thickness and bending.
</p>
<p>We call these two important contrast phenomena &lsquo;thickness fringes&rsquo; and &lsquo;bend
contours.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>The present chapter is particularly important for three reasons
</p>
<p>&amp; All TEM specimens are thin but their thickness invariably changes.
&amp; Because the specimens are so thin they also bend elastically, i.e., the lattice planes
physically rotate.
</p>
<p>&amp; The planes also bend when lattice defects are introduced.
</p>
<p>We can see the effects of these rotations even when they are &lt;0.18 since they still have a
significant effect on the image. Therefore, the bending may arise because the specimen is
thin (i.e., giving possible artifacts of the technique) or it may be caused by strains which were
present in the bulk material. The result is that, in real specimens, bending and thickness
effects often occur together.
</p>
<p>24.1 THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS
</p>
<p>To understand the origin of thickness fringes and bend
contours, we limit the discussion to the two-beam situa-
tion and recall equations 13.46 and 13.47, which we
derived from the Howie-Whelan equations. The inten-
sity of the Bragg-diffracted beam is then given by equa-
tions 13.48 and 13.49 and summarized as

<p>Although we will concentrate on Ig (the DF image
intensity) for most of this discussion, the direct beam
(BF image) behaves in a complementary manner
(neglecting, for now, the effect of absorption and other
diffracted beams). The diffracted intensity is periodic in
the two independent quantities, t and seff. If we imagine
the situation where t remains constant but s (and hence
seff) varies locally, then we produce bend contours.
Similarly, if s remains constant while t varies, then
thickness fringes will result.
</p>
<p>24.1 THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS ............................................................................................................................................................... 407</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This chapter is simply concerned with the physical
understanding of equation 24.1 and how you can
relate the image to the information contained in the
DP. Although these effects are often a hindrance to
systematic analysis of lattice defects, they can, in
certain situations, be useful. The most important reason
for understanding them is that they are essentially
unavoidable!
</p>
<p>24.2 THICKNESS FRINGES
</p>
<p>As a result of the way that we thin TEM specimens, very
few of them (only evaporated thin films or ideal ultra-
microtomed, cleaved, or FIBbed sections) have a uni-
form thickness over their entire area. A BF/DF pair of
images from the same region of the specimen is shown in
Figure 24.1; the thin area is generally in the form of a
wedge.
</p>
<p>Consider again equation 24.1. You should remem-
ber that, in this calculation, t is not the &lsquo;thickness&rsquo; of the
foil; it is actually the distance &lsquo;traveled&rsquo; by the diffracted
beam, but we&rsquo;ll usually just say &lsquo;thickness.&rsquo; If we try to
treat themany-beam situation rigorously, then the value
of t would, in general, be different for each beam. If you
are actually viewing the foil flat-on (i.e., one surface
normal to the beam), then twill be close to the geometric
thickness of the foil. However, it is more difficult to
analyze the image thoroughly when the foil is wedge-
shaped and inclined to the beam. We almost invariably
make the approximation that t is fixed with the justifica-
tion being that the Bragg angles are small.
</p>
<p>Equation 24.1 tells us that intensities of both the
0 and the g beams oscillate as t varies. Furthermore,
these oscillations are complementary for the DF and BF
</p>
<p>images, as we show schematically in Figure 24.2. You
can, of course, confirm this observation at the micro-
scope by forming the image without using an objective
aperture; there is then minimal contrast when you&rsquo;re in
focus. The intensity, I0, of the incident beam starts equal
to unity and gradually decays, while the intensity of the
diffracted beam, Ig, gradually increases until it becomes
unity; I0 is then zero; the process then repeats itself.
</p>
<p>These oscillations in I0 or Ig are known as thickness
fringes, though they are often not fringes.We sometimes
call them thickness contours, because they denote the

</p>
<p>wedge-shaped specimen of Si at 300 kV tilted so that g(220) is strong. The
</p>
<p>periodicity and contrast of the fringes are similar and complementary in
</p>
<p>each image.
</p>
<p>TWO BEAMS
The situation is complicated by absorption and the
presence of other diffracted beams: we are never truly
in a two-beam situation.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 24.2. (A) At the Bragg condition (s=0), the intensities of the
</p>
<p>direct and diffracted beams oscillate in a complementary way. (B) For a
</p>
<p>wedge specimen, the separation of the fringes in the image (C) is then
</p>
<p>determined by the angle of the wedge and the extinction distance, xg.
</p>
<p>THICKNESS, xg, AND ABSORPTION
As a rule of thumb, when other diffracted beams are
present the effective extinction distance is reduced. At
greater thicknesses, absorption occurs and the con-
trast is reduced.

<p>contours where the specimen has constant thickness;
you will only see these fringes when the thickness of
the specimen varies locally, otherwise the contrast will
be a uniform gray. As we&rsquo;ll see, the actual contrast can
quickly change if the specimen is tilted through a small
angle.
</p>
<p>For example, in BF images, thicker areas are often
brighter than thinner areas, which really is counter-
intuitive.
</p>
<p>Several examples of how thickness fringes might
appear in your image are shown in Figure 24.3.
Although it is often helpful to think of these fringes as
thickness contours analogous to height or depth con-
tours on amap, with the hole at sea level, remember that
there are two surfaces to the TEM specimen. A DF
image will usually appear to give greater contrast. This
is partly because the hole now appears dark but also
because many-beam effects are less important in DF. In
Figure 24.3A, the narrow fringe pattern in this DF
image is due to the grain boundary region being thinner
than the matrix. In the DF image in Figure 24.3B, the
reflection used to form this image is only excited in the
right grain so the left grain is black; the diffracting grain
exhibits strong thickness fringes in the regions where
there are microtwins. This image introduces the idea
that images of defects can also show thickness effects.
</p>
<p>In Figure 24.3C, the specimen is an almost flat,
parallel-sided film of MgO with holes formed by prefer-
ential chemical etching at defects; after thinning, the
surfaces were faceted by heating the specimen at
14008C. The holes in the image are white, so it is a BF
image. The contours, like the holes, are angular because
of the faceting, but they are not uniformly spaced
because it&rsquo;s not a uniform wedge. Notice that the center
of the hole is faceted and that the first fringe is a very
narrow dark line. We know that this surface is different
because it is curved. We also know from Figure 24.2
that, in a BF image, the first fringe must be bright if the
thickness actually decreases to zero. We can therefore
conclude from this one image that the specimen is not
tapering to zero thickness at the center of this hole.
</p>
<p>Although we&rsquo;ve talked about wedges or specimens
with gently curving surfaces so far, the way we actually
calculate and analyze the contrast from such wedges is
shown in Figure 24.4. We imagine that the specimen has
two parallel surfaces which are normal to the electron
beam, so that we have a fixed thickness for each calcula-
tion. We also assume that the beam is normal to the
</p>
<p>surface. We then change t and recalculate the intensity.
Finally, we plot the different values for the intensity
against t (as in Figure 24.2A) but we never actually
inclined the surfaces!
</p>
<p>BLACK AND WHITE
It is important to realize that the image may appear
to be black or white depending on the thickness of the
specimen.

<p>Figure 24.5 shows an image of a wedge-shaped speci-
men of Al2O3 which has been heat treated so that the
surface has faceted parallel to certain low-index planes.
The thickness fringes can then be seen to be discrete
regions of different shades of gray; the fringes are, in
general, quantized. You can form similar specimens by
cleaving layer materials (e.g., graphite or mica) but the
specimens tend to bend, which obscures these abrupt
contrast changes.
</p>
<p>24.3 THICKNESS FRINGES AND THE DP
</p>
<p>A general rule in TEM is that, whenever we see a peri-
odicity in real space (i.e., in the image), there must be a
corresponding array of spots in reciprocal space; the
converse is also true. If we image a specimen with a
constant wedge angle, thenwewill see a uniform spacing
of thickness fringes in both the BF and DF two-beam
images even when sg =0. We must therefore have more
than one spot &lsquo;at G&rsquo; when sg = 0 otherwise we would
not see fringes. We already know that if we increase s or
if the wedge angle were larger, then the fringe separation
</p>
<p>would decrease and the spacing of these spots must
therefore increase.
</p>
<p>To understand why there is more than one spot at G,
go back to Chapter 17 where we showed that, because
the specimen is thin, any spot in theDPwill be elongated
normal to the surface. When the specimen is wedge
shaped, there will be two surfaces and we can imagine
the spot being elongated normal to both surfaces, as was
shown in Figure 17.4. Actually we have two curved
relrods which do not intersect at s = 0; we related this
curvature to the dispersion surface in Chapter 15. The
diffraction geometry close to G is shown in Figure 24.6.

<p>well defined and continuous, even when the wedge angle and wedge axis
</p>
<p>change. (B) At higher magnification, the contrast is seen to be quantized
</p>
<p>within a given fringe.

</p>
<p>actually cross (they are the black curves) so there are always two spots in
</p>
<p>the DP.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This spot spacing is thus related to xg
�1 and the
</p>
<p>wedge angle. While the spacing of the thickness fringes
depends on xg, it is not equal to xg. As we referenced
back in Chapter 17, Amelinckx&rsquo;s group has shown that
we can describe this geometric relationship as shown in
Figure 17.4. As we tilt the crystal away from s = 0, the
Ewald sphere will move up or down (as s becomes
negative or positive) to cut the two &lsquo;rods.&rsquo; So, you can
see that there will be two spots instead of one at G and
their separation will increase as s increases. As the
separation increases, the spacing of the fringes
decreases; the thickness fringes move closer together
because the xeff has decreased. The change in the fringe
spacing is similar either side of s=0. So be wary of
trying to make accurate thickness measurements for
wedge-shaped crystals.
</p>
<p>We refer to thickness fringes as being an example of
amplitude contrast because, in the two-beam case, they
are associated with a particular reflection, g. They actu-
ally occur due to interference between two beams, both
of which are located close to g, so they are really an
example of phase contrast although we rarely think of
them as such.
</p>
<p>24.4 BEND CONTOURS (ANNOYING
ARTIFACT, USEFUL TOOL, INVALUABLE
INSIGHT)
</p>
<p>This is a particularly satisfying topic, because you can
understand it by considering a simple physical picture
and yet the concept involved is the basis for understand-
ing most aspects of defect contrast. Bend contours
(don&rsquo;t call them extinction contours) occur when a par-
ticular set of diffracting planes is not parallel every-
where; the planes rock into, and through, the Bragg
condition.
</p>
<p>The specimen shown schematically in Figure 24.7 is
aligned so that the hkl planes are exactly parallel to the
incident beam at the center of the figure and always lie
normal to the specimen surface even when it bends. We
imagine that the foil bends evenly, so that the hkl planes
are exactly in the Bragg condition at A and the �h �k �l
planes are exactly in the Bragg condition at B. We can
draw the systematic row of reflections as you see below
the bent crystal. Notice that�G is now on the left andG
on the right (with no lens present). Now if we form a BF
</p>
<p>image we will see two dark lines. Next, we form the
DF image using reflection g. We see a bright band on
the left because that&rsquo;s where g is excited. Now use �g to
form the image and the bright band is on the right.
These bands are referred to as bend contours. A set
of experimental images is also shown in Figures 24.8
and 24.9.
</p>
<p>Remembering Bragg&rsquo;s law, the (2h 2k 2l) planes dif-
fract strongly when y has increased to�2yB. So we&rsquo;ll see
extra contours because of the higher-order diffraction.
As y increases, the planes rotate through the Bragg
condition more quickly (within a small distance Dx) so
the bend contours become much narrower for higher-
order reflections.
</p>
<p>Tyro-microscopists occasionally have difficulty in
distinguishing higher-order bend contours from real
line defects in the crystal. The solution is very simple:
tilt your specimen. Bend contours are not fixed to any
particular position in the specimen and quickly move as
you tilt.
</p>
<p>Bend contours are true amplitude contrast, not
phase contrast.
</p>
<p>DISPLACE THE SAD APERTURE
In actually doing this imaging experiment, you
should translate the objective aperture to form the
DF images; you&rsquo;ll lose some resolution but don&rsquo;t
move (neither translate nor tilt) the specimen.
</p>
<p>FRINGE PERIODICITY
The minimum spot spacing in the DP corresponds to
the periodicity of the thickness fringes, which at s=0
is given directly by the extinction distance and the
wedge angle.
</p>

<p>hkl planes are in the Bragg condition, the reflection G is excited. Notice
</p>
<p>that G and the diffracting region are on opposite sides of O; if the foil were
</p>

<p>24.5 ZAPs AND REAL-SPACE
CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
</p>
<p>In the above discussion, we only considered bending
about one axis. In real specimens, the bending will be
more complex. This complexity will be important when
the bent area is oriented close to a low-index pole,
because the bend contours then form a zone-axis pattern
or ZAP. Two examples of these ZAPs are shown in
Figure 24.8. Although the ZAP is distorted, the symme-
try of the zone axis is clear and such patterns have been
used as a tool for real-space crystallographic analysis.
Each contour is uniquely related to a particular set of
diffracting planes, so the ZAP does not automatically
introduce the twofold rotation axis that we are used to
in SAD patterns. These contours are the real-space
analog of the symmetry seen in large-angle CBED
patterns.
</p>
<p>In fact it&rsquo;s the exception that a �g pair of bend
contours is straight and parallel. In case you are having
</p>
<p>a problem visualizing how a pair of contours might
diverge, go back to the bent specimen in Figure 24.7,
hold the �h �k �l plane fixed at x= x0, and then as youmove
along the foil (going into the page) gradually decrease
the bend in the foil. The position where the hkl planes
are in the Bragg condition graduallymoves to the left, so
�x0 becomes more negative. Since x0 is fixed the con-
tours move apart in the image.
</p>
<p>Notice how at the zone axis, the main 020 and 002
contours in the [100] ZAP are closely spaced, while in
the [103] pattern, only one pair of contours is closely
spaced; the others are more clearly defined and farther
apart.

</p>

</p>
<p>(insets). Each diffracting plane produces two bend contours, depending on
</p>
<p>whether yB or �yB is satisfied. Note that the separation of the bend
</p>
<p>contours is not uniform for any particular pair of planes because the
</p>
<p>curvature of the bending is not, in general, the same.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When the foil curvature is equal, this effect allows
you to recognize a low-index ZAP. Since you can tilt the
crystal, you can form different ZAPs from exactly the
same area of your specimen just as you can for SAD and
CBED (where we also use the term ZAP but then refer
to a DP; really a ZADP). You index the contours in the
manner described in Section 18.4 but use all the spots in
the ZADP.
</p>
<p>If your specimen is buckled, you can tilt it so that a
particular bend contour stays at the position you&rsquo;re
studying in the image. You&rsquo;re then doing the same
operation as we did using Kikuchi lines in Chapter 19.
Tilting in image mode is more tricky, but if the specimen
is very buckled or too thin, you can&rsquo;t use Kikuchi lines.
The ZAP and bend contours let you work in real space.
You can even set the value of s for a particular g at a
particular location on your specimen!
</p>
<p>24.6 HILLOCKS, DENTS, OR SADDLES
</p>
<p>The simplest use for bend contours is in determining
whether an area is a hillock or a dent. This information
is useful when analyzing particles grown on a substrate,
particularly if the substrate is a thin film.
</p>
<p>Figure 24.9A and B shows a ZAP in a thin specimen
of Al2O3 and the associated SADP; the dark bands
are f3�300g bend contours. Figure 24.9C&ndash;H shows
DF images recorded using each of these reflections;
the area is identical in each of these images. Using
Figure 24.7 you can determine the sense of the bending.
You can see directly that the bend contour from one
set of hkl planes does not necessarily lie parallel to
those planes but instead both curves and changes in
width.
</p>
<p>Remember, for these contrast experiments especially,
it is important to move the objective aperture, not the
specimen. The resolution of the image will be somewhat
lower but this is not critical for this application.
</p>
<p>24.7 ABSORPTION EFFECTS
</p>
<p>When your specimen is very thick you won&rsquo;t see an
image, so we can say that the electrons have then all
been absorbed. The absorption process is more
</p>
<p>important than this obvious statement might sug-
gest. Much of our thinking about this topic is, how-
ever, just as empirical. In fact it is common to define
an imaginary component x0g to the extinction dis-
tance, so
</p>
<p>xabsg &frac14; xg
x0g
</p>
<p>x0g &thorn; ixg
</p>
<p> !
</p>
<p>(24:3)
</p>
<p>Then we use xabsg in the Howie-Whelan equations.
The term x0g is found to be approximately 10xg. The
reason for choosing this expression for xabsg is that
the 1/xg in the Howie&ndash;Whelan equations can then
be replaced by (i/x0g + 1/xg). We do the same for x0.
The result is that g in the Howie-Whelan equations
has an imaginary component. Consequently, we now
have an exponential decay of the diffracted ampli-
tude. It&rsquo;s a completely phenomenological treatment,
but you will see reference to it. When we discuss
EELS in Part 4, you&rsquo;ll appreciate the difficulties in
modeling the effects of inelastic scattering on the
image by a single parameter.
</p>
<p>We did briefly discuss absorption of Bloch waves in
Chapter 14. We showed that Bloch wave 2 (smaller k)
is less strongly absorbed than Bloch wave 1; Bloch
wave 1 travels along the atom nuclei while Bloch
wave 2 channels between them. As the crystal becomes
thicker we lose Bloch wave 1. Since thickness fringes
result from a beating between the two beams, we will
lose the thickness fringes but will still be able to &lsquo;see
through&rsquo; the specimen as you can appreciate from
Figure 24.10. Now you can see why equation 24.3
must be phenomenological&mdash;there are no beams in
the crystal!
</p>
<p>Bend contours in thicker parts of the specimen will
also show the effect of this anomalous absorption.
Looking back at Chapter 15 on the dispersion surface,
you&rsquo;ll see that when sg is negative, the tie line D1D2
would be closer to 0 than g andBlochwave 2 contributes
to fg more strongly. When sg becomes positive, Bloch
wave 1 is the more strongly excited. We lose Bloch wave
1 because the specimen is thick. So as we rock through
the Bragg condition on the bend contour, we&rsquo;ll lose the
thickness fringes faster where Bloch wave 1 was weaker
already, i.e., when sg is negative or inside the �g pair of
bend contours.
</p>
<p>ANOMALOUS ABSORPTION
Absorption due to the loss of Bloch wave 1 is called
anomalous absorption for historical reasons, not
because it is unexpected.
</p>
<p>ZAPs IN REAL SPACE
In this case, a small g in the DP gives a small spacing
in the image, contrary to the usual inverse relation-
ship between image and DP.
</p>
<p>24 .7 ABSORPT ION EFFECTS ...................................................................................................................................................................... 413</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We can summarize this discussion of absorption
with some conclusions
</p>
<p>&amp; We can define a parameter x0g which is usually about
10 xg and is really a fudge factor which modifies the
Howie-Whelan equations to fit the experimental
observations.
</p>
<p>&amp; The different Bloch waves are scattered differently.
If they don&rsquo;t contribute to the image, we say that
they were absorbed. We thus have anomalous
absorption which is quite normal!
</p>
<p>&amp; Usable thicknesses are limited to about 5xg, but you
can optimize this if you channel the less-absorbed
Bloch wave.
</p>
<p>24.8 COMPUTER SIMULATION OF
THICKNESS FRINGES
</p>
<p>Thickness fringes can be simulated. We&rsquo;ll talk more
about the programs in Chapter 25, but be wary: don&rsquo;t
use a program as a &lsquo;black box.&rsquo; Why do we need or
want to simulate thickness fringes? As an illustration,
let&rsquo;s look at a 908-wedge specimen (see Section 10.6) so
that we know how the thickness changes with posi-
tion. The actual thickness will be very sensitive to the
orientation of the specimen since the specimen is so
thick, as shown in Figure 24.11A. The specimen is a
GaAs/AlxGa1�xAs layered composite grown on (001).
Since the cleavage surface is {110} it can be mounted
at 458 so the beam is nearly parallel to the [100] pole.
The value of xg is different for the two materials, so
they can be readily distinguished. Clearly, a quantita-
tive simulation of this situation is non-trivial, espe-
cially if you have to consider the effect shown in
Figure 24.6.
</p>
<p>Because the fringe spacing changes as xg changes, it
will also change if you vary the accelerating voltage.
You can see this effect clearly in Figure 24.11B and C
which compares the same region of a wedge specimen
imaged at 300 and 100 kV.
</p>
<p>24.9 THICKNESS-FRINGE/BEND-
CONTOUR INTERACTIONS
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear from equation 24.1 that both bending and
thickness effects can occur together. This combined
effect is shown in Figure 24.12, where the axis of bend-
ing runs normal to the edge of the wedge specimen.
When s = 0, the value of xeff is largest. As we bend
away from the Bragg condition, on either side, xeff

</p>
<p>image decreases when the effect of anomalous absorption is included.
</p>
<p>Note that the defects are still visible when the fringes have disappeared at
</p>
<p>a thickness of �5 xg.

</p>

</p>

<p>voltage increases, and you can see through thicker areas; compare with
</p>
<p>the images in Figure 24.1.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>decreases so the thickness contours curve towards the
edge of the specimen. This image actually shows the
g(111) and �g(�1�1�1) contours (arrowed). As an exercise
you can calculate the value of s at any point between the
contours in this image. Assume the wedge angle is con-
stant and t = 0 at the edge; then compare the thickness
you deduce using xeff with the thickness value extrapo-
lated from the regions where s = 0.
</p>
<p>If a defect causes the specimen to bend, then the
contrast from the defect and that from thickness varia-
tions will be linked.
</p>
<p>Since the effective thickness is seff
�1, it will change as
</p>
<p>we increase the deviation parameter, s. You can use this
fact to determine the thickness of an area quite accurately,
provided you have a reference value, such as zero thick-
ness at a hole in the specimen. You initially tilt the speci-
men so that the chosen reflection is at theBragg condition.
(Remember that this analysis assumes that we have only
two beams.) You can determine sg quite accurately if you
can see theKikuchi lines. Then you can determine seff
</p>
<p>�1 at
different positions on the specimen. The maximum value
of seff
</p>
<p>�1 is xg and occurs at sg=0.As you tilt the specimen
to increase sg in the positive or negative sense, you&rsquo;ll see
the thickness fringes move closer together. We&rsquo;ll examine
the situation where sg is very large in Chapter 27, and
where the foil also bends in Section 24.10.
</p>
<p>24.10 OTHER EFFECTS OF BENDING
</p>
<p>In some situations, the bending of the foil may be more
subtle. For example, strains in TEM specimens may
relax at the surface of the thin specimen. A particularly
important example of this effect was found in the study
of superlattices in semiconductors.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll generalize the situation a little. Imagine that two
cubic materials, which normally have slightly different
lattice parameters, are grown on one another to form an
artificial superlattice with an (001) (i.e., cube-on-cube)
interface plane. One crystal must expand and the other
contract normal to this interface (the tetragonal distor-
tion). When we prepare a cross section TEM specimen,
we might then imagine it relaxing at the surface as shown
in Figure 24.13B. The reason for the relaxation is simply
that this allows the onematerial to expandwhile the other
</p>
<p>FIGURE 24.12. Since both thickness fringes and bend contours (X andY)
</p>
<p>affect the contrast seen in the image, and both can occur in the same part of
</p>
<p>the specimen, they can affect, or couple with, one another to give the
</p>
<p>complex contrast shown in this BF image. Along the line A&ndash;A, s changes
</p>
<p>in sign, being approximately zero at O and negative between the contours.
</p>
<p>ON THICKNESS DETERMINATION
Be careful when using fringes for determining t to use
in XEDS analysis, since only the thickness of the
diffracting (crystalline) material is determined.
There may be amorphous material on the surface
which has similar or different composition.

</p>
<p>interface while (C) [020] is normal to it. If planes parallel to the interface
</p>
<p>bend to relax the strain caused by the lattice misfit, then only the 020
</p>
<p>image will be affected, giving a more abrupt contrast change.

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>contracts; the constraint at the surface has been removed
during the specimen preparation process. This argument
is admittedly simplistic, but Figure 24.13B and C shows
that images recorded with g=020 normal to this inter-
face do indeed appear sharper than images formed when
g=200 is parallel to the interface.
</p>
<p>So, no matter whether g is 020 or 0�20, the Bragg
planes are bent closer to s=0 at one surface or the other.
</p>
<p>Here the bending only occurs within a short distance
of the interface but it significantly affects the appear-
ance of the DF image. The bending is actually making
the image appear sharper than it should.
</p>
<p>This example is special but emphasizes the point:
relaxation at the surface can cause the diffracting planes
to bend and this bending will affect the appearance of
your image.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The effects of changes in thickness and specimen bending are both explained by equation
24.1. Although this equation was derived for a two-beam geometry, you&rsquo;ll see similar effects
when more strongly excited beams are present but the simple sin2 dependence will be lost.
</p>
<p>&amp; Varying t while keeping s constant gives thickness fringes.
&amp; Varying s while keeping t constant gives bend contours.
</p>
<p>Thickness fringes are an interference effect and, with care, can be used to calculate the
foil thickness and reveal the topography.
</p>
<p>Note that if the two surfaces of the specimen are parallel, then we don&rsquo;t see thickness
fringes, even if the specimen is tilted. However, the contrast of that region will depend on the
projected thickness.
</p>
<p>Bend contours are very useful because they map out the value of s in the specimen. If
your foil is bent around more than one axis, bend contours can combine to produce
beautiful ZAPs which reflect the true symmetry of the material.
</p>
<p>However, if youwant to keep the defect analysis simple, then you need to avoid specimen
bending and work in relatively thin regions of nearly constant thickness. There are excep-
tions to this rule: in a few special cases where you want to do exactly the opposite! So the
message is that bending and thickness variations give you extra parameters that you can use
in your study as long as you can control these parameters. This control comes from
mastering the BF/DF/SAD techniques in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>Last, be aware that anomalous absorption is not anomalous. It can best (only) be
explained by Bloch wave interactions.

<p>Planar Defects
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Internal interfaces (grain boundaries, phase boundaries, stacking faults) or external inter-
faces (i.e., surfaces) are surely the most important defects in crystalline engineering materi-
als. Their common feature is that we can usually think of them as all being two-dimensional,
or planar, defects (even though they&rsquo;re not really). The main topics of this chapter will be
</p>
<p>&amp; Characterizing which type of internal interface we have and determining its main
parameters.
</p>
<p>&amp; Identifying lattice translations at these interfaces from the appearance of the diffraction-
contrast images.
</p>
<p>Rotations are usually associated with line defects and they will be discussed in Chapter
26. We can&rsquo;t usually identify the details of the local structure of an interface unless we use
HRTEM, so we will return to that topic in Chapter 28. We&rsquo;ll talk a little about simulating
images of these defects because it is relatively direct and instructive.
</p>
<p>25.1 TRANSLATIONS AND ROTATIONS
</p>
<p>This section is a brief summary of some fundamentals of
materials science. If the concepts are not immediately
familiar to you, then go and study an introductory text-
book on defects in materials, several of which are in the
reference section.
</p>
<p>An interface is simply a surface which separates any
two distinct regions of the microstructure. For most of
our discussion, we will make the assumption that the
surface is flat and is thus a planar (parallel to a plane)
defect, though this is rarely the case. We can sketch a
general interface as shown in Figure 25.1
</p>
<p>With this general definition, we can summarize the
different classes of planar defects
</p>
<p>&amp; Translation boundary, RB. Any translation R(r) is
allowed, y is zero, and both regions are identical
and thus perfectly aligned. Stacking faults (SFs) are
a special case. We&rsquo;ll denote the translation boundary
as RB so as to avoid confusing it with the twin
boundary (TB).
</p>
<p>&amp; Grain boundary, GB.Any values of R(r), n, and y are
allowed (n is the normal to the defect plane), but the
chemistry and structure of the two grains must be the
same. The SF is again a special case, but this class
also includes TBs.
</p>
<p>&amp; Phase boundary, PB. As for a GB, but the chemistry
and/or structure of the two regions can differ.
</p>
<p>&amp; Surface. A special case of a PB where one phase is
vacuum or gas.
</p>
<p>DEFINE R(r)
The upper crystal is held fixed while the lower one is
translated by a vector R(r) and/or rotated through
some angle y about any axis, v.
</p>

<p>normal is m.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Now with each of these groups, we can have
special examples. We will list some of the most
common examples in Table 25.1, including those
that we will consider in this chapter. For a more
detailed discussion, we refer you to the general refer-
ences at the end of the chapter.
</p>
<p>RBs include the familiar SFs found in fcc, hcp, dia-
mond-cubic, and layer materials. They have been widely
studied because they play an important role in the
mechanical properties of the fcc metals, e.g., Cu and
stainless steel. They are also found in more complex
materials such as spinels, Ni3Al, Ti3Al, etc., where the
lattice parameters, and therefore the dislocation Burgers
vectors, are large.
</p>
<p>The anti-phase boundary (APB) in ordered CuAu
(which we can describe as two interpenetrating simple-
cubic superlattices) is produced by translating one
superlattice by 1
</p>
<p>2
51114 with respect to the other. It is
</p>
<p>called an APB because one superlattice is out of phase
with the other. If the crystal were disordered and the Cu
and Au occupied the bcc sites randomly, then 1
</p>
<p>2
51114
</p>
<p>would be a lattice vector and no defect would exist. This
particular APB can thus be regarded as an SF. We will
find that the methods used to characterize RBs can
often be used to determine R(r) in other interfaces.
</p>
<p>GBs fall into two groups, low angle and high angle.
Low-angle boundaries necessarily involve a rotation
through a small angle that is usually accommodated
by arrays of dislocations; we&rsquo;ll consider these defects in
Chapter 26. High-angle boundaries can adopt some
special values of n and y; a large fraction of lattice sites
in one grain is then shared by (is common to) the other
grain. We characterize the fraction by the inverse of this
fraction, which we call S. For example, the common
</p>
<p>twin boundary in fcc metals is theS=3 grain boundary
(the fraction is 1
</p>
<p>3
). The reason this is important to our
</p>
<p>discussion is that if a set of lattice points is common to
two grains (as implied by the S coincidence-site lattice
concept), then certain planes may also be common and
may give rise to common reflections. These reflections
will remain common even if one grain is translated
relative to the other. In that case, we&rsquo;ll have a special
type of RB, called the rigid-body translation. Rigid-
body translations in grain boundaries behave just like
other SFs except R is usually small and is not directly
related to the lattice parameters.
</p>
<p>There is a second group of APBs where the two grains
cannot be related by a translation. These occur in GaAs,
ZnO,AlN, and SiC, for example. One lattice can always be
related to the other by a rotation of 1808 to give the equiva-
lent of an inversion; they are sometimes knownas inversion
domain boundaries (IDBs). (They are S &frac14; 1 GBs.) These
special interfaces can often be seen in the image because
there is usually a small associated translation. We analyze
this translation as if it were a simple RB because all the
planes on one side of the IDB are parallel to their counter-
parts in the other; the (hkl) plane on one side is parallel to
the �h�k�l on theother.Wecan&rsquo;t distinguishg from�g unlesswe
use CBED or we have a great specimen for HRTEM.
</p>
<p>PBs are rarely (if ever) analyzed fully using diffrac-
tion contrast. If the orientation, chemistry, and struc-
ture can all change on crossing the boundary, then not
only will the reflections change, but all extinction dis-
tances will change too. Some special examples of such
interfaces are hcp-Co/fcc-Co, bcc-Fe/fcc-Fe, NiO/
NiFe2O4, and GaAs/AlxGa1&ndash;xAs. Of course, the num-
ber of other such interfaces is countless.
</p>
<p>Surface studies using TEMhave quite recently become
very important although the experimental tools have been
available for some time. We will discuss surfaces in this
chapter insofar as they are imaged by diffraction contrast.
So-called profile imaging will follow in Chapter 28 on
HRTEM. The other two surface-sensitive techniques
are plan-view and reflection electron microscopy (REM,
see Chapter 29).

<p>25.2 WHY DO TRANSLATIONS PRODUCE
CONTRAST?
</p>
<p>As usual, we will start our analysis considering only
two beams, O and G. Our approach will use hand-
waving arguments, which are not perfect, to justify
adapting the Howie-Whelan equations for specimens
containing interfaces. We&rsquo;ll use the same approach for
other defects in Chapters 26 and 27. Because the
Howie-Whelan equations for perfect crystals assume
two-beam conditions, we are able to solve them analyt-
ically. We&rsquo;d like to be able to do the same when defects
are present, because this gives us a physical under-
standing of the processes which produce the contrast.
There are two important features that we will need to
keep in mind
</p>
<p>&amp; Diffraction contrast only occurs because we have
Bloch waves in the crystal. However, our analysis
will initially only consider diffracted beams.
</p>
<p>&amp; Wemake the column approximation so we can solve
the equations; we must be wary whenever the speci-
men or the diffraction conditions change within a
distance comparable to the column diameter.
</p>
<p>A unit cell in a strained crystal will be displaced from
its perfect-crystal position so that it is located at position
r0n instead of rn where n is included to remind us that we
are considering scattering from an array of unit cells;
we&rsquo;ll soon omit the n (and we still have the column
approximation)
</p>
<p>r0n &frac14; rn &thorn; Rn (25:1)
</p>
<p>In this expression, Rn is actually Rn(r); it can vary
throughout the specimen. The term e2piK.r in equation
13.3 (it&rsquo;s actuallyKrn) now becomes e
</p>
<p>2piK.r0 so we need to
examine the term K .r
</p>
<p>0
. We know that K is g+ s, so we
</p>
<p>can write
</p>
<p>K:r0n&frac14; g&thorn;s&eth; &THORN;� rn&thorn;Rn&eth; &THORN;&frac14;g:rn&thorn;g:Rn&thorn;s:rn&thorn;s:Rn (25:2)
</p>
<p>Now since rn is a lattice vector, g .rn is an integer as
usual. The third term, s .rn gives our usual sz term so
the new terms are g .Rn and s .Rn.
</p>
<p>Whenwe discuss strong-beam images we know that s
is very small. Since we are using elasticity theory Rn
must be small. Hence we ignore the term s .Rn. Remem-
ber that we have made a special assumption which may
not be valid in two situations
</p>
<p>&amp; When s is large; we&rsquo;ll encounter this when we discuss
the weak-beam technique in Chapter 27.
</p>
<p>&amp; When the lattice distortion, R, is large; this occurs
close to the cores of some defects.
</p>
<p>We now modify equation 13.8 intuitively to include
the effect of adding a displacement from equation 25.2
</p>
<p>dfg

<p>dz
&frac14;

<p>xg
fg exp &thorn;2pi sz&thorn; g :R&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � (25:4)
</p>
<p>Next, we simplify these equations just as we did in
Chapter 13 by setting
</p>
<p>f0 z&eth; &THORN; sub&eth; &THORN;&frac14; f0 exp
�piz

piz
</p>
<p>x0
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(25:6)
</p>
<p>Then the Howie-Whelan equations become
</p>
<p>df0 sub&eth; &THORN;

</p>
<p>&frac14; pi
xg
</p>
<p>fg sub&eth; &THORN; exp 2pig :R&eth; &THORN; (25:7)

xg
</p>
<p>f0 sub&eth; &THORN; exp �2pig �R&eth; &THORN; &thorn; 2pisfg sub&eth; &THORN; (25:8)
</p>
<p>These equations are just as before (equations 13.14 and
13.15) but with the addition of the 2pig.R term. This
additional phase is termed a, hence planar defects are
seen when a 6&frac14; 0.
</p>
<p>a &frac14; 2pg :R (25:9)
</p>
<p>These expressions will be particularly useful in two cases
</p>
<p>&amp; When R = constant.
&amp; Understanding phasor diagrams when defects are
present.
</p>
<p>We start with a simple stacking fault lying parallel to
the surface as shown in Figure 25.2. In this situation, the
beams propagate through the upper layer just as if no
fault were present. At a depth z = t1, the beams may
experience a phase change due to the effect of the
</p>
<p>TEM OF SURFACES
The techniques are (i) profile imaging, (ii) plan-view
imaging, and (iii) reflection electronmicroscopy (REM).

<p>translationR, but after that they again propagate as if in
perfect crystal.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll see several values of a. A special
case occurs when a = �1208. This value of a is often
encountered since it occurs for fcc SFs. We&rsquo;ll also
encounter the case where a=�1808; this value arises
for some special APBs which are really SFs.
</p>
<p>25.3 THE SCATTERING MATRIX
</p>
<p>This discussion of the scattering matrix introduces no
new concepts. It is just a different way of writing the
equations so that if you are calculating the image con-
trast, you can program the computer more easily, espe-
cially when you have complicated arrays of lattice
defects. Our reason for delaying the introduction of
the scattering matrix until now is that it is much easier
to understand when you can apply it to a specific
problem.
</p>
<p>In equations 13.17&ndash;13.20, we showed that in the two-
beam case, we can write these simple expressions for f0
and fg
</p>
<p>f0 &frac14; C0e
2pigz (25:10)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>fg &frac14; Cge
2pigz (25:11)
</p>
<p>Since there are two values for g, we can express both
the 0 and g beams as the combination of these two
contributions to give
</p>
<p>f0 z&eth; &THORN; &frac14; C

</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(25:13)
</p>
<p>where the c(i) terms tell us the relative contributions of
the g(1) and g(2) terms. (We are really saying that both
Bloch waves contribute to both the 0 and g beams.) We
can rewrite equations 25.12 and 25.13 in a matrix form.
(This is the key step.)

<p>2&eth; &THORN; &frac14; fg 0&eth; &THORN; (25:16)
</p>
<p>which we can now rewrite as

</p>
<p>fg 0&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p> !
</p>
<p>(25:17)
</p>
<p>(We actually saw in Section 13.9 that f0(0) is 1 and
fg(0) is 0 because z = 0 is the top surface.) We know
from Chapters 13 and 14 that the elements of the
matrix C are determined by the two-beam conditions
that we set up. The matrix C does not depend on z.
Now we can use matrix algebra to solve equation
25.17. First rewrite it as
</p>
<p>C

<p>c 2&eth; &THORN;

<p>Therefore we can rewrite equation 25.14 as

<p>f0 z&eth; &THORN;

f0 0&eth; &THORN;
fg 0&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p> !
</p>
<p>(25:20)
</p>
<p>Finally, we can define a new matrix P(z) as the scatter-
ing matrix for a slice of perfect material with thickness z

</p>
<p>The matrix P(z) thus gives us the values of the exit wave
amplitudes at the bottom of the slice in terms of the
incident values. In other words, the matrix P(z) includes
all the information to describe the propagation of the
beams through the crystal; P(z) is a propagator matrix.
</p>
<p>25.4 USING THE SCATTERING MATRIX
</p>
<p>Now we illustrate the real strength of the scattering
matrix approach by considering the effect of a planar
fault lying parallel to the foil surface, as we saw in
Figure 25.2. The idea is that we now have two slices of
material of thickness t1 and t2. We can easily calculate
f0(t1) and fg(t1) using equation 25.20. These values for
f0 andfg then become the incident values for slice 2. The
effect of the translationR is tomultiply the terms inCg in
the lower slice by a phase factor exp (&ndash;ia)wherea&frac14; 2pg� R
as usual. The matrix C for slice 2 is then written as
</p>
<p>C2 &frac14;

</p>
<p>1&eth; &THORN;

<p>2&eth; &THORN;

</p>
<p>2&eth; &THORN;
g exp ia&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p> !
</p>
<p>(25:22)
</p>
<p>We can write down the expression for f0(t) and fg(t) as
</p>
<p>f0 t&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>fg t&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p> !
</p>
<p>&frac14; C2G t2&eth; &THORN;C

</p>
<p>f0 0&eth; &THORN;
fg 0&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p> !
</p>
<p>(25:23)
</p>
<p>Here the subscripts on C1 and C2 just identify the slices.
Normally, this equation goes straight into the comput-
er, which handles matrices very easily. However, we&rsquo;ll
go back and consider a few special points
</p>
<p>&amp; Look at equation 25.22 and set R = 0 so that C2 =
C1. You can see that P(t) = P(t1)P(t2). Clearly
we could cut the perfect-crystal specimen into
</p>
<p>many slices and P(t) would always be the product of
the scattering matrices for each slice. (We could call
this a multislice approach to scattering from a crystal
but we don&rsquo;t to avoid confusion with HRTEM
simulation.)
</p>
<p>&amp; How do we prove equation 25.22? From equation
14.12 we know that a Bloch wave can be written as
</p>
<p>b k&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
X
</p>
<p>g
</p>
<p>Cg k&eth; &THORN; exp 2pi k&thorn; g&eth; &THORN; : r&eth; &THORN; (25:24)
</p>
<p>&amp; If the lower crystal is displaced by a vectorR then we
replace r by r &ndash;R (notice the sign). (We have just used
a &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; column approximation.) Equation 25.24
is then written as
</p>
<p>b k&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
X
</p>
<p>g
</p>
<p>Cg k&eth; &THORN; exp 2pi k&thorn; g&eth; &THORN; : r� R&eth; &THORN;&eth; &THORN; (25:25)
</p>

<p>g
</p>
<p>Cg k&eth; &THORN;e �2pig:r&eth; &THORN;e2pi k&thorn;g&eth; &THORN; : r (25:26)
</p>
<p>C0 is not affected by R since than 2p0 .R=0, but Cg
is multiplied by e�ia.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you choose the coordinates appropriately thenC is
a unitary matrix. In this case, you can find C�1 just
by reflecting across the diagonal and taking the com-
plex conjugate of each term. This trickwill allow you
to express equation 25.23 explicitly, as given by
Hirsch et al. (omitting a phase factor).

<p>In equations 25.27 and 25.28, t0 is the distance of the
fault below the center of the slice, i.e., we define t0=t1&ndash; t/2
where t1 lies between 0 and t. (It&rsquo;s a good, but tedious,
exercise to derive these equations for yourself.) The
right-hand side of equations 25.27 and 25.28 each con-
tains three terms.
</p>
<p>&amp; The first term is just what we found in Chapter 13
where the phase factor a = 0, i.e., it&rsquo;s just like the
perfect crystal.
</p>
<p>&amp; The second term is independent of the position of the
planar fault because it doesn&rsquo;t depend on t0.
</p>
<p>P = C G C&ndash;1 AND VARIES WITH z
Notice that z only enters the &lsquo;P equation&rsquo; through the
G matrix.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; The third term depends on t0 such that both f0 and
fg change with a periodicity in t
</p>
<p>0 given by Dk&ndash;1. So
these amplitudes show the same dependence on xg
</p>
<p>eff.
They will both show thickness variations.
</p>
<p>We can now take these ideas and apply them to
planar defects which are inclined to the surface, by
calculating the contrast for all values of t0 between 0
and t. The important points to remember are
</p>
<p>&amp; The model used in the calculation was a flat interface
parallel to the surface of a plate-like specimen. You&rsquo;ll
see fault fringes when t0 varies across the fault but you
don&rsquo;t usually have to consider the fact that either the
surface or the fault may be inclined to the beam.
</p>
<p>&amp; The concept of the scattering matrix allows you to
identify very clearly the effect of the defect on f0 and
fg.
</p>
<p>25.5 STACKING FAULTS IN FCC
MATERIALS
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll begin our discussion of actual examples with the
SF in fcc materials. Before we discuss the details of
contrast from SFs in fcc materials, we&rsquo;ll summarize the
important results which hold for all planar defects
</p>
<p>&amp; The appearance of the image depends on the speci-
men thickness.
</p>
<p>&amp; Pairs of BF/DF SF images are not generally com-
plementary even though we are using a two-beam
approximation. Compare to the complementary
behavior of the thickness fringes discussed in
Chapter 24.
</p>
<p>&amp; Planar defects always really have a thickness. We&rsquo;ll
illustrate this concept using overlapping faults in fcc
materials (see also Section 26.6).
</p>
<p>25.5.A Why fcc Materials?
</p>
<p>There are several reasons for emphasizing the analysis
of stacking faults in fcc crystals
</p>
<p>&amp; Many important materials are fcc, including the
metals Cu, Ag, Au, and austenitic stainless steel,
and the semiconductors Si, Ge, and GaAs.
</p>
<p>&amp; Most of the analysis of SFs derives from the study of
fcc materials.
</p>
<p>&amp; The translations are well known and directly
related to the lattice parameter: R is either
1=65�1�124or 1=351114. Notice that these defini-
tions differ by the lattice vector, 1=251104. (Actu-
ally there may be small deviations from these ideal
values but we&rsquo;ll ignore them for now.)
</p>
<p>We want to learn how to extend this analysis to
other fault vectors and avoid making unfounded
assumptions when we do extend it. The geometry
often encountered when studying defects in fcc materi-
als is shown in Figure 25.3.
</p>
<p>You should note that (11�1) is one of three possible
planes for an inclined SF. In this case, the translation at
the stacking fault will be R &frac14; �1=3&frac12;11�1�; the phase fac-
tor, a, is 2p g .R. If we form an image with the g &frac14; &eth;2�20&THORN;
reflection strongly excited then g .R = 0 and the fault
is out of contrast in both BF and DF. If instead we use
the reflection g &frac14; &eth;02�2&THORN; then g:R &frac14; 4=3 or �4=3 and
a &frac14; 8p=3 &frac14; 2p=3 &frac14; 120� or �8p=3 &frac14; �2p=3 &frac14; �120�
(modulo 2p in each case). Notice that if the stacking
fault lies parallel to the surface of this (111)-oriented
specimen, you must tilt the specimen to see any contrast
from the SF, i.e., g .R= 0 for all values of g lying in the
fault plane.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.4A and B shows two typical BF/DF pairs
of �g strong-beam images from the same SF. In the BF
images, the outer fringes are the same on both sides of
the fault, both gray or both white while in the DF images
one outer fringe is white but the other is gray. The
questions which arise are
</p>
<p>THE GEOMETRY
You should keep in mind that we derived these equa-
tions for a planar defect lying parallel to the parallel
surfaces of our specimen and normal to the beam.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 25.3. A stacking fault in a parallel-sided fcc specimen. The
</p>
<p>normal to the specimen is [111] and the normal to the SF is [11�1]. T and
</p>
<p>B indicate the top and bottom of the foil.
</p>
<p>INVISIBILITY CRITERION
When g .R = 0 the defect is &lsquo;out of contrast&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s
invisible.
</p>
<p>NOT ALL MATERIALS ARE FCC
Do not assume all faults are the same as in fcc
materials!

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; What determines whether a fringe will be gray or
white?
</p>
<p>&amp; Why are the two images not complementary?
</p>
<p>Note that in the summary schematic shown in Figure
25.4E, 200, 222, and 440 are type A reflections while
111, 220, and 400 are type B reflections. Also we&rsquo;ll call
the first fringe gray (G), not black (i.e., B), to reduce
confusion!
</p>
<p>25.5.B Some Rules
</p>
<p>There are some experimental rules
</p>
<p>&amp; Be very careful when you record such a pair of
images: record the DP for each image. Be sure to
note which of the two bright spots corresponds to
the direct beam.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use the same strong hkl reflection for BF and DF
imaging. Therefore, to form the CDF image using a
strong hkl reflection, you must first tilt the specimen
so that �h�k�l is strong and then use the beam tilts to
move hkl onto the optic axis where it will become
strong (see Section 22.5). This is confusing, so we
recommend that you sacrifice a little image resolu-
tion and compare the BF image with a displaced-
aperture DF (DADF) image, rather than a CDF
image.
</p>
<p>This is exactly the opposite of the approach used by
Edington, who advocates tilting in �h�k�l for theDF image,
which reverses the DF contrast in Figure 25.4E and F.
Our approach ensures that diffraction from the same hkl
planes causes the contrast in both DF and CDF images
but DADF beats both! (TEMs were not as good in 1975
as they are now.)
</p>
<p>Then there are some rules for interpreting the
contrast
</p>
<p>&amp; In the image, as seen on the screen or on a print, the
fringe corresponding to the top surface (T) is white in
BF if g�R is &gt; 0 and black if g�R &lt; 0.
</p>
<p>&amp; Using the same strong hkl reflection for BF and DF
imaging, the fringe from the bottom (B) of the fault
will be complementary whereas the fringe from the
top (T) will be the same in both the BF and DF
images.
</p>
<p>&amp; The central fringes fade away as the thickness
increases. If this seems anomalous, the explanation
is in Section 25.10.
</p>
<p>&amp; The reason it is important to know the sign of g is
that you will use this information to determine the
sign of R.
</p>
<p>&amp; For the geometry shown in Figure 25.3, if the
origin of the g vector is placed at the center of
the SF in the DF image, the vector g points away
from the bright outer fringe if the fault is extrinsic
and toward it if it is intrinsic (200, 222, and 440
reflections); if the reflection is a 400, 111, or 220
the reverse is the case.

<p>25 .5 STACKING FAULTS IN FCC MATER IAL S ....................................................................................................................................... 425</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Don&rsquo;t forget that, as we said at the start of Chapter
22, any contrast must be &gt;�5&ndash;10% to be visible to
the eye, so we traditionally say an intensity change
due to g.R effects is only detectable if g .R&gt; 0.02; of
course, now you can digitally record the TEM image
or digitize your analog version and then process this
so the limit could be lower. With experience, you&rsquo;ll
find there is an optimum thickness to view defect
contrast, before absorption effects make it difficult.
You must also carefully select s so that the back-
ground intensity in the matrix around the defect is
gray and this maximizes visibility of lighter and dark-
er fringes.
</p>
<p>As we said, these complex rules are summarized in
Figure 25.4C and D. Although they are very useful, in
practice you should remember that they were derived
for a very special combination of R and g in fcc materi-
als. Some important examples of g .R are given in Table
25.2. As we&rsquo;ll describe in Section 25.11, if this is your
research, you should use a computer program to check
the contrast.
</p>
<p>25.5.C Intensity Calculations
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s consider intensity calculations using the col-
umn approximation, which we briefly discussed in Sec-
tion 13.11. If the fault cuts the column at a depth t1 we
can deduce from equations 25.22 and 25.23 that

</p>

<p>We rearrange equation 25.30 to give an expression for
the intensity, Ig (=fg�fg*). This rearrangement
involves a little manipulation.

</p>
<p>where t0=t1&ndash; t/2 as before. So the contrast depends on
both the thickness and the depth. Note that t/2 is the
center of the foil. Since a is fixed for a particular defect,
let&rsquo;s fix t. Then equation 25.31 becomes

<p>Ig /

</p>
<p>s2
A� B cos 2pst0&eth; &THORN;f g (25:32)
</p>
<p>Now we have cosine depth fringes or defect thickness
fringes, just as we did for the perfect crystal
</p>
<p>&amp; The thickness periodicity depends on s&ndash;1.
&amp; The intensity varies as s&ndash;2.
</p>
<p>We could have derived this equation from equation
25.28 with more work. However, the value of the scat-
tering matrix approach is that we don&rsquo;t derive the ana-
lytical expression but just run the computer program.
</p>
<p>In Chapter 27, we will discuss this SF contrast in
terms of phasor diagrams which give a graphical way to
represent these equations.
</p>
<p>25.5.D Overlapping Faults
</p>
<p>It is interesting to extend this analysis to the case of
overlapping faults. Taking the analytical approach, we
can extend equation 25.29 to the case of two overlap-
ping faults, the first at depth t1 and the second at
depth t2.

</p>
<p>An experimental illustration of a somewhat more
complex situation, involving several overlapping SFs,
is shown in Figure 25.5
</p>
<p>&amp; It sometimes appears that there is no contrast, even
when we know that there are overlapping SFs. This
can happen if, e.g., three SFs overlap on adjacent
(or nearly adjacent) planes; then the effective R can
</p>
<p>DISPLACE THE APERTURE
To avoid the possibility of confusion about which
reflection to use for the DF image, just displace the
aperture to the strong hkl reflection in every case. In a
modern IVEM, there is almost no loss of resolution
between DADF and CDF. DADF is always pre-
ferred but CDF is used to give much better images.

</p>
<p>We will return to this topic in Section 27.8, where
we&rsquo;ll show that some planar defects, such as the extrinsic
SF in Si, or the dissociated {112} twin boundary in some
fcc metals, really have a significant thickness. We can
then analyze the contrast from such interfaces using the
overlapping-fault model.
</p>
<p>25.6 OTHER TRANSLATIONS: p AND d
FRINGES
</p>
<p>We discussed the L10 structure of NiAl in Section 16.5.
This intermetallic is an example of a large group of
materials which can contain a different type of RB. If
the Ni atoms sit at the corners of the cell in one crystal
region but the Al atoms sit at the corners in another part
of the crystal, then the two crystal regions are related by
a translation of 1
</p>
<p>2
&frac12;111�. The two crystals would other-
</p>
<p>wise still be perfectly aligned but are separated by this
RB, which we call an APB (but which could be called an
SF or an IDB).
</p>
<p>Similarly in the L12 structure of the intermetallicNi3Al,
we could have theAl atoms on the corners of the unit cell in
one part of the crystal and displaced by R &frac14; 1
</p>
<p>2
&frac12;110� in the
</p>
<p>adjacent region. (We can actually form six non-equivalent
APBs in this structure and these are not IDBs.) The crystal
structure looks like fcc but the Al atoms are at the corners
of the unit cell (forming the simple-cubic superlattice) with
the Ni at the face-centered positions. The easy way to
appreciate this RB is to think what would happen if the
alloywere completely disordered: therewould be no planar
defect. This RB can be imaged using the (100) reflection.
Notice again that for a disordered structure, the {100}
reflections would be absent if the alloy were disordered;
the {100} planes are said to give rise to superlattice reflec-
tions; these reflections would be forbidden if the material
were disordered. For this case we can readily show that the
phase factor a = p, so the fringes we see are called p
fringes. The structure of this interface is shown schemati-
cally in Figure 25.6. These p fringes can give symmetric
fringes in DF and BF and complementary DF/DF pairs.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 25.5. Two BF images of overlapping SFs in fcc steel with the
</p>
<p>direction g indicated. The faults are very close together.When three faults
</p>
<p>overlap at F the effective value of R is 0 so the contrast disappears.
</p>
<p>SUPERLATTICES
We usually use the term superlattice in the sense that
it is the real lattice, because we have ordering of the
components. If the samematerial was disordered (but
with the atoms on the same sites), the lattice param-
eters, in real space, would be smaller.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 25.6. Schematic of an interface in the intermetallic Ni3Al show-
</p>
<p>ing how the two structures link coherently but are displaced by the vector
</p>
<p>R. The phase factor at such an interface is p and the fringes seen in the
</p>
<p>image are called p fringes.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Similar RBs are very common in oxides because the unit
cell is often quite large, giving more opportunities to form
such interfaces. The interface shown inFigure 25.7A and B
has been called both an SF and an APB in spinel. These
interfaces can show all the features we discussed in
Section 25.5 for SFs in fcc materials, and those we&rsquo;ve
just discussed depend on which reflection you use. You
can again see a change in contrast in Figure 25.7D
when APBs in TiO2 overlap as shown schematically
in Figure 25.7E (Amelinckx and Van Landuyt 1978).
In Figure 25.7A and B, if you image the fault using the
220 reflection 2pg�R=p and so you&rsquo;ll see SF fringes. If,
however, you image using 440, 2pg�R=2p, so you&rsquo;ll
only see residual contrast (becauseR is not exactly 1

&frac12;101�:
</p>
<p>The APB shown in Figure 25.8A is different yet
again. This planar defect in GaAs is also known as an
IDB (Section 25.1). The fringes you see are caused by a
translation, but R is not related in a simple way to the
structure of the crystal or to the inversion symmetry.
Rasmussen et al. showed that the translation is present
because there is a small relaxation of the Ga&ndash;Ga and
As&ndash;As bonds at this {110} interface. The value of R was
determined to be 0.19 Å with a statistical uncertainty of
�0.03 Å, so it&rsquo;s a translation that&rsquo;s almost parallel to the

<p>interface, as shown schematically in Figure 25.8B. These
fringes are then known as d fringes (because there is only
a small translation and a is not related in a simple way to
2p). The use of image-simulation programs, which are
necessary to determine R (remember that the wave-
length of the 200-kV electrons used for themeasurement
is itself 0.025 Å or 2.5 pm), is discussed in Section 25.13.
</p>
<p>25.7 PHASE BOUNDARIES
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll list a few special phase boundaries in Table 25.3.
</p>
<p>An example of a PB is shown in Figure 25.9. In NiO,
which is ferromagnetic, some of the planes rotate
slightly when the structure changes from cubic symme-
try below the Curie temperature. Now we can also
define the cubic structure as rhombohedral with a= 608
in the rhombohedron. Below the Curie temperature, the
rhombohedral angle is distorted by only 4.20 (yes, min-
utes of arc) from the true 608. Therefore, most g-vectors
will rotate through a very small angle and hence produce
a change in the value of s. However, as you can see in
Figure 25.9, this small rotation can readily be detected
by the change in contrast and the faint fringes at the
phase boundary.
</p>
<p>We can have overlapping PBs, so, the warning is the
same: be very wary and use tilting experiments while you
are at the TEM.

<p>25.8 ROTATION BOUNDARIES
</p>
<p>What can we learn about rotation boundaries when
the rotation angle is greater than about 0.18? Unfor-
tunately, the answer is &lsquo;&lsquo;not a lot,&rsquo;&rsquo; unless we have
defects which accommodate the rotation. Then we
are into the subject of diffraction contrast of line
defects in interfaces. However, with care you may be
able to excite g in one grain or in both by tilting the
</p>
<p>specimen. The difficulty, of course, is that sg is likely
to be different in each material. Complications will
also arise if other defects are present, since you may
or may not see those defects. Examples of such
inclined, rotation interfaces are shown schematically
in Figure 25.10A and experimentally in Figure
25.10B and C.
</p>
<p>25.9 DIFFRACTION PATTERNS AND
DISPERSION SURFACES
</p>
<p>You read in Chapter 17, that what you see in an image
must be related to what happens in the DPwhich in turn
is determined by how the Ewald sphere intersects the
reciprocal lattice. Figure 17.5 showed that a planar
defect which is inclined to the surface of a parallel-
sided specimen will give rise to relrods. Therefore, a
planar defect that is inclined to the surface of a paral-
lel-sided specimen will produce at least two spots in the
DP. Since most specimens are wedges (see Figure 17.4),
and the planar defect will, in general, be inclined to both
surfaces, the relrod geometry is actually even more com-
plex. Figure 25.11 shows lines normal to each interface
and their associated relrods. You can appreciate that
when the Ewald sphere cuts these relrods, several spots
may appear in the DP. Now we need to relate these
relrods to the fringes we see in the image. This model
would predict that we would not produce fringes when
s=0, so we should modify what we did in Figure 17.15.
The periodicity of the fringes in the image is inversely
related to the distances (M1N and M2N) between the
spots in the DP.

<p>wedge merge into the thickness fringes associated with the inclined inter-
</p>
<p>face. (C) If the foil is tilted so that the same (though not coincident)
</p>
<p>reflection is excited in both grains, the number of fringes in the interface

At s = 0, the thickness fringe spacing is determined
by Dk= xg

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When a planar defect is present in the specimen, the two
branches of the dispersion surface are not only coupled
along a tie-line normal to the surface of the specimen but
also along the normal to the planar defect. However,
when s = 0, the thickness periodicity in the image
corresponds to the extinction distance. When we relate
this to the region G in the reciprocal lattice, the two
relrods (which result from a kinematical construction)
must actually separate to give the two hyperbolas shown
in Figure 25.12 which is why we drew Figures 17.15 and
23.6 as we did.
</p>
<p>The spots in the DP are associated with points M
and N in Figures 25.11 and 25.12.
</p>
<p>25.10 BLOCH WAVES AND BF/DF IMAGE
PAIRS
</p>
<p>In Chapter 14 we saw that, in a crystal, the electronmust
propagate as Bloch waves, and yet we have not men-
tioned Bloch waves in our discussion of thickness and
bending so far. Most of the analysis of this topic is
beyond the scope of this text, but it is important to
understand the basic ideas, particularly since they will
also apply to scattering from defects in the crystals.
Remember that xg is a direct consequence of having
two Bloch waves. The important message here is: don&rsquo;t
let the words overawe you.
</p>
<p>The idea is quite simple. Since we have two Bragg
beams excited, then we must have two Bloch waves in
the crystal. The propagation vectors of these two waves
are k1 and k2 with the difference |Dk| being related to
seff (and g1&ndash;g2 in Section 13.10). We see a thickness
dependence in the image because the two waves are
interfering. The only two waves which are really pres-
ent in the crystal are the two Bloch waves. It&rsquo;s the
beating of these two waves which gives rise to thickness
effects.
</p>
<p>In the two-beam case, the Bloch waves, 1 and 2, are
channeled along and between the atom columns (see
Figure 14.2). A fault may change the channeled wave
into the non-channeled one, as you can see in Figure
25.13. So, the effect of the planar defect is to couple the

If you see fringes in the image, spots will be present in
the DP.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Bloch waves; in other words, the defect links (or con-
nects or ties) the different branches of the dispersion
surface (along the tie line). The non-complementary
contrast at SFs in fcc metals is directly explained by
this coupling.
</p>
<p>As soon as the beam enters the specimen we excite
Bloch waves 1 and 2. Therefore, in Figure 25.14A, the
two Bloch waves 1 and 2 are shown everywhere at the
top surface of the foil. The planar defect links pointsD1
andD2 on the two branches of the dispersion surface, as
shown in Figure 25.14B, along the tie line, D1D2
</p>
<p>0 and
D1
</p>
<p>0D2. We&rsquo;ll analyze the three situations shown in
Figure 25.14A, which correspond to the planar defect
being close to the top, the middle, and the bottom of the
specimen. The key feature is that, as we saw in Section
14.6, Bloch wave 1, which has the larger k-vector, will be
preferentially absorbed. It is actually totally absorbed in
thicker specimens.
</p>
<p>&amp; When the planar defect is close to the top surface (as
occurs near T in Figure 25.14A), waves 1 and 2 are
both coupled (or scattered) to the other branch of
the dispersion surface so we form four Bloch waves
(but with only two k-vectors). Both Bloch waves
which are associated with the upper branch of the
dispersion surface (wave vector k1) are preferentially
</p>
<p>absorbed, but the waves D2 and D2
0 both reach the
</p>
<p>lower surface. There, they interfere to give the thick-
ness fringes even though they are both associated
with the lower branch of the dispersion surface; D2
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>retains a &lsquo;memory&rsquo; of D1.
&amp; When the fault is close to the middle of the specimen
in Figure 25.14A, the branch-1 Bloch wave is
absorbed before it reaches the planar defect but a
new Bloch wave D1
</p>
<p>0 is formed at the defect. How-
ever, while traversing the other half of the foil, this
wave is also absorbed so that only wave D2 reaches
the lower surface. Thus the electrons can propagate
through the specimen (we can see through it) but
there are no thickness fringes because only one
Bloch wave survives. However, we can still image
defects in these thicker areas, as you&rsquo;ll see if you look
back at Figure 23.10.
</p>
<p>&amp; At the lower surface, B in Figure 25.14A, only wave
D1 survives to reach the planar defect but it now
produces a new wave D1
</p>
<p>0 which can reach the lower
surface, recombine with Bloch waveD2, and produce
thickness fringes. The resulting contrast is summar-
ized in Figure 25.14C.
</p>
<p>Bloch-wave absorption is a critical factor in explain-
ing the appearance of contrast from planar defects. The
part of this argument which is not intuitive is the fact
that D2
</p>
<p>0 retains a memory of D1; this memory allows it
to interfere withD2 to produce the thickness fringes near
the top of the specimen, even though no Bloch wave
from branch 1 reaches the bottomof the specimen.We&rsquo;ll
refer you to the article by Hashimoto et al. for further
discussion on this topic.
</p>
<p>25.11 COMPUTER MODELING
</p>
<p>From the discussion in Sections 25.5 and 25.6, you will
realize that a and p fringes are usually understandable
as long as you know what the defect is and as long as it&rsquo;s
not actually a set of overlapping defects. The contrast
from d fringes is much more complex and combinations
of a, p, and d fringes are difficult! The situation will
become even more complicated if you want to under-
stand the contrast occurring when other defects interact
with these planar faults.
</p>
<p>A computer program is then really the only way to
analyze the contrast from these defects. The problem
here is that many programs have been written for com-
puters that now only exist in museums, by researchers
who became professional programmers and never saw a
TEM image again.
</p>
<p>The first program to attempt the task of simulating
two-dimensional images (rather than line profiles) of
planar defects is described in the book by Head et al.
Two current software packages are CuFour and

<p>TEMACI. CuFour is the subject of an entire chapter in
the companion text; TEMACI incorporated the ideas
from Comis that we&rsquo;ll refer to here. We will mention
some of the features of these programs to help you select
one, but leave the detailed descriptions to the appropri-
ate manuals. The most important reason for using any
programmust be your desire to understand the contrast
and thus characterize the defect.
</p>
<p>These programs are tools to assist you toward the
goal of quantitative analysis of diffraction contrast, but
you always need the fully quantitative experimental
data, too. Few TEMusers have ever collected such data.
</p>
<p>You need an accurate simulation of the image you
see in the microscope. The fact that the image varies
with depth, thickness, g-vector, etc., is actually to your
advantage, since you then have many variables, all of
which you must be able to measure to achieve a good
match with your experimental image. From the point of
view of quantitative analysis, a one-dimensional line
(intensity) profile is as valid as a two-dimensional
image. Of course, if you can compare the contrast in
an image and a simulation point by point, then you can
have much greater confidence in the matching. The two-
dimensional simulated image is also more viewer-
friendly!
</p>
<p>A great advantage of more powerful computers is
that you can also test the effect of specimen geometry
more readily. Thus, for example, Viguier et al. showed,
using the CuFour simulation package, that the rules for
fringe contrast given by Gevers et al. will not work if the
specimen is tilted such that it intersects the bottomof the
foil above the point where it intersects the top! You can
understand this situation more easily by looking at the
specimen geometry shown in Figure 25.15.
</p>
<p>Image simulation tells us that g.Rmust be &gt; 0.02 to
produce visible fringes, and you don&rsquo;t need to know the
local structure at the planar defect when determining
this condition. You could, in principle, detect smaller
values of R by using larger g-vectors but in practice it
then becomes more difficult to set up a well-defined
diffraction geometry.
</p>
<p>The next two sections are rather specialized and you
may wish to leave them until much later, especially if
you don&rsquo;t have access to a suitable program or until you
are prepared to write your own. Do consult the key
references and list of available programs in Section 1.6
before writing your own program. The subject is just as
relevant to the topics of Chapters 26 and 27, but we
include it in this chapter mainly because the analysis of
planar defects is the most straightforward application.
</p>
<p>25.12 THE GENERALIZED CROSS
SECTION
</p>
<p>Head et al. presented amethod and a computer program
for the computation of BF and DF images of line and
planar defects. The source code is given in their book
and is available from the WWW. You should note
several important features of this program
</p>
<p>&amp; It uses the two-beam theory of electron diffraction.
&amp; It uses the column approximation.
&amp; The simulated image can be displayed as a halftone
image rather than as intensity profiles.
</p>
<p>This program was so successful, in part, because
Head et al. were able to calculate the images quite
quickly in spite of the fact that the computers available
to microscopists were often not particularly powerful in
�1970. The calculations used a concept which they
called the generalized cross section (GCS). (The GCS
is not a scattering cross section, it is actually a slice
through the specimen.) The GCS can be used when the
displacement field, uk, satisfies the requirement that
</p>
<p>uk&eth;x; y; z&THORN; &frac14; uk&eth;x; 0; z&thorn; cy&THORN; (25:34)
</p>
<p>Here c is a constant and the foil is imagined to be
laterally infinite. When this requirement is satisfied,
the calculation of uk is greatly simplified. One such
situation is the important case where several disloca-
tions and their associated fault planes are all parallel
to one another. Then you only need to calculate the
many-beam, Howie-Whelan equations on the plane y=0.
The displacement field for two columns y1 and y2 will
only differ by a translation along the column, i.e., the
z-direction. You don&rsquo;t want to repeat calculations
you&rsquo;ve already done; just calculate the image on a
mesh in the x&ndash;y plane.
</p>

</p>
<p>FIGURE 25.15. Many of the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; for predicting the contrast from

<p>planar &lsquo;defects&rsquo; make certain assumptions about the geometry of the

</p>
<p>The &lsquo;usual&rsquo; situation is shown in (A) but the intersection of the planar
</p>
<p>defect with the upper specimen surface may be lower than the intersection
</p>
<p>with the bottom surface as in (B). This geometry can cause a reversal in the
</p>
<p>rules.

<p>Examples of experimental and simulated images are
shown in Figure 25.16. The simulation package used
here (Comis again) was particularly attractive since it
also performed elasticity calculations for simple defect
configurations. It could simulate the effect of changing
different parameters, and hence
</p>
<p>&amp; Change the accelerating voltage to see the extinction
distances change.
</p>
<p>&amp; Change the absorption parameters to see the loss
of SF-fringe contrast near the middle of the foil
(z=0.5t).
</p>
<p>&amp; Change the number of beams contributing to the
image; how good is your two-beam assumption?
</p>
<p>&amp; Look at how reversing g changes the geometry of the
image.
</p>
<p>&amp; Compare BF and DF as you vary the value of sg.
</p>
<p>The Comis program ran on a Convex mini-super-
computer with an intelligent terminal, then on a Mac
with OS6. Zhou used the concepts in the new and
advanced package, TEMACI.
</p>
<p>25.13 QUANTITATIVE IMAGING
</p>
<p>One of the important applications of diffraction-contrast
images is the detailed characterization of defects. With
the improvements in the TEM, particularly in resolution
</p>
<p>and drift, we are now able to pay more attention to the
fine structure of defects and this requires quantitative
image analysis. In particular, we need to use the actual
intensity levels in the image.One obstacle for quantitative
analysis has been the uncertainty in the background-level
intensity caused by inelastic scattering. As energy-filtered
images become more widely available (see Chapter 37),
we hope this problem will disappear. Direct digital
recordings of the intensities, using a CCD camera are
making quantitative analysis more tractable, eliminating
uncertainties associated with the calibration of the
response of the emulsion of the photographic film.
</p>
<p>With these new applications of diffraction-contrast
images in mind, improved simulation programs have
become essential. An ideal program will be versatile,
but user-friendly; it will allow us not only to calculate
the image but also to give defect interaction geometries.
In simulating images of crystal defects, you&rsquo;ll encounter
several problems that are almost independent of one
another. You must be able to do the following
</p>
<p>&amp; Define the geometry of the defects and of the speci-
men (the diffracting conditions).
</p>
<p>&amp; Calculate the displacement field associated with the
defects.
</p>
<p>&amp; Propagate and scatter the electron beams through-
out the foil (i.e., solve theHowie-Whelan equations).
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already discussed the theoretical basis of the
diffraction process, so we&rsquo;ll now illustrate some of the
numerical methods which we can employ for different
defect geometries. In Chapter 26, we&rsquo;ll consider other
types of defects whichmay be analyzed, methods for defin-
ing them, and how we can calculate the displacement field.
</p>
<p>25.13.A Theoretical Basis and Parameters
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use the Comis program as an example of the
considerations that go into a simulation program. One
message that you should certainly understand from this
discussion is that you must be very cautious when using
any program to simulate images. All such programs
make assumptions and simplifications.
</p>
<p>Comis was based on the Howie-Whelan dynamical
theory of electron diffraction and thus neglects diffuse
scattering but it could simulate without the column
approximation. The basis of the approach used was
given by Howie and Basinski.

As always, when using the computer to simulate
TEM images: beware of the black box. Don&rsquo;t auto-
matically believe everything that comes out of it.

<p>&amp; Use the deformable-ion approximation to describe
how the crystal is influenced by the displacement
field, R. In this model, the potential at r in the
deformed crystal is assumed to be equal to the poten-
tial at the point r &ndash; R(r) in the perfect crystal. The
model is good unless R(r) varies too rapidly.
</p>
<p>&amp; Extend the Howie-Whelan approach to many beams
and avoid the column approximation.
</p>
<p>The resulting equations are basically the same as
those we derived in Chapter 13, so don&rsquo;t be put off by
their appearance.
</p>
<p>In treatments avoiding the column approximation,
we include terms which allow for a variation in x and y:
these terms were specifically excluded in Chapter 13.

<p>As usual, c is the incident-beam wave vector in
vacuum, g is a particular diffraction vector, and h
represents all the other possible diffraction vectors;
you might like to compare this equation with equa-
tion 13.8! We have defined two new parameters to
take account of the direction of the beam
</p>

</p>
<p>(25:36)
</p>
<p>The x&ndash;y plane in the reciprocal lattice contains the
dominant reflections, and z is almost parallel to the
incident beam. The number of beams you can include
in the calculation is limited only by the capacity of your
computer. The standard default for a programwould be
to select only beams on the systematic row. However,
non-systematic beams can substantially influence your
image, so it is useful if you can include sets of beams
which are coplanar with the systematic row. We define
the deviation of the crystal orientation from the exact
Bragg condition by specifying the wave-vector compo-
nents wx and wy; the latter applies when reflections out-
side the systematic row are included. Now we can
calculate all the deviation parameters, sh; there are
many beams and each s can be different.
</p>
<p>Each extinction distance xg is defined as the ratio wg/
|Ug|, as usual withUg being a Fourier component of the
perfect-crystal potential. The Fourier components can
be calculated from X-ray scattering factors, using the
Mott expression. For most situations the scattering
angle is small enough, so the X-ray scattering factors
</p>
<p>may, in turn, be calculated using the nine-parameter
Gaussian fit given by Doyle and Turner.
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to know the unit cell for your material
and the Debye-Waller factor, B. Comis could then
automatically calculate xg using a built-in table of the
Doyle-Turner parameters. You need to know B if you
want to convert X-ray structure factors to electron
structure factors (or vice versa) at a given tem-
perature, or if you want to compare structure-factor
measurements taken at different temperatures. When
you calculate extinction distances, the Debye-Waller
factors are essential to determine the effect of
temperature.
</p>
<p>Equation 25.35 is only valid if your crystal has a
center of symmetry, otherwise we have to redefine xg.
Simulations involving non-centrosymmetric crystals
can be performed, but we have to replace the xg and xg
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>with complex quantities and then defining all the para-
meters is really difficult (see equations 14.2&ndash;14.8).
</p>
<p>You can take account of absorption effects in the
usual way by adding imaginary Fourier components,
Ug
</p>
<p>0 the absorption distances, xg
0, are then defined as we
</p>
<p>discussed in Section 24.7. There are equations which a
program can use to estimate the absorption distances,
e.g., the linear relation |Ug
</p>
<p>0|/|Ug|=a+ b|g|, as suggested
by Humphreys and Hirsch, or you could specify each
individual absorption distance directly.
</p>
<p>25.13.B Apparent Extinction Distance
</p>
<p>The program developed by Head et al. was based on the
two-beam approximation. The success of such calculations
relies on the fact that the xgmaybe replaced by an apparent
extinction distance, xag&lt; xg. This substitution compensates
for scattering into beams that are not included in the two-
beam calculation. The term xag depends on t and must be
estimated in each individual situation, e.g., by fitting the
simulated image to your experimental image. For a quan-
titative image analysis it is important that you should have
as few adjustable parameters as possible; using the many-
beam program eliminates the need to use the parameter xag.
Alternatively, you may determine xag by comparing simu-
lated thickness fringes calculated using many-beam and
two-beam approximations.
</p>
<p>25.13.C Avoiding the Column Approximation
</p>
<p>Now you knowwe can perform simulations with or with-
out the column approximation. With the column
</p>
<p>DEBYE-WALLER FACTOR
B is related to the (mean-square) vibrational ampli-
tude of an atom on a lattice site. It is a temperature-
sensitive term.

<p>approximation, you only keep the first term on the right-
hand side of equation 25.35. The equations are reduced to
a system of ordinary differential equations which the pro-
grammust solve at each image point (x, y). In practice, the
equation is solved on the nodes of a mesh (columns) using
a fifth-order Runge-Kutta integration routine (which you,
or the program, can look up when you need it). You need
to choose the size and &lsquo;resolution&rsquo; of the mesh. As we&rsquo;ll see
in Chapter 27, there are situations where the column
approximation will not be acceptable.
</p>
<p>Without the column approximation, equation 25.35
gives us a system of coupled partial differential equa-
tions. The boundary conditions (at z=0) can be gen-
erally written in the form
</p>
<p>agfg &thorn; bg
@fg
@x
</p>
<p>&frac14; cg (25:37)
</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re ignoring changes in the y-dimension.
We can use fixed boundary conditions again follow-
</p>
<p>ing Howie and Basinski
</p>
<p>&amp; The foil is divided into thin slices of thickness Dz.
You should not confuse this with the multislice
method for lattice-image simulation which we&rsquo;ll
see in Chapter 30; we are still using Howie-Whe-
lan equations. Then, equation 25.35 is integrated,
using the column approximation, through the
first slice, i.e., from z=0 to z=Dz, at all the
mesh-points.
</p>
<p>&amp; The corrections to the column approximation, i.e.,
the terms containing derivatives with respect to x
and y, are then evaluated by interpolation and
included.
</p>
<p>&amp; The procedure is repeated until the exit surface of the
foil is reached.
</p>
<p>With this procedure, you are actually applying the
column approximation to the outer boundary of the
mesh. So, in equation 25.37 ag=1, bg=0, and cg=fg
at the initial surface. In order to avoid distortion of the
image, we must choose the step size, Dz, carefully and be
sure that the distance between columns (mesh size) is
small enough (see Anstis and Cockayne).
</p>
<p>25.13.D The User Interface
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to run your program interactively so it should
include commands which allow you to change parameters
easily. Ideally, it will allow you to access each command
through the keyboard using a menu. In Comis certain
standard menus were available for special purposes. The
user could also build (and save) menus interactively. This
allowed all the relevant parameters and commands for a
particular problem to be present within a single menu. At
any time, all the commands were available through the
keyboard.
</p>
<p>Although typical simulations may be performed in a
matter of seconds, many-beam calculations including
several dislocations may require more CPU time. For
this situation, Comis included a &lsquo;submit&rsquo; command that
would start a batch job based on your current data and
parameters.Thus, the interactivemodecouldbeusedasa
convenient way of submitting several jobs with varying
parameter values.
</p>
<p>For many problems, a purely visual comparison of
experimental and simulated images is sufficient to allow
you to interpret your image. In these situations, you can
often find a xag such that the simulations can be carried
out with only two beams (à la Head et al.). However,
since many parameters are involved in the image-match-
ing process, it is best to eliminate as many unknown
variables as possible. Many-beam calculations are even
more important for quantitative analyses.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The key points discussed in this chapter are
</p>
<p>&amp; We see contrast from planar defects because the translation, R, causes a phase shift
a=2pg .R.
</p>
<p>&amp; In the two-beam case, we can derive analytical expressions to describe the contrast.
&amp; We can use the scattering matrix method in the two-beam case and can readily extend it to
more complicated multibeam situations.
</p>
<p>Many different types of planar defect can be studied. You should be careful not to
assume that all defects behave the same as SFs in fcc materials.
</p>
<p>There is a direct relationship between the information in the images and that in the DPs,
which you can understand using the concept of the relrod.
</p>
<p>You need to understand howBloch waves behave to explain why BF/DF pairs of images are
not complementary andwhy the contrast fromplanar defects can disappear in the &lsquo;middle&rsquo; of the
image. The latter is a result of preferential absorption (really scattering) of certain Bloch waves.
</p>
<p>We can now use computer modeling of diffraction-contrast images of planar defects to
perform quantitative analysis and image matching.

<p>Imaging Strain Fields
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>As we discussed in Chapter 24, bending of the lattice planes causes a change in the
diffraction conditions and therefore a change in the contrast of the image. The presence
of a lattice defect in the specimen causes the planes to bend close to the defect. The special
feature here is that the bending varies not just laterally, but also through the specimen. Since
the details of the bending generally depend on the characteristics of the defect, we can learn
about the defect by studying the contrast in the TEM image. This simple principle has led to
one of the main applications of TEM, namely, the study of defects in crystalline materials.
We can claim that our understanding of the whole field of dislocations and interfaces, for
example, has advanced because of TEM. We have even discovered new defects using
TEM&mdash;like the stacking-fault tetrahedron, the faulted dipole, and the multipole.
</p>
<p>Usually we want to learn two things about these defects: we want to knowwhere they are
and then understand what they are. So the idea underlying this chapter is the same as for
bend contours: we use different reflections corresponding to different sets of lattice planes.
We see how the defects affect the image contrast from those different lattice planes and thus
characterize the defects. In case you are worried, we would like to emphasize that this is not a
chapter about defects; it is concerned with understanding contrast in the TEM. We will
introduce the necessary terminology and notation concerning defects, but we won&rsquo;t try to
give you a comprehensive discussion of them. You should consult the standard references
on dislocations at the end of the chapter if you needmore details. However, we will show lots
of pictures because now we are concerned with the appearance of images. We finish with
some discussion of image simulation.
</p>
<p>26.1 WHY IMAGE STRAIN FIELDS?
</p>
<p>First, we should review our terminology. When we dis-
place the atom at position r a distanceR(r) from its site in
the perfect crystal, we say the crystal is under a strain (e).
If the crystal is strained, then it must be subject to a stress
which we&rsquo;ll call s. (Metallurgists traditionally use these
symbols and althoughsmeans &lsquo;cross section&rsquo; to amicro-
scopist, we&rsquo;ll stick with it.) SinceR(r) varies with position
in the crystal, e and s will in general also vary with r. We
will assume that e and s can each be defined at a point.
Then we will refer to these quantities as the displacement
field, R(r), the strain field, e(r), and the stress field, s(r).
You will notice that these terms are used interchangeably
in the literature although there is a clear causal sequence.
What we image is the effect of the R(r).
</p>
<p>To have an intuitive feel for why we see contrast from
dislocations, consider the geometry shown in Figure
26.1. The diffraction geometry has been set up so that
</p>
<p>the specimen is slightly tilted away from the Bragg con-
dition. The distortion due to the dislocation will then
bend the near-diffracting planes back into the Bragg-
diffracting condition. We have relrods so there will still
be some intensity in the electron beam even when we are
not at the exact Bragg condition. The figure shows planes
bending at a dislocation; compare this to Figure 24.7
showing bend contours. Regions far from the dislocation
are tilted well away from the Bragg condition, while the
regions or either side of the dislocation core are at the
Bragg condition for �ghkl. It is more difficult to recog-
nize the diffracting planes for a screw dislocation (Figure
26.2) but the planes are bending just the same.
</p>
<p>When studying a particular dislocation (edge or
screw), we want to determine the following parameters
</p>
<p>&amp; The direction and magnitude of the Burgers vector,
b, which is normal to the hkl diffracting planes
(Figures 26.1 and 26.2B).
</p>
<p>26.1 WHY IMAGE STRA IN F I ELDS ? .......................................................................................................................................................... 441</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; The line direction, u (a vector), and therefore, the
character of the dislocations (edge, screw, or mixed).
</p>
<p>&amp; The glide plane: the plane that contains both b and u.
</p>
<p>There are other questions we want to answer
</p>
<p>&amp; Is the dislocation interacting with other dislocations,
or with other lattice defects?
</p>
<p>&amp; Is the dislocation jogged, kinked, or straight?
&amp; What is the density of dislocations in that region of
the specimen (and what was it before we prepared
the specimen)?
</p>
<p>&amp; Has the dislocation adopted some special configura-
tion, such as a helix?
</p>
<p>Inmany of these questions, youmay find that stereo-
microscopy or tomography (Section 29.1) can be very
helpful although we will not emphasize those techniques
here. The basic requirement if you do use stereomicro-
scopy is that you must form all of your images using the
same g vector.
</p>
<p>26.2 HOWIE-WHELAN EQUATIONS
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the two-beam phenomenological approach
because it worked so well in Chapter 25. An important
assumption is that we have linear elasticity. What this
means is that if we have R1 due to one defect and R2 due
to a second defect, then at any point in the specimenwe can
just add these two values to determine the total displace-
ment field, R. We will not consider anisotropic elasticity
although this can readily be included in calculations if
you&rsquo;re using a computer.

</p>
<p>The justification for this substitution is the same as
always. You&rsquo;ll notice that f0(z)(sub) is the same as
before, but fg&eth;sub&THORN; now includes a g.R term. The reason
for this substitution is that it will give us a simple expres-
sion for dfg/dz.

</p>
<p>The concept of sR is new.
The importance of this result is that although we
</p>
<p>have a new &lsquo;s.&rsquo; we have the same equation so we can
use the rest of the analysis of Chapter 13 and obtain the
same results with a modified value of s, i.e., sR. There-
fore, we&rsquo;ll have the same thickness dependence so that
the contrast of the defects will depend on both s and xg.
The big change is that we can now treat the case whereR
is a continuous function of z.
</p>
<p>We will examine how the g.dR/dz and g.R terms are
used to understand dislocations. Since the equations we
have just derived have the same formas thosewe discussed
in Chapters 13 and 25, we can expect many of the same
properties in the images. In particular, the images of
</p>
<p>defects will show the same sort of thickness dependence.
We can also use the equationswe derived inChapter 25, so
we have two ways of looking at the defects
</p>
<p>&amp; g.R contrast is used when R has a single value,
&amp; sR contrast is used when R is a continuously varying
function of z, which in turn is associatedwith g.dR/dz.
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s consider the principles of this analysis.
Remember, we are not trying to be quantitative or
totally rigorous. We will generalize the two-beam treat-
ment for the imperfect crystal. Note that we still have
beams, it&rsquo;s a dynamical situation, and we assume that
the column approximation is valid. So how does the
column approximation relate to the theory? The model
relates R to the column as shown in Figure 26.3 and the
calculation is for a continuum even though we have
atoms. The important point is that the displacement
field, R, varies with position, r; we can define the origin
as the core of the defect. We&rsquo;ll go through the calcula-
tion for a dislocation parallel to the foil surface.
</p>
<p>As we saw in Section 13.11, the column approxima-
tion is equivalent to assuming that the crystal can be
divided into narrow columns. We then calculate the
amplitudes of the beams in any such column as if the
whole crystal consisted of an infinite number of identical
columns. The approximation is valid when we don&rsquo;t need
to see image detail below 2&ndash;3nm. The actual diameter of
the column depends on the diffracting conditions. We
can include the effect of distortions due to strains from
lattice defects by imagining that the column consists of
slabs of perfect crystal, each displaced by an amountR(z)
(like a mini-SF that&rsquo;s different on every plane). Remem-
ber that z is actually measured along the column.

<p>26.3 CONTRAST FROM A SINGLE
DISLOCATION
</p>
<p>When we study dislocations, we usually want to know
how many there are (the density) and whether they are
edge, screw, or mixed in character. The displacement
field in an isotropic solid for the general, or mixed, case
can be written as
</p>
<p>R&frac14; 1
2p
</p>
<p>bf&thorn; 1
4 1�n&eth; &THORN; be&thorn;b�u 2 1�2n&eth; &THORN;lnr&thorn;cos2f&eth; &THORN;f g
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(26:8)
</p>
<p>For convenience, R is given here in polar coordinates (r
andf) shown in Figure 26.3; b is the Burgers vector, be is
the edge component of the Burgers vector, u is a unit
vector along the dislocation line (the line direction), and
n is Poisson&rsquo;s ratio.
</p>
<p>It was particularly important to be able to write
down this expression when we did the calculations by
hand. However, when we have a computer available, it&rsquo;s
quite straightforward to use anisotropic elasticity or just
feed in displacements calculated from a computer model
of the atom structure.
</p>
<p>The amplitude of the diffracted beam, fg, is directly
influenced by the value ofR. We can consider two partic-
ular cases, namely, the screw and edge dislocations. For
the screw dislocation, be &frac14; 0 and b is parallel to u so that
b� u &frac14; 0. Then the expression for R in equation 26.8
simplifies to
</p>
<p>R &frac14; b f
2p
</p>
<p>&frac14; b
2p
</p>
<p>tan�1
z� zd
x
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(26:9)
</p>
<p>Here, z is the distance traveled down the column and zd
is the distance of the dislocation core below the top
surface (again, refer to Figure 26.3). The dependence
on (z &ndash; zd) emphasizes that the displacement field is
present above and below the dislocation; it affects the
whole column. From these two equations we see that
g.R is proportional to g.b. For this reason, we often
discuss images of dislocations in terms of g.b (g-dot-b)
contrast. Examples of g.b values for some dislocations
lying on a (111) plane in an fcc material with a [011]
beam direction are given in Table 26.1.
</p>
<p>The second special case arises when the disloca-
tion is pure edge in character. Then b &frac14; be and g.R
</p>
<p>involves two terms g.b and g.b � u. (The latter term
is read as &lsquo;g-dot-b-cross-u.&rsquo;) The displacement field
causes the Bragg-diffracting planes associated with g to
bend. Incidentally, the origin of g.b � u is interesting; it
arises because the glide plane is buckled by the presence
of an edge dislocation as illustrated in Figure 26.4. This
buckling can be important because it complicates the
analysis of b for some dislocations with an edge compo-
nent, as we&rsquo;ll see below.
</p>
<p>&amp; Always remember: g.R causes the contrast and for a
dislocation, R changes with z.
</p>
<p>&amp; We say that g.b &frac14; n. If we know g and we determine
n, then we know b.
</p>
<p>An experimental point: you usually set s to be greater
than 0 for g when imaging a dislocation in two-beam
conditions. Then the dislocation can appear dark
against a bright background in a BF image. Of course,
you still need to think about sR and dR/dz since these
will vary with z, as we saw in Figure 26.1.
</p>
<p>The + and &ndash; signs in Table 26.1 are very important. If
the sign ofR, and hence g.R or g.b, reverses, then the image
of thedislocationwillmove to theother side of theprojected
</p>
<p>THE SPECIMEN
If the sample is a single crystal, then you need to
prepare a specimen with a [111] foil normal, so that
you can image long segments of the dislocations lying
in the plane of the foil on their (111) glide plane.

Figure 26.1, you can appreciate that reversing the sign of s
produces the same effect as reversing the sign of g. We can

<p>26 .3 CONTRAST FROM A S INGLE D I S LOCAT ION .................................................................................................................................. 445</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If we compare the contrast from a dislocation with
that from a SF, the difference is that now a is a con-
tinuously varying function of z. The image of the dis-
location itself shows thickness fringes but it may be &lsquo;out
of contrast&rsquo; at some depths or thicknesses, as you can
see (look carefully) in the experimental image shown in
Figure 26.6E.
</p>
<p>Some points to remember from this discussion are
</p>
<p>&amp; The sign of s affects the image.
&amp; The sign of x affects the image; the image is
asymmetric.
</p>
<p>&amp; The magnitude of s affects the image.
&amp; The depth of the dislocation and the thickness of the
specimen affect the image.
</p>
<p>&amp; The appearance of the image depends on g.b or,
more completely, on (g.b)s and g.b � u.
</p>
<p>&amp; If we repeat this analysis for other values of g.b (&frac14; n)
and plot intensities, we would find that the image
width becomes broader as n increases.
</p>
<p>&amp; Note where the dislocation image &lsquo;comes from&rsquo;: the
position of the line in the image only rarely corre-
sponds to the projected position of the dislocation; it
is usually displaced to one side of the core.
</p>
<p>&amp; As a complication, remember that the dislocations
will probably be found in wedge specimens, not ideal
parallel-sided ones.
</p>
<p>A final &lsquo;rule of thumb&rsquo; which you may find use-
ful (from computer modeling and early analytical
calculations) is that if g.b &frac14; 0, you can still &lsquo;see&rsquo;
dislocations when g.b� u� 0.64. For fcc materials,
this rule can be useful when the foil is not parallel to
a {111} plane.
</p>
<p>Other examples of dislocation images are illustrated
in Figure 26.6. Remember that partial dislocations are
not only present in fcc metals; they also occur in many
fcc semiconductors and many layer materials. Such
materials may have a very low stacking-fault energy
allowing the partial dislocations to separate, forming
wide ribbon-like defects, as shown in Figure 26.6A&ndash;C.
The single &lsquo;line&rsquo; (that is actually a dark line and a less-
dark line) below the arrow in (C) is a dislocation having
its Burgers vector parallel to g (so g.b&frac14; 2); you can see
two &lsquo;peaks&rsquo; in the image, one darker and broader than

<p>the other. Notice that one of those dark lines in (C) has
nearly disappeared in (B) and the dark peak is on the
other side of the dislocation. A group of three parallel
lines is present in (C) but is almost out of contrast in
(B). These are Shockley partial dislocations all having
the same b and thus giving g.b&frac14; 0 in (B) (the three lines
actually form by the dissociation of a perfect disloca-
tion with Burgers vector 1
</p>
<p>2
51124). The 11�1 image (A)
</p>
<p>is formed by tilting the specimen to a 112 pole (�208
from the 111 pole) and shows contrast from the stack-
ing faults themselves (imagine them filling the area
between the dislocations); these faults will never give
contrast at the 111 pole since g.R is then always 0 (or an
integer). Intermetallics tend to have large unit cells so
that the superlattice dislocations dissociate into partial
dislocations, which would have been perfect disloca-
tions in the disordered crystal (Figure 26.6D and E).
These super-partial dislocations can dissociate further
as they might have in the disordered lattice, or they can
separate differently in different ordered domains (Fig-
ure 26.6F). Dislocations in interphase boundaries can
be revealed by imaging with different reflections (Fig-
ure 26.6G and H). Since the dislocations are present to
accommodate the mismatch, they must lie at, or close
to, the (001) phase boundary. It can be difficult to
analyze their Burgers vectors unambiguously, because
the adjoining materials have different extinction dis-
tances, etc. The topic is &lsquo;image interpretation&rsquo;: now you
know why. One of the extra challenges is determining
the plane on which this dissociation occurs. We&rsquo;ll illus-
trate how we can see g.b� u contrast when we examine
dislocation loops in Zn in Section 26.6.
</p>
<p>26.4 DISPLACEMENT FIELDS AND EWALD&rsquo;S
SPHERE
</p>
<p>In Section 26.2, we showed that when a displacement
R(r) is present, we can think of s as being replaced by sR
(equation 26.7). This new s should be written more
completely as
</p>
<p>sR &frac14; s&thorn; g:
@R
</p>
<p>@z
&thorn; yBg:
</p>
<p>@R
</p>
<p>@x
(26:10)
</p>
<p>The point is that, as you can see in Figure 26.7, R causes
the lattice planes to bend through an angle df. So two
other parameters, namely g and s, also change. The dif-
fraction vector is actually lengthened by Dg but, more
</p>
<p>importantly, g is rotated. The result is that s increases by
the two components sa and sb shown in the figure, to give
sR. If you manipulate this equation for small angles you
can produce equation 26.7. We usually neglect the third
termbecause yB is small but it can become importantwhen
screw dislocations intersect the surface.
</p>
<p>An alternative way of looking at this deformation is
to think of g as changing by Dg. We can define this
change by the equation
</p>
<p>g:&eth;r� R&eth;r&THORN;&THORN; &frac14; &eth;g&thorn; Dg&THORN;:r (26:11)
</p>
<p>so that
</p>
<p>�g:R&eth;r&THORN; &frac14; Dg:r (26:12)
</p>
<p>The implication is that the information about the dis-
placement field, R(r), is present in the region around g
but not actually at g. Remember that the reflection g is
present because we have a perfect crystal. It is difficult to
image this type of scattering (but it becomes easier using

</p>
<p>components of sR, i.e., sa and sb.
</p>
<p>A QUESTION
How many dislocations can you really see in Figure
26.6H? Answer: zero.
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>EFTEM). If you displace the objective aperture, you
will still see the dislocation, but other inelastic scattering
will complicate image interpretation. We saw that scat-
tering does indeed occur between Bragg reflections in
Section 17.6. An analogy for scattering from disloca-
tions is the scattering of light from a single slit which we
discussed in Chapter 2.
</p>
<p>In the deformable-ion approximation (Section 25.13),
wemake the assumption that the atomdoesn&rsquo;t know it has
moved. If R(r) varies rapidly, as it does near the core of a
dislocation, the approximation must fail. You can draw
the same conclusion whenever the density of the material
changes rapidly. So what we should do is use a better
model for the atomic potential, one that also takes account
of what happens to the valence electrons at such a defect.
Of course, linear elasticity theory also fails when the
strains, and hence R(r), are large, as at dislocation cores.
</p>
<p>26.5 DISLOCATION NODES AND
NETWORKS
</p>
<p>You can analyze the Burgers vectors of dislocations
which form networks directly and easily, if all the dis-
locations lie in a plane parallel to the surface of the
specimen, as illustrated in Figure 26.8 for the case of
</p>
<p>graphite. The idea is simple: you form a series of images
using different g-vectors. Don&rsquo;t forget that you can tilt
to other poles; in fact, you&rsquo;ll often need to tilt the speci-
men just to image SFs which lie parallel to the foil sur-
face, as in Figure 26.8A (but you won&rsquo;t see SF fringes
then). When the diffraction vector is parallel to the
plane of the SF you&rsquo;ll only see contrast from the dis-
locations as in Figure 26.8B&ndash;D. Such tilting experiments
are essential if you&rsquo;re examining networks of misfit dis-
locations since the dislocations will then often have a
component of their Burgers vector out of the plane of
the network.
</p>
<p>26.6 DISLOCATION LOOPS AND DIPOLES
</p>
<p>Loops have been studied extensively because they can
form when point defects coalesce. There are probably
thousands of papers describing TEM studies of radia-
tion damage and the formation of dislocation loops. In
fact, many HVEMs were built in the 1960s just to study
this problem. Questions which were answered led to a
greatly improved understanding of irradiation processes
(but failed to justify the construction of more nuclear
power stations). We found that
</p>
<p>&amp; The loops can form by coalescence of interstitials or
vacancies.
</p>
<p>&amp; The rate of growth, critical size, and nucleation time
for different loops can be measured.
</p>
<p>&amp; Some of the loops are found to be faulted (contain-
ing a SF) while others are not faulted. The faulting
should be related to the size of the loop and the
stacking-fault energy of the material.
</p>
<p>These studies were particularly instructive illustra-
tions of the value of diffraction contrast.
</p>
<p>&amp; Dislocation loops can have either positive or nega-
tive b, and can be inclined to the beam on different
planes as shown in Figure 26.9. Many person-years
have been spent analyzing the inside-outside con-
trast from such defects to determine if they were
caused by vacancies or interstitials.
</p>
<p>&amp; Loops can be present that show no g.b contrast.
&amp; Loops can enclose single or multiple stacking faults,
and so exhibit SF contrast as shown in Figure 26.10.
</p>
<p>&amp; The dislocation dipole is a special case and gives
an important example of interacting dislocations.
TEM is the best way to image dipoles because they
have no long-range strain fields; the Burgers vector
of the complete dipole is zero! (More on this in
Chapter 27.)
</p>
<p>Dislocations in Zn provide a particularly nice illustra-
tion of g.b� u contrast. If the specimen surface is parallel

<p>(C) (D)
</p>
<p>FIGURE 26.8. Dislocation networks in graphite. In (A) the stacking

<p>faults parallel to the foil surface are imaged by using a g that is inclined
</p>
<p>to the fault (so g.R 6&frac14; 0); in (B&ndash;D) two of the three dislocations at each
node are in contrast but the third is invisible. Knowing g for each image,
</p>
<p>the Burgers vector of the dislocations can be determined as shown in
</p>
<p>(B&ndash;D) (g.b=0 for the missing dislocations).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>to the (0001) basal plane, then dislocation loops can
readily form by coalescence of vacancies. In Figure
26.11, b is normal to g so that g.b &frac14; 0. These loops give
a clear illustration of how the appearance of the image
</p>
<p>depends on the line direction, u, of a dislocation. Note
that you can see the dislocation contrast, even though
g.b is zero, so this is not an absolute criterion for
invisibility.
</p>
<p>The above discussion is fine if the loops are large, but
a problem arises when they are small. You must then
consider the details of the contrast mechanism.
</p>
<p>This was, of course, true for all these images, but now
the size of the defect is small compared to the extinction
distance. The schematic shown in Figure 26.12 summa-
rizes the contrast that arises from small vacancy loops; if
the loops were interstitial in nature, the contrast would be
reversed.Not only does the black/white contrast change as
the position of the defect changes in the specimen, but its
size also appears to change. When the nature of the loops
becomes more complex, the appearance of the image may
also become more difficult to interpret with &lsquo;butterflies,&rsquo;
&lsquo;lozenges,&rsquo; and &lsquo;peanuts&rsquo; being seen.Notice that the behav-
ior of the contrast differs in the BF and DF images; this
effect is similar to that which we discussed in Chapter 25
and is again related to anomalous absorption.
</p>
<p>Dislocation dipoles can be present in great numbers
in heavily deformed metals, but can also be important
in the degradation of some semiconductor devices.
Dipoles can be thought of as loops which are so elon-
gated that they look like a pair of single dislocations
of opposite Burgers vector, lying on parallel glide
planes. As a result, they are best recognized by their

<p>IMAGES AND THICKNESS
The basic idea is that the appearance of the image is

<p>&lsquo;inside-outside&rsquo; contrast, as illustrated in Figure 26.13.
You can appreciate the origin of the term by looking at
the projection of the images of the two dislocations
when you reverse the sign of g: since the two disloca-
tions have opposite Burgers vectors, Figure 26.9 tells
you that one image will lie on one side of the core and
the other on the opposite side. The order reverses when
we reverse g.
</p>
<p>26.7 DISLOCATION PAIRS, ARRAYS, AND
TANGLES
</p>
<p>Remember, you are not limited to g-vectors which are
parallel to the foil surface; hence you can tilt the speci-
men to see SF contrast. As we saw in Figure 26.8A, this
is often helpful if you have SFs associated with the
dislocations; you can then produce g.R contrast for the
fault. We will discuss dislocation dissociation more in
Chapter 27. If you look back at Figure 26.6 or 26.8, you
will see the benefit of being able to see the SF. This
figure also illustrates the effect of n on the dislocation
contrast.
</p>
<p>Consider a dislocation in an fcc metal which can
dissociate into two Shockley partial dislocations on
the (111) plane. We can write down the dislocation
reaction as
</p>
<p>1
2
1�10
� 	
</p>
<p>&frac14; 1
6
1�21
� 	
</p>
<p>&thorn; 1
6
21�1
� 	
</p>
<p>on &eth;111&THORN; (26:13)
</p>
<p>If we image this dislocation using the &eth;2�20&THORN; reflection,
then g.b &frac14; 2. If, instead, we use the &eth;20�2&THORN; reflection,
then g.b &frac14; 1. The appearance of the image is very
different even if we cannot see the individual partial
dislocations.
</p>
<p>The advantage of using high voltages to study arrays
of dislocations is illustrated in Figure 26.14; everything
we said in Chapter 11 applies when we study disloca-
tions. We see thickness fringes at the surface, but these
disappear in the central region of the foil&mdash;the contrast
becomes constant. When the foils are this thick, you
may find stereomicroscopy helpful in giving a 3D view
of the defect arrangement; you can imagine its value in
interpreting an image such as that shown in Figure
26.15A. The defects may be very close together in heav-
ily deformed materials, as shown in Figure 26.15B; of
course, the interpretation of such an image depends on
the thickness of the specimen so you also need to know
the voltage used to form the image. Ideally, make the
specimen thin over very large areas to minimize image
overlap. If the density of defects is too large, the weak-
beam technique may be the only way to &lsquo;look into&rsquo; the
walls (Chapter 27) but then the specimen needs to be
even thinner.

<p>26.8 SURFACE EFFECTS
</p>
<p>In TEM, we always have thin foils. Dislocation strain
fields are long range, but we often assign them a cut-off
radius of �50 nm. However, the thickness of the speci-
men might only be 50 nm or less, so we can expect the
surface to affect the strain field of the dislocation, and
vice versa.
</p>
<p>When an edge dislocation lies parallel to the surface
of a very thin specimen, it causes the specimen to bend.
The effect is not large, but large enough compared to the
Bragg angle, as illustrated schematically and with an
example in Figure 26.16.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if the dislocation is dissociated, the proxim-
ity of the surface causes its width to decrease (as in
Figure 26.16C). We can model this situation using
&lsquo;image dislocations&rsquo; as shown in Figure 26.16D. The
main point is that we can think of these image disloca-
tions as forcing the partial dislocations closer together;
the proximity of the surface can really change the struc-
ture of the defect, not just its contrast. A similar effect
can occur when the dislocation is inclined to the surface
and can result in a V-shaped dissociated dislocations, as
we&rsquo;ll show in Section 27.8.
</p>
<p>A special interaction between dislocations and sur-
faces occurs when a dislocation tries to glide out of the
material but can&rsquo;t penetrate a surface layer (whichmight
even be amorphous, as in the case of oxide films on
metals), as shown in Figure 26.17.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We can have dislocations at the surface just because
the structure of the surface layer is different from that of
the bulk material. The surface of materials can actually
reconstruct. The surface of a very clean (111) Au film is
actually more dense than the rest of the film and this
misfit is accommodated by surface dislocations, as
shown in Figure 26.18. We see the contrast because the
strain field extends into the bulk layer. The identifica-
tion of these dislocations has been confirmed using
STM, which also gives more information on the detailed
surface structure. However, they were observed first by
TEM. The difficulty in TEM studies is that the surface
contaminates unless you operate under UHV condi-
tions. The same comment is true for STM of metals
but we are used to having a poorer vacuum in TEM
and faster/easier specimen exchanges.
</p>
<p>Dislocations can be viewed nearly parallel to their
line directions, when we still see contrast even for screw
dislocations, as you can see in Figure 26.19A. Initially,
this contrast is surprising since g.b and g.b� u must be
</p>
<p>zero for any dislocation. However, the screw dislocation
can relax at the surface, as shown in Figure 26.19B; it
gives a twist. You see the screw dislocation even though
g.b=0 because of this twist.
</p>
<p>26.9 DISLOCATIONS AND INTERFACES
</p>
<p>Interfaces are, of course, important in all polycrystalline
materials. In metals, semiconductors, and thin films on
substrates, the interaction between dislocations and
interfaces is critical. So now we&rsquo;ll briefly examine the
special features we see when combining line and planar
defects, as illustrated in Figure 26.20. This is one topic
where image simulation, which we&rsquo;ll discuss in Section
26.12, is invaluable. The location of the GB is known
because we can see (just) the thickness fringes and the
GB dislocations. Notice that there are also &lsquo;extrinsic&rsquo;
(lattice) dislocations running into the GB. This is a great
figure for student questions!
</p>
<p>When we have an array of dislocations, the strain
fields overlap so that the value of R(r) for each disloca-
tion tends to be reduced. This is the GB model of an
interface.
</p>
<p>Dislocations can be present at interfaces where the
composition, or structure, or both change

<p>&amp; Misfit dislocations accommodate the difference
in lattice parameter between two well-aligned
crystalline grains. Surface dislocations (as we saw
in Section 26.8) are a special subgroup of misfit
dislocations.
</p>
<p>&amp; Transformation dislocations are the dislocations
that move to create a change in orientation or
phase. The 1
</p>
<p>6
51124 dislocations in twin bound-
</p>
<p>aries in fcc materials are an example of transforma-
tion dislocations (twinning dislocations).
</p>
<p>A complication in the analysis of images of interfacial
dislocations is that they are often associated with steps in
the interface. There are many examples of such steps in
Figure 26.21, including an example of &lsquo;step bunching.&rsquo;
(Notice also that s is different for the two grains!) Some-
times, as is the case for the 1
</p>
<p>6
51124 twinning disloca-
</p>
<p>tions, the dislocations must introduce a step. In other
situations, steps are present but there is no dislocation.
The difficulty is that we often encounter all three of these
situations at the same time. We will also examine these
defects using weak-beam conditions in Chapter 27 and
using HRTEM in Chapter 28.
</p>
<p>We will discuss the images first and then, remember-
ing that information must also be present in the DP, we
will relate the two.
</p>
<p>In many cases that interest us, GBs appear as
arrays of dislocations. In general, the grains are mis-
oriented. There are some special cases as we saw in
Chapter 24.
</p>
<p>&amp; Two grains may have a near-common plane
and therefore a nearly common, but different,
g-vector.
</p>
<p>&amp; In small-angle GBs, y is small, so the separation of
the dislocations is large (sin y/2 &frac14; b/2d).

<p>The S &frac14; 3 twin boundary in fcc materials is an
example of an interface where you can use common,
but different, g vectors. Here, e.g., the &eth;3�3�3&THORN; plane in
one grain is parallel to the (�511) plane in the other grain
(because these two reflections superimpose), and the
lengths of these two g vectors are identical, as you can
see in Figure 26.22. However, this common reflection
would not normally be used to form an image because g
is rather large. This type of coincidence of dissimilar
planes can also occur for other GBs.
</p>
<p>In the case of small-angle boundaries, we can pre-
tend that the reflection is common to both grains. The
image of the twist GB in Figure 26.23 was formed using
such a &lsquo;reflection&rsquo; (i.e., two nearby reflections). (Look
back at Figure 17.7 to get an idea of what the DP would
be like.) What we are really doing is treating the disloca-
tions as if they were isolated lattice defects; actually, the
g vectors for the two grains will be rotated relative to
one another.
</p>
<p>Lattice misfit is very important whenever we are
studying thin films; dislocations are often present to
accommodate misfit. An example is shown in Figure
26.24, where dislocations are present between spinel
and NiO; these two materials each have an fcc crystal
structure. Although you can easily appreciate the
change in lattice parameter, there is also a less obvious
change in the elastic constants.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The TEMbeam &lsquo;sees&rsquo; yet another change: the extinc-
tion distance is different. The result is that, if the crystal
is inclined to the electron beam, you will see thickness
fringes associated with the interface. Not much work
has been done on this, but you may find that it is more
difficult to use the g.b criterion for determining Burgers
vectors, especially when the misfit is large.
</p>
<p>Phase transformations often involve the movement
of dislocations, generally at semicoherent interfaces.
All the conditions discussed above may hold; however,
now the dislocations will certainly be associated with a
step on the interface to allow the transformation to
proceed, so as to physically translate the interface.
However, you&rsquo;ll find it difficult to model the contrast
from such dislocations, especially when you have a
thin layer of the new phase enclosed by the matrix, as
is the case when a precipitate grows, as illustrated in
Figure 26.25.
</p>
<p>The main effect of steps on such interfaces is that
they cause a shift in the thickness fringes. It is often
difficult to tell if there is also a dislocation present.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll summarize some features you should remem-
ber when studying dislocations in interfaces
</p>
<p>&amp; If the orientation of the grains is different, the dis-
tribution of strain from the dislocation may be dif-
ferent in the two grains; the diffraction contrast is
determined by this strain field.
</p>
<p>&amp; If the chemistry of the two grains is different or if you
use different but equal g vectors, the extinction dis-
tances will be different and the image of the disloca-
tions must therefore be affected.
</p>
<p>&amp; Be careful not to confuse moiré fringes with dislo-
cations (we discussed moiré fringes in Chapter 23).
The guide is that the dark and light moiré fringes
have approximately equal widths; if there is any
ambiguity, you should use weak-beam imaging
(Chapter 27) and carefully examine the DP.
</p>
<p>Humble and Forwood have shown using computer
simulation of dislocations in interfaces that it is best to
use diffraction conditions where a reflection is satisfied in
both grains, otherwise the dislocation images tend to be
rather featureless relative to the interface thickness fringes.
</p>
<p>26.10 VOLUME DEFECTS AND PARTICLES
</p>
<p>When the defects are small, the image may be dominated
by the strain-field contrast; that is the aspect we are
considering here. You have to remember, though, that
these defectsmay have a different structure, lattice param-
eter, and composition. The theory for a spherical par-
ticle in amatrix was given over 40 years ago and is known
as Ashby-Brown contrast. The theory works well for
coherent particles but as soon as the first interface dis-
location forms, analysis becomes much more difficult.
</p>
<p>Lattice-strain effects around spherical precipitates
appear as lobes of low intensity with a line of no contrast
perpendicular to g, as shown schematically in Figure
26.26. If you measure the size of the precipitates from a
DF image and the size of the strain-contrast lobes in BF,
you can get a direct measure of the lattice strain surround-
ing a single precipitate, which is really quite remarkable.
The process requires some specific experimental condi-
tions and careful calibration of the image recording pro-
cedure. It is quite a specialized study, so you should read
the original references for details. If your precipitates
aren&rsquo;t spherical, intuitive interpretation of the images is
unreliable and you have to resort to computer simulation.
</p>
<p>Figure 26.26B shows how a spherical particle might
strain the lattice. Notice that in this case, all the planes
continue across the particle so it is coherent and there
are no misfit dislocations. The figure here assumes that
all the strain occurs in the matrix, which is only true for
a hard particle in a soft matrix. The displacement field
used to model this situation is

</p>
<p>K is the bulk modulus of the precipitate; E and n are
Young&rsquo;s modulus and Poisson&rsquo;s ratio, respectively, for
the matrix. The important feature is that R always has
radial symmetry. Thus, when we consider the Howie-
Whelan equations, we realize that when g.R &frac14; 0 we will
see no contrast. So, there will be a &lsquo;line of no contrast&rsquo;
normal to g.
</p>
<p>The strain can be plotted using the equations
given by Ashby and Brown and the image simulated
(see below), as shown in Figure 26.26A. In the image
from a specimen of a Cu-Co alloy containing small
Co precipitates shown in Figure 26.26C, we can see
that the images of the particles resemble butterflies
or coffee beans. With the improvement in comput-
ers, the image contrast expected from much more
complex particle geometries can now be calculated
and can even consider statistical structural fluctua-
tions.
</p>
<p>26.11 SIMULATING IMAGES
</p>
<p>It is important that you understand the origins of
diffraction contrast from strain fields before you try
to simulate this contrast using a computer. Having
said that, few students would want to calculate image
intensities by hand. The Howie-Whelan equations can
be used to simulate images of dislocations, which is
especially important when the dislocations are close
together. The principal approaches used to simulate
diffraction-contrast images were discussed in Sections
25.11&ndash;25.13.
</p>
<p>Although the algorithm employed by the Head et al.
programs allows very fast computation of the image, it
does so by restricting the geometry of the defects. To
cope with more general geometries, e.g., the strain field
from end-on screw dislocations or non-parallel disloca-
tions, we can use Thölén&rsquo;s matrix algorithm. As we saw
in Chapter 25, the Howie-Basinski treatment extends
the two-beam calculations to include several beams on
the systematic row and provides a method for circum-
venting the column approximation.
</p>
<p>26.11.A The Defect Geometry
</p>
<p>When choosing the optimal simulation method,
depending on the defect geometry, the problem of cal-
culating the image belongs to one of three categories

<p>26.11.B Crystal Defects and Calculating
the Displacement Field
</p>
<p>The program Comis could simulate amplitude con-
trast from any number of defects consisting of fault
planes and straight, infinite dislocations. You just
needed to define the Burgers vector, line direction,
and relative position; planar faults were defined by
the plane normal, the displacement vector, and the
relative position. You could then predefine certain
standard geometries to ease the process of defining
the defect system.
</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve defined the defect geometry, you must
consider the region of the crystal you want to simulate.
In situations where the &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; region is well
defined (as in the case of inclined dislocations or inter-
secting dislocations), Comis determined this region and
provided it as the default. However, you could always
set the image region manually in Ångström units, to
obtain a desired magnification.
</p>
<p>The displacement field for the dislocations was
calculated in Comis using linear, anisotropic elasticity
theory and was based on the algorithms of Head
et al., so you had to specify the elastic constants of
your crystal. The displacement field then corresponds
to straight, infinite dislocations in an infinite medium
with no account taken of surface relaxations. In any
simulation, you should be able to introduce image
dislocations outside the crystal in order to include
surface effects.
</p>
<p>26.11.C The Parameters
</p>
<p>An example which shows simulated images of an
orthogonal network of screw dislocations is given in
Figure 26.27. Comis could calculate the equilibrium
</p>
<p>configuration of certain types of interacting dislocations
using anisotropic elasticity theory, and then directly
incorporates the resulting geometry in subsequent
image simulations. As you can appreciate from equa-
tion 26.5, in such simulation studies, you will need all
the parameters for the defects, the specimen, and the
diffraction conditions
</p>
<p>&amp; The foil thickness.
&amp; The stacking-fault energy.
&amp; The absorption parameters, usually using |U0g|/
|Ug|&frac14; 0.1.
</p>
<p>&amp; The number of beams included in the calculation.
&amp; The zone-axis and the diffracting vectors.
&amp; Also required are the electron energy, the elastic
constants, the normal to the foil surface, the
Burgers vectors, and the line direction of the dis-
locations.
</p>
<p>The exact beam direction can then be specified by
defining the &lsquo;center&rsquo; of the Laue zone, giving the
coordinates in terms of the g vector and gz. Here gz
is a specially defined vector in reciprocal space, which
is automatically set to lie in the ZOLZ and to be
perpendicular to g. Thus, if you place the center of
the ZOLZ at (0,0), the specimen is oriented on the
zone-axis; if you place the center of the ZOLZ at
(0.5,0), it corresponds to being at g/2, i.e., at the
Bragg position with the 0 and g beams excited. If
you change the second coordinate to be, say,
(0.5,0.5), you would include beams from off the sys-
tematic row.

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The central idea of this chapter is that the strain field moves atoms off their perfect-crystal
positions. We&rsquo;ve concentrated on dislocations because the edge dislocation gives the clearest
illustration of how the deformation produces the contrast and its structure can be understood
with a two-dimensional projection. We can summarize the topics of the chapter as follows
</p>
<p>&amp; There is a new feature to the column approximation. The displacement moves atoms out
of the column and brings others into the column.
</p>
<p>&amp; The basis of the g.b analysis of a dislocation is simply that the contrast is determined by
g.R(r) and that R(r) is linearly related to b. For the screw dislocation, R(r) is directly
proportional to b. For the edge dislocation, the image can also be affected by a g.b� u
component which is caused by the buckling of the dislocation glide plane.
</p>
<p>&amp; Dislocation images are usually asymmetric. The contrast depends on the sign of (g.b)s.
&amp; As a practical rule, we usually set s to be &gt;0. Then the distortion due to the defect will
bend the near-diffracting planes back into the Bragg-diffracting condition to give strong
contrast. When s&gt;0, detail in the image is more localized relative to the defect than if we
use the s &frac14; 0 condition.
</p>
<p>There are many other situations which are closely related to the topics we&rsquo;ve discussed in
this chapter. For example, we have not discussed strain contrast associated with crack tips
or the analysis of buckling of thin specimens. Although these are rather specialized situa-
tions, they do illustrate the growing applications of diffraction contrast in the TEM.

<p>Weak-Beam Dark-Field Microscopy
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;weak-beammicroscopy&rsquo; refers to the formation of a diffraction-contrast image in
either BF or DF where the useful information is transferred by weakly excited beams. The
DF approach has been more widely used, in part because it can be understood using quite
simple physical models. It also gives stronger contrast; we see white lines on a dark gray
background. This chapter will be concerned only with the DF approach. Historically, the
weak-beam dark-field (WBDF often abbreviated to WB) method became important
because under certain special diffraction conditions, dislocations can be imaged as narrow
lines which are approximately 1.5 nm wide. Equally important is the fact that the positions
of these lines are well defined with respect to the dislocation cores; they are also relatively
insensitive to both the foil thickness and the position of the dislocations in the specimen. The
technique is particularly useful if you are studying dissociated dislocations where pairs of
partial dislocations may only be �4 nm apart and yet this separation greatly affects the
properties of the material.
</p>
<p>We first choose a particular g and bring this onto the optic axis as if intending to form a
regular on-axis DF image. We then tilt the specimen to make sg large and examine the DF
image using reflection g. If a defect is present, the diffracting planesmay be bent locally back
into the Bragg-diffracting orientation to give more intensity in the DF image. The problem
is that, as we increase sg, the average intensity decreases as 1/s
</p>
<p>2; in the DP the beam appears
as a weak spot, hence the name.When sg is large, the coupling between g and the direct beam
becomes small and the diffracted beam is said to be &lsquo;kinematically diffracted.&rsquo; So, this
chapter is where we will discuss the &lsquo;kinematical approximation&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&amp; You will sometimes see reference to the g(3g) WB condition. Beware! Sometimes you
don&rsquo;t need to be this weak; sometimes this is not weak enough.
</p>
<p>&amp; It is often not the fact that s is large that is important; what is important is that xeff is
small.
</p>
<p>This chapter is unusual in that it deals with a special imaging technique, rather than a
concept or theory. Also, WBDF is only really useful when the specimen is not perfect, i.e.,
when you are interested in defects in the specimen or small changes in thickness. Therefore,
you can skip this chapter if crystal-lattice defects are not relevant to your microscopy study.
If you are interested in defects, you will find that this chapter really covers much more than
WB microscopy. For example, we will use concepts developed for diffracted beams and
carefully set the excitation error, sg, by referring to the Kikuchi-line pattern. In Section 27.9,
we will discuss some of the ways that new developments in TEM design are changing the
way we do WB microscopy and how we interpret the images.
</p>
<p>27.1 INTENSITY IN WBDF IMAGES
</p>
<p>We showed in Chapter 13 that, in a two-beam situation,
the intensity of the diffracted beam g in a perfect crystal
can be written as

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We will consider complications which arise when more
beams are present in Section 27.9. The important vari-
ables in equation 27.1 are the thickness, t, and the
effective excitation error, seff, which was given by equa-
tion 13.47

</p>
<p>In the WB technique we increase s to about 0.2 nm�1 so
as to increase seff. (In most WB papers you will see this
value as 2� 10�2 Å�1; remember 50 Å is 5 nm.) This
large value of s means that seff, and therefore the inten-
sity, Ig, becomes independent of xg except as a scaling
factor for t (in the prefactor in equation 27.1). The
actual value of s can be set by carefully positioning the
Kikuchi lines for the systematic row of reflections,
which includes g. You can best appreciate this effect by
calculating a range of values for s. Remember when
doing this that youmust specify g and the kV because, as
we saw in Chapter 13, xg varies with both the reflection
used to form the WB image and the energy of the
electrons, as implied in equation 13.47

</p>
<p>Practical Considerations: As the value of seff increases,
equation 27.1 shows that the intensity of the G beam
decreases very rapidly. The result is that the exposure
time needed to record the image on the CCD or on
photographic film also rapidly increases and has, in
the past, been the factor which limited the usefulness
of the technique. Although manufacturers may guar-
antee a drift rate of less than 0.5 nm per minute for
new machines, values of six times this rate are com-
mon on many older instruments. In early WB studies,
this problem was partly overcome by using photo-
graphic film with a fast emulsion or by modifying
photographic processing conditions. In either case,
the grainy appearance of the photographic emulsion
would be increased. The problem of drift can, in prin-
ciple, be overcome by using a video system to record
the image and capturing frames from the video. You
could then, in principle, reduce the noise by frame
averaging, particularly if you can take account of
any drift. The causes of drift (specimen and thermal
effects) and their correction or minimization are dis-
cussed in Chapter 8, but it is worth reminding you that
changes in the temperature of the water in the objec-
tive lens are a major cause of drift. Although WBDF
imaging may aim for 0.5 nm resolution rather than
0.2 nm in HRTEM, exposure times are often 10
times greater for WBDF than HRTEM, so drift may
be even more important.
</p>
<p>27.2 SETTING Sg USING THE KIKUCHI
PATTERN
</p>
<p>Since the contrast in the WB image is so dependent on
the value of sg we need a method for determining sg. We
draw a line through the g-systematic row and let the
Ewald sphere cut through this line at ng where n is not
an integer. Figure 27.1 illustrates this situation. How
can we &lsquo;see&rsquo; what the value of n is? Of course we can&rsquo;t,
since we are looking approximately normal to the
ZOLZ.We can&rsquo;t just judge n by looking at the intensities
of the spots except in special circumstances.
</p>
<p>The solution to the problem can be appreciated by
looking at the Kikuchi pattern shown in Figure 27.2.
When g is exactly at the Bragg condition, the gKikuchi
line passes through the g reflection; when 3g is exactly
satisfied, the 3g Kikuchi line passes through the 3g
reflection. We might guess that n is �3.2 in Figure
27.2, but we don&rsquo;t have a 3.2g Kikuchi line; we have to
deduce this value of n from the position of the 3gKiku-
chi line. Remember (from Chapter 19) that when the 3g
Kikuchi line passes through 3.5g on the g-systematic
row, the 4g Kikuchi line and the Ewald sphere pass
through the 4g reflection as shown in Figure 27.3.
Therefore, when the Ewald sphere passes through 3.2g,
</p>
<p>ON EQUATION 27.2
If s &gt;&gt; xg
</p>
<p>�2 then s � seff so that equation 27.2
becomes what is known as the &lsquo;kinematical equa-
tion&rsquo;; the kinematical equation cannot be applied for
small s unless the thickness, t, is also very small.

<p>the 3g Kikuchi line will pass through 3.1g; we can

<p>where Ng refers to the Kikuchi line closest to ng (N is

as we measure it. In the example above, we can choose
N to be 3 so that if m is 3.1 then n is 3.2; if, instead, we
choose N to be 4, then m is 3.6 (because we measure
the position of the 4g Kikuchi line) and n is still 3.2.
Having determined n we need to estimate s. This we do
using the expression

<p>n� 1&eth; &THORN; gj j2l (27:5)
</p>
<p>which you can derive from Figure 27.4 using the inter-
section chord theorem (ab= cd) and the fact that 1/l is
much larger than s.
</p>
<p>You can immediately appreciate some important
results from this expression
</p>
<p>&amp; Setting n= &ndash;1 gives the same value of s as for n= 3
but the sign is reversed.
</p>
<p>&amp; Themagnitude of s is more strongly dependent on |g|
than on l but it depends on both.
</p>
<p>&amp; The specific nature of the material enters through g,
the microscope affects s through l.
</p>
<p>Here we recommend that you use a spreadsheet to
calculate different values of s as you vary g or l. A
selection of these for Cu and Si is given in Table 27.1.
</p>
<p>As an exercise, you can use equations 27.2 and 27.5
to calculate seff with 3g&frac14; 42 nm for the 220 reflection in
Cu at 100 kV. You can then see when seff becomes
&lsquo;independent&rsquo; of xg. Next, repeat the exercise with
other values of l or for other reflections and materials.
</p>
<p>One point you should bear in mind is that none of
the above discussion requires a particular value for s
and yet you will often read that s must be � 0.2 nm�1
for a WB image. This value of s is recommended when
you are studying defects quantitatively, because com-
puter calculations show that the position of the image
can then be directly related to the position of the defect.
You will find that smaller values of s will often give you
WB images which contain the information you want
and you can more easily see and record the image!

<p>27.3 HOW TO DO WBDF
</p>
<p>The nature of theWB image imposes a restriction on the
maximum specimen thickness which you can use
because the visibility of such images decreases as the
thickness increases (due to a corresponding increase in
inelastic scattering). However, the orientation of the
specimen is accurately set by reference to the Kikuchi
lines observed in the DP (Chapter 19), and these are not
visible in specimens which are too thin. Therefore, your
specimen thickness must be greater than a certain mini-
mum value. Also, if the observations you made on
certain defects, in particular, dislocation ribbons and
nodes, are to be interpreted as representative of the
bulk and not influenced by the surface of the foil, then
again the foil must not be too thin. You can generally
satisfy these requirements by selecting defects for
detailed study which, in the case of Cu and its alloys,
lie in areas which are about 70 nm thick.
</p>
<p>Due to the very low intensity of the WB images,
exposure times required are typically on the order of
4&ndash;30 seconds using Kodak SO-163 film (CCD cameras
are better!). The main factor limiting the exposure time
is the inherent instability of any specimen stage. To
minimize the exposure time, you can usually use a highly
convergent (or divergent) beam, contrary to the
assumption implicit in the simple theory. The effect of
this convergence is that oscillations in image intensity
and position, which result from variations in depth and
thickness parameters, are diminished.
</p>
<p>The first two steps in setting up the WB conditions are
illustrated in Figure 27.5, relating what happens in the
Ewald-spheremodel with what you see happening to the
Kikuchi lines.
</p>
<p>&amp; Orient the specimen in BF so that g is excited and
sg is just greater than zero. Make sure that no
other reflections are excited (see upper diagram
in Figure 27.5).
</p>
<p>&amp; Use the DF beam-deflecting coils to bring the reflec-
tion g on to the optic axis. Use the binoculars
because g becomes very weak; underfocus the beam
before you use the high-resolution screen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Insert the objective aperture. In BF, check that the
aperture is centered, then switch to DF and check
that the spot G is centered in the aperture.
</p>
<p>&amp; Fine-tune your conditions looking at the DP with G
centered.
</p>
<p>&amp; Go to imaging mode; you now have a WB image
with the required g(3.1g) condition (see lower dia-
gram in Figure 27.5).
</p>
<p>Since you have inserted a small objective aperture,
you should now check the objective astigmatism. We
use a small objective aperture so as to remove inelas-
tic scattering; remember that this aperture will then
limit our potential resolution. If you focus the beam,
you may change the position of the beam and prob-
ably the astigmatism! Remove the objective aperture
and check that no other reflections are strongly
excited when you are in DF. Then repeat the process
starting at the third step (insert the objective
aperture).
</p>
<p>After finely focusing the image, record it together
with its SADP.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure why this &lsquo;trick&rsquo; for setting the
g(3.1g) condition works, go back to Chapter 19 and
draw the systematic row and the corresponding Kiku-
chi lines. Then move the spots, while keeping the crys-
tal, and thus the Kikuchi lines, fixed. You may see the
conditions g(g) used. This was the original condition
suggested by Cockayne et al. (1969); it does give you
the same values of s as the g(3.1g) condition, but the
interband scattering processes are different and it is
not so convenient to change from BF to WBDF. How-
ever, you may find variations on this condition useful
when you need to use a g(ng) condition with a large
value of n.
</p>
<p>Weak-beam microscopy becomes much easier
when you are comfortable with using a CCD camera.
Just being able to see whether the image is moving due
to specimen drift can save boxes of photographic film.
As we mentioned earlier, you could use frame aver-
aging to reduce the noise. However, you will realize
that the extra magnification from the video system
tends to limit the area which can be viewed, so that
film is still preferred by many WB practitioners but
this is changing as higher resolution CCD cameras
become affordable. You will find that 30 k� magnifi-
cation on the plate is a good compromise; without
video, you will use 50&ndash;60 k� to allow you to focus
with the binoculars.
</p>
<p>WB STEP-BY-STEP
We&rsquo;ll go through how to set up the g(3.1g) diffraction
mode condition since this is widely used in practice.
Actually, it is generally referred to as &lsquo;g(3g) with s3g
positive&rsquo; because we guess the value of n by estimat-
ing m. This condition ensures that the 3g reflection is
not satisfied and also that you can use the BF 0(g)
image, with sg slightly positive, to locate the defect
and to focus your image.

<p>27.4 THICKNESS FRINGES
IN WEAK-BEAM IMAGES
</p>
<p>Thickness fringes in WB images are just like thickness
fringes in strong-beam images but the effective extinc-
tion distance, xeff, is much smaller. From equation 27.1
we can see that the intensity minimum occurs at thick-
nesses of N (seff
</p>
<p>�1) with maxima at (N +&frac12;)N (seff
�1).
</p>
<p>The effective extinction distance for s = 0.2 nm�1 is
5 nm; this value is rather sensitive to the precise value of
s so that the fringes will change if the foil bends. Using
WB images we can form a rather detailed contour map
of the specimen, but you must remember that
both surfaces may be inclined to the beam, as shown in
Figure 27.6.
</p>
<p>The thickness effect is illustrated in Figure 27.7.

<p>large regions where the surface is atomically flat on both
sides. Before heating, the specimen had been acid
etched, which caused the holes seen in this image
(they&rsquo;re black because we&rsquo;re in DF); you can see the
defects causing the etch pits in some pits. The specimen
shows inclined steps which curve across the surface.
Where we see wide, uniform gray regions the surface is
atomically flat. At A there is a large inclined step which
runs into the hole B. Notice how the number of fringes
around the hole B increases at A. Around the holes
(Figure 27.7B and C) we see much more closely spaced
fringes because the thickness changesmore quickly here.
Now if we look at the edge of any hole such as C, we see
that the spacing of the fringes has one value away from
the hole but another, smaller value close to the hole.
What we find is that the inclined surface facets on
different planes, with each facet becoming steeper closer
to the hole. This topology is a result of the way the
specimen has been prepared and would not normally be
found, say, in electrochemically polished specimens, but
it does illustrate the possibility of &lsquo;profiling&rsquo; using
thickness fringes.
</p>
<p>27.5 IMAGING STRAIN FIELDS
</p>
<p>The principle of the technique is very simple. When the
area of your specimen in which the defect of interest lies
is oriented away from the Bragg position, the reflecting
planes may be bent back into the reflecting position
close to the defect. The region over which this occurs is
very small because the strain has to be quite large to
cause this bending. For the (220) planes in Cu (which
fixes the plane spacing, d), the planes must rotate
through an angle of �28 to change s locally from
0.2 nm�1 to zero.
</p>
<p>When you look at dislocations in theWB image, you
see bright lines on a dark background. Let&rsquo;s compare
theWB image to a BF image of the same defect in Figure
27.8. You can see that the WBDF image is much nar-
rower; you could make the comparison look even better
if you make s very close to zero in the BF image.

</p>
<p>WHAT IS WEAK?
The intensity of the reflection that we see in the DP is
still small even though a relatively intense peak may
occur in the image close to the defect core because the
DP averages over a large area.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We&rsquo;ll keep our discussion of dislocations brief but
draw your attention to a few particular points
</p>
<p>&amp; In the WB technique, most of the specimen is tilted
so that s is large; the lattice planes in most of the
specimen are then rotated away from the Bragg
condition. However, as you can see in Figure 27.9,
near the core of the dislocation the planes are locally
bent back into the Bragg condition.
</p>
<p>&amp; This bending is only large close to the core of the
dislocation (i.e., at the same depth from the surface).
</p>
<p>&amp; The peak you see in the WB image is always dis-
placed to one side of the dislocation core. If you
reverse the sign of g, the peak moves to the other
side of the core. If you reverse the Burgers vector, b
(rotate the diagram in Figure 27.9 through 1808), but
keep g the same, the peak again moves to the other
side.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you increase s in the crystal, then the planes must
bend more to satisfy the Bragg condition, which
means the observed peak will move closer to the
dislocation core.
</p>
<p>&amp; When we say &lsquo;position of the peak,&rsquo; we are always
talking about a projected position where the projec-
tion is along kD.
</p>
<p>&amp; There will be some situations where the local strain
at the defect is not large enough to compensate for
the s you have chosen. Then you will only see poor
contrast in the image.
</p>
<p>27.6 PREDICTING DISLOCATION PEAK
POSITIONS
</p>
<p>There are three ways to calculate the contrast in a WB
image. Since each teaches us something new, we&rsquo;ll go
through them in turn.
</p>
<p>Method 1: The WB Criterion states that the largest
value of fg in the WB image occurs when sR, which we
derived in equation 26.7, is zero. We can express this
result as
</p>
<p>sR &frac14; sg &thorn; g �
dR
</p>
<p>dz
&frac14; 0 (27:6)
</p>
<p>Equation 27.6 tells us that if the effective value of s (i.e.,
seff) is zero, even though sg is not zero, then the direct
beam and the diffracted beam, g, are strongly coupled.
In this situation the strain field effectively rotates the
lattice planes into the Bragg-reflecting position. There-
fore, the crystal can be oriented so that fg is small for all
columns except those near the dislocation core where it
can attain a considerable magnitude due to the strong
coupling with the transmitted beam as it passes through
the region close to the core of the dislocation where seff is
zero. This increased amplitude is then retained below
the core when the coupling between the two beams is
decreased again. The intensity is expected to be largest
for that column where seff remains closest to zero over
the longest length, and this occurs for the column where
there is an inflection in the curve of R versus z. There-
fore, the position of the WB peak should occur when
equation 27.6 is satisfied at a turning point of g �dR/dz.
</p>
<p>Method 2: The Kinematical Integral. An alternative
criterion for defining the position of the WB peak was
derived with the approximation that only two beams are
considered and s is sufficiently large. Cockayne showed
that themaximum scattering from the transmitted to the
diffracted beam occurs where the kinematical integral,
defined as
</p>
<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>column
</p>
<p>e �2pi sgz&thorn;g�R&eth; &THORN;f gdz (27:7)
</p>
<p>is maximized. This maximum, in general, occurs for a
column which is closer to the dislocation core than
predicted by Method 1. The reason for this difference

<p>FIGURE 27.9. WB images from strained regions of the specimen show
</p>
<p>high intensity only from those regions where the diffracting planes are

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is interesting: because the planes are bent, the reciprocal
lattice point is, on average, nearer to the Ewald sphere.
Therefore, the integral has a larger value over the length
of the column.
</p>
<p>Without doing all the math, we can illustrate how
these two approaches are related. What we want to do
is determine when fg is large, but still kinematical (i.e.,
s is large); we want to maximize the kinematical inte-
gral in equation 27.7. We can do this using the sta-
tionary-phase method described by Stobbs. We write
the integral as
</p>
<p>&eth;t
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>exp �2pi z
2
</p>
<p>2
�
d2
</p>

�
d 3
</p>
<p>dz3
g � R&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>� �� �
</p>
<p>dz (27:8)
</p>
<p>where we have set s+ d/dz(g.R)=0. If we also set
d2/dz2(g .R)=0 (at the inflection), we go further to
ensuring that the term in the square brackets is zero.
This condition is what we guessed for the first method
of defining the WB criterion.
</p>
<p>Method 3: Compute the Contrast.Now that personal
computers are widely available, we can calculate the
position of the WB peak and graph the results. What
we then find is that the WB peak actually lies between
the two values predicted by the two criteria deduced
using the first two methods. We also find, using the
computer, that the position and width of the image
peak are affected by any strongly excited diffracted
beams so these must be avoided. Some apparently
weak beams can also affect the image. A practical
point is that the computer sometimes gives a rather
pessimistic view of the variability in the peak position,
so we have to weight the results carefully. Remember
that the important advantages of this approach are that
we can include the effects of the other diffracted beams
which are always present, and we can take account of
other effects, such as the convergence of the beam.
</p>
<p>In the kinematical approximation, the half-width,
Dx, of the image of an undissociated screw dislocation
with |g.b| = 2 is given approximately by the relation
derived by Hirsch et al. (1960)
</p>
<p>Dx &frac14;
1
</p>
<p>psg
�
xeff
3
</p>
<p>(27:9)
</p>
<p>This expression is a very useful rule of thumb. You will
realize that this WB image width is special for three
reasons, which arise because it doesn&rsquo;t depend on xg.
So, once s is fixed in a WB image, we can make several
surprising statements regarding the width of the dislo-
cation peak
</p>
<p>&amp; It does not depend on the material.
&amp; It does not depend on the reflection.
&amp; It does not depend on the kV.
</p>
<p>Take the example of the 220 reflection in Cu at
100 kV: xg is 42 nm, and the width Dx is 14 nm. So,
even if equation 27.9 is slightly wrong, the image width
is greatly reduced in WB. If we make sg = 0.2 nm
</p>
<p>�1,
then the half-width is 1.7 nm.
</p>
<p>Computed many-beam images confirm that disloca-
tions in other orientations give rise to similar narrow
peaks when this value of sg is used. A series of peak
profiles for different values of t is shown in Figure 27.10.
Notice that although the intensity of the peak may be
only about 0.1% of the incident beam, it is still much
higher than the background.
</p>
<p>Equation 27.9 indicates that as we increase the value
of s, the half-width of the image peak decreases. How-
ever, a maximum is imposed on s by the fact that the
intensity of the diffracted beam varies as s�2. If we make
s much larger, the contrast of the image therefore
becomes too small to be of practical use.
</p>
<p>The basic requirements governing the value of s
which you must use for quantitative imaging are
</p>
<p>&amp; s � 2� 10�2 Å�1 to give sufficiently narrow peaks
for fine detail to be studied.
</p>
<p>&amp; s � 3� 10�2 Å�1 because the intensity varies as s�2
in the kinematical limit.
</p>
<p>&amp; sxg � 5 to give sufficient contrast in the WB image.
</p>
<p>If you use the g(3g) condition for Cu with g = 220
and 100-keV electrons, then the value of sg will be
0.238 nm�1.
</p>
<p>27.7 PHASOR DIAGRAMS
</p>
<p>We sometimes find it useful to demonstrate the depth
dependence of the contrast in the WB image using pha-
sor, or amplitude-phase, diagrams which we introduced
in Chapter 2. You can generally use such diagrams
whenever the kinematical approximation holds; they
are equivalent to a graphical integration of the two-
beam equations for the case where s is large. In fact,
many of the early calculations of defect contrast were
made using this approach before computers became
widely available. We recommend that you glance at
the original paper by Hirsch et al. (1960): the contrast
profiles were calculated by plotting the phasor diagram.
</p>
<p>THE WB &lsquo;CRITERION&rsquo;
sg = 0.2 nm
</p>
<p>�1 is always a useful guide; it satisfies the
requirements that the image should have a narrow
width and show a high contrast between the defect
and background regions.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The basic idea is shown in Figure 27.11. We simply
add all the dfg increments to fg. In doing so, we take
account of the phase changes which occur as the beam
passes through the crystal. Remember that in this
approximation, no electrons leave the g beam! If the
crystal is perfect and our increments are sufficiently
small, we will produce a smooth circle.
</p>
<p>The circumference of this circle is xeff as we require
for the depth periodicity, and the radius is xeff/2p or
(2pseff)
</p>
<p>�1. Notice that as we increase s, we decrease xeff
and the circle becomes smaller. Thus we move around
the circle more quickly if s is large. In other words, our
effective extinction distance is reduced, as we knew from
Chapter 13.
</p>
<p>If the diffracted beam passes through a stacking
fault, it will experience an extra phase shift given by
2pg �R. Using the familiar example for an fcc crystal,
we take an example where R &frac14; 1
</p>
<p>3
&frac12;111	 and g &frac14; &eth;202&THORN;
</p>
<p>which gives a= 2p/3 = 1208 (modulo 2p). The abrupt
phase change is shown at P3, in Figure 27.12. Now, the
value of fg (P1P2) can be much larger than in a perfect
crystal. The locus of fg still travels around the first
circle until it meets the planar fault at z = nxeff+t1,
where z and t1 are measured parallel to kD. It then
moves onto the second circle until it reaches z = t.
You can readily see that if we keep the depth of the
fault, t1, fixed, we then see depth fringes which vary
with periodicity xeff as we vary the total thickness, t.
(The value of a is still 1208.) The situation is a little
</p>
<p>10&ndash;3

<p>more difficult to envision if we keep t fixed but vary t1,
but the principle is the same. Images of WB fringes
from inclined SFs are illustrated in Figure 27.13. The
thickness fringes of the wedge specimen and those
from the inclined stacking fault can both be clearly
seen and counted. Notice that the number of bright
fringes on the planar defect really does increase by one
for every increment xeff in the thickness of the wedge
and you don&rsquo;t need to know R.
</p>
<p>You can imagine applying this analysis to the situa-
tion where you have several overlapping planar faults,
as shown in Figure 27.14. fg (P1P2) can become very
large. (Does our approximation of unit incident inten-
sity still hold?) This situation does occur in practice, as
shown in Figure 27.15. Here we have several overlap-
ping faults. The bright ones are bright even when fg
reaches its minimum, as you would expect from Figure
27.14. If you compare the WB image with its strong-
beam counterpart in Figure 25.5, you will notice that
there is much more detail in the WB image; as we saw in
Chapter 25, overlapping faults on nearly adjacent
</p>
<p>planes can essentially give no contrast in the BF
image. You can easily check such effects in WB by
adjusting s as in Figure 27.15C&ndash;E. It&rsquo;s interesting to
realize that this effect can occur even when two intrinsic
SFs lie on adjacent planes to give the extrinsic SF. This
approach can be used to image other planar defects such
as the {112} twin boundary which can have a significant
thickness. The key factor is that, under WB conditions,
xeff can become comparable to the distance that the
beam travels between encountering successive planes
of atoms, particularly when the interface is quite steeply
inclined relative to the beam.
</p>
<p>We can also use a phasor diagram to describe the
contrast from a dislocation, but now the phase change
occurs over a length of the column rather than at a
particular depth in the sample. As illustrated in Figure
27.16, the phase can either add or subtract depending on
the sign of g .R. When the phase changes quickly with a
change in t, as at the center of Figure 27.16B, it means
that we are strongly coupling the incident and diffracted
beams.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll summarize our discussion of phasor diagrams
by two points
</p>
<p>&amp; They should only be used when the kinematical
approximation holds.
</p>
<p>&amp; They then give us a graphical method for under-
standing the variation of fg with thickness; the
method is especially useful when crystal defects are
present.

<p>27.8 WEAK-BEAM IMAGES OF
DISSOCIATED DISLOCATIONS
</p>
<p>Although the study of dislocations is a very specialized
topic, it beautifully illustrates the potential of the WB
technique. Dissociated dislocations are common in face-
centered-cubic (fcc) materials (including Si) and ordered
intermetallics such as Ni3Al. The geometry of a disso-
ciated dislocation in Cu is summarized in Figure 27.17.
We gave some general references on the theory of dis-
locations in Chapter 26.
</p>
<p>Since the computed many-beam images show that
the position of the dislocation image lies close to the
position predicted by the WB criterion, this criterion is
used in practice because it allows us to deduce an equa-
tion for the position of the image. We can thus directly
relate the separation of Shockley partials, for example,
to the measured separation of the two peaks observed in
|g .bT| = 2 images of dissociated dislocations. Hence we
can estimate the stacking-fault energy (SFE) of

<p>semiconductors and several fcc metals. In order to inter-
pret WB images of extended dislocation configurations,
we may need to know how the position of the image
peak is related to the position of the dislocation core.
This information is essential whenever we use the WB
technique to collect quantitative data. We will now
answer two questions for quantitative WB analysis
</p>
<p>&amp; What factors determine the position of the WB
peak?
</p>
<p>&amp; What methods are used to determine the Burgers
vectors of the dislocations?
</p>
<p>When the WB conditions are satisfied, dissociated
dislocations can be imaged in a {220} reflection for
which |g .bT| = 2, so that each partial dislocation gives
rise to an intensity peak having a half-width of
1&ndash;1.5 nm. The separation of the partials can be deduced
to within 
0.7 nm providing that the peak separation is
greater than �2.5 nm. For many materials, we need to
use anisotropic elasticity theory to relate the atomic
displacements to the image, so the computer becomes
essential.
</p>
<p>Why not just use HRTEM since, as we&rsquo;ll see in
Chapter 28, HRTEM can give detail down to below
0.2 nm, whereas WB is often limited to �1 nm? If you
want to interpret an HRTEM image the defect must be
absolutely straight, parallel to the beam, and located in a
very thin region of the specimen. The segment of dis-
location studied by HRTEMwill thus be no longer than
20 nm and less than 10 nm for the highest resolution. In
aWB image the defect can bemicrometers long and, in a
relatively thick foil, it can even change direction. If you
look back at Figure 27.8 you&rsquo;ll see pairs of lines which
correspond to partial dislocations in the WB image.
You can see other features such as constrictions. The
strong-beam image may also show two or more lines for
a particular dislocation but as we saw in Chapter 26,
these lines are generally not related to the detailed struc-
ture of the dislocation but rather to n in the equation
g .b= n.
</p>
<p>Ideally, for quantitative analysis, you should
choose long, nearly straight dislocations. As shown
in Figure 27.17, the two Shockley partial dislocations
lie in the (111) plane of the foil. The Burgers vectors
of the total and partial dislocations can be determined
by imaging the dislocation in the WB mode using
the f220g reflections. A sharp peak is found for a
partial dislocation with |g.bp|=1, and either no peak
or a diffuse one (arising from the anisotropy of the
lattice) if the partial dislocation has |g .bp| = 0. When
|g .bT|= 2, the diffraction vector g and the Burgers
vector bT are parallel and, in the image of a dissociated
dislocation, two sharp peaks are formed, one corre-
sponding to each of the partial dislocations (both now
have |g.bp| = 1).
</p>
<p>We can explain this difference in intensity if one peak
(the weaker) arises from the region between the partial
dislocations and the other from outside the dissociated
dislocation. This effect cannot occur in |g .bT| = 1
images, when |g.bp| = 1 for one partial and |g .bp| = 0
for the other, and it can be used to identify the reflection
for which |g .b|=2. Confirmation of the Burgers vector
is always obtained using the BF mode, observing char-
acteristic |g .bT| = 2 or |g .bT| = 0 images.
</p>
<p>In a WB image with |g .bT| = 2, each of the partial
dislocations will generally give rise to a single peak in
the image which is close to the dislocation core. You can
calculate the approximate positions of these peaks using
the criterion from equation 27.6. Then, you can relate
the separation of the peaks in the image to the separa-
tion D of the partial dislocations.
</p>
<p>We can write the displacement, using isotropic elas-
ticity theory, as the sum of the displacements due to the
individual partial dislocations. If the Burgers vector of a
straight, mixed dislocation lies in the (111) plane parallel
to the surface of a foil, then at a distance x from the
dislocation core

<p>Computed images confirm that this relation is accurate
for Dobs&gt; 2.5 nm, to within
0.7 nm. This uncertainty is
due to the variation of the peak position with the depth
of the dislocation in the foil and the foil thickness.
A small uncertainty arises when you have not deter-
mined the actual direction of bT, i.e., whether it is in
the direction of g or g. Stobbs and Sworn found that
the relation (equation 27.16) subject to the 
0.7 nm
uncertainty is still a good approximation when aniso-
tropic elasticity theory is used.
</p>
<p>As a simple exercise, consider the WB images of a
dissociated screw dislocation and a dissociated edge
dislocation. You should pay particular attention to &lsquo;a&rsquo;
and &lsquo;b&rsquo; because in one case, b1e and b2e have the same
sign, while in the other the sign is opposite. Does the
image always have the same width when you reverse g?
</p>
<p>Example 1. Even if you never want to calculate the
actual separation of two dislocations from obser-
vations of two peaks, you can learn new ideas
about dislocations from such images. Figure
27.18 is a famous set of images showing a disloca-
tion in Si which is constricted along part of its
length and dissociated along the rest. Even if you
don&rsquo;t know the precise details of the dislocation
structure, you know that it can adopt two variants;
the rest of the task is modeling the defect.
</p>
<p>Example 2. The WB image of the node pair in
Figure 27.19A, tells you very quickly that the two
nodes are different; if we form images using other g
vectors (Figure 27.19B&ndash;D), we find that one of the
partial dislocations is out of contrast in the image.
The extended node contains the same type of
intrinsic stacking fault that is present in the dis-
sociated dislocation; g .R is zero in this image for
the stacking fault. The other node is constricted,
</p>
<p>within the detection limit of the WB technique.
Comparison with the BF images in Figure 26.8 is
instructive. Note that in Figure 27.19A the SF in
the node does not show fringes because the SF
plane is parallel to the surface of the specimen;
we just tilted the specimen.
</p>
<p>Example 3. We mentioned that the peak moves to
the other side of the dislocation if we reverse b.
This is exactly what happens for a dislocation

<p>dipole as you can see in Figure 27.20. This is a
complicated figure except that you can use it not
only to see the inside-outside contrast in WB
</p>
<p>images of dislocation dipoles but also as an exer-
cise in g .b analysis. A dislocation dipole is a pair of
dislocations identical in every way, apart from the
sign of the Burgers vector. If we now reverse g,
then both peaks move to the other side of their
respective dislocations. This change in contrast
is referred to as inside-outside contrast and is
commonly seen on dislocation loops, which are
themselves closely related to these dipoles. Loops
are just more &lsquo;equiaxed&rsquo; than dipoles and always
consist of one dislocation (which may be disso-
ciated). The images shown in Figure 27.20B
and C illustrate the dramatic change in contrast
which you can see on reversing g. Some of the
dipoles completely disappear in Figure 27.20A&ndash;C
because they are a special form of defect known as
a faulted dipole. Such dipoles usually give very low
contrast in strong-beam BF images because the
dislocations are always very close together so
that their strain fields overlap and cancel, and the
lattice is thus only distorted over very small dis-
tances. All the dislocations are in contrast in
Figure 27.20B: it&rsquo;s the g .b=2 image. When we
use the WB techniques, we are probing the struc-
ture on these very small dimensions and the con-
trast can be high. Again compare with the BF
image in Figure 26.13.
</p>
<p>Examples 4 and 5. The WB technique allows us to
see features which would be hidden if we used
strong-beam imaging. Figure 27.21 gives a simple
example where an inclined SF is cutting through
several dissociated dislocations. The interaction of
the two defects would be masked by the SF fringes
in the strong-beam image but is clearly visible in
the WB image. Seeing small particles close to dis-
locations is difficult in strong-beam imaging.
Although not easy in WB, Figure 27.22 does illus-
trate that it can be done. This image shows, for
example, that the behavior of the dissociated dis-
location is different on each side of the particle.

<p>Figure 27.22B and C compares magnifiedWB and
BF images from the region close to the particle,
and again stresses the advantage of WB over BF
imaging.
</p>
<p>Example 6. We noted in Section 26.8 that the
surface of the specimen can affect the geometry
of the defects we are examining. In general, the
specimen needs to be thinner for WB imaging
than for strong-beam imaging. Therefore, the
surface can affect not only the appearance of the
image but also the actual geometry of the defect.
Figure 27.23 shows an example where this effect is
particularly clear. Dislocations that were uni-
formly separated in the bulk material now appear
wedge-shaped: the effects of the two surfaces are
different in this case.
</p>
<p>27.9 OTHER THOUGHTS
</p>
<p>27.9.A Thinking of Weak-Beam Diffraction as a
Coupled Pendulum
</p>
<p>We can illustrate the principle which underlies the
increase in intensity in the WB image close to a disloca-
tion using the mechanical analog of a coupled pendu-
lum. A diagram is shown in Figure 27.24. The two
pendula are connected (coupled) by a third string. If
we start the left pendulum swinging but hold the con-
necting string, the right-hand pendulum remains sta-
tionary. Now release the connecting string. You will
see that the right-hand pendulum now begins to swing.
If we let the process continue, eventually the right-hand
pendulum is swinging as much as the original one did,
but the original one is stationary: this is the strong-beam
analog! All the kinetic energy has been transferred from
one pendulum to the other. Given more time, the pen-
dulum will return to the original condition. Now repeat
the exercise but hold the connecting string again after
the right-hand pendulum has begun to swing; you will
notice that both pendula continue to swing, each with a
constant amplitude. The role of the connecting string is
to couple the two pendula (beams) so that we transfer
energy from one beam to the other. In WB TEM, the
defect acts as the connecting string. The two beams are
only coupled over a short length as they travel past the
defect. We can plot this amplitude (or intensity); try this
as an exercise.

<p>27.9.B Bloch Waves
</p>
<p>We discussed Bloch waves in Chapter 14. The difficulty
in applying Bloch-wave analysis to the WB situation is
that we are now usually interested in defects while Bloch
waves are properties of the perfect crystal. However, we
can offer some basic comments. For the reflection g to
give a WB image, |fg| must be much smaller than unity
in the regions of perfect crystal but, in strained regions, a
change Dc(j) in the amplitude of the Bloch wave j can
give rise to a change Dfg. Cockayne has shown that the
appreciable contrast which can then be present in the
WB image is due, in the two-beam approximation, to
the interband scattering from Bloch wave 1 to Bloch
wave 2. In the general case, the scattering is from the
branch of the dispersion surface with the largest c(j) to
those branches with the largestCg
</p>
<p>(j), i.e., from the Bloch
wave with the largest amplitude to the one which is most
strongly excited. The dispersion surface for the g(3g)
diffraction geometry is shown in Figure 27.25. It&rsquo;s an
instructive exercise to reread this paragraph thinking
how each statement relates to this figure and to consider
other diffraction geometries, e.g., 0(2g).
</p>
<p>The Bloch-wave analysis of the problem leads to two
further points which simplify the interpretation of WB
images
</p>
<p>&amp; The diffraction conditions should be such that only
one interband scattering process is important.
</p>
<p>&amp; In the two-beam approximation, in order for the
image peaks to show sufficient contrast, it is gener-
ally found that w (= sxg) is greater than �5.
</p>
<p>You can satisfy the first requirement by ensuring
that no reflections are strongly excited. The second
condition is usually already satisfied because of the
more stringent requirement that s should be greater
than 0.2 nm�1. For example, for a f220g reflection in
copper with 100-keV electrons, w is automatically
greater than 8 since xg is 42 nm.
</p>
<p>The g(3.1g) condition may also be preferable to
g(&ndash;1.1g) on theoretical grounds if images are to be com-
pared with computed profiles made using the column
approximation; i.e., it simplifies your interpretation. The
basis for this suggestion is that the region of the dispersion
surface from which the scattering occurs is flatter for the
g(3.1g) diffraction geometry than for the g&eth;g&THORN; case.
</p>
<p>27.9.C If Other Reflections are Present
</p>
<p>Several times in the previous discussion, we have said
that no reflections should be strongly excited. Much of
our thinking has been based on the two-beam approx-
imation we introduced in Chapter 13. When you are
using WB conditions, you must be even more careful.
Consider the g,3g geometry shown in Figure 27.5. We
form the WB image using reflection g so electrons are
weakly scattered from the O beam into the G beam.
However, once in the G beam, they can be strongly
scattered into the 2G beam. We can picture this process
by drawing the new Ewald sphere for the &lsquo;new&rsquo; incident
beam, G; this sphere passes through 2G!
</p>
<p>For the mathematically inclined, you can go back to
the many-beam equations, which we introduced briefly
in Chapter 14. The coupling of beams g and h is deter-
mined by (sg&ndash;sh) and has an extinction distance given by
(xg&ndash;h). If sg and sh are equal, then the coupling between
these beams will be strong. Furthermore, the character-
istic length for the coupling in this example will be x2g&ndash;g
or xg which is what you would have guessed by thinking
about Figure 27.5A and C.
</p>
<p>27.9.D The Future Is Now
</p>
<p>Several new developments are changing how we practice
theWB technique. Themain point here is that you should
remember the principles because they will not change.
</p>
<p>&amp; Slow-scan CCD cameras give a very linear response
and therefore make quantitative analysis of WB
images possible. For this to happen, computer mod-
eling of the defect and simulation of the image will be
needed.Wewill return to this topic in Chapter 30 but
mainly for HRTEM.
</p>
<p>&amp; AnFEGand energy filtering allowus either tominimize
the effect of variations in the energy (decrease diffuse
scattering) or to form WB images using particular sec-
tions of the energy-loss spectrum. To make use of this
extra information, we need to extend the theory.
</p>
<p>&amp; Image processing and frame averaging should allow
us to reduce the noise, aid quantification, and use
WB microscopy for in-situ studies.
</p>
<p>Image simulation, as we described in Section 26.11, will
allow us to be more quantitative in our interpretation of
WB images when we actually have quantitative recording.

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The basic idea of the WB technique is very simple: using a large value of s gives a small xeff
and hence a narrow image of most defects, since the width of a dislocation is related to xeff/3.
What you should remember is that the value of s for a particular diffraction condition g(ng)
depends not only on n and g, but also on the lattice parameter of the crystal and the
wavelength of the electrons. You will see the &lsquo;magic number&rsquo; s=0.2 nm�1 quoted often.
</p>
<p>&amp; Remember that this number gives a rule of thumb if you want to do quantitative
analysis. It does not usually correspond to g(3g).
</p>
<p>&amp; Don&rsquo;t use the g(3g) condition without calculating the value of sg.
&amp; The term s�R has been neglected in this analysis; we usually assume that the deformable-
ion model from Section 25.13 is valid.
</p>
<p>You can often get all the information you need with less effort using a somewhat smaller
value of s. As always, the longer you take to perfect the image, the more likely you are to
alter your specimen, especially the defect structure.
</p>
<p>Finally, remember that the diffracted beam travels parallel to kD. Therefore, the image
of any defect is also projected in this direction. Even though the Bragg angle is small, this
means, for example, that the apparent separation of defects in the imagemay not be equal to
their horizontal separation relative to their glide planes if the defects are located at different
heights in the specimen. This projection error can vary depending on the g and s used to
form the image and the orientation of the specimen.

<p>High-Resolution TEM
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>We will now rethink what we mean by a TEM, in a way that is more suitable for HRTEM,
where the purpose is to maximize the useful detail in the image. (Note the word useful here.)
You should think of the microscope as an optical device that transfers information from the
specimen to the image. The optics consists of a series of lenses and apertures aligned along
the optic (symmetry) axis. What we would like to do is to transfer all the information from
the specimen to the image, a process known as mapping. There are two problems to
overcome and we can never be completely successful in transferring all the information.
First, as you know from Chapter 6, the lens system is not perfect so the image is distorted
and you lose some data because the lens has a finite size (Abbe&rsquo;s theory). The second
problem is we have to interpret the image using an atomistic model for the material. Ideally,
this model will include a full description of the atomic potential and the bonding of the
atoms, but we don&rsquo;t know that either. We will also need to know exactly how many atoms
the electron encountered on its way through the specimen. So most of our task will be
concerned with finding the best compromise and producingmodels for the real situation. To
conclude our discussion of the theory, we will introduce the language of information theory,
which is increasingly used in HRTEM.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge for HRTEM now is interpretation; getting an image that
shows detail finer than 0.2 nm is now routine: correctly interpreting it may not be routine.
This caution is particularly critical when you&rsquo;re examining nanomaterials. We close the
chapter with a review of the experimental applications of HRTEM to include periodic and
non-periodic materials, mixtures of the two, or just single atoms.
</p>
<p>A few words of caution: HRTEM is one of the most important aspects of TEM and is
usually an essential consideration in obtaining funds for a new TEM. This chapter intro-
duces some standard concepts and some ideas that are just beginning to be explored. Some
topics are straightforward; others are exceedingly difficult.
</p>
<p>28.1 THE ROLE OF AN OPTICAL SYSTEM
</p>
<p>What the microscope does is to transform each point on
the specimen into an extended region (at best, a circular
disk) in the final image. Since each point on the speci-
men may be different, we describe the specimen by a
specimen function, f(x,y). The extended region in the
image which corresponds to the point (x,y) in the speci-
men is then described as g(x,y) as shown schematically
in Figure 28.1; note that both f and g are functions of
x and y.
</p>
<p>If you consider two nearby points, A and B, they will
produce two overlapping images gA and gB as shown in
Figure 28.2. If we extend this argument, we can see that
each point in the image has contributions from many
points in the specimen. We express this result mathemat-
ically by
</p>
<p>g r&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
&eth;
</p>
<p>f r0&eth; &THORN;h r� r0&eth; &THORN;dr0 (28:1)
</p>
<p>&frac14; f r&eth; &THORN;� h r� r0&eth; &THORN; (28:2)
</p>
<p>Here h(r &ndash; r0) is a weighting term telling us how much
each point in the specimen contributes to each point in
the image.
</p>
<p>Spence calls h(r) the impulse response function, and
notes that it can only apply to small patches of specimen
</p>
<p>POINT-SPREAD FUNCTION
Since h(r) describes how a point spreads into a disk, it
is known as the point-spread function or smearing
function, and g(r) is called the convolution of f(r)
with h(r).

<p>which lie in the same plane and are close to the optic
axis. The symbol � indicates that the two functions,
f and h, are &lsquo;folded together&rsquo; (multiplied and integrated)
or &lsquo;convoluted with one another.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>28.2 THE RADIO ANALOGY
</p>
<p>We can compare this imaging process with the task of
recording the sound of an orchestra on a record/tape/
CD or even transmitting to the brain directly or via a
radio. We want to hear the loud drum and quiet flute
(large amplitude and small amplitude); we want to hear
the high note on the violin and the low note on the
double bass (high frequency and low frequency). Our
audio amplifier has limits on both the low and high
</p>
<p>frequencies, so we won&rsquo;t achieve perfect reproduction.
The importance of amplitude is obvious as discussed in
Chapter 22, but how do we define frequency in a TEM
image? High frequency in audio is related to 1/t; fre-
quencies in lattice images are related to 1/x. So the high
spatial frequencies simply correspond to small dis-
tances. What we are looking for in high-resolution
work are the high spatial frequencies. Notice our use
of high/low and large/small.
</p>
<p>Figure 28.2 shows two points A and B in the speci-
men and their disk images on the screen. We see disks
(see our discussion of the Rayleigh disk in Chapter 6)

<p>or g(r). It has a unique value for each value of (x,y), so we say it is a

<p>because the lens system is not perfect. We can also write
g(x,y), the intensity of an image at point (x,y), as g(r),
and in the simplest case, these disks have uniform inten-
sity. We can always represent any function in two
dimensions as a sum of sine waves.

<p>Here u is a reciprocal-lattice vector, the spatial fre-
quency for a particular direction. We have expressed
g(r) in terms of a combination of the possible values of
G(u), where G(u) is known as the Fourier transform of
g(r). We can now define two other Fourier transforms
</p>
<p>F(u) is the Fourier transform of f(r),
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>H(u) is the Fourier transform of h(r).
</p>
<p>Since h(r) tells us how information in real space is
transferred from the specimen to the image,H(u) tells us
how information (or contrast) in u space is transferred
to the image.
</p>
<p>H(u) is the contrast transfer function.

</p>
<p>We will give a simple (simplified) derivation of this
equation in Section 28.6. It builds on the concepts we
discussed in Chapter 6 when we examined the origin
of Cs.
</p>
<p>Summarizing so far: High spatial frequencies corre-
spond to large distances from the optic axis in the DP.
The rays which pass through the lens at these large
distances are bent through a larger angle by the objec-
tive lens. They are not focused at the same point by the
lens, because of spherical aberration, and thus cause a
spreading of the point in the image. The result is that the
objective lens magnifies the image but confuses the fine
detail. The resolution we require in HRTEM is limited
by this &lsquo;confusion&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&amp; Each point in the specimen plane is transformed into
an extended region (or disk) in the final image.
</p>
<p>&amp; Each point in the final image has contributions from
many points in the specimen.
</p>
<p>We now have to go back and look at how we can
represent the specimen. That is, what is f(r) in equation
28.1? (We&rsquo;ll use the coordinates r and x,y interchange-
ably in this discussion; the former is more compact but
we can extend the latter notation to emphasize the pos-
sibility of a z component.)
</p>
<p>28.3 THE SPECIMEN
</p>
<p>Since we are using a TEM, we call the specimen func-
tion, f(r), the specimen transmission function. Here you
have to be very careful to remember that we are going to
</p>
<p>FOURIER TRANSFORM
The Fourier transform of a function is an expression
of that function as a &lsquo;sum&rsquo; of frequencies; it is the
frequency-domain representation of the function.
</p>
<p>OVERFOCUS
Df &gt; 0 is known as overfocus. It means we have
focused the objective lens on a plane above the speci-
men. (By above, we mean before the electrons reach
the specimen; the story is the same if the microscope
is upside down!)
</p>
<p>LINEAR
What we need for our analysis to &lsquo;work&rsquo; is a &lsquo;linear
relationship between the image and the weak speci-
men potential.&rsquo;

<p>use amodel to represent the specimen and themodel will
make certain assumptions. A general model would
describe f(r) as
</p>
<p>f x; y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; A x; y&eth; &THORN; exp �ift x; y&eth; &THORN;&eth; &THORN; (28:9)
</p>
<p>where A(x,y) is the amplitude (not the aperture func-
tion) and ft(x,y) is the phase which depends on the
thickness of the specimen.
</p>
<p>For our application to HRTEM, we simplify our
model further by setting A(x,y) = 1; i.e., we set the
incident wave amplitude to be unity. We can show that
the phase change only depends on the potentialV(x,y,z)
which the electron sees as it passes through the specimen
(by following Van Dyck&rsquo;s argument). We will assume
that the specimen is so thin that we can write down a
projected potential Vt (x,y) with t being the thickness of
the specimen, as usual.

</p>
<p>What we are doing is creating a two-dimensional pro-
jection of the crystal structure; this approach is critical
to much of our interpretation of HRTEM images.
</p>
<p>We can relate the wavelength, l, of the electrons in
vacuum to the energy. (Ideally, l should have its relati-
vistic value, but the principle is correct.)

</p>
<p>V x; y; z&eth; &THORN;dz &frac14; sVt x; y&eth; &THORN; (28:19)
</p>
<p>where Vt (x,y) is the potential projected in the
z-direction.
</p>
<p>We call s the interaction constant. (See more discus-
sion of s in Chapter 3 but be careful&mdash;all ss are not the
same.) This s tends to a constant value as V increases,
since the energy of the electron is proportional to E or
l�1 (i.e., changes in the two variables, l and E, tend to
compensate for one another).
</p>
<p>Now, we can take account of absorption by includ-
ing a function m(x,y) so that our specimen transfer
function f(x,y) is now given by
</p>
<p>f x; y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; exp �isVt x; y&eth; &THORN; � m x; y&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � (28:20)
</p>
<p>The effect of this model is that, apart from m(x,y), we
have represented the specimen as a &lsquo;phase object.&rsquo; This
is known as the phase-object approximation or POA.
We are actually lucky because the absorption will
usually be small in the regime where the rest of the
approximation holds.
</p>
<p>We can simplify the model further if the specimen is
very thin, so that Vt(x,y) is �1. Then we expand the
exponential function, neglecting m and higher-order
terms, so that f(x,y) becomes
</p>
<p>f x; y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; 1� isVt x; y&eth; &THORN; (28:21)
</p>
<p>Now we have reached the weak phase-object approxi-
mation or the WPOA. We see that the WPOA essen-
tially says that, for a very thin specimen, the amplitude
of a transmitted wave function will be linearly related to
</p>
<p>THE INTERACTION CONSTANT
This s is not the stress or the scattering cross section.
It is another elastic interaction.
</p>
<p>POA
In general, the phase-object approximation only
holds for thin specimens.

<p>the projected potential of the specimen. Note that in this
model the projected potential is taking account of var-
iations in the z-direction, and is thus very different for
an electron passing through the center of an atom com-
pared to one passing through its outer regions.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are software packages that allow us
to calculate what an image will look like for a particular
specimen geometry. However, youmust always remember
that a model has been used to represent the specimen and
have a clear understanding of its limits. To emphasize this
last point, bear in mind that the WPOA fails for an
electron wave passing through the center of a single ura-
nium atom! An atomic layer of U would be too thick for
the WPOA. As a second example, Fejes has shown that,
for the complex oxide Ti2Nb10O27, the WPOA is only
valid if the specimen thickness is &lt;0.6nm! The good
news is that the approach appears to be more widely
applicable than these particular estimates would suggest.
</p>
<p>28.4 APPLYING THE WPOA TO THE TEM
</p>
<p>So far our treatment has been quite general, but now we
use our WPOA model. If we use the expression for f(r)
given by equation 28.21, then equation 28.2 tells us that
the wave function as seen in the image is given by
</p>
<p>c x; y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; �isVt x; y&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � � h x; y&eth; &THORN; (28:22)
</p>
<p>If we represent h(x,y) as cos (x,y) + i sin (x,y), then
c(x,y) becomes
</p>
<p>c x; y&eth; &THORN; &frac14;1&thorn; sVt x; y&eth; &THORN; � sin x; y&eth; &THORN;�
isVt x; y&eth; &THORN; � cos x; y&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>(28:23)
</p>
<p>As usual, the intensity is given by
</p>
<p>I &frac14; cc� &frac14; cj j2 (28:24)
</p>
<p>Multiplying this out and neglecting terms in s2 (because
s is small), we find that
</p>
<p>I &frac14; 1&thorn; 2sVt x; y&eth; &THORN; � sin x; y&eth; &THORN; (28:25)
</p>
<p>Knowing this result we can say that, in theWPOA, only
the imaginary part of B(u) in equation 28.7 contributes
to the intensity in equation 28.24 (because it gives
the imaginary part of h(x,y)). Thus, we can set
B(u)=2 sin w(u) rather than exp(i w(u)). (Notice the 2!)
</p>
<p>We can now define a new quantity, T(u), which we
could call the intensity transfer function to distinguish it
from H(u). It&rsquo;s given by
</p>
<p>T u&eth; &THORN; &frac14; A u&eth; &THORN;E u&eth; &THORN;2 sinw u&eth; &THORN; (28:26)
</p>
<p>Note that T(u) is not identical toH(u), which we defined
in equation 28.6. The &lsquo;2&rsquo; in equation 28.26 is the &lsquo;2&rsquo; in
</p>
<p>equation 28.25 and arises because we are interested in
the intensity in the beam, and therefore we multiplied c
by its complex conjugate in equation 28.24. You may
also see authors use a negative sign in equation 28.26 (in
particular, in Reimer&rsquo;s text). This has the effect of
inverting the graph of B(u) versus u and making
B(u)&gt;0 for positive phase contrast.
</p>
<p>A note on terminology. You will often see T(u) rather
than H(u) called the contrast transfer function in the
HRTEM literature. This terminology comes from the
analysis of the imaging process for incoherent light in
visible-light optics. With coherent illumination, T(u)
and H(u) are identical. The smearing function (point-
spread function) for that case is the Fourier transform
of the CTF. The equation describing T(u) was derived
for the situation where we have coherent imaging. For
incoherent light the smearing function would be
</p>
<p>cos2 x; y&eth; &THORN; &thorn; sin2 x; y&eth; &THORN; (28:27)
</p>
<p>which is just unity.
So the CTF in HRTEM would be different from
</p>
<p>T(u), and therefore we will call T(u) the objective lens
transfer function.
</p>
<p>28.5 THE TRANSFER FUNCTION
</p>
<p>Youmust note two things here. First, as we just said, the
transfer function, T(u), formulation applies to any spec-
imen, and second, T(u) is not the CTF of HRTEM. The
problem with this formulation is that the image wave
function is not an observable quantity!What we observe
in an image is contrast, or the equivalent in optical
density, current readout, etc., and this is not linearly
related to the object wave function. Fortunately, there
is a linear relation involving observable quantities under
the special circumstances, where the specimen acts as a
WPO.
</p>
<p>If the specimen acts as a weak-phase object, then the
transfer function T(u) is sometimes called the CTF,
because there is no amplitude contribution, and the
output of the transmission system is an observable
quantity (image contrast). The transfer function appro-
priate for this image formation process has the form
</p>
<p>TRANSFER FUNCTION
When T(u) is negative, positive phase contrast results,
meaning that atoms would appear dark against a
bright background. When T(u) is positive, negative
phase contrast results, meaning that atoms would
appear bright against a dark background. When
T(u) = 0, there is no detail in the image for this
value of u. (Note that we assume here that Cs &gt;0.)
</p>
<p>28 .5 THE TRANSFER FUNCT ION ............................................................................................................................................................. 487</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>which we derived above (equation 28.26) and if we
ignore E(u),
</p>
<p>T&eth;u&THORN; &frac14; 2A&eth;u&THORN; sin w&eth;u&THORN; (28:28)
</p>
<p>where we know that A(u) is the aperture function and
might call w(u) the phase-distortion function.
</p>
<p>Assuming that astigmatism can be properly cor-
rected, the phase-distortion function is the sum of two
terms. If the CTF is now compared to the phase-distor-
tion function, a number of observations can be made.
Note that the CTF is oscillatory; there are &lsquo;bands&rsquo; of
good transmission separated by &lsquo;gaps&rsquo; (zeros) where no
transmission occurs.
</p>
<p>The CTF shows maxima (meaning maximum trans-
fer of contrast) whenever the phase-distortion function
assumes multiple odd values of �p/2. Zero contrast
occurs for w(u) = multiple �p.
</p>
<p>The reason that negative T(u) gives positive phase
contrast is that there is a phase shift of &ndash;p/2 due to
diffraction. If a diffracted beam is further phase shifted
by &ndash;p/2, it subtracts amplitude from the forward scat-
tered beam, causing atoms to appear dark (positive
contrast). If the same beam is instead phase shifted by
+p/2, it adds amplitude to the forward scattered beam
(they are &lsquo;in phase&rsquo;), causing atoms to appear bright
(negative contrast).
</p>
<p>28.6 MORE ON w(u), sin w(u), AND cos w(u)
</p>
<p>The ideal form of T(u) would be a constant value as u
increases, as shown in Figure 28.3; T(u) must be zero at
u=0 but, since small values of u correspond to very
large values of x (i.e., long distances in the specimen),
this is not a problem. If T(u) is large, it means that
information with a periodicity or spatial frequency cor-
responding to that value of u will be strongly trans-
mitted, i.e., it will appear in the image. What we then
need is that the different values of u give the same
contrast. Then all the atoms in a crystal appear as
black spots, say, rather than some as black spots and
others as white spots; if the latter occurs, interpretation
will be difficult!
</p>
<p>We will now go through a simple exercise to produce
an expression for w(u). If we combine the effects of the
spherical aberration (equation 6.14) and the defocus
(equations 11.18) of the objective lens, we find that a
point at the specimen will actually be imaged as a disk
with radius d(y).
</p>
<p>d y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; Csy3 &thorn; Df y (28:29)
</p>
<p>Due to the spherical aberration of the objective lens and
the finite value of Df, the rays which pass through the
objective lens at angle y are not focused on the Gaussian
image plane. If we only had one value of y, we would still
be all right! Of course, we have a range of values, so we
average (integrate) these with respect to y to give
</p>
<p>D y&eth; &THORN; &frac14;

<p>or since yB is small
</p>
<p>2yB ffi lg (28:32)
</p>
<p>USEFUL u
T(u) becomes zero again at u = u1; what we would
like is for u1 to be as large as possible. If T(u) crosses
the u-axis the sign of the transfer function reverses.
This means that u1 defines the limit at which our
image may be quite directly interpreted; it is a very
important parameter.

</p>
<p>w(u)
In other words, the phase-distortion function has the
form of a phase shift expressed as 2p/l times the path
difference traveled by those waves affected by sphe-
rical aberration (Cs), defocus (Dz), and astigmatism
(Ca).

</p>
<p>3u4 (28:34)
</p>
<p>which we quoted as equation 28.8. Clearly sin w(u) will
be a complicated curve which will depend on the values
of Cs (the lens quality), l (the accelerating voltage), Df
(the defocus value you choose to form the image), and u
(the spatial frequency). This topic is addressed in a novel
way in the companion text; see also Section 3.3 of John
Spence&rsquo;s book; most of us just start with equation 28.34
and this reasonable justification.
</p>
<p>The best way to appreciate the importance of w is to
use one of the simulation packages discussed in Chapter
30 and vary each of the parameters one by one. The plot
of T(u) (=2 sinw) versus u, shown in Figure 28.4, illus-
trates the main features. The curve has been drawn for
Cs=1mm, E0=200kV, and a defocus value of &ndash;58 nm.
</p>
<p>The important features of this curve are shown in
Figures 28.4&ndash;28.6
</p>
<p>&amp; sin w starts at 0 and decreases.When u is small, theDf
term dominates.
</p>
<p>&amp; sin w first crosses the u-axis at u1 and then repeatedly
crosses the u-axis as u increases.
</p>
<p>&amp; w can continue forever but, in practice, it is modified
by other functions which we discuss in Section 28.8.
</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve selected your microscope and its objec-
tive lens, youhave fixedCs (unless youhave aTEMwith a
Cs corrector);Cs does depend to some extent on the l you
choose. The curve of T(u) versus u does not depend on
your specimen. Figure 28.5 shows a series of sinw curves
</p>
<p>for an imaginary 200-kV microscope where Cs has been
changed. In each case, the &lsquo;best&rsquo; curve (we&rsquo;ll discuss this in
a moment) has been chosen. You can appreciate that the
smaller Cs values give the larger u1 values; so a small Cs
means we can achieve a higher spatial resolution.

<p>If instead we fix Cs and again plot the best curves,
but this time varying l, you can see that the smallest
value of l allows us to achieve a higher spatial resolu-
tion. The result is not surprising; we want a smallCs and
a small l or a high voltage. So we choose themicroscope
to optimize Cs and l. Now we only have Df to vary. The
set of curves shown in Figure 28.6 illustrates the effect of
varying Df. Notice how the bump in the curve at u2 will
eventually increase as Df increases until it crosses the
u-axis so that u1 is suddenly much smaller. If we just
make Df smaller, then u1 steadily decreases. In the next
section we will discuss the optimum value for Df.
</p>
<p>28.7 SCHERZER DEFOCUS
</p>
<p>The presence of zeros in the CTF means that we have
gaps in the output spectrum which do not contribute to
the output signal: it&rsquo;s as if these frequencies were filtered
out. Obviously, the best transfer function is the one with
the fewest zeros, which would be the case for a perfect
lens, for example. What Scherzer did back in 1949 was
to notice that the CTF could be optimized by balancing
the effect of spherical aberration against a particular
negative value of Df. This value has come to be known
as &lsquo;Scherzer defocus,&rsquo; DfSch which occurs at
</p>
<p>DfSch &frac14; �1:2&eth;Csl&THORN;1=2 (28:35)
</p>
<p>At this defocus (which we&rsquo;ll derive below) all the
beams will have nearly constant phase out to the
&lsquo;first crossover&rsquo; of the zero axis. This crossover point
is defined as the instrumental resolution limit. This is
the best performance that can be expected from a
microscope unless we use image processing schemes
to extract more information. In other words, this is
not the information limit but it is the limit where we
can use nearly intuitive arguments to interpret what
we see. Again, as we discussed in Chapter 6 when we
defined image resolution, you will see other authors
give different values for the constant rather than the
1.2 given in equation 28.34; remember that this num-
ber is a calculated value, so it does depend on the
details of your approximations.
</p>
<p>This definition of resolution has new implications.
The Rayleigh criterion which we used in Chapter 6, was
only concerned with the ability to distinguish closely
spaced point objects by eye. Our new definition requires
a flat response in the object spectrum, and the goal is to
have as many beams as possible being transferred
through the optical system with identical phase, i.e.,
within the flat response regime. This is the underlying
principle governing phase-contrast imaging in
HRTEM.

<p>The closest we can get to the ideal curve in Figure
28.6 occurs when w(u) is close to &ndash;1208; then sinwwill be
near &ndash;1 when w is between &ndash;1208 and &ndash;608. We know
that when w= p, sinw=0 sowewant sinw to be as large
as possible over a large range of u; sin w will be a nearly
flat function if dw/du is zero. So we look for the value of

<p>DETAIL AND INFORMATION
A TEM image with detail of 0.66 Å was demon-
strated in 1970 when the interpretable resolution
was about 3.3 Å. So just because you can see detail
in the image does not mean that you can gain useful
information about your specimen.

<p>28.39 and 28.41 are so important in HRTEM that
Hawkes has designated them to be the units 1 Sch and
1Gl (the scherzer and the glaser) in honor of two of the
most noted pioneers of HRTEM.Notice that these units
vary depending on the microscope you&rsquo;re using!
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find it interesting to plot the phase shift due to
varying of Df and Cs using EMS (Section 1.6). An
excellent, though advanced, discussion of such diagrams
is given by Thon, who describes how they can be used to
design phase plates for the TEM. Spence shows how you
can use a plot of nu�2 versus u2 to help you determine
experimental values of Df and Cs; see Figure 31.6A.
</p>
<p>28.8 ENVELOPE DAMPING FUNCTIONS
</p>
<p>The plots of w(u) as a function of u could extend out as
far as you want to plot them. In practice, they don&rsquo;t
because of the envelope damping function. In other
words, the w(u) plot stops where it does because the
microscope is incapable of imaging the finest detail
due to reasons other than the simple transfer character-
istics of a linear system.
</p>
<p>We know from Chapters 5 and 6 that resolution is
also limited by the spatial coherence of the source and
by chromatic effects. We can include these effects in our
analysis of images by imposing an envelope function on
the transfer function. The result is that higher spatial
frequencies that might normally pass through higher-
order windows are in fact damped out, as shown in the
plot in Figure 28.7B.
</p>
<p>The exact mathematical form of these envelope func-
tions is complex. In general, the result is described by
multiplying the (objective lens) transfer functionT(u) by
both the chromatic aberration envelope Ec and the spa-
tial coherence envelope Ea to yield an effective transfer
function Teff(u).

<p>lens, regardless of the setting of focus. If we are going to
use a physical aperture to remove unwanted noise, we
should make it no larger than the &lsquo;virtual aperture&rsquo;
present due to this envelope. The presence of this virtual
aperture means that higher-order passbands are simply
not accessible. This cut-off thus imposes a new resolu-
tion limit on the microscope. This is what we earlier
called the &lsquo;information retrieval limit&rsquo; or simply the
&lsquo;information limit.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>If we keep these restrictions in mind then we can say
that, up to the instrumental resolution limit, phase-con-
trast images are directly (i.e., intuitively) interpretable;
this limit is set by the crossover at Scherzer defocus or
the envelope function, i.e., whichever equals zero first. If
the information limit is beyond the Scherzer resolution
limit, we need to use image-simulation software (see
Chapter 30) to interpret any detail beyond the Scherzer
limit.
</p>
<p>So you can image columns of atoms along the inci-
dent-beam direction and their positions are faithfully
rendered with respect to one another up to Scherzer
resolution. If the microscope is operated at different
defocus values, the crossovers in the transfer function
make image interpretation more indirect and you have
to resort to using computer simulation.
</p>
<p>28.9 IMAGING USING PASSBANDS
</p>
<p>Because of the focus dependence of the CTF, you, the
microscope operator, have control over its overall form.
For example, the worst case of contrast transfer is where
all contrast is minimized. This minimum contrast (MC)
defocus condition (DfMC) is also known as the dark-field
focus condition in STEM imaging and occurs for a
special value of w.
</p>
<p>sin w u&eth; &THORN; &frac14; 0:3 (28:43)
or
</p>
<p>DfMC &frac14; �0:44&eth;Csl&THORN;1=2 (28:44)
</p>
<p>The importance of this focus setting is that when you are
actually working on the TEM, you can recognize this
focus setting visually on the TEM screen, since it occurs
when you can&rsquo;t see anything! If you adjust the focus to
this condition visually, you then have a reference point
fromwhich you can change to the Scherzer defocus. The
procedure is actually quite simple (after lots of practice),
since you can minimize the contrast easily, providing
you have correctly aligned themicroscope and corrected
the astigmatism.
</p>
<p>Some other special settings of the CTF may also be
useful. The idea is to make use of passbands or large
&lsquo;windows&rsquo; in the CTF to allow higher spatial frequencies
to contribute to the image. As you see in Figure 28.8,
what this requires is that w is constant, or dw/du small,
</p>
<p>over a range of u which includes the reflection of inter-
est. These passbands occur periodically with underfocus
at values set by
</p>
<p>Df np &frac14; �f&eth;&frac12;8n&thorn; 3�=2&THORN;&eth;Csl&THORN;g
1=2
</p>
<p>(28:45)
</p>
<p>This formula is not an exact relationship but it gives us a
good guide; its derivation is given by Spence. The n=0
passband is, in fact, equivalent to the Scherzer defocus
setting. This technique gives us access to higher spatial
frequencies and thus finer detail in real space. The price
we pay is that there are now zeros in the transfer func-
tion at lower spatial frequencies. For some applications,
the presence of these zeros may be a problem, but for
others, useful information can be obtained in these
higher passband settings. For a microscope like the
JEM 200 CX, these passband settings are &ndash;66 nm
(Scherzer, or n=1), &ndash;129 nm (n=2), &ndash;169 nm (n=3),
&ndash;202 nm (n=4), etc. Note that all are negative values of
focus.
</p>
<p>Hashimoto and Endoh defined an &lsquo;aberration-free
focus&rsquo; (AFF) condition for any specific crystal. The idea
is to set the transfer function so that the gaps will only
occur between Bragg reflections. All Bragg reflections
would then see a window in the CTF out to very high
order. This aberration-free focus setting is defined by
</p>
<p>DfAFFb 2 4m� 0:23&eth; &THORN;Csl3=d 4
� �
</p>
<p>d 2=2l
� �
</p>
<p>(28:46)
</p>
<p>wherem=0, 1, 2, 3, etc., and d is the fundamental lattice
spacing of the first-order Bragg beam to be resolved.
Applying this equation to aAu crystal in the [001] orienta-
tion where d(020) = 0.2035nm, using a 100-kV micro-
scope with Cs = 0.75mm, gives DfAFF = &ndash;53.3nm.
At this setting of focus, the transfer function peaked at
&ndash;2 for beams 020, 220, 040, 420, 440, and 060.
</p>
<p>There is, of course, a catch. We can only use this
technique when we know which spatial frequencies we
are interested in. In other words, it is great for perfect
crystals since we are only concernedwith Bragg peaks. If
defects are present we will then lose much of the infor-
mation about the defect, since defects scatter between

<p>the Bragg peaks. Any information falling in the gap of
the CTF is lost to the image: in effect, the defect will be
invisible!
</p>
<p>You should therefore be very cautious in using higher
passband settings. Youmay obtain a pretty picture which
does not give a true image of your specimen. If you douse
higher-order passbands, you must realize that you are
imaging the specimen beyond the instrumental resolution
limit so you can&rsquo;t use the intuitive approach for image
interpretation. You must know exactly where the zeros
are in the CTF. You can only know that by very careful
evaluation of your images using diffractograms, comput-
er simulation, and image processing.
</p>
<p>28.10 EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
</p>
<p>Whenever you are usingHRTEMimaging, youmust first
ask what information you are hoping to obtain. Lattice-
fringe images which show lots of straight lines but tell you
nothing of where the atoms are located may be all that
you need. These fringes are giving you information about
the crystal orientation on a very fine scale. Another situa-
tion is illustrated by early studies of spinel. You would
like to obtain information at, say, 0.23 nm (the spacing of
the oxygen 111 planes), but your point-to-point resolu-
tion is 0.27 nm.You could still learn a lot about the spinel
from the 46nm spinel (111) planes, so youmight even use
an aperture to remove informationwhich only adds unin-
terpretable detail below 0.46 nm. The difficulty comes
when you want to relate your HRTEM image to the
atomic structure of your specimen. Then you must
remember that all of the above treatment is based upon
the TEM specimen behaving as a WPO. Most specimens
of interest do not satisfy this criterion.
</p>
<p>If you look at a typical HRTEM specimen, there will
be a wedge-shaped region near the thinnest edge, and
thickness extinction contours will be visible. As soon as
the first contour is visible, the specimen is already much
too thick to behave as aWPO!Multiple scattering limits
most phase-contrast imaging conditions for crystalline
materials.
</p>
<p>Thicker specimens also are susceptible to Fresnel
effects associated with spreading of the wave front as it
is transmitted through more of the specimen along the
beam direction. Inelastic scattering effects, etc., will also
</p>
<p>become important as the thickness increases. These effects
are not easy to simulate in the computer, although the
techniques we will discuss in Chapter 30 are very helpful.
</p>
<p>To be really sure that you have correctly interpreted
the image, the match between experimental and simu-
lated images should be good over a range of thicknesses
anddefocus values, aswe&rsquo;ll seemore clearly inChapter 30.
</p>
<p>We can now summarize the ten steps you need to take
to obtain a phase-contrast image with atomic resolution
</p>
<p>&amp; Choose an instrument of low Cs and small l.
&amp; Align it well; it will take time for the electronics and
moving parts to become stable.
</p>
<p>&amp; Work with an undersaturated LaB6 filament and a
small condenser aperture (unless you have an FEG:
see later).
</p>
<p>&amp; Perform current and voltage centering of the
objective lens routinely and frequently at high
magnification.
</p>
<p>&amp; Work in thin, flat, and clean regions of the specimen.
&amp; Orient the specimen using small SAD apertures or
bend contours in the image, so the beam is aligned
along a zone axis.
</p>
<p>&amp; Correct the astigmatism, using optical diffracto-
grams if necessary, but ideally on-line (Chapter 31).
</p>
<p>&amp; Find the minimum-contrast focus setting and record
a through-focus series.
</p>
<p>&amp; Record the DP at the same setting of the condenser;
calculate a, the convergence angle, and remember
that angle means semiangle!
</p>
<p>&amp; Simulate and/or process the images using available
computer codes (Chapter 30).
</p>
<p>A comment on alignment: You&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s rela-
tively straightforward to align the electron beam with
the current center or voltage center. The result is an
image which does not shift as the current changes in
the objective lens or the accelerating voltage fluctuates.
As you&rsquo;ll appreciate more from Chapter 31, for the
highest resolution, it is also critical that the incident
beam is precisely parallel to the optic axis of the micro-
scope. If the incident beam is not exactly aligned with
the optic axis we can see the coma aberration, which is
only important at the highest resolution. (A discussion
of other aberrations is given in the companion text.) We
refer to the process of aligning the beam with the optic
axis as &lsquo;coma-free alignment.&rsquo; The process involves
alternately applying equal and opposite beam tilts to
the incident beam; you choose the magnitude of the tilt
to match the periodicity in the image. If there is a
residual beam tilt of the incident beam away from the
optic axis, then one image will look more distorted than
the other. Adjust the beam tilt controls until both tilted
images look equally distorted. Repeat this procedure for
the orthogonal direction. You will need a lot of practice
to do this successfully (see Section 30.5).
</p>
<p>MULTIPLE AND PLURAL
Note that the HRTEM community uses the term
&lsquo;multiple scattering&rsquo; to denote &gt;1 scattering event.
This terminology differs from that used by analytical
microscopists, who define &lsquo;multiple&rsquo; as &gt;20 scatter-
ing events and reserve &lsquo;plural&rsquo; for 2&ndash;20 events. In
HRTEM you never hear of &lsquo;plural scattering.&rsquo;

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Some final remarks on experimental techniques: Always
remember that specimen orientation is very critical for
HRTEM. Always be aware of contamination and
damage caused by the electron beam; the specimen
will have changed long before you can see the change
by eye. Although HRTEM is now so much easier
because high-quality CCD video cameras are available
to give you an image at TV rates, don&rsquo;t spend any
longer than you have to with the beam on the area of
interest in your specimen. Get used to using the CCD
and the computer. If you are going to do quantitative
HRTEM, you&rsquo;ll have to be comfortable with both. Of
course, if you use a remote microscope you aren&rsquo;t even
sitting near the screen.
</p>
<p>28.11 THE FUTURE FOR HRTEM
</p>
<p>The historical approach to HRTEM was: be pleased if
you recorded what you saw. Now machines are suffi-
ciently stable that we can reliably record images at
different values of Df. Certainly as important is the
availability of computers, as we will discuss in Chapters
30 and 31, since we can &lsquo;predict&rsquo; the image for model
structures and quantify the contrast of the image. We
are thus able to do quantitative HRTEM (QHRTEMor
HRQTEM!).
</p>
<p>Another approach to improve resolution is provided
by the FEG TEM. The beam in an FEG TEM is now
more highly coherent, so the envelope function shown in
Figure 28.7 extends to greater values of u. The computer
becomes indispensable because we have to interpret
images which have contrast reversals beyond Scherzer
defocus. If a set of carefully designed multipole lenses is
inserted into an HRTEM (by the manufacturer), it is
possible to correct Cs or even make it variable like Df.
</p>
<p>If you use such a Cs-corrected TEM, you have to
rethink your approach to HRTEM. Think what will
happen to the scherzer and the glaser. What will the
Gl/Sch be? The corrector proposed by Rose was
shown schematically in Figure 6.12B. The actual correc-
tor, incorporated into a 200-kV JEOLTEM, is shown in
Figure 28.9 (with the covers removed); it significantly
increased the height of the column. It is a combination
of round lenses and hexapoles, all of which are magnetic
elements. The hexapoles don&rsquo;t affect the paraxial path
of the rays and only need to be stabilized to an accuracy
</p>
<p>of 1 in 104 to give atomic resolution.WhenCs is zero, the
specimen resolution limit will be determined by Cc

</p>
<p>If Cc = 2mm and DE 	 0.3 eV, a 200-kV FEG TEM
could achieve a resolution of 0.8 Å. If Cc is also cor-
rected, which we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 40, it is possible that
the resolution will become limited by the fifth-order
spherical aberration constant. In practice, it will be
important to correct Cc in the lens design first. In
Rose&rsquo;s original Cs-correcting lens, Cs = 3mm and the
resolution limit is 0.28 Å for this 200-kV FEG TEM.
Other lens defects will limit this to 	0.5 Å but with a
price of $12 M for a 1.25-MeV machine which changes
your specimen in seconds, the Rose corrector will be
quite important!
</p>
<p>28.12 THE TEM AS A LINEAR SYSTEM
</p>
<p>The discussion we went through above is an example of
a much larger topic known as information theory. The
concept of a &lsquo;phase-contrast transfer function&rsquo; is central
to this field. So you can understand the practice of
</p>
<p>FIGURE 28.9. The post-objective lens corrector system as incorporated
</p>
<p>into a 200-kV JEOL TEM; it looks sleeker in the finished product. (See
</p>
<p>also Figure 6.12B.)
</p>
<p>COMA
If a point object on the optic axis is imaged as a point,
a similar point object off the axis may appear dis-
torted. This distortion is known as coma or comatic
aberration. In a telescope, the point (a star) would
look like a comet&mdash;a cometary coma. (Coma: Latin
for hair.)

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>phase-contrast imaging at high resolution, we will
briefly discuss the way an information specialist might
view this process. We will define the transfer function in
elementary terms, andmake detailed reference to phase-
contrast imaging in the TEM.
</p>
<p>Remember, the purpose of the TEM is to transmit
information about the specimen to the image. We can
thus consider the microscope to be an &lsquo;information
channel&rsquo; and use the concepts of information theory.
</p>
<p>&amp; The input signal comes from the specimen.
&amp; The output signal is the image.
</p>
<p>If we neglect the effects of noise, there is a unique
relation between the input signal and the output signal,
determined by the optical system of the microscope.
</p>
<p>Most information theory treats linear systems. A
linear system is one which is characterized by the prop-
erty that if
</p>
<p>S0(r0) ! Transmission System ! S1(r1),
</p>
<p>and if
</p>
<p>S
0
0(r0) ! Transmission System ! S
</p>
<p>0
1(r1),
</p>
<p>(the prime here denotes the derivative) then the system is
linear if
</p>
<p>a(S0) + b(S
0
0)! Transmission System! a(S1) + b(S
</p>
<p>0
1)
</p>
<p>for any values of a and b. (It&rsquo;s like linear elasticity where
we can simply add stresses and strains.)
</p>
<p>The linear relation between input and output
signals can be described by the concept of the CTF.
Overall, the transfer function relates an input spectrum
to an output spectrum, and it operates only in the
frequency domain.
</p>
<p>In general, for a linear system, if we know the CTF,
then the relation between S0 and S1 is uniquely defined.
On the other hand, if the relation between S0 and S1 could
be empirically determined, then we can deduce the CTF.
</p>
<p>One of the best examples of a linear system is an
electrical transmission cable. The transfer of electrical
signals through transmission lines can be made linear
enough for the above theory to apply. Conversely, the
transfer of mass-thickness information from a specimen
</p>
<p>to the optical density of a developed photographic nega-
tive is far from linear, and the above theory does not
apply. Then why bother to discuss this in HRTEM? The
answer lies in finding an appropriate linear relation
between the object and the image.
</p>
<p>28.13 FEG TEMs AND THE INFORMATION
LIMIT
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned that an FEG reduces the instrumental
contribution to chromatic aberrations and extends the
envelope function to larger values of u. This means that
information with higher spatial frequencies is trans-
ferred to the image. We&rsquo;ve just analyzed the Scherzer
defocus problem, so now we&rsquo;ll consider the information
limit. The reason for emphasizing the FEG here is that it
really makes a difference and we&rsquo;re just beginning to
learn how to use this information: the contrast reversals
mean that any image interpretation is not intuitive. The
topic has been laid out in two papers by Van Dyck and
de Jong but be warned&mdash;this topic is exceedingly tricky!
</p>
<p>Since the information limit is determined by the
envelope function, this is split into its separate terms.
The total envelope function, ET(u), is the product of all
of these (like equation 28.5).

energy spread in the electron gun. Notice that DE and
DV are different: DV depends on how well we can con-
trol the voltage supply whereas DE depends on our
choice of electron source (see Chapter 5). If we neglect

<p>&amp; Delocalization of the information in the image.
&amp; The finite pixel size.
</p>
<p>The idea is simple but the math is more difficult.
Let&rsquo;s assume that the image which is actually captured
by the camera is circular.We can then say that ifR is less
than Rw, the radius of the window, then we capture the
information; if it&rsquo;s greater than Rw, we don&rsquo;t. So the
CCD detector is acting like an aperture! Now de Jong
and Van Dyck show how umax is related to Rw

<p>The important result is that the delocalization of the

<p>Table 28.1 gives some numerical examples of what these
equations mean.
</p>
<p>To see whether we will ever reach the information
limit, we have to consider the effect of the noise.
We know that the signal-to-noise ratio is proportional
</p>
<p>to b1/2, where b is the brightness of the electron gun. The
smallest image element we need to examine has an area
ri
</p>
<p>2. Then the background signal I0 is given by
</p>
<p>I0 &frac14; Dr2i &frac14; bpa2tr2i (28:65)
</p>
<p>where D is the electron dose, a is the angle of conver-
gence, and t is the time.
</p>
<p>For white noise, the noise in an element will be
related to I0
</p>
<p>1/2. The total contrast in our small pixel
can be written as DEFri
</p>
<p>2 where D is the dose, E is the
envelope function, F is the structure factor, and ri
</p>
<p>2 is the
area of the pixel. Now we can say that the minimum
detectable signal-to-noise ratio is k, which gives
</p>
<p>DEFr2i &frac14; kI
1=2
0 &frac14; kriD 1=2 (28:66)
</p>
<p>Therefore for a = 1mrad and t = 1 second, we can
express the signal-to-noise ratio as
</p>
<p>s0 &frac14; 443ri
F
</p>
<p>k
b1=2 (28:67)
</p>
<p>Now you can use some real numbers: take k= 2 (think
what this means for the minimum contrast), and assume
that b is 1010 A/m2 sr for a LaB6 gun and 10
</p>
<p>13 A/m2 sr
for a Schottky FEG.You can show that for ri=0.15nm
(a LaB6 gun) lnes0 is 1.2&ndash;2.2 whereas for a FEG,
ri=0.1 nm and lnes0 is 4.5&ndash;5.2. You can also appreciate
why s0 depends on your material: low atomic numbers
mean weak scattering. For our last two equations we&rsquo;ll
again quote de Jong and Van Dyck. We can deduce
optimum values for both the angle of convergence a
and the exposure t by differentiating the envelope
equations.

Image delocalization depends on u. It is large when
@w(u)/@u oscillates rapidly as it does for large u, i.e.,
where we are placing the information limit.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Notice that aopt depends not only on rs and ri, but also
on l (of course rs and ri also depend on l) and that topt
only depends on the drift rate; fortunately vd will never
be zero!
</p>
<p>We can now summarize these new concepts
</p>
<p>&amp; Microscopy is much more complex when you try to
use the information limit rather than the Scherzer
limit!
</p>
<p>&amp; If you want to use a computer, the size of the CCD
camera will also affect the actual information limit;
this is the effect of ED(u).
</p>
<p>&amp; Drift and vibrations must be minimized or they will
determine your resolution; these contributions were
described by Ed(u) and Ev(u).
</p>
<p>&amp; When everything else is perfect, your resolution will
be controlled by the signal-to-noise ratio of the
detector and the coherence functions, ED(u) and
Ec(u).
</p>
<p>&amp; An FEG improves the information limit because of
the large increase in the brightness, b. This increase
allows us to decrease a, increase the dose, and
increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
</p>
<p>This section has been quite long and not what you
traditionally find in a chapter on HRTEM. This is quite
deliberate. The TEM produces a great deal of informa-
tion but many researchers want numbers, quantities,
not data encoded in images. So we need to convert our
data into numbers; we have to be quantitative.
</p>
<p>28.14 SOME DIFFICULTIES IN USING
AN FEG
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve discussed the advantages of using an FEG for
HRTEM, but there are some practical difficulties which
have been analyzed by Otten and Coene at FEI. A cold
FEG (CFEG) allows us to extract a very high current
per unit area, but the total area of the emitting region is
very small so that the extraction current is &lt;5 nA. This
current can be increased if we thermally assist the field
emission by heating the Schottky emitter to	15008C. It
gives the same high brightness, but a larger maximum
current because of the larger emitting area. So what are
the difficulties?
</p>
<p>&amp; The emitter areamay be so small that we have to &lsquo;fan&rsquo;
the beam in order to illuminate the area used in TEM.
</p>
<p>This fanning may actually increase the effect of coma
aberration (a radial aberration as noted in Section
28.10). If a CFEG has a source size of	3nm, we can
study	15nmwith a 5&#13;magnification. The Schottky
source has a source diameter 	10&#13; greater, and the
price you pay for this is a decrease in spatial coher-
ence, and a larger energy spread.
</p>
<p>&amp; Correcting astigmatism is very tricky with an FEG.
As shown in Figure 28.11, if the image is astigmatic
you&rsquo;ll see that at all defocus settings with an LaB6
source. In an FEG, when astigmatism is present, all
the images look similar and you can&rsquo;t use the tech-
nique of finding the minimum-contrast defocus (at
	0.4 sch) to determine Df. If you try to use the
wobbler to do coma-free alignment, that fails too,
because you can&rsquo;t interpret the focus difference
between two FEG images for the two wobbler direc-
tions. There is a solution to finding Df, fortunately;
either use on-line processing (Chapter 31) or con-
verge the beam! The latter way deteriorates the spa-
tial coherence and you&rsquo;ve made your $2 M FEG
behave like an old $200 K LaB6 machine.
</p>
<p>&amp; Focal series of images are a challenge, because you
can now use a very large range of Df values, and it
becomes a major task just to determine your value of
Df.
</p>
<p>&amp; Image delocalization occurs when detail in the image
is displaced relative to its &lsquo;true&rsquo; location in the speci-
men. The effect is emphasized by the graph shown in
Figure 28.12 and becomes worse as you go away
from Scherzer defocus. The effect is illustrated in
Figure 28.13, where fringes from the gold particles
can appear outside the particle. If we rewrite equa-
tions 28.36, we can express the delocalization as
</p>
<p>DR &frac14; lu Df&thorn; Csl
2u2
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(28:70)
</p>
<p>You may notice a similarity between this equation and
that for the SAD error (Chapter 11): there is a good
reason for this similarity. Two values have been pro-
posed for Dfopt, the optimum defocus setting to mini-
mize delocalization. They give an optimum value for the
defocus of
</p>
<p>Dfopt &frac14; �MCsl2u2max (28:71)
</p>
<p>where M is a factor between 0.75 and 1. The value for
DRmin is then close to
</p>
<p>DRmin &frac14;
1
</p>
<p>4
Csl
</p>
<p>3u3max (28:72)
</p>
<p>The actual value ofM is determined bywhere you define
the cut-off value for u. There are three important con-
clusions on delocalization
</p>
<p>MORE DELOCALIZATION
To fully interpret an HRTEM image, you must
understand the implications of this concept. See the
papers by (i) Coene and Janssen and (ii) Lichte.

</p>
<p>28.15 SELECTIVELY IMAGING
SUBLATTICES
</p>
<p>In Chapter 16, where we discussed ordered intermetallic
alloys, we saw that many materials with a large-unit cell
are closely related to a material with a smaller unit cell.
If the two structures don&rsquo;t have the same symmetry,
then the two unit cells can show several different orien-
tation relationships, as was the case for vanadium
carbide.
</p>
<p>We can use this information to form different high-
resolution images instead of different DF images. Two
[001] DPs from an ordered alloy of Au4Mn are shown in
Figure 28.14, together with a schematic of one pattern.
Two domains are present in the combined pattern. Both
patterns have fourfold symmetry, but they are rotated
relative to one another. If we use the DF lattice-imaging
mode and exclude all the fcc reflections using the objec-
tive aperture, we form an image like that shown in
Figure 28.15. The two variants are not only easily recog-
nized, but we know where they are with an accuracy of
atomic dimensions. If you&rsquo;re used to grain-boundary
theory, the original cell has become the coincident-site
lattice (CSL) in reciprocal space and the two sublattices
are like grains related by a small S. This approach has
been used to estimate the size of very small particles of
NiFe2O4 spinel which are completely contained in a
matrix of NiO, as illustrated in Figure 28.16. The lattice

latter is generally above and below the particle. This
approach is therefore quite difficult, especially if, as in

important. Then you need to resort to simulation and

<p>28.16 INTERFACES AND SURFACES
</p>
<p>Interfaces of all kinds have been extensively studied
by HRTEM. Of course, we want the near-atomic
resolution. Sometimes it&rsquo;s because they make ideal sub-
jects for study! Point defects require extensive image
processing and simulation, dislocations tend to move,
but interfaces seem to remain stationary if you&rsquo;re
careful. However, we are always limited as to which
interfaces we can study.
</p>
<p>The fundamental requirement is that the interface
plane must be parallel to the electron beam.
</p>
<p>If a low-index plane in one grain (but preferably in
both grains) is parallel to the interface, you&rsquo;re in business.
The problem is that we are rarely sure that this is the case,
but because you are looking at a very thin specimen, the
projectedwidth of even a slightly tilted boundary is small.
</p>
<p>So you can tilt the specimen to look down a pole in one
grain or tomake the beamparallel to a low-index plane in
the second grain as shown in Figure 28.17.
</p>
<p>If you are lucky (and we often are because we only
study tilt boundaries by HRTEM), you can produce
crossed fringes in both grains. A selection of images is
shown in Figure 28.18. Here you can see structured
boundaries, boundaries with an amorphous layer
between the grains, interfaces between two different
materials, and a surface profile image. We can make
some general comments about these images
</p>
<p>&amp; Even a &lsquo;low&rsquo;-resolution, lattice-fringe image gives you
information on the local topology of your interface.
</p>
<p>&amp; If the layer of amorphousmaterial in the boundary is
quite thick (&gt;5 nm), you can see it directly.
</p>
<p>&amp; You can quite easily see detail like five-membered
rings in grain boundaries but you should be wary of
interpretation until you&rsquo;ve covered Chapter 30.
</p>
<p>&amp; You can see abrupt interfaces at near-atomic
dimensions.
</p>
<p>Now we can also list our concerns
</p>
<p>&amp; Has grooving at the interface affected the appear-
ance of the image? The answer is &lsquo;&lsquo;maybe, but does it
affect what you wanted to learn?&rsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&amp; Is the phase boundary as abrupt chemically as it is
structurally? It is very difficult to answer this. The
appearance of the image changes at the interface in
Figure 28.18C, mainly because the total number and
location of the cations (Fe3+ andNi2+) changes, not
because there is a 2:1 ratio of Fe:Ni.
</p>
<p>&amp; Are all of the black spots in Figure 28.18D complete
columns? The next question is &lsquo;&lsquo;Complete columns of
what?&rsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>We will address some of these problems in Chapter
30 but we can make some comments now.
</p>
<p>&amp; The quality of your imaging data will be governed by
how well you prepare your specimen. Nearly all
subsequent analysis will assume that it has a uniform

<p>thickness across the interface. If you do not know
that this is so, then your interpretation may and
should be questioned.
</p>
<p>&amp; Crystalline grains also thin at different rates if they
have different orientations or different structures or
different chemistries. The grain-boundary layer,
whether crystalline or amorphous, will also thin at
a different rate. Why? Because the bonding and
density are different. So careful specimen prepara-
tion is absolutely critical.
</p>
<p>&amp; You can learn a lot about your interface using
HRTEM without trying to use atomic-resolution
imaging.
</p>
<p>&amp; The longer you look at your specimen, the more it will
differ fromwhat you startedwith.Use at least a pseudo-
</p>
<p>low-dose approach, if possible. Figure 28.19 illustrates
an extreme example. Here, the oxide has been comple-
tely reduced to the metal at the edge of the foil. Of
course, this now provides a method for studying the
reduction of oxides under the electron beam in the
presence of hydrocarbons and in a good vacuum!
</p>
<p>28.17 INCOMMENSURATE STRUCTURES
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll illustrate this topic by considering several types of
incommensurate (modulated) structures. In each case,
the structure consists of a &lsquo;parent&rsquo; structure to which we
then add a periodic modulation by means of an internal
planar defect. Van Landuyt et al. have characterized
three different types of incommensurate structures.
</p>
<p>&amp; Periodic modules of the parent separated by inter-
faces. The interface may be a stacking fault (SF),
twin boundary (TB), anti-phase boundary (APB),
inversion domain boundary (IDB), crystallographic
shear (CS) plane, or discommensuration wall.

<p>28 .17 INCOMMENSURATE STRUCTURES ................................................................................................................................................ 503</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; A parent structure where the composition or site
occupancy changes periodically.
</p>
<p>The next complication is that we can find commen-
surate and incommensurate structures, and also struc-
tures where the modulation is variable. To understand
how a structure can be incommensurate, consider Figure
28.20, where we&rsquo;ve placed a planar defect after every
seventh layer so that it expands the lattice by d every
seventh plane. The parent lattice will show a spot spac-
ing in the DP proportional to d &ndash;1 but the &lsquo;superlattice&rsquo;
will have a periodicity of D&ndash;1, which means that we need
not have a simple relationship between the two arrays of
spots.
</p>
<p>These different kinds of modulation can be com-
bined! We&rsquo;ll illustrate this type of specimen with two
examples. The Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor provides
a good illustration of this type of structure. The parent is
a perovskite-like cube; we may have two, three, or four
layers of the perovskite with each group separated from
the next by a bismuth oxide layer. The formula can be
written as Bi2Sr2CanCun+1O2n+d so for n=1we have a
sequence of layers (planes) described as BiO-SrO-CuO2-
Ca-CuO2-SrO-BiO, as shown in Figure 28.21. The DPs
depend on the particular value of n in the chemical
formula and show rows of satellite reflections due to
themodulation of the basic structure.Whenwe form the
HRTEM image, the lattice planes appear wavy
although we can recognize an orthorhombic pattern.
The wavy modulation in the image is probably due to
excess oxygen in the BiO layers: the BiO layers don&rsquo;t fit
very well to the perovskite block but the misfit stresses
can be relaxed by introducing excess oxygen. There are
several clear lessons from this example
</p>
<p>&amp; HRTEM is essential if we are to understand such
structures.
</p>
<p>&amp; You need supplementary information, such as the
chemistry of the specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Images of this structure produced with the beam
along the orthogonal direction would be difficult to
explain.
</p>
<p>Modulated structures are not confined to the super-
conductors. In fact, such structures are ubiquitous in the
materials world. Many useful engineering alloys exhibit
spinodal decomposition and the spinodal wavelength
can be directly measured from the extra spots in the
DP. Many ceramics are described as polytypes, e.g.,
SiC or polytypoids, which are just polytypes with the
composition fluctuating from layer to layer (e.g., SiA-
lONs). These structures consist of random or locally
ordered stacking of specific atomic layers, which often
give predictable effects in the DP. All these materials are
particularly amenable to HRTEM analysis, because
you can imagine the individual modulations, and still
characterize the overall structure with conventional
amplitude contrast.
</p>
<p>28.18 QUASICRYSTALS
</p>
<p>The study of quasicrystals continues to be a challenge
for HRTEM, since these materials do not have the
translational symmetry that we associate with crystals.
However, they are strongly ordered, as you can
appreciate from Figure 28.22. The HRTEM image
shows many sharp white spots from a stable decagonal
quasicrystal of Al-Mn-Pd. The DP from another speci-
men also shows very strong, clear, well-defined spots.
In our earlier discussion of DPs, we associated each
spot with a single set of planes, which were present
throughout the specimen. Although the quasicrystals
do not contain such planes, there is clearly far more
order than in an amorphous material. You can indeed
see that the spots in the HRTEM image are aligned in
certain well-defined directions, but the spacing is diffi-
cult to identify. We have a growing understanding of
these materials and it appears that the spots in the
HRTEM image are this sharp because, at least in dec-
agonal quasicrystals (but not in icosahedral ones), they
really do correspond to columns; we don&rsquo;t need trans-
lational periodicity along the column. In fact we can
rotate the quasicrystal (they can be grown as large as
1mm) to reveal twofold and threefold axes, as illu-
strated in Figure 28.23. You can see how this might
arise by looking along the rows of spots in Figure
28.22. We can draw some interesting lessons from the
use of TEM to study quasicrystals
</p>
<p>&amp; HRTEM excels when materials are ordered on a
local scale.
</p>
<p>&amp; ForHRTEM, we need the atoms to align in columns
because this is a &lsquo;projection technique,&rsquo; but the dis-
tribution along the column is not so critical, and we

<p>can&rsquo;t determine it without tilting to another projec-
tion in the perfect crystal.
</p>
<p>&amp; SAD and HRTEM should be used in a complemen-
tary fashion.
</p>
<p>28.19 SINGLE ATOMS
</p>
<p>You have read that it has become possible to study
materials at atomic resolution in the TEM quite
recently. So you may be surprised to find that many
groups have been reporting studies of individual atoms
since about 1970! The techniques used include phase
contrast and amplitude contrast in a conventional
TEM, and (see Section 22.4) a dedicated STEM. Par-
sons et al. used mellitic acid molecules stained with
uranyl ions from uranyl acetate so the atoms that were
imaged are heavy. Parsons et al. then knew that the
uranium atoms would be 1 nm apart at each apex of
an equilateral triangle and they knew that there were
1013 of these per cm2 supported on a thin (0.8 nm) film of
evaporated carbon. One challenge is recognizing that
the contrast from the individual uranium atoms reverses
as you change defocus, just as we&rsquo;ve seen for columns of

<p>atoms (and voids). You can see this effect in Figure
28.24A and B; for comparison, a series of Z-contrast
STEM images is shown in Figure 28.24C&ndash;E. In this case
the contrast is much higher and the movement of the
cluster is clear.
</p>
<p>Some points to notice
</p>
<p>&amp; This is a case where we really do have &lsquo;white atoms
or black atoms!&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&amp; Parsons et al. used a Siemens 101 TEM operating at
100 kV with a point-to-point resolution of about
0.33 nm; this is not today&rsquo;s state-of-the-art machine!
</p>
<p>&amp; The specimen in the TEM study was so stable that
they could do &lsquo;through-focus&rsquo; imaging.
</p>
<p>Z-contrast imaging heralded the arrival of the
STEM as a real research tool: atoms are now seen to
move on the surface, agglomerate, etc. The imaging
mode is essentially a high-angle dark-field technique so
that the heavy atoms are by far the strongest scatterers
and appear bright, as we discussed in Chapter 22. The
difficulty withZ-contrast imaging in the STEM is that it
requires an FEG, whereas almost any TEM operating
today can produce images like those first demonstrated
by Parsons et al.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The major problem that separates this chapter from Chapter 23 is the language. In
HRTEM, the language is that of physics or electrical engineering; you can get so involved
with the language and the equations that you miss the point. Having said that, you must
know the following terms and understand what they mean or don&rsquo;t mean
</p>
<p>&amp; Point-spread function.
&amp; Contrast transfer function (CTF) (and transfer function).
&amp; Weak-phase object approximation (WPOA).
</p>
<p>With this understanding of the restrictions that our model involves, we can now consider
the simulation of high-resolution images. If you want to delve further into the theory, we

<p>recommend starting with the companion text, then going to the books by Cowley and
Spence. You will need to have a strong background in math and physics to appreciate fully
the further subtleties of more complex models. Always keep in mind that all of the above
discussion was concerned with arriving at models or approximations
</p>
<p>&amp; We model the effect of the lens.
&amp; Then we model the specimen.
&amp; Finally, we combine the two models.
</p>
<p>We will take the next two chapters to achieve these three tasks. Although by 2008 	25
TEMs with Cs correctors had been installed, we leave the discussion of this exciting topic to
the companion text since it is certainly not an instrument for someone learning TEM.

<p>REFERENCES
One of the pioneers in the interpretation of HRTEM images was the late John Cowley. Much of our
</p>
<p>analysis of the specimen transfer function, f(x,y), follows directly from his teaching. When pronouncing
</p>
<p>names, don&rsquo;t confuse Lord Rayleigh (born John William Strutt) with Walter Raleigh. Otto Scherzer was
</p>
<p>professor in Darmstadt and actually built an aberration corrector for his TEM. He was succeeded at
</p>
<p>Darmstadt by Harald Rose who with his former student, Max Haidar, made aberration correction work
</p>
<p>for the rest of us. Ondrej Krivanek and Nicolas Delby did the same for STEMs. Articles by Shannon and
</p>
<p>Weaver 1964, Van Dyck 1992 on information theory will start you on this topic; for HRTEM, you must
</p>
<p>then have access to John Spence&rsquo;s book.

<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Muchofwhatwe&rsquo;ve discussed in the preceding imaging chapters iswhatwemight call &lsquo;classical&rsquo;
TEM imaging. It began with BF and DF techniques and quickly expanded to include many
beams. Diffraction contrast, phase contrast, and to a lesser extent, mass-thickness contrast are
the mechanisms we use to characterize our specimens.We control the contrast by inserting the
objective aperture, or a STEM detector, and excluding or collecting electrons that have been
scattered by the different processes. However, there are variations to the standard ways in
whichwe can extractmore information fromaTEM image; in this chapter, we&rsquo;ll present a brief
overview of some of them. Most of these operational modes that we&rsquo;ll discuss here are some-
what esoteric and have rather specialized applications. Nevertheless, you should know that
they exist because theymay be just what you need to solve your particular problem. There&rsquo;s no
importance to the order in which we go through the various modes, but we&rsquo;ll cover modifica-
tions to conventional parallel-beam TEM imaging as well as those techniques that require
STEMand use some of the electron detectors we discussed in Chapter 7. It turns out, however,
that the various procedures are often feasible in either TEM or STEMmode.
</p>
<p>This is a bit of a potpourri of a chapter but the techniques are not, to our knowledge,
gathered together in any other text. The descriptions will, of necessity, be brief but we&rsquo;ll
reference suitable source material so you can follow up if you really want to try the
technique for yourself.
</p>
<p>29.1 STEREO MICROSCOPY
AND TOMOGRAPHY
</p>
<p>This section is an excellent example of why we&rsquo;ve
included this catch-all chapter. In the first edition of
this textbook, stereo microscopy was an old technique
only used by biologists and tomography was used in an
MRI. Now tomography fills an entire chapter in the
companion text. The principle is, of course, the same
as stereo microscopy: record images from more than
one direction to give a 3D view of the sample.
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve have realized by now that any TEM or
STEM image is a two-dimensional projection of a 3D
specimen and this is a fundamental limitation. Some-
times we can discern differences in diffraction-contrast
images of certain defects, depending on whether the
defect is intersecting the top or the bottom of the foil,
but generally we lose the depth dimension. To regain
this depth information we use stereo microscopy, but
only for features showing mass-thickness or diffraction
contrast. We cannot use stereo for phase-contrast
imaging because the essential experimental step, tilting
the specimen, changes the phase contrast and the
</p>
<p>projected potential of the specimen. So any stereo
effect in the image is lost. You may need stereo micro-
scopy if, for example, you want to know whether pre-
cipitates have formed on your specimen surface rather
than in the interior, or if you want to see how disloca-
tions are interacting with each other.
</p>
<p>Stereo imaging works because your brain gauges
depth by simultaneously interpreting signals from
both your eyes, which view the same scene from
slightly different angles (about 58), giving a parallax
shift. So in the TEM, if you take two pictures of the
same area but tilted a few degrees relative to each
other, then present the two images simultaneously to
your brain using a stereo viewer, you&rsquo;ll see a single
image in which the different depths of the features are
apparent. In fact, some people are able to see the
stereo effect without the aid of a viewer and some
people are incapable of discerning the stereo effect
at all.
</p>
<p>To see in stereo, the two images should be separated
by �60mm, but in practice it&rsquo;s often sufficient just to
move the pictures relative to each other until your eye
and brain seize on the effect.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A couple of points are worth noting before we
describe the method. First, if the features you want to
observe show diffraction contrast, then the only way to
maintain contrast is to tilt along a Kikuchi band, keep-
ing both g and s fixed; so tilt while looking at the DP.
This procedure almost invariably requires a double-tilt
stage and may be difficult, or impossible, if your speci-
men is heavily deformed. If you just want to measure
the foil thickness, any tilt is sufficient and contrast does
not have to be maintained. Second, if you want to be
pedantic, there is a right way and a wrong way to view
the stereo images. You have to present the images in
the same way that your eyes would see a scene, that is,
the two images have to be correctly positioned, other-
wise the brain will interpret depth the wrong way
round. If you are trying to perceive the true surface
topography (such as with SE images) using SEM or
STEM images, then the choice of which image goes
into the left eye and which into the right is crucial.
(See any SEM text, such as that by Goldstein et al.,
for more details on stereo viewing.) Of course, for
TEM images this difference is irrelevant. TEM appli-
cations are reviewed by Hudson and a whole set of
related papers appears in that same issue of Journal of
Microscopy.
</p>
<p>So if you want to take a stereo pair, follow these
steps
</p>
<p>&amp; Select the region of interest, making sure that the
specimen is eucentric.
</p>
<p>&amp; Record an image (BF, DF, or WBDF, it doesn&rsquo;t
matter, although usually the BF image is used).
</p>
<p>&amp; Tilt the specimen by at least 58 (much higher tilts
give a larger parallax shift but it&rsquo;s more difficult
to keep the focus and the diffraction contrast
constant).
</p>
<p>&amp; Ensure that the whole field of view didn&rsquo;t move
while you tilted. If it did, translate it back to its
original position (using the beam stop as a point
of reference if you wish). All features in the image
will be shifted slightly relative to each other: it is
this parallax shift which your brain interprets in
stereo.
</p>
<p>&amp; If the area is now out of focus (it will be if you had to
use the second, non-eucentric, tilt axis), refocus using
</p>
<p>the specimen-height (z) control; otherwise you&rsquo;ll
change your image magnification. Obviously, com-
puterized stages will help in this respect.
</p>
<p>&amp; Record another image.
&amp; Develop or display the images and observe them
under a stereo viewer.
</p>
<p>Figure 29.1 shows a pair of BF images showing
precipitates. If the images are correctly spaced and
you look through a stereo viewer then you should be
able to see the relative depth of the precipitates. You
can purchase cheap cardboard stereo viewers through
any EM supplier. Although a proper stereo viewer is
an expensive optical tool, you can use it to calculate
the relative depth (Dh) of a feature in a stereo pair,
since
</p>
<p>Dh &frac14; Dp
2M sin
</p>
<p>f
2
</p>
<p>(29:1)
</p>
<p>where Dp is the parallax shift between the same feature
in the two images tilted by f at a magnification M. Be
careful how you define f because some microscopists
define the tilt angle as�f, in which case sinf/2 becomes
sinf. For true depth determination you need to deposit
some recognizable feature on the surface, such as gold
islands, but that is not usually important in TEM
images and relative depth is often sufficient. If you
need quantitative stereo measurements, you can either
learn about the field of stereology, which is an old
established discipline or you can learn the tomography
technique.
</p>
<p>We will discuss electron tomography in the compan-
ion text. This is a very large topic and an emerging
activity in TEM. It has been limited until recently by
the need for fast computers and large amounts of
memory, and specimen holders that allow you to tilt
the specimen through nearly the full 3608. Obviously,
disk specimens are not ideal for such tilting experi-
ments. The principle involved is just as we&rsquo;ve described
for stereo, but we use about 100 times as many images
and a computer is essential to analyze and view the
results.
</p>

D MICROSCOPY
</p>
<p>This is an example of imaginative terminology in the
TEM field. If there are diffraction spots in the SADP
which are too close together to give separate DF images,
center the objective aperture around them all. Then,
if you view two DF images taken at different focus set-
tings through a stereo viewer, you see features at different
apparent depths. However, you&rsquo;re using a pseudo-stereo
techniquebecause the &lsquo;depth&rsquo; difference is due to adifference
</p>
<p>STEREO RULES
You have to make sure that the field of view, the
contrast, and the magnification in each of the two
images are the same.

<p>in g, not a truedepthdifference at all: hence the term2 1
2
Dor
</p>
<p>&lsquo;not quite 3D.&rsquo; The technique is also known by the rather
more staid name of &lsquo;through-focus DF.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Bell developed a simple theory explaining how a
change in focus Df introduces a parallax shift in the
image, y.
</p>
<p>y &frac14; MDf lg (29:2)
</p>
<p>Dy12 &frac14; Df lg12 (29:3)
</p>
<p>whereM is themagnification, l is the electronwavelength,
and g is the diffraction vector. So, as you change focus, the
parts of the image coming from different diffracted beams
shift relative to each other by an amount,MDy12.
</p>
<p>The term g12 (&frac14; g1 &ndash; g2) is the vector between the
spots arising from features 1 and 2. It is this parallax
shift which introduces a stereo effect in the samemanner
as one introduced through tilting.
</p>
<p>When would you need to use such a technique?Well,
if you&rsquo;re dealing with a multiphase specimen in which
many of the phases have similar structures and/or lattice
parameters, then there would be many closely spaced
diffraction spots. In these circumstances, if you succeed
in separating the spots with a small objective aperture,
</p>
<p>the selected spot will undoubtedly be very close to the
aperture and the image will display serious aberrations.
It&rsquo;s more likely you will be unable to select only one spot
in the aperture.
</p>
<p>You must start by setting up a CDF imaging config-
uration, but one in which several diffractionmaxima are
contained within the objective aperture. In the normal
CDF image, therefore, all the parts of the specimen
diffracting into the several spots will appear bright.
However, if you take two images at different defocus
conditions, the features diffracting into different spots
will shift by slightly different amounts given by equation
29.3. This relative shift between the two images is per-
ceived by your brain as a relative depth difference when
you view the images simultaneously through a stereo
viewer. You might argue that your images are going to
be out of focus, and strictly speaking you&rsquo;re right, but
remember that in the TEM there&rsquo;s a large depth of field
(see Section 6.7) and it&rsquo;s easy to keep both images rea-
sonably in focus over quite a range of objective lens
excitation, so long as the magnification isn&rsquo;t too high.
The greater the change in the objective lens current, the
better the ability to resolve similarly diffracting features,
so this process works better at lower magnifications
where the depth of field is greater.
</p>

<p>You can see the small parallax shift between the two images. Note also the mixture of mass-thickness and diffraction contrast.

<p>So the experimental steps are as follows
</p>
<p>&amp; Select the area of interest making sure the specimen
is eucentric.
</p>
<p>&amp; Tilt the beam so that the several diffraction spots
cluster around the optic axis; center the objective
aperture around this group of spots.
</p>
<p>&amp; Return to image mode and underfocus the objective
lens until you see the clarity of the image begin to
degrade; then overfocus one click back to maintain
focus.
</p>
<p>&amp; Record an image.
&amp; Overfocus the objective lens until the image begins to
lose clarity again, then underfocus back one click.
</p>
<p>&amp; Record another image.
&amp; Develop or display the images and view them in a
stereo viewer.
</p>
<p>Figure 29.2 shows a pair of CDF images taken under
these conditions. The DP, as you can see, has many
closely spaced spots. This example and many more are
given in a well-illustrated review by Sinclair et al. If you
look at the images through a stereo viewer, different
bright regions will appear at different &lsquo;heights.&rsquo; If you
read the review, you&rsquo;ll find that it is quite easy to deter-
mine which features in the image are responsible for
which diffraction spot.
</p>
<p>29.3 MAGNETIC SPECIMENS
</p>
<p>If you happen to be looking at a magnetic material, then
this can cause major problems for both you and the
TEM and you might want to switch to studying alumi-
num. However, if you&rsquo;re patient and want a challenging
task, then you can learn to correct for the magnetic
disturbance introduced by the specimen. You can also
get more information by making use of the interaction
</p>
<p>of the electron beamwith the magnetic field of the speci-
men. The use of TEM to study magnetic effects has seen
a resurgence since the discovery of high-Tc supercon-
ductors, and the interest in magnetic recording media
capable of storing a high density of information.
</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll look at how to get the best images from
yourmagnetic specimen and then we&rsquo;ll describe a couple
of specialized imaging techniques that allow you to see
either the domains or the domain walls, which are rele-
vant to both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials.
This topic will be extended in the companion text.
</p>
<p>29.3.A The Magnetic Correction
</p>
<p>If your specimen is magnetic, its magnetic field will
deviate the electron beam as it passes through and
then the electrons that you use to form images will not
be on the optic axis. All your images will be severely
aberrated and shift when you try to focus them. You can
minimize these effects as we&rsquo;ll now describe.
</p>
<p>The most important step is to make the magnetic
part of your specimen as thin and small as possible to
reduce its total magnetic field strength.
</p>
<p>However, small flake specimens are more easily
pulled out from between support grids when you put
the specimen into the objective lens. So, make sure your
foil is well clamped into the specimen holder and use
oyster grids for thin flakes with conducting glue if pos-
sible. Insert the holder into the lens with the objective
lens strength as low as possible; look at the current
running through the lens and minimize it. Ideally, you
will use a TEM that has been optimized for the task.

<p>MAGNETIC DISKS
You should not use self-supporting magnetic disk
specimens if you can avoid doing so.
</p>
<p>514 .................................................................................................................................................................. OTHER IMAGING TECHNIQUES</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Such a TEM may, for example, have a modified objec-
tive lens. Notice that none of the images shown in this
section are HRTEM.
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find it very difficult to set a magnetic speci-
men to the eucentric height because, as you tilt it
through the 08 position, the specimen tends to rotate,
or it is pulled out of the holder (if you&rsquo;re unlucky) or it
shifts slightly in height and position. If you lose the
specimen, the column must be split and the lost speci-
men retrieved, otherwise you may introduce a fixed,
non-correctible, astigmatism into the microscope. In
the extreme, youmay end up with your specimen welded
to the polepiece, which gets to be quite expensive. It is
better to incur the wrath of your technical support staff
when the objective polepiece is still undamaged.
</p>
<p>So when you have found a general area of interest,
set up the eucentric height by tilting the specimen, tak-
ing care not to tilt through 08; keep the tilt range to one
side of zero. When the eucentricity is reasonable (and it
rarely gets perfect for magnetic materials), focus and
center a recognizable feature on the screen, remove the
objective diaphragm, then carry out the following steps
</p>
<p>&amp; Underfocus C2 and the objective lens by one coarse
step. The feature should move off center. If you lose
illumination you haven&rsquo;t underfocused C2 enough.
</p>
<p>&amp; Return the feature to the screen center using the DF
beam tilt potentiometers. This brings the imaging
beam onto the optic axis.
</p>
<p>&amp; Refocus the image, recondense the beam, and if the
feature shifts, recenter it with the stage translators.
</p>
<p>&amp; Repeat the procedure for objective lens overfocus,
until the feature stays centered as the objective lens is
moved through focus
</p>
<p>If you then go to the DP, you&rsquo;ll see that the 000
beam should now be on axis and you can put the
objective diaphragm back in again and check the
astigmatism. However (and here&rsquo;s the catch), if you
tilt or traverse the specimen, then you will have to re-
do the whole correction since the magnetic field will
change as you move the specimen relative to the beam.
You&rsquo;ll rapidly get accomplished at this procedure if
you practice for a while. Now, if you want to do CDF
imaging at the same time as doing the magnetic cor-
rection, then you need an extra set of external DF
controls, which may be an option or may be built
into your microscope. Then you center the image
</p>
<p>feature with one set of potentiometers and tilt in the
required hkl maximum with the other set. Figure 29.3
shows the image of a magnetic specimen before and
after the magnetic correction. It is more difficult to
image magnetic specimens in STEM mode, because
the scanning beam may interact differently with dif-
ferent areas of the specimen and so the image quality
will be variable.
</p>
<p>29.3.B Lorentz Microscopy
</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve corrected for the magnetic field intro-
duced by the specimen, you can image the magnetic
domains if they&rsquo;re on the right scale to see in the micro-
scope. This is a form of phase-contrast microscopy
which we saw back in Chapter 23. The general term
for this kind of imaging is called Lorentz microscopy
and it comes with two options, and a special lens.

</p>
<p>MAGNETIC MATERIAL
If you lose any specimen, or part of a specimen, in the
TEM it is essential that you stop work and get help; if
the specimen is magnetic this is doubly essential&mdash;
and you can be identified if you don&rsquo;t get help!

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Foucault Images: If there are several domains in the
illuminated area, the electron beam will be deviated in
different ways by different domains. This will result in a
splitting of the diffraction spot, as shown in Figure
29.4A. It is useful to know immediately that the
</p>
<p>direction of magnetization is normal to the direction
of spot splitting (the effect of the Lorentz force). You
can then take a BF image using either of the split 000
reflections. If you use all the spots, you can just see the
domain walls (Figure 29.4B). The domains bending
electrons into the chosen spot will then appear bright
and the other domains will appear darker, as in Figure
29.4C. These images of the like domains are called
Foucault images (perhaps after the French inventor of
the pendulum used to demonstrate the earth&rsquo;s rotation)
for reasons unknown to the authors. It is possible to see
an analogous effect in STEM images if you use a detec-
tor that is cut into electrically isolated segments so
different portions (usually halves or quadrants) pick
up electrons coming through different domains. In
STEM you can also add, subtract, or divide the various
signals, as shown in Figure 29.5, because you are picking
up each signal digitally. However, the intensity in Fou-
cault images cannot be related quantitatively to the
magnetic induction, so their only use is to give a rapid
estimate of the domain size.
</p>
<p>Fresnel Images: This option allows you to see the
domain walls rather than the domains. As we discussed
in Chapter 23, Fresnel imaging is named for another
famous Frenchman whose TEM images would never be
in focus. If you over- or underfocus the objective lens,
then the electrons coming through different domains will
produce images in which the walls appear as bright or

The objective lens produces a magnetic field around
the sample. A Lorentz lens replaces the objective lens:
it gives a lower magnification and is farther from the
sample.

<p>dark lines, which reverse contrast as you go through
focus, as in Figure 29.6. The contrast depends onwhether
the electrons going through the domains on either side of
the wall were deflected toward or away from each other,
as shown schematically in Figure 23.16A. From such
images you can work out whether you&rsquo;re looking at
Bloch walls, Néel walls, or cross-tie walls. Figure 29.7
explains why this technique is so important.
</p>
<p>In an FEG TEM, the highly coherent source means
that coherent Fresnel and Foucault (CF) imaging is
possible. These techniques give quantitative measure-
ments of the magnetic induction.
</p>
<p>If you want to do Lorentz microscopy, you have to
decrease the field strength of your objective lens, which
will otherwise dominate the internal field and thus con-
trol the domain size in the specimen. So, you either switch
off the objective lens and use the intermediate lens for
focusing, or use a specially designed low-field lens. TEM
manufacturers offer appropriate objective lenses for Lor-
entz microscopy and it can also be done in STEM.
</p>
<p>In addition to imaging the domains and the walls,
you can also image the flux lines in the specimen if you
evaporate Fe on the surface, just as you use Fe filings to
delineate flux lines around a bar magnet. If you heat the
specimen in situ, then the spot splitting decreases line-
arly to become zero at the Curie temperature.
</p>
<p>29.4 CHEMICALLY SENSITIVE IMAGES
</p>
<p>In Section 16.7, we showed that in many materials the
structure factor, F, for some reflections was sensitive to
the difference between the atomic-scattering amplitudes
</p>
<p>of the constituents. If we form a DF image using such a
reflection, it will, in principle, be sensitive to changes in
the composition of the material. The material systems
which have been studied most extensively are related to
GaAs and the other III&ndash;V compound semiconductors.
There is great interest in partially replacing either the
group III element or the group V element locally to
produce superlattices and quantum wells, as illustrated
in Figure 29.8. The contrast in the DF images will be
brighter in thin specimens when the difference in the two
atomic-scattering amplitudes is large. Therefore, layers
of AlxGa1-xAs appear brighter than the surrounding
GaAs matrix.
</p>
<p>This imaging technique can, in principle, be applied
to many different materials; it is the same, in principle,
as the use of superlattice reflections to image ordered
regions (see Figures 16.5 and 16.6). We will use the same
information when discussing quantitative chemical lat-
tice imaging in Section 31.11; we also use this effect
when studying site location by ALCHEMI (see Section
35.9). In practice, it is often important to know how
abruptly the composition changes, since this interface
affects the properties of the material, so you may be
interested in the change in contrast which occurs exactly
at the interface. However, you should keep in mind our
discussion (Section 24.10) of surface relaxations in the
thin specimen which can influence any diffraction-con-
trast images.
</p>
<p>29.5 IMAGING WITH DIFFUSELY
SCATTERED ELECTRONS
</p>
<p>This is just a variation on the theme of normal DF
imaging. If your specimen contains non-crystalline
regions which scatter electrons into a different region
of reciprocal space away from the diffracted beams,
then the non-crystalline regions can be seen in strong
contrast. To do this, you perform a DF operation with
the objective aperture away from any strong diffraction
spots but at a position to intercept a fraction of the
diffuse scatter. For example, in silicate glasses the dif-
fuse scatter peaks radially at 3&ndash;4 nm�1. As shown in
Figure 29.9, a DF image reveals the amorphous regions
with high contrast at grain boundary in a ceramic
bicrystal. However, you must be very careful when
interpreting such images, as shown by Kouh et al.
</p>
<p>Diffuse scatter can also arise from short-range
ordering in the specimen due either to microdomains
of ordered nuclei or local regions of increased order
analogous to spinoidal decomposition. These regions
produce diffuse intensity maxima at positions that will
eventually correspond to a superlattice spot when the

trast effects, but in the DPs, of short-range ordered
materials in Figure 17.11.
</p>
<p>The practical suggestion in either of these cases for a
modern TEM is to use a displaced aperture approach
rather than translating the beam.
</p>
<p>29.6 SURFACE IMAGING
</p>
<p>We can obtain surface information in the TEM in a
variety of ways. We can do reflection electron micro-
scopy (REM), or use a technique called &lsquo;topographic
contrast.&rsquo; We can also form an SE image in an SEM or
STEM, as we describe later in the chapter. We&rsquo;ve already
mentioned profile imaging by HRTEM in Section 28.16.
</p>
<p>29.6.A Reflection Electron Microscopy
</p>
<p>Reflection electron microscopy (REM) of surfaces
requires that you mount your specimen in the holder
</p>
<p>so the beam hits at a glancing angle, as shown in Figure
29.10A. Since the electrons are scattered from the sur-
face, your specimen doesn&rsquo;t need to be thinned. The
image is foreshortened by an amount which depends
on the reflection used. Different parts of the specimen
will be focused at different positions behind the lens.
Once you have chosen an image plane, you canmove the
specimen in the z-direction to focus different regions of
the surface. A reflection high-energy electron diffraction
(RHEED) pattern is generated by the surface layers of
the specimen, as shown in Figure 29.10B. This diffrac-
tion geometry is exactly that which we used to derive
Bragg&rsquo;s law.
</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve formed the DP, the experimental proce-
dure is essentially the same as for conventional diffrac-
tion-contrast DF imaging. You insert an objective
aperture to select a Bragg-reflected beam and form an
REM image, as in Figure 29.10C and D. The images are
strongly foreshortened in the beam direction but main-
tain the usual TEM image resolution in the plane nor-
mal to the beam where the image is in focus. This can
make interpretation difficult; you&rsquo;ll see two different
magnificationmarkers in the two orthogonal directions.
Note how different the two rotated images appear.
</p>
<p>Ideally, you would like to have a very clean surface to
simplify interpretation of the contrast. Of course, if the
surface is not very flat, or is covered with a thick con-
tamination or oxide layer, youwon&rsquo;t learnmuch from the
image. However, with care, you can use REM to study
the surface of many different materials. All that you&rsquo;ve
learned about diffraction-contrast images will apply to
REM images. For example, you can also detect chemi-
cally sensitive contrast, as shown in Figure 29.10E. Here
the dark bands are layers of AlxGa1&ndash;xAs in a GaAs
matrix; the contrast is sensitive to the actual value of x.
Notice that this contrast is the reverse of what we saw in
TEM using chemically sensitive reflections.
</p>
<p>Since you can do REM using any regular TEM
holder, you can, in principle, easily heat or cool your
bulk sample. In many ways, this is easier than using a
transmission specimen since the sample is much more
robust. In situ REM studies of Si provided a leap in our
understanding of the reconstruction of Si surfaces. Yagi
et al. showed the surface reconstruction taking place in
situ. This technique has many potential applications but
requires practice.

<p>29.6.B Topographic Contrast
</p>
<p>You can get a sense for the topography of your specimen
by a neat technique which simply involves displacing the
objective aperture until its shadow is visible across the
region of the image that you&rsquo;re looking at. Around this
area of the specimen you will see contrast which arises
from an electron refraction effect but can be simply inter-
preted in terms of thickness changes in the specimen. In
Figure 29.11, you can easily see that theFe3O4particles are
supported on top of the carbon film and you can also see
that the carbon film is not flat. Although the displacement
of the aperture introduces astigmatism into the image, it
does not limit resolution at the relatively low magnifica-
tion at which this image was taken. To carry out an
equivalent operation in STEM, you just displace the BF
detector or shift the 000 diffraction disk so it falls half on
and half off the detector. Again, the technique is not
widely used, partly because refraction is a difficult topic
in TEMand partly because the images don&rsquo;t look so &lsquo;nice.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>29.7 HIGH-ORDER BF IMAGING
</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve taken some pains to point out, you get the
strongest diffraction contrast in your images when s is
small and positive. Under these circumstances, it&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>easiest to see crystal defects and interpret their contrast.
This strong dynamical contrast can mask the details of
the defect and sometimes it is more important to lower
the contrast. You can do this by operating under kine-
matical conditions. Rather than having one strong low-
index spot in the DP, if you tilt to make a high-order
spot bright then the overall contrast is less and the back-
ground is not dominated by bend contours or thickness
fringes, and the effects are shown in Figure 29.12. You
can get a similar effect called &lsquo;kinematical diffraction
imaging&rsquo; if you form a BF image when no hkl spot is
strong.
</p>
<p>We get a similar effect in STEM imaging because, as
we saw back in Section 22.6, dynamical-contrast effects
are reduced when the reciprocity conditions between
TEM and STEM are not fulfilled and all STEM images
are more kinematical in nature.
</p>
<p>Notice that Figure 29.12 was recorded at 650 kV.
This tells you that high-order BF imaging can be a very
useful technique when you&rsquo;re using an IVEM. You&rsquo;ll
see there are subtle contrast effects that can occur at
higher voltages. For example, in addition to improving
the spatial localization of defect images, there are times
when the 2g reflection gives better contrast.
</p>
<p>Many of the early texts assume that you will be
working at 100 kV, but only because that was all that
was routinely available when they were written. The
world is now different.

<p>29.8 SECONDARY-ELECTRON IMAGING
</p>
<p>SE images reveal the surface topography, which isn&rsquo;t
much if you&rsquo;ve polished your sample well, but is very
important if you&rsquo;re looking at particulate specimens
such as catalysts. You have to use a STEM if you&rsquo;re
going to form SE images. If you look back to Figure 7.2,
you&rsquo;ll see how the SE signal is detected by a scintillator-
PM detector situated in the upper objective polepiece of
a STEM. SEs generated in the top few nanometers of the
specimen surface are confined by the strong magnetic
field of the upper polepiece and spiral upward until they
see the high voltage (�10 kV) on the aluminized surface
of the scintillator. This design differs from the conven-
tional SEM, in which the SE detector is situated under
the final polepiece. In the STEM we get SE images of
superior resolution and quality, which is why this design
has been adopted for HRSEM. There are several rea-
sons for this improvement in resolution
</p>
<p>&amp; A conventional SE image in an SEM invariably has
noise contributions from BSEs which can enter the
scintillator directly. In the STEM there is no line of
sight to the SE detector for the BSE, and so the SE
signal in STEM lacks the BSE noise that exists in an
SEM image.
</p>
<p>&amp; The brightness of a thermionic source in a STEM is
higher than in an SEM, because of the higher kV,
and so the SE signal will be correspondingly stron-
ger. An FEG will be brighter still.
</p>
<p>&amp; The Cs of STEM objective lenses is usually a lot
smaller than for conventional SEMs. Therefore, SE
images in a STEM are invariably of better quality
than in an SEM because these two factors increase
the S/N ratio.
</p>
<p>The fourth advantage depends on a knowledge of
the different types of SE which we&rsquo;ll now discuss.
</p>
<p>The presence of remote SE signals in an SEM also
decreases the S/N ratio. As shown in Figure 29.13, the
SE detector in an SEM can pick up four different types
of secondary electrons labeled SE I &ndash;SE IV generated by
the primary electron (PE) beam
</p>
<p>&amp; The SE I signal is the only signal we want, since it
emanates from the region around the probe and
contains high-resolution topographic information
from that region only.
</p>
<p>&amp; The SE II signal comprises SEs generated by BSEs
that emerge from the specimen some distance away
from the beam. The only way to reduce SE II is to
reduce the BSE fraction and we can do this by using
thin specimens, as in STEM.
</p>
<p>&amp; The SE III component arises from parts of the
microscope stage that are struck by BSE from the
specimen. So, reducing the BSE fraction by using
thin specimens also reduces SE III.
</p>
<p>&amp; The SE IV signal comes from SEs generated at the
edges of the final probe-forming aperture, which in an
SEM, often sits in the final lens. In a STEM, however,
the C2 aperture performs this function and it is well
away from the stage and the SE detector.
</p>
<p>So, in a STEM with a thin specimen, the ratio of
desirable SE I to undesirable SE II&ndash;IV is higher than in
a conventional SEM. If you look at a bulk sample in the
STEM, then the SE II signal will be the same as in an
SEMsince theBSEyield does not varywith beam energy.
Furthermore, the SE III signalmay be slightlyworse than
in an SEM because of the smaller STEM stage. Experi-
mentally, the net result of all these differences is that the
STEM still provides higher-resolution SE images of the
same bulk sample than a conventional SEM, as shown in
Figure 29.14. Now, the highest resolution FEG SEMs
incorporate many of the design aspects of the STEM
stage and can produce SE image resolutions &lt;1nm at
30kV; some SEMs even encourage you to use thin speci-
men and give a simple STEM image.
</p>
<p>A thermionic source STEM cannot better that SEM
resolution; however, an FEG STEMat 100 kV or higher
should, in theory, offer the best possible SE images and
may even show atomic-level topographic information,
especially with an aberration-corrected probe.
</p>
<p>Despite these obvious advantages and the ready
availability of STEMs with SE detectors, very few
high-resolution studies of the surface topography of
specimens have been carried out with a STEM. It
appears that one of the major uses of the SE image is
simply to find the hole in the TEM disk! Why this is so
remains unclear, but we strongly encourage you to use
</p>
<p>FIGURE 29.13. The four possible sources of SEs that enter the detector
</p>
<p>in a conventional SEM. The SE I signal is the only desirable one since it
</p>
<p>comes from the probe region, but SE II from BSE electrons, SE III from
</p>
<p>the stage of the microscope, and SE IV from the final aperture all combine
</p>
<p>to reduce the S/N ratio in an SE image. In a STEM, the relative contribu-
</p>
<p>tions are different.

<p>SE images if they are available in your STEM.
Of course, your specimen surface must be prepared
carefully and kept clean, otherwise you&rsquo;ll image contam-
ination, oxide, or some other artifact of your prepara-
tion process. If you have to coat your specimen because
it&rsquo;s an insulator, then you should use a modern high-
resolution, high-vacuum coater to generate a continu-
ous thin film of a refractory metal such as Cr. Don&rsquo;t use
the more conventional Au-Pd coatings, which merely
mask the fine detail of the specimen surface.
</p>
<p>29.9 BACKSCATTERED-ELECTRON
IMAGING
</p>
<p>Remember that the BSE detector in a STEM is situated
directly under the upper objective polepiece. In an SEM,
the detector is in the same position and we get equal
collection efficiency. Higher kV gives a brighter source,
but specimen thickness dominates the yield and it is
abysmal in thin specimens (0.4% in 100 nm of Au).
(Look at Figures 2.4, 36.1, and 36.2 and check the
number of BSE in the Monte-Carlo simulations.) So
there is a very low total signal and the S/N is poor.
Nevertheless, in a thin specimen we can still form BSE
images in the STEM that show resolution approaching
the probe size, but only if a high-contrast specimen is
used, e.g., Au islands on a C film, as shown in Figure
29.15. So in general, the BSE signal in a STEMoffers no
obvious advantages over a modern SEM with a high-
efficiency scintillator or semiconductor detector. In fact,
</p>
<p>the manufacturers of dedicated STEMs do not even
offer a BSE detector as an option, and it is doubtful if
it is worth installing one on a TEM/STEM.
</p>
<p>For both SE and BSE imaging in STEM, you can
look at both electron transparent or bulk samples of the
sort normally examined in a conventional SEM.Amajor
drawback to the STEM compared with the SEM is the
relative volume of themicroscope stage. In an SEM stage
you can insert samples up to several centimeters in diam-
eter and several centimeters thick, which means that
sample preparation from the original object is oftenmini-
mal. The confined-stage region of a STEM means that,
even with a specially designed holder for bulk samples,
the largest specimenwill be about 10mm� 5mmand not
more than a couple of millimeters deep.
</p>
<p>29.10 CHARGE-COLLECTION
MICROSCOPY AND
CATHODOLUMINESCENCE
</p>
<p>Charge-collection microscopy (CCM), otherwise
known as electron-beam induced conductivity (EBIC),
and the related phenomenon of cathodoluminescence
(CL) are common techniques for the characterization
of semiconductors in the SEM. It is possible to do the
same things in a STEM, but few have been brave enough
to try. You learned back in Section 7.1 about semicon-
ductor electron detectors in which the incident beam
generates electron-hole pairs which are swept apart by
the internal field of the p-n junction and not allowed to
</p>

<p>recombine. So if your specimen is a semiconductor, elec-
tron-hole pairs will be formed during the normal imaging
process. You have to separate out the pairs by applying
an external voltage through ohmic contacts evaporated
on the surface of your foil. Then you can use the electron
charge pulse to generate a signal on the STEM screen.
The signal is strong wherever the pairs are separated, and
weak at recombination centers such as dislocations and
stacking faults. You can also measure the minority car-
rier diffusion length. Now in a STEM you can easily see
the recombination centers by standard imaging tech-
niques, so CCM is not really any great advantage, but it
is essential in an SEM because the defects are subsurface.
</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t separate the electron-hole pairs, they recom-
bine and give off visible light. This light is an extremely
weak signal, but it can be detected anddispersed bymirrors
and spectrometers shown back in Figure 7.6. Again,
recombination centers appear dark in CL images because
most of the recombination is deep-level and non-radiative.
The advantage of CL over CCM is that you don&rsquo;t have to
coat your specimen to produce ohmic contacts, andyou get
a spectrum of light which contains information about
doping levels and band-gap changes. However, you have
to dedicate your STEM primarily to this imaging mode
and it is a difficult and tedious technique. Earlywork in this
area was pioneered by Petroff et al. and more recently by
Batstone. It is not obvious, however, that doing thework in
transmission offers major advantages over studies of bulk
samples in the SEM (see the textbooks byYacobi andHolt
and by Newbury et al.) and this is reflected in the limited
TEM applications of CL in the literature.
</p>
<p>29.11 ELECTRON HOLOGRAPHY
</p>
<p>Although the technique of electron holography became
widely known in the early 1990s, Gabor had originally
proposed the technique in 1948 as a way to improve the
resolution of the TEM. The delay in its wide implementa-
tion was due to the lack of affordable, reliable FEG
TEMs. An FEG is required so that the source will be
sufficiently coherent; the FEG is then the electron equiva-
lent of the laser. The topic is broader than you might have
guessed, unless you&rsquo;ve read the 1992 article by John Cow-
ley entitled &lsquo;Twenty forms of electron holography&rsquo; and the
text by Völkl et al. We&rsquo;ll discuss the general principles of
the technique and refer you to the companion text and the
references for the details and more ideas.
</p>
<p>The key feature is that, unlike conventional TEM imag-
ing techniques, both the amplitude and the phase of the
beam can be recorded.We can use this feature in two ways
</p>
<p>&amp; The effects of Cs can be partially corrected; thus we
can improve the resolution of the TEM.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can examine other phase-dependent phenomena,
such as those associated with magnetism.
</p>
<p>Several different forms of holography are possible;
the three best known are all based on the approach
described in Chapter 23
</p>
<p>&amp; In-line holography.
&amp; Single-sideband holography.
&amp; Off-axis holography.
</p>
<p>The approach which is mainly used in the TEM
is the off-axis variation, as we&rsquo;ll discuss later. Figure
29.16 shows a hologram of a wedge-shaped crystal
of Si oriented close to the [110] pole. The boxed

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>region of the figure shows a set of fringes which are only
70pm apart. These are not lattice fringes but do contain
phase information relating to the diffracted beams. In
order to analyze such images, you&rsquo;ll need the appropriate
software although much of the original research used
optical processing techniques; this is such a specialized
branch of image processing and image reconstruction
that we will not cover it in Chapter 31, but it is discussed
in the holography chapter in the companion text.
</p>
<p>The principle of holography is shown by the sche-
matic in Figure 29.17. Here w(u) is the function we used
in Chapter 28 to describe the effect of the objective-lens
aberrations and defocus. In conventional TEM, we
choose conditions so that the specimen acts as a pure
phase object and the imaginary part of eiw(u), i.e., the sine
term, converts this phase information into an amplitude
which we record as the image. With holography, we can
use the real part of the exponential too. A nice way to
think of the process is that, for a real specimen, w(u)
mixes the amplitude, A, and phase, o, from the speci-
men to give amplitude,A, and phase,O, in the image. In
conventional imaging we record A2 and lose all the
information on O. With holography, we don&rsquo;t lose any
information but we have to work hard to recover it. The
original proposal by Gabor, to use holography to
improve the resolution of the TEM, is being actively
pursued. Although holography has still not reached its
full potential in this field, you can see the future by
looking again at Figure 29.16.
</p>
<p>In practice, electron holography is carried out using
an FEG TEMwhich has been fitted with a beam splitter;
not every FEG TEM is so equipped. The beam splitter is
made by coating a thin glass fiber with metal to prevent it
charging, and assembled to give the biprism; i.e., it&rsquo;s the
biprism we discussed in Section 23.7 and can be&lt;0.5mm
in diameter. Part of the beam passes through the speci-
men while the other part forms the reference beam, as
shown in Figure 29.18. You must be able to rotate either
the biprism or the specimen. For holography, the biprism
is placed below the objective lens, e.g., at the position
usually occupied by the SAD aperture rod.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 29.17. A schematic of how the objective lens mixes the ampli-
</p>
<p>tude and phase components of the specimen to form the amplitude and
</p>
<p>phase components of the image. FIGURE 29.18. The operation of the biprism in electron holography.
</p>
<p>REFERENCE BEAM
The essential feature of the experiment is that a refer-
ence beam from the same coherent source passes out-
side your specimen and is then deflected by the
biprism so that it interferes with the beam that passed
through the specimen.

<p>HOLOGRAM

<p>HOLOGRAPHY

process requires recording both the intensity and the
phase information of the waves emitted or scattered
by the object.

<p>All that you then have to do is interpret the inter-
ference pattern, i.e., the electron hologram, but as you&rsquo;ll
appreciate after reading Chapter 31, this process is not
trivial. However, the technique does provide the possi-
bility for &lsquo;coherent processing&rsquo; of the electron wave. In
principle, all the required data can be recovered from
one hologram but the technique is unlikely to replace
conventional HRTEM in most applications.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll conclude this section by illustrating one of the
unique applications of the technique, namely, the imaging
of magnetization characteristics and flux lines which has
been developed byTonomura. Figure 29.19 shows a series
of images illustrating how magnetization patterns can be
imaged both for single particles and for an actual record-
ing medium. Tonomura&rsquo;s classic studies of the quantiza-
tion of flux lines in superconducting materials is
illustrated in Figure 29.20A. As the ring is gradually
cooled, the phase shift due to the magnetization changes
until it becomes superconducting: the phase shift inside
the ring then becomes exactly p. The other images in
Figure 29.20B and C show flux lines constricting as they
enter the superconductor. Notice that you can also clearly
see these flux lines outside the specimen: themagnetic field
outside the specimen influences the electron beam.

<p>29.12 IN-SITU TEM: DYNAMIC
EXPERIMENTS
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned several times that we can use the TEM
for in-situ experiments. In Chapter 8, we described
holders you can use to heat the specimen, e.g., causing
phase transformations, or to strain it to change the defect

<p>structure. In Section 7.3.C, we discussed CCD video
cameras, which are the best way to record dynamic
changes in the microstructure, and in this chapter,
we&rsquo;ve discussed imaging moving flux lines in magnetic
materials. In situ experiments remove the doubts that
exist whenever you observematerials after heat treatment
or after deformation and then try to infer what actually
happened at temperature or during deformation. It is
implicitly assumed inmost TEM investigations that cool-
ing a heat-treated specimen to room temperature or
removing the applied stress does not change the micro-
structure. Having made this assumption, we draw con-
clusions about what happened during our experiment.
However, this assumption is clearly not valid for many
situations. Nevertheless, we generally view our specimen
at ambient temperatures and not under load.
</p>
<p>In fact, there are good reasonswhywe rarelydo in-situ
experiments. The main reason is that such studies are
difficult to perform on thin specimens. As we indicated
in Section 26.8, when the surface properties dominate the
bulk properties, as is often the case in thin specimens,
TEM images and their analysis can bemisleading. Surface
diffusion is much more rapid than bulk diffusion and
defects are subject to different stress states in thin foils
where surface relaxation effect may dominate. The best
</p>
<p>way to overcome this limitation is to use much thicker
specimens and this requires higher voltages. In-situ experi-
mentation was widely used in the 1960s and 1970s when
1&ndash;3MV instruments were first constructed and used to
look through foils which were &gt;1 mm thick (see the book
byButler andHale andFigures 26.14 and26.15). So in-situ
experiments canbe expensive: currently there is no longer a
TEM operating at&gt;400 kV in the USA.
</p>
<p>However, the advent of 300&ndash;400 kV IVEMs, the
construction of megaVolt instruments in Stuttgart and
Japan and the extra space (because of the larger pole-
piece gap) that is potentially available in Cs-corrected
TEMs have brought a resurgence of interest in using in
situ experimentation. Developments in electron optics,
stage design, and recording media since the 1960s mean
that combined HRTEM and in-situ experimentation is
now possible. This combination is a powerful tool, per-
mitting the observation of reactions at the atomic level,
such as the motion of individual ledges at interfaces, as
in Figure 29.21, although lower-resolution images are
no less impressive.
</p>
<p>You must bear in mind that the experiments you
perform in situ are taking place under conditions that
still do not approach the bulk conditions experienced by
many engineering materials. In particular, the high-keV

<p>electron flux brings an uncertainty to all in-situ experi-
ments, particularly if you are trying to infer kinetic data
from measurements taken of reactions. So while in-situ
experiments can give you powerful demonstrations of
real-time changes in materials, be wary of direct inter-
pretation. You have to ensure you are controlling all the
variables, and you must cross-check kinetic data with
calculations to verify that, e.g., diffusion fluxes are con-
sistent with the known temperature and not influenced
by surface or vacancy effects, having said that, it is none-
theless very useful to have access to an IVEM for this
kind of experiment.
</p>
<p>29.13 FLUCTUATION MICROSCOPY
</p>
<p>Fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) is a technique
invented by Treacy and Gibson that has come into
prominence in the last decade to study medium-range
order (�0.5&ndash;2 nm) in amorphous materials, such as
glasses, amorphous silicon and carbon. We saw back
in Section 18.7 how to use different kinds of diffraction
and imaging to study these increasingly importantmate-
rials and FEM is a hybrid imaging and diffraction tech-
nique. The &lsquo;fluctuation&rsquo; refers to changes in the local
structure and orientation of the glass where &lsquo;local&rsquo;
means not quite down at the atomic level.
</p>
<p>You can doFEMexperiments in two equivalent ways.
Either you can form a hollow-cone DF image (go back
and check Figure 18.14) or you can do STEM diffraction
with a fine probe, scanning the pattern across the STEM
detector. The normalized variance of the intensity distri-
bution in the microdiffraction patterns gives equivalent
information to the hollow-cone image. In both modes,
you insert a small objective aperture which, in either
mode, limits the resolution of the fluctuation image to
�1&ndash;2 nm. This resolution matches the dimensional scale
of local structural fluctuations, which appear as speckles
in the image (see Figure 29.22A and B). Depending on the
degree of local coherence in the random network struc-
ture, the speckles (both bright and dark regions) vary in
intensity. More random structures give gray regions;
more ordered structures give locally brighter or darker
regions depending on whether the local electron scatter is
on axis or off axis (intercepted by the diaphragm), respec-
tively (Figure 29.22C).
</p>
<p>29.14 OTHER VARIATIONS POSSIBLE
IN A STEM
</p>
<p>We can form images with the characteristic X-rays and
the energy-loss electrons that we detect with the
appropriate spectrometers. Rather than discuss these
here, we&rsquo;ll save the topics for the chapters devoted to
XEDS and EELS in Part 4.
</p>
<p>In a STEM then, we can, in theory, detect and
measure all of the signals generated in a thin speci-
men and shown way back in Figure 1.3. We can
reproduce all the conventional TEM imaging meth-
ods and some unconventional ones too, such as Z-
contrast and most of the specialized techniques in
this chapter. Remember that for all the STEM sig-
nals we use a detector of one form or another. We
can make detectors of different shapes and sizes, as
we already described for looking at directional scat-
tering from magnetic specimens. Remember also that
the detectors permit us to digitize the signal so we
can process it, manipulate it, and present it for view-
ing in ways that are impossible with analog TEM
images. Most STEM systems come with relatively
basic image processing, such as black level, gain,
contrast, brightness, gamma, Y modulation, and sig-
nal addition and subtraction. The computer system
for X-ray and EELS analysis often has a lot of
image analysis software thrown in. So there&rsquo;s a lot
you can do with the STEM images that really fall
into the category of digital image processing which
you may study in Russ&rsquo;s specialist texts, after you&rsquo;ve
read Chapter 31.

<p>the plot) due to the C&ndash;C bond distance, which is ordinarily for-
</p>
<p>bidden. Structure noise from truly amorphous sample will not give a
</p>

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
We&rsquo;ve described only a few of the many ways that we can manipulate the electron beam to
produce different images and different contrast phenomena, and it is more than likely that
there are still unknown methods awaiting discovery. For example, the introduction of a
continuously variable detector collection angle in STEM is equivalent to using a continu-
ously variable iris-type objective aperture in TEM and offers new imaging possibilities.
Similarly, there is much to be learned frommutually complementary techniques in SEMand
TEM.
</p>
<p>We scarcely mentioned the use of annular apertures, conical illumination, pre- and post-
specimen scanning, or rocking. All of these are possible, so you should be prepared to try
new things in the microscope and see what the effects are. Many advances of the sort we
have described only came about by accident, but themicroscopist was wise enough to see the
effect and try and understand it, rather than dismiss it as unimportant.

<p>Image Simulation
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>When we need to obtain information about the specimen in two directions, we need to align
the specimen close to a low-index zone axis. If the HRTEM image information is going to be
directly interpretable, the specimen must be oriented with the incident beam exactly aligned
with both the optic axis of the TEM and the zone axis of the specimen. Thus, we will have
many reflections excited and the simple two-beam analysis of Chapter 27 cannot be used.
</p>
<p>A method for modeling the contrast of images obtained under these conditions was
developed by Cowley,Moodie, and their co-workers, principally atMelbourne andArizona
State University (ASU), in a series of classic papers beginning with that by Cowley and
Moodie in 1957. Fortunately, the growing interest in HRTEM has coincided with the
availability of increasingly powerful computers which can handle the extensive calculations.
</p>
<p>There are several software packages available commercially, so there is little reason for
most users to re-invent the wheel. However, the different packages do not necessarily
perform the calculations in the sameway: onemay bemore appropriate for your application
than others. Since these packages essentially operate as &lsquo;black boxes&rsquo; it is also reassuring to
simulate images from the same structure using different packages (unless they don&rsquo;t give the
same answers).
</p>
<p>One point to keep in mind as you work through the literature is that this subject already
has a lot of history. We will point out some of the things that have been done, and in some
cases continue to be done, for historical reasons.
</p>
<p>30.1 SIMULATING IMAGES
</p>
<p>The idea of simulating HRTEM images arose because
of the realization that the loss of phase information
when we form an experimental intensity map means
that we can&rsquo;t go back from the image to the structure.
Instead, we assume a structure (perfect crystal or crys-
talline material containing defects), simulate the image,
see how closely the simulated image resembles the
experimental image, modify the structure, and repeat
the process. The only difficulty is that the image is
sensitive to several factors
</p>
<p>&amp; The precise alignment of the beam with respect to
both the specimen and the optic axis.
</p>
<p>&amp; The thickness of the specimen (as we saw in Chapter
28).
</p>
<p>&amp; The defocus of the objective lens.
&amp; Chromatic aberration which becomes more impor-
tant as t, the thickness, increases.
</p>
<p>&amp; Coherence of the beam.
</p>
<p>&amp; Other factors: one example would be the intrinsic
vibration in the material which we try to take
account of through the Debye-Waller factor.
</p>
<p>In principle, we could have the same image from two
different structures. So obviously, this is the tricky part!
</p>
<p>30.2 THE MULTISLICE METHOD
</p>
<p>The basic multislice approach used in most of the simu-
lation packages is to section the specimen into many
slices, which are normal to the incident beam.
</p>
<p>There are different methods for actually performing
the multislice calculation. The different approaches
have been developed for several reasons. Some try to
optimize the use of available hardware. Others were
written with the intention of providing a convenient
method of simulating DPs using the same program. At
least one package was written to make use of a popular
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>personal computer with a user-friendly interface
(see Table 30.1). The principal methods for performing
these calculations are
</p>
<p>&amp; The reciprocal-space formalism.
&amp; The FFT formalism.
&amp; The real-space approach.
&amp; The Bloch-wave approach.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go through the special features of each
approach. The software packages which are readily
available are listed in Section 1.6 and in Table 30.1.
</p>
<p>30.3 THE RECIPROCAL-SPACE
APPROACH
</p>
<p>Weproject each slice onto a plane somewhere in the slice
(usually top, bottom, or middle) giving a projected
potential for that slice, and we call this the phase grat-
ing. We then calculate the amplitudes and phases for all
the beams which will be generated by the incident beam
interacting with the first projection plane. We could
think of this as being a many-beam image calculation
for a single slice. We then allow all these beams to
propagate down the microscope in free space until
they meet the next phase grating, which need not be
the same as the first. The scattering calculation is now
repeated for all the beams incident on this plane. This
calculation produces a new set of beams which propa-
gate through free space to the next phase grating, and so
on. The process is summarized in Figure 30.1.
</p>
<p>One point which you must remember: scattering by
the phase grating does not just produce Bragg beams. It
is crucial to keep track of the scattering in all directions.
All of these beams will be incident on the next phase
grating. So we don&rsquo;t just have Bragg beams, we sample
all of reciprocal space.
</p>
<p>A calculation based on a 128� 128 array will impose
a limit of �4096 on the number of &lsquo;beams&rsquo; which can be
included in the calculation. This number might appear
large, especially when you form a [110] HRTEM image
of Si with six Bragg beams (plus the O beam) but,
particularly for imperfect crystals, this number will be
inadequate.

</p>
<p>k-SPACE BETWEEN THE BRAGG BEAMS
Why do we need to consider regions of k-space
between the Bragg beams? In other words, why do
we need to sample all of reciprocal space? The answer
is that the Bragg beams contain information about
the periodic structure, but all of the information from
defects, i.e., non-periodic structure, is contained
between the Bragg spots, though it will generally be
quite close to them.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Essentially the multislice method considers three
components
</p>
<p>&amp; c describes the electron wave.
&amp; P is the propagation of the electron wave in free
space: the microscope.
</p>
<p>&amp; Q is the phase grating: the specimen.
</p>
<p>The process can be described by this equation
</p>
<p>cn&thorn;1 k&eth; &THORN; &frac14; cn k&eth; &THORN;Pn&thorn;1 k&eth; &THORN;&frac12; ��Qn&thorn;1 k&eth; &THORN; (30:1)
</p>
<p>where cn+1(k) is the wave function in reciprocal space
at the exit of the n+1 slice and the symbol � denotes a
convolution as before. Pn+1(k) is the propagator for the
n+1 slice. In other words, this is expressing the Fresnel
diffraction phenomenon for this one slice because we are
</p>
<p>making a near-field calculation. (Look back to Section
2.8 for a discussion of near-field versus far-field.) Simi-
larly, Qn+1(k) is the phase-grating function; it is a trans-
mission function, for the n+1 slice.
</p>
<p>The three functions c(k), P(k), and Q(k) are all
functions in reciprocal space, so this approach is
referred to as the reciprocal-space formulation. Notice
that they are all two-dimensional arrays. We can think
of the different terms as being diffracted beams within
the specimen. We can easily insert a circular objective
aperture of radius r; we just require that all values of
c(k) are zero for k &gt; kr.
</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the complexities involved,
consider what values of Q(k) you must use in the calcu-
lation. Q(k) must go out twice as far as c(k) or P(k) in
reciprocal space. You can understand why by consider-
ing Figure 30.2. If you represent the number of

<p>The function Q(k) is a &lsquo;probability map.&rsquo; What we are
doing here is using the convolution to describe multiple
scattering.
</p>
<p>We can illustrate the complexity of the calculation
by considering a 128 � 128 array for Q(k) using
SHRLI81 (see Table 30.1). The maximum value for
(kx,ky) is only (31,31) but even so, the number of dif-
fracted beams is nearly 4096. Remember, we usually just
use the seven inner Bragg beams in, e.g., the Si &lt;110&gt;
DP, as we saw in Figure 27.3; most of the beams in our
calculation are not Bragg beams. However, you will
remember that the information concerning defects in
crystals is contained in the regions between the Bragg
spots in the DP, so it does make sense. Specific examples
of Q(k), including numerical computations of the phase
change per slice, are given by John Barry.
</p>
<p>30.4 THE FFT APPROACH
</p>
<p>We can recast equation 30.3 to maximize the efficiency
of the computer in using fast Fourier transform (FFT)
routines. In equation 30.4, the notation F and F &ndash;1 tell us
to take the Fourier transform or the inverse transform
of the function inside the brackets.
</p>
<p>cn&thorn;1 k&eth; &THORN; &frac14; F F�1 cn k&eth; &THORN;Pn&thorn;1 k&eth; &THORN;&frac12; �qn&thorn;1 r&eth; &THORN;
� �
</p>
<p>(30:4)
</p>
<p>In this equation, qn+1(r) is the real space form of
Qn+1(k), i.e., it is the inverse Fourier transform of
Qn+1(k). So q(r) is a real-space phase grating. Now we
can look at some numbers for the calculation and take
Q(k) as a 128 � 128 array to keep the calculation small.
The main steps carried out by the computer are
</p>
<p>&amp; Multiply cn(k) by Pn+1(k): that is a 64 � 64 array
times another 64 � 64 array. Remember that we are
limited to 64 points, if we have a 128 � 128 array,
because the Q array must be twice as large in all
directions in k space.
</p>
<p>&amp; Take the inverse Fourier transform of the result.
&amp; Multiply this new result by qn+1(r) which is the 128�
128 array.
</p>
<p>&amp; Fourier transform the final result and set all values
outside the inner 64 � 64 array equal to zero so that
we can repeat the process for the next slice.
</p>
<p>You will notice that this example used a square
array. In modern programs, we are not restricted even
to using powers of 2 but this helped the original FFT
routines. You will see the value of this advance when we
examine some defect calculations later. If you are inter-
ested in the mechanics of the FFT routine and other
aspects of this simulation approach, the article by Mike
O&rsquo;Keefe and Roar Kilaas is required reading.
</p>
<p>30.5 THE REAL-SPACE APPROACH
</p>
<p>As we noted earlier, image simulation used to be limited
by your budget, i.e., by your computer. The real-space
approach was developed, in part, to decrease the time
needed for the calculations by using our knowledge that
P(r) is strongly peaked in the forward direction. In our
notation, the method developed by Coene and Van
Dyck for calculating c(r) can be expressed by the
equation
</p>
<p>cn&thorn;1 r&eth; &THORN; &frac14; cn r&eth; &THORN; � Pn&thorn;1 r&eth; &THORN;&frac12; �qn&thorn;1 r&eth; &THORN; (30:5)
</p>
<p>where Pn+1(r) is now the propagator in real space and
qn+1(r) is again the real-space phase grating. Once you
have written this, it&rsquo;s all computing, which is a substan-
tial task since the size of the multislice calculation is the
size of the largest array, i.e., Q(k) or q(r).
</p>
<p>30.6 BLOCH WAVES AND HRTEM
SIMULATION
</p>
<p>Although we saw in Chapters 14 and 15 that electrons
propagate through crystalline specimens as Bloch
waves, the multislice method we&rsquo;ve described so far is
essentially a &lsquo;diffracted-beam&rsquo; approach. In two classic
papers Fujimoto (1978) andKambe (1982) showed that,
for the perfect crystal, the HRTEM image may be
understood simply in terms of images of Bloch waves.
The key point is that, although a large number of dif-
fracted waves are formed, only a small number of Bloch
waves determine the appearance of the image, providing
the crystal has a sufficiently high symmetry. Following
Kambe&rsquo;s &lsquo;simple&rsquo; example, we consider the case where
only three Bloch waves i, j, and k are significant. Let&rsquo;s
assume that Bloch waves i and j are in phase at a thick-
ness z= D. Then we have
</p>
<p>eik
i&eth; &THORN;
z z &frac14; eik
</p>
<p>j&eth; &THORN;
z D (30:6)
</p>

<p>C i&eth; &THORN;f i&eth; &THORN; x; y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; 1 (30:8)

<p>we can therefore expressc at z=D in terms of our three
Bloch waves.

<p>bik D&eth; &THORN; &frac14; ei k
k&eth; &THORN;
z �k i&eth; &THORN;z&eth; &THORN;D � 1 (30:12)
</p>
<p>These equations tell us that if any two of the Bloch
waves (here they are i and j) are in phase then the
amplitude of the wave at the exit surface is determined
by the third Bloch wave.
</p>
<p>If the third Bloch wave is also nearly in phase, we
have a relation like equation 30.6 but with i, j, and k all
equal. Then we can approximate bik(D) by
</p>
<p>bik D&eth; &THORN; &frac14; i k k&eth; &THORN;z � k i&eth; &THORN;z
� �
</p>
<p>D&thorn; 2np
h i
</p>
<p>&frac14; igik D&eth; &THORN; (30:13)
</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve defined another factor gik. If you plug this
expression back into equation 30.11, you see we have a
pure phase object. All the diffracted beams will be
shifted in phase by p/2.
</p>
<p>Now you can test the effects of how we change k.
Consider what conditions this will really correspond to
using equations 30.11 and 30.13
</p>
<p>&amp; If k is such that the phase of Bloch wave k is ahead of
i and j (which were equal), then you&rsquo;ll see a &lsquo;negative&rsquo;
image ofC(k)f(k). A &lsquo;delayed&rsquo; k gives us the &lsquo;positive&rsquo;
image.
</p>
<p>&amp; For the Ge &lt;110&gt; zone axis, HRTEM image at
100 kV, only three Bloch waves are strongly excited.
</p>
<p>The relationship to the Bloch-wave contours inChap-
ter 14 is clear. Using this information and the projected
potential shown in Figure 30.3, Kambe calculated the
Bloch-wave amplitudes and the two ideal images of the
Bloch waves: one positive and the other negative. In the
calculation of different images for increasing thickness,
several images corresponding to a single Bloch wave can
be predicted and identified, as shown in the figure. At
other thicknesses, the images form by a combination of
Bloch waves. So, what can we learn?
</p>
<p>&amp; For a perfect crystal, you may need as few as three
Bloch waves to give the essential features of an
HRTEM zone-axis image.
</p>
<p>&amp; There is a direct connection between the WPOA
(go back to the definition if you don&rsquo;t remember)
and the propagation of Bloch waves.
</p>
<p>We saw in Chapter 14 that the electron propagates as
Bloch waves inside the crystal. The reason we don&rsquo;t use
Bloch waves is that our specimens are not perfect. How-
ever, EMSdoes give you the optionof using this approach.
</p>
<p>30.7 THE EWALD SPHERE IS CURVED
</p>
<p>When you are using the TEM, some other complica-
tions arise because the Ewald sphere is curved
</p>
<p>&amp; If you align the beam exactly parallel to a zone axis, s
will be non-zero for every Bragg reflection. In fact, it
will also be different for each type of reflection.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you do not align the beam exactly parallel to the
zone axis, then s will also be slightly different for
each reflection in that zone.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you change the wavelength of the electrons, the
radius of the sphere changes.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you converge the beam, then you&rsquo;ll add a thickness
to the Ewald sphere.
</p>
<p>The point is, knowing precisely what the correct
values are to put in the program will also require
thought and work.
</p>
<p>30.8 CHOOSING THE THICKNESS
OF THE SLICE
</p>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve just cut the specimen into slices in the
computer without considering how thick each slice
should be, or even whether they should all be the
</p>
<p>kTH BLOCH WAVE
Don&rsquo;t confuse the kth Bloch wave with the k-vector!
</p>
<p>THE MULTISLICE APPROACH
We usually use this to simulate HRTEM images. It is
actually a very elegant form of brute force.
</p>
<p>30 .8 CHOOS ING THE THICKNESS OF THE SL ICE .................................................................................................................................. 537</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>same. If all the slices are the same, then there can be no
information about the z-direction. Although HOLZ
lines are not important for the simulation of HRTEM
images, some of the programswe are discussing can now
just as readily be used to simulate CBED patterns and
HOLZ lines. So, following the philosophy of attacking
problems with different techniques, you should be
aware of these limitations, since it is easy to overlook
the simplifications youmade once you see the computed
image. You should remember that when you are study-
ing a material with a large unit cell, the reciprocal lattice
spacing will be short in the beam direction, so HOLZ
effects come into play sooner.
</p>
<p>Consider the different methods for making the slice
</p>
<p>&amp; You could calculate the projected potential for a
thick slice and then do n calculations with slices
which are 1/n times this thickness.
</p>
<p>&amp; Abetter approach would be to subdivide the cell into
layers of atoms, create a different grating for each of
these layers, and then run the program with the
sequence.
</p>
<p>For example, if the beam is aligned along the [111]
direction of an fcc crystal, then you would have three
identical gratings displaced relative to one another, giv-
ing the ABC stacking of close-packed planes. This
approach would allow you to test for the effect of a
real error in the stacking sequence normal to the beam.
Even this point can be a bit difficult. In general, you
orient the beam to be parallel to a particular zone axis
[UVW] so that the planes in that zone are parallel to the
beam (so our projection works). If the material is not
cubic, we will not generally have a low-index plane
normal to the beam to make this slice.
</p>
<p>30.9 BEAM CONVERGENCE
</p>
<p>When you are recording HRTEM images, you need to
keep exposure times short. So, if you don&rsquo;t use parallel
illumination, you have to take account of the beam
convergence when simulating the images. O&rsquo;Keefe and
Kilaas (see also the paper by Self and O&rsquo;Keefe) have
developed one approach to address this problem. If

<p>the beam actually has some convergence, then the
diffraction spots will be disks, as illustrated in Figure
30.4, so you need to simulate disks in the DP. Experi-
mentally, the large objective aperture admits many
disks, so in the simulation routine you should sample
each disk at many points. This means the program
needs to calculate the image at each of these conver-
gence angles and average all the resulting images. Of
course, the objective aperture is easily applied in the
computer. If you choose 49 points, you can make the
sampling interval in reciprocal space �0.1 nm�1. It is
instructive to examine just how much work is neces-
sary to sample the 49 points.

<p>We can start by writing the usual expression for the
w, the phase change due to the objective lens

</p>
<p>This equation tells us that if u changes by du, then w
changes by

<p>dw &frac14; 2pl uDf&thorn; Csl2u3

<p>Now we choose dw so that

in w between two points in the disk. For example, if n=

equations 30.15 and 30.17, we can write

<p>The value of du therefore depends on both Cs and Df.
</p>
<p>You can also appreciate the relevance of this type of
approach if your disks actually intersect the objective
aperture, as shown in Figure 30.4. Put another way, you
can learn two lessons from this analysis
</p>
<p>&amp; Always try to minimize the convergence of the beam
when recording HRTEM images.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use an aperture which does not cut through the
diffraction disks.
</p>
<p>30.10 MODELING THE STRUCTURE
</p>
<p>To simulate any HRTEM image, you need a unit cell. If
you are concerned only with perfect crystals, then your
program should have all the space groups already
included so that you only need to add the lattice para-
meters (lengths and angles) and the occupied sites for
your material. If you are interested in simulating images
from defects, then you have to create a new unit cell
which must be sufficiently large that it will not add
effects due to the edges. There are many ways to create
this defect unit cell. You can input from other programs,
such as those performing atomistic modeling of defects,
or create your own starting structure. In either case, you
will need to move atoms, either manually or following a
rule you&rsquo;ve selected for image matching, to optimize the
match between your experimental series of through-
focus images and the simulated images.
</p>
<p>At some stage, you will find it useful to combine
different slices, as when simulating GBs with or without
a surface groove, or modeling large complex unit cells
using a multilayer approach. We&rsquo;ll now go through some
specific features of this task and return to modeling in
Chapter 31 when we discuss quantitative HRTEM.
</p>
<p>30.11 SURFACE GROOVES
AND SIMULATING FRESNEL CONTRAST
</p>
<p>The analysis of interfaces by the Fresnel-fringe tech-
nique, which we introduced in Chapter 23, illustrates
the importance of image simulation and emphasizes
</p>
<p>that it is not just for HRTEM. The calculation is com-
plicated for several reasons, as shown in Figure 30.5A
</p>
<p>&amp; The potential change at the interface is probably not
abrupt.
</p>
<p>&amp; The potential depends on the detailed structure of
the interface.
</p>
<p>&amp; During preparation, TEM specimens may be prefer-
entially damaged at GBs, giving rise to surface
grooves.
</p>
<p>If you use a thicker specimen, you&rsquo;ll reduce the effect
of surface grooves on any Fresnel fringes, but in prac-
tice, your foil thickness is usually limited (�20 nm),
since you need to view the boundary exactly edge-on.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Even for foils this thick, surface grooves can influence
the projected potential considerably. If we assume that
the bulk has a mean inner potential V= 20V, and take
a typical potential drop for an intergranular film to be
�1V, then the total projected potential drop for a 20 nm
thick foil would be the same as that caused by a pair of
grooves at the top and bottom surfaces which are only
0.5 nm deep. Although the surface groove may be partly
filled with a second phase, the effect on the Fresnel
fringes can still be substantial.
</p>
<p>We can examine Fresnel fringes using different
methods. In all of them, we describe the potential at
the interface in terms of the projected potential drop
DVp = tDV, an inner width a, and an outer width a0,
and a &lsquo;diffuseness,&rsquo; d, defined by
</p>
<p>a0 &frac14; &eth;1&thorn; d&THORN;a (30:22)
</p>
<p>These parameters are shown in Figure 30.5B. Then we
construct models of a foil with a surface groove at the
edge-on interface by combining such potentials.
</p>
<p>The models: Values of d=0.5 and d=0.2 represent
shallow and steep surface grooves, respectively. The
total projected potential drop can be due to a real
change in V or a change in t. A groove without a film
implies a=0. If a = 1nm and a0 = 1.5 nm, the model
could correspond to two different situations
</p>
<p>&amp; If the atoms at the interface relax, then the atomic
density at the interface will usually be reduced. This
occurs at both structured interfaces and those where
a layer of glass is present.
</p>
<p>&amp; Surface grooves at the interface.
</p>
<p>What image simulation shows is that the relative
shapes and sizes of these models are more important
than the actual dimensions. Therefore, we can give most
of the following analysis in terms of dimensionless
quantities. Inner potentials are typically 5&ndash;10 eV.
Except for very small defocus values (Df&lt;� t), we find
that the distribution of the potential through the foil is
not important. Usually, the projected potential at the
interface is lower than that in the bulk. However, the
opposite situation can occur, e.g., when a Bi2O3-rich
phase is present at interfaces in ZnO. When we discuss
the calculated profiles, the term &lsquo;interface width&rsquo; will be
used for the parameters a and a0, whether they actually
correspond to an intergranular film, a surface groove, or
otherwise.
</p>
<p>This relation was first described by Clarke and only
holds when a is large and Df is relatively small; then the
fringes from each &lsquo;edge&rsquo; at the interface are indepen-
dent. We observe the minimum fringe spacing at small
values of defocus and this spacing can be used to pro-
vide a measure of the interface width. For more details
on the simulation of Fresnel fringes, you should check
the original articles.
</p>
<p>In practice, the analysis of Fresnel fringes is
impaired, not only by specimen artifacts such as sur-
face grooves, but also by various sources of noise,
which all add to the uncertainty of measurements,
especially at small values of Df. For diffuse interfaces,
the contrast decreases rapidly as Df approaches zero
(Figure 30.5C), and measurements of the fringe spac-
ing for a&gt; 0.7 are increasingly susceptible to noise and
artifacts. You can always use larger defocus values
and thus obtain higher contrast. However, without
prior knowledge about the shape of the potential
drop (its &lsquo;diffuseness&rsquo;), we can&rsquo;t reliably determine
the interface width by measuring the fringe spacing
alone. Since the fringe spacing is dominated by the
outer width, a0, we may easily overestimate the inter-
face width. The atomic density in a region close to the
boundary is also often reduced, even if the boundary is
structured, so you can easily misinterpret the image as
showing the presence of an intergranular film when
actually there is no amorphous film.
</p>
<p>The region of defocus, where the central fringe
shows little contrast, provides complementary informa-
tion to the fringe spacings, so it is more sensitive to the
inner width.
</p>
<p>From this discussion, you&rsquo;ll appreciate that, before
you can completely understand the effect of any inter-
granular films, you must estimate the extent to which
surface grooves are present in your specimen. Shadow-
ing (e.g., using platinum or gold) may provide evidence
for surface grooves, but in the case where the surface
groove is already filled (e.g., if your specimen was
coated with carbon or contaminated without your
knowing), this technique won&rsquo;t work.
</p>
<p>To summarize, this discussion gives us a method for
analyzing Fresnel fringes from aGB.We can draw some
conclusions
</p>
<p>&amp; To interpret the contrast from Fresnel fringes at
GBs, you must simulate images of many different
interfacemodels. In particular, it is essential that you
</p>
<p>SPACING OF FRESNEL FRINGES
The distance from the edge to the first fringe is pro-
portional to (lDf )1/2. The fringe spacing, sf, can be
extrapolated to zero defocus to obtain the interface
width, based on the relation (sf &ndash; a) /
</p>
<p>p
(lDf).
</p>
<p>CHARACTERIZING A POTENTIAL
The conclusion is that you must use all the informa-
tion in the image to characterize the shape of a poten-
tial well and you need to know what is in it!
</p>
<p>30 .11 SURFACE GROOVES AND S IMULAT ING FRESNEL CONTRAST ............................................................................................... 541</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>consider the possibility of artifacts such as surface
grooving. Even a rather &lsquo;flat&rsquo; or diffuse surface
groove may influence the fringes in some range of
defocus values.
</p>
<p>&amp; Both the fringe spacing and the central fringe inten-
sity depend on the shape of the potential well and are
sensitive to surface grooving.
</p>
<p>&amp; The interface width, which you can infer from the
fringe spacing, is dominated by the outer width of a
diffuse interface.
</p>
<p>&amp; A direct match with the sf &ndash; a curve (or with similar
simulated curves when the assumptions employed
here fail) leads to a better estimate of the average
interface width, but cannot give you much informa-
tion on the shape of the potential well.
</p>
<p>&amp; Determining when the central fringe is weak (the
range Df) gives complementary information on the
interface width which, in combination with the esti-
mate based on the fringe spacing, you can use to
evaluate the diffuseness of the potential well.
</p>
<p>30.12 CALCULATING IMAGES
OF DEFECTS
</p>
<p>When we simulate HRTEM images of perfect crystals,
we only need to input the unit cell and the program
generates the rest of the specimen. If wewant to calculate
the image of a defect, we have to use the same approach:
we set up a unit cell to contain the defect and the pro-
gram treats it like any other unit cell. This is known as
the periodic continuation method for defect calculation.
What we&rsquo;ve actually done is shown in Figure 30.6: there
is an array of defects throughout our specimen in all
directions. We need to know two things
</p>
<p>&amp; To what extent does this ordered array introduce
artifacts in the image?
</p>
<p>&amp; Have we created interfaces where the &lsquo;cells&rsquo; join
which may influence our image?
</p>
<p>An example of a supercell for a GB is shown in
Figure 30.6. This figure illustrates clearly how we can
create a cell which is more suitable for this periodic
continuation by including two defects in a single super-
cell. As shown in this figure, the periodic continuation
then not only creates many other GBs but also makes
them very long. If we don&rsquo;t match the crystals exactly at
the edges of the supercell we create a different &lsquo;ghost&rsquo;
boundary.
</p>
<p>You can see that this really can be a problem by
considering the DP which our new cell would produce.
We are calculating the image of a small part of a periodic
array of interfaces. Periodic arrays in real space produce
rows of extra spots in reciprocal space. If we include
these spots in forming the image, we should change the
image. The solution for image simulation is quite simple,
make the supercell wider and wider until the change in
the image detail is less than some specified limit. How-
ever, don&rsquo;t try to interpret the data in the calculated DP
without consulting the paper by Wilson and Spargo.
</p>
<p>An alternative approach to the periodic continua-
tion approach has been developed by Coene et al. and is
called the real-space patchingmethod. This method uses
the &lsquo;real-space&rsquo; image simulation approach to perform
the calculation. The structure you want to simulate can
be divided into a number of different &lsquo;patches&rsquo; as illu-
strated in Figure 30.7; the image from each patch is

The periodic continuation is most widely used. Real-

<p>calculated for a slice and then the patches are joined
together. The key, of course, is that you must correctly
take account of what happens at the edge of each patch.
This means each patch needs some information about
the neighboring patches. Assuming (correctly) that this
can be done, you can appreciate the nice feature of this
approach: we avoid the artificial interference effects due
to the array of defects that would be produced by the
periodic continuation technique. The defect does not
now &lsquo;see&rsquo; its own image; it only sees the perfect matrix
on all sides.
</p>
<p>30.13 SIMULATING QUASICRYSTALS
</p>
<p>There are several problems in simulating HRTEM
images of quasicrystals, not least of which concerns
which model you should use. (Remember that quasi-
crystals are not periodic objects anyway!) Several
models have been reviewed by Shoemaker, and the
possibilities are illustrated by the work of Beeli and
Horiuchi, who used a combination of 10 layers in the
multislice calculation. The layers are made up from
the planar structures shown in Figure 30.8. The final
structure (shown in Figure 30.8A) is made up of two
</p>
<p>sets of five layers. The first set of layers is B-C-D-C-B
in this figure. The second set of five layers is con-
structed from the first by using the screw symmetry
of the structure; the screw axis has 105 screw symme-
try. The supercell used was 3.882 nm by 3.303 nm
which was chosen to contain a complete decagonal
cluster which is 2.04 nm in diameter and the center
part of a pentagon tile. The calculation was then
carried out for thicknesses up to 10 nm.
</p>
<p>The results of such calculations with only Al andMn
atoms are illustrated in Figure 30.9. The edges of the
cells are essentially artificial because, as we just noted,
the structure used in the calculation is a &lsquo;unit cell&rsquo; and a
quasicrystal doesn&rsquo;t have one. In spite of these difficul-
ties Beeli and Horiuchi could conclude that the image
match was much improved when Pd atoms were
included to replace some of the Mn atoms in the D
layer and Al atoms in the B-C layers with the results
shown in Figure 30.10.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Another illustration of the success of HRTEM
comes from the work of Jiang et al. on quasicrystals
with eightfold symmetry. Here the multislice calcula-
tion could again be made using a relatively simple
sequence of four layers ABAB0, where the layers are
at z = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. The structures of the A
and B layers are shown in Figure 30.11 with the B0
</p>
<p>layer being a 458-rotated B layer; i.e., the B and B0
</p>
<p>layers are again related by a screw axis, this time, it&rsquo;s
an 84 screw axis.
</p>
<p>&amp; In each of these examples, it is possible to view the
same structure parallel to an orthogonal axis.
</p>
<p>&amp; Quasicrystals do not have translational symmetry,
but we pretend they do for thickness calculations
and for the periodic continuation of the unit cell.
</p>
<p>Our reason for showing so much detail on these
rather esoteric materials is that they show what can be
done using image simulation. Furthermore, they
</p>
<p>emphasize the important fact that although we can
construct the crystal using different layers and different
sequences of layers, we always use a projection of the
structure, to compare with the experimental image.
</p>
<p>30.14 BONDING IN CRYSTALS

simulation concerns the fact that atoms are bonded in
different ways in different materials. The standard

</p>
<p>SIMULATING IMAGES OF A QUASICRYSTAL
As you realize, the problems in such an image calcu-
lation are increased because the quasicrystal does not
have translational symmetry but we must impose
such a symmetry to do the calculation.

<p>approach has been to use values for structure factors
tabulated by Doyle and Turner and by Doyle and Cow-
ley. These values were calculated using a relativistic
Hartree-Fock (RHF) model for the atomic potential.
An alternative approach is to relate the scattering factor
for electrons (fe) to that for X-rays (fx) using the Mott
equation, or to use a more sophisticated atomic poten-
tial known as the relativistic Hartree-Fock-Slater
(RHFS) model. Carlson et al. give tabulated results
while Tang and Dorignac have made detailed compar-
isons for HRTEM imaging.
</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Keeffe and Spence have re-examined the meaning
of the mean inner potential. One of the reasons that we
need to understand this concept is that we often link data
from X-ray diffraction and data from electron diffrac-
tion. As usual, computers are making it possible to do
more elaborate calculations using other potentials.
</p>
<p>While this is an evolving study, some important
results have been obtained
</p>
<p>&amp; The inner potential is very sensitive to bonding
effects. O&rsquo;Keeffe and Spence discuss this result for
MgO (large ionic component), Si (covalent), and Al
(metallic).
</p>
<p>&amp; We are still not able to take full account of bonding
effects, which could be important for HRTEM
images.
</p>
<p>This paper byO&rsquo;Keeffe and Spence is a highly recom-
mended reading for those who have a strong physics
background but think TEM is a &lsquo;known&rsquo; subject! For a
very different approach, see the paper byZuo and Spence
which uses theDP to deduce information about bonding.

<p>30.15 SIMULATING Z-CONTRAST
</p>
<p>This is a topic where you can make an impact! The clues
are in Chapters 2 and 3 and in the companion text.
</p>
<p>30.16 SOFTWARE FORPHASE-CONTRAST
HRTEM
</p>
<p>This is a short section because it is summarized in Table
30.1. HRTEMs are priced at up to $4 M as of 2009.
Image simulation is essential for HRTEM. Very few
students can, or should, write their own programs to
simulate HRTEM images&mdash;it has already been done
many times. The catch is that no manufacturer supports
any software package for simulating HRTEM images.
Your lab must have at least two programs for you to
use. In future wewill seemuchmore use ofMathematica
and Matlab in this field.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
If you are going to do HRTEM imaging, you must be prepared to use image simulation to
assist you in interpreting your images. If you want to do quantitative imaging, simulation is
an essential component of the process. Most materials scientists using TEMwill want to use
one of the established software packages in Table 30.1. There are several important
conclusions contained in this chapter
</p>
<p>&amp; Make sure that you know all you can about your specimen. We illustrated the dangers
with our discussion of grooved GBs. You can waste too much time looking at artifacts
caused by specimen preparation.
</p>
<p>&amp; Make sure that you know all you can about your TEM.You now have some idea of how
many parameters are required by the simulation routines. Beware of the parameters
which you did not measure for your machine. The program will need to use some value:
you should make sure it is appropriate.
</p>
<p>&amp; Make sure that you accurately align your TEM before you record any images.
&amp; If possible, use more than one program to simulate the images. At least try this once.
&amp; Record a through-focus series and check for changes in Df by repeating the first image.
&amp; The fact that the thickness of your specimen varies can be a great asset provided you can
determine that thickness; i.e., it gives you another variable.
</p>
<p>If you can afford a Cs-corrected HRTEM, then Cs becomes another variable.
The traditional method of using simulated images has often involved looking at a series
</p>
<p>of simulated images for different values of Df and t and finding the best match with your
experimental image. Clearly this is not the ideal approach! Remember that the interpreta-
tion of HRTEM images may not be straightforward or unique. We must next compare the
simulated images with those generated experimentally. This is the subject of the next
chapter and is the basis of quantitative HRTEM.

<p>Processing and Quantifying Images
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>In this chapter we will equate processing with the use of the computer to analyze our data.
We will simply use image processing to extract more information from the data than we can
obtain by eye. The data will generally be an HRTEM image but could be other images or
DPs. We&rsquo;ll quantify spectra after we describe them in Part 4 of this text. In the past, the
optical bench was also used for this purpose, but the number of optical benches is negligible
compared to the number of computers now found in every TEM lab. Optical benches did
allow us to form DPs which we could then modify to produce a processed image. This
analog approach has now largely been replaced by its digital counterpart. The computer can
be much cheaper than the optical bench and is far more flexible. The number of software
packages which are designed for, or can easily be adapted to, TEM is also growing.
</p>
<p>We can use image processing to produce a clearer view of the image, for example, by
subtracting unwanted background detail, correcting for noise or drift, or removing artifacts.
The big warning, though, is that, when removing one artifact, you must be very careful not
to introduce others.
</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s nice to see information more clearly, the unique feature of the computer
approach is that we can quantify the data in any image and then normalize these data. Now
we can directly compare the quantified experimental image with computer-simulated
images. Although throughout this chapter we will be concerned with HRTEM images,
most of what we say can be transferred directly to the analysis of diffraction-contrast
images.
</p>
<p>The other general point is that the ideas we&rsquo;ll discuss are also applicable to images
derived from different sources. Once the data are in the computer, i.e., in digital form, the
source becomes unimportant as far as processing possibilities are concerned. Examples of
&lsquo;images&rsquo; which might be obtained from the TEM include X-ray or EELS maps, STEM
images, TEM images, and CBED or BSE patterns.
</p>
<p>Most of the discussion will concern the use of computers. All you need to know is how
best to get the data into the computer, how to process it, what to do with the data, how to
display the result, and how to report what you&rsquo;ve done.Most importantly, whenwe have the
image in a numerical form we can start to consider statistics, which means much more than
adding &lsquo;error&rsquo; bars.
</p>
<p>31.1 WHAT IS IMAGE PROCESSING?
</p>
<p>Image processing is essentially manipulating images.
The topic arises in many fields so we need to understand
the words/jargon; we&rsquo;ll discuss the language of image
processing as it is applied to TEM.
</p>
<p>Image processing is not only becoming more com-
mon, but is also finding new applications in many
fields. Faster, more powerful computers and increased
memory storage are making tasks possible which
could not previously have been considered. As a
result of this increasing user base, there are now
</p>
<p>many software packages available which can be used
in microscopy; we listed some in Section 1.5. These
range from programs used widely in desktop publish-
ing to those which have been custom designed for
EM. The goals of image processing include that of
quantitative microscopy. You must choose among the
different packages, commercial and freeware, and
match them to the computer available in your lab.
One point to remember is that some very simple
optical methods which don&rsquo;t rely on a computer can
often be very helpful. The other point is that the eye
is hard to beat.
</p>
<p>31 .1 WHAT I S IMAGE PROCES S ING ? ...................................................................................................................................................... 549</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>There are many specialized books on this topic for
the beginner or the expert; a selection is given in the
references. The purpose of this chapter is to give a gen-
eralized overview. One problem in discussing this topic
is that it is a very rapidly changing field. We will try to
avoid specifics concerning particular programs but will
mention these programs at the end of this chapter.
</p>
<p>31.2 PROCESSING AND QUANTIFYING
IMAGES
</p>
<p>We process images primarily for two reasons
</p>
<p>&amp; We may want to improve the appearance of an
image, make it look sharper, more even in contrast,
higher contrast, etc. This processing can be unwise.
</p>
<p>&amp; Wemay want to quantify the information contained
in the image. This processing may be essential: many
physicists can read equations but not images.
</p>
<p>Processing for improving the appearance of TEM
images has been practiced for many years using such
photographic techniques as &lsquo;dodging,&rsquo; using &lsquo;filters,&rsquo;
selecting different emulsions or varying the developer,
etc. It is only recently that relatively powerful personal
computers have become widely available, but the term
&lsquo;image processing&rsquo; almost automatically implies the use
of computers. Computer image processing will be the
emphasis of our discussion. We have three requirements.
</p>
<p>&amp; Wemust be able to create a digital form of the image
in the computer.
</p>
<p>&amp; We need appropriate software for processing the
image.
</p>
<p>&amp; We need a computer which can perform the process-
ing in an acceptable period of time with the required
resolution.
</p>
<p>Many comments here are similar to those wemade in
discussing the microscope itself. For example, you may
have to work with the built-in system or the system
that&rsquo;s already available in the lab. The difference is
that some of the free programs are extremely powerful,
so that all you need is the desktop computer. Many
programs designed for desktop publishing are relatively
inexpensive. Thus, you can almost always find a way to
extend your processing capabilities.
</p>
<p>The motivation is that we need to obtain more infor-
mation from an image than we can get by just looking at
it. This principle applies to more than HRTEM; we are
discussing it here because HRTEM is where at present
it is most needed/used in TEM. However, any TEM,
X-ray map, or energy-filtered image or DP may benefit
from processing and quantification. We need to quan-
tify the TEM parameters, in particular Cs. One unique
aspect of image processing in the TEM is that we have a
choice between on-line and off-line processing. In fact,
we often use on-line processing (frame averaging and
background subtraction on the video image) to see the
image even though the image we record may not be
processed. However, it may indeed already be pro-
cessed&mdash;so you should know and report this.
</p>
<p>31.3 A CAUTIONARY NOTE
</p>
<p>Formost of our discussion we will consider only process-
ing techniques using computers. To a large extent we can
simulate a TEM using the computer. As we saw in Chap-
ter 30, we canmodel a crystal, insert apertures, define the
electron beam, including its broadening in the specimen,
and then calculate the image. What we do in image
processing is start with the image, add apertures and
special filters, and then create a new image, the processed
image. This image is a real image. What we must be
careful about is explaining just what processing proce-
dures we have used, since these may affect the interpreta-
tion of the data. Reporting the processing procedure is
particularly critical when the raw data (the &lsquo;original&rsquo;
image) is not being reported at the same time.
</p>
<p>31.4 IMAGE INPUT
</p>
<p>There are several methods you can use to put the TEM
image on the computer. The choice depends in part on
how much detail you want in your digitized image, but
also depends on how much work you&rsquo;re prepared to do.
In this discussion, we&rsquo;ll only consider images which you
have looked at on a video monitor, a computer display,
or the fluorescent screen. Your basic choices are
</p>
<p>&amp; Transfer the image directly from the TEM to the
computer.
</p>
<p>&amp; Record the image on film, then digitize it using a
microdensitometer.
</p>
<p>THE BASIC IDEA
Change images into numbers and manipulate the
numbers.
</p>
<p>THE DIFFICULTY
When image processing, the difficulty may be
describing what you have done.
</p>
<p>ALWAYS
Report how you have treated your image, so that the
reader can compare your data with related data that
may have been processed differently or not at all.
Be very careful. One honest (or dishonest) mistake
may change your career!
</p>
<p>550 ............................................................................................................................................... PROCESS ING AND QUANT IFY ING IMAGES</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Record the image on videotape.
&amp; Record the image on film, then print it and use a flat-
bed (or other) scanner.
</p>
<p>There aremanymethods for creating a digital form of
an image in your computer. The simplest is to use a slow-
scan CCD camera, which we discussed in Chapter 7. The
drawback of CCD cameras is that high-quality CCD
chips are very expensive for 2 k � 2 k arrays and astro-
nomically expensive for 4 k � 4 k arrays (but they are
getting cheaper). Such cameras may become routine add-
ons for all TEMs in the future. You will probably also
want to use video.With film, you can record a larger area
than you can using a CCD unless you have the 4 k � 4 k
version. You should use a digital video-recorder for in
situ studies when using a heating or straining holder.
</p>
<p>We can transfer the image from a videotape or a video
camera to the computer using a frame grabber. Frame-
grabber boards are readily available for most computers.
You can use a high-resolution scanner for photographs or
negatives. At this time, scanners cost about the same as a
digital camera with comparable resolution. The purist&rsquo;s
approach is to use a microdensitometer to measure the
intensity of the film point by point and read this directly
into the computer. The advantage of the microdensit-
ometer is that it is very precise and can achieve the highest
resolution for a very large area. The main problem is that
it is slow, being a serial-collection technique. If you use it
to its best advantage, your image will require a large
amount of computer memory, which in itself is not a
problem, but manipulating such images will still be slow.
</p>
<p>31.5 PROCESSING TECHNIQUES
</p>
<p>31.5.A Fourier Filtering and Reconstruction
</p>
<p>The principle involved in filtering is that a mask is used
to remove some information from an image in order to
enhance or emphasize other information. As an extra
complication we can process the image, e.g., Fourier
transform a HRTEM image, then apply a mask, and
then reverse the processing.
</p>
<p>We can vary the size of the apertures and the sharp-
ness of their edges, something you can&rsquo;t do in a TEM
with normal fixed-diameter objective apertures. A single
variable SAD aperture was used on some early TEMs; it
was triangular or square in shape and used three or two
movable blades. You can best understand the procedure
by an example. A square mask was used to select the
region in Figure 31.1A from a much larger region of
the HRTEM image, and its Fourier transform (i.e., the
DP effectively from a few nanometers) is shown in
Figure 31.1B.
</p>
<p>(A) (B)
</p>
<p>FIGURE 31.1. A square mask has been used to select the area shown in (A) from amuch larger print of the image. The Fourier transform of this region is
</p>
<p>shown in (B) where you can see not only the spots in the 110DP but also long streaks (artifacts of the processing) that run normal to the edges of themask.
</p>
<p>THE SUPPORT FILM IS IMPORTANT
You will often see similar diffractograms obtained
using a film of amorphous carbon. While such films
are easier to make, they give little diffracted intensity
for the range of u values between 6 and 8.5 nm&ndash;1,
which is important in HRTEM.
</p>
<p>31 .5 PROCES S ING TECHNIQUES ............................................................................................................................................................... 551</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>What this technique does is to allow you to do micro-
scopy in the computer. Your image becomes the speci-
men. You form the DP, then you can use apertures to
select one or more beams to form the image; these
apertures are the computer version of the objective
aperture. Small apertures limit resolution just as in the
&lsquo;real&rsquo; TEM because the information about anything
other than the perfect lattice is carried between the
reciprocal lattice points. Figure 31.2 gives an illustration
of how a model can be constructed of a particle in a
matrix, which can be useful when simulating HRTEM
and conventional BF/DF images in the computer, as
shown in Figure 31.3. This model was made using the
Digital Micrograph package (see Section 1.6).
</p>
<p>31.5.B Analyzing Diffractograms
</p>
<p>In Chapter 28 we showed that the transfer function
could be plotted out as shown schematically in, e.g.,
Figure 28.4. Another way of thinking about this plot is
to imagine what would happen if we have a specimen
which generated equally every possible value of u, i.e.,
every possible spatial frequency.
</p>
<p>An amorphous film of Ge can provide just such a
plot, but it is difficult to record the result because the
scattered intensity is low.
</p>

</p>
<p>matrix of NiO. The rest of the specimen could then be modeled by adding
</p>
<p>extra layers of NiO above or below the defect layer.

<p>such as that shown in Figure 31.2 is shown schematically in (A) together
</p>
<p>with the resulting lattice image. The other three pairs of diagrams
</p>
<p>illustrate how we can use the computer to produce different masks and
</p>
<p>thus generate different images, such as the DF image in (B). The image
</p>
<p>in (C) corresponds to the image shown in Figure 28.26, while the DF
</p>
<p>lattice image shown in (D) is analogous to that discussed in Figures 28.14
</p>
<p>and 28.15.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We therefore record the image at high resolution,
preferably directly, using a slow-scan CCD camera,
although digitizing the negative is fine. Then by com-
paring the experimental plot of I versus u with those
calculated for different values of Df and Cs we can
determine the astigmatism, the defocus, Df, and the
value of Cs (as we&rsquo;ll see below). It helps if you have a
few particles of Au on the Ge film since the Au spots
then give an internal calibration. Such a set of images
and their corresponding diffractograms is shown in
Figure 31.4. Notice that as the defocus of the objective
lens increases the number of rings increase but they
become narrower. The contrast transfer gradually
extends to larger values of u.
</p>
<p>Determining astigmatism. you can use such diffrac-
tograms to correct the astigmatism, since a perfectly
stigmated image will give a DP with circular symmetry.
As you can see in Figure 31.5, even a small amount of
astigmatism can be detected by eye. The computer can
readily measure and provide feedback to the TEM to
correct the lens defect, as we will see shortly. This set of
diffractograms also shows that the computer can distin-
guish astigmatism and drift in the image while the eye
can easily mistake one for the other. Drift produces a
circular pattern but the higher spatial frequencies are
lost in the direction of drift.
</p>
<p>Determining Df and Cs. You can determine Df for
any image by measuring the radii of the bright and
dark rings in the diffractogram, since bright rings
correspond to sin w(u) &frac14; 1 and dark rings correspond
to sin w(u) &frac14; 0.
</p>
<p>sinw u&eth; &THORN; &frac14; 1 when w u&eth; &THORN; &frac14; np

</p>
<p>and n is odd (31:1)
</p>
<p>sinw u&eth; &THORN; &frac14; 0 when w u&eth; &THORN; &frac14; np
2
</p>
<p>and n is even (31:2)
</p>
<p>SinceCswill also influence the location of the rings, you
need at least two rings. Krivanek has given a simple
procedure for finding both Cs and Df. If we start with
our definition of w
</p>
<p>w u&eth; &THORN; &frac14; pDflu2 &thorn; 1

pCsl
</p>
<p>3u4 (31:3)
</p>
<p>then, inserting the values given in equations 31.1 and
31.2 leads to
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>u2
&frac14; Csl3u2 &thorn; 2Dfl (31:4)
</p>
<p>All we now have to do is plot nu&ndash;2 versus u2 to obtain a
straight line with slopeCsl
</p>
<p>3 and with an intercept on the
nu&ndash;2 axis of 2Df l. Assign n&frac14; 1 to the intensity maxi-
mum of the central bright ring, n&frac14; 2 to the first dark
ring, etc. The analysis can be trickier if you have used an
underfocus condition or if you are very close to Scherzer
</p>
<p>defocus, but you will know when you have not found a
straight line! Hopefully, you&rsquo;ll find that your value ofCs
is close to that given by the manufacturer! A rather neat
result is that if you plot nu&ndash;2 versus u2 for different
diffractograms (i.e., different values of Df), then the
points corresponding to each particular value of n will
lie on a hyperbola, as shown in Figure 31.6A. You can
use these hyperbola to determine Cs for any microscope
and Df for any diffractogram.

<p>Diffractograms and beam tilt. Beam tilt is very diffi-
cult to correct by eye; even worse, it can cause the
diffractogram to look astigmatic, so you correct the
astigmatism instead. In the image, as we saw earlier,
beam tilt can improve the appearance but confuse the
interpretation! The set of diffractograms shown in
Figure 31.6B shows you how to overcome the problem.
You have to compare diffractograms taken at different
beam tilts to determine the zero-tilt condition. A pair
of diffractograms taken at �y8 tilt will only look the
same (though rotated) if the beam had zero tilt at
y&frac14; 08. In the example shown, the diffractograms
above and below the horizontal line are similar, so yy
was very close to zero for the central condition.
</p>
<p>However, the pairs of diffractograms on opposite
sides of the vertical axis differ slightly, so the alignment
of yx was not perfect.
</p>
<p>31.5.C Averaging Images and Other
Techniques
</p>
<p>If you have recorded a series of images using a video
camera, for example, you can average them over several
frames as your eye does automatically. The result of such a
process is illustrated in Figure 31.7. Different methods can
be used to average the images. The easiest approach
appears to be as good as any and simply involves taking
the unweighted average of your best images, i.e., in the
video example, just average over a series of frames. If you
know that the object you&rsquo;re studying has a certain sym-
metry, you can use that information to improve the image
further. The article by Trus et al. will give you a start on
this process. If you want to remove the blur due to motion
of the image, then you will really need to delve muchmore
into this subject.

<p>If you use a TV-rate video, you&rsquo;ll almost cer-
tainly use background subtraction routinely. For
example, you can record an image of the honeycomb
</p>
<p>pattern of the YAG detector, store it, and then
automatically subtract it from all subsequent images
in real time.
</p>
<p>Youmay find it useful to add artificial color (pseudo-
color) to your TEM images, as illustrated in Figure 31.8.
Although it is often assumed that this is done just tomake
the images even more appealing to the non-microscopist
(or non-scientist), there is actually a valid reason for the
practice. Our eyes are much more sensitive to small var-
iations in color than they are to small variations in gray
level. You might therefore find color useful if you have a
wide range of gray levels andwant the viewer to be able to
&lsquo;see&rsquo; some subtle variations. Similarly, you can use color
to emphasize a particular gray level in an image. How-
ever, you have to be very careful in your choice of look-
up table (LUT), the table which relates each gray level to
a particular color. To get a feel for the dangers, play with
PhotoshopTM and your favorite TEM image.
</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve already noted, in TEM, all of our apertures
have relatively sharp edges but in the computer, you
have the possibility of using multiple apertures, aper-
tures with different shapes and apertures with diffuse

<p>edges. Apertures with diffuse edges will help eliminate
the streaking which will otherwise be present (go back
and look at Figure 31.1). You can also use the computer
to do &lsquo;unsharpmasking,&rsquo; which is not the same as simply
using a diffuse mask. The technique comes from the
photographic process whereby we first print an image
out of focus onto film, thus making a complementary
image except where there is fine detail present in the
original image; in digital processing this is called Lapla-
cian filtering. Many more examples are given in Russ&rsquo;s
two books.
</p>
<p>31.5.D Kernels
</p>
<p>Akernel is simply an array of numbers which we can use
to perform operations on a digital image. If we have the
3 � 3 kernel, K (we can have 5 � 5, 7 � 7, etc., but the
computation time becomes too long, especially for real-
time situations)
</p>
<p>K &frac14;
�1 �1 �1
�1 &thorn;8 �1
�1 �1 �1
</p>
<p>Ko &frac14;
A B C
</p>
<p>D E F
</p>
<p>G H I
</p>
<p>we can apply it to every 3 � 3 group of pixels in our
image, e.g., Ko and put the result in a new digital image.
If we call our new 3 � 3 image, Ki then
</p>
<p>Ki &frac14;
A0 B0 C0
</p>
<p>D0 E0 F0
</p>
<p>G0 H0 I0
</p>
<p>The new image will have, for example, E0 = 8E -A -D -
G -B -H -C -F - I. This kernel then gives us a digital
Laplacian (an approximation to the second linear deriv-
ative, r2). What this kernel is doing is subtracting the
brightness value of each neighboring pixel from the
center pixel. If the area is a uniform gray it will become
white so changes in contrast will be exaggerated.We can
design a wide range of kernel operators. For example,
the edge enhancer kernel has the effect of digitally dif-
ferentiating the image. (We&rsquo;ll see a related digital-pro-
cessing procedure applied to spectra in Chapters 35 and
39.) The Sobel and Kirsch operators are examples of
such edge detectors; each can be thought of as the sum
of several kernel operators. We can also use binary
morphological operators which make binary features
become larger or smaller. All of these operations can
be carried out in any standard image-processing pack-
age. In general, you should be very careful when using
such techniques in TEM; their value is in displaying data
which might otherwise be missed, rather than helping
you quantify an image.
</p>
<p>31.6 APPLICATIONS
</p>
<p>This section will give you a taste of how image process-
ing is being used now. It is just part of a rapidly growing
list, so we are not going to be detailed or inclusive. We
can separate the applications into two groups
</p>
<p>&amp; Noise reduction or improving the signal/noise ratio.
&amp; Quantifying images.
</p>
<p>Of course, the first topic is included in the second.
</p>
<p>31.6.A Beam-Sensitive Materials
</p>
<p>Low-dose microscopy necessarily implies that the sig-
nal-to-noise ratio will not be large; if it is large, the dose
could have been smaller. This problem has been exten-
sively addressed in biological EM and led to Klug&rsquo;s
Nobel prize for &lsquo;Development of crystallographic elec-
tron microscopy and the structural elucidation of bio-
logically important nucleic acid&ndash;protein complexes&rsquo; in
1982 (see the 1971 paper by Erickson and Klug). In
materials science, we have tended to accept &lsquo;beam
damage&rsquo; as a fact of life, but this attitude will not be
acceptable for future quantitative HRTEM.Most mod-
ern microscopes will allow you to perform all your
</p>
<p>REPORT IT
We&rsquo;ve said it before. Check HREM papers in the
literature. Have the images been processed? Are you
told how? Can you reproduce the &lsquo;experiment&rsquo;? The
last test is the essential component of science.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>alignments on one area and then translate the beam to a
predetermined distance in a predetermined direction
before recording the image of a pristine area. Clearly,
the CCD camera will not only let you see your image
without waiting to develop the plates, but you can take a
series of images for noise reduction purposes and/or
assess whether the imaging conditions were what you
had intended. (Sometimes, by taking a chronological
sequence of images you can get a sense of the &lsquo;undam-
aged&rsquo; image by extrapolating information back to zero
time). The image shown in Figure 31.9 illustrates the
possibilities. If you read the review by van Heel et al.,
you will get some idea of how far you can already go in
this field.
</p>
<p>31.6.B Periodic Images
</p>
<p>In discussing quantitative analysis, we have already
noted how we can use the computer to identify similar
features and combine them in order to reduce the noise.
This technique has many possible variations. Again
biological applications are leading the way with 3D
crystallographic reconstruction, as illustrated byDown-
ing and by Dorset and even correcting for distortions in
the specimen, as shown by Saxton et al.
</p>
<p>31.6.C Correcting Drift
</p>
<p>Although drift is not as limiting on newmachines, many
older TEMs are still in use. Drift can be corrected now if
the rate and direction of movement are constant. The
computer can calculate the relative translation of two
images and change the current in the image translation
coils appropriately (which avoidsmoving the specimen).
The difficulty is that the drift may not be linear. When
implemented, such routines are already particularly
valuable for frame averaging using a video camera.
There will also be many applications for diffraction-
contrast imaging as well as for X-ray or EELS analysis.
</p>
<p>31.6.D Reconstructing the Phase
</p>
<p>Although we are studying phase contrast, the image
intensity doesn&rsquo;t directly give us phase information.
Kirkland et al. showed as early as 1982 that the phase
can be reconstructed by processing a defocus series. In
their approach they use an iterative non-linear image-
processing technique to reconstruct the complex
</p>
<p>electron-transmission function. The technique was
demonstrated using images of CuCl16PC (hexadeca-
chlorophthalocyanine copper).
</p>
<p>Five images from the experimental defocus series are
shown in Figure 31.10A&ndash;E, together with the recon-
structed transmission function plotted both as a real
and imaginary part and then as an amplitude and
phase part in Figure 31.10F&ndash;I. The projected structure
of the known unit cell is also shown in Figure 31.10J.
The phase image contains most of the structural infor-
mation: it corresponds to the projected potential while
the amplitude image contains features due to inelastic
scattering. Notice in particular that we can now identify
the benzene ring. This is one of the earliest published
examples of the full-phase reconstructions. You must
record such a series of defocus images if you want to do
quantitative HRTEM. The companion text includes an
extensive chapter giving details and an overview of how
the process is practiced today.
</p>
<p>BEAM DAMAGE
The electron beam will invariably change your speci-
men. Historically, we have worried about beam
damage. Beam healing is just as bad for your image
interpretation!
</p>
<p>FIGURE 31.9. The image is from a highly beam-sensitive solution of
</p>
<p>surfactants in water. The solution has been frozen by plunging a film
</p>
<p>into liquid ethane and then transferring it to the TEM. The large circles
</p>
<p>are the surfactants that have aggregated to form vesicles; the concentra-
</p>
<p>tion of the surfactants in the solution is just right for them to form
</p>
<p>lamellar structures (the circles seen flat on). Texture starts to appear in
</p>
<p>the image as soon as the beam interacts with the specimen due to crystal-
</p>
<p>line ice formation and/or beam damage.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>31.6.E Diffraction Patterns
</p>
<p>Wehave generally ignored the intensities inDPs because
they are so strongly influenced by dynamical scattering.
However, if the specimen is very thin, we can use the
intensity in the SADP to carry out electron crystallog-
raphy in the same way as in classic X-ray crystal-
lography. As you can appreciate from Figure 31.11,
particularly if the unit cell is large and the specimen
examined is thin there is a great deal of information in
the SADP but you can&rsquo;t get it all in one exposure.
Hovmöller&rsquo;s group (see, e.g., Zou and the ELDprogram
in Section 1.5) has provided a routine for analyzing such
patterns and getting structure-factor information. For
example
</p>
<p>&amp; Several patterns are recorded using exposure times
of 0.5 s to &gt;15 s.
</p>
<p>&amp; The patterns are digitized directly from the negatives
using a CCD camera and a light-box for backlighting.
</p>
<p>&amp; The intensity of each film is calibrated using a cali-
bration strip with 20 equal exposure steps.
</p>
<p>&amp; The intensity is measured for all the spots and the
processing begins.
</p>
<p>Thus far it is just like the classic analysis of XRD
intensities. This digitization process is particularly
</p>
<p>FIGURE 31.11. SADPs fromK2O �7Nb2O5 recorded using two different
</p>
<p>exposures. More than one exposure is needed to get all the information in

reflections correspond to spacing of 0.13 nm.

<p>demanding, because each reflection typically covers an
area of &lt;0.5mm diameter on the photographic film. You
will need to be able to index three strong, but clear, reflec-
tions. The computer can then perform a series of functions
</p>
<p>&amp; Optimize the location of these points using a center-
of-gravity approach, locate the origin, and index the
rest of the pattern.
</p>
<p>&amp; Extract the intensities of each peak, taking care not
to be misled by any shape effects of the specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use reflections which are present on two successive
negatives (since the intensities are now in digital
form) to calibrate films recorded with different expo-
sures and thus develop a very large dynamic range.
</p>
<p>A cooled slow-scan CCD camera will give you a large
dynamic range and better linearity than its room-tem-
perature counterpart and should simplify this type of
analysis. There are other complications in using electrons
rather thanX-rays for this kind of crystallography.While
the Ewald sphere is still curved, as with X-rays, electrons
can easily damage your specimen. However, the tech-
nique clearly has potential! Like all TEM techniques it
can be applied to much smaller regions of the specimen
than is possible for X-ray beams. We can also use the
symmetry present in the SADPs. Because the specimen is
very thin, this technique could be described as &lsquo;kinemati-
cal&rsquo; crystallography and complements the &lsquo;dynamical&rsquo;
electron crystallography that we described for CBED
patterns from thicker specimens in Chapter 21. The pro-
cess of extracting intensities fromDPs can now be carried
out using the ELD software package (Section 1.5).
</p>
<p>If we can use the quantitative information available
in DPs, we could combine this information with our
experimental and simulated HRTEM images. The
quantitative analysis of the DP is known as structure-
factor-modulus restoration or reconstruction (Tang
et al.). One limitation of this approach is that the speci-
men be sufficiently thin that diffraction is kinematical.
Of course, this requirement is necessarily similar to the
HRTEM requirement of the WPOA.
</p>
<p>31.6.F Tilted-Beam Series
</p>
<p>Having gone to great trouble to remove any beam tilt,
we will mention how beam tilt can be used to extend the
resolution of your microscope! The basic idea goes back
to the tilted-beam lattice-fringe imaging we discussed in
Section 23.3. Now you use a computer to combine
information in different tilted-beam images. The
method proposed by Kirkland et al. assumes that you
know when the beam tilt is zero. You tilt the beam
through different angles in well-defined directions so
that you transfer information in overlapping regions
of reciprocal space, as shown in Figure 31.12A; you
also need the on-axis image, as shown in the tableau in
</p>
<p>USING THE DP
The structure deduced from the HRTEM approach
should generate the experimental SADP so it should
be possible to use these diffraction data to further
refine the structure.

<p>Figure 31.12B. Since it is important that the same area is
imaged, a sixth (on-axis) image is recorded and corre-
lated with the first (on-axis) image to check for drift and
specimen degradation. You now need to restore the
modulus and phase to create a higher-resolution image.
</p>
<p>Kirkland&rsquo;s paper is a beautiful demonstration of the
care needed in image processing. Even aligning the
images is not trivial. However, the resulting restoration
shown in Figure 31.13, demonstrates the potential of the
technique: detail is present in the image at a resolution
of 0.123 nm using a 400-kV microscope.
</p>
<p>31.7 AUTOMATED ALIGNMENT
</p>
<p>In the not-too-distant future, all TEMs will have auto-
matic beam alignment, astigmatism correction, and
readout for Df. What makes this possible is the diffrac-
togram analysis, a slow-scanCCD camera to digitize the
image, and computer control of all the microscope func-
tions. By microscope functions, we mean all lens cur-
rents, deflector currents, specimen drive, and aperture
drives. The slow-scan camera is needed because the
computer needs to make measurements on more than
one ring in the diffractogram. So you will not actually
have to sit in front of the microscope once you have
loaded the specimen.
</p>
<p>Autoalignment is now available to everyone with a
digital camera and the plug-in for Digital Micrograph
(see Section 1.6). The early developments are summar-
ized in the references. Your role is to select a suitable
region of the specimen close to the area of interest; the
area that you are interested in should ideally only be
examined at low magnification. You will make the
initial alignment manually and then ideally turn the
process over to the computer. The computer will then
adjust the astigmatism and correct the beam tilt inde-
pendently and quickly.
</p>
<p>Figure 31.14 shows how well and quickly this proce-
dure can now be done. The different diffractograms in
each tableau correspond to incremental changes in the
beam tilt of 6mrad in the x and y directions. The com-
puter showed that the initial tilt error was 4mrad, which

<p>successfully transferred to the image. For such thin specimens, atom-
</p>
<p>dense positions have a reduced modulus [black in (A)] and an increased
</p>
<p>phase [white in (B)].
</p>
<p>THE ADVANTAGE OF REMOTE TEM
The big advantage in remote control will not be that
you can sit in Huntsville and operate a microscope in
California but that you can locate the microscope in
its controlled environment with no one opening the
door to check if it is working (it was) or entering the
room and thus changing the heat-load. If your speci-
men is not ideal or the TEM breaks down, you won&rsquo;t
have to go for a walk on the beach in California but
can continue word processing in Alabama.
</p>

<p>was reduced to 0.4mrad after one pass and &lt;0.1mrad
after the second pass. Each pass took only 28 s! The
astigmatism shown in Figure 31.15 was initially 53 nm.
It was reduced to 3 nm after one pass and to&lt;1 nm after
the second pass. For this correction, each pass took only
8 s. Even the most experienced operator can&rsquo;t match this
speed or accuracy for either correction, and both correc-
tions are now quantitative.
</p>
<p>The defocus value is then found by calibrating the
image with minimum contrast occurring at DfMC. The
value of DfSch can then be found when the image con-
trast is a maximum. Although the method described
here uses the diffractogram, a corresponding approach
can be followed by analyzing variations in the contrast
of the image. This technique has been described by
Saxton et al. and uses a method of cross-correlating
</p>
<p>pairs of images recorded at each focus setting of the
microscope. The reason for cross-correlating images is
to remove the effects of electron shot noise; variations
due to the photographic emulsion are avoided by using
the slow-scan camera.

<p>&amp; Measuring the fit
&amp; Quantitative comparison of simulation and experiment
&amp; Fourier techniques
</p>
<p>Our discussion will draw heavily on the work of a
few pioneers in this field; we will also emphasize that,
although this subject is still in its infancy, it is developing
rapidly. The main cause for the delay in its application
in materials science has been the lack of affordable fast
computers and the feeling that everyonemust write their
own image-processing program; the latter is not true
and is certainly not recommended. At this time, we can
summarize the situation as follows
</p>
<p>&amp; Quantitative analysis is difficult, often tedious, and
invariably time consuming.
</p>
<p>&amp; Youmust understand the basic ideas of image theory
before you start processing images.
</p>
<p>&amp; Your analysis is only as good as your image and your
image is only as good as your specimen.
</p>
<p>We gave some information on software in Section
1.6 and expand on this in Section 31.16.
</p>
<p>31.9 PATTERN RECOGNITION IN HRTEM
</p>
<p>The most obvious feature of most HRTEM images is
that we see patterns of white, gray, and black dots or
other shapes. If the pattern is perfect everywhere, your
specimen is probably a single crystal with no defects, no
thickness variations, no variation in atomic composi-
tion, and no use. If it is not perfect, then we can use
pattern recognition to quantify the variations.
</p>
<p>Clearly you need a computer for this! Your template
needs to match the magnification and rotation of the
pattern you are examining. Then you need a method to
say how close your match is, i.e., you need to know your
&lsquo;goodness of fit.&rsquo; We will go through some basics here,
but strongly recommend that you consult the list of
original papers given at the end of this chapter when
you are ready to apply this technique.
</p>
<p>We can illustrate the approach following Paciornik
et al. The large rectangle shown in Figure 31.16 repre-
sents your digitized image and could be 1 k � 1 k;
remember the numbers indicate pixels. The small rec-
tangle represents your template. This template might be
a small area of the pattern or a simulated image, in
which case it might be a 128 � 128 pixel template. If
the template is taken from your image, then you have

<p>PATTERN RECOGNITION
The idea is to take/make a template, move it across
your image, and measure how closely the image
resembles your template.

image of a small region of a S=5 tilt boundary in TiO2.
The two small boxed regions appear only at the boundary
and are selected as templates. The matching process has
thenbeencarriedoutand thenew image is shown inFigure
31.17B. Having found all the regions which match the
template, we could then take the average of these to pro-
duce low-noise images of the GB templates. The final step
is thecomparisonof these templateswithmodelsof theGB
structure. There are two important points to remember
</p>
<p>&amp; When you average images, you implicitly assume that
all the images are the same except for random noise.
</p>
<p>&amp; Don&rsquo;t forget our discussion in Chapter 30 of inter-
face grooving and the problems associated with
interfacial segregation.
</p>
<p>31.10 PARAMETERIZING THE IMAGE
USING QUANTITEM
</p>
<p>In general, the thickness or chemistry will vary as you
cross the specimen, i.e., the projected potential varies
across the specimen. This means that one template will
only match a small area, so you have to use many
templates. These templates could, in principle, be totally
empirical, but to be quantitative we must derive them
from image simulations. This approach has been
described for two special cases in papers by Kisielowski
et al. and Ourmazd et al.
</p>
<p>31.10.A The Example of a Specimen with
Uniform Composition
</p>
<p>In QUANTITEM, the results of Chapter 30 are sum-
marized by a general equation linking the intensity and
all the imaging (Si) and materials (P) parameters
</p>
<p>I x; y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; F P x; y&eth; &THORN;;Si&eth; &THORN; (31:5)
</p>
<p>This equation just tells us that the intensity depends on
the imaging conditions and on the specimen. For a
particular set of imaging conditions, Si will be known
(more or less) and we&rsquo;ll call it Si
</p>
<p>0. Then we can write that
</p>
<p>I x; y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; F P x; y&eth; &THORN;;S 0i
� �
</p>
<p>&frac14; F 0 P x; y&eth; &THORN;&eth; &THORN; (31:6)
</p>
<p>The basis of this approach is quite straightforward,
potentially powerful but almost never used
</p>
<p>&amp; Define the function F0 for each image that you may
obtain.
</p>
<p>&amp; Then construct a set of templates for your matching
process.
</p>
<p>Providing you stay within one extinction band, F 0
</p>
<p>will be directly related to the projected potential of the
specimen. A helpful simple analogy for this process is
illustrated in Figure 31.18. The function F 0 describes
the path of a swinging pendulum as it varies with time
(Figure 31.18A). Each value of F 0 corresponds to a
snapshot of the pendulum, so if you plot F 0 you can
&lsquo;see&rsquo; the path of the pendulum (Figure 31.18B). The
velocity of the pendulum is related to the density of
points along the path. So it should be possible to plot
out the function F0 from a single lattice image even if
you don&rsquo;t know the microscope parameters used to
form the image.
</p>
<p>Yes, there are limitations and conditions and we&rsquo;ll
discuss them later. All we need now is a method for
representing each image by a snapshot of the pendulum:
we have to parameterize the image. This process is the
key to the technique. Manipulating and quantifying, in
principle, thousands of images, each requiring 4 Mbyte
of memory is not a fast process, even if you do have that
much memory. If we could characterize each image by a
few numbers (a vector or parameter) the comparison
process could be much faster.
</p>
<p>We separate the image into unit cells and digitized
these to give many templates which are n pixels by m
pixels, as shown here for one cell (Figure 31.18C&ndash;F). If
we defineN to be n�m, then we haveN numbers for the
N pixels, where each number represents a gray level.
Now the N numbers are regarded as the N components
of an N-dimensional vector. (The math is not compli-
cated but don&rsquo;t try to visualize this vector.) So now all
the information in each unit cell is represented by a
vector in N-dimensional space. The function F0
</p>
<p>describes how these N-dimensional vectors (the path)
change as the projected potential changes.
</p>
<p>The next step is to define a reference frame for these
vectors. Three basis vectors are derived from the
experimental image. Ourmazd et al. argue that three
basis vectors will be sufficient, as we can show in the
</p>

to quantify EBSD patterns from the SEM.

<p>following way. We will be using a low-index zone axis
for any HRTEM analysis. Then we have three types of
images
</p>
<p>&amp; The background, RB, due to the direct beam, O.
&amp; A single-period image, RS, due to the interference
between O and the strongest reflections, Gi.
</p>
<p>&amp; A double-period image, RD, due to the interference
between these strong Gi reflections.
</p>
<p>Each of these R terms is a vector which represents an
image. Any image we can form must be a combination
of these three types of image, so a general image, G, can
be written as

basis vectors
</p>
<p>RG &frac14; aGRT1 &thorn; bGRT2 &thorn; gGRT3 (31:9)
</p>
<p>which is what we wanted to show.
Ourmazd et al. point out that this treatment gives
</p>
<p>three important results
</p>
<p>&amp; The vector notation allows us to parameterize the
lattice image.
</p>
<p>&amp; Projecting the vectors onto planes and/or paths aids
noise reduction.
</p>
<p>&amp; Any noise which remains can be quantified.
</p>
<p>The result of vector-parameterizing an experimental
image of a wedge-shaped specimen of Si is shown by the
three images corresponding to R1, R2, and R3 in Figure
31.18F.
</p>
<p>31.10.B Calibrating the Path of R
</p>
<p>In order to relate any image to the projected potential,
we have to calibrate the curve showing the path of RG.
This is where the image simulation comes in. We start
with the vector-parameterized analysis of the series of
simulated images from the Si wedge. Each point on the
curve corresponds to an image of the unit cell, and thus
to a vector RG. The ellipse has been fitted empirically,
and the thickness of the cell has been increased by
0.38 nm for successive calculations. The points are clos-
er together in some parts of the plot because, as we saw
in Chapter 30, some characteristic images appear for a
wider range of thicknesses. Now we have a way to
quantify this &lsquo;experimental&rsquo; observation. What the
ellipse does is to allow us to parameterize the path in
terms of the phase angle of the ellipse fe, shown by the
ellipse in Figure 31.18F. Thinking back to the pendulum
analogy, the path parameters are the image version of
the coordinates for the harmonic oscillator.
</p>
<p>Now the parameters of the curve (fe) can be
obtained from a series of images. We can vary the
material and in each case examine three other variables
</p>
<p>&amp; The orientation of the specimen (i.e., the zone axis).
&amp; The defocus, Df, of the objective lens.
&amp; The specimen thickness.
</p>
<p>The remarkable result is that when we plot je versus
the thickness, normalized by the extinction distance, we
obtain a straight line. The explanation for this result is
related to the fact that only a small number of Bloch
waves usually contribute to the image, as we saw in
Section 30.6. In materials such as YBCO, this is not
the case, and the curve is not a straight line.
</p>
<p>This analysis gives more detail than most students
will ever need, but it introduces a concept that could
(should) bemore widely recognized: the power of param-
eterizing the image.
</p>
<p>31.10.C Noise Analysis
</p>
<p>Noise in the image moves the vector off the ellipse; so,
we have a method for analyzing the noise. If the noise
moves the vector exactly along the ellipse, we can&rsquo;t
analyze the noise, but that is quite unlikely since the
noise would then be accurately mimicking a change in
projected potential. So this parameterization gives a
way to reduce the noise by a factor of
</p>
<p>p
N which for a
</p>
<p>10 pixel � 10 pixel cell is a factor of 10!
The analysis given by Ourmazd et al. then shows
</p>
<p>that, in the case where only two Bloch waves are excited,
the image intensity, I, can be expressed as
</p>
<p>I &frac14; B&thorn; S&thorn;D (31:10)
</p>
<p>where B, S, and D are the contributions from the back-
ground, single interaction, and double interaction as we
defined them above. The point (B, S, D) does indeed
describe an ellipse which lies on a plane independent of
Df.
</p>
<p>The value of this approach can be appreciated if you
look at the examples shown in Figure 31.19. In the first
example (Figure 31.19A and B), the technique has been
used to provide amap of the roughness of the Si surface.
The experimental image looks really uniform until you
analyze it using this method, when you can discern the
roughness at the 0.5-nm level; remember that there are
two surfaces.
</p>
<p>As you know from earlier discussions, changes in
chemistry produce effects which are similar to changes
in thickness, because they change the projected poten-
tial. In terms of the present analysis, the effects are
different: composition changes cause changes in the
ellipse and in x (notice that there is no subscript, since
this x is a many-beam value).
</p>
<p>The method is more limited, in this respect, to
change in composition but can be used if the thickness
and roughness are known, i.e., if you can measure the
roughness elsewhere on your specimen (using a known
reference cell) and infer it for the area you want to
analyze. (Warning lights should be flashing.) The
approach is as follows

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Use QUANTITEM to measure the advance in fe at
your target cell relative to your reference cell.
</p>
<p>&amp; Subtract Dfe, which is due to a thickness change.
&amp; Then the rest of the change in fe must be due to
changes in x. If you know how x varies for different
compositions, you have determined the local
composition.
</p>
<p>The second example shown in Figure 31.19C and D
is a near-perfect application for the technique, since the
elements in the alloy GexSi1&ndash;x are randomly located on
the lattice sites. The slope tells us how abruptly the
composition varies.
</p>
<p>The third example in Figure 31.19E and F shows
that the potential resolution is superb (we can see the
quantum dots) but beam tilt can cause 10% errors in
thickness measurement. The conclusion is clear: as
always, you only get the best results if your specimen is
ideal and both the microscope and the specimen are
perfectly aligned. Note, however, that the technique
has not yet been successfully applied to a wide range of
materials, but it is complementary in many ways to
STEM Z-contrast (see Figure 22.15).
</p>
<p>31.11 QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL
LATTICE IMAGING
</p>
<p>This technique is an instructive tool but is perhaps less
necessary now that STEM is commonly available. The
technique has not been widely used since the software
was not readily available.
</p>
<p>This technique uses the approach described in
Section 30.4, but can only be applied to materials
where we have chemically sensitive reflections, which
we discussed in Section 16.4. We used these reflections
in Section 29.4 to produce chemically sensitive DF
images. In HRTEM, the chemically sensitive reflec-
tions not only contribute to the overall image but they
will generally have a different dependence on thickness,
too.
</p>
<p>This effect is shown in Figure 31.20A&ndash;D for AlAs
and GaAs, which have identical structures: the 002
reflection is allowed for both, but is stronger for AlAs
since F, the structure factor, is proportional to fIII&ndash;fV.
You can see that, under the conditions chosen for this
comparison, the intensity of the 022 reflections is also
</p>
<p>very different for the different thicknesses. The sort of
image we can analyze with this approach is illustrated
here by the quantum wire. We want to know how
abruptly the composition changes at the interface. In
this example, the ideal GaAs and Al0.4Ga0.6As unit-cell
images are first characterized by the two vectors, RGaAs
and RAlGaAs, following the approach described in Sec-
tion 31.10. In this case the cells were simulated, divided
into 30 � 30 pixel arrays (so N&frac14; 900), and then R
was plotted. The information content is contained in
yC. As before, we can directly assess the noise in such
an image. So how is the direction of R dependent on
composition?
</p>
<p>The technique is explained using the three known
simulated templates (GaAs, AlGaAs, and AlAs); each
one produces a vector Rt. Although the vector for the
intermediate composition does not lie in the plane, it can
be projected onto this plane to give a unique vector for
certain ranges of thickness. Since this is a complex pro-
cedure, you&rsquo;ll find the &lsquo;image flow chart&rsquo; shown in
Figure 31.21 helpful.
</p>
<p>&amp; The experimental image is first digitized; the image
contained approximately 25� 25 unit cells and used
a 514 � 480 frame buffer.
</p>
<p>&amp; Next, the image must be separated into individual
cells.
</p>
<p>&amp; The pair of templates shown is then used to calculate
the angular positions of the R vectors for all the unit
cells. Such templates can be calculated or taken from
known areas of the specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; These R vectors are characterized in terms of where
they cut through a plane (D) (see Figure 31.21D
also).
</p>
<p>The maximum chemical difference determines how
far apart the two principal distributions can be (see
Figure 31.21E). Since the image is now fully parameter-
ized we can do the statistics and finally invert the angu-
lar data to give the compositions.
</p>
<p>This technique has enormous potential, but you
must also remember that it is susceptible to all the draw-
backs inherent in HRTEM. The advance is that now
you can put numbers on those effects. The technique is
material-specific, but if you know your material, you
can combine image simulation and this processing
method to examine what will be the limiting factors for
your material. You can construct a test image like that
shown in Figure 31.19E. If your specimen is ideal, you
could, in principle, easily detect a column of Al in a
mainly GaAs matrix without any &lsquo;spreading&rsquo; due to
the electron beam and in this respect alone makes
QUANTITEM better than atomic-resolution X-ray
mapping and equivalent to atomic-column EELS (see
Part 4). This technique could be applied to other
materials.
</p>
<p>NOISE
You can test the potential resolution of the tech-
nique, its sensitivity to the alignment of the beam,
bending of specimen, and beam divergence in the
usual way by creating model structures, simulating
the images, and then analyzing them.

<p>31.12 METHODS OF MEASURING FIT
</p>
<p>There are two methods presently used to obtain a
measurement of how well the data and the model match.
In statistics, we determine this &lsquo;goodness of fit&rsquo; using cross
correlation or a least-squares refinement (Section 31.13).
</p>
<p>In this section we&rsquo;ll use the cross-correlation method
to compare an n � m pixel template (see Section 31.9)
with every possible n � m rectangle in the image. The
computer moves the template across the image one
pixel column at a time, then shifts down one pixel
row, and repeats the exercise. The cross-correlation
function (CCF) gives the goodness of fit or a &lsquo;measure
of similarity&rsquo; between the template and each n � m
image

<p>Now we can plot the CCF as a map of our image and
then examine it to deduce where there is a particularly
good match. Since the CCF value varies from 0 to 1, we
can plot out the number of times each particular CCF
value occurs, as illustrated in Figure 31.22. The two
peaks in this curve correspond to the best fit and the
worst fit, so the distance between them gives a measure
of the &lsquo;discrimination signal.&rsquo; From the width of the
peaks we have a measure of the noise and hence a
signal-to-noise ratio. The regions of good fit can be
combined to produce a better template, and the process
repeated, giving the dashed line. A second measure of
the noise is then given by how far the good peak differs
from unity. A particularly nice feature of this approach
is that the procedure is available as a plug-in module for
Digital Micrograph (see Section 1.6). The template
could alternatively be a simulated image and the process
repeated for a series of different thicknesses and/or
defocus values. When you want to learn more about
correlation techniques, see the article by Frank.
</p>
<p>31.13 QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON
OF SIMULATED AND EXPERIMENTAL
HRTEM IMAGES
</p>
<p>If we want to compare simulated and experiment images
quantitatively, we really should modify our usual
approaches to both simulation and experiment (King
and Campbell 1993 and 1994). When doing the simula-
tion, most programs automatically adjust the gray scale
for each image so that darkest is 1 and brightest is 0 (or
vice versa). This means that two simulated images might
appear similar even though you would hardly see the
pattern in one if both appeared on the same negative. In
a similar way, we usually print an image to be as clear as
possible using the full range contrast of the photo-
graphic paper.
</p>
<p>We need methods for normalizing these procedures
if we want to make quantitative comparisons. The solu-
tion for the simulation is simple. For the experimental-
ist, it means recording extra data while you&rsquo;re at the
microscope. After recording the image, you record
another image with the specimen removed. You then
use this image to scale the lattice image such that you
correct for variations in intensity across the field of view
and the non-linearity of the response from the photo-
graphic film. Figure 31.23 illustrates the experimental
transmittance for Kodak SO-163 film, 400-keV elec-
trons, plotted against the digital value on a CCD
array. Of course, you must process both images at the
same time. This is called the &lsquo;flat-field&rsquo; correction; a
slow-scan CCD camera would simplify this procedure
at the cost of reducing the area you examine.

<p>may risk several exposures using this technique. You are
now comparing numbers, so you can use a least-squares
fit where the residual fi(x) is defined as
</p>
<p>fi x&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
f obsi � f calci x&eth; &THORN;

</p>
<p>Wi
(31:13)
</p>
<p>and your task is to minimize fi(x). The difference
between the intensity in the experimentally observed
ith pixel and its calculated value will be zero if every-
thing has been scaled correctly, the imaging conditions
(Df, Cs, etc.) are correct, and you have the right
structure.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say Wi is the image which represents the error
bars for pixel i. Then we can write that
</p>

</p>
<p>(31:14)
</p>
<p>This equation defines the non-linear least-squares prob-
lem. We use x to summarize a set of parameters (Df, Cs,
the model, etc.); N is the number of pixels in the image.
Fortunately, this analysis is now routine statistics.
You&rsquo;ll need a computer program to tell you how good
the first guess was, make an improvement and continue
until it meets our specific criterion for matching. [King
and Campbell used MINIPACK-1. (See articles by
Moré et al.)]
</p>
<p>In their demonstrations of this approach to analyze a
[001] tilt GB in Nb, King and Campbell varied four
parameters: thickness, defocus, x-tilt, and y-tilt. The
steps were as follows
</p>
<p>&amp; They first optimized the electron-optical parameters
using a 64 � 64 pixel image, giving N=4096 and
an image computational cell of 3.303 nm by
3.303 nm. Using the EMS program (Section 1.6),
the optimization took 20 iterations and 80 multislice
calculations.
</p>
<p>&amp; Next they had to optimize the structure of the GB.
This process required defining 84 atomic positions in
a unit cell of 4.16 nm � 1.04 nm and a 512 � 128
(=65,536) pixel image. Now the optimization
required 16 iterations and 1300 multislice
calculations.
</p>
<p>These numbers are instructive. First they tell you
that this computation can be done, which wasn&rsquo;t
obvious. Second they tell you that this is a computer-
intensive process; that we could have guessed!
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to take enormous care in this type of
analysis
</p>
<p>&amp; Align the simulated cell with the experimental cell
and measure the unit cell in pixels.
</p>
<p>&amp; Choose a number of cells and relate them by the
translation vector parallel to the rows of the image
array.
</p>
<p>&amp; Calculate the standard-deviation images.
&amp; Rotate the unit cell and repeat the exercise several
times.
</p>
<p>The orientation which gives the smallest standard
deviation is your alignment. You must now adjust the
magnification of the experimental image to fit the simu-
lation, in a similar way to what you did for rotation.
Next, you have to match the origins of both cells; the
procedure is the same as we just described but translat-
ing the unit cell not rotating it. For a bicrystal, you now
repeat this exercise for the other grain and then for the
GB. You can improve the fit further if you take account
of a constant background contribution, which probably
arises due to the amorphous layer on both surfaces.
Comparing experimental and calculated images quanti-
tatively, we define fi
</p>
<p>obs as the corresponding value in the
simulated image. We then calculate the residual fi(x) as
follows
</p>
<p>fi x&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
f obsi � f calci x&eth; &THORN; &thorn; bfit
</p>
<p>� �� �
</p>
<p>Wi
(31:15)
</p>
<p>where bfit is included as a free parameter in the optimi-
zation procedure. King and Campbell&rsquo;s calculations
showed that Wi could be expressed as
</p>
<p>Wi &frac14; sobsi &thorn; 0:05f obsi (31:16)
</p>
<p>where si
obs is the standard deviation of the ith pixel.
</p>
<p>Examples of the experimental, best fit, and normalized
residuals are shown in Figure 31.24 for images from a
S=5, (310), [001] GB in Nb.
</p>
<p>31.14 A FOURIER TECHNIQUE
FOR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
</p>
<p>Möbus et al. proposed using what is referred to as an
adaptive Fourier-filtering technique. The HRTEM
image is digitized in the usual manner and then a special
spatial-frequency filter is applied. This type of mask is
designed for analyzing regions which contain defects.
</p>
<p>HRTEM AND LOW DOSES
Don&rsquo;t forget that sinceHRTEMuses higher voltages,
the perfect image will only be recorded from an area
of the specimen that has only seen the beamwhile you
recorded the image! So you should always use low-
dose techniques for quantitative imaging (but others
don&rsquo;t).
</p>
<p>31 .14 A FOUR IER TECHNIQUE FOR QUANT ITAT IVE ANALYS I S ...................................................................................................... 571</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>So the idea is that the computer automatically opti-
mizes the mask to maximize the separation of the signal
and the noise. This approach has not been widely prac-
ticed in TEM but clearly holds enormous promise. By
varying themask, this approach can prevent the analysis
of a defect layer being dominated by the bulk informa-
tion. Since the approach is quite straightforward signal
processing, we will just illustrate an example found in
the analysis of a simulated S=5 GB with an extra
period along the boundary. To test the analysis, white
noise was added to a calculated image to give the image
shown in Figure 31.25A. The power spectrum (the com-
puter-generated DP) of the micrograph is shown in
Figure 31.25B. The adaptive filter and the filtered
</p>
<p>image are shown in Figure 31.25C and D. The impor-
tant feature of the adaptive filter in this example is that it
was created as such because the computer detected the
doubling of the periodicity which is only present in the
GB. Second the mask consists of elongated openings
which we knowwe need when analyzing the GB because
of the shape effect that we discussed when analyzing
DPs (see Chapter 17).
</p>
<p>31.15 REAL OR RECIPROCAL SPACE?
</p>
<p>In principle, we could equally well compare two images
in reciprocal space rather than real space. However,
because the Fourier transforms can generally be carried
out much faster, the real-space approach has several
advantages
</p>
<p>&amp; Fourier analysis separates local information into
sine and cosine functions which are delocalized.
When we reassemble the real-space image, higher
parts of the frequency spectrum will be lost which
will degrade the resolution.
</p>
<p>&amp; We want to maintain information on the absolute
value of the intensities.
</p>
<p>&amp; Real-space methods are visually more intuitive for
most of us. We can easily see what we have removed
in the process.
</p>
<p>&amp; The real-space approach allows us to choose any
values of n and m in defining our templates. Fourier
space prefers aspect ratios given by 2n.

<p>31.16 SOFTWARE
</p>
<p>Several software packages are widely used by the
TEM community and have been listed in Section
1.6. We summarize the ones we know in Table
31.1. In its earliest application, image processing in
TEM was almost exclusively applied to HRTEM
images. This is no longer the case. Remember:
always start with the best possible data. You can&rsquo;t
always obtain a perfect image because your specimen
might be beam sensitive, or coated with oxide, and
you need to be aware of these limitations when
processing or quantifying the image. This chapter
has given you a hint of what is possible and where
the subject is developing. We recommend that you
obtain the software and start experimenting.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we have discussed several different
techniques used for processing TEM images. Different
software is suitable for processing different types of
image. The problem is that there may not be sufficient
financial benefit unless a package supports another prod-
uct; a similar problem was found for simulation soft-
ware in Chapter 30. Many programs have been written
</p>
<p>to run on particular computer systems and support can
disappear even though the TEM has a lifetime of 15+
years.
</p>
<p>31.17 THE OPTICAL BENCH&mdash;A LITTLE
HISTORY
</p>
<p>Although not widely used now, the optical bench is a
useful instructional tool but you need to be old fashioned
and record the image on film! A typical experimental set-
up is shown in Figure 31.26. The laser provides a coherent
source of illumination representing the electron beam. The
negative acts as the specimen. If it contains a set of lattice
fringes, these act as a diffraction grating and give rise to a
rowof spots on the screen placed at the back focal plane of
the &lsquo;objective&rsquo; lens. The lens is thus performing an optical
Fourier transform of the photograph. If you &lsquo;move the
screen&rsquo; to the image plane, the fringes reappear. You can
make different masks and place them at the back focal
plane or even create an &lsquo;adaptive filter&rsquo; by exposing a
photographic film and using this as the template for your
mask. Thesemasks correspond to the objective aperture in
TEM. Students will find it instructive to transform their
instructor or another suitable photograph, examine the
frequency spectrum, and investigate the resulting spatial
effect of different masks. The detail in the image is quickly
lost as you remove the high spatial frequencies. This cor-
responds to inserting a smaller aperture in the back focal
plane of the objective lens, as illustrated inFigure 31.27. So
Figure 31.27D is effectively a BF image: clearly, you dis-
card a lot of information in such images!

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
Wehave been doing image processing formany years; it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;dodging&rsquo; in the photographic
darkroom. You can even do this automatically with a special commercial enlarger. However,
we have done very little quantitative imaging in materials science and even less in nanotech-
nology. The points you should remember when starting in the field are the following
</p>
<p>&amp; Quantitative comparison of simulated and experimental images depends on both the
simulation program and the experimental parameters.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you are going to use reciprocal-space techniques for quantitative analysis, you should
consider the shape of the optimum mask; it may not be a circular mask especially if you
are studying interfaces! The process can, in principle, be assisted by the computer.
</p>
<p>&amp; The potential for image restoration is no longer limited by how the signals are mixed due
to Cs and Df. You can unscramble those effects if you have the right equipment.
</p>
<p>&amp; You will notice the repeated use of the word &lsquo;potential&rsquo; where we don&rsquo;t mean V(r)! In
manyways this chapter is a guide to the future ofHRTEMandTEM in general. Some of
the features won&rsquo;t be commonly available or optimized until the manufacturers realize
their importance to the user and the user realizes that stability (for example) costs
money.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, the resolution limit is set by the signal-to-noise ratio in your image.
</p>
<p>When you are processing images, there is always the possibility of removing information
which is important. For example, Fresnel fringes often should be there! Beware of making
reality match simulation, rather than the reverse. In the same vein, we draw your attention
to the conclusion of Hÿtch and Stobbs, who found that they could only match their
experimental and simulated images if they used a value for the specimen thickness which
they knew was wrong! Their study emphasizes that, wherever possible, you should obtain
independent measurements of the characteristics of your specimen and your machine.
Remember the double-headed rhino in Figure 1.7; don&rsquo;t publish artifacts, even well-pro-
cessed ones. Even if it&rsquo;s just for entertainment, images can reappear in unexpected places.
Remember that an early image of Si dumbbells was later interpreted correctly because the
authors gave the necessary data on how the image was formed when they published it. You
should always do likewise.

</p>
<p>usually modify these data in some way before it is reported to the scientific community. The question you
</p>
<p>must always keep in mind is howmuch detail on the processing must you report so that other scientists will
</p>
<p>be able to check and repeat your analysis.

<p>X-ray Spectrometry
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>To make use of the X-rays generated when the beam strikes the specimen, we have to detect
them and identify from which element they originated. This is accomplished by X-ray
spectrometry, which is one way to transform the TEM into a far more powerful instrument,
called an analytical electron microscope (AEM). Currently, the only commercial spectrom-
eter that we use on the TEM is anX-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer (XEDS), which uses
a Si semiconductor detector or sometimes a Ge detector. New detector technologies are
emerging, which we&rsquo;ll describe briefly. While some of these may render the Si detector
obsolete, we&rsquo;ll nevertheless emphasize this particular detector.
</p>
<p>The XEDS is a sophisticated instrument that utilizes the fast processing speeds made
possible by modern semiconductors. The detector generates voltage pulses that are propor-
tional to the X-ray energy. Electronic processing of the pulses translates the X-ray energy
into a signal in a specific channel in a computer-controlled storage system. The counts in the
energy channels are then displayed as a spectrum or, more usefully, transformed into a
quantitative compositional profile or, better still, a compositional image or &lsquo;map.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>The Si detector is compact enough to fit in the confined region of the TEM stage and, in
one form or another, is sensitive enough to detect all the elements above Li in the periodic
table. We&rsquo;ll start with the basic physics you need to understand how the detectors work and
give you a brief overview of the processing electronics. We then describe a few simple tests
you can perform to confirm that your XEDS is working correctly and the choices you have
to make due to the way the XEDS is interfaced to the AEM column.
</p>
<p>It is really most important from a practical point of view that you know the limitations of
your XEDS and understand the spectrum. Therefore, we&rsquo;ll describe these limitations in detail,
especially the unavoidable artifacts (Chapter 33). In Chapter 34, we&rsquo;ll show how the spectra
can easily give a qualitative elemental analysis of any chosen feature in your image and, in just
a little more time (Chapter 35), a full quantitative analysis. In Chapter 36, we&rsquo;ll show that this
information can be obtained with a spatial resolution approaching a nanometer or below
and offers detection limits close to a single atom. So &lsquo;microanalysis&rsquo; is not a good term;
&lsquo;nanoanalysis&rsquo; is more accurate but sounds worse. &lsquo;Analysis&rsquo; is how we&rsquo;ll describe it.
</p>
<p>32.1 X-RAY ANALYSIS: WHY BOTHER?
</p>
<p>The limitations of only using TEM imaging should, by
now, be obvious to you. Our eyes are accustomed to the
interpretation of 3D, reflected-light images. However,
as we have seen in great detail in Part 3, the TEM gives
2D projected images of thin 3D specimens and you, the
operator, need substantial experience to interpret these
images correctly. For example, Figure 32.1 shows six
images, taken with light and electron microscopes (can
</p>
<p>you distinguish which images are from which kind of
microscope?). The scale of the images varies over 6
orders of magnitude from nanometers to millimeters
and yet they all appear similar. Without any prior
knowledge it would not be possible, even for an experi-
enced microscopist, to identify the nature of these speci-
mens simply from the images.
</p>
<p>Now if you look at Figure 32.2, you can see six X-ray
spectra, one from each of the specimens in Figure 32.1.
The spectra are plots of X-ray counts (imprecisely
</p>
<p>COUNTS
We&rsquo;ll see over and over again that maximizing the number of X-ray counts is paramount.

<p>termed &lsquo;intensity&rsquo;) versus X-ray energy and basically
consist of Gaussian-shaped peaks on a slowly changing
background. FromChapter 4 you already know that the
peaks are characteristic of the elements in the specimen
and the background is also called the bremsstrahlung.
</p>
<p>But even with no knowledge of XEDS, you can easily
see that each specimen gives a different spectrum.
</p>
<p>Different characteristic peaks mean different elemen-
tal constituents; it is possible to obtain this information in
a matter of minutes or even seconds.

<p>When you have such elemental information, any
subsequent image and/or diffraction analysis is greatly
facilitated. For your interest, the identity of each speci-
men is given in the caption to Figure 32.2. While
Figure 32.2A&ndash;E is from common inorganic materials,
Figure 32.2F is from a cauliflower which, once you get it
</p>
<p>into the electron microscope, provides a very distinctive
spectrum, albeit from a somewhat carbonized relic of
the original vegetable. The familiar morphology of this
specimen, now obvious in Figure 32.1F, also accounts
for the generic term &lsquo;cauliflower structure&rsquo; which is
given to these and similar microstructures.

<p>The main message you should get from this illustra-
tion is that the combination of imaging and spectro-
scopy transforms a TEM into the much more powerful
AEM.
</p>
<p>32.2 BASIC OPERATIONAL MODE
</p>
<p>To produce spectra such as those in Figure 32.2, you first
obtain a TEM or STEM image of the area you wish to
analyze. In TEM mode, you then have to condense the
beam to an appropriate size for analysis. This means
exciting the C1 lens more strongly, decreasing the C2
aperture size and adjusting the C2 lens strength. These
steps will misalign the illumination system and it can be
tedious to move between TEM-image and focused-spot
analysis modes, unless you are driving a fully computer-
controlled (S)TEM. So, we recommend that you operate
in STEM mode. First, create your STEM image as we
described back in Section 9.4. Then simply stop the
scanning probe and position it on the feature you wish
to analyze and switch on the XEDS. In STEM mode,
digital software can also check for specimen drift during
your analysis.
</p>
<p>In this &lsquo;spot&rsquo; mode you can simply move the beam
around the specimen and get a sense of the elemental
chemistry of different features you select. However, this
approach is very limited from a statistical sampling
standpoint and highly biased toward what you think
looks interesting in the image. It is now feasible to
gather not merely a spectrum from a feature in your
specimen, as in Figure 32.2, but a spectrum at every pixel
in a digital STEM image. From such &lsquo;spectrum images&rsquo;
we can extract maps showing the distribution of each
element in the specimen and its relationship to the fea-
tures in the electron image, thus adding another dimen-
sion (literally) to the power of the AEM (go back and
check the X-ray map in Figure 1.4). We&rsquo;ll talk more
about this in Chapter 33 and discuss both qualitative
and quantitative maps in Chapters 34 and 35.
</p>
<p>For reasons that we&rsquo;ll describe in detail later, you
should always perform XEDS with your specimen in a
low-background (Be) holder. Unless you have an UHV
AEM, the holder should be cooled to liquid-N2 tempera-
ture to minimize contamination, and we recommend a
double-tilt version, so you can simultaneously carry out
diffraction and/or imaging along with your analysis.
</p>
<p>32.3 THE ENERGY-DISPERSIVE
SPECTROMETER
</p>
<p>The XEDS was developed in the late 1960s and by the
mid-1970s was an option on many TEMs and even more
widespread on the SEM. This rapid spread testifies to the
fact that the XEDS is really quite a remarkable instru-
ment, embodying many of the most advanced features of
semiconductor technology. It is compact, stable, robust,
easy to use, and you can quickly interpret the readout.
Several books have been devoted to XEDS on electron-
beam instruments and these are listed in the general
references. Figure 32.3A shows a schematic diagram of
the complete XEDS system and we&rsquo;ll deal with each of
the major components as we go through this chapter.
</p>
<p>The computer controls all three parts. First, it con-
trols whether the detector is on or off. Ideally, we only
want to process one incomingX-ray photon at one time.
So the detector is switched off when an X-ray photon is
detected and switched on again after that signal is pro-
cessed (notice we use the particle description of anX-ray
here; other detectors work in ways that assume the
X-ray is a wave). Second, the computer controls the
processing electronics, assigning the signal to the correct
energy channel in the storage system. Third, the com-
puter calibrates the spectrum display and tells you the
conditions under which you acquired the spectrum, the
peak identity, the number of X-rays in a specific channel
</p>
<p>STEM MODE
Use STEM for AEM. It makes it easier to change
from image to analysis mode, easy to form composi-
tional images, and easier to compensate for drift.

<p>or &lsquo;window&rsquo; of several channels, etc. Any subsequent
data processing is also carried out using the computer.
</p>
<p>We can summarize the working of the XEDS as
follows
</p>
<p>&amp; The detector generates a charge pulse proportional
to the X-ray energy.
</p>
<p>&amp; This pulse is first converted to a voltage.
&amp; The voltage is amplified through a field-effect tran-
sistor (FET), isolated from other pulses, further
amplified, then identified electronically as resulting
from an X-ray of specific energy.
</p>
<p>&amp; A digitized signal is stored in the channel assigned to
that energy in the computer display.
</p>
<p>The speed of this process is such that the spectrum
appears to be generated in parallel with the full range of
X-ray energies detected simultaneously, but the process
actually involves very rapid serial processing of individ-
ual X-ray signals. Thus, the XEDS both detects X-rays
and separates (disperses) them into a spectrum accord-
ing to their energy; hence the name of the spectrometer.
</p>
<p>Figure 32.3B shows an XEDS interfaced to an AEM.
In fact, you can&rsquo;t see the processing electronics, the dis-
play, or even the detector itself because it sits close to the
specimenwithin the column.The only feature that you can
see is the dewar containing liquid-N2 to cool the detector
and even this is disappearing from the latest detectors.
</p>
<p>32.4 SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTORS
</p>
<p>The Si detector in an XEDS is a reverse-biased p-i-n
diode and since this is still, by far, the most common
detector, we will take this as our model. Later in this
section we&rsquo;ll discuss the role of other semiconductor
detectors, such as intrinsic-Ge (IG) and Si-drift detec-
tors (SDDs).
</p>
<p>32.4.A How Does an XEDS Work?
</p>
<p>While you don&rsquo;t need to know precisely how the detec-
tor works in order to use it, a basic understanding will
help you optimize your system and it will also become
obvious why certain experimental procedures and pre-
cautions are necessary.
</p>
<p>When X-rays deposit energy in a semiconductor,
electrons are transferred from the valence band to the
</p>
<p>conduction band, creating electron-hole pairs, as we saw
back in Section 4.4. The energy required for this transfer
in Si is�3.8 eV at liquid-N2 temperature. (This energy is
a statistical quantity, so don&rsquo;t try to link it directly to the
band gap.) Since characteristic X-rays typically have
energies well above 1 keV, thousands of electron-hole
pairs can be generated by a single X-ray. The number of
electrons or holes created is directly proportional to the
energy of the X-ray photon. Even though all the X-ray
energy is not, in fact, converted to electron-hole pairs,
enough are created for us to collect sufficient signal to
distinguish most elements in the periodic table, with
good statistical precision. Figure 32.4 is a schematic

<p>diagram of a Si detector and it is similar to the semicon-
ductor electron detectors we discussed back in Chapter 7.
</p>
<p>Electron detectors separate the electrons and holes
by an internal reverse bias across a very narrow p-n
junction, but we need a much thicker detector for
X-rays to generate electron-hole pairs since X-rays
penetrate matter much more easily than electrons.
</p>
<p>Even the purest commercial Si contains acceptor
impurities and exhibits p-type behavior. So we compen-
sate for the impurities, which would aid recombination
of electron-hole pairs by &lsquo;filling&rsquo; any recombination sites
with Li, thus creating intrinsic Si in which the electrons
and holes can be separated. Henceforth, we&rsquo;ll refer to
Si(Li) (often pronounced &lsquo;&lsquo;silly&rsquo;&rsquo;) detectors.
</p>
<p>The thousands of electrons and holes generated by
an X-ray still constitute a very small charge pulse
(�10&ndash;16 C), and so we apply a 0.5&ndash;1 keV bias between
evaporated Au or Ni ohmic contacts to separate most of
the charge. The metal film on the front face creates a p-
type region and the back of the crystal is doped to
produce n-type Si under a thicker rear contact. So the
whole crystal is now a p-i-n device, with shallow junc-
tions on either side of an intrinsic region.
</p>
<p>When a reverse bias is applied (i.e., a negative charge
is placed on the p-type region and a positive charge on
the n-type), the electrons and holes are separated and an
electron pulse can be measured at the rear contact.
</p>
<p>In the p and n regions at either end of the
detector, the Li compensation is not completely
effective. These regions are effectively unresponsive
to the X-ray because most of the electron-hole pairs
recombine, and don&rsquo;t contribute to the pulse. These
so-called &lsquo;dead layers&rsquo; are an inevitable result of the
fabrication process and reduce the detector effi-
ciency. In practice, it is the p-type dead layer at
the entrance surface that is most important since
the X-rays must traverse it to be detected and we
will refer to this as the dead layer.
</p>
<p>The dead layer has become thinner as the detector
technology has improved and its effects on the spectrum
continue to be reduced (although not to zero, as we
shall see).
</p>
<p>32.4.B Cool Detectors
</p>
<p>Why do we have to cool the detector? Well, if the
detector were at room temperature, three highly unde-
sirable effects would occur
</p>
<p>&amp; Thermal energy would activate electron-hole pairs,
giving a noise level that would swamp the X-ray
signals we want to detect.
</p>
<p>&amp; The Li atoms would diffuse under the bias, destroy-
ing the intrinsic nature of the detector.
</p>
<p>&amp; The noise level in the FET would mask signals from
low-energy X-rays.
</p>
<p>So the detector and the FET are usually cooled
with liquid N2, hence the characteristic dewar shown
in Figure 32.3B. The weight of the dewar and the need
for constant filling with liquid N2 are major draw-
backs. While the majority of XEDS systems on
AEMs still use liquid-N2 cooled Si(Li) detectors, alter-
natives are available, such as compact dewars (which
use much less N2), cryo-cooling, compressor-based
devices which attain liquid-N2 temperature mechani-
cally, non-compressive technologies and Peltier-cooled
systems, which cool sufficiently (and very rapidly) to
deliver reasonable energy resolution with fewer prob-
lems. Liquid-N2 cooling has other drawbacks. Resid-
ual hydrocarbons and water vapor in the column form
carbon contamination or ice films on the cold detector
surface, causing absorption of low-energy X-rays.
There are obvious solutions to this problem. We can
either isolate the detector from the vacuum, or remove
hydrocarbons and water vapor from the column. The
latter is a more desirable solution but the former is far
easier and much less expensive.
</p>
<p>32.4.C Different Kinds of Windows
</p>
<p>Liquid-N2 cooled detectors are usually isolated from the
AEM stage in a pre-pumped tube with a sealed &lsquo;window&rsquo;
which allows most X-rays through into the detector.
There are three kinds of detector; those with a Be win-
dow, those with an ultra-thin window and those without
a protective window.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the pros and cons of each window; a
good review has been given by Lund.
</p>
<p>Beryllium-window detectors use a thin Be sheet. The
best foil is �7 mm which is transparent to most X-rays,
and can withstand atmospheric pressure when the stage
</p>
<p>THE ENERGY OF A PULSE
Remember that the magnitude of the charge pulse is
proportional to the energy of the X-ray that gener-
ated the electron-hole pairs.
</p>
<p>DEAD ACTIVE
The p and n regions are called &lsquo;dead layers&rsquo;; the
intrinsic region between them is referred to as the
&lsquo;active layer.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>THE XEDS DEWAR
The cylinder hanging on the side of the AEM is the
dewar holding liquid N2 that quietly boils away.
</p>
<p>586 ................................................................................................................................................................................X-RAY SPECTROMETRY</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is vented to air. But 7 mm Be is expensive (�$3 M/
pound!), rare, and slightly porous, so a thicker sheet
(�12&ndash;25 mm) is more commonly used. Rolling such a
thin Be sheet is a remarkable metallurgical achievement
but it still absorbs X-rays with energies &lt; �1 keV.
Therefore, we cannot detect Ka X-rays from elements
below about Na (Z=11) in the periodic table, prevent-
ing analysis of B, C, N, and O, which are important in
the materials, biological, and geological sciences. Other
factors such as the low fluorescence yield and increased
absorption within the specimen make light-element
X-ray analysis somewhat of a challenge, and EELS is
often preferable (see Chapters 38 and 39).
</p>
<p>Ultra-thin window (UTW) detectors use &lt;100 nm
polymer films, diamond, boron nitride, or silicon
nitride, all of which can withstand atmospheric pressure
while transmitting 192-eV boron K X-rays and the best
UTW windows can even analyze Be K X-rays (110 eV).
Early polymer UTWs would break if you accidentally
vented the column to air without withdrawing the detec-
tor and window behind a valve. This problem was over-
come by strengthening the polymers with Al films and
this accounts for the term &lsquo;atmospheric thin window&rsquo;
(ATW)which youmay hear. You should remember that
different window materials absorb light-element X-rays
differently, so you need to know the characteristics of
your window. For example, carbon-containing win-
dows absorb nitrogen KaX-rays very strongly, nitrogen
absorbs oxygen, etc.
</p>
<p>Windowless detectors only make sense in UHV
AEMs such as old VG instruments and Nion dedicated
STEMs which minimize hydrocarbons and keep the
partial pressure of water vapor by operating with a
stage vacuum &lt; �10&ndash;8 Pa. Windowless systems rou-
tinely detect Be K X-rays as shown in Figure 32.5,
which is a remarkable feat of electronics technology.
</p>
<p>The relative performance of the various windows is
summarized in Figure 32.6. Here we plot the detector
efficiency as a function of X-ray energy. You can clearly
see the rapid drop in efficiency at low energies and the
improved performance of windowless/UTW systems. In
fact, Si(Li) detectors absorb (i.e., detect) X-rays with
almost 100% efficiency over the range from �2 to
20 keV, as shown in Figure 32.7. Within this range are
X-rays from all the elements in the periodic table above
P. This uniform high efficiency is a major advantage of
the XEDS detector. Table 32.1 is a concise summary of
the pros and cons of each kind of window.
</p>
<p>32.4.D Intrinsic-Germanium Detectors
</p>
<p>You can also see in Figure 32.7 that Si(Li) detectors
show a drop in efficiency &gt;�20 keV. This is because
such high-energy X-rays can pass through the detec-
tor without creating electron-hole pairs. This effect
limits the use of Si(Li) in 300&ndash;400 keV AEMS in
</p>
<p>KLM TIME
Remind yourself now of the energies involved for
K, L, and M for different elements.

Si, so a Be Ka X-ray will create at most�29 electron-
hole pairs, giving a charge pulse of �5�10&ndash;18 C!

<p>which we can generate Ka X-rays from all the high-Z
elements, e.g., 75 keV Pb Ka X-rays are easily
formed at 300 keV. As we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 35,
there are advantages to using the K lines for quanti-
fication rather than the lower-energy L or M lines
and with a Si(Li) detector, the K lines from elements
above Ag (Z=47) are barely detectable. One possible
solution is to use an intrinsic Ge (IG) detector which
more strongly absorbs high-energy X-rays, as
detailed by Sareen.
</p>
<p>We can manufacture Ge of higher purity than Si and
such Ge is inherently intrinsic, so, Li compensation is
not necessary. IGs are more robust and can be warmed
up repeatedly which, as we&rsquo;ll see, can solve certain
detector problems.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the intrinsic region can easily be
made �5 mm thick, giving 100% detection of Pb Ka
</p>
<p>X-rays. Figure 32.7 compares the efficiency of Si(Li)
and IG detectors up to 100 keV. There is an even more
fundamental advantage to IG detectors. Since it takes
only �2.9 eV to create an electron-hole pair in Ge,
compared with 3.8 eV in Si, a given X-ray produces
more electron-hole pairs in Ge, and so the energy reso-
lution and signal to noise are better. The only draw-
back is that the ionization cross sections for high-
energy K X-ray excitations are very small for
300&ndash;400 keV electrons, so the peak intensities are
low. So, why aren&rsquo;t we all using IG detectors? Well,
there&rsquo;s no good technical answer but the facts that
Si(Li) detectors are easier to manufacture and have a
long history of dependable operation are sound com-
mercial reasons why IG detectors have never seriously
penetrated the market.
</p>
<p>32.4.E. Silicon-Drift Detectors
</p>
<p>Si-drift detectors (SDD) may eventually displace tradi-
tional Si(Li) detectors; although relatively new, they are
already the detector of choice in the much larger SEM
and XRF markets. The SDD is basically a CCD (go
back and look at Figure 7.3) consisting of concentric
rings of p-doped Si implanted on a single crystal of n-Si
across which a high voltage is applied to pick up the
electrons generated as X-rays enter the side opposite the
p-doped rings (Figure 32.8A&ndash;C). Applying a voltage
from inside to outside the detector (rather than front
to back as in a Si(Li)) permits collection of the electrons
generated in the n-Si with a 4� lower voltage. Because
the central anode in the middle of the p-doped rings has
a much smaller capacitance than the large anode at the
rear face of a Si(Li) detector (Figure 32.3A&ndash;C), a very
high throughput of counts is possible, peaking at output
rates of many hundred of kcps (Figure 32.8D and look
ahead to Figure 32.12B)). If we could in fact generate
such enormous count rates in an AEM, we could reduce
quantification errors (see Chapter 35), increase analyti-
cal sensitivity (see Chapter 36), and seriously improve
the statistics of X-raymapping (see Chapters 33 and 35).
In addition to a high throughput, the SDD can operate
with no cooling or minimal thermoelectric (Peltier)
cooling, while maintaining energy resolutions competi-
tive with Si(Li) detectors (see Section 32.8). This is
possible because modern Si-processing technology has
reduced thermal-electron generation to extremely low
values.

The intense doses of high-energy electrons or X-rays
which can easily be generated in an AEM (e.g., when
the beam hits a grid bar) can destroy the Li compen-
sation in a Si(Li) detector, but there is no such pro-
blem in an IG crystal.

<p>The only problem here is that, as we discuss at length
throughout the subsequent chapters, the use of small
probes and thin specimens means that total X-ray count
rates in AEMs are usually small, negating a principal
advantage of SDDs. However, all is not lost and with
the advent of intermediate-voltage FEGs and, more
recently, Cs correctors, we can create electron probes
of &lt; 0.2 nm with&gt; 1 nA of current. If you are prepared
to sacrifice spatial resolution by increasing the size of
the probe-limiting aperture, then several nA can be
generated in probes of a few nm. If you are prepared
to sacrifice spatial resolution still further by using
thicker specimens, then it is easy to reach the current
signal-processing limits (see next section) of Si(Li) elec-
tronics (&gt;50 kcps), in which case SDDs might become
attractive alternatives. But the jury is still out.
</p>
<p>Because an SDD is made up of arrays of individual
cells, each one like Figure 32.8A, it is also feasible to
consider designing specially shaped SDDs that con-
form to the inside of the AEM stage. Thus, we could
increase the collection angle well beyond typical flat
Si(Li) collection angles of a few tens of mrads, and
overcome the count-rate limitation (see Section
32.9.A). Count rates are, of course, no problem in
SEM-based, bulk-specimen, X-ray microanalysis,
which explains the rapid increase of SDDs on those
instruments. If you want to learn more, Newbury gives
a thorough analysis of the pros and cons of SDDs for
mapping in the SEM.

<p>32.5 DETECTORS WITH HIGH-ENERGY
RESOLUTION
</p>
<p>The poor energy resolution (typically �135�10 eV) is a
fundamental limitation of any of the semiconductor
detectors. This limitation arises because, as we discuss
in Section 32.7, the detection and processing steps are
statistical processes. This poor resolution gives rise to
significant peak overlaps (see Section 34.4) and funda-
mentally limits the sensitivity (detection limits) of ana-
lyses (see Section 36.4). However, there are X-ray
spectrometers available with significantly better resolu-
tion than EDS (&lt;1&ndash;10 eV), which may provide better
options in the future, so it is worth noting these poten-
tial technologies.

<p>spacing which (see Part 2) disperse X-rays of wave-
length (l) through different angles (y) according to
Bragg&rsquo;s law (nl= 2d sin y). So a WDS treats electrons
as waves and this gives considerable advantages over
XEDS
</p>
<p>&amp; Better energy resolution (�5&ndash;10 eV) to minimize
peak overlaps.
</p>
<p>&amp; Higher peak to background (P/B) ratio to improve
detection limits.
</p>
<p>&amp; Better detection of light elements (minimum Z = 4,
Be) by careful choice of analyzing crystal rather than
solely through a dependence upon electronics, as in
the XEDS.
</p>
<p>&amp; No artifacts in the spectrum from the detection and
signal processing, except for higher-order lines from
fundamental reflections (when n � 2 in the Bragg
equation).
</p>
<p>&amp; Higher throughput count rate using a gas-flow pro-
portional counter.
</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we have WDS systems on our AEMs?
Well, as you&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 35, the forerunner of the
AEM, back in the 1960s and early 1970s, was the
electron microscope micro-analyzer (EMMA), which
did indeed use WDS. However, the WDS was a large
and inefficient addition to the TEM, and never
attained general acceptance by TEM users for two
reasons
</p>
<p>&amp; The crystal has to be moved to a precise angle where
it collects a tiny fraction of the X-rays from the
specimen, whereas the XEDS detector subtends a
relatively large solid angle.
</p>
<p>&amp; The WDS collects a single l at any time while the
XEDS detects X-rays over a large range of energies.
WDS is a very slow, serial collector; XEDS is a fast,
effectively parallel, collector.
</p>
<p>The geometrical advantage of XEDS (remember, we
need to maximize X-ray counts) combined with rapid
detection over a wide energy range, without themechan-
ical motion of the WDS, accounts for the dominance of
Si(Li) XEDS systems in all AEMs. Two alternative
approaches to overcoming the poor energy resolution
of XEDS are being explored. One is a development of
the traditional WDS and the other is a totally new
approach to X-ray detection.
</p>
<p>32.6.B CCD-Based WDS
</p>
<p>In an attempt to detect ultra-soft (i.e., very low energy)
X-rays, Terauchi and Kawana have designed a WDS
using an aberration-corrected, concave, diffraction
grating (instead of the usual bent crystal) with a CCD
detector in place of the proportional counter. The
</p>
<p>detector is much more compact than a standard WDS,
as shown in Figure 32.9A and B, and delivers an energy
resolution of 0.6 eV, which is 200� better than a typical
EDS resolution and sufficient to resolve intensity varia-
tions in the characteristic peaks that arise due to changes
in the density of states (DOS) of the valence band (see
Figure 32.9C). Study of the DOS and related bonding
effects is usually the role of EELS (see Chapter 40), so
CCD-WDS is a real breakthrough for X-ray spectrom-
etry. The energy resolution would improve further if
the CCD pixel size were decreased, and the grating
dispersion increased. Unfortunately, the count rate is
very low and to get the spectra shown in Figure 32.9C, a
probe size of �1 mm was used. A larger CCD would
permit smaller probes and these will become available
via digital-camera technology. Also, recent develop-
ments in capillary optics may increase the WDS collec-
tion angle, so the technology is worth watching.
</p>
<p>32.6.C Bolometers/Microcalorimeters
</p>
<p>A totally different approach to detecting X-rays is to
measure the heat emitted when an X-ray is absorbed.
At first sight this might appear ridiculous, but the

<p>concept has been demonstrated (Wollman et al.) by
creating a microcalorimeter or bolometer (i.e., a
sensitive thermometer). As with WDS, the bolometer
is limited by its small area, so the solid angle is
small and the count rate correspondingly low, but it
delivers a resolution comparable with WDS (�5&ndash;10 eV),
</p>
<p>while offering the effectively parallel-collection
aspects of XEDS (see Figure 32.9D). Bolometers
have been installed on SEMs where their small area
is offset by the large count rate. Despite initial enthu-
siasm, bolometers are not commercially available
because they have to be cooled to a few mK with
liquid He, which increases the cost close to that of a
new SEM and their size to the point where attaching
one to a TEM is a major mechanical-engineering feat.
The technology to create bolometer arrays is avail-
able but until compact, large collection angle WDS or
cheap bolometer systems are available, we&rsquo;ll have to
live with the poor resolution and other limitations of
Si(Li) detectors, to which we&rsquo;ll devote the rest of the
chapter.
</p>
<p>Table 32.2 below summarizes much of the preceding
and following discussion.
</p>
<p>32.7 TURNING X-RAYS INTO SPECTRA
</p>
<p>The electronics attached to a Si(Li) or SDD convert the
charge pulse created by the incoming X-ray into a vol-
tage pulse, which is stored in the appropriate energy
channel of the computer display (which used to be called
a multi-channel analyzer or MCA). The pulse-proces-
sing electronics must maintain good energy resolution
across the spectrum without peak shift or distortion,
even at high count rates. To accomplish this, all the
electronic components beyond the detector crystal
must have low-noise characteristics and employ some
means of handling pulses that arrive in rapid succession.
This whole process used to rely on analog pulse proces-
sing, but many of the problems inherent in the analog
process have been solved by digital techniques (Mott
and Friel), and all current XEDS systems process the
charge pulses digitally.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider first of all what happens if a single,
isolated X-ray enters the detector and the electron-hole
pairs are separated and captured to create a charge
pulse.
</p>
<p>&amp; The charge enters the FET preamplifier and is con-
verted into a voltage pulse.
</p>
<p>&amp; The pulse is digitized and the X-ray energy that
generated the pulse is computed.
</p>
<p>&amp; The computer assigns the signal to the appropriate
energy channel on the display.
</p>
<p>The accumulation of pulses or counts entering
each channel at various rates produces a histogram
of counts versus energy that is a digital representa-
tion of the X-ray spectrum. The computer display
offers multiples of 1024 channels in which to display
the spectrum and various energy ranges can be

<p>assigned to these channels. For example, a 10-, 20-,
or 40-keV energy range can be used (or even 80 keV
for an IG detector on an intermediate-voltage AEM).
The display resolution chosen depends on the num-
ber of channels available.
</p>
<p>A typical energy range that youmight select for a Si(Li)
and SDD detector is 10 or 20 keV and in 2048 channels
this gives youadisplay resolutionof5or10 eVper channel.
</p>
<p>Details of the pulse-processing electronics are not
important except for two variables over which you
have control. These are the time constant and the dead
time. The time constant (t) is important only if you have
an old analog system; it is the time (�5&ndash;100 ms) allowed
for the analog processor to evaluate the magnitude of
the charge pulse.
</p>
<p>&amp; Choosing the shortest t (typically, a few ms) will allow
more counts per second (cps) to be processed but
with a greater error in the assignment of a specific
energy to the pulse, and so the energy resolution (see
Section 32.8 below) will be poorer.
</p>
<p>&amp; Choosing a longer t will give you better resolution
but the count rate will be lower.
</p>
<p>With an analog system you can&rsquo;t have a high
count rate and good resolution, so for most routine
thin-foil analyses you should maximize the count rate
(shortest t), unless there is a specific reasonwhy youwant
to get the best possible energy resolution (longest t). This
recommendation is based on a detailed argument pre-
sented by Statham.
</p>
<p>If you have a digital system, the individual pulses are
monitored and t is varied for each pulse, depending on
how close they are together. We call this &lsquo;adaptive pulse
processing&rsquo;; it gives a continuous variation of output
count rate with input rate rather than a discrete range
for each value of t.
</p>
<p>Now, in reality, there are many X-rays entering the
detector but, because of the speed of modern electron-
ics, the system can usually discriminate between the
arrival of two, almost simultaneous, X-rays. You can
find details of the electronics in Goldstein et al. When
the electronic circuitry detects the arrival of a pulse, it
takes less than a ms before the detector is effectively
switched off for a period of time called the dead time,
while the pulse processor analyzes that pulse. The dead
time is clearly closely related to t, and is so short that
you should expect your XEDS system to process out-
puts up to 10 kcps quite easily (if it is a later analog
system) and 30 kcps or more for a digital system. Even
higher outputs (up to 70&ndash;100 kcps) need to be handled
with an SDD (but in AEMs the beam current and/or
specimen thickness is rarely great enough). The dead
time increases as more X-rays enter your detector,
because it shuts down more often. The dead time can
be defined in several ways. If you take the ratio of the
output count rate (Rout) to the input count rate (Rin),
which you can usually measure, then

<p>� 100% (32:1a)
</p>
<p>DISPLAY RESOLUTION
You should keep the resolution at 10 eVper channel or
better. Smaller values use more memory, but memory
is cheap. Larger values mean fewer channels for each
characteristic peak, giving the peak a serrated step-like
appearance rather than a smooth Gaussian shape.
</p>
<p>LONG OR SHORT t?
For most routine thin-foil analyses, you should max-
imize the count rate (shortest t), unless there is a
specific reason why you want to get the best possible
energy resolution (longest t).

<p>An alternative definition is
</p>
<p>Dead time in%&frac14;&eth;clock time� live time&THORN;
clock time
</p>
<p>�100% (32:1b)
</p>
<p>These different &lsquo;times&rsquo; can be confusing, but it helps to
think of equation 32.1b as follows: if you ask the
computer to collect a spectrum for a live time of 100s,
then the detector must be live and receiving X-rays for
this amount of time. If the detector is actually dead for
20s because it is processing X-rays, it will actually take
120s of &lsquo;clock time&rsquo; to accumulate a spectrum, so the
dead time (from equation 32.1b)will be 20/120=16.7%.
As the input count rate increases, the output count
rate will drop and the clock time will increase
accordingly. Dead times in excess of 50&ndash;60% (or as
little as 30% in very old systems) mean that your
detector is saturated with X-rays and collection
becomes increasingly inefficient. Then you should
turn down the beam current or move to a thinner
area of the specimen to lower the count rate; but
this is a rare situation for a thin-foil analyst to face.
Just remember these times.
</p>
<p>&amp; Dead time is when the detector is not counting
X-rays but processing the previous photon.
</p>
<p>&amp; Live time is when the detector is ready to detect an
X-ray and not processing any signal.
</p>
<p>&amp; Clock time is what it says.
</p>
<p>32.8 ENERGY RESOLUTION
</p>
<p>The natural line width of the emitted X-rays is only a
few eV but the measured widths are usually &gt;&gt; 100 eV.
The electronic noise in the XEDS system is a major
source of the difference between the practical and theo-
retical energy resolutions and the width of the electronic
noise is described as the &lsquo;point-spread function&rsquo; of the
detector. Since the poor energy resolution of XEDS is a
major limitation, we need to examine this concept more
closely.
</p>
<p>We can define the energy resolutionR of the detector
as
</p>
<p>R2 &frac14; P 2 &thorn; I 2 &thorn; X 2 (32:2)
</p>
<p>where P is a measure of the quality of the processing
electronics, defined as the full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of a randomized electronic-pulse generator.X
is the FWHM-equivalent attributable to detector leak-
age current and incomplete charge collection (see Sec-
tion 32.9.A). I is the intrinsic line width of the detector
which is controlled by fluctuations in the numbers of
</p>
<p>electron-hole pairs created by a given X-ray and is
given by
</p>
<p>I &frac14; 2:35&eth;FeE&THORN;1=2 (32:3)
</p>
<p>Here F is the Fano factor of the distribution of X-ray
counts from Poisson statistics, � is the energy to create
an electron-hole pair in the detector, and E is the energy
of the X-ray line. Because of these two factors, the
experimental resolution can only be defined under stan-
dard analysis conditions defined by the IEEE.
</p>
<p>Rather than using IEEE-required radioactive
Fe55 we recommend measuring the R on your
AEM column! Now since Mn is not a common
specimen to have lying around, you will find it use-
ful to keep a thin NiO specimen (Egerton and
Cheng) to check the resolution when the detector is
on the column. You can also use the O K peak to
measure the low-energy resolution of your detector.
Suitable NiO films &lt; 50 nm thick are available from
commercial companies that provide supplies for EM
laboratories. Ni is close enough to Mn in the peri-
odic table that you can get good measure of resolu-
tion (although it will be slightly worse than that at
Mn since resolution degrades with increasing X-ray
energy). Others have used thin Cr films instead of
NiO. You should be more concerned with changes in
R over time than the absolute value since changes
indicate that the detector is responding differently to
the X-ray flux.
</p>
<p>Your computer system will have software that cal-
culates R rather than directly measuring the FWHM of
the Mn or Ni peak. It&rsquo;s good to measure the FWHM
yourself and you do this by determining the energy
width between the channels either side of the peak that
contain half the maximum counts in the central (peak)
channel, as shown in Figure 32.10.
</p>
<p>THE IEEE STANDARD FOR R
This is the FWHM of the Mn Ka peak, generated
(not in the microscope) by an Fe55 source which
produces 103 cps with an 8ms pulse-processor time
constant.
</p>
<p>COUNT-RATE EFFECT
All detectors lose resolution as their temperature
increases and the count rate increases, although digi-
tal electronics handle higher count rates better.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Because the value of � is lower for Ge (2.9 eV) than
for Si (3.8 eV), IG detectors have higher R than Si(Li).
The resolution is also a function of the detector area,
and the best values we just gave are for 10 mm2 detec-
tors. The 30 mm2 or 50 mm2 detectors, which are typi-
cally installed on AEMs to increase the count rate, have
resolutions �5&ndash;10 eV worse than the figures just men-
tioned. So you should be aware that, when you measure
R on your AEM, there will be a further degradation in
resolution. It is rare to find a 30 mm2 Si(Li) detector
delivering a resolution &lt;�140 eV on the AEM column,
even though quoted values are typically �10 eV less.
</p>
<p>How close are XEDS detectors to their theoretical
resolution limit? If we assume that there is no leakage
and the electronics produce no noise, then P=X=0 in
equation 32.2, soR= I. For Si, F=0.1, e=3.8 eV, and
the Mn Ka line occurs at 5.9 keV, which gives R =
111 eV. So it seems that there is not much more room
for improvement. The resolution of semiconductor
detectors won&rsquo;t approach that of crystal spectrometers
or bolometers (&lt; 1 to�10 eV). However, because of the
dependence of I on X-ray energy, light-element K lines
do have FWHMswell below 100 eV.We&rsquo;ll see in Section
34.5 that there are signal-processing methods to
improve the resolution.
</p>
<p>32.9 WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
YOUR XEDS
</p>
<p>There are several fundamental parameters which you can
specify, measure, andmonitor to ensure that your XEDS
is performing acceptably. Many of these tests are stan-
dard procedures (e.g., see the XEDS laboratories
described by Lyman et al.) and are summarized by Zem-
yan and Williams. In an SEM, which is relatively well
behaved, Si(Li) detectors have been known to last 10
years or more before requiring service or replacement.
In contrast, an AEM is a hostile environment and the life
of a detector can be considerably shortened unless there is
a protective shutter (see Section 32.11), which should
always be closed unless you are acquiring a spectrum. If
you analyze a thick portion of your specimen (a waste of
time), traverse a grid bar across the field of view (easy to
do), or accidentally insert the objective diaphragm while
the shutter is open (inwhich case you should be sentenced
to memorize this chapter) you can &lsquo;flood&rsquo; the detector
and close down the electronics. If this happens, ask for
help, but be prepared to wait a while because the system
takes time to recover. If it happens too often, you can
permanently damage your detector.
</p>
<p>You need to know the operating specifications for
your own XEDS, and how to measure them. We can
break these specifications down into detector variables
and signal-processing variables.
</p>
<p>For all of the tests/actions that we describe below,
you must discuss the procedure with the instrument
technician/laboratory manager before doing anything
because it is easy to damage the detector if you don&rsquo;t
do it right.
</p>
<p>32.9.A Detector Characteristics
</p>
<p>The detector resolution that we just defined may degrade
for a variety of reasons. Two are particularly common
</p>
<p>&amp; Damage to the intrinsic region by high-energy fluxes
of radiation.
</p>
<p>&amp; Bubbling in the liquid-N2 dewar due to ice crystals
building up.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just told you how to avoid the first prob-
lem. If part of your responsibility in the lab is to
</p>
<p>DETECTOR RESOLUTION
Typically, Si(Li) detectors have a resolution of
�140 eV at Mn Ka with the best being &lt;130 eV.
The best reported IG resolution is 114 eV. SDDs
offer about 140 eV but can get down to �130 eV
with Peltier cooling.

<p>degree of the ICC which distorts the low-energy side of the peak. The

</p>
<p>DAMAGING THE DETECTOR
High X-ray or electron fluxes can damage the detec-
tor; it is particularly important to monitor the detec-
tor performance on your AEM, so that quantitative
analyses you make at different times may be com-
pared in a valid manner.

<p>top up the liquid N2 then it should be filtered before
putting it into the dewar and never re-cycled. If the
N2 is bubbling, you must ask that the problem be
corrected and you can suggest warming up the
detector.
</p>
<p>Or you can suggest that the AEM needs a detector
cooled by means other than liquid N2!
</p>
<p>Incomplete-charge collection (ICC): because of the
dead layer, the X-ray peak will not be a perfect Gaussian
shape. Usually the peak will have a low-energy tail,
because some X-ray energy will be deposited in the
dead layer and will not create electron-hole pairs in the
intrinsic region. You can measure this ICC effect from
the ratio of the full width at tenthmaximum (FWTM) to
the FWHM of the displayed peak, as shown schemati-
cally in Figure 32.10.
</p>
<p>In Si(Li) detectors, the phosphorus Ka peak shows
the worst ICC effects because this X-ray fluoresces Si
very efficiently. ICC will also occur if the Si has a large
number of defects arising, for example, from damage via
a high flux of backscattered electrons. The crystal
defects act as recombination sites, but they can be
annealed by warming the detector, as we just described.
An IG detector should meet the same FWTM/FWHM
criterion as a Si(Li) detector. If the ratio is higher than 2
for the Ni Ka peak there is something seriously wrong
with the detector and it needs to be replaced. An SDD
has an extremely thin dead layer, so ICC should be
minimal.
</p>
<p>Detector contamination: over a period of time, even
in a UHV STEM, ice and/or hydrocarbons will even-
tually build up on the detector surface, or the window.
When contamination occurs, it reduces the detection
efficiency for low-energy X-rays. Ultimately, any detec-
tor will contaminate because of residual water vapor in
the detector vacuum or because the window may be
slightly porous. In all cases, the problem is insidious
because the effects develop over time and you might
not notice the degradation of your spectrum quality
until differences in light-element quantification occur
in the same specimen analyzed at different times. There-
fore, you should regularly monitor the quality of the
low-energy spectrum. The ratio of the Ni Ka/Ni La can
be used (as described by Michael) as a signal to warn of
icing/contamination.
</p>
<p>The K/L ratio will differ for different dead layers,
different UTWs orATWs, and different specimen thick-
nesses, so we can&rsquo;t define an acceptable figure of merit.
The best you can do is tomeasure the ratio (ideally when
you first use your detector) and monitor any changes,
being aware that, as the ratio increases, quantification
of low-energy X-ray lines becomes increasingly unreli-
able. When the ratio become unacceptable, the detector
should be warmed up. Automatic, in situ, heating
devices which raise the detector temperature sufficiently
to sublime off the ice, without warming the dewar up to
ambient temperature, make this process routine. If your
detector doesn&rsquo;t have such a device then you should
again ask that it be warmed. An SDD doesn&rsquo;t have
icing problems if operated at ambient temperatures
and, even if Peltier cooling is used, it is still nowhere as
cold as liquid N2.
</p>
<p>In summary, you should measure and continually
monitor changes in
</p>
<p>&amp; The detector resolution on the column using the Mn
or Ni Ka line (typically 150 eV for Si(Li) and 140 eV
for an IG or SDD).
</p>
<p>&amp; The ICC defined by the FWTM/FWHM ratio of the
Ni Ka line (ideally 1.82).
</p>
<p>&amp; The ice/contamination build-up reflected in the Ni
Ka/La ratio.
</p>
<p>If any of these figures of merit get significantly larger
than your baseline values, then warming up the detector,
if necessary to room temperature, may help.
</p>
<p>In summary, you must be very careful with your
XEDS.
</p>
<p>&amp; DO NOT generate high fluxes of X-rays or back-
scattered electrons unless your detector is shuttered.
</p>
<p>&amp; DO NOT ever warm up the detector yourself; get
help. But make sure that the bias is turned off and
the manufacturer is consulted.
</p>
<p>&amp; DO NOT use unfiltered or re-cycled liquid N2.
</p>
<p>A WARNING ON WARMING
Warming the detector to room temperature should
only happen after consultation with the manufac-
turer, and after turning off the applied bias. (Think
what happens to the Li otherwise.)
</p>
<p>IDEAL GAUSSIAN
An ideal Gaussian shape gives a ratio FWTM/
FWHM of 1.82 (Mn Ka or Ni Ka) but this will be
larger for lower-energy X-rays that are more strongly
absorbed by the detector.
</p>
<p>ICE ON THE DETECTOR
If contamination or ice builds up on the detector, the
Ka/La ratio rises; the ice selectively absorbs the
lower-energy L line.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>All these DO NOTs make liquid-N2-free and mini-
mal dead-layer SDDs rather attractive.
</p>
<p>32.9.B Processing Variables
</p>
<p>You need to ensure that the output counts (i.e., the
spectrum) reflect the input X-ray counts. There are
three things you can check to make sure the pulse-pro-
cessing electronics are working properly
</p>
<p>&amp; First, check the calibration of the energy range of the
spectrum.
</p>
<p>&amp; Second, check the dead-time correction circuitry.
&amp; Third, check the maximum output count rate.
</p>
<p>The energy resolution should not change signifi-
cantly from day to day, unless you change the (analog)
time constant. Electronic-circuit stability has improved
to a level where such checks need only be done a couple
of times a year. Will you do the check or rely on some-
one else?
</p>
<p>Calibration of the energy-display range: this process
is quite simple; collect a spectrum from a specimen
which generates a pair of X-ray lines separated by
about the width of the display range (e.g., Cu for
0&ndash;10 keV, Mo for 0&ndash;20 keV). Some systems use an
internal electronic strobe to define zero, and in this
case you only need a specimen with a dominant line at
the high end of the energy range. Having gathered a
spectrum, see if the computer markers are correctly
positioned at the peak centroid (e.g., Cu La at
0.932 keV and Cu Ka at 8.04 keV). (You&rsquo;ll learn more
about the specific energies in Chapter 34 and you can
also go back to Chapter 4 to remind yourself of the
relationship between E and Z.)
</p>
<p>Checking the dead-time correction circuit: if the dead-
time correction electronics are working properly, the
electronics will give an increase in output counts directly
proportional to the increase in input counts, for a fixed
live time. This behavior is absolutely essential for valid
quantification.
</p>
<p>&amp; Choose a pure element, say our favorite NiO foil
which we know will give a strong Ka peak.
</p>
<p>&amp; Choose a live time, say 50s, and a beam current to
give a dead-time readout of about 10%.
</p>
<p>&amp; Measure the total Ni Ka counts that accumulate in
about 30&ndash;60s (longer is better).
</p>
<p>Then repeat the experiment with higher input count
rates (e.g., dead times of 30, 50, 70%).
</p>
<p>To increase the count rate, increase the beam cur-
rent by choosing a larger diameter beam or larger C2
aperture. The dead time should increase as the input
count rate goes up, but the live time remains fixed (by
your choice). If you plot the number of output counts
against the beam current, measured with a Faraday
cup, or a calibrated exposure-meter reading, then it
should be linear, as shown in Figure 32.11. But you
will see when you do the experiment that it takes an
increasingly longer (clock) time to attain the preset live
time as the dead time increases. If you don&rsquo;t have a
Faraday cup, you can use the input count rate as a
measure of the current; remember that the Faraday
cup is useful for many other functions, such as charac-
terizing the performance of the electron source, as we
saw in Chapter 5. Remember
</p>
<p>Determination of the maximum output count rate:
again the procedure is simple
</p>
<p>&amp; Gather a spectrum for a fixed clock time, say 10&ndash;30s,
with a given dead time, say 10%.
</p>
<p>&amp; Increase the dead time by increasing the beam cur-
rent, C2 aperture, or specimen thickness.
</p>
<p>&amp; See how many counts accumulate in the Ni Ka peak
in the same fixed clock time.
</p>
<p>RECALIBRATE
If the peak and the marker are &gt;1 channel (10 eV)
apart, then you should recalibrate your display using
the commercial software.
</p>
<p>MUST BE LINEAR
The processing electronics must show linear behavior
for valid quantification.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The number of counts should rise to a maximum
and then drop off above a certain dead time, which
depends on the system electronics. Beyond the maxi-
mum, the detector will be dead more than it is live and
so the counts in a given clock time will decrease. In
Figure 32.12A, this maximum is at about 60% dead
time, typical of modern systems, although in older
XEDS units this peak can occur at as little as 30%. If
you have analog electronics, you can repeat this experi-
ment for different time constants, t, and the counts
</p>
<p>should increase as t is lowered (at the expense of energy
resolution), as also shown in Figure 32.12A. Clearly, if
you operate at the maximum in such a curve (if you can
generate enough input counts) then you will be getting
the maximum possible counts in the shortest possible
time. As we&rsquo;ve already said, it is almost always better to
have more counts than to have the best energy resolu-
tion, so select the shortest t unless you have a peak
overlap problem. Digital processing is easier than ana-
log for this reason.
</p>
<p>If your specimen is too thin it might not be possible
to generate sufficient X-ray counts to reach dead times
in excess of 50%, so the curve may not reach a max-
imum, particularly if t is very short or you have digital
processing. In this case, just use a thicker specimen.
</p>
<p>While it is rare that a good thin foil produces enough
X-rays to overload the detector electronics, there are
situations (e.g., maximizing analytical sensitivity&mdash;see
Chapter 36) when you need to generate as many counts
as possible. However, if you use a thick specimen and
high beam current, you may produce too many counts
for analog processing, or even digital, systems. If high
count rate is your primary mode of operation, you
might want to consider an SDD. Figure 32.12B shows
the prospects for high output count rates with an SDD.
The problem in TEM, as we&rsquo;ve noted, is to generate
sufficient counts to make use of this extraordinary pro-
cessing capability.
</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 32.13, digital processing
permits a higher throughput over a continuous
range of energy resolution than the fixed ranges avail-
able from each specific (in this case six) t for an
analog system. We&rsquo;ve already mentioned that Cs
correction permits larger apertures to be used and
therefore, significantly more current can be put into
small probes, but it&rsquo;s unlikely that if you have a
Cs-corrected AEM it will be still interfaced to an
old analog XEDS system.
</p>
<p>In summary, you should occasionally
</p>
<p>&amp; Check the energy calibration of the computer
display.
</p>
<p>&amp; Check the dead-time circuitry by the linearity of
the output count rate versus beam current
(Figure 32.11).
</p>
<p>&amp; Check the counts in a fixed clock time as a function
of beam current to determine the maximum output
count rate (Figure 32.12).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>32.10 THE XEDS-AEM INTERFACE
</p>
<p>In your TEM, an intense beam of high-energy electrons
bombards your specimen, which scatters many elec-
trons. The specimen and any other part of the TEM
that is hit by these electrons emit both characteristic
and bremsstrahlung X-rays (which have energies up to
that of the electron beam). X-rays of several tens or
hundreds of keV can penetrate long distances into the
material and fluoresce characteristic X-rays from any-
thing that they hit. Ideally, the XEDS should only &lsquo;see&rsquo;
the X-rays from the beam-specimen interaction volume.
However, as shown in Figure 32.14, it is not possible to
prevent radiation from the stage and other areas of the
</p>
<p>specimen from entering the detector. As you can see
from Figure 32.14, the XEDS has a collimator in front
of the detector crystal. This collimator is the last line of
defense against the entry of undesired radiation from
the stage region of the microscope.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth checking if you have an ideal collimator,
constructed of a high-Z material, such as W, Ta, or Pb,
coated externally and internally with a low-Z material,
such as Al, C, or Be. The low-Z coating minimizes the
production of X-rays from backscattered electrons that
happen to spiral into the collimator. The high-Z mate-
rial absorbs high-energy bremsstrahlung. The inside of
the collimator should be baffled to prevent any back-
scattered electrons from generating X-rays that then
penetrate the detector. No collimator is entirely success-
ful and we&rsquo;ll describe the contribution of system-pro-
duced X-rays in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>32.10.A Collection Angle
</p>
<p>The detector collection angle (O) is the solid angle
subtended at the analysis point on the specimen
by the active area of the front face of the detector.
The collection angle is shown in Figure 32.14 and is
defined as
</p>
<p>O &frac14; A cos d
S2
</p>
<p>(32:4)
</p>
<p>where A is the active area of the detector (usually
30 mm2), S is the distance from the analysis point to
the detector face, and d is the angle between the normal
to the detector face and a line from the detector to the
specimen. In many XEDS systems, the detector crystal
is tilted toward the specimen so d=0, thenO=A/S2. It
is clear that to maximizeO the detector should be placed
as close to the specimen as possible.
</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see, in most AEM experiments, it is the low
X-ray count rate that limits the accuracy of the experi-
ment. Commercial Si(Li) crystals have A values from 10
to 30mm2 and 50 mm2 is becoming more common. As a
result, values of O dictated by the closest distance
between the specimen and detector/collimator lie in the
range from 0.3 down to 0.03 sr. ATW detectors invari-
ably have lower O values than Be-window or window-
less detectors because the polymer window has to be
supported on a grid which reduces the collection angle
by �20%. IG detectors need a reflective window to
prevent IR radiation from generating noise in the

</p>

</p>
<p>collection angle O and take-off angle a are also shown.
</p>
<p>THE COLLIMATOR
The collimator defines both the (desired) collection
angle of the detector and the average take-off angle of
X-rays entering the detector.

<p>detector. So, even with the largest detectors,O is a small
fraction of the total solid angle of characteristic X-ray
generation, which is, of course, 4p sr.
</p>
<p>This value of O is calculated from the dimensions of
the stage and the collimator. There is no way, however,
that you can measure this critical parameter directly,
although you can compare X-ray count rates between
different detector systems using a standard specimen
such as our thin NiO film and a known beam current.
A useful figure of merit is the X-ray counts per second
detected from a standard specimen, with a given beam
current and a given detector collection angle (cps/nA/
sr). Typically, for an AEM with a nominal O of 0.13 sr
and a beam energy of 300 keV the figure of merit is
&gt; 8000. For a beam energy of 100 keV, it is about
13,000 (Zemyan and Williams). The increase at lower
keV is due to the increased ionization cross section.
</p>
<p>The magnitude of O is limited because the upper
polepiece of the objective lens gets in the way of the
collimator, thus limiting S. To avoid this limitation,
we could increase the polepiece gap but doing so
would lower the maximum beam current and degrade
the image resolution, both of which are highly undesir-
able. The advent of Cs-corrected AEMs has removed
this limitation and will open up a new chapter in high
count-rate X-ray analysis in AEMs (Watanabe and
Williams). Arrays of SDDs have already been used to
give solid angles &gt;1 sr on PIXE systems (Doyle et al.),
so the future of XEDS in the AEM has exciting
possibilities.
</p>
<p>32.10.B Take-Off Angle
</p>
<p>The take-off angle a is the angle between the specimen
surface (at 0� tilt) and a line to the center of the detector,
as shown in Figure 32.14. Sometimes, it is also defined
as the angle between the transmitted beam and the line
to the detector, which is simply (90� + a). In the SEM/
EPMA, we keep a high to minimize X-ray absorption in
bulk specimens. Unfortunately, in an AEM, if we max-
imize a, the price we pay is lowering O. A high-angle
detector has to be positioned above the upper objective
polepiece and will be much farther from the specimen.
In the EPMA, low O is not a problem because there are
always sufficient X-rays from a bulk specimen, but in
the AEM the highest possible O is essential, as we&rsquo;ve
already emphasized (counts, counts. . .).
</p>
<p>In those AEMs where the detector has a high take-
off angle but a low O, the poor X-ray count rate makes
quantitative analysis much more time consuming.
Keeping the detector below the polepiece restricts a to
a maximum of about 20�. In most cases you will find
that such a small value of a is not a problem because one
of the major advantages of thin-specimen AEM com-
pared to EPMA is that absorption can usually be
neglected. If absorption is a problem in your particular
specimen, you can reduce the X-ray path length by
tilting it toward the detector, thus increasing a (see
Section 35.5). We don&rsquo;t recommend tilting because it
increases spurious effects (see Chapter 33) and also low-
ers the P/B (peak to background) ratio in the spectrum.
</p>
<p>32.10.C Orientation of the Detector
to the Specimen
</p>
<p>There are two simple questions that you must be able to
answer.
</p>
<p>(a) Is the detector pointing on axis? The detector is
inserted to a point where it is almost touching the objec-
tive polepiece, and you hope that it is &lsquo;looking&rsquo; at the
region of your specimen that is on the optic axis when
the specimen is eucentric and at zero tilt. To find out if
your system is thus aligned, take a low-magnification X-
ray map from a homogeneous specimen, such as our
thin NiO film. If the detector is not pointing on axis, the
map will show an asymmetric intensity. Alternatively, if
you can&rsquo;t map at a low enoughmagnification, simply see
how the Ni Ka intensity varies from area to area on the
foil with the stage traverses set at zero and different
areas selected using the beam deflectors. The maximum
intensity should be recorded in the middle grid square
and for some distance around. It is also instructive to do
the same test with the specimen moved above or below
the eucentric plane. Again, the maximum intensity
should be recorded at eucentricity. If the intensity is
asymmetric then the detector or the collimator is not
well aligned and some of your precious X-ray counts are
being shadowed from the detector, probably by the
collimator. So you need to ask for technical help.
</p>
<p>(b) Where is the detector with respect to the image?
It is best if the detector is &lsquo;looking&rsquo; toward a thin region
of the specimen, rather than toward a thicker region, as
shown in Figure 32.15A. This alignment minimizes the
X-ray path length through your specimen. If the BF
image rotates when changing magnification in your
TEM then the apparent detector orientation with
respect to the image (on the screen) will vary with
</p>
<p>W
The value of O is the most important parameter in
determining the quality of your X-ray analysis. You
need three things for good AEM X-ray analysis:
counts, counts, and more counts.
</p>
<p>TAKE-OFF ANGLE AND COUNTS
We would like to maximize the take-off angle and
maximize the count rate, but we can&rsquo;t.

<p>magnification. A STEM BF doesn&rsquo;t rotate so the rela-
tive orientation of the detector to your image is fixed. It
is simple to find this orientation if the detector axis (y
axis) is normal to a principal traverse axis (x) of the
stage. If you press gently on the end of your holder, the
image will move in the +x direction. Then you can
determine geometrically the direction (+y or &ndash;y) along
which the detector is &lsquo;looking&rsquo; with respect to that +x
direction in the TEM image. In STEM, the image might
be rotated 180� with respect to the TEM image so you
have to take this into account. But it&rsquo;s all a good exercise
in 3D geometry.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing analysis or mapping across a planar
interface, which is a common AEM application, then
you should also orient your specimen such that the
interface is parallel to the detector axis and the beam,
so the detected X-rays have come through regions of
</p>
<p>similar composition and don&rsquo;t cross the interface. A tilt-
rotation holder is ideal for this but, if a low-background
version is not available, then you may need to take out
the holder and re-position your foil manually a few
times until the interface is in the right orientation (see
Figure 32.15B).
</p>
<p>32.11 PROTECTING THE DETECTOR
FROM INTENSE RADIATION
</p>
<p>If you are not careful, the XEDS electronics can be
temporarily saturated if high doses of electrons or
X-rays hit the detector. The detector itself may also
be damaged, particularly in intermediate-voltage
AEMs. As we&rsquo;ve noted, these situations occur when
you inadvertently move thick areas of your specimen
under the beam, or if you are traversing around a
thin specimen and the support grid hits the beam.
To avoid these problems, shutter systems are built
into most XEDS systems which automatically pro-
tect the Si(Li) crystal if the AEM is switched to low
magnification or if the pulse processor detects too
high a flux of radiation.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a shutter then you can physically
retract the detector to lower O (if it is retracted along a
line of sight to the specimen) or remove the detector
from out of view of the specimen. The drawback to this
approach is that constant retraction and reinsertion of
the detector may cause undue wear on the sliding &lsquo;O&rsquo;-
ring seal. Also you may reposition your detector
slightly differently each time, unless the system is
designed so you can push the detector to a fixed stop,
thus insuring a constant O and a. A shutter is highly
recommended!

<p>FIGURE32.15. (A) The position of theXEDS relative to a wedge-shaped
</p>
<p>thin foil results in different X-ray path lengths. The shortest path length

</p>
<p>X-ray absorption. (B) The preferred orientation of the XEDS when
</p>
<p>analyzing a planar defect: the interface plane is parallel to the detector

</p>
<p>LOOKING AT THE SPECIMEN
TheXEDS detector must be &lsquo;looking&rsquo; at the thin edge
of your specimen and aligned with any planar inter-
face you are studying.
</p>
<p>SHUT THE SHUTTER
To avoid reliance on the automatic system, it is best
to have the shutter closed until you have decided
which area you want to analyze and it is thin enough
that the generated X-ray flux doesn&rsquo;t saturate the
detector. Also, never have the objective aperture
inserted.

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The XEDS (usually of the Si(Li) variety) is the only X-ray spectrometer currently used in
TEMs. It is remarkably compact, efficient, and sensitive. A combination of Si(Li)/SDD and IG
detectors can detect Ka lines from all the elements from Be to U. The XEDS is limited by its
poor energy resolution, artifacts in the spectra, and the need for cooling, but it is simple to run
andmaintain. Youmust take care to perform certain basic procedures and refrain from certain
others that can damage the detector. Sometimes, it may be too simple; beware. You need to
</p>
<p>&amp; Measure your detector resolution every 6 months at the Mn or Ni Ka line (at best
130&ndash;140 eV for Si(Li) or SDD and 120&ndash;130 eV for IG).
</p>
<p>&amp; Measure the ICC (FWTM/FWHM ratio of the Ni Ka line: ideally 1.82), every 6months.
&amp; Unless you have an SDD or a Peltier-cooled Si(Li), monitor ice build-up via in the Ni
Ka/La ratio on a monthly basis.
</p>
<p>&amp; Check the calibration of the energy range of your computer display every 6 months
especially if you have an SDD.
</p>
<p>&amp; Check the dead-time correction circuitry by the linearity of the output count rate versus
beam current, every 6 months.
</p>
<p>&amp; Check the counts in a fixed clock time as a function of beam current to determine the
maximum output count rate, every 6 months.
</p>
<p>&amp; Always operate with the shutter closed until you are ready for analysis.
&amp; Always retract the objective diaphragm prior to analysis.
&amp; Ensure the XEDS is pointing toward the thin edge of any wedge/disk specimen.
</p>
<p>Interfacing your XEDS to the AEM is crucial since it determines the count rate, the need
for an absorption correction, and the intrusion of spurious X-rays into your spectrum. In
any decision involving XEDS in the AEM, you should always choose the option that
optimizes the count rate.
</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, Table 32.2 shows you the relative merits of the various
detectors that we have discussed in this chapter.

</p>
<p>Why do we not have to cool an SDD to liquid-N2 temperatures?
</p>
<p>T32.3 Explain why, in comparison to a Si(Li) detector, an IG detector exhibits (a) better energy resolution, (b)
</p>
<p>more resistance to high-energy electron damage, (c) less susceptibility to accidental loss of liquid N2 and

</p>
<p>X-ray Spectra and Images
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>TheX-ray spectrum generatedwithin your specimen consists of element-specific characteristic
peaks with well-defined energies superimposed on a non-characteristic background. While
the XEDS system is a remarkable piece of technology, we&rsquo;ve already described its limited
resolution and we will see in this chapter that it is also prone to creating small artifact peaks
in the spectrum. Furthermore, the unavoidable presence of scattered electrons and X-rays
within the AEM conspire to degrade the quality of the generated spectrum and increase
the number of false peaks in the displayed spectrum. The AEM illumination system and
specimen stage are rich sources of powerful radiation, not all of it by any means coming
from the area of interest in your specimen. So you have to take precautions to ensure that
the X-ray spectrum you collect comes predominantly from the area of the specimen that you
want to analyze and we describe several tests you should perform to ensure that the XEDS-
TEM interface is optimized. Once you understand the desirable and undesirable contents of
a spectrum, we&rsquo;ll show you the various ways to gather your spectra, display them, and also
form X-ray images from them. In particular, digital spectrum imaging is the most powerful
technique for optimizing the information that you can gather from the low number of
counts generated in thin foils.
</p>
<p>33.1 THE IDEAL SPECTRUM
</p>
<p>Back in Chapter 4 we learned that electrons generate
two kinds of X-rays. When electrons ionize an atom
which returns to ground state, the emitted characteristic
X-ray energy is unique to the ionized atom (Figure 4.2).
When electrons are slowed by electrostatic interaction
with the nucleus they produce a continuum of brems-
strahlung X-rays and together the characteristic peaks
and the bremsstrahlung background comprise the X-ray
spectra we detect and display via the XEDS (as shown
schematically back in Figure 4.6 and experimentally in
Figure 32.2 and many others).
</p>
<p>33.1.A The Characteristic Peaks
</p>
<p>Some more detailed revision: a beam electron ionizes an
atom in your specimen by ejecting an inner or core-shell
electron, leaving a hole in the shell. The probability of
this event occurring is governed by the ionization cross
section. Then a cascade of electron transitions occurs,
with each transition filling the hole with an electron
from a more weakly bound shell (leaving a hole in that
</p>
<p>shell, and so on) and ultimately the last electron falls
into a core-shell from the conduction band. Depending
on the fluorescence yield, each transition results in either
a characteristic X-ray or an Auger electron. The char-
acteristic X-rays have a well-defined energy and a nat-
ural &lsquo;line width&rsquo; (the FWHM of the Gaussian
distribution of X-ray energies) of typically 1&ndash;5 eV.
But, as you already know from the previous chapter,
the XEDS degrades this width to a Gaussian-shaped
peak with a FWHM of about 135 � 10 eV. We&rsquo;ll use
the term &lsquo;line&rsquo; to denote the actual X-ray energy at the
peak of the Gaussian and we&rsquo;ll talk about K, L, and M
families of lines (and indeed the XEDS computer dis-
play includes lines superimposed on the spectra at theK,
L, M, etc., peak energies). The actual number of counts
(intensities) of the characteristic peaks from a given
element, and the relative differences between spectra
from different elements, are really quite complex and
we&rsquo;ll go into this more in the next chapter when we
discuss details of spectra and qualitative analysis. For
the time being, all you need to know is that, generally
speaking, lower-energy X-ray peaks are more intense
than higher-energy ones and the heavier the element,
</p>
<p>33 .1 THE IDEAL SPECTRUM ..................................................................................................................................................................... 605</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the more complex the characteristic spectrum. Also X-
rays with energies &lt; �1 keV are absorbed both within
your specimen and within the detector and ultimately,
the combination of absorption and low fluorescence
yield means it is not possible to detect X-rays with
energies &lt; �110 eV (the Be K line).
</p>
<p>33.1.B The Continuum Bremsstrahlung
Background
</p>
<p>The background in the X-ray spectrum is bremsstrah-
lung (braking) radiation arising as beam electrons are
slowed down or stopped by electrostatic interactions
with nuclei in the specimen. The intensity of the brems-
strahlung is zero at the beam energy (since we can&rsquo;t
create more energy than the beam has) and rises until it
is effectively infinite at zero energy. This distribution is
well understood and described mathematically by var-
iations on Kramers&rsquo; law as we also noted back in
Figure 4.6. Modifications to Kramers&rsquo; law account
well for the absorption of the X-rays and accurately
describe the experimentally detected bremsstrahlung
distribution, even from thin specimens. So the net
result is that X-ray spectra consist, as we have seen,
for example, in Figures 1.4A and 32.2, of characteristic,
Gaussian-shaped peaks superimposed on a background
of bremsstrahlung X-rays, most clearly visible in Figure
32.2F. Many more spectra will appear throughout this
and subsequent chapters and, as already noted, we can
create elemental images from specific characteristic
peaks.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what makes X-ray spectrometry
challenging is that the spectrum generated within
your thin specimen, the spectrum detected by your
Si(Li) detector, and the spectrum displayed on your
computer screen are all quite different. So understand-
ing what controls the X-ray counts that you measure in
the characteristic peaks in your spectra is absolutely
essential. Otherwise it will be difficult to first identify
(Chapter 34) and then quantify (Chapter 35) the peak
intensities in terms of the presence and the amount,
respectively, of the elements in the analysis volume of
your specimen.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll first describe how the XEDS system generates
artifact (escape, sum, and internal fluorescence) peaks
and then we&rsquo;ll show how the AEM itself also contrib-
utes unwanted X-rays, all of which can confuse the
unwary operator into thinking certain elements are in
their specimen when, in fact, they are not. Misinterpre-
tation of the presence or absence of certain elemental
signals could cause real problems if, for example, you
aremaking decisions on the suitability or otherwise of a
specific material for a given application, or even more
seriously, making a forensic or medical decision based
on the chemistry of your specimen: more about this in
Chapter 34.
</p>
<p>33.2 ARTIFACTS COMMON TO Si(Li) XEDS
SYSTEMS
</p>
<p>The XEDS system introduces its own artifacts into the
spectrum. Fortunately, we understand all these artifacts,
but they still occasionally mislead the unwary operator;
see the review by Newbury. We can separate the arti-
facts into two groups
</p>
<p>&amp; Signal-detection artifacts: examples are escape peaks
and internal fluorescence peaks.
</p>
<p>&amp; Signal-processing artifacts: e.g., the sum peaks.
</p>
<p>Escape peak: Because the detector is not a perfect sink
for all the X-ray energy, it is possible that a small fraction
of the energy is lost and not transformed into electron-
hole pairs. The easiest way for this to happen is if the
incoming photon of energy E fluoresces a Si Ka X-ray
(energy 1.74 keV) which escapes from the intrinsic region
of the detector. The detector then registers an apparent
X-ray energy of (E &ndash; 1.74) keV, as shown in Figure 33.1.
</p>
<p>The magnitude of the escape peak depends on the
design of the detector and the energy of the fluorescing
X-ray. Themost efficient X-ray to fluoresce Si KaX-rays
is the P Ka, but in a well-designed detector even the P
escape peak will only amount to &lt;2% of the P Ka
intensity. This fact explains why you can only see escape
peaks if there are major characteristic peaks in the spec-
trum. More escape peaks occur in IG spectra because we
can fluoresce both GeKa (9.89 keV) and La (1.19 keV)
</p>
<p>ESCAPE PEAK
Si escape peaks appear in the spectrum 1.74 keV
below the true characteristic peak position.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 33.1. The escape peak in a spectrum from pure Cu, 1.74 keV

</p>
<p>because it is 50&ndash;100� more intense than the escape peak.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>characteristic X-rays in the detector. Each of these will
cause corresponding escape peaks. SDDs are thinner than
typical Si(Li) crystals so there may be a slightly enhanced
possibility for an escape peak. The analysis software
should be able to recognize any escape peak, remove it,
and add the intensity back into the characteristic peak
where it belongs. Because the escape-peak intensity is so
small it is rarely a problem unless you misinterpret it as
coming from an element which is not present.
</p>
<p>The internal fluorescence peak: This is a characteris-
tic peak from the Si (or Ge) in the detector dead layer.
Incoming photons can fluoresce atoms in the dead layer
and the resulting Si Ka or Ge K/L X-rays enter the
intrinsic region of the detector which cannot distinguish
their source and, therefore, register a small peak in the
spectrum. As semiconductor detector design has
improved and dead layers have decreased in thickness,
the internal fluorescence peak artifact has shrunk but it
has not yet disappeared entirely. So beware.
</p>
<p>Obviously if you are looking for small amounts of Si
in your specimen you&rsquo;ll always find it in a Si(Li) spectrum
after long enough counting time!Depending on the dead-
layer thickness, the Si K peak intensity corresponds to
�0.1&ndash;1% of the specimen composition (see Figure 33.2)
so it is hardly a major problem if you are aware of it.
Similar effects are observed in IG detectors also, but the
very thin dead layer in SDDs should be an advantage.
</p>
<p>Sum peak: As we described earlier, the processing
electronics are designed to switch off the detector while
</p>
<p>each pulse is analyzed and assigned to the correct energy
channel. The sum peak arises when the count rate
exceeds the electronics&rsquo; ability to discriminate all the
individual pulses and so-called &lsquo;pulse pile-up&rsquo; occurs.
This is likely to occur when
</p>
<p>&amp; The input count rate is high.
&amp; The dead times are &gt;� 60%.
&amp; There aremajor characteristic peaks in the spectrum.
</p>
<p>The electronics simply cannot be perfect. Occasion-
ally, two photons will enter the detector at exactly the
same time. The analyzer then registers an energy corre-
sponding to the sum of the two photons. Since this
coincidence event is most likely for the X-ray giving
the major peak, a sum peak first appears at twice the
energy of the major peak, as shown in Figure 33.3.
</p>
<p>If you are using an SDD because you have a Cs-
corrected AEM and are seeking to maximize count
rates, you can generate multiple sum peaks, causing
serious interpretation problems in your analyses.
There is evidence (see Newbury&rsquo;s paper) that digital
processing is, in fact, worse than analog processing in
terms of generating sum peaks in SDD systems, and
hybrid analog/digital systems are being considered in
the SEM field where this is a bigger problem.
</p>
<p>Since you can&rsquo;t usually generate very high count rates,
unless your specimen is really thick, there is little need to
worry about sum peaks in AEM spectra but, as always,
</p>
<p>LONG COUNTING TIMES
A small Si Ka peak will occur in ALL spectra from
Si(Li) detectors after long counting times.
</p>

</p>

<p>trace 70%, middle trace 47%, lower trace 14% dead time. The sum-peak

</p>
<p>THE SUM PEAK
The sum peak should be invisible if you maintain a
reasonable input count rate, typically &lt;10,000 cps,
which should give a dead time of &lt;60%.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>you should at least be aware of the danger. (For example,
the ArKa energy is almost exactly twice the AlKa energy
and the sum peak has led some researchers to report Ar
being present in Al specimens when it wasn&rsquo;t, and has
caused others to ignore Ar, which actually was present in
ion-milled specimens!) One exception to this lack of con-
cern is if you have intense low-energy peaks where the
residual noise in the electronic circuitry interfereswith the
pile-up rejection. So if you&rsquo;re analyzing elements lighter
than Mg, take care to use low input count rates. Reduc-
ing the dead time to 10&ndash;20% should remove even the
Mg Ka sum peak, as shown in Figure 33.3.
</p>
<p>Much of what we have just discussed and most of
what we&rsquo;ll cover in Chapters 34 and 35, can be observed
experimentally on theAEM.But it is often just as instruc-
tive, and certainly easier, to simulate the spectra. To this
end, we strongly advise you to download the public-
domain simulation software &lsquo;Desktop Spectrum Analy-
zer&rsquo; (DTSA) fromNIST (Fiori and Swyt andURL#1); it
is listed in the recommended software in Section 1.6 and
its use is described in depth in the companion text. In fact,
almost all the spectra in this and the subsequent chapter
were generated by DTSA (in part, to ensure a uniform
appearance). This software permits realistic simulation of
XEDS data in TEMs (and SEMs) and introduces you to
all the aspects of spectral processing, artifacts, modeling,
etc., that are discussed in this and the next three chapters.
</p>
<p>33.3 THE REAL SPECTRUM
</p>
<p>In the perfect AEM, all spectra would be characteristic
only of the chosen analysis region of your specimen with
which the beam interacts. The analysis of bulk speci-
mens in the SEM/EPMA approaches this ideal but, in
the AEM, two factors combine to introduce false infor-
mation which we call system and spurious X-rays. These
X-rays introduce small errors into both qualitative and
quantitative analysis, unless you are aware of the dan-
gers and take appropriate precautions to identify and
minimize the problems. The two factors that make the
AEM different to the EPMA and that are responsible
for these problems are
</p>
<p>&amp; The high-voltage electrons which generate intense
doses of stray X-rays and scattered electrons in the
illumination system.
</p>
<p>&amp; The thin specimen which scatters high-energy elec-
trons and X-rays around the limited confines of the
AEM stage.
</p>
<p>Modern AEMs are designed to minimize some of
these problems, but they have not disappeared entirely.
It is important for you to understand that these prob-
lems are not major distortions of the X-ray spectrum,
and only introduce small peaks or changes in intensity
equivalent to composition changes at the 1% level or
</p>
<p>less. Nevertheless, identification and quantification of
such small elemental amounts are often the raison d&rsquo;être
for an analysis (e.g., impurity segregation), so you have
to be wary of these artifacts which we&rsquo;ll now discuss in
some detail. Remember, these artifacts are in addition to
the XEDS artifacts, described in the previous section.
</p>
<p>33.3.A Pre-specimen Effects
</p>
<p>The TEM illumination system produces high-energy
bremsstrahlung X-rays and electrons scattered outside
the main beam, both of which may strike the specimen,
producing spurious X-rays.
</p>
<p>In inhomogeneous specimens (which are usually just
the kind that we want to analyze) the presence of sig-
nificant amounts of spurious X-rays means that the
quantification process could give the wrong answer.
There are reviews (e.g., Williams and Goldstein or
Allard and Blake), which describe in detail how to iden-
tify and minimize these artifacts from the illumination
system, so we will just describe the precautions neces-
sary to insure that the AEM is operating acceptably.
Since these artifacts are primarily a result of the high-
energy electrons interacting with column components,
such as diaphragms and polepieces, you must take extra
care when using intermediate-voltage instruments.
</p>
<p>The standard way to detect stray radiation from the
illumination system is to position the focused electron
beam to pass through a hole in your specimen and see if
you can detect an X-ray spectrum characteristic of the
specimen.
</p>
<p>If the major peak in the hole-count spectrum con-
tains more than a few percent of the characteristic inten-
sity in the same major peak obtained from a thin area of
your specimen, under similar conditions, then the illu-
mination system needs attention.
</p>
<p>You can easily determine whether stray electrons or
X-rays are the problem, as illustrated in Figure 33.4,
which shows spectra obtained on a silver disk specimen
(A) and down the hole (B). Ag has a high-energy Ka line
at �23 keV and a low-energy La line at � 3 keV. With
the beam through the hole in the disk, stray X-rays will
fluoresce the high-energy peak more efficiently and
stray electrons will preferentially excite the low-energy
peak. So changes in the K/L ratio from a heavy metal
test specimen such as Ag are determinative experiments.
The NiO specimen that we described in Chapter 32 is
available on Mo support grids and the Mo K/L ratio is
equally diagnostic.
</p>
<p>SPURIOUS X-RAYS
We define spurious X-rays as those that come from
the specimen but are not generated by the electron
probe in the chosen analysis region.
</p>
<p>608 ....................................................................................................................................................................X-RAY SPECTRA AND IMAGES</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider first the problem of high-energy
bremsstrahlung X-rays generated in and penetrating
through a standard Pt C2 diaphragm (go back and
look at Figure 6.10 to remind yourself why diaphragms
stop beam electrons). These X-rays flood your specimen
and fluoresce characteristic X-rays from a large area
around the analysis region. These stray X-rays would
give a high Ag (or Mo) K/L ratio in the spectrum from
your test specimen (see Figure 33.4B).
</p>
<p>These diaphragms should be a standard fixture in
your AEM (check with your lab manager) but they are
expensive and they cannot be flame-cleaned in the usual
way. When the thick diaphragms do contaminate, you
have to discard them, otherwise the contamination itself
will become a source of X-rays and will also deviate
electrons out of the main beam by charging.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, some AEMs incorporate a small dia-
phragm just above the upper objective lens to shadow
the thicker outer regions of the specimen from stray
X-rays.
</p>
<p>Another way you can minimize the effects of this
undesirable bremsstrahlung is to use an evaporated
film or window-polished flake on a Be grid rather than
a self-supporting disk, but you don&rsquo;t always have this
choice. If your specimen is thinner than the path length
for fluorescence (a few tens of nm in many cases), spu-
rious X-rays will not be generated. Of course, it may not
be possible to prepare such thin specimens, or it may
take a great deal of effort, while self-supporting disks
are relatively easy and quick to produce; so this isn&rsquo;t a
popular suggestion with graduate students. However,
with increasing interest in the properties of nano-scale
</p>

<p>an electron-characteristic (high L/K ratio) spectrum when struck by the
</p>
<p>primary beam. (B) Without a thick C2 diaphragm, a reasonably intense
</p>
<p>Ag spectrum is also detected when the beam is placed down a hole in the
</p>
<p>specimen. This spectrum has a highK/L ratio which indicates high-energy
</p>
<p>FIGURE 33.4 (Continued) bremsstrahlung fluorescence. Note that the
</p>
<p>(spurious) Ag Ka hole-count intensity (B) is � 50% of the (real) Ag Ka
intensity (A) recorded from the specimen! (C) Use of a thick Pt C2
</p>
<p>diaphragm reduces the intensity of the Ag Ka hole count substantially.
</p>
<p>The Ka intensity in (C) is about 30 times less than in (B). (Note the scale
</p>
<p>change.)
</p>
<p>Pt TOP HAT
The solution to this problem is to use very thick
(several mm) platinum diaphragms which have a
top-hat shape, and a slightly tapered bore tomaintain
good electron collimation (see Figure 33.4C).
</p>
<p>THE HOLE COUNT
We cannot reduce spurious radiation sources to zero,
so a spectrum, sometimes termed a &lsquo;hole count,&rsquo; is
invariably obtained in all AEMs if you count for long
enough.
</p>
<p>33 .3 THE REAL SPECTRUM ....................................................................................................................................................................... 609</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>thin films you may be fortunate enough to be studying
such ideal specimens.
</p>
<p>For a quantitative, reproducible measure of the hole
count, you should use a uniform thin specimen, such as
the NiO film we have described. This film should be
supported on a bulk material that has a low-energy
(&lt;�3 keV) L line and a high-energy (&gt;�15 keV) K
line. A thick Mo or Au washer or support grid is ideal.
Any high-energy bremsstrahlung X-rays penetrating
through the C2 diaphragm will strongly fluoresce the
Mo K or Au L line while stray electrons will excite the
Mo L or Au M lines preferentially.
</p>
<p>With thick diaphragms and thin foils, the remaining
stray X-rays will not influence the accuracy of quantifi-
cation or introduce detectable peaks from elements not
in the analysis region. For more details on this test, see
Lyman and Ackland. If you don&rsquo;t want to go to the
trouble of this test, then the least you should do is
measure the in-hole spectrum on your specimen and
subtract it from your experimental spectrum if the hole
spectrum contains peaks with &gt;1% of the counts in the
characteristic peaks that come from your specimen.
</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;veminimized strayX-rays, let&rsquo;s consider
the possibility that all the electrons are not confined to
the beam. Stray electrons will generate a hole spectrum
with a low K/L ratio (the opposite of Figure 33.4B). If
your microscope has a non-beam defining spray dia-
phragm below the C2 diaphragm it will eliminate such
stray electrons without generating unwanted X-rays.
Then the main source of poorly collimated electrons is
usually the &lsquo;tail&rsquo; of electrons around the non-Gaussian-
shaped probe that arises from spherical aberration in
the C2 lens, as shown in Figure 33.5 (Cliff andKenway).
The best way tominimize this effect is to image the beam
on the TEM screen under the conditions that you will
use for analysis, and select the best C2 aperture size to
define the probe, as we discussed way back in Section
5.5. It is a simple test to move your probe closer and
closer to the edge of your specimen and see when you
start generating X-rays. Do this with different size, top-
hat C2 diaphragms. If you are fortunate enough to have
aCs corrector in your probe-forming lens then the probe
will have much smaller tails, but this is a very expensive
solution, not available to all.
</p>
<p>(A)
</p>
<p>(B)
</p>
<p>FIGURE 33.5. (A) The shadow of the C2 diaphragm defines the extent of
</p>
<p>the halo of electrons which excites X-rays well away from the chosen
</p>
<p>analysis region. (B) Ray diagram showing how the STEM probe formed
</p>
<p>with a large C2 aperture generates a broad halo around the intense
</p>
<p>Gaussian-shaped probe. Such beam tailing is the major source of uncolli-
</p>
<p>mated electrons and arises due to spherical aberration in the probe-
</p>
<p>forming lens. Choosing a smaller aperture will limit the tailing but cut
</p>
<p>down the probe current.
</p>
<p>RULE OF THUMB
The ratio ofMoKa orAuLa intensity detected (when
the beam is down the hole) to the Ni Ka intensity
obtained with the beam on the specimen should be
less than 1%.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In summary
</p>
<p>&amp; Stray X-rays will give a high Ag (or Mo) K/L ratio.
&amp; Stray electrons will give a low Ag (orMo) K/L ratio.
&amp; Always operate with clean, thick, top-hat C2
diaphragms.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use very thin flake specimens or uniform thin films,
if possible.
</p>
<p>&amp; Always image the electron beam on the TEM screen
prior to analysis, to insure that it is well collimated
by the C2 aperture.
</p>
<p>&amp; Use a Cs-corrected AEM if you can find one.
</p>
<p>Now the only significant X-ray source will be the
region where you position the probe.
</p>
<p>33.3.B Post-specimen Scatter
</p>
<p>The electrons interact with the specimen and are
scattered elastically or inelastically. It is fortunate
for us that the intensity of such scatter from a thin
specimen is greatest in the forward direction. So
most of the scattered electrons are gathered by the
field of the lower objective polepiece and proceed
into the imaging system of the AEM away from
the XEDS detector. Unfortunately, some electrons
are scattered through high enough angles that they
strike other parts of your specimen, the support grid,
the holder, or the objective lens polepiece or other
material in the AEM stage.
</p>
<p>It is instructive to insert the objective diaphragm
during an analysis (just once!) to see the enormous
increase in spurious and system X-rays that result.
(Actually, you&rsquo;ll do this experiment by mistake any-
way.) Usually the X-ray flux is so great that the pulse-
processing electronics are saturated, the dead time
reaches 100%, and the automatic shutter will activate.
However, even when you remove the diaphragm, elec-
trons scattered by the specimen may still create X-rays
characteristic of the materials in the holder (brass), the
polepiece (Fe and Cu), and the collimator (e.g., Al, W)
and any of these X-rays could be picked up by the
XEDS detector.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, despite the strong field of the upper objec-
tive polepieces in probe-forming STEMs (another good
reason to always operate in STEM mode) some back-
scattered electrons may travel directly into the XEDS
detector, generating electron-hole pairs. Other scattered
electrons may hit your specimen at some point well
away from the area of interest where they will still
produce specimen-characteristic (and therefore) spu-
rious, X-rays. All these possibilities are undesirable but
unavoidable because, without the beam-specimen inter-
actions that produce this scattering, we would get no
information at all from the specimen. Figure 33.6 sum-
marizes all the possible sources of spurious and system
X-rays from post-specimen scatter.
</p>
<p>In addition to electron scatter, there will be a flux of
bremsstrahlung X-rays produced in the specimen. The
intensity of these X-rays is also greatest in the forward
direction (see gray shaded area in Figure 33.6). Since they
possess a full spectrumof energy, the bremsstrahlungwill
fluoresce some characteristic X-rays from any material
that they strike. The easiest way to discern the magnitude
of this problem is to use a uniformly thin foil (such as our
standard NiO film) on a Cu grid. When you position the
probe on the film in the middle of a grid square, many
micrometers from any grid bar, the collected spectrum
will invariably show a Cu peak arising from the grid, as a
</p>
<p>SYSTEM X-RAYS
X-rays that come from parts of the AEM other than
the specimen.
</p>
<p>Cu IS EVERYWHERE
Remember the post-specimen scatter will still gener-
ate specimen-characteristic X-rays remote from the
area of interest, even if a Cu peak is not present.
</p>

<p>result of interactions with electrons or X-rays scattered
by the film.An example of this effect in aCr film is shown
in Figure 33.7. The presence of the Cu peak can be
removed by using a Be grid, since Be Ka X-rays are
much more difficult to detect. However, using Be grids
merely removes the observable effect in the spectrum, not
the cause.
</p>
<p>To minimize the effects of the scattered radiation,
you should keep your specimen close to zero tilt (i.e.,
normal to the beam). If you tilt &lt; �108 then the back-
ground intensity is not measurably increased. Under
these conditions, your specimen will undergo minimum
interaction with both the forward-directed X-rays and
any backscattered electrons. Both of these phenomena
have only a small horizontal component of intensity.
The effects of your specimen interacting with self-
generated X-rays will be further reduced by using speci-
mens, such as evaporated films or window-polished
flakes rather than self-supporting disks, just as we
suggested in the previous section. In self-supporting
disks, the bulk regions will interact more strongly with
the bremsstrahlung. It is not known what fraction of the
post-specimen scatter consists of electrons and what
fraction is X-rays, because this will vary with both speci-
men and microscope conditions. However, there is no
evidence to suggest that this X-ray fluorescence limits
the accuracy of quantitative analyses (which is at best
�3&ndash;5%, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 35).
</p>
<p>In addition to keeping your specimen close to zero tilt,
you can further reduce the effects of post-specimen scat-
ter by surrounding the specimen with low-Z material.
Use of thesematerials will also remove from the spectrum
any characteristic peaks due to the microscope constitu-
ents. Be is the best material for this purpose and, as we
</p>
<p>said right at the beginning of this part of the book, Be
specimen holders and Be support grids are essential for
X-ray analysis. Ideally, all solid surfaces in the micro-
scope stage region that could be struck by scattered
radiation should also be shielded with Be.Unfortunately,
such modifications are rarely available commercially.
</p>
<p>The narrow polepiece gap, required to produce high
probe currents, and the cold finger, used to reduce
hydrocarbon contamination, both tend to increase the
problems associated with post-specimen scatter. In the
ideal AEM, the vacuumwould be such that a cold finger
would not be necessary and the polepiece gap would be
chosen to optimize both the detected peak to back-
ground ratio and the probe current. When an AEM
stage was substantially modified with low-Z material
(e.g., by Lyman et al.) a large reduction in bremsstrah-
lung intensity was reported and X-ray peak to back-
ground ratios were produced that are still unmatched
by most commercial AEMs. We&rsquo;ll discuss this more in
Section 33.5.
</p>
<p>You must note, however, that whatever precautions
you take, the scattered electrons and X-rays, which are
invariably present, result in a specific limitation to X-
ray analysis. (See the below box on this.)
</p>
<p>Obviously then, you must determine the contribu-
tions to the X-ray spectrum from your microscope, and
this is best achieved by inserting a low-Z specimen in the
beam that generates mainly a bremsstrahlung spectrum,
such as an amorphous-carbon film, supported on a Be
grid or a pure B foil. If a spectrum is accumulated for a
substantial period of time (say 10&ndash;20 minutes, or even
over lunch), then in addition to the C or B peak (if your
XEDS can detect them) the various instrumental

<p>FIGURE 33.7. Cu peaks in a spectrum from a thin Cr film on a Cu grid.

<p>Although the beam was many micrometers from the grid, Cu X-rays are

<p>excited by electron scatter from within the specimen, and their intensity
</p>
<p>generally increases with specimen tilt. The Cr escape peak and the Si
</p>
<p>internal-fluorescence peaks are also visible.
</p>
<p>SMALL AND LARGE
If you are seeking small amounts (&lt;2%) of element A
in a specific region of your specimen, and that same
element A is present in large amounts, either else-
where in your specimen or in the microscope stage,
then you cannot unequivocally identify the presence
of that element A in the specific region of your speci-
men! If you count for long enough, a small peak from
A will invariably be present in all spectra, just as
surely as the Si internal-fluorescence peak from
your detector will be present.

<p>contributions to the spectrum should become visible.
Such an &lsquo;instrument spectrum&rsquo; (see Figure 33.8) should
only exhibit the internal-fluorescence peak and possibly
the Au absorption edge from the detector. Any other
peaks will be from the TEM itself, assuming the speci-
men is pure. These peaks will tell you which elements it
is not possible to seek in small quantities in your speci-
men because of their presence in your AEM.
</p>
<p>We can summarize themethods used tominimize the
effects of post-specimen scattering quite simply
</p>
<p>&amp; Always remove the objective diaphragm.
&amp; Operate as close to zero tilt as possible.
&amp; Use a Be specimen holder and Be grids.
&amp; Use thin foils, flakes, or films rather than self-
supporting disks.
</p>
<p>Remember, that even with these precautions, you
will still have to look out for artifacts in the spectrum,
particularly those from the XEDS system.
</p>
<p>33.3.C Coherent Bremsstrahlung
</p>
<p>As we noted earlier, the bremsstrahlung spectrum is
sometimes referred to as the continuum because the
intensity is assumed to be a smooth, slowly varying
function of energy. This assumption is perfectly reason-
able when the bremsstrahlung is generated in bulk poly-
crystalline materials by electrons with energies
&lt;�30 keV, such as in a SEM. However, in thin single-
crystal specimens illuminated by high-energy electrons,
it is possible to generate a bremsstrahlung X-ray spec-
trum that contains small, Gaussian-shaped peaks
known as &lsquo;coherent bremsstrahlung&rsquo; (CB). The phe-
nomenon of CB is well known from high-energy physics
</p>
<p>experiments, but no one thought it would occur at AEM
voltages until it was clearly demonstrated by Reese et al.

<p>from a thin foil of pure copper taken at 120 keV. The
primary peaks, as expected, are the Cu Ka/b and the
L family of lines. In addition, the escape peak is
identified. The other small peaks are the CB peaks.
They arise, as shown in Figure 33.9B, by the nature
of the coulomb interaction of the beam electrons with
the regularly spaced nuclei in the crystal specimen.
As the beam electron proceeds through the lattice,
close to a row of atoms, each bremsstrahlung-produc-
ing event is similar in nature and so the resultant
radiation tends to have the same energy. The regular
interactions result in X-ray photons of energy ECB
given by
</p>
<p>ECB &frac14;
12:4b
</p>
<p>L&eth;1� b cos&eth;90&thorn; a&THORN;&THORN; (33:2)
</p>
<p>where b is the electron velocity (n) divided by the
velocity of light (c), L is the real lattice spacing in
the beam direction, equal to 1/H in a zone-axis
orientation (go back and check Section 21.3.B),
and a is the detector take-off angle. More than one
CB peak arises because different Laue zones give
different values of L. The CB peak intensity seems
greatest when the beam is close to a low-index zone
axis, and these conditions should be avoided if pos-
sible. Operating with a convergent beam reduces the
intensity of the CB peaks and this will be helped
with a Cs-corrected AEM since larger convergence
angles can be used to give more probe current with-
out degrading the probe size.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t remove the CB effects
entirely, even by operating far from a major zone axis,
since some residual peaks are invariably detectable if
you count for long enough.
</p>
<p>As predicted by equation 33.2, the CB peaks will
move depending on both the accelerating voltage
(which will alter v and hence b) and the specimen orien-
tation, which will change the value of L. Of course,
characteristic peaks show no such behavior and are
dependent only on the elements present in your speci-
men.While CB peaks are a problem, you should only be
concerned if you are seeking to detect a small amount of
specific element in your specimen. More about this
problem in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>33.4 MEASURING THE QUALITY OF THE
XEDS-AEM INTERFACE
</p>
<p>In the end, what we need is some measure of how well
our XEDS system is working and to be able to compare
it with values from other systems. There are two ways to
do this, both of which use a thin film, such as our
standard NiO (although in these examples, we&rsquo;ll use
Cr since that was how the original experiments were
done. The principles are the same).
</p>
<p>33.4.A Peak-to-Background Ratio
</p>
<p>The first test of how well your XEDS is interfaced to
your TEM is to measure the peak to background (P/B)
ratio in the film.
</p>
<p>For the Ni Ka peak, you should integrate the peak
intensity from 7.1 to 7.8 keV and divide this by the
average background intensity in a 10 eV window (i.e.,
one or two channels depending on the display resolu-
tion) under the peak. In the Cr thin-film example shown
in Figure 33.10A, the Cr Ka peak is summed from 5.0 to
5.7 keV. In a well-constructed AEM, the P/B ratio will
increase with keV. The P/B values shown in Figure
33.10B (measured again on a Cr film rather than a
NiO film (Zemyan and Williams)) should be achievable
in any modern AEM. This value is an important test of
the XEDS-AEM interface and the design of the stage.
Higher is better!
</p>
<p>33.4.B Efficiency of the XEDS System
</p>
<p>The relative detector efficiency is a measure of howmany
X-ray counts per second (cps) are collected, detected
and processed by the XEDS system. This is very impor-
tant because of the overwhelming need to gather the
most X-ray counts possible, given all that we&rsquo;ve
described about the inherent inefficiencies of X-ray gen-
eration and detection in XEDS of thin films.
</p>
<p>In a fixed live time the detector efficiency will be
affected by the specimen thickness, the probe current,
and the solid angle of collection of the detector. So you
should use the standard NiO specimen again, to fix the
thickness variable and measure the probe current with a
Faraday cup, as we&rsquo;ve mentioned several times before
(this gives cps/nA). Last, you need to factor in the
collection angle given by the XEDS manufacturer
(which is in fact calculated, not measured) to give the
</p>
<p>CB PEAKS
You may mistakenly identify these CB peaks as
characteristic peaks from a small amount of some
element in the specimen, but fortunately, you can
easily distinguish CB peaks from characteristic
peaks.
</p>
<p>FIORI P/B
There are several definitions of P/B ratio, but the
best one, termed the Fiori definition, is shown in
Figure 33.10A.
</p>
<p>614 ....................................................................................................................................................................X-RAY SPECTRA AND IMAGES</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>best figure of merit in terms of cps/nA/sr as described by
Zemyan and Williams. Typical values are shown (again
for Cr) in Figure 33.10C and, as you can see, the effi-
ciency decreases with increasing kV because of the
decrease in ionization cross section. But at any given
kV, a higher number indicates higher efficiency.
</p>
<p>It is possible to determine both the P/B ratio and
the efficiency from direct spectral measurement and
software to do this is described in the companion
text.
</p>
<p>33.5 ACQUIRING X-RAY SPECTRA
</p>
<p>There are many commercial systems for acquiring spec-
tra and images and many of these differ in terms of the
file formats used within the computer system. Conse-
quently, you might find it difficult to exchange spectra
between different XEDS systems (e.g., for comparison
of data gathered on two different AEMs). There has
been a concerted attempt by the various manufacturers
and professional societies to rectify this by creating the
so-called &lsquo;EMSA/MAS standard file format&rsquo; (Egerton
et al.). You should check to ensure that your XEDS
system supports this format.
</p>
<p>So from what we&rsquo;ve told you so far, you now know
what information is likely to be in your spectra; which
peaks might be real, which are most likely artifacts, and
which ones you can and can&rsquo;t interpret as coming from
the analysis region. Now we can concentrate on how
best to actually gather the spectra before proceeding
with analyses.
</p>
<p>33.5.A Spot Mode
</p>
<p>The standard way of gathering spectra, from the earliest
days of AEM (and preceded by SEM/EPMA) was sim-
ply to use the beam deflectors to position the spot on a
feature in your image and switch on the XEDS. We call
this &lsquo;spot mode.&rsquo; You could do this in a TEM by con-
densing the beam down with the C2 lens and adjusting
C1 iteratively until the beam is small enough to interact
only with the feature you wanted to analyze, such as a
precipitate. In STEM spot mode you simply stop the
beam from scanning and move the probe onto the fea-
ture, hoping to get it in the right position before the
image fades from the STEM screen. In either case you
also have to hope that both the probe position and the
feature in your image stay stationary for long enough to
gather a spectrum with sufficient counts to give you the
composition information you need. On vintage AEMs,
this method ensures that any carbon contamination
buildup precisely buries the feature of interest! How-
ever, that same contamination spot would also show
you if the beam or specimen had drifted during the
analysis.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>So spot mode is time consuming, the statistical con-
fidence is appalling, and the pre-selection of which fea-
ture(s) to analyze introduces serious operator bias (and
if you&rsquo;re not careful, all that you might analyze is an
artifact of the specimen preparation rather than a
key microstructural feature). Despite all this, it is still
common to see publications in which this method is
precisely how the analysis was performed and, in terms
</p>
<p>of giving a gross indication of local variations in
chemistry, say for a complex extraction replica contain-
ing multiple phases, it certainly has some benefit, as
shown in Figure 33.11. So, be careful when you build
on someone else&rsquo;s results.
</p>
<p>33.5.B Spectrum-Line Profiles
</p>
<p>A variation of the spot mode of analysis is to take a series
of spot analyses across a linear feature of interest in your
specimen, such as a grain boundary or interphase inter-
face, as shown in Figure 33.12A, and build up a set of
spectra which, when analyzed, will reveal the composi-
tion profile across the interface. The information can be
displayed as a set of superimposed spectra, termed a
spectrum-line profile, as shown in Figure 33.12B, and
the changes in the characteristic-peak intensities reflect
significant composition changes. Since any kind of inter-
face is a major planar defect in an engineering material,
this approach at least removes some of the operator bias
of the single-spot mode. However, line profiles still only
reveal the composition across a single point on the
boundary and many such profiles are required if you
are to determine composition variations along the defect.
So this approach is also tedious.
</p>
<p>The solution to the limitations of both spot and line
profiles approaches is to gather parts of spectra or pre-
ferably full spectra at every pixel in the STEM image,
producing compositional images or maps.
</p>
<p>This method is by far the best way to gather X-ray
information with some semblance of statistical signifi-
cance and without operator bias, so we&rsquo;ll now spend the
rest of the chapter describing this method.
</p>
<p>33.6 ACQUIRING X-RAY IMAGES
</p>
<p>Mapping, or compositional imaging, used to be rarely
used for analysis in the AEM because of the low X-ray
count rate due to the small probe currents and collection
angles. The overall inefficiency of the process meant
that to gather a map with sufficient X-ray counts to be
able to draw any conclusions about the variations in
chemistry in the thin foil, you would have to scan the
area for many hours. During this time, specimen drift,
contamination or damage would occur and the resultant
information would be compromised. However, with the
developments of intermediate-voltage FEG sources,
detectors with higher collection efficiency, drift-
correction software, cleaner stage vacuums, and, most
recently, Cs correctors, it is now possible, on the best
AEMs, to gather quantitative X-ray maps in a matter of
minutes. So it&rsquo;s worth looking at the various imaging
options which have been developed, along with these
improvements in AEM design and computer technol-
ogy. In all of these approaches it will take significant

<p>time to acquire a map and the biggest danger is that the
specimen will drift during that time or the beam current
will change (particularly, if you have a cold-FEG
source). So learn about the drift-correction software
that should be available in any standard commercial
XEDS software package. Unless you can measure the
probe current on the fly in a cold-FEGAEM, a Schottky
FEG is recommended for mapping.
</p>
<p>Analysis of bulk specimens in the SEM or EPMA is
not limited by X-ray counts so the X-ray imaging tech-
niques we&rsquo;ll discuss were generally pioneered on the
SEM/EPMA. Likewise, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 37 and
beyond, EELS measurements have many millions or
even billions of counts and so EELS mapping of thin
films was used long before thin-foil X-ray analysts were
able to benefit. But in this book, we&rsquo;ll rewrite history a
little and talk first about all these techniques in reference
to X-ray mapping.
</p>
<p>33.6.A Analog Dot Mapping
</p>
<p>Dot maps are the original method of acquiring qualita-
tive X-ray images and, somewhat surprisingly, were first
created more than half a century ago by Cosslett and
Duncumb and progress since then has been reviewed by
Friel and Lyman. The approach is simple: you select a
specific energy (or wavelength) channel (or a window
(range) of channels) in your X-ray spectrum, scan the
beam across the area of interest and when the X-ray
detector registers an X-ray of the selected energy
(range), record and display it. So as the beam scans,
the display intensity builds up and the changes in inten-
sity reflect the changes in the number of X-rays detected.
For example, if you select the Pd La peak channel or a
window covering the peak, then regions showing lots
of dots on the screen are high in Pd, as shown in
Figure 33.13 (we&rsquo;ll go into more detail about how to
do this in Section 34.7). This qualitative, analog

<p>approach is not directly quantifiable since the back-
ground can&rsquo;t be removed, unless you simultaneously
gather a dot map from a bremsstrahlung window adja-
cent to the peak window and subtract the one from the
other (more about this in Chapter 35). Furthermore, in
thin foils, changes in thickness will also produce changes
in intensity in both the peak and background maps and
this is clear in Figure 33.13B. It is possible to refine this
approach by gathering multiple X-ray maps, assigning
colors to different X-rays, and overlaying the maps to
give an indication of relative composition changes.
Again, this process is not quantitative.
</p>
<p>33.6.B Digital Mapping
</p>
<p>As computers became more powerful, it was possible to
collect X-rays from multiple channels or windows and
thus acquire several maps simultaneously. If one or more
of the maps was the bremsstrahlung intensity then you
could produce quantitative maps, on the fly, as the data
accumulates. The first success in digitizing thin-foil X-ray
maps was carried out by Hunneyball et al. almost 30
years ago. It was only possible to build up 128�128
pixel images with 256 X-ray counts at each pixel using a
100-nm probe with 5 nA of probe current over 200s. But
the maps were fully quantitative, removed the effects of
foil-thickness variation, and revealed relatively small
composition variations around GBs in aged Al alloys,
as shown in Figure 33.14A. Because of the central role of
the computer in the acquisition, this approach has the
advantage of post-acquisition processing and compari-
son of different quantification routines.
</p>
<p>Also after acquisition it was possible to use such
processing techniques as false coloring, computerized
image overlays, scatter diagrams, etc. (Bright and New-
bury). All these advantages combine to make digital
imaging a most attractive approach for displaying
XEDS data. This process really came of age in the
mid-1990s with the availability of faster computers,
improved data storage, intermediate-voltage FEG
sources, reasonable X-ray collection angles, and stable
AEMs permitting long collection times without drift.
An example from such an AEM is shown in Figure
33.14B which is 256�256 pixels and was acquired
using a 1-nm probe with 0.9 nA of current for 5400 s.
Comparing Figure 33.14A and B is instructive and

<p>shows the enormous progress in both the quality of
mapping and the spatial resolution. Once you have a
digital map such as this you can go into the map and
extract quantitative data from any region, e.g., the line
profile taken across the GB in Figure 33.14C. However,
you still have to select the window(s) or peak(s) in the
spectrum that you map, thus introducing your own bias
in terms of what you expect to be in the specimen.
Furthermore, once the map is recorded and stored, you
cannot return to re-check the data, or map another ele-
ment from the same area, since all the other information
in the spectrum was lost. Likewise, unless you store the
image from the mapped area, it too cannot be re-exam-
ined. So you have to get everything right, collect all theX-
ray images you need, as well as the background spectra to
permit subsequent quantification. Gathering multiple
maps was limited by the computer memory, but that is
no longer a problem since memory is cheap. Now, as we
discuss below, you don&rsquo;t even have to bother about pre-
selecting which X-rays you want to map, you just gather
them all and later on decide which you want to image.
How do we do this? It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;spectrum imaging.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>33.6.C Spectrum Imaging (SI)
</p>
<p>As the term implies, SI collects a full spectrum at every
pixel in the digital image (so you can only do this in
STEM mode (although there are analog versions in
energy-filtered TEM, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter 39)). The
result of the SI process is a 3D data cube, as shown in
Figure 33.15A, with the electron image constituting the
x&ndash;y plane and all theXEDS spectra in the z direction. The
SI termwas first used for EELS in the late 1980s andwe&rsquo;ll
mention this topic again in Chapter 37. Only much later
did SI became feasible for X-ray mapping although it is
now common enough to be used in materials problem
solving (e.g., Wittig et al.). On a historical note, you
should be aware that SI methods have been practiced in
other fields, such as radio astronomy for several decades
and, indeed, Legge and Hammond took the output of
their EDS andWDS spectrometers and synchronized the

<p>detectors&rsquo; output pulses with the position of the beam 30
years ago. They collected the data on magnetic tape, and
later reconstructed the data into a 3D file, so it can be
argued that this was the first demonstration of the SI
concept, at least in electron-beam instruments, so we
aren&rsquo;t really revising the historical record!
</p>
<p>The beauty of the SI technique is that, once you have
this data cube stored, you can go back to it at any time,
recheck the data, and re-do any analysis, search for
other spectral features that you might not originally
have thought present or important, look at different
images at different energies, and yet always have the
original image and spectra at your disposal.
</p>
<p>If you think about the diagram in Figure 33.15A,
you&rsquo;ll see that there are many ways to slice and dice the
data cube which reproduce all the other methods of
analysis that we&rsquo;ve described. If you select a single
pixel in the x&ndash;y (image) plane, then there is a full spec-
trum attached to it and so, if you wish, you can select a
set of individual pixels and do as many spot analyses as
you wish. Likewise, you can select a line of pixels in the
image, effectively slicing the cube along the x&ndash;z, y&ndash;z, or
some combination of these directions and thus produce
spectrum-line profiles. You can (and this is where it gets
really useful) slice the cube at any plane in the z (labeled
E for energy) direction and, at each plane, you&rsquo;ll get a
different image consisting of X-rays of that particular
energy. You can add planes, subtract planes, and sum
image pixels only in certain features (e.g., a strangely
shaped precipitate or along a boundary plane). You can
also envisage gathering spectra at certain pixels as a
function of time (chrono-spectrometry?) and there are
surely other options which you can think of. Now if you
do the math and consider a 1 k � 1 k pixel image with a
2048-channel spectrum at each pixel, you&rsquo;ll find that the
data cube is about 2GB in size. In fact, in gathering such
an enormous amount of data, the bigger challenge is to
find ways both to search this enormous database effi-
ciently and extract meaningful data. Various advanced
software methods, such as multivariate statistical analy-
sis, principal-component analysis, and maximum-pixel
spectrum analysis are available to remove noise and
extract rare events from the data cube. Such processes
are closely related to the parameterizing of HRTEM
images discussed in Chapter 31, and are discussed in
far more detail in the companion text.
</p>
<p>Just to give you a hint of what can be done, Figure
33.15B shows a series of X-ray images cutting the x&ndash;y
plane at different energy values, displayed &lsquo;behind&rsquo; the
original STEM (E = 0) image. If we select a single x&ndash;y
plane such as that at the Nb Ka line energy (Figure
33.15C), that image is very noisy because of the limited
signal captured in that one plane. However, we can use
sophisticated software to remove all the noise compo-
nents in the plane and also add in all the other Nb
signals from other energy planes to produce the image
showing the Nb distribution (Figure 33.15D). Before
you think that such an extraordinary change is unrea-
sonable and that information is being created where it
did not exist, compare the processed image (D) with the
original STEM electron image (the top slice in B).
Clearly the small matrix precipitates that are imaged in
(A) are also mapped in (D). Extracting information like
this from the SI data cube tells you how much more
powerful the SI approach is compared with spot or line-
profile analyses. Now it is routine to gather both XES
and EELS SI simultaneously, thus completely optimiz-
ing the acquisition of analytical data.
</p>
<p>33.6.D Position-Tagged Spectrometry (PTS)
</p>
<p>PTS is a specific commercial version of generic SI,
developed by Mott and Friel at Princeton Gamma
Tech (PGT, now Bruker AXS). PTS eliminates the con-
flict between your wishing to view full X-ray images
quickly versus the analytical advantages of having com-
plete spectra saved at each pixel (which even on the best
AEMs still takes 30&ndash;45 minutes if you want to quantify
the data). In PTS, the beam is scanned rapidly relative to
traditional mapping, and the X-rays are counted in the
analysis computer, preserving both spatial information
from the image and spectral information. Sophisticated
processing software can be used to interrogate the data
during acquisition, which is not possible in conventional
SI. Alternatively, this software can be used after the
complete spectrum is stored, as with conventional SI,
where you acquire the full spectrum at a single pixel and
then move to the next pixel and gather another spec-
trum. PTS also permits relatively easy monitoring of
such phenomena as specimen drift, contamination, or
damage during the acquisition.

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
XEDS in the AEM is a challenge because the detection/processing system creates artifact
peaks in the spectrum and X-rays are generated and detected from sources in the AEM
other than the region of your specimen where you put the beam. Nevertheless, there are
well-defined precautions you can take so that you are sure that the artifacts, the spurious
and system X-rays are minimized and that your subsequent interpretation and quantifica-
tion are not compromised. There are also several standard tests you can carry out to
compare your AEM system performance with other instruments.

<p>In summary, to understand your AEM and to acquire meaningful spectra, you should
&amp; Buy your own NiO standard thin film on a Mo grid.
&amp; Test your XEDS to determine the artifact peaks that it produces.
&amp; Gather a spectrum down a hole in the NiO film to see what spurious X-rays the AEM
illumination system produces. Use top-hat C2 apertures at all times.
</p>
<p>&amp; Gather an XEDS spectrum from a light-element film to see what system peaks your
AEM introduces into the spectrum. Use thin foils, flakes, or films rather than self-
supporting disks if possible.
</p>
<p>&amp; Be aware of CB if you count for a long time to detect small peaks from trace elements.
&amp; Image the electron beam on the TEM screen to ensure that it is Gaussian.
&amp; Always remove the objective diaphragm.
&amp; Operate with the specimen as close to zero tilt as possible.
</p>
<p>Check that
</p>
<p>&amp; The hole count is &lt;1% of your experimental spectrum under the same operating
conditions.
</p>
<p>&amp; The P/B ratio and the detector efficiency data are acceptable and do not change with
time.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you&rsquo;re looking for characteristic peaks from trace orminor elements in your specimen,
understand that such peaks are much more likely to be confused with artifacts or system
peaks (much more about this in the next chapter).
</p>
<p>Once you are sure of what&rsquo;s in your spectrum, decide whether you want to do quick and
dirty point analyses of some features in your image or, if you are confident of the importance
of the area that you want to analyze completely, gather X-ray maps or, ideally, acquire a SI
data cube which will really give you the full picture of your specimen composition.

</p>
<p>Qualitative X-ray Analysis and Imaging
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>It is a waste of time to proceed with quantitative analysis of your XEDS spectrum or image
without first carrying out qualitative analysis. Qualitative analysis requires that every peak
in the spectrum be identified unambiguously, with statistical certainty, otherwise it should
be ignored for both subsequent quantitative analysis and imaging. We emphasize this point
because of the many opportunities for the misidentification of small peaks in the spectrum.
In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll deal initially with acquisition and identification of the elemental
information in spectra and images. First, we will show you how to choose the best operating
conditions for your particular AEM and XEDS system. Then we&rsquo;ll explain the best way to
obtain a spectrum for qualitative analysis. You have to acquire a spectrum with sufficient
X-ray counts to allow you to draw the right conclusions with a given degree of confidence.
There are a few simple rules to follow which allow you to do this.
</p>
<p>Two advantages are gained from rigorous qualitative analysis. First, you may be able to
solve the analytical problem at hand without needing to perform full quantification.
Second, when quantification is carried out (see the next chapter), you will not spend an
inordinate amount of time analyzing an element that isn&rsquo;t there, and you can be confident
that your results are valid.We&rsquo;ll go over themany ways tomisidentify peaks in your spectra,
particularly small ones, which may, in fact, arise from important trace elements but, which
might be artifacts, could be peaks from another element, or are possibly statistically
insignificant. Commercial peak-identification software, while improving all the time, is
not error-free. We&rsquo;ll end with a few words about qualitative X-ray imaging.
</p>
<p>34.1 MICROSCOPE AND SPECIMEN
VARIABLES
</p>
<p>When you first acquire a spectrum, the operating con-
ditions should maximize the X-ray count rate to give
you sufficient intensity in the characteristic peaks in
your spectrum, in the shortest time, with the minimum
number of artifacts. You need sufficient counts so you
can detect, unambiguously, the presence of all the ele-
ments in your specimen (within the limitations of your
XEDS detector) with statistical certainty. As we&rsquo;ll
explain, the best conditions for such qualitative analyses
require that you obtain the spectrum from a reasonably
thick, large area of your specimen, using a large probe
and a large aperture to give the most current, but in
doing this you&rsquo;ll compromise other desirable analysis
</p>
<p>qualities, particularly high spatial resolution. So right
up front you need to know two key points
</p>
<p>&amp; There are only three requirements for good qualita-
tive analyses; counts, counts and more counts
</p>
<p>&amp; The conditions for the best qualitative (and quanti-
tative) analysis (which are also those that give the
best analytical sensitivity) are precisely the worst for
obtaining the best spatial resolution.
</p>
<p>A more complicated factor in getting the most X-ray
counts in your spectrum is choosing the right operating
voltage. Remember, back in Figure 33.10.C, we showed
that you get a higher detection and collection efficiency
if you decrease the kV because the scattering cross sec-
tion (s) increases when the kV decreases; that was a
specimen effect. Now we are talking about a gun effect;
</p>
<p>A QUALITATIVE MUST!
Although such an approach may seem time-consuming and unnecessarily tedious, the
need for initial qualitative analysis of the spectrum cannot be stressed too strongly.
</p>
<p>34 .1 M I CROSCOPE AND SPEC IMEN VAR IABLE S ................................................................................................................................... 625</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>as the kV increases, the gun brightness increases (go back
and check this in Chapter 5). While the two effects coun-
ter each other somewhat, the added advantage of an
increased P/B ratio (which helps with detecting small
peaks) with higher kV, as well as improved spatial resolu-
tion (due to less beam spreading), tips the scales in favor
of using the maximum kV at all times. Only choose a
lower voltage if knock-on damage is a problem, as might
be the case, for example, in a 200&ndash;400 kV AEM with a
beam-sensitive specimen such as a ceramic, a mineral,
most semiconductors or a low-Z (&lt;15) metal/alloy.
</p>
<p>Pick a portion of your specimen that is single phase in
the area of interest and make sure it is tilted well away
from strong diffraction conditions to minimize crystal-
lographic effects (more on this in Chapter 35) and coher-
ent bremsstrahlung. Ideally, you will need a probe
current of several tens of nanoamps. The necessary com-
bination of probe size and final aperture depends on the
type of source in your AEM. To get several tens of
nanoamps from a LaB6 source, you have to select a
relatively large probe size, say, a few tens of nanometers
and a large C2 aperture. An FEG source will give much
less total current than a thermionic source and it won&rsquo;t be
possible to generate more than a few nanoamps at best.
So, for reasonable qualitative analysis and subsequent
quantitative analysis, you&rsquo;ll have to accumulate your
spectrum for a longer time with an FEG compared to a
thermionic source. A Cs-corrector on your FEG-AEM
will help tremendously, since a larger probe-forming
aperture can be used without compromising the quality
of the probe, and tens of nanoamps can be generated in a
Cs-corrected probe of a couple of nanometers dimension.
So if your institution has enoughmoney to spend on your
AEMyou canminimize the otherwise necessary compro-
mise between needing lots of counts and getting high
spatial resolution
</p>
<p>You can always gather more counts in your spec-
trum by choosing a thicker region of the specimen.
There is nothing wrong with doing this when you are
carrying out qualitative analysis. A thick specimen
degrades your spatial resolution, but we&rsquo;ve already
agreed to compromise that aspect of the analysis during
this initial qualitative procedure. The only danger is
that, if you are interested in finding a few weight percent
of a light element, those weak X-rays may be absorbed
in your specimen and so may not be detected. However,
from an experimental standpoint, having carried out
qualitative analysis of a relatively large, thick region,
you can always do further analyses of smaller, thinner
areas, under conditions that optimize spatial resolution,
which we&rsquo;ll discuss in Chapter 36.
</p>
<p>Remember that we have been talking about several
different &lsquo;resolutions&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t confuse them
</p>
<p>&amp; spatial resolution: distances measured in nm (see
Chapter 36).
</p>
<p>&amp; chemical resolution: analytical sensitivity/detection
limits depending on P/B (see Chapter 36).
</p>
<p>&amp; energy resolution: identifying elements by distin-
guishing their spectral peaks at different energies
(see this chapter and Chapter 33).
</p>
<p>So, just in case you haven&rsquo;t got the message by now,
goodqualitative analysis (and subsequent quantification)
requires a large number of X-ray counts in the spectrum
(just how many we&rsquo;ll tell you in a while). These counts
might take a long time to generate, so you run the danger
of damaging, or changing the chemistry of any beam-
sensitive specimens. You may also contaminate your
chosen area if your AEM is not UHV and/or your speci-
men is not clean. So it&rsquo;s always good to use a plasma
cleaner before analysis, unless doing so will destroy your
specimen. (Go and check Chapter 10 or the companion
text where we talk about specimen preparation.) Tomini-
mize damage and contamination, you should spread the
beam over as large an area as possible, either by over-
focusing C2 if you&rsquo;re in TEM mode or by rastering the
beam in STEM mode, remembering that, in doing so,
your analysis will be an average over the chosen area. Use
a liquid-N2 cooled, low-background holder, especially if
contamination is still a problem.
</p>
<p>34.2 BASIC ACQUISITION
REQUIREMENTS: COUNTS, COUNTS,
AND MORE CAFFEINE
</p>
<p>The first and most important step in qualitative analysis
is to acquire a spectrum across the completeX-ray energy
range. Analysis can often be accomplished using X-rays
with energies from � 1 to10 keV, and this is the typical
range used in the SEM. However, the TEM has a much
higher accelerating voltage, and the consequent increase
in available overvoltage (remind yourself what this is.
Hint: see Chapter 4) means that you can easily generate
and detect much higher-energy X-rays. If you are using
an intermediate-voltage AEM and a windowless IG
detector, we noted in Chapter 32 that all the possible
Ka lines from all the elements above Be in the periodic
table can be detected.
</p>
<p>Of course, if you know the specimen you are analyz-
ing, such a stepmay not seem essential, but it is still a wise
initial precaution since unanticipated contaminants or
trace impurities may be present. The next steps are the
basics for acquiring a spectrum for qualitative analysis
</p>
<p>ENERGY RANGE
The first thing to do is to adjust your computer dis-
play to the widest possible energy range. For a Si(Li)
detector or an SDD, 0&ndash;40 keV is sufficient and for an
IG detector, 0&ndash;80 keV may be more useful.
</p>
<p>626 .................................................................................................................................... QUAL ITAT IVE X-RAY ANALYS I S AND IMAGING</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Collect a spectrum over, say, 0&ndash;40 keV for several
hundred seconds (take a coffee break) and ascertain
the actual energy range over which all the detectable
characteristic peaks occur.
</p>
<p>&amp; If all the peaks that you can see are present in an
energy range &lt; 40 keV, re-gather the spectrum
over that reduced range (take another coffee
break), thereby improving the resolution of the
computer display by lowering the number of eV
per channel.
</p>
<p>&amp; The spectrum that you finally gather for qualitative
analysis must be displayed with no more than 10 eV
per channel resolution or better. A display range of
0&ndash;20 keV should be possible under these conditions
(i.e., 2048 channels in total) in all but the most
ancient of XEDS computer systems.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you have analog processing electronics, you can
increase the counts in your spectrum by reducing the
detector time constant to maximize the throughput.
This step degrades the energy resolution of the
XEDS but, for many qualitative analyses, this is
not important. A digital system will automatically
optimize the throughput of counts.
</p>
<p>&amp; Watch the dead-time readout while acquiring the
spectrum to make sure you haven&rsquo;t chosen a combi-
nation of probe current and specimen thickness that
overloads the detector electronics. Remember that
you want to keep the dead time below about
50&ndash;60%, and an output count rate of around 10
kcps (analog) to 30 kcps (digital) is about the best
that can be handled by current detector electronics
under these conditions. This will rarely be a problem
in thin-foil analysis!
</p>
<p>&amp; The total counts in this qualitative spectrum
should exceed 1,000,000 over the full energy
range. While this may seem a lot, at 3 kcps, it will
take you just over 15 minutes to accumulate this
number of counts (now it&rsquo;s probably time for a
bathroom break, anyhow). So adjust the probe
size/current, the size of the C2 diaphragm and (if
possible) the specimen thickness until the count
rate is sufficient.
</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve got a good high-count spectrum over a
suitable energy range, there is a well-defined sequence of
steps developed for analysis of spectra from the SEM
(see Goldstein et al. as usual) that should be followed to
ensure that you correctly identify each peak in the spec-
trum and disregard those peaks that are artifacts or are
not statistically significant and we&rsquo;ll describe a modified
form of this procedure for thin-foil specimens in the next
section.
</p>
<p>Figure 34.1 shows the effects of increasing acquisi-
tion time (i.e., increasing counts) on the visibility of
small peaks. The longer the time, the better the quality
of the spectrum. So coffee breaks can be very beneficial.
</p>
<p>34.3 PEAK IDENTIFICATION
</p>
<p>There are four key steps to running a successful quali-
tative analysis.
</p>
<p>First: let&rsquo;s assume that you have read, understood,
and applied the contents of Chapters 32 and 33. So you
know what artifacts are likely to arise from your XEDS
system and what system peaks occur in your AEM and
you&rsquo;re aware of CB, etc. Now, ensure that the computer
display is calibrated to be as accurate as the display
resolution, over the energy range you&rsquo;ve selected. If
your spectrum is displayed at 10 eV per channel, the
characteristic peak centroids must all be within �10 eV
of their true position on the energy scale.
</p>
<p>Second: the computer system can be used to run an
automatic identification check on the peaks in the spec-
trum, assuming the energy display is well calibrated. If
the spectrum is simple, containing a few well-separated
peaks, this automatic step may be all that is required.
However, as we&rsquo;ll discuss in Section 34.5, misidentifica-
tion occasionally occurs during such an &lsquo;auto-search&rsquo; or
&lsquo;peak ID&rsquo; software routine. The more complex the spec-
trum, the more likely this is to happen, e.g., if the
spectrum contains many peaks, particularly if peak
overlap is occurring (e.g., Zn La confused with Na Ka)
or if the spectrum contains complex peak families from
heavier and/or rarer elements (e.g., Ta Ma confused
with Si Ka). This problem is exacerbated if you don&rsquo;t
understand the complexities of X-ray families or don&rsquo;t
follow all the precautions that we&rsquo;ll go through below.
In addition, even in the best software, small peaks may
sometimes be missed and phenomena such as CB are
often not taken into account.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Remember, each X-ray is emitted with a very well-
defined line energy (� 1&ndash;5 eV wide) but the XEDS
system degrades the line to a broad peak (FWHM
� 80&ndash;180 eV over the energy range detected by a typical
Si(Li) detector). So we&rsquo;ll talk about peaks in the spec-
trum, which correspond to X-ray lines emitted from
specific elements and which are identified as belonging
to families of lines that are superimposed by the com-
puter software on the displayed spectrum.
</p>
<p>Third: go back to Chapter 4 and remind yourself
about things like critical ionization energy, X-ray line
energy, K, L, M families of X-ray lines, relative weights
of lines, fluorescence yield, etc., because we&rsquo;re assuming
you know all of this backwards.
</p>
<p>Our peak analysis will always include the following
steps
</p>
<p>&amp; Look first at the most intense peak since this should
be easiest to identify as a K, L, or Ma peak; then
work on down through the associated family lines. If
you can&rsquo;t identify the most intense peak easily then
you&rsquo;ve got a problem; e.g., the calibration is off or
the electronics or software are not functioning cor-
rectly, so it&rsquo;s time to ask for technical help and go for
yet more coffee.
</p>
<p>&amp; The most intense peak is also the most likely to have
associated artifacts, such as an escape peak (1.74 keV
below that peak energy in a Si(Li) system) and a sum
peak (at twice the peak energy), so you can quickly
remove such small peaks from the unknown list
(most software now automatically notes the energy
where these artifact peaks should appear).
</p>
<p>&amp; Go to the next most intense peak not included in the
above step and repeat the search. Then repeat this
exercise until all peaks are identified.
</p>
<p>&amp; Always think about pathological overlaps; look for
spurious peaks, system peaks, and artifact peaks.
</p>
<p>Fourth: the bookkeeping; in choosing the possible K,
L, or M lines that could be present at a specific energy,
you can either use the computer-generated X-ray line
markers on the display or consult an appropriate source
such as the &lsquo;slide rules&rsquo; offered by most commercial
manufacturers, or find them on the Web at, e.g.,
URLs 1 and 2. We introduced DTSA in Chapter 33
and it is great for comparing simulated spectra with
acquired spectra, as well as for checking the specific
energies of X-ray lines, particularly in the more complex
families of lines in spectra from heavier elements.
There&rsquo;s much more about DTSA in the companion text.
</p>
<p>Good bookkeeping is essential during the identifica-
tion sequence we will now describe, particularly if your
spectrum contains many peaks.
</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve outlined the principles, let&rsquo;s get down
to the specifics. Follow this 8-step process
</p>
<p>1. If a Ka line matches the peak, look for the Kb line
which has about�10% of the Ka intensity (this 10%
is a line &lsquo;weight&rsquo;; go back and check Table 4.1). With
amodernXEDS, theKb linemust be present at X-ray
energies above �1.74 keV (Si Ka), so long as it is not
overlapped by a more intense peak from another
element. Below this energy, your detector may not
be able to resolve the two lines.
</p>
<p>2. If a Ka and Kb pair fits the peaks and the Ka energy
is &gt; � 8 keV (NiKa), look for the L lines at
� 0.9 keV if you are using a Be-window detector.
For an UTW/windowless detector the La lines from
Cl and above (&gt; � 0.2 keV) may be detectable but
only if there&rsquo;s a lot of Cl, because (a) these rela-
tively weak X-rays will be strongly absorbed and
(b) their fluorescence yield is pretty abysmal.
Ni La=849 eV, Cl La=200 eV.
</p>
<p>3. If a Ka line does not fit, check for an La orMa line fit
since these are the most intense lines in the L and M
families.
</p>
<p>4. If an La line fits, theremust be accompanying lines in
the L family. The number of visible lines will vary
depending on the intensity and energy of the La line,
withmore lines resolvable at higher line energies. The
other lines in the family are all of lower intensity than
the La line, and the following lines may be detectable
(the number in parentheses is the weight relative to
the La line); Lb1 (0.7), Lb2 (0.2), and Lg1 (0.08) lines at
higher energies and possibly the Ll (0.04) line at lower
energy. Other, even less intense, lines (Lg3 (0.03) and
LZ (0.01)) may be visible if the L family is extraordi-
narily intense, but this is rare.
</p>
<p>5. If the L lines fit, theremust be a higher energy Ka/Kb
pair, since the AEM beam energy is usually sufficient
(&gt; 200 keV) to generate the K lines from all the
elements in the periodic table. Make sure you choose
a broad enough energy range to display them on your
computer.
</p>
<p>6. The M lines are usually only visible for elements
above La in the periodic table if a Be-window detec-
tor is used, and above about Nb, if a UTWdetector is
used. Again there has to be a lot of Nb to pick up the
weak M line. LaMa=833 eV, NbMa=202 eV.
</p>
<p>THE KEY
For good qualitative analysis be suspicious. Don&rsquo;t
just seek the peaks you expect, but be prepared to
find peaks that you don&rsquo;t expect.
</p>
<p>LABEL THE PEAKS
Take care to label each peak on the computer display
or note it in your lab notebook when you have
decided which element it comes from.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7. TheMa/Mb line overlap is difficult to resolve because
all theM lines are&lt; 4 keV. If anMa/Mb line fits, look
for three very small lines Mz (0.06), Mg (0.05), and
MIINIV (0.01) lines, which will bemore visible if more
of the element is present.
</p>
<p>8. If the Ma line fits there must be a higher energy L line
family and possibly the very high energy K lines may
</p>
<p>be detectable; again, this depends on the detector (IG
is better for high kV lines), computer display (out to�
80 keV), and the accelerating voltage (higher is better).
</p>
<p>Figure 34.2 shows the families of lines expected in
the display range from 0 to 20 keV, giving you some idea
of the distribution of families of elemental lines that you

<p>should find when you follow the procedure outlined
above. For example, you can see for which elements
you should expect to see only a single K line or resolve
the Ka/Kb pair, and for which elements you should
expect to see both K and L families or L andM families.
</p>
<p>Reasons for a missing family member
</p>
<p>&amp; It may be overlapped by another peak. This is the
most likely cause and you can possibly resolve it by
</p>
<p>(a) re-gathering the spectrum with a longer time
constant (analog system only)
</p>
<p>(b) using peak deconvolution software (see Section
34.4)
</p>
<p>(c) using a higher-resolution technique, such as
EELS (see Chapter 38)
</p>
<p>&amp; Your computer display range may be too small so
the peak is cut off (easy to solve, although if you
followed our instructions this should never happen)
</p>
<p>&amp; The keV of the beam is too low to excite the line
(should never be a problem in an AEM, only in an
SEM)
</p>
<p>Repeat the exercise: Go to the next most-intense
peak that has not been identified by the eight steps in
the first search. Continue this process until all the major
peaks are accounted for. As you go, remember again to
look for the escape peak(s) and sum peak associated
with each major characteristic peak that you have con-
clusively identified. However, these artifacts and any
CB peaks will be very small and before you worry
about them you should make sure that the small peaks
are statistically significant and we discuss how to do this
for all minor peaks in Section 34.5 below. If you have a
Si(Li) detector you&rsquo;ll always find a small Si-K internal-
fluorescence peak, the Si escape peaks will lie at
1.74 keV below major peaks in the spectrum, and will
not occur for elements below phosphorus. For an IG
detector there will be Ge internal-fluorescence peaks
(possible K and L) and there may be both GeK and L
line escape peaks at the appropriate energy below major
peaks (9.89 keV for the GeKa escape and 1.19 keV for
the GeLa escape). If you suspect a sum peak at twice the
energy of any major peaks then re-acquire the spectrum
at a much lower dead-time (&lt; 20%) and see if the sus-
pected sum peak disappears. If you suspect a CB peak
then re-acquire the spectrum at a different accelerating
voltage or specimen orientation and see if the small
peak shifts.
</p>
<p>Check for special cases: The relatively poor energy
resolution of the XEDS detector means that there are
several pairs of peaks that occur quite commonly in
materials science specimens that cannot be resolved.
These go by the delightful name of &lsquo;pathological over-
laps&rsquo; and include, inter alia
</p>
<p>(a) the Kb and Ka lines of neighboring transition
metals, particularly Ti/V, V/Cr, Mn/Fe, and Fe/Co
</p>
<p>(b) the Ba La line (4.47 keV) and the Ti Ka line
(4.51 keV)
</p>
<p>(c) the Pb Ma (2.35 keV), Mo La (2.29 keV), and S Ka
(2.31 keV) lines
</p>
<p>(d) the Ti, V, and Cr La lines (0.45&ndash;0.57 keV) and the K
lines of N (0.39 keV) and O (0.52 keV) detected in
UTW/ATW or windowless XEDS systems.
</p>
<p>These problems can often be solved by careful choice
of the energy range on the computer display. For exam-
ple, if you are only observing from 0 to 10 keV the S K/
Mo L line overlap would be clarified by the presence or
absence of the Mo K lines around 18 keV which, again,
you should have seen in your first, broad energy-range,
spectrum acquisition. If you suspect that any patholog-
ical peak overlaps are occurring in your spectrum, then
re-gather under conditions that maximize the energy
resolution of the detector system (i.e., longest (analog)
time constant and low count rate (&lt; 5 kcps)), and also
maximize the display resolution to at most 5 eV per
channel (you&rsquo;ll need more coffee).
</p>
<p>34.4 PEAK DECONVOLUTION
</p>
<p>If the overlap is still not resolvable, then you should run
a peak deconvolution routine in your computer soft-
ware (these are pretty standard and not much has
changed since; see, e.g., Schamber 1981). Such routines
are capable of detecting and resolving many of the
classic materials science overlaps, such as the transition
metal L lines and low-ZK lines and an example of such
a deconvolution is shown in Figure 34.3.
</p>
<p>In addition to deconvoluting any peak overlaps, it
can be very useful to deconvolute the point-spread func-
tion of the XEDS detection system using a process
called zero-peak deconvolution (which is analogous to
the zero-loss peak deconvolution process used in EELS
(Sections 37.5.A and 39.6)). Such a process is becoming
increasingly popular in many imaging and spectroscopy
techniques because of the development of various
robust mathematical procedures (e.g., Janssen 1997)
</p>
<p>FAMILIES OF PEAKS

missing your identification may be wrong.
</p>

when you know they are both there.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>some of which are described in the companion text. In
effect, this deconvolution removes the electronic-noise
component of the characteristic peak width, giving a
spectrum with nearer to noise-free resolution (Wata-
nabe and Williams). This process requires that your
XEDS system must display the noise peak at 0 eV in
the spectrum (which not all manufacturers do) and this
is called the &lsquo;strobe peak&rsquo;. An iterative process can, in
effect, remove the noise in your spectrum. As shown in
Figure 34.4, this process obviously improves energy
resolution but also improves the P/B ratio (and thus
the minimum detection limit, as we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter
36) and can reveal peaks that would otherwise be
masked by adjacent, more-intense, peaks.
</p>
<p>Now, you always have to be careful with deconvolu-
tion, since any mathematical manipulation can intro-
duce its own artifacts, while otherwise improving the
spectrum quality. So it&rsquo;s best to practice deconvolution
on both simple and complicated spectra that you know
and understand well, until you feel confident that you
understand the strengths and limitations of the proce-
dure available in your particular software package.
</p>
<p>Given all these steps and the multiple decisions that
you have to make, it&rsquo;s clear that qualitative analysis can

<p>most experienced analyst. This complexity is one reason
why even the best software gets it wrong sometimes (see
Section 34.6). So, as we said at the start, be suspicious!
</p>
<p>In summary, applying the 8-step process, with
appropriate deconvolution where needed, should per-
mit you to identify all the major peaks in your spectrum.
There might still be minor peaks, which may or may not
be statistically significant, and you have to decide
whether you are going to identify or ignore these
peaks. Now we&rsquo;ll tell you how to make this decision.
</p>
<p>34.5 PEAK VISIBILITY
</p>
<p>Small intensity fluctuations are often present in your
spectrum that you cannot clearly identify as peaks.
In this case, there is a simple statistical criterion
(Liebhafsky et al.) that you can apply to ascertain if
the peak is statistically significant or if it can be dis-
missed as random noise. You must count for a long
enough time so that the bremsstrahlung intensity is
smooth and any peaks are clearly visible, as summarized
in Figure 34.5.
</p>
<p>&amp; Increase the display gain until the average back-
ground intensity is half the total full scale of the
display, so the small peaks are more easily observed.
</p>
<p>&amp; Get the computer to draw a line under the peak to
separate the peak and background counts.
</p>
<p>&amp; Integrate the peak (IA) and background (&eth;IbA))
counts over the same number of channels; use
FWHM if it can be discerned with any confidence;
if not, then the whole peak integral will do.
</p>
<p>If IA43
</p>
<p>ffiffiffiffiffi
</p>
<p>I bA
</p>
<p>q
</p>
<p>then the peak is statistically signifi-
</p>
<p>cant at the 99% confidence limit and must be
identified. Remember, you&rsquo;ll still make an erro-
neous peak identification in � 1% of analyses
using this criterion; just hope it isn&rsquo;t the one that
derails your PhD or gets you fired!
</p>
<p>If IA53
</p>
<p>ffiffiffiffiffi
</p>
<p>I bA
</p>
<p>q
</p>
<p>then the peak is not significant and
should be ignored.
</p>
<p>If the insignificant peak is at an energy where you
expect a peak to be present, but you think there is only a
small amount of the suspected element in your speci-
men, then count for a longer time to see if the statistical
criterion can be satisfied in a reasonable length of time.
If this peak is a critical one, and it is often the minor or
trace elements that are most important, then take what-
ever time is necessary to detect the peak. There is no
reason not to gather the spectrum for many minutes or
even an hour or more, so long as doing so does not
change/damage or contaminate your specimen. Lunch
breaks now become beneficial.
</p>
<p>However, do not obtain more counts by raising the
count rate above that which the processing electronics
can handle, because you may introduce extra sum peaks
and also degrade the energy resolution of the spectrum.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about damaging the analysis area,
as we stated at the beginning, it is best to spread the
probe over as large an area as possible, either by defo-
cusing the C2 lens in TEM mode or by using a scan
raster in STEM mode.
</p>
<p>Identifying the statistically significant peaks by the
above method is one thing. Quantifying the amount of
the element responsible for the peak is another matter
and usually many more counts are required, as we&rsquo;ll see
when we talk about detection limits in Chapter 36.
However, once you&rsquo;re happy with the peak ID, you
may be able to identify the phase/nanoparticle/precipi-
tate that is being analyzed without any further work.
For example, in the material that you are investigating,
thermodynamics may tell you that there are only a few
possible phases that can exist after the processing/ther-
mal treatment given to it, and these phases may have
very different chemistries. A glance at the relative peak
intensities may be sufficient to conclude which phase
you have just analyzed because, as we&rsquo;ll see below and in
</p>
<p>FIGURE 34.5. With increasing counting time, a clear characteristic Fe
</p>
<p>Ka peak develops above the background in these spectra from Si-0.2%
</p>
<p>Fe, thus demonstrating the need to acquire statistically significant counts
</p>
<p>before deciding if a peak is present or absent. As indicated (orange line),
</p>
<p>the background in the 600 s spectrum approximates to a straight line
</p>
<p>making the peak clearly visible. Note that Fe Kb is beginning to appear
</p>
<p>at 7.05 keV, although it is not yet statistically significant.
</p>
<p>TIME
When you count for long times to search for char-
acteristic peaks of low intensity, you will also begin to
detect more easily the small peaks from the various
spurious effects; e.g., CB peaks, Si or Ge internal-
fluorescence peaks, and system peaks such as Fe and
Cu. You also increase the possibility of contamina-
tion and beam damage to your specimen.

<p>more detail in the next chapter, one of the marvelous
advantages of thin-foil analysis in the AEM is that the
peak intensities are often directly proportional to the
elemental concentrations. As a result, quantification
can be extremely simple.
</p>
<p>To conclude this section, we&rsquo;ll look at two examples
before going into the details of quantification in the next
chapter.
</p>
<p>The oxide-glass example: let&rsquo;s run a qualitative anal-
ysis on the spectrum in Figure 34.6. The spectrum is
from a thin NIST oxide-glass film on a carbon support
film on a Cu grid. X-rays were accumulated for 1000 s
with a Be-window, IG detector at an accelerating vol-
tage of 300 kV. Because of the Be window, we do not
expect to see lines below �0.8 keV and so the O Ka
(0.52 keV) will not be detectable. The spectrum only
contained peaks in the range from 0 to 10 keV and the
first peak to be examined was the most intense high-
energy peak, line #1, whichwas consistent with the SiKa
line at 1.74 keV. (The Ka/Kb pair cannot be resolved by
the detector at this energy.) A similar treatment of the
next most intense high-energy line (#2) at 3.69 keV pro-
duced a match with the Ca Ka and it is also possible to
identify the associated Kb at 4.01 keV (the Ca L line is
not detectable). The third most intense line #3 is at an
energy of 6.4 keV. The K-line markers identified it,
along with the smaller one to its right, as being the Fe
Ka and Kb pair. No L line fit was reasonable (Dy La at
6.5 keV being the only alternative) and there are no M
lines above about 4 keV. The Fe L line at 716 eV will not
be detectable because of the Be window.
</p>
<p>Next, the smaller peaks were tackled and the Cu Ka
(and Kb) was identified at 8.04 keV, the Ar Ka at
2.96 keV (the Kb was too small to be visible), and the
Mg Ka was the last to be identified at 1.25 keV.
</p>
<p>Mg (as its oxide) is a common element in glasses, so
this peak is expected. But Ar isn&rsquo;t such a common element
in glasses. It probably arises from Ar implanted during
ion-beam thinning and, as we discussed earlier and in
detail back in Chapter 10, many specimen preparation
processes can affect the chemistry of the specimen surface.
You should also be aware that Ar K at 2.96 keV is often
confused with the Al K sum peak (2�1.49 keV). But since
there is no Al in the glass, and no major peak at half the
Ar K energy, then Ar is the best answer.
</p>
<p>Likewise, Cu is not a common glass-forming element,
but, since the specimen was on a Cu support grid, the Cu
peaks are most probably due to post-specimen scatter of
electrons or X-rays and so we cannot conclude that there
is any Cu within the specimen. No escape or sum peaks
were detectable.
</p>
<p>The Fe-Cr-Ni example is shown in Figure 34.7 and
this spectrum contains six Gaussian peaks, which can
easily be identified following the procedure outlined
above as the Ka and Kb pairs from Fe, Cr, and Ni.
Even the average metallurgist will know that this speci-
men can only be some kind of stainless steel and this may
be all the information that is required, making subse-
quent quantitative analysis redundant. But if you need
more information, e.g., the specific grade of stainless
steel, then you have to make measurements of the rela-
tive peak intensities, and this is the first step in the
quantification procedure. In fact, we will see in Chapter
36 that the thin-foil quantification equation, to a first
approximation, predicts that the amount of each element
is directly proportional to the peak height. If you mea-
sure the relative heights of the Ka peaks in Figure 34.7
with a ruler, you can estimate the composition as � Fe-
20% Cr-10% Ni which is within 10% of the classic 316
stainless composition of Fe-18% Cr-8 % Ni.
</p>
<p>One real advantage of thin foil X-ray analysis is that
you can get a good estimation of the composition of the
analysis volume just by measuring the relative peak
heights with a ruler.
</p>
<p>SPECIMEN PREPARATION
Now you see why it is very useful to have some
knowledge about your specimen and how it was
prepared.
</p>
<p>ABSENCE OF THE Cu La Line
The absence of the line at 0.93 keV in Figure 34.6 is
evidence that the thick Cu grid is responsible for a Cu
line; the low-energy L X-rays will be absorbed in the
grid itself before they can be detected.

<p>Now there must be a good reason why, despite the
fact that a 50-cent plastic ruler can give you a reasonable
quantitative analysis of your spectrum in a few seconds,
all AEMs have tens of thousands of dollars of computer
hardware and software attached to the XEDS detector.
This is because the stainless-steel spectrum is not really a
challenge since all the peaks are close in energy, the
peaks have lots of counts in them and there are no
small peaks from trace elements. If the peaks were far
apart in energy then relative X-ray absorption might
occur, which can change the simple relationship
between peak height and composition. Also if we really
wanted to be sure that we had 304 rather than 316-
stainless steel, then we would need a full quantifica-
tion using the procedures described in the next
chapter. If you were to do this, then you&rsquo;d find that a
full quantification would give a very similar result, but
you could have much greater confidence in the true
composition.
</p>
<p>34.6 COMMON ERRORS
</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen, there&rsquo;s lots of room to misidentify peaks,
particularly small ones that may be one of the many
artifacts from the detector, the processing electronics, or
the AEM-XEDS system. The first thing to realize is that
if you (or even your advisor) can make mistakes, then
the software can also do so. Remember, the software is
only as good as the programmer. So while commercial
automated peak-ID software is generally outstanding
and getting better with every iteration, don&rsquo;t automati-
cally believe it is always correct. By all means, as we said
right at the start of Section 34.3, push the peak-ID
button and get a quick analysis of your spectrum, but
</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve done that, youmight want to read the paper
by Newbury which indicates some errors produced by a
range of software systems. (See also the subsequent
discussion noted in that reference.) The specimens
used by Newbury to show the errors were often quite
complex, with multiple peaks from rare, high-Z ele-
ments, but the article is instructive and illustrates the
point that simply believing the software output is not
always wise and suspicion is healthy.
</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve mentioned, it can be really useful to know
something about your specimen chemistry before you
put it into the AEM (and of course the TEM should be
just about the last technique you use to study a complete-
ly unknown foil). It can also be very useful to remember
how your specimen was thinned, since most thinning
methods can change the surface chemistry of the foil.
For example, electro-thinningmethods can preferentially
remove, or re-deposit one element from the foil or leave
surface residue from the polishing medium. The thinner
the foil is the more such changes in surface chemistry are
exacerbated. Likewise, ion-beam thinning can result in
the implantation of Ar, and FIB thinning can do likewise
for Ga. So your foil may oxidize preferentially during
thinning or pick up Cl from the perchloric-acid polishing
solution, and so on. Ultramicrotomy is about the only
method of thin-foil preparation that doesn&rsquo;t change the
surface chemistry (although the freshly cut surface may
be prone to rapid corrosion in the atmosphere and the
defect structure is seriously changed from the bulk sam-
ple). So always be suspicious.
</p>
<p>34.7 QUALITATIVE X-RAY IMAGING:
PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE
</p>
<p>Individual-point analyses or multiple-point profiles
across an interface are not the only ways to display
X-ray data. As we saw in the previous chapter, we can
produce X-ray images by a variety of methods and, if
you are careful, such images can be used as composi-
tional maps in which the intensity of the signal in the
map is directly proportional to the generated X-ray
intensity IA. Under most circumstances, as we just
described, we can take the next step and assume that,
to some reasonable degree of accuracy, the X-ray inten-
sity from element A in a thin foil is proportional to the
concentration CA. But there are some limitations to
drawing a direct correlation, which we&rsquo;ll deal with in
the next chapter on quantitative analysis. While there
are obvious advantages to comparingmaps of elemental
distributions with other TEM images, this process is
limited by the relatively poor statistics of X-ray acquisi-
tion, as should be eminently obvious to you by now. As
you&rsquo;ll see in the next chapter, good quantification
requires �10,000 counts in the characteristic peak
from element A, IA. In early AEMs, such intensity
</p>
<p>FIGURE 34.7. Spectrum from a stainless-steel foil in which the peaks are

<p>resolved and quite close in energy. To a first approximation, quantifica-
</p>
<p>tion is possible simply by measuring the relative heights of the Ka peaks.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>would easily take you a minute or so to acquire, even if
there was a large amount of A present in your specimen.
At this acquisition rate, even a 56� 56 pixel image would
take 50 hours to gather, so imaging didn&rsquo;t see a lot of
practitioners andwe just had tomake dowith qualitative,
noisy maps, as shown back in Figure 33.13. However, as
we&rsquo;ve told you already, a lot has changed in recent years
to improve the X-ray acquisition rate. First, to generate
more X-rays, we have intermediate-voltage FEGs and
spherical-aberration correctors to permit larger final
apertures while maintaining small probes sizes. Second,
to permit greater throughput of X-rays, we have devel-
oped digital pulse-processing, larger X-ray collection
angles, and SDD arrays. Consequently, particularly if
you can get away with using a reasonably thick specimen,
X-ray mapping is a viable option onmost modern AEMs
where digital-display technologies and new image-
processing software also makes life much easier.
</p>
<p>The older X-ray dot maps, such as in Figure 33.13,
simply register a dot when an X-ray is registered in a
particular energy window in the XEDS spectrum. It
doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the X-ray is a characteristic
</p>
<p>X-ray, a bremsstrahlung X-ray, a spurious X-ray, or a
systemX-ray, it is still registered, so problems like thick-
ness or atomic number effects can occur since thicker/
higher-Z specimens will generate more bremsstrahlung
(as well as more characteristic) X-rays. These problems
are a lot greater in bulk-specimen, SEMX-ray imaging,
which has grappled with these issues for many decades
(summarized in 1990 by Newbury et al.). To account for
all these effects, a full quantitative procedure has to be
applied to the intensity in each pixel and we&rsquo;ll cover this
in detail in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>For qualitative mapping, gray-scale images are still
acceptable, but for full quantification, there is no way
around the use of full-color images because of the many
more color signal levels that your eye can discern and
the advantages of color overlays to compare maps of
different elements, and an example is shown in Figure
34.8, where the final RGB color image shows the che-
mical inhomogeneity of the Au-Pd nanoparticles, thus
giving insight into why they work as catalysts for the
peroxide-synthesis process. (Similar qualitative maps
were shown in Figures 33.14 and 33.15.)

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>So how do you acquire a qualitative map like
Figure 34.8?
</p>
<p>&amp; First you have to be in STEMmode, so your beam is
scanning the specimen under digital control. Then
select the largest probe size that will be still compat-
ible with the desired X-ray image resolution. (Map-
ping with&lt; 5 nm spatial resolution as in Figure 34.8
is challenging (see Chapter 36 on the factors control-
ling spatial resolution)). Only the best intermediate-
voltage FEG instruments approach 1&ndash;2 nm, so a
5 nm probe would be a good start.
</p>
<p>&amp; Second, select a region of the X-ray spectrum that
you want to map (e.g., set a window around a prin-
cipal characteristic peak).
</p>
<p>&amp; Third, set a dwell time for the probe at each pixel
that will permit sufficient X-ray counts to be
acquired. Much more than a few seconds/pixel will
make the acquisition time rather long, and &lt; 0.1 s is
only worthwhile if you have an intermediate-voltage
FEG. (The best aberration-corrected FEG-AEMs
can gather acceptable maps with dwell times of
&lt; 10 ms/pixel.) But, unless you have access to one
of these instruments, start at about 1 s/pixel and
gather a 64�64 pixel map and this will take you
just over an hour. Do all the things we&rsquo;ve told you
to maximize the count rate: large beam diameter,
</p>
<p>large C2 aperture, and shortest (analog) pulse-pro-
cessing time (this will minimize the chances of the
processing electronics rejecting any of the few counts
that are generated in such short dwell time).
</p>
<p>&amp; Last, start the scan and allow the map to commence
building up on the computer display. If the intensity
is acceptable and useful gray-scale information is
obtained, it might be worthwhile to stop and re-
gather the map for a longer period of time, e.g., for
several hours, or even overnight, if it is a crucial map,
However, for such long mapping times, you&rsquo;ll need
to apply drift-correction software so that the map
comes from the intended region of your specimen.
Also it is obviously paramount that your specimen
and AEM are clean, otherwise carbon contamina-
tion will build up to the point where the X-ray detec-
tion can be compromised, Also, as we&rsquo;ve now told
you innumerable times, specimen damage/contami-
nation becomes an issue with longer scan times.
</p>
<p>There are many other things you can do with the
quantitative-analysis software and, given the time
involved for even a simple qualitative map as just
described, it&rsquo;s probably only worth doing fully quantita-
tive maps. So we&rsquo;ll return to this technique in a lot more
detail after you&rsquo;ve learned all the steps necessary to trans-
late the X-ray intensity into the elemental composition.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
One last time; doing the qualitative analysis first is not an option. The following steps are
essential
</p>
<p>&amp; Always be suspicious of any small peaks.
&amp; Get an intense spectrum across the energy range that contains all the characteristic
peaks.
</p>
<p>&amp; Starting at the high-energy end of the spectrum, identify all the major peaks and any
associated family lines and artifacts.
</p>
<p>&amp; If in doubt, collect for a longer time to decide if the intensity fluctuations are in fact
peaks.
</p>
<p>&amp; Beware of pathological overlaps and be prepared to deconvolute any that occur.
&amp; If you have the time, take a qualitative image using any crucial X-ray peaks.

<p>Quantitative X-ray Analysis
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve got an idea of how to acquire XEDS spectra and images from thin foils. You
understand what factors limit the useful information they may contain and what false and
misleading effects may arise. Also you know how to be very sure that a certain characteristic
peak is due to the presence of a certain element and the occasions when you may not be so
confident. Having obtained a spectrum or image that is qualitatively interpretable, it turns
out to be a remarkably simple procedure to convert that information into quantitative data
about the distribution of elements in your specimen; this is what we describe in this chapter.
</p>
<p>This chapter is a little longer than the average. Youmay find that you can skip parts of it
as you work through it the first time. We have decided to keep the material together so as to
be a more useful reference when you are actually doing your analyses on your microscope.
This aspect of XEDS is poised to change significantly in the future and the prospects for
much improved quantification are hinted at and covered in detail in the companion text.
</p>
<p>35.1 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
</p>
<p>Quantitative X-ray analysis in the AEM is a straightfor-
ward technique. What is surprising is that, given its
simplicity, relatively few users take the trouble to extract
quantitative data from their spectra, or produce quanti-
tative images, despite the fact that numerical data are
the basis for all scientific investigations. Before we
describe the steps for quantification, you should know
a little about the historical development of quantitative
X-ray analysis, because this will emphasize the advan-
tages of thin-foil analysis over analysis of bulk speci-
mens, which was in fact the driving force for the
development of the first commercial analytical TEMs.
</p>
<p>Historically, X-ray analysis in electron-beam instru-
ments started with the study of bulk specimens in which
the electron beam was totally absorbed, as opposed to
&lsquo;thin&rsquo; specimens through which the beam penetrates.
The possibility of using X-rays generated by a focused
electron beam to give elemental information about the
specimen was first described by Hillier and Baker in
1944, and the necessary instrumentation was built sev-
eral years later by Castaing in 1951. In his extraordinary
Ph.D. dissertation, Castaing not only described the
equipment but also outlined the essential steps to obtain
quantitative data from bulk specimens. The procedures
that Castaing proposed still form the basis of the quan-
tification routines used today in the EPMA and may be
summarized as follows. Castaing assumed that the
</p>
<p>concentration Ci of an element i in the specimen gener-
ates a certain intensity of characteristic X-rays. How-
ever, it is very difficult in practice to measure this
generated intensity so Castaing suggested that a
known standard of composition C(i) be chosen for ele-
ment i. We then measure the intensity ratio Ii/I(i)
</p>
<p>Ii is the measured intensity emerging from (not gener-
ated within) the specimen.
</p>
<p>I(i) is themeasured intensity emerging from the standard.
</p>
<p>Castaing then proposed that, to a reasonable
approximation
</p>
<p>Ci=C&eth;i&THORN; &frac14; &frac12;K�Ii=I&eth;i&THORN; (35:1)
</p>
<p>where K is a sensitivity factor (not a constant) that
takes into account the difference between the generated
and measured X-ray intensities for both the standard
and the unknown specimen. The contributions to K
come from three effects
</p>
<p>&amp; Z The atomic number
&amp; A The absorption of X-rays within the specimen
&amp; F The fluorescence of X-rays within the specimen
</p>
<p>The correction procedure in bulk analysis is often
referred to as the ZAF correction. The necessary calcu-
lations, which have been refined over the years since
</p>
<p>35 .1 H I S TOR ICAL PERSPECT IVE .............................................................................................................................................................. 639</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Castaing first outlined them, are exceedingly complex
and best handled by a computer. If you&rsquo;re interested,
there are several standard textbooks available which
describe the ZAF and related procedures in detail, for
example, those by Goldstein et al. and by Reed.
</p>
<p>It was soon realized that, if an electron-transparent
rather than a bulk specimen was used, the correction
procedure could be greatly simplified. To a first approx-
imation, in thin films, the A and F factors could be
ignored and only the Z correction would be necessary.
Furthermore, in thin specimens, the analysis volume
would be substantially reduced, giving a much better
spatial resolution. (We discuss this latter point in detail
in the next chapter.)
</p>
<p>These two obvious advantages of thin-foil analysis
led to the development of the so-called Electron Micro-
scopeMicroAnalyzer (EMMA), pioneered by Duncumb
in England in the 1960s. Unfortunately, the EMMAwas
far ahead of its time, mainly because the WDS was the
only X-ray detector available. As we have seen back in
Chapter 32, the classic WDS is handicapped by its poor
collection efficiency, relatively cumbersome size, and
slow, serial operation. These factors, particularly the
poor efficiency, meant that a large probe size
(�0.2 mm) had to be used to generate sufficient X-ray
counts for quantification of the weak signal from thin
foils and, therefore, the gain in spatial resolution over
the EPMA was not so great. Also, the poor stability of
the WDS meant that it was necessary to measure the
beam current to make sure that the X-ray intensities
from both standard and unknown could be sensibly
compared. As a result of all these drawbacks, the
EMMA never sold well and the manufacturer (AEI)
soon went out of the EM business.
</p>
<p>It is ironic that around this time the commercial
developments that would transform TEMs into viable
AEMs were all taking place. The XEDS detector was
developed in the late 1960s, and commercial TEM/
STEM systems appeared in the mid-1970s. However,
before the demise of the EMMAs, they were to play a
critical role in the development of the thin-foil analysis
procedures that, surprisingly, we still use today. The
EMMA at the University of Manchester, operated by
Graham Cliff and Gordon Lorimer, was re-fitted with
an XEDS system and they soon realized that the
pseudo-parallel collection mode, the greater collection
efficiency, and the improved stability of the XEDS
removed many of the problems associated with WDS
on the EMMA. Cliff and Lorimer (1975) showed that
quantification was possible using a simplification of
Castaing&rsquo;s original ratio equation, in which there was
no need to incorporate intensity data from a standard,
but simply ratio the intensities gathered from two ele-
ments simultaneously in the XEDS. This finding revo-
lutionized thin-foil analysis and remains the basis for
most quantifications today.
</p>
<p>35.2 THE CLIFF-LORIMER RATIO
TECHNIQUE
</p>
<p>The basis for the Cliff-Lorimer technique is to rewrite
equation 35.1 as a ratio of two elements A and B in a
binary system. We have to measure the above-back-
ground characteristic intensities, IA and IB, simulta-
neously. This is trivial with an XEDS and, therefore,
there is no need to measure the counts from a standard
</p>
<p>The weight percents of each element CA and CB can
then be related to IA and IB thus
</p>
<p>CA
</p>
<p>CB
&frac14; kAB
</p>
<p>IA
</p>
<p>IB
(35:2)
</p>
<p>This equation is the Cliff-Lorimer equation and the
term kAB is often termed the Cliff-Lorimer factor. As
with K in equation 35.1, kAB is a sensitivity factor, not a
constant, so don&rsquo;t be fooled by the use of this letter. The
k-factor varies according to your TEM/XEDS system
and the kV you choose. Because we are ignoring the
effects of absorption and fluorescence, kAB is related
only to the atomic-number correction factor (Z) in Cas-
taing&rsquo;s original ratio equation. Now to obtain an abso-
lute value for CA and CB, we need a second equation
and, in a binary system, we simply assume that A and B
constitute 100% of the specimen, so
</p>

<p>AEMs, particularly the low brightness of thermionic
sources, the small collection angle of early detectors,
electrical and mechanical instabilities (particularly the
beam current), and the tendency of the early AEMs to
contaminate the analysis area. Consequently, X-ray
count rates were very low, thus limiting quantification.
So it was very difficult to use the well-established, pure-
element standards approach developed over the preced-
ing 25 years for the EPMA because you&rsquo;d have to keep
changing specimens to measure the standards. In doing
so, the probe current would change because, in a TEM,
you have to switch off the beam to stop the vacuum
changes burning out the gun (unlike in an EPMAwhere
you can measure the current in situ and also isolate the
gun automatically). Switching the gun on and off pre-
vents any meaningful comparison of standards and
unknowns. The ratio approach cancels out variations
in the probe current incident on the analysis area; such
variations arise from electron-gun/condenser-system
instabilities, drift, and contamination buildup. Despite
the fact that most of these problems have beenminimized
in modern AEMs, the ratio technique still remains the
only quantitative thin-film analysis software available on
commercial XEDS systems. Clearly, this is not an ideal
situation and after describing the Cliff-Lorimer method,
we&rsquo;ll discuss the z-factor, an alternative, improved
approach, which combines the ease of application of the
ratio method with the more rigorous aspects of pure-
element (or other) thin-film standards (more about this
in the companion text). The z-factor method requires in-
situ measurement of the probe current, which, while
standard on EPMAs for almost 50 years, has still not
penetrated the design of commercial AEMs! So, despite
its vintage, the Cliff-Lorimer equation remains the basis
for quantitative analysis on all AEMs. Let&rsquo;s see how we
use it in practice.
</p>
<p>35.3 PRACTICAL STEPS FOR
QUANTIFICATION
</p>
<p>First of all, you should try to use Ka lines, where possi-
ble, for the measured counts (I). (The Kb peak is com-
bined with the Ka if the two K peaks cannot be
resolved.) Use of L or M lines is more difficult because
of the many overlapping lines in each family, but may be
unavoidable if theKa lines are too energetic and go right
through your detector. (Think why you can&rsquo;t use L orM
lines if the K lines are too weak for your detector.)
</p>
<p>To gather characteristic X-ray intensities for
quantification
</p>
<p>&amp; Keep your specimen as close to 08 tilt as possible to
minimize spurious effects.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you have a wedge specimen, orient it so the thin
portion of the wedge faces the detector, to minimize
X-ray absorption (see Section 35.6).
</p>
<p>&amp; If the area of interest in your specimen is close to a
strong two-beam dynamical diffraction condition,
tilt it slightly to kinematical conditions.
</p>
<p>&amp; Accumulate enough counts in the characteristic
peaks, IA, IB, etc. As wewill see below, for acceptable
errors, there should ideally be at least 104 counts
above background in each peak.
</p>
<p>While you can&rsquo;t always obtain 104 counts in a rea-
sonable time before specimen drift, damage, or contam-
ination limits your analysis, you should always choose
the largest probe size which is consistent with maintain-
ing the desired spatial resolution, so you get most cur-
rent into your specimen. (Remember all the other ways
to maximize the X-ray count rate that we discussed in
Chapter 34.)
</p>
<p>(The reason we worry a little about the diffraction
conditions is that anomalous X-ray generation can
occur across bend contours or whenever a diffracted
beam is strongly excited. This point is not too critical
because we quantify using a ratio technique. If the beam
has a large convergence angle, which is usually the case,
any diffraction effect is further reduced. However, we
will see in Section 35.9 that, under certain conditions,
there are some advantages to be gained from such crys-
tallographic effects.)
</p>
<p>Having accumulated a spectrum under these condi-
tions, how do you quantify it? All you have to do is
measure the peak intensities IA, IB, etc., and then deter-
mine a value for the kAB factor. To determine the peak
intensities, you first have to remove the background
counts from the spectrum and then integrate the peak
counts. Both of these steps are accomplished by various
software routines in the XEDS computer system or in
DTSA. There are advantages and disadvantages to each
approach, so you should pick the one that is most suited
to your problem.
</p>
<p>35.3.A Background Subtraction
</p>
<p>Remember, as we saw back in Section 4.2.B, we are not
very precise in the terminology we use for the X-ray
background intensity, so it can be confusing. &lsquo;Back-
ground&rsquo; refers to the counts under the characteristic
peaks in the spectrum displayed on your computer
screen. These X-rays are generated by the &lsquo;bremsstrah-
lung&rsquo; or &lsquo;braking-radiation&rsquo; process as the beam elec-
trons interact with the coulomb field of the nuclei in the
specimen. The intensity distribution of the bremsstrah-
lung decreases continuously as the X-ray energy
increases, reaching zero at the beam energy (go back
</p>
<p>WT%
The convention is: define the units of composition as
wt%.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and look a, Figure 4.6). Thus, the energy distribution can
be described as a &lsquo;continuum,&rsquo; although as we&rsquo;ve seen,
the phenomenon of coherent bremsstrahlung disturbs
this continuum.
</p>
<p>Remember also that the generated bremsstrahlung
intensity is modified at energies below about 1.5 keV by
absorption within the specimen and the detector, so we
are usually dealing with a background in the spectrum
that looks something likeFigure 35.1. Thebest approach
to background subtraction depends on two factors
</p>
<p>&amp; whether the region of interest in your spectrum is in
the low-energy regime, where the intensity decreases
rapidly with decreasing energy.
</p>
<p>&amp; if the characteristic peaks you want to measure are
close together or isolated.
</p>
<p>Window methods: In the simplest case of isolated
characteristic peaks superimposed on a slowly varying
background, you can easily remove the background
counts by drawing a straight line below the peak, and
defining the background intensity as that present below
the line, as shown in Figure 35.2. So you get the com-
puter first to define a &lsquo;window&rsquo; in the spectrum spanning
the width of the peak, and then draw the line between
</p>
<p>the background intensities in the channels just outside
the window. As with all spectral manipulations, this
method gives better results with more counts in the
spectrum. The background intensity variation is then
less noisy, so it is easier to decide where the peak ends
and the background begins and, furthermore, the back-
ground variation better approximates to a straight line.
</p>
<p>Another, similarly primitive, approach involves
averaging the bremsstrahlung counts above and below
the characteristic peak by integrating the counts in two
identical windows on either side of the peak, as shown in
Figure 35.3. We then assume that the average of the two
intensities equals the background counts under the
</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
We tend to use these three terms &lsquo;background,&rsquo;
&lsquo;bremsstrahlung,&rsquo; and &lsquo;continuum&rsquo; interchangeably,
although strictly speaking they have these specific
meanings.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 35.1. The theoretically calculated and experimentally observed
</p>
<p>bremsstrahlung intensity distribution as a function of energy. Both curves
</p>
<p>are similar until energies below �2 keV when absorption within the
specimen and the XEDS system reduces the detected counts. The best
</p>
<p>method of background removal depends on where in the spectrum your
</p>
<p>characteristic peaks are present.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 35.2. The simplest method of estimating the background con-
</p>
<p>tribution (B) to the counts in the characteristic peak (I); a straight line

</p>
<p>statistics are good and the intensity approximates to a slowly varying
</p>
<p>function of energy. There should be no overlap with any other character-
</p>
<p>istic peak and the peak energy should be &gt; �2 keV.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 35.3. Background subtraction can be achieved by averaging the
</p>

<p>the characteristic (Cr Ka and Kb) peaks. There should be no overlap with
</p>
<p>any other characteristic peaks and the peak energy should be &gt;2 keV.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>peak. This assumption is reasonable in the higher-
energy regions of the spectrum and when the specimen
is thin enough so that the bremsstrahlung is not
absorbed in the specimen. This absorption happens
because the bremsstrahlung X-rays with energies just
above the peak energy preferentially fluoresce the char-
acteristic-peak X-rays, resulting in a detectable reduc-
tion in the bremsstrahlung counts above the peak energy
compared to below.
</p>
<p>When you use the two-window approach, you must
remember the window width you used, because identical
windows must be used when subtracting the back-
ground both in the unknown spectrum and in the spec-
trum from the known specimen that you will use to
determine the k-factor (see Section 35.4).
</p>
<p>While the two techniques we just described have the
advantage of simplicity, you can&rsquo;t always apply them to
real specimens because the spectral peaks may overlap.
Also, if the peaks lie in the low-energy region of the
spectrum where the background is changing rapidly
due to absorption, then neither of these two simple
methods gives a good estimate of the background and
more sophisticated mathematical approaches are
required. We&rsquo;ll now discuss these methods.
</p>
<p>Modeling the background: the bremsstrahlung distribu-
tion can be mathematically modeled, based on the expres-
sion developed by Kramers (1923). The number (NE) of
bremsstrahlung photons of energy E produced in a given
time by a given electron beam is given by Kramers&rsquo; law.
</p>
<p>NE &frac14; KZ
&eth;E0 � E&THORN;
</p>
<p>E
(35:7)
</p>
<p>Here Z is the average atomic number of the specimen,
E0 is the beam energy in keV, and E is the X-ray energy
in keV. The factor K in Kramers&rsquo; law actually takes
account of numerous parameters. These include
</p>
<p>&amp; Kramers&rsquo; original constant.
&amp; The collection efficiency of the detector.
&amp; The processing efficiency of the detector.
&amp; The absorption of X-rays within the specimen.
</p>
<p>All these terms have to be factored into the computer
calculation when you use this method of background
modeling.
</p>
<p>Be wary when using this approach because Kramers
developed his law for bulk specimens. However, the
expression is still used in commercial software, and
seems to do a reasonable job.
</p>
<p>Modeling the spectrum produces a smooth curve fit
that describes the shape of the complete spectrum. This
approach is particularly valuable if many characteristic
peaks are present, since then it is difficult to make local
measurements of the background counts by a window
method. Figure 35.4 shows an example of a spectrum
containing many adjacent peaks, with the background
counts estimated underneath all the peaks.
</p>
<p>Filtering out the background: another mathematical
approach to removing the background uses digital fil-
tering. This process makes no attempt to take into
account the physics of X-ray production and detection
as in Kramers&rsquo; law. Rather it relies on the fact that the
characteristic peaks show a rapid variation of counts as
a function of energy (i.e., dI/dE is large), while the back-
ground exhibits a relatively small dI/dE. This approx-
imation is valid even in the region of the spectrum below
� 1.5 keV where absorption is strong. In the process of
digital filtering, the spectrum intensity is filtered by
convoluting it with another mathematical function.
The most common function used is a &lsquo;top-hat&rsquo; filter
function, so called because of its shape. When the top-
hat filter is convoluted with the shape of a typical X-ray
spectrum, it acts to produce a second-difference spec-
trum, i.e. d 2I/dE 2 versus E. After the top-hat filter, the
background with small dI/dE is transformed to a linear
</p>
<p>OPTIMUM WINDOW
The typical choice of window width is FWHM, but
this throws away a substantial amount of the counts
in the peak. FWTM gives better statistics, but incor-
porates more bremsstrahlung than characteristic
counts; 1.2(FWHM) is the optimum window.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 35.4. The bremsstrahlung intensity modeled using Kramers&rsquo;
</p>
<p>law, modified by Small to include the effects of absorption of low-energy
</p>
<p>X-rays in the specimen and the detector. This method is useful when the
</p>
<p>spectrum contains many overlapping peaks, particularly in the low-
</p>
<p>energy range, such as the Cu La and the Mg and Al Ka lines shown in
</p>
<p>this spectrum (based on Chapter 34, can you determine which peak is
</p>
<p>which?).
</p>
<p>TOO THICK?
If you see this bremsstrahlung absorption effect in
your spectrum, your specimen is too thick for Cliff-
Lorimer quantification.

<p>function with a value of zero (thus it is &lsquo;removed&rsquo;), while
the peaks with large dI/dE, although distorted to show
negative intensities in some regions, are essentially
unchanged as far as the counting statistics are
concerned. Figure 35.5A shows schematically the prin-
ciple behind the filtering process and Figure 35.5B,C
shows an example of a spectrum before and after digital
filtering.
</p>
<p>In summary, you can remove the background by
selecting appropriate windows to estimate the counts
in the peak, or use one of two mathematical-modeling
approaches. The window method is generally good
enough if the peaks are isolated and on a linear portion
of the background. The mathematical approaches are
most useful for multi-element spectra and/or those con-
taining peaks below � 1.5 keV. You should choose the
method that gives you the most reproducible results
(check this on a specimen for which you know the
composition).
</p>
<p>After removing the background, you have to inte-
grate the peak intensities IA, IB, etc.
</p>
<p>35.3.B Peak Integration
</p>
<p>If you used a window method of background estima-
tion, then the peak counts are obtained simply by sub-
tracting the estimated background counts from the total
counts in the chosen window. Therefore, if the computer
drew a line under the peak as in Figure 35.2 then the
peak intensity is that above the line.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you chose, e.g., an ideal window of 1.2 FWHM
and averaged the background on either side of the
peak then the average value must be subtracted from
the total counts in the 1.2 FWHM window; always
use the same window width for B and I.
</p>
<p>BACKGROUND REMOVAL
You must always take care to apply the same back-
ground-removal process to both the standard and the
unknown.

<p>FIGURE 35.5. (A) Digital filtering involves convolution of a top-hat
</p>
<p>filter function with the acquired spectrum. To obtain the filtered spec-
</p>
<p>trum, each channel has the top-hat filter applied to it. The channels on
</p>
<p>either side of that being filtered (#8 in this case) are multiplied by the
</p>
<p>appropriate number in the top-hat function. So channels 1&ndash;5 and 11&ndash;15
</p>
<p>are multiplied by &ndash;1 and channels 6&ndash;10 by +2. The sum of the multi-
</p>
<p>plications is divided by the total number of channels (15) and allotted to
</p>
<p>channel #8 in the filtered spectrum at the bottom. The digital filtering
</p>
<p>process in (A) applied to a spectrum from biotite (B) results in the filtered

<p>spectrum (C) in which the background intensity is zero at all places, and

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; If you used a Kramers&rsquo; law fit, the usual method of
peak integration is to get the computer to fit the peak
with a slightly modified Gaussian, and integrate the
total counts in the channels under the Gaussian.
</p>
<p>&amp; If a digital filter was used, you have to compare the
peaks with those that were taken previously from
standards, digitally filtered, and stored in a library
in the computer. The library peaks are matched to
the experimental peaks via a multiple least-squares
fitting procedure and the counts determined through
calculation of the fitting parameters.
</p>
<p>Each of the two curve-matching processes is rapid.
Each can be used to deconvolute overlapping peaks and
each uses all the counts in the peak. The Kramers-law fit
and the digital filter have much wider applicability than
the simple window methods. However, these computer
processes are not invariably the best, nor are they with-
out error.
</p>
<p>The Gaussian curve fitting must be flexible enough
to take into account several variables
</p>
<p>&amp; The peakwidth can change as a function of energy or
as a function of count rate.
</p>
<p>&amp; The peak distortion due to incomplete charge collec-
tion can vary.
</p>
<p>&amp; There may be an absorption edge under the charac-
teristic peak if your specimen is too thick.
</p>
<p>The creation of a library of spectra gathered under
conditions that match those liable to be encountered
during analysis (particularly similar count rates and
dead times) is a tedious exercise. However, you do get
a figure of merit for the &lsquo;goodness of fit&rsquo; between the
unknown spectrum and the standard. Usually, a w2 value
is given which has no absolute significance, but is a most
useful diagnostic tool. Typically, the w2 value should be
close to unity for a good fit, although a higher valuemay
merely indicate that some unidentified peaks were not
accounted for during the matching process. What you
have to watch out for is a sudden increase in w2 com-
pared with previous values. This indicates that some-
thing has changed from your previous analyses. Perhaps
your standard is not giving a good fit to the experimen-
tal spectrum and either a new library spectrum needs to
be gathered or the experimental peak should be looked
at carefully. For example, another small peak may be
hidden under the major peak and would need to be
deconvoluted from the major peak before integration
proceeds. If you suspect a poor fit, you should make the
computer display the &lsquo;residuals,&rsquo; that is the counts
remaining in the spectrum after the peak has been inte-
grated and removed. As shown in Figure 35.6, you can
easily see if a good fit was made (Figure 35.6A) or if the
library peak and the experimental peak do not match
well (Figure 35.6B).
</p>
<p>Any of the above methods is valid for obtaining
values of the peak counts. They should all result in the
same answer when used to quantify an unknown spec-
trum, so long as you apply the samemethod consistently
to both the standard and the unknown.
</p>
<p>Statham has reviewed the limitations of extracting
peak intensities from X-ray spectra, with particular
emphasis on low-keV lines. While aimed primarily at
the EPMA community, almost all the issues in this

<p>Having obtained the peak counts, the next step is to
insert the values into the Cliff-Lorimer equation and
know the correct value of the k-factor. So we now
need to discuss the various ways to obtain kAB.
</p>
<p>35.4 DETERMINING k-FACTORS
</p>
<p>Remember that the k-factor is not a constant. It is a
sensitivity factor that will vary not only with the X-ray
detector, the microscope, and the analysis conditions,
but also with your choice of background subtraction
and peak-integration methods. So values of k-factors
can be sensibly compared only when they were obtained
under identical conditions. We will return to this point
at the end of this section when we look at various sets of
k-factors published in the literature. There are two ways
you can determine k-factors
</p>
<p>&amp; Experimental determination using standards.
&amp; Calculation from first principles.
</p>
<p>The first method is slow and laborious but gives the
most accurate values. The second method is quick and
painless but the results are less reliable. You might
wonder&mdash;can k-factors even depend on the previous
user of the TEM?
</p>
<p>35.4.A Experimental Determination of kAB
</p>
<p>If you have a thin specimen of known composition, CA,
CB etc., then all you have to do, in principle, is place that
specimen in themicroscope, generate a spectrum, obtain
values of IA, IB, etc., and insert those values in the Cliff-
Lorimer equation 35.2. Since you know CA and CB the
only unknown is kAB. However, there are several pre-
cautions that you must take before this procedure can
be used
</p>
<p>&amp; The standardmust be a well-characterized specimen,
and it is usually best if it is single phase.
</p>
<p>&amp; The standard must be capable of being thinned to
electron transparency. Ideally, when the specimen is
thin there should be no significant absorption or
fluorescence of the X-rays from the elements A, B,
etc., that you wish to analyze.
</p>
<p>&amp; You must be sure that the thinning process did not
induce any chemical changes (this is discussed in
some detail in Chapter 10).
</p>
<p>&amp; It must be possible to select thin regions that are
characteristic of the chemistry of the bulk specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Youmust be sure that the thin foil is stable under the
electron beam at the voltage you intend to use for
analysis.
</p>
<p>This last point may often be the limiting factor in
your choice of standards because, as we saw in Section
4.6, you have to take care to avoid not only direct
knock-on damage, but also sputtering effects, which
occur at voltages substantially below the threshold for
direct atom displacement. Obviously, both these prob-
lems become greater as the beam voltage increases.
</p>
<p>TheNational Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) has issued a thin standard containing the ele-
ments Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe and O (SRM #2063 and
subsequently #2063A). Unfortunately, X-rays from
the lighter elements in this standard film are absorbed
significantly in the film, and also in the detector and so a
correction to the measured k-factor is necessary and
NIST has not re-issued the standard.
</p>
<p>It is best to use your own judgment in choosing
standards, and also make use of the knowledge gained
in previous k-factor studies.
</p>
<p>Cliff and Lorimer&rsquo;s approach using mineral stan-
dards had three advantages.
</p>
<p>&amp; Crushing is an easy way tomake thin flakes and does
not affect the chemistry.
</p>
<p>&amp; The mineral stoichiometry is usually well known.
&amp; The minerals chosen all contained Si, thus permit-
ting the creation of a whole series of kASi factors.
</p>
<p>The drawbacks are that the mineral specimens often
contain more than one phase, or may be naturally non-
stoichiometric. Clearly, some prior knowledge of the
mineralogy of the specimen is essential in order to be
able to select the right spectrum to use as a standard.
Also Si KaX-rays at�1.74 keV are liable to be absorbed
in the XEDS detector, so there may be a systematic
difference in k-factors determined with different detec-
tors. Finally, silicate minerals often exhibit radiolysis
i.e., chemical changes due to beam-induced breaking
of bonds.
</p>
<p>Several alternative approaches have been proposed
that attempt to avoid the problems with kASi
</p>
<p>k-FACTOR VERSUS z FACTOR
There are no generally accepted standards that meet
all the above criteria for ideal k-factor determination,
which is a major limitation to this approach and is
overcome by the pure-element standards used in the
z-factor method, which we describe later.
</p>
<p>GLASS STANDARDS
Can be made completely homogeneous. Reproduci-
ble (one batch). No channeling complications.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Wood et al. generated a series of kAFe factors to
overcome the Si absorption and the beam-sensitivity
problems.
</p>
<p>&amp; Graham and Steeds used crystallized microdroplets
which were routinely thin enough and retained their
stoichiometry.
</p>
<p>&amp; Kelly used rapidly solidified droplets for the same
reasons.
</p>
<p>&amp; Sheridan demonstrated the value of the NIST multi-
element glasses.
</p>
<p>&amp; NIST created its own standard multi-element glass,
as already noted.
</p>
<p>Note also that there has been no new systematic
determination of k-factors for many years, indicating
the mature nature of the k-factor approach. But remem-
ber that you need factors for your TEM, your kV, etc.
</p>
<p>In all cases, the bulk chemistry of the k-factor stan-
dard has to be determined by some technique with
known accuracy, such as EPMA, atomic-absorption
spectroscopy, or wet chemistry. Since all these tech-
niques analyze relatively large volumes of material, it
is best that the standard be single phase. However,
because none of these techniques can determine if the
specimen is homogeneous on a sub-micrometer scale,
the only way to find out the level of homogeneity is to
carry out many analyses within the AEM to confirm
that any variation in your answer is within the expected
X-ray statistical fluctuations.
</p>
<p>Each spectrum should contain sufficient counts in
the peaks of interest to ensure that the errors in the k-
factor determination are at least less than �5% relative
and, if possible, less than � 3%. So, now we need to
consider the errors associated with the X-ray spectra.
</p>
<p>35.4.B Errors in Quantification: The Statistics
</p>
<p>An unfortunate aspect of the simple Cliff-Lorimer ratio
equation is that it has relatively large errors associated
with it. The very nature of the thin foil minimizes the
problems of absorption and fluorescence, but also gen-
erates relatively few X-ray photons per incident elec-
tron, compared with bulk specimens. This effect is
compounded by the small collection angle of the
XEDS detector and the end result is that poor counting
</p>
<p>statistics are the primary source of error in most AEM
quantifications. The best way you can limit these errors
is to use higher-brightness sources, large electron
probes, and thicker specimens (unless absorption is a
problem, or spatial resolution is paramount) and, of
course, Cs-correction of the probe helps. In any case
you should be prepared to count for a long time, assum-
ing that specimen drift and/or contamination don&rsquo;t
compromise your data.
</p>
<p>The rest of this section is pure statistics. If you know
it, then jump ahead.
</p>
<p>Given that our characteristic peak is Gaussian, then
the standard deviation s is obtained from
</p>
<p>s &frac14; N
1
2 (35:8)
</p>
<p>where N is the number of counts in the peak above the
background. For a single measurement, there is a 67%
chance that the measured value ofNwill be within 1s of
the true value ofN. This chance increases to 95% for 2s
and 99.7% for 3s. If we use the most stringent condi-
tion, then the relative error in any single measurement is
</p>
<p>Relative Error &frac14;
3N
</p>

</p>
<p>N
100% (35:9)
</p>
<p>Clearly, the error decreases as N increases and hence,
the emphasis throughout this chapter on the need to
maximize the X-ray counts gathered in your spectra.
Since the Cliff-Lorimer equation uses an intensity
ratio, we can get a quick estimate of the error by sum-
ming the errors in IA, IB, and kAB to give the total error
in the composition ratio CA/CB.
</p>
<p>Summing the errors in fact gives an overestimate of
the error. Strictly speaking, we should add the standard
deviations of the various terms in the Cliff-Lorimer
equation in quadrature to give the standard deviation
in the composition-ratio measurement sC using the
expression

<p>(35:10)
</p>
<p>So we can determine the error for each datum point in
this manner. If we are determining the composition of a
single-phase region (for example, when determining a
k-factor) then we can reduce the error by combining
</p>
<p>DETERMINING k-FACTORS
A typical k-factor determination involves taking
many spectra from different parts of the thin-foil
standard. You must check both the homogeneity
and the stability of the specimen. This is very time
consuming, which is why so few analysts bother to do
it properly.
</p>
<p>GAUSSIAN STATISTICS
Experimental results show that the X-ray counts in
the spectrum obey Gaussian statistics. Hence, we can
apply simple statistics to deduce the accuracy of any
quantification.

<p>the results from n different measurements of the inten-
sity ratio IA/IB. The total absolute error in IA/IB at a
given confidence limit is obtained using the student&rsquo;s t
distribution. For example, in this approach the error is
given by
</p>
<p>Absolute Error &frac14; t95&eth; &THORN;

</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>n

<p>(35:11)
</p>
<p>where t95
n&ndash;1 is the student&rsquo;s t value at the 95% confi-
</p>
<p>dence limit for n measurements of kAB. You can find
lists of student&rsquo;s t values in any statistics text (see, e.g.,
Larsen and Marx) or on the Web (e.g., URL #1).
Obviously, you could choose a lower or higher confi-
dence level. S is the standard deviation for n measure-

</p>
<p>(35:12)
</p>
<p>So by increasing the number of measurements n, you
can reduce the absolute error in kAB. With enough
measurements and a good homogeneous specimen,
you can reduce the errors in the value of kAB to �1%,
as we will see in the example below. However, remember
that this figure must be added to the errors in IA and IB.
From equation 35.8 it is easy to determine that if we
accumulate 10,000 counts in the peak for elementA then
the error at the 99% confidence limit is [3 (10,000)1/2/
10,000]�100%, which is �3%. Using equation 35.10
and a similar value for IB you get a total error in
CA/CB of ��4.5%. Now you see again why &lsquo;counts,
counts, and more counts&rsquo; is the mantra for thin-foil
analysts.
</p>
<p>If you take the time to accumulate 100,000 counts
for IA and IB the total error is reduced to ��1.7%,
which represents about the best accuracy that can be
expected for quantitative XEDS analysis in the AEM.
This is an accuracy that almost no one ever takes the
time to achieve.
</p>
<p>It is appropriate here to go through an illustration of
a kAB determination using experimental data. Before
deciding that a particular specimen is suitable, it should
be checked for its level of homogeneity: there is a well-
established criterion for this. If we take the average
value N of many composition determinations, and all
the data points fall within �3(N)1/2 of N then the speci-
men is homogeneous. In other words, this is our defini-
tion of &lsquo;homogeneous.&rsquo; There are more rigorous
definitions but the general level of accuracy in thin-foil
analysis is such that there is no need to be so stringent.
</p>
<p>An example: A homogenized thin foil of Cu-Mn
solid solution was used to determine kCuMn. The
specimen was first analyzed by EPMA and found
to be 96.64 wt% Cu and 3.36 wt% Mn. Since our
</p>
<p>accuracy is increased by collecting many spectra, a
total of 30 were accumulated (n=30 in equation
35.12). In a typical spectrum the Cu Ka peak con-
tained 271,500 counts above background and the
Mn Ka peak contained 10,800 counts. So if we
insert these data into the Cliff-Lorimer equation
we get
</p>
<p>96:67
</p>
<p>3:36
&frac14; kCuMn
</p>
<p>271,500
</p>
<p>10,800
</p>
<p>kCuMn &frac14; 1:14:
</p>
<p>To determine an error on this value of the k-factor,
equation 35.11 must be used. The student&rsquo;s t anal-
ysis of the k-factors from the other 29 (yes 29!)
spectra gives an error of � 0.01 for a 95% con-
fidence limit. This error of about �1% relative is
about the best that can be achieved using the
experimental approach to k-factor determination,
but remember that 30 individual spectra had to be
accumulated from different regions of a well-char-
acterized thin foil.
</p>
<p>So it takes a real effort to get quantitative data with
errors &lt; � 5&ndash;10% relative. Bear this in mind when you
read any paper in which compositions are given to better
than a rounded � 5% (such as the EPMA data in our
own example).
</p>
<p>Tables 35.1 and 35.2 summarize many of the avail-
able k-factor data in the published literature. You
should go and read the original papers, particularly if
you want to find out what standards and what condi-
tions were used in their determination.

<p>accounted for by X-ray statistics alone. Some of the
differences arise due to the choice of standard and the
reproducibility of the standard. Other differences arise
because the data were obtained under different condi-
tions, such as different peak-integration routines.
Therefore, the point made at the beginning of this sec-
tion is worth repeating: the k-factors are not standards;
they are sensitivity factors.
</p>
<p>The only conditions under which you can expect the
k-factors obtained on different AEMs to be identical are
if you use the same standard at the same accelerating
voltage, same detector configuration, same peak inte-
gration, and same background-subtraction routines.
Even then there will be differences if one or more of
the measured X-ray lines are not gathered by the detec-
tor with 100% efficiency; the X-ray may be either
absorbed by the detector or it may be too energetic
and pass straight through the detector.
</p>
<p>You may not be able to obtain a suitable standard.
For example, youmight be working in a system in which
no stoichiometric phases exist. You might not need a
standard because accuracy might not be critical but you
still need a quick analysis. Under such circumstances
you can calculate an approximate k-factor. The pro-
grams necessary to calculate kAB are stored in the
XEDS computer and will give you a value of k in a
fraction of a second. The calculated value should be
accurate to within�20% relative. This level of accuracy
might be all you need to draw a sensible conclusion
about the material you are examining (in which case,
you can almost rely on a simple peak-height measure-
ment). In general, if you can avoid the tedious experi-
mental approach, then do so.
</p>
<p>The expression for calculating the k-factor from first
principles is derived in the paper byWilliams and Gold-
stein. The derivation gives a good illustration of the
relationship between bulk and thin-film analysis, and
provides insight into the details of X-ray interactions
with solids. However, at this stage you don&rsquo;t need to
know the details of this derivation so we&rsquo;ll simply state
the final expression

<p>(35:13)
</p>
<p>The subscripts A, B denote the elements A, B of atomic
weight AA and AB. This expression derives from the
physics of X-ray generation. An electron passing close
</p>
<p>to an atom in the specimen has first to ionize that atom
and this is governed by QA, the ionization cross section
(sometimes given bys; go back and check equation 4.1).
An ionized atom does not necessarily give off a char-
acteristic X-ray when it returns to ground state and the
fraction of ionizations that do generate an X-ray is
governed by the fluorescence yield for the characteristic
X-rays, oA (go back and check equation 4.6) The
remaining term &lsquo;a&rsquo; is the relative-transition probability.
This term takes account of the fact that if a K-shell
electron is ionized and returns to ground state through
X-ray emission, it can emit either aKa orKbX-ray. You
may remember that we listed the relative weights of the
various K, L, andM families of X-ray lines in Table 4.1.
</p>
<p>As we mentioned at the start of the discussion on
quantification, the Cliff-Lorimer k-factor for thin-foil
analysis is related to the atomic-number correction fac-
tor (Z) for bulk specimen analysis. From equation
35.13, we can easily see what experimental factors deter-
mine the value of k
</p>
<p>&amp; The accelerating voltage is a variable since Q is
strongly affected by the kV.
</p>
<p>&amp; The atomic number affects o, A, and a.
&amp; The choice of peak-integration method will also
affect a.
</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to calculate and compare differ-
ent k-factors, it is imperative to define these conditions
very clearly, as we have taken pains to emphasize.
</p>
<p>Equation 35.13 assumes that equal fractions of the
X-rays generated by elements A and B are collected and
processed by the detector. This assumption will only be
true if the same detector is used and the X-rays are
neither strongly absorbed by, nor pass completely
through, the detector. However, as we have already
seen in Chapter 32, X-rays below � 1.5 keV are
absorbed significantly by Be window and X-rays
above �20 keV pass through a 3 mm Si detector with
ease. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to mod-
ify the k-factor expression, equation 35.13, in the fol-
lowing manner

<p>The first term accounts for absorption (via the mass
absorption coefficients, m/r) of X-rays from element A
passing through the Be window. It should of course be
modified for different windows and it disappears for
windowless detectors. The second term covers absorp-
tion in the Au contact layer and the third term accounts
for the Si dead layer. These two terms will have different
values for different contact elements, IG dead layers,
and SDDs which have very thin dead layers and side
contact layers. The last term adjusts the k-factor for X-
rays that do not deposit their energy in the active region
of a detector which has density r and thickness t0. Typi-
cal values of t0 (� 3mm for Si(Li) and IG but� 1mm for
SDDs) were discussed in Chapter 32. An IG detector
will more efficiently stop high-energy X-rays, since it is
designed to detect them preferentially, while an SDD
will be less efficient since it is generally much thinner
than a Si(Li) or IG. In fact, much of the effort over the
last 20 years to improve detector technology that we
discussed in detail in Chapter 32, minimizes the effects
of equation 35.15 on the k-factor.
</p>
<p>While equations 35.14 and 35.15 are simple for a
computer to solve, the values that have to be inserted in
the equations for the various terms are not always well
known, or cannot bemeasured accurately. For example,
we do not know the best value ofQ for many elements in
the range of voltages typically used in the AEM
(100&ndash;400kV).Thereare considerabledifferencesofopin-
ion in the literature concerning the best way to choose a
value forQ. The twomajor approaches used are
</p>
<p>&amp; Assume various empirical parameterization pro-
cesses (e.g., Powell).
</p>
<p>&amp; Interpolate values of Q to give the best fit to experi-
mental k-factors (Williams et al.).
</p>
<p>The other major variable in equation 35.15 is the Be-
window thickness which is nominally 7.5 mm but in
practice may be 3&ndash;4� thicker. Tables 35.3A and 35.3B
list calculated k-factors obtained using various expres-
sions for Q. As you can see, the value of k may easily
vary by &gt;�10%, particularly for the lighter and the
heavier elements. This variation is due to the uncertain-
ties in the detector-efficiency terms in equation 35.14.
The values of kAB for the L lines are even less accurate
</p>
<p>than for the K lines mainly because the values of Q for
the L lines are somewhat speculative. There are no data
available for calculated k-factors for M lines. Under
these circumstances, experimental determination is the
only approach (or choose different materials to study).
This point again emphasizes the advantages of K-line
analysis where possible. If you are unfortunate enough
to have heavy elements (say Z &gt; 60) in your specimen,
the L or M lines, which may be the strongest in a
spectrum from a Si(Li) detector, will undoubtedly give
rise to greater errors than theK lines, whichmay only be
detectable with an IG system.

<p>AFTER A SERVICE
If your detector is replaced or serviced, which is not
an unusual occurrence on an AEM, then the new
detector parameters must be inserted into the
software.
</p>
<p>35 .4 DETERMIN ING k -FACTORS ............................................................................................................................................................. 651</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The combination of uncertainties in Q and in the
detector parameters is the reason why calculated k-fac-
tors are not very accurate, usually no better than
�10&ndash;20% relative. The computer system attached to
the AEM should have predetermined values of all the
terms in equations 35.14 and 35.15 stored in its memory.
You don&rsquo;t usually have control over which particular
parameters are being used. However, you should at least
find out from your technical support the sources of the
values ofQ,o, and a in your computer. You should then
carry out a cross-check calculation with a known speci-
men to ensure that the calculated k-factor gives a rea-
sonable answer.
</p>
<p>We cannot recommend a best set of values for Q,
o, and a, but the values of Q given by Powell, o from
Bambynek et al., and a from Schreiber and Wims
have often been used. Also we can&rsquo;t give you specific
detector parameters, so you should read the literature
from your XEDS manufacturer. The values of m/r
that are still widely accepted are those determined
by Heinrich although there is still considerable uncer-
tainty in m/r values for low-energy X-rays from the
lighter elements. If you use the DTSA program from
NIST (see Section 1.6), you may find that it predicts
a worse value.
</p>
<p>Figure 35.7A and B shows a comparison of the two
methods of k-factor determination. The experimental
data are shown as individual points with error bars
and the solid lines represent the range of calculated
k-factors, depending on the particular value of Q used
in equation 35.14. The relatively large errors possible in
the calculated k-factors are clearly seen and comparison
of theK-line data in Figure 35.7Awith the L-line data in
Figure 35.7B again emphasizes the advantages of using
K lines for the analysis where possible. Similar data for
M lines are almost non-existent.
</p>
<p>We can summarize the k-factor approach to analysis
in the following way
</p>
<p>&amp; The Cliff-Lorimer equation has the virtue of simplic-
ity; all you have to do is specify all the variables and
treat the standard and unknown in an identical
manner.
</p>
<p>&amp; You are better off calculating kAB if you prefer speed
to accuracy; experimental determination is best if
you wish to have a known level of confidence in the
numbers that you produce.
</p>
<p>35.5 THE ZETA-FACTOR METHOD
</p>
<p>The Cliff-Lorimer ratio method is &gt; 30 years old and,
while it is simple in concept, the need for a k-factor
combined with the difficulties of finding the right stan-
dard specimen, and calculating an accurate enough k-
factor to solve a specific problem are significant limiting
factors. These can be overcome if, instead of using a
ratio method, we go back to the fundamentals of X-ray
analysis as originally developed for the EPMA (based
on equation 35.1) wherein pure-element standards are
used. Pure-element standards have the distinct advan-
tages of being easy to fabricate and they don&rsquo;t change
composition during thinning or under beam damage.
This approach, developed by Watanabe and Horita in
Japan, is termed the zeta (z) factor method. A review of
the development of the method and the pros and cons of

<p>z-factors versus k-factors was given by Watanabe and
Williams in 2006.
</p>
<p>The major experimental drawback to z-factors is
that the method requires in-situ measurement of the
probe current hitting your specimen. Unfortunately,
despite the fact that beam-current measurement is stan-
dard on almost all SEMs and every EPMA, commercial
AEMs don&rsquo;t come equipped with this capability,
emphasizing the point made some while ago in Chapter
33 that AEMs are really modified TEMs and XEDS
analysis is still a bit of an afterthought.
</p>
<p>But, if you can measure the current in situ, e.g., with
a specimen holder within which a Faraday cup is
embedded, life gets much easier. In a thin-foil specimen,
we can assume that the characteristic X-ray intensity is
proportional to the mass thickness, rt, if X-ray absorp-
tion and fluorescence are negligible. Therefore, we can
define the z-factor for pure element A as
</p>
<p>rt &frac14; zA
IA
</p>
<p>CA
(35:16)
</p>
<p>Where
</p>
<p>z �
A
</p>
<p>CN0Qoai
(35:17)
</p>
<p>where the only new terms are the beam current i, and
Avogadro&rsquo;s number N0. Under these conditions, the z-
factor is dependent on the X-ray energy, the kV, and the
beam current. The first two are constant for any experi-
ment and the third you have to measure. The z-factor is
</p>
<p>independent of specimen thickness, composition, and
density which, as we shall see later, makes any absorp-
tion correction trivial.
</p>
<p>So we can write similar equations for all the other
pure elements in our specimen
</p>
<p>rt &frac14; zB
IB
</p>
<p>CB
(35:18)
</p>
<p>Whenwe know the z-factors for A and B,CA,CB, and rt
can be expressed from equations 35.16 and 35.18,
assuming CA + CB = 1 in a binary system:
</p>
<p>CA &frac14;
IAzA
</p>
<p>IAzA &thorn; IBzB
;
</p>
<p>CB &frac14;
IBzB
</p>
<p>IAzA &thorn; IBzB
rt &frac14; IAzA &thorn; IBzB (35:19)
</p>
<p>Therefore, we can determine CA, CB, and rt simulta-
neously just by measuring X-ray intensities. It is simple
to rearrange equation 35.19 to compare with the Cliff-
Lorimer ratio equation (equation 35.2) and equation
35.20 is just as simple to apply, but k-factors are no
longer required, just z-factors.
</p>
<p>CA
</p>
<p>CB
&frac14;
</p>
<p>IAzA
IBzB
</p>
<p>(35:20)
</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see below, absorption and fluorescence-
correction terms can be combined directly with equation
35.19. To determine the z-factors, you just measure
X-ray characteristic intensities (above the background)

<p>from pure-element thin films with known composition
and thickness, rather than trying to find a suitable set of
standards, such as those listed in the references for
Tables 35.1 and 35.2. Pure-element standards are more
routinely available than the various multi-element, thin-
film standards that have been used for k-factor determi-
nation over the last 30 years or so. You can determine an
entire set of the z-factors for K-shell X-ray lines from a
single spectrum from the National Institute of Stan-
dards and Technology (NIST) thin-film glass standard
reference material (SRM) 2063. Table 35.4 lists such a
set of z-factors obtained from the NIST standard SRM
2063a, which is a thinner version of SRM 2063. Its
composition is known to a high degree of accuracy, as
is its thickness and density but, unfortunately, it is now
out of production.
</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s muchmore about the z-factor in the compan-
ion text. Despite its obvious advantages, the z-factor
approach is not yet commercially available; however,
it can be downloaded from the bookWeb site (URL#2).
</p>
<p>35.6 ABSORPTION CORRECTION
</p>
<p>The point at which the simple Cliff-Lorimer approach
breaks down is when the thin-foil criterion is invalid.
Then the X-ray counts from your specimen are not a
function of Z alone and absorption and (very occasion-
ally) fluorescence invalidate the simple criterion. The
effects of absorption are much more of a problem than
fluorescence, so let&rsquo;s look at absorption first.
</p>
<p>Preferential absorption of the X-rays from one of the
elements in your specimen means that the detected
X-ray counts will be less than the generated counts
and so CA is no longer simply proportional to IA. So
you have to modify the k-factor to take into account the
reduction in IA. This problem can arise (a) if your speci-
men is too thick, (b) if one or more of the characteristic
X-rays has an energy less than � 1&ndash;2 keV (i.e., light-
element analysis) or (c) when you have X-ray lines in
your spectrum that differ in energy by &gt; 5&ndash;10 keV
(because the lower energy X-ray is much more likely to
be absorbed than the higher energy one).
</p>
<p>If we define kAB as the true sensitivity factor when
the specimen thickness t=0, then the effective sensitiv-
ity factor for a specimen in which absorption occurs is
given by kAB* where
</p>
<p>k�AB &frac14; kAB&eth;ACF&THORN; (35:21)
</p>
<p>So we can write
</p>
<p>CA
</p>
<p>CB
&frac14; kAB&eth;ACF&THORN;
</p>
<p>IA
</p>
<p>IB
(35:22)
</p>
<p>The absorption-correction factor (ACF) is theA term in
equation 35.13 and we can write it as

<p>d rt&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>(35:23)
</p>
<p>In this expression j&eth;rt&THORN; is the depth distribution of X-
ray production (which is the ratio of the X-ray emission
from a layer of element A/B (of thickness Drt at depth t
in the specimen with density r) to the X-ray emission
</p>
<p>from an identical, but isolated film). The term m
r
</p>
<p>iA
</p>
<p>Spec
is
</p>
<p>the mass-absorption coefficient of X-rays from element
A in the specimen and a is the detector take-off angle.
Since the values of m/r are often from old publications,
the units are usually given in cm2/gm rather than kg/m2,
so you may have to use r in gm/cm3 and t in cm, rather
than SI units (kg/m3 and m, respectively). Obviously,
the value of the ACF is unity when no absorption
occurs. Typically, if the ACF is &gt;10% we define the
absorption as significant, since 10% accuracy is routi-
nely attainable in quantitative analysis using experimen-
tal k-factors. Let&rsquo;s now look at each of the terms and the
problems associated with determining their value.
</p>
<p>Again, we recommend that you use the values of m/r
given by Heinrich. The value of m/r for a particular X-
ray (e.g., from element A) within the specimen is the sum
of the mass-absorption coefficients for each element
times the weight fraction of that element, so

</p>
<p>Ci &frac14; 1 (35:25)
</p>
<p>The absorption of X-rays from element A by all ele-
ments i in the specimen is summed. The summation
includes self-absorption by element A. Elements that
may not be of interest in the experiment or that might
not be detectable may still cause absorption.
</p>
<p>The NiO-MgO example of this phenomenon
occurs when Mg is being quantified in homoge-
neous NiO-MgO. The Mg Ka X-rays will be
absorbed by oxygen, even if the O Ka X-ray is
not of interest or cannot be detected because a
Be-window detector is being used. This effect is
shown in Figure 35.8, which shows an increase in
the intensity ratio (Ni Ka/Mg Ka) as a function of
thickness due to the increased absorption of the

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Mg Ka X-rays. (Absorption appears in an expo-
nential term.) If we correct for the absorption by
Ni, the slope of the line is reduced, but only when
the effects of absorption by oxygen are taken into
account does the slope become zero, as it should be
for a homogeneous specimen.
</p>
<p>In equation 35.22, we assume that the depth distri-
bution of X-ray production j&eth;rt&THORN; is a constant, and
equal to unity. That is, a uniform distribution of X-
rays is generated at all depths throughout the foil. This
is a reasonable first approximation in thin foils, but in
bulk specimens j&eth;rt&THORN; is a strong function of t and so the
measurement of j&eth;rt&THORN; for bulk specimens is a well-
established procedure. The few studies in thin specimens
show an increase in j&eth;rt&THORN; with specimen thickness,
although the increase is no more than �5% in foil
thicknesses of &lt; 300 nm. Therefore, the assumption
appears reasonable since, if your specimen is thicker
than 300 nm, you will have problems to worry about
other than j&eth;rt&THORN;. The fact that we use a ratio of the two
j&eth;rt&THORN; terms in the absorption equation also helps to
minimize the effects of this assumption.
</p>
<p>We assume that j&eth;rt&THORN; equals unity, then we can
simply use equation 35.23 to give

<p>The absorption path length (t0) is a major variable in
the absorption correction. Fortunately, it is also the one
over which you, the operator, have the most control. In
the simplest case of a parallel-sided thin foil of thickness
t at 08 tilt, the absorption path length, as shown in
Figure 35.9, is given by
</p>
<p>t0 &frac14; t0 coseca (35:28)
</p>
<p>where a is the detector take-off angle. To minimize
this factor it is obvious that your specimen should be
as thin as possible and the value of a as high as possible.
There are many ways to determine the foil thickness,
which we have discussed at various points in this
text; they are summarized in Section 36.3. More
recently, Banchet et al. (2003) have combined EELS
measurements of relative specimen thickness with
XEDS peak intensities to give a variation on the tradi-
tional, iterative absorption-correction process. No
method is universally applicable, and few are either
easy or accurate, so it&rsquo;s best to make thin specimens in
the first place.
</p>
<p>The value of a when your specimen is at the ideal
08 tilt is fixed by the design geometry of your AEM
stage and the only way you can vary a is by tilting
your specimen. As we have seen, there are good rea-
sons not to tilt beyond about 108, because of the
increase in spurious X-rays, but if there is a severe
absorption problem, then decreasing t0 by tilting your
specimen toward the detector is a sensible first step
toward minimizing the problem. On some very old
AEMs the detector may not be orthogonal to the
axis of your specimen holder, in which case you&rsquo;ve
got a challenging exercise in solid geometry to deter-
mine a.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve assumed that our specimens are parallel
sided, but this is uncommon. Many thin-foil prepara-
tion methods result in wedge-shaped foils, and under
these circumstances the detector must always be looking
toward the thin edge of the specimen so that the X-ray
path length is minimized, as we already described in
Figure 32.15. The only way to ascertain if this is a
problem is to measure the thickness at each analysis
point. Because this is such a tedious exercise, you should
get round it by using the z-factor method, as we explain
in the next section.
</p>
<p>Because the specimen density r (and therefore
the values of m/r) varies with your specimen composi-
tion the complete absorption-correction procedure
is an iterative process. The first step is to use the
Cliff-Lorimer equation without any absorption cor-
rection and thus produce values for CA and CB.
From these values, the computer performs a first-
iteration calculation of m/r and r, and generates
modified values of CA and CB, and iterates again.
Usually the calculation converges after two or three
iterations.
</p>
<p>In summary, there is substantial room for error in
determining the various terms to insert into the ACF.
For example, the ACF for kNiAl in Ni3Al, which is a
strongly absorbing system, varies from �5.5 to �12%
when the specimen doubles in thickness from 40 to
80 nm. This change is still quite small and within the
limits of all but the most accurate analyses. In FeNi,
which is a weakly absorbing system, a similar change in
thickness would change the ACF for kFeNi from�0.6 to
�1.3%, which is negligible. So while we&rsquo;ve spent a fair
bit of time introducing you to the absorption correction,
the final message is clear.
</p>
<p>35.7 THE ZETA-FACTOR ABSORPTION
CORRECTION
</p>
<p>So, if significant absorption is unavoidable, informa-
tion about your specimen density and thickness is
required at each analysis position, in order to apply
</p>
<p>the absorption correction. Obviously, this is the major
limitation, since independent measurements are
required for the specimen density and thickness and
inaccuracies in such measurements may cause further
errors in quantification. In fact, the z-factor method
was originally proposed in order to overcome these
limitations and difficulties associated with the absorp-
tion correction because, if we substitute equation
35.16 into equation 35.22, the rt term can be
eliminated

substituted in the above equation since

</p>
<p>(35:30)
</p>
<p>So the z-factor overcomes the two major limitations of
the Cliff-Lorimer method by avoiding the tedium of
preparing multiple thin-foil standards and making mul-
tiple thickness and density measurements at each anal-
ysis point when significant X-ray absorption is
occurring. That&rsquo;s why we introduce its depth in the
companion text and suggest strongly that the serious
X-ray analyst use this approach.
</p>
<p>35.8 THE FLUORESCENCE CORRECTION
</p>
<p>X-ray absorption and fluorescence are intimately
related because a primary cause of X-ray absorption
is the fluorescence of another X-ray (such as the
fluorescence of SiKa X-rays in the XEDS detector
which gives rise to the escape peak). You might
think, therefore, that fluorescence corrections should
be as widespread as absorption corrections. However,
this is not the case for the following reasons. Strong
absorption effects occur when there is a small amount
of one element whose X-rays are being absorbed by
the presence of a relatively large amount of another
element. The absorption of Al Ka X-rays by Ni in
Ni3Al is a classic example. In this case, Ni X-rays are
indeed fluoresced as a result of the absorption of Al
Ka X-rays. However, there is a relatively small
</p>
<p>CLIFF-LORIMER ACCURACY?
The Cliff-Lorimer approach only incurs large errors
in strongly absorbing systems and/or very thick
specimens.
</p>
<p>HOW THICK?
Remember: it&rsquo;s rare that you&rsquo;ll know your specimen
thickness as well as you would like.
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>increase in the total number of Ni X-rays because Ni
is the dominant element; the relative decrease in the
Al Ka intensity is large because Al is the minor con-
stituent. In this particular example there is a further
reason why fluorescence of Ni X-rays is ignored; it is
the NiLaX-rays which are fluoresced by the absorp-
tion of Al Ka X-rays. The Ni L X-rays are not the
ones that we use for analysis anyhow, since the higher
energy Ni K X-rays are not absorbed or fluoresced.
</p>
<p>In the rare case that fluorescence occurs to a degree
that limits the accuracy of your analysis, read the
detailed discussion given by Anderson et al. Practical
examples of the fluorescence correction are hard to
come by and a classic case is Cr in stainless steels
where the minor CrKa line is fluoresced by the major
FeKa line, giving rise to an apparent increase in Cr
content as the foil gets thicker.
</p>
<p>35.9 ALCHEMI
</p>
<p>We told you early on in this chapter to acquire your X-
ray spectra away from strong diffraction conditions.
This is because of the Borrmann effect. Close to two-
beam conditions, the Bloch waves interact strongly with
the crystal planes and so X-ray emission is enhanced
compared with kinematical conditions, thus negating
the assumptions inherent in the Cliff-Lorimer equation,
which assumes emission is constant with specimen tilt.
However, we can make use of this phenomenon to
locate which atoms lie on which crystal planes. The
technique has the delightful (and wholly inappropriate)
acronym ALCHEMI, which is a selective abbreviation
of the expression &lsquo;atom location by channeling-
enhanced microanalysis.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>ALCHEMI is a quantitative technique for identify-
ing the crystallographic sites, distribution and types of
substitutional impurities in crystals. The technique was
first developed for the TEM by Spence (who, with
archetypical antipodean humor, coined the acronym)
and Taft&oslash;. Interestingly, channeling is also used for
atom-site location in other analysis techniques (e.g.,
see Chu et al.).
</p>
<p>The way to do ALCHEMI experimentally is to tilt
your specimen to a strong two-beam condition and
acquire a spectrum under strong channeling condi-
tions, such that the Bloch wave is interacting strongly
with a particular systematic row of atoms. You should
</p>
<p>choose the channeling orientation so that the specific
crystal planes interacting strongly with the beam also
contain the candidate impurity atom sites. So it helps
a lot if you have some a priori ideas about where
substitutional atoms are most likely to sit. This tech-
nique is therefore particularly well suited to layer
structures. When the Bloch wave is maximized on a
particular plane of atoms, the X-ray counts from the
atoms in that plane will be highest. So start by finding
the orientations 1 and 2 that give the most pronounced
channeling effects for the atoms A and B, as shown
schematically in Figure 35.10A. Usually a very small
tilt is all that is necessary to get a different spectrum
from the two planes.
</p>
<p>If you are looking at two elements A and B
and a substitutional element X then follow this
procedure
</p>
<p>&amp; Measure X-ray intensities from each element in
orientations 1 and 2.
</p>
<p>&amp; Then find a non-channeling orientation (3)
where the electron intensity is uniform for both
planes.
</p>
<p>In this orientation we define the ratio k (NOT the
Cliff-Lorimer factor) as
</p>
<p>k &frac14; IB
IA
</p>
<p>(35:36)
</p>
<p>IB is the number of X-ray counts from the element B in
the non-channeling orientation. For the two channeling
orientations 1 and 2, we define two parameters b and g
such that
</p>
<p>b &frac14; I
&eth;1&THORN;
B
</p>
<p>kI
&eth;1&THORN;
A
</p>
<p>(35:37)
</p>
<p>g &frac14; I
&eth;2&THORN;
B
</p>
<p>kI
&eth;2&THORN;
A
</p>
<p>(35:38)
</p>
<p>Now assuming we know from looking at the relative
intensity changes in the spectra that the element X sits
on specific sites, say it substitutes for atom B, then we
define an intensity ratio term R such that
</p>
<p>R &frac14; I
&eth;1&THORN;
A I
</p>
<p>&eth;2&THORN;
X
</p>
<p>I
&eth;1&THORN;
X I
</p>
<p>&eth;2&THORN;
A
</p>
<p>(35:39)
</p>
<p>Then the fraction of atom X on B sites is given by
</p>
<p>CX &frac14;
R� 1
</p>
<p>R� 1&thorn; g� bR
(35:40)
</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T WORRY ABOUT FLUORESCENCE
Fluorescence is usually a minor effect and often
occurs for X-rays that are not of interest. (So don&rsquo;t
worry if you know you needn&rsquo;t!)
</p>
<p>35 .9 ALCHEMI ........................................................................................................................................................................................ 657</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Similar expressions can be generated for X atoms on A
sites, but in fact the fraction of X atoms on A sites must
be 1&ndash;CX.
</p>
<p>As you see, ALCHEMI can give a direct measure
of the occupation of substitutional sites. However, the
intensity differences in different orientations are
often quite small and you need good X-ray statistics
to draw sound conclusions (counts, counts, and
more counts!). This makes ALCHEMI difficult to
apply if high spatial resolution is also desired
because, as we shall see in the next chapter, the
conditions to give the best spatial resolution also
give the worst counting statistics. Figure 35.10B
shows the variation in X-ray emission across a bend
contour highlighting the Borrmann effect which is the
basis of ALCHEMI. A comprehensive review has
been given by Jones, who extends the discussion of
the technique and develops it in depth in the compan-
ion text.
</p>
<p>35.10 QUANTITATIVE X-RAY MAPPING
</p>
<p>As we have discussed throughout the previous chap-
ters, gathering X-ray maps rather than individual or
lines of spectra makes a great deal of sense in terms
of getting unbiased elemental-distribution information
about your specimen. The major difficulty with mov-
ing from qualitative to quantitative mapping is the
need for sufficient counts for quantification. As noted
in Section 35.4.B above, we recommend acquiring
10,000 counts in a characteristic peak in order for
reasonable quantification (i.e., with errors � � 10%
relative). A simple calculation will show how unrea-
listic this is if we are to acquire maps in a reasonable
time. A minimum map to give a reasonable X-ray
image is 128 � 128 pixels giving &gt; 16,000 total pixels.
Even if we acquire for only 1 s/pixel (if we are lucky
we will acquire a few tens of total counts rather than
a few thousands), then we will be mapping for 4.5
hours minimum and more likely days if we wish to
see hundreds or thousands of counts/pixel. As we&rsquo;ve
stated too often, such long times introduce specimen
drift, damage, contamination, and operator boredom
and so conspire to make life very difficult. While
overnight mapping with lower-resolution EPMA sys-
tems (where the drift and stability requirements are
much less stringent and the X-ray count rate is far
greater) is indeed a common occurrence, STEMs are
not yet stable enough to do this while retaining nan-
ometer-level resolution.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there has been significant progress in
quantitative mapping, particularly with the use of
2&ndash;300 kV FEG instruments, the development of

</p>
<p>interact strongly with row A then row B giving different characteristic
</p>
<p>intensities, shown schematically in the spectra, from which the relative
</p>
<p>amounts of X in columns of A and B can be determined. (B) The Borr-

</p>
<p>emission variation while the As varies in an approximately complemen-
</p>
<p>tary fashion. The BSE signal is inversely proportional to the amount of
</p>
<p>channeling so the As signal is strongest where the channeling is weakest.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>higher solid angles of collection of X-rays, and gen-
eral improvements in instrument design. So, as shown
back in Figures 33.14 and 33.15, quantitative X-ray
mapping is feasible. This process requires that the
counts in the characteristic peak that is being mapped
be integrated, subject to background subtraction,
then processed via a Cliff-Lorimer or z-factor equa-
tion to turn the counts into composition. It is often
best to exhibit the map as a color image because
usually more than one element needs to be mapped
or the composition changes need to be emphasized in
which case overlays or side-by-side comparisons of
the different maps permit easier understanding of
the relative distributions of the various elements.
Not surprisingly, quantitative mapping is improved
by Cs correction since corrected probes have �3&ndash;5�
more current without loss of probe size. Thus the
count rate is increased, or the acquisition time
decreased, or both.
</p>
<p>While it is certainly of interest to improve the
stability of our TEM and XEDS systems and opti-
mize the gathering of data over long periods of time,
there are ways to minimize the limitations of low
count rates and long acquisition times and this
requires high-level computer control of the X-ray
acquisition, implementation of spectrum imaging, or
position-tagged spectrometry (check back in Sections
33.6.C and 33.6.D) and then manipulation of the
resulting data cube using multivariate statistical anal-
ysis (MSA) to extract the maximum signal informa-
tion and minimize the noise (which constitutes most
of the signal in the channels in a spectrum acquired
for a short period of time).
</p>
<p>When this combination of SI and MSA is
implemented, it is possible to gather spectra in as little
as 100&ndash;500 ms/pixel giving mapping times of a few
minutes to several tens of minutes for a 128 � 128
pixel image and it is equally feasible to contemplate
larger maps. The SI/MSA combination is dealt with
in great detail in the companion text. About the best
that can be done with a modern Cs-corrected
FEGSTEM, sophisticated data handling is shown in
Figure 35.11 where segregation of trace elements to
grain boundaries is mapped. A similar example was
also shown back in Figure 33.15D which maps out
differences in the composition of various small
precipitates, a few nanometers in diameter. In Figure
35.11B, the data were acquired on a 300-keV STEM
and the improvement in mapping quality obtained
after MSA (Figure 35.11C) is clear. Addition of a
Cs corrector to the STEM results in a further gain in
spatial resolution, as shown in Figure 35.11D. This
latter example of Zr segregating to a grain boundary
in a Ni-base superalloy mapping reveals a typical
enrichment of only �1&ndash;2 atoms/nm2 with a spatial
resolution of �0.5 nm!

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The fact that much of this chapter is unchanged from the first edition sends a message that
not much has changed in the last decade. This is unfortunate because, while quantitative
analysis of spectra from thin foils can be straightforward, the standard Cliff-Lorimer
approach has serious limitations. Most of the problems are overcome by the newer z-factor
method, which is not yet commercially available but can be downloaded from the book web
site (URL #2). Perhaps the greatest difficulty remains the need to know the specimen
thickness in order to compensate for X-ray absorption and, again, the z-factor approach
is invaluable in avoiding this. We can minimize absorption by making the thinnest possible
specimens but then the number of X-ray counts may be so small that errors in the
quantification are unacceptably large. The use of FEG sources,Cs correction, and improved
TEM-EDS configurations with detector arrays to maximize the collection angle all help.
With these latest advances, we can now perform quantitative X-ray mapping with a spatial
resolution of a less than a nanometer and detection limits of a few atoms. There&rsquo;s much
more about these exciting new aspects of quantitative analysis in the companion text.

<p>Spatial Resolution and Minimum Detection
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Often when you do X-ray analysis of thin foils you are seeking information that is close to
the limits of spatial resolution. Before you carry out any such analysis you need to under-
stand the various controlling factors and in this chapter we explain these. Minimizing your
specimen thickness is perhaps the most critical aspect of obtaining the best spatial resolu-
tion, so we summarize the various ways you can measure your foil thickness at the analysis
point, but the quality of the TEM-XEDS system is also important.
</p>
<p>A consequence of going to higher spatial resolution is that the X-ray signal comes from a
much smaller volume of the specimen. A smaller signal means that you&rsquo;ll find it very difficult
to detect the presence of trace constituents in thin foils. Consequently, the minimum mass
fraction (MMF) in TEM is not as small as many other analytical instruments which have
poorer spatial resolution. This trade-off is true for any analysis technique, and so it is only
sensible to discuss the ideas of spatial resolution in conjunction with analytical detection
limits. We&rsquo;ll make this connection in the latter part of the chapter. Despite the relatively
poorMMF, it is possible to detect the presence of just a few atoms of one particular element
if the analyzed volume is small enough, and so the TEMactually exhibits excellentminimum
detectable mass (MDM). With the latest advances in XEDS and TEM technology, partic-
ularly Cs correction, X-ray analysis with atomic-column resolution and single-atom detec-
tion is now feasible in the same instrument.
</p>
<p>36.1 WHY IS SPATIAL RESOLUTION
IMPORTANT?
</p>
<p>As we described in the introduction to Chapter 35, the
historical driving force for the development of X-ray
analysis in the TEM was the improvement in spatial
resolution compared with the EPMA. This improve-
ment arises for two reasons
</p>
<p>&amp; We use thin specimens, so less electron scattering
occurs as the beam traverses the specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; The higher electron energy (&gt;100&ndash;400 keV in the
TEM compared with 5&ndash;30 keV in the EPMA)
further reduces scattering.
</p>
<p>The latter effect occurs because the mean free path
for both elastic and inelastic collisions increases with the
electron energy. The net result is that increasing the
accelerating voltage when using thin specimens
decreases the total beam-specimen interaction volume,
thus giving a more localized X-ray signal source and a
higher spatial resolution, which is good (see Figure
36.1A). Conversely, with bulk samples, increasing the
</p>
<p>voltage increases the interaction volume and spatial
resolution is at best �0.5&ndash;1 mm which is not so good
(see Figure 36.1B). There is increasing interest in reduc-
ing the spatial resolution of SEM-X-ray analysis using
very low voltage electron beams and low-energy X-ray
lines. While this is challenging, there has been consider-
able progress and a spatial resolution &lt;100 nm with E0
&lt;5 keV is feasible. Aberration correctors and bolometer
detectors will help even further but, for the best spatial
resolution, there is still no alternative to thinning your
specimen.
</p>
<p>Much theoretical and experimental workwas carried
out in the early days of AEM to define and measure the
spatial resolution of XEDS in the TEM, and we&rsquo;ll intro-
duce some of these concepts. The ultimate aim, of course,
is to push spatial resolution to the atomic scale and
detection limits to the single-atom level. Both of these
goals have been attained in EELS, as we&rsquo;ll see in the next
several chapters, but, as ever, we are limited by the small
number of X-ray counts generated in thin foils and the
poor collection efficiency of the XEDS. Cs correctors
and SDDs are helping here, as we shall see.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36.2 DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT
OF SPATIAL RESOLUTION
</p>
<p>It has long been recognized that the analysis volume,
and hence the spatial resolution, is governed by the
beam-specimen interaction volume, since the XEDS
can detect X-rays generated anywhere within that
volume (you&rsquo;ll see later that this is different to the
situation in EELS). The interaction volume is a function
of the incident-beam diameter (d) and the beam spread-
ing (b) caused mainly by elastic scattering within the
specimen. Therefore, the measured spatial resolution
(R) is a function of your specimen and this has made it
difficult to define a generally accepted measure of R.
Let&rsquo;s look first at d and b and how we define them.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already discussed how to define andmeasure d
in TEMs and STEMsway back inChapter 5, so you need
only remind yourself that the beam diameter d is defined
as the FWTMof the Gaussian electron intensity.We can
measure d directly from the TEM image or indirectly by
traversing the beam across a sharp edge and looking at
the intensity change on the STEM screen.
</p>
<p>This definition takes account of only 90% of the
electrons entering the specimen, so it is still an approx-
imation. Remember that the electron-intensity distribu-
tion in the incident beam is Gaussian only if you are
careful in your choice (small) and alignment of the C2
aperture and you restrict the beam to paraxial condi-
tions (go back and read Section 6.5.A to decide if you
should be at the Gaussian image plane or the disk of
minimum confusion for best resolution). It is a little
more difficult to define and measure b, so this needs
more explanation.

<p>improved resolution at higher kV. (B) Conversely, in a bulk sample, the
</p>
<p>interaction volume at 30 kV is much larger than that at 10 kV, thus giving
</p>
<p>poorer X-ray spatial resolution at higher kV. The color in both sets of
</p>
<p>simulations reflects the change in energy of the electrons. Note the rela-
</p>
<p>tively constant energy in the thin foil compared with the rapid energy loss
</p>
<p>in the bulk sample.
</p>
<p>SPATIAL RESOLUTION FOR XEDS
We can define this spatial resolution as the smallest
distance (R) between two volumes in the specimen
from which independent analyses can be obtained.
The definition of R has evolved as AEMs have
improved and smaller analysis volumes have become
possible.

<p>36.2.A Beam Spreading
</p>
<p>The amount that the beam spreads (b) on its way through
the specimen has been the subject of much theoretical and
experimental work. While results and theories differ in
minor aspects, there is a general consensus that b is gov-
erned by the beam energy (E0), foil thickness (t), and
atomic number (Z). It turns out that the simplest theory
for b gives a good approximation under most analysis
conditions. This theory (sometimes called the &lsquo;single-scat-
tering&rsquo; model because it assumes that each electron only
undergoes one elastic scattering event as it traverses the
specimen) was first given in the seminal paper by Gold-
stein et al. and re-defined in SI units by Jones.
</p>
<p>b &frac14; 8� 10�12 Z
E0
</p>
<p>Nv&eth; &THORN;
1=2t
</p>
<p>3=2 (36:1)
</p>
<p>where b and t are inm,E0 is in keV, andNv is the number
of atoms/m3. In the original derivation, this latter term
was given as (r/A)1/2 and is confusing in that the density
may vary considerably from point to point in a multi-
phase alloy and is generally unknown anyhow. Further-
more, the atomic-weight dependence was the opposite
to the atomic-number dependence which is counterin-
tuitive. So usingNv is clearer and you canwork the value
out from the ratio of the number of atoms/unit cell to
the volume of the unit cell, for which you need to know
the lattice parameter. This definition again comprises
90% of the electrons emerging from the specimen, so it
is consistent with our definition of d.
</p>
<p>There is some question as to whether this single-
scattering expression adequately describes the behavior
of b for either very thin or very thick foils, but it has
generally survived the test of time and its strength
remains in its simplicity.
</p>
<p>You should of course estimate/calculate b prior to
spending an inordinate amount of time trying to do an
experiment that is impossible for lack of sufficient reso-
lution. Prior simulation of the expected resolution
versus the necessary resolution to detect the phenom-
enon of interest can be very useful here, so let&rsquo;s discuss
how best to do this, particularly when the specimen
geometry is complex (e.g., multiple/overlapping phases)
so equation 36.1 is difficult to apply.
</p>
<p>When you can&rsquo;t apply equation 36.1, the best alter-
native is the Monte Carlo computer simulation, which
we introduced in Section 2.5, as a way of modeling
</p>
<p>electron scattering. Such simulations are used in a wide
variety of fields, including SEM and EPMA, as well as
other nuclear-particle fields, as a quick search of theWeb
will reveal. A full description ofMonte Carlo simulations
is beyond the scope of this text but good reference books
exist on the topic. In Joy&rsquo;s book, you&rsquo;ll find a code
listing for a Monte Carlo simulation program which
can be run on a PC. The public-domain Monte-Carlo
programs that do the best job are WinCASINO and
WinXRAY from Gauvin at McGill (see URLs #1 and
#2); thin-foil versions of this software are under devel-
opment. Until these are available, we recommend Joy&rsquo;s
software. These simulations are now extremely rapid,
and in a few minutes on a PC or Mac, they can provide
all the information you need to estimate the beam
spreading in more complex microstructures.
</p>
<p>Basically, the Monte Carlo technique simulates, in a
random manner (hence the name), a feasible set of elec-
tron paths through a defined specimen. After simulating
ideally several thousand paths, an approximate value of b
can be obtained by asking the computer to calculate the
diameter of a disk at the exit surface of the specimen that
contains 90% of the emerging electrons. This definition
of b is consistent with that described at the start, and is
the dimension of b given by equation 36.1. In fact, the
schematic trajectories in Figure 36.1A and B are Monte
Carlo simulations using Joy&rsquo;s software. Figure 36.2
shows Monte Carlo simulations of electron trajectories
at three points across an interface between Cu and Au.
Such a complex situation with elements of radically dif-
ferentZ cannot be easily handled by the single-scattering
model estimates of b from equation 36.1.
</p>
<p>While beam spreading is the main aspect of spatial-
resolution theories, we mustn&rsquo;t forget that what we
really want to know is the beam-specimen interaction
volume, which corresponds to the size of the X-ray
source. Monte Carlo simulations can help because in
principle they can
</p>
<p>&amp; Incorporate the effects of different kVs and beam
diameters
</p>
<p>&amp; Handle difficult specimen geometries, specimen tilt,
thickness variations, and multi-phase specimens
</p>
<p>&amp; Automatically calculate the effect of the depth dis-
tribution of X-ray production, j(rt), on the X-ray
source size
</p>
<p>&amp; Display the X-ray distribution generated anywhere
in your specimen, as a function of all the variable
parameters in equation 36.1, Nv, Z, and t. This tells
you the relative contributions to your XEDS spec-
trum from different parts of the microstructure.
</p>
<p>In addition to the theories of beam spreading that
we&rsquo;ve discussed, there are several more in the literature.
A common feature of these theories is that they all
predict a linear relationship between b and t3/2 and an

<p>inverse relationship between b and E0. If you&rsquo;re inter-
ested in the details of the various theories you&rsquo;ll find a
discussion in the Goldstein et al. 1986 paper. However,
we&rsquo;ll also see (look ahead to Figure 36.9 in Section
36.3.E) that there are ways to determine the spatial
resolution on-line while you&rsquo;re doing your analyses
and/or mapping and this is undoubtedly the best
approach, since it combines the simple equations
we&rsquo;ll now discuss with actual experiments rather than
calculations, which make assumptions about your
specimens.
</p>
<p>36.2.B The Spatial-Resolution Equation
</p>
<p>Nowwe&rsquo;ve defined d and b, all we have to do is combine
them to come up with a definition of R. If the intensity
distribution of the incident beam is Gaussian, and if the
beam emerging from the specimen retains a Gaussian
form, it is reasonable to add b and d in quadrature (just
as we did for image resolution back in Section 6.6.B) to
give a value for R

</p>
<p>Gaussian beam-broadening models are also available,
based on equation 36.1, which permit convolution of
the Gaussian descriptions of d and b to come up with a
definition of R. Based on the Gaussian model and
experimental measurements, Michael et al. proposed
that the definition ofR be modified so as not to present
the worst case (given by the exit-beam diameter)
but to define R midway through the foil, as shown in
Figure 36.3

Like all definitions of spatial resolution, there is no

<p>fundamental justification for the choice of various fac-
tors, such as the FWTM diameter and the selection of
the mid-plane of the foil at which to define R. Similarly,

<p>this approach ignores any contribution of electron dif-
fraction in crystalline specimens and beam tailing
beyond the 90% limit. Nevertheless, the definition has
been shown to be consistent with experimental results
and sophisticated Monte Carlo simulations (Williams
et al.). Finally, this definition retains the advantage of
the original single-scattering model, i.e., it has a simple
form and is easily amenable to calculation.
</p>
<p>36.2.C Measurement of Spatial Resolution
</p>
<p>Experimental measurements of the spatial resolution,
such as composition profiles measured across atomic-
ally sharp interfaces, are very useful (go back and look
at the profiles in Figure 1.4D). Several other kinds of
specimens have been proposed but using interphase
interfaces retains its validity since there are fewer
unknowns than for the other specimens. If thermody-
namic equilibrium exists on either side of the interface,
the solute content of each phase is well defined. Also,
interphase interfaces are common to many engineering
materials, as is evident from many images of such
defects throughout this text.
</p>
<p>In order to compare experimental and calculated
measurements of R, you have to understand how we
relate themeasured composition profile across the inter-
face to the actual discrete profile shape, shown schema-
tically in Figure 36.4. We do this by deconvolution of
the beam shape from the measured profile. The finite
beam size d and the effect of b degrade the sharp profile
to a width L which is related to R by the following
equation
</p>
<p>R &frac14; 1:414L (36:4)
</p>
<p>Assuming this relationship holds, we just measure the
distance L between the 2% and 98% points on the
profile, as shown in Figure 36.4. This spread contains
90% of the beam electrons, consistent with our assump-
tion of a 90% (FWTM) incident-beam diameter. In
practice, you will find it difficult to measure the 2%
and 98% points because of the errors in the experimen-
tal data. So you should measure the distance from the
10% to the 90% points on your profile, corresponding
to the beam spread containing 50% of the electrons
(FWHM), then multiply this distance by 1.8 to give
the FWTM.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this definition is easy to remember,
relatively easy to measure, consistent with the
</p>
<p>definitions of b and d, and, most importantly, gives a
number that is close to the experimentally measured
degradation of discrete composition changes introduced
by the beam-specimen interaction.
</p>
<p>It is obvious from equation 36.2, that if we want to
improve spatial resolution, then both d and b must be
minimized. Unfortunately, if we minimize d we reduce
the input beam current: for thermionic sources, if d
&lt;10 nm, count rates will become unacceptably low.
However, with a FEG, sufficient current (�1 nA) can
be generated in a small enough (1 nm) beam to permit
quantitative analyses with high spatial resolution.
</p>
<p>So if you have a thermionic source TEM
</p>
<p>&amp; Your specimen has to be thick enough that sufficient
counts are generated for quantification and b will be
the main contributor to R.
</p>
<p>&amp; Alternatively, you may have to increase the beam
size such that d dominates rather than b.
</p>
<p>A large beam is needed in that example in order to
generate sufficient beam current to get a reasonable X-
ray count rate at 100 kV. This is why 200&ndash;300 kV FEG
TEMs are the best high-resolution analysis instruments
</p>
<p>RESOLUTION IN XEDS
Equation 36.3 is the formal definition of the X-ray
spatial resolution.

<p>and Cs correction further improves the resolution (go
back and compare the segregation-profile widths in
Figure 35.11C and D) because you can keep the same
probe current while reducing the probe size by a factor
of �3�. New X-ray detectors with larger collection
angles would also help.
</p>
<p>There are some practical factors that can also limit
your experimental spatial resolution and the most
important is specimen drift. If your specimen or probe
drifts for mechanical or electrical reasons, then drift-
correction software should be used. If you&rsquo;re planning
to carry out analysis at the highest spatial resolution
where you&rsquo;re obliged to count for long times to accu-
mulate adequate X-ray intensity, then such software is
indispensable.
</p>
<p>In summary, the spatial resolution R is a function of
both the beam size and the beam spreading. You can get
a good estimate of R from equation 36.3. The theories
all indicate a t3/2 dependence for b, so thin specimens are
essential for the best resolution. Intermediate-voltage
</p>
<p>FEG sources, especially when augmented with Cs cor-
rectors, give sufficient beam current in sub-nm probes to
generate reasonable counts even from very thin speci-
mens and invariably give the best spatial resolution
which, as you can see from the calculations in Figure
36.5, can approach atomic dimensions.
</p>
<p>36.3 THICKNESS MEASUREMENT
</p>
<p>Given the t3/2 dependence of the beam spreading, you
can see the importance of knowing twhen estimating the
spatial resolution. You already know that t is also an
essential parameter in correcting for the absorption of
characteristic X-rays, as we saw in Section 35.6.
Furthermore, you should remember that knowledge of
t is important in high-resolution phase contrast imaging
andCBED.You&rsquo;ll also see inChapter 39 thatminimizing
t is critical to obtaining the best ionization-edge spectra in
EELS. So, in almost all TEM techniques, your specimen

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>has to be as thin as possible to get the best results
(although some CBED studies and many in-situ experi-
ments are notable exceptions to this generalization).
</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take the opportunity here to summarize the
methods available for measuring thickness. The meth-
ods are many and varied, and a full discussion of the
most important techniques will be found in other parts
of this book. The first point to consider is, what is t?
</p>
<p>This value of t depends both on the tilt of the speci-
men g, and the true thickness at zero tilt, t0. As shown in
Figure 36.6, for a parallel-sided foil
</p>
<p>t &frac14; t0
cos g
</p>
<p>(36:5)
</p>
<p>If your specimen is wedge-shaped, then t and t0will vary
in an arbitrary fashion depending on the foil shape.
</p>
<p>36.3.A TEM Methods
</p>
<p>In the TEM you can always make an estimate of your
specimen thickness if it is wedge-shaped (and crystal-
line). By tilting to two-beam conditions for strong
dynamical diffraction, the BF and DF images both
show thickness fringes, as we saw in Section 24.2.
These fringes occur at regions of constant thickness.
The intensity in the BF image falls to zero at a thickness
of 0.5xg at s=0. Therefore, to determine t, all you have
to do is look at the BF image and count the number (n)
of dark fringes from the edge of the specimen to the
analysis region. At that point t=(n &ndash; 0.5)xg assuming
that the thinnest part at the edge is &lt; 0.5xg thick. (Be
</p>
<p>very careful with this assumption.) Remember that the
value of xg varies with diffracting conditions and so the
g vector has to be specified. You can calculate xg from
the expression
</p>
<p>xg &frac14;
pO cos y
</p>
<p>l f &eth;y&THORN; (36:6)
</p>
<p>where O is the volume of the unit cell, l is the electron
wavelength, and f(y) is the atomic scattering amplitude.
Remember also that if you&rsquo;re not exactly at s = 0 then
the effective extinction distance xeff must be used.
</p>
<p>A related method relies on the presence of an
inclined planar defect adjacent to the analysis region.
The projected image of the defect, again under two-
beam conditions, will exhibit fringes, which can be
used to estimate the local thickness, or the projected
width, w, of the defect image using the expression
</p>
<p>t0 &frac14; w cot d (36:7)
</p>
<p>as shown in Figure 36.7 in which d is the angle between
the beam and the plane of the defect. Again, you have to
compensate geometrically to measure t rather than t0 if
the foil isn&rsquo;t normal to the beam, and then
</p>
<p>t &frac14; w&eth;cos d� tan g&THORN; (36:8)
</p>
<p>Of course, neither of these methods is applicable to non-
crystalline materials, and it is not always possible to find
a suitable inclined defect next to the analysis region in a
crystal. Furthermore, two-beam conditions are not
recommended for analysis because of the dangers of
anomalous X-ray emission (see Section 35.9 on
ALCHEMI for both an explanation of, and an excep-
tion to, this generalization). More insidious is the fact
that oxidation, during or after specimen preparation,

</p>
<p>beam-spreading equation.
</p>
<p>THE REAL THICKNESS
The thickness we are interested in is t; this is the
thickness through which the beam penetrates. It is
not necessarily the same as t0.
</p>
<p>36 .3 THICKNESS MEASUREMENT ............................................................................................................................................................. 669</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>means that your crystalline specimen may be coated
with an amorphous layer which will not be measured
by these diffraction-contrast techniques.
</p>
<p>Another method related to the TEM-image contrast
involves measurement of the relative transmission of
electrons. The intensity on the TEM screen decreases
with increasing thickness, all other things being equal.
You can use a Faraday cup to calibrate the intensity
falling on the screen and from this you can get a crude
measure of relative thickness, which can be converted
into an absolute measure of t if some absolute method is
used for calibration. But youmust be careful to make all
the intensity measurements on your specimen under the
same diffraction conditions and the same incident-beam
current but with no objective aperture. The only advan-
tage of this approach is that it is applicable to all mate-
rials, both amorphous and crystalline, but it is tedious
and not very accurate.
</p>
<p>36.3.B Contamination-Spot Separation Method
</p>
<p>This method, common in old (S)TEMs, but also com-
monly used by makers of dirty specimens, relies on the
</p>
<p>propensity of old instruments or contaminated foils to
generate carbon peaks on both top and bottom surfaces
of the specimen, at the point of analysis. If you tilt your
specimen by a large enough angle (g), you can see dis-
crete contamination spots (Figure 36.8). Their separa-
tion r, at a screen magnificationM, is related to t0 by the
following expression
</p>
<p>t0 &frac14;
r
</p>
<p>M sin g
(36:9)
</p>
<p>Matters get a little more complicated if the specimen
itself is tilted by an angle � when the contamination is
deposited. Then, as in the case of tilted planar defect,
you have to be careful to measure the thickness which
will determine the beam spreading and, as we&rsquo;ve taken
pains to point out, this is not t0 (the thickness at zero tilt)
but t
</p>

<p>very area you&rsquo;re looking at. Contamination degrades
the spatial resolution and increases the X-ray absorp-
tion. In fact, we spend a lot of time and effort trying to
minimize contamination, so it would be perverse to
propose it as a useful way of determining t. The only
redeeming feature is that this method measures t exactly
at the analysis point and the shape of the spots can
indicate if the beam or the specimen has drifted during
analysis. If you find yourself even thinking about using
this method, then your TEM should not be used for
analysis or you should clean up your specimen-prepara-
tion act.
</p>
<p>36.3.C Convergent-Beam Diffraction Method
</p>
<p>The CBED pattern which is visible on the TEM screen
when a convergent beam is focused on the specimen can
also be used to determine the thickness of crystalline
specimens. In Section 21.2, we described the procedure
to extract the thickness from the K-M fringe pattern
obtained under two-beam conditions. The CBED pat-
tern must come from a region thicker than 1xg or else
fringes will not be visible. Also the region of the foil
should be relatively flat and undistorted.
</p>
<p>Remember that for a totally clean, crystalline spec-
imen, CBED is the way to determine t at specific points
in your specimen.
</p>
<p>36.3.D Electron Energy-Loss Spectrometry
Methods
</p>
<p>Thickness information is present in the electron energy-
loss spectrum since the intensity of inelastically scat-
tered electrons increases with specimen thickness. In
essence, you have to measure the intensity under the
zero-loss peak (I0) and ratio this to the total intensity
in the spectrum (IT). The relative intensities are gov-
erned by the mean free path (l) for energy loss.
A parameterization formula for l (Malis et al. 1988)
and other EELS methods, are discussed in detail in
Section 39.5.
</p>
<p>We can apply the EELS parameterization to any
specimen, amorphous or crystalline. But the main
advantage is that it is possible to measure the thickness
sufficiently quickly that, unlike all the methods described
so far, the EELS method can also produce maps of
specimen thickness. Given that we have emphasized
the value of compositional mapping over point analyses
or line profiles, we have to conclude that EELS is best.
</p>
<p>36.3.E X-ray Spectrometry Method
</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re talking about X-ray spectrometry, it&rsquo;s good
to know that there are X-ray methods which can also
determine thickness.We can categorize these approaches,
which have been developed to solve the absorption-cor-
rection problem (see Section 35.6), into two types: the
first is the extrapolation method, which determines the
absorption correction by extrapolation ofX-ray intensity
ratios to zero thickness; the second uses the difference in
relative X-ray absorption between two emitted X-ray
lines (K and L, or L and M) from the same element.
Unfortunately, the extrapolation method is not easily
applicable to thin foils where compositions vary locally,
since you have to obtain a series of X-ray intensities from
different thickness areas (bymoving the incident beam or
by tilting the specimen). In the intensity-ratiomethod, the
essential requirement of two different X-ray lines from a
single element limits the application to specimens which
contain elements with Z &gt; 20 (Ca).
</p>
<p>All of these problems are solved using the z-factor
approach, as described in detail in 2006 byWatanabe and
Williams and in the companion text. The general expres-
sion (equation 35.18) for rt from the z-factor analysis can
bemodified forN different elements in the specimen, thus

<p>&eth;36:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>An iterative process is required to solve these equations
for both composition and thickness determination.
However, the iteration is straightforward and converges
rapidly; �10&ndash;15 iterations converge with &lt; 0.001 wt%
and 0.01 nm differences in composition and thickness,
respectively, which are clearly far more than sufficient
tolerance values for termination. Obviously, if X-ray
absorption is negligible in a specific material, the initial
mass-thickness and compositions are the final values
and the iteration is no longer necessary. The essential
point here is that in the z-factor method, the absorption-
corrected compositions can be determined simultaneously
with the specimen mass-thickness by only using X-ray
intensity data.
</p>
<p>This method is so quick and versatile that, like the
EELSmethods, it also permits directmapping of the thick-
ness at the same time as the composition is being mapped.
Therefore, there is nothing to stop you mapping out the
spatial resolution at the same time as doing your quantita-
tive mapping, as shown in Figure 36.9. Both the z-factor
and EELSmethods can handle amorphous and crystalline
specimens and Ohshima et al. compare the two methods.
</p>
<p>In summary, there are many methods for determin-
ing t, but none is universally convenient, accurate, and
</p>
<p>EELS FOR t
The EELS approach is highly recommended because
it is applicable over a wide range of thicknesses and
you can produce thickness maps of thin foils.
</p>
<p>36 .3 THICKNESS MEASUREMENT ............................................................................................................................................................. 671</p>
<p/>

<p>applicable. Beware; the various methods also measure
different thicknesses, such as only the crystalline thick-
ness, ignoring porosity and/or amorphous surface/oxide
films, or the full thickness including porosity and sur-
face films, or just the mass-thickness. Mitchell gives a
good case study of how to handle such problems. The
EELS and z-factor methods both have the possibility of
widespread, real-time use and can produce thickness
maps, so we recommend these. CBED is very useful
for individual point analyses of crystals.
</p>
<p>36.4 MINIMUM DETECTION
</p>
<p>Minimum detection is a measure of the smallest amount
of a particular element that can be detected with a
defined statistical certainty. Minimum detection and
spatial resolution are intimately related.
</p>
<p>As the spatial resolution improves, the analyzed
volume is smaller and, therefore, the signal intensity is
reduced. This reduction in signal intensity means that
the acquired spectrum will be noisier and small peaks
from trace elements will be less detectable and more
easily confused with artifact peaks. Accordingly, in the
AEM, the price that is paid for improved spatial resolu-
tion is a relatively poor minimum detection. By way of
comparison, Figure 36.10 compares the size of the ana-
lyzed volume in an EPMA, a TEM/STEM with a ther-
mionic source, and a dedicated STEMwith a FEG. The
enormous reduction in the beam-specimen interaction
volume explains the small signal levels that we obtain
in the TEM. However, as we&rsquo;ve noted on several occa-
sions, Cs correction gives more current in a smaller
probe so it offsets the traditional compromise. But
you should now understand why we have spent so
much time emphasizing the need to optimize your
beam current through use of higher-brightness sources,
optimizing the specimen-detector configuration, and
so on.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the minimum detectable mass (MDM)
is sometimes used; the MDM describes the smallest
amount of material (e.g., in mg or atoms) we can detect.

<p>can be mapped out (E). Knowing t, the spatial resolution, R, can also be
</p>
<p>mapped (F). Note the complex interaction of different atomic numbers
</p>
<p>and the variations in thickness in the resulting variations in R.
</p>
<p>MINIMUM DETECTION
One definition of minimum detection: the minimum
mass fraction (MMF) that can be measured in the
analysis volume. MMF represents the smallest con-
centration of an element (e.g., in wt% or ppm).
</p>

</p>
<p>tively. The MMF (�0.01%) in each analyzed volume would correspond
to �107 atoms, �300 atoms, and &lt;1 atom, respectively.
</p>
<p>A TRUISM
It is a feature of any analysis technique that an improve-
ment in spatial resolution is balanced by a worsening of
the detection limit (all other factors being equal).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use the MMF since materials scientists are
more used to thinking of composition in terms of wt%
or at.%.
</p>
<p>36.4.A Experimental Factors Affecting the MMF
</p>
<p>We can relate the MMF to the practical aspects of
analysis through the expression of Ziebold
</p>
<p>MMF / 1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
P&eth;P=B&THORN;nt
</p>
<p>p (36:12)
</p>
<p>Here P is the X-ray count rate in the characteristic
peak (above background) of the element of interest,
P/B is the peak-to-background count-rate ratio for
that peak (defined here in terms of the same width
for both P and B), and t is the analysis time for each
of n analyses.
</p>
<p>To increase P you can increase the current in the
beam by increasing the probe size and/or choosing a
thicker analysis region. To increase P/B you can
increase the operating voltage (E0), which is easy,
and decrease instrumental contributions to the back-
ground, which is not so easy (Lyman et al.). Improve-
ments in TEM design, such as using a high-brightness,
intermediate-voltage source, a Cs corrector if possi-
ble, and a larger collection angle for the XEDS will
also increase P. To increase P/B, you need a stable
instrument with a clean vacuum environment to mini-
mize or eliminate specimen damage and contamina-
tion. Improved stage design, to minimize stray
electrons and bremsstrahlung radiation, both of
which contribute background to the detected spec-
trum, will also help to increase P/B, as we discussed
back in Chapter 33.
</p>
<p>Remember that the Fiori definition of P/B is not the
one used in Ziebold&rsquo;s equation (36.12). If you actually
want to calculate the MMF, go back and check the
original references.
</p>
<p>The other variables in equation 36.12, are the time
of analysis (t) and how many analyses (n) that you do,
which are entirely within your control as operator.
Usually both n and t are a direct function of your
patience and the recommended coffee break is usually
the maximum time for any one analysis. With comput-
er control of the analysis procedure, however, there
should really be no limit to the time available for
analysis. Particularly when detection of very small
amounts of material is sought, t should be increased
to very long times. As computer control and stage
stability improve, acquisitions of several hours or over-
night are becoming feasible. Of course, the investment
of so much time in a single analysis is dangerous unless
you have judiciously selected the analysis region, and
you are confident that the time invested will be
rewarded with a significant result. Obviously, you
</p>
<p>should minimize factors that degrade the quality of
your analysis with time, such as contamination, beam
damage, and specimen drift. Therefore, you should
only carry out long analyses if your TEM is clean
(preferably UHV) and your specimen is also clean
and stable under the beam. Any specimen drift must
be corrected by computer control during the analysis,
unless your specimen is uniformly thin and homoge-
neous in composition, in which case why bother ana-
lyzing it?
</p>
<p>36.4.B Statistical Criterion for the MMF
</p>
<p>We can also define the MMF by a purely statistical
criterion. We discussed in Section 34.5 that we can be
sure a peak is present if the peak intensity is greater than
three times the standard deviation of the counts in the
background under the peak. From this criterion we can
come up with a definition of the detection limit which,
when combined with the Cliff-Lorimer equation
(assuming Gaussian statistics), gives the MMF (in
wt%) of element B in element A as
</p>
<p>CB&eth;MMF&THORN; &frac14;
3 2 I bB
� �
</p>
<p>1=2CA
</p>
<p>kAB IA � I bA
� � (36:13)
</p>
<p>where IbA and I
b
B are background intensities for ele-
</p>
<p>ments A and B; IA is the raw integrated intensity of peak
A (including background); CA is the concentration of A
(in wt%); and kAB
</p>
<p>&ndash;1 is the reciprocal of the Cliff-Lor-
imer k-factor. However, if we express the Cliff-Lorimer
equation as
</p>
<p>CA
</p>
<p>kAB IA � I bA
� � &frac14;
</p>
<p>CB
</p>
<p>IB � I bB
� � (36:14)
</p>
<p>and substitute it into equation 36.13, the MMF is
</p>
<p>CB&eth;MMF&THORN; &frac14;
3 2 I bB
� �
</p>
<p>1=2CB
</p>
<p>IB � I bB
(36:15)
</p>
<p>Experimentally, low count-rates from thin specimens
mean that typical values of MMF are in the range
0.1&ndash;1%, which is rather large compared with some
other analytical techniques. The best compromise in
terms of improvingMMFwhile maintaining X-ray spa-
tial resolution is to use high operating voltages
(300&ndash;400 kV) and thin specimens to minimize beam
broadening. The loss of X-ray intensity, P (or I), a
consequence of using thin specimens, can be compen-
sated in part by the higher voltages and/or by using an
FEG where a small spot size of 1&ndash;2 nm can still be
maintained. Obviously Cs-corrected TEMs will help
because of their ability to put even more current into
the same size probe. Figure 36.11 summarizes the classic

<p>compromise between resolution and detection and how
instrumentation improvements have continued to push
the limits over the past few decades.
</p>
<p>36.4.C Comparison with Other Definitions
</p>
<p>TheMMFdefinition is not the only waywe canmeasure
detection limits. Currie has noted at least eight defini-
tions in the analytical-chemistry literature. Currie
defined three specific limits.
</p>
<p>&amp; The decision limit: Do the results of your analysis
indicate detection or not (LC)?
</p>
<p>&amp; The detection limit: Can you rely on a specific anal-
ysis procedure to lead to detection (Ld)?
</p>
<p>&amp; The determination limit: Is a specific analysis proce-
dure precise enough to yield a satisfactory quantifi-
cation (Lq)?

<p>Comparison of these definitions with the statistical cri-

So, if you want to quantify an element, not just deter-
mine that it is present (Ld), then you need substantially
more (� 3�) of the element in your specimen. Rather
than do the experiment yourself, it is possible to simu-
late spectra from small amounts of element B in A (or
vice versa), using DTSA, as described in the companion
text. We recommend that you simulate your analysis
before embarking on a time-consuming experiment,
which may be futile because the amount of the element
you are seeking is below the MMF.
</p>
<p>36.4.D Minimum-Detectable Mass
</p>
<p>TheMMF values of fraction of a percent may seem poor
compared with other analytical techniques which report
ppm or even ppb detection limits. However, it&rsquo;s a differ-
ent matter if you calculate what theMMF translates to in
terms of the minimum detectable mass (MDM).
</p>
<p>Using data for the MMF of Cr in a 304L stainless
steel measured in a VG HB-501 AEM with an FEG,
Lyman and Michael obtained an MMF of 0.069 wt%
Cr in a 164 nm foil with a spatial resolution of 44 nm and
a 200 s counting time. The electron beam size was 2 nm
(FWTM)with a beam current of 1.7 nA. In this analysis,
an estimated 2 � 104 atoms were detected. The MDM
was less than 10&ndash;19 g. If the counting time is increased by
a factor of 10 and if the operating voltage is increased to
300 kV, the spatial resolution would improve to�15 nm
and the MMF would improve to �0.01 wt%. Thus
about 300 atoms could be detected. For a foil thickness
of 16 nm (1/10th the above measured thickness), the
MMF would degrade to �0.03 wt%. However, the
spatial resolution would improve to about 2 nm. For
this case, about 20 atoms would be detected correspond-
ing to less than 10&ndash;22 g, which is an amazing figure by
any standard. Experimental verification of this was
reported in 1999 by Watanabe and Williams: 2&ndash;5
atoms of Mn were detected in a 10-nm thick Cu-Mn
alloy film. With the advent of Cs-correction and
improved computer data analysis routines, single-atom

<p>detection is now a distinct possibility and Figure 36.12
shows calculated improvements in detection limits for
Mn atoms in solution in Cu in a Cs-corrected 300-kV
FEG TEM. Figure 36.13 shows how mapping of a
homogeneous solid solution can detect a few atoms at
each pixel. This last figure summarizes just about every-
thing we have discussed for AEMquantification andCs-
corrected mapping: (a) z-factor quantification (the
image is still noisy), (b) MSA data manipulation (the
image is much less noisy), (c) the importance of good
thin foils (specimen thickness is very uniform and
&lt; 20 nm in most areas), and (d) MDM close to 1&ndash;2
atoms is attainable (evenwhenmapping). Just to remind
you how good this is, go back and take a look at Figure
36.10. Consider that in the EPMA with a �1 mm3 exci-
tation volume and a 0.01wt%MMF, �3 million atoms
are detected in the analysis volume. SoXEDS in the best
Cs-corrected, intermediate-voltage, UHV, FEG TEM
</p>
<p>has an MDM detection limit that is several million
times better than an EPMA.
</p>
<p>While the best XEDS-TEM combinations are
approaching atomic-level detection and sub-nm spatial
resolution, it is not yet possible to detect single atoms
within individual atomic columns as is achievable in
EELS in similar, Cs-corrected, intermediate-voltage
FEG TEMs (see Chapter 39) so there is still room for
improvement, e.g., through larger collection angles and
more sophisticated data processing.

Optimizing spatial resolution and minimum detection in the same experiment is always a
compromise. You must decide which of the two criteria is more important for the result
you&rsquo;re seeking
</p>
<p>&amp; To get the best spatial resolution, operate with the thinnest foils and the highest energy
electron beam. Use an FEG if possible and a Cs corrector if you&rsquo;re lucky.

<p>&amp; To measure the specimen thickness use the z-factor method or the parameterized EELS
approach. If neither is possible, use CBED for a crystalline foil. If you&rsquo;re reduced to
contamination spots, find a better TEM or make cleaner specimens.
</p>
<p>&amp; To get the best MMF, use the brightest electron source, the largest possible beam, and
thickest specimen, and count for as long as possible with the shortest time constant.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you want the best resolution and MMF, a Cs-corrected, intermediate-voltage, UHV,
FEG TEM is essential, along with a clean specimen and computer-controlled drift
correction; patience is also equally essential.

<p>Electron Energy-Loss Spectrometers
and Filters
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>Electron energy-loss spectrometry (EELS) is the analysis of the energy distribution of
electrons that have come through the specimen. These electrons may have lost no energy
or may have suffered inelastic (usually electron-electron) collisions.
</p>
<p>These energy-loss events tell us a tremendous amount about the chemistry and the
electronic structure of the specimen atoms, which in turn reveals details of their bonding/
valence state, the nearest-neighbor atomic structure, their dielectric response, the free-
electron density, the band gap (if there is one), and the specimen thickness.
</p>
<p>In order to examine the spectrum of electron energies, we invariably use a magnetic-prism
spectrometer. As we sawwith X-rays, it is now common to form images of the various EELS
signals in addition to gathering spectra and to do this we use an energy filter, which is based
on the same magnetic-prism concept. Energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) is perhaps the most
powerful AEM technique, as should become apparent. The magnetic prism/energy filter is a
highly sensitive device with an energy resolution &lt;1 eV, even when the electron-beam
energy is as high as 300 keV.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll describe the operational principles of both the spectrometer and
filter, how to focus and calibrate them, and how to determine the collection semi-angle (b).
This angle affects the quality and interpretation of much of your experimental data. In
subsequent chapters, we&rsquo;ll go on to look at the spectra and images in more detail and the
information they contain.
</p>
<p>The EELS technique is an excellent complement to, and is now more widely used than
the somewhat simpler XEDS, since it offers substantially more information than mere
elemental identification and is well suited to the detection of light elements, which are
difficult to analyze with XEDS.
</p>
<p>37.1 WHY DO EELS?
</p>
<p>So why should we do EELS when XEDS can identify
and quantify the presence of all elements above Li in the
periodic table with a spatial resolution approaching a
few atoms and analytical sensitivity close to the single-
atom level? Well, in fact EELS does even more than
XEDS in that it can detect and quantify all the elements
in the periodic table and is especially good for analyzing
the light elements. Furthermore, EELS offers even bet-
ter spatial resolution and analytical sensitivity (both at
the single-atom level) in addition to providing much
more than just elemental identification as indicated in
the preview. So the next question is, why bother with
XEDS at all? The answer to this is that EELS, as you
will see, can be a challenging experimental technique; it
</p>
<p>requires very thin specimens to get the best information
and understanding and processing the spectra and
images requires somewhat more of a physics back-
ground than XEDS.
</p>
<p>The main point that you need to understand is that
XEDS and EELS are highly complementary techniques;
most AEMs come equipped with both kinds of
spectrometer.
</p>
<p>37.1.A Pros and Cons of Inelastic Scattering
</p>
<p>When a high-energy electron traverses a thin specimen it
can either emerge unscathed or it loses energy by a
variety of processes that we first discussed way back in
Chapter 4. EELS separates these inelastically scattered
electrons into a spectrum, which we can interpret and
</p>
<p>37 .1 WHY DO EELS? ................................................................................................................................................................................ 679</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>quantify, form images or DPs from electrons of specific
energy, and also combine the spectra and images via
spectrum imaging, as we&rsquo;ve already seen for XEDS (see
Section 33.6.C). Throughout the book, we&rsquo;ve already
seen some contrasting aspects of inelastic scattering
</p>
<p>&amp; Kikuchi lines and HOLZ lines occur in DPs; the
electrons in these lines are diffracted very close to
the Bragg angle, and give us much more accurate
crystallographic information than the SAD/CBED
(spot/disk) pattern. In thick specimens, many of the
electrons in these lines are inelastically scattered, so
thicker specimens can be useful.
</p>
<p>&amp; Conversely, the background intensity that surrounds
the direct beam in DPs, obscuring faint spots in
SADPs and fine detail in CBDPs is due to inelastic
scatter. So if you can remove (i.e., filter out) these
electrons, you can considerably enhance the quality
of your DPs.
</p>
<p>&amp; Chromatic aberration is due to energy-loss electrons
following different paths through the objective lens
and limits the image resolution in thick specimens.
You can avoid this by using very thin specimens, but
if you&rsquo;re stuck with a thick specimen then you can
restore the quality of your images by filtering out
inelastic electrons thus removing specimen-induced
chromatic-aberration effects.
</p>
<p>&amp; Specimen damage, which is usually undesirable, is
often caused by inelastic interactions and there isn&rsquo;t
much you can do about this, as we discussed back in
Chapter 4.
</p>
<p>&amp; In Chapter 4, we also discussed many of the other
ways that electrons could lose energy going through
the specimen, producing X-rays and other phenom-
ena such as plasmons and phonons. These and other
interactions produce energy-loss electrons, which
contain useful information about the electronic
structure and elemental makeup of your specimen.
</p>
<p>In fact, if yourAEMhas an energy-loss spectrometer
or filter, then inelastic scattering, in general, is some-
thing you should want to happen in your specimens
because, if it didn&rsquo;t happen, TEM would be a much
less useful technique and this book would be several
chapters shorter (so we at least are happy).
</p>
<p>The technique of EELS predates X-ray spectrome-
try. In fact, the experimental pioneers of EELS, Hillier
and Baker (1944), were the same two scientists who first
proposed and patented the idea of X-ray spectrometry
in an electron-beam instrument, similar to the EPMA. If
you want to read a brief history of the technique, see the
classic book by Egerton. We&rsquo;ll refer to the second
edition of Egerton&rsquo;s text on many occasions. In contrast
to X-ray analysis, EELS was relatively slow to develop,
but is now perhaps the dominant spectrometry tech-
nique on probe-forming TEMs for the reasons we gave
at the start of the chapter.
</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished this set of chapters, you should
find Egerton&rsquo;s book to be highly informative and like-
wise, the multi-author text on energy-filtered imaging,
edited by Reimer. Every 4 years since 1990, there has
been an international, focused workshop on EELS and
related techniques in the TEM (URL #1) and the pro-
ceedings have been published in special issues of various
EM journals, as noted in the reference list.
</p>
<p>37.1.B The Energy-Loss Spectrum
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start as we did for XEDS by looking at a typical
spectrum such as Figure 37.1. We won&rsquo;t go into detail
here but will save that for the subsequent chapters. For
the time being, it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that we split up
the spectrum into the low-loss and high-loss regions,
with � 50 eV being the somewhat arbitrary break
point. It isn&rsquo;t particularly apparent from the figure,
but we&rsquo;ll see later that the low-loss region contains
electronic information from the more weakly bound
conduction and valence-band electrons, while the high-
loss region contains primarily elemental information
from the more tightly bound, core-shell electrons and
also details about bonding and atomic distribution. For
the time being, you should note that
</p>
<p>&amp; the zero-loss peak is very intense, which can be both

increasing energy loss, reaching negligible levels

</p>
<p>37.2 EELS INSTRUMENTATION
</p>
<p>Throughout this and the subsequent chapters, we&rsquo;ll dis-
tinguish between spectrometers and energy filters (so
called because they filter out electrons of specific
energy). The former primarily produce spectra and are
great for the dedicated spectroscopist. The latter can
produce spectra but are designed to create images and
so are more useful to microscopists who find spectra
boring and who want filtered images and DPs to com-
pare with standard ones produced by their TEM. There
is only one kind of spectrometer commercially available,
manufactured by Gatan, Inc. termed a parallel-collec-
tion EELS or PEELS. The PEELS is a magnetic-prism
(sometimes called a magnetic-sector) system and is
mounted on a TEM or STEM after the viewing screen
or post-specimen detectors. There are two kinds of fil-
ters which result in radically different instruments
which, nevertheless, perform similar functions. We&rsquo;ll
describe these two types in some detail throughout the
chapter.
</p>
<p>The post-column Gatan Image Filter (GIF) is a
development of their magnetic-prism PEELS. The in-
column filter, a magnetic variant of the original Cas-
taing-Henry magnetic prism/electrostatic mirror, is
exemplified by the Omega (O) filter, pioneered by Zeiss
and also now used by JEOL. The in-column filter, as the
name implies, is integrated into the TEM and sits
between the specimen and the viewing screen/detector
(rather than being an optional addition, like the PEELS/
GIF). Magnetic spectrometers, along with electrostatic
or combined electrostatic/magnetic systems, have been
the subject of serious reviews byMetherell and Egerton.
If you&rsquo;re an instrument enthusiast, you should try to
read these articles but if you just want a more concise
summary, then try Egerton&rsquo;s chapter in Ahn&rsquo;s edited
book.
</p>
<p>Surface scientists use electron spectrometers to mea-
sure exceedingly small (meV) energy losses in low-
energy electron beams reflected from the surfaces of
samples in UHV instrumentation, such as XPS and
Auger systems. We will deal only with transmission
EELS studies of high-voltage TEM beams. Recent
advances in monochromators for electron guns, com-
bined with spherical and chromatic aberration correc-
tion, mean that energy resolution &lt;100 meV is now
possible and in the near future this will open a whole
new field of TEM-based EELS studies, complementing
the established, surface-science techniques but with
much better lateral resolution.
</p>
<p>Whether you use a Gatan post-column PEELS, a
GIF, or an O filter, the electron passes through one or
more magnetic spectrometers, so we&rsquo;ll start by discuss-
ing the principles of this basic tool before moving on to
the more complex filtering systems.
</p>
<p>37.3 THE MAGNETIC PRISM:
A SPECTROMETER AND A LENS
</p>
<p>The magnetic prism spectrometer is preferred to an
electrostatic or combined magnetic/electrostatic spec-
trometer, for several reasons
</p>
<p>&amp; It is compact and easily interfaced to the TEM.
(Remember the WDS problem.)
</p>
<p>&amp; It offers sufficient energy resolution to distinguish
spectra from all the elements in the periodic table
and so is ideal for analysis.
</p>
<p>&amp; Electrons in the energy range 100&ndash;400 keV, typical of
AEMs, can be dispersed sufficiently to detect the
spectrum electronically, without limiting the energy
resolution.
</p>
<p>The basic PEELS-TEM interface and ray paths are
shown in Figure 37.2 and a picture of a Gatan spectrom-
eter (actually a combination imaging spectrometer),
which would be installed beneath the camera system of
a TEM, is shown in Figure 37.3. Because these spectrom-
eters are so widespread, many of the numerical
values in this chapter are taken from the Gatan litera-
ture (see URL #2). For the details of operation you
should, of course, read the instruction manual and
Brydson gives a concise summary of all the experimental
steps.
</p>
<p>From Figure 37.2B, you can see that electrons are
selected by a variable entrance aperture (diameters: 1, 2,
3, or 5 mm in theGatan system). (Obviously, you have to
make sure the screen is raised and any on-axis detectors
or cameras are removed in order to detect the spectrum.)
The electrons travel down a &lsquo;drift tube&rsquo; (Figure 37.2A)
through the spectrometer and are deflected through
� 908 by the magnetic field. Electrons that have lost
</p>
<p>ENERGY FILTERS
Two types of commercial filters are presently manu-
factured: the post-column filter and the in-column
filter.

<p>energy are deflected further than those suffering zero
loss. A spectrum is thus formed in the dispersion plane,
consisting of a distribution of electron intensity (I) ver-
sus energy loss (E). You can see that this process is
closely analogous to the dispersion of white light by a
glass prism shown in the inset.
</p>
<p>Now if you look at Figure 37.2B, you&rsquo;ll see that
electrons suffering the same energy loss but traveling
in both on-axis and off-axis directions are also brought
back to a focus in the dispersion (or image) plane of the
spectrometer. So the prism also acts as a magnetic lens.
This focusing action is not seen in the otherwise-analo-
gous glass prism (if you recall your high-school physics
lab, you had to use a post-prism convex lens to focus the
spectrum and separate the individual colors (i.e., fre-
quencies/energies)). We&rsquo;ll give many examples of EEL
spectra in the subsequent chapters.
</p>
<p>37.3.A Focusing the Spectrometer
</p>
<p>Because the spectrometer is also a lens, you have to
know how to focus it, and how to minimize the aberra-
tions and astigmatism that are inherent in any magnetic
lens. The latest spectrometers are fully corrected for
third-order aberrations and the alignment, compensa-
tion for stray-AC fields, and focusing are all software
controlled. So read the manual, because we will not
reproduce it here, merely describe the principles.
</p>
<p>The spectrometer has to focus the electrons because
off-axis electrons experience a different magnetic field to
on-axis electrons. The spectrometer is an axially asym-
metric lens unlike the other TEM lenses. The path length
of off-axis electrons through the magnet also varies, and
the magnet has to be carefully constructed to ensure
correct compensation for different electron paths so
that focusing occurs. This correction is achieved by
machining the entrance and exit faces of the spectrometer
so they are not normal to the axial rays, as shown in

<p>NOTATION
Although we&rsquo;ve consistently used the letter E for
energy, energy-loss should, therefore, be denoted by
DE since it&rsquo;s a change in energy. However, it is a
convention in the EELS literature to use E inter-
changeably for both an energy loss (e.g., the plasmon
loss Ep) and a specific energy (e.g., the critical ioniza-
tion energy EC). So we will use E (note the different
font) but remember, it really means a change in E.

<p>Figure 37.2B. These non-normal faces also act to ensure
that electrons traveling out of the plane of the paper in
Figure 37.2B are also focused in the dispersion plane, as
shown in Figure 37.2C (because it focuses in two planes
we call it &lsquo;double focusing&rsquo;). The faces of the prism are
curved tominimize aberrations and, like their counterparts
within the TEM column, the spectrometer lenses continue
to improve as higher-order aberrations are minimized. The
many quadrupoles, sextupoles, and other focusing
electronics and lenses are not shown, but the length of
the spectrometer in Figure 37.3 (and looking ahead to
Figure 37.15) gives you some idea of its complexity.
</p>
<p>As with any lens, the spectrometer takes electrons ema-
nating from a point in an object plane and brings them
back to a point in the image (dispersion) plane. Because the
spectrometer is an asymmetric lens, we have to fix both the
object distance and image distance if we want to keep the
spectrum in focus. The object plane of the spectrometer or
filter depends on the detail of the machine you are using
</p>
<p>&amp; In DSTEMs with no post-specimen lenses the object
plane for a post-column spectrometer is the plane of
the specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; In a TEM/STEM, or a DSTEM with post-specimen
lenses, the object plane for a post-column spectrom-
eter is the back-focal plane of the projector lens,
which can contain either an image or a DP.
</p>
<p>&amp; In a TEM/STEM, or a DSTEM with post-specimen
lenses, the object plane for an in-column filter is the
back-focal plane of the first projector (or intermedi-
ate) lens, which can contain either an image or a DP.
</p>
<p>In a TEM, the projector-lens setting is usually fixed,
so the object plane is fixed and the manufacturer usually
sets this plane to coincide with the differential pumping
aperture separating the column from the viewing cham-
ber. In someDSTEMs there are no post-specimen lenses
so the object plane of the spectrometer is the plane of the
specimen. In this case, it is essential that you keep your
specimen height constant.
</p>
<p>In practice, the back-focal plane of the projector may
move slightly as you change operatingmodes (for example,
from TEM to STEM) and so you have to be able to adjust
the spectrometer. You do this by looking at the electrons
that come through the specimenwithout losing any energy.
These electrons have a Gaussian-shaped intensity distribu-
tion called the zero-loss peak (ZLP), which we&rsquo;ll talk about
more in the next chapter. You can see the ZLP on the
computer display of the EELS system and the software
focuses it by adjusting a pair of pre-spectrometer quadru-
poles until it has a minimum width and maximum height.
</p>
<p>The consistency of the information passed through
the spectrometer is described by the transmissivity, which
is the imaged area (object radius) as a function of the
solid scattering angle for a given energy resolution. A
perfect spectrometer would uniformly transmit electrons
of a specific energy loss over the whole spectrumor, more
</p>
<p>importantly, over the whole image. If the ZLP is scanned
across the spectrometer slit, then a uniform intensity
should fall on the detector. Deviations from uniformity
reflect the aberrations in the spectrometer; see the paper
by Uhlemann and Rose for the details.
</p>
<p>37.3.B Spectrometer Dispersion
</p>
<p>We define the dispersion as the distance in the spectrum
(dx) between electrons differing in energy by dE. It is a
function of the strength of the magnetic field (which is
governed by the strength (i.e., size) of the spectrometer
magnet) and the energy of the incident beam E0. For the
Gatan magnet, the radius of curvature (R) of electrons
traveling on axis is about 200 mm, and for 100-keV
electrons dx/dE is � 2 mm/eV. For PEELS this disper-
sion value is inadequate and typically electrons with an
energy range of about 15 eV would fall on each 25-mm
wide diode. Therefore, the dispersion plane has to be
magnified � 15� before the spectrum can be detected
with resolution closer to 1 eV. This magnification
requires post-spectrometer lenses and four quadrupoles
are used. The dispersion should be linear across the
PDA (photo-diode array); you can check this by mea-
suring the separation of a known pair of spectral fea-
tures (e.g., zero loss and C K edge) as you displace the
spectrum across different parts of the PDA.
</p>
<p>37.3.C Spectrometer Resolution
</p>
<p>We define the energy resolution of the spectrometer as
the FWHMof the focused ZLP and, while it might seem
trivial, you should remember to focus the spectrometer
every time you acquire a spectrum or filtered image. The
type of electron source determines the resolution. As we
saw back in Chapter 5 (Table 5.1), at � 100 keV a W
source has the worst energy resolution (�3 eV), a LaB6
is slightly better at�1.5 eV, a Schottky field emitter can
give �0.7 eV, and a cold FEG gives the best value of
�0.3 eV. These values will all get slightly worse at higher
keV. Because of the high emission current from ther-
mionic sources, the energy resolution is limited by elec-
trostatic interactions between electrons at the filament
crossover. This electron-electron interaction is called
the Boersch effect. We can partially overcome this
limit by undersaturating the filament and using only
the electrons in the halo. Then a LaB6 source can attain
a resolution of �1 eV but at the expense of a consider-
able loss of current, which we can compensate for by
increasing the beam size and/or the C2 aperture. There
are other ways you can improve the energy resolution,
for example, dropping the kV and the probe current.
Figure 37.4A shows data from a cold FEG operated at
200 keV delivering a FWHM of 370 meV (0.37 eV)
which is about the best that can be obtained under
standard operating conditions.
</p>
<p>37 .3 THE MAGNET IC PR I SM : A S PECTROMETER AND A LENS ......................................................................................................... 683</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The energy resolution decreases slightly as the
energy loss increases, but it should be no worse than
�1.5� the ZLP width up to 1000 eV energy loss.
</p>
<p>If you operate at a higher voltage you should also
expect a degradation of energy resolution as the kV
increases, approximately tripling from 100 to 400 kV.
</p>
<p>Because the magnetic prism is so sensitive, external
magnetic fields in the microscope room may limit the
resolution. If you have an older PEELS, you may see a
disturbance to your spectrum if you sit in a metal chair
and move around or if you open metal doors into the
TEM room, so fine, hand-carved chairs are de rigeur for
old EELS operators.
</p>
<p>The best energy resolution requires a small projector
crossover and a small (1 or 2mm) entrance aperture giv-
ing a collection semi-angle of � 10 mrads (see Section
37.4.B below). A larger entrance aperture degrades the
resolution because the off-axis beams suffer aberrations.
The resolution may change as you deflect the ZLP onto
different regions of the PDA, although this should not
happen if your spectrometer is properly aligned.
</p>
<p>37.3.D Calibrating the Spectrometer
</p>
<p>We can calibrate the spectrometer (in terms of eV/chan-
nel, just like an XEDS) by placing an accurately known
voltage on the drift tube, or changing the accelerating
voltage slightly, both of which displace the spectrum by
a known, fixed amount. Figure 37.4B shows images of
the ZLP displaced by a known amount, thus defining
both the resolution and the dispersion of the spectrom-
eter at the same time. Usually, calibration is automa-
tically handled by the software but, if you have a really
early system, you can (as in XEDS) look for features in a
spectrum from a known specimen that occur at specific
energies, such as the ZLP at 0 eV and the Ni L3 ioniza-
tion edge at 855 eV. Modern electronics are reasonably
stable and the calibration doesn&rsquo;t shift substantially but,
unless you have the PEELS, which automatically com-
pensates for energy and current drift, you have to check
these regularly throughout an operating session since, if
shifts of even a few eV occur, they are of the same order
as the energy resolution of the spectrometer.
</p>
<p>37.4 ACQUIRING A SPECTRUM
</p>
<p>To gather a spectrum, such as shown in Figure 37.1, we
need a recording device in the dispersion plane of the
spectrometer. Historically this was photographic film
and early commercial PEELS had a semiconductor
PDA but now a CCD is used, in common with both

<p>GIFs andO filters (we talked about CCDs in Chapter 7).
CCDs show lower gain variation, �30� better sensitiv-
ity, higher dynamic range, and improved energy resolu-
tion compared with PDAs. It&rsquo;s worth a brief aside to
mention serial EELS or SEELS which was the first com-
mercial method of recording spectra around 1980. While
it offered some advantages, SEELSwas slow and tedious
since each energy loss channel was recorded sequentially
and it was rapidly superseded by PEELS which gathers
the whole energy range simultaneously. The Gatan
PEELS uses a YAG scintillator coupled via fiber optics
to a PDAorCCD in the dispersion plane of the spectrom-
eter, as shown in Figure 37.5. Since many PDA-PEELS
systems are still in use, it is worth describing its operation
and limitations, The PDA consists of 1024 electrically
isolated and thermoelectrically cooled Si diodes, each
�25 mmacross. The integration time to gather a spectrum
can vary from a few msec to several hundred seconds
depending on the intensity of the signal. Because each
diode saturates at �16,000 counts you have to select an
integration time that avoids saturation during any single
acquisition, and you can then sum as many individual
integration times as you need to give a spectrum of the
desired quality. The CCD detector is 100� 1340 array of
20 mm pixels and does not saturate rapidly like the PDA
so acquisition is much more straightforward. After
</p>
<p>integration, the whole spectrum is read out via an ampli-
fier through an A/D converter and into the computer
display system. The Gatan software offers a variety of
standard acquisition conditions suited to different types
of spectra.
</p>
<p>37.4.A Image and Diffraction Modes
</p>
<p>When using any spectrometer or filter in a TEM/STEM,
we can operate in one of twomodes, and the terminology
for this is confusing. If we operate the TEM such that an
image is present on the viewing screen then the back-focal
plane of the projector lens contains a DP, which the post-
column spectrometer uses as its object. From the spectro-
scopist&rsquo;s viewpoint, therefore, this is termed &lsquo;diffraction
mode&rsquo; or &lsquo;diffraction coupling,&rsquo; but from the microscop-
ist&rsquo;s viewpoint, it is more natural to call this &lsquo;image
mode&rsquo; since we are looking at an image on the screen.
Conversely, if you adjust the microscope so a DP is
projected onto the screen (which includes STEM mode
in a TEM/STEM), then the (post-column) spectrometer/
GIF object plane contains an image, and the terminology
is reversed. Likewise, as we&rsquo;ll see for an in-column filter,
the back-focal plane of the intermediate lens onwhich the
filter is focused can contain either an image (diffraction
mode; there&rsquo;s a DP on the TEM screen) or a DP (image
mode; there&rsquo;s an image on the TEM screen).
</p>
<p>&amp; The spectroscopist uses the term image coupling and
the microscopist says diffraction mode.
</p>
<p>&amp; In this text, imagemodemeans an image is present on
the TEM screen; naturally, we use the microscopists&rsquo;
terminology. You should not use this mode for any
spectroscopy, only for EFTEM imaging.
</p>
<p>&amp; You should use diffraction (or STEM) mode for all
spectroscopy and imaging, except forEFTEMimaging.
</p>
<p>&amp; Both sets of terms appear in the earlier literature,
often without precise definition, so it can be rather
confusing, but the microscopists have generally won
this conflict.
</p>
<p>37.4.B Spectrometer-Collection Angle
</p>
<p>The collection angle (as before, we really mean semi-
angle) of the spectrometer (b) is a most important vari-
able in several aspects of EELS, so you should know b
for all your usual operating modes. If you do gather
spectra with different b it is difficult to make sensible
comparisons without considerable post-acquisition pro-
cessing. Poor control of the collection angle is the most
common error in quantification, although it is less
important the higher the value of b that you use. The
detailed intensity variations in the spectrum depend on
the range of electron-scattering angles gathered by the
spectrometer. Under certain circumstances, the effective
value of b can be modified if the beam-convergence

<p>angle a is&gt; b, but we&rsquo;ll discuss that when we talk about
quantification of ionization edges in Chapter 39. Like-
wise, we&rsquo;ll see that there is a characteristic or most-
probable scattering angle for specific loss processes
and typically, b should be 2&ndash;3� that angle. So, if in
doubt, make b larger. The value of b is affected by
your choice of operating mode, and so we will describe
how to measure b under different conditions that you
may encounter and, while the Gatan software can cal-
culate the value for you, it&rsquo;s good to know the principles
behind the black box. Let&rsquo;s start by considering themost
simple definition for b, as illustrated in Figure 37.6.
</p>
<p>Dedicated STEMs. In a basic DSTEM the situation is
straightforward if there are no post-specimen lenses
because, as shown in Figure 37.6, b can be calculated
from simple geometry. Depending on the diameter (d) of
the spectrometer entrance aperture and the distance from
the specimen to the aperture (h), b (in radians) is given by
</p>
<p>b �
d
</p>
<p>2h
(37:1)
</p>
<p>This value is approximate and assumes b is small. Since
h is not a variable, the range of b is controlled by the
number and size of the spectrometer apertures. There-
fore, if h is �100 mm, then for a 1-mm diameter aper-
ture, b is 5 mrads. If there are post-specimen lenses and
apertures, the situation is similar to that in a TEM/
STEM, as we discuss below.
</p>
<p>TEM-imagemode. Remember that, in imagemode, a
magnified image of the specimen is present on the view-
ing screen or detector. In contrast to what we just
described for a dedicated STEM, the angular distribu-
tion of electrons entering the spectrometer aperture
below the center of the TEM screen is independent of
the entrance-aperture size. This is because we control
the angular distribution of electrons contributing to any
TEM image by the size of the objective aperture in the
back-focal plane of the objective lens. If we don&rsquo;t use an
objective aperture then the collection angle is very large
(&gt;�100 mrads) and need not be calculated accurately
because we&rsquo;ll see that small differences in a large b do
not affect the spectrum or subsequent quantification.
</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you do wish to calculate b in
image mode with no aperture inserted, you need to
know the magnification of the DP in the back-focal
plane of the projector lens (which is the front-focal
plane of the spectrometer). As you will recall, this mag-
nification is controlled by the camera length L of the
DP, and this is given by
</p>
<p>L �
D
</p>
<p>M
(37:2)
</p>
<p>where D is the distance from the projector crossover to
the recording plane and M is the magnification of the
image in that plane. So if D is about 500 mm and the
screenmagnification is 10,000� thenL is 0.05mm. Thus
we can show
</p>
<p>b �
r0
</p>
<p>L
(37:3)
</p>
<p>where r0 is the maximum radius of the DP in the focal
plane of the spectrometer. Typically, r0 is�5 mm, and so
b is 0.1 rads or 100mrad which, as we just said, is so large
that we rarely need to know it accurately. In fact, in
TEM-image mode without an objective aperture, if you
just assume b = 100 mrads, any calculation or quantifi-
cation you do will be effectively independent of b.
</p>
<p>If you insert an objective aperture and you know its
size and the focal length of the objective lens then b can
easily be calculated geometrically. To a first approxima-
tion, in a similar manner to equation 37.1, b is the
objective-aperture diameter divided by twice the focal
length of the objective lens, as shown in Figure 37.7. For
example, with a focal length of 3 mm and a 30 mm
diameter aperture, b is � 5 mrads, which is good if you
need high-energy resolution.

<p>If you insert an objective aperture, a normal BF image
can be seen on the TEM screen and the information in the
spectrum is related to the area of the image that sits
directly above the spectrometer-entrance aperture. How-
ever, as we&rsquo;ll see in Section 37.4.C, there is some consider-
able error (� 100 nm) due to chromatic aberration. We
will return to this point in Section 39.10 when we discuss
the spatial resolution. Remember also that with the objec-
tive aperture inserted, you cannot do XEDS, so simulta-
neous EELS and XEDS is not possible in this mode.
</p>
<p>TEM/STEM diffraction mode. In diffraction (also
STEM) mode, the situation is a little more complicated.
We focus the spectrometer on an image of the specimen;
so we see a DP on the screen and also in the plane of the
spectrometer-entrance aperture. Under these circum-
stances, you control b by your choice of the spectrom-
eter-entrance aperture.
</p>
<p>If a small objective aperture is inserted, it is possible
that it may limit b; the effective value of b at the back
focal plane of the projector lens is b/M where M is the
magnification of the image in the back focal plane of the
projector lens.
</p>
<p>You have to calibrate b from the DP of a known
crystalline specimen, as shown in Figure 37.8. Knowing
the size of the spectrometer-entrance aperture, the value
of b can be calibrated because the distance (b) that
separates the 000 spot and a known hkl maximum is
twice the Bragg angle, 2yB. If the effective aperture
diameter in the recording plane (equivalent to the

is deff and b = 2y then

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If we choose a camera length such that the image of
the specimen in the back focal plane of the spectrometer
is at a magnification of 1�, then, in effect, we have
moved the specimen to the focal plane of the spectrom-
eter. This special value of L is equal to D, which you
should know for your ownmicroscope. Then b is simply
the entrance aperture diameter divided byDA (610mm).
</p>
<p>In summary, the collection angle is a crucial factor in
EELS and the spectrometer/filter software should cal-
culate the values of b in the various operating conditions
that you&rsquo;ll encounter.
</p>
<p>&amp; Generally, large collection angles will give high
intensity but poor energy resolution.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you collect your spectrum in image mode without
an objective aperture then you won&rsquo;t compromise
your energy resolution but spatial resolution is
poor, as we&rsquo;ll see below.
</p>
<p>&amp; If you&rsquo;re in diffraction mode and you control b with
the entrance aperture, then a large aperture (high
intensity, high b) will lower the resolution and vice
versa.
</p>
<p>&amp; Generally, smaller collection angles also give a higher
signal-to-noise ratio in the spectrum.
</p>
<p>37.4.C Spatial Selection
</p>
<p>Depending on whether you&rsquo;re operating in image or
diffraction mode, you obtain your spectrum from dif-
ferent regions of the specimen. In TEM-image mode, we
position the area to be analyzed on the optic axis, above
the entrance aperture. The area selected is a function of
the aperture size demagnified back to the plane of the
specimen. For example, if the image magnification is
100,000� at the recording plane and the effective
entrance aperture size at the recording plane is 1mm,
then the area contributing to the spectrum is 10 nm. So,
you might think that you can do high spatial resolution
analysis without a probe-forming STEM. However, if
you&rsquo;re analyzing electrons that have suffered a signifi-
cant energy loss, they may have come from areas of the
specimen well away from the area you selected, because
of chromatic aberration. This displacement d is given by
</p>
<p>d &frac14; y Df (37:7)
</p>
<p>where y is the angle of scatter, typically &lt; 10 mrads,
and Df is the defocus error due to chromatic aberration
given by
</p>
<p>Df &frac14; Cc
E
</p>
<p>E0
(37:8)
</p>
<p>where Cc is the chromatic-aberration coefficient. So if
we take a typical energy loss E of 284 eV (the energy
required to eject a carbon K-shell electron) and we have
a beam energy E0 of 100 keV, then the defocus due to
</p>
<p>chromatic aberration (with Cc = 3 mm) will be close to
10 mmwhich gives an actual displacement, d, of 10&ndash;4mm
or 100 nm. This figure is very large compared to the
value of 10 nm, whichwe calculated without considering
chromatic-aberration effects.
</p>
<p>In TEM diffraction mode, you select the area of the
specimen contributing to the DP in the usual way. You
can use either the SAD aperture, which has a lower limit
of about 5 mm, or you can form a fine beam as in STEM
so that a CBED pattern appears on the screen. In the
latter case, the area you select is a function of the beam
size and the beam spreading, but is generally &lt; �50nm
wide. Therefore, this method is best for high spatial
resolution EELS, just as for XEDS analysis. But rather
than just selecting a single point, it is much better to keep
the beam scanning and gather a spectrum at every point
(i.e., spectrum imaging; see Section 37.8). This conclusion
is true for both in-column and post-column filtering.
</p>
<p>37.5 PROBLEMS WITH PEELS
</p>
<p>There are several standard tests you need to perform to
determine that all is well with the PEELS PDA and
electronics, just as we described for XEDS back in
Chapters 32 and 33.
</p>
<p>37.5.A Point-Spread Function
</p>
<p>In a PEELS, you can reduce the magnification of your
spectrum so that the ZLP occupies a single PDA channel
or pixel on the CCD. Any intensity registered outside
that channel is an artifact of the system and is called the
point-spread function (PSF). This function acts to
degrade the inherent resolution of themagnetic spectrom-
eter. The ZLP may spread on its way through the YAG
scintillator and the fiber optics before hitting the PDA or
CCD. Figure 37.9A shows the PSF of a PEELS and
clearly there is intensity well outside a single channel,
although a CCD offers considerably better PSF perfor-
mance than the PDA. The PSF broadens features in your
spectrum such as ionization edges, but you need to
remove its effect by deconvolution (see Section 39.6)
thus restoring the resolution of the spectrum to that
inherent in the beam, in the same way we described for
X-ray spectra in Section 34.4, except that the commercial
software is available and it makes sense to deconvolute
the PSF from any spectrum that you gather. The concept
is essentially the same as the point-spread function we
</p>
<p>THE PRICE
While TEM-imagemodemight be good for gathering
spectra with a large b and high-energy resolution, the
price you pay is much poorer spatial resolution, so we
don&rsquo;t recommend it.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>discussed for HRTEM. Figure 37.9B and C demon-
strates that such energy deconvolution can produce a
significant sharpening of the spectrum and, just as in
XEDS, there is no reason not to run a ZLP deconvolu-
tion routinely to get the best resolution in your spectrum,
so long as you are confident (e.g., by testing the software
on spectra from known specimens (see Section 39.6)) that
such processing does not introduce its own artifacts;
which is a good segue into the next section.
</p>
<p>37.5.B PEELS Artifacts
</p>
<p>Almost all the artifacts in a PEELS system are a conse-
quence of the PDA, which is why CCD detectors have
been introduced. If you have a PDA system, then the
individual diodes will differ slightly in their response to
the incident electron beam and therefore, there will be a
channel-to-channel gain variation in intensity. If you
spread the beam uniformly over the array using at least
the 3 mm aperture and looking at the diode readouts, you
can see any variation, as shown in Figure 37.10.You have
to divide your experimental spectrum by this response
spectrum to remove any gain variation. Alternatively,
and this is recommended, you can gather two spectra
with slight energy shifts (�1&ndash;2 eV) or spatial shifts between
them and superimpose them electronically. Using a 2-D
CCD array, as in the GIF, also removes this problem.
</p>
<p>If you gather many spectra and superimpose them to
avoid saturation of the PDA, you&rsquo;ll generate readout
noise. Random readout noise or shot noise from the
electronics chain is minimized by taking fewer readouts,
and by thermoelectric cooling of the PDA. Individual
diodes may fail and give high leakage currents which
appear as spikes in the spectrum. The fixed-pattern
noise is a function of the three-phase readout circuitry.
All these effects will appear when there is no current
falling on the diodes and together they constitute the
dark current (see Figure 37.11). The dark current is

<p>small unless you have a bad diode and it is only a
problem when there are very few counts in your spec-
trum or you have added together multiple (e.g., 10 or
more) spectra. A CCD detector has a higher dark cur-
rent than a cooled PDA. Figure 37.12 shows some of
these effects and how to remove them.
</p>
<p>When the diodes are cooled, only �95% of the signal
is read out in the first integration, �4.5% on the second,
�0.25% on the third, and so on. This incomplete readout
can introduce an artifact if you saturated the diodes with
an intense signal like the ZLP. This residual peak then
shows up as a ghost peak in the next readout and decays
slowly over several readouts. So, if a ghost peak appears,
just run several readouts and it will disappear; this way
you&rsquo;ll never confuse a ghost with a genuine ionization
edge or other spectral feature. You can also get a ghost
peak on aCCDdetector if you overexpose the scintillator.
</p>
<p>Increasing the keVmeansmore electrons are generated
in the scintillator and the sensitivity should be linearly
related to the electron energy. If you&rsquo;re doing quantitative
analysis, check that the YAG responds linearly to differ-
ent intensities by comparing the zero-loss intensity mea-
sured in a single 1 s readout with that recorded say in
40 readouts each of 0.025 s. In each case, subtract the
dark current. Obviously the ratio of these two intensities
should be unity, for all levels of signal falling on the YAG.
If you&rsquo;re more intent on low-loss spectrometry or fine-
structure studies, this non-linearity is not important.
</p>
<p>We can summarize the PDA artifacts and how we
eliminate them in Table 37.1.
</p>
<p>37.6 IMAGING FILTERS
</p>
<p>Energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) is sometimes termed
energy-filtered imaging (EFI) or electron-spectroscopic
imaging (ESI) and is perhaps the most powerful AEM
technique, as will become apparent. To perform
EFTEM, you basically select (or filter out) electrons of
a specific energy coming through the spectrometer and
form either an image or a DP. Doing EFTEM is per-
fectly acceptable in TEM image mode (unlike spectro-
scopy) so long as you keep the energy slit small to
minimize chromatic aberration and, to select the

<p>electrons with a specific energy, you change the gun
voltage slightly such that those electrons come on-axis
and you don&rsquo;t need to keep re-focusing the objective
lens.
</p>
<p>At the start of the chapter, we noted that there are
two types of energy filters: the in-column (O) filter and
the post-column GIF and both produce EFTEM
images. In-column filters are placed in the heart of
the TEM imaging system, between the intermediate
and projector lenses such that the recording CCD
detector only receives electrons that have come
through the filter. So all images/DPs consist of elec-
trons of a specific selected energy. (You can, of course,
turn off the filter and use the microscope like a normal
TEM, but since there are so many advantages to filtered
imaging, your reasons for doing this would be ques-
tioned.) You can also record a spectrum as we&rsquo;ll show,
but the in-column filters are primarily imaging tools and
it is both feasible and desirable to operate all the time in
filtered mode.
</p>
<p>The post-column GIF is added below the TEM
viewing screen, just like a PEELS and therefore you
can choose to use it or not. The GIF can be seen as
either a more flexible instrument or one that limits you
to having to decide whether or not to filter your
images. Such differences, while perhaps pedantic,
have been known to lead to fights in bars at M&amp;M
conferences. The best solution, of course, is to have one
of each type of filter in your laboratory, but this takes
some of the fun out of going to bars at M&amp;M. Let&rsquo;s
examine each type of filter in more detail.
</p>
<p>37.6.A The Omega Filter
</p>
<p>Zeiss first used a mirror-prism system originally devised
by Castaing and Henry in 1962. The drawback to the
mirror-prism is the need to split the high-voltage supply
and raise the mirror to the same voltage as the gun. So
Zeiss now uses a magnetic O filter, as does JEOL, cur-
rently the only other TEM manufacturer with an in-
column filter. The filter is placed in the TEM column
between the intermediate and projector lenses and con-
sists of a set of magnetic prisms arranged in an O shape
which disperses the electrons off axis, as shown in Figure
</p>
<p>37.13A but, in the end, brings them back onto the optic
axis before entering the final projector lens. Although it
is not shown, each of the four prisms is machined with
curved faces (like Figure 37.2B) to reduce aberrations.
There isn&rsquo;t much to see externally on the TEM except an
asymmetry on the side of the (somewhat taller) column,
which you can also see if you go back and look at the
picture of the Zeiss UHRTEM in Figure 1.9.
</p>
<p>The multiple steps necessary for ETEM imaging via
an in-column filter are shown in Figure 37.13B. As
shown in this figure, we usually project an image into
the prism which is focused on a DP in the back-focal
plane of the intermediate lens (i.e., image mode in our
terminology). Therefore, the entrance aperture to the
spectrometer selects an area of the specimen and b is
governed by the objective aperture. Electrons follow-
ing a particular path through the spectrometer (the red
ones in Figure 37.13B) can be selected by the post-
spectrometer slit. Thus, only electrons of a given
energy range, determined by the slit width, are used
to form the image projected onto the TEM CCD.
EFTEM has several advantages over conventional
TEM images; there&rsquo;s much more about EFTEM in
the companion text.
</p>
<p>If you change the focus of the projector lens onto
the dispersion plane of the filter (where the energy-
selecting slit is located in Figure 37.13B) and then
remove this slit, you&rsquo;ll see a spectrum on the viewing
screen/CCD. The spectrum appears as a line of varying
intensity (see Figure 37.14A), which you can imagine
as looking down from above on a traditional spectrum
display such as Figure 37.1. Since the spectrum is
recorded digitally on the CCD, it is simple to select a
line through this spectrum and have the computer dis-
play a traditional spectrum of counts versus energy
loss, as shown in Figure 37.14B.
</p>
<p>As with PEELS, you can also change the TEM
optics and project a DP into the prism, thus producing
an energy-filtered DP on the CCD, as we&rsquo;ve already
described back in Chapter 20. If you then use the slit
to select a portion of the DP, you get an energy-loss
spectrum showing not only the intensity distribution as
a function of energy but also the angular distribution of
the electrons. Such angular (or momentum)-resolved

<p>EELS is a whole separate field of study which we&rsquo;ll
discuss in Section 40.8.
</p>
<p>37.6.B The GIF
</p>
<p>The GIF is a Gatan PEELS with an energy-selecting
slit after the magnet and a 2D slow-scan CCD detec-
tor, rather than a 1D PDA, as the detector. Figure
37.15A shows a schematic diagram of a GIF interfaced
to a TEM and Figure 37.15B shows an exploded view of
a GIF (which shows the internal parts of the spectrom-
eter shown back in Figure 37.3). Compared to a
standard spectrometer, there are many more quadru-
poles and sextupoles in the optics of the GIF. The dis-
persion of the spectrometer onto the slit has to be
magnified and the quadrupoles after the slit have two
functions. Either we project an image of the spectrum in
the plane of the selecting slit onto the CCD or we
compensate for the energy dispersion of the magnet
and project a magnified image of the specimen onto
the CCD. In the first mode, the system is operating like
a standard PEELS; in the second, it produces images
(or DPs) containing electrons of a specific energy
selected by the slit. While the spectrometer is double
focusing as we saw, the aberration correction is good
only for a single plane so astigmatism is introduced and
this has to be corrected by a further combination of
sextupoles and octupoles. Obviously, such a large num-
ber of variable sextupoles and quadrupoles could be a
nightmare to operate without appropriate computer
control and this is built into the system software. One
potential operational difficulty is that the magnifica-
tion of the GIF system is such that the actual TEM
screen magnification needs to be rather small in order
to observe a filtered image with reasonable magnifica-
tion. More recent AEMs satisfactorily compensate for
this magnification differential, but others do not and

<p>then you have to move between TEM and GIF images
and it is not so easy to operate in filtered mode all the
time, which would be preferred.
</p>
<p>37.7 MONOCHROMATORS
</p>
<p>Energy resolution is obviously a key factor in EELS,
much more so in fact than in XEDS where we still live
with the miserable resolution of the solid-state detector.
Resolution of a few eV is more than sufficient for
</p>
<p>ionization-loss spectrometry, but as we use EELS more
to study such aspects as vibrational modes of atoms,
inter/intra band excitations, fine structure, and electronic
effects, sub-eV resolution is increasingly of interest. For
example, Batson at IBM has pioneered high-resolution
(HREELS) in a decades-long research project probing
ever deeper into the electronic structure of Si and the Si/
SiO2 interface and other materials essential for modern
electronics.
</p>
<p>If your spectrometer is not a limiting factor, then the
gun dictates the ultimate energy resolution. Thermionic
sources with �3 eV (W) and 1.5 eV (LaB6) resolution,
respectively, might be tolerable for ionization-loss
spectrometry and basic low-energy plasmon studies.
However, EELS really requires that you have a FEG.
Either a cold FEG or a Schottky will give you sub-eV
resolution, but this is still not sufficient in some cases. So
commercial monochromators have become available
which offer resolutions �100 meV although at very low
energy losses (&lt;50eV) it is even possible to get resolutions
of �25 meV. Basically, a monochromator is an EELS
system fitted on theFEGsource and the selecting slit refines
the already narrow energy spread still further giving
remarkably fine detail in the spectra. The monochromator
is usually aWien filter which has perpendicular electrostatic
and magnetic fields which permit the chosen electrons to
travel in a straight line down the TEM column. (Again, if
youwant to learnmore, go back toMetherell&rsquo;s early review
which has it all.) Figure 37.16A shows the ZLP at 200 keV
obtained with and without a monochromator showing the
reduction in FWHM. From Figure 37.16A, you can see
that the FWHM of a commercial monochromated ZLP is
much better than the 600 meV you can get with a Schottky
gun and a little better than the � 300 meV delivered by a
good cold FEG. The intensity of the beam tail is relatively
low in comparison with that of a standard cold FEG. This
low-intensity tail results in real improvements for low-loss
spectrometry, as we&rsquo;ll see in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>Figure 37.16B compares the quality of different spectra
oftheCoL2,3edgesobtainedonavarietyof instrumentsand
calculated (seeChapter 40and the companion text formore
detailson thecalculation).Clearly thedegreeof finedetail in
the spectra improves as the energy range of the electron
sources gets smaller. The monochromated FEG is similar
in quality to the spectrum from the synchrotron source, if a
little noisier. The degree of agreement between these latter
two spectra and the calculated spectrum is encouraging.
</p>
<p>The drawback tomonochromation, of course, is that,
in filtering out the tails of the Gaussian energy distribu-
tion to reduce the FWHM, we reduce the number of
electrons significantly. So having spent serious dollars
to get the brightest possible electron source for our
AEM, we immediately throw away a large amount of
it in pursuit of the best energy resolution. This compro-
mise is a real limiting factor and you should rarely con-
template acquiring an AEM with a monochromator.

<p>The one thing that you get in EELS is lots of elec-
trons, particularly in the low-loss spectrum. In this case,
monochromation is truly an advantage. Of course, it
</p>
<p>would also help if we could develop even brighter sources
than cold FEGs.
</p>
<p>There are also software alternatives to physicalmono-
chromation of the source and by various deconvolution
routines it is possible to obtain spectra with a resolution
of about 200 meV (e.g., the papers by Kimoto et al. and
Gloter et al.). This approach is a very acceptable alter-
native to using a monochromator, unless you need the
absolute best resolution for exploring the finest details of
the electronic structure of nanomaterials (e.g., papers by
Kimoto et al. in 2005, and Spence in 2006)when you need
to lower both the keV and the beam current to produce
sub-100 meV resolution.
</p>
<p>37.8 USING YOUR SPECTROMETER AND
FILTER
</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got a thin specimen in your microscope
(you&rsquo;ll see later that for most EELS experiments, very
thin is much better than merely thin) and you want to
start acquiring spectra and filtered images. There are
several ways to do this and basically they parallel what
we&rsquo;ve already described for XEDS
</p>
<p>1. Point analyses: stop the STEM probe from scanning
and position it on a selected point in the image over
the entrance aperture and record a spectrum (see
Figure 37.17A). This was the standard modus oper-
andi for decades, but is (a) biased (because you pick
what you think ought to be analyzed), (b) statistically
poor (only one pixel selected out of a million or so in
a typical STEM image), and (c) prone to damaging/
contaminating the chosen area of interest by leaving
the intense probe on the same point for long periods
of time. So don&rsquo;t do point analyses, unless you&rsquo;re just
looking quickly around the specimen to see what you
can find. If you do, don&rsquo;t necessarily believe that
what you find is significant!
</p>
<p>2. Line analyses: take a series of spectra along a line that
traverses some feature of interest (such as a planar
interface or defect such as a grain boundary). This
process is still biased by your choice of line but at
least has the advantage of focusing on something that
should provide useful information about the spec-
imen. You can either plot the information from the
spectra (e.g., the composition or the dielectric
constant or whatever data you extract) or you can
display the data as a spectrum-line, as shown in
Figure 37.17B which shows changes in chemistry
across a nanotube.
</p>
<p>3. TEM filtered images: using a GIF orO filter, gather a
filtered image or DP by using the slit to select elec-
trons of a specific energy thus allowing only those
electrons to fall on the viewing screen or CCD. If you
use this method to filter out all the energy-loss elec-
trons and produce a ZLP image, you can

<p>monochromator, a synchrotron (X-ray absorption spectrum), and a cal-
</p>
<p>culated spectrum using crystal-field theory. The improvement in resolu-
</p>
<p>tion with monochromation is apparent.
</p>

IfHREELS is the raison d&rsquo;etreof the instrument remem-
ber that just about all other TEM/AEM operations will
be degraded if you switch on the monochromator.

<p>substantially enhance the quality of CBED patterns,
as shown in Figure 37.17C (and also back in Figure
20.10). Also, as we&rsquo;ll see at various times, EFTEM
improves mass-thickness contrast, phase contrast,
and diffraction contrast. So why wouldn&rsquo;t you use
this technique if you have a filter on your AEM?
</p>
<p>4. STEM filtered images: scan the beam over an area of
interest using the slit to select electrons of a specific
energy thus allowing only those electrons to fall on
the viewing screen or CCD. If you select electrons of
a specific energy then you can produce composition
maps (Figure 37.17D) similar to many of the XEDS
composition maps we have already shown.
</p>
<p>5. Spectrum-images: store a full spectrum at each pixel
(obviously, you need to be operating in STEM to do
this). It&rsquo;s much easier to do this in STEM because if
you try and do this in TEM mode, you&rsquo;ll have to
record hundreds of images at different selected ener-
gies and comparing complete images is challenging
and time consuming, so not everyone does this; how-
ever, this situation is changing. In a similar manner to
</p>
<p>what we showed you for XEDS, after you&rsquo;ve acquired
a full spectrum image, you can go into the data cube
and select whatever information you want. For exam-
ple, you can view images at specific energies or spectra
from specific points or lines in your specimen, thus
removing the bias that affects your choice of spot or
line analyses. EELS spectrum imagingwasmore easily
implemented than the XEDS version because of the
ease of acquiring large numbers of counts and the
broad array of possible images was demonstrated by
Hunt and Williams.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use examples of these various methods through-
out the next three chapters. Generally speaking, as we&rsquo;ve
emphasized for X-rays, it makes sense for you to form
images of specific features in the spectrum rather than
gather spectra from specific points, so that they can at
least be compared with your TEM images. Since counts
are not a problem in EELS (unlike for XEDS) imaging is
relatively straightforward and fast. If you really want to
optimize your information then acquire spectrum images.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
We use a magnetic-prism spectrometer for PEELS and a combination of one or more
prisms plus imaging lenses for GIF/EFTEM. The prism is a simple device and very
sensitive but you have to understand how it functions in combination with different
TEM modes, You can operate with your TEM in imaging or diffraction (STEM) mode,
or use a DSTEM. You have to know how the software focuses and calibrates the system
and how it determines the collection angle, b. Once you can understand this you&rsquo;re in a
position to acquire and analyze EEL spectra. So in the next chapter we&rsquo;ll tell you what
these spectra look like and what information they contain. If you have an O filter or GIF
you can routinely form images or DPs with electrons of specific E and it makes sense, if
you can, to view all your images and DPs in filtered mode for reasons we&rsquo;ve already
mentioned in past chapters and that we&rsquo;ll reiterate in the subsequent chapters. Energy
filtering is a rapidly evolving field and systems with reduced aberrations and better energy
resolution such as the Mandoline filter on Zeiss&rsquo;s Sub-eV-Sub-Ångstrom Microscope
(SESAMe) and Nion&rsquo;s UltraSTEM will offer far more exciting breakthroughs than we
can describe here and Egerton gave a brief synopsis of a range of hardware and software
advances in 2003.

<p>Low-Loss and No-Loss Spectra
and Images
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;energy loss&rsquo; implies that we are interested only in inelastic interactions, but the
spectrum will also contain electrons which have not lost any discernible energy, so we need
to consider elastic scattering as well. In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll focus on the low-energy portion of
the EEL spectrum which comprises
</p>
<p>&amp; The zero-loss peak, which primarily contains elastic, forward-scattered electrons, but
also includes electrons that have suffered small energy losses. Forming images and DPs
with the zero-loss electrons offers tremendous advantages over unfiltered images, partic-
ularly from thicker specimens.
</p>
<p>&amp; The low-loss region up to an (arbitrary) energy loss of � 50 eV contains electrons which
have interacted with the weakly bound, outer-shell electrons of the atoms. Thus, this part
of the spectrum reflects the dielectric response of the specimen to high-energy electrons.
We can also form images from these low-loss electrons that reveal information about the
electronic structure and other characteristics of the specimen.
</p>
<p>The energy-loss spectrum is more useful than an X-ray spectrum which only contains
elemental information. However, this kind of spectrum is also far more complex. To under-
stand its content you need a greater understanding of the physics of beam-specimen interac-
tions, so we&rsquo;ll give you some hints about where to get the necessary education.
</p>
<p>38.1 A FEW BASIC CONCEPTS
</p>
<p>Back in Chapters 2&ndash;4, we described the difference
between elastic and inelastic beam-specimen interac-
tions and introduced the ideas of scattering cross sec-
tions and the associated mean free path. Remember,
the cross section is a measure of the probability of a
specific scattering event occurring and the mean free
path is the average distance between particular inter-
actions. It might be a good idea to re-read about those
ideas before starting on this chapter. Briefly, you
should recall that elastic scattering is an electron-
nucleus interaction; the word elastic implies that
there is no energy loss, although a change in direction,
and hence in momentum, usually occurs. Elastic scat-
tering occurs mainly as Bragg diffraction in crystalline
specimens. Inelastic scattering is primarily an elec-
tron-electron interaction and entails both a loss of
energy and a change of momentum.
</p>
<p>We have to be concerned with both the amount of
energy lost and the direction of the electrons after
they&rsquo;ve come through the specimen.
</p>
<p>This latter point is one reason why the collection
angle of the spectrometer, b, is so important.
</p>
<p>Also you must remember to distinguish between the
definitions of scattering that will keep appearing.
</p>
<p>&amp; Single scattering occurs when each electron under-
goes at most one scattering event as it traverses the
specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; Plural (&gt;1 and &lt; 20) scattering implies that the
electron has undergone a combination of inter-
actions and lost energy from some or all of
them.
</p>
<p>&amp; Multiple (&gt; 20) scattering only occurs in very thick
specimens or with very low energy electrons, so is
irrelevant to TEM.
</p>
<p>38 .1 A FEW BAS IC CONCEPTS ................................................................................................................................................................. 699</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see that the energy-loss spectrum is most
understandable and more easily modeled when we can
approximate everything to single scattering. This ideal is
approached when we have a combination of very thin
specimens and high accelerating voltages. In practice,
most specimens are thicker than ideal and so we usually
acquire plural-scattering spectra and we may have to
remove the plural-scattering effects via deconvolution
routines which are available in commercial and free
EELS software packages (see URLs #1&ndash;3). We&rsquo;ll
address the general topic of spectral simulation and
manipulation later and in more depth in the companion
text. We&rsquo;ve already told you about deconvoluting out
the PSF in Chapter 37, we&rsquo;ll see in Section 38.2.B, that
you can do similar things if you want to remove the
ZLP, and removing plural-scattering effects in high-loss
spectra will be discussed in Section 39.6.
</p>
<p>Typical energy losses: The principal inelastic interac-
tions in order of increasing energy are phonon excitations,
interband and intraband transitions, plasmon excitations,
and inner-shell ionizations. We&rsquo;ve already introduced
these processes back in Chapter 4. The energy loss E of
the principal scattering processes that we study in EELS
are single-electron scattering (inter/intraband transitions),
2&ndash;20 eV, plasmon interactions 5&ndash;30 eV, and inner-shell
ionizations, 50&ndash;2000 eV. Phonon excitations cause losses
of � 0.02 eV so, even with the best energy resolution in
monochromatedAEMs, it&rsquo;s not possible to separate these
from the ZLP, although the phonon-scattering angle can
be quite large and (particularly for heavier elements) these
electrons can be seen as the background intensity between
the principal spots in an SADpattern. But that&rsquo;s about all
we&rsquo;ll say about phonon scattering, except that you should
be able to work out why cooling your specimen will help
to reduce their presence. We&rsquo;ll deal with the first three
(low-loss) processes in this chapter and the ionization
(high-loss) process in the next chapter. There are also
ionization events with energy losses &gt;2 keV but it is
difficult to detect these because the signal is relatively
weak and, at such energies, the X-ray signal is strong, so
we tend not to do much EELS &gt; 2 keV.
</p>
<p>Typical scattering angles: It&rsquo;s a little difficult to be
specific about the values of scattering angle, y, because
the angle varies with beam energy and the energy-loss
process. We always assume that the scattering is sym-
metrical around the direct beam and there are two
principal scattering angles that you should know.
You can find derivations of the equations in Egerton&rsquo;s
text.

<p>If the beam energy is in eV the angle is in radians. This
equation is an approximation (good to about �10%)
and it ignores relativistic effects and doesn&rsquo;t work for
phonons, so you should only use it for rough calcula-
tions and be particularly suspicious above �100 keV.

Knowing the characteristic scattering angle is obviously
important if you want to gather an intense spectrum
highlighting a particular energy loss. For example, a
plasmon interaction with 100-keV electrons, causing
a typical energy loss of 20 eV will have a characteristic
scattering angle of �0.1 mrads. Using a smaller b will
cut off intensity in the spectrum which is why we
told you in the last chapter to ensure that b &gt;2&ndash;3yE.
Knowing the cut-off angle (which is typically an order
of magnitude greater than the characteristic angle
at 100 keV) will give you a maximum useful value of b.
If you use too large a value of b then there&rsquo;s the chance
that you&rsquo;ll get unwanted electrons in the spectrum

<p>(e.g., diffracted beams) but you&rsquo;ve got to try really hard
to encounter this problem.
</p>
<p>38.2 THE ZERO-LOSS PEAK (ZLP)
</p>
<p>38.2.A Why the ZLP Really Isn&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>If your specimen is thin enough for EELS, the predomi-
nant feature in the spectrum will be the ZLP, as shown
in Figure 38.1. As the name implies, the ZLP consists
primarily of electrons that have retained the incident-
beam energy E0. Such electrons may be forward scat-
tered in a relatively narrow cone within a few mrads of
the optic axis and constitute the 000 spot in the DP, i.e.,
the direct beam. If youwere to tilt the incident beam so a
diffracted beam entered the spectrometer then it, too,
would give a ZLP.
</p>
<p>Actually, we can also measure the intensity and
energy of electrons as a function of their angular dis-
tribution, and we&rsquo;ll discuss angular- or momentum-
resolved EELS later, in Section 40.8.
</p>
<p>Now the term ZLP is really a misnomer for two
reasons. First, as we&rsquo;ve seen, the spectrometer has a
finite energy resolution (at best� 0.3 eV without mono-
chromation) so the ZLP will also contain electrons that
</p>
<p>have energy losses below the resolution limit, which are
mainly those that excited phonons. This is not a great
loss since phonon-scattered electrons don&rsquo;t carry useful
information; they only cause the specimen to heat up.
However, it does explain why we shouldn&rsquo;t really call
this the ZLP. Second, we can&rsquo;t produce a monochro-
matic (single-color, i.e., single-wavelength/energy)
beam of electrons; the beam has a finite energy range
about the nominal value E0 (at best 10&ndash;100 meV even
with a monochromator). Despite this imprecision, we
will continue to use the term zero loss.
</p>
<p>From a spectroscopist&rsquo;s point of view, the ZLP is
more of a problem than a useful feature in the spectrum
because, as wementioned in the previous chapter, it is so
intense that it can saturate the PDA or the CCD detec-
tor, creating a ghost peak. So if you don&rsquo;t need to collect
the ZLP in the spectrum then deflect it off the detector
(or use the attenuator in the Gatan system). Conversely,
from the microscopist&rsquo;s standpoint, as we&rsquo;ll see, select-
ing the ZLP to form an image or DP fromwhichmost of
the energy-loss electrons have been excluded is a very
useful technique. Conversely (again) filtering out the
ZLP and forming images with selected energy-loss elec-
trons is also extraordinarily useful.
</p>
<p>38.2.B Removing the Tail of the ZLP
</p>
<p>The intense ZLP has a tail, either side of it (go back and
look at Figure 37.4), ultimately limited by the energy
resolution. On the low (negative) energy side of the
peak, the point-spread function accounts for the tailing,
but on the high (positive) energy side there are contribu-
tions from the low-loss (e.g., phonon) electrons we just
discussed. It is sometimes necessary to remove this tail
before studying the (very) low-loss spectrum, e.g., for
dielectric-constant determination (see Section 38.3).
There are various ways to remove this tail in Gatan&rsquo;s
commercial software (e.g., comparison with reference
spectra, subtraction versus deconvolution) and the soft-
ware continues to improve. Youmust make sure you are
displaying the spectrum with a high dispersion and
deconvolute the point-spread function before doing
anything else.
</p>
<p>The best way to remove the tail, if you really need to
study the spectrum close to the ZLP, is to use a mono-
chromator and cut off the tail of the peak at the source,
so that any intensity outside the ZLP is a true low-loss
part of the spectrum. In this particular case, since the
low-loss spectrum is relatively intense, the principal
argument against monochromation (i.e., you throw
away a lot of expensive electrons) is seriously weakened.
We&rsquo;ve alreadymentioned this in Section 37.7 and Figure
37.16 compares the energy spread in the ZLP before and
after monochromation.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a monochromator, removal of the
ZLP peak is challenging and prone to artifacts. The
</p>
<p>FIGURE 38.1. The low-loss spectrum showing an intense ZLP. The next
</p>
<p>most intense peak is a plasmon peak and the rest of the spectrum out to
</p>
<p>the high-loss (&gt; 50 eV) region is relatively low intensity.
</p>
<p>MAGNITUDE OF ANGLES
The scattering angles for diffraction (2yB) are rela-
tively large (�20 mrad) compared to the smaller
scattering angles in EELS. So the diffracted beams
will only enter the spectrometer if you select them.
</p>
<p>38 .2 THE ZERO -LOSS PEAK (ZLP) ........................................................................................................................................................ 701</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>main problem is that the shape of the ZLP measured
with the beam on the specimen is not always the same as
the ZLP measured in the hole because of phonons and
elastic-scattering effects.
</p>
<p>38.2.C Zero-Loss Images and Diffraction
Patterns
</p>
<p>If we filter out all the electrons which have lost energy
greater than the resolution of the spectrometer (typically
&gt;�1 eV) then basicallywe have an elastic image orDP. In
doing this we immediately remove chromatic-aberration
effects from the image, since it is the imprecise focusing of
energy-loss electrons that degrades the resolution of TEM
images from thick specimens. You should go back and
take a look at Section 6.5.B and equation 6.16 and you&rsquo;ll
see that, ifmany electrons suffer a typical (e.g., plasmon)E
of �15 eV, your image resolution degrades from a few Å
to several nanometers. For such E to occur, the specimen
thickness has to be a goodly fraction of the plasmonmean
free path (see Table 38.1), but that is not unusual. In
addition to degrading the resolution by adding a diffuse
component to otherwise focusedTEM images, the energy-
loss electrons also account for the diffuse intensity
between spots in DPs. So filtering out these electrons
should both increase the image contrast and improve the
quality of the DPs.
</p>
<p>The positive effect of energy filtering on resolution
and all forms of TEM-image contrast has been known
for several decades (see Egerton&rsquo;s early papers). This
technique is particularly useful for enhancing the qual-
ity of images from thick biological (or polymeric) speci-
mens in which the inelastic scattering is stronger than
the elastic scattering (see Figure 38.2). However, diffrac-
tion contrast can also be enhanced by filtering of images
from thick specimens (see Figure 38.3) but also in thin
specimens because inelastically scattered electrons
broaden the excitation error, s, thus reducing diffraction
contrast. Sometimes enhancement of mass-thickness
contrast images can be achieved by &lsquo;tuning&rsquo; the spectrom-
eter to select a specific range of energies (Figure 38.4).
Contrast tuning (see Egerton&rsquo;s text) involves selecting
an energy-loss window and sliding it around the spec-
trum while watching the image to find the best contrast.
Tuning is useful in both the low and high-loss regions of

<p>the spectrum and is typically done anywhere from 0 to
200 eV. As shown in Figure 38.4, there is significant
possibility for contrast improvement in the low-loss
region. In the high-loss region, selecting an energy win-
dow before an edge tends to reduce contrast from the
edge electrons while windows after an edge tend to
enhance contrast from the edge (see also jump-ratio
imaging in Section 39.9).
</p>
<p>High-resolution phase-contrast images (from thin
specimens) should be more easily compared with theory
if they are filtered to remove the diffuse background
because we won&rsquo;t need so many &lsquo;fudge factors.&rsquo; (See
Chapter 28.) For a given thickness of specimen, the
only alternative to reducing chromatic aberration is to
go to higher voltages and this is perhaps an even more
expensive option than buying a filter!
</p>
<p>As we discussed back in Sections 37.8 and 20.5, if the
energy-loss electrons are removed from SADPs and
CBDPs it makes them much clearer (e.g., the paper by
Midgley et al. and Reimer&rsquo;s chapter in Ahn&rsquo;s text), as
shown back in Figures 20.10 and 37.17C. Energy filter-
ing can also reveal extra diffraction information, such as
the radial-distribution function for amorphous materi-
als, which we&rsquo;ll tell you about later in Section 40.7.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a thick (several tens of nm) specimen
(which is sometimes all you can manage to create),
filtering may give many improvements
</p>
<p>&amp; Filtering can improve the image resolution.
&amp; Filtering can enhance the image contrast no matter
what mechanism is operating.
</p>
<p>&amp; Filtering can improve the contrast in diffraction
patterns.
</p>
<p>&amp; Filtering can reveal finer detail in images and DPs.
</p>
<p>So it would be really great if we could leave the filter
switched on all the time, but this isn&rsquo;t always practically
feasible.
</p>
<p>Perhaps what is more surprising is why, given the
tremendous advantage of filtering, simple zero-loss fil-
ters haven&rsquo;t been commercially available for decades?
One experimental problem is that the energy-loss spec-
trometer is susceptible to external fields and the ZLP
shifts over time, making continuous EFTEM imaging
difficult: you have to continually re-align and re-focus
the ZLP. Also, the best results, particularly for quanti-
tative imaging (see the next chapter), require that your
specimen has a similar thickness over the entire area of
the image and that strong diffraction effects are mini-
mized. Another possible reason is that filtering works
best for thick specimens, which don&rsquo;t permit the TEM to
perform at its (spherical-aberration) resolution limit of
a fraction of a nanometer. It is perhaps not advanta-
geous to remind users that most of their specimens are
such that their TEM can&rsquo;t deliver anything like its best
resolution, and that buying a &lsquo;better&rsquo; TEM will have no
beneficial effect on image quality or resolution for the
great majority of (thick) specimens. But of course, this is
only speculation. . .!
</p>
<p>38.3 THE LOW-LOSS SPECTRUM
</p>
<p>Look again at Figure 38.1, which is a typical low-loss
spectrum and several points are immediately obvious
</p>
<p>&amp; After the ZLP, the plasmon peak is the next major
peak.
</p>
<p>&amp; Apart from the plasmon, the spectrum is relatively
featureless (the intensity changes are small).
</p>
<p>&amp; Despite the lack of features, there&rsquo;s still a lot of
counts (check the units of the ordinate), so extracting
useful data is still feasible and imaging should be
relatively straightforward.
</p>
<p>The cut-off energy for the low-loss spectrum, as
we&rsquo;ve already noted, is � 50 eV and the reason for this
is that the other principal features of energy-loss spec-
tra, namely, the ionization edges, don&rsquo;t appear (at least
for solids) until E&gt; 50 eV. In the low-loss spectrum, we

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>are detecting beam electrons that have interacted with
conduction and/or valence bands (hence another com-
mon term for the low-loss spectrum is &lsquo;valence spec-
trum&rsquo;). These weakly bound electrons control many
electronic properties of the specimen. In general, the
low-loss spectrum is not as well understood as the
high-loss spectrum and there has not been the same
effort put into modeling low-loss spectra, as we&rsquo;ll
describe for the higher-loss spectra in Chapters 39 and
40. However, things are beginning to change, as you&rsquo;ll
see later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>While we have just shown you the tremendous
advantages of filtering out the plasmon peak in order
to enhance contrast and resolution in TEM images and
DPs, there is also much to be gained by imaging the
plasmon peak and filtering out the ZLP and high-loss
electrons. This approach was pioneered by Batson.
Because of the strength of the signal, plasmon imaging
is becoming a much more popular technique, particu-
larly for mapping out low-loss properties of nanomater-
ials (e.g., see the papers by Eggeman et al. and by Ding
and Wang).
</p>
<p>38.3.A Chemical Fingerprinting
</p>
<p>So what can we do with the low-loss spectrum? Because
there are a lot of counts, we can use the shape of the
spectrum to help identify specific phases or features in
the TEM image with some degree of statistical certainty.
The low-loss spectrum all the way up to�50 eV, includ-
ing any plasmon peaks (see Section 38.3.C), should be
used for fingerprinting.
</p>
<p>So you overlay your unknown spectrum on one or
more stored library-standard spectra. Figure 38.5 shows
how low-loss spectra vary (A) for aluminum and various
compounds and (B) for the main constituents of biolog-
ical specimens. A collection of low-loss spectra from
many elements and common compounds (mainly
oxides) has been compiled in various databases, such as
the EELS Atlas or on the Web at URL #4. Such sources
can help considerably with fingerprinting unknown
features in your image. As with any fingerprinting tech-
nique, including the forensic variety, you must be careful
to decide when a &lsquo;match&rsquo; is satisfactory. There is no
&lsquo;black and white&rsquo; here, only shades of gray, so don&rsquo;t
convict unless the statistics are with you and there is
strong supporting evidence from other techniques.
</p>
<p>FINGERPRINTING
The low-loss spectrum can only be used for phase
identification through a &lsquo;fingerprinting&rsquo; process.
You store the spectra of known specimens in a library
in the computer.

<p>38.3.B Dielectric-Constant Determination
</p>
<p>We can view the energy-loss process as the dielectric
response of the specimen to the passage of a fast elec-
tron. As a result, the very low energy spectrum (up to E
� 20 eV) contains information about the dielectric con-
stant or permittivity (e). Localized dielectric-constant
measurements are of great interest as the semiconductor
industry explores high-dielectric materials, such as
HfO2, for the next generation of nanometer-scale gate
oxides.
</p>
<p>Assuming a free-electron model, the single-scatter-
ing spectrum intensity I(E) is related to the imaginary
(Im) part of the dielectric constant e by the expression
(modified from Egerton)

</p>
<p>(38:5)
</p>
<p>where I0 is the intensity in the ZLP, t is the specimen
thickness, k is a constant incorporating the electron
momentum and the Bohr radius, b is the collection
angle (again note its importance), and yE is the charac-
teristic-scattering angle. You can use a Kramers-Kronig
analysis to analyze the energy spectrum in order to
extract the real part of the dielectric constant from the
imaginary part in equation 38.5 and details are given in
Egerton&rsquo;s text. As usual, the advantage to doing this
kind of measurement in the TEM is the high spatial
resolution and the advantages of this are exemplified
by the use of low-loss spectroscopy to determine optical
gaps on BN nanotubes (Arenal et al.). Since you need a
single-scattering spectrum, removing the plural scatter-
ing intensity by Fourier-logarithmic deconvolution is
the first step (see Section 39.6) when determining the
dielectric constant. The Gatan software package has the
appropriate programs and public-domain software is
also available, e.g., URLs #1, 5, and 6.
</p>
<p>The alternatives to EELS for this kind of work are
various kinds of optical and other electromagnetic-
radiation techniques. The part of the low-loss spectrum
from� 1.5 to 3 eV is of great interest and corresponds to
optical analysis of the dielectric response from the infra-
red (�800 nm) through the ultra-violet (� 400 nm)
wavelength range. (This correspondence between
EELS and optical spectroscopy only holds for small
angles of scattering so the value of b you choose must
be small (&lt; � 10 mrads) thus lowering the intensity in
</p>
<p>the spectrum.) Higher energies correspond to various
electronic transitions. Thus, in a single EELS experi-
ment you can, in theory, substitute for a whole battery
of optical-spectroscopy instrumentation (although opti-
cal spectroscopy techniques do offer even better energy
resolution than EELS). Remember that EELS always
offers better spatial resolution.
</p>
<p>There is a tremendous similarity between the TEM-
EELS approach and the valence (surface) EELS
approach, including the need for Kramers-Kronig and
deconvolution software. TEM-based EELS is in the
extremely low-energy (i.e., low-frequency) range around
1 eV and below and corresponds to far infra-red spec-
troscopy which is well into the energy range of studies of
bond vibrations. Higher up the energy-loss range corre-
sponds to the visible and ultra-violet ranges.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to a monochromator, you can
use software to remove the contribution of the tail of the
ZLP but, as we mentioned above, be careful, because this
process may introduce its own artifacts. An example of
the correspondence between EELS and optical valence
spectra is shown in Figure 38.6. In Figure 38.6A, the
importance of initial deconvolution is demonstrated and
the deconvoluted valence spectra are comparedwith ultra-
violet spectra in Figure 38.6B. It is straightforward to
assign the various peaks in the low-loss spectra to specific
interband transitions and also to compare the data with
band-structure calculations (e.g., van Bentham et al.).
Thus, the electronic and optical properties can be
obtained and you can, of course, select any of the features
in the low-loss spectrum and form images with those
electrons. So dielectric-constant imaging is feasible, as is
imaging the various other low-loss signals which we&rsquo;ll now
discuss.
</p>
<p>38.3.C Plasmons
</p>
<p>Plasmons are longitudinal wave-like oscillations that
occur when a beam electron interacts with the weakly
bound electrons in the conductance or valence band.
You can think of plasmons as being like the ripples
that spread out from where a pebble is dropped into a
pond. But, unlike in a pond, the oscillations are rapidly
damped, typically having a lifetime of about 10�15 s and
so are quite localized to &lt;10 nm. The plasmon peak is
the second most dominant feature of the energy-loss
spectrum after the ZLP. The small peak beside the
ZLP in Figure 38.1 is a plasmon peak.
</p>
<p>KRAMERS-KRONIG ANALYSIS
This analysis gives the energy-dependence of the
dielectric constant and other information, which we
usually obtain by optical spectroscopy.
</p>
<p>FOR THE BEST LOW-LOSS SPECTROSCOPY
You need an FEG, a high-resolution, high-dispersion
spectrometer and if you&rsquo;re really going to do it prop-
erly, a monochromator, so the tail of the ZLP does
not mask the low-energy intensity.

density. Typical values of EP are in the range 5&ndash;25 eV
</p>
<p>and a summary of plasmon-loss characteristics is given

n, the free-electron density. Interestingly, n may change
with the chemistry of the specimen. Thus, measurement
of the plasmon-energy loss can give indirect analytical
information (see the next section).
</p>
<p>The characteristic plasmon-scattering angle yE is very
small, being typically &lt; 0.1mrads (as listed in Table
38.1), which means that the plasmon-loss electrons are
strongly forward scattered. Their cut-off angle yc ismuch
greater than yE so if you use a collection angle b of only
10 mrads, you will easily gather almost all the plasmon-
loss electrons (again note the importance of knowing b in
your system). Conversely, this means that even a small
objective aperture will not stop plasmon-loss electrons
entering the TEM imaging system. Plasmon-loss elec-
trons also carry contrast information and, because they
are the most intense energy-loss signal, they are the pri-
mary contribution to chromatic aberration in TEM
images, which is why it is often a good move to filter
them out. As we&rsquo;ve already seen, Figure 38.2 shows the
improvement in image contrast and resolution when the
low-loss (primarily plasmon) spectrum is filtered out of
the image of a specimen showing predominantly mass-
thickness contrast. Likewise, Figure 38.3 shows a thick
foil exhibiting primarily diffraction contrast. A similar
improvement in resolution occurs when the many plas-
mon peaks are filtered out.
</p>
<p>A typical value of the plasmon mean free path lP at
AEM voltages is about 100 nm and so it is reasonable to
expect at least one strong plasmon peak in all but the
thinnest specimens. Likewise, the number of individual
losses should increase with the thickness of your specimen
andwe can use the plasmon-peak intensity to estimate the
specimen thickness. If indeed your specimen is so thin that
only single scattering occurred, and the only significant
scattering was a single plasmon event, then you should be
very pleased because it&rsquo;s a great specimen for ionization-
loss EELS (see the next chapter). Conversely, if your
spectrum shows several plasmon peaks then it is too
thick for ionization-loss studies. Under single-scattering
circumstances we can assume

<p>where lP is the plasmon mean free path, IP (see Figure
38.1) is the intensity in the first (and only) plasmon
peak, and I0 is the intensity in the zero-loss peak.
</p>
<p>The method has advantages over other thickness
measurement techniques in that you can apply it to
any specimen, amorphous or crystalline, over a wide
range of thicknesses. We&rsquo;ll tell you more about EELS
thickness measurements and their role in ionization-loss
spectrometry in Section 39.5.
</p>
<p>If plural scattering is significant, then the spectrum
becomes more difficult to interpret and other problems
arise; e.g., your ionization-loss quantification results
(next chapter) become unreliable.
</p>
<p>Of course, one way around this problem is to use
very thin foils, but often you can&rsquo;t produce thin-enough
specimens.Murphy&rsquo;s law says that the area you&rsquo;re inter-
ested in will usually be too thick. Then you have to
deconvolute the spectra, again using the Fourier-log
approach (Section 39.6) to make the single-scattering
assumption valid. As we&rsquo;ve already noted, deconvolu-
tion brings its own problems.
</p>
<p>Figure 38.7 shows the plasmon-loss spectra from (A)
thin and (B) thick foils of pure Al and (B) also indicates
how the Gatan software uses this information to come
up with a measure of the local foil thickness. Since Al is
a good approximation to a free-electron metal, the plas-
mon-loss process is the dominant energy-loss event.
Plural-plasmon scattering in thicker foils is of concern
because it limits the interpretation of high energy-loss
spectra containing chemical information from ioniza-
tion losses in which we are really interested (see Section
39.4).
</p>
<p>The plasmon losses which we&rsquo;ve just described all
arise from interactions with the electrons in the interior
of your specimen, but the incident electrons can also set
up plasmon oscillations on the specimen surface. We
can envisage these surface plasmons as transverse
charge waves. Surface plasmons have about half the
energy of volume plasmons (because the surface atoms
are not so strongly bound). Generally, however, the
surface plasmon peak is much less intense than the
volume plasmon peak(s), even in the thinnest specimens,
but you can still use them for imaging, as shown by
Batson. With monochromators and aberration correc-
tors, studies of surface plasmons, along with other low-
loss features, will assume more importance in the TEM.
</p>
<p>38.3.D Plasmon-Loss Analysis
</p>
<p>As we just mentioned, the plasmon peaks contain chem-
ical information, because the composition of the spec-
imen may affect the free-electron density, n, which in
turn changes the plasmon-loss peak position. Histori-
cally, this technique was the first aspect of EELS to
produce quantitative analysis data, and it was used in
a limited number of systems, mainly aluminum and
magnesium alloys in which the plasmon-loss spectrum
is dominant and consists of sharp Gaussian peaks
(Williams and Edington). The lack of a more recent
review gives some indication of the limitations of this
approach (see below)!
</p>
<p>The principle of plasmon-loss analysis is based on
empirical observation of the shift in the plasmon-peak
position (EP) with composition (C), giving an expression
of the form
</p>
<p>EP C&eth; &THORN; &frac14; EP 0&eth; &THORN; � C
dEp
</p>
<p>dC
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(38:8)
</p>
<p>where EP(0) is the plasmon loss for the pure compo-
nent. By creating a series of binary alloys of known
composition we can develop a working curve which
we can then use to calibrate measurements of EP in
unknown alloys.
</p>
<p>Since plasmon-loss analysis demands the measure-
ment of peak shifts rather than peak positions, you need
an energy spectrum of the highest resolution and suffi-
cient dispersion to measure the peak centroid accu-
rately. The early plasmon-loss studies did not have
</p>
<p>BALLPARK CALCULATION
A typical ballpark figure: if the intensity in the first
plasmon peak is greater than one tenth the zero-loss
intensity then your specimen is too thick for EELS
quantification.

<p>access to FEGs and so the resolution of the thermionic
source was a limiting factor. Figure 38.8 illustrates some
early plasmon-loss concentration data and the visible
peak shifts that occur and also shows howwe can use the
plasmon peak shifts in Al-Li alloys and convert them
into Li concentration data and also create Li composi-
tions maps, which, given its low Z, is rather difficult to
do with other analytical techniques.
</p>
<p>Plasmon-loss spectrometry has reasonable spatial
resolution and is relatively insensitive to specimen
thickness and surface deposits. The spatial resolution
is controlled by the localization of the plasmon oscilla-
tion which is only a few nm, since the plasmon distur-
bance is rapidly damped by the free electrons. The
specimen thickness only affects the number and inten-
sity of the plasmon peaks, not their position, as you can
see in Figure 38.7. In fact you get the best results from
plasmon-loss spectrometry when your specimen is
about 1&ndash;2 mean free paths (lP) thick so that several,
intense, Gaussian peaks are observable. There are,
unfortunately, strong practical disadvantages, which
</p>
<p>account for the almost complete absence of plasmon-
loss data since the advent of ionization-loss techniques
in the mid-1970s
</p>
<p>&amp; We are limited to specimens showing well-defined
peaks, and only binary specimens can be sensibly
analyzed.
</p>
<p>&amp; The alloying elementmust produce a detectable change
in EP and this is not always the case. For example, the
addition of 30 at.% Zn to Al scarcely changes EP.
</p>
<p>It is possible that application of modern detection
and data processing techniques may improve the quality
and ease of analyzing plasmon-loss spectra. While plas-
mon peak-shift analysis is limited, we can at least use the
low-loss plasmon spectra for chemical fingerprinting, as
we&rsquo;ve already described, and we&rsquo;ll discuss the prospects
for more quantitative interpretation of low-loss spectra
via modeling in Section 38.4.

of nanoscale materials, the fact that strong scaling

<p>correlations exist between the plasmon energy and elas-
tic properties, hardness, valence-electron density, and
cohesive energy is leading to a resurgence of interest in
this part of the spectrum (e.g., Oleshko and Howe).
</p>
<p>38.3.E Single-Electron Excitations
</p>
<p>A high-energy beam electron may transfer sufficient
energy to a single electron in the valence band to change
its orbital state, perhapsmoving it to an unoccupied state
in the conduction band. We call these events single-elec-
tron interactions and they result in inter/intraband tran-
sitions for the valence electrons, with energy losses of up
to�25 eV.An example of an interband transition is given
in the spectra from different polymers which can be dis-
tinguished solely by their electronic differences (Hunt
et al.), as shown inFigure 38.9A. Interactionswithmolec-
ular orbitals, such as the p orbitals produce characteristic
peaks in this low-energy region of the spectrum, some-
times causing shifts in the plasmon peak (either up or
down depending on the relative energy of the interband
transition and the plasmon loss), and that is why it is
possible to use the intensity variation in this part of the
spectrum to fingerprint a particular phase. A more chal-
lenging example is given in Figure 38.9B, which shows
what can be done with a combination of cryo- and low-
dose STEM to image a polymer nano-emulsion in an
aqueousmedium. The low-loss spectra reveal the electron-
ic differences between the phases (including amorphous
ice!) and the filtered images show the lobed shape of the
emulsified particles. There is probably no other techni-
que that could image such beam-sensitive material at
such high resolution (Kim et al.).
</p>
<p>If a beam electron gives a weakly bound, valence-
band electron sufficient energy to escape the attractive
field of the nucleus, then a secondary electron (SE) is
created, of the sort used to give topographic images in
the SEM and STEM. Typically, a SE requires &lt; 20 eV
to escape the surface and therefore the electrons causing
SE emission appear in the same low-energy region of the
spectrum as the inter- and intraband transitions.
</p>
<p>38.3.F The Band Gap
</p>
<p>In the region of the spectrum immediately after the ZLP,
and before the rise in intensity preceding the plasmon
peak, you can see a region of low intensity. If there are no
interband transitions occurring, the intensity in this por-
tion of the spectrum approaches the dark-current (noise)
level of the detector. This low intensity implies that there
is a forbidden-transition region, which is simply the band
gap, between the valence and conduction bands in semi-
conductors and insulators. To determine the band gap,
you need to strip off the tail of the ZLP (with all the
consequent difficulties) and measure the energy range of
the gap out to the rise in the initial low-loss spectrum.
Figure 38.10A illustrates the variable band gap in spectra
from specimens of Si, and its oxide and nitride. Mapping
this change in the energy range in which no transitions
occur gives band-gap images (Figure 38.10B) and several
examples of this are given by Kimoto et al. As sub-
nanometer-scale semiconductor technology advances,

<p>38.4 MODELING THE LOW-LOSS
SPECTRUM
</p>
<p>As you now know, the low-loss spectrum has the advan-
tage of significant intensity (so counting statistics are not a
problem) and it contains useful data about your speci-
men, such as composition, bonding, the dielectric con-
stant, the band gap, the free-electron density, and optical
properties. With all this information you might have
thought that we understood the spectrum very well and

<p>were able to model it with some degree of precision and
could use the modeling to predict spectra from different
materials. Perversely, we are better able to do this for the
much lower intensity, high-loss spectrum, aswe&rsquo;ll describe
in Chapters 39 and 40. However, significant progress is
being made in calculating the plasmon-loss energies and
interband transitions. As we&rsquo;ve seen, the plasmon peak is
basically an oscillation of the free electrons, so equation
38.6 has been used over several decades to calculate the
plasmon-loss energy, but this approach can&rsquo;t handle the
effects of other low-loss features like interband transi-
tions. French has developed software for low-loss model-
ing, called Electronic Structure Tools (see URL #1),
which consists of a number of programs for the quantita-
tive analysis of optical, VUV, and EELS spectra. Keast
has shown good agreement between experimental and
calculated low-loss spectra for a range of metals and
ceramics, as shown in Figure 38.11, using abinitio meth-
ods, which we&rsquo;ll describe in some more detail in Chapter
40, and this topic is dealt with extensively in the compa-
nion text. Modeling of such spectra requires careful
experimental control and for the data of Figure 38.11
the convergence angle of the (100-kV) beam was 8.3
mrad, the Gatan spectrometer collection angle was 5.8
mrad, 100 spectra (0.05 s per acquisition) were aligned,
corrected for dark current and gain variations, and
summed. The density-functional theory (see Section
</p>
<p>40.5.A) calculations (using the random-phase approxima-
tion and neglecting local-field effects) were performed
using theWIEN2k code. Exchange and correlation effects
were treated using the generalized gradient approxima-
tion. The final spectrum was averaged over the different
orientation components. So you get the idea that this is
not straightforward!

</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The low-loss (valence/plasmon) portion of the spectrum from 0 to 50 eV contains a wealth
of useful information about the specimen.
</p>
<p>&amp; The ZLP is the most intense signal. If you filter out all the low-loss electrons apart from the
ZLP, you get images and DPs which generally show higher resolution and better contrast
than unfiltered ones because they are free of chromatic aberration and diffuse-scattering
effects.
</p>
<p>&amp; The low-loss spectrum reflects beam interactions with loosely bound conduction and
valence-band electrons.
</p>
<p>&amp; From different portions of the low-loss spectrum, you can measure the local dielectric
constant of your specimen, the free-electron density, the thickness, the band gap, and
observe inter/intraband transitions. You can also form images using energy-loss elec-
trons which map out all these phenomena, generally with sub-nanometer resolution.
</p>
<p>&amp; The low-loss spectrum can be used to fingerprint (identify) specific elements, compounds,
andbiological tissueby comparisonwith the characteristics of standard spectra indatabases.
</p>
<p>&amp; In some binary alloy systems of light elements, you can determine composition by
measuring shifts in the plasmon-peak centroid. Plasmon imaging also has the potential
for mapping nanoscale mechanical properties.

beam-specimen interactions that contribute to this high-intensity portion of the spectrum.

<p>High Energy-Loss Spectra and Images
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>The high energy-loss spectrum (E&gt;50 eV) consists primarily of ionization or core-loss edges
on a rapidly decreasing plural-scattering background. Elemental-composition data and
elemental maps can be extracted from these ionization edges. In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll examine
how to get this information, quantify it, and image it. A good use for such data is light-
element analysis wherein EELS complements XEDS. First, we&rsquo;ll remind you of the experi-
mental variables over which you have control, because these are rather critical. Then we&rsquo;ll
discuss how to obtain a spectrum and what it should look like if you&rsquo;re going to quantify it.
Next, we&rsquo;ll discuss the various quantification routines which, in principle, are just as
straightforward as those for XEDS but in practice require rather more sophisticated soft-
ware, and we often need to use deconvolution routines. Elemental imaging is a powerful
aspect of high-energy-loss EELS, particularly, because both the spatial resolution and
minimum detection limits are somewhat better than XEDS and atomic-column spectro-
scopy and single-atom detection are more easily achievable in EELS.
</p>
<p>39.1 THE HIGH-LOSS SPECTRUM
</p>
<p>The high-loss portion of the spectrum above �50 eV
contains information from inelastic interactions with
the inner or core shells. These interactions provide direct
elemental identification in a manner similar to XEDS
and other information, such as bonding and atomic
position. We&rsquo;ll emphasize quantitative elemental analy-
sis and mapping in this chapter and discuss the other
features of the high-loss spectrum in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>39.1.A Inner-Shell Ionization
</p>
<p>When a beam electron transfers sufficient energy to a
core-shell electron (i.e., one in the inner, more tightly
bound K, L, M, etc., shells) to move it outside the
attractive field of the nucleus, the atom is said to be
ionized (go back and look at Figure 4.2). As you know
from the earlier chapters on X-ray analysis, the decay of
the excited atom back to its ground state may produce a
characteristic X-ray or an Auger electron. So high-loss
EELS and XEDS detect different aspects of the same
phenomenon. Ionization is the primary event and X-ray
emission is one of two secondary processes. We are
interested in ionization losses precisely because the pro-
cess is characteristic of the atom involved and so the
signal is a direct source of chemical information, just
like the characteristic X-ray. We call the ionization-loss
</p>
<p>signal in the EELS spectrum an &lsquo;edge,&rsquo; rather than a
peak, for reasons we&rsquo;ll describe shortly and we use the
edges as the basis for elemental mapping.
</p>
<p>Ionization is a relatively high-energy process. For
example, the lightest solid element, Li, requires an
input of � 55 eV to eject a K-shell electron, and so the
loss electrons are usually found in the high-loss region of
the spectrum, above E = 50 eV. K-shell electrons require
much more energy for ejection as Z increases because they
are more strongly bound to the nucleus. The binding
energy for electrons in the uranium K shell is about
99 keV. So we tend to use L and M edges when dealing
with high-Z atoms (just like inXEDS)because the intensity
of the K edges decreases substantially above � 2 keV. It&rsquo;s
worth a short mention here about the nomenclature used
</p>
<p>EELS COMPLEMENTS XEDS
Detection of the high-energy electron that ionized the
atom is independent of whether the atom emits an X-
ray or an Auger electron. So EELS is not affected by
the fluorescence-yield limitation that restricts light-
element X-ray analysis. These differences explain, in
part, the complementary nature of XEDS and ioni-
zation-loss EELS but also the much higher efficiency
of EELS.

<p>for EELS edges. As for X-rays, where we have K, L, M,
etc., peaks in the spectrum,we get ionization edges fromK,
L,M, etc., shell electrons.However, themuchbetter energy
resolution of the magnetic-prism spectrometer means that
it is much easier to detect small differences in spectra that
arise from the presence of different energy states in the
shell. For example
</p>
<p>&amp; TheK shell electron is in the 1 s state and gives rise to
a single K edge.
</p>
<p>&amp; In the L shell, the electrons are in either 2s or 2p
orbitals, and if a 2s electron is ejected, we get an L1
edge and a 2p electron causes either an L2 or L3 edge.
</p>
<p>Depending on the ionization energy, the L2 and L3
edges may not be resolvable (they aren&rsquo;t in Al but they
are in Ti), and so we call this edge the L2,3. The full range
of possible edges is shown schematically in Figure 39.1,
and you can see that other dual edges exist, such as
the M4,5.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Compared with plasmon excitation, which requires
much less energy, the ionization cross sections are rela-
tively small and themean free paths relatively large. As a
result, the ionization-edge intensity in the spectrum is
much smaller than the plasmon peak, and becomes even
smaller as the energy loss increases (look back to Figure
37.1). This is another reason for staying with the lower
energy-loss (L and M) core edges. While the possibility
of plural ionization events being triggered by the same
electron is small in a typical thin foil, we&rsquo;ll see that the
combination of an ionization loss and a plasmon loss is
by no means uncommon. This phenomenon distorts the
EEL spectrum and any filtered images.
</p>
<p>If you go back and look at Figure 4.2, you can see
that a specific minimum-energy transfer from the beam
electron to the inner-shell electron is required to over-
come the binding energy of the electron to the nucleus
and ionize the atom. This minimum energy constitutes
the ionization threshold, or the critical ionization
energy, Ec.
</p>
<p>We define EC as EK for a particular K-shell electron,
EL for an L shell, etc. Of course, it is also possible to
ionize an atom by the transfer of E&gt;EC. However, the
probability of ionization occurring becomes less with
increasing energy above EC because the ionization
cross section decreases with increasing energy transfer.
As a result, the ionization-loss electrons have an energy
distribution that ideally shows a sharp rise to a max-
imum at EC, followed by a slowly decreasing intensity
above EC back toward the background. This triangular
shape is called an edge because you&rsquo;ll notice that, as
shown in Figure 39.2A, it has a similar intensity profile
to the absorption edges inX-ray spectroscopy. Often the
term &lsquo;hydrogenic&rsquo; is used for such a sharp edge-onset
because this is what would arise from the ionization of
the ideal single isolated hydrogen atom.
</p>
<p>In reality, because we aren&rsquo;t dealing with isolated
atoms, but atoms integrated into a crystal lattice or an
amorphous structure, the spectra are more complex.
Ionization edges are superimposed on a rapidly decreas-
ing background intensity from electrons that have under-
gone random, plural inelastic scattering events (Figure
39.2B). The edge may also show fine structure oscilla-
tions within �50 eV of EC (Figure 39.2C) which are due
to bonding effects (termed energy-loss near-edge
</p>
<p>structure, ELNES). More than 50 eV after the edge,
small intensity oscillations may be detectable (Figure
39.2D) due to diffraction effects from the atoms sur-
rounding the ionized atom, and these are called extended
energy-loss fine structure (EXELFS), which is analogous
to extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) in
X-ray spectra, particularly, those generated from intense
synchrotron sources.
</p>
<p>Finally, as we noted earlier, the ionization-loss elec-
trons may also undergo low-loss interactions. For exam-
ple, they may create plasmons, in which case the edge
contains extra plural-scattering intensity �15&ndash;25 eV
above EC, as shown schematically in Figure 39.2E. So
experimental ionization edges are far more complicated
than the Gaussian peaks in an XEDS spectrum, but they
also contain far more information about the specimen
than a characteristic peak. From an XEDS spectrum,
you only get elemental identification rather than chemical
information, such as bonding which is contained both in
the ELNES and the low-loss structure (although as we
showed in Figure 32.9C, if the X-ray spectrometer has
sufficiently high-energy resolution, it can detect such
differences but the price to pay in the AEM is an unac-
ceptably low count rate). Figure 39.3 shows a spectrum
from BN on a C film. The various ionization edges show
some of the features drawn schematically in Figure 39.2,
in particular, strong ELNES on the B-K edge; we&rsquo;ll
discuss these fine-structure effects more in Section 40.1
and how to form fine-structure images from them in
Section 40.5.C.
</p>
<p>39.1.B Ionization-Edge Characteristics
</p>
<p>The angular distribution of ionization-loss electrons var-
ies as (y2+ yE
</p>
<p>2)&ndash;1 and will be a maximumwhen y=0, in
the forward-scattered direction. The distribution decreases
to a half width at the characteristic scattering angle yE
given by equation 38.1. This behavior is essentially the
same as for plasmon scattering but because we have rela-
tively large values of EC compared to EP, we get larger
characteristic scattering angles for ionization-loss elec-
trons (e.g., for the typical, maximum core-loss energy
that we would use for analysis E = 2000 eV so yE �10
mrad when E0 = 100 keV).
</p>
<p>The angular distribution varies depending on E, and
because of the extended energy range of ionization-loss
</p>
<p>TRIANGULAR SHAPE
This idealized triangular or sawtooth shape is only
found in spectra from isolated hydrogen atoms and is
therefore called a hydrogenic ionization edge. Real
ionization edges have shapes that approximate, more
or less, to the hydrogenic edge.
</p>
<p>ELNES AND EXELFS
Fine structure around the ionization edge onset is
known as ELNES. Small intensity oscillations
&gt;�50 eV after the edge due to diffraction effects are
called EXELFS.

<p>electrons above EC, this can be quite complicated. For
E�EC the scattering intensity drops rapidly to zero over
about 10 mrads (at yc), but as E increases above EC the
angular-intensity distribution drops around y = 08,
</p>
<p>but increases at larger scattering angles, giving rise to
the so-called Bethe ridge. However, this effect is not
really important for the kind of analytical studies that
we are emphasizing in this chapter.

<p>So, the distribution of characteristic scattering angles
for the core-loss electrons that we use for analysis span
the range from �0.2 to 10 mrads and the scattering cut-
off angles range from �25 to 200 mrads (equation 38.4).
In other words, like the plasmon-loss electrons, the
ionization-loss electrons are very strongly forward-
scattered. Consequently, efficient collection of most
inelastically scattered electrons is straightforward, since
a spectrometer entrance aperture angle (b) of 10 mrads
will collect the great majority of such electrons. As a
result, collection efficiencies in the range 50&ndash;100% are
not unreasonable, which contrasts with XEDS where the
isotropic generation of characteristic X-rays results in
very inefficient collection. Figure 39.4 compares the col-
lection of X-rays and energy-loss electrons and Figure
39.5 shows the variation in collection efficiency for ioni-
zation-loss electrons as a function of both b and energy.
</p>
<p>While the K edges in Figure 39.3 show sharp onsets,
like an ideal hydrogenic edge, not all edges are similar in
shape. Some edges have much broader onsets, spread
over several eV or even tens of eV. The edge shape in
general depends on the electronic structure of the atom
but, unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t give a simple relationship
between edge types and specific shapes. The situation is
further complicated because the edge shapes change
depending on whether or not certain energy states are
filled or unfilled. For example, if you go back and look
at Figure 37.1, the Ni L edge shows two sharp peaks,
which are the L3 and L2 edges. (We&rsquo;ll discuss these
details much more in Section 40.1.) These sharp lines
arise because the ejected L shell electrons don&rsquo;t entirely
escape from the atom and have a very high probability
of ending up in unfilled d-band states. In contrast, in Cu
where the d band is full, the L2,3 edge does not show
these intense lines. Similar sharp lines appear in theM4,5
edges in the rare earths. As if this were not enough, the

<p>details of the fine structure and edge shapes are also
affected by bonding. For example, the Si edge in a
spectrum from SiO2 is different from the Si edge from
pure Si. To sort all this out it&rsquo;s best if you consult the
2004 EELS Atlas (by Ahn and related references in the
previous chapter) which contains representative edges
from all the elements and many oxides.
</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered both the low and high
energy-loss processes, we can summarize the character-
istics of the energy-loss spectrum by examining a
</p>
<p>complete spectrum from NiO containing both low and
high-loss electrons, as shown in Figure 39.6. In this
figure, we also compare the spectrum to the energy-
level diagram for NiO. You can see that
</p>
<p>&amp; The ZLP is above the potential wells since these
electrons don&rsquo;t interact with the atom.

<p>&amp; The relative energy levels of the ionized shell (K, L,
or M) control the position of the ionization edge in
the spectrum. The closer to the nucleus, the deeper
the potential well and the more the energy required
to eject the electron.
</p>
<p>&amp; There will be a different density of states in the
valence (3d) band of the Ni atom compared to the s
band of the O atoms at the top of the potential wells.
</p>
<p>&amp; The core electrons could also be given enough energy
to travel into the empty states, well above EF and, in
this case, we see ELNES after the ionization edge.
We&rsquo;ll discuss more details of such fine structure in
the spectrum in Chapter 40.
</p>
<p>Despite the very high collection efficiency of the
spectrometer, the ionization edges still show relatively
low intensity, particularly asE increases. The edges have
an extended energy range well above EC and ride on a
rapidly varying, relatively high background. All these
factors, as we shall see, combine to make quantitative
analysis using EELS a little more challenging than
XEDS. However, for the lighter elements the X-ray
fluorescence yield drops to such low values, and absorp-
tion becomes so strong, even in thin specimens, that
EELS is the preferred technique. Experimentally, the
choice between the two is not always simple, but below
oxygen in the periodic table, EELS shows better perfor-
mance than XEDS and for elements below boron, there
is no sensible alternative to EELS for nanometer-scale
analysis.
</p>
<p>39.2 ACQUIRING A HIGH-LOSS
SPECTRUM
</p>
<p>From what we&rsquo;ve described about the various EEL
spectrometers and filters and the complexity of the spec-
tra, it should be clear that there are many variables to
control when acquiring a spectrum (see Brydson&rsquo;s
monograph for a detailed description). Computer con-
trol via the Gatan software nowmakes this process very
straightforward. We&rsquo;ll start by summarizing the major
parameters relevant to acquiring high-loss spectra and
images and indicate reasonable values for each
parameter.
</p>
<p>&amp; Beam Energy E0: It&rsquo;s best to use the highest E0,
unless doing so causes displacement damage or sig-
nificant surface sputtering. A higher E0 reduces the
scattering cross section and so you get reduced edge
intensity. Conversely, as E0 increases, the plural-
scattering background intensity falls faster than the
edge intensity and so the signal to background
increases. The increase in signal to background var-
ies with the particular edge but it is never a strong
variation; so while we recommend using the highest
</p>
<p>kV, it&rsquo;s not a good reason (on its own) to justify
purchasing a 300-keV TEM.
</p>
<p>&amp; Convergence angle a: You know how to control a
with the C2 aperture and/or the C2 lens, but a is only
important in quantification if it is larger than b. So if
you operate in TEM image or diffraction mode with
a broad, parallel beam, rather than STEM mode,
you can ignore a; otherwise, use the correction factor
we give later in Section 39.7.
</p>
<p>&amp; Beam size and current: You control these factors by
your choice of electron source, C1 lens, and C2
aperture. As usual, the beam size is important in
determining spatial resolution in STEM mode, and
the beam current controls the signal intensity.
</p>
<p>&amp; Specimen thickness: The specimen must be thin
because this minimizes plural-scattering contribu-
tions to the spectrum and quantification is more
straightforward.
</p>
<p>If your specimen is too thick then you&rsquo;ll have to use
deconvolution procedures to remove the effects of
plural scattering. So we&rsquo;ll tell youmore about how to
determine your specimen thickness from the spec-
trum and how to decide if you need to deconvolute
the spectrum.
</p>
<p>&amp; Collection angle b: You know from Section 37.4 how
to measure b in all operating modes. If you need lots
of intensity and are happy with poor spatial resolu-
tion, use TEM image mode with no objective aper-
ture (b &gt;�100 mrads). A small spectrometer
entrance aperture ensures good energy resolution at
the same time. If you want a small b to prevent
contributions to the spectrum from high-angle scat-
tering, use diffraction mode (TEM or STEM) and
keep the small entrance aperture for good energy
resolution. In the STEM case you also get good
spatial resolution.
</p>
<p>Generally, for analysis b�1&ndash;10mrads is fine, so long
as it&rsquo;s less than the Bragg angle for your specimen
orientation; but for EELS imaging, which we discuss
in Section 39.9, 100 mrads may be necessary to get
the necessary signal intensity.
</p>
<p>SPECIMEN THICKNESS
Making your specimen as thin as possible is the most
important part of EELS.
</p>
<p>ENTRANCE APERTURE
Remember that a 5 mm diameter entrance aperture
gives b �5 mrad at a camera length of �800mm.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&amp; Energy resolution: DE is limited by your electron
source unless you have a monochromator. Elemen-
tal analysis and imaging (the topic of this chapter) do
not require the best DE, so�5 eV would suffice. You
really need the best DE for low-loss and fine-struc-
ture studies, which are probably the most useful and
widespread aspect of EELS (see the surrounding
chapters). Use an FEG source and a PEELS/imag-
ing filter if you want to do this, especially if you&rsquo;re
lucky enough to have access to a monochromator.
</p>
<p>&amp; Energy-loss range and spectrum dispersion: The full
spectrum extends out to the beam energy E0, but the
useful portion only extends to�2 keV. Above this E,
the intensity is very low, and XEDS is both easier
and more accurate. Since you rarely need to collect a
spectrum above �2 keV a minimum of 2048 chan-
nels in the computer display, giving 1 eV/channel is a
good starting dispersion. You can easily select a
higher display resolution if you want to look at a
more limited region of the spectrum or if you want to
see detail with DE &lt;1 eV. Typically, you&rsquo;re only
examining a limited portion of the spectrum anyhow
and you set this by putting the necessary voltage on
the drift tube or changing the high voltage.
</p>
<p>&amp; Dwell time: If you have a PEELS with a PDA, set the
integration time so that at the maximum intensity
you don&rsquo;t saturate the diodes: i.e., stay below 16,000
counts per acquisition in the most intense channel
and sum as many spectra as you need to give suffi-
cient counts for analysis.
</p>
<p>&amp; Number of acquisitions: Again, if you have PEELS/
PDA, multiple acquisitions may be necessary to get
sufficient counts in the edge, but remember that
multiple acquisitions may give rise to minor arti-
facts, as we discussed in Section 37.5.
</p>
<p>Before you analyze a particular spectrum, you
should check four things
</p>
<p>&amp; Focus and align the ZLP and check the spectrometer
resolution.
</p>
<p>&amp; Look at the low-loss (plasmon) portion of the spec-
trum; this gives you an idea of your specimen
thickness.
</p>
<p>&amp; Look for the expected ionization edges. If you can&rsquo;t
see any edges, your specimen is probably too thick or
you need to raise the display gain.
</p>
<p>&amp; It&rsquo;s probably worth deconvoluting out the PSF prior
to any quantification.
</p>
<p>The first of these tasks is not critical, as we noted
earlier. Regarding the second task, we noted back in
Chapter 38 that, to a first approximation, if the plas-
mon-peak intensity is less than about one tenth the ZLP,
then the specimen is thin enough for analysis. Otherwise,
you&rsquo;ll probably have to deconvolute plural-scattering
effects from your experimental spectrum. For the third
</p>
<p>task, you should ideally see discrete edges on a smoothly
varying background, but you need to see at least a
change in slope in the background intensity at the
expected EC. If the background intensity is too noisy
it will make quantification more difficult, so acquire
sufficient counts to generate a smoothly varying back-
ground.
</p>
<p>The jump ratio is the ratio of the maximum edge
intensity (Imax) to the minimum intensity (Imin) in the
channel preceding the edge onset, as shown in Figure
39.7 (which is a well-defined edge from a suitably thin
film of amorphous carbon). If the jump ratio is above
�5, for the carbon K edge at 284 eV from a 50 nm
carbon film at 100 kV, then your system is operating
satisfactorily. You should keep a standard thin, amor-
phous-carbon film available as a standard reference
specimen and occasionally check that the jump ratio
remains the same. We&rsquo;ll see that jump-ratio imaging is
one method of acquiring filtered images from ionization
edges. The jump ratio increases as E0 increases. If you
can&rsquo;t get such a jump ratio from a standard, thin, carbon
film, then probably you need to realign the spectrom-
eter. The actual ionization-loss edges from your real
specimen, that you may wish to quantify or use to form
images, will probably be nothing like this ideal edge, but
the EELS software programs are more than capable of

backgrounds.
</p>
<p>39.3 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
</p>
<p>As with XEDS, you should always carry out a qualita-
tive analysis first to ensure that you have identified all
the features in your spectrum. Then you can decide
which edges to use for subsequent quantitative analysis
and imaging.
</p>
<p>Qualitative analysis using ionization edges is very
straightforward. Unlike XEDS, there are actually very
few artifacts that can be mistaken for an edge. The most
prominent artifact that may lead to misidentification is
the ghost peak from diode saturation (see Section 37.5)
which is easily removed. So long as you calibrate the
spectrum to within a few eV you can unambiguously
identify the edge energy.
</p>
<p>You have to be careful here: sometimes you&rsquo;ll see the
edge energy defined somewhat arbitrarily halfway up the
edge, e.g., at the p* peak on the front of aC-K edge. There
is no strict convention, and very often L and M edges do
not have sharp onsets anyhow. Examination of a portion
of a spectrum, such as that shown back in Figure 39.3, is
usually sufficient to let you draw a definite conclusion
about the identity of the specimen, which in this case is
BN on a C support film. In addition, it is wise to compare
your spectrum with reference spectra from the EELS
Atlas that we&rsquo;ve mentioned several times before or
through an on-line database, such as URL #1.
</p>
<p>Remember that there are families of edges (K, L2,3,
M4,5, etc.) just as there are families of peaks in X-ray
spectra but, as with X-ray spectra, youmight not be able
to resolve all the edges in a single family. Given that
above �2 keV the edges are usually too small to be
detected, it is in fact very rare that you would expect to
see more than one family of lines from a given element
(the Si L edge at �100 eV and the Si K edge at 1.7 keV
should both be visible in the same spectrum). As a rule
of thumb, quantification is equally easy with K and L
edges, but the accuracy of K-edge quantification is
slightly better. Up to Z = 13 (Al) we usually use K
edges because any L edges occur at very low energy
and are masked by the plasmon peak. Above Z = 13
you can use either K or L edges. Sometimes there is the
question of which edge is most visible. The K edge onset
is generally a bit sharper than the L edge which consists
</p>
<p>of both the L2 and L3 edges and so may be somewhat
broader, but this is not always the case.
</p>
<p>L edges forZ=19&ndash;28 (e.g., the Ca-L edge in Figure
37.12 and the Cr-L edge in Figure 39.13) andZ=37&ndash;45
are characterized by intense near-edge structure called
white lines. M edges for Z= 55&ndash;69 have similar intense
lines.
</p>
<p>These white lines are so named because they appeared
as lines of varying intensity in photographically recorded,
energy-loss spectra; they also appear that way if you look
at the spectra from in-column filters (see Figure 37.14A).
More details will be given in Section 40.1. If you have to
use the M, N, or O edges without any white lines, you
should know that they are very broad, with an ill-defined
threshold, and quantification is best achieved with stan-
dards, as we&rsquo;ll see shortly.
</p>
<p>The energy-loss spectrum clearly does not lend itself
to a quick &lsquo;semi-quantitative&rsquo; analysis; so we can&rsquo;t fol-
low our XEDS approach. For example, the spectrum in
Figure 39.3 comes from equal numbers of B and N
atoms, but the intensities in the B and N edges are
markedly different. This difference arises because of
the variation in ionization cross section with E, the
strongly varying nature of the plural-scattering back-
ground, and the edge shape, which causes the C andNK
edges to ride on the tails of the preceding edge(s).
</p>
<p>The Ti-nitride and Ti-carbide example: Sometimes qua-
litative analysis is often all that you need to do. Figure
39.8 shows images and spectra from two small precipi-
tates in an alloy steel. The spectra show a Ti L23 edge in
both cases and C and NK edges in Figure 39.8A and B,
respectively. It does not take much effort to deduce that
the first particle is TiC because it is the only known
carbide of Ti, but the nitride could be either TiN or
Ti3N. To determine which of the two it is, you have to
carry out full quantification, which we&rsquo;ll discuss shortly.
You should note that such clear discrimination between
TiC and TiN in Figure 39.8B would be difficult using
windowless XEDS because the energy resolution is close
to the separation of the Ti L (E =452 eV) and the N K
(E =392 eV) X-ray peaks. In addition, the DPs from
both phases are almost identical, so this problem is a
perfect one for EELS.
</p>
<p>39.4 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
</p>
<p>To quantify the spectrum or to form a quantitative
image, you have to integrate the intensity (I) in the ioni-
zation edge(s) by removing the plural-scattering back-
ground. Then you have to determine the number of
atoms (N) responsible for I. N is related to I by a sensi-
tivity factor termed the partial ionization cross section
(s). We&rsquo;ll see that s plays a similar role to the kAB factor
in X-ray analysis. If you go back and look at Figure 39.2,
</p>
<p>IONIZATION EDGE
We identify the ionization edge as the energy loss at
which there is a discrete increase in the slope of the
spectrum; this value is the edge onset, i.e., EC, the
critical ionization energy.
</p>
<p>39 .4 QUANT ITAT IVE ANALYS I S ............................................................................................................................................................... 723</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see how an ionization edge is built up from several
contributions. The process of quantification in essence
involves stripping away (or ignoring) the various contri-
butions until you&rsquo;re left with Figure 39.2A, which con-
tains the single-scattering or hydrogenic-edge intensity.
</p>
<p>39.4.A Derivation of the Equations
for Quantification
</p>
<p>The equations we use for quantitative analysis and
imaging have been derived, refined, and applied by
Egerton and co-workers. The following derivation is a
summary of the full treatment by Egerton given in his
textbook.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll assume that we are quantifying a K edge,
although the basic approach can be used for all edges.
The K-edge intensity above background, IK, is related
to the probability of ionization, PK, and the total trans-
mitted intensity, IT, by
</p>
<p>IK &frac14; PKIT (39:1)
</p>
<p>This equation assumes that the intensities are measured
over the complete angular range (0&ndash;4p sr), which of
course, is not the case, but we&rsquo;ll correct this later. In a
good thin specimen we can approximate IT to the inci-
dent intensity, neglecting backscatter and absorption
effects. Now, this is the important point: if we assume
also that the electrons contributing to the edge have
only undergone a single ionization event, then we can
easily obtain an expression for Pk.
</p>
<p>PK &frac14; NsK exp �
t
</p>
<p>lK
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(39:2)
</p>
<p>where N is the number of atoms per unit area of the
specimen (of thickness t) that contribute to the K edge.
The assumption of a single ionization (i.e., scattering)
event is reasonable, given the large mean free path (lk)
for ionization losses; and it explains why you have to
make thin specimens. Assuming single scattering also
means that the exponential term is very close to unity
and so

</p>
<p>and therefore
</p>
<p>N &frac14;
IK
</p>
<p>sKIT
(39:4)
</p>
<p>Thus, we canmeasure the absolute number of atoms per
unit area of the specimen simply by measuring the
intensity above background in the K edge and dividing
it by the total intensity in the spectrummultiplied by the
ionization cross section. We can easily extend this
expression to two edges from elements A and B, in
which case the IT drops out and we can write

</p>
<p>IBKs

</p>
<p>(39:5)
</p>
<p>Similar expressions apply to L, M edges, etc., and com-
binations of edges can be used. So you see that if you are
quantifying more than one element, then you don&rsquo;t need
to gather the ZLP, which saves hitting the PDA or CCD
with this high-intensity signal.
</p>
<p>In both equations 39.4 and 39.5 we assumed that
we could accurately subtract the background under
the edge and that we know s. Unfortunately, as you&rsquo;ll
see, both background subtraction and determination of
s are non-trivial. We will discuss these points later,
but first we must take account of the practical realities
of spectrum acquisition, and modify the equations
accordingly.
</p>
<p>&amp; First, you can&rsquo;t gather the whole of the spectrum out
to the beam energy, E0, because above �2 keV the
intensity decreases to a level close to the system
noise.
</p>
<p>&amp; Second, while ionization-loss electrons can theoreti-
cally have any energy between EC and E0, in practice
the intensity in the edge falls to the background level
within about 100 eV of the threshold, EC.
</p>
<p>&amp; Third, the background-extrapolation process becomes
increasingly inaccurate beyond �100 eV.
</p>
<p>For all these reasons, it is imperative to restrict
integration of the edge intensities to some window, D,
usually in the range 20&ndash;100 eV. So we modify equation
39.4 to give
</p>
<p>IK&eth;D&THORN; &frac14; NsK&eth;D&THORN;IT&eth;D&THORN; (39:6)
</p>
<p>The term IT(D) is more correctly written as Il(D) where Il
is the intensity of the zero-loss (direct beam) electrons
combined with the low-loss electrons over an energy-
loss windowD. Only if we have true single scattering can
we use IT and we&rsquo;ll discuss the conditions for this later.
</p>
<p>As we discussed, EELS has the tremendous advan-
tage that the energy-loss electrons are predominantly
forward scattered and so you can easily gather most of
the signal. So because we nevermanage to collect the full
angular range of energy-loss electrons, we must further
modify the equation by including the collection angle b
and write
</p>
<p>IK&eth;bD&THORN; &frac14; NsK&eth;bD&THORN;I1&eth;bD&THORN; (39:7)
</p>
<p>This factor sK(bD) is the partial ionization cross
section.
</p>
<p>From this equation therefore, the absolute quantifi-
cation for N is given by
</p>
<p>N &frac14;
IK bD&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>I1 bD&eth; &THORN;sK bD&eth; &THORN;
(39:8)
</p>
<p>For a ratio of two elements A and B, the low-loss
intensity drops out again as in equation 39.5
</p>
<p>NA
</p>
<p>NB
&frac14;
</p>
<p>IAK bD&eth; &THORN;s
B
K bD&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>IKB bD&eth; &THORN;sAK bD&eth; &THORN;
(39:9)
</p>
<p>We can draw a direct analogy between this equation and
the Cliff-Lorimer expression (equation 35.2) used in
thin-film XEDS. In both cases, the composition ratio
CA/CB or NA/NB is related to the intensity ratio IA/IB
through a sensitivity factor which we call the kAB factor
in XEDS and which in EELS is the ratio of two partial
cross sections, sB/sA.
</p>
<p>Remember that the major assumption in this whole
approach is that the electrons undergo a single-scattering
event. In practice, it&rsquo;s difficult to avoid some plural scatter-
ing, although in very thin specimens the approximation
remains valid, if errors of �10&ndash;20% are acceptable. If
plural scattering is significant, then it must be removed
by deconvolution, whichwe&rsquo;ll discuss in Section 39.6. You
should also note when using the ratio equation your anal-
ysis is a lot better if the two edges are similar in shape, i.e.,
both K edges, or both L edges, otherwise the approxima-
tions inherent in equation 39.9 will be less accurate.
</p>
<p>In summary, equations 39.8 and 39.9 give us, respec-
tively, an absolute value of the number of atoms/unit
area of the specimen or a ratio of the number of atoms of
the elements A and B either at a given analysis point or
within a filtered image. To get this information experi-
mentally, you have to carry out two essential steps
</p>
<p>&amp; Background subtraction to obtain IK (and hence,N)
for each element A, B, etc.
</p>
<p>&amp; Determination of the partial ionization cross section
sK(bD) to get the ratio NA/NB.
</p>
<p>So again, you can see why it is important to know b.

<p>39.4.B Background Subtraction
</p>
<p>The background is a rapidly changing continuumdecreas-
ing from amaximum intensity just after the plasmon peak
at about 15&ndash;25 eV, down to a minimum at which it is
indistinguishable from the system noise, typically at E &gt;
�2 keV. In addition to plural scattering, there is also the
possibility of single-scattering contributions to the back-
ground from the tails of preceding ionization edges and
perhaps contributions from the spectrometer itself.
Because of the complexity of these contributions, it has
not been possible to model the background from first
principles, as is possible in XEDS using Kramers&rsquo; law.
</p>
<p>Despite the complexity of the various contributions
to the background, the methods for subtraction are
relatively simple. There are two ways commonly used
to remove the background
</p>
<p>&amp; Curve fitting.
&amp; Using difference spectra.
</p>
<p>Curve Fitting: You select a window d in the back-
ground before the edge onset and fit a curve to the
intensity in the window. Then you extrapolate the
curve over another window D under the edge. This
process is shown schematically in Figure 39.9, and
experimentally in Figure 39.10.
</p>
<p>We assume that the energy dependence of the back-
ground has the form
</p>
<p>I &frac14; AE�r (39:10)
</p>
<p>where I is the intensity in the channel of energy loss E,
and A and r are constants. The fitting parameters are
only valid over a limited energy range because they
</p>
<p>depend on E. The exponent r is typically in the range
2&ndash;5, but A can vary tremendously. We can see some
trends in how r varies. The value of r decreases as
</p>
<p>&amp; The specimen thickness, t, increases.
&amp; The collection angle, b, increases.
&amp; The electron energy loss, E, increases.
</p>
<p>The fit of the curve to the tail of a preceding edge
shows a similar power-law dependence to the back-
ground, and may be fitted similarly, i.e., I = BE&ndash;S.
The fitting window d should not be &lt;10 channels and
should not be &gt;30% of EK. In practice, however, you
might not be able to fit the background over such a wide
window if another edge is present within that range,
which limits the goodness of fit of the curve.
</p>
<p>You should choose the extrapolation window, D,
such that the ratio of the finish to the start energies,
E(finish)/E(start), is&lt; 1.5; so D is smaller for lower edge
energies. Using larger windows, although improving the
statistics of the edge intensity, eventually reduces the
accuracy of the quantification because the fitting
parameters A and r are only valid over �100 eV. If
there&rsquo;s a lot of ELNES, either use a larger D to minimize
its effect or avoid it in the extrapolation window unless
the quantification routine can handle it.
</p>
<p>Instead of the simple power-law fit, you can in fact
use any expression, such as an exponential, polynomial,
or log-polynomial, so long as it provides a good fit to the
background and gives acceptable answers for known
specimens. Polynomial expressions can behave errati-
cally if you extrapolate them over a large D, so use them
cautiously. Generally, the power law seems adequate
for most purposes except close to the plasmon peaks
(E&lt;�100 eV). Clearly, the background channels closest

<p>to the edge onset will influence the extrapolation most
strongly, and various weighting schemes have been pro-
posed. A noisy spectrum will be particularly susceptible
to poor fitting, unless some type of weighting is used.
</p>
<p>We can judge the goodness of fit of a particular power-
law expression qualitatively by looking at the extrapola-
tion to ensure that it is heading toward the post-edge
background and not substantially under- or over-cutting
the spectrum. More quantitatively, we can assign a w2
</p>
<p>value based on a linear least-squares fit to the experimen-
tal spectrum. The least squares fit can be conveniently tied
in with a weighting scheme using the expression

<p>&eth;y� yi&THORN;2
y2
</p>
<p>(39:11)
</p>
<p>where yi is the number of counts in the ith channel and
y = lne I. (Look back at Section 35.3.B.) The squared
term in the denominator ensures suitable weighting of
the channels close to the edge. Alternatively, the Gatan
software includes &lsquo;smart&rsquo; feedback which forces the
background extrapolation to merge with the experimen-
tal background intensity well after the edge.
</p>
<p>Difference Spectra: You can also remove the back-
ground using a first-difference approach (which is
equivalent to differentiating the spectra). This method
is particularly suited to PEELS since it simply involves
taking two spectra, offset in energy by a few eV, and
subtracting one from the other. As shown inFigure 39.11,
</p>
<p>the difference process results in the slowly varying back-
ground being reduced to zero and the rapidly varying
ionization edge intensity showing up as classic differ-
ence peaks, similar to what you may have seen in Auger
spectra. This is the only way to remove the background
if your specimen thickness changes over the area of
analysis and it also has the advantage that it suppresses
spectral artifacts common to PEELS, particularly the
channel-to-channel gain variation.
</p>
<p>Another kind of difference method involves convo-
luting the experimental spectrum with a top-hat or simi-
lar filter function, as we described in Section 35.3 for
XEDS (Michel and Bonnet). Top-hat filtering effec-
tively gives a second-difference spectrum which also
removes the background but exacerbates some artifacts.
</p>
<p>Background subtraction for energy-filtered imaging
can be achieved in several ways.
</p>
<p>The first and most usual method of background
subtraction while filtering, is called the three-window
method (Jeanguillaume et al. 1978). Two pre-edge win-
dows are used to calculate the background fit and one
post-edge window in which the extrapolated back-
ground is subtracted from the total intensity to leave
the edge intensity (equivalent to adding another pre-
edge window in Figure 39.9). Egerton has shown that
the intensity in the background window under the edge
(Ib) is related to the intensity in the two pre-edge win-
dows (I1 and I2) by
</p>
<p>Ib &frac14; &frac12;A=&eth;1� r&THORN;�&frac12;E1�rh � E1�r1 � (39:12)
</p>
<p>where A and r are the usual factors in the background-
fitting equation (39.10) determined from I1 and I2 and
Eh and El are the high- and low-energy values defining
the extrapolation window under the edge. To factor out
the thickness effects, a low-loss image has to be acquired
and divided into the K edge image, as in equation 39.8.
Alternatively, two edges can be quantified and divided
to give relative quantitative images, as in the quantifica-
tion equation 39.9. Selection of the energy windows and
choice of their width are subject to all the limitations we
discussed for background subtraction and peak integra-
tion in that same section. Because the specimen thick-
ness will often vary over the area being imaged, this
method must be applied at every pixel in the image.
</p>
<p>FITTING WINDOWS
There are two fitting windows: d before the edge and
D after the edge. Each has constraints for good back-
ground fitting.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The second method that is the commonly used
method is to simply divide the signal in the edge by the
signal in a background window just preceding the edge.
These so-called jump-ratio images are only qualitative
but give useful information, as we&rsquo;ll see in Section 39.9.
</p>
<p>The third background-subtraction approach often
used in ETEM imaging is the maximum-likelihood
method (Unser et al.), which is useful when only a few
channels are available for estimating the background
and the peak intensity.
</p>
<p>Kothleiner and Hofer describe the various param-
eters that control your choice of the best three windows.
In general, many of the considerations for the selection
of d and D for spectral acquisition also apply during
imaging.
</p>
<p>39.4.C Edge Integration
</p>
<p>The edge integration procedure you use depends on how
you removed the background. If you used a power-law
approach, then remember that there is a limit over
which the edge integration window D is valid. The
value of D should be large enough to maximize the
integrated intensity, but not so large that the errors in
your background extrapolation dominate. Often the
presence of another edge limits the upper end of the
integration window. The lower end is usually defined
from the edge onset, EK, but if there is strong (well
defined) near-edge structure, such as in the B K edge
or the Ca L23 edge, then your integration window
should start at an energy above these, unless the quanti-
fication schemes can handle ELNES (see below). If you
subtracted the background using a first-difference
approach, then you determine the peak intensity by
fitting the experimental spectrum to a reference spec-
trum from a known standard using multiple least-
squares fitting. We&rsquo;ll talk more about this when we
discuss deconvolution of spectra.
</p>
<p>39.4.D The Partial Ionization Cross Section
</p>
<p>There are several ways we can determine the partial
ionization cross section, s(bD). We either use a theoret-
ical approach or compare the experimental spectra with
known standard spectra.
</p>
<p>Theoretical calculation: Themost common approach
is that due to Egerton (the 1979 and 1981 papers) who
produced two short computer programs to model the K
</p>
<p>and L shell partial cross sections. The programs are
called SIGMAK and SIGMAL, respectively. They are
public-domain software, have been updated regularly,
and are stored in your EELS computer system. They are
standard parts of the Gatan software. The codes are
given in the appendices of Egerton&rsquo;s book. The cross
sections are modeled by approximating the atom in
question to an isolated hydrogen atom with a charge
on the nucleus equal to the atomic number Z of the
atom, but with no outer-shell electrons.
</p>
<p>At first sight, this so-called hydrogenic cross section is
an absurd approximation! The approach is actually tract-
able because the hydrogen-atom wave function can be
expressed analytically by Schrödinger&rsquo;s wave equation,
which can be modified to account for the increased
charge on atoms above hydrogen. Because this treatment
neglects the outer-shell electrons, it is best suited to K
shell electrons. Figure 39.12 shows comparison between
the measured nitrogen-K intensity and that computed
using SIGMAK. As you can see, the SIGMAK hydro-
genic model essentially ignores the near-edge and post-
edge fine structure (which would be absent in the spec-
trum from a hydrogen atom), but still gives a reasonably
good fit to the experimental edge. Figure 39.13 compares
the Cr L edge with the SIGMAKmodel. The L shell fit is
almost as good as the K fit, although the white lines are
imperfectly modeled. These programs are very widely
used since they are simple to understand and easy and
quick to apply. An alternative approach uses empirical
parameterized equations to modify s for the effects of b
and D; Egerton gives the appropriate codes which you
can also download from URL #2.
</p>
<p>There are more complex methods which calculate
the cross section in a more realistic way than the
</p>
<p>METHODS FOR BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION
The three-window method: use two pre-edge win-
dows to calculate a background.
The jump ratio: calculate by dividing two signals.
Maximum-likelihood: when you only have a few
channels to use for the subtraction.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 39.12. Comparison between an experimental N-K edge and a
</p>

<p>under the fit is still a close approximation to the area under the experi-
</p>
<p>mental edge.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>SIGMAK/L hydrogenicmodels, e.g., using theHartree-
Slater model which is available in the Gatan software or
atomic-physics approaches which are better for the
more complex L and M (and even N) edges (see papers
by Rez and Hofer et al.). Egerton has compared experi-
mental and theoretical cross sections; the M shell data
(which are the worst case) are shown in Figure 39.14.
The data are actually plotted in terms of the oscillator
strength g (which is a measure of the response of the
atom to the incident electron). This term is the integral
of the generalized oscillator strength (GOS), which is
proportional to the differential cross section, so just
think of g as being proportional to s. There is still
relatively poor agreement between experiment and the-
ory for theM shell. Note that themodels in Figure 39.14
are all atomic rather than hydrogenic. Similar data in
Egerton&rsquo;s paper show better agreement for K and L
shells. These models, while more precise, require sub-
stantially longer computing time but this is fast becom-
ing less of a problem. Given the other sources of error in
EELS analysis, you rarely need to go to such lengths to
obtain a better value of s(bD) and, unless you are well
versed in the physics of ionization cross sections, you
should probably stick with the SIGMAK/L methods,
particularly for routine quantification.
</p>
<p>Experimental Determination: Rather than calculat-
ing s theoretically, you can generate a value experimen-
tally using known standards. This approach is of course
exactly analogous to the experimental k-factor
approach for XEDS quantification in which the cross
section is automatically included (along with the fluor-
escence yield and other factors). It is surprising at first
sight that the classic XEDS approach of using standards
has not been widely used in EELS, but the reason is
obvious when you remember the large number of vari-
ables that affect the EELS data. The standard and
</p>
<p>unknownmust have the same thickness, the same bond-
ing characteristic, and the spectra must be gathered
under identical conditions; in particular b, D, E0, and t
must be the same. So your standard would basically be
your unknown!
</p>
<p>Again, it is the problem of thickness measurement
that appears to be the main limitation to improving the
accuracy of analysis.
</p>
<p>In summary, there are two approaches to the deter-
mination of s(bD): theoretical calculation and experi-
mental measurement. In contrast to XEDS, the
theoretical approaches dominate. There is good evidence
that, particularly for the lighter elements, for which
EELS is best suited, the simple and quick hydrogenic
model is usually adequate. However, for the heavier ele-
ments, where theM shell is used for analysis, the calcula-
tions are getting better although for such elements, it&rsquo;s
still probably better to revert to X-ray analysis. Leapman
has given a lucid and much more detailed description of
the variousmethods of background subtraction and peak
integration necessary for quantification.
</p>
<p>One last point worth noting is that, before carrying
out an experiment or gathering a long spectrum image
for quantification, it is worth simulating the spectra to
see if the experiment will produce useful data. We

<p>described the advantages of DTSA for similar aspects of
XEDS data in Chapter 33 and the companion text
chapter. Gatan offers the EELS Advisor software
(URL #3) to help take the uncertainty out of your
planned experiment. Like DTSA, the EELS advisor
allows you to simulate both spectra and images and
will let you know if the element you seek will be detect-
able under your planned experimental conditions. It
may tell you that the specimen is too thick or the
amount of the element is below the detection or spatial
resolution limits and that you need to change one or
more of the many experimental variables that you have
at your disposal.
</p>
<p>39.5 MEASURING THICKNESS
FROM THE CORE-LOSS SPECTRUM
</p>
<p>While you may think we&rsquo;re now in a position where we
have all the data needed to solve the quantification
equations 39.8 and 39.9, our assumption all along has
been that the spectra were the result of single scattering
and we neglected plural scattering. In practice, there will
always be some plural-scattering contribution to the
ionization edges.
</p>
<p>This effect is shown schematically back in Figure
39.2E. So how do we go about correcting this? We can
either make our specimens so thin that plural scattering
is negligible or we can deconvolute the spectra. The
former approach is better but sometimes unrealistic.
The latter approach is mathematically simple but, as
we&rsquo;ve taken pains to point out on several occasions,
deconvolution can be misleading and create spectral
artifacts if not done properly; so we need to examine
deconvolution in more detail. First, let&rsquo;s look at how we
determine t because EELS offers us a simple method for
this.
</p>
<p>We saw back in Section 38.3.C that the plasmon-
peak intensity is ameasure of the specimen thickness but
there is also thickness information in any energy-loss
spectrum since the total amount of inelastic scatter
increases with specimen thickness. So we can write a
parallel expression to equation 38.7
</p>
<p>t &frac14; l ln It
I0
</p>
<p>(39:13)
</p>
<p>where I0 is the ZLP intensity, It is the total intensity in
the low-loss spectrum out to 50 eV, including I0 (as
shown in Figure 39.15) and l is the average mean free
path for these low-energy losses. We ignore any inten-
sity above�50 eV because, even though that&rsquo;s where all
the interesting ionization edges are, it is a negligible
fraction of It (as is apparent if you go back and look at
Figure 37.1). To determine l in equation 39.13, we use
a parameterization based on many experimental mea-
surements (Malis et al.)
</p>
<p>l &frac14; 106F&eth;E0=Em&THORN;
ln&eth;2bE0=Em&THORN;
</p>
<p>(39:14)
</p>
<p>where l is in nm, E0 in keV, b in mrad, F is a relativistic
correction factor, and Em is the average energy loss in
eV which, for a material of average atomic number Z, is
given by
</p>
<p>Em &frac14; 7:6Z 0:36 (39:15)
</p>
<p>The relativistic factor (F) is given by
</p>
<p>F &frac14; 1&thorn; E0=1022
&eth;1&thorn; E0=511&THORN;2
</p>
<p>(3:16)
</p>
<p>You can easily store these equations in the TEM com-
puter or in your calculator and they give t with an
accuracy of ��20 % so long as the b is &lt; �15 mrads
at 100 keV. In addition to this and the plasmon-peak-
intensity approach, there are othermethods (in Egerton&rsquo;s
book) for determining thickness from various aspects of
the EEL spectrum, but Malis&rsquo; parameterization method
is by far the most widely used. From what you&rsquo;ve
learned so far it should be obvious that if you can
determine a thickness by comparing the intensity in two

<p>regions of the spectrum, we can just as easily form an
image from each of the two intensities in equation 39.13,
and thus extract a thickness image as we did for XEDS in
Figure 36.13C.
</p>
<p>You may find that, when you measure t, Murphy&rsquo;s
law is operating and the area you&rsquo;re interested in is too
thick for quantitative core-loss analysis. Then you&rsquo;ll
have to deconvolute the spectra to make the single-
scattering assumption valid.
</p>
<p>39.6 DECONVOLUTION
</p>
<p>We saw back in Figure 39.2 that the plural scattering
adds intensity to the ionization edge, mainly as a result
of combined inner (ionization) and outer-shell (plas-
mon) losses.
</p>
<p>We can approximate the experimental ionization
edge as a true single-scattering (hydrogenic) edge con-
voluted with the plasmon, or low-loss, spectrum.
</p>
<p>The aim of deconvolution therefore, as shown sche-
matically in Figure 39.16, is to extract the single-scatter-
ing contribution from the plural-scattering intensity in
the spectrum. We&rsquo;ll describe two methods, the Fourier-
Log and the Fourier-Ratio, both developed in Egerton&rsquo;s
book and available for download at URL #1. Both
methods are also incorporated in the Gatan software.
Using a small b increases the deconvolution error since
the plural-scattered electrons have a wide angular distri-
bution and so more of them are excluded as b decreases.
</p>
<p>The Fourier-Log method removes the effects of plural
scattering from the whole spectrum. The technique
describes the spectrum in terms of the sum of individual
scattering components, i.e., the zero loss (elastic contri-
bution) plus the single-scattering spectrum plus the dou-
ble-scattering spectrum, etc. Each term is convoluted
</p>
<p>with the instrument response function, which is a mea-
sure of how much the spectrometer degrades the gener-
ated spectrum; in the case of a PEELS, this is the point-
spread functionwe described in Section 37.5. TheFourier
transform of the whole spectrum (F) is then given by
</p>
<p>F &frac14; F&eth;0&THORN; exp F&eth;E&THORN;
I0
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>(39:17)
</p>
<p>where F(0) is the transform of the elastic contribution,
F(E) is the single-scattering transform and I0 is the zero-
loss intensity. So to get the single-scattering transform
you take logarithms of both sides, hence, the name of
the technique.
</p>
<p>Extracting the single-scattering spectrum would
ideally involve an inverse transformation of F(E), but
this results in too much noise in the spectrum. There are
various ways around this problem, the simplest of which
is to approximate the zero-loss peak to a delta function.
After deconvolution, you can subtract the background
in the usual way, prior to quantification.
</p>
<p>The danger of any deconvolution is that you may
introduce artifacts into the single-scattering spectrum,
e.g., from artifacts in the original spectrum. Despite the

<p>DECONVOLUTION METHODS
The Fourier-Log method: deconvolute then subtract
background.
The Fourier-Ratio technique: subtract background
then deconvolute.
Multiple least-squares fitting: when the specimen is
not uniformly thin.
All three methods are approximations.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>assumptions and approximations, the net result of
deconvolution is often an increase in the ionization-
edge jump ratio. This improvement is important when
you are attempting to detect small ionization edges from
trace elements, or the presence of edges in spectra from
thick specimens. An example of Fourier-Log deconvo-
lution is shown in Figure 39.17.
</p>
<p>The Fourier-Ratio technique: This approach approx-
imates the experimental spectrum to the ideal single-
scattering spectrum F(E), convoluted with the low-loss
spectrum. We define the low-loss portion of the spec-
trum as the region up to�50 eV, including the ZLP, but
before the appearance of any ionization edges. So we
can now write
</p>
<p>F 0 &frac14; F&eth;E&THORN; � F&eth;P&THORN; (39:18)
</p>
<p>where F 0 is the Fourier transform of the experimental
intensity distribution around the ionization edge and
F(P) is the Fourier transform of the low-loss (mainly
plasmon) spectrum. In this equation, therefore, the
instrument response is approximated by the low-loss
spectrum rather than the ZLP. If we rearrange equation
39.18 to give a ratio (hence the name of the technique)
</p>
<p>F&eth;E&THORN; &frac14;
F 0
</p>
<p>F&eth;P&THORN;
(39:19)
</p>
<p>We now obtain the single-scattering distribution by
carrying out an inverse transformation. In contrast to
the Fourier-Log technique, you must subtract the
background intensity before deconvolution. Again, to
avoid the problem of increased noise, it is necessary to
multiply equation 39.19 by the transform of the ZLP.
</p>
<p>Figure 39.18 shows a carbonK edge after Fourier-Ratio
deconvolution.
</p>
<p>Multiple least-squares fitting: If your specimen is not
uniformly thin, Fourier techniques won&rsquo;t work. Then
you should use multiple least-squares (MLS) fitting of
convoluted standard reference spectra (Leapman 2004).
A single-scattering reference spectrum R0(E) in the
region of the edge to be quantified is convoluted with
the first plasmon-loss portion of the unknown spectrum
(P) and the resultant spectrumR1(E)=P*R0(E) is used
to generate several reference spectra (R2(E)=P*R1(E),
etc.). These reference spectra are then fitted to the
experimental spectrum using MLS routines and specific
fitting parameters are obtained. An experimental set of
Fe, Co, and Cu reference spectra is shown in Figure
39.19A and the actual fit to part of the experimental
spectrum from an intermetallic in a Cu-Be-Co alloy is
shown in Figure 39.19B.
</p>
<p>In summary, to quantify ionization-loss spectra you
need a single-scattering spectrum, which can be
approximated if you have very thin specimens or gener-
ated by deconvolution of your experimental spectrum.
It is arguable that, given the stringency of the single
approximation, it might be wise to deconvolute all
core-loss spectra prior to quantification, but the uncer-
tain effects of the possible errors introduced by decon-
volution mean that you should do this cautiously. Often
you&rsquo;ll find it useful to deconvolute the point-spread
junction from all PEELS spectra, since this sharpens
the edge onset and any ELNES intensity variations.

<p>39.7 CORRECTION FOR CONVERGENCE
OF THE INCIDENT BEAM
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re working in STEM mode to get high spatial
resolution, then it is possible that the beam-convergence
angle a may introduce an error into your quantification.
When a is equal to or greater than b, convergence
effects can limit the accuracy because the experimental
angular distribution of scattered electrons will be wider
than expected (yet again, a good reason to know b).
Therefore, you have to convolute the angular distribution
of the ionization-loss electrons with the beam convergence
angle. Joy (1986b) proposed handling this through a sim-
ple equationwhich calculates the effective reduction (R) in
the partial cross section s(bD) when a &gt; b.

</p>
<p>where yE is the characteristic scattering angle. A similar
reduction factor is incorporated in the Gatan software
quantification routines. So you can see that if a is small
(particularly if it is smaller than b) then R is &lt;&lt;1 and
the effect of beam convergence is negligible. Generally,
with the typical range of probe-limiting apertures in a
STEM, convergence angles should not be larger than
5&ndash;10 mrads so it should always be feasible to make sure
that b is large enough. However, a note of caution is
worthwhile because, with Cs correction, it is now possi-
ble to use much larger convergence angles to increase
the probe current without degrading the probe size.
</p>
<p>39.8 THE EFFECT OF THE SPECIMEN
ORIENTATION
</p>
<p>In crystalline specimens, diffraction may influence the
intensity of the ionization edge. This effect may be
particularly large if your specimen is oriented close to
strong two-beam conditions and, as we saw back in
Chapter 35, this can be used to good effect in
ALCHEMI. Both X-ray emission and ionization-loss
intensity can change because of electron channeling
effects close to the Bragg condition. At the Bragg con-
dition, the degree of beam-specimen interaction
increases, compared with zone-axis illumination where
no strong scatter occurs and the energy-loss processes
behave similarly. This phenomenon (known as the Borr-
mann effect in XEDS) is not important for low-energy
edges, but intensity changes of a factor of 2 have been
reported for Al and Mg K edges (Taft&oslash; and Krivanek).
The use of large aminimizes the problem in XEDS, but
beam-convergence effects are themselves a problem in
EELS as we just described. Unless you&rsquo;re an alchemist,
the easiest way to avoid orientation effects is simply to
operate under kinematical conditions and stay well
away from any bend centers or bend contours, just as
in XEDS.
</p>
<p>39.9 EFTEM IMAGING WITH IONIZATION
EDGES
</p>
<p>There are countless examples of EELS analyses using
ionization-loss edges in the general references that we
have given at the end of this and the other EELS chap-
ters. As we described back in Section 37.8, you have
several experimental options such as point analyses,
spectrum-line profiles, and various forms of energy-fil-
tered TEM imaging. By far the most powerful method
of analysis, as with XEDS, is to form EFTEM images.
You can either select a given edge from which to form a
single image or you can gather a spectrum image and
select the specific energy later. The former method is the
norm for in-column filters while the latter is more

<p>common for post-column GIFs. We&rsquo;ll look at both but
refer you to the 1995 text on the subject by Reimer for
more theoretical and practical details and the review by
Hofer and Warbichler for many illustrative examples.
You can also image portions of the fine structure in the
edge as we&rsquo;ll show in the next chapter, but here we will
emphasize the power of ionization-loss analysis with
reference to elemental images only. It is good to draw
comparisons with what can be achieved with elemental
imaging with XEDS, as we described back in Chapters
32&ndash;35.
</p>
<p>39.9.A Qualitative Imaging
</p>
<p>EFTEM images using the intensity in ionization edges
will obviously correspond to elemental maps. The sim-
plest way to get this information is to subtract a pre-edge
background image from a post-edge image; this two-
window subtraction method gives a passable qualitative
elemental distribution. Alternatively, you can just ratio
images of pre- and post-edge windows then what you get
is called a jump-ratio image (see Figure 39.20B and C)
which, again, is not quantitative and the intensity just
reflects the edge to background ratio. Obviously, both
of these qualitative methods will work best if (i) the
jump ratio is high, (ii) the edge intensity is clearly visible
above the background, and (iii) both thickness and
diffraction conditions remain reasonably constant
</p>
<p>across the mapped region. Otherwise, the interpretation
of any intensity changes is fraught with danger and
artifacts abound. In fact, unless your specimen is very
thin (t � 0.1 l) it&rsquo;s probably not worth bothering with
this qualitative approach and you may as well spend
your time forming quantitative EFTEM images.
</p>
<p>39.9.B Quantitative Imaging
</p>
<p>If, at each pixel, we carry out a background subtraction,
an edge integration, and multiply the resulting intensity
by the partial ionization cross section ratio, we should
get quantitative images of the distribution of specific
elements. There isn&rsquo;t too much difference, in principle,
between quantifying a spectrum as we&rsquo;ve just described
in equations 39.8 and 39.9 and forming an image. The
main difference is in fact in the method of background
subtraction, which we&rsquo;ve also described already in
Section 39.4.B.
</p>
<p>The most commonmethod for quantitative EFTEM
imaging involves acquiring three images from electrons
in selected energy windows: two from the background
preceding the edge and one from under the edge as we&rsquo;ve
already described. This approach works equally well for
an in-column filter or for a post-column GIF; you can
either operate in TEM mode and acquire three images
or operate in STEM mode and choose whether you
select just the three energy windows or gather a full
spectrum image. The only difference is that the TEM
images can be acquired in a few seconds while the STEM
approach may require minutes or even hours and is
probably only worth doing if you are acquiring a full
spectrum image. Figure 39.20 shows ratio images and
fully quantitative images pulled out of a spectrum-
image data cube.
</p>
<p>In both instruments, to form a specific filtered
image, you shift the energy spectrum until the desired
energy window passes through the energy-selecting slit
(see the schematic diagrams in Figures 37.13 and 37.15).
The energy shift is actually achieved by changing the
accelerating voltage of the TEM so that electrons of
different energies stay on-axis and thus in focus through
the spectrometer. The quality of your images is gov-
erned by the same factors that control the spectrum:
good jump ratios to get good signals, well-separated
peaks to ensure good background-fitting statistics, and
a good thin specimen to permit valid quantification
under single-scattering conditions. Once acquired,
your filtered images can be subject to advanced post-
specimen processing, such as pixel-clustering methods
(Cutrona et al.) or the standard methods, such as color
assignments for different elements, as shown back in
Figure 37.17D. If you&rsquo;re at all uncertain about whether
the experiment will work, remember to simulate it first,
using the EELS Advisor software (URL #2).

<p>EFTEM imaging will only continue to improve as all
the instrumental factors that we have already discussed
become common. We will have Cs correction, mono-
chromation, and better spectrometers with more uni-
form transmissivity achieved via higher-order
aberration correction.
</p>
<p>39.10 SPATIAL RESOLUTION:
ATOMIC-COLUMN EELS
</p>
<p>In contrast to the situation in XEDS, beam spreading is
not a major factor in determining the source of the
EELS signal and so the many factors that influence
beam spreading are mainly irrelevant. The spectrometer
only collects those electrons emanating from the speci-
men in a narrow cone, as shown in Figure 39.21 There-
fore, energy-loss electrons that are elastically scattered
through large angles are excluded from contributing to
your spectrum. Remember that for XEDS these same
high-angle electrons would still generate X-rays some
distance from the incident-probe position, and these
X-rays would be detected by XEDS. In the absence of
a contribution from beam spreading, the spatial resolu-
tion of ionization-loss spectrometry depends on the
mode of analysis
</p>
<p>&amp; The factor controlling the resolution in STEM
mode, or in a probe-forming (diffraction) mode on
a TEM, is mainly the size of the probe; because of the
strong forward-scattered signal, we can easily get
</p>
<p>data with probe sizes &lt; 0.2 nm and with aberration
correction we can break the Ångstrom barrier.
</p>
<p>&amp; When we operate in TEM mode, the spatial resolu-
tion is a function of the selecting aperture, i.e., the
spectrometer entrance aperture and its effective size
at the plane of the specimen. Lens aberrations
usually limit the spatial resolution, as we showed
back in Section 37.4.C.
</p>
<p>In addition to the usual factors affecting the probe
size, such as the diffraction limit and lens aberrations
(go back and read Chapter 5), another factor that we
have to consider in EELS, but ignore in XEDS
(although it occurs in X-ray generation also) is the
phenomenon of delocalization.
</p>
<p>The scale of this wave-mechanical effect is inversely
proportional to the energy loss over dimensions of a few
nm (which, of course, is very large if you&rsquo;re worried
about atomic-level spatial resolution). Egerton gives
the following simplified expression for the diameter
(d50) containing 50% of the inelastic intensity

</p>
<p>where you should recognize all the terms and yet again
appreciate the importance of knowing your collection
angle. This expression gives a localization of �1 nm for
E = 50 eV and 0.4 nm for E^ 300 V (C edge K) and
might therefore appear to prevent atomic-resolution
EELS. Fortunately, delocalization does not appear to
be a factor in STEM images of single, isolated atoms
and resolution appears to be primarily determined by
the width of the probe, even for light atoms. So it
appears that the usual factors, such as probe aberra-
tions, signal to background in the EELS signal, and
damage are much more important in terms of EELS
spatial resolution. All the experimental evidence seems
to agree with the secondary role for delocalization in
that HAADF imaging of single atoms has been long
established (see Section 22.4 and the companion text);
atomic-level changes in chemistry were first demon-
strated by ionization loss in the early 1990s (Browning
et al. and Batson). The same process that confines the
electron beam to channel along the atomic columns in
HAADF imaging also means that the spectroscopic

</p>
<p>ensuring high spatial resolution. In contrast, X-rays can be detected from
</p>
<p>the whole beam-specimen interaction volume.
</p>
<p>DELOCALIZATION IN EELS
Delocalization is the ejection of an inner-shell elec-
tron by the passage of a high-energy electron some
distance from the atom. It&rsquo;s as if the beam electron
scares the core-shell electron sufficiently to eject it
without actually laying a finger on it!

<p>signal is similarly localized. Because the EELS intensi-
ties are so much higher than XEDS, we are able to
extract EELS spectra which contain information from
a single atomic column, as shown in Figure 39.22). Both
the Ti andMn integrated signals in Figure 39.22C show
an approximate decrease of 50% (or higher) within an
atomic plane of the interface indicating true atomic-
level resolution.
</p>
<p>It is possible even to detect the presence of single
atoms of high-Z elements on individual atomic columns
of lower-Z elements (see next section) and Cs correction
now makes atomic-resolution EELS almost straightfor-
ward (Varela et al.)
</p>
<p>39.11 DETECTION LIMITS
</p>
<p>The detection limits for ionization-loss spectrometry are
governed by the same factors as we discussed for XEDS,
so we have to optimize several factors
</p>
<p>&amp; The edge intensity.
&amp; The signal to background ratio (jump ratio).
&amp; The efficiency of signal detection.
&amp; The time of analysis.
</p>
<p>As is obvious in Figure 39.21, EELS has an inher-
ently higher signal collection efficiency than XEDS.
Conversely, as we&rsquo;ve seen, it also has a correspondingly
poorer signal to background because of the higher
plural scattering. But, as for the best spatial resolution,
more signal wins in the end. Leapman and Hunt argued
in 1991 that, in most situations, PEELS is more sensitive
to the presence of small amounts of material than
XEDS. This has been borne out in experimental studies
over many years and the latest improvements in FEG
sources, Cs correction, and spectrometer hardware have
brought us to the point where combined imaging and
spectroscopic analysis (including fine structure and
associated electronic effects) of single atoms is achiev-
able. Figure 39.23 shows single-atom analytical sensi-
tivity with atomic-level spatial resolution. So while, in
principle, the inverse relationship between analytical
sensitivity and spatial resolution that we described for
XEDS in Figure 36.11 applies, when you&rsquo;re able to
detect single atoms with atomic resolution you&rsquo;ve just
about reached the fundamental limit of any analytical
technique.
</p>
<p>Conclusion: analysis using ionization edges offers both
atomic-resolution spatial resolution and single-atom
analytical sensitivity.

<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
The ionization edges can be used to give quantitative elemental analyses and quantitative
images from all the elements in the periodic table, using a simple ratio equation. Beware,
however, of the many experimental variables you have to define for your TEM, PEELS,
energy filter, and (most importantly) your very thin specimen. Compared to XEDS there
have been relatively few quantitative analyses or composition profiles measured using
EELS, but quantitative imaging is becoming much more common.
</p>
<p>To use Egerton&rsquo;s ratio equation you have to
</p>
<p>&amp; Subtract the background using a power law, or MLS approach. The former is easier.
The latter is better for complex spectra.
</p>
<p>&amp; Integrate the edge intensity. That&rsquo;s usually straightforward.
&amp; Determine the partial ionization cross sectionsK(bD). CalculatesK(bD) with SIGMAK
and SIGMAL for most K and L edges.
</p>
<p>&amp; For M edges use a known standard or, better still, use XEDS.
&amp; For the lightest elements (e.g., Li) use a known standard.
</p>
<p>The biggest limitation to quantification is that your specimens have to be much thinner
than one mean free path (typically&lt;&lt; 50 nm) otherwise deconvolution routines are needed,
which can introduce artifacts of their own.
</p>
<p>Ionization-loss imaging is becoming widespread because of the increased availability of
in-column and post-column filters and is the recommended method for quantitative
analysis.
</p>
<p>Spatial resolution andminimum detection are better than for XEDS. Combined atomic-
column resolution and single-atom detection has been demonstrated.

<p>Fine Structure and Finer Details
</p>
<p>CHAPTER PREVIEW
</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we described elemental analysis using ionization edges, but there is
much more than just elemental information in the ionization edges and this distinguishes
EELS from XEDS. There are detailed intensity variations in the core-loss spectra called
energy-loss near-edge structure (ELNES) and extended energy-loss fine structure
(EXELFS). From this fine structure, which we can resolve because of the high-energy
resolution inherent in EELS, we can obtain data on how the ionized atom is bonded, the
coordination of that specific atom, and its density of states. As always, we can use any
intensity changes to create filtered images which show the distribution of, e.g., regions of
different bonding states. Furthermore, we can probe the distribution of other atoms around
the ionized atom (i.e., determine the radial-distribution function (RDF) which is very useful
for the study of amorphous materials) and we can study momentum-resolved EELS,
observe the anisotropy of chemical bonds, combine EELS with tomography, inter alia.
Understanding these phenomena often requires that we use certain concepts from atomic
and quantum physics. The non-physicist can skip some sections at this time and just
concentrate on the results. The rewards of working through this topic will be an apprecia-
tion of some of the more powerful aspects of EELS.
</p>
<p>This fine structure is all the more useful because we now have the ability to simulate the
spectra using atomic-structure calculations, which help us understand the details in the
spectra. A full appreciation of the calculations is beyond the scope of the book but this is a
growing field that will only assume more significance.
</p>
<p>As a wrap-up to EELS and the book as a whole, we&rsquo;ll finish by saying a few words on
some of the more esoteric aspects of TEM, such as angular-resolved spectrometry, radial-
distribution-function determination, Compton scattering, core-level shifts, and tomo-
graphic EELS that are not yet in the mainstream but, with continuing advances in instru-
mentation and computation, will surely grow in importance.
</p>
<p>40.1 WHY DOES FINE STRUCTURE
OCCUR?
</p>
<p>We saw in Section 39.1 that the ionization edges have
intensity variations superimposed on the ideal hydro-
genic sawtooth shape. The stronger oscillations occur
within about 30&ndash;50 eV of the onset of the edge (ELNES)
and the weaker ones extend out for several hundred eV
as the edge intensity diminishes (EXELFS). This fine
structure contains a wealth of useful information, but to
</p>
<p>understand its origins you have to use some ideas from
quantum physics.
</p>
<p>One way we can look at this process is to switch from
a particle to a wave model of the electron, as we&rsquo;ve done
before, e.g., when we talked about diffraction in Part 2.
Then we can imagine that any excess energy (&gt;Ec) that
the ejected electron possesses is a wave emanating from
the ionized atom. Now, if this wave has only a few eV of
excess energy, it undergoes plural, elastic scattering
from the surrounding atoms, as shown schematically
</p>
<p>WHY LOOK AT FINE STRUCTURE ?
If high spatial resolution is important, you can&rsquo;t obtain this additional information by
any other spectroscopic technique.
</p>
<p>40 .1 WHY DOES F INE STRUCTURE OCCUR ? ........................................................................................................................................ 741</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>in Figure 40.1A, and this scattering is responsible for the
ELNES, as we&rsquo;ll show. If the wave has even more excess
energy, then, because of the smaller interaction cross
section for higher-energy electrons (as we&rsquo;ve already
seen many times) it is less likely to be scattered by the
surrounding atoms. In fact, we can approximate the
cause of the ELNES to a single-scattering event, as
shown in Figure 40.1B. Thus, EXELFS and ELNES
can be viewed as a continuum of electron-scattering
phenomena, with the arbitrary distinction that ELNES
is confined to a few tens of eV past the edge onset while
EXELFS extends for several hundred eV past the edge
onset. There are other ways to explain fine structure and
we&rsquo;ll mention some of these later when we talk about
modeling the phenomena.
</p>
<p>You should know that similar fine-structure effects
can occur in X-ray spectra, but are usually not resolva-
ble in the TEM because of the poor resolution of the
semiconductor XEDS detector. However, we did note
that experimental high-resolution X-ray detectors can
resolve bonding effects in terms of shifts in X-ray peaks
(see Figure 32.9C). In fact, there is a whole field of X-ray
spectrometry that is used for studying atomic bonding
(X-ray absorption near-edge structure or XANES) and
atom positions and structure (extendedX-ray absorption
</p>
<p>fine structure orEXAFS). These techniques are analogous
to ELNES and EXELFS, but require a synchrotron
to generate sufficient signal. This is one of the few
examples where TEM is the cheaper characterization
technique.
</p>
<p>Most of this chapter deals with the experimental
measurement and basic theoretical simulation of
ELNES and EXELFS; the information we give is aug-
mented in the companion text. While ELNES arises
from plural scattering and is thus a more complex pro-
cess than EXELFS, it is much more widely used,
because it gives a more intense signal and the informa-
tion it reveals has been used to study a very wide range
of materials. So we&rsquo;ll discuss ELNES first.
</p>
<p>40.2 ELNES PHYSICS
</p>
<p>40.2.A Principles
</p>
<p>As you know well, when an atom is ionized, it is raised
from its ground state to an excited state leaving a hole in
an inner shell. The core electron must receive enough
energy from the beam electron to be ejected from its
shell, but it may not receive enough to escape to the
vacuum level. So it is still not completely free of the
Coulomb attraction to the nucleus. In such circum-
stances, the final state of the core electron will be in
one of a range of possible energy levels above the
Fermi energy (EF). You may recall that the Fermi level
(or the Fermi surface in three dimensions) is the bound-
ary between the filled states and the unfilled states in the
weakly bound conduction/valence bands (although,
strictly speaking, this statement is only true when
T &frac14; 0 K). In a metal, there is no separate valence band
and EF sits somewhere in the conduction band, as shown
schematically in the classic energy level diagram of an
atom in Figure 40.2. In an insulator or a semiconductor,
EF is between the valence band (in which all the states
are filled) and the conduction band (which has no filled
states). The possible energy values that can be imparted
to the ejected electron are controlled by the energy
distribution of these unfilled states and, therefore, the
energy lost by the incident electron similarly reflects this
distribution of the unfilled states. One philosophical
point of quantum uncertainty is that these states
don&rsquo;t exist until an electron appears in them, but we&rsquo;ll
conveniently ignore this.
</p>
<p>So, the excited electron can reside in any of the
unfilled states, but what&rsquo;s crucial here is that there is
not an equal probability of the electron ending up in
each possible unfilled state. Some empty states are more
likely to be filled than others because there are more
states within certain energy ranges than in others. This
uneven distribution of empty energy levels is termed the
density of (unfilled) states (DOS) and this is also shown
</p>
<p>ELNES AND EXELFS I
Both arise because the ionization process can impart
more than the critical ionization energy (Ec) needed
by the core electron to be ejected from its inner shell.

<p>above the Fermi level creates a wave radiating from the ionized atom and
</p>
<p>is scattered by surrounding atoms. The low-energy ELNES arises from
</p>
<p>plural scatter and is affected by the bonding between the atoms. The
</p>
<p>higher-energy EXELFS approximates to single scatter and is affected by
</p>
<p>the local atomic arrangement.

<p>in Figure 40.2. Because of the greater probability of
electrons filling certain unoccupied states above EF,
the ELNES intensity is greater at the energy losses
corresponding to these high DOS regions above the
Fermi energy (which can be thought of as equivalent
to the critical ionization energy EC), as shown in
Figure 40.3.
</p>
<p>The importance of ELNES is that the DOS is ex-
tremely sensitive to changes in the bonding or the
valence state of the atom. For example, if you look
ahead to Figure 40.5, the carbon K ELNES is different
for graphite, diamond, and buckyballs and the Cu L
ELNES changes when Cu is oxidized to CuO. On an
even more detailed level, we can even deduce the coor-
dination of the ionized atom from the shape of the
ELNES.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We discuss this fingerprinting approach in Section
40.2.D below and you can check it in the EELS Atlas or
at URL #1. Remember, we did exactly the same type of
fingerprinting of different phases with the low-loss spec-
tra in Section 38.3.A.
</p>
<p>40.2.B White Lines
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most startling example of ELNES is the
presence of the white lines, which we first saw inChapter
39; these lines are intense sharp peaks on certain ioniza-
tion edges. These sharp peaks arise because in certain
elements the core electrons are excited into well-defined
empty states, not a broad continuum, as in Figure 40.3.
The L2,3 edges of the transitionmetals and theM4,5 edges
of the rare-earth elements show such lines. The white
lines in the Fe L edge are the L3 and L2 edges, respec-
tively, as shown in Figure 40.4, and these specific lines
arise because the d shell has unfilled states. (We&rsquo;ll explain
what happened to L1 later.) To explain these lines we
need a little more quantum physics, which you can skip if
youwish and go to the last paragraph of this section.You
should also be aware that there is disagreement as to
whether white lines are truly fine structure or strictly
ionization edge (atomic) intensity; but we&rsquo;ll leave this
somewhat arcane discussion to those who know better
(another cause of fracas in bars at M&amp;M meetings).
</p>
<p>40.2.C Quantum Aspects
</p>
<p>First, remember that the various electron energy levels,
K, L, M, etc., correspond to principal quantum num-
bers (n) equal to 1, 2, 3, etc. Within those energy levels,
the electrons may have s, p, d, or f states, for which the
angular-momentum quantum number (l) equals 0, 1, 2,
3, respectively. The notation s, p, d, f comes from the
original description of the atomic-spectral lines arising
from these electron states, namely, sharp, principal, dif-
fuse, and fine, although these terms have no counterpart
in the EELS spectra we obtain.
</p>
<p>As we noted in Section 39.1, the nomenclature L2,3
arises from the fact that the L shell, from which the
electron was ejected, has different energy levels. Such
separation of the energies of the core states is called spin-
orbit splitting.
</p>
<p>Because the L electrons in levels 2 and 3 are in the p
state, quantum theory demands that the sum (j) of their
spin quantum number (s) and angular-momentum
quantum numbers (l) is governed by the Pauli exclusion
principle such that j (&frac14; s+l) can only be equal to 1/2, 3/2,
5/2, etc. The spin quantum number, s (not to be
confused with the s state), can only equal �1/2. Taking
all this into account, along with other quantum-number
restrictions, it turns out that in the higher energy (i.e.,
more tightly bound) L2 shell, we can have two p electrons
with j &frac14; �1/2 while in the L3 shell, we can have four p
electrons with j &frac14; �1/2, �3/2. Therefore, we might
expect twice as many electrons to be excited from the
L3 shell as from the L2 shell giving an L3/L2 intensity
ratio (above the edge intensity, not above background)
of 2. While this rule is approximately obeyed in the Fe
spectrum shown in Figure 40.4, in practice, the ratio is
seen to increase along the transition metal series from
0.8 for Ti to 3 for Ni, as is also seen in the spectral
sequence in Figure 40.4.
</p>
<p>Now these p-state electrons in the L shell cannot be
excited to just any unoccupied state.
</p>
<p>So for the p state (l &frac14; 1) the only permitted final
states are either an s state (l &frac14; 0) or a d state (l &frac14; 2).
Consequently, the core electrons are ejected primarily
into the unoccupied d states in the conduction band,
since there are few available s states there.
</p>
<p>It is because of the dipole-selection rule that we don&rsquo;t
see a strong L1 edge in the spectrum. The L1 edge sits
closer to the nucleus than the L2 and L3 edges and its
electrons are in the s state (l&frac14; 0) so they can only be
excited to a p state (l&frac14; 1), but not to a d state (l&frac14; 2), or
to another s state. Since there are few unfilled p states in
</p>
<p>DOS AND FERMI SURFACES
Even if you don&rsquo;t understand the intricacies of the
DOS and Fermi surfaces, you can still deduce bond-
ing information by comparing your experimental
ELNES with that from standard specimens of
known valence state or coordination.

<p>the conduction band of transition metals and they are
muchmore spread out in energy than the d states, the L1
intensity is very low and the peak is broad and may even
be invisible in the L2,3 post-edge structure.
</p>
<p>The energy width of the white lines is also affected
by the time it takes for the ionized state to decay. One
form of Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainty principle states that
DEDt &frac14; h/4p, so a rapid decay gives a wide peak. For
example, the Fe L2 ionization can be rapidly compen-
sated by an electron from the L3 shell filling the hole and
ejecting an Auger electron from the d shell. (This is
called a Coster-Kronig transition.) A conduction band
electron could also fill the L2 core hole but the L3 core
hole can only be filled from the conduction band. There-
fore, because there are two possible ways to fill the L2
core hole, the L2 line has a shorterDt and a largerE than
the L3 line, which is much sharper.
</p>
<p>In elements that don&rsquo;t have strong white lines, the
ELNES is still present but appears just as weaker oscil-
lations in intensity, which still reflect the DOS, and
which, like the white lines, we can calculate and predict
(much more of this later) (e.g., look at the pure-Cu
ELNES in Figure 40.5C compared with the Fe
ELNES in Figure 40.4).
</p>
<p>40.3 APPLICATIONS OF ELNES
</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see how all of this physics can be useful. (Is this
an oxymoron?) The ELNES has been found to be
dependent on details of the local atomic environment,
such as coordination, valence state, and the type of
bonding. Measurement of the fine structure, under-
standing how it is related to the electronic structure
and ultimately to materials properties, can answer
some hitherto-unsolved problems, particularly those
where changes in bonding occur over small distances
in your specimen. If you look at Figure 40.5, you&rsquo;ll see
the carbon K edges for graphite and diamond. The
carbon atom has hybridized s and p orbitals (termed s
and p in molecular-orbital theory). Graphite contains
sp2 bonds in the basal plane with Van der Waals bond-
ing between the planes. In contrast, the diamond struc-
ture has four directional, hybridized, sp3 covalent
bonds and the atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated
rather than arranged in graphitic sheets. The strong
peak K edge at 284 eV identifies the empty p* states
into which theK shell electrons are transferred in graph-
ite, while the diamond K edge has no p* peak but shows
a strong s* peak at about 290 eV. This kind of informa-
tion is also extremely useful in the study of thin diamond
and diamond-like carbon films, which are of great
interest to both semiconductor manufacturers and the
coatings industry (sunglasses in particular). Carbon
films can be made with a continuous range of graphitic
and diamond-like character and it is possible to deduce
the relative fraction of sp3 (diamond) and sp2 (graphite)
bonding from the K edge ELNES (Bruley et al.). In
today&rsquo;s world of carbon nanotubes, buckyballs, and
graphene, all these newer forms of carbon can easily be

<p>distinguished by their ELNES. For example, carbon K-
edge spectra from C60 (Buckminsterfullerene of Bucky-
balls) are also shown in Figure 40.5 in the standard and
shock-compressed form. Another useful example is
given in Figure 40.5B, where the changes in the Cu
L2,3 edge with oxidation are shown. This is a classic
example. Since Cu metal has all its 3d states filled,
there are no white lines in spectra from the metal.
Upon oxidation, some 3d electrons are transferred to
the oxygen, leaving unfilled states, and the white lines
appear in the oxide spectrum.Note also that the onset of
the oxide edge is different from that of the metal,
because this electron transfer changes the value of EC.
</p>
<p>ELNES changes often occur at interfaces where the
bonding changes locally over less than 1 nm. In Figure 40.6
the Si-K edge ELNES is seen to change across a
Si-SiO2 interface because the Si bonding changes. In
this example, you can see the extraordinary power of
an FEG STEM to provide simultaneous atomic-level
images and spectra localized to individual atomic col-
umns (even though this work (from Batson) is now
more than 15 years old). The combination of Z-contrast
imaging (see Section 22.4) and PEELS is arguably the
most powerful analytical technique for atomic charac-
terization, as we showed in Figures 39.22 and 39.23.
</p>
<p>Bonding may also be changed by local segregation
and one of themore powerful examples of ELNES is the
detection of bonding changes associated with elemental
segregation to interfaces, which can cause extraordinary
changes in the mechanical properties of metals and
alloys. For example, Ni3Al has great potential as a
high-temperature intermetallic, but is limited by its
inherent brittle behavior resulting in intergranular frac-
ture. It has been known for many years that this brittle
behavior can be countered by the addition of a fraction
of a percent of B which is known to segregate to the
boundaries. Why this segregation results in a major
ductility improvement was unknown until it was
shown that, at B-containing boundaries, the Ni L2,3
edge exhibits slight ELNES changes consistent with
the more metallic-like bonding of pure Ni (see Muller
et al.). In a complementary study, Keast et al. measured
Bi segregation to Cu grain boundaries, and observed
ELNES changes in the Cu L2,3 edge, consistent with
the Cu atoms in the boundary taking on a less-metallic
bonding state (see Figure 40.7). This ELNES change,
which is equivalent to the transfer of less than 0.3 elec-
trons (whatever that means) from each Cu atom at the
boundary to an adjacent Bi atom, may account for the
brittle behavior of Cu doped with as little as 20 ppm Bi;
an extraordinary change in mechanical behavior, noted
first in 1874. Understanding the role of slight electronic
bonding effects in such macroscopic behavior as brittle
behavior may help to transform the power-generation
industry for example, which spends billions of dollars
removing impurity elements that cause catastrophic fail-
ure of pressure vessels if left to segregate to grain
boundaries.
</p>
<p>Such studies of ELNES are probably the most widely
used aspects of EELS and the literature abounds with
ELNES studies of valency determination and atomic
coordination. Some examples include bonding changes
at oxide interfaces on Si (Botton et al.) and probing the
structure of potential next-generation Hf-based gate
oxides in Si semiconductors (McComb et al.). Reviews
of the potential and practical applications of ELNES
have been given by Keast et al. and Brydson et al.

<p>40.4 ELNES FINGERPRINTING
</p>
<p>Although the ELNES is directly related to the details of
the electronic structure, interpretation of particular fea-
tures in an experimental spectrum is not always
</p>
<p>FIGURE 40.6. The change in the ELNES of the Si L edge across an

<p>THE CHEMICAL SHIFT
This difference in edge-onset energies is called a chem-
ical shift and also helps to fingerprint the specimen.

<p>straightforward and you may not have the capability to
carry out the atomic-structure calculations that we&rsquo;ll
describe below. If this is the case, don&rsquo;t despair because
you can still use a fingerprinting approach without fully
knowing the details of the electronic structure. The idea
behind such fingerprinting, as we&rsquo;ve seen for the low-
loss spectra, is that the general form of the ELNES is
predominantly sensitive to the nearest-neighbor coordi-
nation and so it changes with changes in the structure.
An example is provided by the Al-L2,3 ELNES and Al-K
ELNES of aluminum-oxygen materials which are sensi-
tive to the local coordination of Al (i.e., whether octahe-
dral or tetrahedral). Likewise, Figure 40.8 shows the
experimental Mn-L2,3 ELNES for different minerals in
which the valence state of theMn varies from 2+ to 4+.
Again, we use the word fingerprint to emphasize that it is
not necessary to understand the details of the DOS of
complex materials in order to be able to interpret the
ELNES spectra. Direct comparison with spectra from
known standards is often all that is required for probable
identification of the bonding state of a specific atom in
your specimen. But because the matches are rarely per-
fect (given all the experimental and specimen variables
that may affect the detailed intensity in the fine structure)
go back and read our caution about low-loss
</p>
<p>fingerprinting in Section 38.3.A and apply it to your
ELNES fingerprinting. Note that you don&rsquo;t need the
very best energy resolution to carry out fingerprinting:
the data in Figure 40.8 were takenmany years ago from a
standard PEELS system and, for many cases, a LaB6
source is fine.
</p>
<p>A theoretical calculation of the unoccupiedDOSwill
always be useful in understanding or predicting features
in the ELNES. In the next section, we&rsquo;ll show some
examples where modeling the ELNES has helped our
interpretation.
</p>
<p>40.5 ELNES CALCULATIONS
</p>
<p>Many attempts have been made to compare the experi-
mental ELNES with calculations of the DOS in simple
materials, such as metals and oxides. Great strides have
beenmade in the last few years, mainly in improvements
in models of the atomic potentials and in the computing
power needed to pursue the calculations. This aspect is
transforming the study of ELNES from an esoteric field
to one with broad applications in materials science. This
topic is also addressed in substantial depth in the com-
panion text.

<p>40.5.A The Potential Choice
</p>
<p>Calculating the electronic structure in solids involves
solving the Schrödinger equation for each electron in
the potential of the solid, including the Coulomb poten-
tial of both the nuclei and all the other electrons. (Now
might be a good time to move on to the next section if
you haven&rsquo;t recognized too many words in the previous
sentence!) We also have to include terms due to the fact
that the electrons are affected by the presence of other
electrons and their behavior is correlated (i.e., they
aren&rsquo;t isolated particles). Given the large number of
electrons involved in any calculation, we often use an
approach called density-functional theory (DFT) (if
you&rsquo;re into physics and want to go to the next level (or
two) then you need to read Finnis&rsquo; (2003) book on
atomic-modeling which includes DFT). Out of DFT
comes a simplifying assumption, which we call the
local-density approximation (LDA). Within the LDA
method, we choose one of three different approaches to
perform our calculations, which basically come down to
a choice of atomic potential
</p>
<p>&amp; We can calculate the band structure directly in
reciprocal space. This is usually described as the
band-theory approach and the electron states
are formed in a repeating crystal lattice. If this
reminds you of Bloch states, back in Chapter 14,
you&rsquo;re right.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can describe the electron states in terms of molec-
ular orbitals (MO).
</p>
<p>&amp; We can calculate the effect of multiple scattering
(MS) of the electron wave in real space based on
the model shown in Figure 40.1A.
</p>
<p>A range of band-structure methods are used and
they go by rather strange names, such as augmented
plane wave (APW), full-potential linearized APW
(FLAPW) (URL #2), augmented spherical wave
(ASW) (URL #3), CASTEP (URL #4), Layer
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (LKKR), pseudopotentials,
and other methods. The URLs will lead you to the
sites for the various public-domain or commercial ver-
sions of the software. The best name by far is themuffin-
tin (MT) potential (URL #5), which is spherically
symmetric at the atomic positions and flat between
them. (Apparently, to some physicists, this shape looks
like a cross section of a tin used to bake muffins.)
This model modifies the classic energy diagram, as
shown in Figure 40.9. The MT form is useful because
it generates wave functions that we can break down into
the various angular-momentum components (which
describe the partial DOS which is reflected in the
ELNES). However, most MT approaches assume the
crystal lattice is infinite and you need Bloch&rsquo;s theorem
for the wave-function calculations which give the DOS.
You&rsquo;ll probably find these techniques computationally
challenging and not very flexible. But with the advent of
easily available, high-performance, parallel computing,
we are no longer so constrained (see the next section).
For example, only recently haveMO theorists been able
model large unit cells, planar interfaces, and those (now-
ubiquitous) amorphous materials.
</p>
<p>MO theory is just an extension of using molecular
orbitals to describe solids. (Not surprisingly, this
approach is often used by chemists!) To use this
approach, we have to divide our specimen into separate
molecular units. If we calculate the MOs for each unit,

</p>
<p>in which the Mn coordination and hence valence state changes. The L2
and L3white lines broaden as the oxidation state increases from+2 to+4
</p>
<p>and in some cases the L3 peak splits into two peaks. Understanding why
</p>
<p>such changes happen from an electronic standpoint is not necessary for
</p>
<p>identifying the different minerals or valence states.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>we can then interpret the ELNES spectra in terms of
core-shell electrons being ejected into unoccupied MOs.
These unoccupied MOs arise because the excited-atom
orbitals interact (i.e., bond) with nearest-neighbor
atoms. (This is the p/p* and s/s* bonding/antibonding
orbital notation that we used to describe the C-K shell
ELNES back in Figure 40.5A). We can extend this idea
and imagine the various MOs as simply linear combina-
tions of atomic orbitals (which is then called the LCAO
approach). LCAO works well if the orbitals are occu-
pied but, for unoccupied orbitals, we have to use the
self-consistent field (SCF) method, which basically
assumes that the atoms are organized in a localized
molecular cluster which then uses a version of the MS
method which we&rsquo;ll now describe.
</p>
<p>MS (not Word!) calculations are based on the inter-
pretation of the ELNES as scattering of the electron
wave that emerges from the ionized atom by atomic
shells around that excited atom (which we started with
back in Figure 40.1). Still themost elegantMSmethod is
that due to Durham et al. The Durham method first
divides the cluster of atoms into shells, each approxi-
mately equidistant from the ionized atom. We then
solve the scattering within each atomic shell in turn.
Finally, we consider scattering between different atomic
shells. Since we have to calculate all possible scattering
paths it&rsquo;s much easier in crystals because we can use
their symmetry to facilitate our calculations. A self-
consistent version of the MS method called FEFF
(now in version 8) is commercially available (URL #6)
and highly recommended. You can extend this shell-by-
shell MS approach to model much more complex amor-
phous systems, incommensurate structures, and non-
periodic atomic arrangements at planar interfaces and
defects. You&rsquo;ll find that the MS calculations predict
modulations in the near-edge intensity, which corre-
spond directly to the DOS of the ionized atom. So you
should be aware that these calculations are only an
interpretation of what actually happens to the electron
after it emerges above the Fermi level. Also, many
</p>
<p>calculations of ELNES only show reasonable agree-
ment with experiment when the effect of the core hole
is included, so we now need to explain this terminology.
</p>
<p>Figure 40.10 gives a comparison of the experimental
C-K edge ELNES from TiC with the results of calcula-
tions using several different potentials, none of which
reproduce the experimental spectrum precisely but all of
which capture some aspects of the general shape.
</p>
<p>40.5.B Core Holes and Excitons
</p>
<p>Having chosen an atomic potential, we actually deter-
mine the ELNES (using the MS approach) by calculat-
ing all possible inter- and intra-shell scattering events
suffered by the electron after it emerges above the Fermi
level. One of the problems that confuses this issue is that
the ionization event results in a hole in the core shell
which, of course, changes the atomic potential.
</p>
<p>A bit more physics: The ionization process occurs in
the time taken for the beam electron to traverse the diam-
eter of the particular inner shell. We know that a 200-keV
electron has a velocity, v&frac14; 2.7� 108ms�1, and theK-shell
of oxygen, for example, has a diameter of�0.01 nm, so the
ionization process occurs over �10�19�10�20 s. By
comparison, the atom stays in its excited state (which is a

<p>combination of the lifetimes of the excited electron and the
lifetime of the hole in the inner-shell) for much longer,
because the hole decays in �10&ndash;14&ndash;10&ndash;15 s. Because the
lifetime of a hole is 105 � longer than the excitation
process, the outermost electron states, including the final
state of the excitation process, will experience an attractive
potential because of the core hole, which behaves like an
extra nuclear charge on the atom. So, in fact, all we do to
compensate for this is assume that the ionized atom now
has a nuclear charge of Z+1, rather than Z, because the
missing electron lowers the shielding affect of the core
electrons. This extra positive charge may be shielded by
other electrons (e.g., weakly bound valence electrons)
which will move in response to the existence of the hole
and reduce its effect. Despite this screening (go back and
check Section 3.5 to remind yourself what this term
means), the core-hole potential will tend to attract the
outer electron states more strongly. So the available final
states for the ejected electron, in the presence of the long-
lived hole, will tend to bemore sensitive to the short-range
environment of the excited atom and, of course, this will
be reflected in the ELNES.
</p>
<p>40.5.C Comparison of ELNES Calculations
and Experiments
</p>
<p>The 1982 seminal paper in the field of ELNES experi-
ments on transition metals and oxides is by Leapman et
al. For further examples, you should read the review
articles which we mentioned at the end of Section 40.3.
We&rsquo;ll just show a couple of examples here but the litera-
ture contains many. The difference due to different
coordinations is obvious. The sharp peak at the Al L
edge onset is thought to be an exciton. This effect is not
well modeled by the theory, which otherwise makes a
good match with the experimental data.
</p>
<p>The electron energy-loss near-edge structure
(ELNES) at the O K edge has been studied in yttria-
stabilized zirconia (YSZ) (Ostanin et al.). The electronic
structure of YSZ for compositions between 3 and
15 mol.% Y2O3 has been computed using a pseudopo-
tential-based technique to calculate the local relaxations
near the O vacancies. The results showed phase transi-
tion from the tetragonal to cubic YSZ at 10 mol.% of
Y2O3, reproducing experimental observations. Using
the relaxed defect geometry, calculation of the ELNES
was carried out using the full-potential linear muffin-tin
</p>
<p>orbital method. The results show very good agreement
with the experimental O K-edge signal, demonstrating
the power of using ELNES to probe the stabilization
mechanism in doped metal oxides.
</p>
<p>If an atom exists in two different environments in a
structure, then we can make the approximation that the
ELNES is simply a linear superposition of the contribu-
tions from the two environments and experiments tend
to support this simple approach.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perhaps best to conclude with the conclusion of
Duscher et al.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We have reached a level of agreement between
theory and experiment not achieved previously
in such a range of different materials by including
a localized core-hole effect. There was no signifi-
cant difference between both the methods used,
a core hole in an all-electron method and the
Z+1 approximation. This approach is sufficiently
robust to proceed to interface structures.&rsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>In other words, theoretical calculations are a well-
established and useful field of ELNES research and this
is explored much further in the companion text. One last
and obvious point to note is that, because the ELNES
signals are often quite strong, it is straightforward to map
out different portions of the ELNES, thus imaging, in
effect, changes in the DOS and localized variations
in atomic bonding, with the usual high resolution expected
of EFTEM images. An example is shown in Figure 40.11.
</p>
<p>40.6 CHEMICAL SHIFTS IN THE EDGE
ONSET
</p>
<p>We can think of the atoms in our specimen as having
different charges with respect to one another (which we
otherwise call electronegativity). So any changes in the
charge in different systems will lead to changes in the
binding energies of the various (occupied and unoccu-
pied) electron states and it&rsquo;s reasonable to ask if we
could detect this binding-energy change in EELS. We
already know that (for a hypothetical, single, isolated,
hydrogen atom) the ionization-edge threshold energy is
effectively the critical ionization energy, EC. However,
in a real material, the experimental-edge onset corre-
sponds to the difference in energy between the initial
state and the lowest unoccupied final state in the pres-
ence of the core-hole.More often than not, it is extremely
difficult to determine accurately the threshold energy,
which often lies above the experimental-edge onset.
Changes in the effective charge on the atom affect the
energies of both the initial and final states. Unlike
the deep-lying core orbitals, the outer orbitals are easily
influenced by factors, such as bonding. If we consider
changing from a metal to an insulator, the presence of a
band gap in the insulator will result in a shift of the edge
</p>
<p>REAL MATERIALS
In ceramics and semiconductors, the ionized electron
remains localized to the ionized atom. It may interact
with the hole creating an electron-core hole bound
state termed an exciton. Creation of an exciton may
influence the ELNES; this remains a matter of some
debate.

<p>onset to higher energy loss. For example, the Al-L23
edge shifts from 73 eV in the metal to 77 eV in Al2O3,
and we saw similar behavior for the Cu/CuO spectra in
Figure 40.5B. Another example is provided by the C-K
edges in Figure 40.5A, in which shifts in the p* peak
position are easier to see than changes in the rather ill-
defined edge onsets.
</p>
<p>Similar edge-onset shifts are well known in XPS and
are called chemical shifts. They are reasonablywell under-
stood and we can often predict them theoretically. How-
ever, the electron-excitation process in EELS is more
complicated than X-ray induced ionization (detected in
XPS), particularly the unavoidable presence of the core
hole and the variable extent to which it is screened by the
remaining electrons. Consequently, in comparison with
X-rays, little systematic work on EELS chemical shifts
has been done, apart from fingerprinting experimental
</p>
<p>spectra and comparing them with reference materials.
While we can correlate the edge-onset energies with such
variables as oxidation states, atomic charge, and coordi-
nation, there is room for considerable improvement in
calculation of the true edge-onset energies. It&rsquo;s worth
noting that the possibility of a chemical shift in the edge
may make it difficult to interpret ELNES intensity
changes detected by difference techniques (such as the
example shown back in Figure 40.7B). However, careful
experimentation should minimize this danger.
</p>
<p>40.7 EXELFS
</p>
<p>If, after an atom is ionized, the ejected electron does not
fill an empty state but escapes outside the atom, then it
acts like a free electron (typically with energy &gt;50 eV).
We can interpret this excess energy as an electron wave,
which can be diffracted by the atoms in the structure
around the original ionization site. Because the electron
has higher energy than those which gave rise tomultiple-
scattering ELNES, the diffraction is assumed to be a
single-scattering event, as shown back in Figure 40.1B,
and this diffraction causes oscillations on the otherwise
smooth DOS. We call these oscillations extended
energy-loss fine structure or EXELFS. As with any
diffraction event, there is information in these EXELFS
ripples about atomic positions and the atomic informa-
tion comes from a relatively short range (the first
few nearest neighbors) since this weak electron doesn&rsquo;t
scatter from more distant atoms.
</p>
<p>The EXELFS modulations start about 50 eV above
the ionization-edge energy, are each 20&ndash;50 eV wide, as
shown in Figure 40.12A, and occur over several hun-
dred eV. EXELFS is closely analogous to the oscilla-
tions seen in the extended X-ray absorption (edge) fine
structure (EXAFS) in synchrotron X-ray spectra and is
one reason why EELS has long been described as a
synchrotron in a TEM (albeit much cheaper than your
typical synchrotron). One significant difference is that
EXAFS results in complete photoabsorption of the
incident X-ray while EXELFS involves absorption of
only a small fraction of the energy of the beam electron.
We can carry this analogy a little further. Both EXAFS
and EXELFS give us structural information from
materials in which there are strong, local, atomic correla-
tions. Both techniques are atom specific so, in principle,
we can solve even the most complex multi-component

</p>
<p>ELNES AND EXELFS II
ELNES is multiple scattering and EXELFS is single
scattering, although the two phenomena overlap
since, e.g., the L1 ELNES peak is often far enough
past the edge onset to be included in the EXELFS.
</p>

<p>structures, if the information around all the atoms can be
accessed.
</p>
<p>There are, however, limitations to conventional
EXAFS.
</p>
<p>&amp; We can&rsquo;t easily access the K-edges below 3 keV since
X-ray absorption at these low energies requires thin
specimens for transmission-EXAFS and a low
absorption atmosphere over the entire X-ray beam
path (source-specimen-detector).
</p>
<p>&amp; As you know from the XEDS chapters, X-rays can-
not easily be focused to a sub-micrometer spot, so
EXAFS has a relatively low spatial resolution,
although this is constantly improving. EXELFS
offers us the unique ability to obtain atomic and
</p>
<p>electronic structure with nanometer-scale spatial
resolution.
</p>
<p>&amp; Since TEMs operate in high vacuum and use thin
specimens, EELS is more naturally suited to
K-edge analysis of low-Z elements (as well as L-edge
analysis of higher-Z elements) than low-energy
EXAFS.
</p>
<p>There is the usual price to pay for high spatial reso-
lution in that the EXELFS signal is noisy and you&rsquo;ll find
that extracting high-quality atomic information is much
more challenging than for EXAFS where there is no
shortage of signal.
</p>
<p>40.7.A RDF via EXELFS
</p>
<p>With EXELFS we can determine the partial radial dis-
tribution function (RDF) around a specific atom, and
we are not restricted to the heavier atoms (Z&gt;18)
needed for EXAFS. So there is great potential for study-
ing materials, such as low-Z glasses, amorphous Si, bulk
metallic glasses, and quasicrystalline structures (both of
the latter two often contain relatively low-Z elements
such as Be, Mg, Al, P). In particular, since glasses lack
any long-range periodic structure, we are limited in the
techniques to determine their atomic structure. As
you&rsquo;ve already seen back in Section 18.7, diffraction of
electrons (or X-rays or neutrons) from glass provides
only diffuse information. To get atomic-structure infor-
mation from glasses, you have to employ resonance
signals from the Å-level and EXELFS can do that.
The high spatial resolution of EXELFS is obviously
advantageous and all your data can be compared with
your images and the rest of the TEM-based information
that you acquire from the analyzed volume. However,
you can&rsquo;t get good EXELFS unless your specimen is
very thin and you&rsquo;ll also have to consider phase effects,
which are averaged out in EXAFS. Despite these appar-
ent advantages of EXELFS, RDF work continues to be
dominated by synchrotron X-ray sources because of the
intensity of the signal. If you&rsquo;re interested in pursuing
this (and EXELFS for thatmatter), a good place to start
is the text by Koningsberger and Prins.
</p>
<p>Experimentally, it&rsquo;s not easy to see the EXELFS
modulations because they are only �5% of the edge
intensity, and so you need good counting statistics.
This is one of the rare cases where you might find a
thermionic source useful because it can deliver more

<p>DECONVOLUTION AGAIN
Deconvolution is always the first step if your speci-
men isn&rsquo;t thin enough, i.e., if the plasmon peak is
greater than 10% of the ZLP.

<p>total current than a FEG and, for this application,
energy resolution is not so important. TEM diffraction
mode will also increase your total signal intensity.
Either way, however, you pay a price in terms of a loss
of spatial resolution and an increased chance of speci-
men damage. If you need the best spatial resolution, a
FEG STEM should (as usual) be your instrument of
choice.
</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re interested in EXELFS because of the struc-
tural information contained in the weak intensity oscil-
lations. To extract this information, you can use the
commercial Gatan software (see Section 1.6) or the
EXELFS version of Rehr&rsquo;s FEFF code (URL #6).
Public-domain EXELFS software is also available at
URL #7.
</p>
<p>You first have to ensure that your spectrum contains
only single-scattering information, otherwise the plural-
scattering intensity maymask the small EXELFS peaks.
Deconvoluting the point-spread function may also help
sharpen the faint modulations.
</p>
<p>Next, you have to remove the background if it
wasn&rsquo;t done prior to deconvolution. Then your spec-
trum intensity has to be converted to an electron-wave
function in k-space (reciprocal space) where

</p>
<p>Here a is the distance from the ionized atom to the first
scattering atom, and F is the phase shift that accompa-
nies the scattering. Therefore, we expect to see periodic
maxima occurring for n = 1, 2, etc., and for different
interatomic spacings. We obtain the atomic spacing by
Fourier transforming the k-space modulations to give
the RDF, originating at the ionized atom. Obviously,
these two equations don&rsquo;t tell the full story and there is
more about data analysis in Egerton&rsquo;s book.
</p>
<p>When we have the RDF, we ought to be able to
determine the local atomic environment, if the various
interferences can be discriminated and identified. Peaks
in the RDF indicate the probability of an atom occur-
ring a certain distance from the ionized-atom site.
Figure 40.12 shows a summary of the EXELFS data
extraction technique. Despite the low signal problems,
EXELFS studies appeared at the earliest stages of EELS
research (see, e.g., Leapman and Cosslett) and refer-
ences to the technique have continued to surface in the
</p>
<p>literature over the intervening decades. For example,
Sikora et al. have compared EXELFS and EXAFS
applied to crystalline materials. Alamgir et al. have
made comparisons of the two techniques for the study
of slow-cooled, bulk metallic glasses (a fascinating new
range of materials). Figure 40.13 shows the extraction of
EXELFS data from the P-K edge (inaccessible in a
synchrotron spectrum) from Pd-Ni-P, a model amor-
phousmetal. The various steps involve first the isolation
of the fine structure (Figure 40.13A) and expressing it as
a function of momentum transfer (k), w(k), from beyond
the P K-edge (Figure 40.13B). The Fourier transform of
w(k), FT[w(k)], is proportional to the partial radial dis-
tribution function of atoms around P (Figure 40.13C).
Upon back-Fourier transformation of the first peak
FT[w(k)], the contribution to w(k) from the first coordi-
nation shell around P in these glasses is determined
(Figure 40.13D). Similar exercises could be performed
from the second and higher shells although the quality
of the signal degrades rapidly. These data are then fitted
with calculated w(k) functions of various model struc-

and Ni atoms around the P atoms is created.
</p>
<p>40.7.B RDF via Energy-Filtered Diffraction
</p>
<p>RDF data acquired through EXELFS complement
another TEM method of acquiring RDF information.
This involves energy filtering of SADPs by scanning the
pattern across the entrance aperture to the PEELS using
post-specimen scan coils. (See, e.g., McBride and Cock-
ayne; see also Section 18.7.) Effectively, a full spectrum
is available at each scattering angle, but, in fact, only the
zero-loss (ideally only the elastic) electrons are required.
The plot of the ZLP intensity as a function of scattering
angle constitutes a line profile across a filtered DP from
which the RDF can be extracted. This process does not
have the spatial resolution of EXELFS, since typical
SADPs are integrated over �0.2&ndash;1 mm2, but the signal
is much stronger. Accuracies of �0.001 nm in nearest-
neighbor distances can be obtained, and the process is
rapid enough to be performed on-line.
</p>
<p>40.7.C A Final Thought Experiment
</p>
<p>ELNES and EXELFS are really quite remarkable
demonstrations of quantum theory and the wave-parti-
cle duality. Consider that the EXELFS part of the spec-
trum only contains electrons that have been scattered by
electrons in the specimen atoms, and yet we are able to
deduce information about what happened to those
atoms long after the beam-specimen interaction occurred
and also deduce where the scattering atom sits in the
structure!

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>An (approximately wrong) particle-based analogy
would be to imagine that we are catching bowling balls
that have been thrown at pins, arranged in a certain pat-
tern. (Although instructive, this exercise is best carried out
as a thought experiment.) From the velocity (energy) of the
balls that we catch, we are able not only to identify the
weight of the pin thatwas hit (i.e., identify the characteristic
ionization edge), but we can also deduce how the pin fell
down and where it rolled (the ELNES). Furthermore, we
can also work out the spatial arrangement of the surround-
ing pins that didn&rsquo;t fall down (the EXELFS).
</p>
<p>So how does the beam electron know where the core
electron went after it left the inner shell? The answer lies
in the fact that the bowling ball (particle) analogy is
totally inadequate. In fact, only certain electron transi-
tions are allowed and the beam electron can therefore
only transfer certain quantized energies to the core elec-
tron, not a continuum of possible energies. So the beam
electron does, in effect, &lsquo;know&rsquo; the possible final state of
the core electron since it reflects that state in its energy
loss. (If you really understand this, then you should pat
yourself on the back.)

<p>40.8 ANGLE-RESOLVED EELS
</p>
<p>Most of the time so far, we&rsquo;ve been talking about gathering
spectra and images by sending the direct beam into the
spectrometer and splitting it up into its component ener-
gies. This is often called spatially resolved EELS since we
map out a specific region or gather individual spectra from
different spatial locations on the specimen. However, we
have occasionally mentioned that the angle of scatter of
the energy-loss electrons is important, and there is a whole
field of EELS research that studies angle-resolved spectra.
To do this, we just scan theDP across the PEELS entrance
aperture and gather spectra at different angles as for the
RDF measurements that we just described. However,
rather than studying the energy of electrons primarily,
this technique emphasizes the determination of the
momentum of the energy-loss electrons.Momentum-trans-
fer studies were pioneered by Silcox and co-workers. Now
with FEG STEMs you can get even more information
about the symmetry of electronic states, which comple-
ments spatially resolved ELNES (e.g., Wang et al.).
</p>
<p>Because of such angular effects, the size of the spec-
trometer entrance aperture and/or the collection angle b
may influence the details of ELNES. If the final state of
the ejected electron has a definite directionality, as it will
in an anisotropic crystal, the ELNES for such a speci-
men will depend on both the scattering angle y and the
crystal orientation. The classic paper on orientation or
momentum dependence is the study of graphite and BN
(Leapman et al.).
</p>
<p>There are various ways of performing angle-resolved
EELS and Botton and co-workers describe many meth-
ods and applications. For a given energy loss and a
given specimen orientation, the momentum transfer at
zero scattering angle, y, is parallel to the electron beam
(q||). As y is increased, a component perpendicular to the
beam is introduced (q?) and, at approximately yE, q?
becomes dominant. To obtain angle-resolved ELNES,
we have tomeasure the spectra as a function of the angle
between a crystal direction and the direction of momen-
tum transfer.
</p>
<p>First, you can keep the orientation fixed and change
the collection aperture. Figure 40.14 shows angle-resolved
ELNES of a very thin (� 30 nm) graphite flake obtained
by changing the size of the collection aperture in a STEM.
The p* states are parallel to the c-axis, which in this case is
parallel to the electron beam. Therefore, the correspond-
ing p* peak intensity is larger, relative to the s* states,
when we have a small collection aperture and q|| domi-
nates. Similar effects would be obtained if the orientation
of the graphite planes to the electron beam was changed.
</p>
<p>Second, you can keep your collection angle fixed at a
small angle &lt; yE and measure the ELNES as a function
of y. This is particularly easy with energy filtering which
can display angular scattering distributions of specific
energy-loss electrons.
</p>
<p>You can also use the &lsquo;458 method&rsquo; (Botton) which
combines tilting the specimen at 458 to the principal
axis and measuring the ELNES at �y, where y is cho-
sen to select both q? and q||. If you make the beam
convergent (e.g., in STEM mode for high spatial reso-
lution) then the angular resolution of this technique is
reduced.
</p>
<p>One practical aspect of angle-resolved EELS is the
study of Compton scattering, which is the ejection of
outer-shell electrons by high-energy photons or elec-
trons. We can detect these Compton-scattered electrons
by observing the EELS spectrum at a high scattering
angle (y �100 mrad), either by displacing the objective
aperture to select an off-axis portion of the diffraction
pattern or by tilting the incident beam. This process has
been used to analyze the angular and energy distribution
of Compton-scattered electrons and determine bonding
information, since the Compton-scattering process is
influenced by the binding energy.
</p>
<p>40.9 EELS TOMOGRAPHY
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about tomography in various parts of the
book and how taking a series of images at different tilts
allows you to reconstruct 3D information about features
within your specimen. You should also read the chapter in
the companion text which gives an in-depth review of the
various experimental challenges for this kind of imaging.
</p>
<p>Just as for X-ray images, it is possible to use a full-tilt
series of EFTEM images to build up a full 3D image
</p>
<p>FIGURE 40.14. Image mode EEL spectra of the C-K edge in graphite

<p>from a set of 2D projections. (See the paper by Midgley
and Weyland.) Because ionization-edge composition
images are not susceptible to significant contrast
changes as a function of tilt, they are ideal for tomo-
graphic reconstruction which reveals the surface fea-
tures, growth angles/facets, and other features that are
not easily obtained from the usual 2D projection image.
EFTEM tomography is similar to XEDS tomography
which we didn&rsquo;t discuss: EFTEM tomography has the
advantage of much quicker generation because XEDS
tomography is only feasible via a series of tilted STEM
images which take much longer to produce.
</p>
<p>Figure 40.15A shows one of the P-L ionization-edge
images from a tilt series and Figure 40.15B shows the
reconstructed tomographic image of the distribution of
P in a cell from a fruit fly. In this area, the biologists
are well ahead of the materials scientists and Leapman
et al., in 2004, gave a fine example of the application
of EELS tomography to discerning the 3-D shape
of ribosomes (not quite EELS of eels, but of
nematode worms, which look a bit like eels!). In contrast
to ionization-edge images, plasmon images retain sig-
nificant diffraction contrast and so are less useful for
tomography.

<p>EFTEM tomography is an area that will see increas-
ing applications, particularly as nanotechnologists pur-
sue their dream ofmanufacturing devices in a controlled
manner from the atom/molecule upward. The ability of
EFTEM (and to a lesser extent, XEDS) to reveal the
actual shape (combined with the quantitative local
chemistry) of quantum dots, gate oxides, and other
sub-nanometer fabrications will seriously enhance
TEM&rsquo;s role in this growing field.
</p>
<p>The ability to extract 3D information by tomo-
graphic methods is just one of several examples of the
extraordinary advances that have taken place in the
TEM field since the first edition of this book was pub-
lished more than 10 years ago.
</p>
<p>It is worth concluding now, as we did then, that we
encourage you to experiment with your TEM at all
opportunities and never think that there is nothing new
</p>
<p>to discover. The current generation of students growing
up with an expectation of, and familiarity with, full com-
puter control of everything and access to information
immediately from anywhere should be able to combine
these skills to make TEMs perform in ways that the
former generation of more manually oriented TEM
operators could never dream of. For example, we haven&rsquo;t
even mentioned time-resolved EELS although the strong
low-loss signal and efficient collectionmeans that gather-
ing spectra with millisecond or even microsecond resolu-
tion is not out of the question and ultra-fast
(nanosecond) TEM imaging using laser-excited sources
is fast becoming a reality. Nodoubt there will be a serious
need for yet another edition of &lsquo;TEM: a text for nano-
technologists&rsquo; a decade hence, which we sincerely hope
will be written by some of those who started their careers
by reading this book, rather than by those who wrote it.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER SUMMARY
You can appreciate now that there is a wealth of fine detail in the EEL spectrum beyond the
relatively strong plasmon peaks and the ionization edges. To extract this information, you need
a single-scattering (deconvoluted) spectrum and occasionally some sophisticated mathematical
analysis. Interpretation of the data is still limited by our lack of knowledge of the physics of the
electron-specimen interactions. However, considerable research is going on into EELS fine-
structure studies which are the future of the technique. Both the experimental methods and the
theoretical calculations are still developing. We have introduced several specialized topics
</p>
<p>&amp; Energy-loss near-edge structure.
&amp; Extended energy-loss fine structure.
&amp; RDF determination.
&amp; Angle-resolved (momentum-transfer) EELS.
&amp; EELS tomography.
</p>
<p>However, we have really only given you a suspicion of the potential of these topics. If
EELS becomes a technique you use in your research, we recommend watching its develop-
ment and that of related techniques in the reference sources we have given you in the last
four chapters, particularly the quadrennial EELS workshops (see Chapter 37), conferences
such as the biannual Frontiers of ElectronMicroscopy inMaterials Science (FEMMS), and
the proceedings of the various national and international microscopy and analysis societies
which, if you haven&rsquo;t joined by now, you should do so immediately!

</p>
<p>TEXT-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
T40.1 Distinguish single, multiple, and plural scattering for EELS. How do these definitions compare with
</p>
<p>scattering terms used in high-resolution imaging?
</p>
<p>T40.2 Figure 40.1 gives an electron-wave description of the generation of ELNES and EXELFS. Can you use a
</p>
<p>particle analogy to describe the process?
</p>
<p>T40.3 Is Figure 40.2 drawn for a crystalline metal or an amorphous semiconductor? Explain your answer and
</p>
<p>thus indicate how the figure would change if the other kind of material were being illustrated.
</p>
<p>T40.4 In Figure 40.3 there appears to be no intensity in the ionization edge corresponding to the filled states.
</p>
<p>Why is this? In a real spectrum there would indeed be intensity before the ionization edge. What would
</p>
<p>cause this?
</p>
<p>T40.5 Why does the Cu L edge in Figures 40.4 and 40.5B exhibit no intense white lines at the edge onset like the

</p>
<p>T40.6 In old specimens and older TEMs, the diamond K edge (like in Figure 40.5A) sometimes shows residual
</p>
<p>intensity preceding the ionization-edge onset, at roughly the same energy as the p* sp2 peak in the

</p>
<p>calculating ELNES. If you can, what different conclusions can you draw?
</p>
<p>T40.9 How do you think that correcting the spherical aberration in the objective lens will improve the study of

<p>near-edge spectrum?
</p>
<p>T40.12 List the principal differences between FLAPW, ASW, CASTEP, and LKKR.
</p>
<p>T40.13 ELNES fingerprinting can distinguish different mineral species as in Figure 40.8. Why should we ever
</p>
<p>bother to use XEDS to study the same problem? Does the beam-sensitivity of many minerals have a role
</p>
<p>to play in deciding what technique to use? If so, explain what.
</p>
<p>T40.14 Why does the signal in Figure 40.12B become noisier at larger wavevectors?

<p>T40.15 Given what you know about the crystal structures of graphite and diamond, would you expect either of
</p>
<p>their energy-loss spectra to be sensitive to crystallographic orientation? If so, how do you think the fine
</p>
<p>scale features of the relevant spectrum in Figure 40.5A might change with orientation? (Hint: look at
</p>
<p>Figure 40.14.)
</p>
<p>T40.16 Compare and contrast EXAFS and EXELFS for studying short-range atomic structures. Why would
</p>
<p>you use EXELFS when TEM diffraction patterns give similar short-range atomic structural
</p>
<p>information?
</p>
<p>T40.17 In addition to ELNES and energy-filtered diffraction for RDF determination, can you think of other
</p>
<p>ways to explore the structure of glasses using TEM?
</p>
<p>T40.18 For both momentum-resolved and tomographic EELS, we have to tilt the specimen considerably. What
</p>
<p>are the experimental challenges to doing this and how might they be overcome?
</p>
<p>T40.19 If the low-loss spectrum reveals the valence states of the atoms in the specimen why do we not use this
</p>
<p>part of the spectrum more often for bonding studies but instead use ELNES which only explores the
</p>
<p>unfilled DOS (i.e., the electrons that aren&rsquo;t there)?
</p>
<p>T40.20 Explain why K-shell ionization results in a hydrogenic edge.
</p>
<p>T40.21 Explain why L shell ionization gives L1, L2, and L3 edges.
</p>
<p>T40.22 Why is the L1 edge rarely visible, thus leaving the usual L edge as the L2,3 in spectra from transition
</p>
<p>metals?
</p>
<p>T40.23 Similarly, why is the M4,5 edge the expected M edge in the rare earths?
</p>
<p>T40.24 Explain why EELS edges and X-ray absorption edges are effectively the same phenomenon.
