<p>1.1  The Big Cosmic Questions
</p>
<p>Cosmology is the study of the origin, nature and evolution of our universe. 
Its practitioners strive to describe cosmic history in quantitative detail, using 
the language of modern physics and abstract mathematics. Yet, at its core, 
our cosmological knowledge is the answer to a few fundamental questions. 
Have you ever drifted off deep into thought, wondering: Is the universe 
finite or infinite? Has it existed forever? If not, when and how did it come 
into being? Will it ever end? How do we humans fit into the grand scheme 
of things? All ancient and modern cultures have developed creation stories 
where at least some of these questions have been addressed.
</p>
<p>In one of the Chinese creation myths, the universe begins as a black egg 
containing a sleeping giant, named Pan Gu. He slept for 18,000 years and 
grew while he slept. Then he woke up and cracked the egg open with an ax. 
The light part of the egg floated up to form the sky, while the heavy part 
stayed down and formed the Earth. Pan Gu remained in the middle and 
continued to grow, pushing the sky and the Earth further apart. When Pan 
Gu died, his breath became the wind, his eyes the Sun and the Moon, his 
sweat turned into rain, and the fleas in his hair transmuted into humans.
</p>
<p>The prospect of being a descendant of fleas may not be fully satisfying, 
but perhaps an even more objectionable aspect of this story is that it does 
not address the obvious question: &ldquo;Where did the black egg come from in 
the first place?&rdquo; Similar types of questions also arise in the context of sci-
entific cosmology. Even if we claim to know what happened at the begin-
ning of the universe, you can always ask: And what happened before that?

</p>
<p>There&nbsp; is also a limit to how far we can see in space, so how can we know 
what lies beyond?
</p>
<p>For a long time it seemed as though we would never know the answers to 
the &ldquo;big&rdquo; cosmic questions. Thus, cosmologists focused mostly on the part of 
the universe that could be directly observed, leaving it to philosophers and 
theologians to argue about the great mysteries. We shall see, however, that 
due to remarkable developments in cosmology over the last few decades, we 
now have answers, that we have reason to believe, to at least some of the big 
questions.
</p>
<p>1.2  Origins of Scientific Cosmology
</p>
<p>The idea that the universe can be rationally understood is at the founda-
tion of all scientific knowledge. This concept is now commonplace, but in 
Ancient Greece more than 20 centuries ago it was a daring hypothesis. The 
Greek philosopher Thales (6th century BC) suggested that all of Nature&rsquo;s 
variety could be understood from a few basic principles, without the inter-
vention of gods. He believed that the primary element of matter was water. 
Two centuries later, Democritus advocated that all matter was made up of 
tiny, eternal, indivisible particles, called atoms, which moved and collided 
with one another in empty space. He stated: &ldquo;Nothing exists except atoms 
and empty space.&rdquo; This line of thought was further developed by Epicurus 
(3rd century BC), who argued that complex order, including living organ-
isms, evolved in a natural way, by random collisions and rearrangements 
of atoms, without any purpose or intelligent design. Epicurus asserted that 
atoms occasionally experience small random &ldquo;swerves&rdquo; from their rectilinear 
motion. He believed that these deviations from strict determinism were nec-
essary to explain the existence of free will. Epicurus taught that the universe 
is infinite and that our Earth is just one of countless worlds that constantly 
form and decay in an infinite space (Fig. 1.1).
</p>
<p>Another important direction of thought originated with Pythagoras (6th 
century BC), who believed that mathematical relations were at the heart of 
all physical phenomena. Pythagoras was the first to call the heavens cosmos, 
which means order. He suggested that the Earth, the Sun, and other celes-
tial bodies are perfect spheres and move in perfect circles around a central 
fire, which cannot be seen by human eyes. Think about how different this is 
from the random aggregates of atoms envisioned by Epicurus!
</p>
<p>In the 4th century BC, Plato and then Aristotle proposed more elaborate 
versions of this picture, placing the Earth at the center of the universe, with </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Origins of Scientific Cosmology     5
</p>
<p>the planets, the Sun and the stars attached to translucent spheres rotating 
about the center. This was a decidedly finite universe, where the stars were 
placed on the outermost sphere.
</p>
<p>The Greeks made very accurate observations of the planets, and already 
in the 3rd century BC it had become evident that the simple model of con-
centric spheres could not adequately explain the observed motion of the 
planets. Further refinements of the model were getting more accurate, at 
the expense of becoming more complicated. First, the centers of the spheres 
were displaced by certain amounts from the Earth. Then came the idea of 
epicycles: each planet moves around a small circle, whose center rotates 
around a large circle, as shown in Fig. 1.2. Epicycles explained why planets 
seem to move backward and forward on the sky, and why they appear to be 
brighter during the periods of backward motion.
</p>
<p>In some cases epicycles had to be added on top of other epicycles. All of 
these ideas were consolidated by Claudius Ptolemy in his book Almagest 
(The Great System), in the 2nd century AD. Ptolemy&rsquo;s mathematical model 
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 Epicurus (341&ndash;270 BC) taught philosophy in the garden of his house in 
Athens, where he regularly met with a small group of followers over a simple 
meal. The group included women and one of his slaves. Epicurus was a prolific 
writer, but almost all of his writings have vanished. Epicurean philosophy flour-
ished in ancient Greece and Rome for several centuries, but was banished in the 
Christian world, because of its uncompromising materialism. Its most complete 
exposition came to us in a magnificent poem &ldquo;On the Nature of Things&rdquo;, written 
in the first century AD by the Roman poet Lucretius. The poem was lost for more 
than a thousand years and was rediscovered in a German monastery in 1417, just 
in time to influence the development of ideas during the Renaissance</p>

</p>
<p>of the universe endured for fourteen hundred years. It accounted for all 
known astronomical data and also made accurate predictions.
</p>
<p>The dismantling of the Ptolemaic worldview began in the 16th century 
with the work of Nicolaus Copernicus. He wanted to restore the ideal of 
perfect circular motion by placing the Sun at the center of the universe, and 
allowing the Earth to move around it in a circular orbit (this idea actually 
goes back to Aristarchus in the 3rd century BC). As the Earth circles around 
the Sun, the planets appear to move backward and forward across the sky, 
removing the &ldquo;need&rdquo; for epicycles. Copernicus devoted his life to the compu-
tation of heliocentric orbits and published his work in the book On the revo-

<p>Despite its tremendous impact, it was not immediately clear that the 
Copernican system was superior to that of Ptolemy. Copernicus discovered 
that the simple model of circular orbits did not fit the data well enough. 
Ultimately, he also had to introduce epicycles, and even then he could 
not match the accuracy of Ptolemy&rsquo;s Almagest. Despite these setbacks, 
Copernicus still deserves to be immortalized for his greatest achievement&mdash;
removing the Earth from the center of the universe. It has been downhill for 
the Earth ever since then,1 but more on that later.

reversed relative to the background stars. Credit Daniel V. Schroeder

<p>1In fact, removing the Earth from the center of the universe was not necessarily viewed as a demotion. 
In those days the further out you went from the center, the closer you got to the heavenly celestial realm.</p>

<p>1.2 Origins of Scientific Cosmology     7
</p>
<p>The next great astronomical breakthrough was made by Johannes Kepler 
in the early 1600s. After nearly three decades of studying the data amassed 
by his eccentric mentor Tycho Brahe, Kepler discovered that planets actually 
move along elliptical orbits. He realized the importance of his work, but was 
still very disappointed, because he believed that circles are more perfect than 
ellipses. Kepler had other mystical beliefs&mdash;in answer to the mystery of why 
each planet followed its particular orbit, he suggested that the planet grasped 
it with its mind! (Fig. 1.3).
</p>
<p>Then along came Isaac Newton, who had very different ideas about how 
the laws of Nature operate. In his seminal book Philosophiae naturalis prin-
cipia mathematica (1687), now known as the Principia, he showed how to 
derive the elliptical orbits of the planets from his three laws of motion and 
the law of universal gravitation. He postulated that the laws of Nature apply 
to all bodies, in all places and at all times. Newton&rsquo;s laws are mathemati-
cal equations that determine how physical bodies move from one moment 
to the next, describing a universe which functions like a giant clockwork 
mechanism. To set the clockwork up, one only needs to specify the initial 
conditions&mdash;the positions and velocities of all physical objects at some ini-
tial moment of time. Newton believed these were provided by God. We will 
return to Newton and his laws in some detail, but for now we jump ahead a 
few hundred years to outline what we know today.

<p>1.3  Cosmology Today

<p>Despite its ancient roots, scientific cosmology is a relatively young sci-
ence. Most of what we know about the universe has been learned within 
the last 100 years. In broad-brush strokes, we have discovered that our Sun

<p>Fig. 1.3 Kepler discovered that planetary orbits are ellipses. (What is an ellipse? 
Consider two points, called the foci. An ellipse is the locus of points such that the 
sum of the distances to each focus is constant.) The Sun is located at one of the 
focal points of the ellipse, while the other focus is empty. For planets in the Solar 
System, the two foci of the ellipse are very close to one another, so the orbits are 
nearly circular. In this figure the ellipse is exaggerated</p>

<p>8     1 A Historical Overview

<p>belongs to a huge disk-like conglomeration of about three hundred billion 
stars, known as the Milky Way galaxy. Not only is the Sun merely one out 
of hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way is itself only 
one out of hundreds of billions of galaxies that are scattered throughout the 
observable universe. Furthermore, Edwin Hubble showed (1929) that these 
distant galaxies are not just suspended at rest throughout space. Rather, they 
are rushing away from us, and each other, at very high speeds as the entire 
universe expands (Fig. 1.4).
</p>
<p>If we extrapolate this expansion backwards in time, we realize that the uni-
verse was once much denser and much hotter. In fact, we believe that the 
universe as we know it originated some 14 billion years ago in a great explo-
sion called the big bang. At that time, all of space was filled with an extremely 
hot, dense, and rapidly expanding &ldquo;fireball&rdquo;&mdash;a mixture of sub-atomic parti-
cles and radiation. As it expanded, the fireball cooled, along the way produc-
ing nuclei and atoms, stars and galaxies, you and us! In 1965, Arno Penzias 
and Robert Wilson discovered a faint remnant of the primordial fireball. 
They found that the entire universe is bathed in a sea of low-intensity micro-
waves,2 known as the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, or CMB.

light years away. It is about the same size as the Milky Way. Credit Robert Gendler
</p>
<p>2We are all familiar with x-rays, visible light and radio waves from our everyday lives. All of these are 
forms of electromagnetic radiation, which we will discuss later. Microwaves are a subset of radio waves.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.3 Cosmology Today     9
</p>
<p>Although the CMB had been predicted by theorists, Penzias and Wilson 
stumbled upon it serendipitously, providing the smoking gun proof for the 
big bang theory and earning themselves a Nobel prize in the process.
</p>
<p>The big bang cosmology has its roots in Einstein&rsquo;s theory of gravity&mdash;
the general theory of relativity (1915). Solutions of Einstein&rsquo;s equations 
describing an expanding universe were found by the Russian mathemati-
cian Alexander Friedmann (1922), and independently by the Belgian priest 
Georges Lemaitre (1927). The idea that the early universe was hot was intro-
duced by the Russian expatriate George Gamow. Gamow wanted to explain 
the abundances of different chemical elements that we now observe in the 
universe. He argued that the hot primordial fireball was the furnace where 
the elements were forged by nuclear reactions. In 1948 Gamow and his col-
leagues Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman successfully calculated the abun-
dances of hydrogen and helium produced during the big bang. They also 
tried to explain the abundances of heavier elements in the periodic table, but 
alas, here they were unsuccessful. It turns out that heavy elements are not 
synthesized during the big bang, but rather are produced in the interiors of 
stars. We will return to this part of our ancient history in more detail later. 
But suffice it to say, by the mid 1970s the major ingredients of the hot big 
bang picture were clearly outlined (Fig. 1.5).
</p>
<p>Not so long ago, cosmology was not considered to be a reputable branch 
of science. There was very little data to test theoretical models. Two Nobel 
prize winning physicists, Lev Landau and Ernest Rutherford quipped, 
respectively, &ldquo;Cosmologists are often in error, but never in doubt.&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me catch anyone talking about the universe in my lab!&rdquo; Attitudes 
changed dramatically in the 1980s and 90s, when an abundance of data 
emerged. Radio and optical astronomy flourished with computerized galaxy 
surveys and instruments like the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Cosmic 
Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. A detailed map of the distribu-
tion of galaxies in space has been compiled, showing remarkable large-scale 
structures of filaments, sheets and voids. The Hubble Space Telescope has 
captured images of galaxies so far away that it took much of the age of the 
universe for their light to reach us. By observing these distant galaxies we 
can see cosmic history unfolding. The turn of the century saw the launch 
of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite, to further 
study the image of the early universe imprinted in the Cosmic Microwave 
Background radiation. All these developments (and others) ushered in an 
era of unprecedented precision cosmology, and we are fortunate to find our-
selves living during this golden age! (Fig. 1.6).</p>

the course of several billion years, and we appeared on the scene in very recent

<p>While the hot big bang theory is supported by all observations, luckily for 
today&rsquo;s cosmologists, some intriguing questions still remain. These questions 
bring into play a combination of studies on the largest imaginable scales, 
and new theoretical insights from particle physics, on the smallest imagina-
ble scales. From the microcosm to the macrocosm, our journey has begun&hellip;

<p>In his monumental Principia, Newton formulated the general laws of 
motion and the law of universal gravitation. He then applied these laws to 
explain the motion of planets and comets, projectile trajectories, and the 
marine tides, among other things. In so doing, he showed how natural phe-
nomena could be understood using a handful of physical laws, which hold 
just as well for the &ldquo;heavenly Moon&rdquo; as for the &ldquo;Earthly apple&rdquo; (Fig. 2.1).
</p>
<p>2.1  Newton&rsquo;s Laws of Motion
</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s first law states that a body that is at rest will stay at rest, and a 
body that is moving with a constant velocity will maintain that constant 
velocity, unless it is acted upon by a force.
</p>
<p>What does this mean? Let&rsquo;s imagine we are at an ice rink and there is a 
hockey puck which has been carefully placed at rest on the ice. Now we 
stand and watch the puck. What happens? According to Newton, the puck 
will stay where it is unless someone comes by and gives it a push&mdash;that is, 
applies a force.1
</p>
<p>Now imagine we have given our little puck a push, so that it is sliding along 
the surface of the ice. We will assume that our ice rink has no friction. The 
puck will then continue to move at a constant speed in the same direction,

<p>1Even a motionless puck on frictionless ice is subject to forces. Gravity pulls the puck downwards, but 
the surface of the ice pushes back with equal and opposite force, so the total force on the puck is zero.</p>

</p>
<p>unless it hits the wall of the rink, or bumps into someone or something along 
its way. These obstructions would provide a force that would alter the puck&rsquo;s 
uniform state of motion. If our imaginary frictionless ice rink were also infi-
nite and devoid of other obstacles, the puck would coast along at the same 
velocity for eternity.

ship traveling with its engines turned off in interstellar space glides along 
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.1 Isaac Newton (1642&ndash;1726) made most of his major discoveries in 
1665&ndash;1667, shortly after receiving his Bachelor&rsquo;s degree from the University of 
Cambridge. Although Newton earned financial support for further study, the 
University closed because of the plague, and he had to return to his family home 
in Lincolnshire for 18 months. It was during this time that he discovered his 
theory of colors, the law of gravitation, and calculus. In later years, apart from 
pursuing research in physics and mathematics, Newton devoted much effort 
to alchemy and to Scriptural studies. Credit Copy of a painting by Sir Godfrey 
Kneller (1689), painted by Barrington Bramley

<p>2The law of inertia was actually discovered by Galileo and was adopted by Newton as one of his laws of 
motion.</p>

<p>2.1 Newton&rsquo;s Laws of Motion     15
</p>
<p>with a constant velocity, and provides yet another example of a body under-
going &ldquo;inertial&rdquo; motion.
</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s second law tells us that if a force is applied to a body, the body 
accelerates&mdash;meaning its velocity changes. The law can be stated mathemati-
cally as
</p>
<p>where �a is the acceleration of the body, m is its mass, and �F is the applied 
force. The acceleration is defined as the rate at which the velocity changes. 
For example, if in one second the velocity changes by one meter per second, 
then the acceleration is one meter per second per second, or one meter per 
second squared (m/s2). In general, if the velocity is in m/s, the acceleration is 
measured in m/s2.
</p>
<p>The overhead arrows indicate that force and acceleration are vector quan-
tities, which means they each have a magnitude and direction. Another 
example of a vector is velocity. The magnitude of a car&rsquo;s velocity is its speed, 
but very often we also need to know the direction in which the car is trave-
ling. In Newton&rsquo;s first law, when we say that in the absence of forces a body 
moves at a constant velocity, this means that both the magnitude and direc-
tion of the velocity remain constant. When we want to refer only to the 
magnitude of a vector quantity, we drop the overhead arrow. For example, F 
is the magnitude of �F and a = F/m means that the magnitude of the accel-
eration is given by the magnitude of the force divided by the mass.
</p>
<p>We can arrange an experiment in which the same force is applied to two 
different masses. Equation (2.1) tells us that the acceleration of the larger 
mass will be less than the acceleration of the smaller mass. Thus mass is a 
measure of a body&rsquo;s resistance to acceleration. More massive objects are 
harder to accelerate.
</p>
<p>Force is measured in Newtons, which can be expressed in terms of other 
units as: 1 N = 1 kg m/s2. One Newton is the force required to accelerate a 
one kilogram (1 kg) mass at 1 m/s2. It is important to remember that physi-
cal quantities only have meaning when we specify units. For example, if 
someone asks you how old you are and you reply 240, they would think 
you&rsquo;re crazy. However, if you said 240 months, they would probably con-
vert that to 20 years, and think it just a little odd that you chose to measure 
your age in months instead of years. It is also essential to use consistent units 
throughout any calculation.
</p>
<p>A common misconception is to think that the direction of an applied 
force is always the same as the direction of motion. We need to remember 
</p>
<p>(2.1)�a = �F/m</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16     2 Newton&rsquo;s Universe
</p>
<p>that a net force acting on an object produces an acceleration in the same 
direction as the force, but the velocity of the object might be in a different 
direction. For example, suppose you are traveling in your car at a uniform 
speed, and then you apply the brakes. The force your brakes apply is in the 
opposite direction to motion, although your declining velocity is still in the 
original direction.
</p>
<p>We have been discussing Newton&rsquo;s laws governing the motion of objects.3 
Although we are all familiar with velocities and accelerations from our 
 everyday experience, it is important to point out that when we say an object 
is moving, we need to specify what it is moving with respect to. This defines 
a &ldquo;reference frame&rdquo;. For example, during dinner on an airplane, your food 
tray is motionless relative to your lap, although relative to the ground it is 
traveling as fast as the plane. We can call your lap a &ldquo;frame of reference&rdquo; (the 
one in which the tray is still) and the ground is another, different frame of 
reference (relative to this frame the tray is moving very fast). So, a reference 
frame is an object relative to which we measure the locations and motions of 
other objects.
</p>
<p>An inertial frame of reference is a frame associated with an object that is 
not acted upon by any net force and is moving by inertia. Once we spec-
ify one inertial frame of reference, any other frame that is moving with a 
constant velocity relative to the chosen frame, is also an inertial frame of 
 reference. For example, the room you are in now is an inertial frame of ref-
erence (approximately).4 Any train outside that is moving with a constant 
speed relative to the room is also an inertial reference frame. Newton&rsquo;s laws 
apply in all inertial frames of reference, thus any experiment you do in your 
room will yield the same results as the identical experiment performed by a 
friend on one of those trains.
</p>
<p>2.2  Newtonian Gravity
</p>
<p>Every day we experience the force of gravity. Gravity is an attractive  force&mdash; 
it brings objects together. Every atom in our bodies is attracted to the 
Earth. Furthermore, every atom in the Earth is attracted to us. In fact any 
</p>
<p>3Newton also formulated a third law, which states that in every interaction between two bodies, the 
force the first body exerts on the second body is equal and opposite to the force the second body exerts 
on the first. If you push your friend facing you on an ice-rink, she will coast backwards, but so will you.
4The Earth is not exactly an inertial frame because of its rotation about its axis, which can be observed 
with a Foucault pendulum.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Newtonian Gravity     17
</p>
<p>two objects in the Universe exert a gravitational attraction on one another. 
Newton realized that the same kind of force responsible for an apple falling 
from a tree was also responsible for the revolution of the Moon around the 
Earth, and the Earth around the Sun (see Fig. 2.2). Thus his law of gravity 
is sometimes called The Law of Universal Gravitation, applying both to the 
Earthly and the heavenly realm.
</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s law of gravity states that any two objects are attracted to one 
another with a force

<p>Fig. 2.2 Newton&rsquo;s thought experiment. Suppose a cannon is placed on top of 
a mountain and is fired with a moderate muzzle velocity. What will happen to 
the projectile? It will fall to Earth as shown at point D. If the muzzle velocity is 
increased it will fall a little farther away, as shown at points E, F, and B. Newton 
deduced that if the projectile is launched with progressively larger velocities, 
eventually, at just the right launch velocity, it will travel all the way around the 
Earth in a circular path, always falling in towards the Earth, but never reaching 
it, as indicated at A. Newton concluded that the Moon&rsquo;s orbit was of the same 
nature, with the Moon constantly falling toward the Earth. He also realized 
that if the launch velocity got higher, then elliptical orbits would be possible as 
shown. Credit  Philosophae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18     2 Newton&rsquo;s Universe
</p>
<p>where M and m are the masses of the two objects and r is the distance 
between them. The force acting on mass m is directed towards the mass M 
and vice versa (see Fig. 2.3). We have also introduced Newton&rsquo;s gravitational 
constant G, which has a measured value of G = 6.67&times;10&minus;11 Nm2/kg2.
</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s law of gravity is an &ldquo;inverse square law&rdquo;, because in Eq. (2.2) 
the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance 
between the two objects. For example, let M be the mass of the Earth and m 
the mass of the Moon. If the Moon were placed twice as far away from the 
Earth as its actual distance, then the Earth would exert a force of gravity on 
the Moon that is one quarter as strong as it currently is.
</p>
<p>The masses in Eq. (2.2) are assumed to be &ldquo;point masses&rdquo;; that is, we 
assume that their sizes can be neglected, so we can imagine that each mass is 
located at a point. This is a good approximation for the Earth&mdash;Moon sys-
tem: the sizes of the Earth and the Moon are much smaller than the distance 
between them, so they can be approximated as point masses located at their 
centers. Then, to calculate the gravitational force of attraction, we use the 
distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the Moon. The same 
logic applies to the Earth orbiting the Sun.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Newton proved the &ldquo;shell theorem&rdquo;, which states two 
important facts: (1) A uniform spherical shell of matter attracts an outside 
object as if all of the shell&rsquo;s mass were concentrated at its center. This applies 
to any uniform spherically symmetric object, like a solid sphere, since the 
object can be thought of as consisting of shells. (2) The gravitational force 
exerted on an object that is inside a uniform spherical shell of matter is zero. 
This result is surprising. The object doesn&rsquo;t even have to be at the center of 
the spherical shell&mdash;it can be anywhere inside the shell, and it will still feel 
no force.5

masses and added together the forces produced by all of these masses. He had to invent calculus to per-
form this calculation!</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Newtonian Gravity     19
</p>
<p>To find the force of gravity acting on a small object near the surface of 
the Earth, we can imagine that the Earth (which is nearly spherical) is com-
posed of a large number of thin concentric shells. Each shell will act as if 
all its mass is localized at the center, so the overall effect will be as if the 
entire mass of the Earth is localized at its center. Note that we do not have 
to assume that the mass density is uniform throughout the volume: each 
individual shell must have a uniform density, but the density can vary from 
one shell to the next. (In fact, the density of Earth is much greater near the 
center than near the surface.) (Fig. 2.4).
</p>
<p>2.3  Acceleration of Free Fall
</p>
<p>In everyday terms we often confuse weight and mass. When we get on a 
scale, we measure our weight&mdash;this is the force of gravity which pulls us 
towards the center of the Earth. For a small object of mass m near the sur-
face of the Earth, the weight is given by

m is its 
</p>
<p>radius. On the Moon, we would weigh about 1/6 of our Earthly weight, 
even though our bodies would have the exact same amount of mass. The 
force of gravity on any object on the surface of the Moon is weaker than 
the gravitational force on that same object on the surface of the Earth. 
This is because the Earth has so much more mass than the Moon, that

Now let&rsquo;s consider what happens if we have an object of mass m, close

<p>to the surface of the Earth, and we let it go. It will fall with acceleration 
a = F/m, which becomes (using Eq. (2.3) for F),
</p>
<p>This does not depend on the mass m, which means that all bodies close to 
the surface of the Earth fall with the same acceleration, independent of their 
mass (as long as we ignore air resistance). This remarkable fact was estab-
lished by Galileo. The acceleration of free fall is denoted by the letter g; its 
measured value is g = 9.8 m/s2. So, if we drop any object off a building, it 
will fall down with a velocity which increases by 9.8 m/s every second. Thus, 
after the first second the object will have a velocity of 9.8 m/s; after the sec-
ond, it will have a velocity of 19.6 m/s and so on (assuming the object is sim-
ply let go, with an initial velocity of zero). From Eq. (2.4) we see that

<p>Substituting the values of ME, rE and G (Newton&rsquo;s constant), you can verify 
that indeed g = 9.8 m/s2.

acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time. When we travel at a 
constant speed and in a constant direction, our acceleration is zero. What 
happens if we travel around a large circular track at a constant speed? Do we 
accelerate? Yes, we do. Even though we maintain a strictly uniform speed, 
we constantly have to change the direction in which we are traveling. This

<p>change in direction indicates that there is an acceleration. For uniform circu-
lar motion, the magnitude of the acceleration is
</p>
<p>where v is the speed of the object undergoing the motion and r is the radius 
of the circle. The direction of the acceleration is radially inward, towards the 
center of the circle (see Fig. 2.5); it is called the centripetal acceleration.6 If 
you have ever swirled an object attached to a string above your head, you 
know that the tension in the string keeps the object from flying off at a tan-
gent to its orbit. The string thus provides a force directed towards your hand 
that results in the object undergoing centripetal acceleration.
</p>
<p>Newton showed in his Principia that the inverse square law implies that 
celestial bodies like planets and comets should move in elliptical orbits, in 
agreement with Kepler. While comets often move in highly eccentric orbits, 
for planets the two focal points of the ellipse almost coincide, so the orbit is 
approximately a circle. If the radius of the orbit is r, its circumference is 2πr, 
and the velocity of the planet is

<p>where T  is the time it takes to complete one revolution.
We can now apply what we have learned about Newton&rsquo;s laws to weigh 
</p>
<p>the Sun. Let&rsquo;s do it!
We know that the force keeping the Earth in motion around the Sun 
</p>
<p>is gravity; thus Eq. (2.2) holds, with m the Earth&rsquo;s mass, and M the Sun&rsquo;s 
mass. We also know that to a good approximation the Earth orbits the Sun 
with uniform velocity in a circle and thus undergoes centripetal acceleration 
(gravity is the force responsible for this centripetal acceleration). Then, sub-
stituting Eq. (2.6) into Eq. (2.1) and equating this with Eq. (2.2) we find 
</p>
<p>F = m
v
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>r
= GmM/r2.
</p>
<p>Rearranging, the Sun&rsquo;s mass is given by
</p>
<p>where the Earth&rsquo;s orbital velocity v &asymp; 30 km/s can be calculated from Eq. (2.7) 
using our knowledge that it takes the Earth one year (T &asymp; 3 &times; 107 s) to com-
plete one orbit at a distance of r &asymp; 1.5 &times; 108 km. This method is often used 
in astronomy to measure the masses of stars,  galaxies, and even clusters of 
 galaxies.
</p>
<p>2.5  Energy Conservation and Escape Velocity
</p>
<p>Energy is nature&rsquo;s ultimate currency&mdash;it comes in several different forms, 
and can be converted from one form to another. For example, to launch a 
rocket into space, chemical energy must be converted into kinetic energy of 
motion. In general, the conservation of energy is one of the most fundamen-
tal laws of nature.
</p>
<p>Here we will focus on mechanical energy. Mechanical energy can be 
divided into two types: kinetic energy and potential energy. Kinetic energy is 
the energy an object has by virtue of its motion. An object of mass m trave-
ling with speed v has kinetic energy
</p>
<p>Potential energy is the energy a system has due to interactions between 
its parts. It can be thought of as stored energy that has the capacity to be 
unleashed and turned into kinetic energy. There is no universal formula for 
the potential energy; it depends on the kind of interaction. In the case of 
gravitational interaction between two spherical masses, it is given by
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.5 Energy Conservation and Escape Velocity     23
</p>
<p>where r is the distance between the centers of the spheres.7 If there are more 
than two masses, one simply has to add the potential energies for all pairs.
</p>
<p>For a small object close to the Earth&rsquo;s surface, the potential energy 
(Eq. 2.10) can be approximated by the following useful formula:
</p>
<p>Here, m is the object&rsquo;s mass, h is its height above the ground (h = r &minus; rE 
where r is its distance from the center of the Earth, and rE is the Earth&rsquo;s 
radius), and g = 9.8 m/s2 is the gravitational acceleration close to the Earth&rsquo;s 
surface.
</p>
<p>The constant in Eq. (21.1) is &minus;GMEm/rE, where ME is the mass of the 
Earth. Such constant additions to the energy are unimportant for most 
 purposes and are often omitted.
</p>
<p>The total energy of the system is the sum of its kinetic and potential 
 energies,
</p>
<p>In an isolated system, to which no external forces are applied, the total 
energy is conserved&mdash;that is, it does not change with time. This is an 
immensely useful property, which makes the solution of many problems 
much easier than it would otherwise be.
</p>
<p>A ball of mass m in a frictionless U-shaped track provides a classic exam-
ple of the interplay between potential and kinetic energy (see Fig. 2.6). Let&rsquo;s 
place the ball on the left arm of the track, so that it is at a height h above 
the bottom of the track. We will let go of the ball, and it will start rolling. 
The ball&rsquo;s initial speed will be zero, but as it rolls down the track it picks up 
speed, attaining its maximum velocity at the bottom of the track (techni-
cally the ball has a rotational velocity in addition to its translational velocity, 
which we will ignore here for clarity. In other words, we will treat the ball as 
though it is &ldquo;sliding&rdquo; down the track). It will then rise up the right arm of

GMm
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>(2.11)U = mgh + const
</p>
<p>(2.12)E = K + U
</p>
<p>7This formula can also be used for a small object (like a human) interacting with a large spherical body 
(like the Earth). In this case, the small object does not have to be spherical, and the distance r is the dis-
tance from any point in the object to the Earth&rsquo;s center.</p>

</p>
<p>the &ldquo;U&rdquo;, until it reaches a maximum height and momentarily comes to rest 
before rolling down the right arm.8 How high up the right arm does it get?
</p>
<p>The answer is easy. By conservation of energy, it must reach the same 
height h as it started with. When the ball is at its starting point it has no 
kinetic energy (it is released from rest), but it has gravitational potential 
energy U = mgh. When it reaches the maximum position on the right arm, 
it also has no kinetic energy, since it is momentarily at rest. So it must have 
the same amount of potential energy, thus it must reach the same height h.
</p>
<p>How fast will the ball be moving at the bottom of the &ldquo;U&rdquo;? At the bot-
tom, the ball has no potential energy because it has zero height above the 
reference ground level. Thus all its initial potential energy is converted into 
kinetic energy and we have 1
</p>
<p>2
mv2 = mgh, which can be solved to yield the 
</p>
<p>velocity at the bottom if we know h. In fact, we can find the velocity of the 
ball at any point along its motion if we know the height at that point.
</p>
<p>Similar interchange between kinetic and potential energies occurs when 
planets move around the Sun. The expression for the potential energy U to 
use in this case is Eq. (2.10). This formula can be a little tricky to deal with, 
so it is useful to consider a plot of U versus r, as shown in Fig. 2.7.
</p>
<p>We see that U approaches a maximum value of zero, when two objects are 
separated by larger and larger distances. But because the sign of the poten-
tial energy is negative, the gravitational potential energy decreases as objects 
are brought closer to each other (watch out for the minus sign!). Hence the 
</p>
<p>8You probably remember what happens when you are pulled up and released on a swing: you start from 
rest, reach a maximum speed at the bottom of your trajectory and then slow down as you swing up, 
momentarily coming to rest before going backwards, and so on.

<p>Fig. 2.6 At the top of the track, all the energy is in the form of poten-
tial energy. At the bottom, all potential energy has been converted to kinetic 
energy, and the ball has its maximum velocity. On its way up or down the track 
there is a mix of potential and kinetic energy, but the total mechanical energy is 
the same at every point along the ball&rsquo;s trajectory</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.5 Energy Conservation and Escape Velocity     25
</p>
<p>kinetic energy should grow and the objects should move faster as they get 
closer. A planet moving along its elliptic orbit speeds up as it gets closer to 
the Sun and slows down as it gets further away.
</p>
<p>The gravitational potential energy between two orbiting bodies can be 
thought of as a binding energy. The closer the two bodies are, the more neg-
ative is the potential energy, and thus we would have to work harder, or put 
in more energy, to separate them.
</p>
<p>Since mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, it is 
possible for a pair of orbiting objects to have negative, zero or positive total 
mechanical energy. When the total energy is negative, it simply means that 
the system has less kinetic energy than the magnitude of the gravitational 
potential energy. This is in fact the case for all bound orbits, like the Earth-
Moon system, the comets that orbit the Sun, or even the man-made satellites 
that orbit the Earth. Orbits with zero or positive total mechanical energy are 
said to be unbound. For example there are currently five spacecraft, Voyager 
1 and 2, Pioneer 10 and 11, and the New Horizons Spacecraft, which are 
heading out of our Solar System on unbound orbits (or escape trajectories).
</p>
<p>You might be wondering, how do we control whether a satellite we 
launch goes into orbit around the Earth, or goes off into the Solar System? 
The answer is very simple. There is a minimum initial speed, called 
the escape speed, with which the object must be launched in order for it 
to escape from the Earth. So, how do we calculate this escape speed? We 
use the principle of energy conservation and the fact that for the object to 
escape, its total mechanical energy must be greater than or equal to zero. 
Let&rsquo;s say we launch a spacecraft of mass m with speed v. Its total initial 
mechanical energy as it leaves the Earth is

</p>
<p>which must equal its total final energy Ef  when it has escaped.9 If we take 
the marginal case of zero total energy, the launch speed is by definition the 
escape velocity, and we have
</p>
<p>This can be solved to find the escape speed
</p>
<p>Substituting in values for the Earth&rsquo;s mass and radius, we find 
vesc &asymp; 11.2 km/s. So if we launch a satellite with a speed slightly greater 
than 11.2 km/s, it will leave the Earth&rsquo;s gravitational clutches. If we launch 
it with less than this speed, it will fall back to Earth. And if we launch it 
at exactly the escape speed, it will barely escape, with its velocity getting 
smaller and smaller as it moves away and approaches zero in the limit.
</p>
<p>Note that although we have derived the escape velocity for an object 
launched from the Earth, this formula holds in general, with the Earth&rsquo;s 
mass and radius replaced by whatever body you are considering. In later 
chapters we will apply similar considerations to the entire universe. Note 
also that the escape (or no escape) outcome depends only on the magnitude 
of the velocity, not on its direction.
</p>
<p>2.6  Newtonian Cosmology
</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s cosmological ideas developed during a correspondence with the 
Cambridge theologian Richard Bentley. Bentley was preparing to give pub-
lic lectures titled &ldquo;A confutation of atheism&rdquo; and wrote to Newton asking 
him how his theory of gravity applied to the universe as a whole. During the 
winter of 1692&ndash;93, Newton sent a series of four letters to Bentley, in which 
he described a universe that is infinite and static: &ldquo;The fixed stars, being 
equally spread out in all points of the heavens, cancel out their mutual pulls 
by opposite attractions.&rdquo;

<p>.
</p>
<p>9Note that the final energy is purely kinetic and must therefore be positive. This says that only objects 
with positive (or zero in the marginal case) total energy can escape.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.6 Newtonian Cosmology     27
</p>
<p>However, as Newton was acutely aware, there is a problem with this line 
of reasoning. If a region of the universe has a slight excess of matter, then 
that region will begin to attract material from its surroundings. The region 
will become denser, and it will attract more and more matter. Thus a uni-
form distribution of stars is unstable due to gravity: it would be destroyed by 
an arbitrarily small perturbation. Newton&rsquo;s solution was to invoke a super-
natural intervention, stating &ldquo;&hellip;this frame of things could not always subsist 
without a divine power to conserve it.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>2.7  Olbers&rsquo; Paradox
</p>
<p>What do you think the Sun would look like if it were at twice its present 
distance from the Earth? The total brightness of the Sun would be four 
times smaller because the brightness of an object decreases as the inverse 
square of the distance to the object.10 The area of the Sun&rsquo;s disc on the sky 
would also be four times smaller. This means that the brightness per unit 
area (called the surface brightness) remains the same. So what? Well, in an 
infinite universe that is uniformly sprinkled with stars, every line of sight 
should eventually hit a star, and each star should have roughly the same sur-
face brightness as the Sun. This implies that the whole sky should be glow-
ing with the same intensity as the Sun&rsquo;s surface. So why is the sky dark at 
night? This paradox is known as Olbers&rsquo; paradox or the &ldquo;dark night sky 
paradox&rdquo;. It indicates that Newton&rsquo;s picture of the universe cannot be right 
(Fig. 2.8).
</p>
<p>An infinite static universe has other problems in addition to the gravi-
tational instability and Olbers&rsquo; paradox. We shall return to this issue in 
Chap. 5. For now, we just note that the problems of Newtonian cosmology 
give a foretaste of things to come: it is not so easy to come up with a cosmo-
logical model that makes any sense at all.
</p>
<p>While Newton showed that his universal law of gravity could explain a vast 
scope of natural phenomena, he was at a loss to explain how it could be that 
the force of gravity acts instantaneously, between every pair of particles, across 
the vastness of space. This mysterious action-at-a-distance fueled Newton&rsquo;s crit-
ics. At the end of his Principia, Newton conceded: &ldquo;Thus far I have explained 
the phenomena of the heavens and our sea by the force of gravity, but I have not yet

<p>assigned a cause to gravity&hellip;. I have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena 
the reason for these properties of gravity and I do not feign hypotheses,&rdquo; but he then 
went on to declare &ldquo;And it is enough that gravity really exists and acts according 
to the laws that we have set forth and is sufficient to explain all the motions of the 
heavenly bodies and of our sea.&rdquo; Despite these rumblings, Newton&rsquo;s description of 
gravity held sway for two hundred years&mdash;until Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of rela-
tivity revolutionized our understanding of gravity once again, as we shall later 
learn.
</p>
<p>Summary
Newtonian mechanics forms the foundation for our understanding of the 
physical universe. We used Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion and his universal law of 
gravity to explore planetary orbits, energy conservation and escape  velocities. 
We then discussed Newton&rsquo;s cosmological picture of an infinite,  static uni-
verse uniformly filled with stars. Amongst other problems, this picture is 
incompatible with the observation of a dark night sky&mdash;this is known as 
Olbers&rsquo; paradox. The problems of Newton&rsquo;s static universe give us an inkling 
of how difficult it is to develop a sensible cosmology.

<p>3.1  The Principle of Relativity
</p>
<p>Although the word &ldquo;relativity&rdquo; is synonymous with Albert Einstein, Galileo 
Galilei was actually the first scientist to formulate what we now call &ldquo;the 
principle of relativity&rdquo;. In his famous Dialogue (1632), Galileo suggested 
to his readers that they should shut themselves up in the cabin of a ship, 
below the decks, so that they could not see what was going on outside. He 
argued that they would not be able to tell whether the ship was stationary 
or  moving, as long as the motion was uniform (that is, at a constant speed) 
and in the same direction, without any turns. While the ship was the vehicle 
of choice in Galileo&rsquo;s time, all of us can recall a similar experience in a train 
or an airplane. When the ride is smooth and you do not look outside, you 
cannot tell whether you are moving or not. Moreover, at this very moment 
you are moving with the Earth around the Sun at a speed of 30 km/s, and 
with the entire Solar System around the galactic center at about 230 km/s. 
These tremendous velocities have no effect whatsoever on anything we per-
ceive here on Earth (Fig. 3.1).
</p>
<p>The principle of relativity asserts that the laws of physics apply equally 
to all inertial observers. So if one inertial observer glides past another one, 
it is meaningless to ask which of the two observers is at rest and which is 
 moving. There is no such thing as absolute rest or absolute motion: only rel-
ative motion has meaning (Fig. 3.2).
</p>
<p>All of this was well understood and agreed upon since the time of Galileo 
and Newton, except for a rather mysterious problem that suddenly emerged

<p>near the end of the 19th century. The problem involved the speed of light, 
which was measured to be about 300,000 km/s. The issue was, speed with 
respect to what? When we say that the speed of sound is 300 m/s, it is 
understood that sound propagates through the air to the observer from its 
source. Thus an observer, who is at rest with respect to the air, will measure 
this value for the speed of sound.
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.1 Galileo (1564&ndash;1642) is often called the father of modern science. He 
experimented with balls rolling down inclined planes, which led him to deduce the 
law of inertia, and also the law of free fall, which states that all objects, regardless 
of their mass, fall to the earth with the same acceleration. Galileo was also the 
first person to point a telescope to the sky, revealing that there are thousands of 
stars invisible to the naked eye; that four moons orbit Jupiter; and that Venus goes 
through crescent and gibbous phases like the moon. These astronomical obser-
vations provided evidence for the Copernican heliocentric system, which he then 
endeavored to convince the world of in his book Dialogue on the Two Chief World 
Systems, Copernican and Ptolemaic (1632). The book ran contrary to the official 
dogma and was banned the following year by the church (The church allowed 
 discussion of the Copernican system, as long as it was presented as a theory, not as 
fact. The true nature of the universe had to be deduced from Scriptures, not from 
astronomical observations). At age 70, Galileo was tried by the Inquisition, forced 
to recant, and then spent the rest of his life under house arrest</p>
<p/>

<p>3.1 The Principle of Relativity     33
</p>
<p>The situation with light was expected to be very similar. Scientists were 
convinced there should be some substance through which light propa-
gates; the so-called ether. Then, if we are at rest with respect to the ether, 
we should find that light propagates in all directions at the same speed of 
300,000 km/s (see Fig. 3.3). But what if we are moving through the ether 
at a speed of, say, 100,000 km/s? Then a light pulse propagating in the same 
direction will only move at 200,000 km/s relative to us, while a pulse propa-
gating in the opposite direction will speed away from us at 400,000 km/s. 
The speed of light in the directions orthogonal to our motion would remain 
unchanged at 300,000 km/s. Thus, in a space filled with ether, inertial 
observers who move at different speeds will no longer be equivalent. They 
will observe that the speed of light is direction-dependent, and they can use 
this to deduce their own speed with respect to the ether. 
</p>
<p>An ingenious apparatus for measuring the difference between the speeds 
of light in two orthogonal directions was designed by Albert Michelson 
of the Case School in Cleveland and Edward Morley of the neighboring 
Western Reserve College. They knew that if our speed through the ether 
was as high as 100,000 km/s, then the direction-dependence of the speed 
of light would have been noticed in earlier experiments. Thus, Michelson 
and Morley expected to measure a much smaller number&mdash;which required 
a much higher accuracy. They figured that, if nothing else, the Earth&rsquo;s 
speed through the ether should not be much smaller than the speed of its

<p> revolution around the Sun, which is 30 km/s. Fortunately this was well 
within the measurement capabilities of their instrument.
</p>
<p>Michelson and Morley performed their experiment in July of 1887. The 
result was startling: they detected no variation in the speed of light in differ-
ent directions. None whatsoever. To ensure that the Earth&rsquo;s motion around 
the Sun at the time of the experiment was not accidentally compensated 
by the motion of the whole Solar System through the ether in the opposite 
direction, Michelson and Morley repeated the experiment six months later. 
By that time, the Earth completed half a revolution and was moving in the 
opposite direction, so if the two velocities initially cancelled, they must now 
add up, and the Earth should be moving through the ether at the speed of 
60 km/s. But again, no effect was found.
</p>
<p>A straightforward reading of their results suggested that the speed of light 
does not depend on the speed of the observer who measures it. This looked 
completely absurd and in conflict not only with Newtonian physics, but also

<p>with common sense. So most physicists simply chose to ignore the results of 
the experiment.
</p>
<p>The resolution of the paradox came in 1905 from a twenty six year old 
clerk working in the patent office in Bern, Switzerland. His name was Albert 
Einstein. He accepted the constancy of the speed of light as a fact and used 
it as a basis for a theory of stunning beauty. As for Newtonian physics and 
common sense, they had to go. So did the ether.
</p>
<p>3.2  The Speed of Light and Electromagnetism
</p>
<p>The truth is that the Michelson-Morley experiment played little role in 
convincing Einstein that the speed of light is the same for all observers. He 
had other reasons for postulating the constancy of the speed of light, which 
had to do with the theory of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk 
Maxwell in the mid-19th century (Fig. 3.4).
</p>
<p>As a child, you probably enjoyed playing with magnets and making your 
hair &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; by bringing your freshly rubbed plastic ruler close by. At 
the time, you probably thought of magnetic and electric forces as two com-
pletely separate phenomena. But today, you may know something that even 
Kepler, Galileo and Newton did not: electricity and magnetism are two sides 
of the same &ldquo;electromagnetic coin&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The theory of electromagnetism describes the behavior of electric and 
magnetic fields, which are produced by static electric charges and by  flowing 
electric charges, called currents (see Figs. 3.5 and 3.6). For example, the 
Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is produced by the electric currents flowing in its 
core. The field is present everywhere in space and becomes manifest when 
you hold out a compass. The compass needle will point in the direction of 
the field, and the field strength can be judged by how forcefully the  needle 
swings in that direction. Similarly, an electric field permeates the space 
around bodies carrying positive or negative electric charges. The electric field 
causes attraction between opposite charges and repulsion between same-sign 
charges.
</p>
<p>Maxwell expressed his theory in the form of eight equations that describe 
all electric and magnetic phenomena. The theory also made two very 
 important predictions:
</p>
<p>1. Oscillating electric and magnetic fields propagate through space as 
 electromagnetic waves, and
</p>
<p>2. The speed of an electromagnetic wave is 300,000 km/s.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36     3 Special Relativity
</p>
<p>Maxwell, of course, recognized this speed as the speed of light.1 He thus 
came to a remarkable realization that light must be electromagnetic waves.
</p>
<p>An electromagnetic wave is characterized by its wavelength, which can be 
defined as the distance from one &ldquo;crest&rdquo; of the wave to the next (see Fig. 3.7). 
Another useful characteristic is the frequency, defined as the number of crests 
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.4 James Clerk Maxwell (1831&ndash;1879) developed a unified description of 
electric and magnetic phenomena. He introduced the fundamental concept of 
a field, which now plays a central role in physics. Electric and magnetic fields 
propagate through space as electromagnetic waves, and Maxwell suggested 
that light must be a form of electromagnetic radiation. In the words of Nobel 
 laureate Max Planck, he &ldquo;achieved greatness unequalled.&rdquo; And yet, Maxwell&rsquo;s 
theory was largely ignored for more than 20 years after its publication. Maxwell 
was a shy and gentle person. He wrote poetry and felt a great affinity to ani-
mals. His writing was a model of clarity, but his conversation and lectures were 
rather confusing: he jumped from one subject to another, as his speech could 
not keep up with the pace of his thoughts. Maxwell died of cancer at the age of 
48, well before his theory was widely accepted
</p>

denote it by the letter c.</p>

tion opens a unique window through which we can observe our radiant uni-
verse.
</p>
<p>The theory of light as an electromagnetic wave is a pillar of classical phys-
ics. However, in some circumstances, such as when light interacts with 
atoms, it is necessary to adopt the viewpoint of quantum physics, which 
describes light as consisting of particles, called photons. In this modern pic-
ture, an ordinary light wave is thought to be composed of a huge number 
of photons that travel together. Each photon is electrically neutral and has 
a measurable energy and momentum. The energy of a photon is related to 
its wavelength. Blue light photons are more energetic than photons of the 
longer-wavelength red light. And gamma ray photons are much more ener-
getic than the photons of visible light. For the rest of this chapter we can 
think of light as a classical electromagnetic wave.
</p>
<p>3.3  Einstein&rsquo;s Postulates
</p>
<p>In the early 1900s Einstein started to wonder what would happen if he fol-
lowed Galileo&rsquo;s advice and locked himself up in the cabin of a ship (Fig. 
3.9). Would he be able to detect the uniform motion of the ship by per-
forming experiments with electric charges and currents? His intuition said 
&ldquo;no&rdquo;. In other words, he believed that Maxwell&rsquo;s laws of electromagnetism 
are equally valid in both uniformly moving and stationary cabins. But then 
the speed of light should also be the same and it should equal 300,000 km/s, 
as required by Maxwell&rsquo;s theory.
</p>
<p>In his celebrated 1905 paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies, 
where he first presented his special theory of relativity, Einstein postulated 
two fundamental assumptions:
</p>
<p>(1)  The laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. This is 
Galileo&rsquo;s principle of relativity.
</p>
<p>(2) The speed of light measured by all inertial observers is the same.
</p>
<p>It follows from the second postulate that there is no ether2: electromagnetic 
waves propagate through empty space. Note also that the second postulate 
 follows from the first if Maxwell&rsquo;s theory is included among the laws of 
physics.
</p>
<p>2Otherwise the speed of light would vary depending on the observer&rsquo;s speed relative to the ether.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40     3 Special Relativity
</p>
<p>From these two simple assumptions, Einstein led us directly to the 
 relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, length contraction and the equiva-
lence between mass and energy. We will discuss each one of these in turn.
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.9 Albert Einstein&rsquo;s career in physics had a bumpy start. After graduating 
from Zurich Polytechnic, he got no job offers in academia and thought himself 
lucky to find a job as a clerk at the patent office in Berne. On the  positive side, 
the job was not very demanding and left plenty of time for Einstein&rsquo;s research 
and other intellectual pursuits. He spent evenings with friends, playing violin, 
reading philosophy and discussing his physics ideas. It was during this period 
that Einstein had his annus mirabilis (1905), publishing in the same year his 
special theory of relativity and his groundbreaking work on quantum mechanics. 
From this point on, Einstein&rsquo;s career took off, and within a few years he had 
job offers from several major universities in Europe. In 1919, when the light 
deflection predicted by general relativity was confirmed by observation, his 
fame reached the level of a pop star, and Einstein became a household name. 
He quipped that &ldquo;To punish me for my contempt for authority, fate made me 
an authority myself.&rdquo; In his later years, Einstein often invoked God to express 
his philosophical views. He said, for example, &ldquo;God does not play dice with 
the universe&rdquo;, expressing his doubts about the probabilistic interpretation of 
quantum mechanics, and &ldquo;What really interests me is whether God had any 
choice in the creation of the world.&rdquo; He clarified, however, that &ldquo;I believe in 
Spinoza&rsquo;s God who reveals himself in the harmony of what exists, not in a God 
who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.&rdquo; Credit Albert

</p>
<p>3.4  Simultaneity
</p>
<p>Einstein liked to perform &ldquo;thought experiments&rdquo;&mdash;he would think up 
a hypothetical experiment, and then deduce the results through logical 
 reasoning instead of making measurements. One of his famous thought 
experiments involves two observers, one in a moving train and the other sta-
tionary on the platform.
</p>
<p>Suppose Jane is standing in the middle of a moving train car, holding the 
switch of an overhead light bulb, which is initially turned off. Now she turns 
it on, and light propagates towards the front and back walls of the car. Since 
she is in the middle, light reaches the two walls at the same time. At least 
from her point of view (Fig. 3.10).
</p>
<p>Now suppose Ben is observing this experiment standing on the platform. 
He sees Jane turn on the bulb, and light propagates in both directions at the 
same speed, which is of course the speed of light. But the back wall of the 
car is moving toward the approaching beam of light, while the front wall is 
moving away from the beam, so Ben will see light reach the back wall before 
it reaches the front wall. The conclusion is that the simultaneity of events has 
no absolute meaning; it depends on the state of motion of the observer.

</p>
<p>3.5  Time Dilation
</p>
<p>In our everyday experience, a second is a second, regardless of whether we 
are waiting in line to board a plane, or if we are already in the air  cruising 
at hundreds of kilometers per hour. However, according to Einstein, this 
obvious &ldquo;fact&rdquo; is not true. More precisely, the principle of relativity, and the 
constancy of the speed of light, lead inexorably to the following conclusion: 
Moving clocks run slower as seen by an observer at rest. Once again, this can be 
illustrated with the aid of our friends Jane and Ben.
</p>
<p>Suppose now that Jane, who is in a train moving with speed v, is 
equipped with a light source, located at the floor of her train car, and a 
 mirror at a distance L directly above the source (see Fig. 3.11a). A push of 
a button sends a light pulse from the source to the mirror and back again. 
This round trip takes time t0 = 2L/c (since light travels at a constant speed 
c), as measured by Jane.
</p>
<p>Now, Ben, who is standing on the platform, sees the light pulse travel 
along a diagonal path (see Fig. 3.11b). Since the diagonal path length D is 
</p>
<p>(a) (b)
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.5 Time Dilation     43
</p>
<p>longer than the distance L, he will find that it takes a longer time t = 2D/c 
for the pulse to complete the round trip. Thus the time interval between the 
same two events (emission and return of the light pulse) is different when 
measured by different observers.
</p>
<p>In particular, the time intervals that Ben and Jane will measure are related 
by the time dilation formula3
</p>
<p>The relativistic factor γ (also called the Lorentz factor, after Hendrik Lorentz 
who first introduced it) is defined as
</p>
<p>The factor γ equals 1 when the relative velocity between two frames is zero, 
v = 0. Otherwise, it is greater than 1 and becomes arbitrarily large as the 
speed v approaches the speed of light.
</p>
<p>Consider the plot of γ as a function of increasing velocity v (see Fig. 3.12). 
At first, γ grows very slowly. For example, if Jane&rsquo;s train moves at 300 km/h, 
then γ &asymp; 1 + 10&minus;13. This means that the time dilation Ben will measure 
amounts to about 1 s in a million years. This is tiny. You need to go at a 
 sizeable fraction of the speed of light before γ differs appreciably from 1. For 
example, at 99.5% of the speed of light, time in the moving frame would go

</p>
<p>slower by a factor of 10 compared to the time on the platform (γ = 10). If 
Jane flew away in a spaceship at that speed, then from the point of view of 
us here on Earth her life expectancy would be about 800 years. But since all 
processes in her body and brain would be slowed down by a factor of 10, she 
would not necessarily accomplish much more in her lifetime than a typical 
earthling. In Jane&rsquo;s reference frame, time would flow normally in the space-
ship, but would slow down on Earth by a factor of 10.
</p>
<p>You might think it should be possible to tell who has aged less by simply 
comparing Jane&rsquo;s age with that of her friends on Earth, at some moment 
of time. However, simultaneity is relative, and different observers will 
have  different ideas about &ldquo;the same moment of time&rdquo;. Jane might decide 
to resolve this issue once and for all, by turning her spaceship around and 
heading back to Earth. Alas, she will find that the earthlings were right. If 
she went away for 10 years, 100 years will have passed on Earth. But why? If 
motion is truly relative, why can&rsquo;t we think of Jane as being stationary with 
the Earth receding? As Jane turns on the engines and reverses the velocity of 
her ship, she is no longer an inertial observer, and thus the laws of special 
relativity do not apply in her reference frame.
</p>
<p>3.6  Length Contraction
</p>
<p>Once you know that time and simultaneity are relative, you will probably 
not be shocked to learn that space is relative as well. And indeed, Einstein&rsquo;s 
thought experiments demonstrated that moving objects contract in the 
direction of motion.
</p>
<p>If L0 is the length of an object at rest, and if the object then moves past an 
observer at speed v, the observer will measure the length of the object to be4
</p>
<p>where γ is the Lorentz factor defined in Eq. (3.3).
If Jane measures the length of her spaceship to be 50 m and she flies by 
</p>
<p>the Earth at 99.5% of the speed of light, then we would find that her ship is 
only 5 m long. On the other hand, she will find the Earth and all its inhab-
itants to be squeezed tenfold in the direction of her motion (Fig. 3.13).
</p>

</p>
<p>3.6.1  Speeding Muons
</p>
<p>As intellectually chic as it may sound to talk of time dilation, length con-
traction, and so on, one can&rsquo;t help but wonder if these phenomena have any 
measurable effects here on Earth. Well, they do!
</p>
<p>We are all familiar with the electron, but may be somewhat less familiar 
with its big cousin, the muon, which is about 209 times more massive. The 
muon is also negatively charged, but unlike the electron, it is unstable and 
decays into other kinds of particles in a mere 2.2 &times; 10&minus;6 s (or 2.2 &micro;s), when 
at rest. Let&rsquo;s now imagine we have a laboratory that is 4 km long, with a 
muon emitter on one end and a muon detector on the other. We will also 
assume our muons are emitted with a speed of 99.5% that of light. How far 
does a muon travel before decaying into other particles?
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Non-relativistic&rdquo; answer: about 0.66 km. So would you expect the 
 detector at the end of your lab to detect the muon? No you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;
it should decay before it has a chance to traverse the length of the lab. 
However, to the surprise of &ldquo;non-relativistic experimenters&rdquo;, such muons are 
in fact detected. The mystery is resolved when we include the effects of time 
dilation.
</p>
<p>According to you, experimenting in the lab, the muon is moving and thus 
its clock slows down by a factor of γ = 10. So while the muon &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; it 
has lived 2.2 &micro;s, you see it living for 10 &times; 2.2 = 22 &micro;s. During this time 
 interval, the muon can actually traverse a distance of 6.6 km&mdash;comfortably 
</p>

and its inhabitants are contracted. Credit Natalie Perlov</p>

</div>

<p>46     3 Special Relativity
</p>
<p>reaching the end of the lab and the detector! Such an extended lifetime of 
rapidly moving particles is now routinely observed in particle physics experi-
ments.
</p>
<p>But what would the muon conclude if it could think? According to 
the muon, it lives for 2.2 &micro;s, and thus expects to travel 0.66 km before 
 decaying. However, it sees a lab rushing by at 99.5% the speed of light. 
So instead of the lab being 4 km long, the muon thinks the lab is only 
4/10 = 0.4 km! So to the muon, there is no doubt that it will make it to the 
end of the lab before decaying.
</p>
<p>So, both the muon and the experimenter in the lab will agree that the 
muon should in fact be detected, although to the observer this is due to time 
dilation of the moving muon, and from the muon&rsquo;s frame of reference, it is 
due to length contraction of the moving lab.
</p>
<p>There are many other practical applications of special relativity, which you 
could google if you feel incurably curious. Don&rsquo;t forget to find out how time 
dilation affects GPS satellites&hellip;
</p>
<p>3.7  E = mc2
</p>
<p>A few months after Einstein published his first paper on relativity, he mined 
yet another gem from the two postulates: energy and mass are related in a 
fundamental way. It took another two years before he arrived at his famous 
equation E = mc2, which he boldly and correctly interpreted to describe a 
complete equivalence between mass and energy. Loosely speaking, mass can 
be converted into energy, and energy can be converted into mass. An important 
example of mass being converted into energy occurs during nuclear reactions 
in the cores of stars (see Fig. 3.14).
</p>
<p>For a physical object moving as a whole with velocity v, Einstein&rsquo;s 
 relativistic energy relation can be expressed as
</p>
<p>heat
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.14 Schematic illustration of nuclear fusion. Two nuclei combine to 
 produce a new, larger nucleus, whose mass is smaller than the sum of the masses 
of its constituents. The difference in mass is given off in the form of heat (and 
light) energy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.7 E = mc2     47
</p>
<p>where γ is the Lorentz factor, and m0 is the mass of the object at rest, called 
its rest mass. For velocities much smaller than the speed of light, this formula 
is well approximated by E = m0c
</p>
<p>2
+ 1/2m0v
</p>
<p>2. Here, the first term is called 
the rest energy of the object and the second is its Newtonian kinetic energy.
</p>
<p>Notice that the energy for an object at rest does not vanish&mdash;it is the rest 
mass m0 (times c
</p>
<p>2). The idea that an object at rest has energy by virtue of the 
fact that it has mass, was a totally new concept when Einstein introduced it. 
Another important feature of the relativistic energy is that it tends to infinity 
when the velocity of an object approaches the speed of light. It takes increas-
ingly large amounts of energy to bring the speed of the object closer and 
closer to the speed of light, but the limit v = c can never be reached. Thus, 
the speed of light is the absolute speed limit in the Universe.5
</p>
<p>3.8  From Space and Time to Spacetime
</p>
<p>We say that space is 3-dimensional because it takes three numbers to indi-
cate a location in space. For example, you could arrange to meet someone 
in a restaurant on the 7th floor in the building at the corner of 16th Street 
and 5th Avenue. But what if you forget to specify when you want to meet? 
Clearly including the time of your proposed meeting is just as important as 
the location. Thus we can think of time as a 4th dimension.
</p>
<p>When we combine our notions of space and time, we speak of spacetime. 
Since there are three spatial dimensions and one time dimension in our 
universe, we say spacetime is 4-dimensional. In Newtonian physics such a 
combination is artificial because space and time are completely independent. 
But in Einstein&rsquo;s theory it is very natural, so space and time are routinely 
depicted together in a spacetime diagram, as shown in Fig. 3.15. An event 
is a point in spacetime. It can be specified by four pieces of information, or 
four coordinates (t, x, y, z), where the t stands for time and the other coor-
dinates represent the location in space. The history of a point-like object is 
represented by a line, known as its worldline. The worldline tells us where in 
space the object is, for each moment in time. What do you think the world-
line of an object at rest looks like?
</p>
<p>(3.5)E = mc2 = γ m0c
2
</p>
<p>5This limit is attained only by particles with a zero rest mass, like the photon.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48     3 Special Relativity
</p>
<p>If all of spacetime was laid out in front of you, then you would know 
everything about the past, present and future of the Universe. You would 
be able to follow the worldline of each particle and determine its loca-
tion at any moment of time. A &ldquo;moment of time&rdquo; is a 3-dimensional slice 
through the 4-dimensional spacetime. All events on this slice are simultane-
ous from the point of view of a certain observer. Another observer, with a 
different notion of simultaneity, will draw a different slice. Although these 
3- dimensional &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; of the Universe may look different from one 
another, the underlying 4-dimensional spacetime is the same.
</p>
<p>The notion of 4-dimensional spacetime was championed by Einstein&rsquo;s 
former mathematics professor, Hermann Minkowski, who also uncovered 
its deep geometric structure. In a lecture at the University of Gottingen, 
Minkowski proclaimed that &ldquo;Henceforth space by itself and time by itself 
are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of 
the two will preserve an independent reality&rdquo; (Fig. 3.16).
</p>
<p>Minkowski&rsquo;s insight can be explained by analogy with Euclidean 
 geometry on a plane. Suppose we have two points on a plane that are con-
nected by a straight line segment. We can characterize this segment by its 
projections on two orthogonal axes, x and y. The squared length of the seg-

dimension in the spacetime diagram because we can&rsquo;t draw all three spatial 
dimensions plus time. The present time is indicated by a constant-time &ldquo;slice&rdquo; on 
this diagram. Also shown is the history of a point-like version of yourself&mdash;your

<p>ment equals �x2 + �y2, by the Pythagorean Theorem.6 We can now choose 
a different set of axes, rotated with respect to the first. The projections of our 
segment on the new axes will then be different, but the sum of their squares 
will be the same, and will remain equal to the length squared of the seg-
ment.
</p>
<p>Minkowski realized that the situation in Einstein&rsquo;s theory is similar. Given 
two events, their separations in space and time will differ for different observ-
ers. But this is only because the events are being projected on different space 
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.16 Hermann Minkowski was the son of Lithuanian Jews; he converted 
to Christianity to improve his job prospects. He taught Einstein  mathematics 
at Zurich Polytechnic Institute. As a student, Einstein did not think much of 
Minkowski&rsquo;s lectures, while Minkowski remembered Einstein as a &ldquo;lazy dog&rdquo; 
and did not expect him to produce anything worthwhile. To Minkowski&rsquo;s credit, 
he changed his mind quickly after reading Einstein&rsquo;s 1905 paper. He pioneered 
the concept of a four-dimensional spacetime and used it to develop a  geometric 
formulation of special relativity. Einstein was still unimpressed with his former 
professor and thought that Minkowski&rsquo;s mathematical luster only obscured the 
physical meaning of his theory. But soon it was Einstein&rsquo;s turn to change his 
mind. Minkowski&rsquo;s four-dimensional spacetime was indispensable for the con-
struction of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of gravitation
</p>
<p>6Physicists often use the Greek letter � to denote the change in a given quantity. For example, in the 
text above, �x means the change in the value of x from one end of the line segment to the other end.</p>

<p>and time axes. Minkowski found that all observers will agree on a specific 
quantity called the spacetime interval. Consider events A and B marked 
in Fig. 3.17. Their space and time separations are denoted by �x and �t, 
respectively. The square of the spacetime interval can then be expressed as
</p>
<p>Note that, except for the minus sign, this is very similar to the Pythagorean 
theorem, especially if we use units with c = 1 (see paragraph below). Since 
all inertial observers will agree on the value of the spacetime interval, we say 
that the spacetime interval is invariant. Note also that for a particle traveling 
at the speed of light (like a photon) the spacetime interval between any two 
events on its worldline is zero (can you show this?).
</p>
<p>Whenever you graph physical quantities, it is crucial to know what units 
you are using. It turns out that for spacetime diagrams it is illuminating to use 
units in which the speed of light is c = 1. For example, time can be measured 
in years and spatial distances in light years. A light year is the  distance light 
travels in one year, which is roughly 1013 km (can you show how we  calculate 
this?). Then c = 1, since light travels a distance of one light year per year. 
When we plot the worldline of a light beam on a spacetime diagram using 
years and light years on the vertical and horizontal axes, respectively, we get a 
straight line at an angle of 45&deg; to the axes, as shown in Fig. 3.18.

<p>3.9  Causality in Spacetime
</p>
<p>With space and time intervals varying from one observer to the next, you 
may feel that physical reality is slipping away. Is everything relative in 
Einstein&rsquo;s world, or is there some objective reality that we can hold on to? 
Especially worrisome is the relation between cause and effect. Is it possible, 
for example, that some observers will see Jane arrive at Alpha Centauri before 
she leaves Earth? It is reassuring that special relativity does not allow such 
bizarre occurrences.
</p>
<p>Imagine an explosion that takes place at some time and location. Let&rsquo;s 
call this event A, as shown in Fig. 3.19. Light will propagate outwards 
along the 45&deg; lines. Since physical influences cannot propagate faster than

Earth, Alpha Centauri, and the worldline (thin black line) of Jane&rsquo;s hypothetical 
trip to our nearest stellar neighborhood. Notice that the part of Jane&rsquo;s worldline 
representing her trip is at a steeper angle than 45&deg; to the horizontal axis. This 
makes sense, because massive objects have to travel slower than the speed of 
light</p>

<p>light,  matter particles from the blast will travel at speeds less than that of 
light, and thus if we could trace the worldlines of such particles, we would 
find that they are confined to lie in the shaded region in the figure. Simple 
 mathematics shows that all observers will agree that all the events in this 
region are in the future of A (see question 12 at the end of this chapter). 
That is why this region is called the absolute future of event A.
</p>
<p>We can also ask, which events can influence event A? In Fig. 3.20, events 
lying in the region denoted &ldquo;absolute past&rdquo; can have an influence over event 
A. Also shown is event B which can neither influence, nor be influenced by 
event A. For events in the absolute past of A, all observers will agree that 
they occurred earlier than A. However, for events like B that are not in the 
absolute future or past of A, observers will disagree: some of them will find 
that B is prior to A; others will find that it is later; and there will be some 
who will find that both events occurred at the same time.

<p>3.9 Causality in Spacetime     53
</p>
<p>It follows that the time ordering of events can be reversed by going to 
another frame of reference only if the events are not causally related. If event 
B is caused by event A, all observers will agree that A occurred prior to B.
</p>
<p>In the 2 dimensional spacetime diagrams of Figs. 3.19 and 3.20, light rays 
travel along 45&deg; lines. If we add in another spatial dimension, so that we 
have a 3 dimensional spacetime diagram (as shown in Fig. 3.21), then these 
45&deg; lines are replaced by conical surfaces, called light cones. All events occur-
ring within the future light cone (top), lie in the future of event A, and all 
events lying within the past light cone (bottom), occurred in its past.
</p>
<p>Einstein completed his special theory of relativity in less than six weeks 
of frenzied work. Starting with two simple postulates, he was led by relent-
less logic to demolish the Newtonian concepts of absolute space and time, 
revealing a universe where observers in relative motion disagree on even the 
most basic measurements of mass, length and time. These counter-intuitive 
differences disappear when the observers&rsquo; relative speeds are slow compared 
to light. In this limit, Einstein&rsquo;s theory reduces to that of Newtonian  physics. 
In other words, Einstein did not prove that Newton was wrong. He just 
showed that Newton&rsquo;s theory has a limited range of validity, and that it is 
superseded by special relativity when relative speeds get close to the speed of 
light.
</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;special&rdquo; in special relativity refers to the fact that this theory 
applies only in special circumstances when the effects of gravity are unim-
portant. This limitation is removed in Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity, 
which is essentially a theory of gravitation.

<p>Deriving the time dilation formula
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now derive Eq. (3.2). As before, consider an observer equipped with a 
clock consisting of a light source and a mirror at a distance L (see Fig. 3.11). 
When the clock is at rest, a light pulse will take time
</p>
<p>to complete the round trip from the source to the mirror and back again.
Now consider what happens when the clock is moving relative to the 
</p>
<p> stationary observer with velocity v. The observer will see the light pulse travel 
along a diagonal path (see Fig. 3.11). The length of this diagonal path, 2D, can 
be found using the Pythagorean theorem,7 thus
</p>
<p>where we used Eq. (3.7) to express L in terms of t0, and we define t to 
be the time for the light pulse to complete a round trip, as measured by the 
 stationary observer. Thus, t/2 is the time it takes the light pulse to travel from 
the source to the mirror.
</p>
<p>Because the observer must measure the speed of light to be c, he will 
 measure the time taken for the round trip to be
</p>
<p>Thus substituting D = tc/2 in Eq. (3.8), and squaring both sides we find
</p>
<p>Rearranging, we find
</p>
<p>which, upon taking the square root, gives the time dilation formula Eq. (3.2), 
with the Lorentz contraction factor defined as in Eq. (3.3).
</p>
<p>Summary
Special relativity is based on two postulates: (1) the laws of physics are the 
same for all inertial observers (this is the principle of relativity), and (2) the 
speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all inertial observers. The con-
stancy of the speed of light led Einstein to deduce that space and time inter-
vals are relative: they depend on the state of motion of the observer who

<p>8In this problem we are only concerned with the special relativistic effect of time dilation, which makes 
the satellite clock run slower. But there is also a general relativistic effect which makes time run faster 
for the satellite, because it is in a weaker gravitational field than a clock on Earth (we will discuss this 
in Chap. 4). If we were to take into account both effects, then we would actually find that the satellite 
clock runs faster overall.</p>

<p>Einstein&rsquo;s special theory of relativity was a great breakthrough in our under-
standing of the physical world, but it presented a problem: it was incom-
patible with Newton&rsquo;s law of gravitation. Newton himself, and some ten 
generations of physicists and astronomers that followed, used this law to 
describe the motion of planets with remarkable accuracy. Granted, there was 
a tiny discrepancy in the calculated precession rate of the orbit of Mercury, 
but it did not seem to be a cause for concern. After all, theories seldom agree 
with all the data at any given time. Some of the data may simply be wrong 
and some discrepancies are later explained away with more careful theoreti-
cal analysis. Thus, Newton&rsquo;s theory appeared rock solid. However, it did not 
fit into the framework of special relativity.
</p>
<p>The inconsistency between the two theories is not difficult to illustrate. 
Newton&rsquo;s theory states that the force between two bodies is inversely propor-
tional to the square of the distance between the bodies at an instant of time. 
But according to Einstein, the distance (and the notion of an &ldquo;instant of 
time&rdquo;) is not the same for different observers. So whose distance should we 
use? If Newton&rsquo;s law is valid in the reference frame of some preferred inertial 
observer, while it is not valid for other inertial observers, then the principle 
of relativity is violated, because it requires that physical laws should apply 
equally to all inertial observers. So clearly, Newton&rsquo;s theory or relativity had 
to go &hellip;

</p>
<p>4.1  The Astonishing Hypothesis
</p>
<p>In his Dialogue, Galileo argued that the motion of objects under the action of 
gravity is independent of their mass, size, or any other intrinsic properties, as 
long as air resistance and other non-gravitational forces can be neglected. This 
was contrary to the accepted Aristotelian viewpoint at the time, which claimed 
that heavier objects fall faster. Indeed, a cannon ball does fall faster than a 
feather, but Galileo realized that the difference was due only to air resistance. 
Legend has it that Galileo dropped rocks of different mass from the Leaning 
Tower of Pisa, to see if they hit the ground at the same time. We do know 
that he experimented with marbles rolling down inclined planes and found 
that the motion was independent of the mass. He also offered the following 
theoretical proof that Aristotle could not be right: suppose that indeed a heavy 
rock falls faster than a light rock. Imagine then tying them together with a 
very light string. How will this affect the fall of the heavy rock? On the one 
hand, the slower-moving light rock should make the fall of the heavy rock 
somewhat slower than it was before. On the other hand, viewed together the 
two rocks now constitute one object, which is more massive than the heavy 
rock was initially, and thus it should fall faster. This contradiction demon-
strates that Aristotle&rsquo;s theory is inconsistent (Fig. 4.1).
</p>
<p>Galileo&rsquo;s experiments and theoretical deductions thus revealed that all 
objects fall at the same rate, regardless of their mass. While Einstein was 
pondering this peculiar kind of motion, which is completely independent 
of the object that is moving, it reminded him of inertial motion. Remember 
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.1 Galileo&rsquo;s thought experiment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.1 The Astonishing Hypothesis     61
</p>
<p>that in the absence of forces, an object moves at a constant velocity along a 
straight line in spacetime, regardless of what the object is made of. It is as if the 
path of the object in space and time is a property of spacetime itself.
</p>
<p>The analogy between motion in the field of gravity and inertial motion 
goes even further. Suppose that instead of the cabin of a ship, as suggested 
by Galileo, you lock yourself up in a falling elevator. (This is recommended, 
of course, only as a thought experiment!) All objects in the elevator, and the 
elevator itself, will fall at the same rate. You will not feel your weight because 
the elevator floor will be falling under your feet. If you drop an object, it will 
float next to you, exactly as it would if you were an inertial observer far away 
from any gravitating bodies. The same state of weightlessness is experienced 
by astronauts when their spaceship moves in the gravitational field of the 
Earth with its engines turned off. Indeed, the motion of objects in the gravi-
tational field does look very similar to inertial motion. But there is also a dif-
ference&mdash;gravity makes objects accelerate towards the Earth&rsquo;s center, so their 
worldlines are no longer straight &hellip; (Fig. 4.2).
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.2 Weightlessness inside a falling elevator</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>62      4 The Fabric of Space and Time
</p>
<p>This line of thought led Einstein to an astonishing hypothesis: in the pres-
ence of gravity, objects still move along the straightest lines in spacetime, but 
the spacetime itself is curved. The idea is that massive bodies curve spacetime 
around them. For example, the spacetime in the vicinity of the Sun gets 
curved. Thus, the Earth does not move along a straight line at a constant 
velocity (as it would in the absence of any gravitating bodies), but instead 
it moves around the Sun. The Earth&rsquo;s worldline is in fact the straightest line 
in this curved spacetime. (Such lines are also called geodesics). Note that a 
geodesic line in spacetime does not necessarily correspond to the straightest 
trajectory in space. For example, the Earth&rsquo;s elliptic orbit around the Sun is 
certainly not the straightest possible path (Fig. 4.3).
</p>
<p>The distortion of spacetime geometry by a massive body is often illus-
trated by a heavy bowling ball resting on a horizontally stretched rubber 
sheet. The rubber surface is warped near the ball, just like the spacetime is 
warped near a gravitating body. If you roll a marble along the rubber sur-
face, its path will be curved, due to the warping of the sheet. The trajectory 
of the marble is analogous to that of light signals and small objects. Note, 
however, that the time dimension is suppressed in this picture, so it illus-
trates only the warping of space and not of spacetime (Fig. 4.4).
</p>
<p>A curved four-dimensional spacetime is an abstract concept; it is very 
difficult to visualize. We shall now take an excursion to develop some 
intuition about spacetime curvature, using lower-dimensional analogies.  
As a first step, we shall leave time aside and address a simpler issue: What 
does it mean for space to be curved?

<p>The geometers of ancient Greece devoted a great deal of effort to studying 
the properties of space. A beautiful exposition of their work was compiled 
around 300 B.C. by Euclid of Alexandria in his book Elements, which is 
regarded as the most influential text in the history of mathematics. Euclid 
began with five axioms. These are self-evident statements whose truth would 
be indisputable by any sane person. For example, the first two axioms are: 
&ldquo;Given any two points, a straight line segment can be drawn between them&rdquo;, 
and &ldquo;Any straight line segment can be extended without limit in either 
direction.&rdquo; If you accept Euclid&rsquo;s five axioms, you have no choice but to fol-
low the inevitable logic of the proofs of 465 theorems which express various 
geometrical facts, including the following (Fig. 4.5):
</p>
<p>The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180&deg;.
The circumference of a circle of radius r is C = 2πr.
The area of a sphere of radius r is A = 4πr2.

</p>
<p>This amazing creation of the Greeks was so perfect that mathematicians 
remained under its spell for more than 2000 years. Euclid&rsquo;s axioms looked 
as obvious and necessary as the laws of logic themselves. Thus it appeared 
as though the properties of space could be deduced from pure reason. 
Furthermore, Euclidean geometry seemed to be the only geometry that was 
logically possible (Fig. 4.6).
</p>
<p>Occasional doubts had only been expressed regarding Euclid&rsquo;s fifth 
axiom, which states: &ldquo;Given any straight line, you can draw one and only 
one straight line parallel to it through any point in the same plane.&rdquo; (It is 
assumed that the point is not on the first line.) Looking at Fig. 4.7, this 
statement seems rather plausible, although it is perhaps not as obvious as 
Euclid&rsquo;s other axioms. Numerous attempts were made to prove it as a theo-
rem (this would reduce the number of axioms to four). However, as the cen-
turies passed, no one raised the possibility that the parallel line axiom might 
actually be wrong, or that it might be possible to replace it with something 
else that is free from logical contradictions.
</p>
<p>Our intuition is rooted in Euclidean geometry, which very accurately rep-
resents the properties of space&mdash;at least on the scales familiar to humans. 
However, imagine for a moment that you want to test Euclid&rsquo;s fifth axiom 
experimentally. First you have to decide what you mean by a straight line. 
Of course you can draw a line with a ruler. But how do you know that your 
ruler is straight? You can check it using a stretched thread, or by holding it 
close to your eye and looking along its length. But then you are assuming 
that the thread is straight, or that light propagates in a straight line. Clearly, 
you have to choose some class of objects and identify them with straight 
lines; otherwise you have no standard of straightness.

<p>4.2 The Geometry of Space     65
</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, suppose you choose light rays to be your stand-
ard straight lines. Then imagine shining two beams of light from two pro-
jectors onto a distant screen. You make sure that the beams emanate in the 
same direction, orthogonal to the line connecting the projectors. If Euclid

<p>66   4 The Fabric of Space and Time
</p>
<p>is right, then the distance between the two light spots on the screen should 
be equal to the distance between the projectors. But imagine that the light 
spots turn out to be slightly further apart, and that this distance keeps 
increasing as you move the screen further away. This would mean that the 
separation between the light beams grows with the distance. If your straight 
lines have this property of somehow &ldquo;bending away&rdquo; from one another, 
then it is not difficult to imagine that they can avoid intersection even if 
initially they are headed slightly towards each other. A number of different 
lines could then pass through the same point without ever intersecting a 
given line (see Fig. 4.8). Alternatively, if the lines were to bend towards one 
another, then they might always cross. This is also illustrated in Fig. 4.8. If 
light rays in our world had such properties, then perhaps we would not find 
Euclid&rsquo;s fifth axiom so obvious.
</p>
<p>4.2.2  Non-Euclidean Geometry
</p>
<p>The great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss was the first to break 
away from the Euclidean dogma. In the early 1800s he explored a geometry 
in which the fifth axiom is replaced with a postulate allowing multiple parallel 
lines through the same point, and convinced himself that it was free from logi-
cal contradictions. He worked out the properties of various geometrical figures 
and found that they were in many ways different from those in the familiar 
Euclidean geometry. In particular, the sum of the angles in a triangle was 
always less than 180&deg;. This kind of geometry is now called hyperbolic geometry.

<p>4.2 The Geometry of Space     67
</p>
<p>With a breakthrough of this magnitude, you might imagine that Gauss 
ran around the streets of Gottingen shouting &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo;, and then immedi-
ately submitted a paper for publication. But this did not happen&mdash;Gauss 
kept his work secret! In his time, challenging Euclid was what would now 
be called &ldquo;politically incorrect&rdquo;. Euclidean geometry was adopted without 
question by the great Newton, and was declared &ldquo;an inevitable necessity of 
thought&rdquo; by the eminent German philosopher Immanuel Kant. It was not 
uncommon for academics to get embroiled in life-long bitter disputes, and 
Gauss probably felt that passing on a publication was a reasonable price to 
pay to avoid any altercations.
</p>
<p>Hyperbolic geometry was independently discovered in the 1820s by 
Nikolai Lobachevsky, a professor of mathematics in the provincial Russian 
city of Kazan, and a few years later by a Hungarian artillery officer Janos 
Bolyai. Lobachevsky was not afraid to stick his neck out and submitted 
his work for publication to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. His 
paper, however, was rejected and was finally published in the obscure Kazan 
Messenger. Lobachevsky&rsquo;s discovery did not receive much recognition during 
his lifetime, and at the age of 54 he was suddenly dismissed from his post at 
the University. No reason was given, but this might well have something to 
do with his unorthodox ideas. The hyperbolic geometry is now often called 
Lobachevsky geometry.
</p>
<p>The geometry in which no lines can be drawn parallel to a given line 
through any point, was investigated in the 1850s by Bernhard Riemann, 
who would later become Gauss&rsquo;s successor as a professor at Gottingen. It is 
sometimes called spherical geometry, for reasons that will soon become clear.
</p>
<p>4.3  Curved Space
</p>
<p>Apart from his secret research on hyperbolic geometry, Gauss developed 
another, completely different approach to the problem. This work was even 
more important, because of its greater generality. For us it also has an added 
benefit of being very useful for visualizing non-Euclidean spaces.
</p>
<p>4.3.1  The Curvature of Surfaces
</p>
<p>For nearly a decade Gauss was involved in large-scale geodetic measure-
ments. The effort was well funded, in order to produce accurate maps, but 
Gauss&rsquo;s own interest was to gain more information about the shape of the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>68   4 The Fabric of Space and Time
</p>
<p>Earth. The shape of a surface can be easily grasped when you see it from 
outside. But satellite pictures of the Earth were not yet available, and Gauss 
could rely only on measurements made on Earth&rsquo;s surface. He was thus led 
to think about the inner properties of a surface (Fig. 4.9).
</p>
<p>Gauss&rsquo;s key realization was that a surface could be regarded as a two-
dimensional space in itself, as if the exterior world were non-existent. The 
role of a straight line connecting two points in that space is played by the 
geodesic line, which is the shortest line between two points along the sur-
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.9 Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777&ndash;1855) was a child prodigy born to poor 
parents. A caring teacher managed to convince Gauss&rsquo;s father to excuse the 
young Gauss from his part-time job spinning flax, so that he may continue his 
education. Word of his talents reached the Duke of Brunswick, who sent him 
to grammar school, and then to university at the age of 15. Gauss made major 
discoveries in many areas of mathematics and physics and was already in his life-
time regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. His fame 
led to Napoleon giving a command to spare Brunswick because &ldquo;the foremost 
mathematician of all time lives there&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Curved Space     69
</p>
<p>face. While a triangle on a flat surface has angles which sum to 180&deg;, this 
is not the case for a triangle made of three geodesic lines on a non-flat sur-
face. Gauss found that for small triangles the deviation from 180&deg; grows 
with the area of the triangle and is proportional to a quantity that he called 
the curvature of the 2D space. (From now on we shall use the abbreviation 
2D to denote &ldquo;two-dimensional&rdquo;.) The curvature can be positive or negative, 
depending on whether the sum of the angles is greater or smaller than 180&deg; 
(Fig. 4.10).
</p>
<p>A simple prototype of a curved surface is a sphere. The geodesic lines in 
this case are great circles. For example, meridians and the equatorial circle 
are geodesics on the globe. Any two great circles necessarily intersect&mdash;like 
all meridians intersect at the North and South poles, even though they 
appear to be parallel near the equator. This means that parallel lines do not 
exist on a sphere, and thus Euclid&rsquo;s fifth axiom does not hold. Also, trian-
gles that are constructed from great circle segments, have angles which 
add to more than 180&deg; (see Fig. 4.11b). Gauss found that the curvature of 
a sphere is inversely proportional to the square of its radius. As the radius 
is increased, the curvature gets smaller, and in the limit of infinite radius 
the curvature vanishes and the inner geometry is Euclidean. In this limit the 
sphere is indistinguishable from a plane.
</p>
<p>A 2D surface of negative curvature can be pictured as a saddle-like sur-
face, as in Fig. 4.11c. In general, some parts of a curved surface may have 
positive and other parts negative curvature. The case of a sphere is rather

<p>70   4 The Fabric of Space and Time
</p>
<p>special, because of its high symmetry. It is homogeneous, which means that 
no matter where you are on the sphere, it looks the same. It is also isotropic, 
which means that from any point on a sphere it looks the same in all direc-
tions. A homogeneous and isotropic 2D space of negative curvature is called 
a hyperboloid, and the inner geometry of that space is the hyperbolic geom-
etry of Gauss and Lobachevsky. We would be glad to include a photograph 
of a hyperboloid in the book, but unfortunately this surface cannot be 
embedded in a 3D Euclidean space. Gauss&rsquo;s work on the inner geometry of 
surfaces was later extended by Riemann to spaces of three and higher dimen-
sions.
</p>
<p>4.3.2  The Curvature of Three-Dimensional Space
</p>
<p>Of special interest are the homogeneous and isotropic 3D spaces in which 
all locations are equivalent, and which look the same in all directions. As 
in the case of two dimensions, there are only three types of such spaces: 
Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic. Euclidean (or flat) space is the usual 
space we are most familiar with. It has zero curvature, and an infinite vol-
ume&mdash;it goes on and on ad infinitum.
</p>
<p>Spherical space (or the 3D sphere) is a three-dimensional analogue of a 
2D spherical surface. It is a closed, finite space; its geodesics are circles of 
length 2πR, and its volume1 is 2π2R3. The parameter R is called the radius 
of the 3D sphere. The sum of angles in a triangle in this space is greater than 
180
</p>
<p>◦. Also, as the radius of curvature R gets very large, the 3D curved space 
approaches 3D Euclidean space.
</p>
<p>Our everyday experience suggests that we live in a 3D Euclidean space. 
But what if we really live in a 3D spherical space with an astronomically 
large radius of curvature? Would we be able to tell the difference?
</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 4.11 Two dimensional spaces a flat Euclidean space; b spherical space; c 
hyperbolic space. As noted in the text, we cannot actually draw a 2D hyperbolic 
space in our 3D Euclidean space; the saddle is a space of negative curvature, 
which is often used as a &ldquo;stand in&rdquo; for a hyperbolic surface (Springer Artist)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Curved Space     71
</p>
<p>There is an observational way to make the distinction that hinges on an 
unusual property of spherical space. Let us consider how the area of a 2D 
sphere, A(r), depends on its radius in this space. Since we cannot visualize 
a curved 3D space, we shall use a 2D analogy. Imagine lines of latitude on 
the Earth&rsquo;s surface. We can think of them as 1D &ldquo;spheres&rdquo; centered at the 
North Pole. The distance r, along the Earth&rsquo;s surface, from the North Pole 
to a given line of latitude plays the role of radius of the 1D &ldquo;sphere&rdquo; (see 
Fig. 4.12). As the radius is increased, the circumference of the latitude lines 
grows from zero up to the maximum value, cmax = 2πR, where R is the 
radius of the Earth. But as we further increase the radius past the equator, 
the circumference starts to diminish, coming back to zero at the South Pole. 
By analogy, we expect the area of a 2D sphere, in a spherical space of radius 
R, to increase from zero to Amax = 4πR
</p>
<p>2 and then decrease back to zero.
The dependence of the area on the radius, A(r), is important because it 
</p>
<p>determines how the observed brightness of a light source depends on the 
distance of the source from the observer. The energy emitted by the source 
per unit time is uniformly distributed over the area of the sphere. Hence, the 
observed brightness of the source is inversely proportional to A(r). In flat 
space, A(r) = 4πr2, and the brightness decreases as r&minus;2 with the distance 
(an inverse square law). On the other hand, in a spherical space the bright-
ness initially decreases with distance, but at r &gt; π
</p>
<p>2
R it starts growing again, 
</p>
<p>and becomes very large as r approaches the maximal distance, rmax = πR 
(the &ldquo;South Pole&rdquo;). If we think of meridians in Fig. 4.12 as light rays ema-
nating from a source at the North Pole, these rays start to converge after 
crossing the equator and focus to a point at the South Pole. An observer 
near the South Pole will therefore see a very bright image of the source.
</p>
<p>A 3D hyperbolic space is a space of constant negative curvature. Its vol-
ume is infinite, and the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180&deg;. The area 
of a sphere grows faster than r2, so light sources get dimmer with distance 
even faster than they do in flat space. The 3D hyperbolic geometry is even 
harder to conceptualize than spherical curved geometry, so we will not go 
into any more detail here. Fortunately, like Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic 
and spherical geometries can be readily described mathematically.
</p>
<p>When curved non-Euclidean spaces were first shown to be logically 
consistent, Gauss attempted what appeared to be an observational test 
of curvature. Using an instrument that he himself invented for geodetic

<p>measurements, the heliotrope, Gauss measured the three angles in a trian-
gle having a size of about 100 km, with vertices at the mountain tops of 
Hohenhagen, Brocken and Inselsberg. He mentioned this measurement in 
a paper published in 1827, saying that the angles added up to 180&deg; within 
the expected errors of measurement. It is left for the reader to decide 
whether this was only a test of the accuracy of the heliotrope, or a test of the 
Euclidean geometry of space. If it was the latter, Gauss&rsquo;s attempt came too 
early: the curvature of space had to await its detection for nearly 100 years.
</p>
<p>4.4  The General Theory of Relativity
</p>
<p>After this foray into non-Euclidean geometry, we now return to Einstein and 
his struggle to understand gravity. It took Einstein five years to leap from 
Galileo&rsquo;s cue to the idea of curved spacetime. This was a tremendous break-
through, but it was not nearly the end of the journey. The idea still had to be 
expressed in mathematical terms: precisely how is the curvature of spacetime 
determined by massive bodies? For that matter, how can one mathematically 
characterize a curved four-dimensional spacetime? Einstein had no idea.
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.12 Lines of latitude can be thought of as &ldquo;1D spheres&rdquo; in a 2D spheri-
cal space. The distance from the North Pole plays the role of radius of the 
&ldquo;spheres&rdquo;. The circumference of the &ldquo;spheres&rdquo; grows with the radius, reaches 
its maximum at the equator, and then decreases, shrinking to zero at the South 
Pole</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.4 The General Theory of Relativity     73
</p>
<p>He approached his old classmate Marcel Grossmann, a mathemati-
cian and an expert in geometry. After some time in the library, Grossmann 
reported back with some good news and some bad news. The good news 
was that the mathematics of curved spaces did exist. It had been developed 
by Bernhard Riemann, who extended Gauss&rsquo;s work on the non-Euclidean 
geometry of curved surfaces to spaces of three and higher dimensions. The 
bad news was that this mathematics was an impenetrable mess. In the case 
of a surface, the curvature is characterized by a single number (at every 
point), while in higher dimensions it is described by a multi-component 
monster called the Riemann tensor. Physicists would have been well advised 
to stay away from this&hellip;
</p>
<p>But Einstein did not have this option. With Grossmann&rsquo;s help, he mas-
tered the intimidating formalism of Riemannian geometry and went on to 
use it in the formulation of his new theory of gravity. &ldquo;&hellip; in all my life&rdquo;, 
he wrote in a letter to German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, &ldquo;I have never 
struggled so hard &hellip; Compared to this problem, the original relativity the-
ory is child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo; It took Einstein more than three years to complete the 
job.
</p>
<p>The equations of the new theory, which Einstein called the &ldquo;general the-
ory of relativity&rdquo;, relate the geometry of spacetime to the material content 
of the Universe, see Fig. 4.13. This may look like a single equation, but 
the indices &micro; and ν take four possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3, so in fact this is a 
compact representation of a system of 16 equations. The left-hand side of 
the equations includes components of the Riemann tensor, which tell us 
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.13 Einstein&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>74   4 The Fabric of Space and Time
</p>
<p>how much the spacetime is curved in different directions. The right-hand 
side contains Newton&rsquo;s constant G and the so-called stress-energy tensor of 
matter T&micro;υ, whose components include the energy density, the energy flux 
(which characterizes how fast energy is being transported and in what direc-
tion), and pressure.
</p>
<p>You may be surprised to see all these different characteristics of matter, 
because in the Newtonian theory the gravitational force is determined only 
by mass. But the difference here is not as large as it may seem. The energy 
density is essentially the same thing as mass density (remember E = Mc2
</p>
<p>?), while the other quantities have little effect on gravity under normal cir-
cumstances. The energy flux is small when the speeds of gravitating bodies 
are well below the speed of light, and the pressure is normally much smaller 
than the energy density. Later in this book we shall encounter exotic states of 
matter with a very large pressure, but for familiar astrophysical objects like 
stars or planets, the role of pressure in gravitational physics is negligible.
</p>
<p>An essential feature of Einstein&rsquo;s theory is that gravitational effects propa-
gate at the speed of light. If the Sun were suddenly removed, as if walloped 
by a huge golf club, this would first change the spacetime curvature only 
in its immediate vicinity. The effect would then spread out and reach the 
Earth in about 8 min (the time it takes light to travel from the Sun to the 
Earth). Thus, the force of gravity is no longer determined by the instanta-
neous distance between the bodies. However, the Newtonian instantaneous 
interaction is a very good approximation when the motion of bodies is slow 
compared to the speed of light.
</p>
<p>Einstein verified that in the Newtonian regime of slow motion and weak 
gravitational fields, his theory reproduced Newton&rsquo;s law, with the force of 
gravity inversely proportional to the square of the distance. In fact, he found 
that the difference between the two theories was completely negligible for 
the motion of planets in the Solar System. The only exception was Mercury, 
the planet closest to the Sun. Before general relativity, Mercury&rsquo;s orbit was 
measured to precess around the Sun by about 2&deg; per century (see Fig. 4.14), 
instead of being perfectly elliptical. It was understood that the other plan-
ets perturbed Mercury&rsquo;s orbit, and the resulting precession rate could be 
calculated. However, the most detailed Newtonian calculations predicted a 
rate that was about 1% slower than observed. Einstein was aware of this dis-
crepancy, and showed that a small correction to Newton&rsquo;s law due to general 
relativity precisely made up for the difference. Einstein needed no further 
proofs: at this point he was convinced that his theory was correct.</p>

<p>4.5  Predictions and Tests of General Relativity
</p>
<p>4.5.1  Light Deflection and Gravitational Lensing
</p>
<p>The first new prediction of general relativity to be tested observationally was 
the deflection of light as it propagates through a curved spacetime region 
near a massive body. If light from a distant star passes close to the Sun, the 
star should appear to be in a different position from where it usually is. 
Einstein proposed that a Solar eclipse would offer the perfect opportunity to 
view stars that appear close to the Sun. Their positions could then be meas-
ured and compared with their known positions when the Sun is not nearby.
</p>
<p>In 1919 two British teams led by Arthur Eddington set out to test 
Einstein&rsquo;s prediction. Eddington&rsquo;s announcement to the world that they 
had indeed measured the bending of starlight in complete agreement with 
Einstein&rsquo;s theory, instantaneously turned Einstein into a household name. As 
for Einstein, he was so confident that when he was asked what if Eddington 
doesn&rsquo;t confirm the theory, he replied &ldquo;Then I would feel sorry for the dear 
Lord!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>A related prediction is that of gravitational lensing: light from a distant 
source is bent as it passes by a massive object, like a galaxy, resulting in mul-
tiple images of the same source (see Fig. 4.15). If the lensing galaxy happens 
to be centered on the line of sight to the source, the images are spread into a 
circular band known as an Einstein ring, as shown in Fig. 4.16.

</p>
<p>4.5.2  Gravitational Time Dilation
</p>
<p>Einstein also investigated how clocks are affected by gravity and found that a 
clock runs slower as it gets closer to a gravitating body. This effect is known 
as gravitational time dilation. Surprisingly, it plays an important role in our 
tech savvy lives. The GPS system in your car, and that used by airplanes too, 
depend on information coming from satellites in space. The positional infor-
mation these satellites relay depends on the amount of time it takes light 
signals to travel to and from your device. But whose time? The satellites 
are moving much slower than the speed of light, but the effects of special 
relativity are non-negligible and cause the clocks on satellites to run a lit-
tle slower&mdash;by about 7 &micro;s per day. On the other hand, the satellites are in 
a weaker gravitational field than clocks on the surface of the earth, and thus 
by gravitational time dilation their clocks run a little faster&mdash;by about 45 &micro;s 
per day, so the net result is that clocks on satellites run faster by about 38 &micro;s 
a day. Both of these effects are accounted for in GPS satellite design; if they 
were not, position determinations would be so inaccurate that there would 
be no point to having a GPS!
</p>
<p>4.5.3  Black Holes
</p>
<p>General relativity predicts the existence of compact dense objects called 
black holes. Loosely speaking, the defining characteristic of a black hole is 
that a huge amount of mass is contained in a relatively tiny region of space. 
The spacetime in the vicinity of the mass is so severely warped that not even 
a light beam can find its way out of the region.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s quantify this idea. Consider an object of mass M and radius R. 
Recall from Chap. 2, the escape velocity from the surface of this object can 
be calculated from the condition that the total mechanical energy be zero:

Schwarzschild radius is about 1 cm, which is why packing the Earth into the 
tip of your thumb would create a black hole! The Sun&rsquo;s Schwarzschild radius 
is 3 km [as you can check using Eq. (4.2)].
</p>
<p>The spherical surface of radius Rs enclosing the black hole is called the 
event horizon. An observer outside a black hole can never see beyond this 
surface. To illustrate some unusual properties of the event horizon, imag-
ine that your twin sister embarks on a daring space mission towards a black 
hole, while you stay at a safe distance outside. Her spaceship is equipped 
with a device that sends out a light pulse every second, according to the 
clock on board. You will notice that the light pulses get less and less ener-
getic as the spaceship approaches the horizon. This is because the light pulse 
has to expend energy to climb out of the strong gravitational field near the 
black hole. At the event horizon the light will not be able to climb out at all.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, you will notice that the time intervals between successive 
pulses get increasingly large. This is due to gravitational time dilation. When 
your sister gets very close to the event horizon her clock seems to stop, and 
she will appear frozen in time&mdash;at the event horizon. Thus you will never see 
her &ldquo;cross&rdquo; the event horizon&mdash;no matter how long you wait.
</p>
<p>As far as your sister is concerned, she will not notice anything special 
when her spaceship approaches the horizon. While she is still outside, it is 
a good idea to turn around and head back. When she joins you, she will 
be younger than you are. If instead she stays the course, she will cross the 
horizon uneventfully, in a finite time by her clock. But that is the point of 
no return: the spaceship will now fall inexorably towards the center of the 
black hole. Close to the center, strong tidal forces stretch all falling objects in 
one direction and squeeze them in other directions, so the spaceship and its 
cargo will be &ldquo;spaghettified&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>We will return to discussing black holes in Chap. 12, but note here that 
there is strong evidence that they do in fact exist.

<p>4.5 Predictions and Tests of General Relativity     79
</p>
<p>erated charges generate electromagnetic waves. Gravitational waves inter-
act very weakly with matter and are therefore extremely hard to detect. 
Nonetheless, indirect evidence for gravitational waves has been known for 
some time. General relativity predicts that as two stars orbit one another, 
they release energy in the form of gravitational waves. This loss of energy 
causes the stars to spiral in towards one another, which increases their orbital 
speed, and decreases their orbital period. In 1974 a spiraling binary pair 
consisting of two neutron stars was detected. Over the last few decades, the 
orbital period of the pair has changed in the precise way predicted by gen-
eral relativity.3
</p>
<p>In September 2015 gravitational waves were directly detected using both 
of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) detec-
tors, located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, USA. The 
LIGO detectors were able to measure the distortion of spacetime caused 
by gravitational waves that emanated from a coalescing pair of black holes. 
Scientists deduced that 29 and 36 Solar mass black holes collided to form 
a larger spinning black hole. The collision occurred about 1.3 billion years 
ago, lasted for a fraction of a second, and converted about 3 Solar masses 
of energy into gravitational wave radiation, some of which passed through 
the Earth. The spatial distortion caused by gravitational waves is almost 
imperceptibly small: each LIGO instrument has two arms that are about 
4 km long, and changes in its length of about one ten thousandth the size 
of a proton are measurable. It is a huge experimental triumph to be able to 
measure such a minute change in the apparatus, and to be able to deduce 
so much about the nature of the system which generated the gravitational 
radiation.
</p>
<p>The detection of gravity waves has opened up an entirely new spectrum, 
akin to the electromagnetic spectrum, with which to observe the universe. 
Several other gravitational wave observatories are scheduled to become oper-
ational in the near future (Fig. 4.17).
</p>
<p>Today, the scientific success of general relativity is unquestionable. But 
perhaps the most remarkable thing about GR is how little factual input it 
required. The postulate that Einstein used as the foundation of the theory, 
that the motion of objects under the action of gravity is independent of their 
mass, was already known to Galileo. With this minimal input, he created a 
theory that reproduced Newton&rsquo;s law in the appropriate limit and explained 
a deviation from this law. If you think about it, Newton&rsquo;s law is somewhat

<p>arbitrary because it does not explain why the force of gravity is inversely 
proportional to the second power of the distance. It could have been pro-
portional to some other power. In contrast, Einstein&rsquo;s theory gives you no 
freedom. His picture of gravity as curvature of spacetime, combined with 
the requirements of the principle of relativity, inevitably leads to Einstein&rsquo;s 
equations, which uniquely predict the inverse square law. In this sense, the 
general theory of relativity not only describes gravity, it explains gravity.
</p>
<p>Summary
The key insight of Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity (GR) is that grav-
ity is a manifestation of spacetime curvature. Massive bodies curve the 
spacetime around them, causing nearby objects to move on curved trajec-
tories. GR predicts that gravitational effects propagate at the speed of light. 
Thus, the force of gravity no longer acts instantaneously, as Newton had 
to assume. Nevertheless, for slow motions and weak gravitational fields, 
Einstein&rsquo;s theory reduces to Newton&rsquo;s inverse square law.

eral relativistic calculation of the precession of Mercury&rsquo;s orbit is in perfect 
agreement with astronomical observations. The first new prediction of gen-

<p>5.1  Einstein&rsquo;s Static Universe
</p>
<p>Shortly after completing the general theory of relativity, Einstein went on 
to apply his new theory to the universe as a whole. The structure of the 
universe beyond our Milky Way galaxy was then completely unknown, so 
Einstein had to make some assumptions. Following Newton, he assumed 
that on average matter is uniformly distributed in the cosmos. There are of 
course local variations, with the density of stars higher in some places and 
lower in others. However on very large scales the universe is well approxi-
mated as being perfectly homogeneous.
</p>
<p>Einstein also assumed that the universe is isotropic on average. This 
means that it looks more or less the same in all directions. A homogeneous 
and isotropic (on average) distribution is illustrated in Fig. 5.1(a), with gal-
axies represented by dots. An example of a homogeneous distribution that is 
not isotropic is shown in Fig. 5.1(b), where the galaxies (dots) form a regular 
lattice. This distribution looks the same from every galaxy, but it looks dif-
ferent in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. The actual distribu-
tion of galaxies, as revealed by modern astronomical observations, is more 
complicated than that in Fig. 5.1(a). Individual galaxies form clusters, which 
are in turn grouped into huge superclusters, typically 150 million light years 
across. But that is where the hierarchy of cosmic structure appears to end. If 
the distribution of galaxies is smoothed over distances of 300 million light 
years or so, it does appear to be homogeneous and isotropic.

<p>84     5 An Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>The universe cannot be homogeneous and isotropic unless space itself has 
these properties. The curvature of space should be (on average) the same at 
all places and in all directions. As we discussed in Chap. 4, there are only 
three types of such spaces: a flat Euclidean space, a closed spherical space, 
and an open hyperbolic space. A homogeneous and isotropic universe 
should therefore have one of these three geometries.
</p>
<p>Finally, Einstein assumed that the average characteristics of the universe, 
such as the average density of stars, do not change with time. His overall pic-
ture was thus that the universe looks more or less the same at all places, in all 
directions, and at all times. Einstein did not have much observational data 
to back up his assumptions, but philosophically he found this picture of a 
homogeneous, isotropic, static universe very attractive.
</p>
<p>It turned out, however, that the equations of GR have no solutions with 
these properties. The problem is that masses distributed in the universe are 
pulled together by gravity and refuse to stay at rest. The theory seemed to 
suggest that the universe could not be static. But the preconception of an 
eternal, immutable universe was too deeply rooted. Reluctantly, Einstein 
concluded that the equations of GR had to be modified, by adding an extra 
term, to allow for the existence of a static world.
</p>
<p>The effect of the new term was to endow the vacuum&mdash;that is, empty 
space&mdash;with energy and pressure. This may sound crazy, but we know that 
Einstein was not afraid of making counter-intuitive assumptions and follow-
ing them to their logical conclusion. According to the modified equations, 
the energy density of the vacuum ρv is constant everywhere; Einstein called

<p>it the cosmological constant. The vacuum pressure Pv is related to the vacuum 
energy density ρv simply as
</p>
<p>Therefore, if ρv is positive, the pressure is negative. (We give a derivation of 
Eq. (5.1) from the work-energy relation at the end of this section.)
</p>
<p>What does it mean for the pressure to be negative? The usual, positive 
pressure is an outward-pushing force, like the pressure of air in a balloon. 
Negative pressure is what we ordinarily call tension. It pulls inward, like the 
tension in a stretched piece of rubber. So, if the vacuum has tension, why 
does it not suck itself in and shrink? The reason is that in order to produce a 
force you need a difference in pressure: a balloon will expand if you increase 
the pressure inside it, but there will be no effect if the exterior pressure is 
increased by the same amount. The vacuum pressure is the same everywhere, 
and thus we should not expect any shrinkage (or expansion). The energy of 
the vacuum is equally elusive. There is no way to extract this energy; unfor-
tunately we cannot solve the world&rsquo;s energy crisis by harnessing energy from 
empty space. The energy and pressure of the vacuum are thus completely 
unobservable&mdash;except for their gravitational effects.
</p>
<p>The force of gravity in GR depends both on the energy (or mass) density, 
ρ, and the pressure, P. It is proportional to
</p>
<p>For ordinary matter, pressure is negligible, so we are used to thinking about 
gravity as being dependent only on mass. However, for the vacuum, the 
pressure has the same magnitude as the energy density (see Eq. (5.1)), and 
we find that the gravitational force of the vacuum is proportional to
</p>
<p>The negative sign here (in contrast to the positive sign for regular matter) 
indicates that the gravity of the vacuum is repulsive.
</p>
<p>Einstein realized that by adding a cosmological constant to his equations, 
he could balance the gravitational attraction of matter with the gravitational 
repulsion of the vacuum. All he needed was a matter density with ρm = 2ρv, 
to perfectly balance the gravitational effect of the vacuum given in Eq. (5.3). 
He thereby obtained a solution that describes a static universe. This solution 
has a closed, spherical geometry, with the radius determined by the matter 
density. For the density given by recent measurements, the corresponding 
circumference is about 100 billion light years.

<p>86     5 An Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>The spacetime of Einstein&rsquo;s static universe is illustrated in Fig. 5.2, with 
two out of the three spatial dimensions suppressed. It looks like the surface 
of a cylinder embedded in a 3-dimensional space, but only points on the 
surface belong to the spacetime. Time runs in the vertical direction, and 
horizontal slices give &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; of the universe at different moments of 
time. In the figure these slices are circles, but in the four-dimensional spa-
cetime the slices would be three-dimensional spherical spaces. The vertical 
straight lines are the worldlines of galaxies. In this universe, nothing changes 
with time, so all snapshots are identical and the positions of the galaxies do 
not change.
</p>
<p>5.2  Problems with a Static Universe
</p>
<p>Despite its philosophical appeal, it turns out that Einstein&rsquo;s static cosmologi-
cal model is not acceptable. To see why, think about what would happen to 
the matter density, ρm, and the vacuum energy density, ρv, if the radius of 
the universe were slightly decreased. It doesn&rsquo;t take an Einstein to realize that

sent momentary snapshots of the universe. Two out of the three spatial dimen-
sions are not shown</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.2 Problems with a Static Universe     87
</p>
<p>ρm would increase and ρv, by its very definition, would remain constant. 
This causes the balance scales to tip in the gravitational tug-of-war between 
the attraction of matter and the repulsion of the vacuum. Attraction prevails 
and the universe begins to contract. As it contracts, the matter density is fur-
ther increased, so the contraction accelerates.
</p>
<p>Similarly, we could ask: What would happen if the radius of the uni-
verse were increased slightly? In this case, ρm decreases, and the gravitational 
repulsion of the vacuum will win, causing the universe to expand ad infini-
tum. Small fluctuations in the radius of the universe cannot be avoided, and 
thus Einstein&rsquo;s universe cannot remain static for an infinite time.
</p>
<p>Another problem with the idea of an eternal universe is that it is in con-
flict with one of the most universal laws of Nature&mdash;the second law of ther-
modynamics. This law states that an isolated physical system evolves from 
more ordered to more disordered states.1 A gust of wind will lift papers from 
your desk and scatter them randomly over the floor, but you never see the 
wind picking up papers from the floor and organizing them neatly on the 
desk. A spontaneous ordering of this kind is not impossible in principle, 
but it is so unlikely that it is never seen to occur. A book sliding along the 
floor comes to a halt due to friction, and the energy of its directed, ordered 
motion turns into heat, that is, into the energy of the disordered motion of 
molecules. The inverse process would be for the book to cool down and start 
moving along the floor. This is forbidden by the second law of thermody-
namics.
</p>
<p>A mathematical measure of disorder is called entropy: the more entropy an 
object has, the more disordered it is. The second law says that the entropy of 
an isolated system can only increase. The evolution from ordered to more dis-
ordered states leads eventually to the state of maximum entropy, known as ther-
mal equilibrium. In this state, all ordered motion ceases, all energy is converted 
into heat, and a uniform temperature is established throughout the system.
</p>
<p>The universe can be regarded as an isolated system (since there is nothing 
outside of it). Therefore, if it existed forever, thermal equilibrium would have 
already been reached. The stars would have completely burnt out, cooling to 
the same temperature as interstellar space, and no life would be possible.2 But 
this is not what is observed, so the universe could not have existed forever.
</p>
<p>1In case you are wondering, the first law of thermodynamics is just a statement of energy conservation, 
generalized to include thermal processes. It states that the total energy of an isolated system, including 
its heat energy, is conserved.
</p>
<p>2This bleak prediction was publicized by the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. He called it 
the &ldquo;heat death&rdquo; of the universe.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>88     5 An Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>There is a caveat though. The Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann real-
ized that even in thermal equilibrium, spontaneous reductions of disorder 
occasionally happen by chance. They are called thermal fluctuations. So in 
order to reconcile the second law of thermodynamics with a universe that 
has existed forever, and an observable universe that is not in thermal equi-
librium, we would have to conclude that we are living in a huge thermal 
fluctuation.
</p>
<p>You may be concerned that such a huge fluctuation is extremely improb-
able. True. But if life can only exist in ordered parts of the universe, one can 
argue that this explains why we are observing such an incredibly rare event. 
Yet if we take this approach, we are still at a loss to explain why we don&rsquo;t find 
ourselves in a much smaller, and much more probable, fluctuation. It would 
suffice to turn chaos into order on the scale of the Solar System as opposed 
to the vastly larger scale of the observable universe.

<p>Derivation of Eq. (5.1)
Consider a chamber of volume V filled with a vacuum of energy density ρv and

<p>where A is the surface area of the piston. (Recall that pressure is the force 
per unit area, P = F/A.) Suppose the piston is moved outwards by amount ∆x, 
so that the volume is increased by

negative otherwise.)
</p>
<p>Thus, using Eqs. (5.7), (5.8), (5.5), and (5.6), we can show that the change in 
the energy of the vacuum is
</p>
<p>Using ∆E = &minus;Pv∆V  (from Eq. (5.9)), and using ∆E = ρv∆V  (from Eq. (5.4)), we 
find that the pressure of the vacuum is related to its energy density as Pv = &minus;ρv.
</p>
<p>5.3  Friedmann&rsquo;s Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>The next breakthrough development in cosmology occurred in a rather 
unlikely place&mdash;the Soviet Petrograd, devastated by war and the Russian 
revolution. It took several years for Einstein&rsquo;s papers on GR to reach Russia. 
Once they got there, the young mathematician Alexander Friedmann vora-
ciously studied the theory, focusing on what he thought was its central 
problem&mdash;the structure of the universe as a whole. He adopted Einstein&rsquo;s 
assumptions that the universe was homogeneous and isotropic and that it 
had a closed spherical geometry. Then he took a radical step: he did not 
require that the universe is static (Fig. 5.4).
</p>
<p>With the requirement of a static universe lifted, Friedmann found that 
Einstein&rsquo;s equations did have a solution. The solution describes a spheri-
cal universe with a time-varying radius and mass density. It starts with zero 
radius, expands, comes to a halt, and then contracts back to size zero. If you 
were an observer living in some galaxy in such a universe, then during the 
expansion phase, you would see all the other galaxies moving away from 
your galaxy, whilst during contraction all galaxies would approach you. It 
might seem that you are located at some special cosmic center, but observers 
in all the other galaxies would see the same thing.

</p>
<p>To understand how this is possible consider the surface of a balloon, which 
is a good 2D analogy to a 3D closed spherical geometry. Imagine that small 
dots, representing galaxies, are painted on the balloon (see Fig. 5.5). As the 
balloon is inflated, all the dots move away from each other as their relative 
distances increase. Conversely, as the balloon is deflated, all the dots get closer 
to each other. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which dot we focus on, the view is the same.
</p>
<p>One limitation of this 2D analogy is that when a balloon expands, it 
expands into the volume of air surrounding it. So, what does Friedmann&rsquo;s 
universe expand into? Nothing. In the analogy, the surface of the balloon is 
all the 2D space there is. The amount of space (the area) grows as the bal-
loon expands&mdash;but there is nothing outside or inside the surface. Similarly, 
the total volume of a 3D Friedmann universe grows during the expansion 
and decreases during the contraction.
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.4 The Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann (1888&ndash;1925) was 
the first to find time-dependent solutions of Einstein&rsquo;s equations, describing an 
evolving cosmos. During World War I, while Einstein was completing his general 
theory of relativity, Friedmann served as a bomber pilot in the Russian air force. 
He was awarded a George Cross for bravery. Apart from his work in cosmology, 
Friedmann did groundbreaking research in hydrodynamics and meteorology. He 
died of typhoid fever at the age of 37</p>

<p>The history of an evolving closed universe is encapsulated in the space-
time diagram in Fig. 5.6. Here, time runs from the bottom up and hori-
zontal circles represent instantaneous snapshots of the universe (with two 
spatial dimensions suppressed). The initial and final moments were later 
named, somewhat disrespectfully, the big bang and the big crunch. At these 
moments, all matter is compressed into an infinitesimal volume (a single 
point), so the density is infinite. This makes Einstein&rsquo;s equations mathemati-
cally ill defined, so the spacetime cannot be extended beyond these points. 
Such points are called spacetime singularities.

<p>92     5 An Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>According to Friedmann&rsquo;s solution, shortly after the big bang, the expan-
sion of the universe is very fast. Then it is slowed down by the gravitational 
attraction between galaxies, and eventually comes to a halt, followed by 
contraction. This is similar to the motion of a projectile launched vertically 
upwards. The projectile is slowed down by gravity until it reaches some max-
imum height and then falls back to the ground. The greater the initial veloc-
ity, the higher it will go. Similarly, a Friedmann universe will expand to a 
larger radius if the initial expansion rate is increased.
</p>
<p>Friedmann presented his solution in a paper that was published in 1922 
in a German physics journal. Two years later, he published a follow-up paper 
describing an infinite (open) homogeneous and isotropic universe with hyper-
bolic geometry. Once again, he found that such a universe expands from a sin-
gularity of infinite matter density. The expansion slows down initially but it 
never stops completely, with galaxies approaching constant recession speeds at 
late times. This is analogous to a projectile launched at a speed exceeding the 
escape velocity (see Chap. 2). The gravitational pull of the Earth is not strong 
enough to turn it around, and the projectile permanently leaves the Earth.
</p>
<p>The borderline case between open and closed solutions is a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; universe, 
having Euclidean geometry. Such a universe expands forever, but at ever 
decreasing speed, like a projectile launched at exactly the escape  velocity.3 
A 2D analogue for an expanding flat universe is a flat rubber sheet that is 
being uniformly stretched in both directions. The distances between all &ldquo;gal-
axies&rdquo; are then stretched by the same factor (see Fig. 5.7). The sheet can be 
arbitrarily large, and we can imagine it to be infinite. When we say that a 
flat universe has expanded by a certain factor, what we mean is that distances 
between all galaxies have increased by that factor.
</p>

<p>3Friedmann did not consider this borderline case. It was later studied by Einstein and Willem de Sitter.</p>

<p>Friedmann did not give preference to closed or open universe models. 
He wrote: &ldquo;The available data is completely insufficient for any numeri-
cal estimates to find out what kind of universe is ours.&rdquo; Sadly, Friedmann 
died in 1925, before his papers had attracted much attention. The Belgian 
priest Georges Lemaitre rediscovered the expanding universe models in 
1927, but his work also passed unnoticed. All this changed in 1929, when 
Edwin Hubble made what was arguably the most unexpected discovery in 
the history of science: he observed that the universe is indeed expanding! 
Friedmann and Lemaitre were immortalized (Fig. 5.8).
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.8 Georges Lema&icirc;tre (1894&ndash;1966) interrupted his undergraduate studies 
to serve in the Belgian army during World War I. After the war he went back 
to university and earned a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1920. He then went on to 
study for the priesthood, becoming ordained in 1923. By this time Lemaitre 
developed an interest in astronomy, which he pursued at Cambridge, Harvard, 
and then at MIT, where he earned his second Ph.D. In his Ph.D. thesis Lemaitre 
rediscovered Friedmann's solutions of Einstein's equations describing an expand-
ing universe.  He also showed that recession speeds of galaxies in such a universe 
should obey what is now known as the Hubble law&mdash;two years before Hubble&rsquo;s 
discovery.  Lemaitre explained his ideas to Einstein at a conference in Brussels in 
1927&mdash;to which Einstein replied: &ldquo;Your calculations are correct, but your grasp of 
physics is abominable.&rdquo; A few years later Einstein changed his mind.
Being both a Catholic priest and a renowned scientist, Lemaitre saw no conflict 
between science and religion.  He believed that religion should keep to the spir-
itual world, leaving the material world for science.</p>

</p>
<p>As for Einstein, he reportedly quipped that adding the cosmological con-
stant to his equations &ldquo;was the greatest blunder of my life&rdquo;. But even though 
the cosmological constant fell out of favor after the expansion of the uni-
verse was observed, it has since returned to the forefront of physics research, 
and we shall have much more to say about it in the coming chapters.
</p>
<p>Summary
As soon as Einstein had completed the general theory of relativity, he 
applied it to the universe as a whole. Like Newton, Einstein believed that 
the universe was static and eternal, but he soon discovered that his theory 
did not admit such solutions. He then added an extra term to his equations, 
the so-called cosmological term, which endowed the vacuum with a non-
zero (positive) energy density. According to general relativity, the vacuum 
then produces a repulsive gravitational force, which can balance the attrac-
tive gravity of matter. The modified equations had a static solution, describ-
ing a closed, spherical universe, but this model was seriously flawed. It was 
unstable to small perturbations and contradicted one of the most fundamen-
tal laws of Nature&mdash;the second law of thermodynamics.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann found 
dynamical solutions of Einstein&rsquo;s equations describing evolving universes 
that expand from a singular state of infinite density. His closed geometry 
solution describes a finite universe that starts out expanding rapidly, slows 
down, and eventually turns around and starts to collapse. The open geom-
etry solution describes an infinite universe that starts out expanding rap-
idly, and although the expansion slows down, it never stops completely. Flat 
expanding universes are the marginal case, between open and closed. They 
are infinite and galaxies approach a recession speed of zero.

<p>Questions
 1. When Einstein first applied GR to the universe as a whole he assumed 
</p>
<p>that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. This is known as the 
&ldquo;cosmological principle&rdquo;. Is this principle consistent with a universe 
which has a center or an edge?
</p>
<p> 2. Is the distribution of galaxies in Fig. 5.9 homogeneous? Is it isotropic 
about the central galaxy? Is it isotropic about any other galaxy?
</p>
<p> 3. True or false: If the universe is isotropic about every galaxy, it must also 
be homogeneous.
</p>
<p> 4. Why did Einstein add a cosmological constant to his equations of GR?</p>

<p>Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for his heretical ideas in 1600. 
He believed that the stars are like our Sun and appear to be dimmer only 
because of their great distance from us. This was an inspired guess, but how 
can we verify that it is actually true? How far away are the stars? And what 
are they made of?
</p>
<p>These questions bedeviled Isaac Newton. He thought there was a distinc-
tion between the &ldquo;lucid matter&rdquo; of the stars and the &ldquo;opaque matter&rdquo; of the 
Earth and the planets. In a letter to Richard Bentley, where he discussed the 
creation of the Solar System amongst other things, Newton wrote: &ldquo;But how 
the matter should divide itself into two sorts, and that part of it which is to 
compose a shining body should fall down into one mass and make a sun and 
the rest which is fit to compose an opaque body should coalesce, not into 
one great body, like the shining matter, but into many little ones; or if the 
sun at first were an opaque body like the planets or the planets lucid bod-
ies like the sun, how he alone should be changed into a shining body whilst 
all they continue opaque, or all they be changed into opaque ones whilst he 
remains unchanged, I do not think explicable by mere natural causes, but 
am forced to ascribe it to the counsel and contrivance of a voluntary Agent.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>While Newton resorted to divine intervention to explain the separation of 
the Solar System into the lucid Sun, and opaque planets, spectroscopic experi-
ments in the mid 1800s revealed that the Sun and the stars are actually made

<p>of the same chemical elements as the Earth and planets.1 In this chapter we 
will study how spectroscopy allows us to identify chemical elements; even those 
in distant stars. We will also learn how the Doppler effect is used to measure 
velocities of cosmic bodies, and how astronomical distances are determined.
</p>
<p>6.1  Fingerprints of the Elements
</p>
<p>Light coming to us from the stars brings a treasure-trove of information. 
We learned in Chap. 3 that light consists of electromagnetic waves that can 
have a wide range of wavelengths (or frequencies). For visible light, differ-
ent wavelengths correspond to different colors. When a beam of white light 
is shone through a prism, it emerges on the other side having a continuum 
of colors, like a rainbow (see Fig. 6.1a). This continuum spectrum shows that 
white light is composed of many colors, ranging from red to violet.
</p>
<p>Light emitted from a hot gas that is incident on a prism displays an emis-
sion line spectrum&mdash;a pattern of bright lines with particular wavelengths can 
be seen on a black background (Fig. 6.1b). Another interesting phenomenon 
occurs when a beam of white light is passed through cool gas before it gets to 
the prism. The gas absorbs waves having some specific wavelengths, and a pat-
tern of black lines, called absorption lines, appears in the spectrum (Fig. 6.1c). 
The pattern of both emission and absorption lines depends on the composi-
tion of the gas. Atoms of a given chemical element can emit and absorb light 
only at a particular set of wavelengths,2 so the emission or absorption line 
spectrum provides a unique &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; for each element.
</p>
<p>Light that emanates from the hot inner parts of a star has a continuum 
spectrum3 that develops absorption lines as it passes through the cooler stel-
lar atmosphere. Astronomers measure the spectra of stars, and by comparing 
with the absorption lines of gases measured in the laboratory, they can iden-
tify whether elements such as hydrogen, helium, carbon, etc., are present in 
the star. In fact, helium was discovered on the Sun in 1868, well before it 
was found on the Earth in 1895. Stellar spectroscopy has indisputably deter-
mined that stars are indeed made of the same &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; as the Earth.
</p>
<p>2This fact was already known in the mid-1800s, but was explained only much later by quantum 
mechanics.
3Although light emitted by atoms has a discrete line spectrum, in stellar interiors atoms are broken up 
into electrons and nuclei which scatter off one another, producing a continuous spectrum.
</p>
<p>1The development of nuclear physics has led to a detailed understanding of how &ldquo;opaque matter&rdquo; can 
become &ldquo;lucid matter&rdquo; under the right conditions. Even more astonishing is that most of the elements 
from which we are made were actually produced in the stars themselves (as we will discuss later).</p>

<p>6.2  Measuring Velocities
</p>
<p>For nearby stars, like Barnard&rsquo;s star, we can directly calculate how fast the 
star is moving in a direction orthogonal to the line of sight. We do so by 
measuring the star&rsquo;s displacement on photographic plates taken some time 
apart. However, more distant stars are so far away that it is impossible to 
detect their motion and measure their velocities using this method. So how 
do we measure the velocity of astronomical objects? (Fig. 6.2).
</p>
<p>The observed wavelength (color) of light depends on the relative motion 
of the source and the observer. If a source of light is moving towards us, the 
observed wavelength gets shorter&mdash;that is, it shifts towards the blue end of 
the spectrum. Conversely, if a source is moving away from us, the observed 
wavelength will get longer, shifting towards the red end of the spectrum. 
We say the source is blue- or redshifted. This phenomenon, known as the 
Doppler effect, occurs for all kinds of waves, including sound waves and rip-
ples on the surface of water. You have probably experienced it when a siren 
has passed by: an approaching siren has a higher pitch (shorter wavelength) 
than a receding one. As illustrated in Fig. 6.3, the wave crests pile up in

<p>Fig. 6.1 a When white light passes through a prism, it spreads into a continuum 
of colors. b A hot gas emits specific wavelengths that show up as bright lines 
on a black background. c A cold gas absorbs specific wavelengths that are then 
absent from the continuum spectrum. Notice that the emission lines have the 
same wavelengths as the absorption lines (as long as the hot and cold gas are of 
the same type)</p>

wavelength is the distance between the crests, it is easy to see that the wave-
length gets shorter in front and longer in the wake of the source.

<p>6.2 Measuring Velocities     101
</p>
<p>Quantitatively, the Doppler effect for light can be expressed by a simple 
formula:
</p>
<p>where � is the wavelength, v is the relative velocity of the source and 
observer, and c is the speed of light. As before, the symbol � stands for 
&ldquo;change&rdquo;, so �� is the change in the wavelength �. The velocity v is assumed 
to be small compared to c (nonrelativistic motion), and it is taken to be neg-
ative if the source is approaching and positive if it is receding. (Note: � is the 
emitted wavelength, and �� = �o &minus; �, where �o is the wavelength measured 
by the observer.) The redshift z is defined as
</p>
<p>Thus, using Eq. (6.1), we note that for nonrelativistic motion, z = v/c.
For a moving star, the entire spectrum gets blue- or redshifted, includ-
</p>
<p>ing the black absorption lines. Astronomers identify line patterns of different 
elements and measure how much these patterns are shifted relative to a sam-
ple at rest in the laboratory. Equation (6.1) can then be used to determine 
the velocity of the star.4 It is hard to overstate the crucial role spectroscopy 
and the Doppler effect play in our endeavor to understand the universe.
</p>
<p>6.3  Measuring Distances
</p>
<p>The determination of distances to astronomical objects is notoriously dif-
ficult and has dominated much of twentieth century astronomy. Today 
astronomers use a variety of techniques to measure distances&mdash;each one is 
most useful within a given range. Distances to nearby stars can be found 
by measuring their parallax, which is the apparent movement of the star 
relative to the background sky as the Earth rotates around the Sun (see 
Fig. 6.4). Demonstrating the effect of parallax is so simple that anyone can 
do it&mdash;you don&rsquo;t even need a telescope! If you stretch out your arm, hold up

or away from us. Transverse velocities in the orthogonal directions cannot be measured in this way.</p>

<p>your thumb, and alternately close your right and left eyes, you will see that 
your thumb appears to alternate between two different positions relative to 
the back of the room. From some simple geometry, knowing the distance 
between your eyes (the &ldquo;baseline&rdquo;), and the angular shift of your thumb 
(twice the parallax angle), you can determine the distance to your thumb.
</p>
<p>The parallax is used to define an astronomical unit of distance, called a par-
sec (pc). One parsec is the distance at which a star would have a parallax of 
1&Prime;;5 it is equal to about 3.3 light years. In this book we will usually express 
distances in light years, and not parsecs. Since parallactic angles are very small, 
it becomes extremely hard to measure them for objects that are more than 
about 100 light years away.
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.4 The apparent shift in position of a nearby star relative to very distant 
background stars allows us to determine the nearby star&rsquo;s distance. The Earth&rsquo;s 
orbital diameter can be used as a baseline if we view the star at the beginning 
and end of a 6 month period. In reality (unlike the figure) the distance to the 
stars is much greater than the Earth&rsquo;s orbit, so the parallax angle is very small

<p>5An arc second is a measure of angle. There are 360&deg; in a full circle, 60&prime; in a degree, and 60&Prime; in an arc 
minute. An arc second is a tiny angular measure (it is about the angle subtended by a dime placed 4 km 
away).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.3 Measuring Distances     103
</p>
<p>While 100 light years seems like a large distance, our nearby neighbor, 
the Andromeda galaxy, is 2.5 million light years away. So parallax measure-
ments can be seen as a first rung in what we call the cosmic distance ladder. 
Astronomers use a variety of so called standard candles to extend the reach of 
our distance measurements. Although none of them is perfect, they all work 
on the following premise: if we know how intrinsically luminous a light 
source is, and we measure how bright it appears, we can figure out how far 
away it is. The key relation is that the brightness of a light source decreases 
with the square of its distance,
</p>
<p>The luminosity L is the energy of light emitted by the source per second. As 
the light travels a distance d from the source, this energy gets spread over 
a sphere of area 4πd2, and the apparent brightness b decreases accordingly 
(see Fig. 6.5).
</p>
<p>Pulsating stars, called Cepheids, are particularly useful standard can-
dles. Their brightness varies periodically, with periods ranging from days 
to months. A remarkable property of Cepheids, discovered in 1912 by 
Henrietta Leavitt of Harvard College Observatory, is that they display a 
tight relationship between their period of variation (which is easy to meas-
ure) and their luminosity, as shown in Fig. 6.7. Thus by measuring the 
period, we can deduce the luminosity L. We can also measure the apparent 
brightness b, and once we know L and b, we can use Eq. (6.3) to determine 
the distance to the star. Cepheids can be used to measure distances up to 
about 10 million light years (Fig. 6.6).
</p>
<p>Today astronomers use extremely powerful stellar explosions, called superno-
vae, as standard candles. Although there are many kinds of supernovae, with 
differing properties, Type 1a supernovae have very uniform luminosities and

yet fully understood, but the most plausible cause is a thermonuclear explo-
sion of a white dwarf star.6 There appear to be two mechanisms to trigger the 
 explosion. Firstly, if a white dwarf has a companion star, from which it can

from Radcliff College, but being a woman she was unable to work as an offi-
cial academic. Instead she found work as a &ldquo;human computer&rdquo; (with many other 
women) at Harvard College Observatory, where she earned the equivalent pay 
of a servant. She was a quiet, hard working woman, whose seminal discovery of 
the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid stars made it possible for astrono-
mers to measure the Universe. Despite the importance of her discovery, Leavitt 
received almost no credit in her lifetime. A member of the Swedish Academy of 
Sciences tried to nominate her for the Nobel Prize in 1924, only to discover that 
she had died of cancer three years earlier, at the age of 53

<p>6When an ordinary star (with a mass similar to the Sun&rsquo;s) depletes its nuclear fuel, it becomes a very 
dense compact white dwarf star. The pull of gravity in a white dwarf is balanced by the pressure of the 
material within the star.</p>

<p>accrete material, it may gain so much mass that gravity overwhelms the pres-
sure forces, and the white dwarf starts to collapse. This ignites a runaway 
thermonuclear reaction, and the white dwarf star is completely blown away. 
An alternative scenario is a collision of two white dwarfs. When the two stars 
merge, their combined mass exceeds the stability threshold, and once again this 
leads to collapse. Whatever the mechanism, there is strong observational evi-
dence that Type 1a supernovae have nearly the same peak luminosity. By meas-
uring the apparent brightness of such supernovae and knowing the luminosity, 
the distance to the host galaxy can be determined. These powerful beacons 
have allowed astronomers to chart the universe out to billions of light years 
(Fig. 6.8).
</p>
<p>6.4  The Birth of Extragalactic Astronomy
</p>
<p>By the turn of the 20th century, astronomers had identified two types of 
objects outside our Solar System&mdash;point-like stars and faint, fuzzy extended 
objects called nebulae. The great question of the day was &ldquo;What is the nature 
of the nebulae?&rdquo; There were two rival theories. The first theory advocated that 
there was nothing but empty space beyond our Galaxy. Nebulae were con-
sidered to be objects within the Galaxy, probably sites of star formation. The 
opposing view held that nebulae were distant &ldquo;island universes&rdquo; in their own 
right, similar to our Galaxy. This contentious question resulted in &ldquo;The Great 
Debate&rdquo; between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, held in 1920 at the 
Museum of Natural History in Washington. The debate ended inconclusively,

</p>
<p>but the issue was definitively resolved in 1923, when Edwin Hubble estab-
lished that the nebulae were other island universes, completely separate from 
our Galaxy (Fig. 6.9).
</p>
<p>Hubble identified Cepheid variable stars in Andromeda and several other 
nebulae. Using Leavitt&rsquo;s period-luminosity relation, he was then able to 
determine the distances to these nebulae. Today we know that Andromeda 
is about 2.5 million light years away&mdash;roughly 50 times the radius of the 
Milky Way. Hubble&rsquo;s initial estimate of 1.5 million light years was signifi-
cantly lower. However, it was still large enough to show that the nebulae 
must include billions of stars; and that they are indeed &ldquo;island universes&rdquo; 
similar to our own Galaxy. We now call them galaxies (Fig. 6.10).
</p>
<p>Summary
Each chemical element displays a characteristic pattern of spectral lines. By 
analyzing the spectra of light coming from stars and galaxies we can deter-
mine their chemical composition. Furthermore, the spectral lines may be 
shifted relative to a laboratory sample here on Earth. From this shift we can 
determine velocities using the Doppler effect. Distances to nearby stars can 
be found using stellar parallax, while for more distant objects astronomers 
use a variety of &ldquo;standard candles&rdquo; like Cepheid stars and supernovae. In par-

<p>In the early 1900s, Vesto M. Slipher of the Lowell observatory in Arizona 
analyzed the spectra of many spiral nebulae. He found that most of them 
mysteriously had spectral lines that were red-shifted, indicating that they 
were moving away from the Earth, some at speeds of up to 1000 km/s. 
Motion at high speed is not uncommon in the cosmos&mdash;the Sun, for exam-
ple, orbits around the center of our Galaxy at 300 km/s. The puzzling thing 
about Slipher&rsquo;s result was that the nebulae conspired to move predominantly 
away from us, as if in a display of some cosmic rejection (Fig. 7.1).
</p>
<p>Hubble set out to investigate Slipher&rsquo;s curious findings. He started by 
measuring distances to an extended sample of nebulae, now recognized as 
galaxies. Unfortunately, Cepheids were too faint to be observed in all but the 
nearest galaxies, so Hubble had to find a new standard candle. He noticed 
that the brightest stars, in those galaxies whose distances he could meas-
ure (using Cepheids), had about the same luminosity, so he used them as 
standard candles, extending the cosmic distance ladder. In the meantime, 
Hubble&rsquo;s assistant Milton Humason extended Slipher&rsquo;s redshift measure-
ments to a larger set of galaxies. Hubble then plotted the redshifts obtained 
by Slipher and Humason versus his distance estimates. He published his 
findings in 1929&mdash;and our view of the universe has never been the same 
(Fig. 7.2).

<p>110     7 Hubble&rsquo;s Law and the Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>7.1  An Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>Hubble uncovered a very simple relation between the speed at which a gal-
axy moves away from us and the distance to the galaxy1: the speed grows 
proportionally to the distance. The further away the galaxy is, the greater is 
its speed. If you double the distance, the speed is also doubled. This is the 
celebrated Hubble law (Fig. 7.3).
</p>
<p>Mathematically, the Hubble law can be stated as follows
</p>
<p>(7.1)v = H0d
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.1 Vesto Slipher undertook the painstaking task of obtaining spectra for 
various spiral nebulae because he wanted to understand the origin of the Sun 
and planets. At the time, it was commonly thought that spiral nebulae might be 
other Solar systems in the process of forming

<p>Fig. 7.2 Edwin Hubble (1889&ndash;1953) made some of the most important dis-
coveries in modern astronomy. He showed that our Milky Way is only one of a 
multitude of galaxies scattered throughout the cosmos. His greatest achieve-
ment though was the discovery of the expansion of the universe. After graduat-
ing from Law school at Oxford University, and a short stint practicing Law and 
then teaching at a high school, Hubble obtained a Ph.D. in Astronomy at the 
University of Chicago in 1917. He was offered a job at Mt Wilson Observatory, 
which he took up only after first enlisting in the US Army to fight Germany. 
Hubble was a talented athlete, excelling in track and boxing amongst other 
sports. Had he not died suddenly from a stroke at the age of 63, he most prob-
ably would have been awarded a Nobel Prize, something that was impossi-
ble earlier in his career, as astronomers were then not eligible. Credit  Hale

</p>
<p>2Because of uncertainties in distance measurements, it took scientists more than half a century to con-
verge on this value: Hubble&rsquo;s original estimate was 4 times higher.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>112     7 Hubble&rsquo;s Law and the Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>At first sight it may appear that the Hubble law implies that we are located 
right at the center of some gigantic explosion. But the work of Friedmann 
and Lemaitre demonstrated that cosmic expansion need not have a center. 
In a homogeneous and isotropic expanding universe, all observers see the 
surrounding galaxies recede. Moreover, it is not difficult to understand that 
they must recede according to the Hubble law.
</p>
<p>Once again, we can picture an expanding universe using the rubber sheet 
analogy (see Fig. 7.4). The sheet is uniformly stretched in both directions, 
and the dots on the surface of the sheet represent galaxies. Suppose, for the 
sake of argument, that the sheet has been stretched to twice its original size 
in one second. The dots that were initially 1 cm apart are now 2 cm apart, so 
they separated at the speed of 1 cm/s. At the same time, the dots that were 
2 cm apart are now 4 cm apart and therefore separated at 2 cm/s&mdash;twice 
the speed of the first pair of dots. You can easily convince yourself that the 
speed at which any two dots separate is proportional to the distance between 
them. But this is precisely the Hubble law. It thus appears that we live in an 
expanding universe.

<p>7.2 A Beginning of the Universe?     113
</p>
<p>7.2  A Beginning of the Universe?
</p>
<p>The implications of Hubble&rsquo;s discovery were truly mind-boggling. If the 
distances between galaxies are getting larger, they must have been smaller 
at earlier times. As we follow the motion of galaxies back in time, they get 
closer and closer together, until they all merge at some moment of time in 
the past. This seems to imply that the expansion of the universe must have 
had a beginning. Was that the beginning of our world?
</p>
<p>The problem of the origin of the universe, which had for centuries been 
the province of philosophers and theologians, had thus invaded the world 
of physicists and astronomers. Friedmann&rsquo;s models suggested that the whole 
universe began at a singular event a finite time ago. But for many this was 
too much to take. &ldquo;Philosophically, the notion of a beginning of the pre-
sent order of Nature is repugnant to me,&rdquo; wrote Sir Arthur Eddington, a 
prominent British astronomer. &ldquo;As a scientist I simply do not believe that 
the Universe began with a bang.&rdquo; Einstein was equally disturbed. In a letter 
to the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter he wrote: &ldquo;To admit such possi-
bilities seems senseless.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>And indeed, a cosmic beginning a finite time ago appeared to raise a host 
of perplexing problems. What actually happened at the beginning? And 
what caused it to happen? What determined the initial state of the universe? 
In the wake of Hubble&rsquo;s discovery, no obvious answers presented themselves. 
But once these problems came into focus, much of the further progress in 
cosmology was driven by attempts to understand the early stages of the 
expansion, what caused the expansion to begin, and ultimately how&mdash;and 
whether&mdash;the universe came into being.

</p>
<p>7.3  The Steady State Theory
</p>
<p>Most physicists hoped that Hubble&rsquo;s discovery would somehow be explained 
without having to postulate that the universe had a beginning. The most 
notorious attempt of this kind was the &ldquo;steady state theory&rdquo;, proposed in 
1948 by Fred Hoyle, Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold, all at Cambridge 
University. This theory was based on the so-called &ldquo;perfect cosmological 
principle&rdquo;, which asserts that the universe looks more or less the same at all 
times, at all places, and in all directions. An obvious implication is that the 
universe had no beginning in time. But how could this picture be reconciled 
with the fact that the universe was known to be expanding? Surely the dis-
tances between galaxies would grow and the average matter density would 
dilute?
</p>
<p>To compensate for the expansion, Hoyle, Bondi and Gold proposed that 
matter is continuously created out of the vacuum, so that the average mat-
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.5 Fred Hoyle (1915&ndash;2001) is best known for his contribution to the the-
ory of stellar nucleosynthesis, explaining how heavy elements were formed in 
the interiors of stars. He was also the main proponent of the steady state the-
ory and an ardent opponent of the big bang model. Yet ironically he coined 
the term "big bang" (in derision) during a radio broadcast for the BBC in 1949.

<p>7.3 The Steady State Theory     115
</p>
<p>ter density remains constant. To achieve this, only a few atoms per cubic 
kilometer per century would need to materialize. So instead of one sudden 
creation of all matter, a very small amount of matter would need to be con-
tinuously created (Fig. 7.5).
</p>
<p>Many physicists supported the steady state model on philosophical 
grounds. But ultimately, it was proven wrong. One steady state prediction 
was that distant galaxies, which we see as they were billions of years ago, 
should look more or less the same as galaxies in our neighborhood. We now 
know that distant galaxies are smaller, have irregular shapes and are popu-
lated by very bright, short-lived stars. Unlike nearby galaxies, many of them 
are powerful sources of radio waves.
</p>
<p>The final demise of the steady state theory came with the discovery of 
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation in the mid-1960s. 
The detection of the CMB proved that the early universe was very hot, and 
the hot big bang model emerged as the standard cosmological paradigm. 
Cosmologists had to accept that dealing with the beginning of the universe 
was an unavoidable workplace hazard!
</p>
<p>7.4  The Scale Factor
</p>
<p>As the universe expands, the distances between all galaxies are stretched by 
the same factor. Similarly, if we go back in time, all distances are contracted 
by the same factor. The factor by which the distances change as we go from 
the present cosmic time t0 to some future or past time t is called the scale 
 factor; it is denoted by a(t).
</p>
<p>If two galaxies are currently separated by a distance d0 then their separa-
tion at any other time t is
</p>
<p>At the present time t0, the scale factor is conventionally defined to be 
a(t0) = 1; at earlier times a(t) &lt; 1, at later times a(t) &gt; 1, and at the big 
bang a(t = 0) = 0. The relative velocity of a pair of galaxies is given by 
the rate of change of their distance. We write v = ḋ, where an overdot is 
the standard physics notation for &ldquo;the rate of change&rdquo;. (If you are familiar 
with calculus, you will recognize that ḋ is the derivative of the distance with 
respect to time.) From Eq. (7.3) we find
</p>
<p>(7.3)d = a(t)d0.
</p>
<p>(7.4)v = ȧ(t)d0</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>116     7 Hubble&rsquo;s Law and the Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>where ȧ is the rate of change of the scale factor.3 Thus, the relative velocity 
of the galaxies depends on how fast the scale factor changes with time. The 
Hubble parameter can now be found from H = v/d, which gives [using 
Eqs. (7.3) and (7.4)]
</p>
<p>Thus the Hubble parameter at any time is equal to the rate at which the 
scale factor is changing divided by the scale factor at that time. It is impor-
tant to note that the Hubble parameter (or Hubble constant, as it is some-
times called) is constant in space, but it can change with time.
</p>
<p>7.5  Cosmological Redshift
</p>
<p>So far we have explained the observed redshift of light by the Doppler effect, 
due to the motion of galaxies away from us. We can now give an alternative 
interpretation, which is simpler: as the light waves travel to us, their wave-
length is stretched by cosmic expansion (see Fig. 7.6).
</p>
<p>When light leaves a distant galaxy at some time t, it starts off with a cer-
tain wavelength �. By the time it reaches us, the universe has increased in

</p>

<p>3If we multiply some variable by a constant, its rate of change gets multiplied by the same constant.</p>

<p>size by the factor 1/a(t), and the wavelength of light is stretched by the same 
factor. The wavelength �0 observed at present on Earth can be found from
</p>
<p>The cosmological redshift z is defined as the fractional change in the wave-
length,
</p>
<p>and we have a relation between redshift and scale factor,4
</p>
<p>Thus, by measuring the redshift of light coming from a distant galaxy, we 
know immediately by how much the universe has expanded since the light 
was emitted.
</p>
<p>7.6  The Age of the Universe
</p>
<p>If the universe began a finite time ago, then how old is it? To find out, we 
can follow the motion of galaxies back in time and evaluate how long it 
takes until they merge at the big bang. For a rough estimate, we shall first 
neglect the effect of gravity. Under this condition, any given pair of galax-
ies moves at a constant relative speed. Consider two galaxies at a distance 
d from one another. According to Hubble&rsquo;s law, they move apart at speed 
v = H0d. If they have always moved at this speed, then the time elapsed 
since the big bang is

</p>
<p>4For light emitted at an early epoch, when the universe was much smaller than it is today, we have 
a(t) ≪ 1 and z ≫ 1. Note that in this regime Eq. (6.1) for the Doppler shift cannot be used. It applies 
only to light sources moving at speeds small compared to the speed of light, that is, only to z ≪ 1. (The 
symbols &ldquo;≪&rdquo; and &ldquo;≫&rdquo; mean &ldquo;much less than&rdquo; and &ldquo;much greater than&rdquo; respectively).</p>

<p>118     7 Hubble&rsquo;s Law and the Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>Note that this time is independent of the distance d, so it is the same for all 
pairs of galaxies. Cosmologists call 1/H0 the &ldquo;Hubble time&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>We can improve this estimate, by taking into account that the universe 
actually has a time-varying expansion rate. Early in its history the universe 
decelerated due to gravity, while later on it began a period of accelerated 
expansion (for reasons to be discussed later). It turns out that these two 
effects almost cancel one another. The best modern estimates taking all the 
details into account give an age of 13.77 billion years. It is quite remarkable 
that less than 100 years ago, we did not even know that the universe con-
tained other galaxies, yet today we can calculate the age of the universe to 
within a half of a percent.
</p>
<p>7.7  The Hubble Distance and the Cosmic 
Horizon
</p>
<p>Hubble&rsquo;s law tells us that the velocities of galaxies grow in proportion to 
their distance. It follows that the velocities can get arbitrarily large for galax-
ies sufficiently far away. This may sound alarming, since motion faster than 
light appears to contradict special relativity. But in fact there is no contradic-
tion. It is important to realize that the expansion of the universe is an expan-
sion of space, not an expansion of galaxies into some pre-existing space. The 
theory of relativity requires that objects cannot move past one another faster 
than the speed of light, but there is no limit to how fast the space between 
objects can expand. The distance beyond which galaxies recede faster than 
the speed of light is called the Hubble distance. We can find it by setting 
v = c in Eq. (7.1) and solving for d; this gives
</p>
<p>Another important distance scale is set by our cosmic horizon. In a universe 
of a finite age, there is a limit to how far we can see into space. The distance 
that light has traveled since the big bang is finite, and light sources that are 
too far away cannot be seen, simply because their light has not yet reached 
the Earth. We can imagine ourselves at the center of a gigantic sphere&mdash;the 
observable part of the universe. The boundary of this sphere is called the 
particle horizon; its radius dhor is the distance to the most remote objects 
(&ldquo;particles&rdquo;) that we can possibly observe. We shall refer to the particle hori-
zon as simply &ldquo;the horizon&rdquo; and will use the term &ldquo;particle horizon&rdquo; only

</p>
<p>where it can be confused with another kind of horizon&mdash;the event horizon, 
which we shall later encounter.
</p>
<p>Since the age of the universe is t0 &asymp; 14 &times; 10
9y, you might think that 
</p>
<p>the horizon distance is simply ct0 &asymp; 14 &times; 10
9ly. You would be right if the 
</p>
<p>distance from us to cosmological light sources did not change with time. 
But in an expanding universe a given source moves away from us while its 
light travels towards the Earth. Thus, by the time we detect the source, it is 
at a greater distance than when its light was emitted. For the most remote 
observable sources, the emission time is close to the big bang. The source 
was then much closer to us than it is now, and its present distance depends 
on the entire expansion history of the universe from the big bang to the pre-
sent time. Calculations based on our current understanding of this history 
give the horizon distance
</p>
<p>about 3 times larger than the na&iuml;ve estimate. In upcoming chapters we will 
learn that the evolution of the early universe was first dominated by radia-
tion, then matter and finally by &ldquo;dark energy&rdquo;. All of these components 
cause the horizon to grow in different ways (when radiation dominated, 
the horizon grew the slowest, and when dark energy becomes dominant, 
the horizon grows the fastest.). For a matter dominated universe with a flat 
geometry, dhor(t) = 3 ct. This gives dhor &asymp; 42 &times; 10
</p>
<p>9ly, slightly less than 
the actual horizon distance given in Eq. (7.11). For our purposes, an order 
of magnitude estimate for the horizon and Hubble distances at any cosmic 
time t can be found from the relation
</p>
<p>Light propagation and the horizon in an expanding universe are illustrated 
in a spacetime diagram in Fig. 7.7. The worldline of our galaxy is along the 
vertical axis, and the worldlines of a few other galaxies are plotted as blue 
curves. The galaxies get closer together as we go back in time and merge at 
the big bang. The slope of the curves tells us how fast the galaxies are mov-
ing away: the more steeply the curve slopes upward, the slower is the reces-
sion speed. We see from the figure that the speed grows with the distance, 
as required by the Hubble law. We can also tell how the recession speed 
changes with time for a given galaxy. The galaxies initially move apart at very 
high speeds. Then, as one might expect, they are slowed down by gravity. 
But about 5 billion years ago their motion begins to accelerate. We shall dis-
cuss the reason for this unexpected phenomenon in Chap. 9.

</p>
<p>Light propagation is indicated by a green line in the diagram. This line 
marks our past light cone. Note that it is rather different from straight-line 
propagation at a 45&deg; angle that we would have in flat space. At early times, 
close to the big bang, light is dragged along by the expanding space, so light 
emitted in our direction initially moves away from us. It later turns around 
and, as it propagates through slower expanding space, finally approaches our 
galaxy along a 45&deg; line.
</p>
<p>Distant galaxies are now observed as they were at earlier times; these times 
can be found by looking at intersections of our past light cone (the green 
line) with worldlines of the galaxies. For example, the supernova marked in 
the figure occurred about 7.5 billion years ago in a galaxy that was about 
7 Bly(billion light years) away at that time. The present distance to that gal-
axy is 10 Bly. As we look at more remote galaxies, the intersection occurs 
at earlier times, until we reach the galaxy whose worldline just touches our 
past light cone at the big bang. This galaxy is now about 46 Bly away. There 
are certainly more distant galaxies, but they cannot be observed, since their 
worldlines do not cross our past light cone. Thus, dhor &asymp; 46Bly is the cos-
mic horizon distance.
</p>
<p>7.8  Not Everything is Expanding
</p>
<p>Since the universe is expanding, you may be wondering whether or not the 
Solar System, the Earth, or perhaps even you yourself are expanding as well. 
Don&rsquo;t worry, you are not expanding! Objects that are bound together by 
forces, like atoms, planets, stars, galaxies, and even groups of galaxies, are 
not undergoing Hubble expansion.

<p>7.8 Not Everything is Expanding     121
</p>
<p>As in the rubber sheet analogy, we can imagine some objects in an 
expanding universe which are fixed in space, while the space itself is being 
stretched by cosmic expansion. We shall refer to such objects as comoving. 
Galaxies are comoving, but only approximately: in addition to Hubble 
expansion, they move under the action of gravitational forces. There are 
many beautiful photographs of galaxies colliding (see Fig. 7.8); in fact, our 
Milky Way and Andromeda are falling toward one another and will col-
lide in about 4 billion years. However, on the largest scales, when we ignore 
these relatively &ldquo;local&rdquo; motions, all matter obeys Hubble&rsquo;s Law. Note that 
electric and magnetic fields in electromagnetic waves are not bound together 
by any force; that is why the light waves do get stretched.
</p>
<p>Summary
Distant galaxies are moving away from the Milky Way, indicating that the 
universe is expanding. A simple relation between the speed at which a gal-
axy recedes from us and the distance to the galaxy was discovered by Edwin 
Hubble in 1929: the speed grows proportionally to the distance. This is now 
known as Hubble&rsquo;s Law. It suggests that there is no preferred center to the 
expansion (all observers see galaxies receding away from their host galaxy), 
that the universe was much denser in the past than it is today, and that the 
universe had a beginning in time, the big bang, roughly 14 billion years ago.

example is the distance between the Earth and Sun expanding? What 
about the distance between your head and toes?

<p> 6.  The Andromeda galaxy is moving towards us. Does this fact falsify 
Hubble&rsquo;s Law? Explain.
</p>
<p> 7.  A universe expanding according to the Hubble law, v = Hd, remains 
homogeneous and isotropic if it was homogeneous and isotropic to 
begin with. In such a universe, observers in any galaxy will see other 
galaxies receding according to the same law. Would these properties still 
hold if instead of the Hubble law the recession speeds of galaxies were 
proportional to the square of their distance, v = Hd2?
</p>
<p> 8.  Using Hubble&rsquo;s law and the nonrelativistic redshift formula z = v/c, cal-
culate the distance to a galaxy that has a measured redshift of z = 0.01

and determined that their wavelengths are 1.5 times greater than the 
corresponding wavelengths in the carbon spectrum on Earth. By how 
much has the universe expanded since the time this light was emitted?
</p>
<p> 10.  If the expansion of the universe has always been decelerating since the 
big bang, is the Hubble time greater than or less than the age of the uni-
verse? (Hint: suppose you and your friend are running a race. At some 
point you catch up with each other and momentarily have the same 
velocity. If your friend has always run with this constant velocity, and 
if you started out faster and have been decelerating, which one of you 
must have started the race first?)

<p> 11.  A pulse of light is emitted from a source towards an observer, who is 
initially at rest with respect to the source. Consider the following two 
scenarios:
 (a)  After the pulse is emitted, the observer starts moving rapidly away 
</p>
<p>from the source. He stops when the distance between him and the 
source doubles; soon after that the pulse reaches the observer. The 
universe does not expand in this scenario.</p>

<p> (b)  After the pulse is emitted, the universe starts expanding and 
expands by a factor of 2, so the distance between the observer and 
the source is stretched by the same factor. After expansion stops, the 
light reaches the observer. Will the observer detect any redshift in 
either of these situations?

<p> 12.  Eternal, static models of the universe are in conflict with the second law 
of thermodynamics. Explain why an expanding universe can avoid this

<p> 13.  Models assuming that the universe is static and infinite suffer from 
Olbers&rsquo; paradox: each line of sight encounters a star, so the entire sky 
should be shining like the surface of the Sun. Explain why an expanding 
universe of a finite age does not have this problem.

<p>Will the universe continue to expand forever, or will it eventually halt and 
start to collapse? We shall see that this question has a rather simple answer 
that depends only on the average density of the universe, ρ.1 The larger the 
density, the stronger is the force of gravity that slows down the expansion. 
If ρ is greater than a certain critical value, ρc, expansion will be followed by 
contraction, and the universe will end in a big crunch. Otherwise, the expan-
sion will continue eternally, and the universe will grow colder and darker as 
the stars exhaust their nuclear fuel, and the galaxies get further and further 
apart. Our goal in this chapter is to calculate the critical density ρc. Then, in 
the following chapter, we will discuss the measured value of the average den-
sity ρ and compare it to ρc.

<p>8.1  The Critical Density
</p>
<p>It is a fortunate happenstance that one does not need to employ the full 
blown mathematical machinery of general relativity to determine the critical 
density&mdash;a Newtonian analysis will lead to the correct result and will offer 
useful insights along the way. So let us start by considering an expanding 
spherical region of radius R, which represents a portion of the expanding 
universe. We will imagine that our hypothetical sphere is uniformly sprin-
kled with galaxies, which we will call &ldquo;particles&rdquo;. Now let us consider the

tational effect of the rest of the sphere on this test particle is the same as if 
the sphere&rsquo;s mass, M, were concentrated at the center. Also, the distribution 
of matter outside the sphere has no effect on our test particle (or any other 
particle within the sphere), as discussed in Chap. 2 (Fig. 8.1).
</p>
<p>As the sphere expands, the particle (and the rest of the sphere) will be 
slowed down by gravity, and will either come to a halt and collapse, or will 
keep expanding forever. So how do we determine the outcome? We use 
energy conservation (this is exactly the same principle that was used when 
we calculated the escape speed for a projectile in Chap. 2). The particle&rsquo;s 
energy is the sum of its kinetic and gravitational potential energy, and is 
given by
</p>
<p>The mass of the test particle is m, its velocity is v, M is the mass of the whole 
sphere, and R is the distance of the particle to the center of the sphere. The 
way the sphere behaves depends on whether the total energy is negative, pos-
itive or zero.
</p>
<p>If the total energy is negative, the particle will stop and fall back inwards. 
Indeed, the whole sphere will collapse. To understand why this is the case, 
consider the two terms that contribute to the total energy. As the particle 
gets further and further away, the negative potential energy term gets smaller 
and smaller, while the kinetic energy term is always positive. Thus, in order 
for the total energy to be conserved, the particle has to stop and turn around

ing on what the residual velocity would be at infinity). On the other hand, if 
the total energy is positive, then the expansion will continue, and the veloc-
ity will approach a constant value (can you determine what this value is in 
terms of E?). There is a third possibility&mdash;the energy could be zero,

<p>This is called the critical case. The density in this case is called the critical

<p>Note that ρc does not depend on the arbitrary radius R of the sphere. Note 
also that ρc is time-dependent because H is time-dependent.
</p>
<p>Thus, using energy conservation, we have found that if the sphere (or the 
universe) has the critical density given by Eq. (8.3), expansion will continue 
forever, but at a speed that approaches zero (as the potential energy goes to 
zero, so too must the kinetic energy and hence the velocity). If the average 
density ρ &gt; ρc, the expansion will halt, and will be followed by contraction 
and collapse. And if ρ &lt; ρc, the universe will expand forever.

<p>The density parameter is defined as the ratio of the actual (average) density

</p>
<p>We can recast the results of the previous sections of this chapter in terms of 
this parameter. If � &gt; 1, the universe eventually collapses; and if � &le; 1, the

ies approach constant recession speeds (different for different pairs of galaxies);

<p>3This is not just a lucky coincidence. Newtonian gravity is a good approximation to GR when (1) the 
gravitational field is weak and (2) the velocities are small compared to the speed of light. Are these con-
ditions satisfied in our calculation? When the radius of the sphere R is sufficiently small, they are. Since 
R is an arbitrary parameter in our calculation, we can choose it to be small enough to ensure that the 
Newtonian approximation is indeed valid.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.2 The Density Parameter     129
</p>
<p> addition, it turns out that the value of the density parameter also determines the 
geometry of the universe. This geometrical link can only be understood using 
general relativity. A closed Friedmann universe that we discussed in Chap. 5 
has � &gt; 1; his open model has � &lt; 1; and a flat universe has � = 1. The rela-
tion between the geometry of the universe, its fate, and the density parameter is 
 summarized in Fig. 8.3.
</p>
<p>Thus it seems as though we only have to measure � in order to determine 
the fate of the universe. However, things are not quite so straightforward&mdash;
the analysis in this chapter makes use of certain assumptions regarding the 
contents of the universe; we will revisit the issue of our cosmic fate in the 
next chapter, when another important component of the universe will be 
introduced.
</p>
<p>Summary
The fate of the universe is determined by its average density ρ. If ρ is larger 
than a certain critical value ρc, the force of gravity will slow the expansion 
down, until it halts; then the universe will contract and collapse to a big 
crunch. If ρ &lt; ρc, the universe will continue expanding forever, with galax-
ies ultimately reaching constant recession velocities. A critical density uni-
verse with ρ = ρc will also expand forever, but at an ever decreasing rate. 
Underlying these conclusions, there are certain assumptions about the con-
tents of the universe; we revisit the issue of our cosmic fate in the next chapter.

</p>
<p>The average density also determines the geometry of the universe: the uni-
verse is closed if ρ &gt; ρc, open (hyperbolic) if ρ &lt; ρc, and flat if ρ = ρc.
</p>
<p>This relation between the average density and geometry holds regardless 
of the contents of the universe.

<p>Questions
1.  What properties of the universe determine whether or not it will expand

<p>forever?
2.  In terms of M and R, what velocity does the test particle have in 
</p>
<p>Eq. (8.2)? Can you interpret what this velocity means? If a test particle 
had less than this specific velocity, would it continue to move radially 
outwards, or would it fall back inwards?
</p>
<p>3.  Explain why gravitational potential energy is negative? Hint: Consider 
two objects falling towards one another from rest at a large initial dis-
tance, and think about energy conservation.
</p>
<p>4.  How is launching a projectile into space similar to the expansion of the 
universe?
</p>
<p>5.  At earlier cosmic times the Hubble parameter H was greater than it is 
now. Can you explain why?
</p>
<p>6.  Suppose astronomers living at an early epoch, when the Hubble parame-
ter H had twice its present value H0, set out to determine the fate of the 
universe. They want to measure the density of the universe and compare 
it to the critical density ρc. Is the value of ρc at that epoch the same as it 
is now? If not, how does it differ?
</p>
<p>7. Why is � such an important parameter?
8.  Does the density parameter � change with time? If � is greater than one 
</p>
<p>at some moment, can it become less than one at a later time?
9.  Do you have a philosophical preference for a universe that ends in fire

<p>(the Big Crunch) or ice (expanding eternally)?</p>

<p>The composition of the heavens was a great mystery until the spectroscopic 
discoveries of the mid 1800s showed that the chemical elements in stars are 
the same as those on Earth (as we discussed in Chap. 6). But today we find 
ourselves grappling once again with a great mystery relating to the composi-
tion of the universe. We now have good reason to believe that most of the 
universe is in fact not made of ordinary atomic matter.
</p>
<p>Understanding the composition of the universe is of great interest in 
its own right. In addition, accounting for all the matter in the universe is 
important for predicting its future evolution. In Chap. 8 we learned that 
the fate of the universe and its large-scale geometry depend on whether the 
density parameter, � = ρ
</p>
<p>ρc
, is less than, equal to, or greater than one. We 
</p>
<p>have already calculated the critical mass density ρc, so now let us turn to the 
measurement of the average mass density ρ. We shall see that this pursuit 
led to the discovery of dark matter. We will also discuss the surprising emer-
gence of another major component of the universe called dark energy.
</p>
<p>9.1  The Average Mass Density of the Universe 
and Dark Matter
</p>
<p>On large enough scales, galaxies are approximately evenly distributed 
through space. Thus to calculate the average mass density, ρ, of the universe, 
a reasonable proposition seems to be to add up the masses of a large num-
ber of galaxies that span a sufficiently large volume, and then divide by that

<p>volume. So, how does one determine the mass of each galaxy in our sample 
volume? One approach is based on galactic luminosity. Astronomers can use 
the amount and spectrum of light from a galaxy to estimate the number and 
types of its constituent stars. One can then add up the stellar masses, yield-
ing a mass for the luminous matter in the galaxy. By doing so, one obtains 
�stars &asymp; 0.005. This is much smaller than unity, but we should not be too 
quick to conclude that the universe is open&mdash;there may still be a consider-
able quantity of mass hiding in stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, 
and black holes), interstellar gas and dust. We need to find another way to 
measure the amount of mass in a galaxy that includes these &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; con-
tributions.
</p>
<p>Conveniently, we can &ldquo;weigh&rdquo; galaxies using our knowledge of Newtonian 
mechanics, just like we were able to &ldquo;weigh&rdquo; the Sun in Chap. 2. If a mass, 
M, is orbited by an object at a radius r with velocity v, then by measuring 
the radius and velocity, it is possible to calculate the mass inside the orbit 
using
</p>
<p>Thus the Earth&rsquo;s orbital radius and velocity yield the Sun&rsquo;s mass.1 Similarly, 
the orbital radius and velocity of a star around the center of a galaxy, yields 
the mass of the galaxy (that is contained within the orbit).
</p>
<p>When astronomers plot the rotation speeds of planets (or stars) vs the 
distance from the center of the Solar System (or a galaxy), they obtain 
a &ldquo;rotation curve&rdquo;. The rotation curve for the Solar System is found to be 
precisely in accordance with the theoretical prediction: planets further out 
have slower orbital velocities (see Fig. 9.1). Rotation curves for many spi-
ral galaxies have also been measured (see Fig. 9.2). However, they defy pre-
dictions. As we move from the center, the rotation velocity grows, since the 
orbit includes more matter. The problem arises when we get to the visible 
edge of the galaxy. One might expect the rotation curves to start dropping 
off, as they do for the Solar System. But they do not. In many cases the rota-
tion velocity remains flat, or even increases, to distances well beyond the vis-
ible edge. This indicates that there must be a large amount of &ldquo;dark matter&rdquo;

</p>
<p>1In fact, because the planets themselves have so much less mass than the Sun, we can pick any planet, 
and use its distance and its orbital velocity to calculate the Sun&rsquo;s mass. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether we use 
Mercury or Neptune, or any planet in between, we always get the same answer for the Sun&rsquo;s mass.</p>

<p>beyond the visible distribution of stars. Detailed studies of rotation curves 
lead to the conclusion that luminous galaxies are embedded in vast dark 
matter halos, as illustrated in Fig. 9.3.
</p>
<p>But how can one measure the rotation speeds for &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; objects 
beyond the visible edge? It turns out that there are vast rotating disks of 
hydrogen gas that extend way beyond the stars in galactic disks. The gas 
emits radio waves, and by measuring the Doppler shift of the radiation, the

years) from the center. The actual data do not follow the prediction, indicat-
ing that unseen mass exists beyond the visible edge. Credit Eric Chaisson [from

</p>
<p>rotation curve can be extended. These measurements suggest that the dark 
matter halos are about 50 times more massive than the stars.
</p>
<p>Additional evidence in support of this dramatic conclusion comes from 
studying galaxy clusters.2 As we discussed in Chap. 4, light from a distant 
source can be gravitationally deflected by a concentration of mass that lies 
between the source and the observer. This can result in multiple images of 
the source, and in amplification and distortion of these images. If a galaxy 
cluster lies between us and some more distant galaxy, then the angular sepa-
ration between the images of the distant galaxy on the sky and the amount 
by which they are distorted allows scientists to estimate how much mass is 
contained in the intervening cluster. Using such gravitational lensing tech-
niques, clusters of galaxies have been weighed, and the results are consistent 
with those found from galactic rotation curves.
</p>
<p>Fritz Zwicky, the Swiss born astronomer who predicted the existence of 
dark matter way back in the 1930s, used a different method of weighing clus-
ters. He measured the speeds at which galaxies move in clusters and noticed 
that the speeds were so high that the galaxies would fly away, unless there was 
a large amount of unseen matter binding them to the cluster. No one took 
his idea seriously until four decades later, when Vera Rubin discovered, from 
the study of galactic rotation curves, that the universe harbors a large amount 
of dark matter, well in excess of the luminous matter in stars. Today, both 
Zwicky and Rubin are credited with the discovery of dark matter.

<p>9.1 The Average Mass Density of the Universe and Dark Matter     135
</p>
<p>Another line of evidence for dark matter in galaxy clusters comes from 
X-ray telescopes that have revealed that clusters have very hot, tenuous atmos-
pheres. These atmospheres are bound to their clusters by gravity, just like the 
Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is bound to the Earth. Measurements of their temperature 
and X-ray radiation intensity yield two important results: (a) the atmosphere 
itself is several times more massive than the stars in the cluster; and (b) dark 
matter dominates over normal matter (atmospheric gas plus  stellar mass) by a 
factor of about 5. Like the evidence for dark matter in galaxies, the evidence 
for dark matter in clusters is very strong (Figs. 9.4 and 9.5).
</p>
<p>So what is this dark matter? As we already mentioned, part of it could 
be in dark stellar remnants&mdash;white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. It 
could also include &ldquo;failed stars&rdquo;&mdash;low-mass objects not quite large enough to 
ignite nuclear reactions. But as we shall discuss in Chap. 12, none of these 
candidates can account for the observed amount of dark matter. We shall see 
that there are good reasons to believe that dark matter cannot be the usual 
atomic matter, but should instead consist of some exotic, as yet undiscovered 
particles. The particles need to be stable (so they can last for the lifetime of

clusters. Despite the legends about Zwicky&rsquo;s confrontational personality (he 
is rumored to have called some of his colleagues &ldquo;spherical bastards&rdquo;, because 
whichever way you look at them, they are still bastards!), accounts of his com-
passion and generosity include how he and his wife carried out a campaign to

able). Particle physicists have suggested a number of hypothetical candidates 
for dark matter particles, but for now we have to accept the fact that we do 
not know what most of the matter in the universe is made of.
</p>
<p>Current measurements of the different contributions to the average den-
sity of the universe yield �dm &asymp; 0.26 for dark matter and �at &asymp; 0.05 for the 
atomic matter (stars and gas). The total density parameter, including both 
dark and atomic matter contributions, is then �m = �dm + �at &asymp; 0.31. It 
is less than unity, suggesting that the universe has an open hyperbolic geom-
etry and will expand forever. This, however, is not the end of the story.
</p>
<p>9.2  Dark Energy
</p>
<p>We now turn to an even more mysterious ingredient of the universe, which 
was serendipitously discovered by two groups of astronomers in the late 
1990s. The two teams, one headed by Saul Perlmutter and the other by 
Brian Schmidt, set out to study the expansion history of the universe, using

that dark matter exists in galaxies, by studying galaxy rotation curves. In 1965 
Rubin was the first female to be allowed to use the instruments at Palomar 
Observatory. Motivated by her own gender based professional challenges, Rubin 
was a strong advocate for young girls and women to pursue their scientific 
careers. A mother of four children, (all of whom have Ph.D.&rsquo;s in the sciences), 
Rubin was also an observant Jew who saw no conflict between her religious 
views and her scientific endeavors. Credit  AIP Emilio Segre Visual Archives,

<p>supernovae as standard candles. The astronomers compared the redshifts of 
remote galaxies to their distances, much like Hubble did, but for galaxies 
much further away. Redshifts were measured directly from the shift of spec-
tral lines; and distances were determined by measuring the apparent bright-
ness of Type 1a supernovae.
</p>
<p>The redshift tells us how fast the galaxy was moving at the time when the 
light was emitted. The present velocity of the galaxy can be found from its dis-
tance. The expectation was that galactic velocities at earlier cosmic times were 
greater than they are today&mdash;simply because the expansion of the universe is 
slowed down by gravity. It therefore came as a huge surprise in 1998 when 
both teams discovered that galaxies are now moving faster than they did before.
</p>
<p>The results of the measurements are shown in Fig. 9.6. The purple line 
corresponds to a universe without gravity, where galaxies are receding at con-
stant speeds. In a decelerating universe the data points should be above this 
line, while in fact they are predominantly below the line. Thus the expansion 
of the universe is accelerating! (Figs. 9.6 and 9.7).
</p>
<p>The redshift-distance measurements can be used to find the scale factor 
as a function of cosmic time, directly revealing the expansion history of the 
universe. The data indicate that the expansion was decelerating in the past, 
but in more recent times the expansion of the universe started accelerating. 
The turning point was roughly five billion years ago (around the time our 
Solar System was formed).
</p>
<p>What could possibly cause the observed accelerated expansion? And what 
could explain the transition from deceleration to acceleration? It is as though 
attractive gravity suddenly flipped to become repulsive.
</p>
<p>We have already encountered one instance where gravity can be repul-
sive: remember the vacuum energy density, or the cosmological constant? 
Let&rsquo;s suppose the vacuum has a nonzero mass density ρv. This will produce a 
repulsive force. If ρv is sufficiently large, this force will overcome the attrac-
tive gravity of matter. The result will be an accelerated expansion of the uni-
verse.
</p>
<p>The vacuum density ρv remains constant in time, while the density of 
matter ρm changes with the expansion of the universe. The volume of any 
given region grows like the cube of the scale factor,

<p>9.2 Dark Energy     139
</p>
<p>So at early times, when the scale factor is very small, ρm must be much 
greater than ρv. Thus the attractive gravity of matter overwhelms the repul-
sive gravity of the vacuum. But, as the universe expands, the matter density 
is diluted, and eventually it drops below the vacuum density. At that point 
the cosmic acceleration begins. [More precisely, acceleration begins when 
ρv &gt; ρm/2; see Chap. 5, Eq. (5.3)].
</p>
<p>If ρv is indeed the reason for the accelerated expansion, we need to deter-
mine how large it is. The best fit to the data is obtained for ρv &asymp; 2.2 ρm0, 
where ρm0 is the present matter density.3 The corresponding vacuum density 
parameter is
</p>
<p>The vacuum energy, which is often called &ldquo;dark energy&rdquo;, is thus the domi-
nant component of the universe (see Fig. 9.8). An intriguing consequence 
of Eq. (9.4) is that the total density parameter is very close to unity: 
�tot = �vac + �m &asymp; 1. It seems as though the universe is perched on the 
borderline between being open and closed&mdash;it is flat, or at least very nearly 
flat.4
</p>
<p>(9.4)�vac = ρv/ρc &asymp; 0.69
</p>
<p>3Note that ρm0 includes both dark and atomic matter.
4Several other independent measurements also indicate that the universe is flat, further adding confi-
dence to the notion that the universe is filled with dark energy. We will address these findings in later 
chapters.

</p>
<p>9.3  The Fate of the Universe&mdash;Again
</p>
<p>Dark energy also has important implications for the future of the universe. 
The Friedmann relation between the density parameter and the fate of the 
universe that we discussed in Chap. 8 only holds when there is no vacuum 
energy. (We emphasize that the relation between � and the geometry of the 
universe is always valid). Once the universe is dominated by vacuum energy 
(as it is today), it will keep expanding forever, due to repulsive gravity, 
regardless of the value of �. The universe will double in size about every 10 
billion years. The velocities of the galaxies will also double on the same time 
scale.
</p>
<p>This kind of expansion is called exponential. As the recession speeds of 
galaxies exceed the speed of light, they will leave our observable region, 
never to be seen again. The universe will thus get emptier and emptier, 
until (in a few trillion years), no stars outside our local galaxy cluster will 
be visible at all. As for the stars themselves, eventually they will exhaust 
their nuclear supplies, and their embers will fade into the frigid blackness of 
space. We should rejoice that we live at the current cosmic epoch, under a 
bejeweled sky brimming with clues about our cosmic origins.
</p>
<p>We need to take a moment to reflect on a very curious feature of our uni-
verse. The vacuum energy density was much smaller than that of matter in 
the early universe, and it will get much greater than the matter density in 
the future. We happen to live at a very special epoch when these two densi-
ties are comparable: ρvac &asymp; 2ρm0. Do you think this is simply a coincidence?
</p>
<p>Summary
The mass density in luminous stars amounts to a small fraction of the critical 
density. By studying the rotation curves of galaxies, as well as gravitational 
lensing and galaxy velocities in clusters of galaxies, we find that, by mass, 
there is roughly 5 times more dark matter, than all the matter in stars and 
gas. We don&rsquo;t know what the dark matter is made of, but we now know it is 
not composed of protons, neutrons and electrons, like ordinary matter.
</p>
<p>Even with dark matter included, the total matter density is still less than 
the critical value. But recent observations of supernova explosions have 
revealed that apart from dark matter, the universe contains yet another mys-
terious dark component. Observations indicate that the expansion of the 
universe is now accelerating with time. The most likely cause of this acceler-
ation is the existence of a space-filling vacuum energy, called &ldquo;dark energy&rdquo;, 
which has a repulsive gravitational effect. The discovery of dark energy </p>

<p>Modern physics began with two revolutions at the turn of the 20th cen-
tury. The first revolution, which radically changed our concepts of space and 
time, was single handedly accomplished by Einstein with his special and 
general theories of relativity. The development of quantum mechanics by 
a number of physicists ushered in the second revolution, which shook the 
foundations of physics even more than the first. Quantum mechanics was 
developed as a theory of the microworld but as we shall see, quantum effects 
are essential in the early universe and even play a role on the largest cosmic 
scales.
</p>
<p>10.1  Quantum Discreteness
</p>
<p>According to quantum mechanics, at the microscopic level electromagnetic 
waves consist of photons&mdash;small bundles (or quanta) of electromagnetic 
energy. Photons always travel at the speed of light and have zero rest mass. 
The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength �, and is 
given by

<p>such a tiny number, a photon typically carries a tiny amount of energy. The clas-
sical wave description of light is accurate when we have a large number of pho-
tons; for example, a 100 W light bulb produces about 1019 photons per second.
</p>
<p>Quantum discreteness is also manifested in atomic structure. The early 
20th century &ldquo;planetary&rdquo; model of the atom consisted of negatively charged 
electrons orbiting around a positively charged nucleus, much like the planets 
orbit the Sun. However, Maxwell&rsquo;s theory of electromagnetism predicts that 
charged particles moving along curved trajectories will radiate electromag-
netic waves. Thus physicists were puzzled by how the electrons could main-
tain their stable orbits, and avoid continuously radiating away energy that 
would cause them to spiral into the nucleus (Fig. 10.1).
</p>
<p>In quantum theory, atomic electrons are allowed to occupy only a discrete 
set of orbits, with each orbit having a specific energy. An electron can emit 
a photon and jump to a lower orbit, as shown schematically in Fig. 10.2.1 
This process must conserve energy, so the energy of the photon must be 
equal to the energy difference between the two orbits. The inverse process 
is also possible&mdash;an electron can absorb a photon and jump to a higher-
energy orbit. Thus atoms can emit and absorb photons of only specific ener-
gies (and wavelengths). The existence of discrete energy levels is essential for 
spectroscopic measurements, which provide much of the information that 
we have about the universe.
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.1 Classical mechanics and electromagnetism predict that orbiting electrons 
will radiate electromagnetic waves, lose energy and spiral in toward the nucleus

</p>
<p>10.2  Quantum Indeterminism
</p>
<p>The quantum world is fundamentally unpredictable. We can never know for 
certain where a given particle will be or how fast it will move; the best we 
can do is to predict probabilities for possible future positions and velocities. 
This is in contrast to classical, Newtonian physics, where the entire future 
history of a particle can be predicted from its position and velocity at some 
initial moment (Fig. 10.3).
</p>
<p>At the core of quantum physics is the uncertainty principle, discovered 
by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. It states that the position and velocity of a 
particle cannot be simultaneously determined. The more precisely we meas-
ure the position, the greater is the uncertainty in the velocity, and vice versa. 
This is encoded in the equation,
</p>
<p>where �x and �v are respectively the uncertainties in the particle&rsquo;s position and 
velocity, and m is the particle&rsquo;s mass (this equation applies only to non-relativ-
istc particles). If we make �x very small, then �v will get large&mdash;in a sense, the 
more we try to localize the particle, the more it tries to &ldquo;escape&rdquo;. A quantum 
particle is thus inherently fuzzy and cannot be assigned a definite trajectory.
</p>
<p>Macroscopic objects, like planets or billiard balls, follow their classical tra-
jectories with very high probability, which is why the motion of planets can

the lowest energy level of the atom. Here, a photon is emitted when an electron 
jumps from the n = 3 level to the n = 2 level. The energy of the photon is equal 
to the energy difference between the levels, so the total energy is conserved</p>

<p>be predicted for many centuries to come. But for small particles, like elec-
trons, deviations from classical motion can be very large. Such unpredictable 
deviations are called quantum fluctuations.
</p>
<p>One of the most striking examples of quantum fluctuations is illustrated 
in Fig. 10.4. A ball lies at a low point in a one-dimensional landscape, sepa-
rated by a hill from a still lower valley. In the world of classical physics, the 
ball would stay where it is, unless someone kicks it, providing the energy 
necessary to get over the hill. But in the quantum world, there is a non-zero 
probability that the ball will suddenly and discontinuously emerge on the 
other side of the hill and start rolling down. This process is called &ldquo;quantum 
tunneling&rdquo;. The larger the energy barrier (or height and/or width of the hill) 
that needs to be surmounted, the smaller is the tunneling probability.
</p>
<p>While tunneling might sound like an exotic quantum effect, it has many 
real world consequences and applications. It explains, for example, the phe-
nomenon of alpha radioactivity, where an alpha particle (consisting of two

<p>protons and two neutrons) is emitted from inside a nucleus, despite the 
energy barrier produced by attractive nuclear forces. Also, the scanning 
tunneling electron microscope can be used to see individual atoms on the 
surface of a material. When a sharp conducting probe is scanned above a 
surface, the distance between the probe and the surface will vary slightly, 
depending on the arrangement of the surface atoms. When the surface 
atoms are closer to the probe it will be easier for electrons to tunnel from the 
surface to the probe, which then registers a current. Thus, by measuring the 
rate at which electrons tunnel from the surface to the probe, one can image 
the individual bumps and depressions of atoms on the surface (Fig. 10.5).

</p>
<p>10.3  The Wave Function
</p>
<p>In quantum theory, a particle is mathematically described by a wave func-
tion ψ(x, t), which is a function of position x and time t. It contains all the 
information we can have about the particle. The shape and time evolution 
of the wave functions are determined by the so-called Schrodinger equation, 
derived by Erwin Schrodinger in 1927. The wave function does not tell us 
where the particle is located; it only determines the probability to find it in 
one location or another.2 Suppose at some moment of time an electron is 
described by the wave function shown in Fig. 10.6. If we measure the posi-
tion of the electron, we are most likely to find it near position a, where ψ 
has the largest magnitude. The second most likely possibility is to find it 
near position b, and there is some non-zero probability that it is at any other 
location where the wave function is not zero.
</p>
<p>If we perform many identical measurements, their outcomes will be dis-
tributed according to the probabilities predicted by the wave function.
</p>
<p>Prior to a measurement, an electron described by the wave function in 
Fig. 10.6 does not have any definite position. We say it is in a superposition 
of states corresponding to different positions. Once we perform a measure-
ment, we know where the electron is at that moment, so the wave function 
&ldquo;collapses&rdquo; to a peaked shape around that point, as in Fig. 10.7. The elec-
tron will not generally stay localized, and the peak of the wave function will 
immediately start to spread. Once again, its time evolution can be found by 
solving the Schrodinger equation, and the resulting wave function can be 
used to determine the probabilities of future measurements.
</p>
<p>If we prepare a large number of electrons in the same quantum state 
(described by the same wave function) and perform identical experiments

<p>10.3 The Wave Function     149
</p>
<p>measuring the positions of the electrons, the data points will provide an 
image of the probability distribution, as shown in Fig. 10.8.
</p>
<p>The wave function description is not limited to the positions of particles; 
it can be applied to any quantum system. As another example, consider a 
radioactive atom, whose nucleus can decay by emitting an alpha particle. 
Radioactive decay is a fundamentally random process, so you cannot predict 
the time of decay. You can only determine the decay probability per unit 
time (say, per hour). Suppose you checked that the atom is intact at some 
initial moment and placed it in a sealed box, so you cannot observe it. Then, 
at a later time, the wave function of the atom will be a superposition of 
decayed and un-decayed states. Just like the electron in the previous example

<p>did not have any definite position, the atom has no definite state of decay. 
You can open the box and inspect the atom; then the wave function will col-
lapse to either a decayed or un-decayed state, with probabilities that you can 
calculate. It appears that the atom &ldquo;makes up its mind&rdquo; at the last moment, 
when the measurement is performed.
</p>
<p>To highlight just how bizarre this is, Erwin Schrodinger proposed the fol-
lowing thought experiment. Imagine there is a cat in a perfectly sealed box 
containing a radioactive atom and a Geiger counter. There is also a flask of 
cyanide poison in the box. If the radioactive atom decays, the Geiger coun-
ter detects a signal that triggers a hammer to smash open the poison, instan-
taneously killing the cat. We should now describe the entire content of the 
box by a wave function, and it will be a superposition of two states&mdash;an 
intact atom plus a living cat and a decayed atom plus a dead cat. The cat 
is thus in a superposition of &ldquo;dead&rdquo; and &ldquo;alive&rdquo; states! If we were to open 
the box and look inside, the cat would suddenly become either &ldquo;alive&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;dead&rdquo;&mdash;its wave function would &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; (Fig. 10.9).
</p>
<p>If you are scratching your head, rest assured you are not alone. The proba-
bilistic interpretation of the wave function that we outlined above was devel-
oped by Max Born and by Niels Bohr and his colleagues at his institute in 
Copenhagen; it is called the Copenhagen interpretation. But some of the 
founders of quantum mechanics never accepted quantum indeterminism. 
Most notable amongst them was Einstein who quipped: &ldquo;God does not play 
dice with the universe&rdquo;.

<p>10.4 Many Worlds Interpretation     151
</p>
<p>10.4  Many Worlds Interpretation
</p>
<p>In 1957 a Princeton graduate student, Hugh Everett, proposed an alterna-
tive interpretation of quantum mechanics which postulates that the wave 
function never collapses. Instead, all possible outcomes of any measurement 
do occur, but they occur in &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; universes, which have no contact with 
one another.
</p>
<p>With every measurement of a particle&rsquo;s position, the universe branches into 
multiple copies of itself, where the particle is found to be in all possible places.
</p>
<p>The branching process is described by the Schrodinger equation and is 
fully deterministic. But we cannot predict which of the parallel universes 
we will find ourselves in, and thus the outcomes of our measurements can 
still be determined only probabilistically. Everett showed that the probabili-
ties come out exactly the same as when one uses the Copenhagen interpre-
tation. Everett&rsquo;s approach is now called &ldquo;the many worlds interpretation&rdquo; 
(Fig. 10.10).
</p>

despite this uncertainty about its philosophical foundations, quantum 
mechanics is a tremendously successful theory which has been crucial for

<p>152     10 The Quantum World
</p>
<p>our understanding of atomic structure, chemistry, biochemistry, particle 
physics and so on. All of its predictions have been borne out by experiments 
with incredible precision. It is also the theoretical framework that underpins 
the technology of transistors, atomic clocks, lasers, superconductivity, etc.
</p>
<p>Since the choice of interpretation does not affect any predictions of 
the theory, most physicists simply disregard the philosophical problems 
and follow the dictum &ldquo;Shut up and calculate!&rdquo; This attitude works fine, 
except in cosmology, where one might want to apply quantum theory to 
the entire universe. The Copenhagen interpretation, which requires an 
external observer to perform measurements on the system, cannot even 
be formulated in this case: there are no observers external to the universe. 
Cosmologists, therefore, tend to favor the many worlds interpretation.
</p>
<p>Summary
The physics of the microworld is governed by the inherently discrete quan-
tum mechanics. In particular, the classical picture of electromagnetic waves 
gives way to a quantum description in which light consists of photons that 
carry discrete amounts of energy. Atomic electrons also have quantized ener-
gies that can increase or decrease only by discrete amounts via the absorp-
tion or emission of photons. This gives rise to the spectroscopic absorption 
and emission lines.
</p>
<p>In contrast to the classical, deterministic universe, the quantum world is 
fundamentally unpredictable. Even if we have complete information about a 
quantum system, we can only make probabilistic predictions about its future 
evolution. Macroscopic bodies, like cars or tennis balls, behave nearly clas-
sically, but in the microworld, unpredictable deviations from the classical 
motion, called quantum fluctuations, are typically large.
</p>
<p>In quantum physics a particle is described by a wave function, which 
determines the probability for the particle to be in various locations. 
According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, once 
we perform a measurement, the wave function &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; and the particle 
then momentarily has the measured position. An alternative interpretation 
of quantum mechanics, called &ldquo;the many worlds interpretation&rdquo;, asserts 
that all possible outcomes of the measurement occur in disconnected &ldquo;par-
allel&rdquo; universes. We cannot determine which universe we are in, thus the 
future events we expect to observe can only be predicted probabilistically. 
Regardless of how we interpret quantum mechanics, its predictions remain 
the same.</p>

</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p> 1. Einstein was one of the founders of quantum mechanics. Yet he still felt 
uneasy about the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. Do you 
find the probabilistic world of quantum mechanics more or less appealing 
than the deterministic classical universe?
</p>
<p> 2. Epicurus asserted that atoms move deterministically, but occasionally 
experience random &ldquo;swerves&rdquo;. He thought the swerves were necessary to 
explain the existence of free will. Quantum mechanics appears to provide 
something very similar to the swerves. Do you think this helps to explain 
free will?
</p>
<p> 3. Can you think of examples where it is better to think of light as a wave, 
and light as a particle?
</p>
<p> 4. Can you explain why atoms have specific absorption and emission spec-
tral lines?
</p>
<p> 5. Do you think that with improved technology we will be able to over-
come Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainty principle, and measure the exact position 
and velocity of an electron?
</p>
<p> 6. Could a stationary grape in a glass bowl spontaneously appear outside 
the bowl? Compare the classical and quantum mechanical &ldquo;answers&rdquo;.
</p>
<p> 7. What is a quantum fluctuation?
 8. What do physicists mean when they talk about the &ldquo;collapse of the wave 
</p>
<p>function&rdquo;?
 9. Discuss and compare the Copenhagen and many-worlds interpretations 
</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics. Which one do you prefer?
 10. Do you think the many worlds interpretation can ever be disproved?</p>

<p>In an expanding universe, matter is diluted as the volume of the universe 
gets larger. Conversely, if we follow the expansion backwards in time, we 
find that the universe was denser in its past than it is today. In fact, the 
density of the universe grows without bound as we wind the clock back to 
the big bang. Furthermore, the temperature of the universe also soars to 
extremely high values. How do we know this? And what does this imply 
about the conditions of the early universe?
</p>
<p>11.1  Following the Expansion Backwards 
in Time
</p>
<p>The idea of a hot big bang was conceived by the Russian-born physicist 
George Gamow in the late 1940&rsquo;s (Fig. 11.1). It was based on the simple 
observation that gases cool down when they expand and conversely heat 
up when compressed. The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average 
kinetic energy of its constituent particles. The faster the particles move, the 
higher the temperature. So let us consider the energetics of particles bounc-
ing off the walls in a box (see Fig. 11.2). When the wall is stationary, any 
given particle will bounce off at the same speed as it hits the wall. There will 
be no loss of kinetic energy. However, if the wall is retracting away from the 
particle, then the particle will rebound at a lower speed. Thus, in an expand-
ing box, every time a particle collides with a retracting wall, it will lose kinetic 
energy. This loss of energy manifests itself as a decrease in temperature.

</p>
<p>The same cooling effect occurs in an expanding universe, even in the 
absence of walls. To understand this, let us consider how velocities of gas 
particles change as they travel through the universe. Suppose a particle 
flies by galaxy A at velocity v and moves on towards some distant galaxy B. 
Galaxy B is itself moving away from A at velocity u, determined by Hubble&rsquo;s 
</p>

physics include being the first to understand radioactivity in terms of quantum 
mechanics and laying the groundwork for the hot big bang cosmology. He was 
a great popularizer of science and was known for his risque sense of humor. In 
1933 he defected from the Soviet Union, and he moved to the United States in 
1934. Credit  AIP Emilio Segr&egrave; Visual Archives, George Gamow Collection</p>

<p>law. So when the particle catches up with galaxy B, the observers in B will 
see it moving at a reduced speed, v &minus; u. Galaxy C, which is at a greater dis-
tance from A, is moving away at a greater speed, so when the particle even-
tually catches up with C, its observed speed will be further reduced. This 
applies to all particles and all observers in an expanding universe. As time 
goes on, observers will see the particles moving slower and slower&mdash;which 
means that any gas filling the universe will be cooling down.
</p>
<p>Conversely, if we follow the universe backwards in time, it will get hot-
ter and hotter. As we will see later, the temperature in the early universe is 
inversely proportional to the scale factor, T &prop; 1/a. Thus the universe appar-
ently becomes infinitely hot as the scale factor approaches zero at the big 
bang. What happens to the matter content of the universe under these 
extreme conditions?
</p>
<p>Everything around us consists of molecules that are composed of different 
types of atoms, held together by chemical bonds. Each atom is made up of 
electrons swirling around nuclei, which in turn consist of protons and neu-
trons. None of these components of matter could have existed at the early 
moments of the nascent universe. They would have been destroyed as ener-
getic particles smashed into one another at super-high temperatures.
</p>
<p>The chemical bonds that hold atoms together in molecules break at about 
500 K1; atoms break up into nuclei and electrons at roughly 3000 K; and 
nuclei split into protons and neutrons at approximately 108 K. At still higher 
temperatures, above 1012 K, neutrons and protons (collectively known as 
nucleons) break up into their elementary constituents, called quarks. All

<p>complex structures disintegrate as temperature increases. Consequently, the 
physical state of matter in the early universe was much simpler than it is 
today. It was just a hot and dense mixture of subatomic particles, which is 
often called &ldquo;the primeval fireball&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>As we refine our understanding of the fireball, we shall discover that, in 
addition to the particles that make up atoms, it included other particle spe-
cies, such as the weakly interacting neutrinos. But most importantly, the 
fireball was pervaded by intense electromagnetic radiation, as we shall now 
discuss.
</p>
<p>11.2  Thermal Radiation
</p>
<p>Let us first recall that at the microscopic level electromagnetic waves con-
sist of photons. Important things to remember about photons are that their 
energy is inversely proportional to their wavelength,
</p>
<p>and that they can be emitted and absorbed by electrically charged particles. 
Figure 11.3a illustrates a collision of two particles, which is accompanied 
by the emission of two photons. In Fig. 11.3b a charged particle absorbs a 
photon and then emits another one. In the super-dense early universe, these 
emission and absorption processes occur at a fierce rate, and equilibrium is 
quickly established where photons are mixed with other particles and are 
emitted at the same rate as they are absorbed. From the macroscopic point 
of view, this gas of photons can be pictured as electromagnetic radiation 
consisting of waves with different wavelengths.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.2 Thermal Radiation     159
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation that is in equilibrium with matter at some tem-
perature is called thermal radiation. The higher the temperature, the higher 
the intensity (or the energy density) of the radiation. Quantitatively, the 
total intensity is proportional to the 4th power of the temperature,
</p>
<p>This intensity is spread over a range of wavelengths, with a distribution (or 
spectrum) that depends only on the temperature; it is shown in Fig. 11.4 for 
several different temperatures, and is called a thermal spectrum. The form 
of this distribution was derived by the German physicist Max Planck at the 
turn of the 20th century (Fig. 11.5).
</p>
<p>The peak intensity occurs at a wavelength inversely proportional to the 
temperature,
</p>
<p>Most of the photons in thermal radiation have wavelengths around �peak, 
and it follows from Eq. (11.1) that the typical energy of photons grows in

<p>160     11 The Hot Big Bang
</p>
<p>Any macroscopic object at a non-zero temperature emits radiation with an 
approximately thermal spectrum. The details of the spectrum depend on 
the material of the object&mdash;specifically on how it absorbs and reflects elec-
tromagnetic waves. The spectrum is exactly thermal only for an ideal black 
body, which absorbs all incident radiation.2 The thermal spectrum is there-
fore sometimes called the black body spectrum.
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.5 Max Planck derived a formula for the spectrum of thermal radiation in 
1901, laying the foundation for quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>2This is not difficult to understand from the following thought experiment. Consider a black body in 
equilibrium with thermal radiation at some temperature T. The black body absorbs all incident radia-
tion, and in order to maintain equilibrium, it has to emit radiation at the same rate and with the same 
spectrum.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.2 Thermal Radiation     161
</p>
<p>An ideal black body at zero temperature would look black even if you 
were to shine light on it. The reason is that it does not reflect any incident 
light. But at non-zero temperatures &ldquo;black bodies&rdquo; are not really black, since 
they glow with thermal radiation. Stars are good examples of almost ideal 
black bodies. The surface temperature of the Sun is 6000 K, and the cor-
responding peak wavelength is right in the middle of the visible spectrum.3 
From Eqs. (11.2) and (11.3) we can tell that a star with a surface twice as 
hot as the Sun would have a total intensity that is 16 times higher, and a 
peak wavelength that is half as much. At human body temperature (about 
300 K), the peak of thermal radiation is in the infrared range, so humans 
and animals all glow in the infrared. At the extreme temperatures of the pri-
meval fireball, shortly after the big bang, the photon energies were much 
higher and their wavelengths much shorter than those of visible light.
</p>
<p>11.3  The Hot Big Bang Model
</p>
<p>The starting point of the hot big bang model is an expanding fireball of ele-
mentary particles and photons. Assuming that the universe was homogene-
ous and isotropic, the fireball uniformly filled the entire space. One of the 
main goals of cosmology is to explain how the universe evolved from this 
simple state to what it is today.
</p>
<p>As the universe expands, the fireball dilutes and cools down, and complex 
structures begin to form. When the universe is roughly a minute old, the 
temperature T  drops to 109 K, and protons and neutrons start to combine 
to form atomic nuclei. This is called nucleosynthesis, and will be discussed in 
Chap. 13. By the time the universe is about 380,000 years old, the tempera-
ture cools to T = 3000 K, and electrons combine with nuclei to form neu-
tral atoms. This process is called &ldquo;recombination&rdquo;. Eventually stars, galaxies, 
and galaxy clusters are pulled together by gravity.
</p>
<p>Today we find ourselves having front row seats from which to view this 
history: as we look further out into the universe, we also look back in time. If we 
look at a supernova 10 billion light years away, we see it as it was 7.5 billion 
years ago (see Sect. 7.7). If we look far enough, we will see the universe as it 
was when galaxies and the first stars were being formed. What if we look still 
</p>
<p>3Solar radiation has comparable intensity at all wavelengths in the visible spectrum. This should be 
perceived as white light, and indeed the Sun looks white when viewed from outer space. However, to 
observers on Earth, the Sun often looks yellow. This is mostly because the blue part of the spectrum 
is scattered by the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p>

<p>162     11 The Hot Big Bang
</p>
<p>further, beyond galaxies, as far as our telescopes can reach? We will see the 
primordial fireball. It is there, in all directions on the sky.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot see all the way back to the big bang. At very early 
times the Universe was opaque because photons were frequently scattered 
by charged electrons and nuclei. However, this changed at recombination, 
when neutral atoms were formed and the universe became transparent to 
radiation. Photons interact with atoms much more weakly than they do with 
charged particles, so they are essentially free to propagate through the uni-
verse directly from the fireball, and eventually to our detectors4. We say that 
the photons decouple from matter. Thus when we look back as far as pos-
sible, to the epoch of recombination, we should see a panoramic &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; 
of the universe as it was when its temperature was 3000 K. (This image of 
the infant universe is sometimes called the &ldquo;surface of last scattering&rdquo;, because 
the photons that make up the image arrive at our detectors after traveling on 
a straight path through space since the last time they were scattered during 
recombination). The peak wavelength of radiation at this temperature is near 
the red end of the visible spectrum, so a 3000 K fireball should glow with 
intense red light. Then why isn&rsquo;t the sky red?
</p>
<p>The reason is cosmological redshift. As photons propagate to us from the 
fireball, their wavelength is stretched by the expansion of the universe and is 
shifted far out of the visible range. At the same time, the density of photons 
is diluted by the expansion, so the radiation arrives at us highly red-shifted 
and with a strongly diminished intensity. If indeed the early universe was 
homogeneous and isotropic, the intensity of this relic radiation should be 
nearly the same in all directions on the sky.
</p>
<p>11.4  Discovering the Primeval Fireball
</p>
<p>Relic radiation from the primeval fireball was first predicted in the 1940&rsquo;s by 
George Gamow&rsquo;s two young colleagues, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman. 
They estimated the present temperature of the radiation to be about 5 K. 
Detecting radiation of such a low temperature was a challenging task, and 
most observers at the time felt that it could not be done. So the prediction 
passed almost unnoticed (Fig. 11.6).
</p>
<p>4This process is similar to how photons make their way from inside the Sun to the Earth. Photons that 
are inside the Sun (or any other star) are constantly scattered in random directions, and it can take mil-
lions of years for them to make their way to the surface of the Sun. Once they get there, they are no 
longer jostled about, and stream freely towards us, arriving within a mere 8 min.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4 Discovering the Primeval Fireball     163
</p>
<p>More than a decade later, Robert Dicke at Princeton reinvented the idea 
of a hot primeval fireball and realized that it leads to the prediction of a per-
vasive cosmic radiation. Dicke assembled a group of three young physicists, 
assigning one of them, Jim Peebles, to work out the details of the theory 
and the other two, Peter Roll and David Wilkinson, to build a detector that 
would put the theory to test. Peebles was not aware of the work of Gamow&rsquo;s 
group, so he had to start from scratch. He completed the calculation in 
early 1965, predicting radiation with a thermal black body spectrum at a 
temperature of about 10 K. At that time the detector setup was also nearly 
complete, so the Princeton group was poised to either discover the primeval 
fireball or to prove that it never existed.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey, less than 
50 km away from Princeton, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were testing 
a sensitive radio antenna that they hoped to use in a study of radio emis-
sion from the Milky Way. They first needed to account for possible sources 
of noise, such as radio emission from the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and electronic 
noise in their antenna. But after half a year of work there still remained a 
persistent radio noise of unexplained origin. Penzias and Wilson measured

radiation from a hot early epoch should pervade our universe. The word &ldquo;Ylem&rdquo; 
on the label of the bottle is the term invented by Gamow (depicted here as a 
genie coming out of a bottle) and his friends for the primeval fireball</p>

<p>the characteristic temperature of the noise to be about 3 K, corresponding 
to microwaves with a wavelength of 2 mm. The noise did not depend on 
the time of day or the direction in the sky, ruling out the atmosphere as a 
source. They also ruled out electronic noise and, believe it or not, pigeon 
droppings on the antenna! (Fig. 11.7).

<p>11.4 Discovering the Primeval Fireball     165
</p>
<p>Dicke and his group at Princeton were ready to start their measurements 
when they learned about Penzias and Wilson&rsquo;s predicament. They knew 
immediately that the mysterious noise whose origin puzzled Penzias and 
Wilson was precisely the signal of relic radiation that they were hoping to 
detect. The two teams published back-to-back papers in the same journal. 
Penzias and Wilson described their experiment, and the Princeton group 
interpreted it as a measurement of the cosmic radiation left over from the 
big bang.5 Today this radiation is called the cosmic microwave background 
(or CMB).
</p>
<p>And what about Gamow&rsquo;s group? By the time of the CMB discovery 
none of them was actively working in cosmology. In the mid-1950s Gamow 
became interested in biology, where he contributed important insights into 
the genetic code, while Alpher and Herman moved on to careers in industry. 
Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978. No prize has 
ever been awarded for the prediction of the CMB.
</p>
<p>Penzias and Wilson measured the intensity of the CMB at only one wave-
length. To determine if this radiation was indeed part of a thermal spectrum, 
cosmologists still had to measure the radiation intensity over an extended 
range of wavelengths. This problem was tackled in a number of experi-
ments in subsequent years, culminating in 1990 with the launch of NASAs 
Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. COBE measured the spec-
trum of the CMB with unprecedented precision and found a perfect ther-
mal spectrum (as predicted by the theory) with T = 2.725 K (Fig. 11.8). 
Furthermore, the radiation intensity measured by COBE was nearly the 
same in all directions, with variations of less than 1/1000. Thus the early 
universe was indeed very isotropic and homogeneous.
</p>
<p>11.5  Images of the Baby Universe
</p>
<p>What do we actually see in the CMB? This depends on how accurately 
we measure the radiation temperature. If the accuracy is less than one 
part in 1000, then all we can see is a uniform radiation background, as in 
Fig. 11.9a. Here, the sky is represented with the so-called Mollweide projec-
tion, which is often used to represent the surface of the globe on a flat map. 
</p>
<p>5The observed value of the CMB temperature (3 K) is close to the theoretical prediction (5&ndash;10 K). The 
discrepancy between the two was mostly due to the uncertainty in the average matter density that was 
used in the calculations.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>166     11 The Hot Big Bang
</p>
<p>At a somewhat higher accuracy, a &ldquo;yin-yang&rdquo; pattern emerges, as shown in 
Fig. 11.9b. Red coloring corresponds to higher and blue to lower than aver-
age temperature. This so-called dipole pattern is due to the motion of our 
Milky Way galaxy relative to the CMB. The highest temperature is observed 
in the direction of our motion, and the lowest temperature in the opposite 
direction. This is just the Doppler effect: as we move towards the incoming 
radiation, its wavelength shrinks and the temperature increases. The velocity 
of our motion through the CMB is about 600 km/s; it can be attributed to

tern due to our motion relative to the CMB. In the direction we are heading, 
the CMB photons are slightly blueshifted (so their temperature is higher; hence 
this part of the sky is marked red in the figure, and in the opposite direction 
they are redshifted [so the corresponding part of the sky is blue (This choice of 
color coding can be confusing. Here the convention of everyday life, where red 
means &ldquo;hot&rdquo; and blue means &ldquo;cold&rdquo;, like on faucets, is followed. Unfortunately 
this convention is opposite to the fact that blueshifted light is hotter and bluer)]. 
c The red band comes form microwave emission in our galaxy. The other patches 
indicate tiny temperature fluctuations of the CMB, due to the presence of small 
density fluctuations at the time the CMB photons were emitted</p>

of the Virgo supercluster (Fig. 11.10).
</p>
<p>The dipole component can easily be subtracted from the CMB temper-
ature map. This reveals a pattern of higher and lower temperature regions 
shown in Fig. 11.9c. The red &ldquo;equatorial&rdquo; band comes from the microwave 
emission of our galaxy. In the rest of the map, the typical temperature varia-
tion between red and blue regions is only about one part in 100,000. These 
tiny variations reflect fluctuations in density. Higher density regions will 
later evolve into galaxies and galaxy clusters, as we will discuss in Chap. 12.
</p>
<p>The temperature map in Fig. 11.9c was produced by the COBE satellite in 
1992, after two years of taking data. It showed for the first time that the early 
universe did have small density fluctuations. However the resolution of COBE 
was rather limited, and much more work remained to be done to mine the vast

size of the full moon is 0.5&deg;), WMAP had a resolution that is 33 times higher, 
and was 45 times more sensitive. WMAP operated successfully for 9 years, 
returning precision data that led to accurate determinations of the age, com-
position, and geometry of the universe. WMAP was succeeded by the Planck 
satellite, which had triple the resolution and was 10 times more sensitive. As 
the resolution improved, the image of the baby universe has become more 
and more focused (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.12). This image contains important 
information about physical phenomena that took place way before the epoch 
of recombination. We will have more to say about this later.

<p>We can compare nγ to the average number density of nucleons:

<p>which means that there are more than a billion photons present for every

<p>Even though microwave photons are much more numerous than nucle-
ons, the energy (and equivalent mass) of each photon is very small com-
pared to that of a nucleon. As a result, the mass density of the CMB is much 
smaller than the density of matter today
</p>
<p>We now consider how the cosmic radiation evolves with time. As the uni-
verse expands, the wavelength of CMB photons grows in proportion to the 
scale factor, � &prop; a, and their energy decreases as E &prop; 1/a. Since the wave-
lengths of all photons are stretched by the same factor a(t), the thermal form 
of the radiation spectrum is preserved. The radiation temperature T  is pro-
portional to the average energy of photons; hence

<p>Here, T0 &asymp; 3 K is the present CMB temperature and we use the conven-
tion that the scale factor is a0 = 1 at the present time. This useful formula 
allows us to determine how much the universe has expanded since the time 
when it had temperature T . For example, the temperature at recombination 
is Trec &asymp; 3000 K, and we find from Eq. (11.8) that the scale factor at that 
time was arec &asymp; 10

. This means that the universe has expanded by a fac-
</p>
<p>tor of 1000 since the time of recombination. The corresponding redshift is 
zrec &asymp; 1000.

<p>The cosmic time trec at recombination can be found by solving the

<p>The CMB thus provides an image of the universe at 380,000 years after its 
birth&mdash;a very early time, compared to the present cosmic age of about 14 bil-

<p>In the course of cosmic expansion, the number density of photons is

<p>The energy density of the universe is now dominated by dark energy (69%), 
it has a substantial matter component (dark 26% and atomic 5%), and 
trace amounts of radiation. However, the three energy components evolve 
in different ways: the matter and radiation densities decrease respectively as

</p>
<p>Even though ργ is much smaller than ρm today, as we follow cosmic 
evolution back in time, the radiation density grows faster than that of 
matter, and at teq &asymp; 60,000 years the two densities become equal (see the 
Appendix). At earlier times the radiation density was larger than both the 
matter and dark energy density. Thus this era is called the radiation era. At 
later times, the matter density dominates over radiation and dark energy. 
This matter era lasts for several billion years. Finally, roughly 5 billion years 
ago, the matter density dropped below that of the vacuum energy density, 
and the universe entered its current vacuum dominated era.
</p>
<p>During the radiation and matter era, the scale factor grows as a(t) &prop;
&radic;
</p>
<p>t 
and a(t) &prop; t2/3, respectively (as we show in the Appendix). In both of these 
eras the horizon distance grows linearly with time, dhor &sim; t, which is faster 
than a(t). Thus more and more of the universe becomes visible with time. 
The situation, however, is different in the vacuum era where the scale factor 
grows faster than the horizon. In this case, more and more of the observable 
universe exits our horizon, and less and less of the universe becomes visible 
with time (we will return to this in Chap. 16).
</p>
<p>Summary
When we follow the expansion of the universe backwards in time, the den-
sity and temperature increase without bound. All structure disintegrates at 
high temperatures; thus the early universe starts out as a fireball of the most 
basic particles, including electrons, protons, neutrons, and photons. The 
fireball uniformly fills the whole universe. As the universe expands, it cools 
down, and composite objects begin to form. Within the first three minutes 
after the big bang, the temperature dropped sufficiently for protons and 
neutrons to bind together into atomic nuclei. Then at about 380,000 years, 
electrons and nuclei combined to form neutral atoms, and the universe 
became transparent to light. We can now detect the radiation emitted from 
the fireball at that epoch; it comes to us from all directions in the sky. This is 
what we call the cosmic microwave background radiation.
</p>
<p>In broad-brush terms, the history of the universe can be divided into 
three cosmic eras: the radiation era, the matter era, and the current dark 
energy era. During each era the energy density is dominated by radiation, 
matter and dark energy, respectively.

<p>The universe is lit up with stars, which are scattered through space, forming 
a hierarchy of structure. Stars are assembled into galaxies, and galaxies are 
grouped in clusters, which are in turn grouped into still larger structures, 
called superclusters. The formation of cosmic structures is an active area of 
research, and we now believe we have a good idea of how they emerged.
</p>
<p>12.1  Cosmic Structure
</p>
<p>Galaxies come in three main types: spiral, elliptical and irregular, as shown 
in Fig. 12.1. The main components of a spiral galaxy are the central bulge, 
the flattened disk with spiral arms, and a huge dark matter halo. The disk 
of our Milky Way galaxy is roughly 100,000 light years across and about 
10,000 light years thick. The halo is nearly spherical, with a diameter about 
ten times larger than that of the disk. The Sun sits in the disk and is located 
about 25,000 light years from the galactic center. Large galaxies like the 
Milky Way contain of order 100 billion stars. The typical distance between 
stars in a galaxy is a few light years; this is much larger than the size of a star. 
If you imagine the Sun to be pea sized, the nearest star would be 160 km 
away! Thus galaxies are mostly empty.
</p>
<p>Galaxies group together to form clusters. The Milky Way belongs to a 
small cluster called the Local Group (see Fig. 12.2). The Andromeda galaxy 
also resides in the Local Group, some 2.5 million light years away. Although

galaxies (Fig. 12.3).

<p>Clusters are further grouped into superclusters, some of which contain 
hundreds of clusters (the Local Group is part of the Local Supercluster).

<p>12.1 Cosmic Structure     177
</p>
<p>Automated galaxy surveys, pioneered in the late 1980s at the Harvard 
Center for Astrophysics (CfA), also revealed that the galaxy distribution has 
a frothy appearance, with filaments and sheet-like walls of galaxies straddling 
huge voids (Fig. 12.4).
</p>
<p>What happens on still larger scales? Does the hierarchy of structure con-
tinue to grow, with superclusters grouping together and so on? Or does the 
distribution of galaxies become uniform above a certain scale? The Anglo-
Australian Observatory &ldquo;Two Degree Field&rdquo; (or 2dF) galaxy survey and 
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) set out to answer these questions. 
Extending out to 2 billion light years, these enormous surveys show that 
the large-scale distribution of galaxies exhibits a web-like structure with fila-
ments, sheets, clusters and voids (see Fig. 12.5). Consistent with the CfA 
results, the largest structures are roughly 300 million light years in size, and 
have a mass of about 1017 Solar masses (or 105 galactic masses). On still 
larger scales, the universe is homogeneous. There are no &ldquo;super-superclus-
ters&rdquo;. Thus, if the matter distribution were smoothed over distance scales of 
300 million light years, the universe would be homogeneous and isotropic, 
as assumed in the Friedmann models.

<p>12.2 Assembling Structure     179
</p>
<p>12.2  Assembling Structure
</p>
<p>Now that we are familiar with the hierarchical structure of the universe, we 
are faced with an inevitable question: How did all these structures arise? We 
know that the universe was very homogeneous when the CMB radiation was 
produced, at trec = 380,000 years. If it were perfectly homogeneous, having 
the same density everywhere, then it would remain that way forever. But we 
know from CMB observations that there were tiny deviations from perfect 
homogeneity (about one part in a hundred thousand). This is all that was 
needed to seed structure formation.
</p>
<p>A region that is denser than average will attract matter gravitationally 
from its surroundings. It thus gets even denser relative to the average, and 
its gravitational pull gets stronger, attracting even more matter. An over-
dense expanding region initially continues to expand, but eventually it turns 
around and collapses back on itself, forming a gravitationally bound object. 
This effect is called gravitational instability; it causes the matter distribution 
to become more and more lumpy. Only a tiny fluctuation is needed to get 
the process started.
</p>
<p>The basic idea is simple, but as it often happens, the details are rather 
complicated. It took several decades to sort them out, ultimately the follow-
ing picture has emerged:
</p>
<p>&bull; The gravitational instability is effective only if the expansion of the uni-
verse is sufficiently slow. During the radiation era the universe is expand-
ing too fast, so the growth of density fluctuations can begin in earnest 
only at teq &asymp; 60,000 years, when the matter era begins.
</p>
<p>&bull; The clustering of atomic matter develops differently from that of dark 
matter. The hot atomic gas has a high pressure, which prevents it from 
being pulled into clumps less massive than about 106 Solar masses. On 
larger mass scales, gravity wins and pressure does not play an important 
role. Dark matter, on the other hand, is influenced only by gravity,1 so its 
lumpiness begins to grow right after teq. (Here we assume that the dark 
matter is &ldquo;cold&rdquo;, in the sense that its particles move slowly and cannot 
escape the gravitational pull of the developing clumps. This is naturally 
satisfied if the dark matter particles are sufficiently massive).
</p>
<p>1Another difference of atomic gas from dark matter is that gas particles often collide, emitting photons 
in the process. As a result the gas loses energy, cools and sinks deeper towards the centers of dark matter 
clumps. This cooling process is important on galactic mass scales, up to 1012 Solar masses. Dark matter 
particles, on the other hand, interact very weakly and lose almost no energy in collisions. This explains 
why stars and gas are localized near the centers of dark matter halos.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>180     12 Structure Formation
</p>
<p>&bull; Smaller clumps take a shorter time to form; as a result structure forma-
tion proceeds in a hierarchical, bottom-up fashion. It begins with the 
formation of small dark matter clumps, which then merge to form larger 
and larger structures. Atomic matter starts falling into dark matter clumps 
at about 0.5 billion years ABB2 (after the big bang), when the typical 
mass of a clump exceeds 106 Solar masses. This is when the first stars are 
formed. Their light illuminates the universe, ending the cosmic dark age.
</p>
<p>&bull; A spherical overdense region would collapse to a localized gravitationally 
bound object. But a typical overdense region is more like an ellipsoid, 
which has different sizes along three orthogonal axes. It first collapses 
along its smallest axis to form an approximately 2-dimensional sheet. The 
sheet then collapses to form a filament, and finally the filament collapses 
to a localized halo. The observed galaxies and clusters are well localized, 
gravitationally bound objects, while superclusters are caught in the pro-
cess of their formation. Some of them resemble filaments or sheets, while 
others have a rather irregular appearance.
</p>
<p>&bull; About 5 billion years ago, when the matter era gave way to the current 
vacuum dominated era, the expansion of the universe started to acceler-
ate, causing further gravitational clumping to be quenched. This is why 
there will never be cosmic structures that are larger than superclusters.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that dark matter played a crucial role in structure 
formation. In the absence of dark matter, density fluctuations would start 
growing only much later than teq. The amount of growth that could occur 
by the onset of the vacuum era would then be insufficient for the formation 
of bound structures. Thus, if it were not for dark matter, the universe would 
be almost devoid of galaxies today.
</p>
<p>12.3  Watching Cosmic Structures Evolve
</p>
<p>The hierarchical scenario of structure formation has been tested by direct 
observation of distant galaxies. We can see what early galaxies looked like 
by taking galaxy images at higher and higher redshifts, that is, by looking 
deeper and deeper into space. The image in Fig. 12.6 was obtained by point-
ing the Hubble Space Telescope to a totally blank spot in the sky and tak-

<p>ing a very long exposure. This is known as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. It 
shows a multitude of early galaxies&mdash;some of them date back to less than a 
billion years ABB.
</p>
<p>These infant galaxies differ from today&rsquo;s galaxies in a number of ways. 
They are much smaller, with a typical size of 10,000 light years across, and 
generally appear to be chaotic and irregular. Furthermore, almost all infant 
galaxies are colliding or interacting gravitationally with their neighbors (see 
Fig. 12.7), compared to about 2% that are colliding today. All these features 
strongly suggest that present-day galaxies formed by collisions and mergers 
of smaller early galaxies.
</p>
<p>Another way to see cosmic structure formation unfold in front of you is 
to use a computer simulation. A few frames from one such simulation are 
shown in Fig. 12.8. The simulation follows the history of a large cubic vol-
ume as it expands to the present size of 160 million light years. It starts with 
a nearly uniform distribution of particles in the volume and includes only 
gravitational interactions of the particles and the gravitational effect of dark 
energy. This is a good approximation on the largest scales (galaxy clusters

of matter in the last frame closely resembles the large-scale galaxy distribu-
tion observed today.
</p>
<p>On galactic and smaller scales, the complicated dynamics of atomic gas 
cannot be ignored. Cosmologists are making progress simulating these 
dynamics on computers, but some details of galaxy and star formation are 
still not fully understood. This is now an active area of research.

<p>12.4  Primordial Density Fluctuations
</p>
<p>The picture of structure formation by gravitational instability relies on the 
existence of small primordial density fluctuations. The magnitude of these 
fluctuations can be different for regions of different size (or mass). In order

The cube expands with the universe (by a factor of 11), but the expansion has 
been factored out in the figure, so all &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; of the cube have the same 
apparent size. The snapshots are at redshifts 10, 4, 1, 0.5 and 0. (This simu-
lation was performed by A. Kravtsov and A. Klypin at the National Center for

</p>
<p>to fully characterize the fluctuations, one has to specify their spectrum&mdash;that 
is, the typical strength of the fluctuation as a function of mass. If the spec-
trum is peaked at some particular mass, then the first bound objects to form 
are likely to have this mass.3 Thus the evolution of structure in the universe 
depends on the form of the primordial fluctuation spectrum.
</p>
<p>The structure formation scenario outlined in this chapter and computer 
simulations, like the one in Fig. 12.8, assume the fluctuation strength to be 
approximately the same for all relevant mass scales. This is called the scale-
invariant fluctuation spectrum. But what is the origin of the primordial fluctu-
ations? And what determined their spectrum? These questions are addressed by 
the theory of cosmic inflation. We shall see in Chap. 17 that the fluctuation 
spectrum predicted by this theory is indeed nearly scale-invariant. Moreover, 
we shall see that this form of the spectrum is supported by observations.
</p>
<p>12.5  Supermassive Black Holes and Active 
Galaxies
</p>
<p>General relativity predicts that if we cram a large enough amount of mass 
into a small enough volume, we can create a black hole (see Chap. 4). Stellar 
mass black holes can form at the final stages of stellar evolution. There is 
also strong observational evidence for the existence of colossal, supermas-
sive black holes with masses of millions and even billions of Solar masses. 
Velocities of stars and gas close to galactic centers have been measured using 
Doppler shifts. These measurements reveal the presence of extremely massive 
compact objects lurking at the center of most galaxies&mdash;they are black holes! 
The black hole at the center of our Milky Way has a mass of about 3.7 mil-
lion Solar masses, while black holes in some other galaxies are more massive 
than a billion Solar masses.
</p>
<p>These monstrous black holes lie dormant most of the time. But when 
there is some gas near the galactic center, it falls into the black hole. The 
gas heats up and emits vast amounts of radiation as it spirals down into the 
hole. Radiation continues until the supply of gas is exhausted. During their 
explosive periods, supermassive black holes are the most luminous objects in 
the universe. Depending on the amount of energy released, and the type of 
radiation, we call them quasars or active galactic nuclei (Fig. 12.9).
</p>
<p>3There are also some additional factors that determine the mass (or size) of the first collapsed objects; 
we do not need to discuss this here in more detail.</p>

<p>184     12 Structure Formation
</p>
<p>Galaxy collisions perturb the gas distribution in the galaxies and trigger 
black hole feeding. Thus black hole activity should have been more com-
mon in the young universe, when the collision rate was high. Observations 
of quasars support this hypothesis. The quasars we observe are very distant, 
thus they are very old. Quasar formation rates peaked at about 2&ndash;3 billion 
years ABB. They represent an early stage in galaxy development.
</p>
<p>Summary
The origin of galaxies can be traced to tiny inhomogeneities in the primor-
dial fireball. Some regions of the fireball had a slightly higher density than 
others. The mass of these regions grew as they attracted matter from the sur-
rounding space, and over the course of billions of years they evolved into 
galaxies and larger structures.
</p>
<p>The scenario of structure formation suggested by combining mathemati-
cal analysis with simulations is that the first stars formed around 0.5 billion 
years after the big bang, followed by the birth of infant irregular galaxies. 
Large galaxies were formed via hierarchical assembly, from the merger of 
smaller ones. Galaxies then clumped into clusters, which further grouped 
into superclusters. On the largest scales, the universe exhibits a web-like

lion light years. On still larger scales, the growth of structure is quenched by 
gravitational repulsion due to dark energy, so there is no further clumping, 
and the universe is homogeneous.
</p>
<p>Questions
 1.  The largest structures in the universe have sizes of about 300 million

does the galaxy distribution look like on smaller scales?

atomic gas.

<p> 4. What is hierarchical clustering?
 5.  Can you explain why the large-scale distribution of galaxies has a web-

<p>like appearance, with filaments, walls and voids?
 6.  What observational evidence do we have for hierarchical structure for-

 7.  Given that the radius of a Solar mass black hole is 3 km, what is the

<p>radius of a billion Solar mass supermassive black hole? Compare it to the 
radius of Earth&rsquo;s orbit around the Sun (1.5 &times; 1011 m). (Recall the for-
mula for the Schwarzschild radius in Chap. 4).

<p> 8.  Imagine you live at an earlier cosmic epoch, when galaxies were much 
younger than they are today. How would the galaxies that you observe 
be different from the present galaxies? Would they be larger, smaller, or 
about the same size? Would they be closer or farther apart? What other 
differences would you expect?

<p>The chemical composition of the universe is rather simple. About 75% (by 
mass) of atomic matter is in the form of hydrogen, and almost all the rest is 
in the form of helium. All other chemical elements contribute less than 2% 
of the atomic mass. Why is it that some elements are more abundant than oth-
ers? And where did the elements come from in the first place? These questions 
cannot be avoided, since atoms, and even atomic nuclei, could not exist in 
the early moments after the big bang. The challenge, then, is to understand 
how the elements were created by physical processes during the course of 
cosmic evolution.
</p>
<p>13.1  Why Alchemists Did Not Succeed
</p>
<p>The chemical properties of an atom are determined by the number of elec-
trons it contains, which is equal to the number of protons residing in the 
nucleus. The number of protons defines the type of chemical element. For 
example, hydrogen has 1 proton, and gold has 79 protons. Atoms that 
have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons have 
almost identical chemical properties; they are called isotopes. For example, 
helium-4 has two protons and two neutrons in the nucleus, while helium-3 
has two protons and only one neutron in the nucleus. The composition of 
some of the simplest atomic nuclei is shown in Fig. 13.1. There are 92 natu-
rally occurring elements; their relative abundances in the universe are plot-
ted in Fig. 13.2.

</p>
<p>Alchemists in the Middle Ages tried to turn more abundant elements into 
gold. Newton also devoted much of his time to research in alchemy. Today 
we know there was a good reason why this research was doomed. In order to 
change one chemical element into another, one has to learn how to change 
the number of protons in the atomic nuclei. There are at least two ways to 
do so. First, you can hit the nucleus with something, so that it splits into 
two; and second, you can smash two nuclei together, hoping that they will 
merge and form a larger nucleus. Both methods have their problems.
</p>
<p>The problem with the first method is that protons and neutrons are held 
in the nucleus by the strong nuclear force, so it takes a collision of very high 
energy to break a nucleus into two. The problem with the second method

</p>
<p>is that the attractive nuclear force is strong only at very short distances, so 
before you can make two colliding nuclei stick together, you have to bring 
them very close to one another. There is, however, an electric repulsion 
between positively charged nuclei, and once again you need to supply very 
high energy to overcome this repulsion. The particle energies needed for 
nuclear transformations require temperatures in excess of tens of millions of 
degrees Kelvin. Such temperatures are naturally reached only in stellar interi-
ors and in the early universe.
</p>
<p>George Gamow, the founder of the hot big bang theory, suggested that 
elements were synthesized shortly after the big bang. He developed this idea 
in collaboration with Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman. It is now called big 
bang nucleosynthesis.
</p>
<p>13.2  Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
</p>
<p>Let us go back to a time around the first few seconds after the big bang. 
The temperature of the universe is several billion Kelvin and the fireball is 
a mix of neutrons, protons, electrons, photons, and neutrinos. At earlier 
times, neutrons and protons were in thermal equilibrium, converting back 
and forth into one another through weak nuclear processes like
</p>
<p>A neutron is more massive than a proton and electron combined, so it costs 
extra energy to convert a proton into a neutron. As the universe expands 
and cools, energetic electrons needed to make the conversion become more 
and more rare, and neutrons become less and less numerous relative to the 
protons. At about one second ABB, the rates of conversion reactions become 
too slow to keep up with the expansion of the universe, so proton to neu-
tron conversions effectively cease. At that time, there are approximately 6 
protons for each neutron.
</p>
<p>Isolated neutrons are unstable1 and decay into protons and lighter parti-
cles with an average lifetime of 15 min:
</p>
<p>(13.1)proton + electron &harr; neutron + neutrino
</p>
<p>(13.2)neutron &rarr; proton + electron + antineutrino
</p>
<p>1Neutrons in atomic nuclei are stabilized by strong nuclear interactions.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>190     13 Element Abundances
</p>
<p>Thus the universe had about 15 min to create the elements. Otherwise, it 
would have run out of neutrons, and the only element it would contain 
would be hydrogen.
</p>
<p>The first step in nucleosynthesis is for a neutron to fuse with a proton 
to make deuterium, or heavy hydrogen (see Fig. 13.3). The deuterium 
is very fragile, but it is possible for two deuterium nuclei to fuse to make 
either helium-3 plus a neutron, or tritium plus a proton. There are now two 
ways in which helium-4 (this is the common helium nucleus consisting of 
two neutrons and two protons) can be formed: deuterium can fuse with 
helium-3 to make a stable helium-4 nucleus (plus a proton), or deuterium 
can fuse with tritium to form a stable helium nucleus (plus a neutron).
</p>
<p>Early on, the main impediment to this chain of reactions is that the frag-
ile deuterium nucleus gets destroyed by collisions with energetic photons 
before it combines with more deuterium to form helium-3 or tritium. But 
at about 1 min ABB, when the temperature dropped to one billion Kelvin, 
the photon energies are no longer sufficient to break deuterium. By this

<p>13.2 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis     191
</p>
<p>time, the neutron to proton ratio has dropped to 1:7. From this point on, 
nucleosynthesis proceeds rather quickly, until almost all neutrons end up in 
helium. The process is essentially complete when the universe is about 3 min 
old. The abundance of helium predicted in this scenario is 25% by mass,2 
in excellent agreement with observation. The bulk of the remaining atomic 
mass is in the form of hydrogen.
</p>
<p>Trace amounts of other light elements were also created during big bang 
nucleosynthesis. The predicted abundances of these elements are sensi-
tively dependent on the nucleon density nn at that epoch. Since the den-
sity changes with the expansion of the universe, it is more convenient to use 
the nucleon to photon ratio, η = nn
</p>
<p>nγ
, which is nearly independent of time. 
</p>
<p>Good agreement between theoretical predictions and the observed abun-
dances (about 10&minus;5 deuterium, 10&minus;5 helium-3, and 10&minus;10 lithium-7) is 
achieved for η &asymp; 6 &times; 10&minus;10 (see Fig. 13.4)3. Thus we should expect the uni-
verse to have about 1.6 billion photons for each nucleon.
</p>
<p>This result has far reaching implications. Using the value of η and 
the present number density of CMB photons (nγ &asymp; 4 &times; 10
</p>
<p>8
m
</p>
<p>&minus;3, see 
Sect. 11.6), we can find the present average number density of nucle-
ons, nn = ηnγ &asymp; 0.24 m
</p>
<p>&minus;3. Furthermore, considering that almost all the 
mass of atomic matter comes from nucleons (they are about two thousand 
times heavier than electrons), we can determine the average atomic mass 
density, ρat &asymp; nnmn &asymp; 4 &times; 10
</p>
<p>&minus;28 kg/m3, where mn &asymp; 1.7 &times; 10
&minus;27 kg 
</p>
<p>is the nucleon mass. In terms of the critical density, this gives 
�at = ρat/ρc &asymp; 0.05. This value is comparable to the observed amount of 
matter in stars and interstellar gas&mdash;but then not much is left to account for 
the dark matter.
</p>
<p>The amount of dark matter in the universe is about five times that in stars 
and gas, �dark &asymp; 0.26. Now we have to conclude that most of this matter 
cannot be made of ordinary atoms. It must consist of some &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; stable 
particles that have not yet been discovered.
</p>
<p>The agreement between theory and observation for the abundances of the 
light elements is a remarkable accomplishment. But what about the heavy 
</p>
<p>2This number is easy to understand, considering that (i) there are 7 protons for each neutron (or 14 
protons for 2 neutrons) and (ii) almost all neutrons end up in helium. For each helium nucleus (captur-
ing 2 neutrons and two protons), 12 protons (hydrogen nuclei) are left free. Therefore, by mass, there is 
a 12:4 ratio of hydrogen to helium, which is precisely the 75% hydrogen, 25% helium prediction.
3The lithium abundance obtained by more accurate recent measurements is lower than predicted by 
about a factor of 3. The origin of this discrepancy is presently unclear; it is a subject of intense investi-
gation.</p>

<p>elements? Here Gamow, Alpher and Hermann reached an impasse. The big 
bang nucleosynthesis does not progress much beyond helium. The reasons 
are that there are no stable nuclei consisting of 5 nucleons, and that a simul-
taneous attachment of two or more nucleons is highly unlikely. This &ldquo;short-
coming&rdquo; of the big bang model, known as the 5-nucleon gap, allowed other 
cosmological theories to thrive as viable alternatives, for a while.
</p>
<p>In particular, before the big bang model was generally accepted, Fred 
Hoyle, Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold proposed the steady state theory 
(as discussed in Chap. 7). According to this theory, the state of the uni-
verse has not changed over time, and the universe never went through a hot 
explosive stage. Hoyle suggested therefore that all elements were created in 
stars. While we now know that the hydrogen and helium abundances are set 
during the big bang, Hoyle was partly right about nucleosynthesis: elements 
heavier than lithium were indeed formed in stars.

<p>13.3 Stellar Nucleosynthesis     193
</p>
<p>13.3  Stellar Nucleosynthesis
</p>
<p>Stars are gaseous spheres held together by gravity and heated by nuclear 
reactions in their interiors. Our Sun is a typical middle-size star, consist-
ing mostly of hydrogen (71%). Its surface temperature is 6000 K and the 
central temperature is 107 K. Hydrogen is burned into helium in the cen-
tral parts of stars like the Sun; helium ash is collected at the core. When all 
the hydrogen is burnt in the central region, the star can no longer support 
itself against gravity. The core begins to contract, and its temperature rises. 
Outside the core, a shell of hydrogen continues to burn into helium. Once 
the core reaches a temperature of T ~ 108 K, the helium ash starts burning 
to carbon and oxygen.
</p>
<p>For a star with about the Sun&rsquo;s mass, nuclear reactions do not go beyond 
this point. Due to the heat generated in the core, the star will swell to 
become a red giant, and then will blow off its envelope, leaving a compact 
white dwarf remnant. If such a remnant happens to be in a binary pair, then 
it is possible for the white dwarf to accrete matter from its partner. Once a 
critical amount of matter is added to the star, it can undergo a supernova 
explosion. On the other hand, for massive stars (8 or more Solar masses), 
core burning can continue all the way until iron is formed. The process stops 
at iron, which is the most stable of all nuclei (see Fig. 13.5). Thus, more 
massive stars have a layered structure, with heavier elements produced at 
deeper levels, where the temperature is higher.
</p>
<p>When a massive star runs out of nuclear fuel at the center, the central 
core collapses, reaching enormous densities and temperatures T ~ 1010 K. 
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.5 Stellar nucleosynthesis. The heaviest element that can be synthesized 
in the core is iron. Other heavy elements are burnt in shell-like layers close to the 
center, while lighter elements continue to burn in the outer layers, where the 
temperature is lower</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>194     13 Element Abundances
</p>
<p>Elements heavier than iron are forged during core collapse and the gigantic 
supernova explosion which immediately follows4. These heavy elements are 
expelled into the interstellar medium where they serve as raw material for 
new stars and planets.5 Planets form as a natural by-product of star forma-
tion. Thus in a very real sense, we are recycled star dust&mdash;the carbon in our 
cells, the iron in our blood and the calcium in our bones were all made in 
the centers of stars, and then recycled into the universe (Fig. 13.6).
</p>
<p>13.4  Planetary System Formation
</p>
<p>All planetary systems, including our Solar System, are believed to have 
formed in about the same way. A large, slowly rotating cloud of gas begins 
to contract due to gravitational forces. As the cloud contracts the rotation 
speeds up, much like an ice-skater spins faster as her hands are pulled in

</p>
<p>4If the progenitor star has a mass between 8 and 20 Solar masses, the remnant left after core collapse is 
a super-dense neutron star. Core collapse in stars more massive that 20 Solar masses is expected to pro-
duce black holes.
5We emphasize that primordial nucleosynthesis is the only explanation we have for the abundances of 
helium and other light elements. This particularly applies to deuterium, which can only be destroyed in 
stars. And the amount of helium produced in all stars is only around one percent of the total amount 
observed in the universe.</p>

<p>towards her body.6 The combined action of gravity and rotation causes 
the cloud to flatten into a thin disc. As the cloud contracts, the material 
becomes denser and hotter, especially towards the center, and eventually the 
central region becomes a star, and some of the material in the disk coalesces 
into a series of planets (see Fig. 13.7).
</p>
<p>Our Solar System consists of the Sun, eight planets, an asteroid belt 
between Mars and Jupiter, and the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune&rsquo;s orbit 
(see Fig. 13.8). Almost all of the mass in the Solar System is concentrated 
in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass in the largest planet&mdash;Jupiter. 
The first four planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) are called terres-
trial planets as they have the same rocky makeup as the Earth; the next four 
planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are the gaseous planets. The 
asteroid and Kuiper belts consist mostly of bodies that are much smaller 
than the planets. Jupiter&rsquo;s gravitational bullying prevented the material in 
the asteroid belt from becoming a planet, and the material in the Kuiper belt 
probably never collided frequently enough to coalesce into a planet.
</p>
<p>Planets outside of the Solar System are very hard to detect, because light 
reflected by any planet is very dim compared to the brightness of the star 
it orbits. Astronomers therefore use indirect detection methods, looking for 
minute effects that the orbiting planet has on the spectrum and the bright-
ness of the star. The first successful detection of an extrasolar planet was

<p>Fig. 13.7 Formation of a planetary system. a A rotating cloud of gas starts to col-
lapse. b The collapsing material collects mostly near the center and flattens into a 
rotating disc at the periphery. The central material becomes a protostar and some 
clumps of matter start to stick together in the disk. c Wind from the protostar 
clears out most of the surrounding material. The remaining material continues to 
stick together to form local aggregates of matter. Planets which orbit in the same 
direction and in the same plane are eventually formed. Credit Eric Chaisson (from 
Astronomy Today, Eric Chaisson, Stephen McMillan, Colombus (Ohio))

<p>6The physical principle behind the spin-up of a contracting cloud (and the ice-skater) is angular 
momentum conservation.</p>

<p>made in 1992 using the Doppler shift method. The gravitational pull of the 
planet causes the star to move ever so slightly, inducing a Doppler shift in 
the spectrum of the star. The spectrum is periodically blue and red-shifted 
as the star moves forward and backward relative to the Earth. This method 
works best for very massive planets located in close proximity to their stars.
</p>
<p>An alternative method is to measure how much a star dims when a planet 
passes in front of it. The amount of dimming is proportional to the fraction 
of the stellar disc blocked and grows with the size of the planet. By meas-
uring the duration of each dimming and the time interval between them, 
one can also determine the revolution period and the radius of the planet&rsquo;s 
orbit. The Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009, used this method to 
discover thousands of extrasolar planets, indicating that planet formation is 
quite common in the universe. On average, the estimated number is more 
than one planet per star.
</p>
<p>13.5  Life in the Universe
</p>
<p>With a multitude of planetary systems already discovered, one cannot help 
but wonder how many of them might harbor life and intelligence, and what 
exotic forms that alien life might take. Life as we know it on Earth is based 
on chains of carbon atoms. This is probably not an accident: carbon is one 
of the most abundant elements and it has the richest chemistry. Other ele-
ments involved in life&mdash;hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen&mdash;are also among

<p>the most abundant in the universe (see Fig. 13.2). Another key ingredient 
necessary to enable biochemical reactions is liquid water, which plays the 
role of a solvent.7
</p>
<p>There is no shortage of water on most extrasolar planets, but it is 
either frozen or vaporized if the planet is too far or too close to the star. 
Astronomers estimate that about 20% of stars have Earth-sized planets with 
surface temperatures allowing for the existence of liquid water. With about 
1022 stars in the observable universe, this amounts to Np ~ 10
</p>
<p>21 potentially 
habitable planets.
</p>
<p>This is a lot of planets, but the number of planets that are actually inhab-
ited by living creatures is very hard to assess. Living organisms are charac-
terized by their ability to reproduce and to undergo Darwinian evolution. 
Once evolution starts, species proliferate and adapt to the changing environ-
ment. This makes life very resilient: life on Earth has survived a number of 
catastrophic climate changes induced by asteroid impacts, massive volcano 
eruptions, etc. But in order to get the evolution going, the first living organ-
ism had to be formed somehow. How this could happen is presently a great 
mystery and a subject of ongoing scientific debate.
</p>
<p>One can imagine that life started with a relatively short molecular chain, 
which could replicate itself. But the probability for such a chain to arise 
by chance from non-living matter is likely to be very small. Another road-
block on the way to life is the origin of the genetic code and of the complex 
molecular machinery that builds proteins (of which all living organisms are 
made) following the instructions encoded in DNA. At the present level of 
understanding, we cannot exclude the possibility that fluctuations necessary 
for the evolution of life are so rare that life on Earth is the only life that has 
ever evolved within our cosmic horizon.
</p>
<p>Fossil evidence indicates that microbial life existed on Earth about 3.8 bil-
lion years ago. Prior to that, the Earth was heavily bombarded by asteroids 
and life was probably impossible. Thus, it seems like life emerged almost 
as soon as it could. At first glance, this suggests that life appears easily, and 
therefore the universe should be teaming with primitive life forms. But it 
could also be that the rare fluctuation necessary for the emergence of life was 
more likely to occur in the turbulent environment of the early Earth. Then 
the most probable time to form life would be soon after a planet forms, but 
only a small fraction of planets would have life.
</p>
<p>7Alternative forms of biochemistry have also been hypothesized. For example, life might be based on 
silicon and use ammonia as a solvent. Here we focus on Earth-like life.</p>

<p>198     13 Element Abundances
</p>
<p>Even if primitive life is abundant in the universe, the chances for it to 
evolve intelligence are highly uncertain. Dinosaurs roamed the Earth for 
more than 150 million years and did not develop a technological civiliza-
tion. We may soon have a better idea of how widespread intelligent life 
actually is. An extensive international program of observations searching 
for signs of extraterrestrial intelligent life, called Breakthrough Listen, was 
launched in 2016.
</p>
<p>Summary
The lightest atomic nuclei&mdash;hydrogen, helium, and small amounts of deu-
terium and lithium&mdash;were formed during the first few minutes after the big 
bang. The theory of big bang nucleosynthesis tightly constrains the amount 
of atomic matter that can exist in the universe and leads to the conclusion 
that most of the dark matter consists of some unknown particles.
</p>
<p>Elements up to iron are produced in the cores of stars, and heavier ele-
ments are made during violent supernova explosions, which then spew these 
heavy elements into the interstellar medium. New generations of stars form 
from the enriched interstellar gas, and planets form as by-products.
</p>
<p>We now know that planetary systems are abundant in the universe, and 
astronomers estimate that there are a huge number of habitable planets. We 
still do not know how to estimate the probability for primitive life to arise 
on a generic habitable planet. Even if primitive life is common, intelligent 
life may still be relatively rare. If so, we may be the lone technologically 
advanced civilization in our cosmic horizon.

<p>At the time of nucleosynthesis, the primordial fireball consisted of electrons, 
protons, neutrons, photons and neutrinos. As we get closer to the big bang, 
the fireball gets hotter and denser, and other types of particles emerge. They 
move at nearly the speed of light, colliding frequently and violently. As we 
shall see, some of the most dramatic events in the history of the universe 
occurred within a small fraction of a second after the big bang.

</p>
<p>The temperature of the early universe is proportional to the average pho-
ton energy. Physicists measure particle energies and masses in electron-volts. 
One electron-volt is the energy gained by an electron as it moves across a 
potential difference of one volt, 1 eV = 1.6 &times; 10&minus;19 J; the equivalent mass 
is 1 eV = 2 &times; 10&minus;36 kg. Other related units are the MeV = 106 eV, 
GeV = 10
</p>
<p>9
eV, and TeV = 1012 eV. If energy is measured in MeV and tem-
</p>
<p>perature in Kelvins, the average energy per photon is roughly
</p>
<p>Thus, an energy of E = 1 MeV corresponds to a temperature of T &sim; 1010 K.
It follows from Eqs. (14.1) and (14.2) that at about 100 s (when nucleosyn-
</p>
<p>thesis takes place), the density of the universe is about 50 times that of water 
(ρ = 50,000 kg/m3), and the temperature is a billion Kelvin (T = 109 K), 
which is about 100 times hotter than the core of the Sun. At 1 s, the density 
is 500 thousand times that of water, and the temperature is 10 billion Kelvin. 
Jumping back to a microsecond, the density soars to ρ &sim; 1021 kg/m3, and 
the temperature is ten trillion Kelvin (T = 1013 K). The primordial caul-
dron is an extreme environment! The closer we get to the big bang, the more 
energetic the particles become and the more frequently they smash into one 
another. It is therefore important to understand what happens in such high-
energy collisions.
</p>
<p>Physicists study particle collisions with the help of colossal machines 
called accelerators. Inside an accelerator particle accelerator, particles are 
boosted to extremely high energies by electric fields, and then oppositely 
directed particle beams are aimed at one another in a small area surrounded 
by detectors. By studying the collision debris, physicists try to figure out the 
laws governing high-energy particle interactions (Fig. 14.1).
</p>
<p>In a high-energy particle collision, there are generally a number of pos-
sible outcomes, which occur with different probabilities. The range of pos-
sibilities is restricted by a few conservation laws, such as energy and charge 
conservation: the total energy and the total electric charge should be the 
same before and after the collision. Other conserved quantities include 
baryon and lepton numbers and the &ldquo;color&rdquo; charge. Any process that is not 
forbidden by conservation laws will occur with some nonzero probability, 
which can be calculated using the rules of quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>A remarkable property of particle encounters is that the colliding particles 
can change their identity. For example, a pair of photons can turn into an 
electron-positron pair, as illustrated in Fig. 14.2. The positron is the elec-
tron&rsquo;s antiparticle&mdash;all particles have an antiparticle with identical proper-
ties, except for having opposite charges. Photons are their own antiparticles;

</p>
<p>their electric and other charges are all equal to zero. Particles and antiparti-
cles are often created in pairs, as in the electron-positron pair production. 
The inverse process, called pair annihilation occurs when a particle and an 
antiparticle collide and turn into two photons. The number of particles can 
also be changed: two initial particles can produce a hail of other particles fly-
ing away from the collision point (see Fig. 14.3). These types of events were 
commonplace in the early moments after the big bang.

</p>
<p>Energy conservation requires that a pair of photons creating a particle-
antiparticle pair must have a combined energy of at least 2 mc2, where m is 
the particle&rsquo;s mass.2 The electron mass is me &asymp; 0.5 MeV, so electron-posi-
tron pairs are copiously produced at temperatures greater than 5 &times; 109 K 
(corresponding to photon energies E � 0.5 MeV). As a result, the primor-
dial fireball gets populated with electrons and positrons having about the 
same density as photons, and about the same energy per particle. Under 
these conditions, pair creation by photon collisions occurs at the same rate 
as pair annihilation due to electron-positron encounters, so electrons, posi-
trons and photons are in thermal equilibrium.
</p>
<p>At still higher temperatures, more massive particles and antiparticles 
appear. Muons, for example, have a mass of m&micro; &asymp; 100 MeV; in the first 
microsecond they are abundantly present in equilibrium with their antipar-
ticles, at T &gt; 1012 K. Each kind of particle has a threshold temperature that 
must be reached in order for that particle type to be created in large num-
bers. In the early universe, as the fireball expands and cools, particles and 
antiparticles annihilate, and cannot be replenished, when the temperature 
drops below the corresponding threshold. Thus, muons annihilate with anti-
muons at t &sim; 10&minus;6 s, and electron-positron pairs annihilate at t &sim; 1 s ABB.

<p>14.2 The Standard Model of Particle Physics     205
</p>
<p>14.2  The Standard Model of Particle Physics
</p>
<p>Particle physicists have developed a theory, called the Standard Model, 
which accurately describes most of the known particles and their interac-
tions (see Fig. 14.4). Particles can be divided into matter particles called fer-
mions, and force particles, called gauge bosons. In addition, there is a particle 
called the Higgs boson, which plays a special role in the theory, as we shall 
explain below.
</p>
<p>Technically, the classification of particles into fermions and bosons is 
based on a quantum property called spin. Very roughly, a particle can be pic-
tured as a tiny ball rotating about its axis, with spin characterizing the inten-
sity of rotation. Spin can take only a discrete set of values: 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, &hellip;. 
Fermions have half- integer spin, and bosons have integer spin. All fermions 
of the Standard Model have spin &frac12;, all gauge bosons have spin 1, and the 
Higgs boson has spin 0.

<p>206     14 The Very Early Universe
</p>
<p>14.2.1  The Particles
</p>
<p>The elementary fermions include six quarks (with the whimsical names3: up, 
down, charm, strange, top and bottom) and six leptons (the electron, muon, 
tau particle, and their associated neutrinos). Individual quarks are never 
observed in nature; they are always tightly bound together into composite 
particles called hadrons. The most familiar hadrons are protons (composed 
of two up and one down quarks) and neutrons (composed of one up and 
two down quarks). All other hadrons are unstable. They can be produced 
in particle accelerators, but thereafter decay in a small fraction of a second. 
Leptons do not bind together like quarks do. All three neutrinos are stable, 
very light, and interact extremely weakly. The muon and the tau have the 
same electric charge as the electron, but are much heavier and rapidly decay 
into electrons and neutrinos.
</p>
<p>To describe almost all known matter, we need essentially only four par-
ticles: the up and down quarks, the electron and the electron neutrino. 
Together they make up the so-called first generation of elementary particles. 
Apart from accelerator experiments and some extreme astrophysical pro-
cesses, the properties of our world would not change if the other two genera-
tions (the second and third columns in Fig. 14.4) did not exist.
</p>
<p>14.2.2  The Forces
</p>
<p>All the interactions between particles can be described by four forces: grav-
ity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force. 
Although we are all very familiar with gravity, it is the only force (that we 
know of ) that is not described by the Standard Model of particle physics&mdash;
we will return to this important distinction later. All particles interact gravi-
tationally via the hypothesized graviton, which has yet to be observed.
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic force acts between electrically charged particles. It is 
mediated by photons: one particle emits a photon and the other absorbs it, 
as shown in Fig. 14.5. This force gives rise to most of the physics we are 
familiar with, and to all of chemistry. It is the glue that keeps electrons in 
atoms and is responsible for interactions between atoms and molecules.
</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the strong nuclear force is the strongest of the four 
interactions. It binds quarks into nucleons and holds nucleons together 
</p>
<p>3The quark names have no meaning other than serving to distinguish the different quark particles. For 
example, &ldquo;up&rdquo; and &ldquo;down&rdquo; have nothing to do with direction.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.2 The Standard Model of Particle Physics     207
</p>
<p>in nuclei. Quarks carry the so-called &ldquo;color&rdquo; charge and interact through 
exchange of gluons, in much the same way as electrically charged particles 
interact through the exchange of photons. An important difference is that 
photons carry no electric charge while gluons themselves carry a color charge 
and can emit and absorb other gluons.
</p>
<p>The weak nuclear force is responsible for some radioactive decays and for 
the interactions of neutrinos. It is mediated by the massive W and Z bosons. 
The weakness of this interaction and its short (microscopic) range are due to 
the large masses of its gauge bosons.
</p>
<p>The Higgs boson does not mediate any force, but this particle and its 
associated field, called the Higgs field, play a key role in the Standard Model. 
The Higgs field is related to the Higgs particle in the same way as the elec-
tromagnetic field is related to the photon. The Higgs boson has a large mass 
and a short lifetime; its production requires very powerful accelerators. It 
was finally discovered in 2012, almost 50 years after its prediction in 1964 
by Peter Higgs and by Francois Englert and Robert Brout. The Higgs field is 
present all around us, at every point in space, and its presence has a dramatic 
impact on the physical character of our world.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the properties and the significance of the Higgs field, we can 
compare it to the magnetic field, which also permeates the space around us. 
We cannot feel the magnetic field with our sense organs, but we can detect 
its presence using a compass or by observing trajectories of charged particles; 
</p>
<p>Fig. 14.5 Two electrons are electromagnetically repelled as they exchange a 
photon</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>208     14 The Very Early Universe
</p>
<p>instead of a straight line, a particle in a magnetic field moves along a  spiral 
path.4 Magnetic fields are produced by electric currents; for example, the 
magnetic field of the Earth is due to the currents flowing in the core of our 
planet. But as one gets very far away from planets and stars, the magnetic 
field strength declines towards zero.
</p>
<p>The Higgs field, on the other hand, is non-zero even in vacuum; it has 
the same strength everywhere in the universe. Another distinction is that the 
magnetic field is a vector&mdash;it is characterized by both magnitude and direc-
tion. The Higgs field is characterized only by its magnitude. Such fields are 
called scalar fields. In this regard the Higgs field is similar to the tempera-
ture, which also has some magnitude at each point in space and time, but no 
direction.
</p>
<p>If we could vary the magnitude of the Higgs field, we would feel the 
unpleasant effects immediately. The masses of all matter particles in the 
Standard Model (except neutrinos) are proportional to the Higgs field. So, 
if the strength of the field were changed, the masses would also be altered, 
resulting in some new physical and chemical properties of all matter. If 
we could turn off the Higgs field completely, all Standard Model particles 
would become massless and would move at the speed of light. In particular, 
the W and Z bosons would be massless, like photons, and the weak nuclear 
force would be essentially indistinguishable from electromagnetism. The 
universe would be a very different place! So, why is the Higgs field non-zero?
</p>
<p>14.3  Symmetry Breaking
</p>
<p>There is a good reason why the magnetic field is zero in vacuum. Fields, like 
particles, have a certain amount of energy. In any region where the magnetic 
field is non-zero, it has an energy density proportional to the square of the 
field; see Fig. 14.6. As the field is increased, its energy grows. Since the vac-
uum is the state of lowest energy, the magnetic field must vanish in vacuum.
</p>
<p>The energy density of the Higgs field exhibits a very different behavior, 
which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 14.7. The lowest energy states are 
now at non-zero values of the field, which are labeled V and &minus;V in the fig-
ure. They are the vacuum states of the theory. It does not matter which of 
</p>
<p>4The spiral curves in opposite directions for positively and negatively charged particles, and its radius 
depends on the particle&rsquo;s energy. Physicists use these properties to analyze high-energy collisions, like 
the one shown in Fig. 14.3.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.3 Symmetry Breaking     209
</p>
<p>these states nature choses: they have identical physical properties. But with 
either choice the Higgs field is non-zero in the vacuum. The two vacuum 
states are separated by a high energy hill, with the top of the hill correspond-
ing to vanishing Higgs field. Setting the Higgs field to zero, even in a small 
region of space, would thus be a very costly proposition. For just one cubic 
centimeter the required energy far exceeds the present energy resources of 
our planet.
</p>
<p>The energy dependence of the kind shown in Fig. 14.7 is not uncommon 
in nature and can even occur for an ordinary magnetic field. The case in 
point is a simple bar magnet (Fig. 14.8). Each atom in a magnet acts like 
a tiny magnet itself. Interaction between these microscopic magnets causes 
them to align, resulting in a large magnetic field. The energy curve for a bar

which have non-zero Higgs field values, labelled &minus;V, and V</p>

<p>210     14 The Very Early Universe
</p>
<p>magnet as a function of the magnetic field has the same form as in Fig. 14.7. 
The two energy minima now correspond to the same strength of the field, 
but opposite directions of magnetization. Clearly, these two states have iden-
tical properties, since they can be obtained from one another by rotating the 
magnet 180&deg; about a vertical axis. In the case of a magnet, the energy cost of 
setting the magnetic field to zero is not prohibitively high. When the mag-
net is heated to a temperature above 103 K (the so-called Curie tempera-
ture), the alignment of atoms is destroyed by random thermal motions, and 
macroscopic magnetization disappears. If the magnet is then cooled below 
the Curie point, it gets spontaneously magnetized, with the direction of 
magnetization selected randomly by thermal fluctuations.5
</p>
<p>We now introduce the important concepts of symmetry and symme-
try breaking. We say that a physical system has symmetry if there are some 
transformations that leave it unchanged. For example, a spherical object 
is symmetric, since it does not change if we rotate it about any axis pass-
ing through its center. An iron bar heated above the Curie temperature has 
symmetry with respect to flipping. But the same bar below the Curie tem-
perature has no such symmetry. It gets magnetized, and the magnetization 
direction is reversed when the bar is flipped. We say in such cases that the 
symmetry has been broken.
</p>
<p>Getting back to the Standard Model, the state with a vanishing Higgs 
field has a high degree of symmetry. Matter particles in this state are 
</p>

about the vertical axis (right). The direction of magnetization reverses, but the 
energy is the same
</p>
<p>5This picture of spontaneous magnetization applies only to very small magnets. When a large piece of 
iron is cooled below the Curie temperature, it splits into a number of domains with different directions 
of magnetization.</p>

</p>
<p> interchangeable, since they all have zero mass.6 The weak nuclear force is 
indistinguishable from electromagnetism; together, they are referred to as 
the electroweak force, and the symmetry between them is called the elec-
troweak symmetry. As we discussed, however, this symmetric state does not 
correspond to the minimum of energy, so the Higgs field becomes non-zero 
and the symmetry gets broken.
</p>
<p>Just like in a bar magnet, the electroweak symmetry is restored at suf-
ficiently high temperatures. But in this case the universe has to be heated 
above 1015 K! The average particle energies are then E &gt; 100 GeV, high 
enough to populate the fireball with W, Z and Higgs bosons. These extreme 
conditions are recreated in high-energy particle collisions. As predicted, 
experiments show that the differences between the weak and electromagnetic 
forces disappear at energies above 100 GeV.
</p>

</p>
<p>We are now ready to summarize the important milestones of the early universe.
</p>
<p>Electroweak symmetry breaking: t &sim; 10&minus;10 s (T &sim; 1015 K)
Before this event, all Standard Model particles are massless; they (and their 
antiparticles) populate the fireball with about the same density as photons. 
As the symmetry gets broken, all particle masses become different, and the 
weak and electromagnetic interactions become distinct. Soon after that, W, 
Z and Higgs bosons annihilate with their antiparticles.
</p>
<p>Quark confinement: t &sim; 10&minus;6 s (T &sim; 1013 K)
We mentioned in Sect. 14.2 that individual quarks are never observed; they 
are confined by gluons into protons and neutrons. However, at times earlier 
than a microsecond ABB, the density of protons, neutrons and their antipar-
ticles is so high that they overlap, and their constituent quarks mix together, 
forming a dense gas of quarks, antiquarks and gluons. At t &sim; 10&minus;6 s, the 
density of this gas drops enough for quarks to become bound together into 
non-overlapping protons and neutrons. The average particle energy at that 
time is E &sim; 1 GeV. Almost all the protons, neutrons, and their antiparticles 
annihilate soon thereafter, producing photons (and also other light particles,

<p>6More precisely, leptons cannot be distinguished from other leptons and quarks from other quarks, 
but quarks can be distinguished from leptons, since only quarks can interact through the exchange of 
gluons.</p>

otherwise there would be no nucleons left to form atomic matter. This tells 
us that there was a small imbalance: nucleons outnumbered antinucleons by

<p>14.5  Physics Beyond the Standard Model
</p>
<p>The Standard Model describes much of the amazing variety and complexity of 
our physical world&mdash;and yet it is incomplete. It does not account for neutrino 
masses, and the gravitational force lies outside its scope. Moreover, as we dis-
cussed in Chap. 13, dark matter cannot be made of ordinary atoms and must 
consist of some unknown particles, not included in the Standard Model.
</p>
<p>14.5.1  Unifying the Fundamental Forces
</p>
<p>An overarching theme in the history of physics has been the idea of unifica-
tion. It has long been a dream of particle physicists to develop a unified the-
ory that describes all particles and their interactions. Einstein himself spent 
the last thirty years of his life, struggling (unsuccessfully) to unify electro-
magnetism with gravity.
</p>
<p>In 1864, Maxwell&rsquo;s theory of electromagnetism unified the previously 
separate phenomena of electricity and magnetism. About 100 years later, 
scientists developed the electroweak theory,7 which unified  electromagnetism

<p>and the weak interactions at energies E &sim; 100 GeV (T &sim; 1015 K). The 
strong interactions are described by a separate theory, called quantum chro-
modynamics.8 The Standard Model includes the electroweak theory and 
quantum chromodynamics as two independent parts. There are a number 
of candidate theories, collectively called Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), 
which attempt to unify the electroweak and strong interactions. Analysis 
shows that the strong nuclear force gets weaker with increasing energy and 
becomes comparable to the electroweak force at E &sim; 1016 GeV. Hence 
the grand unification must occur at very high energies and temperatures 
(E &sim; 1016 GeV, T &sim; 1029 K). Ultimately, gravity also needs to be unified 
with the other forces. String theory is currently the most promising frame-
work to accomplish this goal (see Chap. 19). It suggests that gravity and the 
GUT force merge at the Planck9 energy scale (E &sim; 1019 GeV, T &sim; 1032 K).
</p>
<p>In the cosmological context, as the universe cools down from the 
big bang, it goes through a series of symmetry breaking transitions (see 
Fig. 14.10). Each transition has a Higgs field associated with it; this field 
is equal to zero prior to the transition and takes a non-zero value once the 
symmetry is broken. The symmetry breaking transitions occur in rapid suc-
cession, so all four interactions become distinct within a small fraction of a 
second after the big bang.
</p>
<p>The electroweak unification and subsequent symmetry breaking are 
understood theoretically, and well tested experimentally. Unfortunately, the 
same cannot be said for GUTs. While theorists have proposed many GUTs, 
it is not so easy to test them because GUT scale energies are inaccessible 
to particle accelerators. We would need an accelerator that is 3 light years 
long&mdash;almost all the way to Alpha Centauri&mdash;to reach GUT scale energies! 
There is however hope that studies of the early universe might provide an 
observational window on GUT scale physics. As the Soviet physicist Yakov 
Zeldovich put it: &ldquo;The early universe is the poor man&rsquo;s accelerator&rdquo;.

<p>Symmetry breaking transitions in the early universe can produce a variety 
of peculiar objects, called vacuum defects, which can still be present in the 
universe today. Depending on the kind of symmetry breaking, defects can 
come in three basic types&mdash;domain walls, strings, and monopoles. Domain 
walls are surface-like defects; they are thin sheets of concentrated energy

<p>Fig. 14.10 Unification of the four forces. Today the four forces all have a sep-
arate identity, but when the universe was much hotter this was not the case. 
The weak and electromagnetic forces were once the electroweak force. Grand 
Unified Theories suggest that the electroweak and strong nuclear force were 
also once united, and split into two forces as the universe underwent symmetry 
breaking at the GUT energy scale of about 1016 GeV. In some models the GUT 
symmetry is broken in several steps; then there are some additional symmetry 
breaking transitions between the GUT and electroweak energy scales. String the-
ory seeks to explain how gravity merges with the GUT force at the Planck energy 
E &sim; 1019 GeV (T &sim; 1032 K).</p>

</p>
<p>(and mass). Strings are thread-like, with energy distributed along a line. And 
monopoles are point-like objects, like particles; their energy is concentrated 
around a single point. Different GUTs predict different kinds of defects. 
Thus, observation of vacuum defects could provide valuable information 
about particle physics at very high energies. We shall now discuss the prop-
erties of different defects and their possible observational effects. (Note: this 
section can be skipped without impacting the understanding of subsequent 
chapters.)
</p>
<p>14.6.1  Domain Walls
</p>
<p>The simplest model predicting domain walls is the one illustrated in 
Fig. 14.7.10 It has two vacuum states, separated by an energy hill. At very 
high temperatures the Higgs field is equal to zero. Then, as the universe 
cools below some critical temperature, the symmetry gets broken, and 
the field has to take one of the two vacuum values, V or &minus;V. The choice 
between the two vacua is dictated by local random fluctuations, so different 
parts of the universe end up in different vacua. The universe thus splits into 
domains having the Higgs field values V and &minus;V, as illustrated in Fig. 14.11.
</p>
<p>We can estimate the typical size of the domains, which is denoted by the 
letter ξ in the figure. If the symmetry breaking occurs at cosmic time t, this 
size cannot exceed the horizon distance dhor &sim; ct&mdash;simply because no inter-
actions could have occurred over larger distances, so a uniform value of the 
Higgs field could not be established. For an electroweak-scale symmetry 
breaking, t &sim; 10&minus;10 s and the domains must be smaller than 3 cm. For a 
GUT symmetry breaking, the domains are smaller still, by many orders of 
magnitude.
</p>
<p>Now imagine moving from a domain with the Higgs value V to one with 
the Higgs value &minus;V. By continuity, at the boundary between the domains, 
the Higgs field has to go through zero. But we know that the energy density 
of the Higgs field gets large when the field is set to zero. Hence, the bounda-
ries between positive and negative Higgs domains must carry a large energy. 
To minimize the energy cost, the regions where the Higgs field is close to 
</p>
<p>10We introduced the two-vacuum model of Fig. 14.7 to illustrate the Standard Model of particle 
physics, but we emphasize that this is just a schematic illustration. The Higgs field of the Standard 
Model has three independent components, and the vacuum structure is more complicated. In fact, the 
Standard Model does not predict any vacuum defects. If any defects are formed, they are likely to come 
from higher-energy symmetry breakings.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.6 Vacuum Defects     217
</p>
<p>zero shrink to microscopically thin sheets near the boundaries. These sheets 
are the domain walls.
</p>
<p>You can easily convince yourself that domain walls do not have edges: 
they can either be closed, completely enclosing domains of positive or nega-
tive Higgs field, or they can extend to infinity. The mass per unit wall area 
depends on the energy scale Esb of symmetry breaking. It is &sim;10
</p>
<p>9 kg/m2 for 
the electroweak scale (Esb &sim; 100 GeV) and grows proportionally to E
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>sb
 at 
</p>
<p>higher energies. Thus, for a GUT-scale symmetry breaking the walls carry a 
mammoth mass of 1051 kg/m2.
</p>
<p>Once the symmetry is broken, domains with the same value of the Higgs 
field begin to merge and grow larger. But they cannot grow faster than the 
speed of light, and thus the typical domain size will always remain smaller 
than the horizon. Applied to the present time, this implies that there should 
be at least one domain wall stretching across the presently observable region. 
Such a wall would have mass much greater than the combined mass of all 
matter in this region. The gravity of the wall would then drastically disrupt 
the observed isotropy of the galaxy distribution and of the cosmic micro-
wave background. Since no major disruptions of isotropy are observed, it 
follows that particle physics models predicting domain walls should be ruled 
out. Thus, even though we have not yet observed any vacuum defects, we 
have already learned something about high-energy particle physics.
</p>
<p>14.6.2  Cosmic Strings
</p>
<p>Thread-like string defects are predicted in a wide variety of particle physics 
models. Here is a summary of their basic properties.

ity.
</p>
<p>&bull; The thickness of strings is microscopic, while their length can be arbitrar-
ily large. So strings can be well approximated by infinitely thin lines.
</p>
<p>&bull; The mass per unit length of a string, usually denoted by &micro;, is determined 
by the symmetry breaking energy scale, &micro; &prop; E2

</p>
<p>strings, if formed, would be very light, &micro; &sim; 10&minus;7 kg/m, while GUT-scale 
strings would be extremely massive, with &micro; &sim; 1021 kg/m.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cosmic strings have a large tension, like in a stretched rubber band. This 
causes a closed loop of string to oscillate at a speed close to the speed of 
light.
</p>
<p>&bull; When strings intersect, they reconnect, resulting in the formation of 
closed loops (see Fig. 14.12).
</p>
<p>At the time of symmetry breaking, strings form a dense random network, 
consisting of long, wiggly strings and small closed loops. As for domain 
walls, the typical distance between the strings in the network cannot exceed 
the horizon. The subsequent evolution of cosmic strings is rich in physi-
cal processes. Tension in wiggly strings causes them to move at relativistic 
speeds. Moving strings intersect and chop off their wiggles in the form of 
closed loops. As a result, long strings get straighter with time. Closed loops 
oscillate and lose their energy by emitting gravitational waves. They gradu-
ally shrink and disappear.
</p>
<p>Computer simulations have revealed that cosmic string evolution has a 
scaling property: at any time the string network looks more or less the same, 
except the overall scale grows proportionally to time. So, if you took a snap-
shot of the network, say, at t = 1 s and magnified it 100 times, it would 
look very similar to a snapshot taken at t = 100 s. In particular, a horizon 
region at any time contains several long strings and a large number of closed 
loops, as shown in Fig. 14.13. This applies to the present time as well: if 
cosmic strings exist, there should be a few long strings stretching across our

gravitational effects.
</p>
<p>Strings can act as gravitational lenses - light rays propagating to us from 
a galaxy located behind the string will bend, resulting in two images of the 
same galaxy. The typical angular separation between the images is propor-
tional to the string mass per unit length &micro;; for a GUT-scale string it is a 
few arc seconds. The main difference from gravitational lensing by galaxies 
is that the two images produced by a string are expected to be nearly identi-
cal, while galactic gravitational lenses amplify and distort the images in dif-
ferent ways. Moving strings could also produce a characteristic signature in 
the CMB: the intensity of cosmic radiation would change discontinuously 
across the string. None of these effects have yet been observed.
</p>
<p>Gravitational waves emitted by oscillating loops add up to a stochas-
tic (or random) gravitational wave background with a very wide range of 
wavelengths&mdash;from microns to light years. The intensity of gravitational

</p>
<p>14.6.3  Magnetic Monopoles
</p>
<p>Monopoles are point-like defects. In many ways they are similar to ele-
mentary particles, but they have an unusual feature: each monopole car-
ries a positive (north) or negative (south) magnetic charge. In contrast, all 
magnets we are familiar with are magnetic dipoles - they always have both 
a south and a north pole. The mass of a magnetic monopole is set by the 
symmetry breaking energy scale: M &sim; Esb/c
</p>
<p>2. Thus, for a GUT monopole, 
M &sim; 10
</p>
<p>16
GeV.
</p>
<p>As with other vacuum defects, at the time of formation, we expect to have 
no less than one monopole per horizon region. But unlike other defects, 
monopoles are predicted in all GUTs. This leads to a very serious problem, 
which we will address in Chap. 15.
</p>
<p>14.7  Baryogenesis
</p>
<p>At very early times, the primordial fireball was populated by particles and 
antiparticles in almost equal amounts. But as we noted in Sect. 14.4, there 
must have been a small imbalance: particles outnumbered antiparticles by 
about one part in a billion. What was the origin of this tiny asymmetry? 
Could it have been generated by some physical process from a preceding 
state containing exactly equal amounts of matter and antimatter?
</p>
<p>One obstacle to implementing this idea is baryon number conservation. 
Protons and neutrons are collectively called baryons, and the baryon number 
B is defined as the number of baryons minus the number of antibaryons. A 
universe with equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons would have B = 0. 
To date, all observed particle processes have been found to conserve baryon 
number. If baryon number conservation is a universal law of nature, then 
B will always remain zero if it is initially zero. However, according to grand 
unified theories, the baryon number is only approximately conserved.11 
</p>
<p>11One consequence of this is that protons are not absolutely stable and can decay via processes like 
p
+
</p>
<p>&rarr; e
+
γ γ. The expected proton lifetime is much greater than the age of the universe, but proton 
</p>
<p>decay can in principle be observed by watching a huge number of protons. However, all attempts to 
observe it so far have failed and have led only to the upper bound of 1034 years on the proton lifetime.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.7 Baryogenesis     221
</p>
<p>Violations of B-conservation are extremely rare at energies that can be 
reached in accelerators, but they are expected to be very common in particle 
collisions at GUT energies. This engenders the possibility of baryogenesis&mdash;
the generation of a nonzero baryon number in the early universe.
</p>
<p>B non-conservation is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for bary-
ogenesis. If the initial state has equal numbers of particles and antiparticles, 
then the source of asymmetry must be in the laws of physics that govern 
the subsequent evolution of that state. In other words, the laws of physics 
should not be completely symmetric between matter and antimatter. In fact, 
such an asymmetry has already been observed in accelerator experiments. 
For example, the decay rates of the short-lived B0 mesons are different for 
particles and antiparticles.
</p>
<p>Yet another condition for baryogenesis is that B-violating reactions should 
be sufficiently slow, so that thermal equilibrium does not have time to estab-
lish. The reason is (roughly) that, in the absence of B-conservation, the den-
sity of each kind of particle in equilibrium is determined only by their mass. 
Since particles and antiparticles have the same mass, it follows that they have 
equal densities in equilibrium.
</p>
<p>To see how baryogenesis may occur in the absence of equilibrium, con-
sider the following scenario. Suppose some hypothetical X-particles and 
their antiparticles have asymmetric B-violating decays, so that the decay 
products of a particle and an antiparticle have a positive net baryon num-
ber. In the early fireball, the particle density is very high, so X-particles fre-
quently collide and annihilate, and particle-antiparticle pairs are frequently 
produced in collisions of photons (and other particles), so equilibrium is 
established. When the temperature drops below the X-particle mass, the 
photon energies are no longer sufficient to produce X-pairs. Also, the parti-
cle density has now significantly decreased, so the collisions between X-par-
ticles are rare and their annihilation is inefficient. The surviving X-particles 
are now out of equilibrium. They eventually decay and generate a nonzero 
baryon number.
</p>
<p>The three conditions for baryogenesis&mdash;baryon non-conservation, parti-
cle-antiparticle asymmetry in the laws of physics, and non-equilibrium&mdash;
were first formulated in 1967 by Andrei Sakharov&mdash;the Russian physicist 
who is mostly known for his role in the development of the Soviet hydrogen 
bomb and later as a prominent dissident opposing the Soviet regime. Since 
then, cosmologists have suggested a number of models where these condi-
tions are satisfied, so the observed baryon number can be generated. We 
don&rsquo;t know which, if any, of these models is correct, but most cosmologists </p>

<p>222     14 The Very Early Universe
</p>
<p>accept the general idea&mdash;that the matter excess over antimatter was gener-
ated by B-violating processes in the early universe.
</p>
<p>Summary
To understand the early universe we need to understand the physics of the 
microworld. Around one second after the big bang, the universe was a hot 
fireball of electrons, protons, neutrons, photons and neutrinos. As we go 
farther back in time, the fireball gets hotter and denser and gets populated 
with other types of particles. We now have a very successful theory, called 
the Standard Model, which accurately describes all known particles and their 
interactions. There are, however, strong indications that the Standard Model 
is not the whole story. In particular, it does not account for some properties 
of neutrinos and for the existence of new (unknown) particles that consti-
tute the dark matter.
</p>
<p>Extensions of the Standard Model are inspired by the idea that the four 
fundamental forces&mdash;gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak 
nuclear forces&mdash;are in fact different manifestations of a single, unified force. 
At very high energies distinctions between the different forces disappear; this 
is what happens at extremely high temperatures in the early universe. As the 
universe cools down, the symmetry between the forces is broken in several 
steps.
</p>
<p>Even though the cosmic symmetry breaking transitions occurred when 
the universe was only a fraction of a second old, they might have left some 
remnants, which could be present in the universe today. These include 
point-like magnetic monopoles, line-like strings, and sheet-like domain 
walls.
</p>
<p>Grand Unified Theories may be able to explain how an excess of matter 
over antimatter could have been created. GUTs predict that baryon number 
is not conserved, allowing for a nonzero baryon number to be generated in 
the early universe.

<p>The hot big bang cosmology that we have discussed so far has been a very 
successful theory. It describes cosmic evolution starting from a fraction of a 
second after the big bang, accurately predicts the primordial nuclear abun-
dances and the properties of the microwave background radiation, and 
explains how galaxies and clusters were formed over billions of years. And 
yet this theory fails to address some puzzling questions about our universe. 
Why is the geometry of the universe so close to being flat? Why is the uni-
verse so homogeneous on large scales? What is the origin of the small den-
sity fluctuations that seeded structure formation? And why is the universe 
expanding?
</p>
<p>These questions do not have answers within the big bang cosmology. It 
simply postulates that the universe started out in a state of homogeneous 
expansion and was nearly flat from the start. But it is very hard to under-
stand how such an initial state could arise, as we shall now discuss.
</p>
<p>15.1  The Flatness Problem: Why is the 
Geometry of the Universe Flat?
</p>
<p>The universe we observe today is close to having a flat, Euclidean geome-
try. This is equivalent to the statement that today the average energy density 
is nearly equal to the critical density, or that the present density parameter 
Ω0 =

<p>by no more than 1% (see Sect. 9.2). Trying to understand this major feature 
of our universe reveals a mystery, which is known as the flatness problem.
</p>
<p>If the universe starts out with � = 1, it will remain this way indefinitely. 
However, any slight initial deviation from unity will be amplified with time 
causing � to grow unchecked or plummet to zero1 (see Fig. 15.1). In other 
words, � = 1 is a point of unstable equilibrium. If, for example, we had 
Ω = 1.01 at the onset of nucleosynthesis (t = 1 s ABB), then in less than a 
minute we would have Ω = 2 and in a little over three minutes the  universe 
would collapse to a big crunch. Similarly, if we started with Ω = 0.99 at 
t = 1 s, then in about a year the density would be 300,000 times smaller 
than critical (Ω = 0.000003). No galaxies or stars would ever be formed in 
such a low-density universe. In order for Ω to have its observed value at pre-
sent, its value at t = 1 s must be set equal to one with an accuracy of one 
part in 1016 (see the Appendix).
</p>
<p>Thus the flatness problem is the realization that the universe must 
be launched with an � that is finely tuned to unity, even though the big 
bang model cannot explain why this should be the case. It simply must be 
assumed as an initial condition.
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.1 Each line shows the evolution of the density parameter starting from 
the indicated initial value. In all cases, the evolution begins at one second after 
the big bang. If � was ever slightly greater than 1 in the past, then it will grow 
toward infinity. If � was ever slightly less than 1 in the past, then it declines 
towards zero. Thus, in order for � to be close to unity today it must have started 
out extremely close to unity in the past Credit Alan Guth

<p>1This is only true if the universe expands with deceleration, which is indeed the case for the radiation 
and matter dominated epochs of the standard big bang model.</p>

<p>15.2 The Horizon Problem: Why is the Universe so Homogeneous?     229
</p>
<p>15.2  The Horizon Problem: Why is the Universe 
so Homogeneous?
</p>
<p>The near-uniformity of the CMB temperature over the sky tells us that the 
universe was extremely homogeneous at the time when the radiation was 
emitted. However, within the big bang model there is no reason why this 
ought to be the case. In fact, this ought not to be the case, unless the uni-
verse miraculously started out with very special initial conditions.
</p>
<p>At first sight, a uniform temperature may not seem very surprising. A hot 
cup of tea left on a counter gradually cools down to room temperature. The 
CMB temperature could similarly equilibrate if there was some interaction 
between neighboring regions that emit radiation. However, when the CMB 
was emitted, the time that had elapsed since the big bang was too brief for 
such an interaction to have occurred. This is known as the horizon problem.
</p>
<p>Consider the radiation coming to us from two small regions, A and B, 
which are diametrically opposite one another on the sky (see Fig. 15.2). The 
present distance to each of these regions is the distance to the surface of last 
scattering dls. Since the CMB radiation was emitted so early in the universe&rsquo;s 
history, there is not much difference between dls and the horizon distance 
dhor . Thus the present distance to regions A and B is approximately equal to 
the horizon distance, dhor &asymp; 46 Bly. The regions are therefore separated by 
twice this distance and cannot possibly interact. In particular, they cannot 
exchange heat to equalize their temperature&mdash;and yet they are observed to 
have equal temperatures, up to one part in a hundred thousand.

tures?</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>230     15 Problems with the Big Bang
</p>
<p>Since the universe is expanding, regions that are distant today must have 
been in much closer proximity in the past. This, however, does not help to 
solve the problem. In fact, the horizon problem in the early universe is even 
more severe than it is today. To understand why, let us see how the separa-
tion between the regions dAB and the horizon distance dhor vary with time. 
Firstly, let&rsquo;s simplify the discussion by assuming that the universe has been 
in the matter dominated era2 from the time the regions A and B emitted 
their radiation (at recombination) until the present. This means that their 
distance grows like the matter era scale factor dAB(t) &prop; t
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>3, and the  horizon 
distance grows as dhor(t) &prop; ct. The horizon grows faster with time than the 
distance, which implies that as we go backwards from the  present to the 
time of recombination, the horizon distance shrinks faster (see Fig. 15.3). 
It follows that if the separation distance dAB exceeds the horizon, this excess 
could only be greater at earlier times. So, if two regions are now out of 
causal contact, they could not have been in causal contact before. For exam-
ple, the regions A and B indicated in Fig. 15.2, which are now separated by 
dAB &asymp; 2dhor, were separated by approximately 80 horizon distances when 
the CMB radiation was emitted (see Question 5 at the end of this chapter). 
And at t = 1 s ABB they were separated by about 108 horizon  distances. 
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.3 Today regions A and B are separated by two horizon distances. Circles 
indicate the horizon distance from a region (black dots). As we go to earlier 
times, the regions get closer, but they are separated by an even larger number 
of horizon distances, because the horizon shrinks faster than the separation 
between the regions
</p>
<p>2We disregard the recent period of accelerated expansion due to the dark energy. If we took this into 
account, our conclusions would remain the same.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.2 The Horizon Problem: Why is the Universe so Homogeneous?     231
</p>
<p>This means that hundreds of millions of causally separated regions would 
have had to have spontaneously started out in near perfect equilibrium 
in order for the CMB sky to have the uniform temperature distribution 
observed today.
</p>
<p>Note that if one does assume such a special initial condition for the uni-
verse, then the hot big bang model is fully consistent. Neither the horizon 
nor the flatness problems are in contradiction with the big bang. They are 
problems in the sense that these remarkable features of the universe have no 
explanation within the theory.
</p>
<p>The root of the horizon problem is that the expansion of the universe 
decelerates with time, so objects that are not in causal contact today could 
never have been in causal contact before. This makes one wonder what 
would happen if the universe underwent a stage of accelerated expansion. 
In such a universe, regions which are currently not in causal contact would 
in fact have been in causal contact at earlier times (see Fig. 15.4). So there 
would be no horizon problem. Moreover, the flatness problem would disap-
pear as well! It can be shown that an accelerated expansion drives the value 
of � to one, even if initially it is significantly different from one. But what 
could cause accelerated expansion? You will have to wait until the next chap-
ter to find out.
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.4 a In a decelerating universe the slope of the curve dAB(t) decreases 
with time, while the horizon distance dH has a constant slope. Regions A and B 
can only be in causal contact if dAB &lt; dH. Initially, the universe expands so rap-
idly that dAB &gt; dH. But, because of the decreasing slope of the curve dAB(t), there 
comes a time, denoted T , when it crosses the straight line representing the hori-
zon. Once this happens, dAB &lt; dH, and thus A and B are in causal contact at all 
later times. b In an accelerating universe, regions that are not in causal contact 
today (represented by times after T ), were once in causal contact in the past 
(times earlier than T )</p>

<p>15.3  The Structure Problem: What is the Origin 
of Small Density Fluctuations?
</p>
<p>We have marveled at the degree to which the universe is homogeneous. But 
even if we somehow explain the homogeneity, how do we account for the 
cosmic structures like galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and superclusters? In the 
big bang theory we have to postulate the existence of small density fluctua-
tions, which gradually evolve into these structures. But what is the origin of 
the small initial density fluctuations?
</p>
<p>15.4  The Monopole Problem: Where Are They?
</p>
<p>As we discussed in Chap. 14, all GUT&rsquo;s predict that magnetic monopoles are 
produced during the big bang. Their initial density should be roughly one 
per horizon, which would result in a present density of about one monopole 
per cubic meter. This is comparable to the present number density of pro-
tons. But a monopole is much heavier than a proton (by a factor of 1016). 
Thus, if monopoles were present at this density, their mass would far exceed 
the total mass in atomic and dark matter, in glaring conflict with observa-
tions.3 This conundrum is known as the magnetic monopole problem.
</p>
<p>Looming behind these and other problems is an even greater mystery: 
what actually happened at the big bang? What was the nature of the pri-
mordial force that launched the expansion of the universe and sent particles 
flying away from one another? All of these questions are addressed in the 
theory of cosmic inflation, to which we next turn.
</p>
<p>Summary
The hot big bang theory is supported by a wealth of observational data, but 
it leaves unanswered some very intriguing questions about the initial state of 
the universe. For example, why is the geometry of the universe today so close 
to being flat? The flatness problem is exacerbated by the fact that geometry 
tends to veer away from flatness in the course of cosmic expansion. Hence, 
the universe had to be extremely close to flat at very early times.
</p>
<p>3Our density estimate here is for GUT monopoles, but the problem persists even if the monopoles are 
formed at a lower energy scale.</p>

<p>Then there is the horizon problem: observations of the cosmic back-
ground radiation indicate that the early fireball was homogeneous on scales 
much greater than the horizon. Since no interactions can propagate faster

<p>The horizon and flatness problems had been recognized since the 1960s, but 
were rarely discussed&mdash;simply because no one had any idea as to what to do 
about them. These problems could not be resolved without addressing the 
question of what really happened at the earliest moments of the big bang. 
With no progress in that direction, physicists grew accustomed to the notion 
that questions about the initial state of the universe belonged to philosophy, 
not physics. It therefore came as a total surprise when, in 1980, Alan Guth 
made his dramatic breakthrough, providing a way to resolve the stubborn cos-
mological puzzles in one shot.
</p>
<p>16.1  Solving the Flatness and Horizon Problems
</p>
<p>The origin of the flatness and horizon problems can be traced to the decelerated 
expansion of the universe. In a decelerating universe the density parameter � 
is driven away from one, and thus it is remarkable that it is measured to be so 
close to unity today. Also, if the expansion decelerates, the horizon grows faster 
than the separation between regions. This means that if we look backwards in 
time, the horizon shrinks faster than the separation between any two regions. 
Thus regions that are not in causal contact now, could never have been in 
causal contact at any earlier time. Both of these problems can be solved if the 
universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion in its infancy. But what 
could have caused such a period?

<p>236     16 The Theory of Cosmic Inflation
</p>
<p>You might have guessed the answer&mdash;vacuum energy! We know that the 
expansion of the universe is now accelerating, due to the repulsive gravity of the 
vacuum. However, this accelerated expansion only began at a relatively recent 
cosmic time, when the density of matter ρm dropped below the vacuum energy 
density ρv. At earlier epochs ρv was totally negligible so it could not have caused 
accelerated expansion in the early universe. What we need is a vacuum with a 
huge energy density at very early times. Fortunately, grand unified theories of 
particle physics make the existence of such high-energy vacuum states plausible. 
This led Alan Guth to propose that a large vacuum energy density caused the 
universe to undergo a period of very fast, accelerated expansion, thereby solving 
the flatness and horizon problems. Guth also suggested a fitting name for the 
accelerated expansion epoch: cosmic inflation (Fig. 16.1).

</p>
<p>Fig. 16.1 Alan Guth came up with his idea of cosmic inflation while he was in 
his 9&rsquo;th year as a temporarily employed postdoctoral fellow. Soon thereafter, he 
became a tenured Professor at MIT. For his work on inflation Guth won the 2012 
Fundamental Physics Prize. Among his other awards, he also won the 2005 con-
test for the messiest office in the Boston area (organized by the local newspaper 
The Boston Globe)</p>

<p>16.2 Cosmic Inflation     237
</p>
<p>different from nothing. At every point in space there is a Higgs field, as well 
as other scalar fields, responsible for the grand unified symmetry breaking. 
The vacuum values of these fields determine the masses and interactions of 
all elementary particles. Symmetry can generally be broken in several differ-
ent ways, and thus we expect to have a number of vacuum states with differ-
ent properties. Particle physicists refer to these states as different vacua.
</p>
<p>As an illustration, let us consider a toy &ldquo;grand unified theory&rdquo; with a sin-
gle scalar field that has a potential energy density curve shown in Fig. 16.2. 
We can represent the value of the field by a ball that rolls in this energy 
landscape and comes to rest in one of the two valleys. The valleys represent 
the two possible vacuum states in this theory. The lowest-energy vacuum is 
the absolute minimum of energy; it is called the &ldquo;true vacuum&rdquo;. Any higher-
energy vacuum is necessarily unstable; hence it is called a &ldquo;false vacuum&rdquo;. 
We know that physical systems tend to minimize their potential energy, so a 
false vacuum has to decay by converting into true vacuum. (We shall discuss 
the decay process later in this chapter.)
</p>
<p>We are now ready to formulate the idea of cosmic inflation, as it was origi-
nally proposed by Guth. Suppose the universe was in a high-energy false vac-
uum state at some early time in its history. The strong repulsive gravity of the 
false vacuum would then cause a period of very fast, accelerated expansion. This 
would solve the horizon and flatness problems of the standard big bang cosmol-
ogy. The inflationary period ends when the false vacuum decays into the true 
vacuum. The excess energy of the false vacuum has to go somewhere, and Guth 
assumed that it gets converted into a hot fireball of particles. The fireball con-
tinues to expand by inertia, and the expansion rate gradually slows down due 
to gravity. The end of inflation plays the role of the big bang in this scenario. At 
later times, the universe evolves along the lines of the hot big bang cosmology.

<p>238     16 The Theory of Cosmic Inflation
</p>
<p>How large can we expect the false vacuum energy density to be?
</p>
<p>The answer depends on the details of particle physics, but we can make an 
educated guess, using a trick called "dimensional analysis". Each particle phys-
ics model has a characteristic mass, or energy scale, which we shall denote by 
M. For the electroweak theory, this scale is M &sim; 100 GeV. The Higgs, W  and Z  
boson masses all have this order of magnitude. The electroweak symmetry 
breaking energy has a similar magnitude: electromagnetic and weak interac-
tions cannot be distinguished at particle energies much greater than 100 GeV. 
For grand unified theories the corresponding mass/energy is M &sim; 1016 GeV. This 
mass also determines the characteristic scale of the energy density landscape of 
the theory, that is, the typical height of the hills and valleys in Fig. 16.2. We can 
thus expect to have a formula expressing the false vacuum energy density ρv in 
terms of M and of the fundamental physics constants&mdash;the Planck constant � 
and the speed of light c. Now, the key point is that only one combination of M, 
� and c has the dimension of energy density; it is
</p>
<p>ρv &sim;
c5M4
</p>
<p>�3
</p>
<p>There may also be a numerical coefficient, but it usually does not change the 
order of magnitude by too much. The above formula can be rewritten as
</p>
<p>ρv &sim; 10

</p>
<p>M
4
GeV
</p>
<p>kg
</p>
<p>m3
,
</p>
<p>where MGeV is the mass M expressed in units of GeV. For a grand unified theory 
with MGeV &sim; 10
</p>
<p>16; this gives a truly enormous density of ρv &sim; 1085 kg/m3. One 
cubic centimeter of this vacuum contains much more energy than our entire 
observable universe!
</p>
<p>16.2.2  Exponential Expansion
</p>
<p>While the universe stays in the false vacuum state, the energy density remains 
constant. This leads to a very special kind of growth, called exponential expan-
sion. The hallmark of exponential expansion is that in a fixed period of time 
tD (the doubling time) the size of a given region will double (and its volume 
will therefore be increased by a factor of 23 = 8). So, if we start with one cubic 
nugget of vacuum with length l0, after one doubling time the cube will have 
size 2l0. After the next doubling time it will have size 2 &times; 2 &times; l0 = 4l0; and 
after n doubling times it will have size 2nl0. This is similar to financial inflation 
at a constant rate. A remarkable property of exponential growth is that the 
numbers get enormous after relatively few doubling cycles. For example, if a 
slice of pizza costs $1 now, then after n doubling cycles it will cost $2n: so after 
10 cycles it will cost $1024, and after 330 cycles it will cost $10100 (this much 
money does not even exist) (Fig. 16.3).

<p>A universe undergoing exponential expansion is also characterized by a 
Hubble parameter which does not change in time, H = const. This is not 
difficult to understand, if we recall that an accelerated expansion drives the 
density of the universe towards the critical value,
</p>
<p>During inflation we have ρ = ρv; then, setting ρc = ρv and solving for H, 
we obtain
</p>
<p>Any two particles in the inflating universe are driven apart with a velocity given 
by Hubble&rsquo;s law, v(t) = Hd(t), where d(t) is the distance between the parti-
cles. Let&rsquo;s say at some moment they are separated by distance d and receding 
with speed v (at any later time both the distance and velocity increase). If the 
particles were to continue separating at this speed, then the distance between 
them would double in a time interval tD = d/v = 1/H . Since the universe 
expands with acceleration, the actual doubling time is somewhat shorter, but 
the relation tD &sim; 1/H still gives a good order of magnitude estimate.1

<p>a nugget of false vacuum having the size of a proton, &sim; 10&minus;15 m, then in less 
than 10&minus;35 s the universe would inflate to a size of 1085 m. This is vastly larger 
than the size of the observable universe, which is &ldquo;only&rdquo; 1026 m. The exponential 
expansion of the false vacuum is thus an immensely powerful mechanism that 
can blow a tiny seed universe up to astronomical dimensions in a very short time.
</p>
<p>16.3  Solving the Problems of the Big Bang
</p>
<p>Let us now see how inflation helps to explain the puzzling features of the 
initial state that had to be postulated in the big bang theory.
</p>
<p>16.3.1  The Flatness Problem
</p>
<p>A period of exponential expansion drives the density parameter towards 
Ω = 1. Figure 16.4 illustrates that Ω gets extremely close to one in a rela-
tively small number of doubling times. This means that the geometry of the 
universe gets very close to flat, Euclidean geometry.
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.4 Evolution of the density parameter in an inflationary universe. Here 
we plot Ω &minus; 1 &prop; 2&minus;2n, where n is the number of doubling times (see the end of 
the appendix for derivation of this equation). Above the x-axis the curves are 
for closed universes, with different initial values of Ω; below the x-axis the 
curves are for open universes with different initial values for Ω. Even if the den-
sity parameter starts off much larger or smaller than unity, it is quickly driven to 
unity within several doubling times of inflation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16.3 Solving the Problems of the Big Bang     241
</p>
<p>This effect has a simple intuitive explanation. Imagine a curved surface, 
like a sphere. Now imagine enlarging this surface by a huge factor. This is 
what happens to the universe during inflation. We can now see only a tiny 
part of this big universe. And it appears to be flat, just like the surface of the 
Earth looks flat when we see a small portion of it (Fig. 16.5).
</p>
<p>16.3.2  The Horizon Problem
</p>
<p>Consider a spherical region of diameter d much smaller than the Hubble 
distance dH at the beginning of inflation. The region is initially expanding 
at a much smaller speed than light, so there is plenty of time for different 
parts of the sphere to interact and come to equilibrium. Then the inflation-
ary expansion blows the size of the region up by a factor 2n, where n is the 
number of doubling times during inflation. This factor can be enormous, so 
the present size of the region can easily be much larger than our observable 
universe. This solves the horizon problem: the CMB temperature is uniform 
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.5 The surface of a huge balloon looks flat, because we can see only a 
small part of it. Similarly, the universe appears to be flat because we only see a 
small portion of it after inflation</p>

</p>
<p>over the sky because all parts of the observable universe were in causal con-
tact at the beginning of inflation.
</p>
<p>What is the minimal number nmin of doubling times that is necessary to 
solve the horizon and flatness problems? The answer depends on the energy 
scale of inflation, M. For M at the GUT scale, one finds nmin is about 90.
</p>
<p>16.3.3  The Structure Formation Problem
</p>
<p>Inflation also offers the most promising explanation for the origin of small 
density fluctuations that later evolved into galaxies and clusters. We will dis-
cuss this shortly.
</p>
<p>16.3.4  The Monopole Problem
</p>
<p>All monopoles produced before or during inflation get diluted away by the 
huge inflationary expansion, so that their present density becomes negligi-
ble.
</p>
<p>16.3.5  The Expansion and High Temperature of the 
Universe
</p>
<p>The hot big bang model assumes that the universe started out in a state of 
rapid expansion at a very high temperature. But why was the early universe 
so hot? And why was it expanding? Inflation provides a possible explanation 
for this initial state. The expansion of the universe is caused by the repulsive 
gravity of the false vacuum. The vacuum energy density during inflation is 
expected to be very high, and when the false vacuum decays, this energy gets 
converted into a hot fireball of particles and radiation; hence the fireball is 
born with a very high temperature.
</p>
<p>We thus see that a period of inflation in the early universe can resolve 
the perplexing problems of the big bang. But in order for the inflationary 
model to be complete, we need to understand how inflation begins and how 
it ends. Inflation ends when the false vacuum decays, so in the next section 
we shall study the vacuum decay process. The question of the beginning of 
inflation will be addressed in Chap. 23.</p>

</p>
<p>16.4  Vacuum Decay
</p>
<p>16.4.1  Boiling of the Vacuum
</p>
<p>Consider the energy landscape of a scalar field illustrated in Fig. 16.6. It has 
a false vacuum and a true vacuum. During inflation the field is in the false 
vacuum everywhere in space. Now, in order for the false vacuum to decay, 
the field has to overcome the energy barrier separating the two vacua. As we 
discussed earlier, the dynamics of the scalar field is similar to that of a ball 
rolling in the energy landscape. If the ball is located in the valley marked 
&ldquo;false vacuum&rdquo;, then, according to classical physics, it will stay there forever, 
unless someone kicks it upwards, providing the energy needed to go over the 
barrier. But we learned in Chap. 10 that the ball can quantum-mechanically 
tunnel through the barrier and emerge on the other side. This is also what 
happens in vacuum decay.
</p>
<p>Quantum tunneling is a probabilistic process, so you cannot predict 
exactly when and where it is going to happen. You can only calculate the 
probability for tunneling to occur in a given region of space per interval 
of time. The probability for a large region of false vacuum to tunnel to the 
true vacuum is extremely low. Thus tunneling occurs in a tiny microscopic 
region, resulting in a small true vacuum bubble.2
</p>
<p>The process of vacuum decay is similar to the boiling of water. Small bub-
bles of true vacuum pop out (or &ldquo;nucleate&rdquo;) randomly in the midst of false

<p>2Despite the similarity between the tunneling of a ball and that of a scalar field, there is also an impor-
tant difference. The ball tunnels between two different points in space, while the field tunnels between 
two different field values at the same location in space.</p>

<p>vacuum. The energy released by converting false vacuum into true vacuum 
gets concentrated in the bubble walls, which expand at a speed approaching 
the speed of light. When bubbles collide and merge, the walls disintegrate 
into particles. This is how Guth originally envisioned the end of inflation 
and the onset of the big bang. But unfortunately this broad-brush scenario 
has a fatal flaw.
</p>
<p>16.4.2  Graceful Exit Problem
</p>
<p>The problem is that even though the bubbles expand at nearly the speed of 
light, we cannot simply assume they will collide, because the space between 
them is filled with false vacuum and is also rapidly expanding. In fact, any 
bubbles separated by more than a Hubble distance dH are driven apart faster 
than the speed of light and will never collide. The typical distance between 
the bubbles depends on the rate at which they nucleate. If the nucleation 
rate is low, then bubbles will form separated by wide stretches of false vac-
uum and will almost never collide. All the energy of the bubbles will remain 
concentrated in the expanding bubble walls, and inflation will never end 
(Fig. 16.7).
</p>
<p>To get around this problem, we can consider a model where bubbles 
nucleate at a very high rate, so that their typical separation is less than dH. 
In this case the bubbles will collide and merge, and the whole vacuum decay 
process will be over in less than a doubling time. But in order to solve the

<p>horizon and flatness problems we need inflation to persist for many dou-
bling times (roughly 90 or so, depending on the details of the model). Thus 
we are faced with an impasse: either inflation does not end at all, or it ends 
too rapidly to solve the problems it was invented to solve. In the early 80&rsquo;s 
this became known as the graceful exit problem. Guth realized that his theory 
suffered from this problem soon after he came up with the idea of inflation, 
so he concluded his landmark paper stating: &ldquo;I am publishing this paper in 
the hope that it will encourage others to find some way to avoid the undesir-
able features of the inflationary scenario.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>16.4.3  Slow Roll Inflation
</p>
<p>The Russian born cosmologist Andrei Linde was the first to find a solution 
to the graceful exit problem in 1982. A few months later the same idea was 
independently proposed by Andreas Albrecht and Paul Steinhardt in the 
USA. The crucial step was to consider an energy landscape without a bar-
rier, but with a very gentle slope, as shown in Fig. 16.8. Once again, we can 
represent the scalar field by a ball rolling in this landscape. If we place the 
ball near the top of the hill, it will start slowly rolling down, and since the 
slope is so flat, the ball will initially stay at about the same height. For the 
scalar field this means that its energy density will remain almost constant. 
But a constant energy density is all that is needed to sustain a constant rate 
of inflation.
</p>
<p>The flat region near the hilltop can be called a &ldquo;false vacuum&rdquo;. Since the 
field &ldquo;rolls&rdquo; very slowly, it takes a while for it to cross that region, and in 
the meantime the universe expands exponentially. Once the field reaches the

<p>true vacuum, it oscillates back and forth and eventually comes to rest, with 
its energy turned into a hot fireball of particles.3 By this time the universe 
has expanded by a huge factor.
</p>
<p>Note that in this model, the field &ldquo;rolls&rdquo; simultaneously at all points in 
space and produces a fireball at the same time in the entire inflating region. 
We thus have a large, hot, homogeneous, expanding universe. The graceful 
exit problem has been solved! (Fig. 16.9).
</p>
<p>Like the Higgs field of the Standard Model, the rolling scalar field must 
have some particle associated with it. Particle physicists have suggested a 
number of candidates, but none of them is particularly compelling. For now, 
the particle goes by the generic name &ldquo;inflaton&rdquo;, and the field is called the 
&ldquo;inflaton field&rdquo;.

</p>
<p>3A ball rolling on a similarly curved surface would also oscillate about the lowest point, would gradu-
ally slow down due to friction, and would come to rest, with all its mechanical energy turned into heat. 
Similarly, analysis shows that an oscillating field loses its energy by particle production, creating a fireball.</p>

<p>16.5 Origin of Small Density Fluctuations     247
</p>
<p>16.5  Origin of Small Density Fluctuations
</p>
<p>As we discussed in Chap. 12, galaxies and galaxy clusters arise from gravita-
tional collapse in a universe that begins with small density variations from one 
location to the next. But where do these initial density variations come from?
</p>
<p>If inflation gives us a perfectly homogeneous universe, then it works too 
well. Russian physicists Viatcheslav Mukhanov and Gennady Chibisov pro-
posed in 1981 that density fluctuations in the early universe could arise due 
to random quantum fluctuations. This means that quantum effects, which 
are usually only important in the microworld, could be ultimately responsi-
ble for the existence of the largest structures in the universe! (Fig. 16.10).
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this is possible. In addition to classical motion, the inflaton 
field is subject to quantum mechanical effects (see Fig. 16.11). As the field rolls 
downhill, it experiences quantum fluctuations, which randomly kick the field 
up or down the hill. The directions of these small kicks are not the same in dif-
ferent spatial regions of the universe. Thus the field arrives at the bottom of the 
hill and produces a fireball at different times in different spatial locations.
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.10 Viatcheslav Mukhanov suggested (with Chibisov) that cosmologi-
cal density fluctuations could have a quantum origin and later did seminal work 
developing the details of this scenario. He is known among cosmologists for his 
flamboyant personality and politically incorrect sense of humor. Credit PR Image

<p>248     16 The Theory of Cosmic Inflation
</p>
<p>In regions where the field took a little longer to reach the true vacuum, 
inflation lasts a bit longer, and the matter density will be slightly higher. 
Why? Because during inflation, the energy density stays roughly constant 
even as the universe expands. But once the fireball is produced, matter and 
radiation get diluted. So parts of the universe that exit the inflating stage 
sooner, get a bit diluted by the time nearby lagging regions start their hot 
big bang evolution. The upshot of inflation ending at slightly different times 
is that the very early universe is imbued with small differences in density 
from one region to another. These are the density fluctuations that could be 
responsible for the formation of cosmic structure (Fig. 16.12).
</p>
<p>All density fluctuations originate as quantum kicks in tiny regions which 
have a size roughly given by the Hubble distance dH.4 But then they are 
stretched by the expansion to a much greater size. Fluctuations produced 
earlier are stretched for a longer time and encompass a larger region. The 
magnitude of fluctuations is set by the initial quantum kick and is about the 
same for all distance scales. This leads to a scale-invariant spectrum of den-
sity fluctuations.
</p>
<p>To clarify what a scale invariant spectrum means, imagine that we divide 
the universe into cubic regions of size 100 light years and measure the aver-

and down the hill
</p>
<p>4Quantum fluctuations occur on smaller scales as well, but upward and downward kicks alternate in 
rapid succession, so their overall effect is nil. But once the fluctuation region is stretched to a size larger 
than dH, its different parts become causally disconnected, and coherent fluctuations in such a region are 
no longer possible. The surviving fluctuations are the ones produced in regions of size &sim; dH. The region 
is then immediately stretched to a larger size, and the fluctuation &ldquo;freezes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>age density in each cube. Let&rsquo;s say we find the density fluctuation (that is, the 
typical variation from one cube to another) to be 1%. Now we can repeat this 
experiment with cubic regions of different size (say, 1000 light years, 10 light 
years, etc.). If the density fluctuation is the same for any choice of the size, we 
say that the spectrum of density fluctuations is scale invariant.
</p>
<p>The scale invariance of density fluctuations from inflation is only approxi-
mate. The magnitude of quantum kicks decreases slightly as the field rolls 
downhill. As a result, the density fluctuations on greater distance scales, 
which were produced when the field was at a higher altitude, are slightly 
larger than the smaller-scale fluctuations. The form of the spectrum of pri-
mordial density fluctuations is one of the most important observational pre-
dictions of inflation, as we will discuss in Chap. 17.

<p>speed v = Hd, where d is the distance between them. Suppose the observ-
ers begin their signal exchange when d is very small, so that the separation 
speed v is small compared to the speed of light. Then the Hubble expansion 
has almost no effect on light propagation between the observers, and they 
can exchange many signals before their distance is appreciably enlarged. But 
as the observers move apart, their separation speed gradually increases and 
becomes equal to the speed of light at the Hubble distance
</p>
<p>When d gets close to dH, light signals take longer and longer to propagate 
and arrive more and more redshifted. Once d becomes greater than dH, any 
communication between the observers becomes impossible, since they are 
now moving apart faster than the speed of light. At later times v will get 
only larger, so light signals sent by one observer will never catch up with the 
other one. We thus see that comoving observers who are in causal contact in 
an inflating universe will necessarily fall out of causal contact at later times 
(assuming that inflation continues).
</p>
<p>A spherical surface of radius dH surrounding an observer is called the 
observer&rsquo;s Hubble sphere; its properties in an exponentially expanding uni-
verse are similar to those of the Schwarzschild horizon of a black hole. Events 
that occur beyond the Hubble sphere cannot be detected by the observer. 
For GUT-scale inflation, the Hubble distance is tiny, dH &sim; 10
</p>
<p>&minus;30
m, hardly 
</p>
<p>enough to contain an observer. But note that today our universe is vacuum-
dominated and is once again undergoing a stage of exponential expansion. 
The present vacuum energy density is much lower than it was in the early 
inflationary phase, and the Hubble distance is now astronomically large: 
dH &sim; 10
</p>
<p>10 ly. Galaxies in the observable universe are driven towards dH. As 
they approach the Hubble sphere, they become more and more redshifted 
and gradually fade away.

<p>16.6.2  Energy Conservation
</p>
<p>A short period of inflation can blow a tiny subatomic-size region up to 
dimensions much greater than the entire observable universe. On the face 
of it, this seems to be in conflict with energy conservation. The false vacuum 
has a constant energy density ρv, so its energy is proportional to the volume 
V  that it occupies, Ev = ρvV . At the end of inflation the volume is enor-

</p>
<p>mous, and so is the energy. The question is: where did all this energy come 
from?
</p>
<p>To see what is going on here, let us first note that the total energy must 
include the contribution of the gravitational potential energy. Furthermore, 
let us recall that the gravitational energy is always negative and that it also 
gets large when the mass is large. Hence it is conceivable that as the mass/
energy of the false vacuum grows during inflation, its negative gravitational 
energy grows at the same rate, so the total energy remains constant.
</p>
<p>An analogous situation arises in Newtonian theory when a small particle 
falls towards a massive star of mass M. The energy of the particle in this case is
</p>
<p>where m is the particle&rsquo;s mass, v is its velocity, and r is its distance from the 
center of the star. The first term is the particle&rsquo;s kinetic energy and the second is 
the gravitational potential energy. Suppose the particle is initially at rest (v = 0) 
at a large distance from the star, so the energy is very small. As it falls, the parti-
cle accelerates, and its kinetic energy can get very large as it approaches the star. 
On the other hand, as r gets smaller, the potential energy gets large and nega-
tive. But the two contributions nearly cancel one another, so the total energy is 
conserved and is close to zero, as it was from the start.
</p>
<p>A detailed analysis, based on general relativity, shows that the energetics 
of cosmic inflation is very similar. The total energy of the huge false vacuum 
region at the end of inflation is very tiny; it is the same as the energy of the 
initial nugget from which this volume originated.
</p>
<p>Summary
The horizon and flatness problems can be solved if the universe underwent 
a period of accelerated expansion, called inflation. The theory of inflation 
assumes that the universe originated in a state of a high-energy false vacuum. 
The repulsive gravity of that vacuum causes a super-fast, exponential expan-
sion of the universe. Regardless of its initial size, the universe very quickly 
becomes huge. The false vacuum eventually decays, producing a hot fireball, 
marking the end of inflation. The fireball continues to expand by inertia and 
evolves along the lines of hot big bang cosmology. Decay of the false vacuum 
plays the role of the big bang in this scenario.

<p>The theory of inflation explains the expansion of the universe (it is due to 
the repulsive gravity of the false vacuum), its high temperature (due to the high 
energy density of the false vacuum), and its observed  homogeneity (false vacuum 
has an almost constant energy density). It also predicts a nearly scale invariant 
spectrum of density fluctuations, which can serve as seeds for structure formation.

<p>We have seen how cosmic inflation can create an enormous universe from a 
tiny seed, while solving many problems that plagued pre-inflation models. 
Most cosmologists have embraced the inflationary scenario, but how can we 
know that inflation actually happened? Fortunately, the theory of inflation 
has made several testable predictions, three of which we now discuss.
</p>
<p>17.1  Flatness
</p>
<p>As we learned in the previous chapter, accelerated expansion during inflation 
rapidly drives the density parameter towards Ω = 1 and the geometry of the 
universe to flatness. Thus, inflation predicts that, on the largest observable 
scales, the universe should be accurately described by a flat geometry with 
� = 1. When Alan Guth made this prediction in the early 80&rsquo;s, astronomers 
viewed it with a high degree of skepticism. All the evidence at that time 
pointed to an open hyperbolic universe. Even including dark matter, obser-
vation favored �m &sim; 0.3.
</p>
<p>Then, quite unexpectedly, nearly 20 years after Guth&rsquo;s prediction, dark 
energy was discovered. Today we know from CMB and supernovae measure-
ments that its contribution to the cosmic energy balance is �vac &asymp; 0.69, so

</p>
<p>The universe is thus very close to being flat, in excellent agreement with the 
inflationary prediction.
</p>
<p>17.2  Density Fluctuations
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive triumph of inflation has been the explanation 
of primordial density fluctuations. The theory of inflation specifically pre-
dicts that the magnitude of fluctuations is about the same for all observable 
distance scales: the initial density fluctuations have a scale-invariant spec-
trum. Also, the different components of the early universe&mdash;dark matter, 
electrons, protons and photons&mdash;all start out with the same density per-
turbations. Thus, regions that have an initial over-density of photons, say, 
by 0.01%, also have a 0.01% initial over-density of dark matter, and so on. 
(However, as we shall soon see, the dark matter does not evolve in tandem 
with the other components during times of interest in this chapter.)
</p>
<p>To test this prediction, cosmologists used a computer code to follow the 
evolution of scale-invariant fluctuations up until recombination. The result-
ing pattern of evolved density fluctuations was then converted into a pattern 
of temperature anisotropies, and these were compared to the CMB obser-
vations. The agreement between theory and experiment, as most accurately 
measured by the Planck satellite (see Fig. 17.1), is striking.1
</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the CMB temperature anisotropies depicted in 
Fig. 17.1 in more detail. The horizon distance at recombination corresponds 
to about 1.5◦ on the sky (see Question 9). Matter could not have moved 
over distances exceeding the horizon, and thus on angular scales significantly 
larger than 1.5◦ the temperature anisotropies represent the density fluctua-
tions in their pristine form, as they came out of the inflationary epoch. As 
expected, the magnitude of the anisotropies, and hence the density fluctua-
tions, is about the same for all angles in this range.
</p>
<p>Photons that propagate to us from higher density regions start out a lit-
tle hotter than average, and those that travel towards us from less dense 
regions are initially cooler than average. On the other hand, photons from 
denser regions lose more energy as they climb out of stronger gravitational 
fields produced by those regions. This gravitational redshift turns out to be 
the dominant effect, so the net result is that, surprisingly, hot patches in 
</p>
<p>1Recall, the scale invariance of density fluctuations from inflation is only approximate: fluctuations on 
greater distance scales are slightly larger than the smaller-scale fluctuations. The experimental data are 
consistent with these details.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the CMB sky indicate under-dense, cooler regions in the early universe at 
recombination.
</p>
<p>On angular scales of about 1◦ and smaller, the data in Fig. 17.1 exhibit 
a number of peaks. These peaks are signatures of primordial sound waves, 
as we shall now explain. Prior to recombination, protons, electrons and 
photons are tightly coupled together by electromagnetic forces and act as a 
single proton-electron-photon gas. Such a mixture of charged particles and 
radiation is called a plasma. In denser regions the plasma has a higher tem-
perature and a higher pressure. The difference in pressure pushes the plasma 
into neighboring low-density regions. The pressure momentarily equalizes, 
but the plasma keeps moving by inertia, so the regions that were initially 
hotter and denser become cooler and vice versa. Now the pressure difference 
works in the opposite direction and the plasma rushes back to the initially 
over-dense regions. The resulting oscillations of compression and rarefica-
tion are simply sound waves in the primordial plasma. Dark matter parti-
cles interact very weakly with ordinary matter, so they do not participate in 
plasma oscillations.
</p>
<p>Like sound waves in the air, the plasma sound waves are characterized by 
an oscillation period P and a wavelength �, equal to the distance traveled by 
sound in one period. The wavelength of the plasma waves is determined by 
the size of the over-dense and under-dense regions. Since these regions come 
in a variety of sizes, many different waves are &ldquo;sounding&rdquo; at the same time. 
The speed of sound vs in a gas is comparable to the typical particle velocity.

</p>
<p>The cosmic plasma consists predominantly of photons, so vs is not much 
different from the speed of light: vs &asymp; 0.6c. When charged particles even-
tually recombine to form neutral atoms, the oscillations stop, and photons 
stream freely through the universe, bringing us the pattern of primordial 
sound, frozen in time at recombination.
</p>
<p>The waves that reach their maximum amplitude at trec contribute the 
most to the observed temperature fluctuations. The longest waves of this 
kind have period 2trec. Their wavelength �f  is called the fundamental wave-
length. A simple calculation shows that �f &asymp; 1.4 &times; 10
</p>
<p>6lyrs (see Question 
10). By the time of recombination, such a wave completes half a period of 
oscillation, so a region that started out at maximal rarefication after inflation 
will have reached maximal compression at trec, and vice versa. The highest 
peak in Fig. 17.1 is generated by sound waves with the fundamental wave-
length. Other peaks come from sound waves having wavelengths that are 
integer fractions of �f . The second peak is due to waves with half the funda-
mental wavelength. In this case, a maximally rarefied region has had time to 
reach maximum compression and then rebound, again becoming maximally 
rarified by the time of recombination. The third peak is due to a sound wave 
with a third of the fundamental wavelength, and so on. It is also evident in 
the figure that peaks at smaller angular scales drop off in magnitude. This is 
due to the dissipation of sound waves.
</p>
<p>Mining the CMB
</p>
<p>There is much that can be learned about our universe from the CMB anisotro-
pies. The angle of the fundamental peak in Fig. 17.1 allows cosmologists to 
directly measure the curvature of the universe. This angle (approximately 1◦) 
gives us the angular size of the most intense temperature variations on the sky.
</p>
<p>It is the angle subtended by half of the fundamental wavelength �f  (because 
the full wavelength includes both a cold and a hot patch). Since we know both 
the distance from us to the surface of last scattering (this distance is very close 
to the horizon distance; see Sect. 7.7.) and the physical size of �f , cosmologists 
can determine if the observed angle is consistent with a flat, open or closed 
geometry (see Fig. 17.2). It turns out that to a very high accuracy, the universe 
is flat, in full agreement with the measurements of the energy density of the 
universe.
</p>
<p>As we already mentioned, on large angular scales the temperature fluctua-
tions in the plasma and the gravitational redshift work in opposite directions, 
so the observed fluctuations are due to the difference between the two effects. 
On the other hand, in the fundamental peak, the hot and cold plasma regions 
switch places, while the high and low density dark matter regions do not move. 
As a result the plasma temperature fluctuations and the gravitational redshift 
due to dark matter are now added together. This is why the first peak is so 
high. In the second peak the two effects are again opposite. By comparing the </p>

<p>heights of the first and second peaks, cosmologists have been able to deter-
mine the relative amounts of atomic and dark matter. The results are perfectly 
consistent with calculations based on nucleosynthesis. Such consistency checks 
provide reassurance that our understanding of the early universe is on the right 
track.
</p>
<p>The prediction of a scale invariant primordial spectrum is one of inflation&rsquo;s 
most important features. In addition to the CMB data which favor inflation, 
numerical simulations have been very successful in reproducing observations 
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.2 CMB measurements show that the universe is flat. In the top figures, 
the solid green lines represent the physical size of the fundamental wavelength 
and the blue lines represent light propagation in closed, flat and open universes. 
The fundamental wavelength and the light rays emanating from its two ends 
form a giant triangle in space (as discussed in Chap. 4, the sum of angles in a tri-
angle can be more than or less than 180◦ depending on the geometry of space). 
The black dotted lines indicate the angle subtended by the fundamental wave-
length for each geometry. In a closed universe the fundamental wavelength 
subtends a larger angle than in flat space, and thus hot and cold spots would 
appear larger, as shown in the simulated CMB data in part (a). In an open uni-
verse the fundamental wavelength subtends a smaller angle than in flat space, 
and thus hot and cold spots would appear to be smaller, as shown in the CMB 
simulation in part (c). The actual CMB data in part (b) is consistent with a flat 
universe. Credit NASA

scale-invariant spectrum (see Chap. 12). 
</p>
<p>17.3  Gravitational Waves
</p>
<p>Another key prediction is that the tumultuous epoch of inflation gen-
erated gravitational waves that should also have a scale invariant spec-
trum (Fig. 17.3). As we discussed in Chap. 4, Einstein predicted the 
existence of gravitational waves nearly one hundred years ago. Gravitational 
waves can be detected because they stretch and squeeze space as they pass 
through it (without changing the volume), and this can cause distances 
between objects to change (see Fig. 17.4). However, this is a miniscule 
effect: for example, if a gravitational wave produced by a close pair of neu-
tron stars rotating about one another were to pass between you and your 
friend on the other side of the room, the distance between you would be 
altered by less than the size of a proton! Although extremely challenging, 
gravitational waves from astrophysical sources have been recently detected 
(as discussed in Chap. 4).

gravitational waves would be generated during an inflationary period. He did

sion of inflation. Credit PR Image iau1304b, Alexei Starobinsky, recipient of the

<p>The origin of gravitational waves from inflation is similar to that of the 
primordial density fluctuations. The waves are produced by quantum fluc-
tuations in the geometry of space and time. They originate in tiny regions of 
the Hubble size dH, and then their wavelengths are stretched to astronomical 
sizes by the rapid inflationary expansion. The magnitude of the fluctuations 
is set by the Hubble parameter H, which is in turn determined by the false 
vacuum energy density [see Eq. (16.2)]. Since H remains nearly constant 
during inflation, the amplitude of gravitational waves is about the same for 
all wavelengths. In other words, the predicted gravitational wave spectrum is 
scale invariant.
</p>
<p>Once created, primordial gravitational waves propagate through the 
universe. The predicted amplitude of the waves is too small to be directly 
detected with instruments like LIGO. However, primordial gravitational 
waves are expected to leave an imprint on the CMB radiation, both by 
impacting temperature fluctuations and by causing specific polarization pat-
terns.
</p>
<p>The reason gravitational waves can cause temperature fluctuations is 
because as the waves pass through the plasma at recombination, in some 
spots they stretch the plasma in our direction&mdash;that is, in the direction 
where our galaxy will eventually emerge, causing photons from those regions 
to be somewhat blue-shifted and thus hotter. In other spots the gravitational 
waves cause regions of plasma to be compressed away from us, and such 
regions appear red-shifted and thus cooler. It is difficult, however, to distin-
guish these temperature variations from those caused by primordial density 
fluctuations. But the polarization patterns induced by gravitational waves 
have a unique signal.
</p>
<p>When photons scatter off electrons in the cosmic plasma, they get polar-
ized&mdash;which means that the electric field of the photon gets oriented in a 
certain way (determined by the direction of motion of the incoming and 
scattered photons). With a large number of photons undergoing multiple

<p>scatterings, there is no net polarization. But at the epoch of recombination, 
just before the universe became transparent to radiation, the CMB photons 
scattered for the last time. The photons that we see come mostly from denser 
plasma regions, and we can see only photons that scattered in our direc-
tion. As a result, the observed CMB radiation is polarized (see Fig. 17.5). 
Primordial density fluctuations produce an E-mode pattern, consisting of 
radial and ring-like structures (see Fig. 17.6). In addition to E-modes, polar-
ization caused by gravitational waves displays a swirl-like pattern that can be 
clockwise or anticlockwise; such patterns are called B-modes.
</p>
<p>Many collaborations around the world have been searching for traces 
of primordial B-mode polarization. In March 2014, the BICEP 2 team2 
announced that they had found a pattern of polarization that is consist-
ent with gravitational waves from inflation (see Fig. 17.7). Unfortunately,

<p>waves soon. The stakes are very high, for two main reasons: Firstly, inflation 
predicts that the amplitude of the gravitational waves is proportional to the 
energy scale at which inflation takes place. Thus, if we can measure the mag-
nitude of gravitational wave perturbations, we stand to learn about the phys-
ics behind inflation and about physics at energies that are far too high to be 
studied in accelerators. And secondly, these gravitational waves are thought 
to be produced via quantum mechanical effects, thus their existence could 
shed light on the unification of gravity and quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>17.4  Open Questions
</p>
<p>The theory of inflation explains many puzzling features of the big bang and 
makes observational predictions that have been beautifully confirmed by the 
data. We thus have good reasons to believe that a period of accelerated infla-
tionary expansion did occur in the early universe. This does not mean, how-
ever, that the problem of the origin of the universe has been solved.
</p>
<p>First, we should emphasize that inflation is not a specific model, like the 
Standard Model of particle physics, but rather a paradigm encompass-
ing a wide class of models. The main differences between the models are in 
the choice of the inflaton potential energy landscape. Linde&rsquo;s 1982 model 
assumed an energy hill with a flat hilltop, as illustrated in Fig. 16.8. A few 
years later, Linde proposed another model, where the energy hill keeps rising 
without limit in both directions (Fig. 17.8). Such a &ldquo;topless&rdquo; hill has a true 
vacuum at the bottom and no definite location for the false vacuum. The role 
of the false vacuum can be played by some point on the slope, where the infla-
ton field starts its downward roll. If the slope is sufficiently gentle, the field 
will roll slowly, and inflation will occur. Yet another possibility is a hybrid of

<p>Linde&rsquo;s hilltop model with Guth&rsquo;s original scenario (we shall discuss this in 
more detail in Chap. 18). Cosmologists have also studied models of inflation 
including several scalar fields and models where the inflaton field is incorpo-
rated in a particular particle physics theory.3
</p>
<p>Despite the variety of models, the predictions of inflation are rather 
robust. All models predict a nearly flat universe and an almost scale-invari-
ant spectrum of density fluctuations. There are, however, some differences in 
the details. For example, the predicted small deviations from scale invariance 
are different for different models. The Planck satellite observations disfavor 
the &ldquo;topless&rdquo; models of Fig. 17.8, and as the empirical data continue to pour 
in, we can expect a further reduction in the number of viable models.
</p>
<p>Even if we converge on a single model of inflation, that will not be the 
end of the story. All models assume that at the onset of inflation the universe 
was in a state of false vacuum. Why was it so? Only a tiny nugget of false 
vacuum is required, but even a small initial nugget calls for an explanation. 
Where did it come from? We shall discuss this and other questions raised by 
the theory of inflation in subsequent chapters.
</p>
<p>Summary
Inflation makes several predictions, three of which we discussed here:
</p>
<p>The universe is flat on the largest observable scales; density fluctuations 
have a nearly scale-invariant spectrum; and a scale-invariant spectrum of 
gravitational waves should also be present. The first two predictions have 
been observationally confirmed and the search for primordial gravity waves 
is currently underway. The idea of inflation appears to be on the right track 
and has by now become the leading cosmological paradigm.
</p>
<p>Questions
 1.  Why was the discovery of dark energy such a boost for the theory of 
</p>
<p>inflation?
 2. Why are CMB temperature anisotropies so important?
</p>
<p>3Alexei Starobinsky suggested a model of inflation without scalar fields. In this model, the accelerated 
expansion of the universe is due to a quantum modification of Einstein&rsquo;s equations. Starobinsky intro-
duced his model in 1979, before Guth published his first paper on inflation. But he did not realize that 
an accelerated expansion period explains the puzzling features of the big bang, so Guth is generally 
credited with the idea of inflation.

<p>Inflation enlarges the size of the universe by an enormous factor, so we can 
observe only a tiny part of it. The theory explains very well what we see in 
this small domain, but it also makes predictions about the parts of the uni-
verse that we cannot see&mdash;beyond our cosmic horizon. This has led to a radi-
cal revision of our global view of the universe.
</p>
<p>18.1  Volume Growth and Decay
</p>
<p>In very general terms, the new worldview can be understood as follows. 
An inflating universe is governed by two competing processes: exponen-
tial growth of false vacuum volume and the decay of false vacuum. This is 
similar to the reproduction of bacteria which multiply by division and are 
destroyed by antibodies. The outcome depends on which process is more 
efficient. If the bacteria are destroyed faster than they reproduce, they will 
quickly die out. Alternatively, if the reproduction is faster, bacteria will rap-
idly proliferate. In most models of inflation, the rate of volume expansion 
is much higher than that of false vacuum decay. This means that expansion 
wins, and the total volume of inflating regions grows with time.
</p>
<p>False vacuum decay is induced by probabilistic quantum processes, so it 
happens in random locations at random times. The result is a stochastic patch-
work of true and false vacuum regions. In Fig. 18.1 we illustrate the dynamics 
schematically, using a simple 2D model. We start with a false vacuum region, 
shown as a white square in the first frame of the figure. The following three

</p>
<p>frames show the same region after three consecutive doubling times. To avoid 
running out of space in the figure, we use &ldquo;comoving coordinates&rdquo;, factoring 
out the expansion of the universe, so all four &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; of the region have 
the same apparent size. In the second frame, the size of the region has dou-
bled, and its area has quadrupled, so it now contains four squares of the same 
physical size as the original one. We assume that false vacuum has decayed 
into true vacuum in one of the squares, indicated by grey shading. In the third 
frame, the size of false vacuum regions has doubled again, and one quarter 
of the false vacuum regions have been converted into true vacuum. The same 
scenario plays out in the fourth frame.
</p>
<p>This simple algorithm can be repeated any number of times. At each time 
step, the false vacuum area is quadrupled, and one quarter of it is lost to 
decay. The resulting change in the amount of false vacuum is by a factor of 
4 &times;
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>4
= 3. After N steps this amount will grow by a factor of 3N. Thus the 
</p>
<p>expansion of false vacuum more than makes up for its loss due to vacuum 
decay.
</p>
<p>If false vacuum regions multiply faster than they decay, inflation never 
ends in the entire universe. Even though it ended in our local region, it 
still continues in remote parts of the universe, producing new true vacuum 
regions like ours. This never ending process is called eternal inflation.
</p>
<p>Fractals
</p>
<p>The pattern of true and false vacuum regions obtained by repeated application 
of the algorithm in Fig. 18.1 is an example of what mathematicians call a self-
similar fractal. &rdquo;Self-similar&rdquo; refers to the fact that the pattern is statistically 
the same on every distance scale. If, for example, we pick a small white square 
in the last frame, representing a false vacuum region, its subsequent evolution 
will be essentially the same as that of the initial white square in the first frame. 
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.1 The area of the false vacuum quadruples and one out of four newly 
created regions immediately decays to the true vacuum state at each time 
step (from left to right). True vacuum regions are indicated by grey shading. 
The smallest squares in each frame have the same physical size, but appear to 
decrease with time, because the expansion factor is taken out</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The evolution will not be exactly the same, because there is an element of ran-
domness in the algorithm. But after many steps the statistical properties of the 
regions will be very similar.
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;fractal&rdquo; refers to the fact that the inflating part of space in this 
model has, in a certain sense, a fractional dimension. If you double the size of a 
one-dimensional line, its length will increase by a factor of 2. If you double the 
size of a 2D figure, its area will increase by a factor of 22 = 4. And if you double 
the size of a 3D body, its volume will increase by a factor of 23 = 8. In general, 
when the size of a d-dimensional object is doubled, the amount of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in 
the object is increased by a factor of 2d. Now, in the model of Fig. 18.1, the 
area of the inflating part of space grows by a factor of 3 in one doubling time. 
This is between 21 = 2 and 22 = 4, suggesting that the fractal dimension of the 
inflating region is between 1 and 2. To find the exact dimension, we have to 
solve the equation 2d = 3. The solution is d = log23 = 1.58.
</p>
<p>The eternal nature of inflation was first recognized by Vilenkin in 1983, 
soon after Guth proposed his theory of cosmic inflation, and was later inves-
tigated by a number of physicists, most notably by Linde. Inflation is eternal 
in nearly all models that have been studied so far. It is possible to construct 
non-eternal models, but they require rather contrived potential energy land-
scapes for the inflaton scalar field.
</p>
<p>The simple model of Fig. 18.1 captures only rough features of an eternally 
inflating universe on very large distance scales; the details depend on the 
specific mechanism of false vacuum decay. There are two such mechanisms 
to consider: quantum random walk and bubble nucleation. We shall now 
discuss them in turn.
</p>
<p>18.2  Random Walk of the Inflaton Field
</p>
<p>As we discussed in Chap. 16, small density fluctuations are generated during 
inflation, because the inflaton scalar field is subjected to random quantum 
kicks as it rolls down the potential energy hill (see Fig. 18.2). While the field 
is rolling downwards, the quantum kicks are much weaker than the force 
due to the slope of the hill, and that is why the field reaches the bottom eve-
rywhere at about the same time, yielding only small density fluctuations.
</p>
<p>But now let us ask ourselves: What happens when the field is close to the 
top of the hill, where the slope is very small? There, the inflaton is at the 
mercy of quantum kicks, which shove it randomly one way and then the 
other. The typical time interval between the kicks is the doubling time of 
inflation, tD &sim; 1/H (recall H is the Hubble parameter); hence the field will 
undergo a &ldquo;random walk&rdquo;, making random steps forward and backwards,

</p>
<p>separated by time intervals &sim; 1/H. Eventually, after a number of steps, the 
field will get to a steeper part of the hill and then roll down towards the end 
of inflation.1
</p>
<p>To see how the inflaton field values are distributed in space, let us recall 
that quantum kicks occur in small patches of Hubble size dH = c/H. This is 
the maximum distance over which communication is possible in the inflat-
ing universe, so the directions of the kicks in different &ldquo;Hubble patches&rdquo; are 
random and independent of one another. If two points in space are sepa-
rated by less than a Hubble distance, they experience the same quantum 
kicks. But the points are rapidly driven apart by the inflationary expansion, 
and once their separation exceeds dH, their histories begin to diverge. As 
time goes on, the distance between the points gets larger and larger, and the 
field values become more and more divergent.
</p>
<p>The smallness of density fluctuations in our observable region tells us 
that all points within our region were still within a Hubble distance of one 
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.2 At the top of the hill quantum kicks (long dashed arrows) are stronger 
than classical motion (small solid arrow), so the field undergoes a random walk. 
Once the slope is steep enough, the classical motion dominates (see long solid 
arrow), and the field slow-rolls to the end of inflation. This classical slow-roll 
regime is highlighted in light grey
</p>
<p>1In a &ldquo;topless&rdquo; model, having a potential energy landscape like the one shown in Fig. 17.8, the hill gets 
steeper at higher altitudes, so the classical force pushing the inflaton field downwards gets stronger. But 
Andrei Linde has shown that the strength of quantum kicks increases with altitude even faster. Thus, if 
the inflaton field starts out at high enough elevation, quantum kicks become the dominant force, and 
the field undergoes a quantum random walk, until it gets to a sufficiently low level and rolls classically 
downhill.</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57040-2_17">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57040-2_17</a></div>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>another when the inflaton field was well on its way down the hill. That is 
why the effect of quantum kicks was very minor, and the field reached the 
bottom everywhere at about the same time. But if we could go to very large 
distances, far beyond our horizon, we would see regions that parted our 
company when the field was still wandering near the hilltop. Such regions 
have very different scalar field histories, and some of them may still be in the 
process of inflationary expansion.
</p>
<p>Eternally inflating spacetimes produced via a quantum random walk have 
been studied in various computer simulations. Figure 18.3 is a snapshot of a 
2D simulation which shows that true vacuum regions form as islands in the 
inflating background of false vacuum. The islands grow rapidly in size, as 
their boundaries advance into the inflating sea, but the inflating regions that 
separate them expand even faster, making room for more islands to form. 
The resulting pattern resembles an aerial view of an archipelago, with large 
islands surrounded by smaller ones, which are surrounded by still smaller 
ones, and so on. This fractal pattern is somewhat similar to that in our sim-
ple model of Fig. 18.1; the main difference is that the islands do not have 
orderly square shapes and are distributed in a more irregular manner.
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.3 2D simulation of an eternally inflating spacetime (performed by V. 
Vanchurin, A. Vilenkin and S. Winitzki). It shows true vacuum islands (light) in 
the inflating background (dark). The larger islands are the older ones: they have 
had more time to grow (Note that the color coding is different here than in 
Fig. 18.1)

<p>18.3  Eternal Inflation via Bubble Nucleation
</p>
<p>Suppose now that the false vacuum is separated from the true vacuum by 
an energy barrier, as in Guth&rsquo;s model of inflation (see Fig. 16.6). Then the 
false vacuum decays through bubble nucleation. Bubbles of true vacuum 
pop out at random here and there and immediately start to expand. They 
expand faster and faster, approaching the speed of light, but they are driven 
apart by the expansion of intervening regions of false vacuum. Hence, in this 
scenario inflation never ends&mdash;it is eternal. This was bad news for Guth&rsquo;s 
original model because it was unclear how the false vacuum energy could 
ever be turned into a hot fireball. But later Paul Steinhardt realized that this 
could be achieved by modifying the shape of the inflaton energy landscape. 
Instead of a steep decline towards the true vacuum, he suggested that the 
barrier should be followed by a gentle slope, as in Fig. 18.4. Then the infla-
ton field in a newly formed bubble has a value on the right hand side of the 
barrier; this value is separated from the true vacuum by a long stretch of 
gentle slope.
</p>
<p>While the bubble expands, inflation continues inside of it, as the field 
slowly rolls downhill. When the field gets to the bottom of the hill, it con-
verts its energy into a hot fireball of particles. This model is thus a hybrid of 
Guth&rsquo;s original scenario and Linde&rsquo;s slow roll model. The false vacuum inflates 
eternally, producing an unlimited number of bubbles, and each of the bub-
bles undergoes a period of slow-roll inflation in its interior, followed by the 
production of a fireball and subsequent hot big bang evolution. If we could 
take a &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye view&rdquo; of the eternally inflating false vacuum with bubbles, 
the picture would be the same as in Fig. 16.7, except now inflation continues 
within each bubble, as the field slowly rolls towards the true vacuum.

<p>According to this scenario, we live in one of the bubbles and can see only 
a small part of it. No matter how fast we travel, we cannot catch up with the 
expanding boundaries of our bubble. So, apart from rare bubble collisions, 
for all practical purposes, each bubble is a self-contained, isolated bubble 
universe.
</p>
<p>18.4  Bubble Spacetimes
</p>
<p>Bubble universes have a very interesting spacetime structure, which we shall 
now discuss in detail. Bubbles are microscopic when they materialize; then 
they expand without bound and become arbitrarily large. The central parts 
of large bubbles are very old. They evolved through all the phases of the hot 
big bang. Stars formed and died, intelligent life emerged and went extinct, 
so now these old regions are dark and barren. On the other hand, regions 
at the bubble periphery are young. This is where the false vacuum energy is 
being converted into a hot fireball and new stars are being formed.
</p>
<p>The spacetime of a bubble universe is schematically illustrated in 
Fig. 18.5. Here, the vertical direction is time, the horizontal direction is 
space, and two of the three spatial dimensions are not shown. Each horizon-

<p>tal slice through the diagram gives a snapshot of the universe at a moment of 
time. You can follow the history of the bubble by starting with the horizon-
tal line marked &ldquo;before&rdquo; at the bottom of the figure and gradually moving it 
upward. The horizontal segment marked &ldquo;nucleation&rdquo; indicates the moment 
of bubble formation. The fuzzy grey line shows where the fireball is formed 
and hot big bang evolution begins. The location marked by a black galaxy is 
the here and now, and white galaxies indicate spacetime regions where the 
conditions are similar to what we have here today. The horizontal dashed 
line labeled &ldquo;now&rdquo; represents the present time. It shows the bubble uni-
verse with a barren central region and some hot evolving regions close to the 
boundaries.
</p>
<p>There is, however, another way to think about this spacetime, which 
yields a very different view of the bubble universe. The key point is that  
&ldquo;a moment of time&rdquo; is not a uniquely defined concept in general relativity. 
When cosmologists talk about a moment of time, they picture a large num-
ber of observers, equipped with clocks and scattered through the universe. 
Each observer can see only a small region in her immediate vicinity, but 
the whole assembly of observers is needed to describe the entire spacetime. 
We can think of ourselves as one member in this assembly. Our clock now 
shows the time 13.8 billion years ABB. &ldquo;The same time&rdquo; in another part of 
the universe is when the clock of the observer located there shows the same 
reading. We have to decide, though, how observers, who are outside each 
other&rsquo;s horizons, are to synchronize their clocks.
</p>
<p>In the case of a Friedmann universe, the answer is simple: the big bang 
is the natural origin of time, so each observer should count time start-
ing from the big bang. But in an eternally inflating spacetime with multi-
ple bubble universes, there is no such obvious choice. One possibility is to 
imagine observers who can exist in false vacuum and who synchronize their 
clocks in a small false vacuum region, while they are still within each oth-
er&rsquo;s Hubble distance. The observers are then driven apart by the inflationary 
expansion and encompass a large volume, including many bubble universes, 
at later times. The snapshots of the eternally inflating universe in Figs. 16.7 
and 18.3 assume such a group of observers, and the moments &ldquo;before&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;now&rdquo; in Fig. 18.5 correspond to this choice as well.
</p>
<p>But suppose now that we want to describe a specific bubble universe from 
the point of view of its inhabitants. Then the situation is similar to that of 
a Friedmann universe: there is now a natural choice for the origin of time. 
All observers inhabiting the bubble universe can count time from their local 
&ldquo;big bang&rdquo;, that is, from the creation of the fireball at their respective loca-
tions. To distinguish between the large-region and single-bubble description </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>we shall refer to them as &ldquo;global&rdquo; and &ldquo;local&rdquo; (or &ldquo;internal&rdquo;) views, respec-
tively.
</p>
<p>The internal view of the bubble universe is illustrated in the spacetime 
diagram of Fig. 18.6. The spacetime structure is the same as in Fig. 18.5, 
but the lines representing moments of time are drawn differently. The fuzzy 
grey line representing the creation of the fireball now corresponds to the 
initial moment. The density of matter at this moment is very nearly uni-
form, and thus in the local view the bubble universe is nearly homogeneous 
(apart from small inhomogeneities due to quantum fluctuations). The pre-
sent moment in this view is represented by the dotted line marked &ldquo;now&rdquo;, 
which coincides with the line of galaxies in the figure. All points on this line 
are characterized by the same density of matter and the same average density 
of stars as observed in our local region. But most remarkably, from the local 
point of view the bubble universe is infinite.
</p>
<p>In the global view, the bubble universe grows with time, as new hot fire-
ball regions are created near its boundary, and becomes arbitrarily large if 
you wait long enough. But in the local view, the fireball is created all at once 
and the bubble universe is infinite from the very beginning. In Fig. 18.6 this 
infinity is evident from the fact that the fuzzy line representing the crea-
tion of the fireball never comes to an end. Analysis shows that the spatial 
geometry of a bubble universe in the local view is that of an open (negative 
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.6 Viewed from the inside (internal view), each bubble is an infinite uni-
verse. In the global view of Fig. 18.5, each bubble can grow for an infinite time, 
but is finite at any given moment of time. The difference is due to different defi-
nitions of time

<p> curvature) Friedmann universe.2 Thus, the picture of finite spatial sections 
which grow for an infinity of time in the global viewpoint is replaced by an 
infinity of spatial extent at each moment of time in the internal viewpoint.
</p>
<p>This dual viewpoint leads to a very interesting situation: an eternally 
inflating spacetime can be closed and finite, and yet it can contain bub-
ble universes that appear to be infinite to the observers who live inside 
(Fig. 18.7).
</p>
<p>We note finally that analysis of random walk models of eternal infla-
tion has shown that the properties of true vacuum islands predicted in 
these models (and illustrated in Fig. 18.3) are similar to those of bubble 
universes. An island also appears to be infinite to internal observers, and 
the observers cannot escape from their island, because its boundaries are 
expanding so fast.
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.7 The 2D surface represents the spacetime of a one-dimensional uni-
verse. This universe is closed and finite. It is filled with false vacuum at the initial 
moment (bottom of the figure) and contains three bubble universes at the time 
corresponding to the top of the figure. Each bubble universe appears to be infi-
nite from the point of view of its inhabitants
</p>
<p>2By the end of inflation the bubble universe becomes nearly flat, so its curvature is very difficult to 
observe.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>More on bubble spacetimes
</p>
<p>Observers can find the expansion rate of their bubble universe by measuring 
how fast the distances between galaxies grow with time. But because of the 
complicated spacetime geometry, this rate is not simply related to, and is typi-
cally much slower than, the expansion rate of the false vacuum outside. It is even 
possible for the bubble interior to contract, while the bubble itself is expand-
ing. An external observer would then see the bubble radius grow, while internal 
observers would see galaxies getting closer with time, as illustrated in Fig. 18.8. 
This situation could arise if the vacuum energy density (the cosmological con-
stant) inside the bubble is negative. A negative cosmological constant produces 
an attractive gravitational force and causes the bubble universe to contract to a 
big crunch.
</p>
<p>18.5  Cosmic Clones
</p>
<p>At this point we would like to mention a remarkable and, to our minds, 
disturbing consequence of eternal inflation. Because the number of bubble 
universes is unlimited, and each of them expands without bound, they will 
contain an unbounded number of regions with the same size as our observ-
able universe; let us call them O-regions. All these regions look the same at 
the end of inflation, except for the pattern of small density fluctuations. As 
fluctuations are amplified by gravity, the properties of the regions diverge,

</p>
<p>and they end up with different distributions of stars and galaxies. Random 
quantum events also influence the evolution of life, and this leads to fur-
ther divergence of histories. So, should we expect the infinite number of 
O-regions to each have unique histories that result in their own unique pre-
sent state?
</p>
<p>In classical physics, the state of a physical system is described by speci-
fying the precise positions and velocities of all its particles. Given a sys-
tem of particles&mdash;say the contents of your refrigerator right now&mdash;you can 
always change its state by an arbitrarily small amount. Even if you barely 
changed the position or velocity of one single particle in the milk bottle, 
you would create a new distinct state. Classically, there is a continuum of 
states, which can be made arbitrarily close to one another, yet still main-
tain a unique identity. In quantum mechanics this is impossible because the 
uncertainty principle leads to an inherent fuzziness in the state of a system. 
Configurations which are too close to one another cannot be distinguished, 
even in principle. The upshot of the uncertainty principle is that the number 
of distinct quantum states in any finite volume is finite.
</p>
<p>The number of possible histories of an O-region is finite as well. A his-
tory is described by a sequence of states at successive moments of time. The 
histories that are possible in quantum physics differ immensely from the 
ones possible in the classical world. In the quantum world the future is not 
uniquely determined by the past; the same initial state can lead to a multi-
tude of different outcomes, and so only the probabilities of those outcomes 
can be determined. Consequently, the range of possible histories is greatly 
enlarged. Once again, though, the fuzziness imposed by quantum uncer-
tainty makes it impossible to distinguish histories that are too close to each 
other. An estimate of the number of distinct histories that can unfold in an 
O-region between the big bang and the present gives &sim; 1010
</p>
<p>150
</p>
<p>. This num-
ber is fantastically huge, but the important point is that the number is finite.
</p>
<p>Let us now take stock of the situation. The theory of inflation tells us 
that the number of O-regions in an eternally inflating universe is infinite, 
and quantum uncertainty implies that only a finite number of histories can 
unfold in any O-region. The initial states of the O-regions at the big bang 
are set by random quantum processes during inflation, so all possible ini-
tial states are represented in the ensemble. Putting those statements together, 
it follows that every history which has a nonzero probability should be 
repeated an infinite number of times.
</p>
<p>Among the infinitely replayed scripts are some very bizarre histories. For 
example, a huge quantum fluctuation could cause the Sun to suddenly col-
lapse to a black hole. The probability of this happening is extremely small, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>but remember: in quantum mechanics all processes that are not strictly for-
bidden by conservation laws do occur with a nonzero probability.
</p>
<p>A striking consequence of this picture of the world is that there should 
be an infinity of O-regions with histories absolutely identical to ours. That&rsquo;s 
right, scores of your duplicates are scattered throughout the eternally inflat-
ing spacetime. They live on planets exactly like Earth, with all its mountains, 
cities, trees, and butterflies. There should also be regions where histories 
are somewhat different from ours, with all possible variations. For exam-
ple, some readers will be pleased to know that there are infinitely many 
O-regions where Hillary Clinton is the President of the United States.
</p>
<p>You may be wondering whether all these things in different regions are 
happening at the same time. This question does not have a definite answer, 
because time and simultaneity are not uniquely defined in general relativity 
(as we discussed in Sect. 18.4). If, for example, we use the local time defini-
tion in a bubble universe, then at each moment of time the bubble  interior 
is an infinite hyperbolic space, and each of us has an infinite number of 
duplicates presently living in our bubble.3
</p>
<p>Note that infinity of space (or time) is not by itself sufficient to warrant 
these conclusions. We could, for example, have the same galaxy endlessly 
repeated in an infinite space. So we need some &ldquo;randomizer&rdquo;, a stochastic 
mechanism that picks initial states for different regions from the set of all 
possible states. Even then, the entire set may not be exhausted if the total 
number of states is infinite. So the finiteness of the number of states N is 
important for the argument. In the case of eternal inflation, the finiteness of 
N and the randomness of initial conditions are both guaranteed by quantum 
mechanics.
</p>
<p>18.6  The Multiverse
</p>
<p>So far we have assumed that all other bubble universes are similar to ours in 
terms of their physical properties, but this does not have to be so. Consider 
for example the energy landscape shown in Fig. 18.9. It has four vacuum 
states, labeled A, B, C and D, with A having the highest energy density. 
Vacuum D has the lowest energy density, which is negative in this example. 
</p>
<p>3If you want to meet some of your duplicates, there is a problem: your nearest cosmic clone lives about 
</p>
<p>10
10
</p>
<p>90 m away. Another issue is that clones who are identical at this time will not remain so, because 
their subsequent evolution is influenced by random quantum processes.
</p>
<p>18.5 Cosmic Clones     281</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>282     18 Eternal Inflation
</p>
<p>Suppose the universe is initially filled with vacuum A. The high energy den-
sity of A will then drive exponential inflationary expansion, and bubbles of 
vacuum B and vacuum C will nucleate and expand in the background of A.4 
Both B and C have positive energy densities, so the interiors of these bub-
bles will also be inflating (but at a slower rate than A). Bubbles of vacuum D 
will nucleate inside the inflating bubbles of C. Furthermore, tunneling &ldquo;up&rdquo; 
from low to high energy density is also possible, albeit with a very low prob-
ability&mdash;much less than the probability to tunnel &ldquo;down&rdquo;. Hence, new bub-
bles of A will form inside the bubbles of B and C, but they will be very 
rare.5 All of these tunneling processes populate the inflating universe with all 
four types of vacua (see Fig. 18.10). The number of bubbles of all types will 
grow without bound in the course of eternal inflation.
</p>
<p>A more realistic energy landscape would include several scalar fields. The 
Higgs field of the Standard Model is an example of a scalar field that we 
know exists. Grand unified theories predict a number of other Higgs fields 
whose values determine the particle properties. A model with two sca-
lar fields would have a two-dimensional energy landscape with mountains 
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.9 A model energy landscape with four vacuum states, labeled A, B, C 
and D. Bubbles of B and C can form in vacuum A by quantum tunneling through 
energy barriers. Similarly, bubbles of D can nucleate in C
</p>
<p>4We assume here that tunneling from a given vacuum is possible only to a neighboring vacuum in the 
landscape; hence it is not possible to tunnel from A to D.
5Tunneling up from zero and negative energy vacuum states is impossible. We note, however, that such 
tunneling may occur from zero or negative energy bubbles, if they have inflation or matter dominated 
periods at the early stages of their evolution (which temporarily increases their overall energy density 
above the vacuum value of zero or less).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and valleys, as depicted in Fig. 18.11. As before, each valley corresponds 
to a classically stable vacuum, and transitions between the vacua can occur 
through bubble nucleation.
</p>
<p>With n scalar fields, the energy landscape is n-dimensional. For n &gt; 2, we 
cannot draw such a landscape on a piece of paper, but it is not difficult to 
analyze mathematically and find all classically stable vacua. As long as infla-
tion begins in one of the positive-energy vacua, all of the other vacua will 
be realized via the dynamics of eternal inflation. Bubbles of positive-energy 
vacua will inflate, allowing for more bubbles within bubbles to form, exactly 
like in the eternal inflation scenario with a single scalar field. Negative-
energy bubbles will expand externally, but internally they will contract to a 
big crunch (see the box in Sect. 18.4).
</p>
<p>The values of the Higgs fields vary from one vacuum to another, and as a 
result particle masses and interactions vary as well. One vacuum state in the 
energy landscape should correspond to our world, but others are likely to 
be very different. We thus arrive at the picture of an inflationary multiverse, 
populated by bubble universes with diverse properties.
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.10 The multiverse of the model with energy landscape shown in 
Fig. 18.9. Green, blue, yellow and red bubbles correspond to vacua A, B, C and 
D, respectively. Positive-energy vacua (A, B and C) are inflating, while bubbles of 
vacuum D do not inflate. Interiors of such negative-energy bubbles eventually 
collapse to a big crunch

<p>18.7  Testing the Multiverse
</p>
<p>The theory of eternal inflation is mainly concerned with far-away regions, 
outside our cosmic horizon, and some physicists have raised doubts that the 
theory can ever be tested observationally. Surprisingly, such tests may in fact 
be possible.
</p>
<p>18.7.1  Bubble Collisions
</p>
<p>If a new bubble nucleates within a distance dH from our expanding bubble, 
then it will crash into ours. The collision would produce a round spot of 
higher radiation intensity in the cosmic background radiation. Detection of 
such spots with the predicted intensity profile would provide direct evidence 
for the existence of other bubble universes (Fig. 18.12).
</p>
<p>The expected number of collision spots in the CMB depends on the rate 
of bubble nucleation in the false vacuum, and their brightness depends on

resents the value of the potential energy density, and the two axes represent 
two different scalar fields. Each valley represents a vacuum state. We shall see in 
Chap. 19 that some modern particle theories predict a large number of such val-
leys</p>

<p>the amount of inflation that took place in our bubble interior: the more 
inflation, the dimmer are the spots. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that 
detectable bubble collisions have occurred within our horizon.
</p>
<p>18.7.2  Black Holes from the Multiverse
</p>
<p>Another interesting possibility is that evidence for the multiverse may be 
found in our own neighborhood, in the form of black holes. During the 
slow roll inflation period within our bubble, bubbles of other kinds can 
nucleate and expand within it. When inflation ends, these bubbles suddenly 
find themselves surrounded by the very low-energy vacuum that we live 
in now. At this point they stop expanding and start contracting. (Bubbles 
expand when they are surrounded by a higher-energy vacuum and contract 
when the vacuum outside has lower energy.) There is nothing to stop this 
contraction, so the bubbles collapse to form black holes.6
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.12 Even though bubble collisions are rare, our expanding bubble will 
collide with an infinite number of other bubbles in the course of its history
</p>
<p>6Even though bubbles collapse as viewed from outside, their interiors are filled with a high-energy vac-
uum and continue to inflate. In a two-dimensional analogy, the resulting geometry can be pictured as 
an inflating balloon, which is connected to a flat exterior region by a thin &ldquo;throat&rdquo;. The throat is seen as 
a black hole from outside. Thus, black holes formed in this way contain inflating universes inside.

<p>286     18 Eternal Inflation
</p>
<p>Bubbles that formed earlier have bigger sizes, and bubbles that formed 
near the end of inflation are very tiny. Bigger bubbles form larger black 
holes, so the result is a population of black holes with a wide distribution 
of masses, ranging from less than a gram to millions of Solar masses. These 
black holes are fossils of the multiverse. If black holes with the predicted 
mass distribution are discovered, this would provide evidence for the exist-
ence of a multiverse.
</p>
<p>Apart from these direct methods, some indirect tests of the multiverse 
theory may also be possible. In fact, some indirect evidence for the multi-
verse has already been found, as we shall discuss in the following chapters.
</p>
<p>Summary
The end of inflation is triggered by quantum, probabilistic processes and 
does not occur everywhere at once. In our cosmic neighborhood, inflation 
ended 13.8 billion years ago, but it still continues in remote parts of the uni-
verse, where other &ldquo;normal&rdquo; regions like ours are constantly being formed.
</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;bubble nucleation&rdquo; picture, the new regions appear as tiny, micro-
scopic bubbles and immediately start to grow. The bubbles keep growing 
without bound; all the while they are driven apart by the inflationary expan-
sion of the parent false vacuum, making room for more bubbles to form. 
We live in one of these bubbles and can observe only a small part of it. The 
&ldquo;quantum random walk&rdquo; picture is similar, giving rise to an infinite number 
of self-contained island universes separated by inflating false vacuum. Both 
of these pictures result in a never-ending process called eternal inflation. All 
that is needed for cosmic inflation to be eternal is a false vacuum region that 
multiplies faster than it decays.
</p>
<p>Modern particle physics suggests that a number of Higgs scalar fields should 
contribute to an energy landscape replete with mountains and valleys. Each 
valley corresponds to a classically stable vacuum, but transitions between the 
vacua can occur through bubble nucleation. Thus, if the universe starts in a 
positive energy vacuum state, then through a random series of transitions from 
one vacuum to another, all the other vacua in the landscape can be realized. 
One vacuum state should correspond to our world, but others are likely to be 
very different. We thus arrive at the picture of an inflationary multiverse, popu-
lated by bubble universes with diverse properties.
</p>
<p>A collision of our expanding bubble with another bubble would pro-
duce a round spot of higher radiation intensity in the cosmic background </p>

<p> radiation. A detection of such a spot with the predicted intensity profile 
would provide direct evidence for the existence of other bubble universes.
</p>
<p>An unsettling consequence of eternal inflation is that anything that can 
possibly happen will happen, and it will happen an infinite number of 
times. In particular, there should be an infinite number of regions absolutely 
identical to ours. There should also be regions somewhat different from ours, 
with all possible variations.
</p>
<p>Questions
 1.  What do we mean by the phrase &ldquo;eternal inflation&rdquo;? Does it mean that 
</p>
<p>inflation never ends at any given place? Does it mean that inflation con-
tinues forever to the past, as well as to the future?
</p>
<p> 2.  Imagine you are a comoving observer in the inflating region represented 
by one of the white squares in the simple model of Sect. 18.1. What is 
the probability that inflation will continue in your neighborhood for 
another doubling time? What is the probability for it to continue for 10 
doubling times?
</p>
<p> 3.  Suppose that in each doubling time of inflation the volume of false vac-
uum grows by a factor 23 = 8 and a fraction f of this volume decays to 
true vacuum. By how much will the false vacuum volume change after 
N doubling times? How large should f be in order to prevent eternal 
inflation from happening?
</p>
<p> 4.  Once a bubble nucleates in an inflating false vacuum, is it possible for 
inflation to continue inside the bubble?
</p>
<p> 5.  During the course of eternal inflation, how many bubble universes will 
be formed?
</p>
<p> 6.  Can we in principle travel across the inflating false vacuum and visit 
other bubble universes?
</p>
<p> 7.  From the external viewpoint, are bubble universes infinite or finite in 
spatial extent? What about from an internal viewpoint?
</p>
<p> 8.  How is it possible to have a closed and finite universe, which neverthe-
less contains bubble universes that are infinite from the viewpoint of 
their inhabitants?
</p>
<p> 9.  Eternal inflation can also be achieved via a quantum random walk. 
Explain how this works.
</p>
<p> 10.  How would you modify the shape of the potential energy hill in 
Fig. 18.2 to prevent eternal inflation from happening, while still keeping 
inflation in the slow-roll region?

<p>to a multiverse? Assuming that both vacua have positive energy den-
sity, sketch a 2&ndash;dimensional cartoon of the resulting pattern of bubbles 
(analogous to Fig. 18.10).

ally? If yes, how?

can possibly happen will happen an infinite number of times.&rdquo; Is this 
necessarily true? If not, what additional assumptions about the proper-
ties of the universe should we make in order for it to be true?
</p>
<p> 15.  Is the number of distinct states in an infinite volume finite or infinite? 
Explain. Hint: consider an infinite sequence of regions, each of which can 
only be in one of two states, labeled by 1 and 2. Now consider how many 
different sequences (consisting of the numbers 1 and 2) are possible.
</p>
<p> 16.  If an eternally inflating universe produces an infinite number of regions 
having the size of our observable region, and if each region can only have 
a finite number of histories, is it likely, unavoidable, or impossible to 
have other regions where someone has had the exact same past as you? If 
such a person does exist, will she or he have the same future as you?
</p>
<p> 17.  Suppose a region can be in an infinite number of states, and the universe 
contains an infinite number of such regions. Can we conclude that all 
possible states will occur somewhere in the universe? (Hint: suppose we 
label the possible states by integers 1, 2, 3, &hellip;. Can you think of an infi-
nite sequence of integers which does not include all possible integers?)

<p>Much of the research in particle physics has been inspired by the quest for a 
unified, fundamental theory of Nature. The hope is that beneath the plural-
ity of particles and forces, there is a single mathematical law that governs 
all natural phenomena. A major step towards the unification of forces was 
the development of the electroweak theory. The electromagnetic and weak 
nuclear forces are indistinguishable at very high energies, but at energies 
below 100 GeV the symmetry between the forces is broken and the two 
interactions become distinct. In the 1970s and 80s physicists used a similar 
approach to include the strong nuclear force. They postulated a large, &ldquo;grand 
unified&rdquo; symmetry, which encompasses electroweak and strong interactions 
and gets broken at very high energies ~1016 GeV. Grand unification is a very 
attractive idea, and many physicists believe that it will survive as part of the 
final theory. However, it suffers from significant shortcomings. First, there 
is a large (in fact, infinite) number of possible grand unified symmetries to 
choose from, and none of these symmetries appears to be a priori preferred. 
The list of particles included in the theory is also largely arbitrary. Hence, 
there is a large number of candidate grand unified theories. This is a prob-
lem, since one expects the fundamental theory of Nature to be in some sense 
unique. Moreover, all attempts to include gravity into the grand unification 
scheme have proved to be unsuccessful. This led physicists to consider a rad-
ically new approach&mdash;string theory&mdash;which we shall now discuss.

<p>292     19 String Theory and the Multiverse
</p>
<p>19.1  What Is String Theory?
</p>
<p>String theory asserts that the basic building blocks of matter are one-dimen-
sional strings, instead of point-like particles. The strings have high tension, 
which causes them to vibrate at speeds close to the speed of light. All par-
ticles of the Standard Model, like electrons or quarks, and any particles not 
yet discovered, are postulated to be tiny vibrating strings. They appear to be 
point-like because the strings are so small.
</p>
<p>The properties of a particle&mdash;its mass, spin, electric and color charges&mdash;
are determined by the vibration pattern of the string. While each type of 
particle is made from the same entity&mdash;the string&mdash;the many possible vibra-
tion patterns give rise to a variety of distinct particles. This is analogous to 
how a single violin string can generate many different musical notes (see 
Fig. 19.1). Remarkably, one of the possible string vibration patterns has 
properties that match the graviton&mdash;the quantum of the gravitational field. 
The graviton plays a role in gravity similar to that of the photon in electro-
magnetic theory. Thus, the problem of unifying gravity with other interac-
</p>
<p>Fig. 19.1 Top three rows a violin string, with its two ends fixed, has a multitude 
of vibration modes. Bottom row closed strings can oscillate with different modes 
giving rise to different particles. Strings can also be open, having two free ends. 
Here, we only consider closed strings for simplicity</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>tions does not exist in string theory; in fact, the theory cannot be formulated 
without gravity.1
</p>
<p>The typical length of vibrating strings is set by the so-called Planck length,
</p>
<p>which was introduced by Max Planck at the turn of the 20th century, long 
before the invention of string theory. Planck realized that ℓp is the only 
quantity with dimension of length that can be constructed out of the fun-
damental constants G, c and �. It is also the length scale at which quantum 
fluctuations of spacetime geometry become important, as we shall discuss 
in the next chapter. The Planck length is incredibly small: it is 14 orders of 
magnitude below the smallest length that can be resolved by the most pow-
erful accelerator to date, the Large Hadron Collider. Hence the strings that 
particles are made of are not likely to be directly observed any time soon.
</p>
<p>Particle interactions in string theory can be depicted as strings splitting 
and joining, as illustrated in Fig. 19.2. One of the major attractions of the 
theory is that it is free from the problem of infinities that had plagued all 
earlier attempts to develop a quantum theory of gravity. The problem can be 
traced to the point-like nature of particles. When two particles collide, their

</p>
<p>Fig. 19.2 Two strings collide and merge into a single string, which then splits 
into two again. This corresponds to particle interactions like absorption and re-
emission of a photon by an electron
</p>
<p>1String theory has a peculiar history. It was first introduced in 1970 as a theory of strong interactions. 
However, the theory predicted the existence of a massless boson, which had no counterpart among the 
strongly interacting particles. So string theory was all but discarded, only to be revived several years 
later, when John Schwartz and Joel Scherk realized that the problematic boson had all the properties of 
the graviton.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>294     19 String Theory and the Multiverse
</p>
<p>energy is concentrated at a point, so the energy density and the curvature of 
spacetime become infinite at the time of collision. As a result, calculations of 
probabilities for various particle interactions often give nonsensical infinite 
answers. Strings, on the other hand, have a finite size, and string theory gives 
reasonable, finite results for all probabilities.
</p>
<p>19.2  Extra Dimensions
</p>
<p>The attractive features of string theory did not come without a cost. Back in 
the 1970s physicists discovered that the theory suffers from peculiar mathe-
matical flaws, called anomalies, that lead to violations of energy conservation 
and other unacceptable physical processes. They also found that the strength 
of anomalies depends on the number of space dimensions and that anoma-
lies completely disappear in a 9-dimensional space. In other words, string 
theory is mathematically consistent only if space has six extra dimensions in 
addition to the familiar three.
</p>
<p>This sounds embarrassing: why would anyone even consider a theory 
which is in glaring conflict with reality? Let us stop for a moment to think 
what having extra space dimensions would feel like. Imagine a flatland&mdash;a 
two-dimensional world whose inhabitants are unaware of the third dimen-
sion. A resident of this world who has access to the third dimension would 
then be able to perform truly magical acts. For example, she would easily 
escape from any jail. It would also be impossible to hide anything from this 
person. A locked room or a safe would look just like open rectangles from 
the vantage point of the third dimension. We are not aware of any such phe-
nomena in our world, so does this mean that extra dimensions do not exist?
</p>
<p>Not necessarily. Extra dimensions could be curled up, or, as physicists say, 
compactified, to a very small size. A long garden hose is a simple example 
of compactification: it has one large dimension along the hose and another 
one curled up in a small circle. When viewed from a distance, the hose looks 
like a one-dimensional line, but close by we can see that its surface is a two-
dimensional cylinder. String theory suggests that our universe may be very 
similar: the compact six dimensions may be as small as the Planck length 
and therefore nearly impossible to detect. However, the sizes of extra dimen-
sions and the manner in which they are compactified affect the vibrational 
states of the strings. And the vibrational patterns in turn determine the 
properties of all particles and forces. Hence, the constants of nature in our 
3-dimensional world, such as particle masses and the vacuum energy density, 
depend on the size and shape of the hidden extra dimensions.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.3  The Energy Landscape
</p>
<p>If we had only one extra dimension, the only way to compactify it would 
be to curl it up in a circle. A two-dimensional space can be compactified 
in a number of different ways: a sphere, a donut, or a shape with two or 
more &ldquo;donut holes&rdquo; (see Fig. 19.3). With more dimensions, the number of 
possibilities multiplies. Furthermore, there are other ingredients in string 
theory, called fluxes (these are like magnetic fields), and branes (these are 
membranes of various dimensionalities), which also add to the number of 
possible configurations that the hidden dimensions can have.
</p>
<p>In order to fully characterize a given configuration, one has to specify the 
sizes and shapes of extra dimensions, the magnitudes of the fluxes that per-
meate them, and the locations of the branes that can wrap around them. 
Altogether, this amounts to specifying N &sim; 500 different parameters. The 
role of these parameters in string theory is similar to that of the Higgs fields 
in particle physics: (i) varying the parameters results in variation of particle 
properties and (ii) the parameters adjust their values to minimize the poten-
tial energy density. In the simple models with one or two parameters, the 
energy landscape can be visually represented, as illustrated in Figs. 18.9 and 
18.11. The energy minima correspond to valleys in the landscape. A similar 
representation for the energy landscape of string theory would require a space 
of N dimensions, with one dimension for each of the N &sim; 500 parameters.
</p>
<p>If we try to enumerate the distinct ways the extra-dimensional ingredients 
can be combined to form a minimum (or &ldquo;valley&rdquo;) in the energy landscape, we 
find that there are googols of possibilities. For a very rough estimate, suppose 
that each of the N parameters can take p different values in the valleys. The total 
number of possible combinations is then pN (see Question 6). With p &sim; 10 
and N &sim; 500, this gives 10500&mdash;a truly enormous number! (by comparison, the 
number of atoms in the observable part of the universe is &ldquo;only&rdquo; ~1080).

</p>
<p>Each valley in the energy landscape corresponds to a different possible 
world, with its own particles, interactions and constants of nature. Thus, 
although strings obey a unique set of laws in higher dimensions, the many 
compactification choices and extra-dimensional ingredients lead to a huge 
ensemble of lower-dimensional vacuum states.
</p>
<p>This raises many questions. If string theory is correct, then one out of the 
googols of vacuum states in the landscape corresponds to our world. But 
which one? How was this particular state selected to be realized in nature? 
And what about all the states which are not like ours? What kinds of uni-
verses do they describe? In some of them gravity may be stronger than the 
strong nuclear force. Others may have three different kinds of photon, and 
still others no photons at all. There may be states with more or less than 
six dimensions compactified, so the number of the remaining large spatial 
dimensions is different from three. Do these states exist only as possibilities, 
or could they exist somewhere in the physical spacetime?
</p>
<p>19.4  String Theory Multiverse
</p>
<p>The hope of string theorists was that the theory would yield a unique vac-
uum state&mdash;presumably ours. They searched for a guiding principle that 
would select this particular vacuum in the energy landscape. However, no 
plausible vacuum selection principle has yet been found. Instead, a very dif-
ferent picture has emerged. It was first suggested by Raphael Bousso and 
Joseph Polchinski, who combined string theory with the ideas of eternal 
inflation.
</p>
<p>Bousso and Polchinski asserted that there are no preferred vacuum states: 
all vacua should be treated on an equal footing. Suppose the universe 
begins in a vacuum state corresponding to some valley in the landscape. If 
the energy density of this vacuum is positive, it will drive exponential infla-
tionary expansion. The initial vacuum is classically stable (as are all vacuum 
states in the landscape), but sooner or later bubbles of other vacua will begin 
to nucleate by quantum tunneling through energy barriers to the neighbor-
ing valleys. Interiors of positive-energy bubbles will also be inflating and will 
become sites of further bubble nucleation. In this way, each type of vacuum 
permitted by the string theory landscape will populate the spacetime. The 
number of bubbles of all possible types will grow without bound during the 
course of eternal inflation. The resulting multiverse will look like Fig. 18.10, 
except that it will include ~10500 different kinds of bubble universes, so it 
would require ~10500 colors to depict it!</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Most of the string theory practitioners initially viewed this multiverse idea 
as a giant step backwards. &ldquo;This is a dangerous idea that I am simply unwilling 
to contemplate&rdquo;, wrote the prominent Princeton cosmologist Paul Steinhardt. 
If the multiverse includes a multitude of different types of bubble universes, 
how can we ever hope to explain the observed particle properties? Whatever 
these properties are, we can always expect to find a suitable fit among the goo-
gols of vacua in the landscape. This looked very discouraging&mdash;a theory that 
can explain anything may eventually explain nothing at all.
</p>
<p>Another approach, advocated by Bousso and Polchinski and by one of 
the string theory pioneers Leonard Susskind, was to embrace the string mul-
tiverse picture and explore where it leads. This approach has been steadily 
gaining ground among physicists in recent years. If the multiverse picture 
turns out to be correct, it will have far-reaching consequences for the way in 
which physicists go about studying the nature of the world, as we will dis-
cuss in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>19.5  The Fate of Our Universe Revisited
</p>
<p>In Chaps. 8 and 9 we addressed the question of the fate of our universe. 
The discovery of dark energy led us to conclude that the universe will con-
tinue to expand faster and faster: distant galaxies will be pushed away from 
each other with acceleration, but bound systems, like our Galaxy and the 
Local Group, will remain bound. Although the Milky Way will merge with 
Andromeda, most of the galaxies that we see today (except those in our 
Local Group), will eventually be pushed beyond our cosmic horizon. Our 
descendants will not see a universe filled with hundreds of billions of gal-
axies, as we do, but rather will find themselves in a lone island galaxy sur-
rounded by almost nothing.
</p>
<p>But there is more to the story. If the string landscape picture is correct, 
then the enormous number of vacuum states must include some positive 
and some negative energy vacua. This means that our vacuum does not have 
the lowest possible energy and must be unstable. In other words, we must 
be living in a false vacuum! Inevitably, a negative-energy bubble will form 
in our cosmic neighborhood and start to expand, engulfing more and more 
space. Exactly when this is going to happen is impossible to predict. Bubble 
nucleation can be extremely slow and can take googols of years. But on the 
other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that an expanding negative-
energy bubble is charging toward us at this very moment. If so, it will come 
without a warning: any light the bubble emits will not get to us much ahead

<p>of the bubble itself, since it expands at nearly the speed of light. Once it 
arrives, our world will be completely annihilated, and all objects will be 
turned into some alien forms of matter.
</p>
<p>The stage is now set for the final act of the drama. As we discussed in 
Chap. 18, negative vacuum energy is gravitationally attractive and will 
cause the interior of the bubble to contract and eventually collapse to a big 
crunch. This will be the end of our local region. In the meantime, outside of 
the crunching bubble inflation will continue and countless new bubbles will 
be formed. The inflating multiverse will go on forever.
</p>
<p>Summary
String theory is perhaps the best candidate we now have for the fundamental 
theory of nature. It asserts that the basic building blocks of matter are one-
dimensional strings. All particles of the Standard Model are thought to be 
tiny vibrating strings that appear point-like because the strings are so small. 
Different vibrational patterns give rise to distinct particles.
</p>
<p>String theory automatically includes gravity. However, the theory is math-
ematically consistent only if space has 6 extra dimensions&mdash;in addition to 
the 3 we are familiar with. These extra dimensions are curled up, or com-
pactified, so they are very small and we don&rsquo;t notice them directly. However, 
the sizes of extra dimensions and the manner in which they are compactified 
affect the vibrational states of the strings. Hence, properties of our 3-dimen-
sional world, such as particle masses and the vacuum energy density, depend 
on the size and shape of the hidden dimensions.
</p>
<p>It turns out that there are a huge number of different ways to compactify 
the extra dimensions. Each one corresponds to a different possible world, or 
vacuum state, with its own particles, interactions and constants of nature. 
This ensemble of vacuum states is called the string theory landscape.
</p>
<p>Combining string theory with the theory of inflation, we arrive at the 
picture of a multiverse, where bubbles of all possible vacua nucleate and 
expand, while inflation continues ad infinitum. If this picture is correct, 
then eventually an expanding bubble of negative vacuum energy will nucle-
ate and engulf our local universe. The negative-energy bubble interior will 
finally collapse to a big crunch.

<p>The properties of every object in the universe, from subatomic particles to 
giant galaxies, are determined, in the final analysis, by a set of numbers that 
we call &ldquo;constants of nature&rdquo;. These include the speed of light, Planck&rsquo;s con-
stant, and Newton&rsquo;s gravitational constant; the parameters in the Standard 
Model, like the mass of the electron, Higgs boson, quarks and so on, and the 
strengths of the four forces. There are also several cosmological  parameters 
that shape the character of our world. These include the relative contribu-
tions of radiation, atomic matter, dark matter and dark energy to the den-
sity parameter and the magnitude of the initial density inhomogeneities. 
Altogether there are about 30 numbers,1 which beget an intriguing question: 
Why do these numbers take the particular values that they have? It has long 
been a dream of physicists to be able to derive all the constants of nature 
from some fundamental theory. But there has been very little progress in this 
direction.
</p>
<p>If you write the known constants of Nature on a piece of paper, they look 
pretty random (see Fig. 20.1). Some of them are very small, others large, so 
there seems to be no system behind these numbers. However, some people 
noted that there may be a system, but not of the kind that physicists have 
been hoping for. The values of the constants appear to be fine-tuned to allow 
for the existence of life. In other words, if we ask what would happen if we

</p>
<p>1The values of the constants depend on the units we use to measure them. Physicists therefore focus on 
dimensionless combinations of the constants, like the ratios of particle masses, which do not depend on 
the units. The number we quote (30) is the number of independent dimensionless combinations of the 
constants.</p>

</p>
<p>change one of the constants by a relatively small amount, we find that we 
would get a universe that is inhospitable to life. Let us consider a few exam-
ples that illustrate how tinkering with the constants leads to catastrophic 
results.
</p>
<p>20.1  The Fine Tuning of the Constants 
of Nature
</p>
<p>20.1.1  Neutron Mass
</p>
<p>The mass of the neutron is very finely tuned. If we adjust it just a little, we 
change the structure of matter so much that chemistry is almost  completely 
destroyed. Let&rsquo;s see why. Neutrons are 0.14% heavier than protons. Outside 
of the nucleus, they decay into protons, electrons and  antineutrinos: 
n &rarr; p+ + e&minus; + ν̄. These &ldquo;free&rdquo; neutrons have an average life of about 
15 min. But inside nuclei neutrons are stabilized by nuclear forces. If the 
neutron&rsquo;s mass were increased by 1%, then neutrons would decay even inside 
nuclei, turning into protons. The electric repulsion between the protons 
would then tear the nuclei apart, so the only stable nucleus would be that of 
hydrogen, consisting of a single proton. On the other hand, if the neutron&rsquo;s 
mass were decreased by 1%, neutrons would become lighter than protons. 
This would mean that protons would decay into neutrons, positrons and 
neutrinos: p+ &rarr; n + e+ + ν. Consequently, atomic nuclei would lose their 
charge and would consist only of neutrons. The unattached electrons would

appear to be rather random</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>fly away, so no atoms would exist. Thus, by adjusting the mass of the neu-
tron just a little, we either end up in a world that only contains one type of  
chemical element&mdash;hydrogen&mdash;or a neutron world.2
</p>
<p>20.1.2  Strength of the Weak Interaction
</p>
<p>When a massive star runs out of nuclear fuel, its core collapses in a super-
nova explosion. The strength of the weak interaction is perfectly suited to 
allow neutrinos to stream out of the core and drag along the outer layers 
of the star. This is a critical part of the cycle that enriches the interstellar 
medium with heavy elements. If weak interactions were much stronger, neu-
trinos would remain stuck in the core. If they were much weaker, neutrinos 
would stream out without dragging along other particles. If the heavy ele-
ments were not spewed into space, later generations of stars and planetary 
systems like ours would not have formed, and the raw materials for complex 
life would be missing.
</p>
<p>20.1.3  Strength of Gravity
</p>
<p>Gravity is by far the weakest force&mdash;it is 1036 times weaker than electro-
magnetism. Because gravity is so weak, we can increase its strength quite a 
lot, and it will still be weak. For example, if we make it ten billion times 
stronger, it would still be 1026 times weaker than electromagnetism. Stars 
would then be the size of mountains, and they would live for only a year or 
so. Intelligent life would hardly have enough time to evolve. Planets as mas-
sive as the Earth would be about 100 m in diameter, and the force of gravity 
on their surface would crush any object heavier than an ant.
</p>
<p>20.1.4  The Magnitude of Density Perturbations
</p>
<p>Structure formation in the universe crucially depends on the magnitude of 
primordial density perturbations. If these perturbations were much weaker, 
then galaxies may never have coalesced. (Note that structure formation 
</p>
<p>2On a more fundamental level, protons and neutrons are made up of quarks, so it is more appropriate 
to regard the quark masses as fundamental constants of nature. But the general conclusion does not 
change: we are driven to either a hydrogen world or a neutron world, unless the quark masses are suit-
ably fine-tuned.

</p>
<p>freezes at the onset of dark energy domination, thus if galaxies fail to form 
prior to this epoch, they will never form.) Without galaxies there would be 
no buildup of heavy elements, and it is unlikely that planets, and life, would 
have emerged.
</p>
<p>If the initial density perturbations were much stronger, then galax-
ies would form earlier and would be much denser. Close stellar encounters 
would be much more frequent; they would disrupt planetary orbits, with 
disastrous consequences for life.
</p>
<p>20.2  The Cosmological Constant Problem
</p>
<p>We now come to the most striking fine-tuning of all. The observed acceler-
ated expansion of the universe is caused by a vacuum energy (mass) density, 
or cosmological constant, which is about twice the average density of matter 
today, ρv &sim; 2ρm. This value is in blatant conflict with theoretical expecta-
tions.
</p>
<p>20.2.1  The Dynamic Quantum Vacuum
</p>
<p>When you think of a vacuum, you intuitively picture a state of pure &ldquo;empti-
ness&rdquo; or &ldquo;nothingness&rdquo;. However, quantum theory tells us that the vacuum 
is an inextinguishable sea of virtual particles that spontaneously appear and 
disappear. All particles in the Standard Model&mdash;electrons, quarks, photons, 
W-bosons, and so on&mdash;are relentlessly fluctuating in and out of existence. 
Although these virtual particles are very short lived, they have important and 
measurable effects.3 Most importantly, they contribute to the energy density 
of the vacuum. The problem is, however, that calculations of the resulting 
vacuum energy density give values that are absurdly large, ρv &sim; 10
</p>
<p>120
ρm (see 
</p>
<p>the box at the end of this section). So we seem to have a mismatch between 
theory and observation that is about 120 orders of magnitude! This has been 
called &ldquo;the worst prediction in physics&rdquo;, &ldquo;the mother of all physics prob-
lems&rdquo;, or less dramatically, the &ldquo;cosmological constant problem&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>3One of these is the Casimir effect which predicts that there will be an attractive force between two 
uncharged parallel conducting plates in a vacuum. The reason is that electromagnetic field fluctuations 
are restricted between the plates and unrestricted outside them. This results in more pressure from the 
outside pushing the plates towards one another. This effect has been measured. Also, the energy levels 
of the hydrogen atom have been measured and agree with the theory to a very high precision if we take 
into account the virtual particles which swarm inside the hydrogen atom.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Why is the observed value of the vacuum energy density so small? Is it 
possible that some mechanism could cause contributions from different par-
ticle species to cancel one another? It turns out that fermions and bosons do 
indeed contribute to the vacuum energy density with opposite signs. Bosons 
have a positive contribution and fermions contribute a negative energy den-
sity.4 But these contributions would need to cancel precisely to the 120th 
decimal point in order to predict a value that is as low as measured by the 
supernovae observations. Such a precise cancellation would be a dramatic 
example of fine-tuning.
</p>
<p>20.2.2  Fine-Tuned for Life?
</p>
<p>Let us now see what would happen if the value of the cosmological constant 
were very different from what it actually is. Suppose first that ρv is positive 
and is 1000 times greater than ρm. It would still be 117 orders of magnitude 
below its theoretically expected value.
</p>
<p>The vacuum energy would then start dominating the universe at 
t &sim; 0.5 Byr. At that time, galaxy formation was just beginning and only 
very small galaxies had enough time to form. But once the vacuum energy 
dominates, galaxy formation comes to a halt. The problem with miniature 
galaxies is that their gravity is too weak to keep heavy elements expelled in 
supernova explosions from flying away into outer space. Thus the galaxies 
would be left without the elements necessary for the formation of planets 
and for the evolution of life. If we further increase ρv by another factor of 
100, then it would come to dominate well before the epoch of galaxy forma-
tion, and the universe would be left with no galaxies at all.
</p>
<p>Suppose now that ρv is negative and has magnitude 1000 times greater 
than ρm. Then the gravity of the vacuum would be attractive and would 
cause the universe to contract and collapse to a big crunch at t &sim; 0.5 Byr. 
This is hardly enough time for the evolution of intelligent life (which took 
about 10 times longer here on Earth). A further increase in the magnitude of 
ρv would make the lifetime of the universe even shorter and the evolution of 
life and intelligence even less likely.
</p>
<p>4The reason for this difference is that fermions are mathematically described by so-called Grassmann 
numbers, which are rather different from ordinary numbers. When you multiply ordinary numbers, the 
result does not depend on the ordering of the factors; for example, 3 &times; 5 = 5 &times; 3. But for Grassmann 
numbers the product changes sign under factor ordering: a &times; b = &minus;b &times; a.

</p>
<p>Virtual particles and vacuum energy density
</p>
<p>According to quantum physics, the vacuum is awash with virtual particles con-
stantly popping in and out of existence. Particles and antiparticles appear in 
pairs and almost instantly annihilate. The lifetime of a virtual pair �t depends 
on the energy of the particles E: the higher the energy, the shorter is the life-
time. Quantitatively, this can be expressed as E &middot; �t &sim; �, where � is the 
Planck constant. Virtual particles move at nearly the speed of light, so the 
whole process occurs on a length scale L &sim; c�t &sim; �c/E. Space is packed 
with virtual pairs, and once a pair annihilates, another instantly appears in its 
place. So, if you look at a small cubic region of size L at any time, you are likely 
to find a pair of particles with energies E &sim; �c/L.
</p>
<p>The energy density due to the virtual particles can now be estimated by 
dividing the energy E by the volume L3:
</p>
<p>E/L3&sim;�c/L4
</p>
<p>As L is decreased, the energy density grows, indicating that energetic pairs 
popping out on smaller distance scales give a greater contribution to the vac-
uum energy density. As we include virtual pairs on smaller and smaller scales, 
the energy density appears to grow without bound.
</p>
<p>However, there may be a limit to how small the length L can be. At super-
small distances, quantum gravity effects become significant and the geometry 
of spacetime undergoes large quantum fluctuations. Below a certain character-
istic distance, spacetime acquires a chaotic, foam-like structure (see Fig. 20.2). 
We can estimate this distance scale using dimensional analysis. It can only 
depend on the fundamental constants �, c and G, and the only combination of 
these constants that has the dimension of length is
</p>
<p>ℓp =
</p>
<p>&radic;
</p>
<p>�G
</p>
<p>c3
</p>
<p>This is the Planck length, which we introduced in Sect. 19.1. On much larger 
scales, the spacetime appears to be smooth, just as the foamy surface of the 
ocean appears smooth when viewed from an airplane.
</p>
<p>The physics of spacetime foam is not well understood, but physicists expect 
the virtual pair production to cease on scales smaller than ℓp. (This fits well 
with string theory, where the typical size of vibrating strings is ~ℓp.) The vac-
uum energy density can then be estimated by setting L &sim; ℓp in Eq. (20.1) and 
the corresponding mass density can be obtained by further dividing by c2:
</p>
<p>ρv &sim;
c
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>�G2
&sim; 1097 kg/m3
</p>
<p>This is greater than the observed vacuum energy density by a factor of 
about 10123.

<p>20.3  The Anthropic Principle
</p>
<p>Why are the constants of nature fine-tuned for life? There are a few ways to 
address this question, and we shall consider them in turn.
</p>
<p>1. The universe is what it is. The constants have to have some values, and 
they just happen to be consistent with life. We simply got lucky. This is 
not very satisfactory: getting lucky many times in a row calls for an expla-
nation. And a fine-tuning by 120 orders of magnitude is hard to dismiss 
as simply an accident.
</p>
<p>2. One day we will have a complete theory of physics that will allow us to 
calculate all the parameters from first principles. We just have to buckle 
down and keep working towards such an understanding. But how likely 
are the constants derived from the fundamental theory to fall in the nar-
row ranges allowing life to exist? If they do, that would be a tremendous 
stroke of luck. Once again, it would not be satisfactory to leave it unex-
plained.
</p>
<p>3. The constants were fine-tuned by a benevolent creator, just so we can 
exist. There is often a temptation to invoke God whenever we encounter 
something that seems very hard to explain. But this &ldquo;God of the gaps&rdquo; 
approach has a poor success record in science. Isaac Newton, for instance, 
suggested that a supernatural deity was responsible for sustaining a homo-
geneous distribution of stars against gravitational collapse and for the fact 
that the planets are &ldquo;opaque&rdquo; and the stars &ldquo;luminous&rdquo;. Of course, it has 
been a great triumph of science to discover the expansion of the universe 
and to explain how thermonuclear reactions cause an opaque body to 
become a luminous star.

</p>
<p>4. Finally, there is a possibility that the constants of nature can take on a 
variety of different values, which can be realized in distant parts of the 
universe beyond our horizon. Then we should not be surprised to find 
ourselves living in a special corner of the universe which has constants of 
nature that are hospitable to life. We cannot live in environments that are 
not bio-friendly&mdash;even if most of the universe is of this sort. We live only 
where we can! This is the so-called &ldquo;anthropic principle&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the anthropic principle at work, let us think about the Solar 
System for a moment. About four centuries ago, when the Solar System was 
thought to be the universe, Johannes Kepler asked the following question: 
What determines the number of planets and their particular distances from 
the Sun? At that time only five planets were known, and Kepler was struck 
by the fact that this was exactly the number of highly symmetric polyhe-
drons, called Platonic solids.5 He came up with an elaborate construction 
where the solids were nested inside one another and suggested that their 
sizes were proportional to the radii of planetary orbits (see Fig. 20.3). But 
today it is obvious that Kepler was asking the wrong question. We have 
detected thousands of extrasolar planets, and we have every reason to expect 
that there are billions of them in the observable universe. The planets orbit 
their suns at a great variety of distances, but most of them are not well suited 
for the evolution of life. If our Earth were significantly closer or farther away 
from the Sun, the oceans would either boil or freeze, and life of our kind 
would be impossible. The reason why we live on a planet that is &ldquo;hospitably&rdquo; 
located is simply because we can&rsquo;t live on a planet at an inhospitable dis-
tance. If the Solar System were the only one in the universe, then it would 
be very mysterious that it contains a bio friendly planet. But if there are 
many types of planets with varied conditions, then it is not so surprising 
that some of them have environmental factors that are hospitable to life&mdash;
and it is common sense that we live on such a planet.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if we are living in a multiverse, where there are many distant 
regions that have different constants of nature, then it is not at all surprising 
that we find ourselves in a very special place with &ldquo;fine-tuned&rdquo; parameter 
values. We simply can&rsquo;t live anywhere else. In the multiverse context, asking 
why a given parameter has a specific value is to ask the wrong question&mdash;like

<p>The anthropic principle, which was introduced in 1974 by the Australian 
born astrophysicist Brandon Carter, has a dubious reputation among physi-
cists. On the one hand, the principle is trivially true (we cannot live where 
life is impossible), and its application to our location in the Solar System is 
uncontroversial. On the other hand, its use for explaining the fine-tuning of 
the constants of nature has often been viewed with great suspicion.
</p>
<p>20.4  Pros and Cons of Anthropic Explanations
</p>
<p>Anthropic explanations assume the existence of a multiverse consisting of 
remote domains where the constants of nature take different values. In the 
1970s this assumption appeared to be rather far-fetched, but this has now 
changed due to subsequent developments in particle physics and cosmol-
ogy. Modern particle theories predict the existence of multiple vacuum states 
with diverse properties, and eternal inflation provides a mechanism for pop-
ulating the universe with large regions of all possible vacua.

</p>
<p>Furthermore, to explain the fine-tuning of the vacuum energy density ρv,  
the number of vacua in the energy landscape of the theory should be enor-
mous. To understand why, let us imagine a long ribbon representing possible 
values of ρv, from &minus;10
</p>
<p>120
ρm to +10
</p>
<p>120
ρm. At the center of the ribbon is a 
</p>
<p>minuscule anthropic range, between &minus;103ρm and +10
3
ρm, where life is pos-
</p>
<p>sible. Now, we want the number of vacua in the landscape to be sufficiently 
large, so that some of them happen to be located in the anthropic range. If 
we randomly throw a dart at the ribbon, the probability that it will hit the 
anthropic range is completely negligible,
</p>
<p>We will have to make more than 10117 attempts before we can expect to 
have a successful hit. Similarly, we need an energy landscape of more than 
10
</p>
<p>117 vacua for the anthropic explanation of ρv to be successful.
Energy landscapes of grand unified theories typically include only a few 
</p>
<p>vacua and fall far short of the mark, and this is where string theory comes to 
the rescue. As we discussed in Chap. 19, the energy landscape of string the-
ory is estimated to have &sim;10500 vacua. This completely dwarfs the required 
number 10117. With such an immense landscape, we can expect to have goo-
gols of vacua in the anthropic range (see Question 7).
</p>
<p>The anthropic principle has often been dismissed as being unpredictive 
and untestable&mdash;a philosophical cop out. It gives a ready explanation for any 
values of the constants of nature that we can measure, but does not seem to 
provide any means to verify that this explanation is correct. Today, however, 
many physicists are realizing that anthropic arguments may in fact lead to 
testable predictions, as we shall discuss in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>Summary
In our observable universe there are roughly 30 constants of nature that 
have been measured empirically. Despite their best efforts, physicists have 
not been able to derive the values of these parameters from first principles. 
Interestingly, a relatively small change to the value of any of the constants 
tends to lead to a universe that is inhospitable to life. How can we explain 
this fine-tuning?
</p>
<p>One possibility is that the constants of nature can take on a variety of dif-
ferent values, which can be realized in distant parts of the universe beyond 
our horizon. Then it is no surprise that we live in a fertile zone that has con-
stants of nature that are hospitable to life. We cannot live in environments

<p>According to the multiverse worldview, the constants of nature vary from 
one part of the universe to another. In some regions the constants allow for 
the existence of life, and that is where observers will evolve and those con-
stants will be measured. Observers in different regions will generally meas-
ure different values of the constants. We don&rsquo;t know a priori what kind of 
region we live in, so we cannot predict the local values of the constants with 
certainty. However, it may be possible to make statistical predictions. Some 
region types may be more numerous or more densely populated than oth-
ers, and we are more likely to find ourselves in one of these more populous 
regions.

<p>21.1  The Bell Curve
</p>
<p>If you have ever taken a large introductory college course, you have prob-
ably wondered if you are being graded on a &ldquo;curve&rdquo;. The curve of course, is 
the so-called &ldquo;bell curve&rdquo; (see Fig. 21.1). What does the bell curve represent? 
Let&rsquo;s suppose the same final exam is given to a class of 300 students, every 
year for 20 years. If you were to randomly pick a name from a hat (con-
taining the names of all students who have taken the class), what grade do 
you expect that student to have attained on their final exam? You would be 
surprised if the student&rsquo;s grade were, say, in the top or bottom 1% of the 
class. If the teacher supplied you with a set of data plotting the results of 
students who took that final for the last 20 years, as shown in Fig. 21.1, you

<p>would be able to make more accurate predictions. If you discard the 2.5% of 
students who got the highest and lowest grades, then with 95% confidence 
you can say that a randomly picked student got a grade in the remaining 
95% range (that is, between 20 and 80 out of 100 in the example shown 
in Fig. 21.1). This means that if you were to pick name after name, then 
95% of the time you would pick students who scored in the aforementioned 
range. This is called a prediction at 95% confidence level. In order to make a 
99% confidence prediction, you would have to discard 0.5% at both ends of 
the distribution. As the confidence level is increased, your chances of being 
wrong get smaller, but the predicted range of grades gets wider and the pre-
diction less interesting.
</p>
<p>21.2  The Principle of Mediocrity
</p>
<p>A similar technique can be applied to make predictions for the constants of 
nature. Suppose for a moment that there is a Universal Super Observer who 
can survey all of spacetime and measure anything she wants. The USO looks 
around and sees many different regions of the universe with different values 
for the constants of nature. She decides to count the number of observers 
who live in regions that have different values of a certain constant, call it X. 
To isolate the effect of varying X, she focuses on regions where the other 
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.1 Grade distribution of students in a large class. The number of students 
whose grades are within a specific range is proportional to the area under the 
corresponding piece of the curve. The median grade is 50 points. This means 
that half of the students got grades above, and the other half below, this value. 
The shaded tails represent the lowest and highest 2.5%. The range of grades 
between the two shaded areas is predicted at 95% confidence level</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>constants have nearly the same values and only X changes from one region 
to another.1 The USO finds that some of the regions contain many observ-
ers, some only a few, and others have none. She can then plot the number 
of observers who will measure various values of X. The resulting  distribution 
will most likely be similar to a bell curve. If the USO graciously gives us 
the distribution, we could discard 2.5% at both of its ends and make a 95% 
confidence level prediction for the value of X measured by a randomly 
selected observer.
</p>
<p>What would be the use of such a prediction? Obviously, we would not 
be able to test it directly&mdash;we can&rsquo;t &ldquo;pick up the phone&rdquo; and ask randomly 
selected observers to disclose their measurements&mdash;because all regions with 
different values of X are beyond our horizon. What we can do, though, is 
to think of ourselves as having been randomly selected. Since we have no a 
priori reason to believe that the values of the constants in our region are unu-
sually large or small, or otherwise very special, it makes sense to assume that 
we are typical, or unexceptional observers. This assumption is called the prin-
ciple of mediocrity. If there are some constants of nature that we have not yet 
measured, and if we have somehow obtained the statistical distribution for 
their values measured by all the observers in the multiverse, we can use the 
principle of mediocrity to predict that the values of the constants in our local 
region should correspond to the range around the peak of the distribution.
</p>
<p>But where are we going to get the distribution? In lieu of a cooperative 
USO, we will have to derive it from our theory of the multiverse. If the 
resulting predictions agree with our measurements, this would provide evi-
dence supporting the theory; if not, the theory can be ruled out at a speci-
fied confidence level.
</p>
<p>21.3  Obtaining the Distribution by Counting 
Observers
</p>
<p>Let us now discuss how the distribution of the constants measured by ran-
domly picked observers can be derived from the theory. We have to count 
the number of observers in regions with different constants. In order to do 
</p>
<p>1If the vacuum landscape is indeed as rich as string theory suggests, it will include vacua with practically 
any values of the constants. So the USO will have no problem finding regions where X varies while the 
other constants are nearly fixed.

</p>
<p>so, we need to know the density of observers in each environment, and the 
corresponding volume. The volume factor can in principle be calculated 
from the theory of inflation (we&rsquo;ll discuss this in Sect. 21.5). However, since 
we are mostly ignorant about the evolution of life and intelligence, how can 
we hope to calculate the density of observers that may arise in different envi-
ronments?
</p>
<p>For starters, we should note that some constants of nature are &ldquo;life-chang-
ing&rdquo; and some are &ldquo;life-neutral&rdquo;. A &ldquo;life-changing&rdquo; constant is one that 
directly affects the physics and chemistry of life, and thus directly impinges 
on the ability of life to evolve and thrive within a galaxy. Examples of life-
changing constants include the electron mass and the gravitational constant. 
On the other hand, a &ldquo;life-neutral&rdquo; constant is one that, as long as there are 
galaxies around, does not directly influence the ability of life to emerge. For 
example, the cosmological constant and the magnitude of the  primordial 
density fluctuations are life-neutral constants. As long as their values lie 
within the windows that permit the formation of galaxies in a region, they 
do not influence the density of observers within any galaxy.2
</p>
<p>At the present level of understanding, we can only attempt to calculate 
the distributions of life-neutral constants. Furthermore, our ignorance about 
the emergence of life can be factored out if we focus on those regions where 
the life-changing constants have the same values as in our neighborhood, 
and only the life-neutral constants are different. All galaxies in such regions 
will have about the same number of observers, and thus to compare the den-
sity of observers in different regions, we only need to compare the density 
of galaxies. In other words, we can use the density of galaxies as a proxy for the 
density of observers. We shall now discuss how this approach was used to pre-
dict the value of the cosmological constant.
</p>
<p>21.4  Predicting the Cosmological Constant
</p>
<p>The anthropic bound on the cosmological constant ρv specifies the value 
above which the vacuum energy would dominate too soon for any viable 
galaxies to form. In regions where ρv is near this bound, galaxy formation 
is barely possible, and the density of galaxies is very low. But most observers 
</p>
<p>2This is a bit of an oversimplification. Some properties of galaxies may in fact change due to variation of 
life-neutral constants. For example, if the density fluctuations get larger, galaxies form earlier and have a 
higher density of matter. As a result, close encounters between stars, which can disrupt planetary orbits 
and extinguish life, become more common.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>will not live in these lonely places; they will live in regions that are teeming 
with galaxies. Thus, if we assume that we are typical observers, we should 
expect to live in one of the galaxy-rich regions and to measure a cosmologi-
cal constant that is significantly lower than the anthropic bound.
</p>
<p>21.4.1  Rough Estimate
</p>
<p>A rough estimate of the expected value of ρv can be obtained as follows. Let 
us consider a large ensemble of regions where ρv takes a variety of values, 
while the other constants are very close to what they are in our local neigh-
borhood. Depending on the value of ρv, the vacuum energy in these regions 
will start dominating at different times tv, or different redshifts zv. Once 
the vacuum energy dominates, galaxy formation comes to a halt, so regions 
where the vacuum domination occurs after only a few galaxies have had a 
chance to form, will have sparse observers.
</p>
<p>As we discussed in Chap. 12, galaxy formation proceeds in a hierarchi-
cal manner, with smaller clumps merging to form larger and larger struc-
tures. Large galaxies like ours, massive enough to efficiently form stars and 
to retain the heavy elements dispersed in supernova explosions, are formed 
at redshifts z &sim; 2 or later. In galaxy-rich regions the vacuum domination 
should occur at a later time, and thus we must have zv &lt; 2 (Remember: 
smaller redshifts correspond to later times.). Now, the density of matter at 
z = 2 is ρm = (1 + z)
</p>
<p>3ρm0 = 27ρm0, where ρm0 is the present value of ρm.
Requiring that the vacuum energy does not dominate at this epoch, we 
</p>
<p>obtain (see Sect. 5.1 in Chap. 5)
</p>
<p>The values of ρv measured by most observers in the multiverse living in envi-
ronments similar to ours are expected to satisfy this condition.
</p>
<p>21.4.2  The Distribution
</p>
<p>The probability distribution for the values of ρv measured by randomly picked 
observers requires a more careful calculation. The result of such a calcula-
tion is plotted in Fig. 21.2. The distribution is peaked at ρv &sim; 3ρv0, where 
ρv0 &sim; 2ρm0 is the observed value, and the 95% confidence range is between 
&sim;0.1ρv0 and &sim;20ρv0. Values of ρv &gt; 20ρv0 are not likely to be observed 
because there are very few galaxies in the corresponding regions. Very small

</p>
<p>values of ρv &lt; 0.1ρv0 are also unlikely, simply because this range of val-
ues is so narrow. A value in this range would amount to unnecessary fine- 
tuning; that is, a fine-tuning even more severe than required by the anthropic 
 considerations.
</p>
<p>Throughout this section, we implicitly assumed that ρv &gt; 0. A similar 
analysis can be performed for negative values of ρv, with very similar con-
clusions. The main difference is that the bound on large negative values of 
ρv &lt; &minus;20ρv0 comes from requiring that the universe does not collapse to a 
big crunch before some galaxies manage to form.
</p>
<p>Anthropic bounds on ρv were first derived in 1987 by Steven Weinberg 
and by Andrei Linde. A prediction based on the principle of mediocrity 
was made by Vilenkin in 1995 and was later refined by George Efstathiou 
(1995) and by Hugo Martel, Paul Shapiro and Weinberg (1998). At the 
time anthropic arguments were highly unpopular,3 and it came as a com-
plete surprise to most physicists when a vacuum energy density of roughly

</p>
<p>3The referee of the Astrophysical Journal objected to publishing papers based on anthropic reasoning, 
so in order for Martel Shapiro and Weinberg to get their 1998 paper accepted, they had to convince 
the editor, that if ρv was ever measured to be below a certain value, this would show that anthropic 
reasoning could not explain it. Of course, the value of ρv turned out to be just in the sweet spot for an 
anthropic explanation to make perfect sense.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the expected magnitude was detected in supernova observations in 1998. As 
of now, no viable alternative explanations for the observed value of ρv have 
been proposed. This may be our first observational evidence for the existence 
of a multiverse (Fig. 21.3).
</p>
<p>21.5  The Measure Problem
</p>
<p>In order to calculate the probability distribution for values of a certain con-
stant measured by randomly picked observers, we need to know the frac-
tion4 of volume of the universe where various values of the constants are 
realized, and also the density of observers in each of these environments. For 
life-neutral constants the density of observers is proportional to the  density

</p>
<p>of galaxies, which can be calculated in a relatively straightforward way. 
However, the calculation of the volume fraction presents a serious problem.
</p>
<p>The problem arises because the volumes of all kinds of environments in 
the multiverse grow without bound and become infinite in the limit. So, to 
find the fraction of the volume occupied by a given environment we have to 
compare infinities, and this is a mathematically ambiguous task. This can be 
illustrated by a simple example of an infinite sequence of integers:
</p>
<p>We can ask: What fraction of the integers are odd? You probably guessed &frac12;. 
Indeed, if we take N numbers in a row, the fraction of odd numbers will be 
close to &frac12; for large N and will exactly equal &frac12; in the limit of infinite N.
</p>
<p>But if you reorder the sequence so that each odd integer is followed by 
two even integers,
</p>
<p>then the answer would be 1/3 (even though this sequence contains all the 
same integers as the natural ordering). In fact, by reordering the sequence 
one can obtain any answer to this question between 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>In this particular example the ambiguity can be avoided by requiring 
that the natural order of integers should be used. The answer is then &frac12;, as 
one intuitively expects. We could try to adopt a similar prescription for the 
volume fraction in the multiverse, using the natural ordering of events in 
time. This would amount to including only the regions (e.g., bubble uni-
verses) that were formed prior to a certain time t. The problem is, however, 
that the result depends on how time is defined in different places. There is 
no unique, or preferred way to do so in general relativity. One can use, for 
example, the time measured by the clocks of local observers; this is called the 
proper time measure. Alternatively, one could use the expansion of the uni-
verse as a measure of time. Equal times would then correspond to equal val-
ues of the scale factor; this is referred to as the scale factor measure. There is 
an infinity of possible choices, and thus the volume fraction remains ambig-
uous. This ambiguity is known as the measure problem.
</p>
<p>Cosmologists have studied different measure prescriptions and found that 
some of them lead to paradoxes or to a conflict with the data and should 
therefore be discarded. For instance, the proper time measure performed 
rather poorly, while the scale factor measure has successfully passed all tests

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>so far.5 It is unlikely, however, that this kind of analysis will yield a unique 
prescription for the probabilities. This suggests that some important element 
may be missing in our understanding of cosmic inflation.
</p>
<p>Some people feel the measure problem is so grave that it puts the validity 
of the theory of inflation seriously in doubt. But this is the view of only a 
small minority of cosmologists. The situation with the theory of inflation is 
similar to that with Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution some 100 years ago. Both 
theories greatly expanded the range of scientific inquiry, proposing an expla-
nation for something that was previously believed impossible to explain. In 
both cases, the explanation was compelling, and no viable alternatives have 
been suggested. Darwin&rsquo;s theory was widely accepted, even though some 
important aspects remained unclear before the discovery of the genetic code. 
The theory of inflation may be similarly incomplete and may require addi-
tional new ideas. But it also has a similar air of inevitability.
</p>
<p>21.6  The Doomsday Argument and the Future 
of Our Civilization
</p>
<p>The principle of mediocrity has been used in many different contexts. As 
an example, suppose you are presented with a bag containing N cards. You 
know the cards are labeled 1 through N, but you don&rsquo;t know what N is. 
Now you draw one card at random and see number 15 written on it. Based 
on this, how would you estimate the total number of cards N?
</p>
<p>The principle of mediocrity suggests that your card is not likely to be 
from the very beginning or the very end of the list and comes most likely 
from somewhere in the middle. Then your best estimate is N = 30. If you 
want to make a 90% confidence prediction, this would be 16 &lt; N &lt; 300. 
(Can you figure out how we obtained these numbers?). You can make a 
more accurate prediction if you draw more than one card. The Allied forces 
used a similar method during World War II to estimate the total number of 
German tanks based on the serial numbers of the tanks that they captured.
</p>
<p>If we imagine giving a &ldquo;serial number&rdquo; to every person at birth, we can 
use the same reasoning to predict the total number of humans who will ever 
live. The number of people who have lived on Earth since the origin of our

<p>5The distribution for the cosmological constant in Fig. 21.2 was calculated using the scale factor meas-
ure. In fact, analysis shows that this distribution is not very sensitive to the choice of measure, so the 
prediction for the cosmological constant is rather robust and is not expected to change much when the 
measure problem is finally resolved.

<p>species is about 100 billion, so our best estimate is that 200 billion people 
will ever live. If the world birth rate stabilizes at its current value (130 mil-
lion births per year), this number will be reached in less than 800 years.
</p>
<p>This is the notorious &ldquo;doomsday argument&rdquo;, first presented by Brandon 
Carter in 1983. The argument becomes more subtle and the prediction 
less gloomy if one takes into account the existence of multiple other civili-
zations in the universe. It should be noted that the doomsday argument is 
rather controversial and many people believe that the principle of mediocrity 
should not be used in this context (Fig. 21.4).

<p>21.6.1  Large and Small Civilizations
</p>
<p>For any civilization confined to a single planet, the prospects of long-term 
survival are rather bleak. It can be destroyed by an asteroid impact or a 
nearby supernova explosion, or it can self-destruct in a nuclear war. It is not 
a matter of if but rather of when the disaster will strike, and the only sure

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>way for the civilization to survive in the long run is to spread beyond its 
native planet and colonize space.
</p>
<p>An advanced civilization may colonize nearby planetary systems. The col-
onies may then spread further, until the entire galaxy is colonized. It is con-
ceivable that civilizations could expand even beyond their native galaxies.
</p>
<p>The probability for a civilization to survive the existential challenges and 
colonize its galaxy may be small, but it is non-zero, and in a vast universe 
such civilizations should certainly exist. We shall call them large civilizations. 
There will also be small civilizations which die out before they spread much 
beyond their native planets.
</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let us assume that small civilizations do not 
grow much larger than ours and die soon after they reach their maxi-
mum size. The total number of individuals who lived in such a civilization 
throughout its entire history is then comparable to the number of people 
who ever lived on Earth, about 100 billion.
</p>
<p>A large civilization contains a much greater number of individuals. A gal-
axy like ours has about 100 billion stars and about 20% of the stars have 
habitable planets (see Sect. 13.5). This amounts to 20 billion habitable plan-
ets per galaxy. Assuming that each planet will reach a population similar to 
that of the Earth, we get &sim;2 &times; 1021 individuals. The numbers can be much 
higher if the civilization spreads well beyond its galaxy. The crucial question 
is: what is the probability P for a civilization to become large?
</p>
<p>It takes more than 1010 small civilizations to provide the same number 
of individuals as a single large civilization. Thus, unless P is extremely small 
(less than 10&minus;10), individuals live predominantly in large civilizations. That&rsquo;s 
where we should expect to find ourselves if we are typical inhabitants of the 
universe. Furthermore, a typical member of a large civilization should expect 
to live at a time when the civilization is close to its maximum size, since that 
is when most of its inhabitants are going to live.
</p>
<p>These expectations are in glaring conflict with what we actually observe: 
we either live in a small civilization or at the very beginning of a large civili-
zation. With the assumption that P is not very small, both of these options 
are very unlikely&mdash;which indicates that the assumption is probably wrong. If 
indeed we are typical observers in the universe, then we have to conclude that 
the probability P for a civilization to survive long enough to become large 
must be very tiny. In our example, it cannot be much more than 10&minus;10.

<p>The Doomsday argument is statistical in nature. It does not predict anything 
about our civilization in particular. All it says is that the odds for any given

<p>324     21 The Principle of Mediocrity
</p>
<p>civilization to grow large are very low. At the same time, some rare civiliza-
tions do beat the odds.
</p>
<p>What distinguishes these exceptional civilizations? Apart from pure luck, 
civilizations that dedicate a substantial part of their resources to space colo-
nization, start the colonization process early, and do not stop, stand a better 
chance of long-term survival. With many other diverse and pressing needs, 
this strategy may be difficult to implement, but this may be one of the rea-
sons why large civilizations are so rare.
</p>
<p>One question that needs to be addressed is: why is our Galaxy not yet col-
onized? There are stars in the Galaxy that are billions of years older than our 
Sun, and it may take less than a million years for an advanced civilization 
to colonize the entire Galaxy. So, we are faced with Enrico Fermi&rsquo;s famous 
question: Where are they? A possible answer is that we may be the only 
intelligent civilization in our Galaxy and maybe even in the entire observ-
able universe. Evolution of life and intelligence may require some extremely 
improbable events, as we discussed in Chap. 13. Their probability may be 
so low that the nearest planet with intelligent life could be far beyond our 
horizon.
</p>
<p>Summary
If the constants of nature vary from one part of the universe to another, their 
local values cannot be predicted with certainty, but we can still make statisti-
cal predictions.
</p>
<p>We have no a priori reason to believe that the values of the constants in 
our region are particularly special, so it makes sense to assume that we are 
typical, or unexceptional observers. This assumption is called the principle 
of mediocrity. It suggests that the probability for us to measure certain values 
of the constants in our local region is the same as for a randomly picked 
observer in the multiverse. Even though our understanding of the multiverse 
is rather incomplete, in some special cases we can calculate probabilities 
from the theory of eternal inflation.
</p>
<p>This strategy was applied to the cosmological constant and led to a predic-
tion, which was later confirmed by the 1998 Supernova observations. This 
could be our first evidence for the existence of the multiverse.
</p>
<p>In general, making statistical predictions in the multiverse is notoriously 
difficult. The problem is that an eternally inflating spacetime will produce 
an infinite number of all kinds of regions. So comparing the relative likeli-
hood of one type versus another involves a comparison of infinite numbers. 
Cosmologists have attempted to regulate these infinities, in order to make 
sensible predictions, but in general the issue is still unresolved.</p>

<p>Questions
1. At the end of Chap. 9 we noted the remarkable fact that we live at a very 
</p>
<p>special epoch when the density of matter is comparable to that of the vac-
uum: ρm &sim; ρv. At much earlier times ρm was much greater and in the 
distant future it will be much smaller than ρv. Can you explain this fact 
using anthropic arguments? (For a complete explanation, you may need 
to know that the lifetime of a star like our Sun is about 10 Gyr.)
</p>
<p>2. Which of the following parameters are life-changing and which are life-
neutral: the electron charge, the neutrino mass, the strength of strong 
nuclear force, the large-scale curvature of the universe.
</p>
<p>3. In some region of the multiverse the density of matter is measured to be 
the same as in our neighborhood, while the vacuum energy density is 
ρv = 8ρm0. At what redshift zv did the vacuum dominated era begin in 
this region?
</p>
<p>4. A population survey on some planet revealed that 5% of its territory is 
occupied by cities, 75% by rural areas, and the remaining 20% is not 
suitable for living. The population density (that is, the number of inhabit-
ants per square kilometer) is 50 times higher in cities than in rural areas. 
What is the probability that a randomly picked inhabitant lives in a city? 
(This problem illustrates how volume fractions can be used to calculate 
probabilities.)
</p>
<p>5. What ordering of integers would yield the fraction of odd integers equal 
to 2/3? Is this ordering unique, or can you find other orderings that give 
the same answer?
</p>
<p>6. Considering that the number of people who have ever lived is presently 
about 100 billion, use the doomsday argument to estimate the number of 
people who will ever live on Earth at 90% confidence level.
</p>
<p>7. (a) Are you persuaded by the doomsday argument? If not, what do you 
think is wrong with it?
</p>
<p> (b) Suppose humans will use bioengineering to evolve into some more 
advanced species within a few hundred years from now. Would the 
doomsday argument still apply?

<p>We have studied the early universe, its evolution, and its eternally inflating 
future. We are now poised to revisit a question that people have grappled 
with from the dawn of humanity: Did the universe have a beginning? Or 
has it always existed?
</p>
<p>22.1  A Universe that Always Existed?
</p>
<p>The notion that the universe has always existed is very appealing. It allows one 
to circumvent the avalanche of seemingly unassailable questions  associated 
with the beginning of the universe. What caused the universe to appear? 
&ldquo;Who/what&rdquo; sets the initial conditions for the universe? Where did the &ldquo;who/
what&rdquo; come from? This line of questioning is the endless regression that has 
haunted theologians, philosophers and scientists for millennia.
</p>
<p>To address this issue, we need to investigate if it is possible to scientifically 
describe a universe that is eternal to the past as well as the future. Let&rsquo;s begin 
by remembering that the steady state theory was of this sort. Observations 
favored the rival big bang, and the steady state theory was discarded. What if 
we consider an oscillating universe that undergoes a perpetual cycle of expan-
sion and contraction&mdash;with a big bang followed by a big crunch followed 
by a big bang and so on? Such oscillating models were briefly considered 
in the 1930s, but soon they were found to be inconsistent with the second 
law of thermodynamics. The second law stipulates that each cycle of cos-
mic expansion is accompanied by an increase in entropy. If the universe had

<p>328     22 Did the Universe Have a Beginning?
</p>
<p>undergone an infinite number of cycles in its past, the entropy would have 
reached its maximal value, and the universe would be in a state of thermal 
equilibrium. But we do not find ourselves in such a state. This is similar to 
the &ldquo;heat death&rdquo; problem of an eternal static universe that we mentioned in 
Sect. 5.1.1.
</p>
<p>In 2002 Paul Steinhart and Neil Turok introduced a new version of the 
oscillating model, which they called &ldquo;the cyclic universe&rdquo;. As in the older 
models, each cycle begins with an expanding fireball. As the fireball expands, 
it cools, galaxies form and then a period of vacuum domination ensues. 
Once vacuum domination sets in, the universe begins to expand exponen-
tially. This exponential expansion is very slow&mdash;it takes about 10 billion 
years for the universe to double in size. After trillions of years, the  expansion 
slows down and eventually stops and turns into contraction. When the 
collapse is complete, the universe bounces back to start yet another cycle. 
In this scenario the universe has eternally been undergoing a sequence of 
expansion and contraction, and there seems to be no need for a beginning.1
</p>
<p>But what about the problem of entropy that plagued the original oscillating 
models? In Steinhardt and Turok&rsquo;s scenario, the amount of expansion in a cycle 
exceeds the amount of contraction, so the overall volume of the universe grows. 
The entropy of our observable region is now the same as the entropy of a sim-
ilar region in the preceding cycle, but the entropy of the entire universe has 
increased&mdash;simply because the volume has increased. The growth of volume 
and entropy are both unbounded, and thus the state of maximum entropy is 
never reached&mdash;it does not exist.
</p>
<p>Another option for a universe without a beginning is suggested by eternal 
inflation. Most cosmologists think that a period of cosmic inflation preceded 
the big bang. Inflation ended in our local region, setting off a local big bang, 
but continues elsewhere. This naturally raises the question: is it possible that 
inflation and subsequent big bang events have been occurring in spacetime 
for all of past eternity? Perhaps our ancestral chain of bubble universes goes 
back to the infinite past?
</p>
<p>It turns out, however, that the idea of a past-eternal universe, either in 
cyclic or eternally inflating form, runs into a fatal obstruction&mdash;as we shall 
now discuss.
</p>
<p>1The cyclic model was introduced as an alternative to inflation, but it is far from being fully developed. 
To ensure a transition from expansion to contraction, the model requires a scalar field with a judi-
ciously designed energy landscape. It also gives no satisfactory description for the bounce from the big 
crunch to the big bang. So, as of now, it remains a work in progress.</p>

<p>22.2  The BGV Theorem
</p>
<p>In 2003, Arvind Borde of Long Island University, Alan Guth and Alex 
Vilenkin proved a theorem, which implies that even though inflation is eter-
nal to the future, it cannot be eternal to the past and must have had some 
sort of a beginning. Their conclusions also apply to an oscillating model, 
which must have had a beginning too.
</p>
<p>Borde, Guth and Vilenkin (BGV) investigated what an expanding uni-
verse would look like to imaginary observers who are recording their histo-
ries as they move through the universe under the influence of gravity and 
inertia. The observers are presumed to be indestructible, so if the universe 
had no beginning, the worldlines of all such observers should extend to the 
infinite past. However, BGV showed, under very plausible assumptions, that 
this is impossible.2
</p>
<p>To see why, let us imagine that the entire universe is sprinkled with a &ldquo;dust&rdquo; 
of inertial observers who are all moving away from one another. The existence 
of such a class of observers can be taken as the definition of an expanding uni-
verse. We will call these observers &ldquo;spectators&rdquo;. Now, let us consider another 
observer, the space traveler, who has been moving relative to the spectators 
for all eternity. The space traveler also moves by inertia, with his spaceship 
engines shut off. As he passes the spectators, they register his velocity.
</p>
<p>Since the spectators are flying apart, the space traveler&rsquo;s velocity relative 
to each successive spectator will be smaller than his velocity relative to the 
preceding one. Suppose, for example, the space traveler passes the Earth at 
100,000 km/s and is now headed towards a distant galaxy, about a billion 
light years away. Since that galaxy is moving away from us at 20,000 km/s, 
when the space traveler reaches it, the spectators there will see him moving 
at 80,000 km/s.
</p>
<p>If the velocity of the space traveler relative to the spectators gets smaller 
and smaller into the future, then his velocity should get larger and larger as 
we follow his history into the past. In the limit, his velocity approaches the 
speed of light. The key insight in the BGV paper is that this limiting velocity 
is reached in a finite time by the space traveler&rsquo;s clock. The reason is due to 
time dilation&mdash;remember moving clocks tick slower. As we go backward in 
time, the speed of the space traveler approaches that of light, and his clock 
</p>
<p>2The BGV theorem states that if the universe is, on average, expanding, then its history cannot be 
indefinitely continued into the past. The theorem allows for some periods of contraction, but on aver-
age expansion is assumed to prevail.
</p>
<p>22.2 The BGV Theorem     329</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>330     22 Did the Universe Have a Beginning?
</p>
<p>essentially freezes&mdash;from the spectator&rsquo;s point of view. The space traveler 
himself does not notice anything unusual&mdash;his time flows from one moment 
to the next. Like the histories of the spectators, the space traveler&rsquo;s history 
should extend into the infinite past.
</p>
<p>The fact that the time elapsed by the space traveler&rsquo;s clock is finite tells 
us that we do not have his full history. In technical language, physicists 
say that the space traveler&rsquo;s world line is incomplete. This means that some 
part of the past history of the universe is missing; it is not included in the 
model. Thus, the assumption that the entire spacetime can be covered by an 
expanding dust of observers has led to a contradiction, and therefore it can-
not be true.
</p>
<p>The BGV theorem is very general. It makes no assumptions about the 
material content of the universe and does not even assume that gravity is 
described by Einstein&rsquo;s equations. So, if Einstein&rsquo;s theory requires some mod-
ification, the theorem would still hold. The only assumption it makes is that 
the universe is expanding at some non-zero rate (no matter how small). This 
should be satisfied by any model of eternal inflation. Thus we are led to the 
conclusion that past-eternal inflation without a beginning is impossible.3
</p>
<p>Past-eternal cyclic models without a beginning are also ruled out. The vol-
ume of the universe increases in each cycle, hence the universe expands on 
average. This means that the space traveler&rsquo;s velocity increases on average as 
we go back in time, and approaches the speed of light in the limit. Thus the 
same conclusions apply.
</p>
<p>22.2.1  Where Does This Leave Us?
</p>
<p>In Chap. 7 we discussed how scientists were drawn to the steady state theory 
over the big bang, because it avoided the question of a cosmic beginning. 
However, despite philosophical prejudice, the data had spoken and scien-
tists had to press forward trying to uncover what they could about the uni-
verse in the context of the big bang model. Along the way they discovered 
inflation, and then eternal inflation. Our picture of the universe beginning 
with a one-time big bang event has given way to a much grander picture 
of an eternally inflating spacetime constantly spawning local big bangs. This 
worldview has the same spirit as the steady state theory, and many people 
once again hoped that maybe on a far greater scale the universe is indeed 
</p>
<p>3Note that it follows from the BGV theorem that the universe of the steady state model must also have 
a beginning.</p>

<p>eternal&mdash;with ancestor bubbles nucleating ad infinitum into the past. Now, 
however, we know that this is not possible. And once again, the beginning of 
the universe must be tackled head on.
</p>
<p>22.2.2  A Proof of God?
</p>
<p>Theologians and some religiously inclined scientists have often welcomed 
any evidence for the beginning of the universe, regarding it as evidence for 
the existence of God. On the other hand, a number of atheist scientists have 
argued that modern science leaves no room for God. A series of science-reli-
gion debates have been staged, with atheists like Richard Dawkins, Daniel 
Dennett and Lawrence Krauss combatting theists like William Lane Craig. 
The BGV theorem has often been raised as evidence for God by the theistic 
side.
</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that science can disprove the existence of God, espe-
cially considering that &ldquo;God&rdquo; means different things to different people. Are 
we talking about the God of the Hebrew Bible or the rationalistic God of 
Spinoza and Einstein? A scientific proof of God based on the BGV theorem 
appears even more dubious.
</p>
<p>The cosmological argument for the existence of God, dating back to 
Aquinas, consists of two parts. The first part is apparently very straightfor-
ward: &ldquo;Everything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to 
exist. Therefore, the universe has a cause.&rdquo; The second part affirms that the 
cause must be God. In the next chapter we will deconstruct this argument. 
We will argue that modern physics can describe the emergence of the uni-
verse as a physical process that does not require any supernatural cause.
</p>
<p>Summary
The Borde&ndash;Guth&ndash;Vilenkin theorem says that the history of any expand-
ing universe cannot be indefinitely continued into the past. An immediate 
implication is that inflation, even though it may be eternal to the future, 
cannot be eternal to the past and must have had a beginning.
</p>
<p>We are thus faced with the question of what happened before inflation. 
And whatever the answer is, we can keep asking: &ldquo;And what happened 
before that?&rdquo; Thus the question of how the universe began is still enveloped in 
a cocoon of mystery.

<p>If inflation is eternal, then the beginning of our local universe, about 14 
billion years ago, was preceded by an unknown number of ancestor bubble 
universes. Although we do not know how far back the chain goes, we now 
believe that there had to be a beginning (as discussed in Chap. 22). So, how 
did it all begin? Eternal inflation pushes the ultimate beginning so far back 
into the past that we are unlikely to ever have direct observational evidence 
helping us to answer this question. Yet it must be addressed. It is arguably 
the most profound mystery that exists and it is at the core of our cosmo-
logical yearning. Here we will try to elucidate the speculative yet scientific 
attempts to explain how an embryonic seed universe emerged.

<p>23.1  The Universe as a Quantum Fluctuation
</p>
<p>We have already learned that the vacuum is a frenzied place filled with vir-
tual particles and fields constantly fluctuating in and out of existence. Vacuum 
fluctuations live off borrowed energy for exceedingly small time intervals, in 
accordance with Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainty principle. For example, a sponta-
neously nucleated electron-positron pair will vanish in about a trillionth of a 
nanosecond. Heavier particle-antiparticle pairs live even briefer lives. If parti-
cles and antiparticles can spontaneously appear, why can&rsquo;t a fledgling universe?

University of New York, in the early 1970s.1 Tryon suggested that the entire

<p>334     23 Creation of Universes from Nothing
</p>
<p>universe emerged as a quantum fluctuation out of the quantum vacuum. Not 
surprisingly, this idea was taken as a joke at first&mdash;there is a gaping  difference 
between subatomic particles nucleating for about a trillionth of a  nanosecond 
(or less) and a massive universe appearing and lingering for billions of years! 
Nonetheless, Tryon realized that there are no physical laws that forbid this 
happenstance. You might be thinking &ldquo;But what about energy conservation?&rdquo; 
Surely Lucretius was correct when he said: &ldquo;Nothing can be created from noth-
ing&rdquo;. So how can a universe containing at least 1053 kg of matter  suddenly 
appear? Here Tryon invoked a well-known fact: closed universes have zero 
energy. We emphasized several times earlier in this book that gravitational 
energy is negative. And it follows from general relativity that in a closed universe 
the negative energy of gravity exactly balances the positive energy of matter, so 
the total energy is zero. Another conserved quantity is electric charge, and once 
again it turns out that the total charge must vanish in a closed universe.
</p>
<p>The latter statement is easy to understand using a two-dimensional analogy. 
Imagine a two-dimensional closed universe, which we can picture as the surface 
of a globe (see Fig. 23.1). Suppose we place a positive charge at the north pole of 
this universe. Then the lines of the electric field emanating from the charge will 
wrap around the sphere and converge at the south pole. This means that a nega-
tive charge of equal magnitude should be present there. Thus, we cannot add a 
positive charge to a closed universe without adding an equal negative charge at the 
same time. The total charge of a closed universe must therefore be equal to zero.
</p>
<p>Fig. 23.1 The total charge in a closed universe is zero. Field lines emanating 
from a positive charge at the north pole will converge at the south pole&mdash;thus 
there must be an equal negative charge at the south pole</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The creation of a closed universe out of the vacuum is illustrated in 
Fig. 23.2. A region of flat space begins to swell, taking the shape of a bal-
loon. At the same time, a large amount of matter is spontaneously created in 
that region. The balloon eventually pinches off&mdash;becoming a closed universe, 
filled with matter, that is completely disconnected from the original space. 
Of course, it is very unlikely for such a huge quantum fluctuation to occur. 
But in quantum theory any process that is not strictly forbidden by conserva-
tion laws will happen with some probability. Also, since a nucleated closed 
universe does not borrow any energy from the quantum vacuum, it can per-
sist for an indefinitely long time without violating the uncertainty principle.
</p>
<p>A potential problem with Tryon&rsquo;s idea is that it is hard to understand 
why such a large universe would appear. It would be much more likely for 
a Planck sized universe to fluctuate out of the vacuum (as in the spacetime 
foam picture in Fig. 20.2). Even if we concede that observers require a cer-
tain amount of space to evolve, our universe still appears to be much larger 
than necessary to host observers.
</p>
<p>Another, more fundamental issue with Tryon&rsquo;s scenario is that it does not 
really describe a universe appearing from nothing. The vacuum is what we 
call empty space. But as we know from Einstein&rsquo;s general relativity, even 
empty space can bend and warp, and have various geometries, such as the 
open, closed and flat models we have already encountered. Also, from quan-
tum mechanics we know that the vacuum has energy density and tension, 
particles and fields. So the vacuum is very much &ldquo;something&rdquo;, which itself 
has to be presupposed to exist. As Alan Guth put it, &ldquo;In this context, a pro-
posal that the universe was created from empty space is no more fundamen-
tal than a proposal that the universe was spawned by a piece of rubber. It 
might be true, but one would still want to ask where the piece of rubber 
came from&rdquo;. We shall now discuss how Tryon&rsquo;s idea can be extended, to 
describe quantum creation of the universe from &ldquo;literally nothing&rdquo;.

<p>336     23 Creation of Universes from Nothing
</p>
<p>23.2  Quantum Tunneling from &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Suppose we have a closed spherical universe, filled with a false vacuum and 
containing a certain amount of ordinary matter. Suppose also that this uni-
verse is momentarily at rest, neither expanding nor contracting. Its future 
will depend on its radius. If the radius is small, then matter is compressed to 
a high density, and its gravity will cause the universe to collapse. If the radius 
is large, the vacuum energy dominates and the universe will inflate. Small 
and large radii are separated by an energy barrier, which cannot be crossed 
unless the universe is given a large expansion velocity.
</p>
<p>This is according to classical general relativity. But quantum physics pro-
vides another option: the universe can tunnel through the energy barrier, 
from a small to a large radius, and start inflating. The tunneling probability 
depends on the contents of the universe and on its radius. An interesting 
question is what happens as we let the radius become smaller and smaller. 
Remarkably, one finds that in the limit of vanishing radius there is still a 
well-defined, non-zero probability for the tunneling to occur. But a universe 
with a vanishing radius is no universe at all! One also finds that in this limit 
the universe that emerges after tunneling contains only vacuum energy and 
no matter.
</p>
<p>Thus, one arrives at a mathematical description for a universe to be spon-
taneously created out of &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. Here &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; means a state that con-
tains no matter, and in addition it is also completely devoid of space and 
time. The &ldquo;tunneling from nothing&rdquo; picture was introduced by Vilenkin in 
1982 and was later developed by Linde, Valery Rubakov, Alexei Starobinsky, 
and Yakov Zeldovich.
</p>
<p>The tunneling proposal allows for the newborn universe to be filled with 
different types of vacua. As usual in quantum theory, we cannot tell which 
of these possibilities is actually realized, but can only calculate their prob-
abilities. The mathematical analysis of the tunneling process shows that the 
initial radius of the universe right after tunneling is determined by the value 
of the vacuum energy density ρv:
</p>
<p>High-energy vacua correspond to small radii. For example, if the universe 
emerges with a GUT scale vacuum energy density, its initial size would be 
R &sim; 10
</p>
<p>&minus;28
cm. One also finds that the highest probability is obtained for 
</p>
<p>(23.1)R = c
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>8πGρv
</p>
<p>)1/2</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the universe having the largest vacuum energy and the smallest initial size.2 
Once the universe is formed, it immediately starts expanding, due to the 
repulsive gravity of the vacuum. This provides the beginning for the scenario 
of eternal inflation.
</p>
<p>At this point you may be wondering: &ldquo;What caused the universe to pop 
out of nothing?&rdquo; Surprisingly, no cause is needed. If you have a radioactive 
atom, it will decay, and quantum mechanics gives the decay probability in a 
given interval of time. But if you ask why the atom decayed at this particular 
moment and not another, the answer is that there is no cause: the process is 
completely random. Similarly, no cause is needed for a quantum creation of 
the universe.
</p>
<p>Another question you might be asking is: what happened before the 
tunneling? But we can&rsquo;t meaningfully talk about time before the tunneling. 
As St. Augustine put it centuries ago: &ldquo;The world was made not in time but 
simultaneously with time. There was no time before the world&rdquo;. Time only 
has meaning if something is changing. Without space and matter time 
does not exist.
</p>
<p>23.2.1  Euclidean Time
</p>
<p>Quantum creation of universes is similar to quantum tunneling through 
energy barriers in ordinary quantum mechanics. An elegant mathematical 
description of this process can be given in terms of the so-called Euclidean 
time. This is not the kind of time you measure with your watch. It is 
expressed using imaginary numbers like i =
</p>
<p>&radic;
&minus;1 and is introduced only for 
</p>
<p>computational convenience. Making the time Euclidean has a peculiar effect 
on the character of spacetime: the distinction between time and the three 
spatial dimensions disappears, so instead of spacetime we have a four-dimen-
sional space. This Euclidean-time description is very useful, as it provides a 
convenient way to determine the tunneling probability and the initial state 
of the universe as it emerges from the tunneling.
</p>
<p>The birth of the universe can be graphically represented by the space-
time diagram in Fig. 23.3. Here we show one time and one spatial dimen-
sion. Time flows from the bottom of the figure upwards&mdash;it starts out 
being Euclidean, and then switches to regular time at the instant labeled 
</p>
<p>2In 1983 James Hartle and Stephen Hawking proposed an alternative model for a quantum descrip-
tion of the creation of the universe, called the no-boundary proposal. We will not discuss this model in 
detail, except to note that it gives opposite predictions to the tunneling-from-nothing proposal, assign-
ing the highest probability to the smallest vacuum energy and largest initial size of the universe.

</p>
<p>&ldquo;nucleation moment&rdquo;. The dark hemisphere represents quantum tun-
neling and the light surface above the nucleation moment is an inflating 
 spacetime. A salient feature of this model is that there are no singularities. 
A Friedmann spacetime has a singular point of infinite density and curva-
ture at the beginning, where the mathematics of Einstein&rsquo;s equations breaks 
down (see Fig. 5.5). In contrast, the Euclidean spherical region has no such 
points; it has the same finite curvature everywhere. It thus gives a math-
ematically consistent description of how the universe could be born.
</p>
<p>23.3  The Multiverse of Quantum Cosmology
</p>
<p>As we already mentioned, in the tunneling from nothing proposal a universe 
can emerge with any one of a variety of values for the vacuum energy and its 
initial size. Also, although the nucleated universe must have a closed geom-
etry, it need not be perfectly spherical. A range of shapes is allowed. Because 
of the quantum mechanical nature of the tunneling, we cannot determine 
which of these possibilities has been realized. All we can do is calculate the 
probability for a universe to emerge in one of the allowed states. This sug-
gests that there should be a multitude of other universes, which started out 
differently from our own. We shall refer to this ensemble of universes as the 
&ldquo;multiverse of quantum cosmology&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Fig. 23.3 Spacetime diagram of the universe tunneling from nothing. Two 
out of the three spatial dimensions are not shown. The dark hemisphere is the 
Euclidean region of spacetime, and the circle at its boundary represents the 
spherical universe at the moment of nucleation. The larger circle is the universe 
at a later moment of time</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>You might imagine that closed universes pop out of nothing like bub-
bles in a glass of champagne, but this analogy would not be quite accurate. 
Bubbles pop out in the liquid, but in the case of universes, there is no space 
outside. Each universe in the quantum cosmology multiverse has its very 
own space and time, and is completely disconnected from all the others (see 
Fig. 23.4).
</p>
<p>The most probable, and thus the most numerous, universes in the ensem-
ble are the ones with the smallest initial radius and the largest false vacuum 
energy density. Our best guess, then, is that our own universe also originated 
in this way. The probability to nucleate larger universes decreases with size, 
and goes to zero in the limit of an infinite radius. Thus an infinite open uni-
verse has a precisely zero chance of nucleating from &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;, and all the 
universes in the ensemble are necessarily closed.
</p>
<p>Whatever the initial vacuum state of a newborn universe, it will spawn an 
unlimited number of bubbles (or &ldquo;bubble universes&rdquo;) filled with other vacua. 
The entire vacuum landscape will be explored during the course of eternal 
inflation. Thus, each member of the quantum multiverse ensemble is a mul-
tiverse in its own right, including bubble universes of all possible kinds.
</p>
<p>23.4  The Meaning of &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;
</p>
<p>We have described how an inflating seed could emerge from what seems to 
be literally nothing&mdash;a state with no space, no time, and no matter. However, 
the birth of the universe by quantum tunneling is described by the same laws

</p>
<p>of physics that govern its subsequent evolution. So the laws must somehow 
be &ldquo;there&rdquo; prior to the universe. And the laws of physics are definitely not 
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. This is why we put the word &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; in quotation marks.
</p>
<p>The notion of &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; transmuting into &ldquo;something&rdquo; under the spell of 
abstract laws of nature is deeply mystifying. If there is no time and space, 
where and how are these laws encoded? After all, the laws of physics have 
been carefully deduced over centuries by observing and experimenting with 
matter in space and time. They are supposed to describe our physical reality. 
Yet if the universe quantum tunneled as prescribed by the laws, then it seems 
that the laws must be more fundamental than the universe itself. One could 
become a &ldquo;matheist&rdquo; and assert that the laws of physics exist outside of space 
and time, much like a theist assigns the ultimate first cause to God. Or per-
haps the fundamental laws and space and time emerged together?
</p>
<p>We have stumbled far into the unknown. But we will press on with the 
optimistic hope that as the boundaries of scientific enquiry expand, what is 
currently unknowable might one day be known.
</p>
<p>Summary
Quantum theory suggests that a small closed universe could be spontane-
ously created out of nothing. The newborn universe can materialize with a 
variety of sizes and can be filled with different types of vacua. The probabilis-
tic nature of the tunneling suggests that an ensemble of universes can nucle-
ate&mdash;we call this ensemble the multiverse of quantum cosmology. The most 
probable universes are the ones having the smallest initial size and the high-
est vacuum energy. Once such a universe emerges, it starts expanding rapidly 
because of the repulsive gravity of the vacuum. This provides a beginning for 
the scenario of eternal inflation.
</p>
<p>No cause is needed for the quantum creation of a universe&mdash;it is a com-
pletely random process, like the decay of a radioactive atom.

<p>Questions
 1.  What is the total energy of a closed universe? What is its total electric

<p>charge?
 2.  The lifetime of a virtual pair of particles �t depends on the energy

<p>of the particles E. Higher energy particles have shorter lifetimes. 
Quantitatively, E &middot; �t &sim; �, where � is the reduced Planck constant. Use 
this relation to calculate approximately how long it takes for a virtual 
electron-positron pair to vanish. (The rest mass energy of one electron is

<p> 4.  An important characteristic of elementary particles is their baryon num-
ber. This number is equal to 1 for nucleons and &minus;1 for antinucleons. 
The baryon number is conserved in all particle interactions that have 
been studied so far. On the other hand, grand unified theories suggest 
that this conservation law is only approximate and must be violated in 
high-energy interactions. Assuming that the universe was created from 
nothing, can you tell whether the baryon conservation law is approxi-

you?
</p>
<p> 7.  A universe which quantum tunnels from nothing must be closed. Does 
this mean that our local universe has a spherical geometry? Explain your 
answer. (Hint: See the discussion of bubble geometry in Sect. 18.4.)

<p> 8.  Why does the tunneling from nothing proposal imply that there should 
be a multitude of other universes?

Sect. 18.3.) Is there any place where we could live in such a uni-
verse? Do you think this model can be ruled out observationally?

<p>We are now going to summarize what we have learned about the universe, 
starting with things we are confident about and going up step by step in 
the level of conjecture, all the way to very speculative ideas. We shall discuss 
the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; that has emerged and the answers it gives to the &ldquo;big ques-
tions&rdquo; of cosmology.
</p>
<p>24.1  The Observable Universe
</p>
<p>24.1.1  What Do We Know?
</p>
<p>We can confidently trace our cosmic origins to a hot, dense fireball that 
erupted 13.7 billion years ago. This primeval fireball permeated all of the 
observable universe and was rapidly expanding. It consisted of matter and 
antimatter in almost equal amounts, with a slight excess of particles over 
antiparticles. The expansion caused the fireball to cool and set in motion a 
series of major cosmological events.
</p>
<p>As the temperature dropped, particles annihilated with their antiparticles, 
and at about one second after the big bang essentially all the antiparticles 
had vanished.1 At that time the fireball was a mix of photons, neutrinos, 
electrons, neutrons, protons, and dark matter particles. The photons out-
numbered matter particles by about a billion to one. Within the first few

<p>1To be precise, antineutrinos are still present in the universe today, in about the same amounts as neu-
trinos. They did not annihilate because they interact so weakly.</p>

</p>
<p>minutes the universe had cooled enough for the first atomic nuclei to form. 
A long uneventful period followed, and then at about 400,000 years elec-
trons and nuclei combined into electrically neutral atoms. Consequently, the 
universe became transparent to light, so photons were free to stream ahead 
unimpeded. These photons now come to us from all directions in the sky as 
the cosmic background radiation.
</p>
<p>Minute differences in the cosmic radiation intensity tell us that some of 
the photons came from regions that were slightly more or less dense. These 
tiny density fluctuations in the early universe grew larger and larger as gravita-
tional attraction dialed up the contrast between high and low density regions. 
In about a billion years these fluctuations had turned into the first galaxies. 
Dark matter played a crucial role in this process. Galaxies continued to grow 
via mergers. Larger structures like clusters and superclusters also continued to 
emerge until about five billion years ago, when the universe became dominated 
by the vacuum energy and the structure formation process came to a halt.
</p>
<p>We now know that atomic matter makes up only about 5% of the total 
energy (or mass) density of the universe; dark matter, which has yet to be 
directly observed, contributes about 26%, and the vacuum energy density 
about 69%. The contribution to the energy density from photons and neu-
trinos has been redshifted to insignificance today.
</p>
<p>This account of cosmic history is supported by a wealth of observational 
data, and there is very little doubt that it is basically correct. Most physicists 
would agree with the sentiment of Yacov Zel&rsquo;dovich when he proclaimed: 
&ldquo;I am as sure of the big bang as I am that the Earth goes around the Sun.&rdquo; 
And yet, the big bang theory is not completely satisfactory. The theory pos-
tulates that the initial fireball has rather peculiar properties: it must be very 
hot, expanding, space-filling, uniform, and it must have tiny fluctuations. 
Furthermore, the big bang theory does not say where the fireball came from 
in the first place. These issues are addressed in the theory of cosmic inflation.
</p>
<p>24.1.2  Cosmic Inflation
</p>
<p>Inflation is a hypothetical period of fast, accelerated expansion in the early 
cosmic history. It is driven by the repulsive gravity of a high-energy false vac-
uum. At the end of inflation, the false vacuum decays, igniting a hot fireball 
of particles and radiation. As we discussed in Chap. 16, a period of inflation 
naturally explains the otherwise mysterious features of the fireball, which 
had to be postulated before. Once the fireball ignites, the universe evolves 
along the lines of the standard big bang cosmology. Thus, the end of infla-
tion plays the role of the big bang in this theory.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The details of cosmic inflation depend on the energy landscape of parti-
cle physics, of which little is known. At present, therefore, inflation is not a 
specific model, but rather a framework encompassing a wide class of mod-
els with different energy landscapes. But despite the variety of models, some 
observational predictions of inflation are very robust and have been convinc-
ingly confirmed by the data. By now inflation has become the leading cos-
mological paradigm. With increasing accuracy of observations we can expect 
to learn more about the inflationary epoch in the early universe and about 
particle physics at very high energies.
</p>
<p>24.2  The Multiverse
</p>
<p>24.2.1  Bubble Universes
</p>
<p>A remarkable property of cosmic inflation is its eternal character. The end 
of inflation is triggered by quantum, probabilistic processes and does not 
occur everywhere at once. In our cosmic neighborhood inflation ended 13.7 
billion years ago, but it still continues in remote parts of the universe, and 
other &ldquo;normal&rdquo; regions like ours are constantly being formed.2 The new 
regions appear as tiny, microscopic bubbles (or &ldquo;islands&rdquo;) and immediately 
start to grow. They keep growing without bound, but the gaps between 
them are also growing. Thus there is always room for more bubbles to form, 
and their number proliferates ad infinitum. This never-ending process is 
what we call eternal inflation. We live in one of the bubbles and can observe 
only a small part of it, so for all practical purposes we live in a self-contained 
bubble universe.
</p>
<p>If the energy landscape of particle physics includes a multitude of vacuum 
states, then bubbles filled with each type of vacuum have a nonzero prob-
ability to form. So inevitably, an unlimited number of bubbles of all possible 
types will be formed during the course of eternal inflation. The constants 
of nature, such as the masses of elementary particles, Newton&rsquo;s gravitational 
constant, etc., will take a variety of different values in different bubble types.
</p>
<p>This multiverse picture explains the long-standing mystery of why the con-
stants of nature appear to be fine-tuned for the emergence of life. The reason 
is that intelligent observers exist only in those rare bubbles in which, by pure 
chance, the constants happen to be just right for life to emerge. The rest of 
the multiverse remains barren, but no one is there to complain about that.
</p>
<p>2Inflation is not eternal in some special energy landscapes, but such models appear to be rather artificial.

<p>346     24 The Big Picture
</p>
<p>24.2.2  Other Disconnected Spacetimes
</p>
<p>Even though inflation is eternal to the future, it must have had a beginning 
in the past. An attractive proposal for the beginning, which avoids the end-
less succession of questions &ldquo;And what happened before that?&rdquo; is the idea 
that spatially closed inflating universes can quantum-mechanically nucleate 
out of &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The newly born universes can have a variety of different shapes and sizes 
and can be filled with different types of vacua. As usual in quantum theory, 
we cannot tell which of these possibilities is realized in any given universe, 
but can only calculate their probabilities. One finds that the most probable 
initial states are those of small size and high vacuum energy density.
</p>
<p>All nucleated universes are completely disconnected from one another. 
They start from different initial states, but in the process of eternal inflation 
get populated by bubbles of all possible types.3 At later times these universes 
&ldquo;forget&rdquo; their initial state and become statistically very similar to one another.
</p>
<p>24.2.3  Levels of the Multiverse
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;multiverse&rdquo; has different meanings depending on the context 
in which it is used. In this book we talked about the multiverses of  eternal 
inflation and of quantum cosmology. In fact, one can distinguish at least 
three levels of the multiverse.4
</p>
<p>Level 1: an individual bubble universe. When viewed from inside, a bub-
ble universe is spatially infinite and includes an infinite number of horizon 
regions like ours (see Chap. 18). In this sense, a bubble universe is a multi-
verse in its own right. Different horizon regions in a bubble have very simi-
lar physical properties, but differ in detail: the pattern of galaxy distributions 
and the forms of life will differ from one region to another. As Max Tegmark 
lightly sums it up, physicists in different horizon regions will take the same 
physics classes, but they would study different things in history.
</p>
<p>Level 2: the multitude of bubble universes. This is the multiverse of eternal 
inflation, populated with bubbles of all possible types. In this kind of multiverse, 
observers in different types of bubbles would learn different things not only in 
history class, but in physics class too.
</p>
<p>3The initial nucleation process can be regarded as the state of &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; branching into embryo universes 
with different initial conditions. This is similar to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, 
where each of the spawned universes will further branch into a multitude of parallel universes.
4Note that our classification of multiverse levels is somewhat different from that of Max Tegmark in his 
book &ldquo;Our Mathematical Universe&rdquo;.</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57040-2_18">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57040-2_18</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Level 3: the multiverse of quantum cosmology. The members of this multi-
verse are all level-2 multiverses. They differ mostly by their initial states and 
become statistically very similar at later times.
</p>
<p>The three levels of the multiverse are illustrated in Fig. 24.1. Each higher 
level involves a higher level of speculation. The existence of other horizon 
regions beyond our own is rather uncontroversial. The observable universe 
is nearly uniform, so it is natural to expect that the uniform distribution of 
galaxies and radiation extends beyond our horizon. Even if inflation is not 
eternal, there should be a multitude of horizon regions, and in this sense a 
level 1 multiverse would still exist.
</p>
<p>The level 2 multiverse assumes the existence of multiple bubble types, with 
different physical properties, populated by the mechanism of eternal infla-
tion. The successful prediction of the cosmological constant provides indirect 
 evidence for this kind of multiverse. Direct evidence may also be found by 
looking for signatures of collisions of our bubble with other bubbles and for 
&ldquo;failed bubbles&rdquo; in the form of black holes with a special distribution of masses.
</p>
<p>We may never be able to test the existence of the level 3 multiverse obser-
vationally. Nevertheless, it may be necessary for the completeness and con-
sistency of our worldview.
</p>
<p>24.2.4  The Mathematical Multiverse and Ockham&rsquo;s Razor
</p>
<p>The Standard Model of particle physics, combined with general relativity, 
can be expressed as a single mathematical equation, shown in Fig. 24.2. This 
equation encodes the physical character of our bubble universe. In an eter-
nally inflating multiverse, the physical character of bubble universes can vary 
greatly from one bubble to another, so the equations expressing local  physical

verse is most likely a very small domain in one bubble universe. An infinite num-
ber of regions like ours may exist beyond our horizon. b Level 2: the eternally 
inflating multiverse consists of an ensemble of bubbles formed during eternal 
inflation. c Level 3: multiple disconnected spacetimes produced by quantum tun-
neling from nothing. This ensemble of disconnected spacetimes is the &ldquo;multi-
verse of quantum cosmology&rdquo;

<p>laws will also vary. However, underlying this diversity, physicists expect to 
find a single fundamental theory of nature&mdash;an equation or a set of equations 
describing the entire multiverse. The same equations should also describe the 
nucleation of inflating multiverses from nothing. These could be the equa-
tions of string theory, or of some yet undiscovered fundamental theory. 
Finding this &ldquo;theory of everything&rdquo; is the holy grail of theoretical physics. But 
whatever it is, the question naturally comes to mind: Why this theory? Who 
or what selected it from the infinity of all possible mathematical laws?
</p>
<p>Max Tegmark, now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sug-
gested a possible answer, which is as simple as it is radical: there is a  physical 
universe corresponding to each and every mathematical structure.5 This 
amounts to adding another level to the multiverse.
</p>
<p>Level 4: the multiverse of mathematical structures. This includes, for exam-
ple, a Newtonian universe governed by the laws of classical mechanics, with-
out quantum theory and relativity, as well as a &ldquo;universe&rdquo; described by the 
natural set of numbers 1, 2, 3, &hellip;, supplemented by the rules of addition 
and multiplication, or by a 5-dimensional cube. The mathematical struc-
tures in some of the universes are intricate enough to allow the emergence of 
self-aware substructures, like you and us. Such universes might be rare, but 
of course they are the only ones that can be observed. All universes in this

single equation that has the power to explain almost everything about our phys-
ical world. It embodies quantum mechanics, general relativity and the Standard 
Model of particle physics. This shorthand mathematics encodes a great deal of 
information and readily turns into pages and pages of equations when physi-
cists use it for particular problems. It is consistent with almost every experiment 
we have ever performed on Earth. Note We still do not have a unified theory 
of gravity and quantum mechanics, and it does not account for neutrino masses 
and dark matter. Credit From S. Carroll, The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, 
Meaning, and the Universe Itself (Dutton 2016)

<p>5Tegmark actually goes further than that and asserts that the universe is a mathematical structure.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>mathematical multiverse are completely disconnected from one another, but 
Tegmark asserts that they are all equally real (Fig. 24.3).
</p>
<p>Such a dramatic extension of physical reality may raise an objection that 
it runs against one of the most cherished principles of science&mdash;&ldquo;Ockham&rsquo;s 
razor&rdquo;. As formulated by the 14th century English philosopher William of 
Ockham, this principle states &ldquo;Entities should not be multiplied beyond 
necessity.&rdquo; In our context this can be interpreted to say that if you can explain 
all observations with both a simple theory and a more complex theory, then 
the simple theory is preferable. Then why add an infinite ensemble of math-
ematical structures if our observations can be accounted for by a single equa-
tion as in Fig. 24.2? Similar objections can be raised against level 1, 2 and 3 
multiverses: they appear to be very wasteful of space, matter, and universes.
</p>
<p>But in mathematics it is often simpler to describe an entire ensemble than 
to specify individual members of that ensemble. For example, the natural set 
of integers 1, 2, 3, &hellip; can be generated by a short computer program, while 
specifying a single large integer may require many more bits of information.

by all possible mathematical laws. Apart from some of his more outlandish 
ideas, Tegmark has made important contributions to the study of the CMB and 
the large-scale distribution of galaxies. At present his research is focused on the 
physics of the brain. Photo courtesy Max Tegmark

</p>
<p>Similarly, it is much simpler to write down the equations governing eter-
nal inflation than it is to specify all the precise initial conditions that would 
be needed to describe one particular bubble universe. The process of eter-
nal inflation is simple and economical; it effortlessly generates great diversity 
with very little input, much like cell-division and natural selection. In this 
sense, it is the opposite of &ldquo;wasteful&rdquo; and seems to be in line with Ockham&rsquo;s 
razor. As Alan Guth predicts, &ldquo;Given the plausibility of eternal inflation, I 
believe that soon any cosmological theory that does not lead to the eternal 
reproduction of universes will be considered as unimaginable as a species of 
bacteria that cannot reproduce.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Tegmark&rsquo;s mathematical multiverse idea is not without its problems. There 
is an infinite number of mathematical structures. If all of them are equally 
probable, then the probability of any one of them is exactly zero. (Note that, 
in contrast, the number of possible bubble types is finite, even though it may 
be extremely large.) Moreover, the number of mathematical structures prolif-
erates with increasing complexity. By the principle of mediocrity, we should 
then expect to find ourselves living in a horrendously large and cumbersome 
mathematical structure. But we tend to find that nature prefers simplicity.
</p>
<p>As of now, the mathematical multiverse idea does not have much follow-
ing in the physics community. The level 2 multiverse of eternal inflation was 
very controversial in the 1980s and 90s, but the tide has gradually changed, 
and it is now widely accepted by mainstream cosmologists (with some nota-
ble exceptions). The level 3 multiverse of quantum cosmology is regarded as 
an intriguing possibility, but progress in this area should await the develop-
ment of the theory of quantum gravity.
</p>
<p>24.3  Answers to the &ldquo;Big Questions&rdquo;
</p>
<p>We opened this book asking a few basic questions: Is the universe finite 
or infinite? Has it existed forever? If not, when and how did it come into 
being? Will it ever end? Philosophers and theologians have been arguing 
about these questions for millennia, and one might expect that all possible 
answers have already been anticipated. However, the worldview suggested 
by modern cosmology is not what anyone expected. It does not give &ldquo;yes&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answers to the big questions, but rather maintains that each of the 
opposing options has some element of truth.
</p>
<p>Each bubble universe is infinite when viewed from the inside. And yet 
the entire inflating multiverse is spatially closed and finite. Due to the non-
trivial spacetime geometry, this multiverse can contain an unlimited number 
of bubble universes.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The multiverse of eternal inflation is eternal only to the future: it had a 
beginning, but will have no end. It began as a tiny closed space by popping 
spontaneously out of &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. Our local region, however, will come to an 
end. It will end in a big crunch, after being engulfed by a bubble of negative 
energy density.
</p>
<p>24.4  Our Place in the Universe
</p>
<p>Ever since Copernicus, advances in science have been casting doubt on the 
na&iuml;ve view that our planet and our civilization play some special role in the 
cosmos. Not only did we discover that the Earth is not the center of the 
Solar System, but the Sun itself is an unremarkable star at the outskirts of 
a rather typical galaxy. Now, according to the new worldview, our bubble 
universe contains an infinite number of galaxies, which harbor an infinity of 
earths identical to our own. Confronted with this worldview, it is hard to feel 
special! What meaning can then we assign to our lives and our civilization?
</p>
<p>The universe is governed by mathematical laws, which make no reference 
to meaning. The concept of meaning is created by humans, and it is up to 
us to give meaning to the universe. We may be insignificant on the grand 
cosmic scale, but we could extend our significance well beyond our planet 
Earth. We don&rsquo;t know how widespread intelligent life is, but the chances are 
that we are the only intelligent civilization in the entire observable region. 
If so, we are custodians of a huge chunk of real estate, 80 billion light years 
across. We have now reached the point where we can either self-destruct 
or colonize our galaxy and beyond. This makes us nothing but significant. 
Our crossing the threshold to a space-colonizing civilization would be an 
enormous breakthrough. It would make the difference between us being a 
&ldquo;flicker&rdquo; civilization that blinks in and out of existence, and being a civili-
zation that spreads through much of the observable universe, and possibly 
transforms it.

<p>This appendix covers some mathematical details of relativistic cosmology, 
and is suitable for readers who are familiar with calculus.
</p>
<p>The Friedmann Equation
</p>
<p>In Chap. 7 we introduced the concept of a scale factor a(t), which is defined 
as the factor by which distances between commoving objects in a homoge-
neous and isotropic universe at cosmic time t differ from their distances at 
the present time t0. Thus, by definition, a(t0) = 1. We also showed that the 
expansion rate of the universe, as characterized by the Hubble parameter, is 
related to the scale factor as:
</p>
<p>where an overdot denotes the rate of change, or the time derivative, ȧ = da
dt
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>The magnitude of H is related to the energy density by the Friedmann 
equation, which we shall now derive.
</p>
<p>Let us consider a comoving spherical region of radius R = a(t)R0, as we 
did in Sect. 8.1. The total energy of a test particle that lies on the boundary 
of the sphere is given by (see Eq. 8.1)

ρ is the mass of matter 
</p>
<p>enclosed by the sphere, and ρ is the mass density. We shall assume that the 
universe is dominated by matter, so the force due to pressure is negligible; 
then M does not change during the course of expansion.
</p>
<p>Since energy is conserved, the magnitude of the right-hand side of 
Eq. (A.2) at any time is the same as it is at present; hence we can write
</p>
<p>where zero subscripts indicate quantities evaluated at the present time. 
Dividing by R2 (where R = a(t)R0) and factoring out H

Equation (A.3) is the famous Friedmann equation, which is a statement

<p>of energy conservation. Note that although we derived it here assuming that 
pressure is negligible (which is not so at early and late times), it is valid in 
general. Another useful form of the Friedmann equation is obtained by mul-
tiplying Eq. (A.3) with a2. This gives

<p>Solutions in Different Cosmic Epochs
</p>
<p>The observed density of the universe is very close to the critical density. 
Hence, to a good approximation we can set Ω0 = 1. Then the Friedmann

Eq. (A.18) is Eq. 11.8).

<p>You can now use Eqs. (A.17) and (A.18) to calculate the mass density and 
the temperature of the universe at any time during the radiation era. If t is in 
seconds, then
</p>
<p>These equations were introduced without derivation in Chap. 14. (In 
deriving the last relation, we substituted ρr0 into Eq. (A.15) to find 
Cr &asymp; 2 &times; 10

We can approximate the time of matter-radiation equality teq by substi-

<p>This estimate is not very accurate because our expression for a(t) was found 
by assuming the radiation density is much bigger than the matter density 
(and all other densities). But at the time of equality teq, the two densities

<p>Note: Here we have defined vacuum domination to start at the time when 
the energy density of matter becomes equal to the energy density of the vac-

for accelerated expansion to begin is that ρv &gt; ρm/2. This means that accel-

<p>During inflation the universe is also dominated by vacuum energy. So the 
Friedmann equation is the same as (A.27), except the inflationary vacuum 
energy density ρv is much greater than it is at present. The scale factor is still 
given by (A.30). This tells us that in a time interval �t the universe expands

some early time. We discussed this fact, known as the flatness problem, in 
Chap. 15; now we will show how it follows from the Friedmann equation 
Eq. (A.3).

</p>
<p>where &prop; means &ldquo;proportional to.&rdquo;
In a universe filled with ordinary matter or radiation, the speed of expan-
</p>
<p>sion ȧ decreases with time, due to the attractive gravitational force. Then it 
follows from Eq. (A.34) that |1 &minus; Ω| grows with time. In other words, the 
universe deviates more and more from the critical density. Using the solu-
tions (A.14) and (A.23), we find that (1 &minus; Ω) &prop; t in the radiation era, and 
(1 &minus; Ω) &prop; t2/3 in the matter era. For example, from cosmic time t = 1s till 
the end of the radiation era at teq &asymp; 2 &times; 10
</p>
<p>12
s, (1 &minus; Ω) grew by a factor 
</p>
<p>of 2 &times; 1012, and from teq to the present time t0 it grew approximately by 
a factor ( t0
</p>
<p>teq
)
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>3 &asymp; 2 &times; 10
3. Overall, (1 &minus; Ω) increased by a factor 4 &times; 1015 
</p>
<p>between t = 1 s and now.2  This means that for |1 &minus; Ω| &lt; 0.1 now, we must 
fine-tune |1 &minus; Ω|to be less than 2 &times; 10&minus;17 at t = 1s.
</p>
<p>Equation (A.34) also explains how the flatness problem is solved by cos-
mic inflation. During inflation the expansion of the universe accelerates, so 
ȧ grows and |1 &minus; Ω| decreases with time. From (A.30), ȧ &prop; eHvt and
</p>
<p>This shows that the density approaches the critical density exponentially fast. 
If, for example, inflation expanded the universe by a factor of 1050, then Ω 
was driven closer to 1 by a factor of 10100.
</p>
<p>Note: By the definition of the doubling time n, (here we denote the dou-
bling time by &ldquo;n&rdquo; to relate to Fig. 16.4), we can write the scale factor as
</p>
<p>allowing us to recast Eq. (A.35) in terms of the doubling time as,
</p>
<p>(A.35)(1 &minus; Ω) &prop; e&minus;2Hvt &prop; a&minus;2.
</p>
<p>(A.36)a(t) &prop; 2
n
</p>
<p>(A.37)(1 &minus; Ω) &prop; 2&minus;2n
</p>
<p>2 Here we disregard the relatively small change in (1 &minus; Ω) during the vacuum dominated era, which 
started only recently.</p>

<p>Here is a list of books that may be helpful for further exploration of some of 
the topics that we have covered. We have grouped them according to their 
main focus, although most of these books cover other topics as well. In the 
last group we included some books which are critical of the ideas of infla-
tion, string theory, and the multiverse. The &ldquo;Further viewing&rdquo; list includes 
some excellent web courses on various aspects of cosmology.
