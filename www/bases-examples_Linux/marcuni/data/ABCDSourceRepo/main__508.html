<p>Abstract 
</p>
<p>Background 
</p>
<p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and 
</p>
<p>reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.  
</p>
<p>Patients and methods 
</p>
<p>French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early 
</p>
<p>March to March 16
th
</p>
<p>, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in 
</p>
<p>nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical 
</p>
<p>presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center 
</p>
<p>and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of 
</p>
<p>virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. 
</p>
<p>Results 
</p>
<p>Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight 
</p>
<p>had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. 
</p>
<p>Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral 
</p>
<p>carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration 
</p>
<p>than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion 
</p>
<p>                  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is 
</p>
<p>significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its

<p>effect is reinforced by azithromycin.

<p>1. Introduction 
</p>
<p>In late December 2019, an outbreak of an emerging disease (COVID-19) due to a novel 
</p>
<p>coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2 latter) started in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in China 
</p>
<p>and outside [1,2]. The WHO declared the epidemic of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 
</p>
<p>12
th
</p>
<p> 2020 [3]. According to a recent Chinese stud, about 80% of patients present with mild 
</p>
<p>disease and the overall case-fatality rate is about 2.3% but reaches 8.0% in patients aged 70 to 
</p>
<p>79 years and 14.8% in those aged &gt;80 years [4]. However, there is probably an important 
</p>
<p>number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus the mortality rate is probably 
</p>
<p>overestimated. France is now facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 4500 cases, as of 
</p>
<p>March 14
th
</p>
<p> 2020 [5]. Thus, there is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat 
</p>
<p>symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage in order to limit the 
</p>
<p>transmission in the community. Among candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning of 
</p>
<p>old drugs for use as antiviral treatment is an interesting strategy because knowledge on safety 
</p>
<p>profile, side effects, posology and drug interactions are well known [6,7]. 
</p>
<p>A recent paper reported an inhibitor effect of remdesivir (a new antiviral drug) and 
</p>
<p>chloroquine (an old antimalarial drug) on the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, [8] and an 
</p>
<p>early clinical trial conducted in COVID-19 Chinese patients, showed that chloroquine had a 
</p>
<p>significant effect, both in terms of clinical outcome and viral clearance, when comparing to 
</p>
<p>controls groups [9,10]. Chinese experts recommend that patients diagnosed as mild, moderate 
</p>
<p>and severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine, be 
</p>
<p>treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for ten days [11]. 
</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine (an analogue of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an anti-
</p>
<p>SARS-CoV activity in vitro [12]. Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than 
</p>
<p>that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose [13] and has fewer 
</p>
<p>                  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>concerns about drug-drug interactions [14]. Our team has a very comprehensive experience in 
</p>
<p>successfully treating patients with chronic diseases due to intracellular bacteria (Q fever due 
</p>
<p>to Coxiella burnetii and Whipple&rsquo;s disease due to Tropheryma whipplei) with long-term 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine treatment (600 mg/day for 12 to 18 months) since more than 20 years. 
</p>
<p>[15,16] We therefore started to conduct a clinical trial aiming at assessing the effect of 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients after approval by the French Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Health. In this report we describe our early results, focusing on virological data in patients 
</p>
<p>receiving hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2. Study population and Methods 
</p>
<p>Setting 
</p>
<p>This ongoing study is coordinated by The M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e Infection University Hospital Institute 
</p>
<p>in Marseille. Patients who were proposed a treatment with hydroxychloroquine were recruited 
</p>
<p>and managed in Marseille centre. Controls without hydroxychloroquine treatment were 
</p>
<p>recruited in Marseille, Nice, Avignon and Brian&ccedil;on centers, all located in South France.  
</p>
<p>Patients 
</p>
<p>Hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study if they fulfilled 
</p>
<p>two primary criteria: i) age &gt;12 years; ii) PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 carriage in 
</p>
<p>nasopharyngeal sample at admission whatever their clinical status.  
</p>
<p>Patients were excluded if they had a known allergy to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine or 
</p>
<p>had another known contraindication to treatment with the study drug, including retinopathy, 
</p>
<p>G6PD deficiency and QT prolongation. Breastfeeding and pregnant patients were excluded 
</p>
<p>based on their declaration and pregnancy test results when required.  
</p>
<p>                  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Informed consent 
</p>
<p>Before being included in the study, patients meeting inclusion criteria had to give their 
</p>
<p>consent to participate to the study. Written informed signed consent was obtained from adult 
</p>
<p>participants (&gt; 18 years) or from parents or legal guardians for minors (&lt;18 years). An 
</p>
<p>information document that clearly indicates the risks and the benefits associated with the 
</p>
<p>participation to the study was given to each patient. Patients received information about their 
</p>
<p>clinical status during care regardless of whether they participate in the study or not. Regarding 
</p>
<p>patient identification, a study number was assigned sequentially to included participants, 
</p>
<p>according to the range of patient numbers allocated to each study centre. The study was 
</p>
<p>conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
</p>
<p>Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines of good clinical practice, 
</p>
<p>the Helsinki Declaration, and applicable standard operating procedures. 
</p>
<p>The protocol, appendices and any other relevant documentation were submitted to the French 
</p>
<p>National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM) (2020-000890-25) and to the French Ethic 
</p>
<p>Committee (CPP Ile de France) (20.02.28.99113) for reviewing and approved on 5
th
</p>
<p> and 6
th
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>March, 2020, respectively. This trial is registered with EU Clinical Trials Register, number 
</p>
<p>2020-000890-25.  
</p>
<p>Procedure 
</p>
<p>Patients were seen at baseline for enrolment, initial data collection and treatment at day-0, and 
</p>
<p>again for daily follow-up during 14 days. Each day, patients received a standardized clinical 
</p>
<p>examination and when possible, a nasopharyngeal sample was collected. All clinical data 
</p>
<p>were collected using standardized questionnaires. All patients in Marseille center were 
</p>
<p>proposed oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg, three times per day during ten days (in this 
</p>
<p>preliminary phase ,we did not enrolled children in the treatment group based in data 
</p>
<p>indicating that children develop mild symptoms of COVID-19 [4]). Patients who refused the 
</p>
<p>                  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>treatment or had an exclusion criteria, served as controls in Marseille centre. Patients in other 
</p>
<p>centers did not receive hydroxychloroquine and served as controls. Symptomatic treatment 
</p>
<p>and antibiotics as a measure to prevent bacterial super-infection was provided by investigators 
</p>
<p>based on clinical judgment. Hydroxychloroquine was provided by the National Pharmacy of 
</p>
<p>France on nominative demand. 
</p>
<p>Clinical classification 
</p>
<p>Patients were grouped into three categories: asymptomatic, upper respiratory tract infection 
</p>
<p>(URTI) when presenting with rhinitis, pharyngitis, or isolated low-grade fever and myalgia, 
</p>
<p>and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) when presenting with symptoms of pneumonia 
</p>
<p>or bronchitis. 
</p>
<p>PCR assay 
</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR [17].  
</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine dosage 
</p>
<p>Native hydroxychloroquine has been dosed from patients&rsquo; serum samples by UHPLC-UV 
</p>
<p>using a previously described protocol [18]. The peak of the chromatogram at 1.05 min of 
</p>
<p>retention corresponds to hydroxychloroquine metabolite. The serum concentration of this 
</p>
<p>metabolite is deduced from UV absorption, as for hydroxychloroquine concentration. 
</p>
<p>Considering both concentrations provides an estimation of initial serum hydroxychloroquine 
</p>
<p>concentration.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Culture 
</p>
<p>For all patients, 500 &micro;L of the liquid collected from the nasopharyngeal swab were passed 
</p>
<p>through 0.22-&micro;m pore sized centrifugal filter (Merck millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), then 
</p>
<p>were inoculated in wells of 96-well culture microplates, of which 4 wells contained Vero E6 
</p>
<p>cells (ATCC CRL-1586) in Minimum Essential Medium culture medium with 4% fetal calf 
</p>
<p>serum and 1% glutamine. After centrifigation at 4,000 g, microplates were incubated at 37&deg;C. 
</p>
<p>Plates were observed daily for evidence of cytopathogenic effect. Presumptive detection of 
</p>
<p>virus in supernatant was done using SU5000 SEM (Hitachi) then confirmed by specific RT-
</p>
<p>PCR. 
</p>
<p>Outcome 
</p>
<p>The primary endpoint was virological clearance at day-6 post-inclusion. Secondary outcomes 
</p>
<p>were virological clearance overtime during the study period, clinical follow-up (body 
</p>
<p>temperature, respiratory rate, long of stay at hospital and mortality), and occurrence of side-
</p>
<p>effects.  
</p>
<p>Statistics 
</p>
<p>Assuming a 50% efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in reducing the viral load at day 7, a 85% 
</p>
<p>power, a type I error rate of 5% and 10% loss to follow-up, we calculated that a total of 48 
</p>
<p>COVID-19 patients (ie, 24 cases in the hydroxychloroquine group and 24 in the control 
</p>
<p>group) would be required for the analysis (Fleiss with CC). Statistical differences were 
</p>
<p>evaluated by Pearson&rsquo;s chi-square or Fisher&rsquo;s exact tests as categorical variables, as 
</p>
<p>appropriate. Means of quantitative data were compared using Student&rsquo;s t-test. Analyses were 
</p>
<p>performed in Stata version 14.2.

<p>3. Results (detailed results are available in supplementary Table 1) 
</p>
<p>Demographics and clinical presentation  
</p>
<p>We enrolled 36 out of 42 patients meeting the inclusion criteria in this study that had at least 
</p>
<p>six days of follow-up at the time of the present analysis. A total of 26 patients received 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine and 16 were control patients. Six hydroxychloroquine-treated patients 
</p>
<p>were lost in follow-up during the survey because of early cessation of treatment. Reasons are 
</p>
<p>as follows: three patients were transferred to intensive care unit, including one transferred on 
</p>
<p>day2 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on day1, one transferred on day3 post-inclusion 
</p>
<p>who was PCR-positive on days1-2 and one transferred on day4 post-inclusion who was PCR-
</p>
<p>positive on day1 and day3; one patient died on day3 post inclusion and was PCR-negative on 
</p>
<p>day2; one patient decided to leave the hospital on day3 post-inclusion and was PCR-negative 
</p>
<p>on days1-2; finally, one patient stopped the treatment on day3 post-inclusion because of 
</p>
<p>nausea and was PCR-positive on days1-2-3. The results presented here are therefore those of 
</p>
<p>36 patients (20 hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and 16 control patients). None of the 
</p>
<p>control patients was lost in follow-up. Basic demographics and clinical status are presented in 
</p>
<p>Table 1. Overall, 15 patients were male (41.7%), with a mean age of 45.1 years. The 
</p>
<p>proportion of asymptomatic patients was 16.7%, that of patients with URTI symptoms was 
</p>
<p>61.1% and that of patients with LRTI symptoms was 22.2%). All patients with LRTI 
</p>
<p>symptoms, had confirmed pneumonia by CTScan. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were 
</p>
<p>older than control patients (51.2 years vs. 37.3 years). No significant difference was observed 
</p>
<p>between hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and control patients with regard to gender, 
</p>
<p>clinical status and duration of symptoms prior to inclusion (Table 1). Among 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine-treated patients six patients received azithromycin (500mg on day1 
</p>
<p>followed by 250mg per day, the next four days) to prevent bacterial super-infection under 
</p>
<p>                  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>daily electrocardiogram control. Clinical follow-up and occurrence of side-effects will be 
</p>
<p>described in a further paper at the end of the trial.  
</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine dosage 
</p>
<p>Mean hydroxychloroquine serum concentration was 0.46 &micro;g/ml+0.2 (N=20).  
</p>
<p>Effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral load 
</p>
<p>The proportion of patients that had negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples 
</p>
<p>significantly differed between treated patients and controls at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-inclusion 
</p>
<p>(Table 2). At day6 post-inclusion, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were 
</p>
<p>virologicaly cured comparing with 12.5% in the control group (p= 0.001).  
</p>
<p>When comparing the effect of hydroxychloroquine treatment as a single drug and the effect of 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine and azithromyc in combination, the proportion of patients that had 
</p>
<p>negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples was significantly different between the two 
</p>
<p>groups at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-inclusion (Table 3). At day6 post-inclusion, 100% of patients 
</p>
<p>treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination were virologicaly cured 
</p>
<p>comparing with 57.1% in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine only, and 12.5% in the 
</p>
<p>control group (p&lt;0.001). These results are summarized in Figures 1 and 2. Drug effect was 
</p>
<p>significantly higher in patients with symptoms of URTI and LRTI, as compared to 
</p>
<p>asymptomatic patients with p&lt;0.05 (data not show).  
</p>
<p>Of note, one patient who was still PCR-positive at day6-post inclusion under 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine treatment only, received azithromycin in addition to hydroxychloroquine 
</p>
<p>at day8-post inclusion and cured her infection at day-9 post infection. In contrast, one of the 
</p>
<p>patients under hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination who tested negative at 
</p>
<p>day6 post-inclusion was tested positive at low titer at day8 post-inclusion. 
</p>

<p>Cultures 
</p>
<p>We could isolate SARS-CoV-2 in 19 out of 25 clinical samples from patients. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. Discussion 
</p>
<p>For ethical reasons and because our first results are so significant and evident we decide to 
</p>
<p>share our findings with the medical community, given the urgent need for an effective drug 
</p>
<p>against SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic context. 
</p>
<p>We show here that hydroxychloroquine is efficient in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage 
</p>
<p>of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in only three to six days, in most patients. A 
</p>
<p>significant difference was observed between hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and controls 
</p>
<p>starting even on day3 post-inclusion. These results are of great importance because a recent 
</p>
<p>paper has shown that the mean duration of viral shedding in patients suffering from COVID-
</p>
<p>19 in China was 20 days (even 37 days for the longest duration) [19] 
</p>
<p>Very recently, a Chinese team published results of a study demonstrating that chloroquine and 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with hydroxychloroquine 
</p>
<p>(EC50=0.72%&micro;M) found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47%&micro;M) [14]. These 
</p>
<p>in vitro results corroborate our clinical results. The target values indicated in this paper [14] 
</p>
<p>were reached in our experiments. The safer dose-dependent toxicity profile of 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine in humans, compared to that of chloroquine [13] allows using clinical 
</p>
<p>doses of hydroxychloroquine that will be over its EC50 observed in vitro [14]. 
</p>
<p>Our preliminary results also suggest a synergistic effect of the combination of 
</p>
<p>hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Azithromycin has been shown to be active in vitro 
</p>
<p>against Zika and Ebola viruses [20-22] and to prevent severe respiratory tract infections when 
</p>
<p>                  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>administrated to patients suffering viral infection [23]. This finding should be further explored 
</p>
<p>to know whether a combination is more effective especially in severe cases. Speculated 
</p>
<p>potential risk of severe QT prolongation induced by the association of the two drugs has not 
</p>
<p>been established yet but should be considered. As for each treatment, the cost benefits of the 
</p>
<p>risk should be evaluated individually. Further studies on this combination are needed, since 
</p>
<p>such combination may both act as an antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and prevent 
</p>
<p>bacterial super-infections.  
</p>
<p>The cause of failure for hydroxychloroquine treatment should be investigated by testing the 
</p>
<p>isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains of the non-respondents and analyzing their genome, and by 
</p>
<p>analyzing the host factors that may be associated with the metabolism of hydroxychloroquine. 
</p>
<p>The existence of hydroxychloroquine failure in two patients (mother and son) is more 
</p>
<p>suggestive of the last mechanism of resistance. 
</p>
<p>Such results are promising and open the possibility of an international strategy to decision-
</p>
<p>makers to fight this emerging viral infection in real-time even if other strategies and research 
</p>
<p>including vaccine development could be also effective, but only in the future. We therefore 
</p>
<p>recommend that COVID-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to 
</p>
<p>cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb 
</p>
<p>the spread of COVID-19 in the world. Further works are also warranted to determine if these 
</p>
<p>compounds could be useful as chemoprophylaxis to prevent the transmission of the virus, 
</p>
<p>especially for healthcare workers. Our study has some limitations including a small sample 
</p>
<p>size, limited long-term outcome follow-up, and dropout of six patients from the study, 
</p>
<p>however in the current context, we believe that our results should be shared with the scientific 
</p>
<p>community.
