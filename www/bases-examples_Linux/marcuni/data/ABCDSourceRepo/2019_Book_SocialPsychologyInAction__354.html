<p> &ldquo;Nothing as&nbsp;Practical as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Good Theory&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The above maxim is often attributed to psychologist Kurt Lewin. Shortly 
</p>
<p>after his death in 1947, the psychological historian E.&nbsp;C. Tolman wrote of 
</p>
<p>Lewin: &ldquo;Freud the clinician and Lewin the experimentalist&nbsp;&ndash; these are the two 
</p>
<p>men whose names will stand out before all others in the history of our psy-
</p>
<p>chological era&rdquo; (Marrow, 1969). Although Freud has become a household 
</p>
<p>name, Lewin&rsquo;s ideas and work are mostly unknown to the general public. 
</p>
<p>Among psychologists, however, Kurt Lewin is well known as one of the 
</p>
<p>founders of modern experimental social psychology and recognized for his 
</p>
<p>early contributions in applying psychological science to real human society.
</p>
<p>His interest in the social uses of psychological research is evident not 
</p>
<p>only from his work on &ldquo;group dynamics&rdquo;&mdash;a term he coined, involving, for 
</p>
<p>example, research on leadership, communication, and group performance&mdash;
</p>
<p>but also from the applied research institutes he established, such as the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Community Interrelations (McCain, 2015). Indeed, for 
</p>
<p>Lewin, research served a double purpose: &ldquo;to seek deeper explanations of 
</p>
<p>why people behave the way they do and to discover how they may learn to 
</p>
<p>behave better&rdquo; (Marrow, 1969, p. xi; Italics added). Science was, in other 
</p>
<p>words, a way to discover general laws of human functioning as well as a way 
</p>
<p>to solve practical problems, a combination Lewin labeled &ldquo;action research.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, Lewin proposed, there is nothing as practical as a good 
</p>
<p>theory&mdash;a maxim Lewin himself attributed to &ldquo;a business man&rdquo; he once met 
</p>
<p>(Lewin, 1943).
</p>
<p>For Lewin, social psychological theories were useful guides that could 
</p>
<p>help practitioners by providing them with the tools and confidence needed for 
</p>
<p>action (Sandelands, 1990). However, he also noted that &ldquo;we will have to 
</p>
<p>watch out that theory never breaks loose from its proper place as a servant, as 
</p>
<p>a tool for human beings&rdquo; (Lewin, 1943, p.&nbsp;118). What he meant here is that a 
</p>
<p>theory should never be accepted as providing definitive answers on how to 
</p>
<p>address complex social problems, partly because not all theories are good 
</p>
<p>theories (e.g., consistent, falsifiable, parsimonious, precise) and because no 
</p>
<p>theory is necessarily true. Indeed, &ldquo;it may be (partly) true, but it may also be 
</p>
<p>(partly) false. A theory is a set of ideas meant to explain observable events. 
</p>
<p>Appropriate scientific methods are needed to test whether or not a theory 
</p>
<p>achieves this aim. Theories thus are the basis to expand our understanding of 
</p>

as a Good Theory</p>

<p>vi
</p>
<p>the world&rdquo; (Gieseler, Loschelder and Friese, Chap. 1, p. 6). Instead, theories 
</p>
<p>should be used as practical guides enabling a closer examination of why and 
</p>
<p>under what circumstances interventions may be successful in obtaining a 
</p>
<p>desired behavioral or psychological end-state. As we shall see in the follow-
</p>
<p>ing chapters, applying theoretical insights is difficult and its success depends 
</p>
<p>on many factors, not least the specifics of the applied contexts.
</p>
<p> When Social Psychology Turned Away  
from&nbsp;(Applying) Theories
</p>
<p>With the death of Lewin, the interest in the social uses of social psychological 
</p>
<p>knowledge dwindled (for a discussion see Hill, 2006). Some of the reasons 
</p>
<p>for this lack of interest in applied (social psychological) research were already 
</p>
<p>identified by Lewin in 1943. For example, in these early years, properly 
</p>
<p>developed theory was lacking, as were concise, reliable measures of social 
</p>
<p>behavior. Lewin also recognized that a meaningful application of psychologi-
</p>
<p>cal insights requires detailed knowledge of the specific context within which 
</p>
<p>the application takes place. This made applied research much more time con-
</p>
<p>suming and more expensive than experimental research in the lab. Finally, 
</p>
<p>compared to the general laws of human functioning psychologists were look-
</p>
<p>ing for, dealing with nongeneral, applied problems was not looked at with 
</p>
<p>much favor by early social psychologists, or in the words of Singer and Glass 
</p>
<p>(1975, p.&nbsp;16): &ldquo;To be a major contribution a study must deal with basic, not 
</p>
<p>applied, problems.&rdquo; As a consequence, social psychology often had a lot to 
</p>
<p>say in general, but little to say in particular (Deutsch, 1975).
</p>
<p>Another trend that developed over the years, having a detrimental effect on 
</p>
<p>the usefulness of social psychological knowledge for applied problems, was 
</p>
<p>a focus on &ldquo;sexy-hypothesis testing&rdquo; (Fiedler, 2017). Instead of testing and 
</p>
<p>developing social psychological theories, researchers focused on the impact 
</p>
<p>of a single causal factor (often with only two levels) on a single dependent 
</p>
<p>variable with a focus on counter-intuitive outcomes. The predicted effects are 
</p>
<p>binary (i.e., A affects B) rather than quantified in size (i.e., A explains X per-
</p>
<p>cent of variance of B). Even more problematic is the observation that quite a 
</p>
<p>few of these studies violated good scientific practices (e.g., Fiedler &amp; 
</p>
<p>Schwarz, 2016). Studies were often conducted with overly small sample sizes 
</p>
<p>and researchers reverted to several questionable research practices in order to 
</p>
<p>publish their results (for a discussion see Gieseler et&nbsp;al., Chap. 1). For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, when the research was written up, researchers regularly failed to report 
</p>
<p>all dependent measures or even conditions relevant for a finding, and reverted 
</p>
<p>to HARKing (hypothesizing after the results are known; Kerr, 1998), leading 
</p>
<p>authors to report unexpected findings as having been predicted from the start. 
</p>
<p>It is highly likely that such practices have contributed to &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; but invalid 
</p>
<p>findings in the psychological literature. Perhaps the most prominent example 
</p>
<p>is Bem&rsquo;s (2011) article that claimed to provide evidence for pre-cognition 
</p>
<p>(i.e., the ability to foresee the future).
</p>
<p>Many measures have recently been taken to address these problems. Some 
</p>
<p>are at the methodological level, such as journals&rsquo; demands for higher 
</p>
<p>Introduction: Nothing as Practical as a Good Theory </p>
<p/>

<p>vii
</p>
<p> statistical power and the reduction of researchers&rsquo; degrees of freedom in data 
</p>
<p>handling (e.g., through preregistering the study, reporting all measures, con-
</p>
<p>ditions, and cases; Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2012). Strong a priori 
</p>
<p>theories that are cumulatively developed are likewise a powerful measure 
</p>
<p>against this development (Fiedler, 2017). For example, if a study builds upon 
</p>
<p>a theory, HARKing is less of an option because the hypothesis is explicitly 
</p>
<p>stated in the theory or at least derived from it. Moreover, within a theoretical 
</p>
<p>tradition degrees of freedom are lower, given that there are often well- 
</p>
<p>established measures and manipulations that are used in the tradition of the 
</p>
<p>theory. New insights in a theoretical tradition are cumulative (i.e., they add to 
</p>
<p>what is already known) and thus less original. However, findings that relate to 
</p>
<p>and extend what is already known are more likely to be true than those vali-
</p>
<p>dating isolated counter-intuitive hypotheses. This is but one reason why rely-
</p>
<p>ing on theories in the development of knowledge is important: it contributes 
</p>
<p>to the replicability of findings and thus to valid knowledge (cf. Greenwald, 
</p>
<p>Pratkanis, Leippe, &amp; Baumgardner, 1986).
</p>
<p> The Renaissance of&nbsp;Applying Social Psychological 
Theories
</p>
<p>Because social psychology studies the interaction between situational and 
</p>
<p>dispositional forces that influence every day, normal human behavior, such 
</p>
<p>findings have traditionally played an important role in the development of 
</p>
<p>behavioral interventions directed at the amelioration of a wide range of issues 
</p>
<p>across all areas of applied psychology. Indeed, social psychological knowl-
</p>
<p>edge is increasingly recognized as central to many of the challenges the indi-
</p>
<p>vidual, the state, and civil society faces. This is evident, for example, in 
</p>
<p>publications by the World Health Organization recognizing the importance of 
</p>
<p>social determinants for understanding health behavior (e.g., lifestyles, social 
</p>
<p>norms; CSDH, 2008). As a result, social psychological findings are being 
</p>
<p>applied across public, commercial, and charity sectors, often with the goal to 
</p>
<p>influence people and change their behavior.
</p>
<p>To successfully apply social psychological findings, theory is indispens-
</p>
<p>able. Indeed, evidence suggests that interventions with a theoretical basis are 
</p>
<p>more effective than those without a theoretical basis (e.g., Michie &amp; Johnston, 
</p>
<p>2012; Webb, Joseph, Yardley, &amp; Michie, 2010). Theories are not only used to 
</p>
<p>inform intervention design, for instance, to gain ideas what might help and 
</p>
<p>what might not help to change behavior in a certain domain (Heath, Cooke, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Cameron, 2015). They also help to classify interventions according to the 
</p>
<p>underlying concepts and in this way contribute to their effectiveness and 
</p>
<p>inform the integration of evidence (Michie &amp; Prestwich, 2010). Finally, and 
</p>
<p>perhaps most closely to what Lewin or the business man had in mind: theories 
</p>
<p>can guide practitioners and provide them with the confidence needed for 
</p>
<p>action (Sandelands, 1990).
</p>
<p>Social psychological theories play an increasingly important role in 
</p>
<p>attempts to intervene in human behavior. For example, social psychological 
</p>
<p>theorizing has been applied to generate interventions for a wide variety of 
</p>
<p>Introduction: Nothing as Practical as a Good Theory </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>viii
</p>
<p>fields ranging from pro-environmental behavior such as energy conservation 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Abrahamse, Steg, Vlek, &amp; Rothengatter, 2005) to prosocial behavior 
</p>
<p>such as blood donation (e.g., Masser, White, Hyde, &amp; Terry, 2008). More 
</p>
<p>generally, it has been used to facilitate the understanding of numerous phe-
</p>
<p>nomena in the organizational contexts such as leadership (e.g., Ellemers, de 
</p>
<p>Gilder, &amp; Haslam, 2004) or educational settings such as students&rsquo; conflict 
</p>
<p>regulation (e.g., Darnon, Muller, Schrager, Pannuzzo, &amp; Butera, 2006). Many 
</p>
<p>more examples across a variety of applied settings, such as health, political, 
</p>
<p>or consumer behavior, are presented in each of the chapters of this book.
</p>
<p> The Content of&nbsp;This Book
</p>
<p>In this edited volume, we bring together leading scientists in the field of 
</p>
<p>social psychology in order to illustrate how key theories and concepts can be 
</p>
<p>applied to benefit social and practical problems. We dive into social psycho-
</p>
<p>logical literature to illustrate how key theories and the underlying concepts 
</p>
<p>help to predict and explain behavior. We focus on robust theories and models 
</p>
<p>that have been successfully applied, covering a diverse range of settings: 
</p>
<p>from interventions in the classroom to health behavior, and from financial 
</p>
<p>decision making to the reduction of prejudice and discriminatory behavior. 
</p>
<p>With this volume we hope to inform and benefit professionals involved in 
</p>
<p>behavior change. In addition, we want to prepare students of psychology and 
</p>
<p>human behavior to apply their knowledge in later jobs.
</p>
<p>Because theories take center stage in this volume, in Chap. 1 Gieseler, 
</p>
<p>Loschelder, and Friese provide an answer to the fundamental question &ldquo;what 
</p>
<p>is a good theory?&rdquo;. More specifically, this chapter discusses two basic ques-
</p>
<p>tions: (1) what are criteria for evaluating the quality of a psychological the-
</p>
<p>ory, and (2) what are criteria for evaluating the empirical evidence related to 
</p>
<p>a theory. The chapter discusses these criteria by examining one specific the-
</p>
<p>ory and accompanying empirical work as an illustrative example&mdash;the 
</p>
<p>Strength Model of Self-Control (Baumeister &amp; Heatherton, 1996; Baumeister 
</p>
<p>&amp; Vohs, 2016). Although necessarily incomplete, the discussed criteria can 
</p>
<p>be applied to many theories in (social) psychological research. They are 
</p>
<p>therefore relevant not only to basic research, but also to any applied work that 
</p>
<p>is grounded in theory.
</p>
<p>The rest of this book is divided in two main parts. In part I, each chapter 
</p>
<p>discusses a specific social psychological theory and takes a two-step approach. 
</p>
<p>First, a theoretical part will define the key concepts and summarize the the-
</p>
<p>ory, providing evidence for its reliability and limitations from basic research. 
</p>
<p>A second, applied part will summarize research in applied contexts and pro-
</p>
<p>vide details about one particular study including the respective application 
</p>
<p>setting. The aim of this first part of the book is not only to show that theories 
</p>
<p>make meaningful predictions for real-world contexts, but also what the hur-
</p>
<p>dles and pitfalls in applying a theory and the underlying set of concepts in a 
</p>
<p>certain context are. In part II, the chapters take a slightly different approach. 
</p>
<p>Because real-world problems are often highly complex, with a myriad of fac-
</p>
<p>tors that may influence the problem under investigation, in this part chapters 
</p>
<p>Introduction: Nothing as Practical as a Good Theory </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ix
</p>
<p>will approach specific problems from different angles, using relevant con-
</p>
<p>cepts and theory to engage with the applied question. The aim of the second 
</p>
<p>part will be to show how different theoretical insights can be meaningfully 
</p>
<p>combined in order to understand and possibly intervene in a range of social 
</p>
<p>issues.
</p>
<p> Part I
</p>
<p>The first part starts with three chapters presenting theories about motivation. 
</p>
<p>Keller, Bieleke, and Gollwitzer present the mindset theory of action phases 
</p>
<p>(MAP) and implementation intentions in Chap. 2. The MAP describes four 
</p>
<p>different phases people go through during goal pursuit and the specific cogni-
</p>
<p>tive procedures (or mindsets) activated to cope with the demands of each 
</p>
<p>phase. Implementation intentions are if-then plans that are highly efficient in 
</p>
<p>initiating pursuit goals in difficult situations (e.g., when opportunities are 
</p>
<p>likely to be missed). The chapter presents a field example providing evidence 
</p>
<p>for their effectiveness beyond the lab: in this featured study implementation 
</p>
<p>intentions facilitated sustainable consumption.
</p>
<p>Chapter 3, by Guy Roth, presents self-determination theory. In contrast to 
</p>
<p>MAP, self-determination theory is not concerned with the process of goal 
</p>
<p>pursuit but with the question whether the source of people&rsquo;s motivation is 
</p>
<p>autonomous or externally controlled&mdash;in other words whether the striving is 
</p>
<p>determined by oneself or by others. The theory and the chapter name anteced-
</p>
<p>ents and beneficial consequences of autonomous motivation. The external 
</p>
<p>validity of the theory is demonstrated in a featured intervention study show-
</p>
<p>ing that training teachers to educate students in a way that facilitates autono-
</p>
<p>mous motivation increases this type of motivation as well as students&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>performance.
</p>
<p>Chapter 4, by Sassenberg and Vliek, targets yet another aspect of motiva-
</p>
<p>tion, namely the selection of means. It presents regulatory focus theory, 
</p>
<p>which provides insights about people&rsquo;s strategies for mean selection during 
</p>
<p>goal striving. In addition, regulatory fit theory is discussed, which states that 
</p>
<p>engagement is higher in case there is a fit between people&rsquo;s preferred strategy 
</p>
<p>and the strategic demands of a context (e.g., when people prefer to act care-
</p>
<p>fully and the context requires exactly that strategy). After discussion of sev-
</p>
<p>eral applied contexts, a featured intervention study is described, showing that 
</p>
<p>communication fitting with recipients&rsquo; preferred self-regulation strategy 
</p>
<p>leads to more physical activity than communication not fitting recipients pre-
</p>
<p>ferred strategy.
</p>
<p>Following these chapters on motivation, Chaps. 5, 6, and 7 focus on a 
</p>
<p>variety of forms of social influence. Chapter 5 by Verplanken and Orbell dis-
</p>
<p>cusses habits and how they can be changed despite their rigidity. The authors 
</p>
<p>describe what habits are and what they do, such as effects on information 
</p>
<p>processing, the relationship with intentions, and the &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo; of habits. 
</p>
<p>Evidence for the real-world relevance of Verplanken and Orbell&rsquo;s theorizing 
</p>
<p>comes from a study showing that moving (i.e., the change of an individual&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Introduction: Nothing as Practical as a Good Theory </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>x
</p>
<p>social environment) provides a window of opportunity for habit change using 
</p>
<p>the case of sustainable behavior (e.g., energy saving behaviors).
</p>
<p>In Chap. 6, M&uuml;hlberger and Jonas present theorizing about motivated 
</p>
<p>resistance against social influence (rather than unintended rigidity in the case 
</p>
<p>of habits). The chapter discusses the concept of and theorizing about reac-
</p>
<p>tance&mdash;a motivational state directed toward restoring or securing freedom&mdash;
</p>
<p>that often occurs in response to undesired social influence. Several 
</p>
<p>preconditions and consequences of reactance are discussed, followed by a 
</p>
<p>discussion of several fields of application and an illustration of an applied 
</p>
<p>study of reactance theory to political behavior.
</p>
<p>The final chapter relating to social influence comes from Stok and de 
</p>
<p>Ridder. In Chap. 7 they present the focus theory of normative conduct. Norms 
</p>
<p>are a means of social influence as they provide individuals with decisional 
</p>
<p>shortcuts on how to behave in certain situations. They either refer to typical 
</p>
<p>behavior (descriptive norms) or appropriate behavior (injunctive norms). The 
</p>
<p>chapter specifies the conditions under which norms assert an influence on 
</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s behavior. Finally, the featured intervention study provides evidence 
</p>
<p>that norms have the power to influence people&rsquo;s pro-environmental behavior, 
</p>
<p>if they are communicated in the right way.
</p>
<p>The next three chapters turn to social groups. In Chap. 8 Butera and Buchs 
</p>
<p>present interdependence theory&mdash;a theory making predictions about the 
</p>
<p>implication of the (perceived) requirement to cooperate or to compete while 
</p>
<p>working on a task. Based on this theory the chapter discusses the precondi-
</p>
<p>tions for successful cooperation and features a study demonstrating that these 
</p>
<p>conditions indeed assert a positive influence on cooperation in the 
</p>
<p>classroom.
</p>
<p>Turning from interpersonal relations (and the interdependence structure) 
</p>
<p>to the relation individuals have to groups as a whole, Scheepers and Ellemers 
</p>
<p>present social identity theory in Chap. 9. This theory posits that group mem-
</p>
<p>berships contribute to people&rsquo;s self-concepts: the so-called social identity. 
</p>
<p>The chapter presents an overview of work on social identity and its applica-
</p>
<p>tions to health and organizational settings. The external validity of the theory 
</p>
<p>is demonstrated in two studies describing a social identity-based intervention 
</p>
<p>for improving intergroup relations in an educational setting.
</p>
<p>Chapter 10 by Christ and Kauff turns from single groups to intergroup 
</p>
<p>relations. It summarizes intergroup contact theory, which states the condi-
</p>
<p>tions under which contact between members of different social groups con-
</p>
<p>tribute to the improvement of the attitudes toward the respective outgroup. It 
</p>
<p>features two studies demonstrating the successful improvement of attitudes 
</p>
<p>toward outgroup members in heated intergroup conflicts, namely the Israeli- 
</p>
<p>Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda.
</p>
<p>The section on single theories and their application is closed by two social 
</p>
<p>cognitive theories. Chapter 11 by Wittenbrink, Correll, and Ma takes a differ-
</p>
<p>ent approach to intergroup relations and targets so-called implicit prejudice&mdash;
</p>
<p>that is, the automatically activated attitudes associated with certain groups. 
</p>
<p>The chapter summarizes the social cognitive processes by which these atti-
</p>
<p>tudes assert an influence on people&rsquo;s behavior toward members of these 
</p>
<p>groups. A featured study is summarized showing that these attitudes have the 
</p>
<p>Introduction: Nothing as Practical as a Good Theory </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xi
</p>
<p>potential (among police officers) to lead to a higher likelihood to shoot an 
</p>
<p>African American compared to a White American suspect.
</p>
<p>Finally, in Chap. 12, Bernecker and Job present mindset theory (not to be 
</p>
<p>confused with the mindset theory of action phases, MAP) distinguishing 
</p>
<p>between entity mindsets&mdash;laypeople&rsquo;s assumption that people&rsquo;s characteris-
</p>
<p>tics on a certain domain are stable&mdash;and incremental theorists&mdash;laypeople&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>assumption that characteristics are malleable. The implications of these 
</p>
<p>implicit theories across a number of domains are summarized, leading to the 
</p>
<p>conclusion that holding an incremental theory is beneficial in many instances. 
</p>
<p>This is illustrated in a featured intervention study showing the benefits of an 
</p>
<p>incremental mindset for victims of bullying.
</p>
<p> Part II
</p>
<p>The final three chapters form the second part of the book. Here several theo-
</p>
<p>retical insights are used in order to understand and possibly intervene in a 
</p>
<p>range of real-world problems. This part starts with Chap. 13 by van der Werf, 
</p>
<p>van Dijk, Wilderjans, van Dillen on how to promote healthy financial behav-
</p>
<p>ior (i.e., putting money aside in savings to cover unexpected and necessary 
</p>
<p>expenses). This chapter discusses a number of (social) psychological &ldquo;hur-
</p>
<p>dles&rdquo; that may contribute to many people&rsquo;s failure to put money aside for 
</p>
<p>future financial needs. The chapter closes with a discussion of two interven-
</p>
<p>tion studies using these insights to improve people&rsquo;s saving behavior.
</p>
<p>In Chap. 14, Utz discusses the impact of social media use on people&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>emotions. The chapter discusses a number of phenomena and theories that 
</p>
<p>can explain why and how social media affect people&rsquo;s emotions and guide 
</p>
<p>their behavior. It features a study demonstrating that the emotions elicited by 
</p>
<p>social media can even guide consumer behavior.
</p>
<p>Finally, Chap. 15 by Dinnick and Noor explores what might determine 
</p>
<p>how a group responds to the suffering it has experienced at the hand of 
</p>
<p>another group. It introduces the concept of intergroup forgiveness and dis-
</p>
<p>cusses its potent promise in facilitating conflicting groups to transform from 
</p>
<p>mutual enmity to peaceful coexistence. The authors analyze the role of social 
</p>
<p>identity, victim belief construals (the way the group frames its suffering), and 
</p>
<p>their potential interplay as possible determinants of forgiveness. They review 
</p>
<p>empirical research based on studies conducted with groups caught up in real- 
</p>
<p>life conflict settings (e.g., Israel-Palestine, Northern Ireland). The chapter 
</p>
<p>presents several theory-based intervention studies oriented toward healing 
</p>
<p>fractured intergroup relations.
</p>
<p> Didactic Features
</p>
<p>The chapters in this book are equipped with a number of didactic features that 
</p>
<p>should ease the deep level learning of the content and the elaboration of ideas. 
</p>
<p>First, there are boxes in the text that serve different functions. Definition 
</p>
<p>boxes give definitions of the main constructs and thereby highlight these 
</p>
<p>Introduction: Nothing as Practical as a Good Theory </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xii
</p>
<p>important concepts. Each chapter also includes a short summary section at the 
</p>
<p>end, which also highlights key content. Zooming-in boxes illustrate topics 
</p>
<p>more in depth and, thus, provide more background or point to relevant other 
</p>
<p>theorizing. Here, other/conflicting theoretical approaches and laboratory or 
</p>
<p>field studies are summarized that may help to integrate the content of the 
</p>
<p>chapter with other theories or content. If you want to zoom-in even further, 
</p>
<p>the list of recommended readings at the end of each chapter will provide a 
</p>
<p>guideline where to find more information about the theories and research 
</p>
<p>questions presented in each chapter. Questions for elaboration are sup-
</p>
<p>posed to stimulate engagement with the text and provide the opportunity to 
</p>
<p>develop the presented literature a bit further. These are often open-ended 
</p>
<p>questions with no definite answer, but sample responses are included at the 
</p>
<p>end of the chapters.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>The present chapter differs from the others you 
</p>
<p>will read in this book: Chapters in the first section 
</p>
<p>present a specific theory and elaborate on 
</p>
<p>research in applied contexts, in which the respec-
</p>
<p>tive theory has been used. Chapters in the second 
</p>
<p>section start out with a real-world phenomenon 
</p>
<p>and explain how different psychological theories 
</p>
<p>can help to better understand human behavior or 
</p>
<p>contribute to solving real-world problems. In the 
</p>
<p>present chapter, we take a step back and discuss 
</p>
<p>how the quality of a theory and the quality of its 
</p>
<p>accompanying empirical foundation can be eval-
</p>
<p>uated. In doing so, we distinguish between two 
</p>
<p>different perspectives, the theoretical perspective 
</p>
<p>(Does a theory meet general criteria of a good 
</p>
<p>theory?) and the empirical perspective (How sci-
</p>
<p>entifically sound is the research related to a 
</p>
<p>theory?).
</p>
<p>In the first part of this chapter, we introduce 
</p>
<p>the Strength Model of Self-Control (Baumeister &amp; 
</p>
<p>Heatherton, 1996; Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2016). 
</p>
<p>The model will serve as an illustrative reference 
</p>
<p>point throughout the chapter. It is one of the most 
</p>
<p>prominent, researched, and debated theories in 
</p>
<p>social psychology of the last 25&nbsp;years. Using this 
</p>
<p>concrete example hopefully renders the subsequent 
</p>
<p>discussion of (sometimes) abstract questions and 
</p>
<p>concepts more tangible.</p>

</p>
<p>The second part of the chapter addresses basic 
</p>
<p>questions relating to scientific theorizing, such 
</p>
<p>as: What is a theory? Why do we need theories? 
</p>
<p>And what makes for a good theory? We first dis-
</p>
<p>cuss criteria for evaluating theories in general 
</p>
<p>before applying them to the Strength Model.
</p>
<p>In the third part, we examine criteria to evalu-
</p>
<p>ate how theories fare on the empirical side. 
</p>
<p>Again, we first discuss criteria for the quality of 
</p>
<p>empirical work in general before applying them 
</p>
<p>to the Strength Model.
</p>
<p> The Strength Model of&nbsp;Self-Control
</p>
<p>The Strength Model of Self-Control (Baumeister 
</p>
<p>&amp; Heatherton, 1996; Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2016) 
</p>
<p>originated from observations from everyday life: 
</p>
<p>When reviewing a large and diverse literature, 
</p>
<p>Baumeister and colleagues observed that people 
</p>
<p>who have difficulties following their long-term 
</p>
<p>goals in one life domain often experience similar 
</p>
<p>difficulties in other domains as well. The authors 
</p>
<p>also noticed that self-control failures tend to 
</p>
<p>occur more frequently after long and tiring days, 
</p>
<p>in stressful times, or when demands are unusu-
</p>
<p>ally high. They concluded that people behave as 
</p>
<p>if self-control was a general capacity that is lim-
</p>
<p>ited and can be depleted.
</p>
<p>In their Strength Model, the authors employed 
</p>
<p>the analogy of a (self-control) muscle that 
</p>
<p>becomes tired with use. The model makes two 
</p>
<p>central assumptions: First, self-control draws on 
</p>
<p>a limited resource; the exertion of self-control 
</p>
<p>increases the probability of self-control failure in 
</p>
<p>subsequent attempts. Second, self-control is a 
</p>
<p>domain-general construct. An exertion of self- 
</p>
<p>control in one domain will increase the likelihood 
</p>
<p>of self-control failure in any other domain that 
</p>
<p>requires self-control. The Strength Model thus 
</p>
<p>assumes a cause-effect relation between the exer-
</p>
<p>tion of self-control and the subsequent impair-
</p>
<p>ment in self-control performance. Baumeister 
</p>
<p>and colleagues referred to the state of reduced 
</p>
<p>self-control resources as ego depletion.
</p>
<p>One important implication of the theory&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>assumptions is that self-control can be improved 
</p>
<p>with practice: If self-control works like a muscle, 
</p>
<p>the repeated exertion of self-control should lead 
</p>
<p>to repeated states of ego depletion, but, in the 
</p>
<p>long run, the muscle should be strengthened, and 
</p>
<p>the overall self-control ability should improve 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Job, Friese, &amp; Bernecker, 2015; Muraven, 
</p>
<p>2010; for meta-analyses, see Beames, Schofield, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Denson, 2017; Friese, Frankenbach, Job, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Loschelder, 2017). In the present chapter, we 
</p>
<p>focus on those aspects of the Strength Model that 
</p>
<p>are concerned with the ego depletion effect 
</p>
<p>rather than with the trainability hypothesis.
</p>
<p>To test the model&rsquo;s core assumptions in the 
</p>
<p>psychological laboratory, Baumeister and col-
</p>
<p>leagues developed the sequential task paradigm: 
</p>
<p>They had participants work on two sequential 
</p>
<p>tasks demanding self-control and measured their 
</p>
<p>performance in the second task as a function of 
</p>
<p>whether the first task was high or low in self- 
</p>
<p>control demands (e.g., Baumeister, Bratlavsky, 
</p>
<p>Muraven, &amp; Tice, 1998). Hundreds of studies fol-
</p>
<p>lowing this paradigm have provided evidence for 
</p>
<p>this ego depletion effect (for reviews and meta- 
</p>
<p>analyses, see Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2016; Carter, 
</p>
<p>Kofler, Forster, &amp; McCullough, 2015; Hagger, 
</p>
<p>Wood, Stiff, &amp; Chatzisarantis, 2010; Hirt, 
</p>
<p>Clarkson, Egan, &amp; Eyink, 2016). For example, 
</p>
<p>Muraven, Collins, and Neinhaus (2002) had par-
</p>
<p>ticipants either suppress their thoughts in a first 
</p>
<p>task (which requires self-control) or not. Those 
</p>
<p>who exerted self-control in the first task consumed

<p>more beer during a subsequent taste test, even 
</p>
<p>though participants knew they were about to do a 
</p>
<p>driving test afterward. In another exemplary 
</p>
<p>study, chronic dieters who suppressed their emo-
</p>
<p>tional reactions to a sad video (a self-control 
</p>
<p>demanding task) later consumed more ice cream 
</p>
<p>during a product test than those who were 
</p>
<p>instructed to react naturally while watching the 
</p>
<p>video (Vohs &amp; Heatherton, 2000).
</p>
<p>Despite the seemingly abundant evidence in 
</p>
<p>favor of the Strength Model, the model and its 
</p>
<p>accompanying empirical work have been heavily 
</p>
<p>criticized in recent years. These criticisms go so 
</p>
<p>far that many researchers doubt that the ego 
</p>
<p>depletion effect is a real phenomenon after all. 
</p>
<p>We will elaborate on some of these issues that 
</p>
<p>have been criticized in later parts of this chapter 
</p>
<p>(for an overview of the debate, see Friese, 
</p>
<p>Loschelder, Gieseler, Frankenbach, &amp; Inzlicht, 
</p>
<p>2019).
</p>
<p> Behavioral Versus&nbsp;Process Level 
of&nbsp;Psychological Phenomena
</p>
<p>Before we turn to the discussion of criteria to 
</p>
<p>evaluate a theory, we need to introduce an impor-
</p>
<p>tant distinction between two different levels of 
</p>
<p>analysis that will guide our further thinking: the 
</p>
<p>distinction between the behavioral and the 
</p>
<p>process level (also referred to as &ldquo;functional&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; level of analysis, see De Houwer, 
</p>
<p>2011; Fig.&nbsp;1.1). The behavioral level of analysis 
</p>
<p>defines behavioral effects exclusively in terms of 
</p>
<p>changes in elements of the environment that cause 
</p>
<p>behavioral changes on a dependent variable. For 
</p>
<p>instance, insulting someone increases aggressive 
</p>
<p>behavior in the insulted person. By contrast, the 
</p>
<p>process level of analysis refers to the underlying 
</p>
<p>mental processes that are triggered by elements in 
</p>
<p>the environment and are responsible for subse-
</p>
<p>quent changes on a dependent variable. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, an insult may trigger anger that then translates 
</p>
<p>into aggressive behavior. These two levels of 
</p>
<p>analysis must not be conflated. In the words of De 
</p>
<p>Houwer (2011, p.&nbsp;201):
</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; using behavioral effects as a proxy for mental 
</p>
<p>constructs violates the general scientific principle 
</p>
<p>that the explanandum (that which needs to be 
</p>
<p>explained; in this case, behavioral effects) needs to 
</p>
<p>be kept separate from the explanans (that which is 
</p>
<p>used to explain; in this case, mental constructs; 
</p>
<p>Hempel, 1970).&rdquo;

<p>Box 1.1 Questions for Elaboration
</p>
<p> 1. Assume the Strength Model of Self- 
</p>
<p>Control is accurate. Think about activi-
</p>
<p>ties in your daily life that should lead to 
</p>
<p>depletion-like effects.
</p>
<p> 2. Think about possible strategies that you 
</p>
<p>could use to counteract ego depletion 
</p>
<p>effects in your daily life. These could 
</p>
<p>be strategies that you have used your-
</p>
<p>self or that you may know from other 
</p>
<p>chapters in this book (e.g., Rubicon 
</p>
<p>model and implementation intentions, 
</p>
<p>Keller et al., Chap. 2; Mindset theory, 
</p>
<p>Bernecker &amp; Job, Chap. 12).
</p>
<p> 3. Can you think of situations when your 
</p>
<p>self-control felt unlimited? How did these 
</p>
<p>situations differ from when you felt 
</p>
<p>depleted, lacking ability to self-control?
</p>
<p> 4. Assume the Strength Model of Self- 
</p>
<p>Control was inaccurate: The ability to 
</p>
<p>exert self-control was not limited. What 
</p>
<p>would your daily life and the world 
</p>
<p>more generally look like? Any different 
</p>
<p>from the present reality?
</p>
<p>1 What Makes for&nbsp;a&nbsp;Good Theory? How to&nbsp;Evaluate a&nbsp;Theory Using the&nbsp;Strength Model of&nbsp;Self-Control&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6
</p>
<p>The Strength Model makes assumptions on 
</p>
<p>both levels of analysis. On the behavioral level, it 
</p>
<p>states that the initial exertion of self-control 
</p>
<p>causes a subsequent impairment in self-control 
</p>
<p>performance, linking two elements in the envi-
</p>
<p>ronment: self-control exertion at time one and 
</p>
<p>impaired self-control performance at time two 
</p>
<p>(relative to a control group). On the process level, 
</p>
<p>the model assumes that the behavioral effect is 
</p>
<p>mediated by the depletion of an internal, limited 
</p>
<p>resource (the nature of this resource is not further 
</p>
<p>defined). For present purposes, the distinction is 
</p>
<p>important as there are several other theoretical 
</p>
<p>models beyond the Strength Model seeking to 
</p>
<p>explain the same behavioral phenomenon (behav-
</p>
<p>ioral level) with fundamentally different assump-
</p>
<p>tions concerning the underlying process (process 
</p>
<p>level; for further reading see, e.g., De Witt Huberts, 
</p>
<p>Evers, &amp; De Ridder, 2014; Evans, Boggero, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Segerstrom, 2015; Inzlicht, Schmeichel, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Macrae, 2014).
</p>
<p> Theoretical Perspective: Criteria 
to&nbsp;Evaluate the&nbsp;Quality of&nbsp;Theories
</p>
<p>Having briefly described the Strength Model&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>basic assumptions and some accompanying 
</p>
<p>empirical evidence, let us take a step back: the 
</p>
<p>empirical foundation aside, is the Strength Model 
</p>
<p>a &ldquo;good&rdquo; theory to start with? And more gener-
</p>
<p>ally, what makes for a good theory? In science, a 
</p>
<p>theory constitutes one or several joined-up 
</p>
<p> principles that are meant to describe, explain, and 
</p>
<p>predict a phenomenon or several related phenom-
</p>
<p>ena (Estrada &amp; Schultz, 2017). A theory is not 
</p>
<p>necessarily true. It may be (partly) true, but it 
</p>
<p>may also be (partly) false. A theory is a set of 
</p>
<p>ideas meant to explain observable events. 
</p>
<p>Appropriate scientific methods are needed to test 
</p>
<p>whether or not a theory achieves this aim. 
</p>
<p>Theories thus are the basis to expand our under-
</p>
<p>standing of the world. For social psychologists, 
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 Levels of scientific analysis for the example of 
the ego depletion effect. The behavioral level denotes the 
</p>
<p>cause-effect relation: The exertion of self-control leads to 
</p>
<p>subsequent impairments in self-control performance 
</p>
<p>(gray arrow). The process level refers to the underlying 
</p>
<p>psychological mechanisms that are triggered by the exer-
</p>
<p>tion of self-control&mdash;that is, the mechanisms on the pro-
</p>
<p>cess level are causally responsible for the behavioral 
</p>
<p>effect. (White arrows via question mark; adapted from

</p>
<p>they are the starting point for interventions to 
</p>
<p>address individual and social problems and to 
</p>
<p>change problematic behavior (see second section 
</p>
<p>of this book: Combining theoretical insights: 
</p>
<p>Addressing complex human behavior).
</p>
<p>Taking the Strength Model as an example, one 
</p>
<p>could say that the model&rsquo;s two main assump-
</p>
<p>tions&mdash;limited resource and domain-general con-
</p>
<p>struct&mdash;are meant to predict and explain the 
</p>
<p>phenomenon of impaired self-control performance 
</p>
<p>after the exertion of self-control. This pertains to 
</p>
<p>the psychological laboratory and to people&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>everyday life. In the long run, if the model stands 
</p>
<p>the test of time, interventions based on the Strength 
</p>
<p>Model may thus address self- control failures 
</p>
<p>across various domains often challenging self-
</p>
<p>control such as eating, drinking, exercising, social 
</p>
<p>interactions, and procrastination, among others.
</p>
<p>Not all theories are good theories, however. 
</p>
<p>And to distinguish the good from the not so good, 
</p>
<p>there are several criteria to consider. Here, we 
</p>
<p>focus on six criteria, namely, consistency, preci-
</p>
<p>sion, parsimony, generality, falsifiability, and 
</p>
<p>progress, while omitting (partly overlapping) cri-
</p>
<p>teria such as refutability or truth (see Gawronski 
</p>
<p>&amp; Bodenhausen, 2015; Van Lange, 2013; see 
</p>
<p>Table&nbsp;1.1). Due to space restrictions, our list and 
</p>
<p>discussion are necessarily incomplete. A more in- 
</p>
<p>depth treatment can be found in Gawronski and 
</p>
<p>Bodenhausen (2015), our primary source for this 
</p>
<p>part of the chapter. We start each of the following 
</p>
<p>sections by first defining the respective criterion 
</p>
<p>and then subsequently applying the criterion to 
</p>
<p>the Strength Model.
</p>
<p> Consistency
</p>
<p>One obvious characteristic of a good theory is 
</p>
<p>consistency with empirical observations. If a the-
</p>
<p>ory does not correspond to empirical observa-
</p>
<p>tions in the laboratory and/or the real world, it is 
</p>
<p>necessary to adjust the theory (or to refute it). 
</p>
<p>Sometimes a theory turns out to have merit only 
</p>
<p>after some conceptual adjustment. For example, 
</p>
<p>research may identify boundary conditions that 
</p>
<p>specify when predictions derived from the theory 
</p>
<p>do or do not apply. If after adjustments a theory 
</p>
<p>still is not consistent with empirical observations 
</p>
<p>to a satisfactory extent, it may be necessary to 
</p>
<p>abandon the theory.
</p>
<p>The Strength Model originates from the obser-
</p>
<p>vation in the psychological literature that in 
</p>
<p>everyday life people seem more likely to fail at 
</p>
<p>controlling themselves after previously exerting 
</p>
<p>self-control. An inconsistent observation is that 
</p>
<p>there seem to be other situations in everyday life 
</p>
<p>in which people appear to have no difficulty to

</p>
<p>resist their temptations and to successfully 
</p>
<p>control their impulses&mdash;even after a demanding 
</p>
<p>previous task. These observations alone do not 
</p>
<p>mean that the Strength Model has to be aban-
</p>
<p>doned. Indeed, several situational and disposi-
</p>
<p>tional moderators have been identified that 
</p>
<p>presumably prevent or counteract ego depletion 
</p>
<p>effects (for a review, see Loschelder &amp; Friese, 
</p>
<p>2016). For example, affirming core personal val-
</p>
<p>ues (Schmeichel &amp; Vohs, 2009) or being incen-
</p>
<p>tivized to perform well have been shown to 
</p>
<p>counteract ego depletion effects (Luethi et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2016; Muraven &amp; Slessareva, 2003). In a similar 
</p>
<p>vein, holding a subjective theory that self-control 
</p>
<p>is non-limited (Job, Dweck, &amp; Walton, 2010; 
</p>
<p>Bernecker &amp; Job, Chap. 12) or having a high 
</p>
<p>disposition for action orientation (Gr&ouml;pel, 
</p>
<p>Baumeister, &amp; Beckmann, 2014) has been found 
</p>
<p>to prevent the occurrence of ego depletion. In all, 
</p>
<p>boundary conditions are crucial and need to be 
</p>
<p>defined well in order to account for theory- 
</p>
<p>consistent and inconsistent findings.
</p>
<p>Another (potentially greater) problem for the 
</p>
<p>Strength Model stems from the increasing num-
</p>
<p>ber of studies that fail to find ego depletion effects 
</p>
<p>without moderating variables being able to 
</p>
<p>explain these inconsistent data (e.g., Etherton 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2018; Lurquin et&nbsp;al., 2016; Osgood, 2017; 
</p>
<p>Singh &amp; G&ouml;ritz, 2018; Vadillo, Gold, &amp; Osman, 
</p>
<p>2018). The empirical evidence does not seem to 
</p>
<p>as consistently support the theoretical assump-
</p>
<p>tions as was believed for many years. From our 
</p>
<p>perspective, conceptual and empirical work is 
</p>
<p>necessary to address this lack of consistency 
</p>
<p>(especially in light of doubts about the ability 
</p>
<p>of earlier empirical work on the model to lead 
</p>
<p>to firm conclusions, see below and Friese et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>in press). Otherwise, a lack of consistency will 
</p>
<p>seriously threaten the state of the Strength Model 
</p>
<p>as a respected theory.
</p>
<p> Precision
</p>
<p>A good theory is precise, with clearly defined 
</p>
<p>concepts and operationalizations that allow for 
</p>
<p>little stretching or subjective interpretation. 
</p>
<p>The more precise the formulation of a theory and 
</p>
<p>its background assumptions, the less ambiguous 
</p>
<p>it is for researchers to decide which empirical 
</p>
<p>observations are consistent versus inconsistent 
</p>
<p>with the theory (Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 
</p>
<p>2015). Thus, precision increases the chances of 
</p>
<p>collecting both supporting and refuting empirical 
</p>
<p>evidence for a theory. Imprecise theories leave 
</p>
<p>room for subjective interpretation of empirical 
</p>
<p>findings.
</p>
<p>Precision is not a strength of the Strength 
</p>
<p>Model. One problem of the theory is shared with 
</p>
<p>the field of self-control research in general: a pre-
</p>
<p>cise (and widely accepted) definition of self- 
</p>
<p>control is lacking. Baumeister and Vohs (2016, 
</p>
<p>p.&nbsp;70) define self-control &ldquo;as processes by which 
</p>
<p>the self intentionally alters its own responses, 
</p>
<p>including thoughts, emotions, impulses, perfor-
</p>
<p>mance, and behaviors, based on standards.&rdquo; This 
</p>
<p>definition encompasses a great part of what peo-
</p>
<p>ple intentionally do when awake. But not every 
</p>
<p>time a person intentionally alters her own 
</p>
<p>responses to be in line with her standards, she will 
</p>
<p>exert effortful self-control leading to depletion 
</p>
<p>effects. For example, picture a person writing an 
</p>
<p>official Email in line with orthography and gram-
</p>
<p>mar. Writing requires altering one&rsquo;s responses 
</p>
<p>based on standards (the norms of orthography and 
</p>
<p>grammar). But for someone educated enough to 
</p>
<p>write decently, this is so low- minded that it seems 
</p>
<p>implausible to assume that such a task will easily 
</p>
<p>lead to discernable depletion- type effects. Thus, 
</p>
<p>this definition of self-control may be too unspe-
</p>
<p>cific and likely too broad. Similar points can be 
</p>
<p>made with respect to the alternative definition of 
</p>
<p>self-control provided in the Definition box earlier 
</p>
<p>in this chapter. In all fairness, somewhat vague 
</p>
<p>and imprecise conceptual definitions are nothing 
</p>
<p>unique to the Strength Model, but a feature shared 
</p>
<p>with many other theories and research fields in 
</p>
<p>(social) psychology.
</p>
<p>The imprecise definition of self-control is rel-
</p>
<p>evant for the antecedent of impaired self-control 
</p>
<p>(i.e., the independent variable in experimental 
</p>
<p>studies). Here, it pertains to the behavioral level 
</p>
<p>of analysis: What exactly are properties of a valid 
</p>
<p>manipulation that allow for a stringent test of the 
</p>
<p>model, independent of the behavioral effect it 
</p>
<p>may or may not evoke?

</p>
<p>The Strength Model&rsquo;s lack of precision 
</p>
<p>becomes especially apparent on the process level: 
</p>
<p>The model postulates the reduction of a &ldquo;limited 
</p>
<p>resource&rdquo; as the crucial underlying mechanism 
</p>
<p>that is causally responsible for impaired self- 
</p>
<p>control performance. However, the model does 
</p>
<p>not specify the nature of this resource in any way. 
</p>
<p>In consequence, the model remains too imprecise 
</p>
<p>to test one of its core assumptions as it is impos-
</p>
<p>sible to measure an unknown resource.1
</p>
<p>The lack of precision on the behavioral and 
</p>
<p>process level may contribute to the problems and 
</p>
<p>reproaches that ego depletion research is facing: 
</p>
<p>If researchers do not precisely know how to 
</p>
<p>manipulate the exertion of self-control, it is diffi-
</p>
<p>cult to distinguish a nonsignificant result caused 
</p>
<p>by a wrong theory from a nonsignificant result 
</p>
<p>caused by an unapt experimental manipulation. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, it is impossible to provide conclusive 
</p>
<p>evidence supporting the underlying process 
</p>
<p>assumptions, if the model does not provide clear 
</p>
<p>guidance about the properties of this very resource 
</p>
<p>(or how to measure it).
</p>
<p> Parsimony
</p>
<p>A good theory explains more with less. When 
</p>
<p>developing a theory, one possibility is to start 
</p>
<p>with observations, to abstract and generalize 
</p>
<p>them, and to create joined-up principles (see defi-
</p>
<p>nition above). In a next step, the theorist cuts out 
</p>
<p>all superfluous elements. A straightforward for-
</p>
<p>mula remains that predicts a multitude of events 
</p>
<p>with as few assumptions as possible. Hence, 
</p>
<p>when comparing two theories that both explain 
</p>
<p>the same set of empirical observations, the theory 
</p>
<p>with fewer assumptions is superior in terms of 
</p>
<p>parsimony.
</p>
<p>The Strength Model is very parsimonious as it 
</p>
<p>originally made only two central assumptions 
</p>
<p>(domain generality and limited resource). Many 
</p>
<p>1 Some earlier studies had suggested that blood glucose 
</p>
<p>levels may be this underlying limited resource, but this 
</p>
<p>idea has been dismissed on both logical, physiological, 
</p>
<p>and empirical grounds (Dang, 2016; Kurzban, 2010; 
</p>
<p>Vadillo, Gold, &amp; Osman, 2016; but see Ampel, Muraven, 
</p>
<p>&amp; McNay, 2018, for a different perspective).
</p>
<p>(social) psychological theories make many more 
</p>
<p>than just two central assumptions (e.g., Social 
</p>
<p>Identity Theory, Scheepers &amp; Ellemers, Chap. 9; 
</p>
<p>Social Learning Theory, Bandura, 1977; General 
</p>
<p>Aggression Model, Bushman &amp; Anderson, 2002). 
</p>
<p>Excessive parsimony comes with the downside 
</p>
<p>that it may impair consistency&mdash;thus eventually 
</p>
<p>requiring conceptual additions to a theory. Future 
</p>
<p>research will reveal if failures to detect the ego 
</p>
<p>depletion effect can be accounted for by such 
</p>
<p>boundary conditions (moderators) and auxiliary 
</p>
<p>assumptions&mdash;at the cost of parsimony. 
</p>
<p>(Alternatively, failures to find ego depletion 
</p>
<p>effects may also be due to problems discussed 
</p>
<p>later in the section &ldquo;Empirical perspective&rdquo;).
</p>
<p> Generality
</p>
<p>Generality refers to a theory&rsquo;s quality to apply to 
</p>
<p>various fields, situations, or domains of behavior. 
</p>
<p>Although theoretical parsimony is an asset of a 
</p>
<p>theory, explanatory breadth is as well.
</p>
<p>The Strength Model fares very well concern-
</p>
<p>ing this criterion: The proposed explanatory 
</p>
<p>breadth of the model is unusually large. A wide 
</p>
<p>array of behaviors in almost all spheres of life 
</p>
<p>require self-control and may&mdash;if the theory is 
</p>
<p>right&mdash;evoke ego depletion effects. Likewise, 
</p>
<p>according to the Strength Model, exerting self- 
</p>
<p>control may have an impact on a multitude of 
</p>
<p>behaviors in a variety of areas, all of which 
</p>
<p>therefore should be susceptible to ego depletion 
</p>
<p>effects.
</p>
<p> Falsifiability
</p>
<p>No matter how much empirical evidence has 
</p>
<p>been gathered that is consistent with a theory, the 
</p>
<p>theory can never be inductively &ldquo;proven&rdquo; to be 
</p>
<p>true&mdash;it is always possible that one day an obser-
</p>
<p>vation inconsistent with the theory emerges 
</p>
<p>(Popper, 1959). All the more important, a theory 
</p>
<p>has to be falsifiable. If a theory is formulated in a 
</p>
<p>way that makes it impossible to observe some-
</p>
<p>thing that is prohibited by the theory&rsquo;s assump-
</p>
<p>tions, it is unfalsifiable and therefore not a good 
</p>
<p>1 What Makes for&nbsp;a&nbsp;Good Theory? How to&nbsp;Evaluate a&nbsp;Theory Using the&nbsp;Strength Model of&nbsp;Self-Control&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>10
</p>
<p>theory (e.g., the claim &ldquo;the exertion of self-con-
</p>
<p>trol subsequently leads to better, poorer or 
</p>
<p>unchanged self-control performance&rdquo; would make 
</p>
<p>the theory unfalsifiable). It is, of course, possible to 
</p>
<p>define already mentioned auxiliary assumptions or 
</p>
<p>boundary conditions to explain observations that 
</p>
<p>initially appear inconsistent with the theory. 
</p>
<p>However, every inconsistent observation must not 
</p>
<p>lead to the development of a new auxiliary assump-
</p>
<p>tion specifying a new exception. Especially if there 
</p>
<p>are more exceptions to the theory than standard 
</p>
<p>cases, a theory becomes unfalsifiable (see also cri-
</p>
<p>terion of Parsimony).
</p>
<p>The Strength Model states that the exertion of 
</p>
<p>self-control impairs self-control performance. 
</p>
<p>This claim would be falsified, if the exertion of 
</p>
<p>self-control was consistently found to boost 
</p>
<p>rather than to impair performance. Savani and 
</p>
<p>Job (2017) found such a reverse ego depletion 
</p>
<p>effect in several studies. Importantly, however, 
</p>
<p>participants in these samples came from India 
</p>
<p>growing up with the cultural belief that exerting 
</p>
<p>self-control is beneficial for future self-control 
</p>
<p>exertion. Adding &ldquo;cultural belief&rdquo; (or beliefs 
</p>
<p>about the [non-]limitedness of self-control more 
</p>
<p>generally) as a boundary condition incorporates 
</p>
<p>these results into the larger theory.
</p>
<p>Some other assumptions of the Strength Model, 
</p>
<p>however, seem difficult to falsify. On the behav-
</p>
<p>ioral level, the prediction that exerting self- control 
</p>
<p>impairs subsequent self-control performance is dif-
</p>
<p>ficult to falsify because due to the imprecision of 
</p>
<p>the self-control definition, it is unclear what consti-
</p>
<p>tutes a valid self-control manipulation and a valid 
</p>
<p>dependent variable. Failures to replicate an effect 
</p>
<p>can easily be dismissed by doubting the validity 
</p>
<p>or the strength of the independent or dependent 
</p>
<p>variables (see section on Operationalization and 
</p>
<p>Manipulation Checks below). On the process 
</p>
<p>level, the nature of the purported resource is 
</p>
<p>unspecified, as mentioned earlier. Its existence 
</p>
<p>can therefore not be falsified.
</p>
<p> Progress
</p>
<p>Good theories inspire new research, lead to 
</p>
<p>discoveries that make contributions beyond the 
</p>
<p>previously known, and promote theoretical 
</p>
<p>progress through refinements, sharpening, and 
</p>
<p>the inspiration and development of (new) 
</p>
<p>theories.
</p>
<p>The Strength Model has successfully spurred 
</p>
<p>progress. Hundreds of studies have been con-
</p>
<p>ducted and endorsed the existence of the ego 
</p>
<p>depletion effect (Hirt, Clarkson, &amp; Jia, 2016). 
</p>
<p>The model has been applied to many different 
</p>
<p>spheres of psychology including consumer 
</p>
<p>behavior (Friese, Hofmann, &amp; W&auml;nke, 2008; 
</p>
<p>Vohs &amp; Faber, 2007), neuroscience (Heatherton &amp; 
</p>
<p>Wagner, 2011; Luethi et&nbsp; al., 2016), decision- 
</p>
<p>making (Pocheptsova, Amir, Dhar, &amp; Baumeister, 
</p>
<p>2009), and work and organizations (Christian &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ellis, 2011), to name a few. The model also 
</p>
<p>inspired the development of new theories explain-
</p>
<p>ing the ego depletion effect differently (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Central Governor Model: Evans et&nbsp; al., 2015; 
</p>
<p>Process Model: Inzlicht et&nbsp; al., 2014) and more 
</p>
<p>general theories of self-control integrating ego 
</p>
<p>depletion as a central component (e.g., De Witt 
</p>
<p>Huberts et&nbsp;al., 2014; Kotabe &amp; Hofmann, 2015). 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, methodological discussions trig-
</p>
<p>gered by doubts about the robustness of the ego 
</p>
<p>depletion effect led to advances in domains such 
</p>
<p>as research on publication bias (Inzlicht, Gervais, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Berkman, 2015). In sum, the Strength Model 
</p>
<p>was extraordinarily successful in stimulating 
</p>
<p>both empirical work and theory across different 
</p>
<p>fields in psychology and beyond. (Obviously, in 
</p>
<p>and of itself this does not make a theory any more 
</p>
<p>or less true.)
</p>
<p> Interim Summary
</p>
<p>In the first part of this chapter, we introduced the 
</p>
<p>Strength Model of Self-Control with its two main 
</p>
<p>assumptions: domain generality and limited 
</p>
<p>resource. We discussed the sequential task para-
</p>
<p>digm and introduced two levels of analysis: the 
</p>
<p>behavioral level and the process level. We pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded with a selection of criteria to evaluate the 
</p>
<p>quality of theories and applied these to the 
</p>
<p>Strength Model. In the following section of the 
</p>
<p>chapter, we turn to the examination of the quality 
</p>
<p>of empirical research that has been conducted to 
</p>
<p>test a theory, again using the Strength Model as 
</p>
<p>an illustrative example.

</p>
<p> Empirical Perspective: Criteria 
to&nbsp;Evaluate Research on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Theory
</p>
<p>We now take a look at a selection of criteria that 
</p>
<p>help to judge the quality of empirical research 
</p>
<p>that has been conducted on a theory. Admittedly, 
</p>
<p>these criteria are inspired specifically by dis-
</p>
<p>cussions about the Strength Model. They are 
</p>
<p>therefore neither exhaustive nor representative 
</p>
<p>for evaluating empirical work in general. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, several of these criteria can readily 
</p>
<p>be applied to evaluating research on other theo-
</p>
<p>ries as well. For a more in-depth discussion of 
</p>
<p>empirical work on the ego depletion effect, see 
</p>
<p>Friese et&nbsp;al. (in press).
</p>
<p> Statistical Power
</p>
<p>We start with the famous Jacob Cohen (1988, 
</p>
<p>p.&nbsp;1): &ldquo;The power of a statistical test is the proba-
</p>
<p>bility that it will yield statistically significant 
</p>
<p>results [for an effect that truly exists].&rdquo; To reliably 
</p>
<p>detect an effect that truly exists, high statistical 
</p>
<p>power is vital. Importantly, statistical power 
</p>
<p>increases with larger effect sizes and with larger 
</p>
<p>sample sizes (given the significance level for a 
</p>
<p>type-I error is held constant). Thus, if statistical 
</p>
<p>power is low, a study is less likely to detect a true 
</p>
<p>effect. But&mdash;and maybe less intuitively&mdash;low 
</p>
<p>statistical power also decreases the likelihood 
</p>
<p>that a statistically significant finding reflects a true 
</p>
<p>effect (Button et&nbsp;al., 2013; Christley, 2010). This 
</p>
<p>so-called positive predictive value is lower for 
</p>
<p>smaller effect sizes and for smaller sample sizes.
</p>
<p>In the ego depletion literature, many studies 
</p>
<p>have small sample sizes (Carter et&nbsp; al., 2015). 
</p>
<p>Thus, in combination with a true effect which&mdash;
</p>
<p>by now&mdash;is assumed to be small in size, statisti-
</p>
<p>cal power across the ego depletion literature is 
</p>
<p>assumed to be worryingly low. When the average 
</p>
<p>power in a literature is low, many studies are 
</p>
<p>likely to produce nonsignificant findings even in 
</p>
<p>the presence of a true effect. However, the vast 
</p>
<p>majority of published ego depletion studies 
</p>
<p>reveal significant effects (Carter et&nbsp; al., 2015). 
</p>
<p>Together, these observations limit the possibility 
</p>
<p>to draw firm conclusions concerning the Strength 
</p>
<p>Model based on the currently available evidence 
</p>
<p>(see also later section on P-Hacking and 
</p>
<p>Publication Bias).
</p>
<p> Operationalization and&nbsp;Manipulation 
Check
</p>
<p>The process of defining an instrument to measure 
</p>
<p>a phenomenon that is not directly observable is 
</p>
<p>called operationalization&mdash;the resulting repre-
</p>
<p>sentations of the phenomenon are operational 
</p>
<p>definitions. For instance, to measure the abstract 
</p>
<p>concept of a person&rsquo;s intelligence (which is not 
</p>
<p>directly observable), psychologists have devel-
</p>
<p>oped many different intelligence tests that seek to 
</p>
<p>measure and quantify the underlying construct. 
</p>
<p>In principle, a phenomenon can have an unlim-
</p>
<p>ited number of operational definitions (Whitley, 
</p>
<p>2002). It is important to thoroughly develop these 
</p>
<p>operational definitions because researchers draw 
</p>
<p>inferences concerning the phenomena (i.e., hypo-
</p>
<p>thetical, latent constructs; e.g., intelligence) 
</p>
<p>based on the measurement of observable, mani-
</p>
<p>fest variables (e.g., scores in an intelligence test). 
</p>
<p>Only if this relationship between manifest vari-
</p>
<p>ables and the phenomenon is trusted&mdash;if the 
</p>
<p>operational definition fits the theory&mdash;can we 
</p>
<p>draw conclusions concerning the hypothetical 
</p>
<p>construct. Otherwise, if central constructs are not 
</p>
<p>well operationalized, it is difficult to estimate the 
</p>
<p>robustness of an effect.
</p>
<p>Box 1.2 Questions for Elaboration
</p>
<p>1. Think of a social psychological theory 
</p>
<p>you know, and try to evaluate it along 
</p>
<p>the criteria presented in this part of the 
</p>
<p>chapter. In what respects is the theory 
</p>
<p>you chose a good theory? Where is 
</p>
<p>room for improvement? Discuss.
</p>
<p>2. If you were to rank the discussed crite-
</p>
<p>ria, which of these would you see as the 
</p>
<p>more relevant indicators for a high- 
</p>
<p>quality theory? Are some of these crite-
</p>
<p>ria mutually exclusive?
</p>
<p>1 What Makes for&nbsp;a&nbsp;Good Theory? How to&nbsp;Evaluate a&nbsp;Theory Using the&nbsp;Strength Model of&nbsp;Self-Control&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12
</p>
<p>Research on the Strength Model used a large 
</p>
<p>variety of operational definitions concerning the 
</p>
<p>measurement and the manipulation of self- 
</p>
<p>control (see section on Generality above). The 
</p>
<p>Strength Model itself does not explicitly suggest 
</p>
<p>a certain set of operational definitions, partly due 
</p>
<p>to its generality (see Theoretical Perspective). 
</p>
<p>Hence, there is a large variety of ego depletion 
</p>
<p>manipulations in terms of time and content: from 
</p>
<p>very brief manipulations such as 20 incongruent 
</p>
<p>(depletion condition) versus 20 congruent (con-
</p>
<p>trol condition) Stroop trials (Yam, Chen, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Reynolds, 2014) to completing several demand-
</p>
<p>ing tasks in a row in the depletion condition, each 
</p>
<p>lasting several minutes (Sj&aring;stad &amp; Baumeister, 
</p>
<p>2018; Vohs, Baumeister, &amp; Schmeichel, 2012), 
</p>
<p>and from resisting cookies versus radishes to 
</p>
<p>crossing out certain letters in a text (Baumeister 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 1998). The same is true for the dependent 
</p>
<p>variables: A large variety of different tasks have 
</p>
<p>been used as dependent variable, ranging from 
</p>
<p>executive functioning tasks like the Stroop task 
</p>
<p>(Inzlicht &amp; Gutsell, 2007) to arithmetic calcula-
</p>
<p>tions (Vohs et&nbsp;al., 2008) via tasks involving resisting 
</p>
<p>temptations (Christiansen, Cole, &amp; Field, 2012; 
</p>
<p>Friese et&nbsp; al., 2008) to risk taking (Freeman &amp; 
</p>
<p>Muraven, 2010) and aggressive behavior (DeWall, 
</p>
<p>Baumeister, Stillman, &amp; Gailliot, 2007). Meta-
</p>
<p>analytic evidence suggests that these tasks share 
</p>
<p>a common core, albeit a rather small one 
</p>
<p>(Duckworth &amp; Kern, 2011). Thus, the question is, if 
</p>
<p>and to what extent these operational definitions 
</p>
<p>can reliably and validly manipulate and measure 
</p>
<p>the underlying construct that the Strength Model 
</p>
<p>posits: self-control.
</p>
<p>A related point concerns the use of manipula-
</p>
<p>tion checks. Manipulation checks are typically 
</p>
<p>used to test whether an independent variable suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully manipulated the construct of interest. 
</p>
<p>The majority of ego depletion studies did not 
</p>
<p>make use of manipulation checks. In a first meta- 
</p>
<p>analysis of 198 studies (Hagger et&nbsp;al., 2010), only 
</p>
<p>30% of those studies included a manipulation 
</p>
<p>check asking for perceived difficulty of the first 
</p>
<p>task. Out of these 30%, only about half (15.7% in 
</p>
<p>total) asked for subjective effort, and only a little 
</p>
<p>more than one in ten (12.6%) assessed fatigue 
</p>
<p>after the first task. This is important to keep in 
</p>
<p>mind: When researchers have little evidence 
</p>
<p>whether and to what extent participants exerted 
</p>
<p>self-control, the success of the manipulation may 
</p>
<p>be in doubt. This, in turn, has implications for the 
</p>
<p>falsifiability of the model: A failure to find an 
</p>
<p>effect could be due to problems from the theoreti-
</p>
<p>cal perspective (i.e., the model&rsquo;s assumptions may 
</p>
<p>not be correct) or from the empirical perspective 
</p>
<p>(i.e., the model is correct, but the unsuccessful 
</p>
<p>manipulation of the relevant constructs did not 
</p>
<p>allow for a proper test). In the latter case, it may 
</p>
<p>be premature to dismiss a theoretical model, even 
</p>
<p>in light of nonsignificant findings.
</p>
<p> p-Hacking and&nbsp;Publication Bias
</p>
<p>In recent years, several issues have been debated 
</p>
<p>that may contribute to less-than-desirable repli-
</p>
<p>cability and robustness of psychological science 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Munaf&ograve; et&nbsp;al., 2017). Two sources of bias in 
</p>
<p>particular have received widespread attention: 
</p>
<p>p-hacking and publication bias.
</p>
<p>p-hacking refers to researchers engaging in 
</p>
<p>questionable research practices to make originally 
</p>
<p>nonsignificant analyses statistically significant. 
</p>
<p>A nonsignificant p-value is &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; to signifi-
</p>
<p>cance (see Fig.&nbsp; 1.2). Consequently, findings 
</p>
<p>appear more robust than they actually are 
</p>
<p>(Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2011, 2018). 
</p>
<p>Common p-hacks include reporting only depen-
</p>
<p>dent variables that &ldquo;worked&rdquo; while omitting oth-
</p>
<p>ers, including or excluding outliers depending 
</p>
<p>on which analyses reveal the more desirable 
</p>
<p>outcome, peeking at the data during data collec-
</p>
<p>tion and stopping when the desired pattern of 
</p>
<p>results emerges without controlling for the 
</p>
<p>increased Type-I error rate (α error, probability 
</p>
<p>of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact 
</p>
<p>true), or including covariates without a pre-
</p>
<p>defined theoretical rationale. Some of these 
</p>
<p>p-hacks are especially &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; in changing 
</p>
<p>results in small samples.2
</p>
<p>The most tangible consequence of p-hacking is 
</p>
<p>an increase of significant findings that would not

</p>
<p>have been significant without p-hacking. An original 
</p>
<p>p-value may be nonsignificant while showing a 
</p>
<p>(nonsignificant) tendency in the expected direc-
</p>
<p>tion. After p-hacking, the effect size is artificially 
</p>
<p>inflated, and the finding is significant. These false-
</p>
<p>positive findings due to p-hacking suggest the 
</p>
<p>presence of a true effect that in fact may not exist 
</p>
<p>or may be smaller than suggested. One important 
</p>
<p>consequence of p-hacking is that it may lead to an 
</p>
<p>inflation of significant findings in a given literature 
</p>
<p>that may contribute to convictions about the exis-
</p>
<p>tence of a phenomenon that in fact may be much 
</p>
<p>less reliable than it appears. Another important 
</p>
<p>consequence of p-hacking is that it may lead to an 
</p>
<p>overestimation of the effect size for a given phe-
</p>
<p>nomenon that may in fact be much smaller than it 
</p>
<p>appears.
</p>
<p>The pervasiveness and severity of p-hacking 
</p>
<p>is unknown and estimates vary widely (Fiedler 
</p>
<p>&amp; Schwarz, 2016; Hartgerink, 2017; Head, 
</p>
<p>Holman, Lanfear, Kahn, &amp; Jennions, 2015; John, 
</p>
<p>Loewenstein, &amp; Prelec, 2012). It seems safe to say 
</p>
<p>that p-hacking has played a role in the ego deple-
</p>
<p>tion literature (Wolff, Baumann, &amp; Englert, 2018), 
</p>
<p>as it has in many other psychological literatures. 
</p>
<p>P-hacking will have contributed to the overestima-
</p>
<p>tion of meta-analytic effect size estimates in ego 
</p>
<p>depletion research, although it is unclear to what 
</p>
<p>extent this is the case (Friese et&nbsp;al., in press). In 
</p>
<p>addition, p-hacking likely has produced a number 
</p>
<p>of published findings that would not have been 
</p>
<p>significant without p- hacking (and therefore less 
</p>
<p>likely to be published).
</p>
<p>Publication Bias Publication bias refers to the 
</p>
<p>observation that studies with statistically signifi-
</p>
<p>cant results are more likely to be published than 
</p>
<p>nonsignificant studies (Bakker, van Dijk, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Wicherts, 2012). The most tangible consequence 
</p>
<p>of publication bias is the overestimation of meta- 
</p>
<p>analytic effect size estimates, because the number 
</p>
<p>of published studies (with often larger effect sizes; 
</p>
<p>see above) is not adequately corrected downward 
</p>
<p>by existing, but unavailable nonsignificant studies 
</p>
<p>with smaller effect sizes. Thus, publication bias 
</p>
<p>can lead to a distorted perception of the magnitude 
</p>
<p>and robustness of research literatures.
</p>
<p>Estimating the severity of publication bias is 
</p>
<p>difficult, but some analysts suggest that it is gen-
</p>
<p>erally high in the social sciences including psy-
</p>
<p>chology (Fanelli, 2010; Fanelli, Costas, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ioannidis, 2017) and also for ego depletion 
</p>
<p>research in particular (Carter et&nbsp;al., 2015; Carter 
</p>
<p>&amp; McCullough, 2014). This is troublesome, 
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.2 An illustrative example of p-hacking and its 
consequences. A nonsignificant effect with p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.112 (dot-
</p>
<p>ted line) is p-hacked (black arrow) below the common 
</p>
<p>0.05 significance threshold to p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.035 (continuous line). 
</p>
<p>As a consequence, the size of the effect increases. 
</p>
<p>However, the main objective in p-hacking is to obtain a 
</p>
<p>significant result, not to increase the effect size

</p>
<p>because common techniques to correct for the 
</p>
<p>influence of publication bias work poorly under 
</p>
<p>conditions typical for psychological science (e.g., 
</p>
<p>heterogeneity in effect sizes; Carter, Sch&ouml;nbrodt, 
</p>
<p>Gervais, &amp; Hilgard, 2017).
</p>
<p>Taken together, p-hacking (particularly) 
</p>
<p>increases the rates of false positives, while publi-
</p>
<p>cation bias (particularly) increases meta-analytic 
</p>
<p>effect size estimates. Based on the preponderance 
</p>
<p>of statistically significant findings despite low 
</p>
<p>power, it is plausible to assume that both p- 
</p>
<p>hacking and publication bias have contributed 
</p>
<p>markedly to ego depletion research. Together, 
</p>
<p>they convey the impression of a more robust and 
</p>
<p>replicable literature with larger effect sizes than 
</p>
<p>is warranted. How severe exactly their influence 
</p>
<p>is, is unfortunately impossible to determine. 
</p>
<p>Studies using open science practices such as pre-
</p>
<p>registration (Nosek, Ebersole, DeHaven, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Mellor, 2018; van &lsquo;t Veer &amp; Giner-Sorolla, 2016), 
</p>
<p>open materials, and open data are less prone to the 
</p>
<p>deleterious effects of p-hacking and publication 
</p>
<p>bias (Munaf&ograve; et&nbsp; al., 2017). It should therefore 
</p>
<p>become a habit for researchers to preregister their 
</p>
<p>predictions on an openly accessible online forum, 
</p>
<p>where they can also share their experimental 
</p>
<p>materials, original data, and analysis scripts. 
</p>
<p>Future work (not only on ego depletion) should 
</p>
<p>embrace open science practices.
</p>
<p> Moderation and&nbsp;Mediation
</p>
<p>Moderators can reveal important boundary con-
</p>
<p>ditions of effects proposed by a theory (see first 
</p>
<p>part of this chapter). They can elucidate the 
</p>
<p>breadth of a phenomenon, reveal new differentia-
</p>
<p>tions, and explore limits of a theory.
</p>
<p>More than 100 studies have investigated 
</p>
<p>moderators of the ego depletion effect (for an 
</p>
<p>overview, see Loschelder &amp; Friese, 2016). For 
</p>
<p>example, incentives to perform well in a second 
</p>
<p>self-control task can counteract ego depletion 
</p>
<p>effects (Luethi et&nbsp; al., 2016, see Fig.&nbsp; 1.3a; 
</p>
<p>Muraven &amp; Slessareva, 2003), and people who 
</p>
<p>believe that their willpower is non-limited may 
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.3 (a) Moderation: The relationship between inde-
pendent and dependent variable is influenced by a third 
</p>
<p>variable, the moderator. Luethi et&nbsp;al. (2016), for example, 
</p>
<p>found that the effect of the self-control manipulation on 
</p>
<p>the performance in a Stroop task depended on whether 
</p>
<p>participants could earn additional money depending on 
</p>
<p>their performance in the Stroop task or not. (b) Mediation: 
</p>
<p>The relationship between independent and dependent 
</p>
<p>variable&mdash;the underlying process&mdash;can (partly) be 
</p>
<p>explained by a third variable, the mediator. The Strength 
</p>
<p>Model, for instance, assumes that the diminution of the 
</p>
<p>self-control resource explains why after exerting self- 
</p>
<p>control in a first task, people&rsquo;s self-control performance is 
</p>
<p>impaired in a second self-control demanding task

</p>
<p>be less likely to show ego depletion effects (Job 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2010; Bernecker &amp; Job, Chap. 12). One 
</p>
<p>may suspect that moderator studies (that are often 
</p>
<p>investigated in 2&nbsp; &times;&nbsp; 2 experimental designs) are 
</p>
<p>more difficult to p-hack than two-condition stud-
</p>
<p>ies and may therefore provide more robust 
</p>
<p>results. However, this assumption is unlikely 
</p>
<p>given that only one experimental condition 
</p>
<p>would need to be p-hacked for a moderation 
</p>
<p>pattern (Friese et&nbsp;al., in press). In addition, mod-
</p>
<p>erator studies in the ego depletion literature pre-
</p>
<p>dominantly report significant findings, but had 
</p>
<p>low statistical power, suggesting the presence of 
</p>
<p>p-hacking and/or publication bias.
</p>
<p>Mediation studies are used to test assumptions 
</p>
<p>about the underlying process of a phenomenon 
</p>
<p>(see process level of analysis, De Houwer, 2011). 
</p>
<p>Mediators can therefore&mdash;in principle&mdash;distin-
</p>
<p>guish between different theoretical explanations 
</p>
<p>of the same observations. Mediators can be mea-
</p>
<p>sured or manipulated (e.g., Hayes, 2013; Spencer, 
</p>
<p>Zanna, &amp; Fong, 2005). When a proposed media-
</p>
<p>tor is measured, the data pattern necessary to 
</p>
<p>obtain significant mediation is more complex 
</p>
<p>than a mean difference between two conditions. 
</p>
<p>Mediator studies may thus&mdash;again, in principle&mdash;
</p>
<p>be less likely to produce false positives and 
</p>
<p>instead provide more robust evidence for a 
</p>
<p>phenomenon.
</p>
<p>While providing process evidence for the 
</p>
<p>Strength Model (i.e., diminished self-control 
</p>
<p>resource; Fig.&nbsp; 1.3b) is impossible because the 
</p>
<p>assumed resource is unspecified and thus nonas-
</p>
<p>sessable, some researchers examined other medi-
</p>
<p>ators not specified by the Strength Model (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Chow, Hui, &amp; Lau, 2015; Graham, Martin Ginis, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Bray, 2017; Inzlicht &amp; Gutsell, 2007). 
</p>
<p>Considering the size of the ego depletion litera-
</p>
<p>ture, mediator studies are rare. They commonly 
</p>
<p>have low statistical power, too. Importantly, since 
</p>
<p>hardly any studies on ego depletion were prereg-
</p>
<p>istered, it is impossible to know how many medi-
</p>
<p>ator studies were conducted but not reported at 
</p>
<p>all or in a different manner because the mediation 
</p>
<p>results did not turn out as expected. The existing 
</p>
<p>evidence in the ego depletion literature is there-
</p>
<p>fore limited. More generally, we believe that 
</p>
<p>preregistered and theoretically grounded mediator 
</p>
<p>studies are capable of providing stronger evidence 
</p>
<p>for a theory as they examine an assumed mecha-
</p>
<p>nism on the process level in addition to the 
</p>
<p>behavioral effect.
</p>
<p> Meta-Analyses
</p>
<p>Meta-analyses are a powerful tool to combine the 
</p>
<p>results of multiple relevant studies in a research 
</p>
<p>field (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &amp; Rothstein, 
</p>
<p>2011). They shift the focus from individual stud-
</p>
<p>ies to the broader picture. Some strengths of meta-
</p>
<p>analyses are the higher statistical power to show 
</p>
<p>even small effect sizes and the ability to examine 
</p>
<p>moderators across studies that are unfeasible to 
</p>
<p>investigate in individual studies. Despite their 
</p>
<p>many benefits, meta-analyses have drawbacks. An 
</p>
<p>important one is that the quality of a meta-analy-
</p>
<p>sis crucially depends on the quality of the primary 
</p>
<p>studies (Egger, Smith, &amp; Sterne, 2001; Ioannidis &amp; 
</p>
<p>Lau, 1998). If a field features many poorly con-
</p>
<p>ducted studies, a meta-analysis will unlikely level 
</p>
<p>out the biases of primary studies (e.g., p-hacking; 
</p>
<p>see also Munaf&ograve; et&nbsp;al., 2017)&mdash;particularly, if these 
</p>
<p>biases are systematic rather than unsystematic 
</p>
<p>(Borenstein et&nbsp; al., 2011). As mentioned earlier, 
</p>
<p>publication bias can also distort meta-analytic 
</p>
<p>effect size estimates. The possibilities to reliably 
</p>
<p>correct for publication bias are limited (Carter 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2017). Nevertheless, meta-analyses currently 
</p>
<p>are the most potent way to quantitatively summa-
</p>
<p>rize large sets of studies (Gurevitch, Koricheva, 
</p>
<p>Nakagawa, &amp; Stewart, 2018).
</p>
<p>For the ego depletion literature, a first meta- 
</p>
<p>analysis of published studies indicated a healthy 
</p>
<p>mean effect size of d&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.62 (Hagger et&nbsp;al., 2010). 
</p>
<p>However, a reanalysis of the same dataset found 
</p>
<p>evidence for publication bias (Carter &amp; 
</p>
<p>McCullough, 2014). A second meta-analysis 
</p>
<p>found an uncorrected smaller, but still substantial 
</p>
<p>effect of g&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.43 (Carter et&nbsp; al., 2015). After 
</p>
<p>applying different techniques to correct for the 
</p>
<p>influence of publication bias (that all have some 
</p>
<p>shortcomings), Carter and colleagues concluded 
</p>
<p>that there is &ldquo;very little evidence that the ego 
</p>
<p>depletion effect is a real phenomenon&rdquo; (Carter 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2015, p.&nbsp;796).

<p>16
</p>
<p>Some researchers saw this meta-analysis by 
</p>
<p>Carter et&nbsp;al. (2015) as the first nail in the coffin of 
</p>
<p>ego depletion research. Others pointed out vari-
</p>
<p>ous problems of the meta-analysis, the bias cor-
</p>
<p>rection methods, and questioned its conclusions 
</p>
<p>(Cunningham &amp; Baumeister, 2016; Inzlicht et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2015). In the meantime, further meta-analyses 
</p>
<p>appeared with varying results that are difficult to 
</p>
<p>interpret due to methodological issues (Bl&aacute;zquez, 
</p>
<p>Botella, &amp; Suero, 2017; Dang, Liu, Liu, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Mao, 2017; see Friese et&nbsp;al., in press). Overall, 
</p>
<p>the inconvenient truth is that ego depletion 
</p>
<p>meta- analyses served as a great tool to promote 
</p>
<p>discussion and progress, but they did not pro-
</p>
<p>vide unequivocal evidence for (or against) the 
</p>
<p>ego depletion effect.
</p>
<p> Registered Replication Reports
</p>
<p>Registered Replication Reports (RRR) are 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;multi-lab, high-quality replications of important 
</p>
<p>experiments in psychological science along with 
</p>
<p>comments by the authors of the original studies&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Association for Psychological Science, 2018). A 
</p>
<p>detailed description of the study, the hypotheses, 
</p>
<p>and the analysis plan is implemented by several 
</p>
<p>laboratories, and the results are published inde-
</p>
<p>pendent of the results. An RRR has thus great 
</p>
<p>statistical power to test a central prediction of a 
</p>
<p>theory. A limitation of RRRs is that they are (usu-
</p>
<p>ally) restricted to replicating one specific, often 
</p>
<p>prototypical operationalization in a research field 
</p>
<p>(a selected &ldquo;landmark study&rdquo;). The ability of 
</p>
<p>RRRs to speak to the validity of whole theories is 
</p>
<p>therefore necessarily limited.
</p>
<p>An ego depletion RRR (Hagger et&nbsp;al., 2016) 
</p>
<p>sought to replicate one selected combination of 
</p>
<p>manipulation and dependent variable (Sripada, 
</p>
<p>Kessler, &amp; Jonides, 2014). As we have seen in 
</p>
<p>the first part of the chapter, a salient characteris-
</p>
<p>tic of the Strength Model is its domain general-
</p>
<p>ity assumption. Thus, the ability of this (or any 
</p>
<p>other) specific IV-DV combination alone to dis-
</p>
<p>prove the general ego depletion idea is limited. 
</p>
<p>That being said, the RRR delivered a null effect 
</p>
<p>on average. Although there was discussion 
</p>
<p>about some methodological issues of the RRR 
</p>
<p>(Arber et&nbsp; al., 2017; Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2016), 
</p>
<p>this finding posed another serious threat to ego 
</p>
<p>depletion research.
</p>
<p> Discussion
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we discussed criteria to evaluate 
</p>
<p>the quality of theories and the empirical research 
</p>
<p>examining these theories. Instead of reiterating 
</p>
<p>our conclusions, we wish to briefly reflect about 
</p>
<p>(1) the choice to abandon theories, (2) the two 
</p>
<p>levels of analysis in general, and (3) the Strength 
</p>
<p>Model in particular.
</p>
<p>A psychological theory is of inferential 
</p>
<p>nature&mdash;it makes probabilistic, imperfect predic-
</p>
<p>tions of the future&mdash;and, as such, can never be 
</p>
<p>proven to be true. The process of developing a 
</p>
<p>psychological theory is hence never completed. 
</p>
<p>It is an ongoing journey of testing, refinement, 
</p>
<p>development, falsification, and sometimes rejec-
</p>
<p>tion. As we tried to show in this chapter, it is 
</p>
<p>important to distinguish between the theoretical 
</p>
<p>perspective and the empirical perspective when 
</p>
<p>working with theories. Failures to replicate an 
</p>
<p>effect (or find it in the first place) can be due to 
</p>
<p>different causes: the theory could be wrong and 
</p>
<p>the original result was a false positive. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>however, the theory could have merit, but the 
</p>
<p>empirical research was not good enough to ade-
</p>
<p>quately test it. In this case, one should take a 
</p>
<p>close look at the complete process of putting the 
</p>
<p>theoretical prediction to a practical test. Did the 
</p>
<p>theory make plausible assumptions? Were opera-
</p>
<p>tionalizations adequate? Such discussion may 
</p>
<p>lead to important insights and sensible further 
</p>
<p>steps for a research field. It may be more promis-
</p>
<p>ing than a (possibly) premature decision to aban-
</p>
<p>don a theory altogether. From the theoretical 
</p>
<p>perspective, theories may be true after all, even if 
</p>
<p>some empirical tests did not deliver the expected 
</p>
<p>results.
</p>
<p>When discussing both the criteria to evaluate 
</p>
<p>the quality of theories and its accompanying 
</p>
<p>empirical research, the Strength Model fared bet-
</p>
<p>ter on some criteria than on others. Here, we wish 
</p>
<p>K. Gieseler et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17
</p>
<p>to stress that we chose the Strength Model as an 
</p>
<p>illustrative example&mdash;not because we sought to 
</p>
<p>promote or undermine this model&mdash;but because 
</p>
<p>it has received considerable attention in the last 
</p>
<p>decades (and we happen to have gained some 
</p>
<p>knowledge on it). In addition, many of the doubts 
</p>
<p>and criticisms that we discussed with respect to 
</p>
<p>the Strength Model are not unique to this model; 
</p>
<p>they generalize to several other literatures in 
</p>
<p>social psychology and beyond. The discussion 
</p>
<p>about the scientific implications of these observa-
</p>
<p>tions for (social) psychology more generally goes 
</p>
<p>past the scope of this chapter.

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Theories can be discussed from differ-
</p>
<p>ent perspectives: the theoretical per-
</p>
<p>spective (Does a theory meet general 
</p>
<p>requirements for a good theory?) and 
</p>
<p>the empirical perspective (How empiri-
</p>
<p>cally proven is a theory?).
</p>
<p>&bull; A good theory in the theoretical sense is 
</p>
<p>(1) consistent with empirical observa-
</p>
<p>tions; is (2) precise, (3) parsimonious, 
</p>
<p>(4) explanatorily broad, and (5) falsifi-
</p>
<p>able; and (6) promotes scientific prog-
</p>
<p>ress (among others; Table&nbsp;1.1).
</p>
<p>&bull; To convincingly support a theory&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>assumptions, empirical research has to 
</p>
<p>be high in statistical power, well opera-
</p>
<p>tionalized, and (largely) free of p-hack-
</p>
<p>ing and publication bias. Meta-analyses 
</p>
<p>and Registered Replication Reports are 
</p>
<p>useful tools to estimate effect sizes, 
</p>
<p>examine moderators, and test central 
</p>
<p>predictions with high statistical power.
</p>
<p>&bull; The Strength Model of Self-Control 
</p>
<p>explains self-control failure after the 
</p>
<p>initial exertion of self-control with a 
</p>
<p>domain-general, limited resource. 
</p>
<p>Concerning the criteria for a good theory 
</p>
<p>and well-conducted empirical research, 
</p>
<p>the Strength Model has both favorable 
</p>
<p>and less favorable properties.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>When the then Roman general Julius Caesar 
</p>
<p>made the decision to cross the Rubicon with his 
</p>
<p>army, he knew that this marked a point of no 
</p>
<p>return. He supposedly uttered that &ldquo;the die has 
</p>
<p>been cast&rdquo; as he could foresee the dramatic con-
</p>
<p>sequences&nbsp;&ndash; treason and the beginning of a civil 
</p>
<p>war. However, when Heckhausen and Gollwitzer 
</p>
<p>(1987) described the transition from a motiva-
</p>
<p>tional (why does an individual do X?) to a voli-
</p>
<p>tional state (how does an individual do X?) in 
</p>
<p>goal pursuit, they chose to refer to it as crossing 
</p>
<p>the Rubicon nonetheless. Why did they choose 
</p>
<p>these drastic words and how does making a deci-
</p>
<p>sion compare to the metaphorical point of no 
</p>
<p>return?
</p>
<p>In the research leading up to the formulation 
</p>
<p>and the various extensions of Mindset theory of 
</p>
<p>Action Phases (MAP; Gollwitzer, 1990, 2012; 
</p>
<p>Gollwitzer &amp; Keller, 2016; cf. Bernecker &amp; Job, 
</p>
<p>Chap. 12), researchers observed differences in 
</p>
<p>thought content and focus before and after a deci-
</p>
<p>sion. More specifically, one group of individuals 
</p>
<p>deliberated about which of their many desires to 
</p>
<p>turn into a binding goal or the pros and cons of 
</p>
<p>one particular decision (e.g., whether or not they 
</p>
<p>should choose psychology as their major). 
</p>
<p>Another group of individuals already made the 
</p>
<p>decision in favor of one goal and now planned the 
</p>
<p>necessary steps to go forward (e.g., choosing the

<p>important and necessary courses, ordering expen-
</p>
<p>sive textbooks online). Whether the decision in 
</p>
<p>favor of one goal had been made subsequently 
</p>
<p>determined whether individuals partook in a rela-
</p>
<p>tively open-minded deliberation of pros and cons 
</p>
<p>of the goal in question or a relatively closed-
</p>
<p>minded listing of pros in favor of the chosen goal 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Nenkov &amp; Gollwitzer, 2012; Taylor &amp; 
</p>
<p>Gollwitzer, 1995).
</p>
<p>From its early days, MAP has been a theory of 
</p>
<p>successful goal pursuit. It marks important transi-
</p>
<p>tions, predicts cognitive shifts of goal- striving 
</p>
<p>individuals, and explains when individuals com-
</p>
<p>mit to a goal. However, not all chosen goals are 
</p>
<p>attained. In a meta-analysis of meta-analyses 
</p>
<p>assessing this truism, Sheeran (2002) found a 
</p>
<p>positive correlation between intentions and 
</p>
<p>behavior that accounts for 28% of variance in 
</p>
<p>future behavior. However, the remaining unex-
</p>
<p>plained variance, the so-called intention-behavior 
</p>
<p>gap, remains large. A self- regulation strategy to 
</p>
<p>bridge this gap is the use of implementation 
</p>
<p>intentions (Gollwitzer, 1993, 1999, 2014). 
</p>
<p>Implementation intentions are specific if-then 
</p>
<p>plans that specify a critical situation (e.g., a suit-
</p>
<p>able opportunity to act in accordance with a goal) 
</p>
<p>and link it to a goal- directed response. Such plans 
</p>
<p>have been shown to increase goal attainment 
</p>
<p>rates (Gollwitzer &amp; Sheeran, 2006) even among 
</p>
<p>individuals that usually suffer from impaired 
</p>
<p>self-regulation (e.g., children with ADHD; 
</p>
<p>Gawrilow &amp; Gollwitzer, 2008).
</p>
<p>The present chapter will span both MAP and 
</p>
<p>the self-regulation strategy of using implementa-
</p>
<p>tion intentions. We will first outline the four 
</p>
<p>action phases according to MAP, focus on two of 
</p>
<p>the most-researched action phases with their 
</p>
<p>accompanying mindsets, highlight some recent 
</p>
<p>applications, and will then move on to implemen-
</p>
<p>tation intentions. We will describe research on 
</p>
<p>why they promote the rate of goal attainment, 
</p>
<p>which features they have, and to which action 
</p>
<p>control problems they were applied to more 
</p>
<p>recently. We will close by summarizing an exem-
</p>
<p>plary field study, demonstrating how the concept 
</p>
<p>of implementation intentions opens up new 
</p>
<p>research questions and perspectives.
</p>
<p> MAP
</p>
<p>In the course of goal pursuit, people face various 
</p>
<p>challenges but have limited capacities. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, they have to decide which of their 
</p>
<p>desires are worthy to pursue and allocate 
</p>
<p>resources like time or physical and mental effort 
</p>
<p>to the chosen goal. People then have to initiate 
</p>
<p>and maintain goal striving without becoming dis-
</p>
<p>tracted by temptations or frustrated by obstacles 
</p>
<p>and, finally yet importantly, evaluate whether 
</p>
<p>they have reached their goal or whether further 
</p>
<p>action is necessary. MAP proposes that each of 
</p>
<p>these challenges arises in a specific phase in goal 
</p>
<p>pursuit (see Fig.&nbsp; 2.1), and overcoming them is 
</p>
<p>facilitated by the activation of a set of phase-typ-
</p>
<p>ical cognitive procedures (i.e., the mindset). 
</p>
<p>Whereas goal setting and evaluation are located 
</p>
<p>in the motivational phases of the model, planning 
</p>
<p>and action initiation are located in the volitional 
</p>
<p>phases.
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Going back to Ach (1935) and Lewin 
</p>
<p>(1926), we propose the following 
</p>
<p>distinction:
</p>
<p>Motivation: The process of goal setting and 
</p>
<p>evaluation. The focus lies on the desirability 
</p>
<p>and feasibility of potential goals, influenced 
</p>
<p>by the needs and motives of the goal-striv-
</p>
<p>ing individual. Research on motivation 
</p>
<p>answers the question of why people act, in 
</p>
<p>which direction and with which intensity.
</p>
<p>Volition: The will-based process of goal 
</p>
<p>striving. The focus lies on the actual goal- 
</p>
<p>directed behavior but also on planning 
</p>
<p>steps that are necessary to be able to show 
</p>
<p>goal-directed responses in the first place. 
</p>
<p>Research on volition answers the question 
</p>
<p>of how people act to reach their goals, 
</p>
<p>given the opportunities and the obstacles 
</p>
<p>they are facing.

</p>
<p>In the predecisional phase, people have to 
</p>
<p>deliberate whether it is worthwhile to pursue a 
</p>
<p>given goal. They weigh the desirability (i.e., how 
</p>
<p>valuable it is to succeed) and the feasibility 
</p>
<p>(i.e., how likely it is to succeed) of the competing 
</p>
<p>options. Ultimately, individuals should choose a 
</p>
<p>goal with high desirability and feasibility. To 
</p>
<p>arrive at such choices, people have to remain 
</p>
<p>open-minded, have to be realistic about their 
</p>
<p>chance of success, and have to judge the potential 
</p>
<p>goals in relation to each other.
</p>
<p>When individuals make a decision, however, 
</p>
<p>they cross the metaphorical Rubicon and cogni-
</p>
<p>tive styles change during the transition to the pre-
</p>
<p>actional phase. People now face the challenge to 
</p>
<p>plan the implementation of their goal and exhibit 
</p>
<p>an increased focus on feasibility- related informa-
</p>
<p>tion (Kille, 2015). For challenging goals, it is 
</p>
<p>now best to lay out and plan against what obsta-
</p>
<p>cles have to be overcome or may arise during 
</p>
<p>goal pursuit, energized by positively biased judg-
</p>
<p>ments of control (Gollwitzer &amp; Kinney, 1989) 
</p>
<p>and expectations of goal fulfillment (Puca, 2001; 
</p>
<p>see also mental contrasting; Oettingen, 2012). 
</p>
<p>For easy goals, this phase may be comparatively 
</p>
<p>short, as extensive planning would constitute a 
</p>
<p>waste of time and other resources (Gollwitzer &amp; 
</p>
<p>Brandst&auml;tter, 1997).
</p>
<p>Once plans have been laid out and suitable 
</p>
<p>opportunities to act arise, individuals eventually 
</p>
<p>enter the actional phase where the actual goal- 
</p>
<p>directed behavior takes place. A focus on means 
</p>
<p>and persistence as well as shielding one&rsquo;s goal 
</p>
<p>from temptations or other, potentially conflicting, 
</p>
<p>goals (e.g., a dieting goal may conflict with a goal 
</p>
<p>to befriend another person if this person invites 
</p>
<p>you over to a BBQ; Shah, Friedman, &amp; Kruglanski, 
</p>
<p>2002) helps people to stay on track. If everything 
</p>
<p>goes according to plan, the goal- directed action 
</p>
<p>will bring the goal-striving individual closer to 
</p>
<p>goal attainment. However, researchers have laid 
</p>
<p>bare situations in which this is not the case. A lack 
</p>
<p>of focus or early setbacks can, for instance, lead to 
</p>
<p>the emergence of an action crisis (Brandst&auml;tter, 
</p>
<p>Herrmann, &amp; Sch&uuml;ler, 2013; see also recom-
</p>
<p>mended reading), a motivational phenomenon in 
</p>
<p>the volitional phase: once the going gets tough, 
</p>
<p>individuals may experience their struggle as futile 
</p>
<p>and will, over time, disengage from further goal-
</p>
<p>directed action. They reflect on the desirability of 
</p>
<p>the set goal or its feasibility anew (Ghassemi, 
</p>
<p>Bernecker, Herrmann, &amp; Brandst&auml;tter, 2017). 
</p>
<p>For instance, Brandst&auml;tter and Sch&uuml;ler (2013) 
</p>
<p>observed that an action crisis leads to less focus 
</p>
<p>on implementation- related information but a 
</p>
<p>greater concern regarding the costs of continuing 
</p>
<p>versus disengaging, as well as the benefits of 
</p>
<p>disengaging.
</p>
<p>Lastly, when the goal-directed behavior ends, 
</p>
<p>individuals have to evaluate whether their desired 
</p>
<p>end state has been reached (i.e., whether the goal 
</p>
<p>has been attained). Further action may be neces-
</p>
<p>sary, or goal striving was futile and further action 
</p>
<p>would simply be a waste of resources. In this 
</p>
<p>postactional phase, a switch back to a focus on 
</p>
<p>relatively open-minded desirability or value eval-
</p>
<p>uations is expected to occur (Kille, 2015). For 
</p>
<p>instance, a longitudinal study on exercising

</p>
<p>behavior (Kwan, Bryan, &amp; Sheeran, 2018) 
</p>
<p>demonstrated the importance of postactional 
</p>
<p>evaluations (e.g., &ldquo;did I exercise as planned?,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;how did exercising feel,&rdquo; &ldquo;how do I feel about 
</p>
<p>myself after exercising&rdquo;) predicting subsequent 
</p>
<p>intentions and behavior: positive postactional 
</p>
<p>evaluations were associated with setting higher 
</p>
<p>exercise goals for the following week, which in 
</p>
<p>turn was related to actual levels of participants&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>subsequent exercise behavior.
</p>
<p> Mindsets
</p>
<p>In each of the action phases, a set of certain cogni-
</p>
<p>tive procedures is activated. These so-called mind-
</p>
<p>sets help to overcome the challenges at hand. 
</p>
<p>However, in contrast to a mere task set, which is 
</p>
<p>the intentional attuning in order to master a given 
</p>
<p>task (Gollwitzer, 1990, 1991), these mindsets also 
</p>
<p>evince a moment of inertia as they have been 
</p>
<p>shown to carry over to subsequent tasks unrelated 
</p>
<p>to the goal that originally evoked them. In this con-
</p>
<p>ceptualization, phenomena related to specific 
</p>
<p>action phases can be studied by investigating the 
</p>
<p>effects of their accompanying mindsets on other, 
</p>
<p>unrelated tasks that offer insights in the cognitive 
</p>
<p>functioning of individuals.
</p>
<p>Successfully weighing the desirability and 
</p>
<p>feasibility of different goal options necessitates 
</p>
<p>open-minded and impartial information process-
</p>
<p>ing. Accordingly, participants in a deliberative 
</p>
<p>mindset have been shown to evince a broader 
</p>
<p>span of visual attention (B&uuml;ttner et&nbsp;al., 2014), are 
</p>
<p>more likely to process incidentally presented 
</p>
<p>information (Fujita, Gollwitzer, &amp; Oettingen, 
</p>
<p>2007), and tend to give pros and cons equal 
</p>
<p>weight (Bayer &amp; Gollwitzer, 2005). Moreover, 
</p>
<p>persuasive messages that stress abstract, future 
</p>
<p>outcomes seem to be more effective in this mind-
</p>
<p>set (Nenkov, 2012). Participants in a deliberative 
</p>
<p>mindset are furthermore less affected by the 
</p>
<p>optimistic bias, that is, the tendency to see oneself 
</p>
<p>as being less exposed to future negative life events 
</p>
<p>than the average other (Keller &amp; Gollwitzer, 2017; 
</p>
<p>Taylor &amp; Gollwitzer, 1995) but seem more tuned 
</p>
<p>to assessing expected utilities in decision-making 
</p>
<p>(Rahn, Jaudas, &amp; Achtziger, 2016a).
</p>
<p>In contrast, planning the implementation of a 
</p>
<p>set goal would suffer from an ongoing reevalua-
</p>
<p>tion of the desirability and the feasibility of the 
</p>
<p>steps the individuals commit themselves to take. 
</p>
<p>Participants in an implemental mindset thus 
</p>
<p>evince optimistically biased judgments of their 
</p>
<p>chance of success (Puca, 2001), exhibit stronger 
</p>
<p>illusions of control (Gollwitzer &amp; Kinney, 1989), 
</p>
<p>and are more focused on details (i.e., evince a 
</p>
<p>narrower span of visual attention; B&uuml;ttner et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2014). Therefore, they are more persistent in the 
</p>
<p>face of difficulty (Brandst&auml;tter &amp; Frank, 2002) 
</p>
<p>and complete a task sooner while simultaneously

</p>
<p> Applications and&nbsp;Developments
</p>
<p>The inertia of mindsets can also be used to alter 
</p>
<p>individuals&rsquo; reactions to domains entirely unre-
</p>
<p>lated to the decision problems that originally 
</p>
<p>evoked them. In recent research, psychologists 
</p>
<p>have used mindsets successfully to shield partici-
</p>
<p>pants with low socioeconomic backgrounds from 
</p>
<p>performance decreases due to stereotype threat 
</p>
<p>(Dennehy, Ben-Zeev, &amp; Tanigawa, 2014), to 
</p>
<p>alleviate overconfident judgments among male 
</p>
<p>participants (H&uuml;gelsch&auml;fer &amp; Achtziger, 2014), or 
</p>
<p>to alter risk-taking behavior (Keller &amp; Gollwitzer, 
</p>
<p>2017; Rahn, Jaudas, &amp; Achtziger, 2016b).
</p>
<p>Even outside of psychology, mindset theory 
</p>
<p>has been used to explain various phenomena. For 
</p>
<p>instance, in their survey of 232 IT employees of 
</p>
<p>Fortune 500 companies, Korzaan and Harris 
</p>
<p>(2017) find that the presence of an implemental 
</p>
<p>mindset coincided with overly optimistic judg-
</p>
<p>ments about the success of the implementation of 
</p>
<p>an information systems project. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>Delano&euml;-Gueguen and Fayolle (2018) applied 
</p>
<p>MAP to entrepreneurial decision-making, more 
</p>
<p>specifically to the early stages of start-up creation. 
</p>
<p>They suggest that individuals in an early

</p>
<p> motivational stage, before crossing the Rubicon, 
</p>
<p>have different support needs than participants in a 
</p>
<p>later volitional stage. Similarly, Jansen (2014) 
</p>
<p>hypothesizes that shifting from a deliberative to an 
</p>
<p>implemental mindset may contribute to a problem 
</p>
<p>faced by medical researchers, which they term the 
</p>
<p>therapeutic error: the discrepancy between unreal-
</p>
<p>istically high expectations of treatment success 
</p>
<p>and actual treatment success. Many factors are at 
</p>
<p>work to produce these high expectations, be it 
</p>
<p>misconceptions about medical research or a per-
</p>
<p>vasive general optimistic bias. However, Jansen 
</p>
<p>argues that in addition, participants of medical 
</p>
<p>research who exhibit a therapeutic error are asked 
</p>
<p>to make their judgments after they already con-
</p>
<p>sented to taking part in research (i.e., after the 
</p>
<p>decision had been made). She thus concludes that 
</p>
<p>heightened expectations may be caused by the 
</p>
<p>predominant mindset and that it is important to 
</p>
<p>include risk and benefit assessments of eligible 
</p>
<p>persons in the predecisional phase as well to be 
</p>
<p>able to assess misconceptions correctly.
</p>
<p>Finally yet importantly, MAP has also been 
</p>
<p>adapted by political scientists to describe and 
</p>
<p>understand the path to armed conflicts (Johnson 
</p>
<p>&amp; Tierney, 2001). The authors observed that 
</p>
<p>public confidence in winning typically increases 
</p>
<p>right at the dawn of war although there is no new 
</p>
<p>information available that would warrant such an 
</p>
<p>increase. They account for this optimism by 
</p>
<p>pointing to a switch in the mindsets of the 
</p>
<p>political actors as well as the public; once the 
</p>
<p>decision in favor of armed conflict has been 
</p>
<p>made, the feasibility of this option is perceived to 
</p>
<p>be higher than it (potentially) is.
</p>
<p> Implementation Intentions
</p>
<p>According to MAP, setting desirable and feasible 
</p>
<p>goals is an important prerequisite for all of our 
</p>
<p>actions. This assumption is hardly controversial 
</p>
<p>and widely shared, as the yearly ritual of spelling 
</p>
<p>out New Year&rsquo;s resolutions aptly demonstrates. 
</p>
<p>Goals typically take the form of specifying wanted 
</p>
<p>outcomes (e.g., &ldquo;I want to stay fit!&rdquo;) or behaviors 
</p>
<p>(e.g., &ldquo;I want to do regular workouts!&rdquo;), and 
</p>
<p>plenty of research attests to their important role for 
</p>
<p>getting what one desires. Unfortunately, it is often 
</p>
<p>not possible to immediately act upon and attain a 
</p>
<p>goal&nbsp;&ndash; one might have to wait for good opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties to act, deal with obstacles along the way, or act 
</p>
<p>repeatedly over extended periods of time. The 
</p>
<p>Rubicon model therefore comprises a planning 
</p>
<p>phase in which people think about when, where, 
</p>
<p>and how to perform goal-directed responses. As it 
</p>
<p>turns out, however, planning does not come as 
</p>
<p>naturally to people as setting goals, which might 
</p>
<p>contribute to the notorious intention-behavior gap 
</p>
<p>that frequently foils even the firmest resolutions. 
</p>
<p>Attesting to this interpretation, research demon-
</p>
<p>strates that goal attainment is substantially 
</p>
<p>improved when people are explicitly instructed to 
</p>
<p>furnish their goals with plans (Gollwitzer &amp; 
</p>
<p>Sheeran, 2006). This observation lies at the core 
</p>
<p>of implementation intention theory (Gollwitzer, 
</p>
<p>1993, 1999, 2014), which revolves around 
</p>
<p>planning as a self- regulation strategy for goal 
</p>
<p>attainment.

</p>
<p>Implementation intentions are if-then plans in 
</p>
<p>which people link a critical situation to a goal- 
</p>
<p>directed response: &ldquo;If I encounter critical situation 
</p>
<p>S, then I will perform goal-directed response R!&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>The situation in the if-part represents an opportu-
</p>
<p>nity to act or an obstacle to goal attainment, while 
</p>
<p>the response in the then-part represents a (mode of) 
</p>
<p>thought, feeling, or behavior that can be instigated 
</p>
<p>to promote goal attainment. For instance, an imple-
</p>
<p>mentation intention could facilitate the goal to stay 
</p>
<p>fit by specifying when, where, and how to go for 
</p>
<p>regular runs: &ldquo;When I come home from the office 
</p>
<p>on Fridays, then I will put on my running shoes and 
</p>
<p>go for a run in the park!&rdquo; Forming implementation 
</p>
<p>intentions is a simple and yet highly effective self-
</p>
<p>regulation strategy. A meta- analysis involving 8461 
</p>
<p>participants in 94 independent studies (Gollwitzer 
</p>
<p>&amp; Sheeran, 2006) revealed a medium-to-large 
</p>
<p>effect size of implementation intentions on the rate 
</p>
<p>of goal attainment (d&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.65) beyond the effect of 
</p>
<p>holding a goal intention (d&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.36; Webb &amp; 
</p>
<p>Sheeran, 2006). This suggests that forming imple-
</p>
<p>mentation intentions helps people better attain their 
</p>
<p>goals&nbsp;&ndash; but how can these effects be explained?
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Goal intentions: Goal intentions specify a 
</p>
<p>desired outcome or behavior (i.e., &ldquo;I want 
</p>
<p>to reach outcome O!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to per-
</p>
<p>form behavior B!&rdquo;). Their most important 
</p>
<p>features are their desirability (how impor-
</p>
<p>tant it is to attain them) and their feasibility 
</p>
<p>(how likely it is to attain them), which 
</p>
<p>jointly determine the degree of goal 
</p>
<p>commitment.
</p>
<p>Implementation intentions: Imple-
</p>
<p>mentation intentions are if-then plans spec-
</p>
<p>ifying when, where, and how to act toward 
</p>
<p>a goal (i.e., &ldquo;If I encounter situation S, then 
</p>
<p>I will perform goal- directed response R!&rdquo;). 
</p>
<p>They are subordinate to goal intentions and 
</p>
<p>are assumed to facilitate their attainment 
</p>
<p>by automating two processes: (1) the detec-
</p>
<p>tion of critical situations and (2) the initia-
</p>
<p>tion of goal-directed responses.
</p>
<p>Box 2.3 Zooming In: How to Form 
</p>
<p>Implementation Intentions
</p>
<p>In the literature, several ways of forming 
</p>
<p>implementation intentions can be distin-
</p>
<p>guished. Research on the basic cognitive 
</p>
<p>processes of goal striving usually provides 
</p>
<p>ready-made plans tailored to the research 
</p>
<p>hypothesis. For instance, an if-then plan 
</p>
<p>like &ldquo;If I see an apple, then I will immedi-
</p>
<p>ately press the left mouse button!&rdquo; could be 
</p>
<p>used to test whether implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tions speed up behavior in a computerized 
</p>
<p>categorization task. In more applied re-
</p>
<p>search settings, implementation intentions 
</p>
<p>are often conveyed as a meta-cognitive 
</p>
<p>strategy in which participants specify their 
</p>
<p>own critical situations and goal-directed re-
</p>
<p>sponses. This could involve the following 
</p>
<p>four steps:
</p>
<p>1. Commit yourself to a goal intention.
</p>
<p>2. Specify a critical situation for attaining 
</p>
<p>the goal.
</p>
<p>3. Specify a goal-directed response that 
</p>
<p>can be performed in this situation.
</p>
<p>4. Link the critical situation and goal-di-
</p>
<p>rected response in an if-then format:
</p>
<p>If _____(critical situation)_____, then 
</p>
<p>_____(goal-directed response)_____!
</p>
<p>As an alternative, participants are 
</p>
<p>sometimes instructed to specify when, 
</p>
<p>where, and how to act toward their goal 
</p>
<p>without providing an if-then format. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, implementation intentions can 
</p>
<p>be combined with the self-regulation 
</p>
<p>strategy of mental contrasting, in which 
</p>
<p>people elaborate on their goals and on 
</p>
<p>potential obstacles for attaining their 
</p>
<p>goals (Oettingen &amp; Gollwitzer, 2018). 
</p>
<p>This combined mental contrasting with 
</p>
<p>implementation intentions (MCII) strat-
</p>
<p>egy is commonly conveyed as a meta-
</p>
<p>cognitive strategy and available online 
</p>
<p>(www.woopmylife.org).

</p>
<p> Cognitive Processes and&nbsp;Moderators
</p>
<p>According to implementation intention theory, 
</p>
<p>the beneficial effects of if-then planning on goal 
</p>
<p>attainment can be attributed to two cognitive pro-
</p>
<p>cesses. First, specifying a critical situation in the 
</p>
<p>if-part activates its mental representation and 
</p>
<p>makes it cognitively more accessible. This makes 
</p>
<p>the situation easier to remember, to detect, and to 
</p>
<p>recognize in the environment. Second, linking 
</p>
<p>the situation to a goal-directed response creates a 
</p>
<p>strong mental association that allows people to 
</p>
<p>initiate the specified response automatically as 
</p>
<p>soon as the critical situation is encountered.
</p>
<p>Plenty of research shows that these two pro-
</p>
<p>cesses&nbsp;&ndash; accessibility of the critical situation and 
</p>
<p>automatic response initiation&nbsp; &ndash; indeed mediate 
</p>
<p>the effects of implementation intentions on goal 
</p>
<p>attainment (Parks-Stamm, Gollwitzer, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Oettingen, 2007; Webb &amp; Sheeran, 2007). 
</p>
<p>Consequently, implementation intentions are 
</p>
<p>assumed to automate behavior, which makes it 
</p>
<p>possible to shield one&rsquo;s goals even from hard-to- 
</p>
<p>control antagonistic influences. For instance, a 
</p>
<p>study by Gollwitzer, Sheeran, Tr&ouml;tschel, and 
</p>
<p>Webb (2011) showed that implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tions alleviate automatic priming effects on 
</p>
<p>behavior. Participants first read a fictitious scien-
</p>
<p>tific article about the genetic similarity between 
</p>
<p>humans and a set of animals. Crucially, this set of 
</p>
<p>animals consisted of fast animals (e.g., cheetah, 
</p>
<p>hare; fast prime) for some participants but of 
</p>
<p>slow animals (e.g., slug, tortoise; slow prime) for 
</p>
<p>others. Subsequently, all participants performed a 
</p>
<p>computerized word classification task in which 
</p>
<p>they had to decide quickly whether a stimulus 
</p>
<p>was a word or a non-word. They formed an 
</p>
<p>implementation intention to respond quickly to a 
</p>
<p>certain stimulus: &ldquo;And if the non- word &lsquo;avenda&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>appears, then I respond especially quickly!&rdquo; The 
</p>
<p>authors found a priming effect in unplanned situ-
</p>
<p>ations, such that participants were slower after 
</p>
<p>having read about slow animals rather than fast 
</p>
<p>animals (left panel of Fig.&nbsp;2.2). In planned situa-
</p>
<p>tions, however, participants were not susceptible 
</p>
<p>to nonconsciously primed concepts of being slow 
</p>
<p>or of being fast and always responded quickly 
</p>
<p>(right panel of Fig.&nbsp;2.2), as specified in the imple-
</p>
<p>mentation intention.
</p>
<p>To demonstrate that implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tions heighten the accessibility of planned situa-
</p>
<p>tions, research has used paradigms in which

</p>
<p>participants work on two allegedly unrelated 
</p>
<p>tasks. In the first task, they form an if-then plan 
</p>
<p>(e.g., &ldquo;When I go to the cafeteria in the afternoon, 
</p>
<p>then I will grab an apple!&rdquo;). In a second task, it is 
</p>
<p>then investigated whether situational cues just 
</p>
<p>specified in the plan (e.g., cafeteria, afternoon) 
</p>
<p>are now cognitively more accessible than neutral 
</p>
<p>cues not specified in the plan. Indeed, it has been 
</p>
<p>demonstrated that people with an implementation 
</p>
<p>intention respond more quickly to planned than 
</p>
<p>to neutral cues in a lexical decision task (Aarts, 
</p>
<p>Dijksterhuis, &amp; Midden, 1999; Webb &amp; Sheeran, 
</p>
<p>2007), which suggests that the planned cues had 
</p>
<p>heightened accessibility. Moreover, people find it 
</p>
<p>difficult to not attend to planned cues, even when 
</p>
<p>this conflicts with successful task performance 
</p>
<p>(Wieber &amp; Sassenberg, 2006). One example 
</p>
<p>comes from a study using an auditory task 
</p>
<p>(Achtziger, Bayer, &amp; Gollwitzer, 2012), in which 
</p>
<p>participants had to respond to acoustic informa-
</p>
<p>tion presented to one ear. The authors found that 
</p>
<p>these responses were slower and more erroneous 
</p>
<p>whenever information related to the planned situ-
</p>
<p>ation was presented simultaneously to the other 
</p>
<p>ear, as compared to neutral information. This fail-
</p>
<p>ure to ignore plan-related information might be 
</p>
<p>due to implementation intentions biasing even 
</p>
<p>earliest perceptual processing toward this infor-
</p>
<p>mation (Janczyk, Dambacher, Bieleke, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Gollwitzer, 2015).
</p>
<p>Regarding the goal-directed response, research 
</p>
<p>has focused strongly on testing whether it can be 
</p>
<p>initiated automatically after having formed an 
</p>
<p>implementation intention (Bargh, 1994). Indeed, 
</p>
<p>it has been shown that the goal-directed response 
</p>
<p>is initiated immediately upon encountering the 
</p>
<p>planned situation (Gollwitzer &amp; Brandst&auml;tter, 
</p>
<p>1997; Orbell &amp; Sheeran, 2000), even when 
</p>
<p>cognitive resources are scarce (Brandst&auml;tter, 
</p>
<p>Lengfelder, &amp; Gollwitzer, 2001; Lengfelder &amp; 
</p>
<p>Gollwitzer, 2001), and in the absence of another 
</p>
<p>conscious intent to act (Bayer, Achtziger, 
</p>
<p>Gollwitzer, &amp; Moskowitz, 2009; Schweiger 
</p>
<p>Gallo, Pfau, &amp; Gollwitzer, 2012; Sheeran, Webb, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Gollwitzer, 2005). For example, participants in 
</p>
<p>one study (Bayer et&nbsp;al., 2009, Exp. 3) saw a series 
</p>
<p>of nonsense syllables and had to either associate 
</p>
<p>freely to them (low strain) or to repeat aloud and 
</p>
<p>memorize them (high strain). In a concurrent go/
</p>
<p>no-go task, they were presented with numbers 
</p>
<p>and letters and had to press a button in case of 
</p>
<p>number but to refrain from pressing in case of a 
</p>
<p>letter. The authors found that participants with an 
</p>
<p>implementation intention to respond quickly to a 
</p>
<p>certain number in the go/no-go task indeed 
</p>
<p>responded faster to this number than to others 
</p>
<p>irrespective of how straining the syllable task 
</p>
<p>was. This suggests that implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tions made the goal-directed behavior efficient in 
</p>
<p>the sense that it can be initiated even when cogni-
</p>
<p>tive resources are taxed.
</p>
<p>In a nutshell, forming implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tions facilitates the detection of the situations 
</p>
<p>specified in the if-then plan and automates the 
</p>
<p>initiation of the goal-directed behavior. However, 
</p>
<p>this does not mean that implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tions, once formed, will always be effective. 
</p>
<p>First, the effectiveness of implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tions remains dependent on the underlying goal 
</p>
<p>intention. For instance, participants who planned 
</p>
<p>how to respond in a color-matching task (&ldquo;If I see 
</p>
<p>a card with the same color as the card at the top 
</p>
<p>of the screen, then I will press the corresponding 
</p>
<p>key as quickly as possible!&rdquo;) refrained from per-
</p>
<p>forming the goal-directed behavior as soon as 
</p>
<p>doing so caused monetary losses and thus under-
</p>
<p>mined the goal to respond quickly (Legrand, 
</p>
<p>Bieleke, Gollwitzer, &amp; Mignon, 2017). This sug-
</p>
<p>gests that implementation intentions are not 
</p>
<p>effective when they do not serve a valued goal 
</p>
<p>(Orbell, Hodgkins, &amp; Sheeran, 1997; Sheeran 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2005). Research has investigated other 
</p>
<p>determinants of the effectiveness of implementa-
</p>
<p>tion intentions as well. As suggested by MAP, 
</p>

</p>
<p>how research on the cognitive processes insti-

</p>
<p>for example, implementation intentions are most 
</p>
<p>effective when people are in an implemental 
</p>
<p>mindset rather than a deliberative mindset 
</p>
<p>(Wieber, Sezer, &amp; Gollwitzer, 2014).
</p>
<p> Application
</p>
<p>Implementation intentions are a self-regulation 
</p>
<p>strategy that should help people to attain their 
</p>
<p>goals across various domains (see also Verplanken 
</p>
<p>&amp; Orbell, Chap. 5). In line with this assertion, 
</p>
<p>accumulating research shows that implementa-

<p>tion intentions enhance goal attainment in 
</p>
<p>domains like healthy eating (Adriaanse, Vinkers, 
</p>
<p>De Ridder, Hox, &amp; De Wit, 2011), engaging in 
</p>
<p>physical activity (B&eacute;langer-Gravel, Godin, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Amireault, 2013), and reducing alcohol con-
</p>
<p>sumption (Cooke &amp; Lowe, 2016). Moreover, 
</p>
<p>implementation intentions are effective among 
</p>
<p>people suffering from psychological disorders 
</p>
<p>like dementia or depression (Toli, Webb, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Hardy, 2015), and they have been shown to facili-
</p>
<p>tate cognitive processes that are important across 
</p>
<p>domains, such as remembering to perform certain 
</p>
<p>actions at a future point in time (Chen et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2015). These examples all pertain to applications 
</p>
<p>in which implementation intentions have been 
</p>
<p>studied comprehensively already and meta-ana-
</p>
<p>lytic evidence for their beneficial effects is avail-
</p>
<p>able (Gollwitzer, 2014).
</p>
<p>Yet, there are still many other fields of appli-
</p>
<p>cation for which implementation intention effects 
</p>
<p>have to be established. One example is the ability 
</p>
<p>to endure physical performance over extended 
</p>
<p>periods of time, a characteristic feature of various 
</p>
<p>Box 2.6 Zooming In: FAQ About 
</p>
<p>Implementation Intentions
</p>
<p>Does forming implementation intentions 
</p>
<p>always improve goal attainment?
</p>
<p>Implementation intentions require an 
</p>
<p>active goal that people perceive to be both 
</p>
<p>desirable and feasible and can thus not com-
</p>
<p>pensate for the colloquial &ldquo;lack of motiva-
</p>
<p>tion&rdquo;. In addition, implementation intentions 
</p>
<p>will not enhance the attainment of easy 
</p>
<p>goals, as mere goals already suffice.
</p>
<p>Can forming implementation intentions 
</p>
<p>have drawbacks?
</p>
<p>Forming implementation intentions 
</p>
<p>involves a delegation of control to specific 
</p>
<p>situational cues. This may alleviate goal 
</p>
<p>attainment when other situations are better-
</p>
<p>suited (missing opportunities to act) or the 
</p>
<p>situation requires a different response (fail-
</p>
<p>ure to control the planned response).
</p>
<p>Is making multiple plans better than mak-
</p>
<p>ing only one plan?
</p>
<p>Implementation intentions rely on an 
</p>
<p>associative link between a situation and a 
</p>
<p>response. This link can be weakened by 
</p>
<p>making multiple plans for the same goal 
</p>
<p>(e.g., linking different responses to one sit-
</p>
<p>uation). This is less of an issue when mak-
</p>
<p>ing plans for independent goals.
</p>
<p>Does every if-then statement qualify as an 
</p>
<p>implementation intention?
</p>
<p>Implementation intentions condition a 
</p>
<p>response on a situation in an if-then format. 
</p>
<p>For instance, a statement like &ldquo;If I do regu-
</p>
<p>lar workouts, then I will stay fit!&rdquo; is gram-
</p>
<p>matically possible as well as logically valid 
</p>
<p>but would not constitute an implementation 
</p>
<p>intention because it conditions an outcome 
</p>
<p>on a behavior.
</p>
<p>Are forming implementation intentions and 
</p>
<p>the implemental mindset the same thing?
</p>
<p>Whereas MAP constitutes a theory that 
</p>
<p>combines motivation and volition, imple-
</p>
<p>mentation intention theory describes a self-
</p>
<p>regulation strategy that can be used to 
</p>
<p>achieve goals. Although often confused, 
</p>
<p>implementation intentions are not confined 
</p>
<p>to the preactional phase during which an 
</p>
<p>implemental mindset is usually activated. 
</p>
<p>For instance, implementation intentions 
</p>
<p>like &ldquo;If I have to make a decision, then I will 
</p>
<p>deliberate thoroughly&rdquo; can trigger a more 
</p>
<p>open-minded way of processing informa-
</p>
<p>tion during the predecisional phase.

<p>work-related activities (e.g., in hospitals or 
</p>
<p>factories) and prototypically required in many 
</p>
<p>athletic activities (e.g., running, swimming, 
</p>
<p>cycling). Given the beneficial effects of imple-
</p>
<p>mentation intentions in many domains and for 
</p>
<p>diverse populations, it is plausible that people can 
</p>
<p>use them to deal with the various self- regulation 
</p>
<p>demands encountered during endurance tasks, 
</p>
<p>like dealing with muscle pain, feelings of exer-
</p>
<p>tion, fatigue, and urges to quit. In partial support 
</p>
<p>of this reasoning, initial studies have shown that 
</p>
<p>implementation intentions can indeed modulate 
</p>
<p>endurance-related sensations (Bieleke &amp; Wolff, 
</p>
<p>2017; Wolff et&nbsp;al., 2018) and may even enhance 
</p>
<p>performance (Th&uuml;rmer, Wieber, &amp; Gollwitzer, 
</p>
<p>2017). However, implementation intentions failed 
</p>
<p>to enhance performance in some endurance tasks 
</p>
<p>and even had undesired effects on perceptions of 
</p>
<p>effort and pain in one study (Bieleke &amp; Wolff, 
</p>
<p>2017). This suggests that implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tions must be carefully tailored to different areas 
</p>
<p>of applications and that their effectiveness in one 
</p>
<p>domain cannot be simply deduced from their 
</p>
<p>effectiveness in other domains (Wolff, Bieleke, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Sch&uuml;ler, 2019).
</p>
<p> Example Study: Bridging 
the&nbsp;Intention-Behavior Gap: 
Inducing Implementation 
Intentions Through&nbsp;Persuasive 
Appeals (Fennis, Adriaanse, 
Stroebe, &amp; Pol, 2011)
</p>
<p>Implementation intentions have been used in a 
</p>
<p>number of field studies. Among others, there have 
</p>
<p>been field studies on the effect of implementation 
</p>
<p>intentions on attendance of cervical cancer screen-
</p>
<p>ings (Sheeran &amp; Orbell, 2000), fruit and vegetable 
</p>
<p>intake (Chapman, Armitage, &amp; Norman, 2009), 
</p>
<p>or recycling behavior of employees (Holland, 
</p>
<p>Aarts, &amp; Langendam, 2006). In the following, we 
</p>
<p>want to describe a field study testing the effect of 
</p>
<p>implementation intentions in the domain of con-
</p>
<p>sumer psychology. Fennis et&nbsp; al. (2011) investi-
</p>
<p>gated whether the presentation of cue- response 
</p>
<p>links on a web page can stimulate consumers to 
</p>
<p>spontaneously form implementation intentions 
</p>
<p>and consequently opt for sustainable food 
</p>
<p>products. They instructed 217 participants (mean 
</p>
<p>age&nbsp;=&nbsp;24.5&nbsp;years, SD&nbsp;=&nbsp;7.6&nbsp;years) to visit a web 
</p>
<p>page advocating sustainable consumption and 
</p>
<p>assigned participants to one of four different ver-
</p>
<p>sions of this web page.
</p>
<p>First, for one half of the participants (goal- 
</p>
<p>intention condition), the web page described a fair-
</p>
<p>trade pocket guide showing ways to increase the 
</p>
<p>sustainability of one&rsquo;s consumption. For the other 
</p>
<p>half of the participants (goal-intention + imple-
</p>
<p>mentation intention condition), the web page addi-
</p>
<p>tionally listed critical situations in which one 
</p>
<p>should exhibit the goal-directed behavior of check-
</p>
<p>ing the pocket guide. This was thought to prompt 
</p>
<p>participants to construct if-then situation-response 
</p>
<p>links. Second, the vividness of the information 
</p>
<p>was manipulated within each condition. One half 
</p>
<p>of participants (high-vividness condition) read the 
</p>
<p>fictitious story of a female student who described 
</p>
<p>how shocked she was upon learning about the 
</p>
<p>unsustainable or unfair manufacturing process of 
</p>
<p>some products (e.g., poor working conditions, 
</p>
<p>damage to the environment). She decided to buy 
</p>
<p>only sustainable products from now on and 
</p>
<p>described how the use of the pocket guide will 
</p>
<p>help her doing that. Furthermore, the critical situ-
</p>
<p>ations to use the pocket guide were also described 
</p>
<p>as stemming from her personal experience with 
</p>
<p>using the guide. The other half of participants 
</p>
<p>(low-vividness condition) received similar infor-
</p>
<p>mation, which was presented using bullet points 
</p>
<p>and not a personal narration of a student they 
</p>
<p>potentially identify with. The authors hypothe-
</p>
<p>sized that the more vivid the presentation of the 
</p>
<p>information is, the more likely participants will be 
</p>
<p>to adapt their behavior. Moreover, the more vivid 
</p>
<p>and practical the cue-response links are, the more 
</p>
<p>likely participants will form implementation 
</p>
<p>intentions, which in turn will facilitate the attain-
</p>
<p>ment of the goal to consume sustainably.
</p>
<p>One week after all participants received the 
</p>
<p>pocket guide, the experimenters contacted the 
</p>
<p>participants and asked them to register which 
</p>
<p>food products they bought over the week. For this 
</p>
<p>purpose, a list of 30 different categories and the 
</p>
<p>leading brands per category was assembled and 
</p>
<p>distributed. Participants then indicated which 
</p>
<p>L. Keller et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>33
</p>
<p>brands they had bought per category. Results 
</p>
<p>show that including the cue-response link in the 
</p>
<p>description of the pocket guide increased 
</p>
<p>purchases of sustainable products on average by 
</p>
<p>one item. Vividness on its own was not a 
</p>
<p>significant factor in predicting the amount of 
</p>
<p>sustainable purchases. However, the interaction 
</p>
<p>between both experimental conditions reached 
</p>
<p>statistical significance. Follow-up analyses show 
</p>
<p>that whereas information low in vividness was less 
</p>
<p>likely to influence consumer behavior independent 
</p>
<p>of whether it included implementation intention-
</p>
<p>like cue-response links or not, the inclusion of cue-
</p>
<p>response links in highly vivid information more 
</p>
<p>than doubled the number of sustainable product 
</p>
<p>purchases. To rule out the alternative explanation 
</p>
<p>that participants in the goal intention + implemen-
</p>
<p>tation intention condition merely bought more 
</p>
<p>products in total and thus had more sustainable 
</p>
<p>products in their shopping carts, the authors calcu-
</p>
<p>lated a ratio of sustainable to regular products. 
</p>
<p>Mirroring the results on the mere amount of sus-
</p>
<p>tainable choices, the ratio of sustainable to regu-
</p>
<p>lar products bought by participants receiving 
</p>
<p>information low in vividness was around 0.30 for 
</p>
<p>both goal conditions. Participants who were in 
</p>
<p>the goal intention + implementation intention 
</p>
<p>condition, however, had a ratio of 0.58 meaning 
</p>
<p>that for every two regular items, they bought one 
</p>
<p>sustainable item.
</p>
<p>Taken together, this field study shows that the 
</p>
<p>self-regulation strategy of forming implementa-
</p>
<p>tion intentions can increase goal attainment among 
</p>
<p>participants who only read about someone else 
</p>
<p>doing it.

<p>interventions in health contexts: State of the 
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Goal pursuit can be described by the 
</p>
<p>succession of a predecisional, preac-
</p>
<p>tional, actional, and postactional phase. 
</p>
<p>The decision in favor of one goal marks 
</p>
<p>the metaphorical Rubicon, the switch 
</p>
<p>from a motivational to a volitional focus.
</p>
<p>&bull; In the predecisional phase, individuals 
</p>
<p>in a deliberative mindset partake in 
</p>
<p>open-minded weighing of pros and cons 
</p>
<p>for the goal in question. In the preactional 
</p>
<p>phase, individuals in an implemental 
</p>
<p>mindset are planning the steps needed for 
</p>
<p>goal attainment.
</p>
<p>&bull; Implementation intentions (i.e., spe-
</p>
<p>cific if-then plans) are often superior to 
</p>
<p>mere goal intentions concerning goal 
</p>
<p>attainment.
</p>
<p>&bull; The formulation of a critical situation 
</p>
<p>(e.g., a suitable opportunity to act or an 
</p>
<p>obstacle to overcome) in the if-part raises 
</p>
<p>the chance of successful recognition and 
</p>
<p>thus counteracts missing opportunities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Combining a critical situation with a 
</p>
<p>suitable goal-directed response in the 
</p>
<p>then-part creates an efficient link for 
</p>
<p>initiating action, requiring no further act 
</p>
<p>of conscious intent.
</p>
<p>&bull; Both mindset and implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tion effects have been demonstrated in 
</p>
<p>many domains, including health, sports, 
</p>
<p>risk, or (social) cognition.

<p> Guiding Answers to&nbsp;Questions 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Q (with Box 2.1): When you try to think about 
</p>
<p>your past goals and goal strivings, which 
</p>
<p>aspects may be missing in the model?
</p>
<p>A: As a vehicle for research, MAP has to 
</p>
<p>weigh parsimony against explanatory power. 
</p>
<p>Thus, to be able to generalize unto a wide 
</p>
<p>array of goal pursuits, some other aspects may 
</p>
<p>be missing. For instance, MAP is focused on 
</p>
<p>the cognitive aspects of goal pursuit and is 
</p>
<p>relatively mute on emotional aspects of goal 
</p>
<p>pursuit. Furthermore, it is directional by 
</p>
<p>nature, proposing a fixed order in which 
</p>
<p>phases are surpassed which may not be the 
</p>
<p>case for every goal pursuit in daily life.
</p>
<p> 2. Q (with Box 2.2): At what point of MAP 
</p>
<p>would Tierney have located the US president? 
</p>
<p>What are institutional safeguards to prevent 
</p>
<p>such overconfidence?
</p>
<p>A: By saying that Trump has crossed the 
</p>
<p>Rubicon, Tierney implicates that the US presi-
</p>
<p>dent switched from an open-minded predeci-
</p>
<p>sional action phase to later, more 
</p>
<p>closed-minded action phases. A sincere 
</p>
<p>renewed deliberation of arguments in favor 
</p>
<p>and against further investment, for instance, 
</p>
<p>by actors who take a watchtower perspective, 
</p>
<p>may help to prevent such overconfidence. 
</p>
<p>In addition, turnover in responsible decision-
</p>
<p>makers caused by term limits can lead to such 
</p>
<p>redeliberating.
</p>
<p> 3. Q (with Box 2.4): Think about your past New 
</p>
<p>Year&rsquo;s resolutions (or those of your friends). 
</p>
<p>Were they specified as a goal intention? How 
</p>
<p>could a corresponding implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tion look like?
</p>
<p>A: A New Year&rsquo;s resolution that merely speci-
</p>
<p>fies a desired outcome or behavior is a goal 
</p>
<p>intention. To create an implementation inten-
</p>
<p>tion, one needs to specify when, where, and 
</p>
<p>how to act toward this goal in an if-then plan.
</p>
<p> 4. Q (with Box 2.5): Making if-then plans is 
</p>
<p>sometimes said to create &ldquo;instant habits&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Gollwitzer, 1999). Think about how 
</p>
<p>research on the cognitive processes insti-
</p>
<p>gated by forming implementation intentions 
</p>
<p>might have given rise to this metaphor.
</p>
<p>A: The metaphor refers to the finding that if-
</p>
<p>then planning automates behavior, such that the 
</p>
<p>planned behavior is initiated immediately and 
</p>
<p>efficiently when the critical situation is encoun-
</p>
<p>tered. This resembles habitual behavior with 
</p>
<p>the exception that the situation-behavior link is 
</p>
<p>established with a single voluntary act rather 
</p>
<p>than learned over time (see also Verplanken &amp; 
</p>
<p>Orbell, Chap. 5).

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Have you ever been passionate about a theoreti-
</p>
<p>cal approach you learned in class? When the 
</p>
<p>class ended, you may have approached the pro-
</p>
<p>fessor to ask for clarifications, elaborations, and 
</p>
<p>maybe additional reading materials. Later, during 
</p>
<p>a coffee break, you discussed the ideas with your 
</p>
<p>friends and were eager to go online to look for 
</p>
<p>more information.
</p>
<p>At the same time, I&rsquo;m sure you remember 
</p>
<p>other classes in which passion and eagerness 
</p>
<p>could not describe your experience, but pressure 
</p>
<p>and anxiety definitely could. You may have felt 
</p>
<p>pressure to succeed because the course was man-
</p>
<p>datory in your program and you needed a certain 
</p>
<p>grade. You found the material uninteresting and 
</p>
<p>meaningless. The professor lectured monoto-
</p>
<p>nously and slowly, without distinguishing 
</p>
<p>between the important and the unimportant. 
</p>
<p>However, you did not dare to skip a single class 
</p>
<p>because you wanted to make sure that you took 
</p>
<p>all the necessary notes for the final exam. The 
</p>
<p>course was a millstone around your neck, and 
</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t wait to put it behind you. You prob-
</p>
<p>ably studied hard before the exam to make sure 
</p>
<p>your grade was high enough.
</p>
<p>You may also remember another class expe-
</p>
<p>rience where after half an hour, you found your-
</p>
<p>self staring at the professor with no idea what 
</p>
<p>she was talking about. You may have taken some </p>

</p>
<p>notes but in an automatic manner without really 
</p>
<p>paying attention; before the final exam, you 
</p>
<p>might have read them but couldn&rsquo;t remember 
</p>
<p>anything, questioning if you were the one who 
</p>
<p>actually wrote this stuff. It does not mean that 
</p>
<p>you necessarily felt incompetent in this class. 
</p>
<p>The material was not beyond your ability to 
</p>
<p>understand. You may even have felt it was quite 
</p>
<p>simple, even trivial.
</p>
<p>As a high achiever and to ensure good grades 
</p>
<p>in the three classes, you may have invested equal 
</p>
<p>effort before the final exams. So even though you 
</p>
<p>felt quite competent in the three classes, and you 
</p>
<p>made efforts to succeed, your experience as a 
</p>
<p>learner was completely different: enthusiastic and 
</p>
<p>eager in one class, stressed and anxious in the sec-
</p>
<p>ond, and bored and maybe even irritated in the 
</p>
<p>third. Thus, the different experiences cannot be 
</p>
<p>explained by different levels of ability or different 
</p>
<p>levels of overall motivation (at least in relation to 
</p>
<p>the final exam). It seems that in these aspects, the 
</p>
<p>experiences are similar. However, they diverge in 
</p>
<p>another important aspect, and that&rsquo;s the topic of 
</p>
<p>this chapter.
</p>
<p>Self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan &amp; 
</p>
<p>Deci, 2017) distinguishes between the amount 
</p>
<p>(intensity) of motivation and its quality. The 
</p>
<p>three common experiences described here differ 
</p>
<p>in the quality of motivation but not necessarily 
</p>
<p>the amount or intensity. The theory specifically 
</p>
<p>distinguishes between two types of motivations 
</p>
<p>differing in their quality: autonomous motiva-
</p>
<p>tion and controlled motivation. When autono-
</p>
<p>mously motivated, people perceive themselves 
</p>
<p>as the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; of their own behavior, whereas in 
</p>
<p>controlled motivation, they perceive themselves 
</p>
<p>as &ldquo;pawns&rdquo; subject to other forces. Research in 
</p>
<p>the last three decades has demonstrated that 
</p>
<p>autonomous motivation has an advantage over 
</p>
<p>controlled motivation in many respects, includ-
</p>
<p>ing better psychological health and better qual-
</p>
<p>ity of behavior (e.g., flexible behavior versus 
</p>
<p>rigidity).
</p>
<p>The chapter begins by defining autonomous 
</p>
<p>and controlled motivation and explaining their 
</p>
<p>measurement. It turns to a discussion of the out-
</p>
<p>comes of the different types of motivation and 
</p>
<p>describes a portion of the large body of research 
</p>
<p>on each. The chapter concludes with a summary 
</p>
<p>of research on human behavior in applied settings 
</p>
<p>and a discussion of a field study in an educational 
</p>
<p>context.
</p>
<p> Types of&nbsp;Motivation
</p>
<p>SDT researchers are interested in the types of 
</p>
<p>motivations that drive behavior (Ryan &amp; Deci, 
</p>
<p>2000). Such research often focuses on the dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between intrinsically and extrinsically 
</p>
<p>motivated behavior. In the former, people do 
</p>
<p>something because it is inherently interesting or 
</p>
<p>enjoyable; in the latter, they are looking for a 
</p>
<p>reward of some kind or are trying to avoid pun-
</p>
<p>ishment (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985). Yet, other types 
</p>
<p>of motivations do play a role in explaining 
</p>
<p>behavior (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000). Undoubtedly, 
</p>
<p>much of what people do involves external pres-
</p>
<p>sure to act in a certain way, to believe specific 
</p>
<p>ideas, and to hold specific values and opinions. 
</p>
<p>SDT suggests that non-intrinsically motivated 
</p>
<p>activities encouraged by others (such as parents, 
</p>
<p>teachers, or employers) may allow different 
</p>
<p>levels of perceived autonomy, reflecting the 
</p>
<p>degree to which the values of the behavior have 
</p>
<p>been internalized by the individual (Grolnick, 
</p>
<p>Deci, &amp; Ryan, 1997).
</p>
<p>Advanced SDT conceptualizations of under-
</p>
<p>lying motivations not only distinguish extrinsi-
</p>
<p>cally and intrinsically motivated behaviors but 
</p>
<p>also point to extrinsically motivated behaviors 
</p>
<p>that vary in their relative autonomy level (Roth, 
</p>
<p>Assor, Kanat-Maymon, &amp; Kaplan, 2006; Ryan &amp; 
</p>
<p>Connell, 1989). These conceptualizations are 
</p>
<p>reflected in the distinction between autonomous 
</p>
<p>and controlled motivations. Autonomous moti-
</p>
<p>vation involves volition and choice and includes 
</p>
<p>intrinsic motivation and well-internalized forms 
</p>
<p>of extrinsic motivation. In contrast, behavior 
</p>
<p>driven by controlled motivations involves an 
</p>
<p>external or internal sense of compulsion and 
</p>
<p>poorly internalized forms of extrinsic  motivations 
</p>
<p>(Grolnick et&nbsp; al., 1997; Roth, Assor, Niemiec, 
</p>
<p>Ryan, &amp; Deci, 2009).

</p>
<p> Amotivation, Controlled 
Motivation, and&nbsp;Autonomous 
Motivation
</p>
<p>Amotivation denotes an absence of motivation. 
</p>
<p>For example, an individual may not value an 
</p>
<p>activity, may not think it will lead to a desired 
</p>
<p>result, or may not feel capable of performing it. 
</p>
<p>One consequence of amotivation is resentment: 
</p>
<p>one study found amotivated individuals resented 
</p>
<p>those agents perceived as acting on them; as a 
</p>
<p>result, they disengaged and performed poorly 
</p>
<p>(Roth et&nbsp;al., 2009).
</p>
<p>Controlled motivation denotes behavior per-
</p>
<p>formed under a sense of pressure or compulsion. 
</p>
<p>The control can be either external or introjected. 
</p>
<p>In external motivation, behavior is controlled by 
</p>
<p>external reward and punishment, with little inter-
</p>
<p>nalization. The behavior is maintained only in the 
</p>
<p>presence of the controlling person (e.g., a parent, 
</p>
<p>teacher, or employer). Introjected motivation is a 
</p>
<p>superficial type of internalization. The individual 
</p>
<p>takes in the externally expected behavior&rsquo;s value 
</p>
<p>but does not really accept it as his or her own. 
</p>
<p>Acting on a sense of inner compulsion, this indi-
</p>
<p>vidual imposes on himself/herself the same con-
</p>
<p>tingencies of approval that the controlling person 
</p>
<p>had previously imposed. Put otherwise, their 
</p>
<p>self-esteem is contingent on enacting specific 
</p>
<p>behaviors. Thus, although motivation now lies 
</p>
<p>within the individual, it continues to be con-
</p>
<p>trolled. For example, students with controlled 
</p>
<p>motivation may make a considerable effort 
</p>
<p>(large amounts of motivation) to enhance their 
</p>
<p>self- esteem or to avoid embarrassment (introjec-
</p>
<p>tion), or they may try to outperform other students 
</p>
<p>because they wish to please the professor or to 
</p>
<p>avoid sanctions (external motivation). Controlled 
</p>
<p>motivation, reflected in feeling pressured to per-
</p>
<p>form specific behaviors, can result in constricted 
</p>
<p>and shallow behavioral functioning and perfor-
</p>
<p>mance, diminished well-being, and low-quality 
</p>
<p>behavior (e.g., Grolnick &amp; Ryan, 1989; Roth 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2009).
</p>
<p>Autonomous motivation denotes behaviors 
</p>
<p>performed with a sense of volition and choice. It 
</p>
<p>can be divided into three subtypes: identified, inte-
</p>
<p>grated, or intrinsic. In identified motivation, an 
</p>
<p>individual has already identified with a behavior&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>importance to him or her and performs the behav-
</p>
<p>ior autonomously. In integrated motivation, a 
</p>
<p>behavior is deeply internalized and autonomous 
</p>
<p>because it has been assimilated with other aspects 
</p>
<p>of the self. In intrinsic motivation, an individual 
</p>
<p>performs an activity because it is inherently inter-
</p>
<p>esting and internalization is not needed. Altogether, 
</p>
<p>autonomous motivation characterizes individuals 
</p>
<p>who invest efforts because they are interested, take 
</p>
<p>pleasure, or find value in doing so.
</p>
<p>It is possible to view the types of motivation as 
</p>
<p>levels of internalization of behaviors and/or val-
</p>
<p>ues, reflecting different stages on a continuum of 
</p>
<p>autonomy. For example, we may agree that no 
</p>
<p>child is born with the intrinsic motivation to brush 
</p>
<p>his/her teeth twice a day. When the parent does it 
</p>
<p>for him/her, the regulation is purely external. 
</p>
<p>While the child grows and can do it effectively by 
</p>
<p>himself/herself, the parent may explain the impor-
</p>
<p>tance of brushing teeth for oral hygiene, allowing 
</p>
<p>him/her to identify with the value of brushing 
</p>
<p>his/her teeth consistently and effectively. Thus, 
</p>
<p>thanks to the parental provision of a rationale, the 
</p>
<p>child internalizes the importance of the behavior, 
</p>
<p>and instead of external motivation, the behavior 
</p>
<p>becomes motivated autonomously based on identi-
</p>
<p>fication with its value for oral hygiene. Later in the 
</p>
<p>chapter, I will discuss contextual support for 
</p>
<p>autonomous motivation (e.g., the parents&rsquo; provi-
</p>
<p>sion of a rationale), but first I want to talk about 
</p>
<p>how these different types of motivation (or levels 
</p>
<p>of internalization) are measured.
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Autonomous motivation: involves voli-
</p>
<p>tion and choice and includes intrinsic moti-
</p>
<p>vation and well-internalized forms of 
</p>
<p>extrinsic motivation.
</p>
<p>Controlled motivation: involves an exter-
</p>
<p>nal or internal sense of compulsion and 
</p>
<p>includes poorly internalized forms of

</p>
<p> Measurements and&nbsp;Outcomes 
of&nbsp;Autonomous and&nbsp;Controlled 
Motivation
</p>
<p>Motivation has obvious application in a class-
</p>
<p>room situation, and, here, Ryan and Connell 
</p>
<p>(1989) were innovators. By implementing 
</p>
<p>deCharms&rsquo;s (1968) concept of the &ldquo;perceived 
</p>
<p>locus of causality,&rdquo; they assessed four of the five 
</p>
<p>types of motivations discussed above (external, 
</p>
<p>introjected, identified, and intrinsic) by asking 
</p>
<p>students to indicate the reasons for their actions 
</p>
<p>in academic achievement and also in prosocial 
</p>
<p>behavior. External motivation referred to external 
</p>
<p>authority, fear of punishment, or rule compliance 
</p>
<p>as reasons for behavior; introjected motivation 
</p>
<p>referred to internal, esteem-based pressures; 
</p>
<p>identified motivation referred to the students&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>own values or goals; and intrinsic motivation 
</p>
<p>referred to inherent interest and enjoyment1 
</p>
<p>(see Table&nbsp;3.1).
</p>
<p>As they expected, when they tested the stu-
</p>
<p>dents, Ryan and Connell (1989) found a simplex- 
</p>
<p>like pattern of correlations among the four types 
</p>
<p>of motivations. The simplex concept comes from 
</p>
<p>Guttman&rsquo;s (1968) Radex theory on the ordered 
</p>
<p>relations of correlated variables, whereby the 
</p>
<p>magnitude of the correlations among variables 
</p>
<p>reflects their conceptual similarity. In this case, 
</p>
<p>1 Integrated motivation is generally not examined using 
</p>
<p>self-reports because it can be difficult to distinguish 
</p>
<p>between identified and integrated motivations
</p>
<p>the largest correlations were between adjacent, 
</p>
<p>conceptually similar motivation types (e.g., iden-
</p>
<p>tified and intrinsic), and they tapered off as the 
</p>
<p>types became conceptually more distant. Ryan 
</p>
<p>and Connell also created a relative autonomy 
</p>
<p>index (RAI), an overall indicator of autonomous 
</p>
<p>motivation, by assigning positive weights to the 
</p>
<p>two autonomous motivations (identified, intrin-
</p>
<p>sic) and negative weights to the two controlled 
</p>
<p>motivations (external, introjected). Since its 
</p>
<p>development, their approach has been used 
</p>
<p>extensively in various domains and cultures; the 
</p>
<p>RAI index associates positively with diverse 
</p>
<p>desirable outcomes and negatively with undesir-
</p>
<p>able ones (Assor, Roth, &amp; Deci, 2004; Pelletier, 
</p>
<p>Dion, Slovinec-D&rsquo;Angelo, &amp; Reid, 2004; Roth 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2006).
</p>
<p> Consequences of&nbsp;Autonomous 
and&nbsp;Controlled Motivation
</p>
<p>Empirical research consistently shows that auton-
</p>
<p>omous motivation predicts greater behavioral per-
</p>
<p>sistence in the absence of external controls, higher 
</p>
<p>quality of performance, and better emotional expe-
</p>
<p>rience and well-being than controlled motivation. 
</p>
<p>Because autonomously motivated individuals 
</p>
<p>value a behavior or find it interesting and/or enjoy-
</p>
<p>able, they experience less internal conflict about 
</p>
<p>performing it and are more dedicated to it (Ryan &amp; 
</p>
<p>Deci, 2017). In contrast, controlled motivation can 
</p>
<p>involve internal conflict and a sense of internal 
</p>
<p>compulsion (i.e., introjected motivation; Roth, 
</p>
<p>2008) or external conflict and a sense of external 
</p>
<p>compulsion (i.e., external motivation) and is 
</p>
<p>therefore related to rigid behavior, less persis-
</p>
<p>tence, and a sense of ill- being (Pelletier et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>1995; Vansteenkiste et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>Hence, consequences of the types of motiva-
</p>
<p>tion have been noted in quite varied domains, 
</p>
<p>including education, relationships, health care, 
</p>
<p>psychotherapy, religion, aging, and sports (for a 
</p>
<p>review, see Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017). For explanatory 
</p>
<p>purposes, I will provide a few examples.
</p>
<p>Ryan and Connell (1989) found autonomous 
</p>
<p>motivation was related to positive affect and a 
</p>
<p>proactive coping style, greater empathy, more 
</p>

achievement in class (Ryan &amp; Connell, 1989)
</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m working on class work I do so because&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>External motivation
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get in trouble if I don&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m supposed to do.
</p>
<p>Introjected motivation
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll feel bad about myself if I don&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll feel ashamed of myself if I don&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>Identified motivation
</p>
<p>I want to understand the subject.
</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to.
</p>
<p>Intrinsic motivation
</p>
<p>I enjoy it.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting for me.

</p>
<p>mature moral reasoning, and more positive relat-
</p>
<p>edness to others. In contrast, controlled motiva-
</p>
<p>tion was related to negative affect and maladaptive 
</p>
<p>coping, as well as anxiety magnification follow-
</p>
<p>ing failure, suggesting controlled motivation 
</p>
<p>makes people vulnerable when they fail to per-
</p>
<p>form the desired activity.
</p>
<p>In a later study, Roth (2008) found controlled 
</p>
<p>motivation was related to ego-oriented prosocial 
</p>
<p>helping (a helping behavior enacted for the sake 
</p>
<p>of others&rsquo; approval and appreciation), whereas 
</p>
<p>autonomous motivation was related to other- 
</p>
<p>oriented helping (a helping behavior performed 
</p>
<p>while focusing on the needs and inclinations of 
</p>
<p>the other in need).
</p>
<p>Evans and Bonneville-Roussy (2015) studied 
</p>
<p>college students&rsquo; motivation for music studies. 
</p>
<p>Interestingly, but not surprisingly, autonomous 
</p>
<p>motivation predicted more frequent practice, 
</p>
<p>higher quality of practice, and greater prefer-
</p>
<p>ences for challenging parts of music. Looking at 
</p>
<p>high schoolers, Vansteenkiste et&nbsp;al. (2010) found 
</p>
<p>autonomous motivation predicted more sophisti-
</p>
<p>cated informational processing, better distinction 
</p>
<p>between the important and unimportant, better 
</p>
<p>concentration (students&rsquo; ability to direct and 
</p>
<p>maintain their attention on academic tasks), and 
</p>
<p>better time management strategies for academic 
</p>
<p>tasks. It was negatively related to cheating atti-
</p>
<p>tudes and unrelated to test anxiety. Controlled 
</p>
<p>motivation, however, was positively related to 
</p>
<p>test anxiety and unrelated to the other outcome 
</p>
<p>measures.
</p>
<p>Aelterman et&nbsp;al. (2012) studied objective indi-
</p>
<p>cators of physical activity among secondary school 
</p>
<p>students as a function of their types of motivation. 
</p>
<p>Their multilevel analysis revealed that 37% and 
</p>
<p>63% of the variance in physical activity were 
</p>
<p>explained by between-student and between-class 
</p>
<p>differences, respectively. Thus, autonomous class 
</p>
<p>motivation was positively related to between-class 
</p>
<p>variation in physical activity.
</p>
<p>Finally, in a study of health care, Halvari, 
</p>
<p>Halvari, Bj&oslash;rnebekk, and Deci (2012) found that 
</p>
<p>autonomous motivation for dental home care pre-
</p>
<p>dicted dental health behavior and oral health.
</p>
<p>I could go on, but as the few studies mentioned 
</p>
<p>here demonstrate, autonomous motivation is 
</p>
<p>essential for adaptive functioning and well-being 
</p>
<p>(for a review, see Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017; or go 
</p>
<p>online to selfdetermination.org). Therefore, it 
</p>
<p>seems important to explore its antecedents. Over 
</p>
<p>the last three decades, researchers have devel-
</p>
<p>oped a vast theoretical and practical knowledge 
</p>
<p>of factors supporting and frustrating autonomous 
</p>
<p>motivation.
</p>
<p> Antecedents of&nbsp;Autonomous 
and&nbsp;Controlled Motivations
</p>
<p>Can social conditions facilitate (or inhibit) auton-
</p>
<p>omous motivation? SDT postulates that humans 
</p>
<p>have an inherent and deeply evolved propensity 
</p>
<p>to explore, assimilate knowledge, and develop 
</p>
<p>new skills. They strive to integrate these new 
</p>
<p>experiences into a harmonious sense of self 
</p>
<p>(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000). But SDT also recognizes 
</p>
<p>that the tendency to be actively involved does not 
</p>
<p>happen automatically; in fact, some individuals 
</p>
<p>become passive or counterproductive (Ryan &amp; 
</p>
<p>Deci, 2000). SDT suggests these natural propen-
</p>
<p>sities can be supported or undermined by contex-
</p>
<p>tual factors, including a person&rsquo;s immediate 
</p>
<p>situation and developmental history, making the 
</p>
<p>social context a key factor in growth, integration, 
</p>
<p>and mental health (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000; Van Den 
</p>
<p>Broeck, Vansteenkiste, &amp; De Witte, 2008). 
</p>
<p>Specifically, SDT posits that autonomous moti-
</p>
<p>vation is facilitated by the satisfaction of three 
</p>
<p>primary psychological needs: competence, relat-
</p>
<p>edness, and autonomy (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000; 
</p>
<p>Ryan, 1995). Several psychological approaches 
</p>
<p>use the concept of needs but do it very differently. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, before I move on to the definition of 
</p>
<p>each of these three specific needs and the contex-
</p>
<p>tual factors that may support or frustrate them in 
</p>
<p>the next section, I first briefly touch on some 
</p>
<p>unique aspects of SDT&rsquo;s definition of needs.
</p>
<p>Two main approaches to psychological needs 
</p>
<p>have been developed in the literature. One tends 
</p>
<p>to view needs as learned during socialization 
</p>
<p>(e.g., McClelland, 1985) and therefore differing 
</p>
<p>in strength as a function of that learning, and the 
</p>
<p>other views them as universal and innate (Deci &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ryan, 2000).
</p>
<p>3 Self-Determination Theory</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://selfdetermination.org">http://selfdetermination.org</a></div>

<p>44
</p>
<p>McClelland (1985) and others draw on the 
</p>
<p>former theory to predict behavior. More specifi-
</p>
<p>cally, these researchers predict variations in the 
</p>
<p>strength of individuals&rsquo; acquired needs based on 
</p>
<p>the social conditions creating them, test for these 
</p>
<p>differences, and then predict various outcomes 
</p>
<p>based on need strength. This hypothesis has been 
</p>
<p>used to examine the consequences of different 
</p>
<p>levels of achievement motivation (Atkinson, 
</p>
<p>1958) and power motivation (Winter, 1973) and 
</p>
<p>to probe the outcomes of different combinations 
</p>
<p>of need strength. Importantly, they do not associ-
</p>
<p>ate psychological need satisfaction with health 
</p>
<p>and well-being.
</p>
<p>In contrast, in the second approach, SDT 
</p>
<p>research defines psychological needs as innate 
</p>
<p>necessities, not acquired motives. In SDT, meeting 
</p>
<p>these needs is considered essential for well- being. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, a basic difference in the research 
</p>
<p>approaches is that SDT research does not focus on 
</p>
<p>variations in need strength. Rather, it examines the 
</p>
<p>extent to which individuals experience basic psy-
</p>
<p>chological need satisfaction in different social 
</p>
<p>contexts. It also asks if different degrees of satis-
</p>
<p>faction have different consequences. The primary 
</p>
<p>assumption and subsequent findings reveal that in 
</p>
<p>contexts that support basic psychological needs 
</p>
<p>for relatedness, competence, and autonomy, indi-
</p>
<p>viduals experience greater well-being and more 
</p>
<p>autonomous motivation, whereas in contexts that 
</p>
<p>frustrate these psychological needs, individuals 
</p>
<p>experience controlled motivation or amotivation 
</p>
<p>and ill-being.
</p>
<p> Basic Psychological Needs: 
Definition and&nbsp;Contextual Support
</p>
<p>People are more likely to engage in an activity if 
</p>
<p>they think they can do it (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000). 
</p>
<p>Competence support, often defined as the provi-
</p>
<p>sion of structure (versus chaos), refers to guide-
</p>
<p>lines for behavior and involves communication of 
</p>
<p>expectations, explanations and administration of 
</p>
<p>consequences, and informational feedback 
</p>
<p>(Grolnick et&nbsp;al., 1997). In the school setting, such 
</p>
<p>support is essential for both students and teach-
</p>
<p>ers. In studies of students, Skinner, Johnson, and 
</p>
<p>Snyder (2005) and Jang, Reeve, and Deci (2010) 
</p>
<p>demonstrated that when teachers communicate2 
</p>
<p>well-defined expectations and give explicit direc-
</p>
<p>tions, students&rsquo; competence and engagement are 
</p>
<p>supported. In a study of teachers, Fernet, Austin, 
</p>
<p>Trepanier, and Dussault (2013) found that role 
</p>
<p>ambiguity diminishes teachers&rsquo; sense of personal 
</p>
<p>accomplishment at school by decreasing their 
</p>
<p>sense of competence. A role is ambiguous if an 
</p>
<p>individual does not have enough information to 
</p>
<p>perform it properly and does not know what is 
</p>
<p>expected of him or her (Rizzo, House, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Lirtzman, 1970). Such persons are obviously less 
</p>
<p>likely to feel competent (Cherniss, 1980).
</p>
<p>2 It is important to distinguish between structure (compe-
</p>
<p>tence support) and control. For an excellent discussion 
</p>
<p>and findings disentangling structure and control in educa-
</p>
<p>tion, see Jang et&nbsp;al. (2010).
</p>
<p>Box 3.1 Questions for Elaboration
</p>
<p>Think about a class in which the professor 
</p>
<p>is articulate, provides clear explanations, 
</p>
<p>and gives assignments that you can under-
</p>
<p>stand and follow. However, the professor 
</p>
<p>does not like to hear students&rsquo; comments 
</p>
<p>and seems impatient when you try to 
</p>
<p>express your opinion. When you see him/
</p>
<p>her on campus, it seems that he/she does 
</p>
<p>not recognize you and never greets you. 
</p>
<p>In SDT&rsquo;s conception, this professor seems 
</p>
<p>to support your sense of competence (pro-
</p>
<p>vides clear explanations and optimally 
</p>
<p>challenging assignments) but does not sup-
</p>
<p>port your sense of relatedness (ignores 
</p>
<p>you) or autonomy (suppresses your voice). 
</p>
<p>How do you evaluate your type of motiva-
</p>
<p>tion in this class (autonomous versus con-
</p>
<p>trolled)? Can you compare your experience 
</p>
<p>and motivation in this class to other classes 
</p>
<p>where the professor is more interested in 
</p>
<p>your personal opinion?

</p>
<p>Autonomous motivation requires a sense of 
</p>
<p>relatedness with others (Grolnick et&nbsp;al., 1997). 
</p>
<p>Feelings of belonging and connection 
</p>
<p>(Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995; Ryan &amp; Deci, 
</p>
<p>2000) are essential for motivations to become 
</p>
<p>integrated. Put otherwise, people need a &ldquo;secure 
</p>
<p>base&rdquo; with a significant other (Bowlby, 1979). If 
</p>
<p>parents, teachers, and employers seek behaviors 
</p>
<p>that are neither interesting nor enjoyable, indi-
</p>
<p>viduals may be more motivated to engage in 
</p>
<p>them if they have a relationship with a social 
</p>
<p>agent who is affectionate, caring, and connected 
</p>
<p>(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000). This type of environmen-
</p>
<p>tal support, often defined as interpersonal 
</p>
<p>involvement, requires the provision of warmth 
</p>
<p>and caring and an interest in the other person&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>activities. Ultimately, interpersonal involve-
</p>
<p>ment may predict the internalization of extrinsi-
</p>
<p>cally motivated behaviors (Grolnick et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>1997), a hypothesis substantiated by Ryan and 
</p>
<p>Grolnick (1986) who found that children who 
</p>
<p>felt more connected to and cared for by their 
</p>
<p>parents better internalized positive school-
</p>
<p>related activities.
</p>
<p>Autonomy is critical to internalization and 
</p>
<p>integration. In SDT, autonomy refers to &ldquo;endors-
</p>
<p>ing one&rsquo;s actions at the highest level of reflec-
</p>
<p>tion&rdquo; (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017). More simply stated, 
</p>
<p>the individual&rsquo;s behavioral engagement corre-
</p>
<p>sponds with his or her personal values, interests, 
</p>
<p>and needs. Thus, to integrate a behavior, the indi-
</p>
<p>vidual must grasp its meaning and synthesize that 
</p>
<p>meaning with the individual&rsquo;s other goals and 
</p>
<p>values.
</p>
<p>Therefore, competence and relatedness may 
</p>
<p>not suffice for autonomous motivation because 
</p>
<p>external contingencies (rewards and punishments) 
</p>
<p>may facilitate behavioral engagement based on 
</p>
<p>external regulation, as long as the individual feels 
</p>
<p>competent. Likewise, when a behavior or attitude 
</p>
<p>is endorsed by a social group to which one feels 
</p>
<p>related, one may enact the behavior because of a 
</p>
<p>desire to feel affiliated to the group and to enhance 
</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s self-esteem (an introjected rather than 
</p>
<p>autonomous regulation). However, only an envi-
</p>
<p>ronment based chiefly on autonomy support can 
</p>
<p>generate autonomous motivation and integration 
</p>
<p>by allowing the person to satisfy all three primary 
</p>
<p>psychological needs: competence, relatedness, 
</p>
<p>and autonomy.3
</p>
<p>Autonomy support refers to the following 
</p>
<p>behaviors by socializing agents: taking note of 
</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s perspectives (e.g., children, stu-
</p>
<p>dents, employees, and partners); performing 
</p>
<p>actions that foster choice, self-initiative, and par-
</p>
<p>ticipation in decision-making; supplying mean-
</p>
<p>ingful rationales and relevance; and abstaining 
</p>
<p>from language or actions that may be experienced 
</p>
<p>as a pressure to display a specific conduct. 
</p>
<p>Supporting autonomy in these ways has been 
</p>
<p>found to enhance children&rsquo;s intrinsic motivation, 
</p>
<p>facilitate well-internalized extrinsic motivation, 
</p>
<p>prompt the experience of autonomy and authen-
</p>
<p>ticity, and result in effective performance and psy-
</p>
<p>chological well-being (Reeve, 2006; Roth, 2008; 
</p>
<p>Vansteenkiste, Zhou, Lens, &amp; Soenens, 2005).
</p>
<p> Autonomous Motivation in&nbsp;Health 
Care and&nbsp;Education
</p>
<p>Given the empirical support for SDT proposi-
</p>
<p>tions on antecedents and outcomes of the various 
</p>
<p>types of motivation, it is not surprising that inter-
</p>
<p>ventions have been made to promote autonomous 
</p>
<p>3 Outside the realm of SDT, the concept of autonomy has 
</p>
<p>often been depicted as antagonistic to relatedness and as 
</p>
<p>equated with independence. However, the SDT definition 
</p>
<p>of autonomy is orthogonal to independence. An extensive 
</p>
<p>discussion of this topic may be found in Chirkov, Ryan, 
</p>
<p>and Sheldon (2011) and Chirkov (2009).

</p>
<p>motivations in many contexts, including educa-
</p>
<p>tion, work, and health care (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017). 
</p>
<p>For example, Williams, Niemiec, Patrick, Ryan, 
</p>
<p>and Deci (2009, 2016) conducted experimental 
</p>
<p>studies based on SDT to evaluate the effective-
</p>
<p>ness of an intensive tobacco dependence inter-
</p>
<p>vention intended to support autonomy and 
</p>
<p>perceived competence in facilitating long-term 
</p>
<p>tobacco abstinence. Adult smokers were 
</p>
<p>recruited into a randomized cessation induction 
</p>
<p>trial. The results revealed that smokers in the 
</p>
<p>intervention group were more likely to attain 
</p>
<p>tobacco  abstinence. Furthermore, these effects 
</p>
<p>were partially mediated by changes in both 
</p>
<p>autonomous motivation and perceived compe-
</p>
<p>tence over a period of 6 months. In the following 
</p>
<p>paragraphs, I&rsquo;ll describe an applied study in 
</p>
<p>more detail that explores implications of the the-
</p>
<p>ory for education.
</p>
<p>Students may make efforts at school based on 
</p>
<p>both controlled and autonomous motivation. 
</p>
<p>However, from the research reviewed so far, it is 
</p>
<p>clear that students whose motivation is controlled 
</p>
<p>may suffer poorer quality of learning, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, relying on memorization rather than deeper 
</p>
<p>cognitive processing (Vansteenkiste et&nbsp;al., 2010), 
</p>
<p>and poorer well-being. Furthermore, controlled 
</p>
<p>motivation, especially when characterized by 
</p>
<p>external regulation, is based on external supervi-
</p>
<p>sion of students&rsquo; behavior that is always limited 
</p>
<p>to a specific time and place. Briefly stated, SDT 
</p>
<p>has a unique implication for instruction. Under 
</p>
<p>SDT, the teacher hopes to get to the point where 
</p>
<p>psychological need satisfaction, rather than the 
</p>
<p>teacher himself/herself or any other external 
</p>
<p>contingency, drives the students&rsquo; activities in the 
</p>
<p>classroom.
</p>
<p>Cheon, Reeve, and Moon (2012) designed an 
</p>
<p>experimentally based teacher-focused intervention 
</p>
<p>to help physical education teachers be more auton-
</p>
<p>omy supportive of their students. Nineteen teach-
</p>
<p>ers participated in the intervention. Data were 
</p>
<p>collected from their 1158 middle and high school 
</p>
<p>students and from independent observers. The 
</p>
<p>teachers in the experimental group (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;10) partici-
</p>
<p>pated in a three-part intervention during the spring 
</p>
<p>semester (late February through mid- July), while 
</p>
<p>teachers in the control group (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;9) participated in 
</p>
<p>the intervention experience after the study ended. 
</p>
<p>The intervention meetings were moderated by an 
</p>
<p>SDT professional focusing on autonomy-support-
</p>
<p>ive teaching practices (nurturing students&rsquo; inner 
</p>
<p>motivational resources) in physical education 
</p>
<p>classes. Following SDT, the intervention was 
</p>
<p>focused on the following practices: (1) consider-
</p>
<p>ing the students&rsquo; perspective and incorporating 
</p>
<p>students&rsquo; input and suggestions into the day&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>instructions; (2) relying on noncontrolling lan-
</p>
<p>guage by communicating in ways conveying 
</p>
<p>flexibility (e.g., offering information on options) 
</p>
<p>and minimizing pressure; (3) providing explana-
</p>
<p>tory rationales to help students comprehend why a 
</p>
<p>specific request or activity has a personal value; 
</p>
<p>and (4) acknowledging negative affect in general 
</p>
<p>and also as elicited by the teachers&rsquo; expectations 
</p>
<p>and/or by the learning process. The first meeting 
</p>
<p>was a 3-hour workshop on the nature of auton-
</p>
<p>omy support. A second 2-hour meeting took 
</p>
<p>place 6 weeks later; it focused on the teachers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>autonomy-supportive practices since the begin-
</p>
<p>ning of the semester. More specifically, the 
</p>
<p>teachers discussed advantages and pitfalls based 
</p>
<p>on their personal experiences. Part three took place 
</p>
<p>6 weeks later; at this session, teachers shared ideas 
</p>
<p>about how to be autonomy supportive in physical 
</p>
<p>education classes. Teachers in the experimental 
</p>
<p>group completed two additional booster reflective 
</p>
<p>activities between meetings.
</p>
<p>Data were collected from students at three time 
</p>
<p>points, at the beginning of the semester (after the 
</p>
<p>first teachers&rsquo; meeting), in the middle (after the 
</p>
<p>second teachers&rsquo; meeting), and again when the 
</p>
<p>semester had ended. The students completed 11 
</p>
<p>dependent measures. Two served as manipulation 
</p>
<p>checks and nine served as students&rsquo; outcomes: 
</p>
<p>three measures were the satisfaction of the needs 
</p>
<p>for relatedness, competence, and autonomy, in 
</p>
<p>addition to amotivation, autonomous motivation, 
</p>
<p>classroom engagement, perceived skill develop-
</p>
<p>ment, future intentions with respect to physical 
</p>
<p>activity, and class achievements. In addition to 
</p>
<p>students&rsquo; self-reports, the autonomy-supportive 
</p>
<p>teaching was measured by professional raters 
</p>
<p>who visited the classrooms after the second 
</p>
<p>teachers&rsquo; meeting (equivalent to the students&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>time two measurements) and provided scores 
</p>

</p>
<p>based on a rating sheet developed and validated 
</p>
<p>by Reeve, Jang, Carrell, Jeon, and Barch (2004). 
</p>
<p>Two raters, who were blind to the teachers&rsquo; exper-
</p>
<p>imental assignments, rated each teacher. The two 
</p>
<p>observers&rsquo; ratings were highly positively corre-
</p>
<p>lated on each instructional behavior, allowing the 
</p>
<p>researchers to average the two ratings into a single 
</p>
<p>score for each of the four autonomy-supportive 
</p>
<p>instructional behaviors.
</p>
<p>Manipulation checks based on student reports 
</p>
<p>and observations revealed that the teachers in the 
</p>
<p>experimental group were more autonomy sup-
</p>
<p>portive than the teachers in the control group. 
</p>
<p>Since data were collected from students over 
</p>
<p>time, the researchers were able to analyze the 
</p>
<p>differences between groups over time. Although 
</p>
<p>the condition main effect was significant, the 
</p>
<p>two conditions (teachers in experimental group 
</p>
<p>vs teachers in the control group) did not differ at 
</p>
<p>the baseline (i.e., at the start). As expected, the 
</p>
<p>condition X time interaction was significant; by 
</p>
<p>that I mean perceived autonomy support 
</p>
<p>increased significantly for the students of the 
</p>
<p>teachers in the experimental group from the first 
</p>
<p>to the second measurement and again from the 
</p>
<p>second to the third measurement, but it decreased 
</p>
<p>significantly for the students of the teachers in 
</p>
<p>the control group.
</p>
<p>The results of the outcome measures follow 
</p>
<p>SDT predictions. Namely, the three measures for 
</p>
<p>psychological need satisfaction revealed a main 
</p>
<p>effect for condition (control group/experimental 
</p>
<p>group), indicating that the students of teachers in 
</p>
<p>the experimental group reported higher need sat-
</p>
<p>isfaction than students of teachers in the control 
</p>
<p>condition. The interaction of condition and time 
</p>
<p>was also significant for the three measures of the 
</p>
<p>three needs indicating that at the start, there were 
</p>
<p>no differences between groups, but over time, the 
</p>
<p>students of teachers in the experimental group 
</p>
<p>reported higher need satisfaction. The results 
</p>
<p>were similar for student reports of their autono-
</p>
<p>mous motivation, class engagement, skill devel-
</p>
<p>opment, future intentions, and for course 
</p>
<p>achievement. Thus, students of the teachers in 
</p>
<p>the experimental group showed meaningful gains 
</p>
<p>in all six course-related outcomes that were 
</p>
<p>assessed. Additional analysis revealed that the 
</p>
<p>relation between condition and the six outcomes 
</p>
<p>was mediated by a composite score of the three 
</p>
<p>need satisfactions. These mediation paths were 
</p>
<p>supported while controlling for the initial level 
</p>
<p>of each outcome measure (i.e., controlling for 
</p>
<p>the measurement at the baseline) and while 
</p>
<p>controlling for gender and grade level.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, Cheon and Reeve (2013) col-
</p>
<p>lected a follow-up dataset to determine whether 
</p>
<p>those earlier observed benefits endured 1 year 
</p>
<p>later. Compared to teachers in the control group, 
</p>
<p>teachers in the experimental group were more 
</p>
<p>autonomy supportive and less controlling based 
</p>
<p>on independent observations and on the percep-
</p>
<p>tions of their students. Furthermore, their stu-
</p>
<p>dents consistently reported greater autonomous 
</p>
<p>motivation and more positive outcomes than did 
</p>
<p>the students of teachers in the control group.
</p>
<p>In sum, this research suggests the effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of an SDT-based teacher-training intervention 
</p>
<p>program and demonstrates its effectiveness for 
</p>
<p>students&rsquo; autonomous motivation, achievements, 
</p>
<p>engagement, and skill development.
</p>
<p> Concluding Remark
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the example that opened this chap-
</p>
<p>ter. I asked you to think of three quite different 
</p>
<p>classes. You were enthusiastic and eager in one, 
</p>
<p>anxious and stressed in the second, and bored 
</p>
<p>maybe even irritated in the third. Perhaps the sec-
</p>
<p>ond and third professors had no idea how you were 
</p>
<p>reacting. While the first professor either had good 
</p>
<p>instincts or good training (or both), the others may 
</p>
<p>have benefitted from knowledge of SDT.&nbsp;Or per-
</p>
<p>haps you might have been able to do something? 
</p>
<p>As a final remark, I would like to introduce Reeve&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>(2013) conceptualization of students&rsquo; agentic 
</p>
<p>engagement. It refers to the extent of students&rsquo; con-
</p>
<p>structive contribution to the flow of the instruction 
</p>
<p>in terms of asking questions, expressing prefer-
</p>
<p>ences, and letting the teacher know what they want 
</p>
<p>and need. According to Reeve, agentic engagement 
</p>
<p>is an active way by which students may help their 
</p>
<p>instructors become more autonomy supportive in 
</p>
<p>their teaching. You may find more information on 
</p>
<p>this new concept in Reeve&rsquo;s work.

</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; SDT goes beyond simply analyzing how 
</p>
<p>the quantity of motivation affects behav-
</p>
<p>ior to take a closer look at how the type 
</p>
<p>(i.e., quality) of motivation matters.
</p>
<p>&bull; The main distinction is between autono-
</p>
<p>mous motivation and controlled motiva-
</p>
<p>tion. Although the strength of motivation 
</p>
<p>may be high whether it is autonomous 
</p>
<p>or controlled, the former is related to 
</p>
<p>adaptive behavior and well-being, and 
</p>
<p>the latter is related to maladaptive 
</p>
<p>behavior and ill-being.
</p>
<p>&bull; SDT&rsquo;s discussions of the contextual 
</p>
<p>antecedents of autonomous and con-
</p>
<p>trolled motivation opened the door for 
</p>
<p>research on factors that may predict 
</p>
<p>autonomous motivation in many differ-
</p>
<p>ent contexts, from sports to education 
</p>
<p>and health care. This research, in turn, 
</p>
<p>has triggered interventions in all of these 
</p>
<p>varied fields.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>When working on a task such as an assignment 
</p>
<p>for a class, there are at least two internal rewards 
</p>
<p>that might motivate students. First, the topic or 
</p>
<p>theme might fit their personal preferences. They 
</p>
<p>may, for example, be fascinated by the subject, 
</p>
<p>value high achievement in the academic domain, 
</p>
<p>or feel obliged to make their utmost effort. In 
</p>
<p>this case, motivation results from individuals&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>preferences regarding content&nbsp; &ndash; their interests, 
</p>
<p>needs, or motives. Psychological research has 
</p>
<p>long focused on this level of analysis of motiva-
</p>
<p>tion, and there is substantial evidence that needs 
</p>
<p>and motives are powerful predictors of human 
</p>
<p>behavior (Heckhausen &amp; Heckhausen, 2008; 
</p>
<p>Roth, Chap. 3).
</p>
<p>A second type of reward, suggested more 
</p>
<p>recently in the scientific literature on motivation, 
</p>
<p>concerns the type of task involved in achieving a 
</p>
<p>goal. According to this view, certain types of tasks 
</p>
<p>are themselves more motivating for some than oth-
</p>
<p>ers. An assignment regarding the same content can, 
</p>
<p>for instance, require to read a text and to write an 
</p>
<p>essay either summarizing the key information from 
</p>
<p>the text or outlining the applied implication of the 
</p>
<p>text content. The former focusses on thorough 
</p>
<p>reading and error free rewording of the content, 
</p>
<p>whereas the latter likewise requires thorough read-
</p>
<p>ing but also some creativity to connect the readings 
</p>
<p>to an applied context. Likewise, to pass a pending

<p>exam, some students might opt for a &ldquo;cramming&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>method and learn all the material in a couple of 
</p>
<p>days before the exam, whereas others are more 
</p>
<p>comfortable gradually learning the material in a 
</p>
<p>step-by-step manner.
</p>
<p>As these examples illustrate, the means or 
</p>
<p>behaviors applied to complete a task or achieve a 
</p>
<p>goal can differ. Research on self-regulation sug-
</p>
<p>gests that some of these so-called self-regulation 
</p>
<p>strategies will be more motivating than others 
</p>
<p>under specific circumstances. We define self- 
</p>
<p>regulation as the volitional (will-based) and cog-
</p>
<p>nitive processes individuals apply to reach 
</p>
<p>desired states including goal striving and need 
</p>
<p>fulfillment (Sassenberg &amp; Woltin, 2008).
</p>
<p>This chapter will summarize and provide an 
</p>
<p>introduction to self-regulation. First, we will 
</p>
<p>describe how self-regulation and self-regulation 
</p>
<p>strategies are related to motives and other moti-
</p>
<p>vational concepts. Second, self-regulation strate-
</p>
<p>gies, their antecedents, and their consequences 
</p>
<p>will be presented&nbsp;&ndash; with a particular focus on the 
</p>
<p>motivational effects derived from the fit between 
</p>
<p>individuals&rsquo; self-regulation strategies and envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental demands. Finally, we will summarize 
</p>
<p>research demonstrating how this regulatory fit 
</p>
<p>can help to solve people&rsquo;s motivational problems 
</p>
<p>in applied settings, ending the chapter with a 
</p>
<p>discussion of a field study in the context of health 
</p>
<p>behavior (i.e., physical exercise).
</p>
<p> The Motivational Hierarchy: 
Motives, Goals, and&nbsp;Strategies
</p>
<p>One important differentiation in research on the 
</p>
<p>psychology of motivation concerns the difference 
</p>
<p>between needs and motives on the one hand and 
</p>
<p>goals on the other hand. Needs and motives are 
</p>
<p>individual preferences for types of incentives 
</p>
<p>(e.g., social contact in case of the affiliation 
</p>
<p>motive). Motives refer more to the (rather cogni-
</p>
<p>tive) preferences, while the term needs stresses 
</p>
<p>the biological or otherwise essential basis 
</p>
<p>(Heckhausen &amp; Heckhausen, 2008). Goals are 
</p>
<p>defined as desired end states (Austin &amp; Vancouver, 
</p>
<p>1996). They, thus, specify the preference for one 
</p>
<p>specific event or incentive. Along these lines, 
</p>
<p>going out for drinks or parties to meet people can 
</p>
<p>be a goal, but the reason &ldquo;behind&rdquo; this behavior 
</p>
<p>would stem from a motive to affiliate with others. 
</p>
<p>In other words, goals refer to certain, tangible, 
</p>
<p>events, whereas motives describe a person&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>general preference.
</p>
<p>Psychological research distinguishes between 
</p>
<p>several different motives, such as the achieve-
</p>
<p>ment, the affiliation, and the power motive. All 
</p>
<p>these motives are generally classes of incentives, 
</p>
<p>with the general aim to maximize satisfaction of 
</p>
<p>some kind. Different motives may predominate as 
</p>
<p>a result of individual or situational characteristics, 
</p>
<p>leading to different goals and behaviors. For 
</p>
<p>example, someone with an achievement motive 
</p>
<p>will likely have goals such as obtaining a high 
</p>
<p>grade, winning a game of sports, or excelling in 
</p>
<p>their profession. Someone with an affiliation 
</p>
<p>motive will likely have goals such as working 
</p>
<p>together on assignments, playing team sports, or 
</p>
<p>getting along well with their colleagues. The dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between goals and motives illustrates that 
</p>
<p>motives are more abstract than goals, with goals 
</p>
<p>being subordinate to motives (see Fig.&nbsp;4.1).
</p>
<p>Achieving certain goals will also serve the 
</p>
<p>motive the goal is derived from. Self-regulation

</p>
<p>applied during goal achievement&nbsp; &ndash; for instance, 
</p>
<p>the strategies to improve gradually or to put all 
</p>
<p>energy for a short period into a subject (i.e., 
</p>
<p>cramming) are different strategies that could 
</p>
<p>serve the goal to perform well in an exam. Self- 
</p>
<p>regulation strategies are, thus, again more spe-
</p>
<p>cific than and subordinate to goals. As alluded to 
</p>
<p>earlier, research on motivation has traditionally 
</p>
<p>focused on the two more abstract levels of this 
</p>
<p>hierarchy&nbsp;&ndash; needs/motives and goals. In contrast, 
</p>
<p>the strategies people use during goal striving 
</p>
<p>received limited attention (Heckhausen &amp; 
</p>
<p>Heckhausen, 2008), because researchers were 
</p>
<p>lacking an approach to treat the fast amount of dif-
</p>
<p>ferent means and behaviors that can be applied to 
</p>
<p>reach a goal in a way that made them accessible to 
</p>
<p>scientific analysis (Brendl &amp; Higgins, 1996).
</p>
<p>The breakthrough in this respect was achieved 
</p>
<p>when Tory Higgins (1997, 1998) formulated his 
</p>
<p>idea of self-regulation strategies. The theories 
</p>
<p>developed around self-regulation strategies do 
</p>
<p>not only summarize means and behaviors, but 
</p>
<p>they specify the antecedents and consequences of 
</p>
<p>these categories of means and behaviors. These 
</p>
<p>causal chains from preconditions via strategies 
</p>
<p>(or categories of means and behaviors) allow for 
</p>
<p>scientific analysis and for predictions in research 
</p>
<p>on self-regulation.
</p>
<p> Self-Regulation Strategies
</p>
<p> Regulatory Focus
</p>
<p>Regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1998) distin-
</p>
<p>guishes between two independent motivational 
</p>
<p>systems: the promotion and the prevention system. 
</p>
<p>When the promotion system is predominantly 
</p>
<p>active&nbsp;&ndash; in a so-called promotion focus&nbsp;&ndash; individu-
</p>
<p>als are concerned with &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; states, reflected in 
</p>
<p>a sense of hope and aspiration. Promotion-
</p>
<p>focused individuals strive eagerly to achieve their 
</p>
<p>goals. In other words, individuals in a promotion 
</p>
<p>focus are in a &ldquo;go for it&rdquo; mode. Their predisposi-
</p>
<p>tion is to act (ensuring against errors of omis-
</p>
<p>sion). They try not to miss any opportunity and 
</p>
<p>apply risky strategies, which makes them more 
</p>
<p>likely to show behaviors that do not necessarily 
</p>
<p>contribute to goal achievement (e.g., using the 
</p>
<p>first but not necessarily best opportunity to make 
</p>
<p>steps toward goal achievement). In general, indi-
</p>
<p>viduals in a promotion focus are concerned with 
</p>
<p>the presence or absence of positive outcomes: 
</p>
<p>they strive for promotion success (gains) and try 
</p>
<p>to avoid promotion failure (non-gains).
</p>
<p>In contrast, prevention-focused individuals are 
</p>
<p>more concerned with &ldquo;ought&rdquo; states, reflected in a 
</p>
<p>sense of existing duties and obligations. They are 
</p>
<p>highly vigilant during goal striving, try to avoid 
</p>
<p>errors, and apply defensive strategies (e.g., show 
</p>
<p>behaviors that almost definitely contribute to goal 
</p>
<p>achievement). They rather refrain from taking 
</p>
<p>action than risk making a mistake (ensuring 
</p>
<p>against errors of commission) and are &ldquo;better safe 
</p>
<p>than sorry,&rdquo; careful in their approach even if this 
</p>
<p>seems difficult or unnecessary. In a prevention 
</p>
<p>focus, individuals are concerned with the presence 
</p>
<p>or absence of negative outcomes: they strive for 
</p>
<p>prevention success (non-loss) and try to avoid pre-
</p>
<p>vention failure (loss) (Table&nbsp;4.1).
</p>
<p>A promotion focus is activated, when individu-
</p>
<p>als situationally pursue their ideals and when they 
</p>
<p>see opportunities to gain something, whereas a 
</p>
<p>prevention focus is activated when individuals are 
</p>
<p>guided by obligations and when they are aware of 
</p>
<p>potential losses (Fig. 4.2). Students can, for 
</p>
<p>instance, strive to write an A in an exam. This goal 
</p>
<p>can be pursued in a promotion or in a prevention 
</p>
<p>focus. A promotion focus would be likely when 
</p>
<p>the student sees the opportunity to write an A 
</p>
<p>because she feels particularly competent regard-
</p>
<p>ing the content; she might see the exam as a situ-
</p>
<p>ation in which she can gain a good grade. This 
</p>
<p>student would start out optimistically and write 
</p>
<p>down everything that comes to mind. In contrast, 
</p>
<p>a student might be in a prevention focus, because 
</p>
<p>she definitely needs the A to, for example, be eli-

<p>Box 4.1 Zooming In: Regulatory Focus vs. 
</p>
<p>Approach and Avoidance
</p>
<p>For a more thorough understanding, it is 
</p>
<p>important to distinguish between promotion 
</p>
<p>vs. prevention focus and approach vs. avoid-
</p>
<p>ance, respectively. Approach and avoidance 
</p>
<p>distinguish whether an individual primarily 
</p>
<p>focuses on approaching something subjec-
</p>
<p>tively good or avoiding something bad. A 
</p>
<p>student could, for instance, study with a 
</p>
<p>focus on passing an exam or with a focus on 
</p>
<p>not failing an exam. Approach and avoidance 
</p>
<p>are closely related to the promotion and pre-
</p>
<p>vention focus, respectively, but there are 
</p>
<p>important differences. On the one hand, the 
</p>
<p>eager striving and the focus on gains in a 
</p>
<p>promotion focus imply approaching some-
</p>
<p>thing good, whereas the vigilance and the 
</p>
<p>focus on losses suggest that avoidance will 
</p>
<p>be dominant (Shah, Brazy, &amp; Higgins, 2004). 
</p>
<p>However, promotion is not only about 
</p>
<p>approaching gains but also about avoiding 
</p>
<p>non-gains (not getting an A), and prevention 
</p>
<p>is about avoiding losses and approaching 
</p>
<p>non-losses (getting an A). A sports team can, 
</p>
<p>for instance, eagerly strive (a promotion 
</p>
<p>strategy) not to lose a game  (avoiding a nega-
</p>
<p>tive outcome), for example, because this will 
</p>
<p>warrant them the points they need to qualify 
</p>
<p>for the play-offs. As this example illustrates, 
</p>
<p>regulatory focus and approach/avoidance 
</p>
<p>behaviors are not necessarily compatible 
</p>
<p>such that a promotion focus is always related 
</p>
<p>to approach behavior and prevention is 
</p>
<p>always related to avoidance behavior.

<p>55
</p>
<p>As this example illustrates, the two foci may 
</p>
<p>vary situationally and may be temporarily acti-
</p>
<p>vated using gain or loss framing. Because many 
</p>
<p>tasks and goals can be framed in either positive 
</p>
<p>(gain) or negative (loss) frames, researchers and 
</p>
<p>practitioners can differentially induce the foci 
</p>
<p>with relative ease. For example, a health message 
</p>
<p>framing regular exercise as a good way to pro-
</p>
<p>mote your health is likely to activate a promotion 
</p>
<p>focus. In contrast, a health message framing reg-
</p>
<p>ular exercise as a good way to prevent disease is 
</p>
<p>likely to activate a prevention focus. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>shops can charge a fee (loss) or give a discount 
</p>
<p>(gain) when paying with credit card or cash, 
</p>
<p>respectively (Idson, Liberman, &amp; Higgins, 2000). 
</p>
<p>Aside from reading messages framed in gain/
</p>
<p>non-gain or loss/non-loss terms, experimental 
</p>
<p>studies have also successfully used tasks such 
</p>
<p>as reflecting on past experiences, describing 
</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s own aspirations (promotion) or obliga-
</p>
<p>tions (prevention) and essay writing to induce 
</p>
<p>the different foci.
</p>
<p>The two foci may vary situationally, but also 
</p>
<p>chronically. On a chronic level, a bolstering par-
</p>
<p>enting style reassuring children that they can 
</p>
<p>achieve a lot is, for example, correlated with 
</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s promotion focus. In contrast, a critical 
</p>
<p>and punitive parenting style focusing on obliga-
</p>
<p>tions, safety, and rules predicts children&rsquo;s pre-
</p>
<p>vention focus (Keller, 2007). Culture has also 
</p>
<p>been found to be an important factor in shaping 
</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s regulatory focus (e.g., Lee, Aaker, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Gardner, 2000; Uskul, Sherman, &amp; Fitzgibbon, 
</p>
<p>2009). For example, a promotion focus is more 
</p>
<p>prevalent in Western societies, which tend to 
</p>
<p>emphasize individual uniqueness and aspirations 
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;be the best&rdquo; and stand out from the crowd. 
</p>
<p>In contrast, a prevention focus is more prevalent 
</p>
<p>among East Asian societies (e.g., Chinese, 
</p>
<p>Japanese), which tend to emphasize interdepen-
</p>
<p>dence, group harmony, and a sense of obligation 
</p>
<p>(Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991).
</p>
<p>Although both foci may vary as a function of 
</p>
<p>situational or chronic pressures, they are not 
</p>
<p>opposites on one dimension. Theoretically, both 
</p>
<p>foci constitute independent dimensions implying 
</p>
<p>that how frequently an individual pursues goals 
</p>
<p>in a promotion focus does not predict how 
</p>
<p>frequently the same person pursues goals in a 
</p>
<p>prevention focus (Higgins, 1997). In most mea-
</p>
<p>sures of promotion and prevention focus (see 
</p>
<p>Table&nbsp;4.2 for an overview), the two scales are if 
</p>
<p>anything slightly positively correlated (Higgins 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2001; Sassenberg et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p> The Effect of&nbsp;Promotion 
Versus&nbsp;Prevention Focus
</p>
<p>Research has shown a broad range of conse-
</p>
<p>quences of both foci in terms of people&rsquo;s motiva-
</p>
<p>tion to complete a task and the emotions they 
</p>
<p>experience as a result of failing or succeeding in 
</p>
<p>achieving their goals. The effects described in 
</p>
<p>what follows stem from research that either

<p>4 Self-Regulation Strategies and&nbsp;Regulatory Fit</p>

</p>
<p>compared an experimentally induced promotion 
</p>
<p>to an experimentally induced prevention focus or 
</p>
<p>correlated assessed chronic promotion and pre-
</p>
<p>vention focus with the respective outcome mea-
</p>
<p>sures or both.
</p>
<p>First of all, individuals show different emo-
</p>
<p>tions in response to success and failure depend-
</p>
<p>ing on their regulatory focus. The scientific 
</p>
<p>analysis of emotions typically identifies two 
</p>
<p>dimensions of core affect (activation and pleas-
</p>
<p>antness; Russell &amp; Barrett, 1999) along which 
</p>
<p>specific emotions may vary. Pleasantness refers 
</p>
<p>to the subjective experience of &ldquo;doing well.&rdquo; It 
</p>
<p>summarizes the experience of something being 
</p>
<p>good or bad, positive or negative, or pleasant and 
</p>
<p>unpleasant. Activation refers to the subjective 
</p>
<p>sense of mobilization or energy. It summarizes 
</p>
<p>the experience of one&rsquo;s physiological state and 
</p>
<p>may range from anywhere between sleepiness, 
</p>
<p>lethargy, relaxation, attentiveness, activation, 
</p>
<p>hyperactivation, and frenetic excitement.
</p>
<p>In a promotion focus, self-regulation success 
</p>
<p>(gains) leads to positive activating emotions 
</p>
<p>(i.e., cheerful emotions such as happiness or 
</p>
<p>pride), whereas self-regulation failure (non-
</p>
<p>gains) leads to negative emotions with low acti-
</p>
<p>vation (i.e., dejected emotions such as sadness 
</p>
<p>or shame). In a prevention focus, self-regula-
</p>
<p>tion success (non- losses) leads to positive emo-
</p>
<p>tions with low activation (i.e., quiescence as in 
</p>
<p>a state of relief or relaxation), whereas self-
</p>
<p>regulation failure (losses) leads to negative acti-
</p>
<p>vating emotions (i.e., agitation as in case of 
</p>
<p>feeling upset or worried; Higgins, Shah, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Friedman, 1997).
</p>
<p>This implies that individuals in a promotion 
</p>
<p>focus are more activated by success (or gains) 
</p>
<p>and other positive stimuli such as positive role 
</p>
<p>models. Hence, they will celebrate their suc-
</p>
<p>cesses more and be more motivated to follow the 
</p>
<p>example of others who succeeded. However, 
</p>
<p>individuals in a prevention focus are easier acti-
</p>
<p>vated by failure (or losses) and other negative 
</p>
<p>stimuli such as negative role models. In other 
</p>
<p>words, these people will be motivated when they 
</p>
<p>anticipate or face problems or when they see oth-
</p>
<p>ers who failed or were harmed (Idson et&nbsp;al., 2000; 
</p>
<p>Lockwood, Jordan, &amp; Kunda, 2002; Sassenberg 
</p>
<p>&amp; Hansen, 2007).
</p>
<p>Another affective consequence of regulatory 
</p>
<p>focus concerns the sense of optimism that people 
</p>
<p>have during goal striving. Because people in a 
</p>
<p>promotion focus have an easier time to see 
</p>
<p>options to act, they are often more optimistic 
</p>
<p>about their chances of success than people in a 
</p>
<p>prevention focus. For the same reason, 
</p>
<p>promotion- focused individuals tend to be more 
</p>
<p>open to change, whereas prevention-focused 
</p>
<p>individuals have a preference for stability (Grant &amp; 
</p>
<p>Higgins, 2003; Liberman, Idson, Camacho, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Higgins, 1999).
</p>
<p>Beside these affective consequences, there are 
</p>
<p>also a number of cognitive consequences of the 
</p>
<p>two foci. A promotion focus leads to better cre-
</p>
<p>ative performance and more global or abstract 
</p>
<p>thinking, whereas a prevention focus leads to 
</p>
<p>better analytic performance and a more detailed 
</p>
<p>or local processing style of information (Friedman 
</p>
<p>&amp; F&ouml;rster, 2005; Seibt &amp; F&ouml;rster, 2004). Therefore, 
</p>
<p>in the student assignment example at the start of 
</p>
<p>this chapter, a student in a promotion focus is 
</p>
<p>likely to perform better in case the assignment 
</p>
<p>requires creativity, whereas a student in the pre-
</p>
<p>vention focus is more likely to perform better 
</p>
<p>when the assignment requires a thorough ana-
</p>
<p>lytic, step-by-step approach.
</p>
<p>Implications of regulatory focus have been 
</p>
<p>found in many other domains. Promotion (com-
</p>
<p>pared to prevention)-focused individuals are 
</p>
<p>better able to imagine others&rsquo; perspective and 
</p>
<p>recognizing others&rsquo; emotions (Sassenrath, 
</p>
<p>Sassenberg, Ray, Scheiter, &amp; Jarodzka, 2014). 
</p>
<p>They are also more successful in negotiations 
</p>
<p>(Galinsky, Leonardelli, Okhuysen, &amp; Mussweiler, 
</p>
<p>2005). The defensive strategy of prevention- 
</p>
<p>focused individuals on the one hand facilitates 
</p>
<p>their analytic performance but on the other hand 
</p>
<p>makes them more prone to all sorts of 
</p>
<p> conservative biases; they stick more to their own 
</p>
<p>decisions and show a stronger confirmation bias 
</p>
<p>(i.e., see information supporting their own opin-
</p>
<p>ion as more relevant than information contra-
</p>
<p>dicting it; Molden &amp; Hui, 2011; Sassenberg, 
</p>
<p>Landkammer, &amp; Jacoby, 2014).

</p>
<p>Regulatory focus is a well-studied self- 
</p>
<p>regulation strategy which asserts an influence on 
</p>
<p>emotion, cognition, and behavior in multiple ways. 
</p>
<p>There are a number of other self-regulation strate-
</p>
<p>gies that are not yet that well understood, because 
</p>
<p>research has dedicated much less attention to them. 
</p>
<p>Box 4.3 presents one of these examples.
</p>
<p> Increasing Motivation 
Through&nbsp;Regulatory Fit
</p>
<p>Regulatory fit is the match between a person&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>self-regulation strategy&nbsp; &ndash; being it regulatory 
</p>
<p>focus, regulatory mode, approach/avoidance ori-
</p>
<p>entation, or something else&nbsp; &ndash; and the strategy 
</p>
<p>they choose or have to apply to achieve a certain 
</p>
<p>goal. Regulatory fit is high, if the preference and 
</p>
<p>the affordances regarding self-regulation are 
</p>
<p>matched and low if they are not. If, for example, 
</p>
<p>a person in a prevention focus can thoroughly 
</p>
<p>weigh the alternatives, this will be experienced as 
</p>
<p>regulatory fit. A pressing deadline may prevent 
</p>
<p>prevention-focused individuals from using such 
</p>
<p>an analytic, step-by-step approach but may suit 
</p>
<p>promotion-focused individuals better. If they can 
</p>
<p>intuitively chose an alternative, this should be 
</p>
<p>experienced as regulatory fit.
</p>
<p>According to the theory of regulatory fit 
</p>
<p>(Higgins, 2000), stronger regulatory fit leads to a 
</p>
<p>positive experience (i.e., it enhances the percep-
</p>
<p>tion of the value of what people are doing). As a 
</p>
<p>result, their behavior is experienced as more 
</p>
<p>Box 4.2 Questions for Elaboration
</p>
<p>Individuals differ chronically in their regu-
</p>
<p>latory focus. Think about jobs for which a 
</p>
<p>promotion focus and a prevention focus 
</p>
<p>would be particularly profitable. Why?
</p>
<p>Imagine you would like to move to a new 
</p>
<p>flat with the help of some friends. Which 
</p>
<p>tasks would you allocate to promotion- 
</p>
<p>focused individuals and which to preven-
</p>
<p>tion-focused individuals and why?
</p>
<p>Box 4.3 Zooming In: Regulatory Mode
</p>
<p>To reach a goal, two types of actions are 
</p>
<p>essential: making steps toward the goal and 
</p>
<p>evaluating the current state and potential 
</p>
<p>further steps. Regulatory mode theory 
</p>
<p>(Kruglanski et&nbsp; al., 2000) distinguishes the 
</p>
<p>motivational states in which these actions 
</p>
<p>are dominant in&nbsp;locomotion and assessment 
</p>
<p>mode. In a locomotion mode, individuals 
</p>
<p>feel the urgent need to act and get on. They 
</p>
<p>are impatient with barriers, delays, etc. and 
</p>
<p>embrace each opportunity for change and 
</p>
<p>breaking the status quo. Locomotors are, for 
</p>
<p>instance, open for organizational chance 
</p>
<p>(Kruglanski, Pierro, Higgins, &amp; Capozza, 
</p>
<p>2007). Locomotors are doers.
</p>
<p>In an assessment mode, in contrast, 
</p>
<p>individuals are more reflective. They have 
</p>
<p>a desire for perfectionism, fear errors, and 
</p>
<p>are worried about missing out opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties. To this end, individuals make compar-
</p>
<p>isons and mentally simulate the outcomes 
</p>
<p>of potential actions. As an outcome, 
</p>
<p>assessors experience more regret in case of 
</p>
<p>negative outcomes (e.g., a bad grade). 
</p>
<p>Assessors are thinkers. More generally, 
</p>
<p>assessment mode is positively associated 
</p>
<p>with negative affect and depressive mood 
</p>
<p>and negatively associated with subjective 
</p>
<p>well- being, whereas locomotion is nega-
</p>
<p>tively correlated with depressive mood 
</p>
<p>and positively associated with positive 
</p>
<p>mood and subjective well-being (Higgins, 
</p>
<p>Kruglanski, &amp; Pierro, 2003).

</p>
<p> pleasurable, and individuals will thus engage 
</p>
<p>more in it (i.e., stronger persistence and more 
</p>
<p>effort). Individuals with a strong promotion focus 
</p>
<p>will, for instance, feel more attracted to choices 
</p>
<p>they made after considering positive outcomes of 
</p>
<p>several alternatives, whereas individuals in a pre-
</p>
<p>vention focus feel more attracted by choices they 
</p>
<p>made after considering potential negative out-
</p>
<p>comes (Idson, Liberman, &amp; Higgins, 2004). This 
</p>
<p>is because individuals in a promotion focus care 
</p>
<p>more about gains (and non-gains), whereas indi-
</p>
<p>viduals in a prevention focus care more about 
</p>
<p>losses (and non-losses).
</p>
<p>Moreover, individuals, objects, and social 
</p>
<p>targets related to behavior high in regulatory fit 
</p>
<p>will be evaluated more positively. For example, 
</p>
<p>individuals with a prevention focus are attracted 
</p>
<p>more by low power (e.g., jobs not involving 
</p>
<p>control over other people&rsquo;s situations) than 
</p>
<p>individual in a promotion focus, because ste-
</p>
<p>reotypically low-power groups demand their 
</p>
<p>members to defend their safety and security 
</p>
<p>(against those high in power). However, indi-
</p>
<p>viduals in a promotion focus have a stronger 
</p>
<p>preference for high power (e.g., jobs involving a 
</p>
<p>lot of control over other people&rsquo;s situation) com-
</p>
<p>pared to those in a prevention focus, because 
</p>
<p>groups high in power according to common ste-
</p>
<p>reotypes provide the room to apply promotion 
</p>
<p>strategies (e.g., be creative and try out new things, 
</p>
<p>think globally, etc.; Sassenberg, Jonas, Shah, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Brazy, 2007).
</p>
<p>The regulatory fit hypothesis, thus, describes 
</p>
<p>a source of valence (i.e., positive evaluation) 
</p>
<p>and motivation, which does not result from the 
</p>
<p>fact that the behavior fits one&rsquo;s needs or motives. 
</p>
<p>In contrast, it suggests that motivation can also 
</p>
<p>result from a fit between strategy preferences and 
</p>
<p>behavioral opportunities. A recent meta-analysis 
</p>
<p>(Motyka et&nbsp;al., 2014) has shown that regulatory 
</p>
<p>fit effects regarding evaluation, behavioral inten-
</p>
<p>tion, and behavior are medium in size (r about 
</p>
<p>0.3). They thus seem to contribute substantially 
</p>
<p>to individuals&rsquo; motivation and choice of action. 
</p>
<p>In the following paragraph, we will illustrate 
</p>
<p>the applied relevance and external validity of 
</p>
<p>regulatory fit effects.
</p>
<p> Regulatory Fit in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Wild
</p>
<p>Evidence for regulatory fit effects has been found 
</p>
<p>in a number of applied fields, most notably in 
</p>
<p>organizational settings, consumer behavior, 
</p>
<p>health behavior, and sports performance. In this 
</p>
<p>section, we will briefly summarize this work, 
</p>
<p>before elaborating on a specific study in the con-
</p>
<p>text of health behavior.
</p>
<p>In consumer research, a large body of studies 
</p>
<p>have tested regulatory fit effects. One main find-
</p>
<p>ing of this literature is that regulatory fit between 
</p>
<p>consumers&rsquo; regulatory focus and brand charac-
</p>
<p>teristics leads to more positive evaluation of 
</p>
<p>brands (for an overview, see Motyka et&nbsp;al., 2014). 
</p>
<p>Florack and Scarabis (2006; Study 1), for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, studied preferences for a promotion or pre-
</p>
<p>vention advertisement message for sun lotions. 
</p>
<p>Because sun lotion is generally bought for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of preventing skin damage or disease, 
</p>
<p>prevention-focused messages (e.g., use for pro-
</p>
<p>tection) were more persuasive than promotion- 
</p>
<p>focused messages (e.g., use for a healthy tan), and 
</p>
<p>this was especially the case for individuals in a 
</p>
<p>prevention focus. Similarly, participants in a study 
</p>
<p>by Mourali and Pons (2009) were willing to pay 
</p>
<p>more for consumer products (e.g., computers, 
</p>
<p>printers) when a fit existed between regulatory 
</p>
<p>focus (promotion vs. prevention) and the decision 
</p>
<p>strategy.
</p>
<p>Another field that has repeatedly demon-
</p>
<p>strated regulatory fit effects is leadership research 
</p>
<p>(for an overview, see Sassenberg &amp; Hamstra, 
</p>
<p>2017). Regulatory fit from regulatory focus and 
</p>
<p>regulatory mode lead to lower turnover inten-
</p>
<p>tions, more positive leader evaluations regarding 
</p>
<p>effectiveness and satisfaction, and more organi-
</p>
<p>zational citizenship behavior (Benjamin &amp; Flynn, 
</p>

<p>Try to create messages to advertise a dating

</p>
<p>2006; Sassenberg &amp; Hamstra, 2017). In a study 
</p>
<p>by Hamstra, Sassenberg, Van Yperen, and Wisse 
</p>
<p>(2014), for example, a regulatory fit between the 
</p>
<p>regulatory focus of leaders and their group mem-
</p>
<p>bers in a real-estate business simulation task 
</p>
<p>made group members feel more valued by their 
</p>
<p>leader than when no regulatory fit existed.
</p>
<p>Regulatory fit also asserts a positive impact in 
</p>
<p>other domains of organizational psychology. 
</p>
<p>Applicants consider, for example, jobs fitting 
</p>
<p>their regulatory focus more attractive (Sassenberg 
</p>
<p>&amp; Scholl, 2013). Promotion-focused individuals 
</p>
<p>value jobs more when they can take the lead and 
</p>
<p>work autonomously, for example. In contrast, 
</p>
<p>prevention-focused individuals valued job secu-
</p>
<p>rity more, feeling more attracted to jobs where 
</p>
<p>they were able to continue developing, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, through continued job training or gaining 
</p>
<p>useful work experience. In addition, recruiters 
</p>
<p>are more likely to select applications with a 
</p>
<p>motivation letter fitting their own self-regulation 
</p>
<p>strategy (Hamstra, Van Yperen, Wisse, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Sassenberg, 2013).
</p>
<p>Finally, there is evidence that regulatory fit 
</p>
<p>effects can facilitate sports performance. If a par-
</p>
<p>ticular activity (e.g., defense) is perceived in line 
</p>
<p>with an athletes regulatory focus (prevention 
</p>
<p>focus), this leads to higher performance. This has 
</p>
<p>been demonstrated for penalty kicking in soccer 
</p>
<p>(Plessner, Unkelbach, Memmert, Baltes, &amp; Kolb, 
</p>
<p>2009) and putting in golf (Kutzner, F&ouml;rderer, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Plessner, 2013). These findings should, however, 
</p>
<p>be considered as preliminary, because they rely 
</p>
<p>on studies with small sample sizes.
</p>
<p>All in all, this brief overview indicates that 
</p>
<p>regulatory fit effects have a broad range of appli-
</p>
<p>cations. In most empirical studies, fit from promo-
</p>
<p>tion and fit from prevention (or fit from both 
</p>
<p>regulatory modes) occur. However, there are also 
</p>
<p>applications in the organizational context (Petrou, 
</p>
<p>Demerouti, &amp; H&auml;fner, 2015) as well as in close 
</p>
<p>relationships (Righetti, Finkenauer, &amp; Rusbult, 
</p>
<p>2011) that only found effects of regulatory fit 
</p>
<p>from either promotion or prevention focus. At this 
</p>
<p>point, it is not clear what caused these asymme-
</p>
<p>tries in the findings. For applications of regulatory 
</p>
<p>fit in field interventions, this implies that it needs 
</p>
<p>to be thoroughly checked whether an intervention 
</p>
<p>works equally well for participants in a prevention 
</p>
<p>focus and those in a promotion focus.
</p>
<p>The above summary has left out the domain in 
</p>
<p>which the regulatory fit hypothesis has been 
</p>
<p>applied most frequently and very successfully, 
</p>
<p>namely, health communication.
</p>
<p> Self-Regulation and&nbsp;Regulatory Fit 
in&nbsp;Health Communication
</p>
<p>Many threats to public health arise from people&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>behaviors and lifestyles. For example, of a total of 
</p>
<p>56.9 million deaths in 2016, 15.2 million deaths 
</p>
<p>(27%) were caused by ischemic heart disease 
</p>
<p>(blockage of arteries to the heart) and strokes&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>caused by factors such as smoking, drinking alco-
</p>
<p>hol, fatty foods, and stress, in combination with a 
</p>
<p>sedentary lifestyle (WHO, 2018). Therefore, pub-
</p>
<p>lic health professionals try to find effective com-
</p>
<p>munication strategies to motivate individuals to 
</p>
<p>change their health relevant behavior (Ludolph &amp; 
</p>
<p>Schulz, 2015). Over the last decade or so, 
</p>
<p>researchers have frequently made use of the idea 
</p>
<p>of regulatory fit. To be more  precise, messages 
</p>
<p>promoting a certain health behavior are framed in 
</p>
<p>terms of gains (such as health promotion) or non-
</p>
<p>losses (such as preventing illnesses) and delivered 
</p>
<p>to recipients with a chronic or situationally 
</p>
<p>induced promotion or prevention focus (see 
</p>
<p>Table&nbsp;4.3 examples of tailored messages). As an 
</p>
<p>outcome of a substantial narrative review, Ludolph 
</p>
<p>and Schulz (2015, p.&nbsp;149) conclude &ldquo;regulatory fit 
</p>
<p>is a promising approach to enhance the effective-
</p>
<p>ness of health messages.&rdquo; Therefore, the remain-
</p>
<p>der of this chapter summarizes a field study 
</p>
<p>demonstrating the successful application of regu-
</p>
<p>latory fit in health communication regarding a 
</p>
<p>health behavior&nbsp;&ndash; here physical activity.
</p>
<p>Latimer, Rivers et&nbsp;al. (2008) aimed to test the 
</p>
<p>impact of regulatory fit in health communication. 
</p>
<p>They experimentally varied health messages 
</p>
<p>related to physical activity in order to increase 
</p>
<p>physical activity among inactive individuals 
</p>
<p>(i.e., &ldquo;couch potatoes&rdquo;). While the content of the 
</p>
<p>messages was constant, their framing varied. 
</p>
<p>They either received a gain-framed message 
</p>
<p>emphasizing the benefits of physical activity or a 
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>60
</p>
<p>loss- framed message emphasizing the potential 
</p>
<p>costs associated with not being physically active 
</p>
<p>(e.g., &ldquo;Scientists say to accumulate physical 
</p>
<p>activity throughout the day to stay healthy or 
</p>
<p>improve your health&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Scientists say failing to 
</p>
<p>accumulate enough physical activity throughout 
</p>
<p>the day can lead to poor health&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Based on the theory of regulatory fit, the 
</p>
<p>researchers predicted that gain-framed messages 
</p>
<p>would &ldquo;fit&rdquo; better with a promotion focus, 
</p>
<p>whereas loss-framed messages would &ldquo;fit&rdquo; better 
</p>
<p>with a prevention focus. As a result, after reading 
</p>
<p>gain-framed messages, promotion-focused indi-
</p>
<p>viduals should experience more value from regu-
</p>
<p>lar exercise (i.e., have more positive thoughts and 
</p>
<p>feelings about physical exercise) and engage in 
</p>
<p>greater physical activity than prevention-focused 
</p>
<p>individuals. In contrast, after reading loss-framed 
</p>
<p>messages, prevention-focused individuals should 
</p>
<p>experience more value from regular exercise 
</p>
<p>and engage in greater physical activity than 
</p>
<p>promotion- focused individuals.
</p>
<p>To test these hypotheses, the researchers 
</p>
<p>recruited a total of 206 participants (aged 
</p>
<p>18&ndash;69&nbsp;years) with a sedentary lifestyle through 
</p>
<p>the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s (NCI) database of 
</p>
<p>the American public (i.e., cancer survivors and 
</p>
<p>their family and friends). Through the NCI, peo-
</p>
<p>ple can ask questions and gain information about 
</p>
<p>cancer by calling a toll-free number. Consenting 
</p>
<p>callers first completed a screening interview to 
</p>
<p>gauge if they were eligible to participate in the 
</p>
<p>study. For example, callers with a physical 
</p>
<p>impairment or doctor&rsquo;s recommendation advis-
</p>
<p>ing against unsupervised physical activity were 
</p>
<p>not eligible to participate. Eligible participants 
</p>
<p>then completed a baseline interview assessing 
</p>
<p>their level of physical activity, after which they 
</p>
<p>were randomly exposed to either a promotion- or 
</p>
<p>prevention-focused message encouraging regular 
</p>
<p>physical exercise.
</p>
<p>Participants&rsquo; chronic regulatory focus and all 
</p>
<p>dependent measures (i.e., perceived value of 
</p>
<p>physical exercise and level of physical activity) 
</p>
<p>were assessed during a second interview, 2 weeks 
</p>
<p>later. Ideally, the assessment of the regulatory 
</p>
<p>focus should have taken place before the inter-
</p>
<p>vention. However, due to time restrictions during 
</p>
<p>the first telephone session, this was not possible. 
</p>
<p>Of the original 206 participant, only 118 com-
</p>
<p>pleted the second interview (57%). Those who 
</p>
<p>dropped out were more physically active before 
</p>
<p>receiving the intervention and more likely to be 
</p>
<p>of non-white ethnicity. Both&nbsp; &ndash; the order of the 
</p>
<p>measures and biased dropout&nbsp; &ndash; are limitations 
</p>
<p>that can often be found in field studies: organiza-
</p>
<p>tional restrictions often prevent the application of 
</p>
<p>an optimal design and control over the study, and 
</p>
<p>its participants are limited.
</p>
<p>Despite these methodological limitations, the 
</p>
<p>findings of this field study provided support for 
</p>
<p>the regulatory fit hypothesis. As we can see in 
</p>
<p>Fig.&nbsp; 4.3, individuals with a strong prevention 
</p>
<p>focus who received a loss-framed message 
</p>
<p>reported that they had engaged more in physical 
</p>
<p>activity over the last 2 weeks (i.e., a product of 
</p>
<p>time spend on exercising and intensity of the 
</p>
<p>exercise). The same was true for individuals with 
</p>
<p>a strong promotion focus who received a gain- 
</p>
<p>framed message. Importantly, these results con-
</p>
<p>trolled for physical activity prior to receiving the 
</p>
<p>message. This study supports the general tenet of 
</p>
<p>Table 4.3 Samples of tailored messages regarding fruit (F) and vegetable (V) intake

</p>
<p>regulatory focus theory and illustrates that a 
</p>
<p>seemingly trivial difference in the way a message 
</p>
<p>is framed can have significant ramifications on a 
</p>
<p>behavioral level.
</p>
<p>Recall, however, that the researchers not only 
</p>
<p>predicted an effect on participants&rsquo; actual physical 
</p>
<p>activity. Indeed, regulatory fit theory suggests this 
</p>
<p>effect occurs because the existence of fit leads 
</p>
<p>people to attach more value to those behaviors that 
</p>
<p>facilitate goal attainment. The findings from the 
</p>
<p>current study also supported this claim. Thus, par-
</p>
<p>ticipants who experience a fit between the mes-
</p>
<p>sage and their regulatory focus reported more 
</p>
<p>positive feelings about the message, as well as 
</p>
<p>more positive prospective and retrospective feel-
</p>
<p>ings associated with engaging in physical activity. 
</p>
<p>Finally, these feelings associated with physical 
</p>
<p>activity mediated the impact of regulatory focus 
</p>
<p>and message type on physical activity.
</p>
<p>In sum, the findings of this study underline 
</p>
<p>the potential of regulatory fit for health commu-
</p>
<p>nication, despite the limitations regarding the 
</p>
<p>design and the attrition mentioned above. The 
</p>
<p>fact that similar results have been reported in a 
</p>
<p>number of studies (for a summary, see Ludolph 
</p>
<p>&amp; Schulz, 2015) further justifies this conclusion. 
</p>
<p>Positive effects of messages high in regulatory 
</p>
<p>fit have also been found for healthy snacking 
</p>
<p>(Hong &amp; Lee, 2007), attitudes toward organic 
</p>
<p>food (Hsu &amp; Chen, 2014), and many other 
</p>
<p>health-related attitudes and choices. Thus, the 
</p>
<p>regulatory fit hypothesis has proved to be a pow-
</p>
<p>erful framework for health-related intervention as 
</p>
<p>well as interventions in other domains.

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; People are not only motivated by their 
</p>
<p>preferences regarding content&nbsp; &ndash; their 
</p>
<p>goals, motives, and needs. They also 
</p>
<p>engage in behaviors that fit their prefer-
</p>
<p>ences regarding processes&nbsp; &ndash; their pre-
</p>
<p>ferred self-regulatory strategies.
</p>
<p>&bull; In a promotion focus, individuals focus 
</p>
<p>on gains and non-gains and pursuit 
</p>
<p>goals applying eager, risky strategies.
</p>
<p>&bull; In a prevention focus, individuals focus 
</p>
<p>on non-losses and losses and pursuit 
</p>
<p>goals applying defensive, conservative 
</p>
<p>strategies.
</p>
<p>&bull; When tasks or contexts allow individuals 
</p>
<p>to behave in line with their self-regula-
</p>
<p>tion  strategies, they experience regula-
</p>
<p>tory fit and thus become more engaged 
</p>
<p>in the task.
</p>
<p>&bull; These regulatory fit effects have the 
</p>
<p>potential to increase motivation in many 
</p>
<p>domains such as health, sports, consumer 
</p>
<p>behavior, or work.

</p>
<p> Guiding Answers to&nbsp;Questions 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Q (with Fig.&nbsp;4.2): In which regulatory focus is 
</p>
<p>the glass half empty and in which half full?
</p>
<p>A: In a promotion focus, the glass would be 
</p>
<p>perceived as half full due to the focus on the 
</p>
<p>gains (here the water that is still in the glass). 
</p>
<p>In contrast, in a prevention focus, the glass 
</p>
<p>would be classified as half empty because of 
</p>
<p>the focus on the losses (here the water that is 
</p>
<p>missing in the glass).
</p>
<p> 2. Q (with Box 4.2): Individuals differ chronically 
</p>
<p>in their regulatory focus. Think about jobs for 
</p>
<p>which a promotion focus and a prevention 
</p>
<p>focus would be particularly profitable. Why?
</p>
<p>A: Prevention focus fits jobs with a focus on 
</p>
<p>security, where the identification of problems 
</p>
<p>or failures is leading, or jobs focused on 
</p>
<p>enforcement of rules and obligations. 
</p>
<p>Promotion focus fits better with jobs focused 
</p>
<p>on growth, where the identification of changes 
</p>
<p>and opportunities for development is leading, 
</p>
<p>or jobs focused on creative output.
</p>
<p> 3. Q (with Box 4.2): Imagine you would like to 
</p>
<p>move to a new flat with the help of some 
</p>
<p>friends. Which tasks would you allocate to 
</p>
<p>promotion-focused individuals and which to 
</p>
<p>prevention-focused individuals and why?
</p>
<p>A: Tasks that require attention to detail and 
</p>
<p>the prevention of something going wrong 
</p>
<p>(e.g., the handling of precious or vulnerable 
</p>
<p>items) would better fit a prevention focus. 
</p>
<p>Tasks that require an optimistic, positive, and 
</p>
<p>creative approach (e.g., fitting furniture in the 
</p>
<p>truck, decorating the house) would better fit a 
</p>
<p>promotion focus.
</p>
<p> 4. Q (with Box 4.4): Try to create messages to 
</p>
<p>advertise a dating website that are tailored to 
</p>
<p>create regulatory fit in individuals with a 
</p>
<p>strong promotion and a strong prevention 
</p>
<p>focus, respectively.
</p>
<p>A: To create messages that fit the different foci, 
</p>
<p>try to identify what people can gain or lose by 
</p>
<p>becoming or not becoming a member of a dat-
</p>
<p>ing site (e.g., to help people find a perfect match 
</p>
<p>vs. to help people prevent being alone).

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Why do we behave as we do? Ask your colleague 
</p>
<p>why he is driving to work instead of using public 
</p>
<p>transport, and you are likely to hear some sensi-
</p>
<p>ble reasons: &ldquo;It gets me faster to work,&rdquo; &ldquo;The bus 
</p>
<p>is unreliable,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I need to carry my bag.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>While these may be genuine considerations, the 
</p>
<p>most accurate and arguably the most honest 
</p>
<p>answer is &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I always do.&rdquo; Ask an 
</p>
<p>applied social psychologist why people behave 
</p>
<p>as they do, and you are likely to be presented 
</p>
<p>with a socio-cognitive model, most likely the 
</p>
<p>theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991). The 
</p>
<p>basic assumption of these models is that motiva-
</p>
<p>tion is driving our behavior and that attitudes and 
</p>
<p>intentions are the most powerful determinants. 
</p>
<p>However, the literature on the relation between 
</p>
<p>attitudes and behavior has always been haunted 
</p>
<p>by one salient finding: while intentions are rea-
</p>
<p>sonably good predictors of future behavior, mea-
</p>
<p>sures of past behavior consistently outperform 
</p>
<p>this prediction and share variance with future 
</p>
<p>behavior that is not accounted for by intentions. 
</p>
<p>There may be many reasons for this (e.g., Ajzen, 
</p>
<p>2002), but one is that when behavior is frequently 
</p>
<p>executed, it may become dissociated from the 
</p>
<p>intention it originated from. Indeed, Judith 
</p>
<p>Ouellette and Wendy Wood (1998) demonstrated 
</p>
<p>in a meta-analysis of studies which included 
</p>
<p>measures of intentions, past behavior, and future

<p>behavior that frequently performed behaviors 
</p>
<p>were less strongly correlated with intentions 
</p>
<p>compared to infrequently performed behaviors.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we will first define what habits 
</p>
<p>are and describe consequences of habituation. 
</p>
<p>We then briefly discuss how habit strength can be 
</p>
<p>measured. The remainder of this chapter is 
</p>
<p>devoted to habit change.
</p>
<p> Defining Habit
</p>
<p>In a diary study among students, Wendy Wood, 
</p>
<p>Jeffrey Quinn, and Deborah Kashy (2002) estab-
</p>
<p>lished that between a third and half of the 
</p>
<p>reported behaviors were things they did almost 
</p>
<p>daily and usually in the same location. And they 
</p>
<p>did not spend much thinking on those behaviors: 
</p>
<p>their thoughts wandered about 50&ndash;60% of the 
</p>
<p>time during those episodes. Thus, repeated 
</p>
<p>behaviors are not only prevalent; they may 
</p>
<p>acquire a quality of automaticity (e.g., Verplanken 
</p>
<p>&amp; Aarts, 1999). Also, a habit is formed when 
</p>
<p>someone repeatedly and automatically responds 
</p>
<p>in a specific way to a specific cue in a recurrent, 
</p>
<p>stable, context (e.g., Wood &amp; Neal, 2007). A cue 
</p>
<p>can be anything, for instance, time (going to the 
</p>
<p>gym at 5&nbsp;o&rsquo;clock), location (buying popcorn in 
</p>
<p>the cinema), an object (not resisting that choco-
</p>
<p>late muffin), a person (joking with your room-
</p>
<p>mate), a physiological state (grabbing a coke 
</p>
<p>when thirsty), or activities (ordering a take-away 
</p>
<p>when watching a football game). These cue-
</p>
<p>response associations are stored in memory, and 
</p>
<p>a response is automatically triggered upon 
</p>
<p>encountering the cue. We are now ready for a 
</p>
<p>definition of habits as &ldquo;memory- based propensi-
</p>
<p>ties to respond automatically to specific cues, 
</p>
<p>which are acquired by the repetition of cue-spe-
</p>
<p>cific behaviours in stable contexts.&rdquo; (Verplanken, 
</p>
<p>2018, p.&nbsp;4). Thus, perhaps contrary to how peo-
</p>
<p>ple talk about habits, a habit is defined as a cog-
</p>
<p>nitive structure which involves a propensity to 
</p>
<p>act, and not as the act itself (e.g., Wood &amp; 
</p>
<p>R&uuml;nger, 2016).
</p>
<p>Let us focus still briefly on the aspect of auto-
</p>
<p>maticity. Automaticity comes in many &ldquo;flavors.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>John Bargh (1994) distinguished four qualities 
</p>
<p>which define automatic processes and which he 
</p>
<p>dubbed &ldquo;the four horsemen of automaticity&rdquo;: lack 
</p>
<p>of awareness, lack of intentionality, mental effi-
</p>
<p>ciency, and difficulty to control or stop a process. 
</p>
<p>Processes may be automatic in some or all of these 
</p>
<p>features, and this also holds for habits (Verplanken 
</p>
<p>&amp; Orbell, 2003). Thus, most habits are character-
</p>
<p>ized by a lack of awareness and conscious intent, 
</p>
<p>are difficult not to do, and are mentally efficient, 
</p>
<p>for instance, allowing you to multitask.
</p>
<p>Habits are not necessarily confined to observ-
</p>
<p>able behavior. We also have habits of thinking 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Verplanken, Friborg, Wang, Trafimow, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Woolf, 2007; Watkins, 2008). Such mental habits 
</p>
<p>follow the same principles as behavioral habits. 
</p>
<p>Thus, habitual thoughts occur automatically upon 
</p>
<p>being activated by cues in stable contexts. For 
</p>
<p>instance, a person may always have certain 
</p>
<p>thoughts when looking in the mirror, entering a 
</p>
<p>confined space, or encountering a particular per-
</p>
<p>son. When these thoughts are negative, such habits 
</p>
<p>may significantly contribute to dysfunctional out-
</p>
<p>comes such as low self-esteem (e.g., Verplanken 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2007) or a negative body image (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Verplanken &amp; Tangelder, 2011).

<p>Box 5.1 Questions for Elaboration
</p>
<p>Make a list of things you do frequently. For 
</p>
<p>each habit:
</p>
<p> 1. Identify the cue which triggers the 
</p>
<p>habitual response, for instance, with

<p>respect to food, study, or leisure.

</p>
<p> Consequences of&nbsp;Habituation
</p>
<p>Apart from being efficient and dealing with the 
</p>
<p>regularity of everyday life, habituation has other 
</p>
<p>consequences. One is that habits come with an 
</p>
<p>action-oriented mindset, that is, a cognitive ori-
</p>
<p>entation characterized by a focus on executing 
</p>
<p>the behavior at hand. This is in contrast to a 
</p>
<p>deliberative mindset, where the individual is 
</p>
<p>oriented toward possibilities and alternatives, for 
</p>
<p>instance, when one is in the process of making an 
</p>
<p>important decision (e.g., Gollwitzer, 1990; see 
</p>
<p>also Keller, Bieleke, &amp; Gollwitzer, Chap. 2). 
</p>
<p>Thus, people in a habit mindset tend not to pay 
</p>
<p>attention to alternative courses of action or to 
</p>
<p>information about the context in which the behav-
</p>
<p>ior occurs.
</p>
<p>In a research program on transportation mode 
</p>
<p>choices, Bas Verplanken, Henk Aarts, and Ad van 
</p>
<p>Knippenberg (1997) tested this proposition in 
</p>
<p>two laboratory studies. Participants in the first 
</p>
<p>study were presented with a hypothetical travel 
</p>
<p>mode choice situation and had the opportunity to 
</p>
<p>search information about attributes such as travel 
</p>
<p>time or convenience for a number of travel mode 
</p>
<p>options. Previously, the strength of their habit of 
</p>
<p>cycling was assessed. Those who had strong 
</p>
<p>cycling habits selected less information com-
</p>
<p>pared to those with weak cycling habits, while 
</p>
<p>the information habitual cyclists sought was 
</p>
<p>predominantly about their own habit: cycling. In 
</p>
<p>a second study, participants were presented with 
</p>
<p>a series of unknown travel situations. Each time 
</p>
<p>they had to &ldquo;discover&rdquo; the nature of those situa-
</p>
<p>tions before making a choice of a mode of travel, 
</p>
<p>for instance, in terms of distance, luggage, or 
</p>
<p>weather conditions. Previously, participants&rsquo; car 
</p>
<p>use habit was assessed. Strong car use habit par-
</p>
<p>ticipants consistently selected less information 
</p>
<p>than weak habit participants; in other words, 
</p>
<p>strong habit participants needed to know less about 
</p>
<p>the travel context in order to make up their minds 
</p>
<p>on how to travel. This effect appeared even when 
</p>
<p>participants were prompted to deliberate about 
</p>
<p>every situation. These studies thus demonstrated 
</p>
<p>that habit comes with tunnel vision, that is, a lack 
</p>
<p>of attention to or interest in information.
</p>
<p>Another consequence of habituation is that 
</p>
<p>established habits are not driven anymore by con-
</p>
<p>scious intentions. While goals and associated 
</p>
<p>intentions may form the starting point of many 
</p>
<p>habits, and leave their traces in our cognitive sys-
</p>
<p>tem (e.g., Aarts &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2000), those 
</p>
<p>links may weaken or get lost altogether over 
</p>
<p>time. Habitual acts are then merely instigated by 
</p>
<p>the context cues that have got associated with the 
</p>
<p>behavior, that is, without the involvement of 
</p>
<p>goals or intentions (e.g., Wood &amp; R&uuml;nger, 2016). 
</p>
<p>Thus, while non-habitual behavior is under the 
</p>
<p>control of &ldquo;willpower,&rdquo; habituation shifts this 
</p>
<p>control to the context that triggers the habit. 
</p>
<p>David Neal, Wendy Wood, Mengju Wu, and 
</p>
<p>David Kurlander (2011) demonstrated this in the 
</p>
<p>cinema. Participants were invited to either a cin-
</p>
<p>ema or a campus meeting room and were given 
</p>
<p>popcorn while watching movie trailers. The pop-
</p>
<p>corn was either freshly cooked or old and stale. In 
</p>
<p>addition, their habit strength of &ldquo;eating popcorn 
</p>
<p>in movie theaters&rdquo; was assessed. Participants 
</p>
<p>who had a strong popcorn habit and received 
</p>
<p>fresh popcorn ate similar amounts compared to 
</p>
<p>strong habit participants who received stale pop-
</p>
<p>corn. However, this was only the case in the cin-
</p>
<p>ema context, that is, the context in which they 
</p>
<p>performed their habit, and not in the campus 
</p>
<p>meeting room.
</p>
<p> 2. Reflect on whether this habit is func-
</p>
<p>tional or dysfunctional. Is it healthy or 
</p>
<p>convenient? Might it have harmful 
</p>
<p>consequences?
</p>
<p> 3. Analyze to which extent Bargh&rsquo;s (1994) 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;four horsemen&rdquo; apply: lack of aware-
</p>
<p>ness, lack of intentionality, mental effi-
</p>
<p>ciency, and difficulty to control or stop. 
</p>
<p>For instance, do you remember making 
</p>
<p>a conscious decision; did you do other 
</p>
<p>things at the same time; would it be dif-
</p>
<p>ficult not to do?
</p>
<p>Repeat this exercise for a habit of 
</p>
<p>thinking.

<p/>

</p>
<p>Finally, habits are &ldquo;sticky,&rdquo; in the sense of 
</p>
<p>difficult to override. Suppose you have a strong 
</p>
<p>habit of driving a particular route to work. One 
</p>
<p>day you drive a friend to the airport. While being 
</p>
<p>engaged in a conversation, you suddenly realize 
</p>
<p>you took a turn to work instead of the airport. 
</p>
<p>Thus, in spite of a conscious decision to act dif-
</p>
<p>ferently from an established habit, this habit may 
</p>
<p>still take over. This happens when you are off 
</p>
<p>guard, in this case being engaged in the conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with your friend. Unintentionally perform-
</p>
<p>ing a habit under such circumstances has been 
</p>
<p>documented as action slips (e.g., Heckhausen &amp; 
</p>
<p>Beckmann, 1990). Sheina Orbell and Bas 
</p>
<p>Verplanken (2010; Study 2) conducted a survey 
</p>
<p>among smokers in public bars 2&nbsp;months before 
</p>
<p>smoking in pubs became illegal in the UK, who 
</p>
<p>then completed a second survey 4&nbsp;months after 
</p>
<p>the ban was introduced. The first measurement 
</p>
<p>contained an assessment of the strength of the 
</p>
<p>habit of smoking-while-drinking-alcohol. At fol-
</p>
<p>low- up participants were asked to report if they 
</p>
<p>had made accidental action slips by lighting, or 
</p>
<p>nearly lighting, a cigarette since the ban came 
</p>
<p>into force. Forty-two percent of the smokers 
</p>
<p>reported to have experienced such action slips, 
</p>
<p>and this was predicted by the strength of the pre-
</p>
<p>viously assessed habit strength of smoking when 
</p>
<p>drinking alcohol.
</p>
<p> The Measurement of&nbsp;Habit
</p>
<p>It is not easy to capture constructs as elusive as 
</p>
<p>habits. Although they are prevalent in everyday 
</p>
<p>life, people are hardly aware of them, as you may 
</p>
<p>have experienced if you did the exercise sug-
</p>
<p>gested in Box 5.1. Similar to many psychological 
</p>
<p>constructs, there are no ways we can measure 
</p>
<p>habit objectively, so we have to rely on indirect 
</p>
<p>indicators. Three families of measurements have 
</p>
<p>been used to assess habit strength, observations, 
</p>
<p>self-reports, and implicit measures (e.g., Orbell 
</p>
<p>&amp; Verplanken, 2018). Each type reveals a differ-
</p>
<p>ent aspect of a habit.
</p>
<p>Some scholars observe behavior and consider 
</p>
<p>the frequency of occurrence as a measure of habit 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Gram, 2010). While observable acts may be 
</p>
<p>the outcome of a habit, behavioral frequency does 
</p>
<p>not capture the automaticity aspect of a habitual 
</p>
<p>action. A physician may frequently refer patients to 
</p>
<p>the hospital, but this (hopefully) is not a habit. Also, 
</p>
<p>systematically observing overt behavior is difficult 
</p>
<p>and time-consuming. Another observation-based 
</p>
<p>instrument is the response frequency measure (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Verplanken, Aarts, van Knippenberg, &amp; van 
</p>
<p>Knippenberg, 1994). Participants are presented 
</p>
<p>with multiple choice scenarios, for each of which 
</p>
<p>they are instructed to choose an option as quickly 
</p>
<p>as possible. The prevalence of one particular choice 
</p>
<p>option across scenarios is taken as a measure of 
</p>
<p>habit. Importantly, time pressure is an essential ele-
</p>
<p>ment, which is not always easy to implement. Also, 
</p>
<p>for each habit domain, scenarios need to be devel-
</p>
<p>oped and tested, which renders this method some-
</p>
<p>what cumbersome.
</p>
<p>By far the most prevalent method of assessing 
</p>
<p>habit strength are self-report measures. For a 
</p>
<p>long time habit was equated with past behavioral 
</p>
<p>frequency, which was an inheritance from the 
</p>
<p>behaviorist school. Many studies employed one- 
</p>
<p>item measures of the kind &ldquo;How often did you do 
</p>
<p>behavior X,&rdquo; followed by response scales such as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;never&rdquo; to &ldquo;always.&rdquo; However, these measures 
</p>
<p>also ignore the automaticity aspect. In addition, 
</p>
<p>one-item measures are notoriously unreliable and 
</p>
<p>subject to biases. Wendy Wood and colleagues 
</p>
<p>developed the frequency-in-context measure 
</p>

</p>
<p>(e.g., Ji &amp; Wood, 2007). This measure consists of 
</p>
<p>a retrospective self-report of performance fre-
</p>
<p>quency weighed by a measure of the stability of 
</p>
<p>the performance context. The unique feature of 
</p>
<p>this measure is the quantification of context sta-
</p>
<p>bility. However, &ldquo;context&rdquo; needs to be defined in 
</p>
<p>each instance. Neither does this measure tap into 
</p>
<p>the automaticity aspect. The most prevalent 
</p>
<p>instrument to date is the Self-Report Habit Index 
</p>
<p>(SRHI; Verplanken &amp; Orbell, 2003; see Box 5.2). 
</p>
<p>This measure consists of 12 items, which are 
</p>
<p>self-reports of the experience of repetition and 
</p>
<p>automaticity. Automaticity is broken down into 
</p>
<p>facets we discussed above: lack of awareness and 
</p>
<p>conscious intent, the difficulty of avoiding the 
</p>
<p>behavior, and mental efficiency. The measure is 
</p>
<p>generic and easy to use. However, a question 
</p>
<p>remains how well people are able to report on 
</p>
<p>such processes. An adapted version of the SRHI, 
</p>
<p>the Habit Index of Negative Thinking (HINT; 
</p>
<p>Verplanken et&nbsp;al., 2007), is used to assess habits 
</p>
<p>of thinking.
</p>
<p>Finally, as habits reside as memory traces and 
</p>
<p>manifest as automatic responses, measures that 
</p>
<p>tap into implicit processes have been used to 
</p>
<p>assess habit strength. One such paradigm&nbsp; &ndash; the 
</p>
<p>slips-of-action task&nbsp; &ndash; capitalizes on the action 
</p>
<p>slip phenomenon discussed above (e.g., de Wit 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al. 2012). Participants learn that certain cues 
</p>
<p>are associated with rewards and others are not. 
</p>
<p>Subsequently they are being instructed that these 
</p>
<p>cues lead to losses instead of rewards (a so-called 
</p>
<p>outcome devaluation paradigm). In a later test 
</p>
<p>phase, habit strength is indicated by the failure to 
</p>
<p>avoid responding to the initially rewarding, but 
</p>
<p>later devalued, cues. Implicit measures are argu-
</p>
<p>ably the closest one may get to a habit. On the 
</p>
<p>other hand, it is often difficult to establish the 
</p>
<p>validity of such measures.
</p>
<p>Researchers nowadays thus have a choice 
</p>
<p>between a number of habit measures and can select 
</p>
<p>the measure that is most suitable in a particular 
</p>
<p>research context. For instance, computerized tasks, 
</p>
<p>such as the slips-of-action task, are more suitable 
</p>
<p>in a laboratory context, while the SRHI is highly 
</p>
<p>suitable for questionnaires. The different mea-
</p>
<p>sures also tap into different aspects of a habit and 
</p>
<p>may thus be selected on that basis.
</p>
<p>Box 5.2 Zooming In: Measuring Habits 
</p>
<p>Using the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI)
</p>
<p>The Self-Report Habit Index (Verplanken&nbsp;&amp; 
</p>
<p>Orbell, 2003) is a generic instrument to as-
</p>
<p>sess habit strength. It consists of a stem 
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Behavior X is something&hellip;&rdquo;), followed by 
</p>
<p>12 items. The stem can refer to any behavior. 
</p>
<p>The researcher can choose to formulate this 
</p>
<p>as general or specific as required and, if the 
</p>
<p>researcher so wishes, may include context 
</p>
<p>information (e.g., &ldquo;Conducting Behavior X 
</p>
<p>in Condition Y is something&hellip;&rdquo;). The 12 
</p>
<p>items assess facets of habit, including the 
</p>
<p>experience of repetition, lack of awareness 
</p>
<p>and conscious intent, lack of control, mental 
</p>
<p>efficiency, and a sense of self-identity. The 
</p>
<p>items are accompanied by Likert response 
</p>
<p>scales (e.g., 5 or 7 point agree/disagree 
</p>
<p>scales). Items may be slightly modified in 
</p>
<p>order to accommodate a specific behavior or 
</p>
<p>context (e.g., the researcher has to choose a 
</p>
<p>time frame in item 7).
</p>
<p>[Behavior X] is something&hellip;
</p>
<p> 1. I do frequently.
</p>
<p> 2. I do automatically.
</p>
<p> 3. I do without having to consciously 
</p>
<p>remember.
</p>
<p> 4. That makes me feel weird if I do not do it.
</p>
<p> 5. I do without thinking.
</p>
<p> 6. That would require effort not to do it.
</p>
<p> 7. That belongs to my (daily, weekly, 
</p>
<p>monthly) routine.
</p>
<p> 8. I start doing before I realize I&rsquo;m 
</p>
<p>doing it.
</p>
<p> 9. I would find hard not to do.
</p>
<p> 10. I have no need to think about doing.
</p>
<p> 11. That&rsquo;s typically &ldquo;me.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 12. I have been doing for a long time.
</p>
<p>After checking the internal reliability of 
</p>
<p>the scale, the researcher typically averages 
</p>
<p>the items into an overall habit strength 
</p>
<p>score.

<p>5 Habit and&nbsp;Behavior Change</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>70
</p>
<p> Perspectives on&nbsp;Habit Change
</p>
<p>Almost by definition, habits are hard to change. 
</p>
<p>The consequences of habituation we outlined 
</p>
<p>above do not bode well for interventions that aim 
</p>
<p>at behavior change through the provision of 
</p>
<p>information and thus changing attitudes and 
</p>
<p>intentions. If habits attenuate attention to infor-
</p>
<p>mation, and if there is no link between attitudes 
</p>
<p>and intentions and behavior, such approaches bet 
</p>
<p>on the wrong horse when aiming at changing 
</p>
<p>strong habits.
</p>
<p>So how does one change habits? This is of 
</p>
<p>course one of those million dollar questions. 
</p>
<p>Here we discuss two perspectives. The first is a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;micro&rdquo; level perspective and focuses on the cue- 
</p>
<p>response contingencies that constitute a habit, 
</p>
<p>namely, the use of implementation intentions. 
</p>
<p>The second is a more &ldquo;macro&rdquo; perspective, which 
</p>
<p>capitalizes on disruptions of the habit perfor-
</p>
<p>mance context. We will thus focus on the poten-
</p>
<p>tial for change when contexts change, or when 
</p>
<p>people change context, such as moving to a dif-
</p>
<p>ferent city or location.
</p>
<p> Using Implementation Intentions 
to&nbsp;Change Habits
</p>
<p>If we zoom in on the mechanisms of habitual 
</p>
<p>behavior, a key element in the process is when a 
</p>
<p>cue triggers a habitual response. The &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>of habits becomes obvious at that very moment: 
</p>
<p>while bypassing our aptitude to reason and delib-
</p>
<p>erate, a habit makes us act instantly and automati-
</p>
<p>cally. If one wishes to change habitual behavior, 
</p>
<p>these cue-response moments should be a prime 
</p>
<p>focus. Thus, in designing an intervention, it is of 
</p>
<p>utmost importance to first analyze the habit con-
</p>
<p>text and identify the key cue-response occur-
</p>
<p>rences which are to be broken and replaced by 
</p>
<p>new, desired, responses.
</p>
<p>One technique that has been proposed to do 
</p>
<p>just that is the formation of implementation 
</p>
<p>intentions. Implementation intentions are con-
</p>
<p>crete &ldquo;IF-THEN&rdquo; plans, which may put an inten-
</p>
<p>tion into action (e.g., Gollwitzer, 1999; see also 
</p>
<p>Keller et&nbsp;al., Chap. 2). The &ldquo;IFs&rdquo; specify condi-
</p>
<p>tions in which action is required, in particular 
</p>
<p>where and when to act. The &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; specifies the 
</p>
<p>action itself. Implementation intentions have been 
</p>
<p>found effective means of accomplishing goals, 
</p>
<p>certainly given their simplicity (e.g., Gollwitzer 
</p>
<p>&amp; Sheeran, 2006). Implementation intentions do 
</p>
<p>two important things when applied to changing 
</p>
<p>habits. Firstly, they target existing cue-response 
</p>
<p>links, that is, they break the existing habit. 
</p>
<p>Secondly, implementation intentions specify the 
</p>
<p>very cues and responses which, after successful 
</p>
<p>repetitions, may form the future new habits. 
</p>
<p>Implementation intentions may thus be consid-
</p>
<p>ered as &ldquo;instant habits&rdquo; (e.g., Gollwitzer, 1999).
</p>
<p>Sheina Orbell and Bas Verplanken (2010; 
</p>
<p>Study 3) demonstrated that implementation 
</p>
<p>intentions may be effective not only in creating 
</p>
<p>new behavior but in particular instigating auto-
</p>
<p>matic responses. Participants were provided with 
</p>
<p>a packet of dental floss and instructions how to 
</p>
<p>use the material. They were randomly assigned to 
</p>
<p>an implementation intention or control condition. 
</p>
<p>In the implementation intention condition, they 
</p>
<p>were instructed to write down where and when 
</p>
<p>they would floss every day, such as &ldquo;After I brush 
</p>
<p>my teeth in the evening, I will floss in front of the 
</p>
<p>bathroom mirror.&rdquo; Habit strength was assessed at 
</p>
<p>baseline and 2 and 4&nbsp;weeks later. At the end of the 
</p>
<p>period, the remainder of participants&rsquo; flossing 
</p>
<p>material was collected and weighed, which thus 
</p>
<p>provided a measure of flossing behavior. There 
</p>
<p>were two important results. The first was that, in 
</p>
<p>line with other implementation intention studies, 
</p>
<p>having formed implementation intentions 
</p>
<p>resulted in more frequent flossing, which was 
</p>
<p>established by self-reported frequency and by the 
</p>
<p>weight of the remaining flossing materials. 
</p>
<p>Important for the present argument, an indepen-
</p>
<p>dent assessment of habit strength using the 
</p>
<p>Self- Report Habit Index revealed that in the 
</p>
<p>implementation intention condition, habit 
</p>
<p>strength became stronger over time compared to 
</p>
<p>the control condition (see Fig.&nbsp;5.1).
</p>
<p>Implementation intentions have been viewed 
</p>
<p>as effective self-regulation tools. When applied 
</p>
<p>to the formation of habits, the self-regulation 
</p>
<p>aspect may also apply; by using implementation 
</p>
<p>intentions to create new, desired, and durable 
</p>

</p>
<p>habits an individual can exert self-control in 
</p>
<p>accomplishing important goals (e.g., Galla &amp; 
</p>
<p>Duckworth, 2015).
</p>
<p>As is the case with any method, the use of 
</p>
<p>implementation intentions has its limitations, 
</p>
<p>especially when applied in the complex world of 
</p>
<p>everyday life. In order to be effective, there are 
</p>
<p>quite some conditions that need to be fulfilled 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Adriaanse &amp; Verhoeven, 2018): ensuring 
</p>
<p>high motivation, formulating sufficiently specific 
</p>
<p>IF-THEN plans, finding the critical cue that trig-
</p>
<p>gers the habit, creating strong enough IF-THEN 
</p>
<p>links, and staying motivated and committed to 
</p>
<p>the plan. As can be imagined, this can easily go 
</p>
<p>wrong.
</p>
<p> Habit Discontinuities
</p>
<p>As habits are contingent on cues in the perfor-
</p>
<p>mance context, it follows that if that context 
</p>
<p>changes, or individuals change context, habits are 
</p>
<p>disrupted. There are many examples of such situ-
</p>
<p>ations. Some are small or temporary, such as a 
</p>
<p>strike that disrupts your commute. Others are 
</p>
<p>more profound. This is particularly the case when 
</p>
<p>individuals go through life course changes, such 
</p>
<p>as transitions from school to work, moving house, 
</p>
<p>starting a family, divorce, or retirement. Context 
</p>
<p>change may also occur at larger scales, such as 
</p>
<p>when companies reorganize, natural disasters 
</p>
<p>strike, or an economic downturn affects people&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>financial resources. Whatever the scale of the 
</p>
<p>disruption is, habits are likely to be affected and 
</p>
<p>may no longer be feasible or useful. Or, in Kurt 
</p>
<p>Lewin's (1947) terms, habits &ldquo;unfreeze.&rdquo; What 
</p>
<p>often happens is that after a while, individuals 
</p>
<p>find their old habits, perhaps adapted to the new 
</p>
<p>circumstances. However, disruptions also pro-
</p>
<p>vide opportunities for habit change. Under those 
</p>
<p>conditions behavior change interventions might 
</p>
<p>be more effective than in default circumstances; 
</p>
<p>individuals may be more sensitive to (useful) 
</p>
<p>information, for instance, about available 
</p>
<p>options and may be &ldquo;in the mood for change.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>This has been discussed as the habit disconti-
</p>
<p>nuity hypothesis (e.g., see for a review, 
</p>
<p>Verplanken, Roy, &amp; Whitmarsh, 2018).

</p>
<p>5 Habit and&nbsp;Behavior Change</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72
</p>
<p>A number of studies provided supporting 
</p>
<p>evidence for the habit discontinuity hypothesis. 
</p>
<p>For instance, Bas Verplanken, Ian Walker, 
</p>
<p>Adrian Davis, and Michaela Jurasek (2008) 
</p>
<p>conducted a survey among university employ-
</p>
<p>ees and asked how they commuted to work. 
</p>
<p>They also assessed their level of environmental 
</p>
<p>concern. Unsurprisingly, environmentally con-
</p>
<p>cerned employees were less likely to commute by 
</p>
<p>car than environmentally less concerned employ-
</p>
<p>ees. However, this difference was only present if 
</p>
<p>they had moved house in the previous year (see 
</p>
<p>Fig.&nbsp;5.2). This result thus suggested that a change 
</p>
<p>of context (relocating) may have activated pro- 
</p>
<p>environmental values, at least among those who 
</p>
<p>adhered to those values, which were thus enacted 
</p>
<p>in the new situation, whereas under default 
</p>
<p>conditions, even environmentally concerned 
</p>
<p> individuals did not turn those values into action. 
</p>
<p>However, studies such as these are correlational 
</p>
<p>in nature and therefore do not allow to draw 
</p>
<p>causal conclusions. In the final section of this 
</p>
<p>chapter, we discuss in more detail a field experi-
</p>
<p>mental study (Verplanken &amp; Roy, 2016), which 
</p>
<p>was able to provide some stronger evidence for 
</p>
<p>the habit discontinuity hypothesis.
</p>
<p>The principle of using habit discontinuities to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;shake people up&rdquo; is sometimes used by retailers. 
</p>
<p>For instance, large stores and supermarkets move 
</p>
<p>products around every now and then. While there 
</p>
<p>may be many reasons to do so, an important 
</p>
<p>motive for such changes is to disrupt customers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>habits. Rather than entering the store and grab-
</p>
<p>bing the products they habitually purchase, the 
</p>
<p>new arrangements force customers to think and 
</p>
<p>explore and expose them to parts of the store they 
</p>
<p>otherwise would skip.

<p>Box 5.3 Questions for Elaboration
</p>
<p>Disrupt an existing habit (see, for instance, 
</p>
<p>Box 5.1), and observe what this is doing to 
</p>
<p>you. Answer the following questions:
</p>
<p> 1. How easy or difficult did you find dis-
</p>
<p>rupting the habit?
</p>
<p> 2. Did you simply stop doing it, or did you 
</p>
<p>replace the habit with something new?
</p>
<p> 3. Would it be easier if something in the 
</p>
<p>context or circumstances where your 
</p>

</p>
<p> Some Caveats
</p>
<p>We wish to add four caveats to the habit change 
</p>
<p>issue. The first is that breaking a habit and 
</p>
<p>replacing it by a new behavior does not mean the 
</p>
<p>old habits are gone. The very definition of habit 
</p>
<p>as a memory-based propensity suggests that 
</p>
<p>while a new behavior may be performed, the 
</p>
<p>memory trace of the old habit may still be intact 
</p>
<p>and may only gradually decay. This was demon-
</p>
<p>strated in a study among employees of an organi-
</p>
<p>zation that relocated their premises (Walker, 
</p>
<p>Thomas, &amp; Verplanken, 2015). A portion of 
</p>
<p>these employees shifted to another commute 
</p>
<p>travel mode after the relocation. Habit strength 
</p>
<p>of the old mode was assessed a year and a half 
</p>
<p>before the relocation, while habit strength of 
</p>
<p>both the old and new mode were monitored after 
</p>
<p>the relocation. These data suggested indeed that 
</p>
<p>while habit strength for the new mode started to 
</p>
<p>build, the old habit did not disappear abruptly, 
</p>
<p>but decayed only gradually during the post-move 
</p>
<p>period (see Fig.&nbsp;5.3). Thus, for a certain amount 
</p>
<p>of time, the presence of the old habit poses the 
</p>
<p>risk of relapses, for instance, if the new behavior 
</p>
<p>is blocked or if the motivation to uphold it 
</p>
<p>weakens.
</p>
<p>A second caveat is that habits may be embed-
</p>
<p>ded in larger routines or social practices (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Kurz, Gardner, Verplanken, &amp; Abraham, 2015). 
</p>
<p>For instance, binge drinking among UK young-
</p>
<p>sters is no isolated behavior, but makes up part of 
</p>
<p>a weekend leisure culture. Approaching such a 
</p>
<p>behavior without taking that wider context into 
</p>
<p>account is missing an important point and is thus 
</p>
<p>likely to fail if behavior change is the objective. 
</p>
<p>A largely unexplored field is the question how 
</p>
<p>habits and social practices relate, for instance, 
</p>
<p>how habits may create social practices and vice 
</p>
<p>versa (e.g., Holtz, 2014).
</p>
<p>A third caveat concerns the power of habits in 
</p>
<p>creating and maintaining new behavior. 
</p>
<p>Compared to the problem of breaking habits, 
</p>
<p>habit formation has received relatively little 
</p>
<p>attention to date, at least in applied areas focused 
</p>
<p>on behavior change (e.g., Lally &amp; Gardner, 
</p>
<p>2013). However, the very features that character-
</p>
<p>ize habits and make them difficult to change&nbsp; &ndash; 
</p>
<p>lack of awareness, the difficulty to avoid a habit, 
</p>
<p>tunnel vision, the disconnection with intentions, 
</p>
<p>and the &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo; of habits&nbsp;&ndash; are all features we 
</p>
<p>would like to see new, desired, behaviors to 
</p>
<p>obtain in order to become durable. Thus, habit 
</p>
<p>formation, and not merely behavior change, 
</p>
<p>should be a key objective in behavior change 
</p>
<p>interventions (e.g., Lally, van Jaarsveld, Potts, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Wardle, 2010).
</p>
<p>Finally, the behaviors we are interested in are 
</p>
<p>often complex and consist of multiple phases and 
</p>
<p>components (e.g., Phillips &amp; Gardner, 2016). 
</p>
<p>For instance, &ldquo;running&rdquo; involves a decision to do 
</p>
<p>it, preparing your running gear, and the actual 
</p>
<p>running. Each of these elements may or may not 
</p>
<p>be habitual. It is thus important to identify the

</p>
<p>critical element that needs to be turned into a 
</p>
<p>habit. In the running example, this probably is the 
</p>
<p>decision to run, rather than the execution itself, as 
</p>
<p>we are very good in finding excuses not to run 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Verplanken &amp; Melkevik, 2008).
</p>
<p> Testing the&nbsp;Habit Discontinuity 
Hypothesis in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Field Experiment
</p>
<p>Bas Verplanken and Deborah Roy (2016) tested 
</p>
<p>the habit discontinuity hypothesis in a field 
</p>
<p>experiment promoting sustainable behaviors 
</p>
<p>among residents in Peterborough (UK), some of 
</p>
<p>whom had recently relocated. The assumption 
</p>
<p>was that relocation disrupted existing habits and 
</p>
<p>opened a &ldquo;window of opportunity&rdquo; for more 
</p>
<p>change. The hypothesis was thus tested that a 
</p>
<p>behavior change intervention would be more 
</p>
<p>effective among those who had relocated com-
</p>
<p>pared to residents who had not moved house.
</p>
<p>The researchers liaised with an organization, 
</p>
<p>the Peterborough Environment City Trust, who 
</p>
<p>previously had developed an intervention to pro-
</p>
<p>mote sustainable behaviors. Members of this 
</p>
<p>organization were trained as research officers to 
</p>
<p>collect the data and deliver a bespoke version of 
</p>
<p>their intervention. Participants were cold- 
</p>
<p>contacted at the doorstep. A total of 8063 contact 
</p>
<p>attempts were made during the day, evenings, 
</p>
<p>and weekends; 1612 individuals were at home 
</p>
<p>and answered the door; 800 individuals agreed to 
</p>
<p>participate in the study. Half of these were known 
</p>
<p>to have moved house within the previous 
</p>
<p>6&nbsp; months (&ldquo;Movers&rdquo;). This information was 
</p>
<p>obtained through property websites and contacts 
</p>
<p>with housing developers. The other half (&ldquo;Non- 
</p>
<p>movers&rdquo;) were matched to the Movers on key 
</p>
<p>characteristics, such as house size, house owner-
</p>
<p>ship, and access to public transport. Movers and 
</p>
<p>Non-movers were assigned to an intervention or 
</p>
<p>no-intervention control group according to a 
</p>
<p>clustered randomization procedure, through 
</p>
<p>which particular areas were designated as inter-
</p>
<p>vention or control areas.
</p>
<p>Data were collected at two points in time. 
</p>
<p>A baseline survey was conducted upon recruit-
</p>
<p>ment. In the intervention condition, this survey 
</p>
<p>served as the basis for a conversation about 
</p>
<p>behavior change (see below). Eight weeks later 
</p>
<p>participants received a second survey by mail, 
</p>
<p>which constituted the post-measure. Participants 
</p>
<p>received a &pound;10.00 cash voucher and a lottery 
</p>
<p>ticket for a &pound;250.00 prize draw for submitting the 
</p>
<p>second survey. A total of 521 (65%) participants 
</p>
<p>completed the study.
</p>
<p>The intervention consisted of a number of 
</p>
<p>elements:
</p>
<p> 1. Doorstep personal interview. Upon agree-
</p>
<p>ment a conversation was held about behaviors 
</p>
<p>participants considered to change or adopt. 
</p>
<p>The research officers were trained to select 
</p>
<p>any from seven possible levers in these con-
</p>
<p>versations: underscore available information; 
</p>
<p>highlight self-efficacy; raise awareness of 
</p>
<p>environmental benefits; stress pro- 
</p>
<p>environmental social norms; spell out finan-
</p>
<p>cial benefits; promote a &ldquo;green identity&rdquo;; 
</p>
<p>pledge to change behavior.
</p>
<p> 2. Tailored information. Shortly after the first 
</p>
<p>survey and the doorstep interview, partici-
</p>
<p>pants received information about the 
</p>
<p>behavior(s) they had shown an interest in to 
</p>
<p>change as revealed during the interview.
</p>
<p> 3. Newsletter. All participants received regular 
</p>
<p>newsletters, which contained generic informa-
</p>
<p>tion and advice related to sustainable behav-
</p>
<p>iors, as well as on current environmental and 
</p>
<p>volunteering projects.
</p>
<p> 4. Sustainable goodie bag. Participants received a 
</p>
<p>bag with free sustainability-related items, such 
</p>
<p>as a cycling path map, bus time tables, a shower 
</p>
<p>timer, and vegetable and flower seeds.
</p>
<p>The main dependent variables were 25 sus-
</p>
<p>tainable behaviors, for instance, related to water 
</p>
<p>use (e.g., taking less than 10&nbsp;minutes showers), 
</p>
<p>energy use (e.g., washing at 30 degrees), trans-
</p>
<p>portation (e.g., ecologically friendly driving), 
</p>
<p>and waste (e.g., using reusable shopping bags). 
</p>
<p>Self-reported frequencies were obtained for 
</p>
<p>each behavior, which were averaged into a 
</p>
<p>behavior index. The behaviors were thus 
</p>
<p>assessed at baseline and 8&nbsp;weeks later. In order 
</p>
<p>to control for effects of other variables, at base-
</p>
<p>line a set of well-researched determinants of 
</p>
<p>behavior were included: habit strength, intention, 
</p>
<p>B. Verplanken and S. Orbell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>75
</p>
<p>perceived control, personal norms, biospheric 
</p>
<p>values, and personal involvement.
</p>
<p>Remember that rather than testing the effec-
</p>
<p>tiveness of an intervention, the objective was to 
</p>
<p>test whether an intervention was more effective in 
</p>
<p>the context of a habit discontinuity (in this case 
</p>
<p>relocation) compared to default conditions. Thus, 
</p>
<p>in the present study, we were interested in the 
</p>
<p>interaction between relocation status (i.e., whether 
</p>
<p>or not a participant had moved house) and the 
</p>
<p>intervention (i.e., intervention versus control 
</p>
<p>group) while controlling for all other effects (i.e., 
</p>
<p>baseline behavioral frequency, demographic vari-
</p>
<p>ables, and all determinants). This was tested in a 
</p>
<p>multiple regression, where the behavioral index in 
</p>
<p>the post-test was regressed on all baseline mea-
</p>
<p>sures, relocation status, intervention, and the all-
</p>
<p>important relocation x intervention interaction. 
</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, baseline behavior and all determi-
</p>
<p>nants were statistically significantly correlated 
</p>
<p>with post-test behavior. From these variables, in 
</p>
<p>the multiple regression baseline behavior, habit 
</p>
<p>strength, and personal involvement obtained a sta-
</p>
<p>tistically significant regression weight, suggesting 
</p>
<p>these variables had a unique contribution in the 
</p>
<p>prediction of post-test behavior. Also, the inter-
</p>
<p>vention obtained a significant regression weight, 
</p>
<p>which suggested it was effective. The important 
</p>
<p>result was a significant relocation x intervention 
</p>
<p>interaction. In Fig.&nbsp; 5.4 simple slopes are pre-
</p>
<p>sented, which graphically show this interaction 
</p>
<p>and suggest that the intervention was only effec-
</p>
<p>tive among Movers.
</p>
<p>We analyzed the data of this study in some 
</p>
<p>more detail, in particular with respect to the ques-
</p>
<p>tion how long the &ldquo;window of opportunity&rdquo; pro-
</p>
<p>vided by relocation would last. In other words, is 
</p>
<p>there an optimal time frame for an intervention 
</p>
<p>that capitalizes on a habit discontinuity? In order 
</p>
<p>to investigate this, we distinguished among 
</p>
<p>Movers participants who had moved within the 
</p>
<p>previous 3&nbsp; months versus 6&nbsp; months. It thus 
</p>
<p>appeared that the intervention was only effective 
</p>
<p>among the former participants, thus suggesting 
</p>
<p>that the &ldquo;window&rdquo; lasted for a period of 3&nbsp;months. 
</p>
<p>A word of caution is necessary though. Firstly, 
</p>
<p>these effects may be highly dependent on the 
</p>
<p>domain, behavior, type of sample, and type of dis-
</p>
<p>continuity. Secondly, habit discontinuities may 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;open&rdquo; a window even before the actual change 
</p>
<p>takes place. For instance, in the case of moving 
</p>
<p>house, the process of &ldquo;unfreezing&rdquo; may start 
</p>
<p>already some time before the actual relocation.
</p>
<p>A field experiment such as the one we 
</p>
<p>described here has many challenges. We mention 
</p>
<p>three that were poignant in the present case. The 
</p>
<p>first concerns a balance between &ldquo;purity&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;realism.&rdquo; In order to test the habit discontinuity 
</p>
<p>hypothesis, ideally we would have liked to have 
</p>
<p>followed a proper randomized controlled trial, 
</p>
<p>that is, a random allocation of participants to 
</p>
<p>both the intervention and relocation conditions. 
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we employed a clustered 
</p>
<p>randomized procedure: the intervention versus 
</p>
<p>no- intervention conditions were assigned on the 
</p>
<p>basis of geographic area. This was done in order

</p>
<p>to prevent neighbors in different conditions 
</p>
<p>talking to each other. As far as relocation was 
</p>
<p> concerned, for obvious reasons &ldquo;moving house&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>cannot be randomly allocated; the best we could 
</p>
<p>do was to match participants on key criteria. 
</p>
<p>Thus, in order to deal with the reality of this 
</p>
<p>context, we had to accept losing some rigor with 
</p>
<p>respect to the design and thus to making causal 
</p>
<p>claims.
</p>
<p>A second challenge was to protect the quality 
</p>
<p>of the data. Field studies can easily become 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;messy,&rdquo; as researchers do not work under con-
</p>
<p>trolled conditions such as can be accomplished in 
</p>
<p>the laboratory. Unexpected things may happen 
</p>
<p>during data multiple research officers, collection 
</p>
<p>or between pre- and post-tests. Also, as we 
</p>
<p>worked with multiple research officers, the data 
</p>
<p>collection and interview procedures were stan-
</p>
<p>dardized and well-trained.
</p>
<p>Finally, the key result was a statistically signifi-
</p>
<p>cant relocation x intervention interaction. 
</p>
<p>However, the effect size was small. There were a 
</p>
<p>number of possible reasons for that. Firstly, habit 
</p>
<p>discontinuity effects may be small, and as the 
</p>
<p>dependent variable was controlled for all major 
</p>
<p>determinants, this may have left little variance to 
</p>
<p>be accounted for. Secondly, while the behavioral 
</p>
<p>index was composed of 25 behaviors, most partici-
</p>
<p>pants probably made changes in only a few of 
</p>
<p>those. The study thus provided a very conservative 
</p>
<p>test. Finally, as discussed above, field studies may 
</p>
<p>produce much &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in the data. Nevertheless, 
</p>
<p>the effect we found was statistically significant 
</p>
<p>and important as &ldquo;proof of concept.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Conclusion
</p>
<p>The habit concept has two faces. On the one hand, 
</p>
<p>we struggle with what we may consider as &ldquo;bad&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>habits, the things we know are unhelpful or 
</p>
<p>unhealthy but difficult to change. But from an 
</p>
<p>evolutionary point of view, our cognitive architec-
</p>
<p>ture made us creatures of habit for good reasons: 
</p>
<p>habits enable us to avoid spending valuable 
</p>
<p>mental resources to trivial decisions. Also, if we 
</p>
<p>manage to turn &ldquo;good&rdquo; behavior into habits, this 
</p>
<p>may help to establish and maintain a better and 
</p>
<p>healthier life. In any case, habits are interesting 
</p>
<p>and are worth a prominent place on the rich pallet 
</p>
<p>of themes in psychology.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Habits are memory-based propensities 
</p>
<p>to respond automatically to specific 
</p>
<p>cues, which are acquired by the repeti-
</p>
<p>tion of cue-specific behaviors in stable 
</p>
<p>contexts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Habituation may lead to &ldquo;tunnel vision,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>that is, a lack of attention to or interest 
</p>
<p>in information about the habit or the 
</p>
<p>habit performance context.
</p>
<p>&bull; Habituation shifts control over behavior 
</p>
<p>from &ldquo;willpower&rdquo; to the contextual cues 
</p>
<p>which trigger the habit.
</p>
<p>&bull; Habits are &ldquo;sticky&rdquo;: even if one chooses 
</p>
<p>to act differently, a habit may easily take 
</p>
<p>over, such as in the form of &ldquo;action 
</p>
<p>slips.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; Habit strength has been measured by 
</p>
<p>means of observation, self-reports, and 
</p>
<p>implicit measures. The Self-Report 
</p>
<p>Habit Index (SRHI) is a prevalent 
</p>
<p>generic 12-item self-report instrument to 
</p>
<p>measure habit strength. The Habit Index 
</p>
<p>of Negative Thinking (HINT) is a variant 
</p>
<p>to measure habits of thinking.
</p>
<p>&bull; Implementation intentions&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;IF-THEN&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>plans which specify where, when, and 
</p>
<p>how to act&nbsp; &ndash; can be used to break old 
</p>
<p>habit cue- response associations and 
</p>
<p>build new ones.
</p>
<p>&bull; The habit discontinuity hypothesis 
</p>
<p>states that behavior change interven-
</p>
<p>tions are more effective if delivered 
</p>
<p>when an individual&rsquo;s performance con-
</p>
<p>text changes or the individual changes 
</p>
<p>from one context to another.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>In summer 2016, a debate over Muslim women&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>beachwear, known as burkini&nbsp;&ndash; a swimwear with 
</p>
<p>body and head coverings&nbsp;&ndash; popped up in France. 
</p>
<p>As a result, three cities restricted women to wear 
</p>
<p>a burkini at the beach. The restriction of these 
</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s freedom to wear a burkini caused mixed 
</p>
<p>reactions, but one was the &ldquo;wear what you want&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>initiative which also spread on social media pic-
</p>
<p>turing Muslim and non-Muslim women with and 
</p>
<p>without burkinis and holding up signs with &ldquo;wear 
</p>
<p>what you want&rdquo; (see Fig.&nbsp;6.1).
</p>
<p>This example illustrates how people often 
</p>
<p>react to threats to their own or another person&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>freedom. They fight against it urging the threat-
</p>
<p>ening agents&nbsp; &ndash; in this case the politicians&nbsp; &ndash; to 
</p>
<p>remove the threat and, thus, restore freedom. The 
</p>
<p>impulse to fight back to freedom restrictions 
</p>
<p>results from the experience of a motivational 
</p>
<p>state called psychological reactance. It is char-
</p>
<p>acterized by a strong desire to restore and secure 
</p>
<p>the threatened freedom and actual attempts to do 
</p>
<p>so (Brehm, 1966; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981).
</p>
<p>However, reactance does not emerge in every 
</p>
<p>freedom-threatening situation. Importantly, only 
</p>
<p>when people view themselves as possessing cer-
</p>
<p>tain free behaviors and when they perceive a 
</p>
<p>threat to those behaviors, reactance emerges. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, people&rsquo;s free behaviors are not only 
</p>
<p>associated with certain expectation but often are

</p>
<p>also connected to own values and attitudes. Thus, 
</p>
<p>free behaviors constitute aspects of people&rsquo;s self. 
</p>
<p>Reactance aims at restoring freedom by shedding 
</p>
<p>light on those aspects. The experience of reac-
</p>
<p>tance therefore leads people to reflect on who 
</p>
<p>they are and what is important to them. Being 
</p>
<p>able to act in accordance with one&rsquo;s self, for 
</p>
<p>example, by expressing one&rsquo;s own opinion, is 
</p>
<p>related to people&rsquo;s identity. It makes them aware 
</p>
<p>of what is important to them, that they are the 
</p>
<p>origin of their actions, and that they are able to 
</p>
<p>act in accordance with their self. Thereby, people 
</p>
<p>experience a sense of autonomy (Deci &amp; Ryan, 
</p>
<p>1985; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000; see also Roth, Ch.&nbsp;3 
</p>
<p>this volume).
</p>
<p>Considering that reactance is not just a simple 
</p>
<p>resistance against social influence attempts helps 
</p>
<p>us to understand why the burkini example trig-
</p>
<p>gers reactions that go beyond the simple question 
</p>
<p>of what clothes are allowed to wear. Freedom 
</p>
<p>threats do not only lead to resistance but also to 
</p>
<p>questions about oneself, one&rsquo;s group, and society, 
</p>
<p>about who we are, and whether one can live in 
</p>
<p>accordance with own values and attitudes.
</p>
<p>The current chapter summarizes psychologi-
</p>
<p>cal reactance theory (Brehm, 1966) which can 
</p>
<p>explain why people sometimes &ldquo;fight back,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>meaning that they do the opposite of what they 
</p>
<p>are supposed to do or resist the social influence of 
</p>
<p>others. Most importantly, it elaborates on the 
</p>
<p>value of reactance by explaining how reactance 
</p>
<p>connects to the self and own important values.

<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Reactance: Reactance results from a (per-
</p>
<p>ceived) threat to freedom. It is &ldquo;a motiva-
</p>
<p>tional state directed toward the 
</p>
<p>re-establishment of the threatened or elimi-
</p>
<p>nated freedom, and it should manifest itself 
</p>
<p>in increased desire to engage in the relevant 
</p>
<p>behavior and actual attempts to engage in it&rdquo;

</p>
<p> Reactance Theory
</p>
<p> Freedom and&nbsp;Threat to&nbsp;Freedom
</p>
<p>Reactance theory (Brehm, 1966; Brehm &amp; 
</p>
<p>Brehm, 1981; for an overview, see Miron &amp; 
</p>
<p>Brehm, 2006; Steindl, Jonas, Sittenthaler, Traut- 
</p>
<p>Mattausch, &amp; Greenberg, 2015) describes what is 
</p>
<p>happening within individuals when they perceive 
</p>
<p>a threat to their freedom. For Brehm, freedom 
</p>
<p>meant &ldquo;&hellip;an individual&rsquo;s belief that he or she can 
</p>
<p>engage in a particular behavior. The freedom can 
</p>
<p>pertain to what one does, how one does it, or 
</p>
<p>when one does it&hellip;&rdquo; (Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981, 
</p>
<p>p.&nbsp; 358). We all expect that we possess certain 
</p>
<p>freedoms, meaning that we can choose between 
</p>
<p>performing and not performing a certain behav-
</p>
<p>ior (Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981). Yet, in many situa-
</p>
<p>tions in our lives, where we initially believed to 
</p>
<p>be free, we suddenly experience that we are not 
</p>
<p>free. For instance, citizens believe to be free in 
</p>
<p>voting for the political party they prefer, but poli-
</p>
<p>ticians try to manipulate them to vote for their 
</p>
<p>platform; employees believe to be free in wearing 
</p>
<p>what they want at work, but the company requires 
</p>
<p>them to show up in business look; children 
</p>
<p>believe to be free in choosing their field of study, 
</p>
<p>but parents pressure them to study medicine; or 
</p>
<p>women believe to be free in wearing what they 
</p>
<p>want at public beaches, but a new law forbids 
</p>
<p>them to wear a burkini. We perceive these situa-
</p>
<p>tions as threats to our freedom when we cannot 
</p>
<p>act as desired, when we feel that &ldquo;some event has 
</p>
<p>increased the difficulty of exercising the freedom 
</p>
<p>in question&rdquo; (Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981, p.&nbsp; 35). 
</p>
<p>Consequently, something inside us generates the 
</p>
<p>impulse to fight back. This &ldquo;something&rdquo; is what 
</p>
<p>we call psychological reactance. Reactance is a 
</p>
<p>motivational state which serves as a motivator to 
</p>
<p>restore or secure the threatened freedom (Brehm, 
</p>
<p>1966; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981). It is a theoretical 
</p>
<p>construct manifested in an increased subjective 
</p>
<p>desire to exercise the threatened freedom&nbsp;&ndash; reac-
tance motivation&nbsp;&ndash; and actual behavioral attempts 
to do so, reactance striving (Brehm, 1966; Brehm &amp; 
Brehm, 1981; Wright, Agatarap, &amp; Mlynski, 
</p>
<p>2015). Thus, the term &ldquo;reactance&rdquo; means both, 
</p>
<p>the subjective and behavioral reactions.
</p>
<p> Reactance Motivation
</p>
<p>Reactance is always accompanied by subjective 
</p>
<p>responses, such as the experience of emotion. 
</p>
<p>People feel uncomfortable, hostile, aggressive, 
</p>
<p>and angry (Berkowitz, 1973; Brehm, 1966; 
</p>
<p>Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981; Dillard &amp; Shen, 2005; 
</p>
<p>Rains, 2013). Another subjective reaction is a 
</p>
<p>change in the attractiveness of the threatened or 
</p>
<p>imposed outcome. People upgrade the restricted 
</p>
<p>option or downgrade the imposed option (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Bijvank, Konijn, Bushman, &amp; Roelofsma, 2009; 
</p>
<p>Brehm, 1966; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981; Bushman 
</p>
<p>&amp; Stack, 1996; Dillard &amp; Shen, 2005). In a clas-
</p>
<p>sic experiment by Brehm, Stires, Sensenig, and 
</p>
<p>Shaban (1966), participants listened to four 
</p>
<p>records and rated how well they liked each of 
</p>
<p>them. They were made to believe that they could 
</p>
<p>choose one of the records as a gift but then 
</p>
<p>learned that one of the records was unavailable. 
</p>
<p>Results revealed that in a second rating, this 
</p>
<p>record increased in its attractiveness. Brehm also 
</p>
<p>mentions that people who are threatened in their 
</p>
<p>freedom become aware of what they really want. 
</p>
<p>They know their desires and goals and feel that 
</p>
<p>they are their own director of behavior (increased 
</p>
<p>self-direction; Brehm, 1966; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 
</p>
<p>1981). Thus, banning the burkini from beaches 
</p>
<p>would lead some women to feel angry, to upgrade 
</p>
<p>the burkini in its attractiveness, and to realize that 
</p>
<p>the freedom to wear what they want is indeed 
</p>
<p>highly important to them.
</p>
<p> Reactance Striving
</p>
<p>Reactance striving can be manifested in exercis-
</p>
<p>ing the threatened freedom (direct restoration), 
</p>
<p>exercising a related behavior or observing others 
</p>
<p>exercising the threatened freedom (indirect resto-
</p>
<p>ration), aggressively forcing the threatening 
</p>
<p>agent to remove the threat, or just letting off 
</p>
<p>steam by reacting in an aggressive way (aggres-
</p>
<p>sion) (Brehm, 1966; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981). For 
</p>
<p>example, forbidding teenagers to go out can lead 
</p>
<p>to the exact opposite behavior (i.e., going out in 
</p>
<p>secret). This is also known as the boomerang 
effect and is the direct restoration of freedom 
</p>
<p>6 Reactance Theory</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>82
</p>
<p>(Brehm, 1966). Not going out but performing a 
</p>
<p>related and also forbidden behavior (e.g., smok-
</p>
<p>ing) would be the indirect restoration of freedom, 
</p>
<p>and shouting at and insulting their parents to get 
</p>
<p>what they want would be the aggressive form of 
</p>
<p>reactance striving. Thus, reactance striving is the 
</p>
<p>visible reaction to freedom threats. But what 
</p>
<p>exactly is reactance motivation itself, can we 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;see&rdquo; it, and how can it be assessed?
</p>
<p> What Is Reactance Motivation: 
Catching the&nbsp;State
</p>
<p>Although Brehm stated that reactance is &ldquo;an 
</p>
<p>intervening, hypothetical variable&rdquo; that cannot be 
</p>
<p>measured directly (Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981, 
</p>
<p>p.&nbsp;37), studies tried to catch reactance motivation 
</p>
<p>with different instruments such as self-report 
</p>
<p>measures and physiological or neuropsychologi-
</p>
<p>cal measures.
</p>
<p> Self-Report Measures
</p>
<p>Some studies have investigated reactance in the 
</p>
<p>context of persuasion (Dillard &amp; Shen, 2005; 
</p>
<p>Kim, Levine, &amp; Allen, 2013; Rains, 2013), as 
</p>
<p>persuasive messages often pose freedom threats 
</p>
<p>to people. Here, reactance has been conceptual-
</p>
<p>ized as a composite of self-reported anger (e.g., 
</p>
<p>irritated, annoyed) and negative cognition in the 
</p>
<p>form of counterarguments. For example, in 
</p>
<p>Dillard and Shen&rsquo;s study (2005), a persuasive 
</p>
<p>message, such as &ldquo;Flossing: It&rsquo;s easy. Do it 
</p>
<p>because you have to!&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;152), led to a negative 
</p>
<p>attitude toward flossing. This relationship could 
</p>
<p>be explained via people&rsquo;s experienced reactance 
</p>
<p>which consisted of anger and negative cogni-
</p>
<p>tions. The negative attitude further predicted peo-
</p>
<p>ple&rsquo;s behavioral intention not to floss.
</p>
<p>Beyond the context of persuasion, studies 
</p>
<p>view people&rsquo;s reactance consisting of their self- 
</p>
<p>reported experience of reactance (e.g., perception 
</p>
<p>of freedom threat), their aggressive behavioral 
</p>
<p>intentions toward the threatening agent (e.g., ruin 
</p>
<p>his/her reputation), and their negative evaluations 
</p>
<p>of the threatening agent (e.g., believing that he/
</p>
<p>she takes advantage of other people) (Salzburg 
</p>
<p>State Reactance Scale; SSR Scale; Sittenthaler, 
</p>
<p>Traut-Mattausch, Steindl, &amp; Jonas, 2015). In 
</p>
<p>these studies, people&rsquo;s experience of reactance is 
</p>
<p>conceptualized as a combination of a perceived 
</p>
<p>threat to their freedom (e.g., &ldquo;How restricted 
</p>
<p>would you feel in your freedom of choice?&rdquo;) and 
</p>
<p>their emotional experience (e.g., &ldquo;How irritated 
</p>
<p>would you feel?&rdquo;). This conceptualization has 
</p>
<p>been used in reactance studies investigating 
</p>
<p>change situations such as political reforms, cul-
</p>
<p>ture, and vicarious reactance and has been shown 
</p>
<p>to explain why people react with resistance or 
</p>
<p>with a negative attitude to restrictions (Sittenthaler 
</p>
<p>&amp; Jonas, 2012; Sittenthaler, Traut-Mattausch, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Jonas, 2015; Traut-Mattausch, Guter, Zanna, 
</p>
<p>Jonas, &amp; Frey, 2011; Traut-Mattausch, Jonas, 
</p>
<p>F&ouml;rg, Frey, &amp; Heinemann, 2008).
</p>
<p> Physiological 
and&nbsp;Neuropsychological Measures
</p>
<p>Guided by Brehm (1966), who noted that reactance 
</p>
<p>should be accompanied by physiological arousal, 
</p>
<p>research assessed people&rsquo;s heart rate following a 
</p>
<p>freedom threat. Results depicted that when people 
</p>
<p>experienced a freedom threat by imagining being 
</p>
<p>restricted from renting a flat, their heart rate 
</p>
<p>increased immediately (Sittenthaler, Jonas, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Traut-Mattausch, 2016, see Box 6.2; Sittenthaler, 
</p>
<p>Steindl, &amp; Jonas, 2015).
</p>
<p>Research has also considered neuropsycho-
</p>
<p>logical parameters to directly measure reactance 
</p>
<p>Box 6.1 Questions for Elaboration

<p>Think about examples in your life where 
</p>

<p>What were your subjective and behavioral

</p>
<p>motivation. By using electroencephalography 
</p>
<p>(EEG), M&uuml;hlberger, Klackl, Sittenthaler, and 
</p>
<p>Jonas (2018) tried to more accurately capture the 
</p>
<p>specific kind of motivation that reactance stimu-
</p>
<p>lates. They looked at a specific indicator of moti-
</p>
<p>vation, namely, left frontal cortical activity. This 
</p>
<p>parameter has been found to relate to approach 
</p>
<p>motivation (e.g., Harmon-Jones, 2003, 2004; 
</p>
<p>Harmon-Jones &amp; Allen, 1998)&nbsp; &ndash; a motivation 
</p>
<p>where people are energized to move toward some-
</p>
<p>thing (Harmon-Jones, Harmon-Jones, &amp; Price, 
</p>
<p>2013; see also Sassenberg &amp; Vliek, Chap. 4 this 
</p>
<p>volume). In this research, inducing reactance in 
</p>
<p>various ways (e.g., imagining being restricted 
</p>
<p>from renting an apartment, remembering own 
</p>
<p>experienced past restrictions, being commanded 
</p>
<p>to draw specific shapes) stimulated immediate 
</p>
<p>relative left frontal activity. This finding under-
</p>
<p>lines Brehm&rsquo;s original definition of reactance as a 
</p>
<p>highly motivational construct by which people are 
</p>
<p>highly motivated to approach the reestablishment 
</p>
<p>of their freedom. Moreover, the neural processes 
</p>
<p>depict that this motivation arises immediately 
</p>
<p>after the threat.
</p>
<p>In summary, reactance motivation can be cap-
</p>
<p>tured by using self-report measures and more 
</p>
<p>directly by physiological and neuropsychological 
</p>
<p>measures. Those measures found that it is a state 
</p>
<p>consisting of a person&rsquo;s experienced threat, his or 
</p>
<p>her emotional experience (e.g., anger), cognitive 
</p>
<p>processes (e.g., negative attitude), and changes in 
</p>
<p>physiological arousal and brain activity.
</p>
<p> The Determinants of&nbsp;Reactance
</p>
<p> Expectation of&nbsp;Freedom, Importance 
of&nbsp;Freedom, and&nbsp;Extent of&nbsp;Threat
</p>
<p>Reactance does not always emerge when people&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>free behaviors are threatened. Its emergence 
</p>
<p>depends on people&rsquo;s initial expectation to possess 
the freedom in question. Thus, reactance emerges 
</p>
<p>only when people believe they possess a specific 
</p>
<p>freedom, i.e., they know they have the freedom to 
</p>
<p>do something and feel they are capable of enacting 
</p>
<p>the behavior. Reactance also varies in its magni-
</p>
<p>tude which depends on the subjective importance 
of the freedom (the more important the free behav-
</p>
<p>ior, the more reactance will be aroused) and the 
</p>
<p>perceived extent of the threat (the more freedoms 
threatened, the more reactance will be aroused) 
</p>
<p>(Brehm, 1966; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981; Wright 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2015). In our example, if women are confi-
</p>
<p>dent to possess the freedom to wear whatever they 
</p>
<p>want at the beach, if the freedom to wear what they 
</p>
<p>want is in general very important to them, and if 
</p>
<p>they perceived the restriction as highly threatening, 
</p>
<p>reactance motivation would be very strong.
</p>
<p> Belief in&nbsp;Ability to&nbsp;Restore Freedom
</p>
<p>Once reactance has been aroused, it provides peo-
</p>
<p>ple with the motivation to fight against the threat 
</p>
<p>and restore their freedom. As such it is an adaptive 
</p>
<p>reaction to freedom threats because when people 
</p>
<p>experience reactance, they feel that they are able to 
</p>
<p>fight for their freedom. Without it, they would 
</p>
<p>accept the restriction. Thus, it is the opposite of 
</p>
<p>learned helplessness (Seligman, 1975) where peo-
</p>
<p>ple do not believe in their ability to alter the 
</p>
<p>unpleasant situation. Helpless people are rather 
</p>
<p>passive, accept the situation as it is, or even with-
</p>
<p>draw from it (Mikulincer, 1988; Pittman &amp; Pittman, 
</p>
<p>1979; Seligman, 1975; Wortman &amp; Brehm, 
</p>
<p>1975). When people experience reactance, they 
</p>
<p>feel capable of altering the situation and restoring 
</p>
<p>their freedom (Brehm &amp; Self, 1989; Wortman &amp; 
</p>
<p>Brehm, 1975; Wright et&nbsp; al., 2015; Wright &amp; 
</p>
<p>Brehm, 1989). Despite the unpleasant situation, 
</p>
<p>they feel in charge of the situation, and they are 
</p>
<p>highly motivated to do something about it. This 
</p>
<p>becomes obvious in a study by Kray, Reb, Galinsky, 
</p>
<p>and Thompson (2004). They hypothesized that 
</p>
<p>reactance also emerges when people perceive a 
</p>
<p>limitation to their ability to perform well in a task. 
</p>
<p>In their study, they threatened women&rsquo;s ability to 
</p>
<p>perform by making them aware of the stereotype 
</p>
<p>that men are better at negotiating than women. As 
</p>
<p>a result, women reacted against this stereotype by 
</p>
<p>achieving better negotiating outcomes than men. 
</p>
<p>6 Reactance Theory</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84
</p>
<p>However, this so-called stereotype reactance only 
</p>
<p>occurred for women when they possessed suffi-
</p>
<p>cient power to act against the stereotype. When 
</p>
<p>they did not have sufficient power, they followed 
</p>
<p>the stereotype by performing worse than men. 
</p>
<p>This is in accordance with the assumption that 
</p>
<p>reactance only emerges when people feel capable 
</p>
<p>of altering the current situation.
</p>
<p> Vicarious Reactance and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Self
</p>
<p>How people respond to freedom threats strongly 
</p>
<p>depends on whether the threat affects important 
</p>
<p>aspects of their self. This becomes apparent in 
</p>
<p>research on vicarious reactance (i.e., reactance in 
</p>
<p>response to freedom threats experienced by oth-
</p>
<p>ers). We can also experience reactance when oth-
</p>
<p>ers&rsquo; freedom is challenged. For instance, people 
</p>
<p>who observed or read about a freedom threat hap-
</p>
<p>pening to another person also indicated strong 
</p>
<p>reactance (Andreoli, Worchel, &amp; Folger, 1974; 
</p>
<p>Sittenthaler et&nbsp; al., 2016; Sittenthaler &amp; Jonas, 
</p>
<p>2012; Sittenthaler, Traut-Mattausch, &amp; Jonas, 
</p>
<p>2015). Think of the burkini example. Although 
</p>
<p>the ban affected only women who usually wear a 
</p>
<p>burkini, women all over the world wearing or not 
</p>
<p>wearing a burkini at the beach engaged in the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;wear what you want&rdquo; discussion. Research has 
</p>
<p>shown that both kinds of freedom threats (self- 
</p>
<p>experienced and vicarious) lead people to experi-
</p>
<p>ence reactance, but whether people react more to 
</p>
<p>a self-experienced or to a vicariously experienced 
</p>
<p>threat depends on how they define their self and 
</p>
<p>whether the threat affects important aspects of 
</p>
<p>their self.
</p>
<p>A factor shaping people&rsquo;s self is their cultural 
</p>
<p>background. People from individualistic cultures, 
</p>
<p>such as America and Western Europe, define their 
</p>
<p>self by emphasizing their individuality and inde-
</p>
<p>pendence from others (Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991). 
</p>
<p>People from collectivistic cultures, such as Asia, 
</p>
<p>Africa, Latin America, or Southern Europe, define 
</p>
<p>their self in relationships and commonalities with 
</p>
<p>others (Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991). A number of 
</p>
<p>studies (Jonas et&nbsp;al., 2009; Sittenthaler &amp; Jonas, 
</p>
<p>2012; Sittenthaler, Traut-Mattausch, &amp; Jonas, 
</p>
<p>2015; Steindl &amp; Jonas, 2012) found that people 
</p>
<p>with an independent self- concept experienced 
</p>
<p>more reactance when their individual, personal 
</p>
<p>freedom was threatened, while people with an 
</p>
<p>interdependent self-concept experienced more 
</p>
<p>reactance when a collective freedom or another 
</p>
<p>person was threatened. Thus, compared to people 
</p>
<p>with an independent self- concept, people with an 
</p>
<p>interdependent self- construal experience more 
</p>
<p>vicarious reactance.
</p>
<p>People experience both self-experienced and 
</p>
<p>vicarious reactance, but the processes underlying 
</p>
<p>them differ&nbsp; &ndash; a freedom threat happening to 
</p>
<p>oneself seems to evoke reactions that are more 
</p>
<p>impulsive in nature, and a freedom threat happen-
</p>
<p>ing to another person seems to evoke reactions 
</p>
<p>that are more reflective in nature. This becomes 
</p>
<p>apparent in people&rsquo;s physiological and emotional- 
</p>
<p>cognitive responses: while people who were 
</p>
<p>restricted themselves showed an immediate 
</p>
<p>change in heart rate and more emotional thoughts 
</p>
<p>(e.g., annoyed, excited), people who were vicari-
</p>
<p>ously restricted showed a delayed change in heart 
</p>
<p>rate and more cognitive thoughts (e.g., reasons 
</p>
<p>for freedom restriction; Sittenthaler et&nbsp;al., 2016; 
</p>
<p>for details see Box 6.2).
</p>
<p>In summary, reactance emerges when people 
</p>
<p>believe they possess the freedom that is threat-
</p>
<p>ened, when this freedom is important to them, 
</p>
<p>when the perceived extent of the freedom threat 
</p>
<p>is high, and when they feel capable of restoring 
</p>
<p>their freedom. Whether reactance emerges or not 
</p>
<p>also depends on people&rsquo;s self, which contains 
</p>
<p>important values, interests, and goals. This can 
</p>
<p>explain why observing another person being 
</p>
<p>threatened in his or her freedom can also elicit 
</p>
<p>reactance.

<p>Box 6.2 Zooming In: Study on Vicarious 
</p>
<p>Reactance
</p>
<p>Sittenthaler et&nbsp; al. (2016) proposed a process 
</p>
<p>model to explain the mechanisms underlying 
</p>
<p>self- and vicarious reactance. They hypothe-
</p>
<p>sized that a freedom threat affecting a person 
</p>
<p>directly (self-restriction) should result in a 
</p>
<p>spontaneous physiological reaction. In con-
</p>
<p>trast, observing another person being threat-
</p>
<p>ened (vicarious restriction) should result in a 
</p>
<p>delayed physiological reaction because people 
</p>
<p>first need to reflect on the situation as they do 
</p>
<p>not experience it themselves. They tested this 
</p>
<p>idea in a study on 129 students (Study 2) who 
</p>
<p>came to the laboratory and were attached sen-
</p>
<p>sors to measure skin conductance (SC) and 
</p>
<p>heart rate (HR). First, there was a 3-minute 
</p>
<p>baseline measure. Next, participants read a 
</p>
<p>scenario in which a student attempted to rent 
</p>
<p>an apartment. For 3 minutes, they either imag-
</p>
<p>ined a self-restriction, a vicarious restriction, 
</p>
<p>or a neutral situation. In the self-restriction, the 
</p>
<p>student called the landlord about an appoint-
</p>
<p>ment for viewing the apartment. When the 
</p>
<p>landlord learned that he was talking to a stu-
</p>
<p>dent, he said &ldquo;No, you are a student, you won&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>get this apartment&rdquo; and broke off the call. In 
</p>
<p>the vicarious restriction, participants were 
</p>
<p>asked to think about a former classmate who 
</p>
<p>experienced the situation. Participants in the 
</p>
<p>control condition were asked to imagine that 
</p>
<p>they could rent the apartment. Finally, partici-
</p>
<p>pants answered items assessing their reactance 
</p>
<p>(e.g., &ldquo;To what extent do you perceive the reac-
</p>
<p>tion of the landlord as a restriction of free-
</p>
<p>dom?&rdquo;). These items revealed that participants 
</p>
<p>in the self- as well as the vicarious restriction 
</p>
<p>condition showed higher values than partici-
</p>
<p>pants in the control condition, indicating that 
</p>
<p>the mere observance of a person being 
</p>
<p>restricted resulted in self-reported reactance. 
</p>
<p>However, the main dependent variable was the 
</p>
<p>differences between participants&rsquo; HR during 
</p>
<p>imagining the scenario and during the baseline 
</p>
<p>(immediate response), and their HR during 
</p>
<p>answering the reactance items and during the 
</p>
<p>baseline (delayed response) served as the main 
</p>
<p>dependent variables. Importantly, the physio-
</p>
<p>logical results revealed that compared to the 
</p>
<p>vicarious and the control condition, partici-
</p>
<p>pants in the self-restriction showed the highest 
</p>
<p>HR for the immediate response. The vicarious 
</p>
<p>restriction condition showed a higher HR for 
</p>
<p>the delayed than for the immediate response. 
</p>
<p>These findings suggest that different processes 
</p>
<p>underlie self-experienced vs. vicarious restric-
</p>
<p>tions: self-restrictions result in an immediate 
</p>
<p>physiological arousal and, thus, a more impul-
</p>
<p>sive process, whereas vicarious restrictions 
</p>
<p>result in a delayed physiological arousal and, 
</p>
<p>thus, a more reflective process (Fig.&nbsp;6.2).

</p>
<p> Reactance, What for?: Applications
</p>
<p>Building on the inception of reactance theory 
</p>
<p>where Brehm emphasized that reactance is a 
</p>
<p>highly motivational construct, with this section, 
</p>
<p>we aim to demonstrate the value of reactance. 
</p>
<p>Brehm noted that &ldquo;reactance is defined not sim-
</p>
<p>ply as an unpleasant tension [&hellip;] but rather a 
</p>
<p>motivational state with a specific direction, 
</p>
<p>namely, the recovery of freedom&rdquo; (Brehm, 1966, 
</p>
<p>p.&nbsp; 11). With its &ldquo;energizing and behavior- 
</p>
<p>directing properties&rdquo; (Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981, 
</p>
<p>p.&nbsp;98), reactance gives people the energy to resist 
</p>
<p>what they do not want and turn to what they 
</p>
<p>indeed want. Thereby people resist social influ-
</p>
<p>ence when it is too strong. According to 
</p>
<p>Dickenberger and Gniech (1982), social influ-
</p>
<p>ence attempts at first result in conformity motiva-
</p>
<p>tion (i.e., people adjust to the influence). As the 
</p>
<p>social influence attempt gets stronger, conformity 
</p>
<p>increases up to the point where the person 
</p>
<p> perceives the influence attempt as freedom- 
</p>
<p>threatening. Then a second motivation emerges&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>reactance&nbsp;&ndash; which is manifested in resistance to 
</p>
<p>the influence attempt. The more freedom-threat-
</p>
<p>ening the person experiences the influence, the 
</p>
<p>more reactance people experience. A field study 
</p>
<p>by Heilman (1976) shows that people&rsquo;s resistance 
</p>
<p>increases with an increased intensity of the influ-
</p>
<p>ence attempt (see detailed description of the 
</p>
<p>study below). Such resistance behavior also 
</p>
<p>becomes evident in a large body of research on 
</p>
<p>persuasion as persuasive attempts often elicit 
some reactance.
</p>
<p> Persuasion Research
</p>
<p>Non-smoking messages, clinical advice, dietary 
</p>
<p>restrictions, or mandatory policies to mitigate 
</p>
<p>environmental problems stimulate reactance and 
</p>
<p>increase the non-desired behavior. For example, a 
</p>
<p>study by Ungar, Sieverding, Schweizer, and 
</p>
<p>Stadnitski (2015) showed that people who were 
</p>
<p>given an intervention to eat five portions of fruit 
</p>
<p>and vegetables per day showed high reactance 
</p>
<p>immediately after and still 1 week after the inter-
</p>
<p>vention. This reactance negatively influenced 
</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s attitude toward eating five portions of 
</p>
<p>fruit and vegetables which predicted a lower con-
</p>
<p>sumption of fruit and vegetables even 4 months 
</p>
<p>later. Similarly, forcing people to give up smok-
</p>
<p>ing can have the opposite effect (Erceg-Hurn &amp; 
</p>
<p>Steed, 2011; Grandpre, Alvaro, Burgoon, Miller, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Hall, 2003; Shoham, Trost, &amp; Rohrbaugh, 
</p>
<p>2004). These studies show that even small inter-
</p>
<p>ventions can evoke reactance and consequently 
</p>
<p>miss their well-intentioned recommendations.
</p>
<p>Persuasion attempts also lead to the opposite 
</p>
<p>effects in relationships. Prohibiting the partner to 
</p>
<p>drink or smoke can trigger reactance and conse-
</p>
<p>quently be counterproductive (Shoham et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2004). Similarly, preventing one&rsquo;s partner from 
</p>
<p>attending to attractive alternative partners can 
</p>
<p>make those alternatives even more attractive. 
</p>
<p>DeWall, Maner, Deckman, and Rouby (2011) 
</p>
<p>showed that implicitly limiting participants&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>attention to attractive pictures of the other sex 
</p>
<p>results in lower satisfaction with and commit-
</p>
<p>ment to their actual relationship and an increased 
</p>
<p>positive attitude toward infidelity. Thus, the com-
</p>
<p>munication and behavior in romantic relation-
</p>
<p>ships can benefit from studies on relationship 
</p>
<p>reactance.
</p>
<p> Reduction of&nbsp;Reactance
</p>
<p>In the above examples, reactance is something 
</p>
<p>undesirable that people who design interventions 
</p>
<p>or try to persuade others strive to reduce. Thus, 
</p>
<p>research has tested methods to reduce or elimi-
</p>
<p>nate reactance. For example, taking the perspec-
</p>
<p>tive of the threatening agent to think about 
</p>
<p>reasons for the threat (Steindl &amp; Jonas, 2012), 
</p>
<p>helping people realize that they are free to decide 
</p>
<p>for themselves (Bessarabova, Fink, &amp; Turner, 
</p>
<p>2013; Miller et&nbsp;al., 2007), or forewarning them of 
</p>
<p>a potential freedom threat (Richards &amp; Banas, 
</p>
<p>2015) can reduce or prevent reactance.
</p>
<p>A method to achieve public acceptance of 
</p>
<p>mandatory actions was tested in a study by Uhl- 
</p>
<p>H&auml;dicke, Klackl, M&uuml;hlberger, and Jonas (2018).

<p>most aimed at protecting the environment (e.g., 
</p>
<p>collecting plastic bottles at the university). When 
</p>
<p>they watched a movie about the pollution of the 
</p>
<p>sea by plastic garbage, participants evaluated the 
</p>
<p>mandatory actions to help in protecting the envi-
</p>
<p>ronment more positively when they imagined 
</p>
<p>themselves in the position of an individual suffer-
</p>
<p>ing from the situation than when they imagined 
</p>
<p>the individual suffering from the situation.
</p>
<p>For people who try to convince others, reactance 
</p>
<p>is undesirable. However, for those who experi-
</p>
<p>ence reactance, it might be something desirable. 
</p>
<p>The arising reactance can support people in fight-
</p>
<p>ing for their values and desires (i.e., for their 
</p>
<p>identity). As such, reactance can not only be dis-
</p>
<p>missed as something negative but rather as a con-
</p>
<p>struct possessing a massive motivational force 
</p>
<p>which makes people become clear about impor-
</p>
<p>tant aspects of their self and which provides them 
with energy to fight for those aspects. In the next 
</p>
<p>section, we elaborate on these ideas.
</p>
<p> The Motivational Force of&nbsp;Reactance: 
Self-Direction
</p>
<p>For recommendations that aim at increasing peo-
</p>
<p>ple&rsquo;s health, most would agree that reactance is 
</p>
<p>something undesirable that should be prevented. 
</p>
<p>However, there are situations where reactance is 
</p>
<p>considered something desirable and is even made 
</p>
<p>use of. In paradoxical interventions, behavior 
</p>
<p>change is attempted by using directives that dis-
</p>
<p>courage from it (for an overview, see Miron &amp; 
</p>
<p>Brehm, 2006). For instance, in a study attempting 
</p>
<p>to reduce procrastination (Shoham-Salomon, 
</p>
<p>Avner, &amp; Neeman, 1989), students were told to 
</p>
<p>concentrate on producing procrastination (e.g., 
</p>
<p>sitting in front of the study material but resist 
</p>
<p>studying). Those students high on initial reac-
</p>
<p>tance increased their effective study time more 
</p>
<p>than those low on initial reactance. Thus, encour-
</p>
<p>aging reactance arousal may sometimes lead to 
</p>
<p>the opposite effect. Looking at the findings in a 
</p>
<p>different light, the emerging reactance might 
</p>
<p>have supported students in returning to what they 
</p>
<p>actually wanted, namely, studying. Brehm calls 
</p>
<p>that increased self-direction (Brehm, 1966; 
Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981). A person experiencing 
</p>
<p>reactance &ldquo;will feel that he can do what he wants, 
</p>
<p>that he does not have to do what he doesn&rsquo;t want, 
</p>
<p>and that at least in regard to the freedom in ques-
</p>
<p>tion, he is the sole director of his own behavior&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Brehm, 1966, p.&nbsp;9). It makes people realize what 
</p>
<p>they want; they become aware of their priorities.
</p>
<p>This increased self-direction was also demon-
</p>
<p>strated in a study by De Lemus, Bukowski, 
</p>
<p>Spears, and Telga (2015). They found that women 
</p>
<p>who were confronted with stereotypes contra-
</p>
<p>dicting their social identity seemed to be threat-
</p>
<p>ened in their freedom and consequently showed 
</p>
<p>reactant responses&nbsp;&ndash; traditional women supported 
</p>
<p>a gender-specific system even more when they 
</p>
<p>were confronted with examples of less traditional 
</p>
<p>(counter-stereotypic) women than when they 
</p>
<p>were confronted with examples of traditional 
</p>
<p>(stereotypic) women. In this example, reactance 
</p>
<p>may have provided those women with the moti-
</p>
<p>vation to defend their self containing own impor-
</p>
<p>tant values, attitudes, and interests. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>think back of the burkini example in the begin-
</p>
<p>ning. Here, reactance might have provided 
</p>
<p>women with the motivation to fight against the 
</p>
<p>ban. Without reactance, they might have given up 
</p>
<p>and accepted the situation as it is. In line with 
</p>
<p>that, reactance is associated not just with negative 
</p>
<p>affect, such as feeling angry or uncomfortable, 
</p>
<p>but even with activating positive affect, such as 
</p>
<p>feeling strong and determined (Sittenthaler, 
</p>
<p>Steindl et al., 2015). The consequences of such 
</p>
<p>positive affect have been shown in research on 
</p>
<p>reactance and information search (for a summary, 
</p>
<p>see M&uuml;hlberger, Jonas, &amp; Sittenthaler, 2017). In 
</p>
<p>two studies, restricted participants who felt

</p>
<p>strong and determined behaved in a more open-
</p>
<p>minded way&nbsp; &ndash; they did not further stick to the 
</p>
<p>restricted freedom but were interested in alter-
</p>
<p>natives serving their overarching goal which had 
</p>
<p>been blocked by the threat.
</p>
<p> Autonomy
</p>
<p>Becoming aware of one&rsquo;s self and acting in 
</p>
<p>accordance with it resembles the concept of 
</p>
<p>autonomy as defined within Self-Determination 
</p>
<p>Theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985; Ryan &amp; Deci, 
</p>
<p>2000; see Roth, Chap. 3 this volume). Autonomy 
</p>
<p>is a basic psychological need and best described 
</p>
<p>as a person&rsquo;s desire to be self-governed. People 
</p>
<p>are considered autonomous when they experi-
</p>
<p>ence themselves as the origin of their actions and 
</p>
<p>behave in accordance with their self (Deci &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ryan, 1985; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000). This descrip-
</p>
<p>tion of autonomy has been called reflective 
autonomy (Koestner &amp; Losier, 1996). Researchers 
differentiate it from reactive autonomy where 
people resist coercion just to be independent and 
</p>
<p>free from others and which has been equated with 
</p>
<p>reactance (Koestner &amp; Losier, 1996). Although 
</p>
<p>freedom threats trigger reactance in the form of a 
</p>
<p>reactive autonomy, following Brehm&rsquo;s (Brehm &amp; 
</p>
<p>Brehm, 1981) statement that through reactance it 
</p>
<p>becomes clear what we want, some freedom 
</p>
<p>threats may also trigger reflective autonomy. 
</p>
<p>People desire to be autonomous&nbsp;&ndash; they want to be 
</p>
<p>their own director of behavior and to behave in 
</p>
<p>accordance with their self. To follow this desire, 
</p>
<p>behaving freely is important. When freedom 
</p>
<p>threats block the desire to be autonomous, it 
</p>
<p>becomes even more important for us to know who 
</p>
<p>we are, what we want, and what we do not want.
</p>
<p>Leander et&nbsp;al. (2016) follow this idea and note 
</p>
<p>that reactance is not just a reflex but rather an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to enhance one&rsquo;s autonomy by hav-
</p>
<p>ing the freedom to choose between engaging and 
</p>
<p>not engaging in the prohibited behavior. They 
</p>
<p>showed that individuals did not simply react 
</p>
<p>against every influence but reacted against influ-
</p>
<p>ence when they could infer that they thereby 
</p>
<p>received autonomy. The authors conclude that the 
</p>
<p>superordinate goal served by reactance is auton-
</p>
<p>omy and not just any kind of freedom restoration. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, some freedom threats may stimulate 
</p>
<p>autonomy, especially those threatening important 
</p>
<p>aspects of one&rsquo;s self. Evidence that people only 
</p>
<p>show reactance to self-relevant threats comes 
</p>
<p>from Laurin, Kay, and Fitzsimons (2012). They 
</p>
<p>investigated under which conditions people 
</p>
<p>accept a freedom restriction and under which 
</p>
<p>they resist it. They hypothesized that when a 
</p>
<p>restriction is absolute, people attach less impor-
</p>
<p>tance to the freedom and, thus, rationalize it. In 
</p>
<p>contrast, when the restriction is not absolute but 
</p>
<p>there is a chance that it will not come into effect, 
</p>
<p>people attach more importance to the freedom 
</p>
<p>and, thus, show reactance. Moreover, rationaliza-
</p>
<p>tion and reactance should only emerge when 
</p>
<p>people view the restriction as self-relevant. They 
</p>
<p>argued that people &ldquo;should feel no motivation to 
</p>
<p>protect rights that they do not exercise, nor to 
</p>
<p>adapt to new restrictions that do not affect them&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Laurin et&nbsp; al., 2012, p.&nbsp; 206). In two studies, 
</p>
<p> participants read about dangerous riding situa-
</p>
<p>tions (high speed in cities, cell phone use while 
</p>
<p>driving). In addition, some participants read 
</p>
<p>about a new law that would restrict people in 
</p>
<p>their driving habits (reduced speed limits, cell 
</p>
<p>phone ban while driving). This law was described 
</p>
<p>as definite (absolute condition) or as coming into 
</p>
<p>effect only if enough government officials agreed 
</p>
<p>(non- absolute condition). A control group did not 
</p>
<p>receive any information on implementing the 
</p>
<p>law. Results indicated that people who read about 
</p>
<p>an absolute restriction reported a more positive 
</p>
<p>attitude toward the new law than the control 
</p>
<p>group (rationalization) and those who read about 
</p>
<p>a non-absolute restriction reported a less positive 
</p>
<p>attitude toward the new law than the control 
</p>
<p>group (reactance). Both effects were strongest 
</p>
<p>when the restriction was self-relevant, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, when people were frequent drivers.
</p>
<p>Summarized, people do not reflexively show 
</p>
<p>reactance to any kind of freedom threat but only to 
</p>
<p>self-relevant threats and thereby may receive 
</p>
<p>autonomy. Whether autonomy is indeed the super-
</p>
<p>ordinate goal of reactance is an open question that 
</p>
<p>remains to be tested.

<p> The Effect of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Intensity 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Social Influence Attempt 
on&nbsp;People&rsquo;s Reactance Striving: 
A&nbsp;Field Study
</p>
<p>A field study by Heilman (1976) investigated the 
</p>
<p>behavioral dynamics of reactance and predicted 
</p>
<p>that people&rsquo;s resistance to an influence attempt 
</p>
<p>(reactance striving) increases with the intensity 
</p>
<p>of the influence attempt. Moreover, the author 
</p>
<p>predicted that under certain conditions, i.e., when 
</p>
<p>the threatening agent has the power to implement 
</p>
<p>retaliation for noncompliance, resistance behav-
</p>
<p>ior is reduced. These hypotheses were tested in 
</p>
<p>two experiments in which pedestrians were inter-
</p>
<p>cepted in front of a supermarket in New&nbsp; York 
</p>
<p>City. The experimenter explained that she was 
</p>
<p>collecting signatures for a petition advocating 
</p>
<p>price controls for meats and vegetables. She 
</p>
<p>showed pedestrians a clipboard with the petition 
</p>
<p>and an index card which contained the experi-
</p>
<p>mental induction. The card contained either a 
</p>
<p>low-pressure influence attempt (&ldquo;Raymond 
</p>
<p>T.&nbsp;Finster&hellip; has spoken out against this resolu-
</p>
<p>tion and claims that it would endanger the econ-
</p>
<p>omy&rdquo;), a high-pressure influence attempt (adding 
</p>
<p>that Mr. Finster &ldquo;&hellip;has said that people abso-
</p>
<p>lutely should not be allowed to distribute or sign 
</p>
<p>such petitions&rdquo;), or an additional retaliation threat 
</p>
<p>added to the high-pressure influence attempt 
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;He also said that careful note will be taken of 
</p>
<p>all who do sign&rdquo;). In Experiment 1 (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;360), Mr. 
Finster was either described as a local official 
</p>
<p>(low-power authority) or a top-level federal offi-
</p>
<p>cial (high-power authority). Thus, Experiment 1 
</p>
<p>was based on a 3 (low pressure vs. high pressure 
</p>
<p>vs. high pressure and retaliation)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2 (low power 
</p>
<p>vs. high power) between-subjects design with 60 
</p>
<p>participants for each of the 6 experimental condi-
</p>
<p>tions. Participants were randomly assigned to one 
</p>
<p>condition. Based on reactance theory, the author 
</p>
<p>predicted that an increase in pressure not to sign 
</p>
<p>the petition results in an increased signing. When 
</p>
<p>the agent threatens people by retaliation for sign-
</p>
<p>ing, signing should increase but only when the 
</p>
<p>agent is presented as possessing low power. 
</p>
<p>When the agent is presented as possessing high 
</p>
<p>power and, thus, is able to implement retaliation, 
</p>
<p>signing should decrease.
</p>
<p>In line with the hypotheses, the higher the pres-
</p>
<p>sure not to sign the petition, the more participants 
</p>
<p>signed it. However, these results occurred only 
</p>
<p>when participants were reading statements from a 
</p>
<p>low-power authority. When they were reading 
</p>
<p>statements from a high-power authority, more par-
</p>
<p>ticipants signed the petition in the high- than in the 
</p>
<p>low-pressure condition, but fewer participants 
</p>
<p>signed the petition in the retaliation than in the 
</p>
<p>low- or high-pressure condition (Table&nbsp;6.1).
</p>
<p>In Experiment 1, the agent&rsquo;s capability to 
</p>
<p>retaliate was manipulated by presenting him as

</p>
<p>Think of examples where reactance may be 
</p>
<p>something desirable. Did you experience 
</p>
<p>such situations yourself?
</p>
<p>Despite a host of studies, reactance has 
</p>
<p>often been investigated in the laboratory 
</p>
<p>where people had to imagine freedom- 
</p>
<p>threatening situations and had to self-report 
</p>
<p>their experienced reactance and intended 
</p>
<p>behavior. Only a few studies explored reac-
</p>
<p>tance beyond the laboratory. One example 
</p>
<p>for a field study is presented in the next 
</p>
<p>section.

</p>
<p>possessing high power. In Experiment 2 
</p>
<p>(N&nbsp; =&nbsp; 300), the author predicted that the agent 
would be perceived as being capable to retaliate 
</p>
<p>only when the participant&rsquo;s identity was known. 
</p>
<p>Thus, Experiment 2 was based on a 3 (low pres-
</p>
<p>sure vs. high pressure vs. high pressure and retal-
</p>
<p>iation)&nbsp; &times;&nbsp; 2 (non-anonymous vs. anonymous) 
</p>
<p>between-subjects design with 50 participants for 
</p>
<p>each of the 6 experimental conditions. Participants 
</p>
<p>received the index card containing the low- 
</p>
<p>pressure, high-pressure, or high-pressure and 
</p>
<p>retaliation information, but Mr. Finster was 
</p>
<p>always described as a top-level federal official 
</p>
<p>(high power). As a second condition, the author 
</p>
<p>varied whether participants could remain anony-
</p>
<p>mous. One half of the participants was required 
</p>
<p>to sign the petition (non-anonymous; same con-
</p>
<p>dition as &ldquo;high power&rdquo; in Experiment 1), and the 
</p>
<p>other half was told that their signature was not 
</p>
<p>necessary but that they should vaguely indicate 
</p>
<p>where they lived (anonymous). Participants were 
</p>
<p>randomly assigned to one condition.
</p>
<p>The results showed the same pattern as 
</p>
<p>Experiment 1 for the non-anonymous condition&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>more participants signed the petition when the 
</p>
<p>social influence attempt increased from low to 
</p>
<p>high pressure. When there was a retaliation 
</p>
<p>threat, fewer participants signed. When people 
</p>
<p>could remain anonymous, people&rsquo;s signing rate 
</p>
<p>was high in all three conditions (Table&nbsp;6.2).
</p>
<p>The findings by Heilman (1976) provide sup-
</p>
<p>port for the hypothesis that reactance striving 
</p>
<p>plays a key role when people are externally pres-
</p>
<p>sured to refrain from doing something. They 
</p>
<p>seem to do the opposite of what they are told, 
</p>
<p>which is also known as the boomerang effect. 
</p>
<p>The two experiments are carefully conducted 
</p>
<p>field studies with a well-structured procedure and 
</p>
<p>the measure of actual behavior. Furthermore, in a 
</p>
<p>pilot work, an issue which was important and 
</p>
<p>believable for the population of New&nbsp;York City 
</p>
<p>was selected, and randomizing the materials 
</p>
<p>beforehand made the experimenter blind to the 
</p>
<p>experimental condition. Although field experi-
</p>
<p>ments are able to observe real behavior, they 
</p>
<p>often cannot explore the underlying mechanisms 
</p>
<p>for the behavior. Consequently, we do not know 
</p>
<p>whether reactance motivation, i.e., the increased 
</p>
<p>desire to engage in the relevant behavior, is 
</p>
<p>indeed the underlying mechanism leading to the 
</p>
<p>boomerang effect. For testing such mediating 
</p>
<p>variables, a self-report measure assessing, for 
</p>
<p>example, anger and counterarguments (Dillard &amp; 
</p>
<p>Shen, 2005) or experience of reactance (SSR 
</p>
<p>Scale; Sittenthaler, Traut-Mattausch, Steindl 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2015) could have been handed to partici-
</p>
<p>pants after signing the petition.
</p>
<p>Summarized, the findings of the study indicate 
</p>
<p>important implications for real-life situations. 
</p>
<p>They underline that social influence attempts and 
</p>
<p>especially the way in which we communicate can 
</p>
<p>lead to the opposite of what we aimed at. This is 
</p>
<p>supported by a number of reactance studies (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Dillard &amp; Shen, 2005; Erceg-Hurn &amp; Steed, 
</p>
<p>2011; Grandpre et&nbsp;al., 2003; Shoham et&nbsp;al., 2004; 
</p>
<p>Ungar et&nbsp; al., 2015) which also report actual or 
</p>
<p>intended boomerang effects. At the same time, 
</p>
<p>the study points at boundary conditions of reac-
</p>
<p>tance. An agent&rsquo;s power to implement retaliation 
</p>
<p>for noncompliance seems to counteract reactance 
</p>
<p>motivation and leads to increased compliance but 
</p>
<p>only when a person cannot remain anonymous.
</p>
<p> The Value of&nbsp;Reactance
</p>
<p>Finally, why is it important to know that there is 
</p>
<p>a construct named reactance? Reactance is a 
</p>
<p>common and natural reaction to threats present in 
</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s life. We need to understand reactance

<p>Brehm&rsquo;s emphasis on the motivational side of

<p>reactance, reactance can be beneficial: it plays a

<p> 1. Q (With Box 6.1): Think about examples in 
</p>
<p>your life where you believed that you are free 
</p>
<p>but then were restricted in this freedom. Did 
</p>
<p>you experience reactance? How did you react? 
</p>
<p>What were your subjective and behavioral 
</p>
<p>reactions?
</p>
<p>A: With subjective reactions, we mean what 
</p>
<p>emotions you felt and whether you liked the 
</p>
<p>restricted freedom more because of the restric-
</p>
<p>tion (attractiveness change). With behavioral 
</p>
<p>reactions, we mean what you did in order to 
</p>
<p>restore the threatened freedom.
</p>
<p> 2. Q (With Box 6.3): Imagine that you are a 
</p>
<p>politician trying to convince people of a new 
</p>
<p>highway regulation that forces drivers to 
</p>
<p>adhere to a speed limit of 80&nbsp;km/h although it 
</p>
<p>has always been 100&nbsp;km/h. How would you 
</p>
<p>handle it? What could you do to prevent 
</p>
<p>reactance?
</p>
<p>A: To prevent reactance, research has tested dif-
</p>
<p>ferent methods such as perspective taking, fore-
</p>
<p>warning of a threat, or helping people realize 
</p>
<p>that they are free to decide for themselves. Try 
</p>
<p>to use those methods in your attempt to con-
</p>
<p>vince people of the new regulation.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; People believe they possess certain free-
</p>
<p>doms. When these freedoms are threat-
</p>
<p>ened, they can experience psychological 
</p>
<p>reactance, a motivational state charac-
</p>
<p>terized by the strong desire to restore 
</p>
<p>freedom and actual behavioral attempts 
</p>
<p>to do so.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reactance is manifested in reactance 
</p>
<p>motivation and reactance striving.
</p>
<p>&bull; Attempts to measure reactance have 
</p>
<p>found that it consists of an experience of 
</p>
<p>threat, an emotional experience, cogni-
</p>
<p>tive processes, and changes in physio-
</p>
<p>logical arousal and brain activity.
</p>
<p>&bull; The emergence of reactance depends on 
</p>
<p>the importance of the threatened free-
</p>
<p>dom, the perceived extent of the free-
</p>
<p>dom threat, and people&rsquo;s experienced 
</p>
<p>ability of restoring the freedom.
</p>
<p>&bull; People can also experience reactance on 
</p>
<p>behalf of another person (vicarious 
</p>
<p>reactance).
</p>
<p>&bull; Reactance is not negative per se but 
</p>
<p>makes people aware of their self and sup-
</p>
<p>ports them in fighting for what they want.

<p> 3. Q (With Box 6.4): Think of examples where 
</p>
<p>reactance may be something desirable. Did 
</p>
<p>you experience such situations yourself?
</p>
<p>A: With desirable we mean that resisting a 
</p>
<p>freedom threat had a positive outcome for 
</p>
<p>you (as in paradoxical interventions) or reac-
</p>
<p>tance made you feel strong and determined or 
</p>
<p>made you feel aware of important priorities in 
</p>
<p>your life.

<p> Basic Theory
</p>
<p>Human beings are social animals. They do not 
</p>
<p>operate in a vacuum, but instead they are continu-
</p>
<p>ously influenced by others human beings. As 
</p>
<p>such, an individual&rsquo;s emotions, attitudes, and 
</p>
<p>behaviors cannot be viewed separately from the 
</p>
<p>social groups they belong to. Social groups can 
</p>
<p>be as small as a family or as large as a nation or 
</p>
<p>religious group, and every individual belongs to 
</p>
<p>different social groups. Every social group holds 
</p>
<p>certain standards, expectations, and rules for 
</p>
<p>what is &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to feel, think, 
</p>
<p>and do, which have an effect on all members of 
</p>
<p>the group. These standards, expectations, and 
</p>
<p>rules are referred to as social norms. A group&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>social norms are often unwritten; yet, they tend to 
</p>
<p>be deeply institutionalized in the group and fully 
</p>
<p>internalized by the group&rsquo;s members. That is, the 
</p>
<p>social norms that exist in a given individual&rsquo;s rel-
</p>
<p>evant social group will affect that individual not 
</p>
<p>only when there are other group members present 
</p>
<p>(and when there is thus a direct incentive to 
</p>
<p>adhere to the group&rsquo;s norms), but also when there 
</p>
<p>are no other group members nearby.
</p>

</p>
<p>The influence of social norms is ubiquitous 
</p>
<p>and is generally considered in psychology to be 
</p>
<p>one of the essential drivers of human behavior 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Berkowitz, 1972; Birnbaum &amp; Sagarin, 
</p>
<p>1976; Sherif, 1936), and social norm-based con-
</p>
<p>cepts have long been included in models and 
</p>
<p>theories that aim to predict human behavior (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Bandura, 1977; Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975). 
</p>
<p>However, questions were also being raised about 
</p>
<p>the usefulness of the concept of social norms, 
</p>
<p>with several scholars pointing out the vagueness 
</p>
<p>and overgeneralization of the concept, as well as 
</p>
<p>the highly inconsistent predictive value of social 
</p>
<p>norms (e.g., Darley &amp; Latane, 1970; Marini, 
</p>
<p>1984; Schwartz, 1973). In response to these criti-
</p>
<p>cisms, a theoretical refinement of the concept of 
</p>
<p>social norms, and the manner in which they 
</p>
<p>impact human behavior, was introduced by 
</p>
<p>Cialdini and colleagues (Cialdini, Reno, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Kallgren, 1990; Cialdini, Kallgren, &amp; Reno, 
</p>
<p>1991; Kallgren, Reno, &amp; Cialdini, 2000; Reno, 
</p>
<p>Cialdini, &amp; Kallgren, 1993). This resulted in the 
</p>
<p>Focus Theory of Normative Conduct (Fig.&nbsp;7.1). 
</p>
<p>The Focus Theory of Normative Conduct both 
</p>
<p>refines the definition of social norms by making a 
</p>
<p>clear distinction between two different types of 
</p>
<p>social norms, descriptive and injunctive social 
</p>
<p>norms, and introduces the concept of normative 
</p>
<p>focus to shed light on which type of social norm 
</p>
<p>will affect people&rsquo;s behavior in which type of 
</p>
<p>situation, and why.
</p>
<p> Descriptive and&nbsp;Injunctive Social 
Norms
</p>
<p>Human behavior in social situations stems from 
</p>
<p>two very different motivational sources, as was 
</p>
<p>shown as far back as 1955 by Deutsch and 
</p>
<p>Gerard. People may be influenced by others 
</p>
<p>because they consider these others a source of 
</p>
<p>informational social influence&nbsp;&ndash; that is, the actual 
</p>
<p>behavior of others provides information about the 
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.1 Schematic 
representation of the 
</p>
<p>Focus Theory of 
</p>
<p>Normative Conduct
</p>
<p>ate&rdquo; to feel, think, and do. A group&rsquo;s social 
</p>
<p>norms are often unwritten; yet, they tend to 
</p>
<p>be deeply institutionalized in the group and 
</p>
<p>fully internalized by the group&rsquo;s members.
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Focus Theory of Normative Conduct: 
</p>
<p>This theory stipulates that norms affect 
</p>
<p>human behavior powerfully and systemati-
</p>
<p>cally. In situations where several social 
</p>
<p>norms are present at the same time, behav-
</p>
<p>ior will be dictated by the focal norm, that 
</p>
<p>is, the norm that is made salient and that 
</p>
<p>attention is focused on. The theory further 
</p>
<p>distinguishes between two different kinds 
</p>
<p>of social norms: descriptive and injunctive 
</p>
<p>norms. The theory is described in more 
</p>
<p>detail in this section.

</p>
<p>normal, usual, or correct way to behave in a 
</p>
<p>certain situation. This influences people&rsquo;s behav-
</p>
<p>ior because humans are generally motivated to be 
</p>
<p>accurate (Cialdini &amp; Goldstein, 2004): They want 
</p>
<p>to respond to any given situation in the most effi-
</p>
<p>cient way possible, and how others behave pro-
</p>
<p>vides important cues about what might be the 
</p>
<p>most efficient or adaptive way to behave. Cialdini 
</p>
<p>has argued that looking to others as a source of 
</p>
<p>information offers an information-processing 
</p>
<p>advantage and provides a so-called decisional 
</p>
<p>shortcut (Cialdini, 1988). The Focus Theory of 
</p>
<p>Normative Conduct refers to social norms that 
</p>
<p>describe what is the typical or usual thing to do as 
</p>
<p>descriptive norms. Conversely, people may also 
</p>
<p>be influenced by others because they consider 
</p>
<p>these others a source of normative social influ-
</p>
<p>ence.&nbsp;&ndash; the expectations of others provide infor-
</p>
<p>mation about the appropriate or desired way to 
</p>
<p>behave in a certain situation. This influences 
</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s behavior because humans are generally 
</p>
<p>motivated to affiliate with others (Cialdini &amp; 
</p>
<p>Goldstein, 2004): They want to build and main-
</p>
<p>tain social relationships with those around them, 
</p>
<p>to be liked and approved by others, and to avoid 
</p>
<p>social exclusion. What other people expect pro-
</p>
<p>vides important cues about which behaviors will 
</p>
<p>allow one to meet these affiliation goals. The 
</p>
<p>Focus Theory of Normative Conduct refers to 
</p>
<p>social norms that describe what ought to be done 
</p>
<p>as injunctive norms.
</p>
<p>In many situations, descriptive and injunctive 
</p>
<p>norms will be aligned. In these cases, what a 
</p>
<p>social group believes ought to be done is also 
</p>
<p>indeed what is being done by the group members 
</p>
<p>(e.g., when library visitors turn silent upon 
</p>
<p>entering the library, Aarts &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2003). 
</p>
<p>However, the underlying motive for being silent 
</p>
<p>in the library may still differ from one person to 
</p>
<p>the other, and the fundamental differences 
</p>
<p>between the two major sources of motivation are 
</p>
<p>highly relevant both theoretically and practically, 
</p>
<p>as we will demonstrate in the following sections. 
</p>
<p>Important to note already here is that the infor-
</p>
<p>mational source of social influence is more 
</p>
<p>directly related to the behavioral decision at 
</p>
<p>hand: People simply wish to behave in the most 
</p>
<p>adaptive way possible and use other people&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>behavior as a cue to inform them about that most 
</p>
<p>adaptive way (see also Manning, 2009). The nor-
</p>
<p>mative source of social influence, conversely, is 
</p>
<p>at best indirectly related to the behavioral deci-
</p>
<p>sion at hand: People are not so much looking for 
</p>
<p>the best solution to the behavioral decision itself, 
</p>
<p>but rather are looking to attain a more distant 
</p>
<p>goal, namely to gain social approval and avoid 
</p>
<p>social sanctions (even if this may lead to a subop-
</p>
<p>timal behavioral decision). This is corroborated 
</p>
<p>by results from a priming study (Jacobson, 
</p>
<p>Mortensen, &amp; Cialdini, 2011 Study 1): Priming 
</p>
<p>people with descriptive norm-related words (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;typical,&rdquo; &ldquo;usual&rdquo;) led to faster responses on 
</p>
<p>target words related to the goal of accuracy (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;accurate,&rdquo; &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;) compared to comparison 
</p>
<p>non-words, whereas priming people with injunc-
</p>
<p>tive norm-related words (e.g., &ldquo;ought,&rdquo; &ldquo;duty&rdquo;) 
</p>
<p>led to faster response times on target words 
</p>
<p>related to the goal of social approval (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;approval,&rdquo; &ldquo;team&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>The crucial relevance of this distinction has 
</p>
<p>been very aptly demonstrated in Asch&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>conformity experiments (1951), in which 
</p>
<p>participants had to perform a very simple task in 
</p>
<p>a group setting&nbsp;&ndash; each group member in turn had 
</p>
<p>to publicly provide their solution of the task. 
</p>
<p>Unknowing to the participants, all other members 
</p>
<p>of the group were confederates to the experiment, 
</p>
<p>who would purposely provide a wrong answer to 
</p>
<p>the simple task. Post hoc interviews with the true 
</p>
<p>participants convincingly showed that participants 
</p>
<p>could have very different reasons for going along 
</p>
<p>with people providing a faulty answer on a very 
</p>
<p>simple task. Participants with low self-esteem, 
</p>
<p>for example, were genuinely confused when

</p>
<p>others provided a wrong answer and became 
</p>
<p>unsure of their own judgment. These participants 
</p>
<p>reported going along with others&rsquo; answer simply 
</p>
<p>because they no longer trust their own judgment 
</p>
<p>and considered that multiple others simply could 
</p>
<p>not be wrong&nbsp;&ndash; thus using the other people as a 
</p>
<p>source of informational social influence (see 
</p>
<p>also Wylie, 1961; Ziller, Hagey, Smith, &amp; Long, 
</p>
<p>1969). Other participants, however, indicated 
</p>
<p>being very much aware of the fact that the 
</p>
<p>answer that was provided by the other people 
</p>
<p>was wrong, but stated that they simply did not 
</p>
<p>want to be the one to diverge and stand out from 
</p>
<p>the group. For these participants, the others 
</p>
<p>became a source of normative social influence. 
</p>
<p>Giving a correct answer was no longer their 
</p>
<p>main priority; rather, maintaining a sense of 
</p>
<p>belonging to the group became the main priority 
</p>
<p>(Cialdini &amp; Goldstein, 2004).
</p>
<p> Normative Focus
</p>
<p>In normal day-to-day situations, multiple social 
</p>
<p>norms are typically present at the same time. 
</p>
<p>While these may be congruent, many times they 
</p>
<p>will also be in conflict with each other. A good 
</p>
<p>social norms theory then, in order to have any 
</p>
<p>practical use, should be able to make some sort of 
</p>
<p>prediction as to which norm will affect behavior 
</p>
<p>under which conditions. The Focus Theory of 
</p>
<p>Normative Conduct aims to do so by introducing 
</p>
<p>the concept of normative focus. Normative focus 
</p>
<p>refers to the idea that any given social norm will 
</p>
<p>only influence behavior when it is activated at the 
</p>
<p>moment of the behavioral decision, that is, when 
</p>
<p>that specific norm is made salient or when an 
</p>
<p>individual&rsquo;s attention is focused on that specific 
</p>
<p>norm while choosing their path of action.
</p>
<p>For example, multiple early studies by Cialdini 
</p>
<p>and colleagues showed that a descriptive anti- 
</p>
<p>littering norm (i.e., a clean environment) always 
</p>
<p>led to less littering than a descriptive pro-littering 
</p>
<p>norm (i.e., a littered environment), but that this 
</p>
<p>effect became much more pronounced when the 
</p>
<p>descriptive norm was made focal (i.e., when 
</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s attention was specifically drawn toward 
</p>
<p>the norm; Cialdini et&nbsp; al., 1990, Study 1; Reno 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 1993, Study 1). Similarly, focusing people 
</p>
<p>on an injunctive social norm not to litter led to 
</p>
<p>lower littering than focusing people on a no-norm 
</p>
<p>control message (Cialdini et&nbsp;al., 1990, Study 5). 
</p>
<p>The same study also showed that focusing 
</p>
<p>participants on an injunctive social norm close to 
</p>
<p>an anti-littering norm, namely a recycling norm, 
</p>
<p>led to lower littering than focusing them on an 
</p>
<p>injunctive social norm that is far away from an 
</p>
<p>injunctive anti-littering norm, such as a voting 
</p>
<p>norm&nbsp; &ndash; but littering following the voting norm 
</p>
<p>was still lower than following a no-norm control 
</p>
<p>message. This is in line with the idea of spreading 
</p>
<p>activation of neural networks (e.g., Anderson, 
</p>
<p>1983; Harvey &amp; Enzle, 1981).
</p>
<p>What the Focus Theory of Normative Conduct 
</p>
<p>added to the field was a more profound under-
</p>
<p>standing of when and why social norms would 
</p>
<p>affect behavior, and also under which conditions 
</p>
<p>social norms would not affect behavior. Indeed, in 
</p>
<p>one article, Cialdini and colleagues concluded 
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;[o]ur data indicate that under naturally 
</p>
<p>occurring conditions, if there is no salience, 
</p>
<p>behavior will be largely unguided by normative 
</p>
<p>considerations. [&hellip;] It is misguided to expect that 
</p>
<p>because norms are constantly in place within a 
</p>
<p>person or culture, they are constantly in force&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Kallgren et&nbsp; al., 2000, p.&nbsp; 1010&ndash;1011). This

<p>Conformity Experiments

<p>Many variations of the Asch&rsquo;s conformity

<p>interesting variation is the inclusion of one

<p>&ldquo;accomplice&rdquo; (one other person who also 
</p>
<p>diverges from the group opinion). This has 
</p>
<p>dramatic effects on the answers people pro-
</p>
<p>vide. Interestingly, this is especially true 
</p>
<p>for those motivated by informational social 
</p>
<p>influence. Videos of the Asch&rsquo;s conformity

</p>
<p>increased insight allowed the field to move for-
</p>
<p>ward in terms of systematic hypothesis testing, 
</p>
<p>which in turn opened up possibilities for applying 
</p>
<p>the concept of social norms to public behavior 
</p>
<p>change.
</p>
<p>An important limitation of the Focus Theory 
</p>
<p>of Normative Conduct is that the processes 
</p>
<p>through which a norm can become focal are not 
</p>
<p>described sufficiently in the original theory and 
</p>
<p>accompanying early studies of the theory. These 
</p>
<p>studies mainly focused on quite artificial norm 
</p>
<p>shift manipulations in highly specific and 
</p>
<p>oversimplified settings. In real life, however, the 
</p>
<p>contexts in which behavioral decisions are made 
</p>
<p>are hardly ever so simple. Consider the example 
</p>
<p>of eating behavior: Over 200 eating-related 
</p>
<p>decisions are made each day (Wansink &amp; Sobal, 
</p>
<p>2007), and this is done in an environment filled 
</p>
<p>with multiple eating-related norms, which not 
</p>
<p>only often conflict each other (think of thin, fit 
</p>
<p>people advertising extremely unhealthy food 
</p>
<p>types), but also often are ambiguous, vague, or 
</p>
<p>outdated (De Ridder, De Vet, Stok, Adriaanse, &amp; 
</p>
<p>De Wit, 2013). It is not easy to ascertain how in 
</p>
<p>such complex environments, one social norm 
</p>
<p>becomes focal over many others using the 
</p>
<p>knowledge from the type of studies described 
</p>
<p>earlier. Moreover, the exact procedures employed 
</p>
<p>to make social norms focal in these early studies 
</p>
<p>of the Focus Theory of Normative Conduct have 
</p>
<p>been criticized for not always being empirically 
</p>
<p>and theoretically convincing. While these issues 
</p>
<p>limit the conclusions that can be drawn from 
</p>
<p>these early studies on its own, a large body of 
</p>
<p>subsequent research exists to back up the idea of 
</p>
<p>the importance of normative focus. It is to several 
</p>
<p>of such studies that we now turn our attention.
</p>
<p> Research in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Applied Context
</p>
<p>Social norms have been used to promote desired 
</p>
<p>behavior in a large number of applied settings, 
</p>
<p>such as consumer behavior, health behavior 
</p>
<p>(most notably alcohol consumption in college 
</p>
<p>students, but also many other types of health 
</p>
<p>behavior), and sustainable behavior. For example, 
</p>
<p>the so-called social norms approach (Perkins &amp; 
</p>
<p>Berkowitz, 1986) became popular in the 1990s 
</p>
<p>off the back of a seminal study showing that col-
</p>
<p>lege students highly overestimated their peers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>alcohol abuse and acceptance of alcohol abuse,

<p>Box 7.2 Zooming In: Criticism of the 
</p>
<p>Procedures to Make Social Norms Focal
</p>
<p>The exact procedures employed to make 
</p>
<p>social norms focal in these early studies of 
</p>
<p>the Focus Theory of Normative Conduct 
</p>
<p>can be criticized (as Cialdini and his col-
</p>
<p>leagues indeed point out themselves, 
</p>
<p>e.g., Kallgren et&nbsp;al., 2000) for not always 
</p>
<p>being empirically and theoretically con-
</p>
<p>vincing. As an illustration, consider the 
</p>
<p>example of a norm focus manipulation dis-
</p>
<p>cussed in this chapter, the case of a confed-
</p>
<p>erate walking through a clean area and then 
</p>
<p>either littering or not littering. This manipu-
</p>
<p>lation may be interpreted by the average 
</p>
<p>reader in a different manner than by Cialdini 
</p>
<p>and colleagues. Their interpretation is that 
</p>
<p>in a littered environment, a littering confed-
</p>
<p>erate makes a descriptive pro-littering norm 
</p>
<p>more salient than a non-littering confeder-
</p>
<p>ate, but in clean environment, a littering 
</p>
<p>confederate in fact makes a descriptive anti-
</p>
<p>littering norm more salient (because it so 
</p>
<p>obviously goes against the anti-littering 
</p>
<p>norm stipulated by the clean environment). 
</p>
<p>Theoretical underpinnings for this assump-
</p>
<p>tion are weak at best. There is no convinc-
</p>
<p>ing argumentation as to (a) why the same 
</p>
<p>behavior of one confederate can apparently 
</p>
<p>make opposite norms salient, (b) why litter-
</p>
<p>ing of one person in a clean environment 
</p>
<p>would underscore anti-littering rather than 
</p>
<p>pro- littering, and (c) why the one-time 
</p>
<p>behavior of one single person would con-
</p>
<p>stitute a powerful norm shift manipulation 
</p>
<p>in the first place (generally, social norms 
</p>
<p>are thought to have to stem from a group 
</p>
<p>of people).

</p>
<p>and that these misperceptions influenced college 
</p>
<p>students&rsquo; own drinking attitudes and behavior 
</p>
<p>approximate to the perceived norm (Perkins &amp; 
</p>
<p>Berkowitz, 1986). Such misperceptions (labeled 
</p>
<p>as &ldquo;pluralistic ignorance&rdquo;; Toch &amp; Klofas, 1984) 
</p>
<p>occur both in relation to problem behaviors 
</p>
<p>(which are usually overestimated) and protective 
</p>
<p>behaviors (which are usually underestimated).
</p>
<p>The idea of the social norms approach was that, 
</p>
<p>by presenting more accurate descriptive norms 
</p>
<p>through campaigns, these misperceptions would 
</p>
<p>be corrected and alcohol abuse (or other problem-
</p>
<p>atic behaviors) would be reduced. Such interven-
</p>
<p>tions are easy to implement and inexpensive, and it 
</p>
<p>is therefore not surprising that the basic concept 
</p>
<p>was quickly adopted in many other policy 
</p>
<p>domains as well. However, the popularity of 
</p>
<p>social norm-based interventions is not supported 
</p>
<p>by a strong and consistent record of efficacy. 
</p>
<p>With regard to college students&rsquo; alcohol con-
</p>
<p>sumption, for example, positive effects (Turner, 
</p>
<p>Perkins, &amp; Bauerle, 2008), no effects (Granfield, 
</p>
<p>2005), and even counterproductive effects of 
</p>
<p>social norms interventions have been reported 
</p>
<p>(Campo &amp; Cameron, 2006; Clapp, Lange, Russel, 
</p>
<p>Shillington, &amp; Voas, 2003).
</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this might be that many 
</p>
<p>of these social norm-based interventions moved 
</p>
<p>away from the original approach of correcting 
</p>
<p>misperceived norms toward the use of manipu-
</p>
<p>lated, made-up norms to affect behavior. In any 
</p>
<p>case, the substantial variation in effectivity sug-
</p>
<p>gests that social norm interventions are not a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;quick-and-dirty&rdquo; panacea for all who wish to 
</p>
<p>instigate behavior change&nbsp; &ndash; rather, attention 
</p>
<p>should be paid to how and when social norms can 
</p>
<p>instigate behavior change, and what are important 
</p>
<p>moderators of the effect of social norms (Burchell, 
</p>
<p>Rettie, &amp; Patel, 2013; Rimal &amp; Real, 2003). 
</p>
<p>We will discuss two important moderators in 
</p>
<p>detail below in the following text.
</p>
<p> Self-Regulatory Resources
</p>
<p>A first crucial moderator of social norm effects is 
</p>
<p>the extent to which people have access to self- 
</p>
<p>regulatory resources when they are exposed to a 
</p>
<p>norm (Jacobson et al., 2011). It has been sug-
</p>
<p>gested that the availability of self- regulatory 
</p>
<p>resources when exposed to social norms plays a 
</p>
<p>crucial role in determining whether these social 
</p>
<p>norms become focal, and thus affect one&rsquo;s behav-
</p>
<p>ior, or not (Jacobson et&nbsp;al., 2011). As already dis-
</p>
<p>cussed earlier, descriptive norms provide 
</p>
<p>informational social influence that is directly 
</p>
<p>related to the behavioral decision at hand, 
</p>
<p>whereas injunctive norms provide normative 
</p>
<p>social influence that is directly related to the 
</p>
<p>more distant goal of social affiliation, and only 
</p>
<p>indirectly related to the behavioral decision at 
</p>
<p>hand. It has been shown that self-regulatory 
</p>
<p>capacity interacts very differently with these two 
</p>
<p>underlying motives.
</p>
<p>Under conditions of low self-regulatory 
</p>
<p>capacity (or similar &ldquo;fast&rdquo; types of processing; 
</p>
<p>cf. Kahneman, 2011), people&rsquo;s decision-making 
</p>
<p>tends to be less well thought-through and more 
</p>
<p>automatic. In such instances, quick heuristics 
</p>
<p>that help make effective, adaptive decisions are 
</p>
<p>highly helpful, and this is exactly what descrip-
</p>
<p>tive social norms offer (remember that Cialdini 
</p>
<p>has referred to descriptive social norms as &ldquo;deci-
</p>
<p>sional shortcuts&rdquo;). When self-regulatory capac-
</p>
<p>ity is higher (or when people have the opportunity

</p>
<p>shown to be limited, that is, people do not

</p>
<p>and the motivation for &ldquo;slow&rdquo; thinking; cf. 
</p>
<p>Kahneman, 2011), people might rely more on 
</p>
<p>other factors, such as their own values and goals, 
</p>
<p>to come to a behavioral decision, and descriptive 
</p>
<p>norms may thus play a less crucial role. These 
</p>
<p>ideas have been corroborated by various studies 
</p>
<p>in multiple domains.
</p>
<p>For example, it has been shown (Jacobson 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2011, Studies 3 and 4) that, under condi-
</p>
<p>tions of low self-regulatory capacity, college stu-
</p>
<p>dents were more likely to comply to a 
</p>
<p>time-consuming request when that request was 
</p>
<p>framed as a descriptive norm (along the lines of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;most other students in past instances have cho-
</p>
<p>sen to comply with this request&rdquo;). On the other 
</p>
<p>hand, when self-regulatory capacity was high, 
</p>
<p>college students were more likely to comply with 
</p>
<p>the request when it was framed as an injunctive 
</p>
<p>norm (along the lines of &ldquo;most students felt that 
</p>
<p>people should comply with this request&rdquo;). 
</p>
<p>Similarly, in the health domain, students who 
</p>
<p>were made cognitively busy (and who thus had 
</p>
<p>limited effortful processing capacity available) 
</p>
<p>were more likely to express intent to join an early-
</p>
<p>morning physical activity program when this pro-
</p>
<p>gram was advertised as a popular program that 
</p>
<p>many students were signing up for. Conversely, 
</p>
<p>students who were provided more effortful pro-
</p>
<p>cessing capacity were more likely to express 
</p>
<p>intent to join the program when it was advertised 
</p>
<p>as a program that others thought reflected impor-
</p>
<p>tant values and important personal qualities 
</p>
<p>(Kredentser, Fabrigar, Smith, &amp; Fulton, 2012). 
</p>
<p>Salmon, Fennis, De Ridder, Adriaanse, and De 
</p>
<p>Vet (2014) showed that people were more likely 
</p>
<p>to pick a healthy type of food promoted by a 
</p>
<p>descriptive social norm only when these people 
</p>
<p>had low self- regulatory capacity available&nbsp;&ndash; when 
</p>
<p>the decision had to be made quite fast (Fig.&nbsp;7.2).

<p>ing that the effectiveness of injunctive norms on

<p>people&rsquo;s behavior was moderated by the trait of

</p>
<p>stipulate that one&rsquo;s self-concept consists of 
</p>
<p>multiple identities, reflecting different roles that 
</p>
<p>people take on in different social groups. 
</p>
<p>Performing the behaviors that are congruent with 
</p>
<p>a given social group validates one&rsquo;s sense of 
</p>
<p>belonging to that group, and in that sense boosts 
</p>
<p>self-identity.
</p>
<p>Building upon these premises, the referent 
</p>
<p>informational influence model (Terry &amp; Hogg, 
</p>
<p>1996) stipulates that a social group&rsquo;s behaviors 
</p>
<p>and expectations will affect an individual only to 
</p>
<p>the extent that an individual identifies with that 
</p>
<p>social group. If this condition is not met, what 
</p>
<p>people stemming from that group do themselves, 
</p>
<p>or expect others to do, should have a much less 
</p>
<p>significant influence on people&rsquo;s behavior. It is 
</p>
<p>important to note that identification with a group 
</p>
<p>is not the same as belonging to the group per se: 
</p>
<p>All people are part of in-groups which they do 
</p>
<p>not feel particularly strongly connected to (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;humankind&rdquo;; &ldquo;people with blonde hair&rdquo;), but it 
</p>
<p>is unlikely that they also identify with these 
</p>
<p>groups extremely strongly, and therefore, it is 
</p>
<p>unlikely that a norm stemming from such groups 
</p>
<p>will affect people&rsquo;s behavior significantly.
</p>
<p>The importance of identification with the 
</p>
<p>norm referent group has been established primar-
</p>
<p>ily for the effect of descriptive social norms. 
</p>
<p>Recycling intentions (Terry, Hogg, &amp; White, 
</p>
<p>1999), intentions to use sun protection (Terry &amp; 
</p>
<p>Hogg, 1996), binge drinking (Johnston &amp; White, 
</p>
<p>2003), and eating behavior (Stok, De Ridder, De 
</p>
<p>Vet, &amp; De Wit, 2012) were all affected by descrip-
</p>
<p>tive social norms stemming from an in-group&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>but only when the participants identified strongly 
</p>
<p>with that in-group. For injunctive social norms, 
</p>
<p>less research is available that investigates the role 
</p>
<p>of identification, but Yun and Silk (2011) showed 
</p>
<p>that the role of identification was less relevant for 
</p>
<p>injunctive social norms than for descriptive social 
</p>
<p>norm effects.
</p>
<p> Using Descriptive or Injunctive Social 
Norms To&nbsp;Instigate Behavior Change
</p>
<p>Cialdini and colleagues posit that of the two types 
</p>
<p>of social norms, injunctive social norms are most 
</p>
<p>useful for those wishing to promote behavior 
</p>
<p>change in others (e.g., Cialdini et&nbsp;al., 1991; Reno 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 1993). Their position is based on the idea 
</p>
<p>that making a descriptive norm salient is only 
</p>
<p>beneficial when the behavior of most other peo-
</p>
<p>ple is in the desired direction. For example, when 
</p>
<p>wishing to promote fruit consumption among the 
</p>
<p>general public, focusing them on the reigning 
</p>
<p>descriptive norm would be useful only if most of 
</p>
<p>the public already consume a lot of fruit. After 
</p>
<p>all, if this is not the case, the descriptive norm 
</p>
<p>would actually be to not eat that much fruit, and 
</p>
<p>this might have detrimental rather than health- 
</p>
<p>promotive effects (that this is indeed possible is 
</p>
<p>shown by, for example, Sieverding, Decker, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Zimmerman, 2010, and Stok et&nbsp;al., 2012). They 
</p>
<p>further stipulate that an injunctive norm, on the 
</p>
<p>other hand, can be put to use in any given situa-
</p>
<p>tion, because the socially driven motivations that

</p>
<p>underlie injunctive norm effects play a role 
</p>
<p>regardless of what others are actually doing. 
</p>
<p>However, recent theorizing and empirical evi-
</p>
<p>dence challenge the idea that injunctive norms 
</p>
<p>are by definition more useful in multiple ways.
</p>
<p>For example, recent insights indicate that when 
</p>
<p>the majority of people are not yet showing the 
</p>
<p>desired behavior, descriptive norms can be formed 
</p>
<p>instead around what most people would like to do 
</p>
<p>(Sunstein, 1996) or around the fact that the num-
</p>
<p>ber of people performing the desired behavior is 
</p>
<p>increasing (called &ldquo;trending norms&rdquo;; Mortensen 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., in press). Moreover, there may be situations 
</p>
<p>where injunctive norms actually lead to less opti-
</p>
<p>mal outcomes. Injunctive social norms do have a 
</p>
<p>pushy component, wherein they tell people what 
</p>
<p>they should be doing. The risk with such norms, 
</p>
<p>especially when the socially approved option does 
</p>
<p>not align with what the individual might person-
</p>
<p>ally value, is that it creates a feeling of resistance 
</p>
<p>or reactance (Brehm, 1966; see M&uuml;hlberger &amp; 
</p>
<p>Jonas, Chap. 6 this volume) in the individual. 
</p>
<p>There is research suggesting that injunctive social 
</p>
<p>norms do hold this risk (e.g., Bosson, Parrott, 
</p>
<p>Swan, Kuchynka, &amp; Schramm, 2015; Stok, De 
</p>
<p>Vet, De Wit, Renner, &amp; De Ridder, 2015) and that 
</p>
<p>this may, under certain circumstances, cause 
</p>
<p>injunctive social norms to be less effective than 
</p>
<p>descriptive social norms or to even be counterpro-
</p>
<p>ductive (e.g., Stok et&nbsp;al., 2014).
</p>
<p> Detailed Discussion of&nbsp;One Study
</p>
<p>One of the most-cited articles (well over 1500 
</p>
<p>citations) that describes effects of social norms 
</p>
<p>on people&rsquo;s behavior is the one in which two 
</p>
<p>studies on towel reuse by hotel guests are 
</p>
<p>described by Goldstein, Cialdini, and Griskevicius 
</p>
<p>(2008). Having hotel guests use their towel more 
</p>
<p>than once saves energy and water, reduces the 
</p>
<p>amount of polluting detergent released into the 
</p>
<p>environment, and as such is important from an 
</p>
<p>Box 7.6 Zooming In: Why Descriptive Social 
</p>
<p>Norms Should Be Communicated with Care
</p>
<p>Many desired behaviors (such as recycling, 
</p>
<p>being physically active, and adhering to 
</p>
<p>speed limits) are performed less often than 
</p>
<p>we as a society would hope. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>many undesired behaviors (such as aggres-
</p>
<p>sion, overeating, and crossing red traffic 
</p>
<p>lights) are performed too often. A common, 
</p>
<p>and understandable, response of policy 
</p>
<p>makers is to alert the public to these figures 
</p>
<p>with the intention of instigating behavior 
</p>
<p>change, thus communicating that, for 
</p>
<p>example, cancer screen attendance is too 
</p>
<p>low, or that a large majority of children are 
</p>
<p>consuming too many soft drinks. 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, there are strong 
</p>
<p>indications that such communications do 
</p>
<p>not lead to behavior change in the desired 
</p>
<p>direction. From the perspective of the 
</p>
<p>Focus Theory of Normative Conduct, this 
</p>
<p>is actually understandable: When it is com-
</p>
<p>municated, for example, that only few peo-
</p>
<p>ple wear sunscreen when going outside, the 
</p>
<p>average person may simply conclude that it 
</p>
<p>is thus &ldquo;normal&rdquo; not to wear sunscreen and 
</p>
<p>that they can simply continue doing so. 
</p>
<p>Even more detrimental effects might occur 
</p>
<p>in the few people who were initially apply-
</p>
<p>ing sunscreen correctly: They might actu-
</p>
<p>ally stop doing so, to conform to the group&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>standards. Such effects have been shown 
</p>
<p>for intentions to attend cancer screening 
</p>
<p>(Sieverding and colleagues, 2010) as well 
</p>
<p>as for fruit consumption (Stok, De Ridder, 
</p>
<p>De Vet, &amp; De Wit, 2014). When the current 
</p>
<p>behavior is not up to the desired standards, 
</p>
<p>therefore, these &ldquo;normative facts&rdquo; should 
</p>
<p>be communicated with great care!
</p>

<p>environmental perspective. In addition, it helps 
</p>
<p>hotels save money and portray themselves as 
</p>
<p>environmentally friendly. The two studies con-
</p>
<p>ducted by Goldstein et&nbsp;al. (2008) investigate the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of a descriptive norm-based mes-
</p>
<p>sage, as compared to the more traditional &ldquo;help 
</p>
<p>save the environment&rdquo; message that is the stan-
</p>
<p>dard message used by hotels, to encourage towel 
</p>
<p>reuse by its guests. The second study additionally 
</p>
<p>investigates how the use of different norm refer-
</p>
<p>ent groups moderates the effect of the descriptive 
</p>
<p>norm message. A strong suit of the two studies is 
</p>
<p>that they were conducted in the field, that is, in a 
</p>
<p>real hotel with regular hotel guests as the 
</p>
<p>(unknowing) participants.
</p>
<p>The first study employed a between-subjects 
</p>
<p>design. Over the course of 80&nbsp;days, one of two 
</p>
<p>messages was displayed on a towel rack hanger 
</p>
<p>placed in the bathrooms of hotel rooms of a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;midsized, midpriced hotel in the Southwest that 
</p>
<p>was part of a national chain&rdquo; (Goldstein et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2008, p.&nbsp;473). The hotel had 190 rooms, which 
</p>
<p>were randomly assigned to a descriptive norm- 
</p>
<p>based message or a standard pro-environmental 
</p>
<p>message (Table&nbsp;7.1). The towel rack hangers (see 
</p>
<p>Fig.&nbsp; 7.3) also provided detailed instructions for 
</p>
<p>guests about how to indicate their willingness to 
</p>
<p>reuse their towel (i.e., by hanging them on the 
</p>
<p>towel rack or over the shower curtain rod). On the 
</p>
<p>back of the hanger, information was provided on 
</p>
<p>the benefits of towel reuse for the environment 
</p>
<p>(e.g., saving water and preventing the release of 
</p>
<p>detergent into the environment). Hotel room 
</p>
<p>attendants were trained to record hotel guests&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>towel reuse behavior through repeated instruc-
</p>
<p>tion and provision of pictures showing the differ-
</p>
<p>ent types of towel placement that should be 
</p>
<p>considered as towel reuse. The behavior of guests 
</p>
<p>staying in the hotel for a minimum of two nights 
</p>
<p>was analyzed. For guests staying for more than 
</p>
<p>two nights, only their towel reuse behavior of the 
</p>
<p>first eligible day was analyzed, so as to ensure 
</p>
<p>that each guest participated in the study only 
</p>
<p>once. Crucially, a higher percentage of hotel 
</p>
<p>guests staying in a room with a descriptive norm 
</p>
<p>message on the towel rack hanger reused at least 
</p>
<p>one towel (44.1%) than of guests in a room where 
</p>
<p>the standard pro-environmental message was 
</p>
<p>displayed (35.1%). The difference between these 
</p>
<p>percentages was statistically significant as proven 
</p>
<p>by a chi-square test.
</p>
<p>The second study, which was conducted in the 
</p>
<p>same hotel, dived deeper into the question of 
</p>
<p>whose norms people are most likely to follow. 
</p>
<p>As we have detailed earlier, identification with 
</p>
<p>the norm referent group is an important modera-
</p>
<p>tor of the effect of social norms, especially of 
</p>
<p>descriptive social norms. Most often, the extent 
</p>
<p>of identification is based on personal 
</p>
<p>characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, interests). 
</p>
<p>Goldstein et&nbsp; al. (2008) sought to investigate 
</p>
<p>whether more random, contextual characteristics 
</p>
<p>could also play a role in identification, and 
</p>
<p>whether contextual similarity to the referent 
</p>
<p>group would have a larger or smaller effect than 
</p>
<p>personal similarity to the referent group. To that 
</p>
<p>end, in addition to the two messages used in 
</p>
<p>Study 1, three additional messages were designed, 
</p>
<p>leading to a total of five different experimental 
</p>
<p>conditions (Table&nbsp;7.1). Contextual similarity was 
</p>
<p>highlighted by using as norm referent group 
</p>
<p>people who stayed in the same hotel room. Two 
</p>
<p>other messages highlighted personal similarity 
</p>
<p>by using as norm referent groups either fellow 
</p>
<p>men and women or fellow citizens. Hotel rooms 
</p>
<p>were, again, assigned to an experimental 
</p>
<p>condition at random. Over 53&nbsp;days, towel reuse 
</p>
<p>was shown to be higher in all social norm-based 
</p>
<p>message conditions than in the pro-environmental 
</p>
<p>message condition. Furthermore, the norm 
</p>
<p>stemming from the contextual similarity referent 
</p>
<p>group, comprising people who had stayed in the 
</p>
<p>same room, yielded higher towel reuse (49.3%) 
</p>
<p>than the descriptive norms (42.8% on average) 
</p>
<p>(see Fig.&nbsp;7.4).
</p>
<p>The two studies thus showed that a descriptive 
</p>
<p>social norm message increases towel reuse behav-
</p>
<p>ior in hotel guests as compared to a standard pro-
</p>
<p>environmental message. As a point of criticism 
</p>
<p>with regard to Study 2, it should be noted that the 
</p>
<p>two personal similarity conditions were by design 
</p>
<p>less likely to affect behavior than the contextual 
</p>
<p>similarity condition, as they were less tailored to 
</p>
<p>the participant: While in the contextual similarity 
</p>
<p>condition, there was a clear, one-to-one connec-
</p>
<p>tion between the referent group and the partici-
</p>
<p>pant, namely, that they all stayed in the same exact 
</p>
<p>room, the two personal similarity conditions did

</p>
<p>The citizen- based message was a general mes-
</p>
<p>sage, that is, it was not tailored to the participant&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>specific city, and the gender-based message 
</p>
<p>reported the behavior of both genders, from which 
</p>
<p>participants then had to &ldquo;self-select&rdquo; the relevant 
</p>
<p>norm. The main take-away messages from these 
</p>
<p>two studies are thus (1) the increase in towel reuse 
</p>
<p>after providing hotel guests with a descriptive 
</p>
<p>norm- based message compared to a standard 
</p>
<p>pro- environmental message, and (2) the larger 
</p>
<p>effectivity of a descriptive norm based on a more 
</p>
<p>contextually similar referent group, that of people 
</p>
<p>who previously stayed in the exact same room, 
</p>
<p>compared to a less similar group, that of people 
</p>
<p>who previously stayed in the same hotel. Important 
</p>
<p>to note here is that the comparison condition 
</p>
<p>against which the descriptive norms were com-
</p>
<p>pared was not a no-message control condition: 
</p>
<p>The comparison was against an environment-pro-
</p>
<p>tection message that itself also has a clear inten-
</p>
<p>tion to influence behavior and that, as such, 
</p>
<p>constitutes a very strict comparison condition.
</p>
<p>Goldstein et&nbsp;al.&rsquo; (2008) towel reuse study has 
</p>
<p>been replicated multiple times, and results were 
</p>
<p>not always consistent. Some studies replicated 
</p>
<p>the enhanced effect of social norm-based mes-
</p>
<p>sages compared to other types of messages 
</p>
<p>(Reese, Loew, &amp; Steffgen, 2014; Schultz, 
</p>
<p>Khazian, &amp; Zaleski, 2008; Terrier &amp; Marfaing, 
</p>
<p>2015), whereas others did not (Bohner &amp; 
</p>
<p>Schl&uuml;ter, 2014; Mair &amp; Bergin-Seers, 2010). 
</p>
<p>Crucially, two different syntheses of the body of 
</p>
<p>literature on this topic have provided evidence for 
</p>
<p>a small but consistent positive effect of descrip-
</p>
<p>tive norm-based messages (regardless of level of 
</p>
<p>identification). A Bayesian evidence synthesis 
</p>
<p>(Scheibehenne, Jamil, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2016) 
</p>
<p>showed that the studies, taken together, provide 
</p>
<p>strong support for the effect of social norms on 
</p>
<p>towel reuse. While this evidence synthesis has 
</p>
<p>been criticized for not taking into account ran-
</p>
<p>dom effects (Carlsson, Schimmack, Williams, &amp; 
</p>
<p>B&uuml;rkner, 2017, who themselves report smaller, 
</p>
<p>but largely still supportive, effects using Bayesian 
</p>
<p>multilevel framework analyses with varying 
</p>
<p>assumptions about between-study variation), a 
</p>
<p>small but highly consistent effect was also 
</p>
<p>reported in a more traditional meta-analysis that 
</p>
<p>allowed for between-study heterogeneity (Nisa, 
</p>
<p>Varum, &amp; Botelho, 2017). Furthermore, a ran-
</p>
<p>dom-effects meta-analysis of social influence 
</p>
<p>effects on more general resource conservation 
</p>
<p>(including but not limited to towel reuse) also 
</p>
<p>found a small but consistent and significant effect 
</p>
<p>of social norm-based messages compared to con-
</p>
<p>trol messages (Abrahamse &amp; Steg, 2013). Taking 
</p>
<p>this body of evidence together, it seems fair to 
</p>
<p>conclude that social norm-based messages have 
</p>
<p>been proven to affect towel reuse behavior, 
</p>
<p>although the effect is not overwhelmingly large 
</p>
<p>compared to strict control conditions.

</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; People&rsquo;s behavior is guided by social 
</p>
<p>norms, the often-unwritten rules of con-
</p>
<p>duct that tend to be deeply institutional-
</p>
<p>ized in a social group.
</p>
<p>&bull; Social norms that describe what is the 
</p>
<p>typical or usual thing to do within a cer-
</p>
<p>tain social group are called descriptive 
</p>
<p>norms.
</p>
<p>&bull; Social norms that describe what other 
</p>
<p>group members think ought to be done 
</p>
<p>are called injunctive norms.
</p>
<p>&bull; Whether people&rsquo;s behavior is guided 
</p>
<p>by social norms depends on their self-
</p>
<p>regulatory resources, that is, whether 
</p>
<p>they have the capacity to attend to social 
</p>
<p>norms.
</p>
<p>&bull; Effectiveness of social norms also 
</p>
<p>depends on the extent that people iden-
</p>
<p>tify with a social group.
</p>
<p>&bull; Both descriptive and injunctive social 
</p>
<p>norms can be employed to design inter-
</p>
<p>ventions for behavioral change.

<p> Guiding Answers to&nbsp;Questions 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Box 7.3 Q: You have been assigned to design 
</p>
<p>a strategy for less alcohol consumption on 
</p>
<p>campus. What would you prefer: using a 
</p>
<p>descriptive norm or an injunctive norm?
</p>
<p>A: In this case a descriptive norm, informing 
</p>
<p>students about how much students actually 
</p>
<p>drink will probably be more effective. Alcohol 
</p>
<p>intake is not a topic of discussion among stu-
</p>
<p>dents and this will probably lead to false ideas 
</p>
<p>about how much others drink (&ldquo;pluralistic 
</p>
<p>ignorance&rdquo;). Correcting these inaccurate ideas 
</p>
<p>by providing a descriptive norm could help 
</p>
<p>reduce alcohol consumption.
</p>
<p> 2. Box 7.5 Q: The railway station wants people 
</p>
<p>to litter less while they are waiting for trains 
</p>
<p>on the platform. In what way would it help for 
</p>
<p>the waiting passengers to identify with a 
</p>
<p>social group?
</p>
<p>A: People are more inclined to use social 
</p>
<p>norms as a decisional shortcut when they can 
</p>
<p>identify with the group that advocates these 
</p>
<p>norms. Emphasizing that railway passengers 
</p>
<p>are responsible people who do not litter is 
</p>
<p>therefore a good campaign strategy.
</p>
<p> 3. Box 7.7 Q: The Netherlands Nutrition Centre 
</p>
<p>has previously launched a healthy eating cam-
</p>
<p>paign with the slogan &ldquo;80% knows [about 
</p>
<p>healthy food], 20% eats it.&rdquo; Is this a good 
</p>
<p>campaign strategy?
</p>
<p>A: This campaign rests on the notion that a 
</p>
<p>playful reminder of people not acting on their 
</p>
<p>intentions will encourage them to eat more 
</p>
<p>healthily. In fact, the campaign will probably 
</p>
<p>not be effective because it emphasizes the 
</p>
<p>minority norm that eating more healthily often 
</p>
<p>fails. The Netherlands Nutrition Centre has 
</p>
<p>since discontinued this campaign.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>We have all observed, at school, in professional 
</p>
<p>settings and in sports, that some groups work in 
</p>
<p>harmony, with members coordinating their 
</p>
<p>actions and helping each other. Other groups, 
</p>
<p>however, experience a great deal of antagonism, 
</p>
<p>with members favoring their own interest and 
</p>
<p>acting against each other. What explains such dif-
</p>
<p>ferences? How can the functioning of a group be 
</p>
<p>predicted and possibly oriented? At an individual 
</p>
<p>level of analysis, group members may have dif-
</p>
<p>ferent&mdash;sometimes compatible, sometimes con-
</p>
<p>flicting&mdash;personal orientations, and be more 
</p>
<p>pro-social or pro-self, thereby favoring joint or 
</p>
<p>self-serving outcomes (De Cremer &amp; Van Lange, 
</p>
<p>2001). Group members may also hold mixed 
</p>
<p>motives in a given situation, as a function of their 
</p>
<p>focus on the task at hand as well as the social 
</p>
<p>relations in the group (De Dreu, Nijstad, &amp; van 
</p>
<p>Knippenberg, 2008). Classmates, for instance, 
</p>
<p>may be motivated to discover the correct solution 
</p>
<p>to a problem in a physics lab class, and at the 
</p>
<p>same time motivated to show their own compe-
</p>
<p>tence to the teacher.
</p>
<p>An individual level of analysis requires a 
</p>
<p>strong reliance on group composition to predict 
</p>
<p>how groups will behave (Moreland &amp; Levine, 
</p>
<p>1992). Groups, however, possess particular 
</p>
<p>properties that are likely to influence group 
</p>
<p>members&rsquo; behavior over and beyond their </p>

<p> personal orientation. One such property&mdash;
</p>
<p>imposed by the environment or inherited by the 
</p>
<p>group&rsquo;s history&mdash;is goal structure that is the set 
</p>
<p>of a group&rsquo;s rules, norms, or practices that spec-
</p>
<p>ify and influence the type of interdependence 
</p>
<p>among individual goals (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 
</p>
<p>2005). Social interdependence theory posits that 
</p>
<p>interdependence may be positive and lead to 
</p>
<p>interactions that facilitate the attainment of all 
</p>
<p>group members&rsquo; goals, or negative and lead to 
</p>
<p>interactions that favor one&rsquo;s goal attainment by 
</p>
<p>hindering the goal attainment of other group 
</p>
<p>members (Deutsch, 1949). For example, in the 
</p>
<p>famous Robbers Cave study (Sherif, 1958), chil-
</p>
<p>dren in a summer camp discovered that the truck 
</p>
<p>with the day&rsquo;s food was stuck, and could only be 
</p>
<p>rescued if all the children pulled it in synchrony. 
</p>
<p>The situation created a common goal (retrieve 
</p>
<p>the food), superordinate as compared to indi-
</p>
<p>vidual goals, and required coordinated interac-
</p>
<p>tion of all children to reach that goal (for a 
</p>
<p>discussion of the role of common goals in inter-
</p>
<p>group contact, see Christ &amp; Kauff, Chap. 10, 
</p>
<p>this volume). In the same study, Sherif observed 
</p>
<p>that other activities, such as tournaments that 
</p>
<p>allowed to win a desired prize, required teams to 
</p>
<p>fight with the understanding that success of one 
</p>
<p>team required hindering the other team.
</p>
<p>This chapter will present the tenets of social 
</p>
<p>interdependence theory and the work that this 
</p>
<p>theory has generated over the past 70&nbsp; years. 
</p>
<p>Then, we will show how this theory has shaped 
</p>
<p>research on cooperative learning, and in particu-
</p>
<p>lar research on how pupils and students share or 
</p>
<p>not the materials and resources necessary for 
</p>
<p>learning. Finally, we will illustrate how difficult 
</p>
<p>it is to promote positive interdependence and 
</p>
<p>present an intervention study designed to help in 
</p>
<p>this endeavor.
</p>
<p> Social Interdependence
</p>
<p>Social interdependence theory was born as a 
</p>
<p>theory of cooperation and competition 
</p>
<p>(Deutsch, 1949). Over the years, it has been 
</p>
<p>extremely successful because, instead of 
</p>
<p>describing cooperation and competition as sep-
</p>
<p>arate phenomena, it allowed to understand their 
</p>
<p>interplay by grounding their emergence in a 
</p>
<p>common mechanism: social interdependence. 
</p>
<p>Social interdependence is the mechanism 
</p>
<p>whereby the outcomes of individuals in a group 
</p>
<p>are affected by the actions of the other group 
</p>
<p>members (see also Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989). 
</p>
<p>Let us imagine two pupils in a classroom, where 
</p>
<p>they are likely to interact and be interdepen-
</p>
<p>dent. If the teacher has given the two pupils a 
</p>
<p>common assignment, then they find themselves 
</p>
<p>in a position of positive social interdependence, 
</p>
<p>as the actions of each of them will jointly con-
</p>
<p>tribute to the quality of the assignment. This 
</p>
<p>example illustrates how the positive interde-
</p>
<p>pendence introduced by the teacher can con-
</p>
<p>tribute to cooperative behaviors and promotive 
</p>
<p>interactions, i.e., working toward the achieve-
</p>
<p>ment of a common goal. If, on the contrary, the 
</p>
<p>teacher has asked the pupils to write an essay 
</p>
<p>and told them that the best one will be pub-
</p>
<p>lished in the school&rsquo;s newsletter, the two pupils 
</p>
<p>find themselves in a position of negative social 
</p>
<p>interdependence, as the actions of each of them 
</p>
<p>will hamper the goal of the other (be the one 
</p>
<p>whose essay is published in the school&rsquo;s news-
</p>
<p>letter). This example illustrates how the nega-
</p>
<p>tive interdependence introduced by the teacher 
</p>
<p>might facilitate competitive behaviors and

<p>Interaction: Individuals&rsquo; coordinated 
</p>
<p>actions that have consequences for other

<p>Goal structure: The structure consisting 
</p>
<p>of a group&rsquo;s set of rules, norms, or practices 
</p>
<p>of a group that determines how each group 
</p>
<p>member&rsquo;s opportunities for goal achieve-
</p>
<p>ment depend on those of other group mem-
</p>
<p>bers, i.e., their social interdependence.

</p>
<p>oppositional interactions, i.e., working toward 
</p>
<p>the achievement of one&rsquo;s own goal to the detri-
</p>
<p>ment of the other&rsquo;s (Deutsch, 1949).
</p>
<p>It is worth noting at this point that social 
</p>
<p>interdependence is a structural property of the 
</p>
<p>environment, namely, a set of constraints that 
</p>
<p>affect people&rsquo;s behaviors. These constraints can 
</p>
<p>be material: The members of a rowing team are 
</p>
<p>necessarily positively interdependent, as none 
</p>
<p>of them can fulfill the goal of winning without 
</p>
<p>the others (e.g., Dyson, 2001), and the students 
</p>
<p>sitting an entrance exam with numerus clausus 
</p>
<p>for a prestigious curriculum are necessarily neg-
</p>
<p>atively interdependent, as the success of one 
</p>
<p>reduces the chances of success of the others 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Kaufman, 1994; Sommet, Pulfrey, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Butera, 2013). The constraints can also be sym-
</p>
<p>bolic, for instance, the collectivistic and indi-
</p>
<p>vidualistic culture (Triandis, 1993), or the 
</p>
<p>self-transcendence and self- enhancement values 
</p>
<p>(Schwartz et&nbsp; al., 2012) of a given society. 
</p>
<p>Whatever be the nature of social interdepen-
</p>
<p>dence, this structural property of the environ-
</p>
<p>ment exerts a strong influence on people&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>behaviors and perceptions, resulting either in 
</p>
<p>actual cooperation or competition&mdash;character-
</p>
<p>ized by promotive or oppositional interactions 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1974)&mdash;or in cooper-
</p>
<p>ative or competitive climates&mdash;characterized by 
</p>
<p>perceived promotive or oppositional relation-
</p>
<p>ships (e.g., Elliot, Jury, &amp; Murayama, 2018).
</p>
<p>Importantly, the reliance on the concept of 
</p>
<p>social interdependence allows differentiating 
</p>
<p>cooperation and competition from other phenom-
</p>
<p>ena that may also be present in social settings. 
</p>
<p>Going back to our two pupils, they may find 
</p>
<p>themselves in a position of independence, if the 
</p>
<p>teacher has asked them to work alone, each with 
</p>
<p>their own materials, and evaluates their work 
</p>
<p>based on predefined criteria. In this case, the 
</p>
<p>actions of one do not affect the outcomes of the 
</p>
<p>other. They may also find themselves in a posi-
</p>
<p>tion in which one is dependent on the other, if the 
</p>
<p>teacher has asked one pupil to help a schoolmate, 
</p>
<p>as in tutoring. In this case, the actions of one 
</p>
<p>affect the outcomes of the other, but not vice 
</p>
<p>versa (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2005).
</p>
<p> Psychological Processes in&nbsp;Social 
Interdependence
</p>
<p>How does social interdependence, either positive 
</p>
<p>or negative, result in the expected outcomes, 
</p>
<p>namely, the emergence of cooperation with its 
</p>
<p>promotive behaviors, or competition with its 
</p>
<p>oppositional behaviors, respectively? Three 
</p>
<p>important processes appear to be at work in 
</p>
<p>social interdependence (Deutsch, 1962). First, 
</p>
<p>substitutability refers to the extent to which a 
</p>
<p>group member&rsquo;s actions can substitute for the 
</p>
<p>actions of another group member. Let us imagine 
</p>
<p>that our two pupils are working together on a 
</p>
<p>joint assignment, say a report on the geography 
</p>
<p>of India: If pupil number one completes a section 
</p>
<p>of the assignment for pupil number two, the lat-
</p>
<p>ter will be satisfied and will not feel the need to 
</p>
<p>complete that section by him/herself, because in 
</p>
<p>cooperation the partners&rsquo; actions are substitut-
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Social interdependence: The actions and 
</p>
<p>outcomes of individuals are affected by 
</p>
<p>each other&rsquo;s actions.
</p>
<p>Cooperation: Positive social interdepen-
</p>
<p>dence. The actions of each individual con-
</p>
<p>tribute to some common goal; individual 
</p>
<p>goals are positively associated. The success 
</p>
<p>of one supports the likelihood of success of 
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p>Competition: Negative social interdepen-
</p>
<p>dence. The actions of one individual hamper 
</p>
<p>the goal of the other; individual goals are 
</p>
<p>negatively associated. The success of one 
</p>
<p>reduces the likelihood of success of others.

</p>
<p>able. If the two pupils have well understood what 
</p>
<p>positive interdependence is about, pupil number 
</p>
<p>two will reciprocate in a future task. This, of 
</p>
<p>course, provided that actions are effective, that is 
</p>
<p>functional in reaching the goal (in this example, 
</p>
<p>to write a good report): If one partner&rsquo;s actions 
</p>
<p>are not effective, then the other will have to 
</p>
<p>expend more effort to compensate, thereby 
</p>
<p>thwarting cooperation&rsquo;s important role of evenly 
</p>
<p>distributing the effort. However, it is clear from 
</p>
<p>our example that effective actions are not substi-
</p>
<p>tutable in the case of competition: If pupil num-
</p>
<p>ber one completes a section of the assignment 
</p>
<p>more quickly or instead of pupil number two, 
</p>
<p>thereby signaling greater competence to the 
</p>
<p>teacher, pupil number two will not be satisfied 
</p>
<p>and will feel the need to exert extra effort to 
</p>
<p>bridge the gap.
</p>
<p>Second, social interdependence involves 
</p>
<p>cathexis, a substantial affective investment in the 
</p>
<p>actions and persons involved in an interaction. In 
</p>
<p>cooperation, positive cathexis is attached to effec-
</p>
<p>tive actions, and negative cathexis is attached to 
</p>
<p>ineffective actions of the partner. Indeed, effective 
</p>
<p>actions are likely to result in reaching the group&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>common goal, whereas ineffective actions (or 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;bungling&rdquo; as Deutsch calls them) are likely to 
</p>
<p>hinder such a goal. In competition, however, nega-
</p>
<p>tive cathexis is attached to effective actions, and 
</p>
<p>positive cathexis is attached to ineffective actions 
</p>
<p>of the competitor. Indeed, effective actions of the 
</p>
<p>competitor are likely to result in hindering one&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>individual goal, whereas ineffective actions are 
</p>
<p>likely to favor it. For instance, a study showed that 
</p>
<p>under negative interdependence, participants 
</p>
<p>actively engaged in claiming one&rsquo;s self-superiority 
</p>
<p>in terms of competence as compared to a partner 
</p>
<p>who might have had a good point in a problem-
</p>
<p>solving task (Butera &amp; Mugny, 1995).
</p>
<p>Third, inducibility refers to the reciprocal influ-
</p>
<p>ence that partners exert on each other. This process 
</p>
<p>is particularly important in positive social interde-
</p>
<p>pendence. Inducibility leads the partners to engage 
</p>
<p>in effective actions that may be useful for the com-
</p>
<p>mon goal and refrain from actions that may inter-
</p>
<p>fere with such a goal. Under negative social 
</p>
<p>interdependence, competitors will try to resist 
</p>
<p>each other&rsquo;s influence in order to avoid losing 
</p>
<p>some competitive advantage. For example, experts 
</p>
<p>working under negative interdependence have 
</p>
<p>been shown to resist the other&rsquo;s influence, their 
</p>
<p>expertise notwithstanding (Butera &amp; Mugny, 
</p>
<p>2001; Quiamzade &amp; Mugny, 2009). In sum, social 
</p>
<p>interdependence creates a dense affective and 
</p>
<p>behavioral network within a group, in which group 
</p>
<p>members develop meaningful representations, 
</p>
<p>affects, and actions in relation to others, either 
</p>
<p>positive or negative depending on whether group 
</p>
<p>members are tied by cooperation or competition.
</p>
<p> Cooperation
</p>
<p>Social interdependence theory has been instru-
</p>
<p>mental in the development of a systematic theory 
</p>
<p>of cooperation and competition. Moreover, it has 
</p>
<p>led to the development of a long-lasting and pro-
</p>
<p>ductive area of research that has investigated the 
</p>
<p>mechanisms that make cooperation more effec-
</p>
<p>tive&mdash;in terms of effort to achieve positive rela-
</p>
<p>tionships, psychological adjustment, and social 
</p>
<p>competence&mdash;than competition or individual work 
</p>
<p>(Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989). This area of research 
</p>
<p>has also uncovered the mechanisms that, as a 
</p>
<p>result, lead cooperation to Promote higher produc-
</p>
<p>tivity and achievement, better interpersonal rela-
</p>
<p>tionships, psychological health, and self- esteem 
</p>
<p>(Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2015). In particular, the work 
</p>
<p>by Johnson and Johnson (see 2009 for a review) 
</p>
<p>has uncovered five principles that contribute to the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of cooperation (see Fig.&nbsp;8.1).
</p>
<p> 1. Positive interdependence. As mentioned ear-
</p>
<p>lier, it is crucial for group members to pursue 
</p>
<p>common goals or to consider that individual 
</p>
<p>Box 8.1 Question for Elaboration
</p>
<p>Imagine a cohesive and cooperative volley-
</p>
<p>ball team. Give an example describing how 
</p>
<p>substitutability, positive cathexis, and

</p>
<p>goals are positively linked in order to work 
</p>
<p>cooperatively (see also Sherif, 1966). Beyond 
</p>
<p>this theoretical statement, it was demon-
</p>
<p>strated that, indeed, positive interdependence 
</p>
<p>yielded stronger positive effects on achieve-
</p>
<p>ment than mere group membership (Hwong, 
</p>
<p>Caswell, Johnson, &amp; Johnson, 1993) or mere 
</p>
<p>interaction (Lew, Mesch, Johnson, &amp; Johnson, 
</p>
<p>1986).
</p>
<p> 2. Responsibility and accountability. If group 
</p>
<p>members strive for the same goal, then they 
</p>
<p>are responsible for one another, namely for 
</p>
<p>doing their share of work and for helping the 
</p>
<p>others. Even if the importance of such per-
</p>
<p>sonal responsibility seems obvious, classic 
</p>
<p>research on the phenomenon of &ldquo;social loaf-
</p>
<p>ing&rdquo; has shown that people may actually work 
</p>
<p>less in groups (e.g., Latan&eacute;, Williams, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Harkins, 1979). More specifically, if the con-
</p>
<p>tribution of single group members is difficult 
</p>
<p>to assess, especially in larger groups, people 
</p>
<p>tend to free ride and let the others do all the 
</p>
<p>work, which results in reduced group perfor-
</p>
<p>mance (Karau &amp; Williams, 1993). Hence, it is 
</p>
<p>important that personal responsibility be 
</p>
<p>accompanied by group or individual account-
</p>
<p>ability: If group or individual work is visible 
</p>
<p>and easy to assess, it is also easy to assess all 
</p>
<p>group members&rsquo; contributions to the group

</p>
<p>interdependence?
</p>
<p>Box 8.2 Zooming In: Sources of 
</p>
<p>Interdependence
</p>
<p>When we mentioned interdependence, we 
</p>
<p>referred to goal interdependence, as this was 
</p>
<p>part of Deutsch&rsquo;s original formulation and is 
</p>
<p>necessary for cooperative learning. It is 
</p>
<p>important, however to consider other sources 
</p>
<p>of interdependence, as they may all be used 
</p>
<p>in a group to create effective cooperation. 
</p>
<p>Johnson and Johnson (1989, 2009) distin-
</p>
<p>guish three categories of interdependence: 
</p>
<p>outcome, means, and boundary interdepen-
</p>
<p>dence. Outcome interdependence refers to 
</p>
<p>desired states and includes goal interdepen-
</p>
<p>dence as well as reward interdependence: 
</p>
<p>Indeed, a group of pupils may be interde-
</p>
<p>pendent because they pursue the same 
</p>
<p>goal&mdash;handing in a project or ensuring that 
</p>
<p>all teammates learn&mdash;but also because they 
</p>
<p>expect that all the pupils who worked on the 
</p>
<p>same project will receive the same reward&mdash;
</p>
<p>a common grade or the same bonus points. 
</p>
<p>Group members may also be interdependent 
</p>
<p>because they need to share the means 
</p>
<p>involved in their work: They may have to 
</p>
<p>share complementary resources (like in the 
</p>
<p>jigsaw classroom, cf., Aronson &amp; Patnoe, 
</p>
<p>1997), take turns in complementary roles, or 
</p>
<p>each be responsible for a different task in the 
</p>
<p>same assignment. Finally, boundaries spec-
</p>
<p>ify who is interdependent with whom, typi-
</p>
<p>cally by specifying who is in a group 
</p>
<p>(interdependence) and who is in another 
</p>
<p>group (independence&mdash;unless the other 
</p>
<p>group is an ally or a rival).
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Social loafing: The reduced effort of people 
</p>
<p>in groups, as compared to individual effort. 
</p>
<p>Group members who feel unidentifiable con-
</p>
<p>tribute less to the group.

</p>
<p>goals, which increases effort and commitment 
</p>
<p>of each member. It is important to note that 
</p>
<p>each group member should genuinely endorse 
</p>
<p>personal responsibility for supporting the 
</p>
<p>team&rsquo;s goals, to avoid that accountability 
</p>
<p>merely functions as extrinsic, controlled moti-
</p>
<p>vation, bound to become inactive as soon as 
</p>
<p>assessment and control are no longer imple-
</p>
<p>mented (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000).
</p>
<p> 3. Promotive interactions. Working coopera-
</p>
<p>tively does not mean merely working together. 
</p>
<p>Actual cooperation requires teammates to 
</p>
<p>cater not only to their work but also to that of 
</p>
<p>their partners. In particular, cooperative team-
</p>
<p>mates trust each other and exchange needed 
</p>
<p>resources (e.g., Toma &amp; Butera, 2009), use 
</p>
<p>language to construct some common knowl-
</p>
<p>edge (Wegerif, Mercer, &amp; Dawes, 1999), 
</p>
<p>decenter from one&rsquo;s own point of view to 
</p>
<p>consider or even question the partner&rsquo;s point 
</p>
<p>of view (Butera &amp; Buchs, 2005), use argu-
</p>
<p>mentation (Muller Mirza &amp; Perret-Clermont, 
</p>
<p>2009), encourage others&rsquo; commitment and 
</p>
<p>accept mutual influence (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 
</p>
<p>2015), and rely on explanations and cognitive 
</p>
<p>elaboration, peer modeling, peer practice, 
</p>
<p>peer assessment, and correction (Slavin, 
</p>
<p>2011).
</p>
<p> 4. Social skills. Group locomotion toward a 
</p>
<p>common goal requires, as we have seen, a 
</p>
<p>great deal of coordination. To facilitate such a 
</p>
<p>complex endeavor, group members must be 
</p>
<p>trained and acquire a set of social skills (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Bennett, Rolheiser, &amp; Stevahn, 1991; 
</p>
<p>Johnson, Johnson, &amp; Holubec, 1993), such as 
</p>
<p>the ability to trust other group members, to 
</p>
<p>communicate in a precise and unequivocal 
</p>
<p>manner, and to tolerate and support other 
</p>
<p>members (Johnson, 2009). Most importantly, 
</p>
<p>as discussion and confrontation of points of 
</p>
<p>view may result in the emergence of conflict, 
</p>
<p>group members must learn how to regulate 
</p>
<p>conflict in a constructive manner, that is by 
</p>
<p>focusing on the task at hand and knowledge, 
</p>
<p>rather than their relative status (Buchs, 
</p>
<p>Butera, Mugny, &amp; Darnon, 2004; Johnson &amp; 
</p>
<p>Johnson, 2007; Smith, Johnson, &amp; Johnson, 
</p>
<p>1981).
</p>
<p> 5. Group processing. Group performance is pro-
</p>
<p>moted when groups engage in group process-
</p>
<p>ing, that is, take the time, after task completion, 
</p>
<p>to reflect upon their actions, communications, 
</p>
<p>decisions, and performance (Yager, Johnson, 
</p>
<p>Johnson, &amp; Snider, 1986). Such metacogni-
</p>
<p>tive processes allow groups to reconsider 
</p>
<p>decisions and avoid concurrence-seeking phe-
</p>
<p>nomena such as social loafing, as noted ear-
</p>
<p>lier, and &ldquo;groupthink&rdquo; (Janis, 1972), the 
</p>
<p>mindset of highly homogeneous groups that 
</p>
<p>fail to question their decisions and decision- 
</p>
<p>making processes (see also Esser, 1998). 
</p>
<p>Group processing is also instrumental in 
</p>
<p>developing group efficacy, cohesion, and 
</p>
<p>social identity (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009).
</p>
<p>These five principles have been shown to be 
</p>
<p>crucial, but the list is not exhaustive. For instance, 
</p>
<p>based on these elements, Topping, Buchs, Duran, 
</p>
<p>and Van Keer (2017) proposed to place promo-
</p>
<p>tive interaction (called constructive interactions 
</p>
<p>by these authors, i.e., interactions that support 
</p>
<p>learning) at the heart of cooperative methods, and 
</p>
<p>list several other elements that contribute to the 
</p>
<p>emergence of these constructive interactions in 
</p>
<p>group work.
</p>
<p> Cooperative Learning Methods
</p>
<p>The principles of social interdependence theory 
</p>
<p>have been applied to many domains, in particular 
</p>
<p>education, business, and politics. In this chapter, 
</p>
<p>we focus on cooperative learning methods in 
</p>
<p>educational settings, and will leave business and 
</p>
<p>politics aside. Interested readers may refer to 
</p>
<p>Tjosvold and Tjosvold (2015) and Johnson 
</p>
<p>(2015), respectively.
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;cooperative learning&rdquo; includes a 
</p>
<p>class of educational practices and pedagogical 
</p>
<p>methods that aim at structuring group work by 
</p>
<p>implementing the aforementioned principles of 
</p>
<p>effective cooperation (e.g., Johnson, Johnson, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Holubec, 1998). For this reason, we will use the 
</p>
<p>term &ldquo;cooperative methods&rdquo; hereafter, for greater 
</p>
<p>clarity. In fact, this class of educational practices is 
</p>
<p>not homogenous and includes a great variety of 
</p>
<p>F. Butera and C. Buchs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>117
</p>
<p>structures and methods (Johnson, Johnson, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Stanne, 2000; Topping et&nbsp;al., 2017), which may be 
</p>
<p>used formally or informally, for one session or for 
</p>
<p>one semester, at the classroom or at the school 
</p>
<p>level (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2005). This diversity 
</p>
<p>notwithstanding, several authors recommend that 
</p>
<p>cooperative groups be structured through positive 
</p>
<p>interdependence, making sure that learners feel 
</p>
<p>responsible and accountable, that they are commit-
</p>
<p>ted to promoting each other and to communicating 
</p>
<p>efficiently, in a trusting atmosphere, and in groups 
</p>
<p>that reflect upon their functioning (e.g., Topping 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2017). In other words, positive goal interde-
</p>
<p>pendence represents both the  structure of the 
</p>
<p>cooperation (ensuring that students actually work 
</p>
<p>together) and the spirit of the classroom (stimulat-
</p>
<p>ing students to take care of both their own learning 
</p>
<p>and the learning of their classmates; Topping et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2017; see also Abrami, 1995).
</p>
<p>The success of cooperative learning has pro-
</p>
<p>duced an impressive number of studies and appli-
</p>
<p>cations, which have made it possible to quantify 
</p>
<p>the effect of cooperative methods as compared to 
</p>
<p>other methods, mainly competitive and individu-
</p>
<p>alistic. Indeed, several meta-analyses have per-
</p>
<p>formed an overall assessment of the effects of 
</p>
<p>cooperative methods (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989; 
</p>
<p>Slavin, 1983), some with a focus on university 
</p>
<p>learning (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2002), some with a 
</p>
<p>focus on adolescents (Roseth, Johnson, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Johnson, 2008) or elementary school pupils 
</p>
<p>(Slavin, 2015). Hattie (2008) has combined sev-
</p>
<p>eral meta-analyses, and concluded that coopera-
</p>
<p>tive methods has an advantage in terms of 
</p>
<p>performance over comparable competitive meth-
</p>
<p>ods with an effect size of d&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.54 (with 7 meta- 
</p>
<p>analyses and 1024 studies), as well as over 
</p>
<p>individualistic methods with an effect size of 
</p>
<p>d&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.59 (with 4 meta-analyses and 774 studies). 
</p>
<p>Thus, cooperative methods appear to be effective 
</p>
<p>in promoting learning, more effective than com-
</p>
<p>petitive and individualistic methods. Cooperative 
</p>
<p>methods have been shown to promote all sorts of 
</p>
<p>learning outcomes&mdash;from short-term and long- 
</p>
<p>term recall of information to reasoning and 
</p>
<p> creativity&mdash;in a vast array of subjects (mathemat-
</p>
<p>ics, history, arts, etc.) and competences (comput-
</p>
<p>ing, reading, comprehension, etc.).
</p>
<p> Positive Interdependence 
and&nbsp;Social Comparison
</p>
<p>The abovementioned discussion and the results 
</p>
<p>from the meta-analyses reveal that cooperative 
</p>
<p>methods can be instrumental in favoring learn-
</p>
<p>ing, self-esteem, and interpersonal relations, but 
</p>
<p>also that it is no magic wand: Success rate is not 
</p>
<p>100%. Even when positive goal interdependence 
</p>
<p>is implemented, and group members know that 
</p>
<p>they should strive for a common purpose, social 
</p>
<p>comparison is at work and occupies a great deal 
</p>
<p>of the group members&rsquo; attention (cf. Butera &amp; 
</p>
<p>Darnon, 2017). Social comparison is a basic phe-
</p>
<p>nomenon that assesses one&rsquo;s competence in rela-
</p>
<p>tion to that of similar others (Festinger, 1954; for 
</p>
<p>Box 8.3  Zooming In: Positive Effects of 
</p>
<p>Cooperative Methods
</p>
<p>It is important to note that, in addition to 
</p>
<p>the positive effects on learning outcomes, 
</p>
<p>cooperative learning yields positive effects 
</p>
<p>on self- esteem and interpersonal relations 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989). The effects 
</p>
<p>on self-esteem derive from the perception 
</p>
<p>of being helpful and accepted typical of 
</p>
<p>positive interdependence, which has also 
</p>
<p>been shown to lead to better coping with 
</p>
<p>stress and overall psychological and physi-
</p>
<p>cal health (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2006). 
</p>
<p>The positive effects on interpersonal rela-
</p>
<p>tions cover a wide range of behaviors, from 
</p>
<p>perspective taking to listening, from greater 
</p>
<p>group cohesion to lower absenteeism and 
</p>
<p>fewer dropouts (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2006). 
</p>
<p>They also include greater acceptance of 
</p>
<p>diversity (Sharan, 2010), from students of 
</p>
<p>different ethnic backgrounds (Aronson &amp; 
</p>
<p>Patnoe, 1997) and language (Buchs, 
</p>
<p>Margas, Cazin, Ramirez, &amp; Fratianni, 2018) 
</p>
<p>to students with disability (Johnson, 
</p>
<p>Johnson, &amp; Maruyama, 1983).

</p>
<p>a detailed discussion of social comparison theory 
</p>
<p>see Utz, Chap. 14, this volume). Importantly for 
</p>
<p>the present discussion, social comparison can be 
</p>
<p>either inspiring or threatening for self-compe-
</p>
<p>tence: It is inspiring when the partner may be 
</p>
<p>considered as a source of help or information, or 
</p>
<p>a model, and it is threatening when the partner 
</p>
<p>may be considered as a source of humiliation or 
</p>
<p>inferiority, or a competitor (Muller &amp; Fayant, 
</p>
<p>2010). It is important to note that social com-
</p>
<p>parison can be either inspiring or threatening 
</p>
<p>whatever the direction of the comparison, be it 
</p>
<p>upward (comparing with a superior partner) or 
</p>
<p>downward (comparing with an inferior partner), 
</p>
<p>as noted by Butera and Darnon (2017; see also 
</p>
<p>Buunk, Collins, Taylor, VanYperen, &amp; Dakof, 
</p>
<p>1990). Even in a cooperative setting, inspiring and 
</p>
<p>threatening comparisons may coexist, as demon-
</p>
<p>strated by Buchs, Butera, and Mugny (2004); 
</p>
<p>Buchs, Pulfrey, Gabarrot, and Butera (2010); and 
</p>
<p>more recently by Roseth, Lee, and Saltarelli 
</p>
<p>(2019). We will develop this work in a following 
</p>
<p>section.
</p>
<p>The question then arises of how to ensure that 
</p>
<p>cooperative method, which is designed to pro-
</p>
<p>mote positive interpersonal relationships, does 
</p>
<p>not end up rendering partners threatening to each 
</p>
<p>other. Buchs and Butera (2001) addressed this 
</p>
<p>question by proposing that, besides positive goal 
</p>
<p>interdependence, it is important to efficiently 
</p>
<p>implement other positive interdependences in 
</p>
<p>cooperative learning, in particular resource inter-
</p>
<p>dependence (see also Darnon, Buchs, &amp; Butera, 
</p>
<p>2002). They devised an experimental paradigm 
</p>
<p>with, among others, two conditions: positive 
</p>
<p>resource interdependence and resource indepen-
</p>
<p>dence. In all conditions two partners were given 
</p>
<p>two texts they were asked to learn (and help their 
</p>
<p>partner to learn), and were informed that a learn-
</p>
<p>ing test would take place&mdash;on the two texts&mdash;at 
</p>
<p>the end of the learning session, and again later in 
</p>
<p>a delayed test (positive goal interdependence). 
</p>
<p>Each partner was in charge of presenting one text, 
</p>
<p>while the other facilitated the presentation with 
</p>
<p>questions, one text at a time (positive role interde-
</p>
<p>pendence). In the positive resource interdepen-
</p>
<p>dence condition, the two partners each received a 
</p>
<p>different text; the two texts were complementary 
</p>
<p>(they were both necessary for the learning test), 
</p>
<p>but each student learned one text by reading it and 
</p>
<p>the other by listening to the partner. In the resource 
</p>
<p>independence condition, the two partners received

<p>Box 8.4 Questions for Elaboration
</p>
<p>Teachers often call one of the pupils in 
</p>
<p>front of the class to read a particularly 
</p>
<p>well- written essay. In which circumstances 
</p>
<p>will this pupil be inspiring? In which will 
</p>
<p>the pupil be threatening?

</p>
<p>both texts; the two partners then possessed identi-
</p>
<p>cal information, and each student presented one 
</p>
<p>of them to the partner, in turn. As noted by Buchs 
</p>
<p>and Butera (2015), in positive resource interde-
</p>
<p>pendence, as compared to resource independence, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;knowing that the other is dependent on oneself 
</p>
<p>for accessing some information and that oneself is 
</p>
<p>also dependent on the partner to access some 
</p>
<p>other information would direct students to be 
</p>
<p>more involved in information exchange&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;205). 
</p>
<p>This is also supposed to elicit a series of other 
</p>
<p>positive dynamics, summarized in Table&nbsp;8.1.
</p>
<p> Inspiring and&nbsp;Threatening Partners
</p>
<p>The distinction between positive resource inter-
</p>
<p>dependence and resource independence is 
</p>
<p>important and has been shown to influence not 
</p>
<p>only partner perception and interpersonal rela-
</p>
<p>tions, but also learning. In a study based on the 
</p>
<p>general paradigm outlined earlier and conducted 
</p>
<p>with university students, Buchs, Butera, and 
</p>
<p>Mugny (2004), Study 2) measured the partici-
</p>
<p>pants&rsquo; perception of the partner&rsquo;s competence on 
</p>
<p>two important aspects of their interaction, 
</p>
<p>namely, perceived competence to understand 
</p>
<p>information and perceived competence to sum-
</p>
<p>marize information. Learning outcomes were 
</p>
<p>measured through a multiple-choice test with 
</p>
<p>questions related to the texts students had to read 
</p>
<p>and present. The questions required from the stu-
</p>
<p>dents a thorough comprehension of the study 
</p>
<p>matter, not just recall or recognition, and the 
</p>
<p>questionnaire was administered 1&nbsp; month after 
</p>
<p>the experimental sessions. Results revealed that 
</p>
<p>when dyads worked with complementary texts 
</p>
<p>(positive resource interdependence), perceived 
</p>
<p>partner competence was positively related to a 
</p>
<p>delayed measure of learning, as it should be in a 
</p>
<p>genuine cooperative learning setting. In other 
</p>
<p>words, the more competent the partner was per-
</p>
<p>ceived, the higher the learning outcomes score. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, partners who are considered as more 
</p>
<p>competent are more inspiring and more instru-
</p>
<p>mental toward better learning. On the contrary, 
</p>
<p>when dyads worked with identical texts (resource 
</p>
<p>independence), perceived partner competence 
</p>
<p>was negatively related to learning. In this case, a 
</p>
<p>competent partner represented a threatening 
</p>
<p>comparison  target and reduced learning. 
</p>
<p>Importantly, these results were replicated in a 
</p>
<p>study conducted with primary school children 
</p>
<p>(see Buchs &amp; Butera, 2015). In this work, actual 
</p>
<p>performance of the partner was measured (num-
</p>
<p>ber of correct pieces of information and explana-
</p>
<p>tions provided), instead of perceived partner 
</p>
<p>competence, but the results of the two studies 
</p>
<p>followed the same pattern as the results of Buchs 
</p>
<p>and colleagues (2004).
</p>
<p>Buchs and Butera (2009) also provided exper-
</p>
<p>imental evidence of this phenomenon in a study 
</p>
<p>that manipulated the partner&rsquo;s competence. A 
</p>
<p>confederate entered the laboratory with the par-
</p>
<p>ticipant and was assigned the role of summarizer 
</p>
<p>for the first text, whereas the participant was to 
</p>
<p>play the role of facilitator. The roles were reversed 
</p>
<p>for the second text, but the measure of interest is 
</p>
<p>the learning test for the first text. Indeed, the con-
</p>
<p>federate had been instructed to deliver a sum-
</p>
<p>mary that was either brilliant or average, 
</p>
<p>depending on the condition. Even though the 
</p>
<p>content was identical in all conditions, in the bril-
</p>
<p>liant condition the confederate came with a very 
</p>
<p>well-organized summary, with headings and 
</p>
<p>well-defined technical terms. The confederate&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>notes started with an introduction, elaborated on 
</p>
<p>all the important notions, and concluded on the 
</p>
<p>most important information. In the average con-
</p>
<p>dition, the confederate came with quite a disorga-
</p>
<p>nized summary, often went back to a previous 
</p>
<p>matter because of omissions, and used approxi-
</p>
<p>mate terms. The results confirmed those of Buchs 
</p>
<p>and colleagues (2004): When the dyad worked 
</p>
<p>with complementary texts (positive resource 
</p>
<p>interdependence), a brilliant partner induced bet-
</p>
<p>ter learning than an average partner, whereas 
</p>
<p>when the dyad worked with identical texts 
</p>
<p>(resource independence), a brilliant partner 
</p>
<p>induced worse learning than an average partner. 
</p>
<p>Thus, a competent partner, who should have rep-
</p>
<p>resented an informational support in all condi-
</p>
<p>tions, appeared to promote learning outcomes 
</p>
<p>only in the positive interdependence condition 
</p>
<p>(for similar findings, see Neugebauer, Ray, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Sassenberg, 2016).

</p>
<p> Competence Threat
</p>
<p>In the studies by Buchs and colleagues (2004) 
</p>
<p>and Buchs and Butera (2009), the interpretation 
</p>
<p>of results is based on the idea that, notwithstand-
</p>
<p>ing the positive goal interdependence of a coop-
</p>
<p>erative setting, a threatening social comparison 
</p>
<p>may take place under resource independence, 
</p>
<p>which would explain the detrimental effects that 
</p>
<p>were found. A further study directly addressed 
</p>
<p>the question of competence threat (Buchs et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2010). The main experiment in this article manip-
</p>
<p>ulated, as before, the way resources were distrib-
</p>
<p>uted, as well as focus on social comparison, by 
</p>
<p>allowing or not allowing students to take notes. 
</p>
<p>The rationale for the latter manipulation was that 
</p>
<p>notes allow direct comparison and confrontation 
</p>
<p>of responses, which was confirmed by a pilot 
</p>
<p>study. Results showed that a focus on social com-
</p>
<p>parison did reduce learning, but in the resource 
</p>
<p>independence condition and not in the positive 
</p>
<p>resource interdependence condition. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>and most importantly for the present contention, 
</p>
<p>this effect was mediated by competence threat, 
</p>
<p>namely, an aggregate measure that referred to the 
</p>
<p>participants&rsquo; concerns regarding the social com-
</p>
<p>parison of competences with the partner. Thus, it 
</p>
<p>appears that resource independence, as opposed 
</p>
<p>to positive resource interdependence, leads part-
</p>
<p>ners to make sense of social comparison in terms 
</p>
<p>of potential threat&mdash;a comparison that might be 
</p>
<p>problematic for one&rsquo;s competence&mdash;which 
</p>
<p>results in reduced learning.
</p>
<p>These results are consistent with those of Ray, 
</p>
<p>Neugebauer, Sassenberg, Buder, and Hesse (2013, 
</p>
<p>Study 3), where participants who were not con-
</p>
<p>cerned by evaluative pressure (either positive or 
</p>
<p>negative) achieved better learning outcomes when 
</p>
<p>they were made aware of the possible positive 
</p>
<p>resource interdependence with the partner (aware-
</p>
<p>ness of the partner&rsquo;s knowledge), than when they 
</p>
<p>were not. To summarize, the results of Buchs et&nbsp;al. 
</p>
<p>(2010) suggest that the benefits of cooperative 
</p>
<p>learning require a carefully designed classroom 
</p>
<p>setting to emerge: Distributing identical informa-
</p>
<p>tion to partners (resource independence) resulted in 
</p>
<p>competence threat and reduced learning outcomes 
</p>
<p>even in a cooperative setting with positive goal 
</p>
<p>interdependence that should promote learning.
</p>
<p> The Promotion of&nbsp;Cooperative 
Methods
</p>
<p>According to Deutsch (1985), it is much easier to 
</p>
<p>move from cooperation to competition than to 
</p>
<p>revert from competition to cooperation. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>in Western industrial countries, competition is 
</p>
<p>pervasive, not only from an economic point of 
</p>
<p>view but also when considering the dominant val-
</p>
<p>ues of these countries. Accordingly, Schwartz 
</p>
<p>(2007) has shown that self-enhancement values 
</p>
<p>(wealth, power, achievement) are typical of coun-
</p>
<p>tries with a capitalistic economy, especially those 
</p>
<p>with more deregulated forms of capitalism (see 
</p>
<p>also, Pulfrey &amp; Butera, 2013). Western industrial-
</p>
<p>ized countries are also more likely to display a 
</p>
<p>population with independent selves, as compared 
</p>
<p>to Eastern countries where people&rsquo;s selves tend to 
</p>
<p>be more interdependent (Markus &amp; Kitayama, 
</p>
<p>1991). Moreover, the functioning of educational 
</p>
<p>institutions, from school to university, is based on 
</p>
<p>practices that induce competition among students 
</p>
<p>(e.g., grading; cf. Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998; Pulfrey, 
</p>
<p>Buchs, &amp; Butera, 2011), and students have learned 
</p>
<p>that setting competitive achievement goals for 
</p>
<p>themselves may be useful to succeed (e.g., Darnon, 
</p>
<p>Dompnier, Delmas, Pulfrey, &amp; Butera, 2009; 
</p>
<p>Dompnier, Darnon, Delmas, &amp; Butera, 2008).
</p>
<p>In such a competitive environment, it is pos-
</p>
<p>sible that implementing cooperative learning 
</p>
<p>might seem at loggerheads with the values and 
</p>
<p>practices of a given educational institution, 
</p>
<p>Box 8.5 Question for Elaboration
</p>
<p>In professional settings, it often happens 
</p>
<p>that employees are required to work in 
</p>
<p>teams and are given a background training 
</p>
<p>on the whole of the task at hand, which 
</p>
<p>corresponds to possessing identical infor-
</p>
<p>mation. How can a supervisor prevent that 
</p>
<p>the inevitable issues of relative status of 
</p>
<p>team members interfere with the work to 
</p>
<p>be completed?

</p>
<p>which might reduce acceptance of this method 
</p>
<p>or lead to its failure. Thus, cooperative methods 
</p>
<p>cannot be merely proposed or implemented; it 
</p>
<p>must be promoted. In this respect, Buchs (2017) 
</p>
<p>has highlighted an important distinction within 
</p>
<p>the elements that constitute cooperative learning. 
</p>
<p>She explained that elements such as positive 
</p>
<p>interdependence or accountability are important 
</p>
<p>because they structure the way cooperative 
</p>
<p>learning is actually organized in groups, while 
</p>
<p>some others such as social skills, group process-
</p>
<p>ing, and climate are important because they pre-
</p>
<p>pare the group members to interact cooperatively. 
</p>
<p>In other words, a rigorous cooperative structure 
</p>
<p>should be accompanied by some training, in 
</p>
<p>order to allow students to move from an otherwise 
</p>
<p>competitive environment to a cooperative setting 
</p>
<p>(see also Webb, 2009).
</p>
<p>With this in mind, Buchs, Gilles, Antonietti, 
</p>
<p>and Butera (2016) devised an experimental inter-
</p>
<p>vention intended to promote cooperative learning 
</p>
<p>in an area in which students experience great dif-
</p>
<p>ficulties: statistics (Tomasetto, Matteucci, 
</p>
<p>Carugati, &amp; Selleri, 2009). The intervention was 
</p>
<p>carried out during a statistics course, where it was 
</p>
<p>presented as a study on how students process 
</p>
<p>information about statistics. During a 90-minute 
</p>
<p>workshop, students reviewed the materials from 
</p>
<p>the previous week (set theory), worked on two 
</p>
<p>exercises related to the theory&mdash;allegedly as a 
</p>
<p>training for the individual learning test&mdash; and 
</p>
<p>finally sat the learning test, which was then used 
</p>
<p>as the main dependent variable. The learning test 
</p>
<p>included two types of questions: (a) a replication 
</p>
<p>of the exercises completed in the previous steps of 
</p>
<p>the study, but using new data (data not discussed 
</p>
<p>during the statistics lecture); and (b) completely 
</p>
<p>new exercises that required the generalization of 
</p>
<p>the mathematical principles of set theory to a 
</p>
<p>real-life situation.
</p>
<p>The independent variable was manipulated 
</p>
<p>during the exercise phase. The individual work 
</p>
<p>condition (independence) was a control condi-
</p>
<p>tion in which students worked alone on their 
</p>
<p>study materials and exercises and was intended 
</p>
<p>as a baseline that corresponds to the most com-
</p>
<p>mon study strategy at university. The other two 
</p>
<p>conditions involved working cooperatively in 
</p>
<p>dyads. In both conditions, the experimental 
</p>
<p>instructions introduced positive goal interdepen-
</p>
<p>dence, individual responsibility/accountability, 
</p>
<p>and encouragement of promotive interactions 
</p>
<p>(Fig.&nbsp;8.2). The cooperative instructions condition 
</p>
<p>only included these instructions and corre-
</p>
<p>sponded to the basic structure implemented in 
</p>
<p>cooperative learning. Finally, the cooperative 
</p>
<p>interactions condition included the same three 
</p>
<p>elements, but also introduced a &ldquo;cooperative 
</p>
<p>nudge,&rdquo; which consisted of two components. (1) 
</p>
<p>The first component was introduced by a short 
</p>
<p>text explaining the value of cooperation and the 
</p>
<p>virtues of active listening and discussion. As

</p>
<p>mentioned earlier, cooperative values are not the 
</p>
<p>default culture of university students in Western 
</p>
<p>countries. (2) The second component was a series 
</p>
<p>of recommendations inviting students to display 
</p>
<p>three cooperative skills: &ldquo;(a) explain how one 
</p>
<p>processes problems, (b) be sure to understand the 
</p>
<p>way the partner processes problems, and (c) sug-
</p>
<p>gest alternative ways to process problems&rdquo; (Buchs 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2016, p.&nbsp;965; Table&nbsp;8.2). As mentioned ear-
</p>
<p>lier, active cooperation is not the default behavior 
</p>
<p>among students.
</p>
<p>The results revealed a linear trend in the pattern 
</p>
<p>of learning outcomes across the three  conditions, 
</p>
<p>with the individual work condition scoring the 
</p>
<p>lowest, followed by the cooperative instructions 
</p>
<p>condition, and then by the cooperative interactions 
</p>
<p>condition (Fig.&nbsp; 8.2). Interestingly, competence 
</p>
<p>perception was also measured, through three 
</p>
<p>items (&ldquo;I realized that I had understood some 
</p>
<p>things,&rdquo; &ldquo;I felt I was able to master the work,&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt I was competent&rdquo;). The results revealed 
</p>
<p>that competence perception progressed in the 
</p>
<p>same direction as learning outcomes, and that it 
</p>
<p>mediated the effect of the experimental condi-
</p>
<p>tions on learning.
</p>
<p>To conclude, this study shows that instructors 
</p>
<p>may be well advised to prepare students to coop-
</p>
<p>erate, before implementing cooperative learning, 
</p>
<p>as cooperation is neither a value nor a common 
</p>
<p>practice in education. This conclusion illustrates 
</p>
<p>one of the main pitfalls in the use of cooperation 
</p>
<p>in education, namely, the difference between 
</p>
<p>structured and unstructured cooperation. The 
</p>
<p>work on cooperative learning has long shown that 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; cooperation&mdash;simply relying on 
</p>
<p>the encouragement to cooperate&mdash;does not hap-

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; The nature of goal structure in groups 
</p>
<p>affects group members&rsquo; perceptions and 
</p>
<p>behaviors, which in turn influence their 
</p>
<p>learning outcomes.
</p>
<p>&bull; People interact cooperatively in groups 
</p>
<p>when they perceive positive goal inter-
</p>
<p>dependence, or competitively when they 
</p>
<p>perceive negative goal interdependence. 
</p>
<p>With independent goals, they work 
</p>
<p>individually.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cooperation requires positive goal 
</p>
<p>interdependence, but also group mem-
</p>
<p>bers&rsquo; responsibility and accountability, 
</p>
<p>interactions directed toward the promo-
</p>
<p>tion of the partners, the use of social 
</p>
<p>skills, and critical reflection upon group 
</p>
<p>processes.

<p>pen in most educational and work settings: 
</p>
<p>Cooperative methods have been developed pre-
</p>
<p>cisely to provide a structured environment that 
</p>
<p>facilitates cooperative communication, informa-
</p>
<p>tion sharing, and relationships (e.g., Johnson &amp; 
</p>
<p>Johnson, 1999; Tjosvold, 1984). The research 
</p>
<p>reported in this section contributed to this 
</p>
<p>endeavor by highlighting the importance of pre-
</p>
<p>paring students and workers to cooperate in order 
</p>
<p>to counter, to some extent, the prevalently com-
</p>
<p>petitive routines they have acquired. The results 
</p>
<p>presented here show that a brief intervention may 
</p>
<p>be effective, but Buchs et&nbsp; al. (2016) also noted 
</p>
<p>that the effect size they observed is rather small. 
</p>
<p>This implies that longer or more frequent inter-
</p>
<p>ventions may be needed.

<p> Guiding Answers to&nbsp;Questions 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Q (with Box 8.1): Imagine a cohesive and 
</p>
<p>cooperative volleyball team. Give an example 
</p>
<p>describing how substitutability, positive 
</p>
<p>cathexis and inducibility intervene during a 
</p>
<p>match.
</p>
<p>A: During a smash from the other team, 
</p>
<p>player X&rsquo;s effective dive to catch the ball 
</p>
<p>reduces player Y&rsquo;s need to intervene (substi-
</p>
<p>tutability); this results in Y trusting X during 
</p>
<p>the following action (positive cathexis) and 
</p>
<p>avoiding to dive at the same time as X 
</p>
<p>(inducibility).
</p>
<p> 2. Q (with Fig.&nbsp;8.1): Why are responsibility and 
</p>
<p>accountability important to cooperation? 
</p>
<p>What do they add to positive goal 
</p>
<p>interdependence?
</p>
<p>A: Because, even in a group that pursues a 
</p>
<p>common goal, some members may be tempted 
</p>
<p>to free ride and benefit from the group&rsquo;s work 
</p>
<p>without investing some effort.
</p>
<p> 3. Q (with Box 8.3): Could cooperative learning 
</p>
<p>be used to integrate migrant children in the 
</p>
<p>host country&rsquo;s regular classes?
</p>
<p>A: Cooperative learning has been shown to be 
</p>
<p>helpful in improving the learning and interper-
</p>
<p>&bull; Cooperative methods favor learning 
</p>
<p>outcomes, psychological as well as 
</p>
<p>social adjustment, and positive relation-
</p>
<p>ships, as compared to competitive and 
</p>
<p>individualistic methods.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cooperation is vulnerable to threatening 
</p>
<p>social comparison: Interactions among 
</p>
<p>group members that focus on relative 
</p>
<p>status instead of the task may reduce the 
</p>
<p>beneficial effects of cooperation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cooperation is not socially and cultur-
</p>
<p>ally valued in Western countries, and 
</p>
<p>therefore cooperative learning requires 
</p>
<p>training and promotion.

</p>
<p> 4. Q (with Box 8.4): Teachers often call one of 
</p>
<p>the pupils in front of the class to read a par-
</p>
<p>ticularly well written essay. In which circum-
</p>
<p>stances will this pupil be inspiring? Which 
</p>
<p>will be threatening?
</p>
<p>A: If this pupil is a possible companion (e.g., 
</p>
<p>a future partner for an assignment), s/he will 
</p>
<p>be perceived as a source of inspiration. If the 
</p>
<p>pupil is a possible rival (e.g., the teacher&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>pet), s/he will be perceived as a source of 
</p>
<p>threat.
</p>
<p> 5. Q (with Box 8.5): In professional settings, it 
</p>
<p>often happens that employees are required to 
</p>
<p>work in teams and are given a background 
</p>
<p>training on the whole of the task at hand, 
</p>
<p>which corresponds to possessing identical 
</p>
<p>information. How can a supervisor prevent 
</p>
<p>that the inevitable issues of relative status of 
</p>
<p>team members interfere with the work to be 
</p>
<p>completed?
</p>
<p>A: Divide the task and the resources in comple-
</p>
<p>mentary chunks and distribute them to different 
</p>
<p>employees with complementary roles.

<p> The Groups in&nbsp;You
</p>
<p>Think for a moment about the different groups 
</p>
<p>you belong to. Which groups come to mind? 
</p>
<p>Maybe a sports team, your gender, the community 
</p>
<p>in which you grew-up, a group of study-friends, 
</p>
<p>an online community where you play games, or 
</p>
<p>the political party you voted for during the last 
</p>
<p>elections. Or maybe you even think about a very 
</p>
<p>abstract category, like left-handers. When reflect-
</p>
<p>ing on these groups, what do you think about? 
</p>
<p>And what do you feel?
</p>
<p>When reflecting on the groups you belong to, 
</p>
<p>you likely discover that you are not only a part of 
</p>
<p>these groups but that these groups are also a part 
</p>
<p>of you. That is, group membership (partly) defines 
</p>
<p>your identity: Groups tell us who we are (and who 
</p>
<p>we are not). Relatedly, groups also partly deter-
</p>
<p>mine our feelings. We can have a mild, warm feel-
</p>
<p>ing when thinking about our fellow group 
</p>
<p>members but can also feel anger when our group 
</p>
<p>is mistreated or guilt when in-group members 
</p>
<p>mistreat others.
</p>
<p>The thoughts and feelings that arise when you 
</p>
<p>think about the groups you belong to form your 
</p>
<p>social identity. More precisely defined, social 
</p>
<p>identity is &ldquo;that part of an individual&rsquo;s self- concept 
</p>
<p>which derives from knowledge of membership in a 
</p>
<p>social group (or groups) together with the value or 
</p>
<p>emotional significance attached to that member-
</p>
<p>ship&rdquo; (Tajfel, 1978, p.&nbsp;63).</p>

<p>The current chapter provides an overview of 
</p>
<p>the main theoretical perspective on social iden-
</p>
<p>tity, namely, social identity theory (SIT; Tajfel &amp; 
</p>
<p>Turner, 1979). SIT is a rich theoretical perspec-
</p>
<p>tive integrating group psychology with psychol-
</p>
<p>ogy about the self. The theory also has substantial 
</p>
<p>practical value and has been used to analyze 
</p>
<p>important issues in organizations and society at 
</p>
<p>large and to design interventions. In the current 
</p>
<p>chapter, we focus in particular on applications in 
</p>
<p>the context of health and organizational psychol-
</p>
<p>ogy. We conclude by describing a social identity-
</p>
<p>based intervention for improving intergroup 
</p>
<p>relations in an educational setting. Before 
</p>
<p>describing these fields of application in more 
</p>
<p>detail, in the next section, we first outline the 
</p>
<p>principles of SIT.
</p>
<p> The Principles of&nbsp;Social Identity 
Theory
</p>
<p>Social identity theory roughly consists of two 
</p>
<p>parts. The first, more basic psychological part, 
</p>
<p>describes the cognitive processes underlying 
</p>
<p>social identity definition and the motivational 
</p>
<p>assumption that people strive for a positive 
</p>
<p>social identity. The second, socio-structural part 
</p>
<p>describes how people cope with a negative 
</p>
<p>social identity. Before discussing these two 
</p>
<p>parts, we first provide a short historical 
</p>
<p> background, by describing the &ldquo;minimal 
</p>
<p>group&nbsp; experiments&rdquo; that stimulated the devel-
</p>
<p>opment of SIT.
</p>
<p> Groups, Just in&nbsp;Their Minds
</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, Henri Tajfel, a cognitive psy-
</p>
<p>chologist at the University of Bristol, England, 
</p>
<p>who would become the founding father of SIT, 
</p>
<p>conducted research on the minimal criteria for 
</p>
<p>group formation and the minimal conditions for 
</p>
<p>in-group favoritism to occur. To this end he 
</p>
<p>designed a clever experimental setup where groups 
</p>
<p>were stripped-down to their basic cognitive 
</p>
<p>essence. Students who participated in the experi-
</p>
<p>ments were allocated to one of two groups, osten-
</p>
<p>sibly on the basis of their preference for either the 
</p>
<p>painter &ldquo;Klee&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kandinsky.&rdquo; This was actually 
</p>
<p>the only information that participants had: That 
</p>
<p>there were two groups, and they were a member of 
</p>
<p>one of them. There was no interaction within or 
</p>
<p>between the groups; the groups thus only existed 
</p>
<p>in the participants&rsquo; minds, and in that sense they 
</p>
<p>were truly &ldquo;minimal.&rdquo; After being assigned to one 
</p>
<p>of the groups, participants allocated small amounts 
</p>
<p>of money between anonymous members of the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Klee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kandinsky&rdquo; group (excluding them-
</p>
<p>selves). The results of these resource allocations 
</p>
<p>indicated that participants favored people of their 
</p>
<p>own group above those who had been assigned to 
</p>
<p>the other group (Tajfel, 1970).
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Social Identity: &ldquo;That part of an individu-
</p>
<p>al&rsquo;s self-concept which derives from his 
</p>
<p>knowledge of his membership in a social 
</p>
<p>group (or groups) together with the value 
</p>
<p>or emotional significance attached to that 
</p>
<p>membership&rdquo; (Tajfel, 1978, p.&nbsp;63)
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Minimal Group: Membership of a minimal 
</p>
<p>group is based on a relatively arbitrary crite-
</p>
<p>rion, like being an &ldquo;overestimater&rdquo; or an 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;underestimator&rdquo; on an estimation task or 
</p>
<p>simply resulting from a flip of a coin (Heads, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;group A&rdquo;; Tails, &ldquo;Group B&rdquo;). Moreover, in 
</p>
<p>the classic minimal group paradigm, group 
</p>
<p>members are anonymous, and there is no 
</p>
<p>interaction within or between the groups. As 
</p>
<p>a result, minimal groups are purely cogni-
</p>
<p>tive, i.e., they only exist in the minds of the 
</p>
<p>group members. This means that minimal 
</p>
<p>groups are socially meaningless outside the 
</p>
<p>direct experimental context: they do not have 
</p>
<p>a past nor a future.

</p>
<p>The findings of the minimal group studies 
</p>
<p>were surprising because they conflicted with the 
</p>
<p>main perspective on intergroup relations by the 
</p>
<p>time: realistic conflict theory (Sherif &amp; Sherif, 
</p>
<p>1969). According to that perspective, real conflict 
</p>
<p>over scarce material resources (money, housing, 
</p>
<p>food) was necessary for intergroup conflict to 
</p>
<p>arise. Although the participants in the minimal 
</p>
<p>group studies allocated more money to their own 
</p>
<p>group than to the other group, there was no way in 
</p>
<p>which the person himself or herself could directly 
</p>
<p>profit from this. Later studies also showed that 
</p>
<p>such in-group bias in the minimal group paradigm 
</p>
<p>emerges along more symbolic dimensions, for 
</p>
<p>example, when rating the in-group and out-group 
</p>
<p>on traits or when rating artistic products made by 
</p>
<p>in-group and out-group members (Scheepers, 
</p>
<p>Spears, Doosje, &amp; Manstead, 2006). This all sug-
</p>
<p>gested that real conflict over material resources is 
</p>
<p>not necessary for in-group favoritism to emerge. 
</p>
<p>But what could then account for it?
</p>
<p> From Category to&nbsp;Identity
</p>
<p>To explain the results of the minimal group 
</p>
<p>experiments, Tajfel proposed that the persons had 
</p>
<p>categorized themselves as a member of the mini-
</p>
<p>mal category they had been assigned to, the Klee 
</p>
<p>or Kandinsky group. That is, the group had 
</p>
<p>become part of the person&rsquo;s identity. But how 
</p>
<p>could this explain in-group favoritism? Tajfel 
</p>
<p>argued that people strive for a positive social 
</p>
<p>identity, just as they strive for a positive personal 
</p>
<p>identity (the part of identity that makes you a 
</p>
<p>relatively &ldquo;unique&rdquo; individual). In the absence of 
</p>
<p>further information about the value of the group, 
</p>
<p>showing in-group favoritism was the only way in 
</p>
<p>which people in the minimal intergroup situation 
</p>
<p>could positively differentiate the in-group from 
</p>
<p>the out-group. Thus, striving for positive group 
</p>
<p>distinctiveness, and thus a positive social identity, 
</p>
<p>explains in-group favoritism in the minimal 
</p>
<p>group paradigm.
</p>
<p>The more general and basic psychological 
</p>
<p>processes underlying social identity definition 
</p>
<p>and striving for a positive social identity, which 
</p>
<p>form the heart of SIT, are displayed in Fig.&nbsp;9.1. 
</p>
<p>The theory starts with the notion that social cate-
</p>
<p>gorization, i.e., dividing the social world into 
</p>
<p>groups, is by definition self-relevant: You always 
</p>
<p>belong to one of the two social categories or a 
</p>
<p>third (e.g., outsider) category. For example, when 
</p>
<p>seeing two crowds of football fans, this may 
</p>
<p>make salient your identification with one of these 
</p>
<p>teams, a third team, or even with the category of 
</p>
<p>people &ldquo;not interested in football.&rdquo; For each of 
</p>
<p>these possibilities, the basic cognitive social cat-
</p>
<p>egorization process implies a part of your iden-
</p>
<p>tity. This self-categorization in combination with 
</p>
<p>the motivation for a positive social identity elicits 
</p>
<p>social comparison with relevant  out- groups 
</p>
<p>aimed at positively differentiating the in-group 
</p>
<p>from these out-groups (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979).
</p>
<p>Box 9.1 Questions for Elaboration: Your 
</p>
<p>Money or Your Identity?
</p>
<p>Social identity theory and realistic conflict 
</p>
<p>theory stress different primary factors 
</p>
<p>underlying intergroup attitudes: social 
</p>
<p>identity stresses identity, whereas realistic 
</p>
<p>conflict theory stresses material resources. 
</p>
<p>Think for a moment about negative atti-
</p>
<p>tudes toward migrants. Which arguments 
</p>
<p>related to identity or instrumental factors 
</p>
<p>are typically put forward? Then think about 
</p>
<p>the striding European integration. Which 
</p>
<p>instrumental or identity factors play a role 
</p>
<p>in attitudes toward the European Union?
</p>
<p>Box 9.2 Zooming In: Preventing 
</p>
<p>Discrimination by Expanding &ldquo;We&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Social identity theory describes how iden-
</p>
<p>tity motives can form the basis of in-group 
</p>
<p>favoritism. Can the same identity principles 
</p>
<p>also be applied for intervening intergroup 
</p>
<p>conflict? The common in-group identity 
</p>
<p>model (Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000) does 
</p>
<p>9 Social Identity Theory</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>132
</p>
<p>When successfully differentiating the in-group 
</p>
<p>in a positive way from out-groups, this contrib-
</p>
<p>utes to a positive social identity. Such a positive 
</p>
<p>sense of self does in turn serve basic human needs 
</p>
<p>like the need for certainty and the need for 
</p>
<p>self- esteem. Moreover, by partly defining the 
</p>
<p>place of the individual in the social world, creat-
</p>
<p>ing positive group distinctiveness also serves 
</p>
<p>the search for meaning: it tells us who we are 
</p>
<p>(and who we are not), where we belong, and how 
</p>
<p>we should behave (Abrams &amp; Hogg, 1988; 
</p>
<p>Scheepers et&nbsp;al., 2006).
</p>
<p>Thus, the basis of SIT is formed by cognitive 
</p>
<p>processes (categorization, social comparison) in 
</p>
<p>combination with the motivation to obtain a posi-
</p>
<p>tive social identity. However, as illustrated with 
</p>
<p>our opening examples, there are also important 
</p>
<p>affective aspects to social identity. Indeed, more 
</p>
<p>modern conceptualizations of social identity dis-
</p>
<p>tinguish among different components of social 
</p>
<p>identity, like cognitive components (self-catego-
</p>
<p>rization or self- stereotyping), affective compo-
</p>
<p>nents (self-esteem or satisfaction), and behavioral 
</p>
<p>components (group commitment or solidarity) 
</p>
<p>(Ellemers, Kortekaas, &amp; Ouwerkerk, 1999; 
</p>
<p>Leach, Ellemers, &amp; Barreto, 2007; Ouwerkerk, 
</p>
<p>Ellemers, &amp; De Gilder, 1999). These different 
</p>
<p>components are also reflected in the different 
</p>
<p>items and scales that are typically used to mea-
</p>
<p>sure identification (see Table&nbsp;9.1).
</p>
<p>At this point you may wonder &ldquo;what&rsquo;s then so 
</p>
<p>social about social identity theory&rdquo;? Indeed, 
</p>
<p>these intrapersonal cognitive processes and 
</p>
<p>motives for certainty, esteem, and meaning might

<p>Dividing the social world

<p>relevant: You always

<p>belong to one of the 
</p>
<p>groups or a third (e.g., 
</p>
<p>outsider) group. This lays 
</p>
<p>the basis for social 
</p>
<p>identity.
</p>
<p>People are motivated to 
</p>
<p>obtain a positive social 
</p>
<p>identity through positive 
</p>
<p>intergroup social 
</p>
<p>comparisons.
</p>
<p>A positive social identity 
</p>
<p>serves basic needs for 
</p>
<p>certainty, self-esteem, 
</p>
<p>and meaning.
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.1 Social identity definition
</p>
<p>indeed suggest they can. More specifically, 
</p>
<p>the model shows that bias by members of 
</p>
<p>one group (e.g., psychology students) 
</p>
<p>toward members of another group (e.g., 
</p>
<p>physics students) can be decreased by 
</p>
<p>making a common identity salient (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&uuml;bingen university students&rdquo;). Thus, by 
</p>
<p>expanding the inclusiveness of the in-group 
</p>
<p>by means of a higher level of social catego-
</p>
<p>rization, in-group bias can be decreased. 
</p>
<p>Recent work has shown that creating a com-
</p>
<p>mon in-group identity is particularly effec-
</p>
<p>tive in reducing bias when it is combined 
</p>
<p>with simultaneously stressing the ties with 
</p>
<p>the subgroup and the overarching common 
</p>
<p>identity (e.g., &ldquo;T&uuml;bingen psychology stu-
</p>
<p>dents&rdquo;). Such &ldquo;dual identities&rdquo; work partic-
</p>
<p>ularly well because they secure subgroup 
</p>
<p>distinctiveness while at the same time creat-
</p>
<p>ing common ground with the out-group 
</p>
<p>(Dovidio, Gaertner, &amp; Saguy, 2007).

</p>
<p>seem more or less individualistic in nature. 
</p>
<p>However, social identity theory is truly a social 
</p>
<p>psychological theory, because, according to the 
</p>
<p>theory, the social context (partly) determines 
</p>
<p>which part of (social) identity is salient at a given 
</p>
<p>moment. For example, your identity as member 
</p>
<p>of a sports team is more likely to be salient during 
</p>
<p>a close game against a rival team, while your 
</p>
<p>personal identity is more likely to be salient 
</p>
<p>when socializing with your teammates after the 
</p>
<p>game (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). Thus, the social 
</p>
<p>context is key to SIT in explaining which part of 
</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s (social) identity becomes salient at a given 
</p>
<p>moment.
</p>
<p> When a&nbsp;Social Identity Is Negative
</p>
<p>The social character of the theory is also echoed 
</p>
<p>in the second part of social identity theory, the 
</p>
<p>social-structural part. This part basically deals 
</p>
<p>with the issue of how people respond to having a 
</p>
<p>negative social identity.
</p>
<p>One aspect in which minimal groups are mini-
</p>
<p>mal is that they are neutral in terms of their 
</p>
<p>valence. Natural groups, by contrast, do typically 
</p>
<p>have evaluative connotations. That is, some 
</p>
<p>groups are generally respected and enjoy a high 
</p>
<p>social status (e.g., physicians), whereas other 
</p>
<p>groups have low status, sometimes even to the 
</p>
<p>extent that they can be regarded &ldquo;stigmatized 
</p>
<p>groups&rdquo; (e.g., the unemployed). Because SIT pre-
</p>
<p>dicts that people are generally motivated to 
</p>
<p>achieve a positive social identity, members of low 
</p>
<p>status groups should be motivated to improve the 
</p>
<p>social standing of their group. By contrast, members 
</p>
<p>of high status groups should be particularly 
</p>
<p>motivated to protect the social standing of their 
</p>
<p>group (Scheepers, 2009; Turner &amp; Brown, 1978).
</p>
<p>For example, imagine that you are a player in 
</p>
<p>a hockey team that, for the third year in a row, 
</p>
<p>finds itself at the bottom of the league. How 
</p>
<p>would you feel, and what would you do? The 
</p>
<p>group&rsquo;s bad performance likely has a negative 
</p>
<p>impact on the team members&rsquo; social identity. 
</p>
<p>How can they cope with this threat? Social 
</p>
<p>identity theory describes three options. The first 
</p>
<p>one, individual mobility, involves trying as an 
</p>
<p>individual to seek entrance to a higher status 
</p>
<p>group like another hockey team, or even club. 
</p>
<p>The second option, collective action, involves 
</p>
<p>working as a group for status improvement. Your 
</p>
<p>team may engage in team-building activities to 
</p>
<p>increase cohesion, or schedule more training 
</p>
<p>sessions. As a result, the team may be able to do 
</p>
<p>better and increase its status in the next season. 
</p>
<p>The third option is to be socially creative and to 
</p>
<p>change the comparison group (&ldquo;although we 
</p>
<p>ended at the bottom of the second league, we are 
</p>
<p>definitively better than those in the third league&rdquo;) 
</p>
<p>or the dimension of comparison (&ldquo;although we 
</p>
<p>are not brilliant at hockey, we are definitively the 
</p>
<p>most fun team in the league, and hey, in the end, 
</p>
<p>what is amateur sports all about?&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>In addition to the distinction between the dif-
</p>
<p>ferent ways to cope with a negative social iden-
</p>
<p>tity, SIT also specifies the factors determining 
</p>
<p>which strategy is likely to be used. Classic SIT 
</p>
<p>describes three socio-structural variables that 
</p>
<p>determine which coping response is chosen: the 
</p>
<p>permeability of group differences (is moving to 
</p>
<p>another group possible?) and the legitimacy and 
</p>
<p>stability of the status differences (are the status 
</p>
<p>differences fair, and is change possible?; 
</p>
<p>Ellemers, 1993; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979).
</p>
<p>When do people engage in collective action, 
</p>
<p>and when do they engage in individual mobility? 
</p>
<p>(see Fig.&nbsp;9.2). For individual mobility to be pos-
</p>
<p>sible in the first place, the group must be perme-
</p>
<p>able, which is the case for sports teams but less so 
</p>
<p>for social categories like gender and ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>When boundaries are closed, the stability and 
</p>
<p>legitimacy of the status differences play an 
</p>
<p>important role in whether one opts for collective

</p>
<p>action or social creativity. When status differences 
</p>
<p>are illegitimate (&ldquo;the referees have been consis-
</p>
<p>tently biased against our team&rdquo;) and unstable 
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;we attracted a couple of good young players&rdquo;), 
</p>
<p>collective action will become more likely; when 
</p>
<p>low status is legitimate and stable, however, social 
</p>
<p>creativity becomes more likely (&ldquo;we are the more 
</p>
<p>fun team&rdquo;). Thus, social identity threat is an 
</p>
<p>important motivational principle determining, for 
</p>
<p>example, whether one flees from the group indi-
</p>
<p>vidually or fights the status quo as a group 
</p>
<p>(Ellemers, 1993; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979).
</p>
<p>This concludes our description of the basic 
</p>
<p>principles of social identity theory. In the next sec-
</p>
<p>tions, we describe two important domains of appli-
</p>
<p>cation of the theory: health and organizations.
</p>
<p> Applications to&nbsp;Health
</p>
<p>Social identification has important implications 
</p>
<p>for (improving) mental and physical health 
</p>
<p>(Haslam, Jetten, Postmes, &amp; Haslam, 2009). 
</p>
<p>In this section we briefly describe two ways in 
</p>
<p>which social identity shapes health outcomes: 
</p>
<p>the influence of group identification on health 
</p>
<p>behavior and the influence of group identifica-
</p>
<p>tion on stress reduction.
</p>
<p>Members of the lower social classes or ethnic 
</p>
<p>minority groups suffer from more negative health 
</p>
<p>outcomes compared to members of the middle- 
</p>
<p>class or ethnic majority groups (e.g., Braveman, 
</p>
<p>Egerter, &amp; Williams, 2011). Part of this relation-
</p>
<p>ship is explained by social identification. For 
</p>
<p>example, research has indicated that members of 
</p>
<p>racial minority groups in the USA were particu-
</p>
<p>larly likely to associate health behaviors like 
</p>
<p>exercising, eating healthy, and getting enough 
</p>
<p>sleep, with the white middle class. As a tragic con-
</p>
<p>sequence of this, after making their ethnic identity 
</p>
<p>salient, ethnic minority group members showed a 
</p>
<p>greater &ldquo;health fatalism,&rdquo; i.e., a belief that it will 
</p>
<p>be of no use to engage in a more healthy lifestyle 
</p>
<p>(Oyserman, Fryberg, &amp; Yoder, 2007).
</p>
<p>Social identity can also be used to stimulate 
</p>
<p>positive health behaviors, however. A study on 
</p>
<p>anti-smoking advertisements demonstrated that 
</p>
<p>their effectiveness partly depends on the extent to 
</p>
<p>which a message is framed in terms of the target&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>social identity (Moran &amp; Sussman, 2014). 
</p>
<p>Participants in this online questionnaire study 
</p>
<p>were adolescents, who first indicated on scales 
</p>
<p>how much they identified with 11 possible peer 
</p>
<p>groups (e.g., &ldquo;emo,&rdquo; &ldquo;hip-hop-er,&rdquo; &ldquo;skater&rdquo;). In 
</p>
<p>turn they viewed an advert that displayed two 
</p>
<p>anti-smoking beliefs (e.g., &ldquo;Tobacco company 
</p>
<p>executives have called younger adult smokers 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;replacement smokers&rsquo;&rdquo;). A graphic designer had 
</p>
<p>created 11 different versions of the adverts to fit 
</p>
<p>each of the peer groups. Specifically, next to the

</p>
<p>statement, two persons (an adolescent boy and 
</p>
<p>girl) were displayed who had the prototypical 
</p>
<p>features of a particular peer group (e.g., two typi-
</p>
<p>cal skaters). Then, one week later the participants 
</p>
<p>indicated their agreement with the two anti-
</p>
<p>smoking belief statements. Results indicated that 
</p>
<p>a stronger identification with a certain peer group 
</p>
<p>led to more endorsement with the statements. 
</p>
<p>Thus, &ldquo;customizing&rdquo; a health message to fit a tar-
</p>
<p>get&rsquo;s social identity increases the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>the message.
</p>
<p>A second way in which social identification 
</p>
<p>influences health outcomes is through its stress- 
</p>
<p>attenuating function. For example, Haslam, 
</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Brien, Jetten, Vormedal, and Penna (2005) 
</p>
<p>examined stress in Norwegian heart patients who 
</p>
<p>were recovering from heart surgery in a clinic. 
</p>
<p>Participants filled in a questionnaire measuring 
</p>
<p>their identification with family and friends (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I identify with my family/friends&rdquo;), received 
</p>
<p>social support (e.g., &ldquo;Do you feel you get the 
</p>
<p>emotional support you need&rdquo;?), and stress (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you stressed?&rdquo;). Results indicated that iden-
</p>
<p>tification with family and friends was inversely 
</p>
<p>related to stress. Importantly, social identification 
</p>
<p>was positively related to social support, and the 
</p>
<p>negative relation between identification and 
</p>
<p>stress was mediated by social support.
</p>
<p>Identification may also have a positive effect 
</p>
<p>on well-being when the group itself forms the 
</p>
<p>basis of stress. According to the rejection identi-
</p>
<p>fication model (Branscombe, Schmitt, &amp; Harvey, 
</p>
<p>1999), group-based rejection initially threatens 
</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s self-esteem, but through a strengthened 
</p>
<p>identification with the group, the person can in 
</p>
<p>turn cope with the stress, eventually leading to 
</p>
<p>restored self-esteem. In line with the model, 
</p>
<p>Branscombe and colleagues showed that when 
</p>
<p>Black Americans thought about discrimination 
</p>
<p>against their racial group, this initially led to 
</p>
<p>depressed self-esteem. However, this social iden-
</p>
<p>tity threat led in turn to a strengthened ethnic 
</p>
<p>identification, which then led to higher self-
</p>
<p>esteem (see Schmitt, Branscombe, Kobrynowicz, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Owen, 2002, for similar effects regarding gen-
</p>
<p>der groups).
</p>
<p>Thus, the above research suggests that a social 
</p>
<p>identity perspective is not only useful for making 
</p>
<p>health campaigns more effective but also for 
</p>
<p>designing interventions to reduce stress. An obvi-
</p>
<p>ous context for applying these insights is the work 
</p>
<p>context, where people may experience consider-
</p>
<p>able amounts of stress. Indeed, the work by 
</p>
<p>Haslam et&nbsp;al. (2005) suggests that by raising sup-
</p>
<p>port and social identification, teams can become 
</p>
<p>more resilient against stress. In addition to such 
</p>
<p>interventions for work stress, the social identity 
</p>
<p>perspective has offered considerable insights in 
</p>
<p>other themes in organizational psychology. These 
</p>
<p>themes are discussed in the next section.
</p>
<p> Applications to&nbsp;Organizational 
Psychology
</p>
<p>Most people spend a large part of their time interact-
</p>
<p>ing with each other in groups, when they are at work 
</p>
<p>in organizations. Accordingly, it has been argued 
</p>
<p>that the insights offered by social identity theory can 
</p>
<p>help understand the thoughts, feelings, and behav-
</p>
<p>iors of individuals working in teams and organiza-
</p>
<p>tions (e.g., Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1989; Haslam &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ellemers, 2005; Haslam, Van Knippenberg, Platow, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Ellemers, 2003; Hogg &amp; Terry, 2000). In this 
</p>
<p>section, we demonstrate the added value of consid-
</p>
<p>ering employees in terms of their group-based 
</p>
<p>identities&nbsp; &ndash; instead of treating them as separate 
</p>
<p>individuals&nbsp;&ndash; in addressing a number of problems 
</p>
<p>faced by many work organizations.

</p>
<p>The added value of applying insights from 
</p>
<p>social identity theory has been demonstrated for 
</p>
<p>a range of common challenges faced by organiza-
</p>
<p>tions (see Table&nbsp;9.2), for which we will give some 
</p>
<p>examples below. These relate to:
</p>
<p> (a) Cognitive categorization of the self as a 
</p>
<p>member of the organization (How can lead-
</p>
<p>ership connect individual employees to work 
</p>
<p>toward common goals? When will differen-
</p>
<p>tiation in employee rewards enhance indi-
</p>
<p>vidual ambitions or invite protest?)
</p>
<p> (b) Evaluative judgments of the organization 
</p>
<p>(Which organizational features are important 
</p>
<p>to recruit and retain employees? Which help 
</p>
<p>secure customer loyalty?)
</p>
<p> (c) Emotional commitment to the organization 
</p>
<p>(How to motivate workers to go the extra 
</p>
<p>mile? How to create a sense of belonging 
</p>
<p>when employees only communicate online?)
</p>
<p> (d) Identity change (How to accommodate minor-
</p>
<p>ity employees? How to secure cooperation 
</p>
<p>through an organizational merger?)
</p>
<p> Leaders Can Define a&nbsp;Shared 
Identity
</p>
<p>Many companies use performance evaluations 
</p>
<p>and incentives that compare workers against each 
</p>
<p>other, for instance, to determine who receives a 
</p>
<p>bonus or qualifies for promotion. This is generally 
</p>
<p>seen as a legitimate and effective system to 
</p>
<p>motivate employees to work hard. However, the 
</p>
<p>downside of such practices is that they foster 
</p>
<p>competition between individuals and emphasize 
</p>
<p>their personal identity, inviting people to think of 
</p>
<p>themselves as individual workers, instead of as 
</p>
<p>parts of a larger team or organization. If you work 
</p>
<p>in a call center, for instance, where employee 
</p>
<p>performance is rated by the speed at which you 
</p>
<p>are able to take new calls, would you invest in 
</p>
<p>providing the best possible service to each caller, 
</p>
<p>so that they are satisfied and perhaps purchase 
</p>
<p>additional services from the organization, or 
</p>
<p>would you focus on completing each call as 
</p>
<p>quickly as you can?
</p>
<p>An important challenge for leadership in cases 
</p>
<p>such as this is to help individual employees build 
</p>
<p>and retain a sense of identification with the team 
</p>
<p>or organization. This can enhance their willing-
</p>
<p>ness to work toward shared goals&nbsp;&ndash; such as main-
</p>
<p>taining long-term relations with satisfied 
</p>
<p>customers (Ellemers, De Gilder, &amp; Haslam, 
</p>
<p>2004). Indeed, employees are more inclined to 
</p>
<p>follow the guidance of leaders if they clearly sup-
</p>
<p>port the preferences of their own team members 
</p>
<p>(e.g., making sure they have enough information 
</p>
<p>to provide satisfactory answers to questions 
</p>
<p>they receive) and protect them against claims of 
</p>
<p>other teams or organizational members (e.g., that 
</p>
<p>the people at the call center work too slowly).

</p>
<p>Leaders who are able to do this well allow workers 
</p>
<p>to self-categorize at the group level instead of the 
</p>
<p>individual level (Haslam &amp; Platow, 2001).
</p>
<p>This also implies that those with formal posi-
</p>
<p>tions of power are not necessarily the ones who 
</p>
<p>are most influential in guiding the organization 
</p>
<p>and its members. The possibility they have to 
</p>
<p>decide about business strategies, enforce 
</p>
<p>requests, or afford resources gives them control 
</p>
<p>over the outcomes of employees. However, it is 
</p>
<p>the ability of leaders to connect, engage, and 
</p>
<p>inspire others that causes employees to follow 
</p>
<p>their guidance. More often than not, this is 
</p>
<p>enhanced by their willingness to acknowledge 
</p>
<p>and transform important concerns of individual 
</p>
<p>employees (e.g., their frustration of having to 
</p>
<p>mind the time when answering customer 
</p>
<p>requests) and to define how shared team or orga-
</p>
<p>nizational goals contribute to fulfilling the goals 
</p>
<p>and ambitions of individual workers (see also 
</p>
<p>Haslam et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p> What Makes for&nbsp;an&nbsp;Attractive 
Workplace?
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many organizations have a limited 
</p>
<p>view on what determines the value people attach to 
</p>
<p>their place of work. Human resources and recruit-
</p>
<p>ing officers tend to emphasize material gains, such 
</p>
<p>as personal career opportunities, compensation 
</p>
<p>packages, or other employee benefits when recruit-
</p>
<p>ing new employees. However, different studies 
</p>
<p>have found that these are not the only things that 
</p>
<p>matter. Instead, the main thing people want to know 
</p>
<p>before they apply for a job is whether this can make 
</p>
<p>them proud of their organizational identity. 
</p>
<p>Organizations with high prestige reflect positively 
</p>
<p>on the self-conceptions of employees and enhance 
</p>
<p>their identification with the organization (Smidts, 
</p>
<p>Pruyn, &amp; van Riel, 2001).
</p>
<p>Organizational prestige and feelings of pride 
</p>
<p>in belonging to the organization do not necessar-
</p>
<p>ily depend on its financial successes or business 
</p>
<p>reputation. Instead, those who consider working 
</p>
<p>for the organization mainly have an interest in 
</p>
<p>knowing whether the organization supports 
</p>
<p>important values. For instance, it has been estab-
</p>
<p>lished that workers are more satisfied and com-
</p>
<p>mitted to the organization when they perceive 
</p>
<p>organizational management to be truthful in 
</p>
<p>communicating with employees and stakeholders 
</p>
<p>and to engage in socially responsible business 
</p>
<p>practices (Ellemers, Kingma, Van der Burgt &amp; 
</p>
<p>Barreto, 2011; Van Prooijen &amp; Ellemers, 2015). 
</p>
<p>As a result, even individuals who work in sectors 
</p>
<p>that are often seen as having low prestige (such as 
</p>
<p>garbage collectors, undertakers, or sex workers) 
</p>
<p>can take pride in their profession and identify 
</p>
<p>with the organization that employs them, by 
</p>
<p>focusing on important societal functions they ful-
</p>
<p>fill, for instance, by averting public health threats, 
</p>
<p>or by offering emotional support to lonely people 
</p>
<p>(Ashforth &amp; Kreiner, 1999).
</p>
<p>Box 9.4 Zooming In: The Costs of 
</p>
<p>Competing Against Each Other
</p>
<p>Organizations where workers are encour-
</p>
<p>aged to compete with each other for cus-
</p>
<p>tomers and resources hope to optimize the 
</p>
<p>profits and efficiency of the company in this 
</p>
<p>way (Victor &amp; Cullen, 1988). Studies with 
</p>
<p>many different professional groups and 
</p>
<p>companies across the world have revealed 
</p>
<p>the drawbacks of this motivational strategy, 
</p>
<p>which is typically associated with reduced 
</p>
<p>work satisfaction and organizational com-
</p>
<p>mitment among workers. Further, reward-
</p>
<p>ing workers for the individual performance 
</p>
<p>they show, without taking into account how 
</p>
<p>they achieved this performance, has been 
</p>
<p>found to elicit a range of unethical work 
</p>
<p>behaviors. These include lying, stealing, 
</p>
<p>misreporting results, falsifying reports, 
</p>
<p>accepting bribes, and bullying in the

</p>
<p> Going the&nbsp;Extra Mile
</p>
<p>The importance of a common social identity for 
</p>
<p>motivation and performance at work has been 
</p>
<p>demonstrated in many studies. Again, selfish 
</p>
<p>concerns, such as the fact that workers depend on 
</p>
<p>each other to achieve valued outcomes, appear 
</p>
<p>less important than a sense of emotional involve-
</p>
<p>ment and subjective feelings of commitment to 
</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s team and the organization (see also Butera &amp; 
</p>
<p>Buchs, Chap. 8 this volume). This was observed, 
</p>
<p>for instance, among Dutch soldiers on a UN 
</p>
<p>peacekeeping mission. Here it was found that the 
</p>
<p>more soldiers in military teams felt that they were 
</p>
<p>respected and included, the more likely it was 
</p>
<p>that their commanders considered the team ready 
</p>
<p>for combat (Ellemers, Sleebos, Stam, &amp; De 
</p>
<p>Gilder, 2013). The power of noninstrumental fac-
</p>
<p>tors in connecting and motivating people at work 
</p>
<p>is further demonstrated in studies among volun-
</p>
<p>teers. Their sense of identification and commit-
</p>
<p>ment to the volunteer organization and its mission 
</p>
<p>motivates them to work even without pay (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Boezeman &amp; Ellemers, 2008). This also means 
</p>
<p>that it can be very costly for organizations to pre-
</p>
<p>vent employees from developing such a sense of 
</p>
<p>emotional involvement, for instance, by failing to 
</p>
<p>acknowledge and include them as valued members 
</p>
<p>of the organization. This can happen in sectors 
</p>
<p>where it is common practice to offer flexible, 
</p>
<p>part-time, or limited duration work contracts only 
</p>
<p>(see also Ho, 2009). Even if this may seem a 
</p>
<p>good way to optimize employment efficiency, 
</p>
<p>such organizations cannot expect workers to 
</p>
<p>develop a sense of common identity or to &ldquo;go the 
</p>
<p>extra mile&rdquo; to achieve outcomes that are impor-
</p>
<p>tant for the organization. Surely you would not 
</p>
<p>be willing to work overtime to meet a deadline or 
</p>
<p>help instruct new co-workers, after having been 
</p>
<p>told your contract is not extended because some-
</p>
<p>one with your level of experience is considered 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;too expensive&rdquo; to retain.
</p>
<p> Managing Diversity
</p>
<p>Even in organizations that are aware of the impor-
</p>
<p>tance of connecting people and encouraging them 
</p>
<p>to develop a shared identity, there may be addi-
</p>
<p>tional difficulties to overcome. An important 
</p>
<p>challenge in this sense is offered by changing 
</p>
<p>management literature, this is often defined 
</p>
<p>and measured differently than in social 
</p>
<p>identity theory. Importantly, management 
</p>
<p>studies often separate cognitive self-catego-
</p>
<p>rization (which they consider to capture the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;organizational identity&rdquo; of employees) 
</p>
<p>from emotional involvement with the orga-
</p>
<p>nization (which they indicate as &ldquo;organiza-
</p>
<p>tional commitment&rdquo;) and conclude that 
</p>
<p>identity is less relevant than commitment to 
</p>
<p>predict behavior in organizations. This is 
</p>
<p>different from the notion of the &ldquo;group-
</p>
<p>based- self&rdquo; in social identity theory, which 
</p>
<p>incorporates self-categorization as well as 
</p>
<p>commitment as essential components of a 
</p>
<p>social identity
</p>
<p>Box 9.5 Zooming In: The Dangers of 
</p>
<p>Overcommitment
</p>
<p>In itself, a strong team or organizational 
</p>
<p>identity is no guarantee for an optimal per-
</p>
<p>formance at work (see also Ellemers et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2004). In fact, a strong shared identity may 
</p>
<p>tempt workers to cover up each other&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>mistakes or encourage each other to take it 
</p>
<p>easy. At the other end of the spectrum, peo-
</p>
<p>ple who overcommit to their work identity 
</p>
<p>may be quite productive for a while but are 
</p>
<p>unlikely to be able to keep this up indefi-
</p>
<p>nitely. In the long run, the social and per-
</p>
<p>sonal sacrifices people make when they 
</p>
<p>focus on their work identity alone can pre-
</p>
<p>vent them from investing in other impor-
</p>
<p>tant identities, for instance, relating to 
</p>
<p>family, friends, sports, or cultural activities 
</p>
<p>(Faniko, Ellemers, Derks, &amp; Lorenzi-
</p>
<p>Cioldi, 2017).

</p>
<p>workplace realities, which are characterized by 
</p>
<p>increasing diversity among workers. Being able 
</p>
<p>to recruit the inputs from people with different 
</p>
<p>cultural backgrounds, types of training, or life 
</p>
<p>experiences can be a valuable asset to many com-
</p>
<p>panies. However, if not managed well, such dif-
</p>
<p>ferences in the type of knowledge and experience 
</p>
<p>people bring to work, as well as more immedi-
</p>
<p>ately visible differences in their gender or skin 
</p>
<p>color, can easily become a source of misunder-
</p>
<p>standing and divisiveness. These features that 
</p>
<p>separate workers or cut across common team or 
</p>
<p>organizational memberships can induce (implicit) 
</p>
<p>discrimination and make those who differ from 
</p>
<p>the majority feel excluded (for a discussion of 
</p>
<p>implicit prejudice and discrimination, see 
</p>
<p>Wittenbrink, Correll, &amp; Ma, Chap. 11 this vol-
</p>
<p>ume). The challenge for leadership is to make 
</p>
<p>sure that such alternative identities are acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged and recruited into a common overarching 
</p>
<p>identity. This can be achieved, for instance, by 
</p>
<p>clarifying how such differences can form a 
</p>
<p>resource for greater flexibility and creativity 
</p>
<p>(e.g., &ldquo;we need workers who know how to digi-
</p>
<p>talize our services&rdquo;) or allow the organization to 
</p>
<p>connect to a broader population of clients (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;we need workers who know how to communi-
</p>
<p>cate with non-native speakers&rdquo;; Ellemers &amp; Rink, 
</p>
<p>2016). Thus, attempts to build a common organi-
</p>
<p>zational identity should not ignore such differ-
</p>
<p>ences. Instead identity-building initiatives do 
</p>
<p>well to emphasize and enhance the different types 
</p>
<p>of contribution workers can make to the organi-
</p>
<p>zation and what it stands for, instead of letting 
</p>
<p>such differences become a source of disagree-
</p>
<p>ment and conflict.
</p>
<p>In sum, there is considerable evidence that 
</p>
<p>social identities are important in organizational 
</p>
<p>contexts. At the same time, strengthening a 
</p>
<p>common identity, for instance, through &ldquo;team- 
</p>
<p>building&rdquo; activities, is no easy or foolproof solu-
</p>
<p>tion to make workers feel connected and perform 
</p>
<p>well. To be able to build and benefit from the 
</p>
<p>willingness of individuals to identify with their 
</p>
<p>place of work, organizational leaders do well to 
</p>
<p>reconsider standard business practices that can 
</p>
<p>undermine shared goals and common identities. 
</p>
<p>Making people feel respected and included as 
</p>
<p>valued organizational members&nbsp; &ndash; regardless of 
</p>
<p>their differences&nbsp;&ndash; making sure that organization 
</p>
<p>and its activities can make workers proud, and 
</p>
<p>taking care not to be too greedy in requesting that 
</p>
<p>workers sacrifice other identities to fit in, all are 
</p>
<p>important challenges that need to be met to be 
</p>
<p>able to connect workers into a happy, healthy, and 
</p>
<p>productive organization.
</p>
<p> Intervening to&nbsp;Improve Intergroup 
Contact and&nbsp;Collaboration
</p>
<p>An important theme within social identity 
</p>
<p>research is how SIT principles can be used to 
</p>
<p>improve intergroup relations in a variety of con-
</p>
<p>texts. One of the most influential ideas in this 
</p>
<p>context is that creating a common in-group iden-
</p>
<p>tity that comprises both in-group and out- group 
</p>
<p>reduces bias toward (former) out-group members 
</p>
<p>(Dovidio et&nbsp;al., 2007; Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000; 
</p>
<p>see Box 9.2). For example, this idea has been 
</p>
<p>used to understand corporate mergers, where a 
</p>
<p>common challenge is often to unify companies 
</p>
<p>that were previously competing against each 
</p>
<p>other, and might have different identities, cul-
</p>
<p>tures, and statuses. Understanding the social 
</p>
<p>identity dynamics of such mergers is key for 
</p>
<p>making the merger a success (Terry et&nbsp;al., 2001). 
</p>
<p>Another context where SIT principles have been 
</p>
<p>used to stimulate intergroup helping and cooper-
</p>
<p>ation is the educational context. We conclude this 
</p>
<p>chapter by describing a social identity interven-
</p>
<p>tion to improve intergroup relations at schools 
</p>
<p>and universities.
</p>
<p>One challenge that many schools and universi-
</p>
<p>ties currently face is the increasing diversity in 
</p>
<p>their student populations. This diversity can take 
</p>
<p>different forms, for example, increasing numbers 
</p>
<p>of students with a migration background or 
</p>
<p>increasing gender diversity in areas that were 
</p>
<p>traditionally male-dominated (e.g., math). How 
</p>
<p>can you stimulate a positive school climate and 
</p>
<p>collaboration in such contexts?
</p>
<p>Vezzali et&nbsp; al. (2015) tested a common in-
</p>
<p>group identity intervention in two educational 
</p>
<p>settings: an elementary school setting (Study 1) 
</p>
<p>and a university setting (Study 2). Participants in 
</p>
<p>9 Social Identity Theory</p>
<p/>

<p>140
</p>
<p>the first study were native-Italian elementary 
</p>
<p>school children. Within different classes partici-
</p>
<p>pants were randomly assigned to one of three 
</p>
<p>conditions. In the &ldquo;common in-group condition,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>participants imagined working together with an 
</p>
<p>immigrant child on a competitive task against 
</p>
<p>another dyad. This condition was compared to 
</p>
<p>two (control) conditions: In the &ldquo;imagined 
</p>
<p>contact condition,&rdquo; participants had to simply 
</p>
<p>imagine contact with an immigrant child, without 
</p>
<p>working together; In the &ldquo;control condition,&rdquo; the 
</p>
<p>instructions were as in the common in-group 
</p>
<p>identity condition, but the migration background 
</p>
<p>of the interaction partner was not mentioned. 
</p>
<p>Participants engaged in the imagining task once a 
</p>
<p>week over a 4-week period. The context that par-
</p>
<p>ticipants had to imagine differed from week to 
</p>
<p>week (e.g., sports, theater play). Each time, par-
</p>
<p>ticipants were instructed to close their eyes and 
</p>
<p>take a third-person perspective while imagining 
</p>
<p>the situation. One week after the final intervention 
</p>
<p>task, intergroup helping intentions were measured 
</p>
<p>using a questionnaire (e.g., &ldquo;Think about an 
</p>
<p>immigrant child who may have problems with 
</p>
<p>writing an essay. Would you help him/her?&rdquo;). 
</p>
<p>Then, again 1 week after this assessment, the 
</p>
<p>experimenter met individually with each of the 
</p>
<p>participants and further interviewed him/her 
</p>
<p>about helping intentions. More specifically, the 
</p>
<p>participant was informed that a new pupil with an 
</p>
<p>immigrant background would arrive soon at their 
</p>
<p>school, and the participant was asked whether (s)
</p>
<p>he would be willing to help the new child with 
</p>
<p>integrating at school. Participants were asked 
</p>
<p>about the number of afternoons (between 0 and 4) 
</p>
<p>they would be willing to help out their new 
</p>
<p>classmate.
</p>
<p>Results on both helping measures indicated that 
</p>
<p>participants in the common in-group identity condi-
</p>
<p>tion were more likely to help an immigrant class-
</p>
<p>mate than participants in the control condition. 
</p>
<p>Helping intentions in the imagined contact condi-
</p>
<p>tion fell in between the common in-group condition 
</p>
<p>and the control condition (for a discussion of imag-
</p>
<p>ined contact as a way to ameliorate intergroup rela-
</p>
<p>tions, see Christ &amp; Kauff, Chap. 10).
</p>
<p>These results were replicated in a second 
</p>
<p>study in a university context. This study used 
</p>
<p>basically the same setup as the school study but 
</p>
<p>also comprised a questionnaire measuring 
</p>
<p>common in-group identity (e.g., &ldquo;Do you perceive 
</p>
<p>Italians and immigrants as members of a common 
</p>
<p>group [residents of Italy]?&rdquo;). Results indicated, 
</p>
<p>as would be expected, that the common in-group 
</p>
<p>identity measure indeed mediated the positive 
</p>
<p>effects of the common in-group identity 
</p>
<p>intervention on the willingness to engage in 
</p>
<p>future intergroup contact.
</p>
<p>Together these two studies illustrate the fruit-
</p>
<p>fulness of a common identity intervention to 
</p>
<p>improve intergroup contact and cooperation in an 
</p>
<p>educational setting. It should be noted that 
</p>
<p>although the intervention itself was relatively 
</p>
<p>simple to implement, its effects were sustainable 
</p>
<p>in that it predicted out-group helping 2 weeks 
</p>
<p>later.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Human beings are advanced social ani-
</p>
<p>mals: People not only form groups; 
</p>
<p>groups also form people. People derive 
</p>
<p>part of their identity from the groups to 
</p>
<p>which they belong, which is called their 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;social identity.&rdquo; Social identity theory 
</p>
<p>describes how&nbsp;&ndash; through social categori-
</p>
<p>zation and comparison&nbsp; &ndash; people define 
</p>
<p>their social identity and how they strive 
</p>
<p>for a positive social identity. The need for 
</p>
<p>a positive and meaningful social identity 
</p>
<p>is served by positive group distinctiveness 
</p>
<p>which contributes to feelings of certainty 
</p>
<p>and positive self-esteem.
</p>
<p>&bull; A negative social identity, for example, 
</p>
<p>stemming from membership in a group 
</p>
<p>with a relatively low status, is threaten-
</p>
<p>ing. People cope with a negative social 
</p>
<p>identity in various ways, like trying to 
</p>
<p>improve the status of the group or seek-
</p>
<p>ing entrance in a higher status group.
</p>
<p>&bull; Social identity has important implica-
</p>
<p>tions for health psychology, for example, 
</p>
<p>for customizing health interventions. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, group identification can

<p> Guiding Answers to&nbsp;Questions 
in&nbsp;This Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Q (Box 9.1): Your Money or Your Identity?
</p>
<p>A: Migrants can be seen as threat to the mate-
</p>
<p>rial resources of the host society, like housing, 
</p>
<p>healthcare, and the sustainability of social 
</p>
<p>security programs. By bringing their cultural 
</p>
<p>habits and religion, migrants are often also 
</p>
<p>seen as a threat to the identity and culture of 
</p>
<p>the host society. The European integration can 
</p>
<p>be seen as a threat to the material resources of 
</p>
<p>the inhabitants of certain rich countries, when 
</p>
<p>they feel having to compensate countries with 
</p>
<p>less well-functioning economies. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>by seemingly blending the unique cultural 
</p>
<p>features of member states, the European 
</p>
<p>Union is also often seen as a threat to national 
</p>
<p>identities.
</p>
<p> 2. Q (Box 9.3): What Do You Identify with at 
</p>
<p>Work?
</p>
<p>A: People can focus on different aspects of 
</p>
<p>their work as providing them with a source of 
</p>
<p>identification and commitment. Many aca-
</p>
<p>demics, for instance, primarily identify with 
</p>
<p>their academic discipline or profession (being 
</p>
<p>a physicist, being a historian) and may attach 
</p>
<p>less value to the university or academic insti-
</p>
<p>tution that employs them. Workers in large 
</p>
<p>corporations may identify with their career 
</p>
<p>development goals (being a management 
</p>
<p>trainee), with their work team (IT depart-
</p>
<p>ment), or with the organization (K-Mart). 
</p>
<p>What people adopt as the primary focus for 
</p>
<p>their professional identity is guided also by 
</p>
<p>the way the organization treats them, the 
</p>
<p>development opportunities, and career pros-
</p>
<p>pects they receive. For instance, an organiza-
</p>
<p>tion that only offers flexible or temporary 
</p>
<p>contracts will have more difficulty having its 
</p>
<p>workers develop a sense of identification with 
</p>
<p>the organization. Likewise, leadership com-
</p>
<p>munications and incentive programs can lead 
</p>
<p>workers to categorize themselves differently, 
</p>
<p>for instance, as part of a group of experts, 
</p>
<p>work team, or organization.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>It has sometimes been held that merely by assem-
</p>
<p>bling people without regard for race, color, religion, 
</p>
<p>or national origin, we can thereby destroy stereo-
</p>
<p>types and develop friendly attitudes. The case is not 
</p>
<p>so simple. (Allport 1954, p.&nbsp;261)
</p>
<p>The question of how prejudice and intergroup 
</p>
<p>conflict can be reduced has been at the forefront 
</p>
<p>of the research agendas in social sciences for 
</p>
<p>many years (see Paluck &amp; Green, 2009; Tropp &amp; 
</p>
<p>Mallett, 2011; see also Wittenbrink, Correll, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ma, Chap. 11). Not least due to the ever- 
</p>
<p>increasing migration, and as a consequence more 
</p>
<p>ethnically and culturally diverse societies (World 
</p>
<p>Migration Report, 2017), the reduction of (eth-
</p>
<p>nic) prejudice and intergroup conflict is a major 
</p>
<p>challenge for public policy (Hewstone, 2009; 
</p>
<p>Wagner, Christ, &amp; Heitmeyer, 2010). Starting in 
</p>
<p>the 1930s, social scientists proposed that inter-
</p>
<p>group contact&nbsp; &ndash; contact between members of 
</p>
<p>different groups&nbsp;&ndash; provides a way to overcome 
</p>
<p>intergroup tensions and conflict (for recent over-
</p>
<p>views, see Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011; Al Ramiah 
</p>
<p>&amp; Hewstone, 2013; Wagner &amp; Hewstone, 2012; 
</p>
<p>for a short historical overview of intergroup con-
</p>
<p>tact research, see Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2005, 
</p>
<p>Pettigrew, 2016). However, mutual contact 
</p>
<p>between members of different groups is not a 
</p>
<p>panacea for prejudice as already pointed out by </p>

</p>
<p>Gordon Allport (1954, see the starting quote). 
</p>
<p>Allport can be considered as the originator of the 
</p>
<p>intergroup contact theory&nbsp; &ndash; in his famous and 
</p>
<p>influential book The Nature of Prejudice, he 
</p>
<p>summarized early research on intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact.
</p>
<p>The present chapter will introduce inter-
</p>
<p>group contact theory as one of the most promi-
</p>
<p>nent approaches to prejudice reduction within 
</p>
<p>psychology (e.g., Brown &amp; Hewstone, 2005; 
</p>
<p>Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011). In the first part, we 
</p>
<p>will answer the question whether intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact indeed helps to overcome prejudice 
</p>
<p>and, as a consequence, intergroup tensions. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, we will also focus on different forms 
</p>
<p>of intergroup contact (face-to-face contact ver-
</p>
<p>sus indirect forms of contact). In the second 
</p>
<p>part, we will discuss when and how intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact works. We also focus on undesirable, 
</p>
<p>unintended effects of intergroup contact. 
</p>
<p>Finally, we will summarize research demon-
</p>
<p>strating how intergroup contact theory can be 
</p>
<p>used to develop systematic interventions aim-
</p>
<p>ing to reduce prejudice and, as a consequence, 
</p>
<p>improve intergroup relations, ending the chap-
</p>
<p>ter with two examples of such interventions 
</p>
<p>that has been implemented in the context of 
</p>
<p>conflictual intergroup relations (i.e., in Israel 
</p>
<p>and Rwanda).
</p>
<p> Does Intergroup Contact Work?
</p>
<p>In 1954, Gordon Allport reviewed early work on 
</p>
<p>the effects of intergroup contact. As the starting 
</p>
<p>quote of this chapter indicates, Allport was well 
</p>
<p>aware that intergroup contact not always reduces 
</p>
<p>prejudice; on the contrary, it sometimes even 
</p>
<p>might strengthen stereotypical views of outgroups 
</p>
<p>and increases negative sentiments. He therefore 
</p>
<p>proposed in his famous formulation of the inter-
</p>
<p>group contact hypothesis that intergroup contact 
</p>
<p>only reduces prejudice in situations that meet four 
</p>
<p>optimal conditions: equal group status within the 
</p>
<p>contact situation, common goals, intergroup 
</p>
<p>cooperation (i.e., cooperation in working toward 
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Intergroup contact: Actual face-to-face 
</p>
<p>interaction between members of different 
</p>
<p>and clearly defined groups.
</p>
<p>Prejudice: An attitude toward a group and 
</p>
<p>its members that, like other attitudes, has a 
</p>
<p>cognitive component (e.g., beliefs about a 
</p>
<p>target group), an affective component (e.g., 
</p>
<p>dislike), and a conative component (e.g., a 
</p>
<p>behavioral predisposition to behave nega-
</p>
<p>tively toward the target group).
</p>
<p>Box 10.1 Zooming In: Measuring Intergroup 
</p>
<p>Contact and Prejudice
</p>
<p>Intergroup contact can be assessed with 
</p>
<p>questionnaire items measuring the quan-
</p>
<p>tity (e.g., &ldquo;How much contact do you have 
</p>
<p>with [outgroup] at your college?&rdquo;) and 
</p>
<p>quality of contact (e.g., &ldquo;To what extend 
</p>
<p>did you experience the contact with [out-
</p>
<p>group] as equal?&rdquo;) in different life domains 
</p>
<p>(Islam &amp; Hewstone, 1993; for a general 
</p>
<p>overview of contact measures, see Lolliot 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2014). Prejudice can be measured 
</p>
<p>with questionnaire items directly asking 
</p>
<p>for a rather general affective evaluation of 
</p>
<p>an outgroup (e.g., &ldquo;Please describe how 
</p>
<p>you feel about [outgroup] on a scale from 
</p>
<p>negative to positive.&rdquo;; Wright, Aron, 
</p>
<p>McLaughlin-Volpe, &amp; Ropp, 1997), items 
</p>
<p>asking for more specific aspects of a cogni-
</p>
<p>tive stereotype of the outgroup (e.g., &ldquo;How 
</p>
<p>competent are [outgroup]?&rdquo;; Fiske, Cuddy, 
</p>
<p>Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002), or items focusing on 
</p>
<p>behavioral intentions toward outgroups 
</p>
<p>(e.g., &ldquo;I would not be willing to have a sex-
</p>
<p>ual relationship with a [outgroup].&rdquo;; 
</p>
<p>Pettigrew &amp; Meertens, 1995).

</p>
<p>common goals), and the support of authorities, 
</p>
<p>law, or custom (for a more elaborated discussion 
</p>
<p>of these conditions, see Pettigrew, 1998).
</p>
<p>Allport&rsquo;s intergroup contact hypothesis 
</p>
<p>inspired a vast amount of research with a marked 
</p>
<p>increase in more recent years (Pettigrew, Tropp, 
</p>
<p>Wagner, &amp; Christ, 2011; Vezzali &amp; Stathi, 2017). 
</p>
<p>Based on their extensive meta-analytic synthesis 
</p>
<p>of intergroup contact research, Pettigrew and 
</p>
<p>Tropp (2006, p.&nbsp; 768) concluded that &ldquo;there is 
</p>
<p>little need to demonstrate further contact&rsquo;s gen-
</p>
<p>eral ability to lessen prejudice.&rdquo; Results of the 
</p>
<p>meta- analysis revealed a mean negative relation-
</p>
<p>ship of r&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;.21 between intergroup contact and 
</p>
<p>prejudice corresponding to a small to medium 
</p>
<p>effect size (Cohen, 1988), although the effect 
</p>
<p>was smaller for minority group members com-
</p>
<p>pared to majority group members (Tropp &amp; 
</p>
<p>Pettigrew, 2005).
</p>
<p>Moreover, the effect of intergroup contact 
</p>
<p>was larger in samples where contact was struc-
</p>
<p>tured to meet Allport&rsquo;s optimal contact condi-
</p>
<p>tions. This finding is important when it comes to 
</p>
<p>developing intergroup contact interventions. 
</p>
<p>However, even when the optimal conditions 
</p>
<p>were not explicitly incorporated, contact still 
</p>
<p>had a prejudice- reducing effect indicating that 
</p>
<p>these conditions are not essential in order that 
</p>
<p>intergroup contact shows positive effects but 
</p>
<p>generally enhance the positive effects. This facil-
</p>
<p>itating effect of Allport&rsquo;s conditions is also 
</p>
<p>reflected in findings that show that especially 
</p>
<p>intimate intergroup contact in form of intergroup 
</p>
<p>friendships is able to improve intergroup attitudes 
</p>
<p>(for a meta- analytical review, see Davies, Tropp, 
</p>
<p>Aron, Pettigrew, &amp; Wright, 2011).
</p>
<p>Besides providing evidence for a robust effect 
</p>
<p>of intergroup contact, Pettigrew and Tropp&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>meta-analysis also revealed that most studies are 
</p>
<p>based on cross-sectional data. Cross-sectional 
</p>
<p>designs, however, limit the causal interpretability 
</p>
<p>of the relation between intergroup contact and 
</p>
<p>prejudice. Thus, one cannot exclude the possibil-
</p>
<p>ity that the negative correlations between contact 
</p>
<p>and prejudice found in most cross-sectional 
</p>
<p>research are due to a selection bias: highly preju-
</p>
<p>diced individuals avoid intergroup contact, and 
</p>
<p>unprejudiced individuals seek out contact. 
</p>
<p>However, both experimental (for an overview, 
</p>
<p>Box 10.2 Question for Elaboration
</p>
<p>Imagine you are asked to design an inter-
</p>
<p>vention aiming at reducing prejudice 
</p>
<p>between students belonging to different 
</p>
<p>ethnic groups at a school.
</p>
<p>Based on Allport&rsquo;s (1954) optimal con-
</p>
<p>ditions, what could an intergroup contact 
</p>
<p>intervention look like?
</p>
<p>Box 10.3 Zooming In: Meta-analytic Test of 
</p>
<p>the Intergroup Contact Theory
</p>
<p>In 2006, Thomas F.&nbsp; Pettigrew and Linda 
</p>
<p>R.&nbsp; Tropp published a monumental meta- 
</p>
<p>analysis on intergroup contact. In general, 
</p>
<p>meta-analyses statistically integrate the 
</p>
<p>results of multiple studies. In this case, 
</p>
<p>Pettigrew and Tropp included studies on 
</p>
<p>intergroup contact up to December 2000 
</p>
<p>and analyzed the results of 515 studies with 
</p>
<p>713 independent samples leading to an 
</p>
<p>overall sample size of more than 250,000 
</p>
<p>individuals. The selection of studies com-
</p>
<p>prised research conducted in 38 different 
</p>
<p>nations, across a variety of target groups 
</p>
<p>using different methodological approaches. 
</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the study is one of the 
</p>
<p>most important publications in the field and 
</p>
<p>was cited more than 5000 times so far 
</p>
<p>(Google Scholar, 2018). Results indicate 
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;contact effects typically generalize to 
</p>
<p>the entire outgroup, and [that] they emerge 
</p>
<p>across a broad range of outgroup targets 
</p>
<p>and contact settings&rdquo; (Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 
</p>
<p>2006, p.&nbsp;751).

</p>
<p>see Paluck, Green, &amp; Green, 2018) and longitudi-
</p>
<p>nal studies (e.g., Binder, Zagefka, Brown, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Leyens, 2009; Levin, van Laar, &amp; Sidanius, 2003; 
</p>
<p>Swart, Hewstone, Christ, &amp; Voci, 2011) confirm 
</p>
<p>the meta-analytical results showing that inter-
</p>
<p>group contact indeed affects attitudes.
</p>
<p>Intergroup contact not only reduces prejudice 
</p>
<p>but influences a wide range of outcome measures 
</p>
<p>including more conflict-relevant outcomes 
</p>
<p>(Hewstone et&nbsp; al., 2014) such as outgroup trust 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Tam, Hewstone, Kenworthy, &amp; Cairns, 
</p>
<p>2009) and forgiveness (e.g., Hewstone, Cairns, 
</p>
<p>Voci, Hamberger, &amp; Niens, 2006; for a detailed 
</p>
<p>discussion see Dinnick &amp; Noor, Chap. 15). 
</p>
<p>Research also demonstrated that intergroup con-
</p>
<p>tact is especially effective for those individuals in 
</p>
<p>need (i.e., highly prejudiced individuals; Hodson, 
</p>
<p>Turner, &amp; Choma, 2017).
</p>
<p>The prejudice-reducing effect of intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact not only generalizes beyond the mem-
</p>
<p>bers involved in the original contact setting to 
</p>
<p>the whole group (Primary Transfer Effect; 
</p>
<p>see Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006). Importantly, 
</p>
<p>intergroup contact effects also generalize to 
</p>
<p>attitudes toward other, secondary, outgroups 
</p>
<p>not involved in the contact situation which is 
</p>
<p>labeled as the Secondary Transfer Effect of 
</p>
<p> intergroup contact (e.g., Pettigrew, 2009; Tausch 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>To conclude, it is now well-established that 
</p>
<p>(positive) face-to-face contact with members of 
</p>
<p>other groups reduces prejudicial attitudes toward 
</p>
<p>these outgroups and even generalizes toward 
</p>
<p>other groups.
</p>
<p> Different Forms of&nbsp;Intergroup 
Contact
</p>
<p>Although the evidence on the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>face-to-face (direct) intergroup contact is promis-
</p>
<p>ing, sometimes contact between group members 
</p>
<p>is difficult, if not impossible (e.g., due to segrega-
</p>
<p>tion or intense phases of intergroup conflict). 
</p>
<p>Moreover, intergroup encounters are sometimes 
</p>
<p>found to exacerbate intergroup bias, producing 
</p>
<p>heightened stress, anxiety, or outgroup avoidance 
</p>
<p>(Shelton, Dovidio, Hebl, &amp; Richeson, 2009; 
</p>
<p>Trawalter, Richeson, &amp; Shelton, 2009). Recent 
</p>
<p>work therefore suggested that even indirect forms 
</p>
<p>of intergroup contact (e.g., knowledge of or per-
</p>
<p>ceiving contact among others or imagined con-
</p>
<p>tact; see Fig.&nbsp; 10.1) may also have a beneficial 
</p>
<p>effect, but avoid the aforementioned limitations 
</p>
<p>of direct intergroup contact.
</p>
<p>The research by Wright et&nbsp; al. (1997) on 
</p>
<p>extended contact is pioneering in this regard. 
</p>
<p>Wright and colleagues provided first empirical 
</p>
<p>evidence that mere knowledge that an ingroup 
</p>
<p>member has a close relationship with an outgroup 
</p>
<p>member can improve intergroup attitudes. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, even simply observing or being made 
</p>

<p>reduces prejudice (Vezzali, Hewstone, Capozza, 
</p>
<p>Giovannini, &amp; W&ouml;lfer, 2014). A recent meta- 
</p>
<p>analysis by Zhou, Page-Gould, Aron, and 
</p>
<p>Hewstone (2018) strongly supported the effec-
</p>
<p>tiveness of extended and vicarious contact for 
</p>
<p>improving outgroup attitudes. Based on 115 stud-
</p>
<p>ies, results demonstrated a small-to-medium 
</p>
<p>effect size for extended and vicarious contact 
</p>
<p>(r&nbsp;=&nbsp;.25) and that these effects are over and above 
</p>
<p>direct contact experiences. Research also showed 
</p>
<p>that extended contact is especially effective for 
</p>
<p>people with few direct contact experiences or 
</p>
<p>who live in segregated rather than mixed com-
</p>
<p>munities (Christ et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>Based on the extended contact hypothesis,

<p>Christ et&nbsp; al. (2014) demonstrated a contextual 
</p>
<p>effect of intergroup contact (see Blalock, 1984).

<p>They showed that living in a place in which other

<p>ingroup members interact positively with members

<p>of the outgroup reduces prejudice over and above

<p>of whether one knows the ingroup members

<p>even individuals who have no direct contact

<p>experience can benefit from living in mixed set-

<p>norms in influencing intergroup relations as we 
</p>
<p>will also see later when we introduce an indirect 
</p>

</p>
<p>Crisp and Turner (2009) showed that even just

<p>imagining intergroup contact helps to reduce

<p>of Intergroup Contact (Christ et&nbsp;al., 2014)
</p>
<p>Responding to calls for more attention for 
</p>
<p>the social context of intergroup contact 
</p>
<p>effects (e.g., Pettigrew, 2008), Christ et&nbsp;al. 
</p>
<p>(2014) applied multilevel modelling to test 
</p>
<p>a contextual effect of intergroup contact. 
</p>
<p>Multilevel modelling allows for the simul-
</p>
<p>taneous consideration and analysis of dif-
</p>
<p>ferent levels of analysis in hierarchically 
</p>
<p>structured data (e.g., survey respondents 
</p>
<p>living in different neighborhoods/districts). 
</p>
<p>A contextual effect of intergroup contact is 
</p>
<p>defined as the difference between the effect 
</p>
<p>of intergroup contact on prejudice between 
</p>
<p>social contexts such as neighborhoods 
</p>
<p>(the between-level effect) and the effect of 
</p>
<p>individual-level contact within contexts 
</p>
<p>(the within-level effect; see Raudenbush &amp; 
</p>
<p>Bryk, 2002). Evidence for this contextual 
</p>
<p>effect of positive contact would indicate 
</p>
<p>that living in a place in which other ingroup 
</p>
<p>members interact positively with members 
</p>
<p>of the outgroup reduces prejudice over and 
</p>
<p>above one&rsquo;s own contact experiences and 
</p>
<p>irrespective of whether one knows the 
</p>
<p>ingroup members experiencing intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact. Indeed, Christ et&nbsp;al. (2014) found 
</p>
<p>support for this assumption in five cross- 
</p>
<p>sectional and two longitudinal studies. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the contextual effect of inter-
</p>
<p>group contact was partly explained by 
</p>
<p>(positive) social norms (i.e., the shared 
</p>
<p>beliefs about the value of ethnic and cul-
</p>
<p>tural diversity).

</p>
<p>in imagined contact studies. The standard 
</p>
<p>instruction (Crisp et&nbsp; al., 2009) is as follows, 
</p>
<p>although variants and extensions have been used: 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would like you to take a minute to imagine 
</p>
<p>yourself meeting [an outgroup] stranger for the 
</p>
<p>first time. Imagine that the interaction is positive, 
</p>
<p>relaxed and comfortable.&rdquo; The key elements that 
</p>
<p>proofed to be necessary are the simulation of an 
</p>
<p>interaction (first sentence of the instruction) 
</p>
<p>and the positive tone of the interaction (second 
</p>
<p>sentence of the instruction).
</p>
<p>Demonstrating that even with indirect inter-
</p>
<p>group contact (knowing or perceiving intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact of others or simply imagining an inter-
</p>
<p>group interaction) negative attitudes can be 
</p>
<p>improved offers a number of practical applica-
</p>
<p>tions in form of contact interventions (Brown &amp; 
</p>
<p>Paterson, 2016). For instance, portraying (posi-
</p>
<p>tive) interactions between members of different 
</p>
<p>groups provides a promising avenue to improve 
</p>
<p>intergroup relations on a large scale as has been 
</p>
<p>demonstrated by the work of Paluck (2009) 
</p>
<p>which we will summarize in more detail at the 
</p>
<p>end of this chapter. Moreover, research shows 
</p>
<p>that indirect contact prepares for direct contact 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Turner &amp; West, 2012; W&ouml;lfer et&nbsp;al., 2019), 
</p>
<p>thus helping to connect groups in conflict.
</p>
<p> When and&nbsp;Why Does Intergroup 
Contact Work?
</p>
<p>The effectiveness of direct and indirect intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact in reducing prejudice and improving inter-
</p>
<p>group relations has received convincing empirical 
</p>
<p>support. But research has not only focused on the 
</p>
<p>question whether intergroup contact helps to 
</p>
<p>reduce prejudice and therefore improves inter-
</p>
<p>group relations. There are also numerous studies 
</p>
<p>that focused on the questions when and why 
</p>
<p>intergroup contact works. These questions con-
</p>
<p>cern the moderation and mediation of intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact effects, respectively (see Kenworthy, 
</p>
<p>Turner, Hewstone, &amp; Voci, 2005).
</p>
<p> Moderators of&nbsp;Contact Effects
</p>
<p>Starting in the 1980s, scholar debated on the 
</p>
<p>question when contact is most likely to reduce 
</p>
<p>prejudice. Unlike Allport (1954) who focused on 
</p>
<p>optimal conditions that facilitate intergroup con-
</p>
<p>tact effects, this line of research tried to identify 
</p>
<p>the conditions for the primary transfer of inter-
</p>
<p>group contact effects. Different models have 
</p>
<p>been proposed with differing assumptions about 
</p>
<p>the cognitive representation of groups that should 
</p>
<p>be salient during the intergroup encounter. While 
</p>
<p>the decategorization model (Brewer &amp; Miller, 
</p>
<p>1984) proposes that the intergroup interaction 
</p>
<p>Box 10.5 Zooming In: Validity of Imagined 
</p>
<p>Intergroup Contact Effects
</p>
<p>The imagined contact hypothesis has 
</p>
<p>inspired numerous studies, not least because 
</p>
<p>of its simplicity. The empirical evidence 
</p>
<p>seems to support the imagined contact 
</p>
<p>hypothesis. A meta-analysis of 70 studies by 
</p>
<p>Miles and Crisp (2014) found that imagined 
</p>
<p>contact had a small to medium effect 
</p>
<p>(d+&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.35) on a number of outcomes (e.g., 
</p>
<p>explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes, 
</p>
<p>behavioral intentions). However, the imag-
</p>
<p>ined contact hypothesis is not left without 
</p>
<p>critique (Bigler &amp; Hughes, 2010; Lee &amp; 
</p>
<p>Jussim, 2010). Moreover, in a recent large-
</p>
<p>scale replication attempt, the effects have 
</p>
<p>not been supported (Klein et&nbsp; al., 2014). 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is still not clear how long-
</p>
<p>lasting the effects are. There are only few 
</p>
<p>longitudinal studies that tested the longevity 
</p>
<p>of effects, and only among younger partici-
</p>
<p>pants (Vezzali et&nbsp;al., 2015; Vezzali, Crisp, 
</p>
<p>Stathi, &amp; Giovannini, 2015). It is up to 
</p>
<p>future research to get a better idea of the 
</p>
<p>boundary conditions of imagined contact 
</p>
<p>and to answer the question whether imag-
</p>
<p>ined intergroup contact is a valid means for 
</p>
<p>sustainable prejudice reduction.

<p>should be based on an individual level by deem-
</p>
<p>phasizing the group categories, the recategoriza-
</p>
<p>tion model (e.g., Gaertner, Mann, Murrell, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dovidio, 1989) suggested to make a superordi-
</p>
<p>nate &ldquo;we&rdquo; category salient. The evidence so far, 
</p>
<p>however, speaks for the mutual intergroup differ-
</p>
<p>entiation model of Hewstone and Brown (Brown 
</p>
<p>&amp; Hewstone, 2005; Hewstone &amp; Brown, 1986) 
</p>
<p>that proposes that respective group memberships 
</p>
<p>should be salient in the contact situation. A con-
</p>
<p>ceptual overview of the different models is 
</p>
<p>depicted in Fig.&nbsp;10.2.
</p>
<p>Pettigrew (1998; see also Gaertner et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2000) in his formulation of an intergroup con-
</p>
<p>tact theory integrated these different models by 
</p>
<p>suggesting a three-stage model in which an opti-
</p>
<p>mal contact experience is developed gradually 
</p>
<p>(see Fig.&nbsp; 10.3). In the initial contact situation, 
</p>
<p>decategorization and individuation (Brewer &amp; 
</p>
<p>Miller, 1984) should occur to reduce intergroup 
</p>
<p>anxiety. In the next stage, the group categories 
</p>
<p>should be made salient in order to allow a gen-
</p>
<p>eralization of the individuals&rsquo; positive contact 
</p>
<p>experiences to the outgroup as a whole 
</p>
<p>(Hewstone &amp; Brown, 1986). In the last and most 
</p>
<p>optimal stage with regard to intergroup rela-
</p>
<p>tions, recategorization (Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 
</p>
<p>2000) should occur during which a perception 
</p>
<p>of a common ingroup is achieved (see also 
</p>
<p>Scheepers &amp; Ellemers, Chap. 9).

</p>
<p> Mediators of&nbsp;Contact Effects
</p>
<p>Numerous studies examined potential mediators 
</p>
<p>of intergroup contact effects (Brown &amp; Hewstone, 
</p>
<p>2005). Pettigrew and Tropp (2008) meta- 
</p>
<p>analytically examined a subset of the studies of 
</p>
<p>their meta-analysis on intergroup contact effects 
</p>
<p>(Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006). The results show that 
</p>
<p>contact exerts its effect on prejudice mainly by 
</p>
<p>reducing negative affect (e.g., intergroup anxiety) 
</p>
<p>and by inducing positive affective processes (e.g., 
</p>
<p>empathy and perspective taking), a result that was 
</p>
<p>recently confirmed in a longitudinal study (Swart 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2011). Cognitive mediators (e.g., intergroup 
</p>
<p>knowledge) seem to play a less important role.
</p>
<p> Undesirable and&nbsp;Unintended Effects 
of&nbsp;Intergroup Contact
</p>
<p>Research on intergroup contact has not been left 
</p>
<p>without critiques (e.g., Dixon, 2017). For instance, 
</p>
<p>research on intergroup contact has been criticized 
</p>
<p>for neglecting the outcomes of negative encoun-
</p>
<p>ters between members of different groups (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Dixon, Durrheim, &amp; Tredoux, 2005). Encounters 
</p>
<p>in which a member of one group is offended, 
</p>
<p>threatened, or physically harmed by a member of 
</p>
<p>a different group can be regarded as examples of 
</p>
<p>negative intergroup contact (for more examples, 
</p>
<p>see Hayward, Tropp, Hornsey, &amp; Barlow, 2017). 
</p>
<p>Although this critique is certainly justified, a dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of the effects of negative contact is beyond 
</p>
<p>the scope of this chapter in which we focus on the 
</p>
<p>more common positive courses of intergroup 
</p>
<p>encounters (Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011). However, 
</p>
<p>research on the effects of both positive and nega-
</p>
<p>tive intergroup contact is increasing in recent 
</p>
<p>years (Graf &amp; Paolini, 2017).
</p>
<p>Moreover, Dixon, Tropp, Durrheim, and 
</p>
<p>Tredoux (2010) criticize that most scientific work 
</p>
<p>on intergroup contact focuses disproportionally 
</p>
<p>on the majority group perspective, thereby 
</p>
<p>neglecting potential negative effects that contact 
</p>
<p>can have for members of low-status minority 
</p>
<p>groups. A number of scholars have argued that for 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged groups, positive intergroup contact 
</p>
<p>might actually evoke the so-called demobilizing 
</p>
<p>effects: positive intergroup contact might lead 
</p>
<p>low-status minority group members to dissociate 
</p>
<p>themselves from the needs of their group, thereby 
</p>
<p>decreasing support for social change that would 
</p>
<p>improve the situation for their group as a whole 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Dixon, Durrheim, &amp; Tredoux, 2007; Reicher, 
</p>
<p>2007; Wright &amp; Lubensky, 2009; for a recent over-
</p>
<p>view of this critical position, see Durrheim &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dixon, 2018). Indeed, Saguy, Tausch, Dovidio, 
</p>
<p>and Pratto (2009) demonstrated that, for low-sta-
</p>
<p>tus groups, positive contact with high-status group 
</p>
<p>members increased perceptions of outgroup fair-
</p>
<p>ness and, as a consequence, decreased support for 
</p>
<p>social change. Likewise, Dixon et&nbsp;al. (2007) found 
</p>
<p>that Black South Africans who had White out-
</p>
<p>group friends showed less support for anti-racism 
</p>
<p>policies than Black South Africans who had no 
</p>
<p>White friends (see also Tropp, Hawi, Van Laar, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Levin, 2012).
</p>
<p>Research just started to examine conditions that 
</p>
<p>lead to more positive intergroup relations without 
</p>
<p>diminishing legitimate protest aimed at reducing 
</p>
<p>inequality (e.g., Kauff, Green, Schmid, Hewstone, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Christ, 2016; Vezzali, Andrighetto, &amp; Saguy, 
</p>
<p>2016). For instance, Becker, Wright, Lubensky, 
</p>
<p>and Zhou (2013) demonstrated that the sedative 
</p>
<p>effect of intergroup contact (i.e., reducing collec-
</p>
<p>tive action intentions) for minority group members 
</p>
<p>did not occur when the high- status individual 
</p>
<p>addressed the illegitimacy of unequal intergroup 
</p>
<p>relations during the contact.
</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to identify 
</p>
<p>conditions that lead to an implementation of 
</p>
<p>intergroup harmony without inhibiting social 
</p>
<p>chance. One promising strategy seems to be to 
</p>
<p>emphasize both commonalities and differences in 
</p>
<p>the intergroup encounters (Saguy, Shchori-Eyal, 
</p>
<p>Hasan-Aslih, Sobol, &amp; Dovidio, 2017), a strategy 
</p>
<p>that has been implemented in some variants of 
</p>
<p>intergroup contact interventions as is illustrated 
</p>
<p>in the direct contact intervention that Shani and 
</p>
<p>Boehnke (2017) have evaluated and that we will 
</p>
<p>introduce in more detail below.
</p>
<p> Intergroup Contact Interventions
</p>
<p>Intergroup contact theory provides a clear and 
</p>
<p>concise guideline for interventions: individuals 
</p>
<p>from different groups have to be brought in direct

<p>153
</p>
<p>or indirect contact (Lemmer &amp; Wagner, 2015). It 
</p>
<p>is therefore not surprising that many interventions 
</p>
<p>for reducing prejudice are based on the intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact theory (see Wagner, Christ, &amp; van Dick, 
</p>
<p>2002). A recent meta-analysis by Lemmer and 
</p>
<p>Wagner (2015) summarized the results of inter-
</p>
<p>group contact interventions aimed at reducing eth-
</p>
<p>nic prejudice. In this meta- analysis contact 
</p>
<p>interventions were included that (a) have been 
</p>
<p>implemented under naturalistic conditions outside 
</p>
<p>the lab (e.g., in school settings) and that (b) had the 
</p>
<p>aim to establish direct or indirect contact between 
</p>
<p>members of different groups. Moreover, since the 
</p>
<p>goal of the meta-analysis was to include only those 
</p>
<p>studies that provide sufficient evidence for the 
</p>
<p>causal effect of intergroup contact (i.e., studies 
</p>
<p>with sufficient internal validity; see also Paluck &amp; 
</p>
<p>Green, 2009), only studies were included that used 
</p>
<p>a randomized posttest only with control, a pretest-
</p>
<p>posttest with control, or a pretest-posttest single 
</p>
<p>group design. It is important to note that the major-
</p>
<p>ity of studies (i.e., 85%) included in this meta-
</p>
<p>analysis were not considered in Pettigrew and 
</p>
<p>Tropp&rsquo;s meta- analysis (2006).
</p>
<p>Based on the inclusion criteria, 73 studies 
</p>
<p>with 129 independent comparisons have been 
</p>
<p>included in the meta-analysis. Overall, intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact interventions generally resulted in 
</p>
<p>improved intergroup attitudes (i.e., reduction in 
</p>
<p>ethnic prejudice), both immediately and up to 
</p>
<p>one year later, demonstrating the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>the implementation of either direct or indirect 
</p>
<p>contact forms. The estimated effect sizes can be 
</p>
<p>classified as small to medium (μ̂θ between 0.23 
</p>
<p>and 0.39; Cohen, 1988). Moreover, results show 
</p>
<p>that contact interventions are also effective in the 
</p>
<p>context of protracted intergroup conflicts (e.g., 
</p>
<p>conflict between Jewish and Palestinian Israelis, 
</p>
<p>Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland). 
</p>
<p>Although the effect of contact interventions was 
</p>
<p>stronger for ethnic majorities, interventions were 
</p>
<p>still effective for ethnic minorities.
</p>
<p>The meta-analytic results clearly confirm that 
</p>
<p>contact interventions are an effective means to 
</p>
<p>reduce prejudice and, thus, intergroup tensions. 
</p>
<p>Both direct and indirect contact interventions seem 
</p>
<p>to be comparably effective in improving inter-
</p>
<p>group attitudes. Importantly, contact interventions 
</p>
<p>seem to be more effective than other prejudice 
</p>
<p>interventions (see meta-analysis by Beelmann &amp; 
</p>
<p>Heinemann, 2014).
</p>
<p>In the following, we will describe two contact 
</p>
<p>interventions in more detail. In the first example, 
</p>
<p>Shani and Boehnke (2017) examined the effects 
</p>
<p>of a direct contact intervention in the context of 
</p>
<p>the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the second 
</p>
<p>example, Paluck (2009) tested the effects of a 
</p>
<p>radio program in which positive intergroup con-
</p>
<p>tact was portrayed, thus providing an example for 
</p>
<p>a contact intervention that implemented indirect 
</p>
<p>intergroup contact.
</p>
<p> An Example of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Direct Contact 
Intervention
</p>
<p>Intergroup contact theory has inspired a number 
</p>
<p>of planned encounters between members of 
</p>
<p>groups in conflict to contribute to reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>For instance, intergroup encounter interventions 
</p>
<p>between Jewish and Palestinian citizens have a 
</p>
<p>long history in Israel (Maoz, 2004). The conflict 
</p>
<p>between Israeli Jews and Palestinians is often 
</p>
<p>considered as a prototype of an intractable con-
</p>
<p>flict (Bar-Tal, 2013). Intractable conflicts are pro-
</p>
<p>longed, chronic, and violent and are perceived by 
</p>
<p>society members as existential, irresolvable, and 
</p>
<p>of zero-sum nature (Bar-Tal, 2007, 2013). 
</p>
<p>Different models of planned intergroup encoun-
</p>
<p>ters have been applied in this context (Maoz, 
</p>
<p>2004, 2011). The coexistence model seeks to pro-
</p>
<p>mote positive intergroup attitudes by emphasiz-
</p>
<p>ing commonalties and similarities between the 
</p>
<p>two groups. Political issues in disagreement 
</p>
<p>between the two parties are avoided. In contrast, 
</p>
<p>in the confrontational model, group membership 
</p>
<p>is made salient, and it is aimed to increase aware-
</p>
<p>ness among (mainly) majority members of struc-
</p>
<p>tural barriers for equality and to empower the 
</p>
<p>minority members. Programs based on the con-
</p>
<p>frontational model intend to change the construc-
</p>
<p>tion of identity of minority and majority members, 
</p>
<p>making Israeli Jews more aware of their dominant 
</p>
<p>role while empowering Palestinian Arabs through 
</p>
<p>their direct confrontation with Israeli Jews (Halabi 
</p>
<p>&amp; Sonnenschein, 2004).

</p>
<p>For both models, a number of limitations have 
</p>
<p>been identified (Maoz, 2011). For the coexistence 
</p>
<p>model, critiques question the focus on interper-
</p>
<p>sonal interaction and on personal identities, while 
</p>
<p>important issues such as the conflict between 
</p>
<p>Israeli Jews and Palestinians and the discrimina-
</p>
<p>tion of the Palestinian citizens of Israel are 
</p>
<p>ignored. Recent research on the sedative effect of 
</p>
<p>intergroup contact, as summarized above, sup-
</p>
<p>ports this critical view. The confrontational model 
</p>
<p>has been criticized since the direct confrontation 
</p>
<p>can distress and alienate Israeli Jewish partici-
</p>
<p>pants and cause negative attitudes and distrust 
</p>
<p>toward Palestinians and toward the practice of 
</p>
<p>encounters (Maoz, Bar-On, &amp; Yikya, 2007).
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; program&nbsp;&ndash; a mixed-model 
</p>
<p>encounter program&nbsp; &ndash; integrates elements of the 
</p>
<p>coexistence model as well as the confrontational 
</p>
<p>model. Both, interpersonal and political inter-
</p>
<p>group dynamics, are addressed within this 2-day 
</p>
<p>structured encounter. The program is endorsed by 
</p>
<p>the Israeli Ministry of Education and is conducted 
</p>
<p>as an official educational activity in cooperation 
</p>
<p>with Hebrew and Arabic high schools across the 
</p>
<p>country. Mixed groups of about eight to ten par-
</p>
<p>ticipants meet at neutral places and are guided by 
</p>
<p>trained Jewish and Palestinian facilitators (for a 
</p>
<p>detailed description, see Shani, 2015).
</p>
<p>The encounter has two main phases aiming to 
</p>
<p>gradually change from coexistence-focused to 
</p>
<p>confrontational activities. On the first day, activi-
</p>
<p>ties are implemented that aim to help participants 
</p>
<p>to become acquainted with each other and to 
</p>
<p>establish social relationships (e.g., talking about 
</p>
<p>hobbies, their likes and dislikes). Later, the focus 
</p>
<p>switches to the group level. Participants learn 
</p>
<p>about similarities and differences between their 
</p>
<p>cultural groups. Moreover, they discuss and con-
</p>
<p>front mutual stereotypical perceptions. Thus, the 
</p>
<p>activities in the first day resemble the first two 
</p>
<p>stages of the three-stage model of Pettigrew 
</p>
<p>(1998; see Fig.&nbsp; 10.3). Although most activities 
</p>
<p>are preplanned, the program allows for free inter-
</p>
<p>actions and non-structured discussion between 
</p>
<p>group members in public areas. One of the aims 
</p>
<p>of the first day is the development of affective ties 
</p>
<p>and mutual trust between the members of both 
</p>
<p>groups.
</p>
<p>On the second day, &ldquo;the competing national 
</p>
<p>and political identities&rdquo; (Shani, 2015, p.&nbsp;101) are 
</p>
<p>discussed. That is the groups discuss topics like 
</p>
<p>national identity, security, discrimination, democ-
</p>
<p>racy, and power differences between the groups. 
</p>
<p>In other words, the activities and discussions 
</p>
<p>focus on the core conflicts between the groups. 
</p>
<p>Because these kinds of dialogues can be intense 
</p>
<p>and evoke conflicting and complex emotional 
</p>
<p>reactions among the participants, the program 
</p>
<p>trainers try to reestablish a harmonious atmo-
</p>
<p>sphere at the end of the encounter. In fact, the 
</p>
<p>encounters usually end on a positive note. That is, 
</p>
<p>participants usually exchange their contact details 
</p>
<p>and express a willingness to maintain a friendship 
</p>
<p>with outgroup members.
</p>
<p>Shani and Boehnke (2017) tested the effec-
</p>
<p>tiveness of the &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; program. Using a 
</p>
<p>quasi-experimental design with two measure-
</p>
<p>ment points and comparing Jewish and 
</p>
<p>Palestinian pupils who participated in the pro-
</p>
<p>gram with comparable pupils who did not, the 
</p>
<p>authors found a significant intervention effect 
</p>
<p>for the Israeli Jewish participants on measures 
</p>
<p>such as readiness for outgroup contact and sup-
</p>
<p>port for equals rights (see Fig.&nbsp;10.4). Palestinian 
</p>
<p>participants reported higher levels of support for 
</p>
<p>inclusion after the encounter. Importantly, the 
</p>
<p>intervention did not undermine the perception 
</p>
<p>of intergroup disparities among both majority 
</p>
<p>and minority members. In line with aforemen-
</p>
<p>tioned findings (Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2008), tests 
</p>
<p>of mediators mainly identified affective pro-
</p>
<p>cesses as important. That is after the encounter 
</p>
<p>empathy increased and hatred decreased for 
</p>
<p>Jewish participants, while for Palestinian par-
</p>
<p>ticipants an increase in empathy and hope was 
</p>
<p>observed.
</p>
<p>Overall, the results demonstrate the effective-
</p>
<p>ness of mixed-model encounters, although it was 
</p>
<p>more effective for Israeli Jewish than for 
</p>
<p>Palestinian participants. To conclude, the &ldquo;face- 
</p>
<p>to- face&rdquo; illustrates that direct intergroup contact 
</p>
<p>interventions are able to improve intergroup rela-
</p>
<p>tions&nbsp;&ndash; even in intractable conflicts. However, as 
</p>
<p>Shani and Boehnke (2017) point out, it is impor-
</p>
<p>tant to develop interventions in a way that &ldquo;takes 
</p>
<p>into consideration the different preferences and 
</p>

</p>
<p>needs of each group, and which does not shy 
</p>
<p>away from dealing with the problems that shape 
</p>
<p>the relations between the groups&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;8).
</p>
<p> An Example of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Indirect Contact 
Intervention
</p>
<p>As outlined before, indirect contact interventions 
</p>
<p>are also promising since they can be imple-
</p>
<p>mented with fewer resources and are therefore 
</p>
<p>less costly. In addition, they can be implemented 
</p>
<p>even in highly segregated contexts or contexts in 
</p>
<p>which it is difficult to bring members from 
</p>
<p>opposing groups together. Most importantly, 
</p>
<p>when vicarious contact interventions are used, 
</p>
<p>more individuals can be reached, and since social 
</p>
<p>norms might be changed, the effect might be 
</p>
<p>more sustainable.
</p>
<p>Paluck (2009) conducted a study in Rwanda 
</p>
<p>aiming at testing the influence of mass media 
</p>
<p>(here radio) on prejudice, norms, and intergroup 
</p>
<p>behavior. In 1994, during the Rwandan Civil War, 
</p>
<p>members of the main majority group, the Hutu, 
</p>
<p>mass slaughtered between 500,000 and 1,000,000 
</p>
<p>members of the main minority group, the Tutsi. 
</p>
<p>Naturally, Rwanda is still struggling with the con-
</p>
<p>sequences of this genocide. Perpetrators and vic-
</p>
<p>tims are living side by side, and, not surprisingly, 
</p>
<p>the climate is dominated by distrust and mutual 
</p>
<p>devaluation. Accordingly, there are numerous 
</p>
<p>attempts to improve the relation between the 
</p>
<p>Hutu and the Tutsi. One of them is &ldquo;New Dawn,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>a reconciliation radio soap opera involving the 
</p>
<p>fictional story of two Rwandan ethnic groups that 
</p>
<p>can be associated with the Hutu and Tutsi com-
</p>
<p>munities. Characters of the radio show are por-
</p>
<p>trayed as typical Rwandans wrestling with 
</p>
<p>problems familiar to most of the listeners. Hence, 
</p>
<p>listeners can easily connect with the characters 
</p>
<p>depicted in the radio show. In Rwanda, radio is the 
</p>
<p>most important form of media. As a consequence, 
</p>
<p>it is likely that the program is capable of changing 
</p>
<p>social norms. Although in her study Paluck (2009) 
</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t approach &ldquo;New Dawn&rdquo; from an intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact perspective, the intervention contains 
</p>
<p>elements of vicarious contact. Within the soap, 
</p>
<p>characters belonging to the two rival groups band 
</p>
<p>together and confront leaders who support the 
</p>
<p>use of violence. They cooperate across commu-
</p>
<p>nity lines and promote positive norms about 
</p>
<p>intermarriage.
</p>
<p>Paluck (2009) studied the effects of &ldquo;New 
</p>
<p>Dawn&rdquo; within a 1-year field experiment. She 
</p>
<p>sampled 12 communities from four different 
</p>
<p>regions in Rwanda. Each community was ran-
</p>
<p>domly assigned to a treatment or a control condi-
</p>
<p>tion. For each community, 40 participants were 
</p>
<p>either exposed to &ldquo;New Dawn&rdquo; (treatment) or a 
</p>
<p>radio health program (control). Because

</p>
<p>η2&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.17). Jewish participants were more willing to 
</p>
<p>engage in intergroup activities after the encounter than 
</p>
<p>before the encounter (d&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.32). For Palestinians no sig-
</p>
<p>nificant interaction effect emerged (F(1, 255)&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.79,

</p>
<p>Rwandans typically listen to the radio in groups, 
</p>
<p>research assistants visited each community once 
</p>
<p>a month and played four episodes of the respec-
</p>
<p>tive radio program on a portable cassette player. 
</p>
<p>The health program participants were asked to 
</p>
<p>refrain from listening to &ldquo;New Dawn.&rdquo; They were 
</p>
<p>promised a cassette player and tapes with all 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Dawn&rdquo; episodes at the end of the study.
</p>
<p>After 1&nbsp;year, researchers went to the commu-
</p>
<p>nities to gather different types of data&nbsp;&ndash; among 
</p>
<p>them data from individual and group interviews 
</p>
<p>as well as from behavioral observations. Results 
</p>
<p>of the analyses of these data indicated that par-
</p>
<p>ticipants who listened to the reconciliation soap 
</p>
<p>opera displayed more cooperative intergroup 
</p>
<p>behavior, compared with participants in a control 
</p>
<p>condition listening to a soap opera on health 
</p>
<p>issues. Moreover, participants in the experimen-
</p>
<p>tal group believed that current social norms were 
</p>
<p>more supportive of intergroup integration and 
</p>
<p>were also more trusting of the outgroup and more 
</p>
<p>willing to cooperate with them, even though the 
</p>
<p>participants did not show a change in their per-
</p>
<p>sonal beliefs with regard to the program&rsquo;s message 
</p>
<p>about prejudice and violence.
</p>
<p>Paluck&rsquo;s (2009) study illustrates that social 
</p>
<p>norms regarding inclusion can be affected by 
</p>
<p>observation of others&rsquo; behavior (vicarious inter-
</p>
<p>group contact). Moreover, this research also 
</p>
<p>demonstrates how insights from research on 
</p>
<p>intergroup contact can be translated in a rela-
</p>
<p>tively simple intervention that has the potential to 
</p>
<p>affect a large number of individuals.
</p>
<p>Box 10.8 Zooming In: Measuring Behavior in 
</p>
<p>Paluck (2009)
</p>
<p>In her study on the effects of the radio pro-
</p>
<p>gram &ldquo;New Dawn&rdquo; in Rwanda, Elizabeth 
</p>
<p>Levy Paluck did not only obtain data from 
</p>
<p>self-report questionnaires or group dis-
</p>
<p>cussions. Aiming at getting a broad pic-
</p>
<p>ture of the effects of the intervention, she 
</p>
<p>also gathered behavioral data. Research 
</p>
<p>assistants documented group discus-
</p>
<p>sions in communities about how batter-
</p>
<p>ies and tapes for a cassette player should 
</p>
<p>be shared among community members. 
</p>
<p>Paluck (2009) argued that this measure 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;also captured spontaneous behavior that 
</p>
<p>participants believed to be &lsquo;off the record&rsquo;&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(p.&nbsp;579).
</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the control group, 
</p>
<p>community members typically decided to 
</p>
<p>hand the items over to the village&rsquo;s local 
</p>
<p>authority. In the experimental reconcilia-
</p>
<p>tion groups, however, group members 
</p>
<p>often claimed that the whole group is 
</p>
<p>responsible for the items or that they 
</p>
<p>should vote for a member responsible of 
</p>
<p>managing the items. In the experimental 
</p>
<p>groups, more comments were made about 
</p>
<p>the groups&rsquo; ability to cooperate and inter-
</p>
<p>act in the future (e.g., to continue to listen 
</p>
<p>to the program together). Thus, also these 
</p>
<p>behavioral data hint to the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>the intervention.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Intergroup contact, that is, contact 
</p>
<p>between members of different groups, 
</p>
<p>is an effective means to reduce mutual 
</p>
<p>prejudice and increase trust and 
</p>
<p>forgiveness.
</p>
<p>&bull; Besides direct (i.e., face-to-face) inter-
</p>
<p>group contact, other more indirect forms 
</p>
<p>of intergroup contact such as extended, 
</p>
<p>vicarious, and imagined contact have 
</p>
<p>been shown to be effective.
</p>
<p>&bull; Different types of in- and outgroup cat-
</p>
<p>egorization are proposed as moderators 
</p>
<p>of intergroup contact effects.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduced intergroup anxiety and 
</p>
<p>increased empathy have been shown to 
</p>
<p>mediate intergroup contact effects.
</p>
<p>&bull; Intergroup contact interventions have 
</p>
<p>been shown to improve intergroup 
</p>
<p>attitudes.

<p> Guiding Answers to&nbsp;Questions 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Q (With Box 10.2): Imagine you are asked to 
</p>
<p>design an intervention aiming at reducing 
</p>
<p>prejudice between students belonging to dif-
</p>
<p>ferent ethnic groups at schools.
</p>
<p>Based on Allport&rsquo;s (1954) optimal condi-
</p>
<p>tions, what could an intergroup contact inter-
</p>
<p>vention look like?
</p>
<p>A:
</p>
<p> 1. Students from different ethnic groups 
</p>
<p>could work together on a certain task (e.g., 
</p>
<p>developing a strategy to refurbish the 
</p>
<p>school building).
</p>
<p> 2. It should be made explicit that they have a 
</p>
<p>common goal.
</p>
<p> 3. When working together, students must be 
</p>
<p>on a par with each other, that is, they need 
</p>
<p>to have the same rights and privileges.
</p>
<p> 4. Teachers and principals support them and 
</p>
<p>ensure that they jointly work on the 
</p>
<p>assigned task.
</p>
<p> 2. Q (With Box 10.6): Think about situations 
</p>
<p>and contexts in which imagined intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact is especially useful.
</p>
<p>A:
</p>
<p>&bull; When opportunities for contact with outgroup 
</p>
<p>members are rare (e.g., in highly segregated 
</p>
<p>or conflict areas), when the number of out-
</p>
<p>group members is small (e.g., North Korean 
</p>
<p>immigrants in the USA), or when outgroup 
</p>
<p>members do not participate in everyday life 
</p>
<p>(e.g., inmates)
</p>
<p>&bull; When ingroup members are unwilling to 
</p>
<p>engage in direct contact with outgroup mem-
</p>
<p>bers&nbsp;&ndash; either because they are strongly biased 
</p>
<p>against outgroup members or because they are 
</p>
<p>afraid of meeting outgroup members
</p>
<p>&bull; When the outcome of a direct intergroup 
</p>
<p>contact situation is unclear (e.g., when a lan-
</p>
<p>guage barrier exists and challenges a func-
</p>
<p>tional interaction between members of 
</p>
<p>different groups)
</p>
<p> 3. Q (With Box 10.7): Imagine a new group of 
</p>
<p>immigrants, the Ondereans, came to your 
</p>
<p>country. You are planning to have several 
</p>
<p>meetings with an Onderean. According to 
</p>
<p>Pettigrew&rsquo;s three-stage model, how should 
</p>
<p>you try to behave during the meetings to facil-
</p>
<p>itate mutual liking?
</p>
<p>A:
</p>
<p>&bull; At first, try to encounter the Onderean on 
</p>
<p>an individual level. Try to avoid thinking 
</p>
<p>too much about his/her group member-
</p>
<p>ship. Do not refer to your group 
</p>
<p>membership.
</p>
<p>&bull; Once primary contact has been established,

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Soccer spectators taunt black players with mon-
</p>
<p>key calls and bananas.1 Women on corporate 
</p>
<p>boards are ridiculed by their male colleagues for 
</p>
<p>allegedly being too chatty.2 And politicians in 
</p>
<p>high office refer to immigrants as criminals and 
</p>
<p>rapists.3 These examples of prejudice are con-
</p>
<p>temporary, but the issue itself is a fundamental 
</p>
<p>and all too common aspect of human interaction. 
</p>
<p>As in these examples, prejudice can lead to delib-
</p>
<p>erate acts of discrimination. People choose to 
</p>
<p>derogate outgroups to elevate their ingroup&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>status and their personal self-esteem (Hogg &amp; 
</p>
<p>Abrams, 1990; see Scheepers &amp; Ellemers, 
</p>
<p>Chap. 9); people intentionally denigrate an out-
</p>
<p>group to preserve their ingroup power (Sidanius &amp; 
</p>
<p>Pratto, 1999) or in a calculated political move use 
</p>
<p>an outgroup as a scapegoat for societal ills (Glick, 
</p>
<p>2002). However, beyond such deliberate acts, 
</p>
<p>where prejudice serves as a means to a particular 
</p>
<p>end, group attitudes and stereotypes may influ-
</p>
<p>ence judgment and behavior without any intent 
</p>
<p>to discriminate or treat members of one group

</p>
<p>different from those of another group. For example, 
</p>
<p>white observers perceive black faces as angrier 
</p>
<p>than white faces with the same expression 
</p>
<p>(Hugenberg &amp; Bodenhausen, 2003); and they 
</p>
<p>more readily identify an ambiguous object as a 
</p>
<p>gun when it is in the hands of a black rather than 
</p>
<p>a white man (Correll, Wittenbrink, Crawford, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Sadler, 2015). They do so even when motivated 
</p>
<p>to be accurate, at times not even knowing that the 
</p>
<p>target person&rsquo;s group membership influences the 
</p>
<p>outcome. This kind of implicit bias is usually 
</p>
<p>subtle. It pales in comparison to the deliberate 
</p>
<p>bigotry we cited at the beginning of this para-
</p>
<p>graph. But implicit forms of prejudice can never-
</p>
<p>theless have significant consequences, such as 
</p>
<p>when law enforcement officers must decide 
</p>
<p>whether an encounter is potentially hostile and 
</p>
<p>requires the use of deadly force.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we provide an introduction to 
</p>
<p>implicit forms of prejudice. We begin by defining 
</p>
<p>prejudice and its related constructs, stereotypes, 
</p>
<p>and discrimination. Next, we explain how preju-
</p>
<p>dice may implicitly influence behavior and under 
</p>
<p>what circumstances such influences are most 
</p>
<p>likely. We conclude with a description of a 
</p>
<p>research project that applies these theoretical 
</p>
<p>insights to a consequential real-world problem, 
</p>
<p>the influence of race on police officers&rsquo; use of 
</p>
<p>lethal force.
</p>
<p> What Is Prejudice?
</p>
<p>In social psychology, prejudice is broadly consid-
</p>
<p>ered a negative attitude toward a social group and 
</p>
<p>its members (Dovidio, Hewstone, Glick, &amp; Esses, 
</p>
<p>2010). However, to differentiate it more effec-
</p>
<p>tively from related constructs, a narrower defini-
</p>
<p>tion is usually adopted where prejudice represents 
</p>
<p>the affective (or emotional) component of group 
</p>
<p>attitudes. It captures the negative evaluative pre-
</p>
<p>disposition toward a social category and its mem-
</p>
<p>bers, the dislike felt toward the group (see Correll, 
</p>
<p>Judd, Park, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2010). Stereotypes, 
</p>
<p>by contrast, encompass the cognitive (or belief) 
</p>
<p>component of group attitudes. They consist of 
</p>
<p>generalizations that associate category members 
</p>
<p>with typical and distinctive attributes. The stereo-
</p>
<p>type for academics, for instance, might hold that 
</p>
<p>they are smart but possess limited social skills or 
</p>
<p>that they tend to be forgetful. Lastly, discrimina-
</p>
<p>tion makes up the behavioral component of 
</p>
<p>group attitudes. It is commonly defined as behav-
</p>
<p>ior toward members of a social category where 
</p>
<p>the behavior occurs solely because of the target&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>category membership. For example, a job appli-
</p>
<p>cant is rejected because of her gender, despite 
</p>
<p>having all the necessary credentials.
</p>
<p>Naturally, prejudice, stereotypes, and discrim-
</p>
<p>ination are closely interrelated. For example, 
</p>
<p>while stereotypes in and of themselves can be 
</p>
<p>negative, neutral, or positive in valence, the ste-
</p>
<p>reotypes associated with disliked groups typi-
</p>
<p>cally contain negatively valenced attributes. 
</p>
<p>Likewise, the negative evaluation of a group may

<p> How Does Prejudice Shape 
Judgment and&nbsp;Behavior?
</p>
<p>The characterization of prejudice as an evaluative 
</p>
<p>predisposition emphasizes the distinction 
</p>
<p>between prejudice and behavior. Like attitudes in 
</p>
<p>general, prejudice represents an individual&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>inclination to act in a particular way, not the act 
</p>
<p>itself. So how and when does the inclination to 
</p>
<p>act turn into actual behavior? Contemporary

</p>
<p>accounts of how attitudes shape behavior gener-
</p>
<p>ally distinguish between three processing stages: 
</p>
<p>(1) an initial spontaneous activation phase, (2) 
</p>
<p>a deliberation phase, and (3) a response phase 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Bassili &amp; Brown, 2005, Fazio, 1990; 
</p>
<p>Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2011; Krosnick, 
</p>
<p>Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2005; Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 
</p>
<p>1986; Strack &amp; Deutsch, 2004; Wilson, Lindsey, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Schooler, 2000).
</p>
<p> Spontaneous Activation Phase
</p>
<p>For well-established, overlearned attitudes, evalua-
</p>
<p>tions may be triggered automatically, without 
</p>
<p>intent, effort, or conscious awareness. Such evalua-
</p>
<p>tions are fast. They occur within a few hundred mil-
</p>
<p>liseconds. They do not require any intentional 
</p>
<p>search for relevant information, but instead are the 
</p>
<p>result of a passive process that is set in motion auto-
</p>
<p>matically by the attitude object (e.g., a group mem-
</p>
<p>ber). They may even occur without awareness. 
</p>
<p>Many empirical demonstrations of such spontane-
</p>
<p>ous evaluations exist for social categories that are 
</p>
<p>pervasive in social interaction, categories like 
</p>
<p>gender (e.g., Rudman &amp; Goodwin, 2004), race 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Wittenbrink, Judd &amp; Park, 1997), ethnicity 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998), or 
</p>
<p>the elderly (Perdue &amp; Gurtman, 1990).
</p>
<p> Deliberation Phase
</p>
<p>The second stage of evaluative processing con-
</p>
<p>sists of a controlled memory search for relevant 
</p>
<p>information. This could include prior evaluations 
</p>
<p>stored in memory (&ldquo;I like the English&rdquo;) as well as 
</p>
<p>any other related associations (&ldquo;polite,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo;). 
</p>
<p>What information comes to mind at this point 
</p>
<p>depends on its accessibility in memory, as well as 
</p>
<p>contextual factors that may highlight certain 
</p>
<p>information. Importantly, deliberation requires 
</p>
<p>both motivation and opportunity, the motivation 
</p>
<p>to explore one&rsquo;s true feelings about the issue, and 
</p>
<p>to form an accurate judgment, and an opportunity 
</p>
<p>to do so, to attend to the issue and be able to take 
</p>
<p>the time necessary to deliberate. Otherwise any 
</p>
<p>initial spontaneous evaluation will directly 
</p>
<p>impact the final evaluative response.
</p>
<p> Response Phase
</p>
<p>The input from phases 1 and 2 may then shape 
</p>
<p>any actual behavior. Often, these influences are 
</p>
<p>explicit. That is, the response is chosen based on 
</p>
<p>a deliberate consideration of the evaluative input, 
</p>
<p>combined with other relevant information. For 
</p>
<p>example, having concluded that I like the English, 
</p>
<p>I decide to take up the invitation to visit my 
</p>
<p>acquaintance in London. Or, alternatively, I 
</p>
<p>might conclude that although I quite like the 
</p>
<p>English and would like to visit, a visit is too 
</p>
<p>expensive, or it might get me in trouble with my 
</p>
<p>family which has been planning another trip 
</p>
<p>instead. In either case, a response is chosen with 
</p>
<p>deliberate consideration of the evaluative input.
</p>
<p>In contrast, evaluative influences can also 
</p>
<p>occur implicitly, with the person remaining 
</p>
<p>unaware of the connection between evaluation 
</p>
<p>and response, or at least without any intention for 
</p>
<p>the evaluation to influence a response. As noted, 
</p>
<p>spontaneous evaluations triggered during phase 1 
</p>
<p>may remain outside of conscious awareness. 
</p>
<p>Hence, any effect such evaluations might have on 
</p>
<p>a subsequent response will remain outside of 
</p>
<p>awareness. In addition, the opportunity to modify 
</p>
<p>spontaneous evaluations through deliberation 
</p>
<p>may not be available. For example, in circum-
</p>
<p>stances where responses have to be made under 
</p>
<p>time pressure, deliberation may not be feasible. 
</p>
<p>We will discuss these circumstances and other 
</p>
<p>factors that facilitate implicit influences of preju-
</p>
<p>dice in greater detail in the next section.
</p>
<p>Box 11.1 Zooming In: Measures of Implicit 
</p>
<p>Prejudice
</p>
<p>Various attitude measures exist that aim to 
</p>
<p>capture spontaneously activated attitudes, 
</p>
<p>free of processes that take place during 
</p>
<p>the deliberation and response phases of 
</p>
<p>11 Implicit Prejudice</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>166
</p>
<p>evaluative processing. The measures gener-
</p>
<p>ally ask respondents to make speeded, 
</p>
<p>split-second judgments, and they capture 
</p>
<p>response latencies and/or response errors 
</p>
<p>as estimates of spontaneous evaluations 
</p>
<p>(for an overview of available measures, see 
</p>
<p>Wittenbrink &amp; Schwarz, 2007). Prejudice 
</p>
<p>has been one of the main domains of appli-
</p>
<p>cation for these measures&nbsp;&ndash; in part because 
</p>
<p>the measures are meant to circumvent 
</p>
<p>deliberation and therefore limit respon-
</p>
<p>dents&rsquo; opportunities to intentionally mis-
</p>
<p>represent prejudiced attitudes when they 
</p>
<p>are deemed socially undesirable.
</p>
<p>The IAT (Implicit Association Test; 
</p>
<p>Greenwald et&nbsp; al., 1998) is by far the most 
</p>
<p>popular implicit measure of attitudes. In this 
</p>
<p>task, participants classify as quickly as pos-
</p>
<p>sible two sets of target items along two 
</p>
<p>dimensions of judgment. For example, as an 
</p>
<p>implicit measure of racial prejudice, the first 
</p>
<p>set of items might consist of faces that have 
</p>
<p>to be classified according to their race by 
</p>
<p>pressing one of two response keys, labeled 
</p>
<p>black and white, respectively. A second set 
</p>
<p>of items then consists of clearly valenced 
</p>
<p>positive and negative targets (e.g., poison, 
</p>
<p>love). The task for this second set is to 
</p>
<p>classify the items according to their 
</p>
<p>valence, using response keys labeled 
</p>
<p>pleasant and unpleasant.
</p>
<p>During a set of critical trials, both judg-
</p>
<p>ment tasks are combined, and the faces and 
</p>
<p>valence items appear in random order. 
</p>
<p>Important for the measurement, both judg-
</p>
<p>ment tasks are performed using the same 
</p>
<p>two response keys. Two separate blocks of 
</p>
<p>trials vary the mapping of the racial cate-
</p>
<p>gories on the response keys, so that each 
</p>
<p>group label is paired once with the positive 
</p>
<p>response key and once with the negative 
</p>
<p>key (e.g., black-pleasant and white- 
</p>
<p>unpleasant versus black-unpleasant and 
</p>
<p>white-pleasant). The critical measure 
</p>
<p>compares the response latencies for these 
</p>
<p>two assessment blocks. Faster responses 
</p>
<p>are used as an indicator of relative evalua-
</p>
<p>tive preference. For example, relatively 
</p>
<p>faster responses for trials that pair white 
</p>
<p>with pleasant and black with unpleasant 
</p>
<p>are considered to reflect racial prejudice 
</p>
<p>(for a detailed review of experimental pro-
</p>
<p>cedure and data analysis, see Greenwald, 
</p>
<p>Nosek, &amp; Banaji, 2003).
</p>
<p>Implicit measures of attitudes, and the 
</p>
<p>IAT in particular, have been criticized for 
</p>
<p>their limited success in predicting actual 
</p>
<p>behavior (cf., Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, 
</p>
<p>Jaccard, &amp; Tetlock, 2013). Meta-analyses of 
</p>
<p>studies linking IAT prejudice measures with 
</p>
<p>discriminatory behavior indeed show the 
</p>
<p>IAT to have only modest predictive validity 
</p>
<p>(r&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.24; Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Banaji, 2009). However, these findings 
</p>
<p>have to be seen in context. First, explicit 
</p>
<p>measures of prejudice don&rsquo;t fare any better 
</p>
<p>in predicting discrimination. In direct com-
</p>
<p>parisons, they actually fare worse (r&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.17; 
</p>
<p>Greenwald et&nbsp; al., 2009). Second, as we 
</p>
<p>noted before, prejudice reflects merely an 
</p>
<p>inclination to act. Its link with actual behav-
</p>
<p>ior is conditional on a variety of factors. At 
</p>
<p>the individual level, overall correlations 
</p>
<p>between a person&rsquo;s prejudice and specific 
</p>
<p>behavioral choices are therefore expected to 
</p>
<p>be modest. In contrast, when aggregating 
</p>
<p>across many individuals, the correlations 
</p>
<p>between implicit measures of prejudice and 
</p>
<p>overall patterns of behavior strengthen. For 
</p>
<p>example, US cities with overall higher levels 
</p>
<p>of implicit racial prejudice (as measured by 
</p>
<p>an IAT) show greater racial bias in police-
</p>
<p>involved shootings (Hehman, Flake, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Calanchini, 2018). Likewise, a community&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>overall implicit racial prejudice on the IAT 
</p>
<p>predicts adverse health outcomes for its 
</p>
<p>black residents (Leitner, Hehman, Ayduk, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Mendoza- Denton, 2016).

</p>
<p> Factors that Facilitate Implicit 
Prejudice
</p>
<p>Our discussion of how attitudes influence behav-
</p>
<p>ior, and how such influences may occur implicitly, 
</p>
<p>makes it clear that the title of this chapter, Implicit 
</p>
<p>Prejudice, is a bit of a misnomer. Often, it is not 
</p>
<p>the prejudice&nbsp;&ndash; the evaluative predisposition&nbsp;&ndash; that 
</p>
<p>is implicit. It is the effect that prejudicial attitudes 
</p>
<p>can have on judgment and behavior that is poten-
</p>
<p>tially implicit (see Moors &amp; De Houwer, 2006). 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Implicit Prejudice has become a 
</p>
<p>commonly used term to describe the phenomenon, 
</p>
<p>and we follow this convention here.
</p>
<p>The potential for prejudiced attitudes to oper-
</p>
<p>ate implicitly has important theoretical and practi-
</p>
<p>cal implications, not the least of which is that it 
</p>
<p>bears the risk of discriminatory behavior in the 
</p>
<p>absence of intent or possibly awareness. Even in 
</p>
<p>circumstances where people want to be fair and 
</p>
<p>unbiased, they may end up with bigoted judg-
</p>
<p>ments and discriminatory behavior. There are a 
</p>
<p>variety of factors that may promote this dissocia-
</p>
<p>tion between intentions and actions (for additional 
</p>
<p>detail, see Krosnick, et&nbsp;al., 2005).
</p>
<p> Time Pressure
</p>
<p>We already mentioned one of these factors: when 
</p>
<p>making quick, perhaps even split-second, deci-
</p>
<p>sions, limited opportunity exists to deliberate over 
</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s true feelings and the correct course of actions 
</p>
<p>they imply. Therefore, under time pressure the 
</p>
<p>response is disproportionately influenced by 
</p>
<p>information that comes to mind quickly (Bargh, 
</p>
<p>1997; Sanbonmatsu &amp; Fazio, 1990). That is, 
</p>
<p>spontaneous evaluations are more likely to shape 
</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s actions, even though one would reject them 
</p>
<p>as being irrelevant, inadmissible, or otherwise 
</p>
<p>inapplicable for the decision at hand, if given the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to reflect. Hence, quick responses are 
</p>
<p>more likely to be implicitly prejudiced.
</p>
<p> Limited Cognitive Resources
</p>
<p>Deliberation is effortful. It requires us to maintain 
</p>
<p>focus, to integrate possibly disparate pieces of 
</p>
<p>information, and to separate relevant from irrele-
</p>
<p>vant information. People&rsquo;s capacity to perform 
</p>
<p>these cognitive operations is limited. Thus, doing 
</p>
<p>multiple things at once interferes with people&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>ability to perform these operations adequately, and 
</p>
<p>the response they execute may not be the one 
</p>
<p>intended (Govorun &amp; Payne, 2006; Macrae, Milne, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Bodenhausen, 1994). Likewise, fatigue and 
</p>
<p>periods during the daily circadian rhythm where 
</p>
<p>arousal is lowered are associated with reduced 
</p>
<p>cognitive processing capacity (Bodenhausen, 
</p>
<p>1990; Ma et&nbsp; al., 2013). With fewer processing 
</p>
<p>resources available to deliberate one&rsquo;s evaluation 
</p>
<p>and response, the resulting behavior is more 
</p>
<p>likely to be implicitly prejudiced.
</p>
<p> Ambiguity
</p>
<p>Some choices are straightforward. They involve 
</p>
<p>clear and unambiguous input with each piece of 
</p>
<p>information pointing to the same conclusion. 
</p>
<p>Other choices are more complex with conflicting 
</p>
<p>and possibly incomplete information. Resolving 
</p>
<p>the ambiguity as to what the proper evaluation 
</p>
<p>and response should be takes additional time and 
</p>
<p>effort. Moreover, spontaneous evaluations which 
</p>
<p>become available early in the process may shape 
</p>
<p>the interpretation of subsequent information.

<p>responses are more likely to be implicitly preju-

</p>
<p>Correll et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p> Lack of&nbsp;Motivation
</p>
<p>People are not always motivated to deliberate their 
</p>
<p>options. Mindless actions may bypass deliberation 
</p>
<p>and rely solely on spontaneous evaluations  (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Chen, Shechter, &amp; Chaiken, 1996; Kruglanski &amp; 
</p>
<p>Freund, 1983). In circumstances where people are 
</p>
<p>less curious, or care less about the accuracy of 
</p>
<p>their judgments, responses are more likely to be 
</p>
<p>implicitly prejudiced as well.
</p>
<p> Implicit Prejudice in&nbsp;Practice
</p>
<p>We began this chapter noting that prejudice 
</p>
<p>and discrimination are an all too common 
</p>
<p>aspect of human interaction. In the United 
</p>
<p>States, for example, a significant wage gap con-
</p>
<p>tinues to exist between similarly educated men 
</p>
<p>and women working full time in the same occupa-
</p>
<p>tion (Goldin, 2014). Likewise minority groups in 
</p>
<p>the United States face considerable discrimina-
</p>
<p>tion in the labor market, at levels that have 
</p>
<p>remained virtually unchanged for the past 25&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>(Quillian, Pager, Hexel, Midtb&oslash;en, 2017). In fact, 
</p>
<p>the majority of blacks living in the United States 
</p>
<p>report having personally experienced unfair treat-
</p>
<p>ment because of their race or ethnicity (71%; Pew 
</p>
<p>Research Center, 2016a).
</p>
<p>One of the focal issues of the public debate on 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination in recent years has been 
</p>
<p>biased treatment in law enforcement and in par-
</p>
<p>ticular the use of deadly force by police officers. 
</p>
<p>Although the US government maintains only an 
</p>
<p>incomplete database on the issue, estimates by 
</p>
<p>public advocacy groups and journalists are that 
</p>
<p>1093 civilians were killed by police in 2016 
</p>
<p>(1146&nbsp;in 2015).4 For comparison, the total number 
</p>
<p>of civilians shot and killed in Germany with a 
</p>
<p>quarter of the US population was 11&nbsp; in 2016 
</p>
<p>(10&nbsp;in 2015).5 While the US numbers are dispro-
</p>
<p>portionately high overall, they also show signifi-
</p>
<p>cant racial bias. Over 24% of the shooting victims 
</p>
<p>in 2016 were black civilians who make up just

<p>What kinds of situations can you think of

<p>that might be especially prone to implicit 
</p>
<p>influences from prejudice?
</p>
<p>Box 11.4 Zooming In: How to Measure Bias 
</p>
<p>in Police Use of Lethal Force
</p>
<p>Earlier, we defined discrimination as any 
</p>
<p>behavior toward category members that is 
</p>
<p>directed toward them solely because they 
</p>
<p>happen to be members of that category. In 
</p>
<p>other words, discrimination consists of 
</p>
<p>behavior that treats members of a group 
</p>
<p>differently than anyone who doesn&rsquo;t belong 
</p>
<p>to that group. Hence, discriminatory behav-
</p>
<p>ior is generally defined in relation to a 
</p>
<p>benchmark alternative: similar behavior 
</p>
<p>directed toward people from other groups.
</p>
<p>In determining whether officers&rsquo; use of 
</p>
<p>lethal force is racially biased, identifying a 
</p>
<p>proper comparison benchmark proves dif-
</p>
<p>ficult. One possibility is to compare inci-
</p>
<p>dent rates for different groups, relative to 
</p>
<p>their proportion in the population. Based 
</p>
<p>on this metric, black civilians face a signifi-
</p>
<p>cantly greater risk of being shot by police 
</p>
<p>than any other group in the United States. 
</p>
<p>For every million black people in the 
</p>
<p>United States, about six to seven are shot 
</p>
<p>every year. This rate is substantially higher 
</p>
<p>than the corresponding rate for whites (less 
</p>
<p>than three per million) or Asians (close to 
</p>
<p>one per million; The Guardian, 2016).

</p>
<p>13% of the US population (27% black victims 
</p>
<p>in 2015).
</p>
<p>The claim that police officers are prejudiced in 
</p>
<p>their use of lethal force is especially disturbing, 
</p>
<p>not solely because of the grave consequences to 
</p>
<p>the victims but also because it has potentially 
</p>
<p>corrosive effects for the perceived legitimacy of 
</p>
<p>law enforcement institutions. Shootings of a 
</p>
<p>minority suspect lead to mistrust among commu-
</p>
<p>nity members and give rise to conflict between 
</p>
<p>the community and police. In fact, blacks in the 
</p>
<p>United States are much less likely as whites to hold 
</p>
<p>positive views of local police. In a representative 
</p>
<p>nationwide sample, only 14% of black respon-
</p>
<p>dents express having a great deal of confidence in 
</p>
<p>their police department, compared to 42% among 
</p>
<p>whites. Only a third of blacks believe police are 
</p>
<p>using the right amount of force, less than half of 
</p>
<p>the response rate for whites (Pew Research 
</p>
<p>Center, 2016b; see also Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 2004). 
</p>
<p>One conceivable risk is that, in response to their 
</p>
<p>mistrust, black people may alter their own behav-
</p>
<p>ior in interactions with police officers, becoming 
</p>
<p>more belligerent, and thereby creating a vicious 
</p>
<p>cycle where this belligerence leads to more 
</p>
<p>severe use of force by police (Reisig, McCluskey, 
</p>
<p>Mastrofski, &amp; Terrill, 2004).
</p>
<p>No doubt, the notion that officers sworn to 
</p>
<p>uphold the law would deliberately prejudice their 
</p>
<p>decisions to shoot a civilian threatens the basic 
</p>
<p>foundations of a democratic society. However, it 
</p>
<p>is helpful to consider the circumstances under 
</p>
<p>which officers have to face decisions about the 
</p>
<p>use of force: in all likelihood, these are situations 
</p>
<p>of significant stress to the officer, who are facing 
</p>
<p>a potential threat to their own life, in uncertain 
</p>
<p>circumstances that can rapidly escalate, requiring 
</p>
<p>an immediate split-second decision, without 
</p>
<p>much opportunity for deliberation. In other 
</p>
<p>words, these are circumstances where the offi-
</p>
<p>cers&rsquo; cognitive resources are taxed, the situation 
</p>
<p>is likely to be ambiguous, and decisions have to 
</p>
<p>be made under serious time pressure&nbsp;&ndash; all factors 
</p>
<p>that facilitate implicit prejudice. While we should 
</p>
<p>expect officers to be motivated to be fair and 
</p>
<p>accurate in their decision, the situation may 
</p>
<p>indeed bias them to make choices the officers do 
</p>
<p>not necessarily intend.
</p>
<p> First-Person-Shooter Task
</p>
<p>Over the past 15&nbsp; years, social psychological 
</p>
<p>research has examined the effect of race on shoot-
</p>
<p>ing decisions using videogame-like simulations. 
</p>
<p>One frequently employed paradigm is the First-
</p>
<p>Person-Shooter Task (FPST; Correll, Park, Judd, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Wittenbrink, 2002). The paradigm presents 
</p>
<p>participants with a series of male targets, either 
</p>
<p>One problem with this metric is that it 
</p>
<p>assumes that all of these groups are equally 
</p>
<p>likely to interact with police officers in ways 
</p>
<p>that could eventually lead to the use of lethal 
</p>
<p>force. This may not be a valid assumption. 
</p>
<p>For example, relative to their proportion in 
</p>
<p>the population, blacks are more likely than 
</p>
<p>whites to be convicted of violent crime. 
</p>
<p>They therefore may face higher base rates 
</p>
<p>for situations where the use of force is at 
</p>
<p>least a possibility. When benchmarking 
</p>
<p>police-involved shooting incidents against 
</p>
<p>estimates of the likelihood to be involved in 
</p>
<p>serious violent offenses, Cesario and col-
</p>
<p>leagues no longer observed racial disparities 
</p>
<p>(Cesario, Johnson, &amp; Terrill, 2018).
</p>
<p>However, a challenge in benchmarking 
</p>
<p>against race-specific base rates for crimi-
</p>
<p>nal behavior is that estimates of such 
</p>
<p>behavior themselves are potentially biased. 
</p>
<p>For example, if police use race to profile 
</p>
<p>potential suspects, arrest and conviction 
</p>
<p>rates no longer provide accurate estimates 
</p>
<p>of actual criminal activity (see Goff, Lloyd, 
</p>
<p>Geller, Raphael, &amp; Glaser, 2016). In fact, 
</p>
<p>when benchmarking against area-specific 
</p>
<p>estimates of criminal activity (i.e., county-
</p>
<p>specific crime rates), racial disparities in 
</p>
<p>police-involved shooting deaths continue to 
</p>
<p>show significant racial bias (Ross, 2015). 
</p>
<p>These analyses show the risk for black 
</p>
<p>civilians in some counties to be up to 20 
</p>
<p>times higher than that for white civilians, 
</p>
<p>controlling for the county&rsquo;s crime rates.

</p>
<p>black or white, holding weapons (i.e., handguns) 
</p>
<p>or innocuous objects (i.e., wallets, cellphones). 
</p>
<p>The task for participants is to shoot armed targets 
</p>
<p>but avoid shooting unarmed targets. Participants 
</p>
<p>are incentivized to make accurate decisions, but 
</p>
<p>they have to do so under time pressure with lim-
</p>
<p>ited opportunity to deliberate whether the target 
</p>
<p>is indeed holding a weapon or something else. 
</p>
<p>The task is designed to capture any implicit influ-
</p>
<p>ences on participants&rsquo; decisions.
</p>
<p>Specifically, the FPST presents a series of back-
</p>
<p>ground scenes and target images over the course of 
</p>
<p>many trials (commonly 80 to 100 trials). On each 
</p>
<p>trial, a random number of background scenes (0&ndash;3) 
</p>
<p>appear in rapid succession, each scene for a ran-
</p>
<p>dom duration (500&ndash;800 milliseconds). Next, a final 
</p>
<p>background appears. This background is then 
</p>
<p>replaced by a target image&nbsp;&ndash; an image of a man 
</p>
<p>embedded in the same background (e.g., an armed 
</p>
<p>white man standing in the scene; see Fig.&nbsp; 11.1, 
</p>
<p>right panel). The resulting effect for participants is 
</p>
<p>that the target seems to &ldquo;pop up&rdquo; in the scene. 
</p>
<p>Participants are instructed to respond as quickly as 
</p>
<p>possible whenever a target appears via pressing one 
</p>
<p>of two keys on a computer keyboard. If the target is 
</p>
<p>armed, the task is to press the key labeled shoot, 
</p>
<p>and if the target is unarmed, to press the key labeled 
</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t shoot. Importantly, across trials, the nature of 
</p>
<p>the target image varies systematically. Half of the 
</p>
<p>targets are armed with a handgun, and half are 
</p>
<p>unarmed and instead carry an innocuous object, 
</p>
<p>like a cellphone or wallet. Within each type of 
</p>
<p>target (armed and unarmed), half of the images 
</p>
<p>depict a black man and half a white man. To 
</p>
<p>introduce time pressure and encourage fast 
</p>
<p>responding, the task imposes a response window, 
</p>
<p>during which the response has to be recorded 
</p>
<p>(between 630 and 850&nbsp; ms). Similar to popular 
</p>
<p>videogames, correct responses earn points, and 
</p>
<p>errors or timeouts result in penalties.
</p>
<p>The results of some 20 FPST studies consis-
</p>
<p>tently show racial bias in both the speed and 
</p>
<p>accuracy with which participants can make their 
</p>
<p>decisions. Participants are faster and more accu-
</p>
<p>rate when shooting an armed black man rather 
</p>
<p>than an armed white man, and faster and more 
</p>
<p>accurate in their decisions to an unarmed white 
</p>
<p>man rather than an unarmed black man (Correll 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2002; Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 
</p>
<p>2007; Correll, Park, Judd, Wittenbrink, Sadler, 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2007; Correll et&nbsp;al., 2015; see Fig.&nbsp;11.2). 
</p>
<p>Conceptually similar effects have been obtained 
</p>
<p>in other labs with varying procedures and for 
</p>
<p>varying ethnicities (Amodio et&nbsp; al., 2004; 
</p>
<p>Greenwald, Oakes, &amp; Hoffman, 2003; Payne, 
</p>
<p>2001; Plant, Peruche, &amp; Butz, 2005; Unkelbach, 
</p>
<p>Forgas, &amp; Denson, 2008). Much of this research 
</p>
<p>has been conducted with college students, but 
</p>
<p>the effect has been replicated with community 
</p>
<p>samples of white and black participants, as well 
</p>
<p>as with police officers (Correll, Park, Judd, 
</p>
<p>Wittenbrink, Sadler, et&nbsp;al., 2007).
</p>
<p>The crucial point of these findings of course is 
</p>
<p>that with just a few additional seconds of time, 
</p>
<p>decisions are made with perfect accuracy. It is the 
</p>
<p>limited time available to fully appreciate and 
</p>
<p>resolve the complexity of the stimulus input and 
</p>
<p>then execute the respective response that gives 
</p>

</p>
<p>rise to erroneous responses. Hence, the effects 
</p>
<p>reflect implicit influences from the early sponta-
</p>
<p>neous activation phase, where information related 
</p>
<p>to the race of the target comes online. To make a 
</p>
<p>correct decision, only the correct detection of the 
</p>
<p>object held by the target matters. Any target-
</p>
<p>related information is in and of itself irrelevant to 
</p>
<p>the decision. But it is difficult to correct for or 
</p>
<p>detect this spontaneous input that is associated 
</p>
<p>with the race of the target.
</p>
<p>Several studies from our lab have explored in 
</p>
<p>greater detail the exact nature of this implicit 
</p>
<p>influence. We have found that it is cultural stereo-
</p>
<p>types associating black people with the concepts 
</p>
<p>of danger and threat that are activated spontane-
</p>
<p>ously. Temporarily increasing (lowering) the 
</p>
<p>accessibility of these stereotypes exacerbates 
</p>
<p>(reduces) racial bias in the FPST (Correll, Park, 
</p>
<p>Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2007).
</p>
<p>Moreover, the spontaneous danger stereotypes 
</p>
<p>activated early in the decision process influence 
</p>
<p>what participants conclude to see in the hands of 
</p>
<p>the target. They are more likely to see a gun in the 
</p>
<p>hands of a black target, while they see something

<p>Box 11.5 Question for Elaboration
</p>
<p>Given the research on racial bias in the 
</p>
<p>FPST, what would you advise police 
</p>
<p>departments do to limit the negative conse-
</p>
<p>quences of implicit prejudice?
</p>
<p>Box 11.6 Zooming In: Perception or 
</p>
<p>Response Execution?
</p>
<p>Spontaneously activated danger stereo-
</p>
<p>types can influence subsequent responses 
</p>
<p>in two principled ways. (1) They can shape 
</p>
<p>the perceiver&rsquo;s perceptions; and (2) they 
</p>
<p>can interfere with a proper execution of the 
</p>
<p>response.
</p>
<p>The latter mechanism suggests that the 
</p>
<p>stereotype has a direct influence on the deci-
</p>
<p>sion, without impacting perception of the 
</p>
<p>critical object. That is, stereotypic associa-
</p>
<p>tions with threat and danger operate as a sep-
</p>
<p>arate input that favor a shoot response, even 
</p>
<p>in circumstances where the object is correctly 
</p>
<p>identified as a non-weapon. In this scenario, 
</p>
<p>object information and stereotype are in con-
</p>
<p>flict and compete with one another for influ-
</p>
<p>ence on the response. As the stereotype comes 
</p>
<p>online rapidly, it may win out when decisions 
</p>
<p>have to be made under time pressure. With 
</p>
<p>additional time, it is possible to reconcile the 
</p>
<p>conflicting input and to recognize that the ste-
</p>
<p>reotype is irrelevant to the decision (Payne, 
</p>
<p>Shimizu, &amp; Jacoby, 2005). Additional time to 
</p>
<p>reach a decision will only improve decision 
</p>
<p>accuracy if it can be used to improve object 
</p>
<p>perception. For example, if the object is visi-
</p>
<p>ble for only a brief moment, additional time 
</p>
<p>to reflect on the decision may not reduce bias 
</p>
<p>(Correll et&nbsp;al., 2015).

</p>
<p>innocuous in the hands of a white target (Correll 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p> Practical Implications
</p>
<p>These findings on racial bias in shooting deci-
</p>
<p>sions help us better understand why police offi-
</p>
<p>cers may be prejudiced in their use of lethal force. 
</p>
<p>Importantly, they point to the possibility that 
</p>
<p>such bias can result from implicit, unintended 
</p>
<p>influences. This form of bias reflects larger soci-
</p>
<p>etal ills that produce and perpetuate cultural ste-
</p>
<p>reotypes of black people as dangerous and 
</p>
<p>threatening. Police officers are exposed to and 
</p>
<p>influenced by these stereotypes much like every-
</p>
<p>one else. While definitely requiring intervention 
</p>
<p>to eliminate the bias, the explanation contrasts 
</p>
<p>starkly with the alternative scenario where police 
</p>
<p>officers willingly target civilians because of their 
</p>
<p>prejudice against people of color.
</p>
<p>In the United States, following a series of 
</p>
<p>police-involved shootings, community unrest, 
</p>
<p>and the emergence of the Black Lives Matter 
</p>
<p>advocacy group, police departments and govern-
</p>
<p>ment agencies across the country are pressured 
</p>
<p>to take action. They have taken notice that racial 
</p>
<p>bias may occur implicitly and are now spending 
</p>
<p>considerable resources on possible fixes. The 
</p>
<p>State of California and the US Department of 
</p>
<p>Justice both independently launched mandatory 
</p>
<p>antibias training programs for officers and for 
</p>
<p>federal agents.
</p>
<p>The concern is no doubt real, and interven-
</p>
<p>tions are sorely needed. However, whether antib-
</p>
<p>ias training programs, which aim to increase 
</p>
<p>awareness of implicit sources of bias, are effective 
</p>
<p>is entirely unknown. To date, there is no credible 
</p>
<p>research available on the long-term consequences 
</p>
<p>of such training interventions. In fact, they may 
</p>
<p>be counterproductive in several ways.
</p>
<p>First, deliberate efforts to avoid racial bias in 
</p>
<p>decisions about the use of force may actually 
</p>
<p>endanger rather than save the lives of black 
</p>
<p>suspects. Several studies have shown that 
</p>
<p>conscious efforts to avoid bias, for example, 
</p>
<p>intentionally trying to respond in an egalitarian 
</p>
<p>fashion, can actually backfire, leading to more 
</p>
<p>bias rather than less (Liberman &amp; F&ouml;rster, 2000; 
</p>
<p>Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne, &amp; Jetten, 1994; 
</p>
<p>Payne, Lambert, &amp; Jacoby, 2002).
</p>
<p>Second, interventions that alter the way officers 
</p>
<p>approach a potentially dangerous situation may 
</p>
<p>endanger the lives of the officers. In a potentially 
</p>
<p>hostile confrontation, officers often experience 
</p>
<p>fear. Fear can be a useful cue in as much as it 
</p>
<p>sensitizes to real threats in the environment. But 
</p>
<p>officers who have been taught about implicit bias 
</p>
<p>and prejudice may attempt to ignore their fear 
</p>
<p>response. As a result, they may end up underesti-
</p>
<p>mating real threats in an effort to avoid the 
</p>
<p>appearance of bias.
</p>
<p>Third, antibias training may have no effect at 
</p>
<p>all. Compared with the other risks, we just noted 
</p>
<p>this liability may seem trivial. But in actuality it 
</p>
<p>may prove to be quite harmful as antibias training 
</p>
<p>ties up significant policy and material resources. 
</p>
<p>For decades, the public has remained largely 
</p>
<p>uninterested in the issue of racial bias in law 
</p>
<p>enforcement. This has finally changed, and 
</p>
<p>government agencies face pressures to intervene 
</p>
<p>and address the problems. But if antibias training 
</p>
<p>has no effect, the political capital and the money 
</p>
<p>spent will be wasted.
</p>
<p>Hence, the most practical implication of exist-
</p>
<p>ing research on implicit prejudice in shooting 
</p>
<p>decisions ought to be that we need further 
</p>
<p>research on possible intervention strategies and 
</p>
<p>their formal evaluation.
</p>
<p> Important Caveats
</p>
<p>We have illustrated how implicit prejudice can be 
</p>
<p>a useful construct to better understand why police 
</p>
<p>officers are biased in their use of lethal force. 
</p>
<p>However, it is important to recognize that not all 
</p>
<p>bias is implicit, nor is all bias necessarily 
</p>
<p>psychological in origin. Implicit prejudice is only 
</p>
<p>one of possibly many factors that help explain 
</p>
<p>this complex issue.
</p>
<p>First, not all officer actions necessarily reflect 
</p>
<p>implicit influences. To the contrary, several of the 
</p>
<p>recent shootings that received public attention 
</p>
<p>B. Wittenbrink et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>173
</p>
<p>appeared to follow from deliberate acts on the 
</p>
<p>side of the officer. In the case of Walter Scott, for 
</p>
<p>example, who was killed in 2015&nbsp; in North 
</p>
<p>Charleston, SC, officer Michael Slager fired 
</p>
<p>several shots from behind the victim. Scott was 
</p>
<p>not threatening the officer, nor was he armed. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, Slager must have known the victim was 
</p>
<p>unarmed because, immediately after the fateful 
</p>
<p>shots, video footage shows the officer walking 
</p>
<p>over to Scott and planting a weapon in an appar-
</p>
<p>ent effort to justify his own actions.6
</p>
<p>Second, although officers make individual 
</p>
<p>choices and are held accountable for those 
</p>
<p>choices, their actions are also influenced by insti-
</p>
<p>tutional, structural factors that have little to do 
</p>
<p>with the individual officer and his or her prefer-
</p>
<p>ences and attitudes. For example, municipalities 
</p>
<p>rely to a good extent on revenues from citations 
</p>
<p>for traffic violations and similar minor legal trans-
</p>
<p>gressions. The effectiveness of police work is 
</p>
<p>measured by statistics that capture crime and 
</p>
<p>arrest rates. A city&rsquo;s revenue needs and arrest rates 
</p>
<p>ultimately impact officer incentives&nbsp; &ndash; either 
</p>
<p>implicitly through informal directives or patrol 
</p>
<p>assignments or explicitly through formal quotas. 
</p>
<p>These incentives, in turn, influence what kinds of 
</p>
<p>interactions officers have with the community. 
</p>
<p>Aggressive ticketing and arrest quotas are unlikely

</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Prejudice is a negative predisposition 
</p>
<p>toward a social group and its members. 
</p>
<p>It represents an attitude, evaluation, and 
</p>
<p>inclination to act in a particular way. 
</p>
<p>Those acts can reflect deliberate choices 
</p>
<p>to discriminate.
</p>
<p>&bull; However, for well-established, over-
</p>
<p>learned attitudes, evaluations and related 
</p>
<p>group stereotypes may be triggered 
</p>
<p>automatically, without intent, effort, or 
</p>
<p>conscious awareness. They may influ-
</p>
<p>ence judgment and behavior implicitly, 
</p>
<p>without any intent to discriminate or 
</p>
<p>treat members of one group different 
</p>
<p>from those of another group.
</p>
<p>&bull; Factors that promote implicit influences 
</p>
<p>are:
</p>
<p> &ndash; Inadequate time to deliberate one&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>actions
</p>
<p> &ndash; Limited cognitive resources because 
</p>
<p>of fatigue or distraction
</p>
<p> &ndash; The ambiguity of the situation
</p>
<p> &ndash; Lack of motivation to act in a careful 
</p>
<p>and accurate manner
</p>
<p>&bull; Police officers sometimes have to make 
</p>
<p>important decisions about the use of 
</p>
<p>lethal force under circumstances that 
</p>
<p>increase the risk of implicit influences: 
</p>
<p>these decisions can be split-second deci-
</p>
<p>sions, made in a highly stressful situa-
</p>
<p>tion with considerable uncertainty.
</p>
<p>&bull; Laboratory simulations of such deci-
</p>
<p>sions show clear evidence of implicit 
</p>
<p>bias from negative racial stereotypes that 
</p>
<p>associate black people with danger: par-
</p>
<p>ticipants are faster and more accurate 
</p>
<p>when shooting an armed black man 
</p>
<p>rather than an armed white man, and 
</p>
<p>faster and more accurate in their deci-
</p>
<p>sions to an unarmed white man rather 
</p>
<p>than an unarmed black man.

<p>prejudiced group attitudes on judgment and 
</p>
<p>behavior that are unintended. Our judgment of 
</p>
<p>another person may be shaped by her/his gen-
</p>
<p>der, without us trying to take gender into 
</p>
<p>account or even knowing that gender played 
</p>
<p>any role in our decision. By contrast, preju-
</p>
<p>dice can have entirely explicit effects, for 
</p>
<p>example, judgments that we make with delib-
</p>
<p>erate consideration of our group attitudes.
</p>
<p> 2. Q2 (with Box 11.3): What kinds of situations 
</p>
<p>can you think of that might be especially 
</p>
<p>prone to implicit influences from prejudice?
</p>
<p>A2: Any situation where people have limited 
</p>
<p>motivation and/or opportunity to reflect upon 
</p>
<p>their reactions. Many aspects of human inter-
</p>
<p>action happen mindlessly where people don&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>spend much effort to reflect on or regulate their 
</p>
<p>behavior&nbsp; &ndash; like the quick exchange with the 
</p>
<p>clerk at the coffee shop. In other situations, 
</p>
<p>people may be motivated to make correct judg-
</p>
<p>ments and act in a proper fashion. Yet, the situ-
</p>
<p>ation is such that the opportunity for reflection 
</p>
<p>and deliberation is missing. For example, peo-
</p>
<p>ple may lack awareness of aspects of their non-
</p>
<p>verbal communication, precluding them to 
</p>
<p>reflect and possibly correct what is being com-
</p>
<p>municated. Likewise, the circumstances of the 
</p>
<p>situation itself may curtail people&rsquo;s opportu-
</p>
<p>nity to deliberate their judgments and actions. 
</p>
<p>When they are busy, stressed, and make deci-
</p>
<p>sions under time pressure, people are more 
</p>
<p>prone to show implicit bias. An overworked 
</p>
<p>physician at a nightshift at the ER will face 
</p>
<p>greater risk in this regard than the doctor who 
</p>
<p>provides written consultation on the case, 
</p>
<p>following a detailed review.
</p>
<p> 3. Q3 (with Box 11.5): Given the research on 
</p>
<p>racial bias in the FPST, what would you advise 
</p>
<p>police departments do to limit the negative 
</p>
<p>consequences of implicit prejudice?
</p>
<p>A3: This is a trick question. To date, existing 
</p>
<p>research on the effect of race on shooting 
</p>
<p>decisions does not speak to the issue of inter-
</p>
<p>vention. The research does make the case that 
</p>
<p>implicit influences can possibly impact offi-
</p>
<p>cer decision-making. It identifies a potential 
</p>
<p>source for bias, one that is quite different 
</p>
<p>from the alternative, where officers are delib-
</p>
<p>erately prejudiced. As such, the research sug-
</p>
<p>gests additional opportunities for intervention. 
</p>
<p>But what those interventions are, and whether 
</p>
<p>they are effective relative to alternative 
</p>
<p>options available in the field cannot be 
</p>
<p>answered by the research to date. In fact, few 
</p>
<p>studies have explicitly investigated strategies 
</p>
<p>to mitigate shooter bias. It is unknown how 
</p>
<p>any such effects in the laboratory might trans-
</p>
<p>fer to the real world.
</p>
<p>This is an important lesson for how to prop-
</p>
<p>erly apply scientific theory and laboratory 
</p>
<p>research findings to real-world problems. The 
</p>
<p>laboratory helps us to more fully understand 
</p>
<p>the real world. But to fix a problem and change 
</p>
<p>the world, additional research is generally 
</p>
<p>required that translates predictions and findings 
</p>
<p>to the specifics of a real situation. For this rea-
</p>
<p>son, medical interventions undergo elaborate 
</p>
<p>field tests before they receive certification.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>When Roger Federer says &ldquo;I believe that I can still 
</p>
<p>improve my game&rdquo; (Hudson, 2014), this feels 
</p>
<p>impressive but also somewhat odd; how can some-
</p>
<p>body with his achievements (at the time, aged 33, 
</p>
<p>he had already won 17 Grand Slam tournaments, 
</p>
<p>more than any other male player in the world) still 
</p>
<p>believe that he can improve? Could such an 
</p>
<p>extraordinary confidence in his ability to learn and 
</p>
<p>to improve himself be part of his unmatched suc-
</p>
<p>cess as Grand Slam winner? Rodger Federer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>quote illustrates what Carol S.&nbsp; Dweck called a 
</p>
<p>growth mindset.1 It involves the passion for learn-
</p>
<p>ing, growth, and constant self-improvement and 
</p>
<p>makes people capable of overcoming challenges 
</p>
<p>and setbacks through endurance and the invest-
</p>
<p>ment of effort. It&rsquo;s counterpart, the so-called fixed 
</p>
<p>mindset, is characterized by the belief that one&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>competencies and talents (like intelligence or cre-
</p>
<p>ativity) are carved in stone and basically unchange-
</p>
<p>able. According to Mindset Theory, people with a 
</p>
<p>fixed mindset, as compared to a growth mindset, 
</p>
<p>are more interested in proving and validating 
</p>
<p>themselves than in actual improvement and, hence, 
</p>
<p>more vulnerable to get discouraged by mistakes 
</p>
<p>and setbacks.
</p>
<p>1 The use of the term &ldquo;mindset&rdquo; here is different from that 
</p>
<p>used in the Mindset Theory of Action Phases (cf. Keller, 
</p>
<p>Bieleke, &amp; Gollwitzer, Chap. 2).</p>

</p>
<p>The development of Mindset Theory originally 
</p>
<p>began in the 1970s when Carol S.&nbsp;Dweck in her 
</p>
<p>studies observed that children reacted very differ-
</p>
<p>ently to challenges and setbacks (Dweck, 2012a). 
</p>
<p>While some children were easily unsettled by dif-
</p>
<p>ficulties and desperately tried to avoid them, others 
</p>
<p>liked challenges and were even actively seeking 
</p>
<p>them. Being intrigued by this observation and 
</p>
<p>searching for an explanation, the idea of &ldquo;implicit 
</p>
<p>theories&rdquo; was born when she and her colleague 
</p>
<p>Mary Bandura figured that the meaning of failure 
</p>
<p>was dependent on children&rsquo;s view of ability as 
</p>
<p>something deep-seated and permanent or some-
</p>
<p>thing they can develop. This insight built the start-
</p>
<p>ing point of an extensive research program in 
</p>
<p>which Dweck, together with her colleagues and 
</p>
<p>students, explored the origins and consequences of 
</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s implicit theories in a variety of domains, 
</p>
<p>such as academic and occupational achievement, 
</p>
<p>health, or interpersonal relationships (Burnette, 
</p>
<p>2010; Dweck, 1999, 2012a, 2012b; Molden &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dweck, 2006; Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011; for meta-
</p>
<p>analyses see Burnette, O&rsquo;Boyle, VanEpps, Pollack, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Finkel, 2013; Sisk, Burgoyne, Sun, Butler, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Macnamara, 2019). In this chapter, we will first 
</p>
<p>describe Mindset Theory and its underlying mech-
</p>
<p>anisms in the intellectual-achievement domain and 
</p>
<p>interpersonal domain before we turn to an applica-
</p>
<p>tion of Mindset Theory in the context of interper-
</p>
<p>sonal aggression.
</p>
<p> Incremental Versus Entity Theories
</p>
<p>People hold implicit theories about different per-
</p>
<p>sonal attributes such as intelligence, personality, 
</p>
<p>moral character, willpower, or body weight 
</p>
<p>(Burnette, 2010; Chiu, Dweck, Tong, &amp; Fu, 1997; 
</p>
<p>Dweck, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 1995; Hong, Chiu, 
</p>
<p>Dweck, Lin, &amp; Wan, 1999). In any case, an entity 
</p>
<p>theory is marked by the idea that the attribute in 
</p>
<p>question cannot willingly be changed, whereas 
</p>
<p>an incremental theory is marked by the idea that 
</p>
<p>it can be changed with effort (for an exception 
</p>
<p>see Box 12.1). Importantly, these beliefs are 
</p>
<p>about the potential to change not about the actual 
</p>
<p>likelihood of change to occur (Yeager, 
</p>
<p>Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013). That is, people 
</p>
<p>can believe that personality can be changed, 
</p>
<p>while they do not necessarily think that many 
</p>
<p>people do change. It is further important to note 
</p>
<p>that people&rsquo;s implicit theories are not necessarily 
</p>
<p>the same for different attributes. The same person 
</p>
<p>might believe that people can grow their intelli-
</p>
<p>gence quite substantially but that personality is a 
</p>
<p>relatively fixed entity. This example implies 
</p>
<p>another important feature of implicit theories, 
</p>
<p>namely, that the agreement with an entity versus 
</p>
<p>incremental theory is continuous. Research sug-
</p>
<p>gests that about 40% of people clearly endorse 
</p>
<p>either a fixed or a growth mindset. But about 20% 
</p>
<p>of people cannot be categorized into either group 
</p>
<p>(Dweck, 2012a). So keep in mind that when we 
</p>
<p>talk of people holding an entity or incremental 
</p>
<p>theory, this is a simplification, which we use to 
</p>
<p>explain findings in a comprehensible way.
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Mindsets (or implicit theories) are peo-
</p>
<p>ple&rsquo;s lay beliefs about the nature of human 
</p>
<p>attributes, such as intelligence or 
</p>
<p>personality.
</p>
<p>Fixed mindset (or entity theory) is the 
</p>
<p>belief that human attributes, such as intel-
</p>
<p>ligence or personality, are fixed and cannot 
</p>
<p>be changed.
</p>
<p>Growth mindset (or incremental theory) 
</p>
<p>is the belief that human attributes, such as 
</p>
<p>intelligence or personality, are malleable 
</p>
<p>and can be changed substantially.
</p>
<p>Box 12.1 Zooming In: Implicit Theories 
</p>
<p>About Willpower
</p>
<p>While most implicit theories deal with the 
</p>
<p>question of malleability of human attri-
</p>
<p>butes, implicit theories about willpower 
</p>
<p>deal with the question whether people 
</p>
<p>believe that willpower is limited versus 
</p>
<p>nonlimited (Job, Dweck, &amp; Walton, 2010).

</p>
<p> Measurement of&nbsp;Implicit Theories
</p>
<p>Usually, people are unaware of the beliefs they 
</p>
<p>hold, which is why these beliefs are referred to as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;implicit.&rdquo; Still, when being asked about what 
</p>
<p>they think, whether human attributes can change 
</p>
<p>or not, people can easily respond to this question. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, implicit theories are measured via 
</p>
<p>self-report (rather than with implicit measures 
</p>
<p>such as reaction time paradigms). In accordance 
</p>
<p>with their field of interest, researchers have 
</p>
<p>developed scales to assess implicit theories with 
</p>
<p>regard to different personal attributes. Table&nbsp;12.1 
</p>
<p>shows example items for an entity and an incre-
</p>
<p>mental theory regarding four attributes, namely, 
</p>
<p>intelligence, personality, moral character, and 
</p>
<p>groups. These are by far not the only attributes 
</p>
<p>implicit theories have been studied of, but all of 
</p>
<p>them deal with the question of malleability (see 
</p>
<p>Box 12.1 for an exception).
</p>
<p> Stability of&nbsp;Implicit Theories
</p>
<p>You might wonder whether people&rsquo;s agreement 
</p>
<p>with an entity versus incremental theory changes 
</p>
<p>over time or can even be changed intentionally as 
</p>
<p>part of an intervention. The answer is twofold. 
</p>
<p>On the one hand, longitudinal studies usually find 
</p>
<p>implicit theories to be relatively stable over time, 
</p>
<p>almost similar to a personality trait (e.g., Robins &amp; 
</p>
<p>Pals, 2002). On the other hand, experimental 
</p>
<p>Table 12.1 Example items for measuring implicit 
theories
</p>
<p>Attribute Example items
</p>
<p>Intelligence You have a certain amount of 
</p>
<p>intelligence, and you can&rsquo;t really do 
</p>
<p>much to change it.
</p>
<p>No matter how much intelligence you 
</p>
<p>have, you can always change it quite a 
</p>
<p>bit. (Reversed coded)
</p>
<p>Personality Everyone is a certain kind of person, 
</p>
<p>and there is not much they can do to 
</p>
<p>really change that.
</p>
<p>All people can change their most basic 
</p>
<p>qualities. (Reversed coded)
</p>
<p>Moral 
</p>
<p>character
</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s moral character is 
</p>
<p>something very basic about them, and 
</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be changed much.
</p>
<p>Groups Groups can&rsquo;t really change their basic 
</p>
<p>characteristics.
</p>
<p>Note. Participants usually rate their agreement with each 
</p>
<p>statement on a 6-point Likert-type scale (1&nbsp; =&nbsp; strongly 
</p>

<p>capacity to alter their behavior, thoughts, 
</p>
<p>and emotions in order to bring them into 
</p>
<p>line with their own long-term goals or some 
</p>
<p>external standard such as social expecta-
</p>
<p>tions (e.g., Baumeister, 2002; Carver &amp; 
</p>
<p>Scheier, 1982; Metcalfe &amp; Mischel, 1999; 
</p>
<p>see also Gieseler, Loschelder, &amp; Friese, 
</p>
<p>Chap. 1). Some people believe that this 
</p>
<p>capacity resembles a limited resource that 
</p>
<p>gets depleted whenever used (limited- 
</p>
<p>resource theory). Other people, however, 
</p>
<p>reject this view and rather believe that using 
</p>
<p>their willpower can even activate their men-
</p>
<p>tal stamina and prepare them for upcoming 
</p>
<p>challenges (nonlimited-resource theory). In 
</p>
<p>multiple laboratory studies, Job et&nbsp;al. (2010) 
</p>
<p>found that only people with a limited-
</p>
<p>resource theory show declines in self- 
</p>
<p>control performance given a previous 
</p>
<p>self- control task (also known as ego-deple-
</p>
<p>tion effect), while people with a nonlimited- 
</p>
<p>resource theory remained a high level of 
</p>
<p>self- control performance. Field studies also 
</p>
<p>linked willpower theories to self-control in 
</p>
<p>everyday life. During the final examination 
</p>
<p>period, when self-control is most important, 
</p>
<p>students with a limited-resource theory pro-
</p>
<p>crastinate more, eat less healthy, and even 
</p>
<p>earn lower grades compared to their fellow 
</p>
<p>students with a nonlimited- resource theory 
</p>
<p>(Job, Bernecker, Walton, &amp; Dweck, 2015; 
</p>
<p>Job et&nbsp;al., 2010).

</p>
<p>studies demonstrate that there are ways to change 
</p>
<p>implicit theories for shorter and longer periods of 
</p>
<p>time, depending on the intensity of the methods 
</p>
<p>used. For instance, a mindset can be shortly induced 
</p>
<p>by providing people with &ldquo;scientific information&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>that supports one of the theories or they can be 
</p>
<p>changed over periods of several weeks by means of 
</p>
<p>an extensive workshop (Blackwell, Trzesniewski, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Dweck, 2007; Good, Aronson, &amp; Inzlicht, 
</p>
<p>2003; Yeager, Trzesniewski, et&nbsp; al., 2013). We 
</p>
<p>will introduce one example of a successful long-
</p>
<p>term intervention later in this chapter when we 
</p>
<p>talk about the application of Mindset Theory.
</p>
<p> Origins of&nbsp;Implicit Theories
</p>
<p>So far, only a limited amount of research has 
</p>
<p>addressed the question where implicit theories 
</p>
<p>come from. Some studies examined the influence 
</p>
<p>of parenting practices on children&rsquo;s implicit theo-
</p>
<p>ries about intelligence. Early research found that 
</p>
<p>praising children for their abilities rather than for 
</p>
<p>their effort leads children to adopt an entity theory 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998). More recent 
</p>
<p>research extended these findings and found that 
</p>
<p>parents&rsquo; view of failures affect their children&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>implicit theories via different parenting practices 
</p>
<p>(Haimovitz &amp; Dweck, 2016). Parents who believe 
</p>
<p>failure is enhancing (instead of debilitating) are 
</p>
<p>more likely to raise children who believe that 
</p>
<p>intelligence can be changed.
</p>
<p>This research suggests that implicit theories 
</p>
<p>are developed early in life (e.g., Haimovitz &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dweck, 2016 studied fourth to fifth graders). 
</p>
<p>However, recent research suggests that they can 
</p>
<p>also change later in life. For instance, research 
</p>
<p>focusing on implicit theories about willpower 
</p>
<p>(see Box 12.1) examined change in willpower 
</p>
<p>theories in college students over the course of one 
</p>
<p>semester. Two studies showed that when students 
</p>
<p>pursued personal goals for intrinsic reasons (e.g., 
</p>
<p>out of personal interest) rather than for extrinsic 
</p>
<p>reasons (e.g., to please others), their belief in 
</p>
<p>nonlimited willpower increased (Sieber, 
</p>
<p>Fl&uuml;ckiger, Mata, Bernecker, &amp; Job, 2019). The 
</p>
<p>bottom line of this research is that implicit theo-
</p>
<p>ries are at least to some extend &ldquo;construed&rdquo; from 
</p>
<p>the experiences people make&mdash;a process that 
</p>
<p>probably continues over the course of one&rsquo;s life.
</p>
<p> Mechanisms: Implicit Theories Work 
in&nbsp;Meaning Systems
</p>
<p>A considerable amount of research has been ded-
</p>
<p>icated to the mechanisms underlying the effects 
</p>
<p>of implicit theories. This work has shown that 
</p>
<p>implicit theories work in so-called meaning sys-
</p>
<p>tems (Hong et&nbsp; al., 1999; Molden &amp; Dweck, 
</p>
<p>2006). That is, people formulate theory- consistent 
</p>
<p>goals, and interpret the effort experienced and 
</p>
<p>outcomes of their actions in line with their 
</p>
<p>implicit theories. Further, based on their theories, 
</p>
<p>they pursue different strategies to overcome dif-
</p>
<p>ficulties. Together people&rsquo;s goals, effort beliefs, 
</p>
<p>attributions, and strategies build a coherent sys-
</p>
<p>tem that allows a person to make sense of the 
</p>
<p>world and make predictions based on this under-
</p>
<p>standing. In the following, we are going to intro-
</p>
<p>duce the four mechanisms that underlie the 
</p>
<p>effects of implicit theories within the achieve-
</p>
<p>ment and interpersonal domain (i.e., goals, effort 
</p>
<p>beliefs, attributions, and strategies).
</p>
<p> Learning and&nbsp;Performance Goals
</p>
<p>Implicit theories determine what kind of goals 
</p>
<p>people set in achievement situations. People who 
</p>
<p>believe that their attributes are malleable and open 
</p>
<p>to change set so-called learning goals that are 
</p>
<p>directed at the development of their abilities. 
</p>
<p>People who believe that their attributes are fixed 
</p>
<p>are on the other hand concerned with validating 
</p>
<p>their level of ability. Accordingly, they tend to pur-
</p>
<p>sue so-called performance goals2 (e.g., Robins &amp; 
</p>
<p>2 Performance goals are sometimes defined as competitive 
</p>
<p>goals (wanting to outdo others) or as simply seeking suc-
</p>
<p>cessful outcomes (such as high grades). However, research 
</p>
<p>shows that these other goals do not create the same vulner-
</p>
<p>abilities as the goal of validating ability (e.g., Grant &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dweck, 2003). Throughout this chapter we use the term per-
</p>
<p>formance goals to refer to the goal of validating ability.

</p>
<p>Pals, 2002). The goals individuals strive for in turn 
</p>
<p>shape their cognitions, affect, and behavior and 
</p>
<p>can thereby lead to different learning outcomes 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988; Elliott &amp; Dweck, 
</p>
<p>1988). For instance, one study used electroenceph-
</p>
<p>alography (EEG) to monitor brain activity associ-
</p>
<p>ated with students&rsquo; attention to feedback while 
</p>
<p>taking a challenging test (Mangels, Butterfield, 
</p>
<p>Lamb, Good, &amp; Dweck, 2006). Results showed 
</p>
<p>that both entity and incremental theorists eagerly 
</p>
<p>attended ability-relevant feedback about whether 
</p>
<p>their answer to an item was correct or incorrect. 
</p>
<p>However, compared to incremental theorists, 
</p>
<p>entity theorists were less interested in learning-
</p>
<p>relevant information about what the correct answer 
</p>
<p>was (Mangels et&nbsp;al., 2006, see also Dweck, Good, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Mangels, 2004). Once their performance goals 
</p>
<p>had been met by processing the ability-relevant 
</p>
<p>feedback about whether their answer was correct 
</p>
<p>or not, entity theorists felt no need to attent to the 
</p>
<p>learning- relevant information (Mangels et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2006). Other studies have suggested that learning 
</p>
<p>goals are related to the use of more effective strate-
</p>
<p>gies in the face of difficulties (e.g., Elliott &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dweck, 1988), &ldquo;deep&rdquo; learning strategies to 
</p>
<p>approach difficult course material (e.g., Grant &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dweck, 2003), and better performance in chal-
</p>
<p>lenging tasks (e.g., Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998). 
</p>
<p>Overall, research suggest that implicit theories 
</p>
<p>generate different concerns of either developing 
</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s ability or to proof that one possesses a cer-
</p>
<p>tain level of ability.
</p>
<p>Importantly, goals are not only an important 
</p>
<p>mechanism in the intellectual-achievement 
</p>
<p>domain but also in the domain of interpersonal 
</p>
<p>relationships. Rudolph (2010), for instance, 
</p>
<p>showed that implicit theories about peer relation-
</p>
<p>ships (whether they are fixed or can be improved 
</p>
<p>with effort) predict the types of goals people set 
</p>
<p>in social situations. Students holding an entity 
</p>
<p>theory were more likely to set performance- 
</p>
<p>oriented social goals (which are concerned with 
</p>
<p>minimizing the risk for social failure or negative 
</p>
<p>social judgment) rather than mastery-oriented 
</p>
<p>social goals (which involve learning and devel-
</p>
<p>oping relationships; Rudolph, 2010).
</p>
<p> Effort Beliefs
</p>
<p>Implicit theories in the achievement-intellectual 
</p>
<p>domain are related to people&rsquo;s beliefs about 
</p>
<p>effort. Many motivational theories are based on 
</p>
<p>the basic assumption that effort is aversive and 
</p>
<p>people only engage in effortful activities if they 
</p>
<p>regard it as being worthwhile, for instance, if 
</p>
<p>they can achieve a valued outcome (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Kurzban, Duckworth, Kable, &amp; Myers, 2013; 
</p>
<p>Rollett, 1987; Wright, 1996). In line with this 
</p>
<p>theorizing, research on implicit theories demon-
</p>
<p>strates that the beliefs people hold about the mal-
</p>
<p>leability of intelligence changes the meaning of 
</p>
<p>effort. People endorsing an incremental theory 
</p>
<p>regard effort as necessary and worthwhile for 
</p>
<p>change. As a result they embrace situations that 
</p>
<p>yield a challenge to their abilities&mdash;they know 
</p>
<p>that change will not come easy and that they 
</p>
<p>have to invest effort to grow. The meaning of 
</p>
<p>effort differs when seen through the lens of an 
</p>
<p>entity theory: If a person has to invest high effort 
</p>
<p>to accomplish a task this implies a lack of ability 
</p>
<p>or at least an insufficiency and there is nothing to 
</p>
<p>be done about it. Thus, an entity theory gives a 
</p>
<p>negative spin to the experience of effort and, as a 
</p>
<p>result, drives people away from challenging situ-
</p>
<p>ations (e.g., Blackwell et&nbsp; al., 2007; Dweck &amp; 
</p>
<p>Leggett, 1988; Hong et&nbsp;al., 1999). To our knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, effort beliefs have so far not been studied 
</p>
<p>as mechanism driving outcomes within the inter-
</p>
<p>personal domain.

</p>
<p> Attributions
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, implicit theories affect how 
</p>
<p>people make sense of challenges such as setbacks 
</p>
<p>or failure. An entity theory drives people to attri-
</p>
<p>bute failure to what they believe are stable char-
</p>
<p>acteristics such as ability or traits. In contrast, an 
</p>
<p>incremental theory leads people to attribute fail-
</p>
<p>ures and setbacks to malleable entities such as 
</p>
<p>effort, motivation, or aspects of the situation. 
</p>
<p>Research shows that these differences in attribu-
</p>
<p>tions explain why implicit theories predict differ-
</p>
<p>ent affective and behavioral responses to failures 
</p>
<p>and negative feedback. For instance, Hong et&nbsp;al. 
</p>
<p>(1999) showed that when students received nega-
</p>
<p>tive performance feedback, they tended to attri-
</p>
<p>bute it to a lack of effort if they endorsed an 
</p>
<p>incremental theory about intelligence (both when 
</p>
<p>measured and manipulated). Accordingly, they 
</p>
<p>took remedial action. In contrast, students with 
</p>
<p>an entity theory attributed the feedback to a lack 
</p>
<p>of ability and were less likely to take action to 
</p>
<p>elevate their performance (Hong et&nbsp;al., 1999).
</p>
<p>Attributions also play an important role in 
</p>
<p>individuals&rsquo; reactions to social challenges, such 
</p>
<p>as social exclusion or intergroup conflicts (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Halperin &amp; Bar-Tal, 2011; Yeager, Miu, Powers, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Dweck, 2013). Studies showed that entity the-
</p>
<p>orists tend to attribute other&rsquo;s behavior to their 
</p>
<p>personality (e.g., &ldquo;She behaved like that because 
</p>
<p>she is a bad person&rdquo;), while incremental theorists 
</p>
<p>tend to make more situational attributions (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;She behaved like that because she was in a 
</p>
<p>rush&rdquo;). These differences in attributions trig-
</p>
<p>gered by implicit theories lead to differences in 
</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s emotional (e.g., anger, hatred) and 
</p>
<p>behavioral (e.g., revenge seeking) reactions to 
</p>
<p>socially adverse situations.
</p>
<p> Mastery-Oriented and&nbsp;Helpless 
Strategies
</p>
<p>Implicit theories also predict how people respond 
</p>
<p>to challenges: people with an incremental theory 
</p>
<p>are persistent and invest effort to master 
</p>
<p> challenges and overcome setbacks&mdash;they use 
</p>
<p> so- called mastery-oriented strategies. In con-
</p>
<p>trast, people with an entity theory become easily 
</p>
<p>discouraged by setbacks and react with helpless 
</p>
<p>or defensive strategies (Blackwell et&nbsp; al., 2007; 
</p>
<p>Hong et&nbsp;al., 1999; Robins &amp; Pals, 2002). If peo-
</p>
<p>ple believe that their abilities are fixed, setbacks 
</p>
<p>mean that they lack certain ability. As a result 
</p>
<p>they are less willing to invest effort in overcom-
</p>
<p>ing the situation and try to avoid challenges. If 
</p>
<p>people believe that they can grow their abilities, 
</p>
<p>setbacks are interpreted as opportunities to learn 
</p>
<p>rather than in terms of personal insufficiency. 
</p>
<p>The idea of growth takes away negative feelings 
</p>
<p>toward the self to dwell about and replaces them 
</p>
<p>with a &ldquo;readiness to act.&rdquo; A longitudinal field 
</p>
<p>study traced 500 college students over the course 
</p>
<p>of their 4 years of college and found that stu-
</p>
<p>dents with an entity theory were more likely to 
</p>
<p>report helpless-strategies (e.g., &ldquo;When I fail to 
</p>
<p>understand something, I become discouraged to 
</p>
<p>the point of wanting to give up.&rdquo;), while students 
</p>
<p>with an incremental theory were more likely to 
</p>
<p>report mastery-oriented strategies (e.g., &ldquo;When 
</p>
<p>something I am studying is difficult, I try 
</p>
<p>harder.&rdquo;; Robins &amp; Pals, 2002). Further, entity 
</p>
<p>theorists showed a drop in self-esteem over the 
</p>
<p>course of their college years, speaking to the 
</p>
<p>negative implications for the self that are associ-
</p>
<p>ated with challenges and setbacks for these stu-
</p>
<p>dents (Robins &amp; Pals, 2002). Other studies in the 
</p>
<p>laboratory found that students with an (induced) 
</p>
<p>entity theory engage in strategies that preserve 
</p>
<p>their self-worth. For instance, they choose to 
</p>
<p>review the work of others doing more poorly 
</p>
<p>than themselves rather than learning from those 
</p>
<p>doing better than themselves (Nussbaum &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dweck, 2008). They are also more likely to con-
</p>
<p>sider lying or cheating in order to look better 
</p>
<p>(Blackwell et&nbsp; al., 2007; Mueller &amp; Dweck, 
</p>
<p>1998).
</p>
<p>In the interpersonal domain, research has 
</p>
<p>studied how implicit theories shape how people 
</p>
<p>respond to experiences of social adversity or fail-
</p>
<p>ure. For instance, when being victimized by their 
</p>
<p>peers, students holding an entity theory about 
</p>
<p>personality tend to react with desire for ven-
</p>
<p>geance and aggression. In contrast, students 
</p>
<p>holding an incremental theory choose a more 
</p>
<p>resilient-prosocial response. For example, they 
</p>
<p>tried to be &ldquo;cool&rdquo; about an incidence of victim-
</p>
<p>ization and wanted to educate their transgressor

<p>(Rudolph, 2010; Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2012; Yeager, 
</p>
<p>Trzesniewski, et&nbsp;al., 2013).
</p>
<p>To sum up, implicit theories work in meaning 
</p>
<p>systems and have motivational, emotional, and 
</p>
<p>behavioral consequences on different levels. The 
</p>
<p>two major domains&mdash;achievement and interper-
</p>
<p>sonal&mdash;in which implicit theories have been stud-
</p>
<p>ied largely align in the mechanisms that have 
</p>
<p>been observed. Table&nbsp;12.2 summarizes the main 
</p>
<p>mechanisms studied for both domains. In both 
</p>
<p>domains implicit theories are associated with dif-
</p>
<p>ferent goals people set, they shape how adversity 
</p>
<p>is interpreted, and which strategies people choose 
</p>
<p>to deal with these adversities. Effort beliefs have 
</p>
<p>been studied in the achievement domain only, 
</p>
<p>although one could also imagine that people eval-
</p>
<p>uate effort they experience within their relation-
</p>
<p>ships differently, if they endorse an entity versus 
</p>
<p>incremental theory.
</p>
<p> Application of&nbsp;Mindset Theory 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Context of&nbsp;Interpersonal 
Aggression
</p>
<p>In the previous sections, we have described the 
</p>
<p>basic tenets of Mindset Theory. It proposes that 
</p>
<p>people differ in their beliefs about the malleabil-
</p>
<p>ity of human attributes, such as intelligence and 
</p>
<p>personality. We described research showing how 
</p>
<p>these basic assumptions affect key outcomes in 
</p>
<p>the intellectual-achievement domain and the 
</p>
<p>interpersonal domain. In this last section of the 
</p>
<p>chapter, we want to describe an intervention 
</p>
<p>study that applied Mindset Theory to tackle the 
</p>
<p>problem of bullying, which is present in schools 
</p>
<p>(and workplaces) around the world. In a repre-
</p>
<p>sentative sample of N&nbsp;=&nbsp;15.686 US students from 
</p>
<p>sixth to tenth grade, 30% reported moderate to 
</p>
<p>frequent involvement in bullying. Either they bul-
</p>
<p>lied themselves or they had been bullied (Nansel 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2001). Further, research shows that stu-
</p>
<p>dents who are victimized by their peers suffer in 
</p>
<p>terms of psychological adjustment (e.g., depres-
</p>
<p>sion, loneliness) and they are at higher risk of 
</p>
<p>suicidality (e.g., Klomek, Marrocco, Kleinman, 
</p>
<p>Schonfeld, &amp; Gould, 2007; Nansel et&nbsp;al., 2001; 
</p>
<p>Rudolph, 2010). These findings call for the inves-
</p>
<p>tigation of ways to reduce the prevalence of bul-
</p>
<p>lying and to help students cope with victimization 
</p>
<p>by their peers.
</p>
<p>Research suggests that applying Mindset 
</p>
<p>Theory in this context might serve both purposes. 
</p>
<p>Studies show that students&rsquo; implicit theories 
</p>
<p>about personality shape their emotional and

<p>Box 12.3 Question for Elaboration
</p>
<p>Why are implicit theories often referred to 
</p>
<p>as working in a &ldquo;meaning system,&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>what does the term describe?
Definition Box
</p>
<p>Bullying is defined as a specific type of 
</p>
<p>aggression in which a more powerful person 
</p>
<p>(or group) is attacking a less powerful one 
</p>
<p>repeatedly over time with the intention to do 
</p>
<p>harm (Nansel et&nbsp;al., 2001).

</p>
<p>behavioral response to experiences of victimiza-
</p>
<p>tion (Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2012). When being 
</p>
<p>insulted or excluded by their peers, students with 
</p>
<p>an entity theory are more likely to desire ven-
</p>
<p>geance and aggression (Yeager &amp; Miu, 2011; 
</p>
<p>Yeager, Trzesniewski, Tirri, Nokelainen, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dweck, 2011). Peer-victimized students also 
</p>
<p>report more depressive symptoms, if they endorse 
</p>
<p>an entity theory (Rudolph, 2010). For an entity 
</p>
<p>theorist, victimization is done by &ldquo;bullies,&rdquo; who 
</p>
<p>will never change, to &ldquo;losers,&rdquo; who will never 
</p>
<p>change. This belief leaves victims of bullying 
</p>
<p>hopeless about their own future, because they 
</p>
<p>believe they will always be the ones being picked 
</p>
<p>on. Moreover, it justifies a vengeful- aggressive 
</p>
<p>response toward the perpetrators who are seen as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;bad people&rdquo;. An incremental theory, on the other 
</p>
<p>hand, implies that both victims and bullies can 
</p>
<p>change, suggesting that they might get out of their 
</p>
<p>role eventually. This perspective opens up the 
</p>
<p>possibility of a more prosocial- resilient reaction 
</p>
<p>to bullying, such as educating the perpetrators 
</p>
<p>(Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2012; Yeager et&nbsp;al., 2011; see 
</p>
<p>also Yeager &amp; Miu, 2011).
</p>
<p>Building upon these findings, Yeager, 
</p>
<p>Trzesniewski, et&nbsp;al. (2013) designed an interven-
</p>
<p>tion study targeting adolescents&rsquo; implicit theories 
</p>
<p>about personality in order to help them cope with 
</p>
<p>social adversity in their everyday life. The study 
</p>
<p>had a pre-post control group design with a treat-
</p>
<p>ment group, an active control group, and a no- 
</p>
<p>treatment control group. The main hypotheses of 
</p>
<p>the study were that an incremental theory inter-
</p>
<p>vention would (a) reduce aggression and increase 
</p>
<p>prosocial behavior in response to an incidence of 
</p>
<p>peer exclusion, (b) reduce conduct problems in 
</p>
<p>school (i.e., aggression, acting out) and (c) reduce 
</p>
<p>depressive symptoms among peer-victimized 
</p>
<p>students (Yeager, Trzesniewski, et&nbsp;al., 2013).
</p>
<p>The researchers randomly selected a medium- 
</p>
<p>to- large size school from a list of 20 schools in 
</p>
<p>the San Francisco Bay Area that fulfilled differ-
</p>
<p>ent criteria with regard to cultural diversity and 
</p>
<p>social background. From the selected school, 
</p>
<p>246 students from ninth and tenth grade (14&ndash;
</p>
<p>16&nbsp;years old) participated in the study (Yeager, 
</p>
<p>Trzesniewski, et&nbsp;al., 2013).
</p>
<p>An overview of the procedure is depicted in 
</p>
<p>Fig.&nbsp;12.1. Three weeks prior to and 2 weeks after, 
</p>
<p>the intervention participants filled out surveys 
</p>
<p>assessing some of the dependent variables (i.e., 
</p>
<p>implicit theories about personality, aggression/
</p>
<p>victimization, depressive symptoms). Further, 1 
</p>
<p>month after the intervention, the researchers col-
</p>
<p>lected behavioral responses (i.e., aggression, pro-
</p>
<p>social behavior) to peer victimization among a 
</p>
<p>balanced subset of 150 students. Last, 3 months 
</p>
<p>after the intervention, 16 teachers reported 
</p>
<p>observed reductions in conduct problems (e.g., 
</p>
<p>acting out in class) among their students.
</p>
<p>The intervention itself was administered in six 
</p>
<p>sessions during students&rsquo; biology classes. 
</p>
<p>Students were randomly assigned to one of three 
</p>
<p>conditions: the incremental theory group, the 
</p>
<p>coping skill group, or the no-treatment group. 
</p>
<p>Two teams of adult paid facilitators were trained 
</p>

</p>
<p>by the researchers to teach either the incremental 
</p>
<p>theory workshop or the coping skill workshop. 
</p>
<p>Facilitators were blind to hypotheses and post- 
</p>
<p>intervention interviews revealed that all of them 
</p>
<p>thought they were providing the target treatment. 
</p>
<p>The workshops were designed to be parallel in 
</p>
<p>many ways, for instance, with regard to materials 
</p>
<p>and didactic methods applied.
</p>
<p>The incremental theory workshop covered 
</p>
<p>three segments, each of them designed to teach 
</p>
<p>one key message via different kinds of activities. 
</p>
<p>In the first segment, students learned basic infor-
</p>
<p>mation about neuroanatomy and how the brain 
</p>
<p>changes during learning. The second segment 
</p>
<p>then focused on neural mechanisms that support 
</p>
<p>the view that personality can change. The third 
</p>
<p>segment focused on the translation of an incre-
</p>
<p>mental theory into participants&rsquo; everyday life and 
</p>
<p>covered the main message that people have dif-
</p>
<p>ferent motivations for their actions (e.g., thoughts, 
</p>
<p>feelings) which can also be changed. This last 
</p>
<p>segment also corrected possible misconceptions 
</p>
<p>(e.g., incremental theory does not suggest that 
</p>
<p>people change all the time). The coping skill 
</p>
<p>workshop was based on a widely used coping 
</p>
<p>skill curriculum for high-school students 
</p>
<p>(Frydenberg, 2010) and was shortened to parallel 
</p>
<p>the incremental theory workshop. It was designed 
</p>
<p>to be as enjoyable and engaging as the incremen-
</p>
<p>tal theory workshop and used the same methods 
</p>
<p>and in parts even provided the same information, 
</p>
<p>for instance, information about neuroanatomy 
</p>
<p>and how the brain learns.
</p>
<p>To examine the effectiveness of the interven-
</p>
<p>tion, the researchers collected both self-report and 
</p>
<p>behavioral measures. As behavioral measure of 
</p>
<p>aggression in response to peer exclusion, Yeager 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al. (2013) administered the &ldquo;hot sauce para-
</p>
<p>digm,&rdquo; which had previously proven to be a valid 
</p>
<p>measure of aggression in adolescents (Lieberman, 
</p>
<p>Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; McGregor, 1999). The 
</p>
<p>testing was administered in group sessions by 
</p>
<p>research assistances who were blind to condition 
</p>
<p>and hypotheses. First, students played a video 
</p>
<p>game called &ldquo;Cyberball&rdquo; (Williams, Cheung, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Choi, 2000), in which they experienced social 
</p>
<p>exclusion. In this video game participants toss a 
</p>
<p>ball together with two other players, who are sup-
</p>
<p>posedly controlled by two other students in the 
</p>
<p>room. In fact, unknowingly, participants played 
</p>
<p>with the computer program only. After being 
</p>
<p>thrown the ball twice in the beginning, they are 
</p>
<p>not thrown it again. This procedure typically pro-
</p>
<p>duces negative feelings of being socially excluded. 
</p>
<p>Afterwards participants were asked to take part in 
</p>
<p>a supposed &ldquo;taste testing&rdquo; activity, in which their 
</p>
<p>partner has to eat all the food (i.e., hot sauce) they 
</p>
<p>assign to him/her. They also learn that they are 
</p>
<p>coupled up with one of the players who had previ-
</p>
<p>ously excluded them in the ball toss game and that 
</p>
<p>this student dislikes spicy food. The measure of 
</p>
<p>aggression is the amount of hot sauce they assign 
</p>
<p>to their partner. As a measure of prosocial behav-
</p>
<p>ior, participants were asked to write a note that 
</p>
<p>would be handed to their partner together with the 
</p>
<p>hot sauce. These messages were later coded for 
</p>
<p>levels of prosociality (e.g., apologizing for the hot 
</p>
<p>sauce).
</p>
<p>Results showed that, compared to both the 
</p>
<p>no- treatment and the coping skill group, students 
</p>
<p>who had received the incremental theory work-
</p>
<p>shop assigned significantly less hot sauce and 
</p>
<p>wrote more prosocial messages. Importantly, 
</p>
<p>only the incremental theory workshop increased 
</p>
<p>students&rsquo; agreement with an incremental theory 
</p>
<p>from before to after the workshop, suggesting 
</p>
<p>that the difference between groups can be attrib-
</p>
<p>uted to changes in incremental theory. Further, in 
</p>
<p>the no-treatment group, students who reported 
</p>
<p>being victims of bullying reported more depres-
</p>
<p>sive symptoms than non-victims. However, 
</p>
<p>within both treatment groups, the number of 
</p>
<p>depressive symptoms did not differ between 
</p>
<p>victims and non-victims. This result suggests that

</p>
<p>both workshops (incremental theory and coping 
</p>
<p>skills) were effective in reducing the negative 
</p>
<p>effect of bullying on students&rsquo; psychological 
</p>
<p>adjustment.
</p>
<p>The study applied Mindset Theory, building 
</p>
<p>on a large basis of studies suggesting that 
</p>
<p>implicit theories play a crucial role in the 
</p>
<p>response to victimization (Yeager &amp; Dweck, 
</p>
<p>2012; Yeager &amp; Miu, 2011; Yeager, Miu, et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2013; Yeager et&nbsp;al., 2011) and studies suggest-
</p>
<p>ing that implicit theories can be changed 
</p>
<p>(Aronson, Fried, &amp; Good, 2002; Yeager et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2011). Note, that the researchers applied Mindset 
</p>
<p>Theory rigorously throughout the design of their 
</p>
<p>study. For instance, they assessed victimization 
</p>
<p>by peers, which later served as moderator of the 
</p>
<p>effect of the workshop on depressive symptoms 
</p>
<p>and conduct problems. This decision was based 
</p>
<p>on the knowledge that implicit theories are most 
</p>
<p>important in situations when people face diffi-
</p>
<p>culties (Blackwell et&nbsp; al., 2007; Dweck, 2012b; 
</p>
<p>Hong et&nbsp; al., 1999; Sisk et&nbsp; al., 2019; Yeager &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dweck, 2012). Whether and how this interven-
</p>
<p>tion can be applied on a larger scale (e.g., in 
</p>
<p>entire schools or school districts) is an interesting 
</p>
<p>question for future research.

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Mindset Theory proposes that people 
</p>
<p>hold different beliefs about whether 
</p>
<p>people can or cannot change basic psy-
</p>
<p>chological attributes, such as their intel-
</p>
<p>ligence or personality.
</p>
<p>&bull; An incremental theory refers to the 
</p>
<p>belief that people can substantially 
</p>
<p>change with effort, while an entity theory 
</p>
<p>refers to the belief that human attributes 
</p>
<p>are fixed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Implicit theories affect important out-
</p>
<p>comes within the achievement and 
</p>
<p>interpersonal domain (e.g., academic 
</p>
<p>achievement, interpersonal aggression) 
</p>
<p>via a set of cognitive and motivational 
</p>
<p>processes that interact in a coherent 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;meaning system.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; Research identified four processes that 
</p>
<p>drive effects of implicit theories: goal 
</p>
<p>orientation, effort beliefs (only studied 
</p>
<p>in the achievement domain), attributions 
</p>
<p>of setbacks or social adversity, and 
</p>
<p>behavioral strategies to respond to 
</p>
<p>setbacks or social adversity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Intervention studies have applied 
</p>
<p>Mindset Theory to the domain of inter-
</p>
<p>personal aggression and suggest that 
</p>
<p>teaching adolescents an incremental the-
</p>
<p>ory about personality (i.e., the belief that 
</p>
<p>people can change their personality) 
</p>
<p>helps them to respond to social adversity 
</p>
<p>(e.g., exclusion by peers) more adap-
</p>
<p>tively (i.e., less aggression, less depres-
</p>
<p>sive symptoms).

<p> Guiding Answers to&nbsp;Questions 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Question with Box 12.2: Can you think of 
</p>
<p>other attributes that people might have implicit 
</p>
<p>theories about?
</p>
<p>A: Research has identified many implicit 
</p>
<p>theories, and not all of them are dealing with 
</p>
<p>the malleability of an attribute but most are. 
</p>
<p>Other examples of an implicit theory are 
</p>
<p>implicit theories about passion as something 
</p>
<p>to be found or developed (Chen, Ellsworth, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Schwarz, 2015; O&rsquo;Keefe, Dweck, &amp; Walton, 
</p>
<p>2018), implicit theories of romantic relation-
</p>
<p>ships as being characterized by romantic 
</p>
<p>destiny or relationship growth (Knee, 
</p>
<p>Nanayakkara, Vietor, Neighbors, &amp; Patrick, 
</p>
<p>2001). Other examples are implicit theories of 
</p>
<p>emotion regulation (Tamir, John, Srivastava, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Gross, 2007) and negotiation skills (Kray &amp; 
</p>
<p>Haselhuhn, 2007).
</p>
<p> 2. Question with Box 12.3: Why are implicit 
</p>
<p>theories often referred to as working in a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;meaning system,&rdquo; and what does the term 
</p>
<p>describe?
</p>
<p>A: The term &ldquo;meaning system&rdquo; describes the 
</p>
<p>multitude of processes that research identified 
</p>
<p>as driving effects of implicit theories, such as 
</p>
<p>goal setting, effort beliefs, attributions, and 
</p>
<p>strategies people use in the face of adversity. 
</p>
<p>These processes are not independent but rather 
</p>
<p>linked with each other and together form a 
</p>
<p>coherent system that allows the person to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;make sense&rdquo; of the world and make predic-
</p>
<p>tions based on this understanding. Depending 
</p>
<p>on the implicit theory people hold, they formu-
</p>
<p>late goals that make sense in their view (i.e., 
</p>
<p>performance versus learning goals); they form 
</p>
<p>coherent beliefs of effort (i.e., as signaling lack 
</p>
<p>of ability versus conducive to change), attri-
</p>
<p>bute their setbacks in the accordance to their 
</p>
<p>theory (i.e., as being due to lack of ability ver-
</p>
<p>sus effort), and follow strategies that are in line 
</p>
<p>with their belief (i.e., helpless versus 
</p>
<p>mastery-oriented).
</p>
<p> 3. Question with Box 12.4: What purpose serves 
</p>
<p>the active control group in an intervention 
</p>
<p>study (the coping skill group in the example 
</p>
<p>study)? What might have been reasons for 
</p>
<p>Yeager, Trzesniewski et al.  (2013) to also 
</p>
<p>include a no-treatment control group?
</p>
<p>A: From a methodological point of view, an 
</p>
<p>active control group helps researchers to 
</p>
<p>determine whether changes in their targeted 
</p>
<p>outcome are due to the specific intervention 
</p>
<p>message (here an incremental theory about 
</p>
<p>personality) and not only due to the fact that 
</p>
<p>participants received any kind of treatment. 
</p>
<p>From a practical viewpoint, having the active 
</p>
<p>control group engage in a treatment that has 
</p>
<p>been proven to be successful on the targeted 
</p>
<p>outcome helps to compare the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>the intervention and therefore to determine 
</p>
<p>which of the two is most effective (from an 
</p>
<p>ethical standpoint, it is also better to provide 
</p>
<p>the control group with some kind of effective, 
</p>
<p>state- of- the-art treatment). No-treatment con-
</p>
<p>trol groups are also often part of the design, 
</p>
<p>because they help to control for other processes 
</p>
<p>that might otherwise be overseen or even 
</p>
<p>changed by the treatment (e.g., natural change 
</p>
<p>in the outcome occurring over a period of time). 
</p>
<p>Further, by only comparing two treatment 
</p>
<p>groups, it is not possible to judge whether per-
</p>
<p>haps the control treatment made things worse 
</p>
<p>in terms of the outcome or whether there was 
</p>
<p>any effect (e.g., if both treatments have been 
</p>
<p>equally effective).

</p>
<p>organizations. A recent survey of the 
</p>
<p>Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
</p>
<p>Development (OECD) showed that, in G20 
</p>
<p>countries, on average 22% of all respondents had 
</p>
<p>to borrow money to make ends meet in the previ-
</p>
<p>ous year (OECD, 2017). Furthermore, 11.6 mil-
</p>
<p>lion adults living in the UK are categorized as 
</p>
<p>struggling financially (Money Advice Service, 
</p>
<p>2016), whereas almost one in five Dutch house-
</p>
<p>holds has debts that can be considered problem-
</p>
<p>atic (Simonse, Wilmink, &amp; Van der Werf, 2017). 
</p>
<p>These numbers indicate that even in countries 
</p>
<p>considered to be well-developed and wealthy, 
</p>
<p>many people fail to make ends meet and are at 
</p>
<p>risk of running into financial problems.
</p>
<p>This should be a reason for concern, because 
</p>
<p>financial problems can cause stress, tensions 
</p>
<p>within families, domestic violence, poor physical 
</p>
<p>and psychological health, stigmatization, social 
</p>
<p>isolation, and even suicide (e.g., Chapman &amp; 
</p>
<p>Freak, 2013; Drentea, 2000; Drentea &amp; Lavrakas, 
</p>
<p>2000; Lane 2016). Moreover, the impact of finan-
</p>
<p>cial problems reaches further than the individuals </p>

</p>
<p>and families directly involved. For example, the 
</p>
<p>financial problems of households in the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands cost the Dutch society an estimated 
</p>
<p>10 billion euros a year. This amount includes, 
</p>
<p>among others, costs for debt assistance, benefit 
</p>
<p>payments, reduced work productivity, house 
</p>
<p>evictions, and childcare (Simonse et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p>Given the profound impact that financial prob-
</p>
<p>lems have on individuals, their families, and soci-
</p>
<p>ety as a whole, financial resilience (which 
</p>
<p>includes preventing problematic debts) and finan-
</p>
<p>cial self-reliance are of utmost importance 
</p>
<p>(OECD, 2016; Simonse et&nbsp; al., 2017). People 
</p>
<p>should, for example, manage their money well on 
</p>
<p>a day-to-day basis: having a budget, keeping 
</p>
<p>records of expenses, and keeping up with pay-
</p>
<p>ment and other financial commitments. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>they should engage in financial planning: making 
</p>
<p>provision for retirement, being aware of financial 
</p>
<p>risks and opportunities, and taking effective 
</p>
<p>actions to minimize the effects of financial risks, 
</p>
<p>such as taking out appropriate insurances or 
</p>
<p>putting sufficient money aside in savings (OECD, 
</p>
<p>2016). Research by the Consumer Financial 
</p>
<p>Protection Bureau of the USA (2017) underlines 
</p>
<p>the importance of &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; financial behavior, 
</p>
<p>such as sound financial planning. Their results 
</p>
<p>showed that saving money&mdash;thereby increasing 
</p>
<p>resilience to unexpected expenses&mdash;is one of the 
</p>
<p>strongest predictors of financial well-being.
</p>
<p>Although financial resilience and financial 
</p>
<p>self-reliance are crucial for financial well-being, 
</p>
<p>people struggle with making healthy financial 
</p>
<p>decisions. For example, often people do not man-
</p>
<p>age to put sufficient money aside in savings in 
</p>
<p>order to be prepared for financial calamities. Why 
</p>
<p>is this the case? First, there might be financial 
</p>
<p>reasons. For example, people might simply need 
</p>
<p>all their money to make ends meet. Especially for 
</p>
<p>households with low (or even moderate) incomes, 
</p>
<p>insufficient financial resources might drive low 
</p>
<p>saving rates. Some of these low-income house-
</p>
<p>holds, however, do manage to save money, 
</p>
<p>whereas those with sufficient financial resources 
</p>
<p>sometimes fail to do so (e.g., Hayhoe, Cho, 
</p>
<p>DeVaney, Worthy, Kim, &amp; Gorham, 2012). 
</p>
<p>Apparently, there is more to saving than having 
</p>
<p>the money for it. Indeed, other reasons for not 
</p>
<p>saving often are of a more psychological nature. 
</p>
<p>For example, saving money means sacrificing 
</p>
<p>immediate gratification for future financial well-
</p>
<p>being, which, in turn, means overcoming a num-
</p>
<p>ber of psychological hurdles. In the next section, 
</p>
<p>we will elaborate on several of these hurdles.
</p>
<p> Why Saving Doesn&rsquo;t Come Easy
</p>
<p>A first psychological hurdle on the road to the piggy 
</p>
<p>bank is the optimism bias (Sharot, 2011). In gen-
</p>
<p>eral, people are (too) &ldquo;rosy&rdquo; about their financial 
</p>
<p>future. For example, they tend to overestimate their 
</p>
<p>future income while underestimating their future 
</p>
<p>spending and expenses (Lewis &amp; Van Venrooij, 
</p>
<p>1995; Norvilitis et&nbsp; al., 2006; Peetz &amp; Buehler, 
</p>
<p>2009) and therefore fail to see the necessity of put-
</p>
<p>ting money aside for future financial needs.
</p>
<p>Even when people are more realistic about 
</p>
<p>their financial future and consider the risks they 
</p>
<p>might face, there is still no guarantee that they 
</p>
<p>will build a financial buffer in their savings 
</p>
<p>account. To do so would mean resisting the 
</p>
<p>temptation of spending money now in favor of 
</p>
<p>spending possibilities in the future, and this 
</p>
<p>requires self-control (Thaler &amp; Shefrin, 1981; 
</p>
<p>see also Gieseler, Loschelder, &amp; Friese, Chap. 1). 
</p>
<p>Many people, however, have &ldquo;self-control issues.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Optimism bias: The tendency to overesti-
</p>
<p>mate the probability of positive events and 
</p>
<p>underestimate the probability of negative 
</p>
<p>events.

</p>
<p>savings?

</p>
<p>And they know it, because they are perfectly 
</p>
<p>willing to use a commitment device to deal with 
</p>
<p>these issues (Rogers, Milkman, &amp; Volpp, 2014; 
</p>
<p>Van der Swaluw et&nbsp; al., 2018). For example, to 
</p>
<p>preempt overspending, people cut up their credit 
</p>
<p>cards, literally freeze them in a container of 
</p>
<p>water, or sign up for savings accounts that charge 
</p>
<p>withdrawal penalties for early take-up (Ashraf, 
</p>
<p>Karlan, &amp; Yin, 2016). And banks also know it. 
</p>
<p>Already in 1910, Dutch banks provided clients 
</p>
<p>with &ldquo;saving canisters&rdquo; that could only be 
</p>
<p>opened by the bank. Actually, people have been 
</p>
<p>outsourcing financial self-control to their envi-
</p>
<p>ronments for centuries, as money boxes that had 
</p>
<p>to be broken before the valuables inside could 
</p>
<p>be spent date back to at least the fourteenth 
</p>
<p>century.
</p>
<p>Another hurdle on the road to a fat piggy bank 
</p>
<p>is that saving money requires an intertemporal 
</p>
<p>choice&mdash;a trade-off between costs (e.g., forego-
</p>
<p>ing current spending) and benefits (e.g., increased 
</p>
<p>savings) that occur at different points in time. 
</p>
<p>The problem with this is that immediate out-
</p>
<p>comes are more valued than delayed ones 
</p>
<p>(Loewenstein &amp; Elster, 1992). This present bias 
</p>
<p>can result in a spend-now-and-save-later attitude, 
</p>
<p>which surely will not fatten a piggy bank.
</p>
<p>Not only are present outcomes given more 
</p>
<p>weight than future ones; losses are also more heav-
</p>
<p>ily weighted than gains (Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 
</p>
<p>1979). It is even estimated that the psychological 
</p>
<p>pain of losses hurts roughly twice as much as gains 
</p>
<p>yield pleasure (Kahneman, Knetch, &amp; Thaler, 
</p>
<p>1991). Because &ldquo;losses loom larger than gains,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>people often show loss aversion, and this places 
</p>
<p>yet another hurdle on their road to the piggy bank. 
</p>
<p>Once people get used to a particular level of dis-
</p>
<p>posable income, a gain in savings does not out-
</p>
<p>weigh the loss in disposable income.
</p>
<p>Thus, when it comes to saving money, there is 
</p>
<p>many a slip &ldquo;twixt the cup and the lip.&rdquo; The opti-
</p>
<p>mism bias, self-control, the present bias, and loss 
</p>
<p>aversion are all psychological hurdles that can 
</p>
<p>withhold people from putting money aside in 
</p>
<p>savings. On a positive note, however, these biases 
</p>
<p>can also provide useful starting points for design-
</p>
<p>ing interventions that steer people in the right 
</p>
<p>direction on the way to the piggy bank, as we 
</p>
<p>have seen when discussing commitment devices. 
</p>
<p>To illustrate this point further, we will next 
</p>
<p>address a &ldquo;modern classic&rdquo; in behavioral inter-
</p>
<p>ventions: the Save More Tomorrow&trade; program.
</p>

</p>
<p>What are your personal reasons for not sav-

</p>
<p>to the psychological hurdles described in 
</p>
<p>this chapter?

</p>
<p>to help those (US) employees who wish to save 
</p>
<p>(more) money for retirement but lack the self-
</p>
<p>control to act on this desire. The essence of SMarT 
</p>
<p>is that employees commit themselves in advance 
</p>
<p>to allocating a portion of their future pay raise 
</p>
<p>toward their retirement savings. The program has 
</p>
<p>four core elements: (1) employees are approached 
</p>
<p>about increasing their contribution to their retire-
</p>
<p>ment savings plans; (2) if employees join, their 
</p>
<p>contribution is increased beginning with their first 
</p>
<p>salary after a raise; (3) their contribution contin-
</p>
<p>ues to increase on each scheduled raise until it 
</p>
<p>reaches a preset maximum; and (4) employees 
</p>
<p>can opt out of the plan at any time.
</p>
<p>Results of the first three implementations of 
</p>
<p>the program showed that, (1) 78% of the employ-
</p>
<p>ees offered the plan joined, (2) 80% of those 
</p>
<p>enrolled in the plan remained in it, and (3) the 
</p>
<p>average saving rates for participating employees 
</p>
<p>increased from 3.5% to 13.6% over the course of 
</p>
<p>40&nbsp;months (Thaler &amp; Benartzi, 2004). These find-
</p>
<p>ings clearly demonstrate that SMarT is highly 
</p>
<p>effective in making saving for retirement more 
</p>
<p>attractive and easier for employees who want to 
</p>
<p>save more.
</p>
<p>SMarT works so well because it is built in a 
</p>
<p>way that bypasses several psychological hurdles 
</p>
<p>while exploiting people&rsquo;s biases to create com-
</p>
<p>mitment to the plan. To illustrate, employees are 
</p>
<p>asked to join the program well before a scheduled 
</p>
<p>pay raise. This means that an increase in their 
</p>
<p>contribution is not starting now but some consid-
</p>
<p>erable time in the future, which makes joining the 
</p>
<p>program very attractive. Due to the optimism 
</p>
<p>bias, employees are more optimistic about their 
</p>
<p>ability to save in the future. In addition, employ-
</p>
<p>ees are still able to enjoy the rewards of spending 
</p>
<p>and discount the costs of saving (e.g., less con-
</p>
<p>sumption now) to the future. The program also 
</p>
<p>mitigates perceiving a reduction in income due to 
</p>
<p>saving as a loss in disposable income, because if 
</p>
<p>employees join, their contribution to the retire-
</p>
<p>ment savings plan is increased beginning with 
</p>
<p>their first pay check after their salary increased. 
</p>
<p>By contributing a part of their pay raise, employ-
</p>
<p>ees do not feel (as much) that they &ldquo;lose&rdquo; money 
</p>
<p>when saving&mdash;actually, after each pay raise, they 
</p>
<p>can spend more while also saving more. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, their contribution continues to 
</p>
<p>increase on each scheduled pay raise until it 
</p>
<p>reaches a preset maximum, a feature that makes 
</p>
<p>employees&rsquo; status quo bias work to keep them in 
</p>
<p>the plan (Kahneman et&nbsp; al., 1991). Thus, by 
</p>
<p>accounting for people&rsquo;s biased perceptions of 
</p>
<p>their present and future financial situation, 
</p>
<p>SMarT encourages employees to start saving (and 
</p>
<p>keep saving) for their retirement.
</p>
<p>Putting money aside in savings, however, is 
</p>
<p>much harder when it entails making more active 
</p>
<p>savings decisions rather than opting in or out of a 
</p>
<p>retirement savings plan. After all, such decisions 
</p>
<p>rely much more heavily on people&rsquo;s self-control 
</p>
<p>capacity. In these situations, interventions target-
</p>
<p>ing efficient goal progress monitoring might be 
</p>
<p>particularly effective as they guide people in 
</p>
<p>making the right behavioral adjustments at the 
</p>
<p>right time. In what follows, we will describe one 
</p>
<p>such intervention that was designed to aid Dutch 
</p>
<p>households to increase their savings. Before we 
</p>
<p>turn to the details of the intervention, we briefly 
</p>
<p>discuss its theoretical basis.
</p>
<p> Setting a&nbsp;Saving Goal: Let&rsquo;s Be&nbsp;More 
Specific
</p>
<p>The road to a fat piggy bank is paved with good 
</p>
<p>intentions. Many people want to save. Yet, their 
</p>
<p>good intentions are often not followed up by the 
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Status quo bias: People&rsquo;s tendency, when 
</p>
<p>choosing among alternatives, toward stick-
</p>
<p>ing with the status quo alternative&mdash;that is, 
</p>
<p>doing nothing or stick with their current or 
</p>
<p>previous decision.

</p>
<p>necessary actions. The devil might also here be in 
</p>
<p>the details. Research suggests that something 
</p>
<p>may change for the better when a goal is formu-
</p>
<p>lated in specific terms (Locke &amp; Latham, 1990; 
</p>
<p>Oettingen, Pak, &amp; Schnetter, 2001). A specific 
</p>
<p>goal provides concrete guidelines for attaining the 
</p>
<p>goal and therefore facilitates appropriate actions 
</p>
<p>for successful goal attainment. Moreover, a spe-
</p>
<p>cific goal can act as a schema for making the most 
</p>
<p>use of the available information (Ashford &amp; 
</p>
<p>Cummings, 1983). Saving &euro;15,000 for a new car 
</p>
<p>provides a concrete standard against which the 
</p>
<p>current state of affairs can be compared and on 
</p>
<p>which appropriate follow-up actions can be 
</p>
<p>planned. Without a specific goal, for example, 
</p>
<p>when saving for a rainy day, it is hard to know 
</p>
<p>exactly what to aim for, and clear action guide-
</p>
<p>lines for goal attainment are lacking (Sheeran &amp; 
</p>
<p>Webb, 2011; Triandis, 1980).
</p>
<p>Setting a specific goal, however, is by no means 
</p>
<p>a guarantee that the set goal will be attained. 
</p>
<p>Several scholars have pointed out that goal prog-
</p>
<p>ress monitoring is an important aspect of success-
</p>
<p>ful goal attainment (e.g., Carver &amp; Scheier, 1982; 
</p>
<p>Locke &amp; Latham, 1990, 2002; Powers, 1973). 
</p>
<p>Attaining a goal requires, in addition to setting a 
</p>
<p>specific goal and planning needed actions, notic-
</p>
<p>ing discrepancies between the goal and the current 
</p>
<p>state of affairs and being able to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; discrepan-
</p>
<p>cies (see also Keller, Bieleke, &amp; Gollwitzer, 
</p>
<p>Chap. 2). Whereas setting a specific goal merely 
</p>
<p>involves adopting a standard for performance, the 
</p>
<p>real work is probably in monitoring goal prog-
</p>
<p>ress&mdash;periodically evaluating progress in relation 
</p>
<p>to the set standard and closing the gap accordingly. 
</p>
<p>Without such progress monitoring, it becomes 
</p>
<p>impossible to identify discrepancies and, for 
</p>
<p>example, knowing when it is necessary to exercise 
</p>
<p>(more) self-control. A recent meta- analysis 
</p>
<p>showed that health interventions focusing on goal 
</p>
<p>progress monitoring are effective in attaining a 
</p>
<p>health goal (Harkin et&nbsp;al., 2016). In the context of 
</p>
<p>saving, this would mean that monitoring progress 
</p>
<p>toward a saving goal, for example, by checking a 
</p>
<p>savings account regularly, might facilitate success-
</p>
<p>fully attaining a saving goal.
</p>
<p>Goal progress monitoring, however, is not 
</p>
<p>always a pleasant activity. Progress can be slower 
</p>
<p>than anticipated and this might hinder continuous 
</p>
<p>and adequate monitoring. To prevent potentially 
</p>
<p>disheartening feedback, people might want to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;bury their heads in the sand&rdquo; and avoid relevant 
</p>
<p>information on their goal progress (Webb, 
</p>
<p>Chang, &amp; Benn, 2013). In the next section, we 
</p>
<p>will describe a behavioral intervention that was 
</p>
<p>designed, using a goal progress monitoring 
</p>
<p>framework, to help people attain a specific saving 
</p>
<p>goal (Van der Werf, Van Dijk, Van der Schors, 
</p>
<p>Wilderjans, &amp; Van Dillen, 2019).
</p>
<p> An Intervention Based on&nbsp;Goal 
Progress Monitoring
</p>
<p>When saving for a specific goal, goal progress 
</p>
<p>monitoring can be done in at least two ways. First, 
</p>
<p>monitoring can be done by people themselves, for 
</p>
<p>example, by checking their bank accounts regu-
</p>
<p>larly and keeping good track of savings. In the 
</p>
<p>current digital day and age, a quick glimpse on 
</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s accounts should be sufficient to establish 
</p>
<p>how much money has been saved already. As easy 
</p>
<p>as this may sound, one still has to make an active 
</p>
<p>decision to engage in monitoring progress toward 
</p>
<p>a saving goal. Especially, when progress is 
</p>
<p>expected to be less than hoped for, people might 
</p>
<p>decide against it and avoid goal progress monitor-
</p>
<p>ing as a result.
</p>
<p>A second way of goal progress monitoring&mdash;
</p>
<p>one that circumvents the hiatus described above&mdash;
</p>
<p>is &ldquo;outsourcing&rdquo; it to an external party. Banks or 
</p>
<p>other financial organizations could help their cus-
</p>
<p>tomers by explicitly informing them of their 
</p>
<p>progress toward a saving goal (e.g., via e-mail, 
</p>
<p>SMS, or in-app messages).
</p>
<p>To test whether such outsourcing is effective 
</p>
<p>in helping people to attain their saving goal, we 
</p>
<p>recruited participants via the website of the 
</p>
<p>National Institute for Family Information 
</p>
<p>(Nibud).1 This resulted in over 400 people regis-
</p>
<p>tering voluntarily for participation in the study.

<p>indicated their current savings and their saving

<p>goal for the period of the study (July&ndash;November

<p>progress toward their saving goal four times 
</p>
<p>through online questionnaires (in August,

<p>September, October, and November 2016). In 
</p>
<p>addition to these questionnaires, participants in 
</p>
<p>the feedback condition received feedback via 
</p>
<p>e-mail messages three times (in August, 
</p>
<p>September, and October 2016) about the amount 
</p>
<p>they had saved so far, and they were reminded 
</p>
<p>about their saving goal. Participants in the exten-
</p>
<p>sive feedback condition received, in addition to 
</p>
<p>this feedback, information about how much they 
</p>
<p>still needed to save to attain their saving goal (see 
</p>
<p>Table&nbsp;13.1) and a visual illustration of their goal 
</p>
<p>progress. Participants in the control condition did 
</p>
<p>not receive any additional information via e-mail 
</p>
<p>messages.
</p>
<p>The goal progress illustration in the extensive 
</p>
<p>feedback condition consisted of one row of ten 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;moneybags&rdquo;&mdash;each representing 10% progress 
</p>
<p>in attaining their saving goal&mdash;and participants&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>progress was made visual by the number of 
</p>
<p>moneybags that were colored (see Fig.&nbsp; 13.1). 
</p>
<p>We added this visual illustration for two reasons. 
</p>
<p>First, we argued that it would help information 
</p>
<p>processing and therefore facilitate goal progress 
</p>
<p>monitoring better (Cheema &amp; Bagchi, 2011). 
</p>
<p>Second, we argued that dividing a larger end goal 
</p>
<p>into smaller subgoals would result in the experi-
</p>
<p>ence of short-term successes on the road to a 
</p>
<p>(longer-term) end goal and this might increase 
</p>
<p>motivation and self-efficacy (e.g., Locke &amp; 
</p>
<p>Latham, 2002; but see Cheema &amp; Bagchi, 2011).
</p>
<p>We expected that the intervention in both 
</p>
<p>feedback conditions would facilitate goal prog-
</p>
<p>ress monitoring and therefore would be effective 
</p>
<p>in helping participants to attain their saving goal. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, for the reasons explained above, we 
</p>
<p>expected that the intervention in the extensive 
</p>
<p>feedback condition would be most effective.
</p>
<p>How did our participants do? And more 
</p>
<p>important, was our intervention effective in help-
</p>
<p>ing them to attain their saving goal? Overall, par-
</p>
<p>ticipants did not seem to show progress toward 
</p>
<p>their saving goal. After 5 months, they attained, 
</p>
<p>on average, minus 15% (!) of their saving goal 
</p>
<p>(see Table&nbsp;13.2).2 Yes, you read that correctly: 
</p>
<p>2 Results showed that the mean of minus 15% had a stan-
</p>
<p>dard deviation of 341%, indicating large individual differ-
</p>
<p>ences in goal progress. Half of the participants had a goal 
</p>
<p>progress of plus 50% or less.

</p>
<p>on average, participants actually had less savings 
</p>
<p>at the end of the study in comparison to the 
</p>
<p>beginning of our study. One reason for this find-
</p>
<p>ing might be the time period in which the study 
</p>
<p>was conducted. In May, many people in the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands receive a holiday allowance (about 
</p>
<p>8% of their yearly income). Participants might 
</p>
<p>have temporarily put aside this extra money in 
</p>
<p>savings until they use it for their holiday expenses, 
</p>
<p>usually in July or August. This might explain the 
</p>
<p>decreases in savings we observed during these 
</p>
<p>periods and, in our view, also illustrates the opti-
</p>
<p>mism bias. When setting their saving goal in July, 
</p>
<p>participants most likely were aware of their 
</p>
<p>upcoming holiday expenses, but they clearly 
</p>
<p>underestimated how much they would spend in 
</p>
<p>these periods.
</p>
<p>More interesting, however, is whether our 
</p>
<p>goal progress intervention was effective in 
</p>
<p>increasing the progress. The results of our 
</p>
<p>analyses,3 however, did not show a statistically 
</p>
<p>significant difference in goal progress between 
</p>
<p>the three conditions, for the period July to 
</p>
<p>November 2016. To examine whether the lack of 
</p>
<p>statistically significant differences in goal prog-
</p>
<p>ress between the three conditions could be due to 
</p>
<p>the relatively short duration of our study, we 
</p>
<p>decided to add an additional post-intervention 
</p>
<p>assessment of goal progress. Three months after 
</p>
<p>our initial study was completed, we invited those 
</p>
<p>participants who filled out all five questionnaires 
</p>
<p>during the intervention for a follow-up assess-
</p>
<p>ment, and 261 completed this in February 2017 
</p>
<p>(note that participants did not receive feedback 
</p>
<p>via e-mail messages in the period from November 
</p>
<p>to February). Our analyses of this 3 months&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>follow-up showed that participants in the exten-
</p>
<p>sive feedback condition had attained more of 
</p>
<p>their initial saving goal than those in the control 
</p>
<p>3 We used multilevel modelling to examine the change in 
</p>
<p>percentage of goal attainment over time. This technique 
</p>
<p>can deal with the hierarchical nature of the data (i.e., mea-
</p>
<p>surements nested within participants). Condition and the 
</p>
<p>interaction between condition and time were our indepen-
</p>
<p>dent variables. Age, gender, household income, and expe-
</p>
<p>rienced financial scarcity were added to the model as 
</p>
<p>covariates (results concerning these covariates are dis-
</p>
<p>cussed in Van der Werf et&nbsp;al., 2019).
</p>
<p>condition (see Table 1.2), a difference that was 
</p>
<p>marginally statistically significant (p&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.058). 
</p>
<p>There was a similar pattern, although not statisti-
</p>
<p>cally significant, for participants in the feedback 
</p>
<p>condition.
</p>
<p>In sum, testing our intervention based on goal 
</p>
<p>progress monitoring did not yield clear evidence 
</p>
<p>for its effectiveness in helping people to attain 
</p>
<p>their saving goal. Although results of our study 
</p>
<p>did not show a statistically significant short-term 
</p>
<p>effect, we did find a marginal statistically signifi-
</p>
<p>cant effect of the extensive feedback condition on 
</p>
<p>a longer term. In hindsight, we can only speculate 
</p>
<p>why we obtained the results we did. A first reason 
</p>
<p>why we found little or no differences between 
</p>
<p>our three conditions might concern the partici-
</p>
<p>pants included in the study. Remember that they 
</p>
<p>voluntarily signed up for a study on saving. This 
</p>
<p>might have led to a selection of participants who, 
</p>
<p>at the start of the study, were already motivated to 
</p>
<p>put money aside in savings. It could well be that 
</p>
<p>our intervention has little added value for (more) 
</p>
<p>motivated savers as they might already monitor 
</p>
<p>their savings themselves. If our participants were 
</p>
<p>already motivated to save, this did not increase 
</p>
<p>their savings from July to November. Actually, 
</p>
<p>on average, their savings decreased during this 
</p>
<p>period. More research is needed to test whether 
</p>
<p>our intervention is (more) effective when using 
</p>
<p>other samples of participants and perhaps other 
</p>
<p>periods of the year.
</p>
<p>A second reason why the intervention was less 
</p>
<p>effective than expected might be that participants 
</p>
<p>in the control condition were also steered toward 
</p>
<p>goal progress monitoring. Although these partici-
</p>
<p>pants were not provided with additional informa-
</p>
<p>tion via e-mail messages, they did receive monthly 
</p>
<p>questionnaires to indicate their savings. Hence, 
</p>
<p>participants in the control condition were attend-
</p>
<p>ing to their savings at least once a month, which 
</p>
<p>might have already facilitated goal progress moni-
</p>
<p>toring. This could have reduced the (intended) dif-
</p>
<p>ference between the control and intervention 
</p>
<p>conditions and makes it harder to detect the effec-
</p>
<p>tiveness of our intervention. Future research is 
</p>
<p>needed to test this possibility. One possibility is to 
</p>
<p>conduct an intervention study in collaboration 
</p>
<p>with a bank or another organization that has 
</p>
<p>13 The Road to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Piggy Bank: Two Behavioral Interventions to&nbsp;Increase Savings</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>202
</p>
<p>access to savings data, which makes it unnecessary 
</p>
<p>to work with questionnaires.
</p>
<p>The above two reasons shed some light on why 
</p>
<p>the intervention was not effective during the first 5 
</p>
<p>months of the study. The findings, however, did 
</p>
<p>suggest that, after 8 months, participants in the 
</p>
<p>extensive feedback condition were more success-
</p>
<p>ful at attaining their saving goal. It should again be 
</p>
<p>noted that this result only approached statistical 
</p>
<p>significance and more research is needed to make 
</p>
<p>a stronger argument, but it does raise the question 
</p>
<p>why extensive feedback could be (more) effective 
</p>
<p>on a longer term. Again, we can only speculate on 
</p>
<p>the reasons why. One possibility is related to the 
</p>
<p>goal gradient effect, that is, an increase in motiva-
</p>
<p>tion to attain a goal when the goal nears comple-
</p>
<p>tion (Hull, 1934). It could be that the visual 
</p>
<p>illustration (&ldquo;moneybags&rdquo;) of goal progress makes 
</p>
<p>participants experience coming closer and closer 
</p>
<p>to their saving goal, which might have increased 
</p>
<p>their commitment to the goal and their motivation 
</p>
<p>to attain it. Consequently, it could be that, when 
</p>
<p>after 5 months the e-mail messages with explicit 
</p>
<p>feedback on their goal progress stopped, they con-
</p>
<p>tinued saving for a longer period than participants 
</p>
<p>in the other two conditions. To test this possibility, 
</p>
<p>more research is also needed.
</p>
<p> Conclusion
</p>
<p>Putting money aside in savings does not come 
</p>
<p>easy for people. Next to overcoming the neces-
</p>
<p>sary financial constraints, it requires jumping 
</p>
<p>several psychological hurdles, such as the opti-
</p>
<p>mism bias, self-control, the present bias, loss 
</p>
<p>aversion, and goal progress monitoring, and 
</p>
<p>therefore people could need some help on the 
</p>
<p>road to the piggy bank. Behavioral interventions 
</p>
<p>using insights from social psychology and behav-
</p>
<p>ioral economics can provide useful assistance in 
</p>
<p>steering people into the right direction. The pos-
</p>
<p>sibilities for assistance are many, and designing, 
</p>
<p>testing, and, subsequently, implementing (effec-
</p>
<p>tive) financial interventions will not only result in 
</p>
<p>increased retirement savings or a &euro;15,000 car but 
</p>
<p>will also help people to become more financially 
</p>
<p>resilient and self-reliant and thereby contributing 
</p>
<p>to happier and more fulfilling lives.

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; People often find it difficult to put money 
</p>
<p>aside in savings. This is, at least partly, 
</p>
<p>because they perceive their financial 
</p>
<p>future too optimistically, lack sufficient 
</p>
<p>self-control, overvalue immediate out-
</p>
<p>comes, and weigh losses more heavily 
</p>
<p>than gains.
</p>
<p>&bull; In the USA, where saving for retirement 
</p>
<p>is not obligatory, the Save More 
</p>
<p>Tomorrow&trade; (SMarT) program is a 
</p>
<p>highly effective intervention for increas-
</p>
<p>ing employees&rsquo; contribution to their 
</p>
<p>retirement savings plans.
</p>
<p>&bull; The crux of SMarT is that it bypasses 
</p>
<p>several psychological hurdles (e.g., the 
</p>
<p>optimism bias, self-control, and loss 
</p>
<p>aversion) and exploits others (e.g., the 
</p>
<p>status quo bias) in order to increase sav-
</p>
<p>ings for retirement.
</p>
<p>&bull; Testing an intervention based on goal 
</p>
<p>progress monitoring did not yield clear 
</p>
<p>evidence for its effectiveness in helping 
</p>
<p>people to attain their saving goal. The 
</p>
<p>results of this study, however, hinted at 
</p>
<p>the possibility of a longer-term effect. 
</p>
<p>Until more research is conducted, the 
</p>
<p>jury is still out.

<p> Guiding Answers to&nbsp;Questions 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Q (With Box 13.1): Have you put aside suffi-
</p>
<p>cient money in savings?
</p>
<p>A: How much savings are sufficient is depen-
</p>
<p>dent upon your personal situation, and there 
</p>
<p>are online tools available that will give you a 
</p>
<p>personal advice (e.g., see the Money Advice 
</p>
<p>Service&rsquo;s website). Nibud advises to hold also 
</p>
<p>a financial buffer in your savings account to 
</p>
<p>make sure that you can pay unexpected, larger, 
</p>
<p>and necessary expenses directly without hav-
</p>
<p>ing to take out a loan of adjust your lifestyle. 
</p>
<p>To start building a financial buffer, Nibud rec-
</p>
<p>ommends to put aside, each month, 10% of 
</p>
<p>your income in savings until you reach your 
</p>
<p>advised buffer.
</p>
<p> 2. Q (With Box 13.2): What are your personal 
</p>
<p>reasons for not saving (more) and how do 
</p>
<p>these reasons relate to the psychological hur-
</p>
<p>dles described in this chapter?
</p>
<p>A: Reasons such as &ldquo;At the moment, I don&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>necessarily need savings&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save more 
</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m older and earn more money&rdquo; are 
</p>
<p>related to the optimism bias. A reason such as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the start of the month, I always want to 
</p>
<p>save some money, but by the end I just spend 
</p>
<p>it all&rdquo; is related to self- control. Whereas rea-
</p>
<p>sons such as &ldquo;I really need my money more 
</p>
<p>now than in the future&rdquo; or &ldquo;It would mean 
</p>
<p>missing out on a lot of fun things when I have 
</p>
<p>to cut my spending in order to save&rdquo; are related 
</p>
<p>to the present bias and loss aversion.
</p>
<p> 3. Q (With Box 13.3): If your friend wants to 
</p>
<p>save more, what would you advise her?
</p>
<p>A: There are a few &ldquo;smart&rdquo; ways of putting 
</p>
<p>money aside in savings without feeling it so 
</p>
<p>much directly. For example, transfer automati-
</p>
<p>cally, each month, a set amount to your sav-
</p>
<p>ings account (via your online or mobile 
</p>
<p>banking); transfer additional income (e.g., 
</p>
<p>holiday allowance, 13th month salary, or a 
</p>
<p>financial windfall) to your savings account 
</p>
<p>before you spend (some of) it; save with a spe-
</p>
<p>cific goal in mind; put (part of) your savings 
</p>
<p>on an account that is not connected to mobile 
</p>
<p>banking&mdash;this makes it more difficult to trans-
</p>
<p>fer money in your savings account (back) to 
</p>
<p>your checking account.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>If you are one of the 2.2 billion active Facebook 
</p>
<p>users, you might regularly check your Facebook 
</p>
<p>newsfeed. Intermixed with news or posts from 
</p>
<p>celebrities and brands, you then see what your 
</p>
<p>friends are up to: having fun at a party, going on a 
</p>
<p>weekend trip, and posting a picture with their 
</p>
<p>partner or a gorgeous-looking selfie. How do 
</p>
<p>these messages affect you? Are you happy for 
</p>
<p>your Facebook friends or do you experience 
</p>
<p>envy? Taking these questions as a starting point, 
</p>
<p>this chapter will summarize the literature on the 
</p>
<p>impact of social media use on emotions and dis-
</p>
<p>cuss (studies) on its implications for marketing.
</p>
<p>Checking the latest updates on social media 
</p>
<p>has become part of a daily routine for many peo-
</p>
<p>ple: Instagram reports 800 million monthly active 
</p>
<p>users (Statista, 2018), and the Chinese platform 
</p>
<p>Weibo reports 441 million users.1 Many of these 
</p>
<p>users check the platforms daily, and the updates 
</p>
<p>on social media are mostly positive, cool, and 
</p>
<p>entertaining (Barash, Duchenaut, Isaacs, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Bellotti, 2010; Utz, 2015). Researchers therefore 
</p>
<p>have wondered how reading these positive 
</p>
<p>updates affects the emotions of users (Krasnova, 
</p>
<p>Wenninger, Widjaja, &amp; Buxmann, 2013; Lin &amp; 
</p>
<p>Utz, 2015). The potential negative effects have

</p>
<p>received a great deal of attention; reading posts 
</p>
<p>on social media is assumed to reduce well-being 
</p>
<p>because the posts elicit envy (Krasnova et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2013; Verduyn, Ybarra, R&eacute;sibois, Jonides, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Kross, 2017). But emotions also influence con-
</p>
<p>sumer behavior. Most platforms are free for the 
</p>
<p>users, but make money from advertising. 
</p>
<p>Facebook alone made roughly 40 billion dollars 
</p>
<p>from advertising in 2017.2 Understanding how 
</p>
<p>social media use influences emotions should thus 
</p>
<p>also pay off for companies.
</p>
<p>This chapter will review several social- 
</p>
<p>psychological theories that help to explain how 
</p>
<p>social media use influences emotions. It will also 
</p>
<p>demonstrate the applied relevance of this knowl-
</p>
<p>edge by summarizing research showing how 
</p>
<p>social media-triggered envy influences consumer 
</p>
<p>behavior. The chapter starts with a discussion of 
</p>
<p>social media and their affordances, before emo-
</p>
<p>tions are briefly defined. The effects of social 
</p>
<p>media use on emotions are then discussed from 
</p>
<p>two perspectives: first from the perspective of the 
</p>
<p>person who shares the emotion and second from 
</p>
<p>the perspective of the person who reads social 
</p>
<p>media updates. In a final step, the influence of 
</p>
<p>emotions on consumer behavior and implications 
</p>
<p>for brands are discussed.
</p>
<p> Social Media
</p>
<p>The most popular forms are social network 
</p>
<p>sites (SNS) such as Facebook, but also weblogs 
</p>
<p>or microblogging services such as Twitter fall 
</p>
<p>under this umbrella term. Social media are 
</p>
<p>characterized by the user-generated content and 
</p>
<p>the (semi-)public nature of conversations. 
</p>
<p>Content can be produced by everyone by sim-
</p>
<p>ply typing some text into a box when prompted 
</p>
<p>to do so by questions such as &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your 
</p>
<p>mind, &lt;username&gt;?&rdquo;. Photos can easily be added. 
</p>
<p>Messages go usually to a large group of people. 
</p>
<p>On Twitter, contributions are (by default) even 
</p>
<p>visible for people without an account on the 
</p>

<p>Social media platforms change frequently; 
</p>
<p>some early SNS (e.g., Friendster, Hyves) do no 
</p>
<p>longer exist. Moreover, the existing SNS change 
</p>
<p>rapidly. To analyze and predict the effects of 
</p>
<p>social media, it is therefore more helpful to 
</p>
<p>look at the affordances (see Box 14.1) the SNS 
</p>
<p>provide than to look at a specific feature or 
</p>
<p>platform.

<p>Box 14.1 Zooming In: Affordances
</p>
<p>The concept of affordances was coined by 
</p>
<p>Gibson (1977), a perception psychologist 
</p>
<p>who studied animals and argued that 
</p>
<p>objects afford certain uses to animals. A 
</p>
<p>rock can be perceived as something to sit 
</p>
<p>on, as building material, or as a weapon. 
</p>
<p>Thus, how objects are used does not depend 
</p>
<p>so much on their qualities (e.g., hard, 
</p>
<p>sharp), but on the perceived affordances 
</p>
<p>(to sit, to throw). People can differ in how 
</p>
<p>they perceive the affordances of social 
</p>
<p>media (e.g., visibility, persistence). Whereas 
</p>
<p>one person might perceive the high visibility 
</p>
<p>of content on social media as encourage-
</p>
<p>ment for an idealized  self- presentation in 
</p>
<p>front of a large audience, another person 
</p>
<p>might be discouraged from posting publicly 
</p>
<p>by the same affordance.

</p>
<p>Visibility to a larger audience and persistence&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>the Internet never forgets&nbsp; &ndash; are affordances that 
</p>
<p>characterize most social media. For people who are 
</p>
<p>concerned about their privacy, these affordances 
</p>
<p>are a reason for posting only few and/or not very 
</p>
<p>personal status updates (Utz, 2015). For people 
</p>
<p>scoring high on narcissism or need for popularity 
</p>
<p>(Buffardi &amp; Campbell, 2008; Utz, Tanis, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Vermeulen, 2012), the same affordances make 
</p>
<p>social media an optimal platform for presenting 
</p>
<p>themselves in an idealized way because they can 
</p>
<p>easily reach a large audience. The affordance of 
</p>
<p>editability allows them additionally to carefully 
</p>
<p>curate their self- presentation (Hogan, 2010).
</p>
<p>Thus, due to their specific affordances, social 
</p>
<p>media are platforms on which people present the 
</p>
<p>positive sides of their life. This holds even more for 
</p>
<p>Instagram, a photo sharing platform on which the 
</p>
<p>majority of photos depict beautiful happy people 
</p>
<p>engaging in healthy activities (Deighton- Smith &amp; 
</p>
<p>Bell, 2017). Moreover, these overly positive self-
</p>
<p>presentations are pushed into a user&rsquo;s feed thus 
</p>
<p>increasing exposure to positive messages. The 
</p>
<p>question is therefore which emotional responses 
</p>
<p>posting or reading these overwhelmingly positive 
</p>
<p>posts elicits. Before we discuss these questions, a 
</p>
<p>short introduction into emotions is given.
</p>
<p> Emotions
</p>
<p>One issue of research on emotions is that there 
</p>
<p>are many definitions and theories of emotion 
</p>
<p>(Scherer, 2005). Early theories (e.g., James, 
</p>
<p>1884) considered the physiological reactions 
</p>
<p>(e.g., crying, trembling) as the basis of an emo-
</p>
<p>tion. According to this view, people feel sad 
</p>
<p>because they cry. Appraisal theories, in contrast, 
</p>
<p>assume that the evaluation and interpretation of 
</p>
<p>situations play a central role in the experience of 
</p>
<p>emotions (Arnold, 1960; Lazarus, 1991).
</p>
<p>The first appraisal theory stems from Arnold 
</p>
<p>(1960) (see Fig.&nbsp;14.1). When a specific situation 
</p>
<p>occurs, people appraise its consequences for 
</p>
<p>themselves (good/bad) which then leads to an 
</p>
<p>emotion and an action. For example, being left by 
</p>
<p>your partner would be appraised first as bad and 
</p>
<p>then trigger the emotion sadness and physiologi-
</p>
<p>cal reactions such as crying and actions such as 
</p>
<p>withdrawal.
</p>
<p>Lazarus (1991) developed this model further 
</p>
<p>and distinguished between primary appraisals, 
</p>
<p>which influence the evaluation of an event, and 
</p>
<p>secondary appraisals, which influence the evalua-
</p>
<p>tion of potential actions. Primary appraisals deal 
</p>
<p>with the question whether the event is in conflict 
</p>
<p>(negative emotion) or in accordance (positive 
</p>
<p>emotion) with an individual&rsquo;s goals, as well as 
</p>
<p>the relevance and ego relation of this goal. For 
</p>
<p>example, when you are in a restaurant and the 
</p>
<p>waiter doesn&rsquo;t serve you, it might depend on 
</p>
<p>whether you are very hungry (in conflict with 
</p>
<p>goal) or mainly there to socialize with friends 
</p>
<p>(no conflict) whether you experience anger. 
</p>
<p>Secondary appraisals address the question of 
</p>
<p>blame or how the individual can deal with the 
</p>
<p>situation. Is the restaurant simply very crowded 
</p>
<p>or do you think the waiter ignores you on 
</p>
<p>purpose? Do you think you can change something 
</p>
<p>about the situation? This would determine how 
</p>
<p>you deal with the situation&nbsp;&ndash; whether you would 
</p>
<p>wait, yell at the waiter, or write a negative review 
</p>
<p>about the restaurant.
</p>

</p>
<p>The next section will discuss how sharing 
</p>
<p>experiences on social media affects the emotions 
</p>
<p>of the persons who post on social media.
</p>
<p> Capitalization
</p>
<p>Capitalization describes the process of sharing 
</p>
<p>positive events with (close) others (Gable &amp; Reis, 
</p>
<p>2010). People are in general more likely to share 
</p>
<p>positive (vs. negative) news with close others&nbsp;&ndash; not 
</p>
<p>only because positive events are more prevalent 
</p>
<p>(Gable &amp; Haidt, 2005) but also because of the 
</p>
<p>intrapersonal and interpersonal benefits of sharing 
</p>
<p>positive emotions (Gable &amp; Reis, 2010).
</p>
<p>Two intrapersonal and one interpersonal 
</p>
<p>mechanism have been identified (see Gable &amp; 
</p>
<p>Reis, 2010, for a review): first, sharing positive 
</p>
<p>experiences intensifies the salience and memora-
</p>
<p>bility of positive events, which is desirable in 
</p>
<p>itself. Second, sharing requires a reflection pro-
</p>
<p>cess which helps people to find meaning in the 
</p>
<p>event, which further increases positive emotions. 
</p>
<p>Third, the positive reactions of (close) others 
</p>
<p>strengthen the relationship, which also triggers 
</p>
<p>positive emotions.
</p>
<p>Capitalization studies usually did not (explic-
</p>
<p>itly) take the medium into account, but due to the 
</p>
<p>large proportion of positive updates on social 
</p>
<p>media (Barash et&nbsp;al., 2010; Utz, 2015), the capi-
</p>
<p>talization framework is well suited for this con-
</p>
<p>text. On social media, posts are often shared with 
</p>
<p>a larger group. Addressing a larger group might 
</p>
<p>increase the appraisal that the event is important. 
</p>
<p>Carefully editing the post might foster the reflec-
</p>
<p>tion process.
</p>
<p>Choi and Toma (2014) examined the effects of 
</p>
<p>sharing emotions across a number of media chan-
</p>
<p>nels, including social media. They conducted a 
</p>
<p>daily diary study in which participants indicated 
</p>
<p>either for the most important positive or the most 
</p>
<p>important negative event of the day on which 
</p>
<p>channel(s) they have shared it. Positive and nega-
</p>
<p>tive affect after sharing was measured as well. 
</p>
<p>The effects of sharing were identical across chan-
</p>
<p>nels: people experienced more positive affect 
</p>
<p>after sharing positive events and more negative 
</p>
<p>affect after sharing negative events. The finding 
</p>
<p>that there are no differences between the chan-
</p>
<p>nels contradicts the idea that sharing (semi-)
</p>
<p>publicly on social media further increases the 
</p>
<p>salience of the experience and fosters the reflec-
</p>
<p>tion process.
</p>
<p>Sharing with many others on social media 
</p>
<p>might have interpersonal effects. Scissors, Burke, 
</p>
<p>and Wengrovitz (2016) looked at the role of likes 
</p>
<p>received and found that the number of likes was 
</p>
<p>less important than from whom people received 
</p>
<p>likes. The majority expected likes from close 
</p>
<p>friends or their partner, indicating that the 
</p>
<p>relationship strengthening effect of capitalization 
</p>
<p>occurs mainly with close others.
</p>
<p>Taken together, these studies show that capi-
</p>
<p>talization processes also occur on social media. 
</p>
<p>Sharing positive news with friends strengthens 
</p>
<p>positive emotions. However, close friends still 
</p>
<p>matter most for the intensification of positive 
</p>
<p>emotions. For the person who shares experiences 
</p>
<p>on social media, the intrapersonal and interper-
</p>
<p>sonal benefits seem to be the same as for sharing 
</p>
<p>face-to-face or on traditional media. How about 
</p>
<p>the person who reads these social media posts?
</p>
<p> Emotional Contagion
</p>
<p>One possible explanation how posts on social 
</p>
<p>media could influence emotions is emotional con-
</p>
<p>tagion (Hatfield, Walster, &amp; Berscheid, 1978). 
</p>
<p>Emotional contagion means that people take over 
</p>
<p>the emotions displayed by others, especially by 
</p>
<p>close others. This can happen without conscious 
</p>
<p>awareness by automatically mimicking others, 
</p>
<p>thus not necessarily requiring appraisals (Hatfield, 
</p>
<p>Cacioppo, &amp; Rapson, 1993). Emotional conta-
</p>
<p>gion has also been shown in computer- mediated 
</p>
<p>communication. Hancock, Gee, Ciaccio, and Lin 
</p>
<p>(2008) induced negative mood in one group of 
</p>
<p>chat participants and observed that they used

</p>
<p>fewer and sadder words and that this pattern and 
</p>
<p>the corresponding negative affect were picked up 
</p>
<p>by chat interaction partners.
</p>
<p> The Field Approach
</p>
<p>Studying emotional contagion on social media is 
</p>
<p>not easy because naturally occurring emotions are 
</p>
<p>difficult to detect and lab experiments are often 
</p>
<p>artificial. Kramer, Guillory, and Hancock (2014) 
</p>
<p>cooperated with Facebook and conducted a mas-
</p>
<p>sive field experiment in which they manipulated 
</p>
<p>the newsfeed of roughly 700,000 Facebook users. 
</p>
<p>They created four conditions: in one group, each 
</p>
<p>post containing negative words such as &ldquo;sad&rdquo; was 
</p>
<p>removed with a likelihood between 10% and 90%; 
</p>
<p>in another group, the same percentage of posts 
</p>
<p>containing positive words was removed. In the two 
</p>
<p>control groups, the identical percentage of posts 
</p>
<p>was blocked, but at random. This was done to 
</p>
<p>compare the effect of reduction in information 
</p>
<p>with reduction in positivity or negativity. 
</p>
<p>Subsequently, Kramer et&nbsp; al. (2014) tracked the 
</p>
<p>posts from the users and analyzed the number of 
</p>
<p>positive and negative words. They found a signifi-
</p>
<p>cant increase of positive words and a decrease in 
</p>
<p>negative words (compared to the control condi-
</p>
<p>tion) in the negativity-reduced group and the 
</p>
<p>reverse pattern in the positivity-reduced group and 
</p>
<p>took this as evidence for emotional contagion. 
</p>
<p>Although significant through the large sample, the 
</p>
<p>effect was however very small; only 0.1% of the 
</p>
<p>subsequent posts changed.
</p>
<p>This experiment has been heavily criticized 
</p>
<p>(see Panger (2016) for an excellent review; the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing sections are a summary of his analysis). 
</p>
<p>Most criticism has addressed ethical concerns: the 
</p>
<p>participants did not know that they were part of an 
</p>
<p>experiment and never gave their informed consent; 
</p>
<p>the study did also not undergo a review process by 
</p>
<p>an ethics committee. More relevant for the ques-
</p>
<p>tion which emotions are triggered by social media 
</p>
<p>use are the methodological concerns.
</p>
<p>First, there are problems with the internal 
</p>
<p>validity of the study. Removing positive posts 
</p>
<p>not only reduces the proportion of positive posts 
</p>
<p>but also increases the proportion of negative posts. 
</p>
<p>It is thus difficult to say whether the observed 
</p>
<p>effects are due to reduced positivity or increased 
</p>
<p>negativity.
</p>
<p>A second criticism is the measure of emo-
</p>
<p>tions. LIWC, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word 
</p>
<p>Count (Pennebaker, Francis, &amp; Booth, 2007), 
</p>
<p>was used for inferring the emotions. LIWC is a 
</p>
<p>computer program that can calculate the percent-
</p>
<p>age of words that correspond to certain emotions 
</p>
<p>from a pre-defined dictionary. Although LIWC is 
</p>
<p>in general a well-recognized tool, it is less clear 
</p>
<p>how well it can deal with short social media 
</p>
<p>posts. Tools such as SentiStrength (http://
</p>
<p>sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/) that were specifically 
</p>
<p>developed for the analysis of sentiment in short 
</p>
<p>social media posts reveal better results than the 
</p>
<p>more general LIWC (Buttliere, 2017).
</p>
<p>Moreover, it has not been controlled whether 
</p>
<p>people first posted what they had experienced and 
</p>
<p>then read their newsfeed or whether they first read 
</p>
<p>their newsfeed and then posted. Emotional conta-
</p>
<p>gion effects can only occur if people first read what 
</p>
<p>their Facebook friends have written. Thus, the 
</p>
<p>limited internal validity reduces the contribution of 
</p>
<p>this field study, although it has a high external 
</p>
<p>validity that is due to the natural setting.
</p>
<p> The Survey Approach
</p>
<p>Lin and Utz (2015) used alternative methods to 
</p>
<p>examine emotional contagion on social media. In 
</p>
<p>a first exploratory survey, they asked participants 
</p>
<p>to log into Facebook and to answer a series of 
</p>
<p>questions on the four most recent status updates in 
</p>
<p>their newsfeed. Among others, participants indi-
</p>
<p>cated how negative vs. positive the content of the 
</p>
<p>post was and which emotions it elicited. One goal 
</p>
<p>of this survey was to get information on the preva-
</p>
<p>lence of positive and negative emotions. The sec-
</p>
<p>ond goal was to explore the relationship with tie 
</p>
<p>strength, i.e., relational closeness (see Fig.&nbsp; 14.2 
</p>
<p>for the research model). Similar to capitalization 
</p>
<p>research, it was expected that emotional conta-
</p>
<p>gion effects are stronger with increasing closeness 
</p>
<p>(i.e., tie strength).
</p>
<p>With regard to the first goal, getting informa-
</p>
<p>tion on the prevalence of emotions, the results 
</p>
<p>14 Social Media as&nbsp;Sources of&nbsp;Emotions</p>

<p>210
</p>
<p>showed that positive emotions prevailed. From 
</p>
<p>the 598 status updates that did not stem from 
</p>
<p>Facebook pages or celebrities (provided by 207 
</p>
<p>participants), 64% elicited happiness, whereas 
</p>
<p>only 12.4% elicited envy and 11% jealousy. With 
</p>
<p>regard to the second goal, a significant interac-
</p>
<p>tion between tie strength and positivity of the 
</p>
<p>posts occurred for happiness. The more positive 
</p>
<p>the update, the happier was the reader. This effect 
</p>
<p>was stronger for closer relationships. That is, par-
</p>
<p>ticipants reacted more extremely with the corre-
</p>
<p>sponding emotion to positive and negative posts 
</p>
<p>from close friends than from acquaintances. 
</p>
<p>Appraisals have not been measured in this study, 
</p>
<p>but one can assume that people appraised positive 
</p>
<p>events in the life of their friends also as positive 
</p>
<p>for themselves.
</p>
<p>Thus, this pattern supports the predictions from 
</p>
<p>emotional contagion research. A methodological 
</p>
<p>limitation is that it was impossible to hold the con-
</p>
<p>tent of the posts from close friends and acquain-
</p>
<p>tances constant in a survey; it could be that the 
</p>
<p>Facebook algorithm selects different types of 
</p>
<p>posts for different Facebook friends and that it is 
</p>
<p>the content of the post that drives happiness.
</p>
<p> The Experimental Approach
</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, Lin and Utz (2015) 
</p>
<p>conducted an experiment in which all participants 
</p>
<p>were exposed to the same vacation picture (see 
</p>
<p>Fig.&nbsp; 14.3). Tie strength was manipulated by 
</p>
<p>letting people think either of a close friend, a 
</p>
<p>friend, or an acquaintance on Facebook. 
</p>
<p>Participants filled in some filler questions about 
</p>
<p>the target and the friendship history to make the 
</p>
<p>relationship more salient. Next, they were 
</p>
<p>instructed to imagine that this Facebook friend 
</p>
<p>had posted the vacation picture and to indicate 
</p>
<p>their emotions.
</p>
<p>As can be seen in Fig.&nbsp;14.4 (columns for hap-
</p>
<p>piness), the experiment revealed the same pattern 
</p>
<p>as the survey: the happy vacation picture induced 
</p>
<p>happiness in the readers, and it did so even more 
</p>
<p>when the photo was supposedly posted by a close 
</p>
<p>friend. A limitation is that the situation was rather 
</p>
<p>artificial; some participants might have thought 
</p>
<p>about a friend who would never go on a hiking 
</p>
<p>vacation, reducing the credibility of the 
</p>
<p>manipulation.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, across three different methods (a 
</p>
<p>massive field experiment, a survey, an experi-
</p>
<p>ment), the same pattern emerged: people experi-
</p>
<p>ence happiness when reading positive posts of 
</p>
<p>(close) others. There is thus support for emotional 
</p>
<p>contagion on social media. Nevertheless, there 
</p>
<p>were also incidents of negative emotions (envy, 
</p>
<p>jealousy) as reaction to positive posts that cannot 
</p>
<p>be explained by emotional contagion. We there-
</p>
<p>fore turn to social comparison theory in the next 
</p>
<p>section.
</p>
<p> Social Comparison Theory
</p>
<p>Social media provide people with information 
</p>
<p>about others: to which bars they go, what 
</p>
<p>clothes they wear, or where they spend their 
</p>
<p>vacations. When reading such information,

<p>A joy shared is a joy doubled, a trouble

<p>on social media?

</p>
<p>people usually compare themselves with these 
</p>
<p>others. This so-called social comparison is a fun-
</p>
<p>damental process (Festinger, 1954). The results 
</p>
<p>of social comparisons have also been linked to 
</p>
<p>emotions since they influence appraisals. Smith 
</p>
<p>(2000) summarized the different possible reac-
</p>
<p>tions (see Fig.&nbsp;14.5).
</p>
<p>The first distinction we can identify in Fig.&nbsp;14.5 
</p>
<p>is the comparison direction, being either upward 
</p>
<p>or downward. Upward comparisons occur when 
</p>
<p>the comparison target performs better or is richer 
</p>
<p>or more attractive than oneself; downward com-
</p>
<p>parisons occur when the comparison target per-
</p>

<p>oneself. A recent meta- analysis (Gerber, Wheeler, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Suls, 2018) showed that contrastive emotions 
</p>
<p>are the dominant reaction (e.g., envy if another 
</p>
<p>person is performing better and schadenfreude if 
</p>
<p>another person is performing worse), but both, 
</p>
<p>positive and negative emotions, have been found 
</p>
<p>for both comparison directions (Buunk, Collins, 
</p>
<p>Taylor, VanYperen, &amp; Dakof, 1990). Appraisals 
</p>
<p>based on the other two dimensions are important 
</p>
<p>to determine the triggered emotion: the focus, 
</p>
<p>which can be primarily on the self, the other, or on 
</p>
<p>both interaction partners, and the desirability of 
</p>
<p>the outcome for the self and the other person.
</p>
<p>For example, when a competing candidate gets 
</p>
<p>the job you applied for (an undesirable outcome 
</p>
<p>for the self), the emotion depends on whether the 
</p>
<p>focus of your appraisals about the situation is 
</p>
<p>purely on what the other has, on what you don&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>have, or on both. When you focus only on your-
</p>
<p>self, i.e., your poor performance in the job inter-
</p>
<p>view, you might experience shame. An exclusive 
</p>
<p>focus on the other results in resentment. When 
</p>
<p>you focus on what the other has but also on what 
</p>
<p>you lack (dual focus), envy is likely. Envy is a 
</p>
<p>negative emotion that &ldquo;arises when another person 
</p>
<p>lacks another&rsquo;s superior quality, achievement or 
</p>
<p>possession and either desires it or wishes that the 
</p>
<p>other lacked it&rdquo; (Parrott &amp; Smith, 1993, p.&nbsp;908).
</p>
<p>When it comes to social comparison processes 
</p>
<p>on social media, the majority of studies have 
</p>
<p>focused on envy (see Appel, Gerlach, &amp; Crusius, 
</p>
<p>2016, for a review). Recently, research started to 
</p>
<p>go beyond Smith (2000) by distinguishing between 
</p>
<p>benign envy and malicious envy (Van de Ven, 
</p>
<p>Fig. 14.5 Social 
comparison-based 
</p>
<p>emotions (Smith, 2000, 
</p>
<p>p.&nbsp;176)

</p>
<p>Zeelenberg, &amp; Pieters, 2009). Benign envy is 
</p>
<p>defined as a levelling-up motivation; the focus is 
</p>
<p>on the envied object or state, and benign envy 
</p>
<p>motivates people to work harder toward reaching the 
</p>
<p>envied object or state (van de Ven, Zeelenberg, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Pieters, 2011). Malicious envy in contrast is a 
</p>
<p>levelling-down motivation; the focus is on the 
</p>
<p>envied person, and it is characterized by wishing 
</p>
<p>ill to the envied person.
</p>
<p>In the experiment described above by Lin and 
</p>
<p>Utz (2015), benign and malicious envy were 
</p>
<p>measured as well. The holiday can be perceived 
</p>
<p>as a desirable outcome for the other, and&nbsp; &ndash; at 
</p>
<p>least at the moment&nbsp; &ndash; undesirable for oneself, 
</p>
<p>and might thus trigger (malicious) envy. When 
</p>
<p>the holiday is perceived as a desirable and reach-
</p>
<p>able goal for oneself, the post should elicit 
</p>
<p>benign envy, even more so for close friends 
</p>
<p>because these are usually more similar and there-
</p>
<p>fore more relevant comparison targets. In line 
</p>
<p>with the latter argument, participants reported 
</p>
<p>higher levels of benign envy for posts from 
</p>
<p>(close) friends than for posts from weak acquain-
</p>
<p>tances (Fig.&nbsp;14.4). Levels of malicious envy were 
</p>
<p>very low, probably because holidays are not 
</p>
<p>perceived as underserved, an important appraisal 
</p>
<p>for malicious envy.
</p>
<p>De Vries, M&ouml;ller, Wieringa, Eigenraam, and 
</p>
<p>Hamelink (2018) proposed an approach how the 
</p>
<p>often-contradicting predictions from emotional 
</p>
<p>contagion and social comparison theory can be 
</p>
<p>brought together. They suggested that social 
</p>
<p>comparison orientation, the chronic tendency of 
</p>
<p>people to compare themselves with others 
</p>
<p>(Gibbons &amp; Buunk, 1999), determines whether 
</p>
<p>people are happy when their social media friends 
</p>
<p>are happy or whether they experience envy. 
</p>
<p>Participants were either exposed to positive or 
</p>
<p>neutral Instagram posts. Social comparison ori-
</p>
<p>entation was measured. For people high in social 
</p>
<p>comparison orientation, the contrastive pattern 
</p>
<p>predicted by the social comparison perspective 
</p>
<p>was found: participants showed lower levels of 
</p>
<p>positive affect when exposed to positive posts. 
</p>
<p>People low in social comparison orientation 
</p>
<p>showed the opposite pattern: in line with the 
</p>
<p>emotional contagion perspective, they showed 
</p>
<p>higher positive affect when exposed to positive 
</p>
<p>posts (vs. neutral posts). Social comparison 
</p>
<p>orientation is thus a moderator that can explain 
</p>
<p>which of the two opposing theories applies for a 
</p>
<p>specific individual&nbsp; &ndash; those low in social 
</p>
<p>comparison orientation seem to share the 
</p>
<p>emotions displayed on social media, whereas 
</p>
<p>those high in social comparison orientation rather 
</p>
<p>show contrasting emotions.
</p>
<p> Taking into&nbsp;Account 
the&nbsp;Affordances of&nbsp;Social Media
</p>
<p>The studies reported so far used existing social- 
</p>
<p>psychological theories and argued that they also 
</p>
<p>hold on social media, without taking the 
</p>
<p>affordances of social media discussed in the 
</p>
<p>beginning of this chapter into account. 
</p>
<p>Affordances have been taken into account in 
</p>
<p>research on jealousy evoked by social media 
</p>
<p>posts. Jealousy is the &ldquo;negative response to the 
</p>
<p>actual, imagined or expected emotional or sexual 
</p>
<p>involvement of the partner with someone else&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Buunk, 1997, p.&nbsp; 998). Especially anxious 
</p>
<p>jealousy, i.e., ruminating about potential actions 
</p>
<p>Box 14.3 Zooming In: Benign Versus 
</p>
<p>Malicious&nbsp;Envy
</p>
<p>Although envy usually has a negative con-
</p>
<p>notation, it can also have a motivating role, 
</p>
<p>and researchers started therefore to focus on 
</p>
<p>the antecedents and consequences of benign 
</p>
<p>vs. malicious envy. The appraisal of deserv-
</p>
<p>edness is important: malicious envy is more 
</p>
<p>likely to occur when the advantage of the 
</p>
<p>envied person is perceived as undeserved; 
</p>
<p>benign envy is more likely when the advan-
</p>
<p>tage of the other is perceived as deserved 
</p>
<p>and the situation as controllable (the indi-
</p>
<p>vidual can reach the same object/state). 
</p>
<p>Malicious envy is more similar to envy in 
</p>
<p>the Smith (2000) model, whereas benign 
</p>
<p>envy has similarity with inspiration in the 
</p>
<p>upward assimilative emotions quadrant.

</p>
<p>of the partner, is negatively related to relationship 
</p>
<p>quality (Barelds &amp; Barelds-Dijkstra, 2007).
</p>
<p>When it comes to jealousy triggered by social 
</p>
<p>media, Muise, Christofides, and Desmarais (2009) 
</p>
<p>argued that Facebook makes more information 
</p>
<p>about the partner and his/her interactions with 
</p>
<p>potential rivals&nbsp; &ndash; comments, likes, or pictures&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>visible than ever before. This visibility and public 
</p>
<p>display can also influence the appraisals of threat. 
</p>
<p>Muise et&nbsp;al. (2009) therefore argued that Facebook 
</p>
<p>use could increase jealousy. They measured 
</p>
<p>Facebook elicited jealousy by a scale that asked 
</p>
<p>for the likelihood to experience jealousy in ambiv-
</p>
<p>alent situations such as &ldquo;after seeing that your 
</p>
<p>partner has received a wall message from some-
</p>
<p>one of the opposite sex&rdquo; and not in actual trans-
</p>
<p>gressions (see Table&nbsp;14.1, left column). This scale 
</p>
<p>thus covers mainly anxious jealousy. They also 
</p>
<p>assessed people&rsquo;s general disposition to react 
</p>
<p>jealously. Although this disposition predicted the 
</p>
<p>largest part of the variance in online jealousy, 
</p>
<p>time spent on Facebook explained an additional 
</p>
<p>part of variance.
</p>
<p>Utz and Beukeboom (2011) built on this work 
</p>
<p>and proposed need for popularity as an additional 
</p>
<p>predictor of jealousy experienced on SNS.&nbsp;They 
</p>
<p>argued that especially people with a high need for 
</p>
<p>popularity are attracted by social media because 
</p>
<p>their affordances allow them to present an 
</p>
<p>idealized version of their self to impress a large 
</p>
<p>audience. When the partner endangers the picture 
</p>
<p>of a happy relationship, for example, by exchanging 
</p>
<p>flirtatious comments with an attractive person, 
</p>
<p>the (semi-)public display of this action at least 
</p>
<p>within the group of close peers might influence the 
</p>
<p>appraisal of severity of the threat to the relation-
</p>
<p>ship and thereby increase the feeling of jealousy. 
</p>
<p>Research on offline jealousy has found that public 
</p>
<p>self-threats are perceived as more severe (Afifi, 
</p>
<p>Falato, &amp; Weiner, 2001).
</p>
<p>Utz and Beukeboom (2011) aimed to get a 
</p>
<p>more comprehensive picture and argued that in a 
</p>
<p>similar vein public displays of affection by the 
</p>
<p>partner might increase happiness with the relation-
</p>
<p>ship because these could be appraised as a sign of 
</p>
<p>commitment. SNS happiness was measured by 
</p>
<p>mirroring the SNS jealousy items (see Table&nbsp;14.1, 
</p>
<p>right column). The results showed that people in 
</p>
<p>general expressed higher levels of SNS happiness 
</p>
<p>than SNS jealousy. Need for popularity was 
</p>
<p>related to SNS jealousy, especially among low 
</p>
<p>self-esteem individuals, indicating that the affor-
</p>
<p>dances of social media are interpreted differently 
</p>
<p>by people with low vs. high need for popularity 
</p>
<p>or self-esteem.
</p>
<p>The relationship between need for popularity 
</p>
<p>and social media jealousy was replicated in 
</p>
<p>another study that compared jealousy on Facebook 
</p>
<p>and Snapchat (Utz, Muscanell, &amp; Khalid, 2015). 
</p>
<p>In contrast to other social media, messages on 
</p>
<p>snapchat are not persistent, but disappear after 
</p>
<p>several seconds. Again, this affordance can influ-
</p>
<p>ence the appraisal of acts such as communicating 
</p>
<p>with an ex-partner. People might become more 
</p>
<p>suspicious when the partner uses Snapchat and 
</p>
<p>assume that the flirt must be serious if a secret 
</p>
<p>communication channel is chosen. In line with 
</p>
<p>these predictions, Snapchat jealousy was higher 
</p>
<p>than Facebook jealousy.

</p>
<p> Facebook and&nbsp;Envy: Application 
to&nbsp;Consumer Behavior
</p>
<p>Why is knowledge about the emotions triggered 
</p>
<p>by social media use so important? First, emotions 
</p>
<p>influence well-being, and it has often been argued 
</p>
<p>that reading social media posts leads to envy 
</p>
<p>which in turn leads to lowered well-being 
</p>
<p>(Verduyn et&nbsp; al., 2017). Second, emotions also 
</p>
<p>influence consumer behavior. The business model 
</p>
<p>of most social media platforms is making money 
</p>
<p>from selling advertisements. For brands, it is thus 
</p>
<p>important to know how purchase intentions of 
</p>
<p>customers could be influenced. The default 
</p>
<p>approach is often to target ads to specific groups 
</p>
<p>(e.g., females aged 21&ndash;25 interested in beauty 
</p>
<p>and fashion). A smarter way could be to use posts 
</p>
<p>from social media friends as triggers for ads.
</p>
<p>Research on benign vs. malicious envy has 
</p>
<p>found that benign envy motivates people to buy 
</p>
<p>the same product as the envied person has, 
</p>
<p>whereas malicious envy motivates people to buy 
</p>
<p>a different and even superior product to distance 
</p>
<p>themselves from the envied target (Van de Ven, 
</p>
<p>Zeelenberg, &amp; Pieters, 2010). Lin (2018) 
</p>
<p>examined whether this also applies on social 
</p>
<p>media. She distinguished between experiential 
</p>
<p>and material purchases (Van Boven &amp; Gilovich, 
</p>
<p>2003). Material purchases (e.g., an expensive 
</p>
<p>watch, jewelry, a car) are bought &ldquo;to have,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>whereas experiential purchases (e.g., a weekend 
</p>
<p>trip) are bought &ldquo;to be.&rdquo; Lin (2018) argued that 
</p>
<p>experiential purchases might trigger more benign 
</p>
<p>envy because they are often appraised as self- 
</p>
<p>relevant and trigger liking of the other person.
</p>
<p>To examine how envy triggered by social 
</p>
<p>media use influences consumer behavior, Lin 
</p>
<p>conducted a survey among 200 active social 
</p>
<p>media users (100 females; mean age&nbsp;=&nbsp;35). The 
</p>
<p>majority of respondents (n&nbsp; =&nbsp; 136) had already 
</p>
<p>purchased something after browsing social 
</p>
<p>media; most of them had done so several times. 
</p>
<p>Purchasing behavior was more frequently 
</p>
<p>triggered by posts from friends (58) than by posts 
</p>
<p>from brands or ads (31). In the remaining cases, 
</p>
<p>the triggers could not be clearly identified. These 
</p>
<p>descriptive data already suggest that social media 
</p>
<p>posts influence consumer behavior.
</p>
<p>Participants read a definition of experiential 
</p>
<p>vs. material products and were asked how often 
</p>
<p>they encounter posts about these two types of 
</p>
<p>purchases in their timeline. On average, they saw 
</p>
<p>posts about experiential purchases several times a 
</p>
<p>week and posts about material purchases between 
</p>
<p>once and several times a week.
</p>
<p>Next, they were asked to recall a situation in 
</p>
<p>which they experienced envy after being exposed 
</p>
<p>to such a post. The vast majority (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;185) was 
</p>
<p>able to recall such a situation, indicating that 
</p>
<p>envy about the purchases and experiences of 
</p>
<p>others is a common experience. Most purchases 
</p>
<p>(120) were experiential in nature, predominantly 
</p>
<p>vacations, restaurant visits, or similar events. 
</p>
<p>Posts about material purchases (48) were on 
</p>
<p>cameras, laptops, cars, or houses.
</p>
<p>The type of experienced envy (benign vs. 
</p>
<p>malicious) was measured with the scale by 
</p>
<p>Crusius and Lange (2014). A sample item for 
</p>
<p>benign envy is &ldquo;I felt inspired to also attain X&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(X stands for the product/experience mentioned 
</p>
<p>by the participant); a sample item for malicious 
</p>
<p>envy is &ldquo;I wished that the person would fail at 
</p>
<p>something.&rdquo; The central dependent variables 
</p>
<p>were the purchase intention for the same and the 
</p>
<p>purchase intention for a superior product (e.g., 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&nbsp; is very likely that I will buy the same X/a 
</p>
<p> similar but superior product/service&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>People experienced more benign envy than 
</p>
<p>malicious envy. Interestingly and in contrast to 
</p>
<p>the hypothesis, there was no relationship between 
</p>
<p>post type (experiential vs. material) and type of 
</p>
<p>envy. Exploratory analysis showed that malicious 
</p>
<p>envy was higher when the self-relevance of the 
</p>
<p>purchase was high. The pattern for appraisals was 
</p>
<p>however as expected: when participants felt that 
</p>
<p>the person who has posted the purchase or expe-
</p>
<p>rience had not deserved the purchase, just wanted 
</p>
<p>to show off, was disliked but also similar to the 
</p>
<p>participants, malicious envy was higher. Most 
</p>
<p>important, in line with the hypotheses, benign 
</p>
<p>envy was positively correlated with purchase 
</p>
<p>intentions for the same product, whereas mali-
</p>
<p>cious envy was related to purchase intention for a 
</p>
<p>superior product.
</p>
<p>A limitation of the self-report study is that 
</p>
<p>people mentioned more experiential than material 
</p>
<p>14 Social Media as&nbsp;Sources of&nbsp;Emotions</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>216
</p>
<p>purchases, resulting in reduced power to find 
</p>
<p>effects for material purchases. The purchases 
</p>
<p>also varied widely in price, desirability, and many 
</p>
<p>other factors. To get more equal sample sizes, in 
</p>
<p>a second study, participants were asked to either 
</p>
<p>remember a post about an experiential purchase 
</p>
<p>or a post about a material purchase. To control for 
</p>
<p>the different types of purchases, a third study was 
</p>
<p>conducted in which the same product, a MacBook 
</p>
<p>Pro, was framed either in experiential or material 
</p>
<p>terms. The post in the experiential condition read 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;My new Macbook Pro makes me enjoy my work! 
</p>
<p>#ExploreAndDiscover #DoMore,&rdquo; whereas the 
</p>
<p>post in the material condition read &ldquo;My new 
</p>
<p>Macbook Pro looks just awesome! #ExpensiveBuy 
</p>
<p>#MustHave.&rdquo; The main finding that benign envy 
</p>
<p>predicts purchase intentions for buying the same 
</p>
<p>product and malicious envy triggers purchase 
</p>
<p>intentions for buying an even superior product was 
</p>
<p>replicated in both studies.
</p>
<p>Taken together, across three studies using dif-
</p>
<p>ferent methods, Lin (2018) showed that people 
</p>
<p>experience more benign than malicious envy when 
</p>
<p>exposed to social media posts about experiential or 
</p>
<p>material purchases. The more participants experi-
</p>
<p>enced benign envy, the higher also was their inten-
</p>
<p>tion to purchase the same product. Malicious envy, 
</p>
<p>in contrast, was triggered by the perceived inten-
</p>
<p>tion to show off and lead to the desire to purchase 
</p>
<p>a superior product.
</p>
<p>These results can directly be translated into 
</p>
<p>advice for brands. Instead of showing ads to target 
</p>
<p>user groups based on demographics and interests, 
</p>
<p>brands should (also) post ads next to relevant 
</p>
<p>posts. This could be especially interesting for 
</p>
<p>travel agencies but also for fashion manufacturers 
</p>
<p>or tech companies. Social media platforms would 
</p>
<p>need to adapt their targeting services and offer tar-
</p>
<p>geted marketing based on relevance of users&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>posts. Users often provide information about their 
</p>
<p>location by using check- ins or hashtags in their 
</p>
<p>posts, making it easy to find the appropriate posts 
</p>
<p>for restaurants, bars, or hotels. Algorithms are 
</p>
<p>also getting better and better in analyzing pic-
</p>
<p>tures. Although malicious envy is unlikely to 
</p>
<p>occur, searching for hashtags that refer to showing 
</p>
<p>off (see, e.g., #richkidsofinstagram) could be an 
</p>
<p>indicator of potential malicious envy. This would 
</p>
<p>be the place for luxury brands to advertise their 
</p>
<p>superior products.
</p>
<p>To conclude, this chapter has shown that posts 
</p>
<p>on social media trigger emotions in both the peo-
</p>
<p>ple who post them and the people who read them. 
</p>
<p>Being able to predict the emotions experienced 
</p>
<p>by social media users also helps brands because 
</p>
<p>emotions experience consumer behavior.

<p>Social comparison as the thief of joy: 
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Sharing positive emotions on social media 
</p>
<p>further intensifies positive emotions, a 
</p>
<p>process known as capitalization.
</p>
<p>&bull; Posts from close friends usually result in 
</p>
<p>emotional contagion: people feel good 
</p>
<p>when their friends feel good.
</p>
<p>&bull; Positive posts on social media can trig-
</p>
<p>ger social comparison processes and 
</p>
<p>(benign) envy.
</p>
<p>&bull; The affordances of social media, espe-
</p>
<p>cially visibility, can intensify jealousy.
</p>
<p>&bull; Social comparison orientation and self-
</p>
<p>esteem moderate these effects: people 
</p>
<p>with low social comparison orientation/
</p>
<p>high self-esteem experience positive 
</p>
<p>emotions when exposed to positive posts 
</p>
<p>from friends, whereas people with high 
</p>
<p>social comparison orientation/low self-
</p>
<p>esteem experience envy.
</p>
<p>&bull; Envy also influences consumer behav-
</p>
<p>ior; benign envy increases the intention 
</p>
<p>to buy the same product the envied 
</p>
<p>person has.

<p> Guiding Answers to&nbsp;Questions 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Q (With Box 14.2) A joy shared is a joy dou-
</p>
<p>bled, a trouble shared is a trouble halved. 
</p>
<p>Does this proverb also hold for sharing joys 
</p>
<p>and troubles on social media?
</p>
<p>A: The first part of this proverb corresponds to 
</p>
<p>capitalization. Sharing a joy with close others 
</p>
<p>intensifies the joy, and this has also been found 
</p>
<p>for social media posts. Research on emotional 
</p>
<p>contagion showed that readers also become 
</p>
<p>happy when their friends share positive expe-
</p>
<p>riences. Findings on sharing troubles have 
</p>
<p>been less unequivocal; sharing troubles 
</p>
<p>might&nbsp; &ndash; at least in the short run&nbsp; &ndash; intensify 
</p>
<p>negative emotions.
</p>
<p> 2. Q (With Box 14.4) What advice would you 
</p>
<p>give platform providers to increase the well- 
</p>
<p>being of their users?
</p>
<p>A: Platform providers could mainly display 
</p>
<p>the positive posts from close friends. Closeness 
</p>
<p>can be inferred automatically from frequency 
</p>
<p>of private messages, being tagged on the same 
</p>
<p>photo, and mutual likes. Posts with hashtags 
</p>
<p>that are likely to trigger malicious envy (e.g., 
</p>
<p>#richkids) could be displayed less promi-
</p>
<p>nently in the newsfeed.
</p>
<p> 3. Q (With Box 14.4) What can teachers or 
</p>
<p> parents do to reduce the risk that their children 
</p>
<p>experience negative emotions after using 
</p>
<p>social media?
</p>
<p>A: Teachers and parents could train the media 
</p>
<p>literacy of children/adolescents by making 
</p>
<p>them aware that people present themselves in 
</p>
<p>an idealized way on social media. They could 
</p>
<p>teach them to use social media actively for rela-
</p>
<p>tionship maintenance, instead of mainly pas-
</p>
<p>sively browsing. Strengthening the self-esteem 
</p>
<p>provides them also with a buffer against nega-
</p>
<p>tive effects of social media posts.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that we live in a vengeful world. 
But that is not the full story. If, following a hurt, 
vengefulness were the only force to govern our 
social relations, how could this account for Gill 
Hicks, who lost both her legs due to standing next 
to one of the London tube suicide bombers in 2005 
yet lives without hatred and refuses to seek revenge; 
or how come that Bassam Aramin chooses dia-
logue and non-violence as the main means to 
resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, despite an 
Israeli soldier shooting and killing Bassam&rsquo;s 
10-year-old daughter outside her school; and how 
come that on hearing the tragic news of her 28-year-
old son, an Israeli soldier, being shot dead by a 
Palestinian sniper, the first words that came out of 
Robi Damelin&rsquo;s mouth were: &lsquo;Do not take revenge 
in the name of my son&rsquo;? While maybe absent from 
the news headlines, there are many more such 
individuals, like Gill, Bassam, and Robi, around 
the world. You can find out about their real-life 
stories in the work of the London-based charity 
The Forgiveness Project (www.theforgiveness-
project.com, see also www.theforgivenesstool-
box.com), whose aim is to collect and document 
the lived experiences of ordinary people who 
have managed to overcome their hatred and 
resentment towards their perpetrators and to 
develop working relationships or even profound 
friendships with their former perpetrators.</p>

</p>
<p>What is noteworthy is that the individuals 
responsible for the above atrocities neither knew 
their victims personally nor had any prior direct 
interactions with them. What gave rise to these 
atrocities was the fact that the aggressors saw 
their unknown victims as representatives of par-
ticular groups with whom the aggressors had fun-
damental disagreements. It is probably a safe bet 
to assume that part of the motivation that leads 
individuals to harm others is to do with the 
aggressors themselves feeling aggrieved and vic-
timised. Thus, correcting the wrongs victims may 
have experienced directly or vicariously (i.e. see-
ing their fellow ingroup members being harmed) 
can rather ironically cause previous victims to 
become future victimisers and feed the endless 
cycles of revenge. Can forgiveness disrupt such 
destructive cycles?
</p>
<p>Although forgiveness has mainly been dis-
cussed and practised in the realm of interpersonal 
relationships, in this chapter, we focus on forgive-
ness and its utility for repairing damaged inter-
group relationships. Specifically, we will analyse 
intergroup forgiveness through the lens of tradi-
tional and recent theoretical frameworks, such as 
the social identity approach and victim beliefs, 
while attempting to formalise the interplay 
between such theorising and their implications for 
societies emerging from ethnopolitical violence. 
We will conclude by highlighting how forgive-
ness can transform fractured intergroup relations 
into peaceful co-existence at a practical level.
</p>
<p> Collective Suffering: Hurting Me 
Versus&nbsp;Hurting Us
</p>
<p>Naturally, being hurt means being robbed of con-
trol over one&rsquo;s life. Indeed, following a hurt, what 
may attract millions of people to revenge is the 
desire to restore their diminished sense of con-
trol. But is revenge the only path to restoring con-
trol? And can forgiveness provide an alternative 
and less explored route to such control restora-
tion? Before discussing the concept of intergroup 
forgiveness, it is important to understand what 
constitutes collective suffering.
</p>
<p>Experiences of suffering are heightened to 
the collective level because of the clashing 
group memberships with which the harmdoer 
and his/her victim identify. As detailed by 
Scheepers and Ellemers in this volume (Chap. 
9; see also Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979), people 
divide the social world into social categories, 
such as religious beliefs, political or sexual 
orientation, race, etc. Individuals form groups 
on the basis of these categories and identify 
with them because such categories can help us 
understand who we are and because these cat-
egories enable us to coact with others, invoke 
solidarity, and provide us with protection 
against different types of threats. Thus, a key 
defining feature of collective suffering is that 
the motivation to harm others was driven by 
the perpetrator&rsquo;s group membership and his/
her choice of victim was equally determined 
by the victim&rsquo;s particular group membership 
(Noor et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p>Another feature of collective suffering is that 
it can affect the target group across several dimen-
sions, including the physical dimension (e.g. 
physical well-being, quality of life, physical inju-
ries, deaths), the material dimension (e.g. destruc-
tion or loss of property, ability to build wealth), 
and the cultural dimension (e.g. threat to one&rsquo;s 
worldview, cultural continuity, norms, language), 
and each of the forgoing dimensions, by them-
selves or combined, can lead to the psychological 
dimension of suffering (e.g. trauma or distress) 
</p>
<p>Definition Box
</p>
<p>Collective Suffering: (also referred to as 
collective victimisation) This results from 
collective victimization which involves the 
objective infliction of harm by one group 
against another. The psychological experi-
ence and consequences (e.g., affect, cogni-
tions, and behaviors) of such harm is 
referred to as collective victimhood 
(WHO, 2002, p.&nbsp; 215; see also Noor,

et&nbsp;al., 2017, for reviews).
</p>
<p>The plethora of ways in which one group can 
harm another gives rise to the third feature of col-
lective suffering, namely, the impact of the suf-
fering extends to group members who did not 
experience the harmdoing directly. In fact, the 
more group members identify with the group, 
the more they feel the impact of the harm vicari-
ously, even though they may have been in differ-
ent geographical locations from the direct 
ingroup victims or born several decades after the 
harmdoing (e.g. Lickel, Miller, Stenstrom, 
Denson, &amp; Schmader, 2006; Noor, Brown, 
Gonzalez, Manzi, &amp; Lewis, 2008; Wohl &amp; 
Branscombe, 2008; Wohl &amp; van Bavel, 2011). 
To illustrate, research investigating how the trau-
matic consequences of collective victimisation 
resulting from the Jewish Holocaust get transmit-
ted across generations found that there was a 
positive correlation between the Holocaust 
descendants&rsquo; degree of Jewish identification and 
symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder. This 
correlation was negative for non-Holocaust 
descendants (Wohl &amp; van Bavel, 2011). That 
said, an important caveat must be highlighted 
here. Identification with a victimised group can 
also serve as a buffer against poor psychological 
well-being. Supporting evidence for this claim 
has been provided by studies examining the 
association between pervasive discrimination of 
target groups (e.g. Black Americans, Latino/
Americans, the elderly) and their psychological 
well-being (Branscombe, Schmitt, &amp; Harvey, 
1999; Cronin, Levin, Branscombe, van Laar, &amp; 
Tropp, 2012; Garstka, Schmitt, Branscombe, &amp; 
Hummert, 2004). Interestingly, these studies 
demonstrated that ingroup identification with the 
target groups suppressed the association between 
discrimination and poor well-being. This sug-
gests that identification with a victimised group 
need not always foretell negative outcomes for 
the group members.
</p>
<p>So far, we have explored how groups vested in 
their social identities may be motivated to harm 
one another, across multiple dimensions, and 
</p>
<p>how readily the suffering can spread to other 
ingroup members who did not experience the 
harmdoing directly. Although understanding col-
lective suffering through the lens of the social 
identity approach offers important analytical 
insights into why some conflicts persist, in the 
next section, we complement these insights by 
drawing attention to the recent theorising about 
victim beliefs&nbsp;&ndash; the stories groups tell about their 
suffering&nbsp;&ndash; and consider their impact in terms of 
intensifying or reducing conflict.
</p>
<p> Victim Beliefs: The&nbsp;Stories We&nbsp;Tell 
about&nbsp;Our Suffering
</p>
<p>Stories are powerful, especially if they are sto-
ries about the collective suffering of one&rsquo;s own 
group. Such stories enable people to make 
meaning of what happened, remind future gen-
erations of the ingroup&rsquo;s victimisation, and 
instil a powerful sense of common fate and soli-
darity with their fellow ingroup members. 
Consequently, the stories of a group&rsquo;s collective 
suffering are representational and can shape the 
group&rsquo;s identity in general. What is intriguing is 
that people can tell very different stories about 
the same experience. In other words, people can 
construe the same victimhood event very differ-
ently, which in turn can have a differential 
impact on people&rsquo;s understanding of their col-
lective suffering and who they are as a group, 
but also on how they relate to other groups. 
Recent theorising has reasoned that the way a 
group&rsquo;s narrative of their suffering is construed 
is partly determined by their victim beliefs 
(Noor et&nbsp; al., 2012; Vollhardt, 2012, 2015; see 
also Noor et&nbsp;al., 2017).

</p>
<p> Comparative Victim Beliefs
</p>
<p>One central set of victim beliefs are the compara-
tive victim beliefs. Such beliefs orient groups to 
think about their suffering by comparing it to 
other groups&rsquo; suffering. Unfortunately, given 
groups are prone to compete with one other, 
especially over as sensitive a topic as their suffer-
ing (Noor et&nbsp;al., 2012), such a comparative belief 
has been observed to give rise to groups engaging 
in the phenomenon of intergroup competitive 
victimhood.
</p>
<p>Competitive victimhood arises from the 
motivation of conflicting groups to establish that 
the ingroup has suffered more than the outgroup. 
Here, the emphasis is not only placed on the 
quantity of the suffering but also on the unjust 
quality of the suffering. At first glance, such com-
petition over victimhood may appear counter- 
intuitive, especially because the victim status is 
often associated with weakness and humiliation. 
However, when viewing victimhood as a psycho-
logical resource which can serve groups with key 
psychological and social functions, competitive 
victimhood no longer appears counter-intuitive.
</p>
<p>To illustrate, assuming the role of the &lsquo;bigger&rsquo; 
victim can entitle groups to justify ingroup vio-
lence against other groups (Noor, Brown, &amp; 
Prentice, 2008). From a leadership perspective, 
strategically portraying one&rsquo;s groups as the 
(greater) victim provides leaders with powerful 
narratives which they can utilise to bolster ingroup 
cohesiveness and identification with the ingroup 
and ultimately mobilise their ingroup to take 
actions against the outgroup. In the post- conflict 
setting, competitive victimhood can enable groups 
to avoid negative emotions for their ingroup 
wrongdoings during the heightened phase of the 
conflict and help them deny responsibility and 
any material compensation. Consequently, an 
inverse relationship can be expected between 
competitive victimhood and forgiveness. That is, 
the stiffer the competition over victimhood among 
conflicting groups, the less likely conflicting 
</p>
<p>Box 15.1 Zooming In: Whose Story Counts?
</p>
<p>As you can imagine, one controversy around 
victim beliefs is about which group&rsquo;s story is 
believed or perceived as true. This is in part 
due to the subjective nature of victim beliefs, 
which are asserted by one group and chal-
lenged by their adversarial group. As a 
result, many historical narratives about a 
collective victimisation remain contested 
(Vollhardt, 2012) (e.g. Palestinian vs. Israeli 
stories of suffering, Hammack, 2009). Note 
also that both disadvantaged groups and the 
advantaged groups (e.g. Black as well as 
White Americans) can develop victim 
beliefs. Crucially, another consequence of 
victim beliefs is that sometimes objectively 
true victimisation of one group may be sup-
pressed or ignored (e.g. the Genocide of 
Herero and Nama in Namibia by Germany 
in the nineteenth century, Onishi, 2016), 
while at other times false victim beliefs of 
another group may be fabricated (e.g. Nazis&rsquo; 
perceived victimisation, Herf, 2006).

<p>Intergroup competitive victimhood: 
Refers to the effort by group members

</p>
<p>sarial group (Noor et&nbsp; al., 2012; Noor, 
Brown, &amp; Prentice, 2008). This competi-
tion can focus on both the quantity and 
quality of suffering. Groups can compete 
over their share of suffering across differ-
ent dimensions, including the physical 
dimension (e.g. death toll or injuries), the 
material dimension (e.g. loss of resources), 
the cultural dimension (e.g. giving up one&rsquo;s 
way of life and language), the psychological 
dimension (e.g. trauma and poor psycho-
logical well-being), and the moral dimension 
(e.g. perceived illegitimacy of suffering).

<p>groups are to consider forgiving one another 
(Noor, Brown, Gonzalez, et&nbsp; al., 2008; see Noor 
et&nbsp;al., 2012, for a review).
</p>
<p>The opposing victim belief to competitive vic-
timhood is common victimhood (Noor et&nbsp; al., 
2012, 2017; Schnabel, Halabi, &amp; Noor, 2013), 
also referred to as inclusive victim consciousness 
(Vollhardt, 2015).
</p>
<p>This belief draws both group&rsquo;s attention to 
their common suffering due to the (regional) con-
flict and thereby succeeds in acknowledging that, 
similar to the ingroup, the outgroup has suffered 
as well, albeit possibly in different ways from the 
ingroup. For example, consider the lives of 
Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East. 
Clearly, compared to Palestinians, Israelis are in 
an advantageous position militarily, among other 
respects. However, despite such an obvious 
advantage, it is difficult to discard the fact that 
irrespective of their position, Israelis&rsquo; quality of 
life has been adversely affected by the regional 
war, be that in terms of mental health, economi-
cally and across other social dimensions. Put dif-
ferently, if the urge to engage in competitive 
victimhood generally arises from the motivation 
to receive sufficient acknowledgement for one&rsquo;s 
ingroup suffering, common victimhood provides 
such an acknowledgement for both conflicting 
groups right at the outset, thereby potentially dif-
fusing unnecessary competitiveness, tension, and 
</p>
<p>hostility between the conflicting groups. As such, 
a positive relationship between common victim-
hood and forgiveness can be expected.
</p>
<p> We Are Our Beliefs
</p>
<p>As is apparent from the previous discussion, 
there is an important interplay between a group&rsquo;s 
victimhood beliefs and their social identity. In 
fact, in part the very beliefs about their victim-
hood may provide the content of groups&rsquo; social 
identities, and indeed the level of inclusiveness of 
these identities may vary as a function of such 
(competitive vs. inclusive) victimhood beliefs. 
Specifically, construing one&rsquo;s ingroup suffering 
through the competitive victimhood mindset 
may indicate that the group is likely to operate 
from a narrower and more exclusive social iden-
tity category, and therefore the group&rsquo;s focus and 
concerns extend to its fellow ingroup members 
only. By contrast, applying an inclusive victim 
belief to making sense of one&rsquo;s ingroup suffering 
entails that the group&rsquo;s awareness of suffering is 
elevated to a superordinate and more inclusive 
social identity category, and therefore the group&rsquo;s

<p>Common Victimhood: This belief is based 
on the premise that despite the clash 
between two conflicting groups (e.g. 
Israelis and Palestinians), they can come to 
agree that the conflict involves negative 
consequences for both groups&rsquo; lives (inse-
curity, unstable economy, etc.). This belief 
is expected to transform the adversaries&rsquo; 
perceptions from rigid and mutually exclu-
sive victim-versus-perpetrator category 
into a more inclusive &lsquo;we&rsquo; (i.e. both parties 
are victims of the conflict).

<p> Intergroup Forgiveness
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the benefits revenge can offer to 
victimised groups (see Box 15.4), there are a 
number of fundamental problems associated with 
revenge. To begin with, all human perceptions 
are subjective and often non-veridical. This is 
especially true when it comes to perceptions of 
suffering and its severity, which systematically 
vary as a function of victim-perpetrator roles 
(Baumeister, 1996; Kearns &amp; Fincham, 2005; 
Zechmeister &amp; Romero, 2002; see also Hornsey, 
Okimoto, &amp; Wenzel, 2017). That is, relative to 
perpetrators, victims often view the suffering as 
intentional and severe. Consequently, the question

<p>Box 15.3 Zooming In: Hierarchy of Grief in 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland
</p>
<p>The violent conflict between the Protestant 
and Catholic communities in Northern 
Ireland is epitomised in the dissensus con-
cerning each community&rsquo;s desires for 
Northern Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional future 
(Dixon, 2001; Hewstone et&nbsp;al., 2004). The 
Protestant community, who are the histori-
cally advantaged group, wishes for 
Northern Ireland to remain part of the 
UK.&nbsp;By contrast, the Catholic community, 
who are the historically disadvantaged 
group, desires the reunification of Northern 
Ireland with the rest of Ireland, thus aiming 
to undo the partition which took place in 
1921. As a result of this dispute, a violent 
conflict has been fought for more than three 
decades, claiming almost 4000 lives (Fay, 
Morrissey, &amp; Smyth, 1999). Even in 
today&rsquo;s post-peace agreement era, Northern 
Ireland is characterised as a divided society 
displaying intermittent episodes of sectar-
ian violence, intergroup distrust, and high 
levels of social segregation (Connolly &amp; 
Healy, 2003; Darby &amp; MacGinty, 2000; 
Dixon, 2001; Hewstone et&nbsp; al., 2008; 
Schubotz, 2005). Although in theory the 
notion of a common victimhood should 
benefit the conflicting groups in Northern 
Ireland, a recent event triggered by a rec-
ommendation put forward to the Northern 
Irish government reveals the challenges 
when attempting to put the concept of com-
mon victimhood into practice. The recom-
mendation was for the government to pay 
&pound;12,000&nbsp;in compensation to the families of 
everyone who had lost their lives due to the 
conflict. Crucially, this compensation was 
to be offered to victims from both sides of 
</p>
<p>the conflict&nbsp; &ndash; regardless of whether the 
victim was an innocent bystander, a British 
soldier, police officer, or a member of a 
paramilitary organisation. In other words, 
the recommendation was proactively aimed 
at promoting the notion that &lsquo;there is no 
difference in a mother&rsquo;s tears&rsquo; and that 
there can be no &lsquo;hierarchy of grief&rsquo; over the 
loss of her loved ones. As well intended as 
such a recommendation was, it entirely 
backfired. Both sides of the conflict were 
outraged by the compensation being 
extended to the &lsquo;other side&rsquo;, especially to 
their violent members such as paramilitar-
ies or armed forces. Such reactions highlight 
that in certain contexts conflicting groups 
may not easily give up their tendency to 
engage in competitive victimhood in order 
to embrace the notion of common victim-
hood, thereby acknowledging their mutual 
suffering (Anger of Troubles payment plan, 
2009).

<p>of what might constitute a fair punishment 
becomes rather divisive. Often, victims are likely 
to view the punishment as too lenient, while per-
petrators perceive the same punishment as too 
harsh. The basis for such self- or ingroup-serving 
biases is rooted in perspective divergences that 
tend to give rise to differential causal attributions 
and evaluations between actors and recipients of 
aggressive actions (Mummendey, Linneweber, &amp; 
L&ouml;schper, 1984; see also Noor, Kteily, Siem, &amp; 
Mazziotta, 2018). Consequently, such perspec-
tive divergences can contribute to a role reversal 
in that the original perpetrators may feel a pro-
found sense of victimhood as a result of perceiv-
ing the punishment as excessive, while the initial 
victims become bloodthirsty; thereby both parties 
contribute to further harmdoing and deepen their 
initial enmity (Minow, 1998; Noor et&nbsp; al., 2012; 
Noor &amp; Cantacuzino, 2018).
</p>
<p>Revenge also faces the problem of scale, par-
ticularly in contexts of intergroup mass violence. 
That is, societies such as those in Rwanda or 
South Africa are left with hundreds of thousands 
of perpetrators and with an even larger number of 
victims. Such sheer scale of perpetration and 
</p>
<p>suffering demonstrates the decreased value of 
revenge as a strategy to break through the chaos 
of intergroup violence and restore order in society 
(Tutu, 2012). Perhaps the most compelling point 
highlighting the futility of revenge is the fact 
that revenge cannot reverse the damage that was 
initially done (Noor &amp; Cantacuzino, 2018).
</p>
<p>Given the outlined shortcomings of revenge 
and the catalysing effect of major world events, 
such as the collapse of totalitarian regimes in 
South Africa, Chile, and Eastern Europe and the 
ongoing violent conflicts, new ways of trans-
forming divided societies into peaceful co- 
existing ones are much sought after. Conflict 
transformation also requires finding adequate 
ways to address trauma and loss both at personal 
and collective levels. It is for these reasons that 
attention has been drawn to the utility of forgive-
ness as a strategy to bring about the much desired 
peaceful transformation both in societies with 
ongoing intergroup conflict and in post-conflict 
societies.
</p>
<p>Box 15.4 Zooming In: The Benefits of 
</p>
<p>Revenge
</p>
<p>Taking revenge as a strategy may provide 
victims with a number of advantages: first, 
revenge enables victims to get even. 
Getting even is often about correcting the 
wrong the victims experienced, thereby 
achieving a sense of justice. However, per-
haps more importantly, getting even also 
serves victims in a symbolic way by teach-
ing the perpetrator group a lesson that they 
will not forget (Gollwitzer &amp; Denzler, 
2009), thereby protecting victims from 
future harms. All of the above, psychologi-
cally speaking, can help to restore victims&rsquo; 
sense of control and agency which may 
have been diminished by being harmed in 
the first place (Noor &amp; Cantacuzino, 2018).
</p>
<p>Box 15.5 Zooming In: When Victims Become 
</p>
<p>Killers in the Rwandan Context
</p>
<p>One of the most challenging questions to 
answer relates to why those who have 
endured great suffering may become 
involved in harming and indeed killing oth-
ers. &lsquo;When victims become killers&rsquo; is part 
of the title of a book by Mahmood Mamdani 
(2001) in which the author attempts to pro-
vide an answer to this question in the con-
text the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Despite 
having endured a mass killing in 1972, the 
Hutu majority killed an estimated 800,000 
of the Tutsi minority and moderate Hutu. 
Mamdani seeks to trace back such tragedies 
to their historical roots such as arbitrary 
land boundaries and racialised status differ-
ences between Hutu and Tutsi introduced 
and nurtured by the European colonisers, 
coupled with a poor economy.

<p>15 Intergroup Forgiveness: The&nbsp;Interplay Between Who We&nbsp;Are and&nbsp;What Tales We&nbsp;Tell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>228
</p>
<p>Although our understanding of intergroup 
forgiveness continues to evolve, recently Noor 
(2016) has embarked on developing an integra-
tive approach to conceptualizing forgiveness. 
Accordingly, the process of forgiveness involves 
making a conscious decision which is determined 
by multiple factors. First, the decision to forgive 
hinges on the extent to which the victimised 
group can regulate their negative emotions and 
thoughts about the perpetrator group. Second, a 
group&rsquo;s forgiveness is further determined by the 
extent to which the victimised group values their 
relationship with the perpetrator group (Burnette, 
McCullough, Van Tongeren, &amp; Davis, 2012), as 
well as the extent to which they view the perpe-
trator group as a continued source of threat. 
That is, forgiveness is likely to occur when the 
perpetrator group is viewed as a potentially valu-
able partner and perceived as nonthreatening 
(Noor, Shnabel, Halabi, &amp; Doosje, 2015). Finally, 
the decision to forgive may in part also depend 
on the extent to which the victimised group can 
imagine that the perpetrator group is capable of 
changing their hostile traits and behaviours 
(Wohl et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p>Although this multi-faceted approach to under-
standing intergroup forgiveness demonstrates the 
complexities associated with forgiveness, the dif-
ferent dimensions point to a common denomina-
tor that can be viewed as the key prerequisite for 
forgiveness, namely, forgiveness requires trans-
formation involving (a) how the victimised group 
perceives the perpetrator group; (b) how the per-
petrator group behaves, especially with regard to 
how they treat the victimised group in the future; 
and (c) the contextual factors (e.g. economic dis-
parity) that may have given rise to the initial har-
mdoing (Noor, 2016; Noor &amp; Cantacuzino, 2018). 
</p>
<p>Thus, the decision to forgive at the intergroup 
level involves a bigger conversation than in the 
interpersonal context, which necessarily involves 
negotiating with your fellow ingroup members 
and assessing the degree to which forgiveness 
may be consistent with your ingroup moral values 
and norms.
</p>
<p>Having described the process involving the 
decision to forgive a group, in the remainder of 
this chapter, we focus on real-life interventions 
based on the theories discussed earlier in this 
chapter. For each intervention, we first outline its 
theoretical rationale, briefly sketch the intergroup 
context, and summarise the major findings of the 
interventions. Although psychological interven-
tions can vary in scale and scope (Paluck &amp; 
Green, 2009), below we report studies that have 
tested psychological models in contexts of past or 
ongoing intergroup conflicts.

<p>Modelled on existing measures of interper-

an intergroup forgiveness measure based 
on six items, used in both ongoing and 
post-conflict settings, such as Israel-
Palestine, Northern Ireland, and Chile:

<p>1. &lsquo;I try not to hold a grudge against the 
other group for their misdeeds&rsquo;.

</p>
<p> Interventions: How Victim Beliefs 
and&nbsp;Identity Interact
</p>
<p>As established earlier, both direct and vicarious 
victimhood episodes are psychologically potent 
experiences and will affect our understanding of 
the self and other groups. More specifically, it is 
plausible that when groups construe their victi-
misation through the comparative lens, it is likely 
to lead to competitive victimhood (&lsquo;we have 
suffered more than the outgroup&rsquo;) among the 
conflicting groups (Noor et&nbsp;al., 2012). Moreover, 
drawing on the social identity theory (Tajfel &amp; 
Turner, 1979), it is also plausible to predict that 
such a competitive construal of one&rsquo;s victimhood 
is likely to strengthen one&rsquo;s identification with 
the ingroup, because a bolstered ingroup identifi-
cation could serve individuals with protection 
against future threats. Crucially, an emboldened 
and protective bond with one&rsquo;s ingroup could 
also reduce our propensity to forgive perpetrator 
outgroups.
</p>
<p>To test these predictions, a study was con-
ducted in the context of the sectarian intergroup 
conflict between Protestants and Catholics in 
Northern Ireland. Although Northern Ireland has 
enjoyed relative peace over the last decade, this 
conflict has continued to claim lives. To date, the 
death toll is close to 4000 lives in a population of 
1.7 million. In 2008 when the Northern Irish con-
flict was still hot, researchers indeed found 
 evidence in support of the above theorising, using 
cross-sectional data. That is, after considering the 
suffering of their ingroup (relative to the out-
group), both Catholic and Protestant participants 
reported a tendency to engage in competitive vic-
timhood, which in turn predicted positively their 
strength of identification with their respective 
ingroups. In turn, strength of identification pre-
dicted negatively forgiving the outgroup (Noor, 
Brown, &amp; Prentice, 2008). As predicted by the 
social identity approach and victim beliefs, it 
appears that construing one&rsquo;s groups&rsquo; suffering 
through exclusive and competitive victim beliefs 
bolsters ingroup identification. A narrow and 
strong identity in turn suppresses generosity in the 
group and therefore makes forgiving the adver-
sary group for their wrongs less likely. The inverse 
</p>
<p>relationship between strength of ingroup identifi-
cation and lack of forgiveness was replicated 
among Catholics and Protestants in Northern 
Ireland in a later study, as well as among the pro-
ponents and opponents of the military regime in 
the post-Pinochet Chile (Noor, Brown, Gonzalez, 
Manzi, &amp; Lewis, 2008, Studies 1 &amp; 2). That is, 
the more individuals identified with their partisan 
ingroup, the less forgiveness they displayed 
towards the outgroup.

<p>Box 15.7 Zooming In: Chile in the Wake of a 
</p>
<p>Military Dictatorship
</p>
<p>Following the end of Pinochet&rsquo;s military 
rule (1973&ndash;1990), Chilean society was left 
to deal with the legacy of his authoritarian 
regime, a division of the society into those 
with an ideology of the political Right and 
those with an ideology of the Left. The 
political Right, being in support of the 
Pinochet regime, viewed the military inter-
vention by Pinochet as necessary for com-
bating against Communism in Chile. To 
achieve this goal, the military regime 
engaged in systematic political violence 
against its opponents, which did not shy 
away from torture, executions, kidnap-
pings, and other human rights violations. 
Consequently, the Left remembers the mil-
itary regime as destructive of democracy 
and gross violations of human rights in 
Chile (Valenzuela &amp; Constable, 1991). 
However, the regime&rsquo;s opponents also 
claimed their victims through their cam-
paigns of political assassinations, bomb-
ings, and kidnappings. Even today, there is 
considerable debate about addressing the 
human rights atrocities that marked this 
historical period in Chile. Inevitably, these 
contrasting viewpoints have opened up 
controversial issues relating to the estab-
lishment of the truth, official apologies, 
and requests for forgiveness. To illustrate,

<p>15 Intergroup Forgiveness: The&nbsp;Interplay Between Who We&nbsp;Are and&nbsp;What Tales We&nbsp;Tell</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>230
</p>
<p>Providing experimental evidence for the link 
between the different levels of one&rsquo;s social iden-
tity (i.e. narrow vs. inclusive) and victim beliefs, 
Wohl and Branscombe (2005) examined these 
factors in the context of the Jewish Holocaust 
while focusing on the intergroup relations 
between contemporary Germans and North 
American Jews. Specifically, the researchers 
found that framing the Holocaust in concrete 
(vs. abstract and thereby more inclusive) terms, 
involving concrete group identities of the victim 
and perpetrator, led North American Jews to 
expect today&rsquo;s Germans to experience more guilt 
for the Holocaust atrocities. Crucially,  partici-
pants were less willing to forgive Germans. 
However, when the Holocaust was framed as an 
example of atrocities that human beings inflict on 
one another (i.e. evoking a social category more 
inclusive than the narrow ingroup category, that 
of all humanity), Jewish participants assigned 
less guilt to contemporary Germans for the 
Holocaust and were more willing to forgive them. 
Although the effects of this rather simple inter-
vention are impressive, one could argue that the 
efficacy of such abstract interventions may be 
due to the lack of intense conflict and relative 
peaceful co-existence between Jews and Germans 
in the contemporary world. In other words, would 
such an intervention work in contexts of ongoing 
and violent conflict?
</p>
<p>To answer this question, Schnabel et&nbsp;al. (2013) 
investigated the viability of framing one&rsquo;s group&rsquo;s 
victim identity into a more inclusive one as an 
intervention tool to reduce the tensions between 
Israelis and Palestinians as a result of their ongo-
ing conflict in the Middle East. Specifically, the 
researchers wanted to know whether such an 
</p>
<p>intervention could reduce both groups&rsquo; motiva-
tion to engage in competitive victimhood and to 
foster their intergroup forgiveness attitudes (see 
Box 15.6).
</p>
<p>The rationale for Shnabel and colleagues&rsquo; 
intervention was to evoke an inclusive identity 
(see Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2014; Dovidio, 
Gaertner, &amp; Saguy, 2009; see also Scheepers &amp; 
Ellemers, Chap. 9) that would allow room to 
acknowledge the suffering endured by both 
Palestinians and Israelis due to the regional con-
flict. To do so, these researchers drew the con-
flicting groups&rsquo; attention to their shared 
suffering in one experimental condition (i.e. 
common victim identity) by asking participants 
in this condition to read a short article remind-
ing participants that both Jews and Palestinians 
are victims of the prolonged conflict. The article 
justified this perspective by referring to alleged 
recent research concluding that each party had 
experienced substantial individual and national 
losses in human life, property, trust, and hope 
(Schnabel et&nbsp; al., 2013, Study 1). Alternatively, 
in the control condition, participants read a neu-
tral text about aircrafts that was not related to 
the regional conflict. Finally, the researchers 
created a third condition (common regional 
identity). In this condition, participants read a 
text highlighting recent archaeological research 
revealing that ancient Middle Eastern peoples, 
including Palestinians and Jews, shared a com-
mon primordial culture that is still evident today 
in highly similar traditions, cuisines, and 
mentalities.
</p>
<p>Results of this intervention showed that, rela-
tive to the control condition, inducing common 
victim identity among Palestinians and Israelis 
successfully reduced both groups&rsquo; motivation for 
competitive victimhood and, crucially, lead to 
increased willingness to forgive. By contrast, 
relative to the control condition, inducing com-
mon regional identity, corresponding to interven-
tions traditionally utilised within the identity 
recategorisation framework (Dovidio et&nbsp;al., 2009; 
Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2014), neither lead to the 
reduction of competitive victimhood nor did it 
lead to an increased level of forgiveness among 
the conflicting groups.
</p>
<p>during the military regime, Pinochet&rsquo;s 
elected successor President Patricio Aylwin 
stated, &lsquo;This is why I dare, in my position 
as President of the Republic, to assume the 
representation of the whole nation and, in 
its name, to beg forgiveness from the rela-
tives of the victims&rsquo; (Roniger &amp; Sznajder, 
1999, p.&nbsp;101).

</p>
<p>A number of important insights can be extrap-
olated from the above findings. First, these results 
yet again point to the important interplay between 
identity and victim beliefs. The findings demon-
strate that when collective suffering is framed in 
identities that are inclusive enough to allow 
room for acknowledging both the ingroup&rsquo;s suf-
fering and that of the outgroup&rsquo;s, the motivation 
for competitive victimhood can be decreased and 
the propensity to forgive one another can be 
increased. Second, fostering such inclusive vic-
tim identities provides researchers and practitio-
ners with one of the few intervention tools that 
promises to be sufficiently robust and efficacious, 
even in contexts of ongoing and violent inter-
group conflicts. Finally, these results also reveal 
that any such inclusive victim identity interven-
tions must address the pressing needs of conflict-
ing groups for acknowledgement of their mutual 
suffering. Otherwise, as seen in the generic com-
mon regional identity, such interventions may 
have little or no positive impact.
</p>
<p> What Would Third Parties Think 
of&nbsp;Us?
</p>
<p>Recent research has further advanced our under-
standing of the boundary conditions of victim 
beliefs, especially of inclusive victim beliefs 
(a.k.a. common victimhood). Specifically, given 
the positive impact of inclusive victim beliefs on 
rival intergroup relations, what might prevent 
groups from utilising this strategy to promote 
peaceful co-existence? Theoretically, we know, 
for example, that one reason why conflicting 
groups may be motivated to compete over their 
share of victimhood is to attract the moral and 
material support from third party groups (Noor 
et&nbsp; al., 2012). Remember that at times of active 
war, third party&rsquo;s support and interventions 
increase the likelihood that the supported group 
will win the conflict, at least, militarily (Balch- 
Lindsay, Enterline, &amp; Joyce, 2008). Thus, 
undoubtedly third parties can play a key role in 
intergroup conflicts. To demonstrate this, 
researchers recently investigated the hypothesis 
that one reason why conflicting groups&rsquo; may not 
</p>
<p>be willing to readily acknowledge the suffering 
of their outgroups may have to do with the con-
flicting groups being concerned that such public 
acknowledgment may reduce the level of support 
they could receive from international third parties 
(Adelman, Leidner, &Uuml;nal, Nahhas, &amp; Shnabel, 
2016). Thus, the idea that was tested in this 
research was the extent to which a group&rsquo;s concern 
over losing a third party&rsquo;s support may influence 
the group&rsquo;s willingness to acknowledge the harm 
they had caused the outgroup.
</p>
<p>Again, this research was conducted in the 
context of the Israeli and Palestinian conflict 
(Adelman et&nbsp;al., 2016, Study 1). The researchers 
employed an experimental paradigm, whereby 
Israeli participants either read a victimhood nar-
rative highlighting exclusively the suffering of 
Israelis due to the regional conflict (competitive 
victimhood narrative) or a narrative that drew 
attention to the suffering of both Israelis and 
Palestinians as a result of the conflict (inclusive 
victimhood narrative). Interestingly, the way par-
ticipants felt about the conflict and their collec-
tive suffering was revealed by the fact that the 
competitive victimhood narrative resonated with 
participants significantly more than the inclusive 
victimhood narrative.
</p>
<p>However, irrespective of participants&rsquo; prefer-
ence for the specific narrative, the researchers 
observed several significant interaction effects on 
their key dependent variables, namely, motiva-
tion for competitive victimhood (e.g. &lsquo;Throughout 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israelis suffered 
more than Palestinians&rsquo;, Adelman et&nbsp; al., 2016, 
p.1419) and support for aggressive policies 
against the outgroup (e.g. &lsquo;Israel should withhold 
tax money from the Palestinians if they don&rsquo;t 
fight terrorism&rsquo;, Adelman et&nbsp;al., 2016, p.&nbsp;1419). 
First, for participants who were presented with 
the inclusive victimhood narrative, the less they 
were concerned over losing third party&rsquo;s support 
due to the ingroup&rsquo;s acknowledgment of the out-
group&rsquo;s suffering, the less they were motivated to 
compete over their share of victimhood. By con-
trast, for participants who were presented with 
the competitive victimhood narrative, no signifi-
cant relationship between their concern over los-
ing third party&rsquo;s support and motivation for 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>232
</p>
<p>competitive victimhood was observed. Regarding 
participants&rsquo; support for aggressive policies 
against Palestinians, a similar pattern to the one 
above emerged. That is, among participants who 
were less concerned, the inclusive victimhood 
narrative decreased their support for aggressive 
policies, relative to the competitive victimhood 
narrative.
</p>
<p>Taken together, the outlined research provides 
interesting evidence in support of the important 
role of third parties and how they may influence 
conflicting groups regarding what victim beliefs 
they adopt. A broader point to take away from 
this research is that often as researchers we sim-
plify the dynamics of intergroup conflict by 
reducing our analysis to the ingroup and out-
group protagonists only. However, as the present 
research demonstrates, conflict maintenance (vs. 
reduction) is rarely a matter of disagreements 
between two groups in a social vacuum.
</p>
<p> Can They Ever Change?
</p>
<p>Victim beliefs can also be influenced by their 
beliefs about the perpetrator outgroup and about 
human nature more broadly. In other words, 
individuals&rsquo; beliefs about what their enemy 
group might be capable of can shape how they 
would behave towards such enemy groups. This 
line of reasoning is anchored in the implicit theo-
ries of change (Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988; Dweck, 
Chiu, &amp; Hong, 1995; see also Bernecker &amp; Job, 
Chap. 12). The underpinning rationale here is 
that people vary in their beliefs about human 
beings&rsquo; potential for change. On the one hand, 
you may believe that as human beings we all 
have the potential to change our personal charac-
teristics and behaviours. On the other hand, you 
may  perceive stability in human nature and 
expect that our individual traits and behaviours 
are rather resistant to change. Such differential 
beliefs entail important consequences for how 
you behave towards others, especially towards 
your outgroups.
</p>
<p>In a study conducted with Israeli train passen-
gers living in Tel Aviv, Israel, researchers experi-
mentally manipulated participants&rsquo; malleability 
</p>
<p>beliefs about human nature by presenting them 
with bogus newspaper articles on recent research 
revealing alleged scientific evidence in favour 
(vs. against) such malleability (Wohl et&nbsp; al., 
2015). To illustrate, in the pro-malleability con-
dition, participants read alleged research find-
ings revealing that the nature of groups in general 
could change, while in the non-malleability con-
dition, the research findings revealed that the 
nature of groups would be fixed. In a purportedly 
unrelated second study, all participants were 
asked to read a bogus outgroup apology offered 
by the Palestinian leadership for the killing of 
innocent Israelis. Finally, participants were then 
asked to indicate the extent to which they were 
willing to forgive Palestinians, as well as the 
extent to which participants endorsed to recipro-
cate the Palestinian apology with one from the 
Israeli side.
</p>
<p>The researchers found that they had success-
fully manipulated participants&rsquo; malleability 
beliefs about Palestinians in the predicted direc-
tion. Importantly, the results showed that, relative 
to participants in the low malleability condition, 
those who were led to believe that groups&rsquo; nature 
is malleable were not only more forgiving of 
Palestinians, but they were also willing to support 
the apology reciprocation (Wohl et&nbsp; al., 2015, 
Study 2).
</p>
<p>What is striking about this intervention is that 
it extends the importance of victim beliefs to 
beliefs about perpetrators, thereby providing fur-
ther intervention strategies for researchers and 
practitioners. Also of note is that the researchers 
observed this positive impact of the beliefs about 
perpetrators&rsquo; malleability to also influence par-
ticipants&rsquo; willingness to reciprocate the out-
group&rsquo;s apology. Past literature has pointed out 
that the link between apology and forgiveness at 
the intergroup level is at best a tenuous one 
(Hornsey &amp; Wohl, 2013). Thus, to observe the 
above effect in such a context is indeed very 
promising.
</p>
<p>In the forgoing sections of this chapter, we 
were primarily concerned with summarising 
theoretical and empirical evidence to make a case 
in support of the social- and conflict-reducing 
utility of forgiveness. However, no case would be

<p>complete without problematizing the limitations 
and unintended consequences of forgiveness, 
which we will address next.
</p>
<p> The Limitations and&nbsp;Unintended 
Consequences of&nbsp;Forgiveness
</p>
<p>Often forgiveness is considered as a gift given by 
victims to their perpetrators (Noor &amp; Cantacuzino, 
2018). Although the motivation behind such gen-
erosity may vary across victims, scholars gener-
ally agree that forgiveness tends to lose its power 
when we make it a duty. This is referred to as for-
giveness boosterism, which involves praising and 
pushing forgiveness as a universal prescription 
(Lamb &amp; Murphy, 2002). Clearly, the intention to 
write this chapter and dedicate our research 
careers to studying forgiveness are not served by 
referring to forgiveness as a panacea for resolving 
intergroup conflict.
</p>
<p>In fact, forgiveness has been shown to be 
accompanied with some important unintended 
consequences. To illustrate, empirical research by 
Greenaway, Quinn, and Louis (2011) framed the 
atrocities White Australians have committed 
against Australian Aborigines as a common 
humanity tragedy (rather than the outcome of 
concrete hostile intergroup relations) with the 
</p>
<p>intention to induce a common humanity identity 
among Australian Aborigines to foster intergroup 
forgiveness (closely modelled on Wohl and 
Branscombe&rsquo;s research discussed earlier, 2005). 
As predicted, the recategorisation efforts had the 
effect of soliciting intergroup forgiveness. 
However, the research also revealed that this pro-
cess had the effect of reducing the Aborigines&rsquo; 
willingness to demand restitution for the injustices 
they have endured at the hands of White 
Australians. Put differently, the same intervention 
that led to increased willingness to forgive also 
suppressed justice demands among Aborigines.
</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Wenzel and Okimoto 
(2015) found that, when participants of a 
laboratory- created group were encouraged by 
their fellow ingroup members to forgive an out-
group transgressor, this reduced anger and 
increased sympathy towards the transgressor 
among the participants. Crucially, these forgiving 
participants also perceived less injustice than 
those who were not prompted to forgive.
</p>
<p>Although a rigorous test of the causal relation-
ship between forgiveness and justice demands 
has not yet been conducted, the above findings 
point to interventions that, while on the surface 
are aimed at fostering forgiveness, may have seri-
ous sedative effects on justice-related outcome 
variables. Thus, both researchers and practitio-
ners ought to exercise extra caution when pro-
moting intergroup forgiveness and pay particular 
attention to justice concerns, which are consid-
ered key to a meaningful and robust conflict 
resolution infrastructure.
</p>
<p>Box 15.8 Question for Elaboration: Is 
</p>
<p>Forgiveness Always a Good Thing?
</p>
<p>So far in this chapter, forgiveness has been 
framed in terms of its utility at fostering 
peaceful co-existence between groups who 
are either currently engaged in conflict or 
who have a shared history steeped in hos-
tile relations. However, can you think of 
any circumstances when forgiveness may 
not be the best strategy for groups to 
adopt? It might be particularly useful when 
thinking about this question to consider 
the relation between unequal groups in the 
long term. Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; The propensity to suffer can transcend 
from the individual to the group level 
when suffering is inflicted as a conse-
quence of one&rsquo;s particular group 
membership.
</p>
<p>&bull; Groups are able to construe such suffer-
ing from discrete and powerful narra-
tives into a shared sense of collective 
victimhood.

<p> Guiding Answers to Questions in 
the Chapter
</p>
<p> 1. Question with Box 15.8: Is Forgiveness 
Always a Good Thing?
</p>
<p>A: The empirical evidence reviewed in this 
chapter demonstrates that when conflicting 
groups are reminded of their common suffer-
ing, such groups are more likely to forgive 
one another, thus fostering intergroup har-
mony. However, such an intervention may 
also reduce the anger and identification with 
one&rsquo;s own group. Such dispositions are para-
mount when mobilising disadvantaged groups 
to rally for social change in the wake of such 
disadvantage (e.g. see Wright &amp; Lubensky, 
2009; and also Greenaway et&nbsp; al., 2011). 
Though having a curing impact on fractured 
relations, forgiveness may come at the cost of 
normalising objective group- based inequali-
ties (see Morton &amp; Postmes, 2011). In the 
long run, this is particularly problematic, for 
without the desire for social change, such 
inequalities are given the opportunity to fester 
without the challenge of redress from those 
people who should be most motivated to chal-
lenge the status quo&nbsp;&ndash; those in the disadvan-
taged position. This critique of forgiveness is 
touching on a much bigger and unanswered 
question, namely, how does forgiveness relate 
to justice?
</p>
<p>&bull; This dynamic (and obstructive) inter-
play between group identity and victim-
hood can act as a barrier to intergroup 
forgiveness.
</p>
<p>&bull; When interventions are instigated that 
target mutually destructive suffering 
and focus groups&rsquo; attention upon their 
common suffering, intergroup forgive-
ness is more readily endorsed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Intergroup forgiveness can be achieved 
and is a viable strategy to impede per-
petuating cycles of revenge. Ultimately, 
this has the effect of reducing the net 
amount of suffering.
