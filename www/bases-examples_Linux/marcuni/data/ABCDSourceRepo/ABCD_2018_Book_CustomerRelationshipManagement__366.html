<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Customer relationship management 
(CRM) as a strategy and as a technology 
has gone through an amazing evolutionary 
journey. After the initial technological 
approaches, this process has matured con-
siderably&nbsp; &ndash; both from a conceptual and 
from an applications point of view. Of 
course this evolution continues, especially 
in the light of the digital transformation. 
Today, CRM refers to a strategy, a set of 
tactics, and a technology that has become 
indispensable in the modern economy.
</p>
<p>Based on both authors&rsquo; rich academic and 
managerial experience, this book gives a 
unified treatment of the strategic and 
tactical aspects of customer relationship 
management as we know it today. It 
stresses developing an understanding of 
economic customer value as the guiding 
concept for marketing decisions. The goal 
of this book is to be a comprehensive and 
up-to-date learning companion for 
advanced undergraduate students, master 
students, and executives who want a 
detailed and conceptually sound insight 
into the field of CRM.
</p>
<p>Aimed at students, teachers, and practi-
tioners of CRM, this book offers a 
comprehensive treatment of CRM and 
database marketing, the approach to 
strategic CRM, and implementing the 
CRM strategy and the various metrics to 
measure customer value. This book 
provides all the necessary steps in 
managing profitable customer relation-
ships. It stresses on developing an 
understanding of customer value as the 
guiding concept for marketing decisions, 
and illustrates the importance of the 
customer lifetime value metric as the 
guiding concept for profitable customer 
management. This book also analyzes the 
implementation of CRM strategies in the 
areas of loyalty programs, marketing 
campaigns, and channel management. 
Specifically, this book provides insights 
</p>
<p>into several customer level marketing 
strategies that can be implemented by 
adopting a customer lifetime value 
approach&nbsp;&ndash; also integrating the digital 
approaches that are prevalent these days. 
The goal of this book is to be a useful 
learning companion to students, teachers, 
and practitioners of CRM.

<p> Organization of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Text
</p>
<p>This book adopts a holistic approach 
towards CRM by providing the concepts, 
explaining the tools, and developing rele-
vant strategies. It introduces key concepts 
and metrics needed to understand and 
implement CRM strategies. It describes 
the process of successful CRM implemen-
tation. Finally, it presents techniques to aid 
in strategic marketing decisions using the 
concept of customer lifetime value. This 
book is divided into four parts as follows:
</p>
<p> 5 Part One: Introduction consists of two 
chapters and introduces the concept of 
customer equity/value as a key aspect 
of customer relationship management 
(CRM). This part explains the role of 
CRM in the current business scenario 
and presents a comprehensive link that 
connects CRM and customer value.
</p>
<p> 5 Part Two: Strategic CRM consists 
of 7 Chaps. 3 and 4 and introduces 
the concepts related to strategic 
CRM.&nbsp;This part describes the differ-
ence between strategic and functional 
CRM and presents the case for devel-
oping a CRM strategy. It also elabo-
rates on the elements of a CRM system 
and provides the implementation 
aspects of the customer management 
strategy.
</p>
<p> 5 Part Three: Analytical CRM consists 
of 7 Chaps. 5, 6, 7, and 8 and presents 
the tools pertaining to analytical 
CRM.&nbsp;This part focuses on commonly 
used CRM metrics and techniques such 
as acquisition rate, retention rate, share 
of wallet, logistic regression, decision 
trees, RFM, past customer value, and 
</p>
<p>customer lifetime value. This part also 
discusses the concepts relating to data 
mining and implementing database 
marketing. Types of databases and their 
uses and benefits are outlined. Guide-
lines to develop and plan marketing 
campaigns in order to maximize cus-
tomer value are discussed. This section 
also addresses the technical aspects of 
CRM software tools and dashboards 
required to implement and manage 
CRM applications.
</p>
<p> 5 Part Four: Operational CRM consists 
of 7 Chaps. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 
and presents the strategies involved in 
operational CRM.&nbsp;This part discusses 
loyalty programs and the characteris-
tics that make up an effective loyalty 
program. This part also discusses the 
impact of CRM on marketing chan-
nels. A separate chapter discusses the 
developments of CRM using social 
media. The last chapter looks into the 
future and envisions the developments 
and changes that are likely to take 
CRM ahead.
</p>
<p> 5 Part Five: Advances in CRM Applica-
tions consists of 7 Chaps. 16, 17, 
and 18 and traces recent advances 
in CRM applications. This section 
illustrates new and emerging tech-
niques in customer value&ndash;based 
CRM.&nbsp;Critical marketing issues like 
optimum resource allocation, pur-
chase sequence, and the link between 
acquisition, retention, and profit-
ability are examined on the basis of 
empirical findings. These applica-
tions are categorized on the basis of 
applicability for the B2B and B2C 
scenarios.

<p>1.1  An Introduction to&nbsp; 
Strategic&nbsp;CRM
</p>
<p>At one time, marketing campaigns aimed mainly 
to increase customer loyalty to a product or ser-
vice. The thought was that more loyal customers 
would engage in more repeat business, develop a 
larger tolerance to price increases, and therefore 
be more profitable to the firm. However, this 
pathway does not always hold. A very loyal cus-
tomer may repeatedly call customer service with 
questions and constantly hunt for the best price 
on a product, taking advantage of every rebate 
</p>
<p>and sales offer. Ultimately, this customer actually 
costs the company money, rather than providing a 
source of profits. An important part of CRM is 
identifying the different types of customers and 
then developing specific strategies for interacting 
with each one. Examples of such strategies include 
developing better relationships with profitable 
customers, locating and enticing new customers 
who will be profitable, and finding appropriate 
strategies for unprofitable customers, which could 
mean terminating those relationships that cause a 
company to lose money. Until recently customer 
value was solely determined by their profitability 
</p>
<p>Overview
</p>
<p>Peter Drucker defined the marketing concept as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;the business as seen from the customer&rsquo;s point of 
</p>
<p>view.&rdquo; This definition has undergone further 
</p>
<p>refinement, such that the marketing concept 
</p>
<p>became a distinct organizational culture, repre-
</p>
<p>sented by a fundamental shared set of beliefs and 
</p>
<p>values that put the customer at the center of a 
</p>
<p>firm&rsquo;s thinking about strategy and operations 
</p>
<p>(Deshpande &amp; Webster, 1989). These definitions 
</p>
<p>emerged when the approach to marketing was 
</p>
<p>predominantly about addressing the needs of 
</p>
<p>customer segments, because distinguishing 
</p>
<p>individual customers was far too difficult.
</p>
<p>Following a market segmentation strategy, 
</p>
<p>firms first divided the costumers into sub-groups 
</p>
<p>(segments) based on their needs and then 
</p>
<p>designed standardized products and services to 
</p>
<p>deliver to those segments. However, with market 
</p>
<p>segmentation, the importance of individual 
</p>
<p>consumer preferences got downgraded, for two 
</p>
<p>main reasons. First, individual customer-level 
</p>
<p>data were not available. Second, serving the 
</p>
<p>needs of individual customers was expensive 
</p>
<p>and, in some cases, impossible for firms.
</p>
<p>Leaps in information technology and the 
</p>
<p>ubiquity of the Internet have changed all that, 
</p>
<p>together with vast improvements in flexible 
</p>
<p>manufacturing and outsourcing practices. 
</p>
<p>Today, understanding and meeting individual 
</p>
<p>customer needs have become the key dimen-
</p>
<p>sion on which firms forge their competitive 
</p>
<p>advantage. With this shift, it is important to state 
</p>
<p>clearly the underlying belief that can drive the 
</p>
<p>success of firms: The marketing concept needs 
</p>
<p>to make way for the customer concept.
</p>
<p> &raquo;  The customer concept is the conduct of all 
marketing activities with the belief that 
</p>
<p>the individual customer is the central unit 
</p>
<p>of analysis and action.
</p>
<p>This definition emphasizes the analysis and 
</p>
<p>measurement of marketing activities and 
</p>
<p>consequences at the individual customer level. 
</p>
<p>When marketing activities are directed at the 
</p>
<p>individual, interactive relationships can be 
</p>
<p>forged by the firm with individual customers. To 
</p>
<p>establish a good relationship and customer 
</p>
<p>experience every touchpoint between the 
</p>
<p>company and the individual is important 
</p>
<p>including the traditional point of sale but also 
</p>
<p>social media platforms. Furthermore, because of 
</p>
<p>the focus on the individual, costumers take a 
</p>
<p>more active part in the relationship by for 
</p>
<p>example providing feedback to the firm or 
</p>
<p>reviewing the product for other customers.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we introduce two key 
</p>
<p>terms: customer value and customer relation-
</p>
<p>ship management (CRM). We also discuss 
</p>
<p>changes taking place with respect to (1) 
</p>
<p>consumers, (2) marketplaces, and (3) market-
</p>
<p>ing functions. Rapid changes related to these 
</p>
<p>forces drive firms to be customer centric and 
</p>
<p>market driven. Simultaneously, there is a 
</p>
<p>visible shift from product-based to customer-
</p>
<p>based marketing. In other words, firms are 
</p>
<p>updating their processes and practices to align 
</p>
<p>with the customer concept, and marketing 
</p>
<p>plays the important role of forging relation-
</p>
<p>ships with customers so that the firm can stay 
</p>
<p>relevant to the customer and accountable to 
</p>
<p>its stakeholders.

</p>
<p>in terms of sales. However, customer value can 
also be based on the customers&rsquo; behavior in terms 
of referrals (the customers participation in refer-
ral programs initiated by the firm), knowledge 
sharing (information or feedback that a customer 
provides the company), and influence on other 
customers in forms of reviews and blogs.
</p>
<p>The concept of customer value is critical to 
CRM.&nbsp;It refers to the economic value of the cus-
tomer relationship to the firm, expressed as a con-
tribution margin or net profit. As a marketing 
metric, customer value offers an important deci-
sion aid, beyond its ability to evaluate marketing 
effectiveness. A firm can both measure and opti-
mize its marketing efforts by incorporating cus-
tomer value at the core of its decision-making 
process.
</p>
<p>Also given the concept of customer value we 
can describe CRM as the practice of analyzing 
and using marketing databases and leveraging 
communication technologies to determine cor-
porate practices and methods that maximize the 
lifetime value of each customer to the firm.
</p>
<p>However, in practice there are many differ-
ent definition of CRM.&nbsp; Consulting firms, IT 
vendors and companies have created their own 
definitions and conceptualizations that continue 
to evolve. These can broadly be divided into 
three different perspectives: the functional level, 
the customer- facing front-end level, and the 
strategic level.
 1. Functional level: Customer relationship 
</p>
<p>management can be practiced on a very 
limited functional basis (e.g., sales force 
automation in the sales function, campaign 
management by the marketing function).
</p>
<p> 2. Customer-facing front-end level: This 
type of CRM focuses on the total customer 
experience. The goal is to build a single view 
of the customer across all contact channels 
and to distribute customer intelligence to all 
customer- facing functions.
</p>
<p> 3. Strategic level: This perspective tries to 
free the term &laquo;CRM&raquo; from any technology 
underpinnings and from specific customer 
management techniques. It describes CRM as 
a process to implement customer centricity 
in the market and build shareholder value. 
Here, knowledge about customers and their 
preferences has implications for the entire 
organization, such as for R&amp;D or supply 
chain management.
</p>
<p>This book follows a strategic perspective. That is 
CRM aims to gain a long-term competitive advan-
tage by optimally delivering value and satisfaction 
to the customer and extracting business value from 
the exchange. Thus, knowledge about customers 
and their preferences is of utmost importance for 
the entire organization. From this standpoint.
</p>
<p>Overall, strategic customer relationship man-
agement is a relationship management concept 
based on established marketing principles that 
recognizes the need to balance organizational and 
customer interests carefully. That is CRM is not 
a result primarily of technological solutions but 
is rather supported by them. These complex sets 
of activities together form the basis for a sustain-
able and hard to imitate competitive advantage: 
the customer-centric organization. CRM also 
involves automating and enhancing customer-
centric business processes, including sales, mar-
keting, and service. Instead of just automating 
these processes, CRM focuses on ensuring that 
front-office applications improve customer sat-
isfaction, which results in increased customer 
loyalty and thus affects the company&rsquo;s bottom line 
(Nadeem, 2012). With CRM, a company creates 
an environment and flexible support system that 
can deal readily with issues surrounding product 
innovation, increasing customer expectations, 
acquisitions, globalization, deregulation, the con-
vergence of traditional markets, and emergence 
of new technologies, privacy issues, and new cus-
tomer contact channels. In the following section, 
we describe these main reasons and trends that 
underlie the growing importance of a strategic 
customer management approach.
</p>
<p>1.2  Why Managing Customers Is 
More Critical Than Ever
</p>
<p>The competitive landscape and the volatile econo-
mies that mark the modern world mean there is 
no way around the need to manage customers 
</p>
<p>CRM is the strategic process of selecting 
</p>
<p>customers that a firm can most profitably 
</p>
<p>serve and shaping interactions between a 
</p>
<p>company and these customers. The ultimate 
</p>
<p>goal is to optimize the current and future 
</p>
<p>value of customers for the company.

profitably in the long term. It is a more pressing 
issue than ever before. Data are easily available, so 
much that firms are overwhelmed, and the amount 
doubles every 18&nbsp;months. New trends, such as the 
rise of social media and apps, then arrive to create 
new CRM challenges for companies.
</p>
<p>This section outlines the major factors that 
influence strategic CRM and have severe conse-
quences for companies; it also introduces a 
 customer- centric management approach and 
shows how the evolution of CRM points to a new 
understanding. Modern firms face gradual but 
still seismic changes with respect to three major 
forces: (1) consumers, (2) marketplaces, and (3) 
marketing functions. It is important to under-
stand those changes to function successfully in 
the marketplace.
</p>
<p>1.2.1  Changes with&nbsp;Respect 
to&nbsp;Consumers
</p>
<p>There are nine major consumer trends, listed in 
. Table&nbsp; 1.1, that are essential to understand the 
growing importance of a strategic approach to 
CRM.&nbsp;They comprise two main subgroups: demo-
graphic and behavioral changes. Demographic 
changes relate mostly to current developments in 
the growing diversity of customers; behavioral 
changes describe shifts in the way consumers act 
and react to market offers.
</p>
<p> Demographic Changes and&nbsp;Increasing 
Consumer Diversity
</p>
<p>A key development is the diversity of customers 
whom vendors confront. On the most basic level, 
this diversity is triggered by the changing demo-
graphic composition of the population, as can be 
observed in all industrialized nations, from 
Western Europe to the United States and Japan. 
</p>
<p>Changing demographics serve as a good indicator 
of the future marketplace, because providers must 
change their offerings when the demographic 
make-up, and thus the needs, of the marketplace 
change. Three important demographic trends are 
transforming the marketplace:
</p>
<p>Aging Populations in&nbsp;Developed 
</p>
<p>Countries
</p>
<p>The birth rate in most developed countries has 
been falling for more than two decades. This phe-
nomenon has been described as deyouthing 
(Department of Economic and Social Affairs-
Population Division, 2010). The differences in 
median ages across developed and undeveloped 
countries thus can be quite dramatic. The median 
age in the United States for example is 38, whereas 
in India it is 26. Thus, in developed countries 
middle-age values and perspectives will increas-
ingly dominate the national psyche&nbsp; &ndash; including 
older consumers&rsquo; generally favorable responses to 
relationship marketing approaches.
</p>
<p>Increasing Diversity in&nbsp;Ethnicity
</p>
<p>The closer integration of countries in Western 
Europe has made it easier for people to move and 
establish lives abroad. Such migration is often 
driven by better economic conditions in highly 
industrialized countries, such that it leads to 
great increases in cultural and ethnic diversity in 
countries such as France, England, the 
Netherlands, and Germany. The United States 
historically has been ethnically diverse, and that 
trend is on the rise: Hispanics are the fastest 
growing group, and in California and Texas, 
whites will soon become minority populations. 
This shift in the ethnic make-up of the U.S. soci-
ety will result in a more segmented market place. 
Therefore, vendors will need to cater to ethni-
cally diverse needs in housing, clothing, and 
</p>

</p>
<p>food. Marketing communication will also have 
to reflect this diversity to serve their customers 
effectively.
</p>
<p>Increasing Individualization
</p>
<p>In many Western countries, approximately 50% of 
women work full time, a trend that places tremen-
dous pressure on traditional notions of family. By 
losing an anchor, in the form of a full-time home-
maker, the family is evolving as a unit of social 
and consumption analysis. Single-parent and 
dual-career households proliferate, and the need 
to define a separate existence or space encourages 
highly individualistic lifestyles and behaviors, 
even within family units. Thus, firms must 
increasingly consider the individual behaviors of 
family members who spend more time apart, 
rather than assuming household homogeneity. 
The marketplace will feel the impact of such 
demographic trends in the form of consumer 
choices, such as outsourcing of activities due to 
time constraints, more consumption on demand 
(24/7), and more consumption on the basis of 
symbolism and social group values. Singles may 
also seek out products and services that offer 
them social and emotional value. This also leads 
to an increased consumer heterogeneity.
</p>
<p>Behavioral Changes
</p>
<p>Companies that want to develop a customer- 
centric business strategy also need to consider the 
overall behavior of consumers.
</p>
<p>Increased Use of&nbsp;Social Media
</p>
<p>People increasingly engage in word of mouth on 
different social media platforms with friends, 
acquaintance but also strangers (Chaffey, 2016). 
Companies must realize this fundamental shift in 
consumer behavior and act accordingly, especially 
to take advantage of at least three key opportuni-
ties for companies. First, they can learn by listen-
ing to consumers online. Online buzz helps 
companies understand what consumers really 
want, and they can use these insights for product 
development, communication strategies, and suc-
cess measures. Second, social media offers ways to 
improve the timeliness of customer feedback. 
People who use social media to interact with com-
panies, such as through Facebook or Twitter, 
expect to receive from customer immediate 
responses management. In the end of 2016, 
Facebook had 1.72 billion active consumers per 
</p>
<p>month that spend about 50&nbsp; min on the website 
each day often browsing company-run Facebook 
pages (Stewart, 2016). That means firms have 
great opportunities to interact with customers in 
channels that the customers themselves have cho-
sen. Third, social media allow companies to exe-
cute new forms of communication strategies and 
advertising that integrate consumers. Consumers 
are no longer happy to be confronted with a mes-
sage; they want to be an active part of it. However, 
there are also drawbacks related to this behavior. 
Negative word of mouth can spread faster. Thus, 
companies have to closely monitor consumers&rsquo; 
feedback and identify complaints that have the 
potential to go viral. Furthermore, companies 
have to be aware of the increasing consumer inse-
curity regarding data security. Still, most consum-
ers are willing to share their data with companies 
when they know that the company uses these to 
help them while ensuring that the data are kept 
secure. Thus, companies have to find a way to 
treat consumer data responsibly and show con-
sumers the value of data sharing.
</p>
<p>Increased Use of&nbsp;Apps
</p>
<p>Mobile devices become more and more important 
in consumers daily lives. In 2015, one billion con-
sumers owned a tablet and 1.86 billion used 
mobile phones. With the increased usage of these 
mobile devices the consumptions of apps 
increased as well (Chaffey, 2014). Apps are soft-
ware applications that are designed to run on 
mobile devices. They can be downloaded from the 
respective app store of consumers&rsquo; mobile opera-
tors (e.g. Apple or Google). Apple opened the first 
app store in 2008 and since then the app market 
expanded rapidly (Apple &amp; TechCrunch, 2016). 
In 2016 Apple and Google offered around two 
million apps in their respective app stores. Initially 
apps were designed to help consumers retrieve 
information (e.g., weather, calendar, e-mail). 
Nowadays there are many different types of apps 
including utilities (weather, Uber), social net-
works (WhatsApp, Snapchat, Facebook), photos 
(Instagram), and games (Angry Birds, Candy 
Crash Saga). App usage is expected to increase 
even further in the coming years, because of new 
technological inventions such wearables and 
smart TVs. Therefore, many companies&rsquo; such as 
CVS, Walmart, American Eagle, and The 
New&nbsp;York Times design apps to establish a mobile 
presence and to communicate to their customers.

</p>
<p>1
Use of&nbsp;Real Time Data
</p>
<p>The internet and mobile devices in particular 
allow consumers to stay connected at any in 
time and to receive data and information instan-
taneously. For example, to get the latest news 
consumers no longer have to wait for the news-
paper the next day. Instead, they can simply 
check different news pages online. Online news-
papers are usually updated several times a day 
whenever new information becomes available. 
Furthermore, consumers can check the avail-
ability of airplane seats, hotel rooms or cinema 
seats in real time and buy products right after 
the need arousal. This leads to a generally faster 
pace in consumers&rsquo; lives. Another important 
aspect for companies is real time bidding. 
Companies may bid on advertising space in real 
time. That is, after a consumer visited their web-
page they can retarget them  instantaneously. 
This allows companies to be more precise con-
cerning their target groups.
</p>
<p>Need for&nbsp;Convenience and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Rise 
</p>
<p>of&nbsp;Self-Service
</p>
<p>As their time poverty increases, consumers seek 
more and more convenience, which has impacts 
on all aspects of business. Small convenience 
stores, like the Tesco Express format, that offer a 
limited assortment can cater to daily needs; for-
mats such as Marks &amp; Spencer&rsquo;s Food boast a 
wide offer of prepared meals and ready-to-cook 
ingredients. In their relationship with a vendor, 
consumers demand a more active role by the 
company. It can no longer just answer questions; 
for example, many financial institutions now 
offer customized monthly reports of customers&rsquo; 
financial activity.
</p>
<p>At the same time, demands for convenience 
have led to the rise of self-service options. When 
they can, people want to take care of their own 
needs without hassle. Online banking platforms 
give consumers the means to buy stocks and 
search for information on their own. In retailing, 
shoppers can use dedicated self-service check-
outs, scan their basket items, and pay without 
further assistance. The overall notion of online 
shopping, conducted outside regular store hours, 
has added significantly to the development of a 
stronger orientation toward convenient offers 
and 24/7 access to goods. In summary, compa-
nies must do both: Empower consumers to per-
form minor services themselves by offering 
</p>
<p>convenient self-service options but be consis-
tently available when customer problems grow 
more complex.
</p>
<p>Increased Demand for&nbsp;Experiences 
</p>
<p>and&nbsp;Authenticity
</p>
<p>Because of the new technological advances and 
the increasing competition, customers are becom-
ing more demanding. They strive for individuality 
and self-realization. Goods and services are there-
fore no longer sufficient to differentiate the brand 
and satisfy the consumer. Instead, companies 
should create memorable events and experience 
that personally engage the consumer. For exam-
ple, consumers prefer an experiential retail envi-
ronment, where shopping is more than a 
transaction. To do so some grocery stores provide 
cooking recipes and use bakery flavor in their 
aisle. Another example is the increasing number 
of cinemas that offer comfortable chairs and gour-
met food and drinks. Offering experiences is thus 
one way for companies to position and differenti-
ate themselves when the physical product and 
service are no longer sufficient. However, every 
time consumer expectations are met, companies 
raise their bar, so that once delighted customers 
are even harder to satisfy at the next encounter. 
Thus, firms in industrialized economies are strug-
gling to satisfy customers.
</p>
<p>Another megatrend is consumers&rsquo; quest for 
authenticity. The improved information trans-
parency in the digital age provides consumers 
with a better understanding of marketers&rsquo; per-
suasion tactics. As a result, consumers become 
increasingly skeptical towards any form of brand 
communication. Thus, companies should be 
transparent, honest, and consistent in their 
communication as well as reflect the company&rsquo;s 
values.

<p>Increased Health and&nbsp;Sustainability 
</p>
<p>Consciousness
</p>
<p>Customer are increasingly conscious towards 
health and sustainability issues. That is, they 
believe that companies should not only care about 
profits but also operate responsible and address 
social and environmental issues (Sustainable 
Brands, 2015). However, simply communicating a 
sustainable goal is not sufficient, the goal also has 
to fit to the company or brand, must be credible, 
and well implemented. Consumers furthermore 
look for fresh, healthy and less processed options 
</p>

</p>
<p>while shopping. Especially millennials prefer 
healthy and organic products (Solomon, 2015). 
Due to the technological advances, consumers are 
nowadays able to inform themselves about the 
product and company, even at the point of sale. 
Mobile technologies built into smartphones, for 
example allow shoppers to scan barcodes, get all 
the information they need about the product 
including their sustainability and conduct a price 
comparison on the go. It is a new form of transpar-
ency, and companies must get accustomed to it.
</p>
<p> Consequences
</p>
<p>Changes in demographics and the overall con-
sumer lifestyles have powerful impacts on cus-
tomer behavior. Customers generally take greater 
demands on firms. They expect companies to pro-
vide more than just goods and services. Moreover, 
they want them to be authentic and sustainable 
while still offering the best deal. Thus, it becomes 
increasingly hard for companies to satisfy cus-
tomers.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, marketers must be extremely 
wary of making heavy time demands of consum-
ers. Generally speaking customers have more 
power relative to vendors as their technological 
aptitude and product knowledge continue to 
increase. Diversification and time scarcity 
increase the pursuit of more personalized prod-
ucts and services that also offer the very best deal. 
This trend is well corroborated by the increasing 
inefficiency of traditional mass marketing 
approaches (which we discuss subsequently). 
Seemingly paradoxically, consumers&rsquo; time scar-
city and need for consumption- on-demand make 
them good targets for well-crafted relationship 
strategies.
</p>
<p>Firms that can satisfy this demand will thrive 
in this new environment. To do so companies 
have to engage the customer and respond to their 
individual needs.
</p>
<p>The reality of a changing customer environ-
ment is underscored by the results of a survey by 
McKinsey (2014), which indicates that 69% of the 
participating CEOs believe that customer engage-
ment is of utmost importance.
</p>
<p>Demographic and behavioral shifts mean that 
demand is becoming more and more heteroge-
neous, individualized, and fragmented. A mass 
marketing approach focused on pushing similar 
products to everyone thus has become a weak 
proposition.
</p>
<p>1.2.2  Changes with&nbsp;Respect 
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Marketplace
</p>
<p>Until recently, business was characterized by its 
manufacturing. The focus on goods rather than 
services or experiences led to mass-market, 
product- focused marketing strategies, in which 
businesses tried to sell the same product to as 
many people as possible. This strategy increased 
the cost of acquiring new customers but lowered 
their switching costs. But globalization of the 
marketplace, the growth of services economies, 
and technology advances mean that business has 
undergone some key changes and developments.
</p>
<p> Intensified Competition for 
Customers in&nbsp;Fragmented Markets
</p>
<p>On the one hand, as trade barriers fall and geo-
graphic boundaries are redefined, by both estab-
lished and emergent trading blocs, the idea of a 
location advantage is being eroded for most com-
panies. Access to markets is no longer localized, 
so demands for logistics management and distri-
bution partnering are becoming more significant.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, in a developed market in 
which supply exceeds demand, customers have 
differentiated needs. To address customers&rsquo; par-
ticular needs, the market must be broken down 
into multiple segments, which facilitates individ-
ualized marketing.
</p>
<p> Difficult Differentiation
</p>
<p>As mentioned before the quality of objective 
product attributes has risen substantially and is 
no longer a source of competitive advantage for 
most companies. Brand loyalty founded on a 
product differential is a relative, not an absolute, 
achievement. As products&rsquo; quality differentials 
diminish, companies seek competitive advantages 
through their closer, service and experience- 
focused relationships.
</p>
<p>A case in point is an example from the grocery 
industry, which continues to experience the rise 
of private labels (Hartman Group, 2016). Private 
labels are growing worldwide, such that in the US 
approximately 18% of all retail sales are now gen-
erated by private labels. In Switzerland private 
labels even account for 53% of the total retail 
sales. The objective quality features of private-
label products in many cases are entirely compa-
rable to national brands. For example according 
</p>
<p>1.2 &middot; Why Managing Customers Is More Critical Than Ever</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10
</p>
<p>1
to Nielsen 75% of US consumers perceive private 
labels as a good alternative to national brands and 
hence find fewer reasons to pay a premium for 
national brand equity.
</p>
<p> Consequences
</p>
<p>A good product is not sufficient to compete in a 
world of very high product standards. As prod-
ucts and services improve and become similar in 
their objective performance, companies must 
question traditional marketing models. They start 
to shift away from a transaction-based model to 
focus instead on enduring commercial relation-
ships. In turn, firms can learn about new and 
latent customer preferences by observing their 
purchase and behavioral histories and using social 
media and review platforms to gather consumers&rsquo; 
opinions. Developments in mass customization 
mean firms also can offer genuine value to cus-
tomers through customized product and service 
propositions.
</p>
<p>As these changes drive the marketplace to 
become more relationship-oriented, the primary 
way to maintain market share is to realign busi-
ness strategies and become customer centric. 
Thus, CRM is critically strategically important in 
company positioning in today&rsquo;s market.
</p>
<p>1.2.3  Changes with&nbsp;Respect 
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Marketing Function
</p>
<p>Finally, changes in technology and society also 
lead to shifts in the role of the marketing function. 
These shifts are strongly affected by changes in the 
usage and availability of classic and new media 
channels, as well as a dramatic reduction in the 
effectiveness of marketing activities.
</p>
<p> Media Dilution and&nbsp;Channel 
Multiplication
</p>
<p>The nature of marketing communications is 
undergoing significant shifts. Brand managers, 
service providers, and product manufacturers once 
used mass communication vehicles (print, TV, 
radio) as their prime carriers. The messages 
focused on product and price, with little regard to 
heterogeneity in customer needs or wants. 
Communication based on mass advertising is 
largely a thing of the past though. Customer needs 
and wants have simply become too diverse for 
marketers to satisfy them with a single, all-purpose 
</p>
<p>approach. Also, the consumption of media outlets 
is shifting. Radio and print consumption are slowly 
decreasing, whereas television viewings remains 
relatively stable and online channels are sky rock-
ing. This has significant consequences for the com-
panies&rsquo; marketing strategies. Furthermore, more 
and more consumers stream TV shows on demand 
rather than watching them on cable TV.&nbsp;Netflix or 
Amazon Prime services for example allow users to 
watch their favorite television shows, regardless of 
the network that aired them, at their convenience 
and on the device they choose (e.g., Apple&rsquo;s iPad). 
The &lsquo;video on demand&rsquo; market is expected to reach 
a revenue of US$ 17.9 million in 2017 and US$ 23.8 
million in 2020 (Statista, 2017).
</p>
<p>Another important trend is the rise of 
YouTube. Rather than watching television shows 
younger consumers tend to watch videos on 
YouTube. In 2015, around 400&nbsp; h of video are 
uploaded to YouTube every minute, ten times 
more than in 2011 (Youtube, 2017).
</p>
<p> Decreasing Marketing Efficiency 
and&nbsp;Effectiveness
</p>
<p>Pressure has been growing on corporate market-
ers to revamp their departments to demonstrate 
how marketing investments improve the compa-
ny&rsquo;s bottom line profits. In fact managers are more 
and more under pressure to justify their market-
ing spending. The famous saying by John 
Wanemaker (1838&ndash;1922)&mdash;&laquo;I know that half of 
the money I spend on advertising is wasted, I just 
don&rsquo;t know which half&raquo;&mdash;has probably never been 
as true as it is today. We thus can understand the 
demands of shareholders and CFOs who want 
better accountability and documentation of the 
value added by the marketing function.
</p>
<p>The problem stems in part from previous mar-
keting practices that focused on acquisition rather 
than retention, price rather than added value, and 
short-term transactions rather than the develop-
ment of lasting, profitable relationships. The pro-
liferation of new contact channels contributes to 
decreasing efficiency and effectiveness as well. 
With the emergence of more sophisticated and 
knowledgeable customers, the existing situation 
includes flat or increasing costs of contact but 
decreasing consumer responses (see . Fig.&nbsp; 1.1). 
The impact of advertising in any medium has lost 
some value. The phenomenon of media prolifera-
tion is paralleled by the difficulty of communicat-
ing meaningfully with customers. As more and 
</p>
<p> Chapter 1 &middot; Strategic CRM Today</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11 1
</p>
<p>more media channels become available, and firms 
use more of them, the challenge of channel coor-
dination increases. The complexity associated 
with coordinating messages across greater num-
bers of channels thus increases exponentially.
</p>
<p>Another reason for the decreasing advertising 
effectiveness is the streaming behavior of con-
sumers. Streaming services usually do not show 
any ads. Also, consumers are increasingly using 
ad blocker when surfing online. These trends 
minimize consumers&rsquo; exposure towards ads. 
Thus, companies have to think about new ways to 
reach and interact with the customer.
</p>
<p> Consequences
</p>
<p>The pressure on the marketing function is intense. 
The shift from a one sided unilateral conversation 
between the firm and the customer to a multilat-
eral conversation between several customers and 
the firm increase the complexity of the marketing 
function even further. Marketers have to care-
fully listen and monitor consumer reviews and 
feedback provided online. To engage the cus-
tomer they also have to be open to the new cus-
tomer role as an interactive part in the customer 
firm relationship as well willing to give up some 
of their control. Furthermore, they have to find 
new ways to interact with the customer. 
Otherwise, they will take a back seat and effec-
tively be restricted to advertising and media plan-
ning. Also marketing manager need to adjust 
their marketing strategies to overcome the 
increased ad skepticism and ad avoidance of con-
sumers by contacting the consumer through 
multiple channels and being more transparent 
and honest.
</p>
<p>1.2.4  Implications
</p>
<p>Given all these changes, the marketing scenario 
today makes greater demands to learn about cus-
tomer preferences, value provision, and product 
and service customization. Product-centric strate-
gies cannot address these advanced requirements, 
but customer-centric strategies are emerging in 
response. In exactly this environment, CRM, if 
executed correctly, represents a formidable com-
petitive means to satisfy new demands. Marketers 
need a management approach that realizes 
increasing customer heterogeneity, addresses con-
cerns about marketing accountability, puts avail-
able data to good use, and uses customer 
profitability as a key objective function. We term 
this approach customer value management.
</p>
<p>1.3  The Benefits of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Customer 
Value Management Approach
</p>
<p>A successful data-based CRM system, with cus-
tomer value as its driving metric, empowers a 
company to perform ten actions that will lead to 
strategic advantages.
 1. Integrate and consolidate customer infor-
</p>
<p>mation: With relevant customer informa-
tion and client histories, the treatment of a 
customer remains consistent across contact 
and service channels.
</p>
<p> 2. Provide consolidated information across 
all channels: The entire company must assist 
in timely and relevant communication with 
customers, matching their needs with the 
most appropriate product.

 3. Manage customer cases: This action 
</p>
<p>provides the right person with manage-
ment control in a planned and transparent 
manner, ensuring that appropriate responses 
occur at the proper time.
</p>
<p> 4. Personalize: If possible, personalization 
should span both the service and products 
offered to each customer to satisfy his or her 
special expectations.
</p>
<p> 5. Automatically and manually generate new 
sales opportunities: Measures of customer 
profiles can rely on predefined business 
rules or contact between a customer and an 
employee.
</p>
<p> 6. Generate and manage campaigns: 
Companies should provide sufficient flexibil-
ity to adapt to changes in customer informa-
tion or behavior.
</p>
<p> 7. Yield faster and more accurate follow-up: 
Such efforts include sales leads, referrals, and 
customer inquiries.
</p>
<p> 8. Manage all business processes: The firm 
should introduce a central point of control 
to ensure all business processes are executed 
in accordance with predetermined, effective 
business rules.
</p>
<p> 9. Give top managers a detailed and accurate 
picture: All members of the top manage-
ment team should be aware of all sales and 
marketing activities.
</p>
<p> 10. Instantly react to changing market 
environments: To understand the develop-
</p>
<p>ment toward data-oriented customer value 
management, it is helpful to take a closer 
look at the evolution and growth stages of 
CRM in recent years.
</p>
<p>1.4  Evolution and&nbsp;Growth of&nbsp;CRM
</p>
<p>This section describes the stages of development 
of CRM, from the 1990s until today. It has grown 
from a tactical marketing tool to a strategic 
 element in all marketing decisions. The growth of 
the Internet also has increased the adoption rate 
of CRM in many industries. To provide a histori-
cal perspective, . Fig.&nbsp;1.2 depicts a timeline, and 
this section describes each of the phases in that 
timeline.
</p>
<p>1.4.1 First Generation 
(Functional&nbsp;CRM)
</p>
<p>The collection of activities that later took on the 
umbrella acronym CRM originally developed as 
two independent product offerings:
 1. Sales force automation (SFA): These prod-
</p>
<p>ucts addressed presales functions such as 
maintaining prospect and customer data, 
telemarketing, generating leads, creating sales 
quotes, and placing sales orders.
</p>
<p> 2. Customer service and support (CSS): 
This function addressed mainly after-sales

</p>
<p>activities, such as help desks, contact and 
call centers, and field service support. The 
CSS databases often worked with specific 
customer information, isolated from other 
systems.
</p>
<p>Although fragmented and poorly integrated 
with the back office, early SFA/CSS applica-
tions  delivered the promise of sales and service 
improvements, though their combined market 
niche remained small. The market for enterprise 
resource planning (ERP)&mdash;a tool designed to 
integrate all company departments and functions 
within a single computer system that served every 
department&rsquo;s needs&mdash;instead was growing.
</p>
<p>1.4.2  Second Generation (Customer-
Facing Front-End Approach)
</p>
<p>Innovations in CRM during the 1990s matched 
those of ERP, including the integration of differ-
ent independent subsystems into one package. 
CRM technology was expected to fill the gaps left 
by ERP functionality and address the business 
needs of the company&rsquo;s customer-facing front 
end.
</p>
<p>The goal was to create a single view of all inter-
actions with customers, independent of the pur-
pose of that contact (e.g., pre-sales, sales 
</p>
<p>transaction, post-sales service) or its means (e.g., 
telephone, e-mail, Internet). For the most part, this 
goal was not achieved during the 1990s, leading to 
increasing disillusionment with CRM technology 
and implementations. Customer expectations in 
this period far exceeded the realized benefits of 
CRM technology. Industry observers began talk-
ing about the demise of CRM.&nbsp;Even as the Internet 
fuelled new expectations, it became clear that rev-
enue increases through technology were difficult 
to implement, realize, and measure, without a 
more strategic understanding of the process 
(. Fig.&nbsp;1.3).
</p>
<p>1.4.3  Third Generation (Strategic 
Approach)
</p>
<p>By the end of 2002, the CRM market had started 
to pick up, and the gap between customers&rsquo; per-
ceived value and value realized was closing. 
Organizations learned from experience and their 
failure to implement prior versions of CRM.&nbsp;The 
best organizations began to focus on integrating 
customer-facing front-end systems with back-end 
systems, as well as with the systems used by part-
ners and suppliers (see . Fig.&nbsp;1.3).
</p>
<p>The integration of the Internet technology 
helped to boost CRM.&nbsp; Many organizations real-
ized that they could benefit by adopting a strategic

CRM approach rather than blindly implementing 
technology-based solutions. Companies recog-
nized the eventual goal of CRM: to grow revenue, 
not just control costs.
</p>
<p>1.4.4  Fourth Generation (Agile 
and&nbsp;Flexible Strategic CRM)
</p>
<p>At the end of the first decade of the twenty-first 
century, we face the start of the fourth generation 
of CRM.&nbsp; Strategic CRM is widely accepted and 
established as an essential element of the market-
ing strategy, and an ever-increasing number of 
small and medium-sized companies adopt this 
management tool and its corresponding technol-
ogies to drive their business. Agility, flexibility, 
and low fixed costs are key. The emergence of 
social media and increased self-service, as well as 
the growing prevalence of web-based services, 
mean that customer empowerment is an emerg-
ing topic. In particular, CRM technology on a 
pay-per-use basis can provide on-demand 
 functionality.
</p>
<p>1.4.5  Fifth Generation (Social CRM)
</p>
<p>The development of the new technological 
advances and the unprecedented reach of social 
media gave rise to the fifth generation of 
CRM.&nbsp; Social CRM is characterized by the 
engagement of the customer through the inte-
gration of the web 2.0 and social media and by 
the use of data driven insights to optimize the 
overall customer experience. Companies 
encourage active customer participation online, 
while they use software applications to track real 
time social data. This information enables com-
panies to offer relevant content and personalized 
messages to specific customers and to improve 
the customer experience at each touchpoint 
along the customer journey. Additionally, the 
combination of data across different social 
media platforms allows companies to determine 
the customer value not only based on profitabil-
ity but also based on their online behavior in 
terms of referrals, knowledge dispersion and 
influencing other members of the social media 
community.
</p>
<p>1.5  CRM and&nbsp;the&nbsp;IT Revolution: 
The&nbsp;View from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Industry
</p>
<p>Considering these major market and technology 
shifts and their contributions to the rapid devel-
opment of CRM as a strategic management tool, 
we also want to shed light on what industry exec-
utives think of this evolution, in terms of how it 
appears in practice.
</p>
<p> &raquo; In my discussions with senior executives 
around the world about the power of 
</p>
<p>IT systems and networked computing, I 
</p>
<p>consistently make the point that the real 
</p>
<p>revolution isn&rsquo;t about the technology itself. 
</p>
<p>The real revolution here has to do with 
</p>
<p>institutional change&mdash;the fundamental 
</p>
<p>transformation of time-honored ways of doing 
</p>
<p>things. (Lou Gerstner, former CEO IBM)
</p>
<p>Consider a comment from a CRM consultant:
</p>
<p> &raquo; One of the reasons I prefer to deal with 
SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] 
</p>
<p>in implementing CRM is that I always have 
</p>
<p>direct access to the CEO of the business to 
</p>
<p>ensure they understand what CRM is about. 
</p>
<p>We always put the strategies together first, 
</p>
<p>then find a technology solution that makes 
</p>
<p>carrying out those strategies easier. I strongly 
</p>
<p>believe the much-touted 70% failure rate of 
</p>
<p>CRM projects has resulted from a too-heavy 
</p>
<p>reliance on technology.
</p>
<p>There is still a major issue in CRM of 
</p>
<p>people not understanding what it is all 
</p>
<p>about&mdash;which is listening to the customer 
</p>
<p>and communicating with them in a manner 
</p>
<p>most likely to increase their satisfaction 
</p>
<p>and win repeat and referral business. 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I believe this reliance on 
</p>
<p>technology has been driven by the big CRM 
</p>
<p>information technology players. CEOs of 
</p>
<p>major companies see it as something that 
</p>
<p>they simply must do, without understanding 
</p>
<p>what it is all about.
</p>
<p>This view of CRM represents a substantial 
adjustment. Some managers initially became dis-
illusioned with the process and results of imple-
menting CRM solutions and systems. They felt 
that they reaped limited benefits from new IT 
systems, faced resentment among employees 
</p>
<p> Chapter 1 &middot; Strategic CRM Today</p>

</p>
<p>when implementing them, and gained little in 
terms of being able to offer added value to cus-
tomers.
</p>
<p>This negative reaction to CRM as it was prac-
ticed was based on an IT view of the world. Too 
often, the introduction of CRM has been regarded 
as a technological project and temporary activity. 
Managers simply believed that CRM equaled soft-
ware or technology, though nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth. With these misconceptions, it 
is no surprise that many CRM efforts never met 
the expectations of the companies implementing 
them.
</p>
<p>For CRM to be implemented successfully, top 
management must integrate all corporate func-
tions and focus them on customer value. The 
growth of CRM also should not be equated with 
the growth of what has been called the CRM 
industry, which consists mainly of IT vendors. 
Darrell Rigby, from Bain &amp; Co., researches the use 
of management tools and finds that both CRM 
tool usage and satisfaction with CRM have been 
relatively high in recent years. This finding implies 
that companies may have learned to view CRM as 
a strategic marketing element; they are realizing 
its untapped potential. The future thus is bright 
for CRM, and with the aid of appropriate IT sys-
tems, CRM can become a preferred marketing 
approach for many firms.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>The increasing availability of technology 
</p>
<p>allows firms to collect and analyze customer-
</p>
<p>level data and interact with customers simul-
</p>
<p>taneously. Yet rapid changes are taking place 
</p>
<p>in the environment in which firms operate, 
</p>
<p>which make the development of new market 
</p>
<p>strategies and a shift from a product focus 
</p>
<p>toward a customer-centric offer necessary. 
</p>
<p>These changes, as introduced in this chapter, 
</p>
<p>pertain to (1) consumers, (2) marketplaces, 
</p>
<p>and (3) marketing functions.
</p>
<p>On the consumer front, growing diversity 
</p>
<p>reflects the changing demographic composi-
</p>
<p>tion of market populations. Consumers are 
</p>
<p>becoming more demanding&nbsp;&ndash; goods and 
</p>
<p>services are no longer sufficient to satisfy 
</p>
<p>them; they also suffer increasing time pres-
</p>
<p>sures, exhibit more technology savvy, look 
</p>
<p>for more convenience, and use social media. 
</p>
<p>The marketplace is characterized by more 
</p>
<p>intense competition, greater fragmentation, 
</p>
<p>and increasing difficulties in terms of dif-
</p>
<p>ferentiation. These changes have driven the 
</p>
<p>marketplace to become relationship-based 
</p>
<p>and customer- centric. Traditional advertising 
</p>
<p>is becoming less effective for example due 
</p>
<p>to increased streaming and the use of ad 
</p>
<p>blockers. At the same time, interactions and 
</p>
<p>relationships with individual customer grow 
</p>
<p>in importance. For firms, this means they 
</p>
<p>should collect and analyze information about 
</p>
<p>consumers, their needs, and their preferences, 
</p>
<p>which also sets the stage for a successful CRM 
</p>
<p>implementation.
</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You Know?
 1. Since Facebook, Twitter and YouTube 
</p>
<p>are banned the most important social 
</p>
<p>Networks in China are Weibo and WeChat. 
</p>
<p>In April 2017 Weibo (a mix between 
</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter) reached 313 
</p>
<p>million active users, while WeChat, China&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>most widely used messaging app, got 
</p>
<p>even 889 million active users. In order to 
</p>
<p>enter and successfully compete in China, 
</p>
<p>foreign companies thus need to make 
</p>
<p>their brands present and recognizable 
</p>
<p>on these social media networks. Doing 
</p>
<p>so will help them to gain insights about 
</p>
<p>Chinese customers and to interact 
</p>
<p>with them. Three western companies 
</p>
<p>that already use Weibo successfully are 
</p>
<p>Coca-Cola, Lanc&ocirc;me and Luis Vuitton 
</p>
<p>(Facebook et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> 2. More and more customers are joining 
</p>
<p>some sort of social media network. In 
</p>
<p>February 2017, there are 3.773 billion 
</p>
<p>active users worldwide. Compared to 
</p>
<p>2016 the number of active users increased 
</p>
<p>by 21%. The most popular social media 
</p>
<p>network by far is Facebook followed by 
</p>
<p>WhatsApp. The relative number of active 
</p>
<p>users (compared to the total population) 
</p>
<p>differs however greatly across the various 
</p>
<p>countries. For example, in Kenya, Liberia, 
</p>
<p>and Madagascar the penetration of social

</p>
<p>in Malta or New Zealand it is much higher 
</p>
<p>amounting to 84% and 70% respectively

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we discussed the con-
</p>
<p>cept of CRM and understood its role, evolution, 
</p>
<p>and future. In this chapter, we explore what can 
</p>
<p>be gained by strategically utilizing CRM and 
</p>
<p>which pitfalls you should be aware of. At the 
</p>
<p>heart of strategic CRM stands relationship mar-
</p>
<p>keting which has gained substantial traction also 
</p>
<p>in light of the digital transformation. The goal of 
</p>
<p>a company that employs relationship marketing 
</p>
<p>is to sustain relationships with its customers by 
</p>
<p>tailoring its offerings to the individual customer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>needs. This approach stands in stark contrast 
</p>
<p>to traditional mass-marketing and has become 
</p>
<p>achievable and feasible due to the advances 
</p>
<p>made in flexible manufacturing processes such 
</p>
<p>as mass- customization, the shift to the internet 
</p>
<p>with its possibilities regarding data collection, 
</p>
<p>interaction with customers, high reach even for 
</p>
<p>niche offerings, and individualized advertising, 
</p>
<p>as well as progress made in analytical and pre-
</p>
<p>dictive modelling. These opportunities associ-
</p>
<p>ated with the ongoing digital transformation go 
</p>
<p>hand in hand with threats of a rise in competitive 
</p>
<p>pressure, especially online where barriers to 
</p>
<p>entry are low and competition is truly global 
</p>
<p>(EIU, 2007).
</p>
<p>At the same time, consumers increasingly 
</p>
<p>demand products and services that meet their 
</p>
<p>specific and individual needs as they have 
</p>
<p>gotten used to being able to choose from a 
</p>
<p>large variety of suppliers and an abundance of 
</p>
<p>offerings (EIU, 2016). Consequently, marketers 
</p>
<p>need to recognize that, today, relationships 
</p>
<p>with individual customers are at the heart of 
</p>
<p>decision-making and the foundation of compet-
</p>
<p>itive advantage. In this regard, there has been 
</p>
<p>a visible shift from product- based marketing to 
</p>
<p>customer-based marketing (EIU, 2016). Further-
</p>
<p>more, in order to stay relevant, companies must 
</p>
<p>be able to maximize the value they deliver to 
</p>
<p>their customers while at the same time extract-
</p>
<p>ing enough value from customers to achieve 
</p>
<p>positive ROIs (Kumar &amp; Reinartz, 2016)&nbsp;&ndash; as 
</p>
<p>indicated by the highlighted area in . Fig.&nbsp;2.1. 
As we are showing in this chapter, strategically 
</p>
<p>implemented CRM is a key component to meet 
</p>
<p>this challenge.
</p>
<p>The chapter is structured as follows: First, 
</p>
<p>we elaborate on the importance of creating 
</p>
<p>value for customers in order to derive value 
</p>
<p>from them. Subsequently, we illustrate the 
</p>
<p>underlying processes using the Satisfaction-
</p>
<p>Loyalty-Profit Chain (SPC). Finally, we dive 
</p>
<p>deeper into the concept of value of customer 
</p>
<p>relationships dissecting it into four core dimen-
</p>
<p>sions of value that companies can derive from 
</p>
<p>their customers.
</p>
<p>2.1  Value to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Customer
</p>
<p>A company&rsquo;s very existence is based on the prem-
ise that it creates value for its customers&nbsp;&ndash; regard-
less of whether in terms of a good or a service, an 
end product or an input factor, and whether in a 
B2B or B2C setting. Only when it achieves to 
deliver value to customers, it is able to extract 
value from customers. Unsurprisingly, the major-
ity of the most valuable companies in the world 
have a mission statement that mentions the cre-
ation of value for their customers and/or stake-
holders (Kumar &amp; Reinartz, 2016).
</p>
<p>Consequently, creating and sustaining value 
for customers is at the heart of business in general 
and marketing and CRM specifically as they are 
the vehicles through which companies can deliver 
value to its customers.
</p>
<p>But what is value from a customer&rsquo;s point of 
view? In classical economic theory, customers 
strive to maximize utility, i.e. they choose the 
product/service that delivers them the highest 
value. However, as common sense dictates, what 
constitutes the highest value for a customer is 
highly heterogeneous across as well as within indi-
viduals (Zeithaml, 1988). This means that the 
value of a cold beer might be perceived very differ-
ently by you vis-&agrave;-vis your spouse and even by 
yourself dependent on the time of the day, the 
location, the temperature, the number of beers you 
have already consumed, etc. Hence, when we talk 
about value to the customer at the end of the day 
we always talk about perceived customer value.
</p>
<p>Perceived customer value, in turn, can be 
deconstructed into perceived benefits and per-
ceived costs. Customers derive benefits from the 
</p>
<p> Chapter 2 &middot; Concepts of&nbsp;Customer Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19 2
</p>
<p>different attributes of the offering and a company 
can influence the perception of benefits by alter-
ing the offering&rsquo;s attributes. Perceived costs do not 
only include the price of an offering but also other 
costs that are often neglected by researchers and 
practitioners such as different transaction costs, 
learning costs and risks (Kumar &amp; Reinartz, 2016).
</p>
<p>An offering can be dissected into a variety of 
attributes that are product- and service-specific. 
Of these, some can be assessed and compared 
objectively while others are of more subjective 
nature. For a camera, these might constitute 
zoom, the number of pixels, the size of sensor, 
weight, size, color. Customers rarely perceive 
these attributes individually but rather in com-
posite, in this case, for example, image quality, 
compactness, and design. The resulting benefits 
or costs can be perceived directly or indirectly 
(e.g. high image quality from a good camera is a 
direct benefit while recognition from your peers 
for good photos constitutes an indirect benefit) 
and they may occur immediately or delayed (e.g. 
costs for memory cards or additional batteries for 
the camera) Gutman, 1982).
</p>
<p>A key component of CRM and its application 
is its direct and two-sided interaction with cus-
tomers through a variety of touchpoints. Hence, a 
core function and capability of CRM is its ability 
to influence a customer&rsquo;s perceived value of the 
company&rsquo;s offering. Let us take the example of a 
mobile service: In the physical store, the customer 
goes to the helpdesk to ask questions about her 
new device, which decreases her learning costs. 
At home, through the use of a self-service app, she 
tops up her credits, thus reducing transaction 
costs in the form of time if she had to go to a shop 
or call a hotline. Before going to Europe for holi-
days she calls customer care to ask for her tariff &rsquo;s 
roaming costs. The CRM agent on the other end 
of the line suggests her a special data package for 
Europe, effectively customizing the attributes of 
the company&rsquo;s offering to meet her personal 
needs, thereby increasing the customer&rsquo;s percep-
tion of benefits.
</p>
<p>In summary, strategically employed CRM can 
improve customers&rsquo; perception of an offering and 
meet the demand for solutions to customer- 
specific needs.

<p>2.2  Value to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Company
</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we have described the 
importance for companies to deliver value to 
their customers. In the following chapters, we will 
explore what is in it for the company. 7 Section 2.2.1 
presents the Satisfaction-Loyalty-Profit chain (SPC) 
that explains why and under which  circumstances 
delivering value to customers can, in the end, trans-
late to value for the firm while 7 Sect. 2.2.1  presents 
the Satisfaction-Loyalty-Profit chain (SPC).
</p>
<p>2.2.1  From Value for&nbsp;Customers 
to&nbsp;Value from&nbsp;Customers: 
The&nbsp;Satisfaction-Loyalty-Profit 
Chain
</p>
<p>The SPC is a key concept in the realm of customer 
management as it links CRM activities to profits  
(see . Fig.&nbsp;2.2). It has been popular since the early 
1990s, when companies realized the importance of 
measuring and managing customer satisfaction 
(Heskett et al.,  1994). The key underlying idea is 
that improving product and service attributes will 
lead to an improvement in customer satisfaction. 
Increased customer satisfaction, i.e. increased value 
for the customer is expected to lead to greater cus-
tomer retention, which is often used as a proxy for 
customer loyalty, which then is expected to lead to 
greater profitability or value from the customer. 
Despite the almost self-evident nature of these posi-
tive links, the empirical evidence from a number of 
</p>
<p>years of research shows only mixed support 
(Zeithaml, 2000). Likewise, translating the concep-
tual framework into practical reality has been prob-
lematic for many firms. For example, a firm may 
have improved its performance on a key attribute, 
only to discover that the overall satisfaction score 
did not noticeably increase. At other times, changes 
in overall satisfaction scores have failed to show a 
demonstrable impact on customer retention (Ittner 
&amp; Larcker, 2003). We believe, therefore, that it is 
critical to have a complete understanding of the 
entire SPC and its individual links in order to man-
age customers in an efficient manner. In the follow-
ing, we disassemble the SPC and analyze its 
individual components one by one. Thereby, we 
show under which conditions CRM activities in fact 
lead to increased profits and which pitfalls to avoid. 
After considering the level of analysis, customer 
level vis-&agrave;-vis firm level, we analyze the shortcom-
ings of drawing a direct link between customer sat-
isfaction and profits. Subsequently, we discuss under 
which circumstances increased customer satisfac-
tion may improve a firm&rsquo;s customer retention rate 
and how increased retention rates, in turn, may lead 
to higher profits.
</p>
<p> The Level of&nbsp;Analysis
</p>
<p>When employing the SPC concept, it is worth-
while to consider the level of analysis. Most of the 
empirical studies have looked at aggregate, firm- 
level results. For example, a series of studies 
(Anderson, Fornell, &amp; Lehmann, 1994; Anderson, 
Fornell, &amp; Rust, 1997) looked at how firm-level

</p>
<p>customer satisfaction indices are linked to firm- 
level performance.
</p>
<p>The findings from this and similar studies 
indicate a positive association between the com-
panywide satisfaction score and company&rsquo;s overall 
performance. However, in a world where resources 
are allocated on the individual customer level, the 
chain needs to be implemented at a disaggregate 
level. There is much less hard evidence of the 
nature of the SPC on the individual customer 
level. Although one would expect a correlation 
between firm-level and individual-level results, it 
is not clear how strong this correlation really is.
</p>
<p> The Direct Link Between Customer 
Satisfaction and Profits
</p>
<p>The direct link between customer satisfaction and 
profits suggests that as customers experience greater 
satisfaction with a firm&rsquo;s offering, profits rise. For 
example, a study by Edvardsson and  colleagues 
(2000) found that the stated sales satisfaction of 
Volvo customers is significantly linked to new car 
profitability (e.g., through closing financing and 
insurance deals, Volvo card membership, and work-
shop loyalty). Many companies other than Volvo 
can attest to the benefit of SPC.&nbsp;For instance, Zappos 
Inc., an online shoe and apparel retailer has gone to 
great lengths to maintain its high level of customer 
satisfaction. The company&rsquo;s focus on customer ser-
vice includes utmost customer satisfaction and, free 
return shipping in case of problems with the pur-
chase. While excessive returns may eat into com-
pany profits, for Zappos this is an &laquo;acceptable risk&raquo; 
in return for increased profits through customer 
loyalty. This customer service selling point, in addi-
tion to special training for their customer service 
representatives, has propelled Zappos to its success.
</p>
<p>But, what do we know, in general, about this 
direct link between satisfaction and profitability? 
Although early proponents of the SPC argued 
customer satisfaction always has a positive 
bottom- line impact, we have a much more com-
plete picture today. It is interesting to note 
research on the direct relationship between satis-
faction and profits has shown both positive effects 
in a limited number of studies (Ittner &amp; Larcker, 
1998), and no effects in other studies (Zeithaml, 
2000). In other words, while there is empirical 
evidence to suggest that a variety of quality strate-
gies failed to deliver anticipated business perfor-
mance, there is also contrasting evidence that 
indicates a positive correlation between customer 
satisfaction and return on assets.
</p>
<p>What is important to understand and explains 
some of the seemingly contradictory findings, is 
that it is simply not enough to link satisfaction and 
revenues. Improving customer satisfaction comes 
at a cost, and once the cost of enhancing satisfac-
tion is factored in, it may well be that offering 
&laquo;excessive satisfaction&raquo; does not pay. This is 
because the marginal gains in satisfaction decrease, 
while the marginal expenses to achieve the growth 
in satisfaction increase. This falls in line with what 
is said about the vastly improved product quality 
offered by many firms today. As the general level of 
quality reaches high levels, it becomes more and 
more costly to improve satisfaction with a further 
rise in quality. For example, is an investment in 
another ride justified for an amusement park, given 
the expected incremental traffic? Although the 
additional ride is likely to increase customer satis-
faction, the question is whether it generates enough 
additional revenues to offset the investment. In 
addition, increasing customer satisfaction leads, in 
many cases, to an adaptation of expectation levels; 
consumers quickly get used to a better service level 
without necessarily rewarding the firm with addi-
tional purchases. What this probably means is that 
there is an optimum satisfaction level for any firm, 
beyond which increasing satisfaction does not pay. 
To find such an optimum level, firms need to con-
duct longitudinal satisfaction studies to investigate 
changes in customer satisfaction over time and link 
them to improvements in their offering.
</p>
<p> The Link Between Satisfaction 
and&nbsp;Retention
</p>
<p>Given some of the difficulties associated with 
establishing unequivocal links between customer 
satisfaction and company performance, the 1990s 
witnessed many managers increasingly turning to 
customer retention as a long-term goal. By focus-
ing on customer retention, managers moved 
closer to the ultimate dependent variable&nbsp;&ndash; prof-
its. . Figure&nbsp;2.3 shows a typical shape confirmed 
by a number of studies (even though there can be 
considerable departures from this shape). The 
data is typically derived at the firm level, not the 
customer level.
</p>
<p>The data show the link between satisfaction and 
retention is asymmetric: Dissatisfaction has a 
greater impact on retention than satisfaction. A 
satisfied customer is influenced by many factors 
when making a purchase and has many options. 
Even if the level of satisfaction is high, retention is 
not guaranteed, as there may be another product 
</p>
<p>2.2 &middot; Value to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Company</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>that would satisfy the customer to the same extent. 
Conversely, if the customer is dissatisfied, then the 
other product becomes more enticing. The link is 
nonlinear; the impact of satisfaction on retention is 
greater at the extremes. The flat part of the curve in 
the middle has also been called the zone of indiffer-
ence (Jones &amp; Sasser, 1995). As seen in the indus-
try-level databases (such as the ACSI from the 
University of Michigan), a number of factors-
including the aggressiveness of competition, degree 
of switching cost, and the level of perceived risk&nbsp;&ndash; 
influence the shape of the curve and the position of 
the elbows (the two points in the graph where there 
is a sharp change in the shape of the curve).
</p>
<p>An example of the variable link between sat-
isfaction and retention can be demonstrated. 
. Figure&nbsp;2.4 shows the variability in the relation-
ship across industries. In . Fig.&nbsp; 2.4, in the com-
petitive automotive industry, very high levels 
of satisfaction are necessary for a customer to 
repurchase the same brand again. On the contrary, 
consumers may incur considerable switching costs 
when utilizing an airline. This cost might increase 
due to bonus-point build-up in frequent-flyer pro-
grams or limited airline choice at any given airport. 
Thus, consumers tend to re-patronize an airline 
even though satisfaction might only be moderate.
</p>
<p>The same caveats that apply to the satisfaction- 
profit link also apply to the satisfaction-retention 
link. First, firms should thoroughly investigate the 
nature of the link for a specific industry, category, or 
segment. For example, two firms operating in two 
</p>
<p>different industries might have identical satisfaction 
levels, yet the relationship between customer satis-
faction and retention might be quite different for the 
two firms. To assess the impact of satisfaction on 
retention in a better manner, firms must account for 
the attractiveness of alternatives in addition to what 
they offer. Another aspect to consider is that the link 
might change, depending on the measurement 
employed for the loyalty measured. For example, a 
study (Mital &amp; Kamakura, 2001) found that repur-
chase behavior is a better measure than repurchase 
intent. Finally, we know comparatively less about 
the link on an individual customer level as com-
pared to a company or industry level analyses.
</p>
<p> The Link Between Loyalty and&nbsp;Profits
</p>
<p>Due to the complexity and specificity of the links, 
taking customer satisfaction as a proxy measure 
for customer loyalty or for customer profits is not 
a viable solution. Therefore, it is not surprising to 
see increasing interest in examining the direct 
link between customer retention and a firm&rsquo;s per-
formance. The key proponent of looking at this 
link is Frederick F.&nbsp;Reichheld, who, in a series of 
writings, stresses the importance of managing 
customer retention (Reichheld, Markey, &amp; 
Hopton, 2000).
</p>
<p>Long-term customers supposedly do the fol-
lowing, according to the principal hypotheses of 
Reichheld:
</p>
<p> 5 Spend more per period over time.
 5 Cost less to serve per period over time.

</p>

paid by short-term customers.
</p>
<p>The underlying argument is that customers are 
acquired at a cost, which then gets recovered over 
time, thus becoming more and more profitable 
over time. Although this might hold true in a con-
tractual relationship (e.g., magazine subscription, 
cable TV contract) it hardly holds true in a non-
contractual relationship (such as shopping in a 
department store). In a noncontractual relation-
ship, the revenue stream must be balanced by the 
cost of constantly sustaining the relationship and 
fending off competitive attacks. However, manag-
ing these constant investments in customer rela-
tionships can be quite tricky. Obviously, a high 
retention rate is very desirable, but increasing the 
marginal retention comes at an increasing cost. 
Blindly increasing retention spending will eventu-
ally lead to overspending. Clearly, efforts at increas-
ing customer satisfaction and retention not only 
consume a firm&rsquo;s resources, but are subject to 
diminishing returns. In addition, be aware that 
Reichheld&rsquo;s propositions are derived from asking 
managers about what they believe the benefits of 
relation are. Since managerial opinions can be 
</p>
<p>biased and self-serving, it is important to conse-
quently investigate actual customer behavior in 
order to investigate the true, more underlying, link.
</p>
<p>Reinartz and Kumar have tested Reichheld&rsquo;s 
propositions by investigating the profitability of a 
sample of more than 16,000 individual customers 
across four industries (Reinartz &amp; Kumar, 2002). 
Their results bring out a different picture. 
Essentially, the researchers found the relationship 
between customer retention and customer profits 
is not as strong as anticipated. Reinartz and 
Kumar demonstrate, for example, that, across dif-
ferent firms, there is a segment of customers who 
are loyal but not very profitable (due to excessive 
resource allocation), and a segment that generates 
very high profits although it has only a short ten-
ure. Since these short-term customers can be very 
profitable, it is clear that loyalty is not the only 
path to profitability. As the following figure illus-
trates, the overall trend shows a direct correlation 
between loyalty and profitability. However, outli-
ers on the graph who generate high profits while 
not having high loyalty will outperform those 
customers with a high level of loyalty but low 
profitability (see . Fig.&nbsp;2.5).
</p>
<p>The key implication of Reinartz and Kumar&rsquo;s 
finding is that caution must be exercised when 
equating customer retention with customer

</p>
<p> What Does It All Mean?
</p>
<p>Although the SPC is conceptually sound, measur-
ing and managing customer satisfaction is not 
enough. By not understanding the exact nature 
(e.g., strength, symmetry, and nonlinearity) of the 
</p>
<p>various links, many companies have seriously mis-
allocated resources based on an incorrect under-
standing of the underlying mechanisms. The key

importance of moving to the ultimate end of the

<p>customer loyalty is no longer important. However, 
it is important to assess the various links in the SPC 
in a correct manner. As we know today, these links 
are almost always nonlinear, asymmetric, and cer-
tainly segment- and industry- specific. As such, 
taking customer satisfaction or customer loyalty as 
a simple proxy measure for customer profits, is not 
sufficient, and we therefore need to make every 
effort to measure customer- level profitability. 
However, since firms cannot influence profits per 
se (but do so via product and service quality) the 
impact of customer satisfaction and customer loy-
alty as key mediators cannot be neglected.
</p>
<p>Eventually, it is important for companies not 
only to have a loyal customer base but also to have 
an active or engaged customer base.
</p>
<p>For sake of simplicity, we focused on costumer 
profitability as the only outcome variable result-
ing from value for the customer, satisfaction, and 
loyalty so far. Companies can, however, profit 
from engaged customers in other more indirect 
ways, too. These different dimensions of values 
that companies can derive from their customers 
are examined in the following chapter.
</p>
<p>2.2.2  Extending the&nbsp;Concept 
of&nbsp;Customer Value
</p>
<p>The value that firms derive from their customers 
has traditionally been referred to as customer 
lifetime value (CLV) while the total value 
derived from its entire customer base is called 
customer equity (CE) (e.g. Gupta et&nbsp; al., 2006). 
Managing and increasing these two key perfor-
mance indicators has always been a major area 
of responsibility of CRM.&nbsp;The basic idea of CLV 
is that value is not only calculated for a single 
purchase event or all past purchases but that the 
entire length of relationship between a customer 
and a company is estimated alongside the 
assumed cumulative value generated by the cus-
tomer over that relationship lifetime discounted 
for time and costs incurred by sustaining the 
relationship. This perspective is hugely benefi-
cial for managers as&nbsp;&ndash; and in contrast to other 
widely used metrics&nbsp;&ndash; it is not only backward but 
also forward looking. Researchers and practitio-
ners have traditionally used CLV specifically for 
purchase incidents over the lifetime. However, 
engaged customers also provide other forms of 
value to companies that are more indirect and 
</p>
<p>harder to quantify. Therefore, Kumar et&nbsp; al. 
(2010) have established the concept of customer 
engagement value (CEV) which comprises four 
core dimensions of value from the customer to 
the firm. Each of these core dimensions is 
explained in the following:
</p>
<p> Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
</p>
<p>CLV is defined as &laquo;the present value of future prof-
its generated from a customer over his or her life of 
business with the firm&raquo; (Kumar et&nbsp;al., 2010, p.&nbsp;299). 
Hence, it takes into account revenues as well as 
costs. More loyal customers can lead to higher 
CLV through a higher willingness to pay, a higher 
share of wallet, a longer relationship with the firm 
or cross- and up-selling. As discussed in the previ-
ous chapter, loyal customers usually&nbsp;&ndash; but not nec-
essarily&nbsp;&ndash; exhibit a higher CLV.&nbsp;The importance of 
CLV for managerial decision making is supported 
through several studies. For example, Gupta, 
Lehmann, and Stuart (2004) confirm the positive 
link between CLV and firm value while Kumar and 
colleagues (2008) show that optimizing resource 
allocation based on CLV can increase revenues by 
a factor of 10.
</p>
<p> Customer Influencer Value (CIV)
</p>
<p>CIV is another form of value that is well estab-
lished in research and management in the form of 
word of mouth (WOM). However, CIV goes 
beyond a positive or negative reference to a brand 
or offering. It also incorporates customers sharing 
information and knowledge, assisting and gener-
ally interacting with existing or potential custom-
ers. For the recipients, this can reduce costs in the 
form of learning costs, transaction costs and risk, 
and improve the perceived attributes of the offer-
ing. Overall, the utility the recipient derives from 
the offering can be maximized (Kumar et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>Many businesses incorporate functionalities 
and platforms to facilitate this kind of interaction 
among users on their websites or e-shops. While 
brand community forums and reviewing elements 
have already become the norm, new approaches 
to leverage and increase CIV are constantly being 
developed. Amazon, for example, has incor-
porated a &laquo;Customer Questions &amp; Answers&raquo; 
element on product pages that prominently 
features questions asked by potential buyers 
with answers from customers. It also grooms an 
active reviewing culture by maintaining a &laquo;hall of 
fame&raquo; for reviewers. Berlin-based fashion retailer

</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>Zalando provides an aggregate measure of cus-
tomers&rsquo; evaluation of the fit of its footwear.
</p>
<p>A key characteristic of CIV is that it stems from 
customers&rsquo; intrinsic motivation and, therefore, is 
basically free for companies. The previous exam-
ples, however, show that a company can design 
systems that encourage and harness CIV to increase 
its offering&rsquo;s value. It should also be kept in mind 
that CIV can very well become zero when a cus-
tomer does not engage in any of the described 
activities or even negative when a customer spreads 
negative WOM or misinformation (Kumar et&nbsp; al., 
2010). In face of social media platforms and the 
associated increase in reach of customers&rsquo; WOM, 
actively managing CIV is more important than ever 
before, further increasing the relevance of CRM.
</p>
<p>Companies can profit from high CIV through 
increased conversion rates of prospects, contin-
ued usage and, hence, prolonged customer life-
time as well as increased revenues from up- and 
cross-selling and decreased costs through lower 
return rates. Measuring CIV has become easier 
since many of its activities have moved to the 
digital sphere. Automatically differentiating 
between a negative and positive comment about a 
brand or offering is reality today as is measuring 
its reach. However, the challenge is to capture all 
of a customer&rsquo;s influencer behavior as it can take 
place on variety of platforms, through numerous 
channels, and, of course, offline.
</p>
<p> Customer Referral Value (CRV)
</p>
<p>CRV is similar to CIV in some respects as it cap-
tures the value a customer generates from the 
referral of new customers. Instead of being 
intrinsically motivated as in the case of CIV, 
these referrals are the result of a program initi-
ated and incentivized by the company. Hence, a 
customer&rsquo;s CRV is motivated extrinsically and, 
therefore, does not come for free. Nonetheless, 
CRV, in contrast to CIV, cannot become negative 
as rewards are only paid out for successful refer-
rals and should not exceed the CEV of the new 
customer. CRV can reduce a company&rsquo;s acquisi-
tion costs and provide future revenues from its 
increased customer base (Kumar et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p> Customer Knowledge Value (CKV)
</p>
<p>CKV is the value of the information that a cus-
tomer provides a company with (contrary to infor-
mation that a customer provides to other customers 
or prospects which constitutes CIV) (Kumar et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2010). Leveraging customers&rsquo; knowledge has 
recently seen considerable traction fueled by cus-
tomers&rsquo; demand for personalized and innovative 
offerings. A prerequisite to meet this demand is 
information on customers&rsquo; preferences. A com-
pany can extract this information by various 
means that go beyond traditional market and con-
sumer research. A key source of critical informa-
tion is customer feedback and complaints. This is 
not only found in company- owned communica-
tion channels but increasingly on online social 
media or retailer platforms as discussed earlier. 
Researchers have shown that online customer 
reviews can be used to automatically and reliably 
derive customers&rsquo; perception of brands and prod-
uct attributes (Lee &amp; Bradlow, 2011)&nbsp;&ndash; information 
that otherwise would only be available through 
lengthy and costly market and consumer research.
</p>
<p>Another method of leveraging customers&rsquo; 
knowledge is to directly integrate them into the 
value creation process in the form of co-creation. 
Especially in the B2C context, we have seen many 
examples of this in the recent past such as the 
campaign by McDonald&rsquo;s that let customers 
design and vote on self-created burger recipes.
</p>
<p>Customers can be integrated in two ways&nbsp;&ndash; as 
information providers or as co-developers. In the 
case of the McDonald&rsquo;s campaign, customers who 
voted on new burger creations can be classified as 
information providers while those who actually 
created new burger recipes constitute co- developers.
</p>
<p>Co-creation has been facilitated greatly 
through the use of the internet. Companies can 
easily provide customers with the required tools 
to become a co-creator such as NikeiD, the online 
tool that lets customers personalize their Nike 
shoes. Also, customers can easily collaborate with 
each other and with the company through the use 
of online platforms and social media.
</p>
<p>Companies that successfully leverage cus-
tomer knowledge and, hence, increase CKV can 
reap benefits in the form of higher innovation 
success rates&nbsp;&ndash; which usually exhibit notoriously 
high failure rates of 40&ndash;75% (Stevens &amp; Burley, 
2003). But also the quality of existing offerings 
can be improved when customer knowledge is 
implemented adequately. While programs that 
promote and leverage customer knowledge are 
associated with investments, companies can save 
costs in the long run, e.g. due to more efficient 
processes, fewer complaints, and lower spending 
on retention programs.

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>As we have shown in this chapter, delivering 
</p>
<p>value to customers is key for companies to stay 
</p>
<p>relevant in an increasingly competitive market 
</p>
<p>environment with increasingly demanding cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. While a customer&rsquo;s value perception of an 
</p>
<p>offering is a consequence of the offering&rsquo;s attri-
</p>
<p>butes, some findings need to be kept in mind:
</p>
<p> 5 As stated before, the perception of benefits 
and costs and, hence, the perceived value 
</p>
<p>is heterogeneous and volatile&nbsp;&ndash; across and 
</p>
<p>within individuals.
</p>
<p> 5 Attributes are not perceived individually 
but customers will form a composite per-
</p>
<p>ception of the attributes offered. The whole 
</p>
<p>is different from the sum of its parts.
</p>
<p> 5 Attributes may be objective or perceived 
and their effect on value perception may be 
</p>
<p>direct or indirect and may be immediate or 
</p>
<p>delayed.
</p>
<p>Companies, however, also need to generate 
</p>
<p>revenues. Therefore, it is essential that they do 
</p>
<p>not only deliver value to customers but also 
</p>
<p>derive value from them. Strategic CRM plays a 
</p>
<p>key role in successfully managing this balancing 
</p>
<p>act as its proper application can reconcile both 
</p>
<p>ends as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;2.7.
By using a customer-value based approach 
</p>
<p>to CRM marketers are able to generate more 
</p>
<p>profit for the company and increase the satis-
</p>
<p>faction of their customers in the long run. This 
</p>
<p>leads to the satisfaction-profit chain. The key 
</p>
<p>conclusion from the satisfaction profit chain 
</p>
<p>discussion is the importance of shifting the 
</p>
<p>focus towards measuring profitability on a 
</p>
<p>customer level in order to make sensible, long-
</p>
<p>term oriented marketing decisions. This does 
</p>
<p>not mean that knowing the status of customer 
</p>
<p>satisfaction or customer loyalty is no longer 
</p>
<p>important. However, it is important to assess 
</p>
<p>the various links in the SPC in a correct man-
</p>
<p>ner. As we know today, these links are almost 
</p>
<p>always nonlinear, asymmetric, and certainly 
</p>
<p>segment- and industry-specific. As such, taking 
</p>
<p>customer satisfaction or customer loyalty as a 
</p>
<p>simple proxy measure for customer profits is not 
</p>
<p>sufficient, and we therefore need to make every 
</p>
<p>effort to measure customer-level profitability. 
</p>
<p>However, since firms cannot influence profits per 
</p>
<p>se, but do so via product and service quality, the 
</p>
<p>impact of customer satisfaction and customer 
</p>
<p>loyalty as key mediators cannot be neglected. 
</p>
<p>Lastly, managers must also bear in mind that the 
</p>
<p>value individual customers can provide may go 
</p>
<p>beyond immediate one-off monetary transac-
</p>
<p>tions. Over their lifetime as a customer, they can 
</p>
<p>e.g. influence peers, share knowledge, or supply 
</p>
<p>referrals, thus, creating additional revenues or 
</p>
<p>lowering costs for companies.
</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You Know?
 1. While quality and price still dominate 
</p>
<p>customers&rsquo; perception of the value of an 
</p>
<p>offering, other factors are entering the 
</p>
<p>equation. A study by The Regeneration 
</p>
<p>Roadmap shows that the environmen-
</p>
<p>tal and social aspects of an offering are 
</p>
<p>increasingly important attributes for 
</p>
<p>customers. This is especially prevalent in 
</p>
<p>developing markets where 51% of the cus-
</p>
<p>tomers state that they purchase products 
</p>
<p>because they benefit the environment 
</p>
<p>or society (The Regeneration Roadmap, 
</p>
<p>2012). Consequently, what constitutes 
</p>
<p>value to the customer is subject to change 
</p>
<p>which managers need to be aware of 
</p>
<p>when formulating a value proposition.
</p>
<p> 2. Many firms have integrated customers in 
</p>
<p>their product development process lever-
</p>
<p>aging customer knowledge value. One 
</p>
<p>example is the Danish toy manufacturer 
</p>
<p>Lego: Lego enthusiast can submit their 
</p>
<p>own creations online and if it gathers 
</p>
<p>at least 10,000 votes by other users, it is 
</p>
<p>reviewed by Lego. If it passes that stage, 
</p>
<p>the creation is brought to market and the 
</p>
<p>creator receives royalties from the sales 
</p>
<p>(Lego, 2017).

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that strategic 
</p>
<p>CRM consists of multiple dimensions. Yet 
</p>
<p>many companies instead think of CRM only 
</p>
<p>in terms of technology, so they look for a 
</p>
<p>software-based quick fix, without examining 
</p>
<p>the key elements of successful CRM.&nbsp;That is 
</p>
<p>why we can find so many CRM failures. Too 
</p>
<p>many projects have been abandoned, with 
</p>
<p>investments written off as wasted. But just 
</p>
<p>as building a house requires an architectural 
</p>
<p>plan, implementing CRM must be preceded 
</p>
<p>by a sound strategy.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we therefore present CRM 
</p>
<p>as a business strategy and company-level 
</p>
<p>philosophy, such that knowledge about 
</p>
<p>customers and their preferences have impli-
</p>
<p>cations for the entire organization. In this 
</p>
<p>customer-centric business philosophy, the 
</p>
<p>customer is an asset, so the focus shifts away 
</p>
<p>from the product and toward the customer as 
</p>
<p>the source of wealth generation. The goal of 
</p>
<p>strategic CRM is to deepen knowledge about 
</p>
<p>customers actively, then use this knowledge 
</p>
<p>to shape the interactions between a company 
</p>
<p>and its customers and maximize the lifetime 
</p>
<p>value of customers for the company.
</p>
<p>We present key components of a success-
</p>
<p>ful CRM strategy and explain each of them 
</p>
<p>using real-life case studies. We then deal with 
</p>
<p>ways to define and develop a CRM strategy, 
</p>
<p>keeping its key components in mind. We 
</p>
<p>stress the importance of the integration of 
</p>
<p>various functions and an enterprise-wide 
</p>
<p>commitment to the success of CRM initia-
</p>
<p>tives.
</p>
<p>3.1  CRM Perspectives
</p>
<p>In order to understand and develop a CRM 
strategy, it is important to clearly define what 
CRM actually means. This is particularly rele-
vant since the field of CRM remains under 
development and consulting firms, IT vendors 
and companies have created their own defini-
tions and conceptualizations that continue to 
evolve. These different definitions and conceptu-
alizations can be grouped into three perspectives 
of CRM: the functional level, the customer-
facing level, and the company-wide level, as 
illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp; 3.1. We will discuss these 
perspectives next.
 1. Functional level: If viewed from a func-
</p>
<p>tional perspective, CRM refers to the set of 
processes that must be in place to execute 
customer related tasks, such as sales force 
automation or online campaign management. 
This CRM perspective is often combined with 
a strong technology orientation that arises 
when vendors need to position their par-
ticular product. For some vendors or buyers, 
functional CRM is nearly synonymous with 
technology.
</p>
<p> 2. Customer-facing front-end level: In contrast, 
from the customer-facing perspective, CRM 
is a set of activities that provides a single 
view of the customer across all contact chan-
nels. This type of CRM evolves from practi-
tioners&rsquo; need to manage different channels 
consistently in order to focus on the total 
customer experience. The goal is to build a 
single view of the customer across all contact 
channels and to distribute customer intelli-
gence to all customer-facing functions (mar-
keting, sales, service, etc.). This view stresses

</p>
<p>the importance of coordinating information 
across time and across contact channels to 
manage the entire customer relationship sys-
tematically.
</p>
<p> 3. Company-wide level: If CRM is viewed 
from a company-wide level perspective, the 
primary objective is to uncouple the term 
&laquo;CRM&raquo; from any technology underpinnings 
and from specific customer management 
techniques. Instead, this perspective views 
CRM as a strategic orientation to imple-
ment customer centricity within the entire 
organization and create shareholder value. 
Here, knowledge about customers and their 
preferences has implications for all parts of 
the organization including functions that are 
not boundary spanners per se, such as R&amp;D 
or supply chain management.
</p>
<p>When CRM is adopted at the company-wide level, 
it represents strategic CRM.&nbsp;As such, CRM aims 
to gain a long-term competitive advantage by 
optimally delivering value to the customers and 
extracting business value from the relationship 
with the customers. Therefore, this book defines 
CRM from a strategic perspective as follows:
</p>
<p> &raquo; CRM is the strategic process of selecting 
customers that a firm can most profitably 
</p>
<p>serve and shaping interactions between a 
</p>
<p>company and these customers. The ultimate 
</p>
<p>goal is to optimize the current and future 
</p>
<p>value of customers for the company.
</p>
<p>The key components of this definition include:
 5 Strategic process: The CRM activities are ini-
tiated and managed from the very top of the 
organization. Strategic initiatives by definition 
involve multiple, if not all, organizational 
functions. CRM does not belong to any single 
department but rather demands contribution 
and reinforcement from all corporate func-
tions. There is no place for a silo mentality that 
discourages information sharing and con-
dones the idea that one function &laquo;owns the 
customer&raquo;. Furthermore, CRM is a continuing 
process that cannot be handled as just another 
software implementation project. It must be 
viewed as a continuous effort to become an 
ever more customer-centric company.
</p>
<p> 5 Selection: When the economic value of a 
customer is the basis for resource alloca-
tion, firms focus on their most profitable 
</p>
<p>or potentially profitable customers. It is not 
about denying services to certain customers 
but rather about recognizing a fit between the 
firm&rsquo;s offering and a customer&rsquo;s desire, behav-
ior, and characteristics.
</p>
<p> 5 Interactions: The relationship between the 
customer and the firm takes the form of an 
interactive dialog. Information and goods 
are exchanged, and the exchange evolves 
as a function of past exchanges. This is 
very different from a purely transactional 
scenario in which firms sell one-time prod-
ucts and services to customers. Moreover, 
it recognizes the fact that the customer 
journey involves many touchpoints before it 
eventually results in a transaction (Lemon &amp; 
Verhoef, 2016).
</p>
<p> 5 Customers: The term is applied broadly here. 
Depending on the industry and company, a 
customer can be an individual account, one 
or several segments within a market, or an 
entire market. Customers include not only 
end users but also intermediaries, such as dis-
tributors, retailers, and so on. Generally, firms 
are moving away from single, all-purpose 
solutions and starting to satisfy smaller seg-
ments with better targeted products, services, 
and communication propositions. Although 
segmentation is nothing new, modern CRM 
aims at targeting individual customers with 
customized product offerings (&laquo;segment of 
one&raquo;, SAS, 2015).
</p>
<p> 5 Current and future value of the customer: 
Optimizing current and future value means 
that firms move away from extracting profit 
from single transactions and work to maxi-
mize profits over time and a series of trans-
actions. Firms want to maximize customer 
equity&mdash;that is, the value of all customer 
relationships. As discussed in 7 Chap. 2, value 
extracted from customers includes direct con-
tribution from purchases (customer lifetime 
value), but increasingly also indirect contribu-
tion from referrals, influence, and knowledge 
sharing (Kumar et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>In a nutshell, CRM is a management concept 
based on established marketing principles that 
recognizes the need to balance organizational 
and customer interests carefully. CRM is not a 
result primarily of technological solutions but is 
rather a strategic orientation supported by 
</p>

<p>3
</p>
<p>them. These complex sets of activities together 
constitute the basis for a sustainable and diffi-
cult to imitate competitive advantage, the cus-
tomer-centric organization. With strategic 
CRM, a company creates an environment and 
flexible support system that can deal readily 
with issues surrounding product innovation, 
increasing customer expectations, acquisitions, 
globalization, deregulation, the convergence of 
traditional markets, emergence of new technol-
ogies, privacy issues, and new customer contact 
channels.
</p>
<p>3.2  Elements of&nbsp;a&nbsp;CRM Strategy
</p>
<p>After having defined strategic CRM and its 
scope, this section will discuss key elements of a 
CRM strategy. It emphasizes key aspects that a 
CRM strategy should contain in order to serve as 
a meaningful guideline for CRM implementa-
tion initiatives. A good CRM strategy should 
address the following five elements (Becker, 
Greve, &amp; Albers, 2009; Finnegan &amp; Currie, 2010) 
(. Fig.&nbsp;3.2):
 1. CRM vision
 2. Culture of customer orientation
 3. Alignment of organizational processes
 4. Data and technology support
 5. CRM implementation
</p>
<p>3.2.1  CRM Vision
</p>
<p>Any initiative around CRM should be based on a 
clear vision of what the company aims to achieve 
with their customer relationship management 
efforts. Therefore, an essential component of the 
CRM vision should focus on the customer value. 
Based on the discussion above, we suggest that a 
key part of the vision should focus on the topic of 
value. In fact, building on the concept of customer 
value, we can infer that the CRM vision is to build 
an organization in a manner that all actions are 
geared towards maximizing the lifetime value of 
each customer to the firm. This involves acquiring 
and retaining strategically important customers 
and develop, communicate, and deliver value 
propositions that meet or exceed customer expec-
tations. With this vision, an organization can focus 
on developing the key asset of the enterprise that 
matters in the long term, progressively deeper rela-
tionships with valuable customers (Edeling &amp; 
Fischer, 2016; Srivastava, Shervani, &amp; Fahey, 1998).
</p>
<p>3.2.2  Culture of&nbsp;Customer 
Orientation
</p>
<p>Customer orientation is the set of organizational 
values, beliefs, and strategic actions (Kohli &amp; 
Jaworski, 1990; Ruekert, 1992; Deshpand&eacute;, Farley, 
</p>
<p>CRM Implementation

</p>
<p>&amp; Webster, 1993) that enable the implementation 
of customer management principles. It is charac-
terized by a top management belief and commit-
ment where the customer is the center of all 
activity (not the product, geography, etc.). A suc-
cessful CRM strategy starts at the top (see the 
. CRM at Work 3.1). The main reason why many 
CRM efforts have failed is due to the lack of com-
mitment from top management. If top manage-
ment fails to establish a customer oriented culture, 
an appropriate organizational structural and 
reward system, this can result in insignificant or 
even negative CRM outcomes (Chen &amp; Popovich, 
2003). Customer orientation recognizes that cus-
tomers are heterogeneous in their needs and 
value, so the firm is ready to treat different cus-
tomers differently. Finally, it recognizes that no 
single organizational function can be equated 
with CRM; rather, all relevant organizational 
functions have to be aligned with this CRM strat-
egy, which in turn demands a longer-term view of 
customer value.
</p>
<p>The following questions can help assess 
whether the company has established a customer-
oriented strategy:
</p>
<p> 5 Does the top management subscribe to a 
customer-centric philosophy, and does it act 
as a role model?
</p>
<p> 5 Does the entire organization engage in the 
implementation of this philosophy?
</p>
<p> 5 Does the company attempt to establish win&ndash;
win relationships with customers?
</p>
<p> 5 Does the company recognize that customers 
differ in their needs and in their value to the 
firm? How is this reflected in its interaction 
with customers?
</p>
<p>3.2.3  Integration and&nbsp;Alignment 
of&nbsp;Organizational Processes
</p>
<p>In the context of strategic CRM, the integration 
and alignment of organizational processes involve 
the organization-wide creation and synchroniza-
tion of processes, systems, and reward systems that 
enable the implementation of customer manage-
ment principles (Reinartz, Krafft, &amp; Hoyer, 2004).
</p>
<p>The notion that CRM affects only activities and 
processes in sales and customer services often pre-
vails even today. However, a customer&rsquo;s experiences 
while interacting with the company&rsquo;s sales or ser-
vice staff also depends on internal activities, such as 
product development, IT support, and human 
resource management. Most firm departments and 
functions must be involved in a strategic CRM ini-
tiative. The notion that sales, marketing, or IT per-
forms CRM is, quite simply, false. Rather, strategic 
CRM works best for organizations that adopt 
cross-functional processes rather than functional 
silos (see the . CRM at Work 3.2).
</p>
<p>CRM at Work 3.1
 Capital One: CRM Business Model
</p>
<p>To appreciate the key role of the top 
</p>
<p>management in a customer-oriented 
</p>
<p>strategy, consider the example 
</p>
<p>of Capital One, headquartered in 
</p>
<p>McLean, Virginia. One of the fastest 
</p>
<p>growing financial corporations in 
</p>
<p>the United States, Capital One was 
</p>
<p>founded in 1988 and went public in 
</p>
<p>1994. From the moment of its IPO 
</p>
<p>to 2000, its stock price increased by 
</p>
<p>1000%, and the company grew at an 
</p>
<p>average annual rate of 40% (exclud-
</p>
<p>ing mergers and acquisitions). In 
</p>
<p>2001, it handled more than $24.2 bil-
</p>
<p>lion in loans and 36 million custom-
</p>
<p>ers worldwide, all serviced by more 
</p>
<p>than 20,000 employees. How was 
</p>
<p>such phenomenal growth possible?
</p>
<p>The CEO Richard Fairbanks 
</p>
<p>asserts that Capital One&rsquo;s business 
</p>
<p>model is founded on a simple, 
</p>
<p>crucial premise: Every customer 
</p>
<p>carries a specific and unique credit 
</p>
<p>risk and potential revenue profile, 
</p>
<p>and those profiles determine the 
</p>
<p>customer&rsquo;s risk&ndash;return profile, 
</p>
<p>according to the company. The bet-
</p>
<p>ter the company can understand 
</p>
<p>and assess a customer&rsquo;s specific 
</p>
<p>risk, the better it can manage that 
</p>
<p>risk and earn returns. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>as the company gains a better 
</p>
<p>understanding of individual cus-
</p>
<p>tomers, it can tailor its products 
</p>
<p>better to their needs. Low risk and 
</p>
<p>high returns for the company, com-
</p>
<p>bined with high satisfaction for the 
</p>
<p>customer, ideally go hand in hand.
</p>
<p>Capital One has succeeded not 
</p>
<p>only in subscribing to a customer 
</p>
<p>management&ndash;based business 
</p>
<p>model, which recognizes the 
</p>
<p>heterogeneous needs of different 
</p>
<p>customers, but in integrating and 
</p>
<p>aligning its structure and function-
</p>
<p>ing with its strategy. For example, 
</p>
<p>it uses the extensive information 
</p>
<p>it gathers to acquire the type of 
</p>
<p>customers whom Capital One can 
</p>
<p>serve most profitably. Managerial 
</p>
<p>and employee evaluations thus 
</p>
<p>are tied to customer retention and 
</p>
<p>customer profitability measures. 
</p>
<p>Overall, Capital One is a remark-
</p>
<p>able example of a company that 
</p>
<p>has implanted customer manage-
</p>
<p>ment principles into the mindsets 
</p>
<p>of all its members.

</p>

</p>
<p>Why are processes so important? They incor-
porate the needs of the customer and the goals of 
the firm together into product and service deliv-
ery. A process view forces managers to think more 
deeply about the purpose of activities and their 
expected outcomes, not the names of the activities 
or their individual, functionally oriented goals 
(Finnegan &amp; Currie, 2010). Processes must cut 
through the internal barriers that hamper efforts 
to build effective customer relationships.
</p>
<p>The integration and alignment of organizational 
processes also require the recognition that the 
value provided to target customers constitutes the 
driver of all processes (Kumar &amp; Reinartz, 2016). 
Outcomes can be used to define and design an orga-
nization&rsquo;s processes. Individual processes work in 
sync with the goal of attracting and retaining target 
customers. Then incentive-based schemes should 
reflect and reinforce the relationship approach to 
customer management processes and outcomes. 
Stated differently, customer management&ndash;compat-
ible incentives drive employee and organizational 
goals simultaneously. The design of the processes 
should make feedback automatic, which encour-
ages learning from customer management out-
comes to improve functions and refine the process.
</p>
<p>The following questions can help firms to assess 
the extent of integration and alignment of customer 
centricity in its organizational processes:
</p>
<p> 5 Does the company have a clear understanding 
of its customers&rsquo; desired value? Do its pro-
cesses produce this value?
</p>
<p> 5 Are its various processes in the value chain syn-
chronized to maximize value to the customer?
</p>
<p> 5 Are the processes configured such that they 
ensure continuous improvement?
</p>
<p>3.2.4  Data and&nbsp;Technology Support
</p>
<p>Successful CRM also involves collecting and 
analyze complex customer information (see the 
. CRM at Work 3.3). Thus, data and technology 
support plays a central role as an enabler for effec-
tive CRM (Jayachandran et&nbsp;al., 2005). Information 
technology has made processes more efficient, 
transformed both processes and services, and 
supported entirely new processes, especially in 
terms of online activities.
</p>
<p>Yet, the availability of data and technology per 
se is only the first step. In order to support CRM 
activities, companies need specialized capabilities 
to leverage data and turn it into actionable infor-
mation (McKinsey, 2013)&mdash;a process that may 
sound generic but is very hard to execute. Firms 
that generate and act on intelligence create com-
petitive advantages. The recognition that technol-
ogy is built around strategy, processes, and people

 Capital One: Interfunctional 
</p>
<p>Management
</p>
<p>Capital One entered the UK market 
</p>
<p>in 1996 and quickly emerged as 
</p>
<p>a major issuer of credit cards. By 
</p>
<p>aligning its organizational process 
</p>
<p>with its customer-focused strategy, 
</p>
<p>Capital One built the backbone for 
</p>
<p>its CRM success. In particular, Capi-
</p>
<p>tal One demands close coopera-
</p>
<p>tion between its back-office and 
</p>
<p>front-office departments&rsquo; activities, 
</p>
<p>all oriented toward customer 
</p>
<p>service. Back-end activities such 
</p>
<p>as account management, strategy, 
</p>
<p>and product testing&mdash;which the 
</p>
<p>customer never sees&mdash;contribute 
</p>
<p>substantially to the performance 
</p>
<p>of front-end activities and also 
</p>
<p>incorporate front-end agents&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>feedback.
</p>
<p>As an example, consider the 
</p>
<p>cooperation between front-
</p>
<p>end service operations and the 
</p>
<p>marketing and analysis depart-
</p>
<p>ment, which is responsible for new 
</p>
<p>product development. Operations 
</p>
<p>cooperates closely with marketing 
</p>
<p>and analysis in the new product 
</p>
<p>introduction process, such that the 
</p>
<p>latter designs new products, devel-
</p>
<p>ops marketing material, and follows 
</p>
<p>up on customers&rsquo; responses, while 
</p>
<p>the former collects feedback from 
</p>
<p>customers and makes improvement 
</p>
<p>suggestions. Information from 
</p>
<p>operations also improves the net 
</p>
<p>present value models that provide 
</p>
<p>sophisticated decision-making 
</p>
<p>aids. Marketing and analysis then 
</p>
<p>works closely with operations to 
</p>
<p>see how products work&mdash;such as by 
</p>
<p>listening to comments about online 
</p>
<p>applications or identifying which 
</p>
<p>questions in an application appear 
</p>
<p>poorly understood.
</p>
<p>The customer information used 
</p>
<p>to craft strategy mostly comes 
</p>
<p>from the front-end. Through 
</p>
<p>their partnership, operations and 
</p>
<p>marketing and analysis review 
</p>
<p>Capital One&rsquo;s current risk profile 
</p>
<p>and its future strategy. They also 
</p>
<p>collaborate in permanent or ad hoc 
</p>
<p>cross-functional teams, including 
</p>
<p>a credit policy team that consists 
</p>
<p>of members from both operations 
</p>
<p>and marketing analysis defining 
</p>
<p>credit policies for new products.

<p>(and not the other way around), thus, is highly 
important. Data and technology can make cus-
tomer management processes not only more effi-
cient but also more effective, for example by 
creating new processes and channels based on 
online and wireless applications.
</p>
<p>Three questions can help reveal where a com-
pany&rsquo;s position with respect to data and technol-
ogy in support of CRM activities:
</p>
<p> 5 Does your organization harness the enabling 
capabilities of IT systems in terms of customer 
management?
</p>
<p> 5 How timely and relevant is the available cus-
tomer information?
</p>
<p> 5 Are you able to turn data about customers 
into information that can be acted on?
</p>
<p>3.2.5  CRM Implementation
</p>
<p>Strategy means nothing without execution 
(Martin, 2010). Therefore, we assert that imple-
mentation aspects should be part of the CRM strat-
</p>
<p>egy and considered right from the start of any 
CRM initiative. In fact, that strategic perspective of 
CRM (see above) also implies that development, 
refinement and implementation of CRM principles 
and processes within the organization have to con-
sidered as an iterative process. Implementing CRM 
comprises several processes and activities, as cap-
tured in the CRM Implementation Matrix. This 
matrix encompasses the vast scope of potential 
activities and is structured along two key dimen-
sions (Reinartz, Krafft, &amp; Hoyer, 2004):
 1. Customer dimension: Pertains to the chang-
</p>
<p>ing phases of a customer&ndash;firm relationship 
(customer acquisition, growth, retention, exit).
</p>
<p> 2. Management dimension: Activities and 
processes that constitute analytical CRM (i.e., 
to obtain a good understanding of customer 
needs, behaviors, and expectations) and oper-
ational CRM (to roll out and manage interac-
tions with customers across all demands).
</p>
<p>The implementation matrix (. Fig.&nbsp;3.3) maps a set 
of managerial activities and processes onto vari-
ous phases of the customer&ndash;firm relationship. 
Each cell in the matrix corresponds to a specific 
implementation activity or process.
</p>
<p>Marketing-driven CRM implementation thus 
is characterized by:
</p>
<p> 5 Activities and processes that constitute both 
analytical and operational CRM.&nbsp;They might 
include customer data collection, satisfaction 
and loyalty metrics, customer needs analyses, 
relationship economics, or segmentation for 
example.
</p>
<p> 5 Activities and processes that constitute 
operational CRM, such as value proposition 
management, campaign management, chan-
nel management, referral management, and 
loyalty management.
</p>
<p> 5 The firm&rsquo;s ability to understand the value of the 
customer to the firm and varied needs of differ-
ent customers (see the . CRM at Work 3.4).

 Customer Profiling at a&nbsp;German Telephone 
</p>
<p>Company
</p>
<p>A German phone company was confronted with 
</p>
<p>the following question: How do we leverage the 
</p>
<p>enormous amount of data we collect to provide 
</p>
<p>a unique and valuable customer experience? The 
</p>
<p>answer was a combination of predictive behavior 
</p>
<p>analysis and proactive proposal generation. This 
</p>
<p>operator uses call data and demographic data to 
</p>
<p>score each customer on key relationship dimen-
</p>
<p>sions. Profitability and behavior are cataloged to 
</p>
<p>create a unique customer profile. These profiles 
</p>
<p>then become the basis for proactively tailored, 
</p>
<p>one-to-one marketing campaigns, delivered 
</p>
<p>directly to customers&rsquo; handsets. In turn, the opera-
</p>
<p>tor has been able to reduce customer turnover 
</p>
<p>significantly and increase the average profitability 
</p>
<p>of its mobile customers.

 Capital One: Testing New  
</p>
<p>Products
</p>
<p>Capital One employs a unique 
</p>
<p>process to improve its offerings 
</p>
<p>constantly through learning about 
</p>
<p>its customers. In the credit card 
</p>
<p>business, individual customer risk 
</p>
<p>is a key determinant of profits. 
</p>
<p>To adjust its product offerings to 
</p>
<p>customer risk, it uses an approach 
</p>
<p>dubbed poking the bear. Poking 
</p>
<p>a bear makes it move; incen-
</p>
<p>tives make customers react and 
</p>
<p>reveal their characteristics and 
</p>
<p>preferences. Many tests (pokes) 
</p>
<p>administered by the company 
</p>
<p>seek to determine what type of 
</p>
<p>customer behavior will be associ-
</p>
<p>ated with a certain level of credit 
</p>
<p>risk. For example, offering a higher 
</p>
<p>credit line might make customers 
</p>
<p>with a higher default risk respond 
</p>
<p>(because they need the money), 
</p>
<p>which reveals their higher risk. 
</p>
<p>This method therefore provides 
</p>
<p>a way to learn which customer 
</p>
<p>characteristics might predict risk 
</p>
<p>profiles.
</p>
<p>In practical terms, hypotheses 
</p>
<p>about customer characteristics 
</p>
<p>appear in experiments that test 
</p>
<p>which characteristics best correlate 
</p>
<p>with various usage and risk profiles. 
</p>
<p>For example, direct mailings with 
</p>
<p>different texts, designs, and credit 
</p>
<p>conditions go out to a limited 
</p>
<p>group of customers. Their response 
</p>
<p>rates are carefully monitored, as 
</p>
<p>is their behavior during the first 
</p>
<p>months after they receive a card. 
</p>
<p>Capital One can then use this data 
</p>
<p>to determine the value of each 
</p>
<p>direct mail campaign.
</p>
<p>Depending on the test, the 
</p>
<p>results may be available after just a 
</p>
<p>few weeks or take as long as several 
</p>
<p>years. As soon as the test results are 
</p>
<p>clear though, Capital One assesses 
</p>
<p>the viability of new products and 
</p>
<p>rolls out the ones with the best 
</p>
<p>potential for success. Because the 
</p>
<p>product development was based 
</p>
<p>on customer data and feedback, its 
</p>
<p>final products are truly mass cus-
</p>
<p>tomized. Test results integrated into 
</p>
<p>the databases can be used again to 
</p>
<p>initiate idea development and prod-
</p>
<p>uct design processes. This strategy 
</p>
<p>has led to an innovative product 
</p>
<p>portfolio with more than 600 credit 
</p>
<p>card products, all very well aligned 
</p>
<p>with their diverse customers&rsquo; needs.
</p>
<p> 5 An acquisition and retention process that con-
tinuously aligns the offering with customer 
needs and values.
</p>
<p> 5 An ability to improve the company&rsquo;s offer-
ings continually by learning about its cus-
tomers.
</p>
<p>Thus, three questions help assess a company&rsquo;s 
position with respect to its CRM implementa-
tion:
</p>
<p> 5 Do you have systematic testing in place to 
rationalize product development and market-
ing spending?
</p>
<p> 5 Do processes continually align customer 
needs and customer value with the product/
service offering?
</p>
<p> 5 Does your CRM system provide feedback and 
improve on the learning from past interac-
tions?
</p>
<p>The five elements taken together in an integrative 
form constitute the complete CRM strategy. They 
interact and reinforce one another, and each com-
ponent plays an essential role, with none being 
sufficient in and of itself. To compete, a firm 
should at least match its competitors on all com-
ponents and ensure positive interactions among 
them. The effects of these positive interactions 
help CRM champions truly excel.
</p>
<p>3.3  Steps in&nbsp;Developing  
a&nbsp;CRM Strategy
</p>
<p>Developing a CRM strategy consists of four steps 
(. Fig.&nbsp;3.4):
 1. Gain enterprise-wide commitment.
 2. Build a CRM project team.
 3. Analyze business requirements.
 4. Define the CRM strategy.
</p>
<p>3.3.1  Step 1: Gain Enterprise-Wide 
Commitment
</p>
<p>As we have discussed, strategic CRM involves 
multiple areas within a company. Therefore, it is 
important to obtain support from all departments 
involved (e.g., sales, marketing, finance, manufac-
turing, logistics) and apply their valuable input 
when developing the company&rsquo;s CRM strategy. 
The involvement of multiple departments pro-
motes both cooperation and wider acceptance of 
the new system by all segments. Generally, enter-
prise-wide commitment thus includes these attri-
butes:
</p>
<p> 5 Top-down management commitment
 5 Bottom-up buy-in from system users
 5 A dedicated full-time project team
 5 Budget allocation for the total solution
</p>
<p> Chapter 3 &middot; Strategic CRM</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 3
</p>
<p>To get support from all relevant departments, CRM 
strategy developers should keep the departments 
informed of all progress during the development 
and implementation phases and emphasize the 
positive results of the CRM strategy.
</p>
<p>3.3.2  Step 2: Build a&nbsp;CRM 
Project&nbsp;Team
</p>
<p>Once enterprise-wide commitment has been 
secured, the next step should be to select the CRM 
project team, whose members will take responsi-
bility for making key decisions and recommenda-
tions, and communicating the details and benefits 
of the CRM strategy to the entire company. An 
effective CRM project team should contain active 
representatives from at least the following areas:
</p>
<p> 5 Management
 5 IT/technical personnel
 5 Sales, marketing, and service groups
 5 Financial staff
 5 External CRM expert
</p>
<p> Management
</p>
<p>Management should provide leadership, motiva-
tion, and supervision of every step of the CRM 
strategy development, especially if it entails sig-
nificant changes to business processes, organiza-
tional structures, or roles and responsibilities. 
Managers typically evaluate a CRM strategy 
according to basic criteria, such as
</p>
<p> 5 Will the CRM strategy provide information 
required to make key decisions?
</p>
<p> 5 Will the CRM strategy significantly impact 
and improve existing processes?
</p>
<p> 5 Will it significantly reduce costs?
 5 Can the return justify the investment?
</p>
<p> IT/Technical Personnel
</p>
<p>The development of a CRM strategy requires a 
comprehensive analysis of the company&rsquo;s current 
and envisioned information system, so the IT 
department plays an important role. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>the technical group must be actively involved too, 
because it can provide valuable input regarding 
decisions which CRM processes can be auto-
mated. Furthermore, they should ensure the CRM 
system is compatible with existing software appli-
cations.
</p>
<p> Sales, Marketing, and&nbsp;Services 
Groups
</p>
<p>These departments often are the final users of the 
CRM system, after the strategy has been developed 
and implemented. A CRM strategy is successful only 
if the users are satisfied and comfortable with the 
final CRM system. Involving sales, service and mar-
keting representatives in the development of the 
CRM strategy helps to evaluate the potential system&rsquo;s 
usability from a user perspective. Potential solu-
tions&nbsp;can be evaluated based on the following three 
 criteria:
 1. Effectiveness: Users must be able to complete 
</p>
<p>the tasks they wish to perform. An effective 
system is paramount, because it determines 
outcome quality.
</p>
<p> 2 Efficiency: Efficiency measures the required 
input for completing any given task. In view 
of the many users of a final CRM system, 
minor efficiency improvements can have 
significant effects on the firm&rsquo;s overall pro-
ductivity.
</p>
<p> 3. Satisfaction: If the final CRM system is not 
user friendly, users will not make full use 
of the potential benefits, which may put the 
business case for the new CRM system at risk. 
Many CRM initiatives have failed because of 
users&rsquo; resistance to new practices.
</p>
<p> Financial Staff
</p>
<p>A CRM strategy must also be evaluated from the 
financial point of view. Finance department mem-
bers of the CRM project team can provide critical 
analyses of the proposed CRM strategy with 
respect to (1) increased sales productivity, (2) 
operating costs, (3) costs of system expansion, 
and (4) ROI forecasts.

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p> External CRM Expert
</p>
<p>In many cases, external CRM experts (business 
consultants, vendors) can be very helpful for 
developing a CRM strategy, if the company lacks 
sufficient CRM expertise, experience, or technol-
ogy. A consultant&rsquo;s experience can provide a valu-
able source of objective information and feedback. 
In particular, an external observer can help ana-
lyze the company&rsquo;s real business needs, assist with 
the formation of the project team, and work with 
the team to review, amend, and approve func-
tional specifications. Choosing this external 
expert and deciding when and how to integrate 
this source thus may be a critical element of the 
success or failure of the CRM project.
</p>
<p>In addition to these work groups, the CRM 
project team may contain members from other 
internal or external parties (e.g., personnel 
responsible for managing relationships with sup-
pliers, strategic partners, investors), if necessary, 
to ensure the CRM strategy addresses relation-
ships with all important parties.
</p>
<p>3.3.3  Step 3: Analyze Business 
Requirements
</p>
<p>An effective CRM strategy must be based on the 
firm&rsquo;s business requirements. An analysis of busi-
ness requirements, with the objective of gathering 
information on a company-wide basis, assesses 
the current business state and identifies problem 
areas (Rigby &amp; Ledingham, 2004). This process is 
absolutely critical to develop a good CRM strat-
egy. Therefore, this step should feature a series of 
sessions and surveys to canvass top sales, market-
ing, and customer service managers to gather 
their expectations; a consensus should be formed 
as the result. Company-wide goals should be 
defined, along with objectives for each depart-
ment and work group. Special care should be 
taken to acknowledge and evaluate all ideas so 
participants feel they are part of the process. Ideas 
that seem unnecessary or unrealistic may be elim-
inated later during the development of the CRM 
strategy.
</p>
<p>At this juncture, information on specific prob-
lem areas must be gathered uniformly to identify 
particular goals and define objectives for the 
entire company. After gathering information, it 
should be able to take the following ten steps:
</p>
<p> 1. Identify the services and products being sup-
ported.
</p>
<p> 2. Map current workflows, interfaces, and 
interdependencies.
</p>
<p> 3. Review existing technologies, features, and 
capabilities.
</p>
<p> 4. Discuss the vision for the business and the 
operational plan.
</p>
<p> 5. Define business requirements.
 6. Develop enhanced business workflows and 
</p>
<p>processes.
 7. Identify gaps in technology functionality.
 8. Map functionality to business processes.
 9. Develop a new technology and functionality 
</p>
<p>framework.
 10. Develop a conceptual design and prototype 
</p>
<p>plan.
</p>
<p>The following sample CRM survey questions 
are designed to gather crucial information from 
different departments for developing a CRM 
strategy:
</p>
<p> 5 What functions do you perform?
 5 What types of data do you use?
 5 How do you interact with customers?
 5 What data can be made available to help you 
better understand customers?
</p>
<p> 5 How can you improve your communication 
with customers and management?
</p>
<p> 5 How can you reduce administrative and 
scheduling requirements that detract from the 
time available to build relationships?
</p>
<p> 5 How involved are you in outreach activities 
such as telemarketing and direct mail?
</p>
<p> 5 What are your reporting needs and require-
ments?
</p>
<p> 5 How are you involved in lead tracking, lead 
follow-up, data transfer, and other daily 
actions, and how can these processes be 
improved?
</p>
<p>The survey results&mdash;including input from end 
users of the CRM system, such as the sales force, 
customer service representatives, marketing 
personnel, order fulfillment, and account man-
agement staff, or those who deal with customers 
on a daily basis&mdash;must be gathered carefully. 
These informants know what changes are neces-
sary to develop and improve customer relation-
ships. From an analysis of business needs, the 
firm can identify the functions that need to be 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>43 3
</p>
<p>automated, as well as discover the basis for 
determining which technological features are 
required.
</p>
<p>3.3.4  Step 4: Define the&nbsp;CRM 
Strategy
</p>
<p>The business requirements gathered in step 3 rep-
resent the key ingredients for drafting the CRM 
strategy. In this step, it is essential to tailor the 
CRM to the specific requirements of the respec-
tive company. That is, different internal (e.g. capa-
bilities) and external (e.g. client segments or 
competitiveness of the industry) circumstances 
warrant different approaches to CRM and thus 
make each CRM strategy unique and specific to a 
company. Yet, there are some general aspects that 
should be considered when drafting a CRM strat-
egy (. Fig.&nbsp;3.5).
</p>
<p> Value Proposition
</p>
<p>The goal of a CRM strategy is to retain strategi-
cally important customers, and the objective of 
customer retention is to develop, communicate, 
and deliver value propositions that meet or exceed 
customer expectations. The value proposition in 
turn is a multifaceted package of product, service, 
process, price, communication, and interaction 
that customers experience during their relation-
ships with a company. It is the soul of the compa-
ny&rsquo;s business, in that it differentiates the company 
from others. If the value proposition is not affected 
by an investment in CRM, the company is not as 
customer-centric as it needs to be or it lacks a 
</p>
<p>basic understanding of what its customers value. 
The value proposition must address three areas:
</p>
<p> 5 What customers value.
 5 What the company says it offers the customers.
 5 What the company actually offers the customers.
</p>
<p>The company should strive to offer what custom-
ers value; if all three elements of value proposition 
are not aligned, the company likely cannot achieve 
customer centricity, because it is not delivering 
actual value to customers.
</p>
<p> Customer Strategy
</p>
<p>A customer strategy defines how the company 
will build and manage a portfolio of customers. A 
portfolio likely consists of customer segments dif-
ferentiated by the actual or perceived characteris-
tics of those customers. An effective customer 
strategy covers at least these four areas:
 1. Customer understanding: To develop, com-
</p>
<p>municate, and deliver a satisfactory value 
proposition, the company must understand 
its customers&rsquo; expectations. We can dis-
tinguish two types of expectations: Will 
expectations relate the level of performance 
that customers expect to occur. Should expec-
tations relate to the level of performance 
thought ought to happen from a customer&rsquo;s 
point of view (Ho &amp; Zheng, 2004). Customers 
benchmark their expectations against their 
past experience and best-in-class standards. 
To understand customers&rsquo; expectations, a 
company should have effective customer 
segmentation and obtain as much customer 
data as possible regarding their needs (active

cific analytical tools.
</p>
<p> 2. Customer competitive context: The company 
should be aware of how its competitors are 
servicing their customers and how it should 
retain and increase its share of customers in 
the competitive marketplace.
</p>
<p> 3. Customer affiliation: Customer affiliation is 
critical because it is a primary factor affect-
ing a company&rsquo;s ability to retain and extract 
greater value from the customer through 
cross- and up-selling. Comparative assess-
ments of the strength of customer affiliation 
affect strategies for customer retention.
</p>
<p> 4. Customer management competencies: The 
company must have a defined standard process 
about who should and how to manage custom-
ers. To retain its customer management compe-
tency, the company also needs to benchmark its 
management against that of its competitors and 
improve it continuously. The best way to meet 
customers&rsquo; expectations may be to provide 
them with customized instead of generic offers. 
Customized offers should include not only cus-
tomized products but also services, processes, 
distributions, communication, and even prices.
</p>
<p> Business Case
</p>
<p>The business case for CRM determines whether 
the company will meet its specific and measurable 
expectations from its investments. An effective 
business case should directly link the delivery of 
customer value with the creation of shareholder 
value, exhibit a good return on investment (ROI), 
and account for three areas:
 1. The planned increase in the economic value 
</p>
<p>of the customers over the duration of their 
</p>
<p>connection with the company: The lifetime 
value, risk involved in unlocking that value, 
and growth potential by a customer segment 
should be considered.
</p>
<p> 2. Reference and referral effects: The preceding 
calculations alone cannot justify ROI.&nbsp;If the 
company is investing more to satisfy the needs 
of customers, there should be a significant 
impact in the form of increased customer 
acquisition through referral. Thus, a value 
must be placed on new customers who have 
been acquired as a result of the investment.
</p>
<p> 3. The impact of learning and innovation: The 
enhanced learning and innovation resulting 
</p>
<p>from CRM add more value by reducing the 
cost incurred by the company through higher 
marketing effectiveness and improved prod-
ucts and services delivered to customers.
</p>
<p> Enterprise Transformation Plan
</p>
<p>The transformation required by a CRM strategy 
must cover these six areas:
 1. Business process: All primary business pro-
</p>
<p>cesses should be assessed from the perspective 
of the customer strategy to determine whether 
the distinct needs of the customer are met 
and, if not, how to do so.
</p>
<p> 2. Organization: Most customer strategies result 
in organizational changes, which include cul-
tural changes.
</p>
<p> 3. Location and facilities: Particular locations 
that customers visit have profound impacts on 
their perceptions of the company, so the physi-
cal assets of the company must be adjusted to 
match the customer-centric strategy.
</p>
<p> 4. Data flows: A CRM strategy should contain a 
data strategy, covering all aspects from collect-
ing data, transforming data, extracting action-
able information and finally distributing the 
results to different users (staff and customers).
</p>
<p> 5. Application architecture: To implement a 
CRM strategy, the application architecture 
should be changed to feature new application 
software&mdash;or at least to integrate existing soft-
ware in new ways.
</p>
<p> 6. Technology infrastructure: A CRM strategy 
definitely requires a change to the technology 
infrastructure, including new hardware, new 
operating software, and operations personnel.
</p>
<p> Management of&nbsp;Other Stakeholders
</p>
<p>Strategic CRM is a comprehensive practice involv-
ing all facets of an organization. In addition to the 
focal firm and its customers, there is a host of 
stakeholders that need to be taken into consider-
ation when defining a (new) CRM strategy. 
Stakeholders of a company include management, 
customers, employees, and partners as well as own-
ers/investors. Management initiates CRM and takes 
the responsibility to ensure that in the comprehen-
sive CRM strategy, the relationships with all stake-
holders are effectively managed. Because strategic 
CRM is a top-down approach, it succeeds only if 
management is committed to the CRM strategy.
</p>
<p>Apparently, the relative importance of individual 
stakeholders for a strategic CRM approach may dif-
</p>
<p> Chapter 3 &middot; Strategic CRM</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>fer across industries or businesses. For example, in 
industries in which customers derive satisfaction 
mostly by interacting with employees (e.g., hotels), 
employees are essential to achieve a high value prop-
osition to the customer. Yet, customers are of course 
the major focus of a CRM strategy because custom-
ers are the only source of revenue whereas relation-
ships with all other stakeholders generate costs.
</p>
<p>Employees are involved in the execution of the 
CRM strategy. The employees&rsquo; behaviors can have 
positive or negative effects on the customer&rsquo;s value 
perception. Employee satisfaction is an important 
driver of customer satisfaction, especially for busi-
nesses in the service industry. Therefore, a com-
pany&rsquo;s CRM strategy must address employee 
satisfaction to increase customer satisfaction.
</p>
<p>Partnerships such as strategic alliances and 
joint ventures enable their participants to share 
technological know-how and customer data, 
develop new products more rapidly, and share 
costs as well as risks. As a result, these participants 
enjoy lower costs, better customer insights, and 
eventually a broader customer base, all of which 
enables them to provide additional value to their 
customers. As part of its CRM strategy, a company 
must have such a partnership strategy to identify 
the strategic area in which partnerships are neces-
</p>
<p>sary, determine the ideal partner profile, search for 
appropriate partners, enter a strategic alliance 
agreement, and manage its ongoing partnerships.
</p>
<p>Competitors also play a major role, because any 
firm is always compared with the other players in 
the market. The key is to provide better value than 
competitors, as well as use them to benchmark the 
firm&rsquo;s own strategy and definition of success. 
Similarly, external factors always play a critical role 
in devising any strategy, though firms have little to 
no control over them. Yet before developing its 
CRM strategy, the firm should perform its 
own&nbsp; SWOT (strength-weaknesses-opportunities-
threats) analysis, so it is ready to exploit the oppor-
tunities and face the threats by relying on its own 
strengths or avoiding its weaknesses.
</p>
<p>Finally, a successful CRM strategy also needs 
to create value for the company&rsquo;s owners/investors. 
From this perspective, creating more value for cus-
tomers and the company goes hand-in-hand with 
ensuring owners&rsquo; benefits. However, conflicts also 
occur: A CRM strategy focused on delivering higher 
value to owners in the long term sometimes requires 
sacrificing short-term benefits, which cannot satisfy 
owners who seek short- term ROI.&nbsp;Value investors 
focusing on long-term returns, thus, are more likely 
to become advocates of a profound CRM strategy.

CRM in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Fast-Moving-Con-
</p>
<p>sumer-Goods Industry
</p>
<p>Henkel is a globally operating 
</p>
<p>group of companies, offering a 
</p>
<p>wide range of consumer goods 
</p>
<p>extending from detergents, 
</p>
<p>household cleaners, cosmetics, 
</p>
<p>toiletries and adhesives. In Europe, 
</p>
<p>Henkel has held a leading position 
</p>
<p>for decades in the detergents and 
</p>
<p>household cleaners market with 
</p>
<p>brands such as Persil, Dixan, Vernel 
</p>
<p>and Wei&szlig;er Riese. In the US it is 
</p>
<p>represented with the Dial brand. 
</p>
<p>In the hypercompetitive European 
</p>
<p>retail markets, many of the large 
</p>
<p>manufacturers such as Henkel, 
</p>
<p>P&amp;G, and Unilever have focused on 
</p>
<p>improving and managing supply 
</p>
<p>chain efficiency.
</p>
<p>Part of this ongoing activity is 
</p>
<p>the concept of category manage-
</p>
<p>ment, where manufacturers and 
</p>
<p>retailers collaborate to improve the 
</p>
<p>profitability of the category at the 
</p>
<p>store level. However, as an increas-
</p>
<p>ing number of firms are mastering 
</p>
<p>the category management process, 
</p>
<p>manufacturers like Henkel are 
</p>
<p>looking how they can differentiate 
</p>
<p>themselves further. This is where 
</p>
<p>many of them have started to 
</p>
<p>experiment with customer rela-
</p>
<p>tionship management practices. 
</p>
<p>The environment in which these 
</p>
<p>companies operate is characterized 
</p>
<p>by branded products, low absolute 
</p>
<p>margins on a per product basis, and 
</p>
<p>lack of direct consumer contact. In 
</p>
<p>line with the general CRM idea, the 
</p>
<p>goal of a CRM approach would be 
</p>
<p>to identify and target high value 
</p>
<p>customers and to then to devise 
</p>
<p>a retention or growth strategy for 
</p>
<p>them. In practice, this means to 
</p>
<p>allocate disproportionate resources 
</p>
<p>to these customers. Whereas CRM 
</p>
<p>is strongly established in direct to 
</p>
<p>consumer environments such as 
</p>
<p>banking or telecommunications, the 
</p>
<p>exact nature of CRM in the FMCG 
</p>
<p>environment is less clear. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>the challenge that lies in front 
</p>
<p>of firms like Henkel is to define, 
</p>
<p>conceptualize, and implement a 
</p>
<p>suitable CRM approach.

CRM in&nbsp;B-to-B at Deutsche Post 
</p>
<p>World Net
</p>
<p>Deutsche Post World Net (DPWN) is 
</p>
<p>a fast growing international logis-
</p>
<p>tics service provider. Its portfolio of 
</p>
<p>companies includes its European 
</p>
<p>B to B parcel service EuroExpress, 
</p>
<p>its express delivery service across 
</p>
<p>the globe DHL, and its global 
</p>
<p>logistics provider (air, sea, and road 
</p>
<p>transportation) DANZAS.&nbsp;Revenues 
</p>
<p>for the three divisions in 2001 were 
</p>
<p>approximately &euro;15.5bn with an 
</p>
<p>increasing portion (45%) coming 
</p>
<p>from outside its home market 
</p>
<p>Germany. The central problem of 
</p>
<p>DPWN was that the three compa-
</p>
<p>nies served in many cases the same 
</p>
<p>customers without knowing this. 
</p>
<p>Each company has its own sales 
</p>
<p>force and was calling simultane-
</p>
<p>ously on many identical clients, for 
</p>
<p>example virtually all of the large 
</p>
<p>companies in Europe. As one would 
</p>
<p>expect, the organizational struc-
</p>
<p>tures and systems support (IT) was 
</p>
<p>quite different for the three com-
</p>
<p>panies. DPWN felt that the group of 
</p>
<p>individual companies could achieve 
</p>
<p>much better results by coordinat-
</p>
<p>ing their sales efforts, specifically, 
</p>
<p>be being able to systematically 
</p>
<p>cross-sell its various products 
</p>
<p>and services to the many existing 
</p>
<p>clients. Therefore, the company set 
</p>
<p>out to leverage the entire customer 
</p>
<p>base across the three companies 
</p>
<p>and to build an integrated customer 
</p>
<p>management approach. Specifi-
</p>
<p>cally, DPWN wanted to first create 
</p>
<p>a key account management system 
</p>
<p>that allows the three companies to 
</p>
<p>coordinate their offerings and sales 
</p>
<p>communication to the most impor-
</p>
<p>tant business clients. Given that the 
</p>
<p>three individual companies offered 
</p>
<p>complementary services, the objec-
</p>
<p>tive was to present &laquo;one-face to the 
</p>
<p>customer&raquo; with the idea to provide 
</p>
<p>complete logistics solutions for 
</p>
<p>these clients regardless of the type 
</p>
<p>of desired service. The challenges 
</p>
<p>that would lie ahead of DPWN 
</p>
<p>were to (a) create transparency 
</p>
<p>across customer relationships and 
</p>
<p>customer potentials, (b) to design 
</p>
<p>cooperation processes across the 
</p>
<p>three companies, and to (c) develop 
</p>
<p>sales support tools.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we have looked at CRM from 
</p>
<p>a strategic perspective. When CRM is viewed 
</p>
<p>as a company-level philosophy, such that 
</p>
<p>knowledge about customers has implications 
</p>
<p>for the entire organization, it is referred to as 
</p>
<p>strategic CRM. The goal of strategic CRM is to 
</p>
<p>shape interactions between the firm and its 
</p>
<p>customers in a manner that maximizes the 
</p>
<p>lifetime value of each customer to the firm. 
</p>
<p>The five main elements of a CRM strategy are:
</p>
<p>1. A CRM vision, which is the underlying 
</p>
<p>rationale of why CRM initiatives are carried 
</p>
<p>out by a company. Ideally, it should be 
</p>
<p>based on the concept of delivering value 
</p>
<p>to customers and extracting value from 
</p>
<p>customers to the company.
</p>
<p>2. A culture of customer orientation, 
</p>
<p>which is the set of organizational val-
</p>
<p>ues, beliefs, and strategic actions that 
</p>
<p>enable the implementation of customer 
</p>
<p>management principles, driven by a top- 
</p>
<p>management belief that the customer is 
</p>
<p>at the center of activity.
</p>
<p>3. An integration and alignment of organiza-
</p>
<p>tional processes, which consist of the cre-
</p>
<p>ation and synchronization of processes and 
</p>
<p>systems to enable the organization to imple-
</p>
<p>ment customer management principles.
</p>
<p>4. The use of data and technology support, 
</p>
<p>because an understanding of the value 
</p>
<p>provided to target customers drives 
</p>
<p>processes. The processes also work in line 
</p>
<p>with the goal of attracting and retaining 
</p>
<p>target customers.
</p>
<p>5. CRM strategy implementation. The pro-
</p>
<p>cesses and activities required for a success-
</p>
<p>ful CRM strategy are structured around two 
</p>
<p>key dimensions in a CRM implementation 
</p>
<p>matrix. The customer dimension captures 
</p>
<p>the influence of the changing phase of a 
</p>
<p>customer&ndash;firm relationship, and the man-
</p>
<p>agement dimension comprises analytical 
</p>
<p>and operational CRM.
</p>
<p>In turn, developing a CRM strategy 
</p>
<p>consists of (1) gaining enterprise-wide com-
</p>
<p>mitment (2), building a CRM project team,

<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. Many private banks serving high net 
</p>
<p>worth clients are radically transforming 
</p>
<p>the way they manage customer relation-
</p>
<p>ships. At the Swiss private bank Julius Baer 
</p>
<p>for example, in the past the relationship 
</p>
<p>manager was the sole contact for the 
</p>
<p>client. Today, the relationship manager 
</p>
<p>is rather a guide to the bank&rsquo;s service 
</p>
<p>offering including bespoke investment 
</p>
<p>advisory services combined with auto-
</p>
<p>mated monitoring and recommenda-
</p>
<p>tion systems. Thus, the bank has built a 
</p>
<p>customer-centric organization that offers 
</p>
<p>modular services depending on the cli-
</p>
<p>ent&rsquo;s requirements (Collardi, 2012).
</p>
<p> 2. The global sports apparel company 
</p>
<p>Adidas has recently announced that it 
</p>
<p>is about to launch the first 3-D printed 
</p>
<p>sneaker. That essentially means, in the 
</p>
<p>future each sneaker can be fully indi-
</p>
<p>vidualized and produced in batch size 
</p>
<p>one. The move towards a &laquo;segment of 
</p>
<p>one&raquo; was made possible by significant 
</p>
<p>advances in 3-D printing technology 
</p>
<p>(Bourzac, 2017).

 1. Are traditional marketing principles 
</p>
<p>valid in the age of CRM? What are the 
</p>
<p>fundamental differences between trans-
</p>
<p>action-based marketing approaches and 
</p>
<p>relationship-based marketing approaches?
</p>
<p> 2. What structural changes must an organi-
</p>
<p>zation undertake to switch from a prod-
</p>
<p>uct to a customer orientation? Should

<p>companies start investing in such struc-
</p>
<p>tural changes?

</p>
<p>value proposition, business case, customer 
</p>
<p>strategy, enterprise transformation plans, and 
</p>
<p>other stakeholders.
</p>
<p>The value proposition of each firm is a mul-
</p>
<p>tifaceted package that customers experience, 
</p>
<p>including the product, service, process, price, 
</p>
<p>communication, and interaction. A customer 
</p>
<p>strategy helps build and maintain a portfolio of 
</p>
<p>customers through an understanding of their 
</p>
<p>expectations, competitor contexts, and cus-
</p>
<p>tomer affiliations. The business case determines 
</p>
<p>whether an investment in CRM meets expecta-
</p>
<p>tions by linking the delivery of customer value 
</p>
<p>to the creation of shareholder value, or ROI.&nbsp;It 
</p>
<p>should take into account not only the eco-
</p>
<p>nomic value of a customer but also the poten-
</p>
<p>tial for increased customer acquisition through 
</p>
<p>referrals and the impact of learning and innova-
</p>
<p>tion. The CRM strategy also demands transfor-
</p>
<p>mations in business processes, organizations, 
</p>
<p>locations and facilities, data flows, application 
</p>
<p>architecture, and technology infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>Finally, for the development of a CRM strategy 
</p>
<p>various stakeholders of the focal organization 
</p>
<p>should be taken into consideration: Customers, 
</p>
<p>management, competitors, employees, sup-
</p>
<p>pliers, and investors. In the next chapter, we 
</p>
<p>will discuss how to carry out investment and 
</p>
<p>operational decisions to implement these vari-
</p>
<p>ous elements of a firm&rsquo;s CRM strategy.

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>In the previous chapter we have discussed 
</p>
<p>various aspects of a CRM strategy. The fol-
</p>
<p>lowing chapter focuses on implementation 
</p>
<p>aspects of CRM.&nbsp;Most importantly, it stresses 
</p>
<p>that implementing the CRM strategy should 
</p>
<p>be thought of as an iterative process includ-
</p>
<p>ing continuous refinements. As such, manag-
</p>
<p>ers should think of CRM implementation as a 
</p>
<p>series of small CRM projects. We discuss three 
</p>
<p>different types of projects (operational, ana-
</p>
<p>lytical and application projects) and how they 
</p>
<p>are linked to each other. A particular focus 
</p>
<p>will be on data handling as a key prerequisite 
</p>
<p>of successful CRM implementation.
</p>
<p>Subsequently, we discuss CRM imple-
</p>
<p>mentation effectiveness and introduce the 
</p>
<p>concept of ROI for CRM initiatives. In this 
</p>
<p>section, we discuss key underlying driver of 
</p>
<p>both costs and benefits of CRM initiatives as 
</p>
<p>well as a three-stage process for ROI estima-
</p>
<p>tion and target setting. As anecdotes of failed 
</p>
<p>CRM projects are plenty, we also include a 
</p>
<p>section discussing why CRM implementa-
</p>
<p>tion projects fail. We provide six reasons 
</p>
<p>frequently mentioned both in practice and 
</p>
<p>the academic literature and discuss three of 
</p>
<p>them in further detail, including potential 
</p>
<p>remedies.
</p>
<p>The chapter closes with a case study on 
</p>
<p>the financial service company Capital One 
</p>
<p>which highlights many aspects from both 
</p>
<p>CRM strategy (7 Chap. 3) and CRM imple-
mentation (7 Chap. 4) in one real world 
example.
</p>
<p>4.1  Types of&nbsp;CRM Implementation 
Projects
</p>
<p>The implementation of the CRM strategy is a pro-
cess of planning and executing a series of small 
CRM projects. These projects are all aimed at 
addressing the elements of the CRM strategy (as 
discussed in 7 Chap. 3), and they normally fall 
into three categories:
 1. Operational CRM projects: Enable the com-
</p>
<p>pany to meet the technical and functional 
requirements of the CRM strategy.
</p>
<p> 2. Analytical CRM projects: Have the objective 
to obtain a good understanding of the cus-
tomer&rsquo;s needs, expectations, and behaviors.
</p>
<p> 3. Application projects: Focus on deploying the 
operational and analytical outputs to improve 
marketing decisions and customer relation-
ships.
</p>
<p>Next, we will discuss each of these project types in 
detail in order to understand their role in CRM 
implementation.
</p>
<p>4.1.1  Operational CRM Projects
</p>
<p>The objective of these projects is to build an 
infrastructure that meets the technical and func-
tional requirements of CRM.&nbsp;Examples of these 
projects include automation of functions such as 
a call center or an order-processing system, 
developing an online transaction Website, 
changing the process of data collection and data 
management, selecting and installing appropri-
ate hardware and software, upgrading or recon-
figuring the IT infrastructure, setting up a 
customer database and or a data warehouse. It 
should be noted that these kind of projects do 
not create value directly (in form of additional 
revenues or reduced costs), but&nbsp;&ndash; if successfully 
developed and completed&nbsp;&ndash; they build the basis 
to perform further value-adding CRM projects. 
From a technical perspective, a typical CRM 
infrastructure should have the components listed 
in . Table&nbsp;4.1.
</p>
<p>4.1.2  Analytical CRM Projects
</p>
<p>Analytical CRM projects are implemented to help 
the company understand its customers by using 
data analysis tools that mine the company&rsquo;s data-
bases. This area of CRM is also called data analyt-
ics (for further details, please also refer to Part III 
Analytical CRM). Data analytics can be under-
stood as the process of leveraging data and tech-
nology to increase the company&rsquo;s understanding 
of its customers, products, and environment and 
to improve strategic decision making and tactical 
market activity (Kelly, 2000). Analytical projects 
benefit from investments during previous opera-
tional projects by leveraging the infrastructure

<p/>

</p>
<p>that the latter has created, and add value by 
enabling the firm to understand its customers. 
These projects create the ability for a firm to 
establish and manage profitable relationships 
with its customers. Moreover, the results of these 
analyses provide critical information to continu-
ously refine the CRM strategy. Analytical CRM 
projects include three major types of activities: 
Capturing customer information, customer data 
transformation and customer knowledge discov-
ery (Barton &amp; Court, 2012).
</p>
<p> Capturing All Relevant Customer 
Information
</p>
<p>An effective customer data analysis should rely 
on a customer database that is as comprehensive 
as possible. Building such customer database 
requires capturing all relevant customer infor-
mation, and this can be a significant challenge to 
many companies.
</p>
<p>There are a few steps that should be taken to 
construct a complete database. First, all customer 
information from any varying formats or data 
sources need to be standardized from both the 
business and technical point of view. This is 
extremely important for analytical purposes.
</p>
<p>Second, over time, customers can interact 
with the company in a number of new ways, and 
</p>
<p>this will generate a new range of data sources. 
Therefore, the analytical solution should also be 
able to flexibly and consistently integrate all data 
across all channels and all customer-company 
touch points (see . CRM at Work 4.1). This will 
ensure that no important information is missing 
and ideally, the customer information is updated 
in real time.
</p>
<p>Third, external sources of information should 
also be incorporated to keep the company aware 
of the competitive situation. External sources can 
include:
</p>
<p> 5 Competitors&rsquo; data dealing with the company&rsquo;s 
customers.
</p>
<p> 5 Published survey results to supplement the 
customer information with details about 
customer satisfaction and customer prefer-
ences.
</p>
<p> 5 Data from communities or clubs with a 
common interest.
</p>
<p>Finally, customer-related back office data related 
to billing and shipment should be evaluated from 
a financial perspective and should be consolidated 
into a coherent picture of financial success and 
customer profitability. Successful data intelligence 
solutions integrate customer data and ensure that 
useful analytical results are delivered.

</p>
<p> Customer Data Transformation
</p>
<p>This type of data analytics activity involves 
extracting and transforming raw data from a 
wide source of internal and external databases, 
marts, or warehouses, and then pooling the total 
data value and information in one place where it 
can be accessed and explored. First, in order to 
perform customer data transformation, the com-
pany needs to build a data warehouse. Data ware-
housing involves consolidating all relevant 
customer data within a comprehensive database 
and making it accessible to the users in the orga-
nization who need it. Many firms have made 
progress on that end. However, there are still leg-
acy systems that prevent that accessing and ana-
lyzing the data often is not as easy, fast, or 
accessible as it should be. Unless the data is avail-
able in a useful format, in a timely fashion, and 
enable the analysis that marketers rely on, the 
data are of no value at all.
</p>
<p>Second, a firm must enhance the data about 
a customer by integrating information from 
various internal sources. If the integrated cus-
tomer data is incomplete, the company should 
enhance the data with externally available infor-
mation. For example, geographic, lifestyle, and 
psychographic data can help in developing a 
complete image of a customer. All this informa-
tion can be pulled together to a single source, 
and a historical perspective can be developed 
over time.
</p>
<p> Customer Knowledge Discovery
</p>
<p>This type of data analytics project provides mar-
keters with the tools and processes to discover 
customer data, convert information into usable 
customer knowledge, and deploy it to enhance 
marketing decision making. This usually involves 
a three-step process:
 1. Analyzing the data: Using statistical tools to 
</p>
<p>better understand customers.
 2. Predicting the future: Based on analytical 
</p>
<p>results obtained from existing data.
 3. Assessing customer value.
</p>
<p>Analyzing the&nbsp;Data
</p>
<p>Analyzing the data often starts with an analysis of 
the customer base which provides a clear under-
standing of the company&rsquo;s existing customers and 
their characteristics. This includes demographic 
aspects (their name, gender, address, age, educa-
tion, number of people in the household, etc.), 
psychographic information (e.g. survey results on 
customer satisfaction, loyalty, attitudes) and 
finally information on actual behavior (e.g. trans-
action data, complaints, service incidents, app 
usage, etc.). On this basis, the company should be 
able to define customer segments and use them as 
the basis for making decisions in marketing, sales, 
and customer services to different customer seg-
ments. For example, by analyzing customers&rsquo; 
transaction history, the company can gain insights 
into the customers&rsquo; recency, frequency, and

La Croissanterie, Paris, France: 
</p>
<p>Enhancing Customer Interface 
</p>
<p>Using Technology
</p>
<p>La Croissanterie, a Paris based fast-
</p>
<p>food chain was facing a problem 
</p>
<p>because many of its customers 
</p>
<p>had too many loyalty cards and 
</p>
<p>were forgetting or losing their 
</p>
<p>cards all together. Additionally, the 
</p>
<p>company had an outdated system 
</p>
<p>that collected only the basic 
</p>
<p>information about the customers 
</p>
<p>and rewarded only customers who 
</p>
<p>purchased full meals. For instance, 
</p>
<p>customers ordering only coffee 
</p>
<p>were not rewarded thereby reduc-
</p>
<p>ing the incentive for customers to 
</p>
<p>use the loyalty card.
</p>
<p>To resolve this, La Croissanterie 
</p>
<p>updated its loyalty program with 
</p>
<p>the introduction of Loyalty Pass in 
</p>
<p>June 2010. The new system allowed 
</p>
<p>customers to record purchases 
</p>
<p>through any of the following three 
</p>
<p>channels&nbsp;&ndash; a loyalty card, a mobile 
</p>
<p>phone or a transit pass. Addition-
</p>
<p>ally, the company also used these 
</p>
<p>three channels to track and offer 
</p>
<p>product promotions. This advance-
</p>
<p>ment in customer data collection 
</p>
<p>and usage was made possible using 
</p>
<p>the Near Field Communication 
</p>
<p>(NFC) technology.
</p>
<p>The NFC technology is an 
</p>
<p>extension of Radio Frequency 
</p>
<p>Identification (RFID) and smartcard 
</p>
<p>technology geared towards mobile 
</p>
<p>phones. It is a wireless technology 
</p>
<p>that allows the customers to store 
</p>
<p>their unique IDs on the phone. 
</p>
<p>When the customer arrives at the 
</p>
<p>store, he/she simply taps a smart 
</p>
<p>poster imbedded with another 
</p>
<p>NFC device to transmit their infor-
</p>
<p>mation. This device will instantly 
</p>
<p>present him/her with promotions 
</p>
<p>based on their specific profile. At 
</p>
<p>the checkout, the customer taps 
</p>
<p>again and his/her transaction is 
</p>
<p>recorded for the loyalty rewards.
</p>
<p>Additionally, La Croissanterie was 
</p>
<p>able to immediately catalog all 
</p>
<p>individual customer transactions 
</p>
<p>across all locations, frequency 
</p>
<p>and purchase type. This advance-
</p>
<p>ment in technology allows for 
</p>
<p>a consistent interface with the 
</p>
<p>customer and presents the 
</p>
<p>company with more detailed view 
</p>
<p>of the customer from all available 
</p>
<p>touch points.

</p>
<p> monetary value of their purchases. Analyzing 
customer service records can also indicate cus-
tomers&rsquo; attitudes and their feedbacks.
</p>
<p>Predicting the&nbsp;Future
</p>
<p>Based on this information, the company should 
be able to model a behavior pattern for specific cus-
tomers and predict whether they will buy again, 
what they will probably buy, when they will buy, 
how much they will spend, and what additional 
services they may need.
</p>
<p>Assessing Customer Value
</p>
<p>After establishing the methods to model cus-
tomer behavior and analyze customer demo-
graphic information, it is essential to assess 
customer value. This helps the company allocate 
its limited resources in the most efficient manner 
and focus on the best and most valuable customer 
relationships.
</p>
<p>4.1.3  Application Projects 
Deploying Operational 
and&nbsp;Analytical Outputs
</p>
<p>Although an operational CRM project can put the 
CRM architecture into place, and an analytical 
CRM project can extract helpful information on 
customers&rsquo; needs and expectations, no value will 
be created until this system and the information are 
applied and utilized to improve the company&rsquo;s mar-
keting decision making and the company&rsquo;s relation-
ships with its customers (Barton &amp; Court, 2012).
</p>
<p>In general, the goal of these projects is to increase 
revenue and profit by improving relationships with 
customers. For example, automation of a call center 
will service customers more promptly and effec-
tively, and on-line transaction processes will enable 
customers to transact through self-service. Using 
</p>
<p>the analytical results of customer value assessment 
and customer profiling helps design marketing 
campaigns that target the customers or prospects 
that are most likely to respond and that provide a 
high expected value. Also, customer calls can be 
directed to the appropriate contact person in a call 
center depending on customer rating and customer 
value to ensure that the most valuable customers 
receive the best service possible. Products or service 
can be customized, or even personalized, based on 
customer behavior modeling and customer seg-
mentation to meet their unique expectations. The 
planning and forecasting of sales, marketing, and 
customer service can be improved based on cus-
tomer life-cycle patterns (engage, transaction, ful-
fill, and service) to make the sales and marketing 
efforts more focused and efficient. All these mea-
sures will help the company acquire and retain the 
most attractive customers and improve the profit-
ability of the existing customer base. Finally, insights 
from the analysis can be used to dissolve relation-
ships with low value customers. . CRM at Work 4.2 
provides an example of pragmatic yet highly effec-
tive actions based on customer insights.
</p>
<p>4.2  CRM Implementation 
Effectiveness
</p>
<p>Once a firm decides on the elements required for 
implementing a CRM system, it must ask one 
important question: Is the investment in CRM 
elements worth it? The practice of developing and 
implementing a CRM system should always mea-
sure the expected monetary benefits to assess 
whether the investment is likely to payoff. In times 
when marketing has to demonstrate its value to 
the company (Homburg, Vomberg, Enke, &amp; 
Grimm, 2015; Srinivasan &amp; Hanssens, 2009), 
critically assessing the ROI of CRM initiatives is

 Giant Eagle: Fuel for&nbsp;Thought
</p>
<p>The flexibility to adapt to the needs 
</p>
<p>of the consumer is critical when 
</p>
<p>implementing a CRM system. Gro-
</p>
<p>cery and convenience store chain 
</p>
<p>Giant Eagle realized the impor-
</p>
<p>tance of a customer relationship 
</p>
<p>management program, especially 
</p>
<p>during the recent economic slump. 
</p>
<p>Discounts and promotions acquired 
</p>
<p>by using a loyalty card is not a new 
</p>
<p>concept. However, Giant Eagle 
</p>
<p>added a creative idea to increase 
</p>
<p>use of its customer loyalty program 
</p>
<p>during the most recent economic 
</p>
<p>slump&nbsp;&ndash; Fuel discounts.
</p>
<p>The program was launched in all 
</p>
<p>the 221 corporate and independently 
</p>
<p>owned full locations as well as 150 
</p>
<p>GetGo outlets, which are conve-
</p>
<p>nience/fueling locations. Since the 
</p>
<p>program&rsquo;s inception, Giant Eagle has 
</p>
<p>successfully managed to cross-over 
</p>
<p>fuel discounts with a food discount 
</p>
<p>loyalty card, allowing for increased 
</p>
<p>cross buy between food and fuel pur-
</p>
<p>chases. This new initiative has led to 
</p>
<p>significant gains in sales for the chain.

<p>imperative. The estimation of ROI of CRM 
determines many critical decisions, such as 
whether a CRM strategy is needed, what CRM 
strategy should be developed, and how it should 
be implemented. The formula for ROI is given as:
</p>
<p>Profits Investment ROI %/ %&times;100 = ( )
</p>
<p>While the formula is simple, a deeper understand-
ing of the elements of CRM investments is war-
ranted to accurately ascertain the ROI of CRM 
activities. Due to the cross-functional nature of 
strategic CRM, both benefits and costs accrue in 
different areas of the organization. . Table&nbsp; 4.2 
provides a list of areas and key issues to be consid-
ered in deciding the nature of the costs.

<p>From . Table&nbsp; 4.2, it can be determined that the 
elements of CRM investments can be divided into 
five major categories: organizational require-
ments, technology needs, database needs, human 
resource potential, and implementation factors. 
This section will explore each of these categories.
</p>
<p> Organizational Requirements
</p>
<p>The overall requirements of the organization 
interested in deploying the CRM initiative play 
</p>
<p>a significant role in determining the final cost of 
CRM implementation. Managers and functional 
experts within the various departments of the 
organizations will contribute the business and 
department-specific requirements that will go into 
the overall framework of the CRM program to be 
implemented. In effect, the organizational require-
ments will depend on the nature of the CRM 
project, such as campaign management, chan-
nel management, customer support, and product 
development, among others (Bohling et&nbsp;al., 2006). 
The organizational requirements will also be sup-
plemented by business infrastructure needed to 
achieve the goal. The breadth and depth of these 
requirements ultimately determine the final cost of 
the CRM initiative. The more complex the require-
ments, the higher the cost of CRM implementation.
</p>
<p> Technology Needs
</p>
<p>Technology requirements typically include soft-
ware and hardware components, database devel-
opment and IT infrastructure. Each of the types of 
IT contributes to the overall cost of CRM imple-
mentation. Typically, software can be purchased 
or licensed. For a typical CRM project, IT costs 
usually account for one-fifth to one-third of the 
total cost. This is likely to remain an accurate pre-
diction for future years too, because the savings 
associated with the falling costs of hardware and 
software are offset by the rising cost of hiring IT 
professionals.

</p>
<p>An important element when dealing with 
CRM technology is identifying and examining the 
role of relational information processes and 
understanding how they aid in effective customer 
relationship management. The relational informa-
tion processes are defined as encompassing the 
specific routines that a firm uses to manage cus-
tomer information to establish long-term relation-
ships with customers. These information processes 
help in the capture and use of customer informa-
tion so that a firm&rsquo;s effort to build relationships is 
not rendered ineffective by poor communication, 
information loss and overload, and inappropriate 
information use. Research has shown that by 
moderating the influence of relational informa-
tion processes on customer relationship perfor-
mance, technology used for CRM performs an 
important and supportive role (Jayachandran, 
Sharma, Kaufman, &amp; Raman, 2005). If firms adopt 
these insights into their implementation, they are 
bound to witness significant impact on the cost 
incurred on technology.
</p>
<p> Database Needs
</p>
<p>Based on the nature of the CRM project and the 
customer segment(s) that will be served, the data-
base costs will vary. The customer database is at 
the heart of an IT-enabled CRM system. 
Customers often have multiple channels to com-
municate with a firm and can interact with 
numerous departments, such as sales, customer 
service, and marketing. The information from 
these interactions serves as the basis for future 
interactions in the context of CRM (Peppers &amp; 
Rogers, 1997). Further, creating a single database 
by combining internal data from several channels 
and divisions, with relevant external data, is a 
huge challenge faced by many companies, partic-
ularly for those that have grown through mergers 
and acquisitions. If the organization already 
maintains a robust database containing all rele-
vant information, the database needs will add 
very little to the overall costs. However, if the 
organization has to create a database or add a sig-
nificant amount of information to their existing 
database, this requirement could become a sig-
nificant addition to the overall costs.
</p>
<p> Human Resource Potential
</p>
<p>The human resource potential in an organiza-
tion is a critical component in the development 
and implementation of a CRM project, and per-
</p>
<p>haps even the most challenging to manage. 
Getting the right people to helm CRM projects 
makes the difference in an implementation. For 
instance, Continental Airlines went from worst 
to first in customer satisfaction. This transfor-
mation clearly stresses the importance of firms 
having people issues under control before 
investing in expensive CRM technologies 
(Reitz, 2005). The human resource costs include 
the hiring of IT professional as well as the costs 
of training current employees. Operations 
researchers and statisticians may be required 
for developing and implementing a CRM sys-
tem. The analytical side of CRM may require 
expertise in segmentation analysis, migration 
modeling, lifetime value estimations, customer 
acquisition planning, and customer churn anal-
ysis. Recruitment of CRM talent in direct mar-
keting, campaign, management, and many 
other areas may also be required. Training costs 
also fall into this category. Current and future 
employees will need to be trained on how to 
properly use the CRM system including often 
tedious measures to ensure all relevant infor-
mation is fed into the CRM system (e.g. by the 
field sales force).
</p>
<p> Implementation Factors
</p>
<p>Often when a new or different CRM strategy is 
employed, significant changes need to be made to 
a firm&rsquo;s current mode of operation. One of the key 
CRM implementation challenges is defining and 
communicating the need and use for the pro-
posed changes to all members of the manage-
ment. In other words, change management plays a 
crucial role in deciding the success (and cost) of 
CRM implementation (Kumar, Ramani, &amp; 
Bohling, 2004). One way to counter this challenge 
is to implement the entire project as a series of 
small projects, in which only a single activity is 
performed/achieved. The costs involved in such 
small projects do not only require a lower cost 
outlay, but also allows easy tracking of costs for 
the entire project.
</p>
<p>4.2.2  Financial Benefits 
from&nbsp;a&nbsp;CRM Implementation
</p>
<p>While it is relatively easier to identify the costs 
involved in a CRM project, pinpointing the  financial 
benefits from a CRM strategy  implementation 
</p>
<p>4.2 &middot; CRM Implementation Effectiveness</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>requires a firm grasp of the company&rsquo;s pre-CRM 
financials. Since CRM projects are usually complex 
and run over a long period of time, they are 
 implemented in stages. This step by step process 
allows a firm to judge the financial impact (whether 
or not it is a positive gain) of each stage as it is put in 
to place.
</p>
<p>Considering that it is difficult to determine 
concrete financial benefits of CRM initiatives 
directly, companies often consider indirect 
future returns on CRM investment. Some of 
these indirect returns reflect CRM&rsquo;s direct 
impact on costs and revenues, including lower 
customer acquisition costs, lower costs-to-
serve, higher average transaction margin, or 
higher average customer value. Some other 
indirect returns reflect neither cost nor reve-
nue, but the drivers of both. These kind of 
returns include improvements in customer sat-
isfaction, customer retention, customers 
acquired, customer attrition rates, cross-sell 
rates, up-sell rates, products owned per cus-
tomer, inventory turns, average number of 
transactions, share of wallet, customer com-
plaint rates, process costs, rework, employee 
satisfaction, and employee retention.
</p>
<p>As companies in different industries face 
 different CRM problems they also focus on dif-
ferent returns of CRM projects. For example, 
the biggest customer problem for companies in 
the telecom industry is customer churn,1 which 
can be up to 40% a year (Forbes, 2013). 
Therefore, the most important effect of a CRM 
initiative should be improving the retention of 
their most valuable customers and creating 
opportunities for cross selling in order to build 
a multiproduct bond and thus increase switch-
ing costs. In the financial services industry, 
one of the companies&rsquo; major CRM concern is 
lowering transaction costs by shifting custom-
ers from branches to the mobile or Web chan-
nels.
</p>
<p>1 Churn rate is the number of existing customers who 
</p>
<p>have left by the end of a given period divided by the 
</p>
<p>number of existing customers at the beginning of the 
</p>
<p>respective period.
</p>
<p>4.2.3  Computing the&nbsp;ROI 
of&nbsp;CRM Initiatives
</p>
<p>After determining the costs and related financial 
benefits associated with CRM investments, it 
becomes easier to compute the ROI of CRM activ-
ities. In evaluating the ROI of CRM activities, it is 
common for organizations to find that the many 
costs associated with the CRM activities are not 
recovered within the initial project cycle. Even 
though the initial results may look negative, it is 
important to project the return of the project over 
several time periods to ascertain the true ROI of 
the project. Such projections over future time 
periods should also consider the entire cycle of 
developing, implementing, and continuously 
improving the CRM strategy&nbsp; &ndash; a process that is 
long and complex. In addition, an accurate calcu-
lation of ROI entails the understanding and devel-
opment of measurable indices of business 
outcomes in each of the stages of implementation. 
Such indices make it easier for the management to 
identify the financial benefits arising out of the 
implementation (Rust, Lemon, &amp; Zeithaml, 2004).
</p>
<p>So, what does it all mean? The ROI estimates 
vary according to the assumptions made by the 
firm&rsquo;s management. Therefore, it is important to 
obtain a reliable picture of the expected returns 
from a CRM project. How do you ensure CRM 
ROI targets are accepted by the organization? 
This&nbsp; is about ownership as well as accuracy. 
Management must create a shared view of how 
the ROI targets for a CRM project are set. This 
target setting can follow a three-stage process, as 
shown in . Table&nbsp;4.3.
</p>
<p>Before a consensus can be reached, there are 
likely to be iterations between stage 1 and stage 2. 
Estimating the ROI for strategic CRM initiatives 
is by no means easy. Yet, if approached objectively, 
our discussion shows that a satisfactory measure 
of the ROI is not elusive.
</p>
<p>So far in this chapter, we have looked at the 
basic types of CRM implementation projects, the 
main cost drivers for implementation and mainte-
nance, and finally, how to arrive at a reasonable 
measurement of ROI.&nbsp;In the concluding section, 
we will take a deeper look into why CRM imple-
mentation projects can fail.

</p>
<p>4.3  Why Do CRM Implementation 
Projects Fail?
</p>
<p>Anecdotes of failed CRM initiatives are plenty and 
almost every employee or manager can tell inter-
esting, sometimes funny stories about his or her 
company&rsquo;s efforts to bring CRM to life. Yet, the fig-
ures of CRM failures&nbsp;&ndash; which according to several 
market research companies (e.g. Gartner, Forrester 
Research, Economist Intelligence Unit) are as high 
as 50% (ZDNet, 2009)&nbsp;&ndash; are a clear warning sign.
</p>
<p>Diagnosing why CRM initiative fails is thus an 
important aspect in order to learn which traps to 
avoid. Both scientific and practitioner literature has 
put forward a large number of reasons why CRM 
projects fail. Here, a selection of these  reasons is 
provided (Reichheld, Schefter, &amp; Rigby, 2002):
 1. Assumption that CRM is a software tool that 
</p>
<p>manages customer relationships for you.
 2. Implementing CRM before having a CRM 
</p>
<p>strategy.
 3. Poor match between CRM system and organi-
</p>
<p>zational processes.
 4. Resistance from employees.
 5. Poor data quality.
 6. Low &laquo;actionability&raquo; of the information.
</p>
<p>With respect to the first three, we do not go into 
detail here since they were discussed extensively 
in the previous chapter. Instead, we will focus on 
the remaining three reasons for failure since they 
</p>
<p>touch upon crucial aspects during the implemen-
tation of CRM initiatives.
</p>
<p>4.3.1  Resistance from&nbsp;Employees
</p>
<p>The first issue these projects have to address is 
resistance from employees. No value can be real-
ized from CRM without understanding and man-
aging its impact on the people who live with it and 
make it work on a daily basis. The key to success-
fully dealing with the people aspects of change is 
to accept change and to deal with issues as and 
when they arise. However, there are two ways to 
positively deal with resistance.
</p>
<p>First, think of resistance as energy. If employ-
ees are resistant, then this shows that they do 
indeed care, and this is much better than total 
apathy. If the management recognizes resistance 
as energy and passion, its goal will be to channel 
that energy into positive commitment and behav-
ior. Second, resistance is information that tells 
management what is working and what is not 
working in the change process. By paying atten-
tion to resistance and even encouraging it, man-
agement harnesses the energy of change and 
learns about the next steps it must take to make 
the change succeed.
</p>
<p>There are some guidelines that companies can 
follow to overcome resistance and help people uti-
lize the CRM system as well as the information:
</p>

</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p> 5 Plan: Be prepared, focus attention on the 
benefits of changing, the consequences of not 
changing, and the impact of these changes on 
the individual and group.
</p>
<p> 5 Communicate: Hold regular meetings. 
Provide as much information as possible to 
clarify what is happening and how it will 
impact the people.
</p>
<p> 5 Listen: Encourage people to talk about what is 
happening. Allow people to &laquo;grieve&raquo;.
</p>
<p> 5 Support: Understand that there are no quick 
fixes for these changes and managers who 
become champions of change should be 
supported.
</p>
<p>To help handle resistance, the company should not 
only motivate employees to utilize the new system 
and analytical information, but also train them on 
how to use the new system and information. 
Internal marketing campaigns should be initiated 
to motivate the information users, such as sales 
reps, customer service reps, marketing analysts, 
and even decision-making executives, to use the 
analytical information in order to achieve their 
objectives, improve their productivity, and affect 
the company&rsquo;s bottom line so that they can show 
their importance and their impact to the company.
</p>
<p>Implementing CRM requires employees to 
change their work habits. The most effective way to 
do this is training. Users need to be trained on how 
to utilize the information. This process may include 
demonstrating to users how to access and utilize 
needed information, providing users with frequently 
updated and understandable user documentation, 
offering online tutorials that can be customized for 
each user, providing a telephone help line to stand-
by users, and training the &laquo;trainers&raquo;to ensure that 
new users can quickly be up and running the system.
</p>
<p>4.3.2  Poor Data Quality
</p>
<p>Data quality is one of the key challenges for CRM 
implementation. On the one hand it is essential 
for achieving a single definitive view of a customer 
and interact with this customer in a consistent 
way across all touchpoints. On the other hand, 
poor data quality and subsequently poor service 
quality can lead to dissatisfaction among cus-
tomer and at the same time ruin the trust and 
confidence into the CRM system, especially 
among frontline users (Reid &amp; Catteral, 2005).
</p>
<p>The challenge is augmented by the development 
of CRM from a rather functional to a strategic level 
involving multiple functions within the company. 
This essentially means that employees from many 
different departments are required to interact with 
parts of the system and contribute information to 
the CRM system in order to create a 360-degree 
view of the customer. Moreover, with the advent 
and increasing importance of self-service technolo-
gies (e.g. self-service stations or account registra-
tion via the internet) even customers themselves 
actively enter information that is relevant for CRM 
activities. This has important implications for data 
quality if we consider that human action is never 
error-free. For example, industry estimates show 
that a competent data- entry clerk has an error rate 
of 2&ndash;4% while the error rate of data entered via the 
web is 10&ndash;15% (Krill, 2001).
</p>
<p>There are several types of poor data quality 
(Reid &amp; Catteral, 2005):
</p>
<p> 5 Poor data entry (including misspellings, 
typographical errors, or variations).
</p>
<p> 5 Missing data.
 5 Lack of company-wide coding standards 
(and/or missing unique identifiers in all 
relevant data sources).
</p>
<p> 5 Multiple databases scattered throughout the 
organization (with potentially conflicting 
information and/or missing unique identifiers 
across data sources).
</p>
<p> 5 Legacy systems containing poorly docu-
mented of obsolete data.
</p>
<p>Each reason for poor data quality has implications 
for the implementation of a CRM system and even-
tually how it can support users in CRM activities. 
While there is no simple solution for addressing 
poor data quality, the following recommendations 
can help deal with the challenge:
</p>
<p> 5 It is imperative to consider data quality at the 
very beginning when devising the CRM 
strategy (Alshawi, Missi, &amp; Irani, 2011). 
Often, severe data problems only become 
apparent when project reaches the step of 
implementing a CRM application. Therefore, 
having a realistic idea of the data quality 
before the projects starts is a first step. This 
includes a thorough analysis of the status quo 
of data quality for the main sources of data.
</p>
<p> 5 The assessment of data quality should be 
followed by a one-time effort for data cleans-
ing. Often, this involves replacing legacy 
</p>
<p> Chapter 4 &middot; Implementing the&nbsp;CRM Strategy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>59 4
</p>
<p>systems integrating data into a central 
database, also called data warehouse.
</p>
<p> 5 Finally, data quality is highly dependent on 
continuous data care. Most importantly, it 
requires specific processes to detect and correct 
erroneous data entries that occur during the 
deployment of the CRM application. If data 
quality deteriorates at a rate of 2% per month, 
this translates into almost a quarter of the entire 
customer database annually (Thompson &amp; 
Sarner, 2009). Thus, companies need to install 
an on-going routine for data quality mainte-
nance which includes explicit roles and 
responsibilities, adaption of incentives (e.g. for 
call center service staff) and close collaboration 
between IT, data management and system users.
</p>
<p>4.3.3  Low &laquo;Actionability&raquo; 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Information
</p>
<p>Many companies engaging in CRM implemen-
tation initiatives report that they not capable 
</p>
<p>of deriving actionable and personalized advice 
to their customers and/or service/sales agents 
(Gartner, 2001). Thus, at worst, a CRM system is 
simply a huge exercise of data collection without 
improving business processes and decision mak-
ing and in the end, helping serve customers better. 
New technologies of predictive analytics may help 
improve on that end. Yet, for many applications, it 
is still advisable to have a dedicated team of data/
business analysts that help make sense of the data. 
This can involve both, periodic reports of specific 
key performance indicators (e.g. leads generated 
by campaigns, rate of successful lead conversions, 
percentage of first contact resolution in service 
situations, etc.) as well as tailored analyses for 
frontline business units.
</p>
<p>Overall, the discussion above shows that 
many challenges later in the implementation 
process could and should be addressed from 
the beginning. . Figure&nbsp; 4.1 shows how invest-
ing in CRM by overcoming challenges ulti-

strategies are developed and implemented suc-

</p>
<p>4.4  Case Study: CRM at Capital 
One2 (United Kingdom)
</p>
<p>4.4.1  Case Background
</p>
<p>Capital One&rsquo;s leaders, Richard Fairbank and Nigel 
Morris, had a vision of creating an information- 
based company rather than a financial services com-
pany when they worked in the consulting business 
in the late 1980s. They envisioned that the strategy 
for credit card providers should be to deliver &laquo;the 
right product to the right customer at the right time, 
at the right price&raquo;. While sounding obvious, their 
statement marked a revolution that would trigger 
huge changes in the credit card business. However, 
this revolution did not happen overnight.
</p>
<p>As consultants, Fairbank and Morris could see 
the potential for improving the credit card busi-
ness for both customers and shareholders alike 
through the application of their nascent strategy 
ideas. The US credit card market during the 1980s 
was characterized by the fact that the financial 
institutions were offering very similar products 
</p>
<p>2 This case was&nbsp;prepared by Ulrike Wiehr, the&nbsp;Boston 
</p>
<p>Consulting Group MBA Fellow, under the&nbsp;supervision 
</p>
<p>of&nbsp;Professor Werner J.&nbsp;Reinartz, at INSEAD.
</p>
<p>across the whole spectrum of their customer 
bases, charging a standard 19.8% interest rate and 
a US$20 annual fee. The market lacked a custom-
ization of offers, and one-to-one marketing was 
practically inexistent. The prevailing story was 
very much &laquo;one size fits all&raquo;.
</p>
<p>The journey began in late 1988, when Signet 
Bank, in Virginia, not only bought Fairbank and 
Morris&rsquo; concept but also engaged them to execute 
the plan from within. In contrast to the prevailing 
attitude of the major players, Signet put a different 
understanding at the heart of its new strategy. 
According to Morris and Fairbank:
</p>
<p> &raquo; Credit cards are not banking, they are infor-
mation. It&rsquo;s all about collecting information 
</p>
<p>on millions of people that you&rsquo;ve never met, 
</p>
<p>and, on the basis of that information, mak-
</p>
<p>ing a series of critical decisions about lending 
</p>
<p>money to them and hoping they pay you back.
</p>
<p>Therefore, Signet Bank rebuilt its credit card 
operations around information technology and 
sophisticated analytical techniques. This new 
adopted strategy, named &laquo;Information Based 
Strategy&raquo; (IBS) was to compile what was ultimately 
to become the world&rsquo;s largest Oracle database, 
allowing the company to understand its customers 
and to develop mass-customized products, which 
would ideally suit their needs and risk profile.
</p>
<p>By early 1994, Signet made the decision to float 
the credit card business separately, and hence 
Capital One Financial Corporation was born in 
November 1994, with Richard Fairbank as 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Nigel 
Morris as President and Chief Operating Officer.
</p>
<p>Since its IPO in 1994&ndash;2011, the stock price of 
the company has increased by almost 400% and 
the company has grown at an average annual rate 
of about 40%, excluding mergers and acquisitions. 
At the end of the first quarter in 2011, the com-
pany reported quarterly revenue of $4.082 billion 
and 43 million customers worldwide, serviced by 
more than 27,000 employees. Moreover, has 
received many awards in different domains, most 
particular as being a responsible employer (e.g. the 
U.S Department of Labor&rsquo;s Award for contributions 
to create a youth supply pipeline in 2008 or third in 
the Sunday Times Best Place to Work in the UK in 
2001), providing excellent customer service (e.g. 
CIO 100 award for Customer Excellence) or for its 
technological leadership (e.g. the Gartner Group 
Excellence in Technology&rsquo; Award).

<p>Encouraged by its success in the US, Capital 
One decided to launch its first overseas opera-
tions in the UK.&nbsp;In July 1998, Capital One opened 
its operations center in Nottingham. On day one, 
250 associates were employed. By 2001, this num-
ber had grown to over 2000, and Capital One 
associates in Nottingham now deal with applica-
tion processing, customer service, product design 
and marketing, card issuing, collections, business 
development and database management. As early 
as 2002, the company reached profitability and 
became one of UK&rsquo;s top six credit card issuers.
</p>
<p>Capital One&rsquo;s percentage of outstanding bad 
debt, a key performance measure in a risk-driven 
business, was significantly lower than that of key 
competitors. This is especially significant, given 
that the company, unlike most of its competitors, 
lends to customers across the whole credit risk 
spectrum. At year end, 2001, Capital One posted 
its 18th consecutive quarter of record earnings: 
annual earnings grew by more than 20% and 
delivered a yearly return on equity of more than 
20%. Reaching this goal seven times in a row put 
Capital One in a league with only seven other 
publicly held US companies. From 2001 to 2007, 
Capital One&rsquo;s quarterly revenues fluctuated, but 
maintained a steady annual increase in revenues. 
In 2008, Capital One enjoyed a successful first 
quarter before succumbing to the economic cli-
mate and experiencing quarterly fluctuations 
with annual revenue losses during both 2008 and 
2009. In response to this 2&nbsp;year downturn, Capital 
</p>
<p>One recorded its highest annual and quarterly 
revenues, a positive sign for what is to come (see 
. Fig.&nbsp;4.2 for the growth history of Capital One&rsquo;s 
revenues).
</p>
<p>In early 2001, Fairbank and Morris could not 
help wondering about its success: while all their 
competitors were also embracing CRM 
(Customer Relationship Management), and most 
seemed to pursue the concept with significant 
investments in software and reorganization, 
Capital One&rsquo;s customer base was developing at a 
compound annual growth rate of 40%. It seemed 
as if Capital One could indeed be seen as creating 
industry best practice in developing valuable cus-
tomer relationships and managing risk based on 
an intimate understanding of the customer. But 
what exactly was it that made Capital One&rsquo;s 
approach to CRM so unique? Was the company&rsquo;s 
success down to luck or was it based on a real 
competitive advantage&nbsp;&ndash; and, if so, would this be 
a sustainable advantage, in the light of competi-
tors&rsquo; efforts on CRM?

<p>4.4.2  Industry Background
</p>
<p> An Overview of&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK Credit Card 
Market
</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the major British banks domi-
nated the market (such as Barclays, Lloyds, The 
Midland, NatWest, and The Royal Bank of 
Scotland). These banks would typically charge all

</p>
<p>customers interest rates of about 22% as well as an 
annual fee of &pound;12. Products were barely differenti-
ated and customers had little real choice. In the 
mid-1990s, the market was shaken up by the 
entrance of competitive US banks such as Capital 
One, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and MBNA, 
that targeted the UK market to expand their own 
business. The Internet wave also prompted the 
emergence of new competitors such as the online 
banks Egg, Cahoot and IF.
</p>
<p>The introductory offer of the new entrants 
revealed an aggressive pricing strategy. By offer-
ing lower interest rates and lower fees, they built 
sizeable customer bases. Moreover, many of the 
new entrants dismissed the idea of a standard 
interest rate and introduced more differentiated 
pricing schemes. As a consequence, the credit 
card market became highly competitive and the 
market share of the major UK banks (two thirds 
of credit cards in issue) was eroding (see 
. Fig.&nbsp; 4.3 for market shares shortly after the 
market entry of the new competitors such as 
Capital One). In addition, it was evident that the 
days of the standard interest rate were truly 
over.
</p>
<p> Credit Card Revenues
</p>
<p>Credit card issuers have many sources of income 
from the use of credit cards as a payment device 
or as a form of credit. The most frequent are: 
interest charge paid by customers taking 
extended credit, annual card fees, interchange (a 
service commission from the merchants accept-
ing the card) and other fees, such as late or over-
limit fees.
</p>
<p>Another valuable source of income for credit 
card issuers is the revenue originated by cross-
selling other financial products related to the 
cards, such as insurance against fraud, or personal 
loans and mortgages. However, the main source 
of profit for a card company is the Annual 
Percentage Rate (APR) on an outstanding bal-
ance, i.e., the use of the credit card requires that 
the customer pays a specific minimum propor-
tion of their balance each month, and, in addition, 
an interest rate on the outstanding balance. The 
more outstanding balances customers have, the 
greater the company&rsquo;s revenues are, and the higher 
the APR, the higher the interest charges incurred.
</p>
<p> Consumers
</p>
<p>As mentioned, credit cards may be both a pay-
ment device and a form of revolving credit. Credit 
card customers can be divided into two main seg-
ments:
 1. Transactors: Clients who regularly repay their 
</p>
<p>entire balance.
 2. Revolvers: Clients who pay less than their 
</p>
<p>entire balance and usually benefit from an 
interest-free grace period, which may be up to 
54&nbsp;days.
</p>
<p>Revolvers are the customers who provide the big-
gest source of revenue, since they are always 
revolving their credit and therefore always pro-
viding revenue as they pay their interests.
</p>
<p>Relatively buoyant consumer confidence and 
low interest rates have combined to create an 
environment in which consumers are happy to 
take on extra debt. An example of this confident

</p>
<p>environment is the comparative strength of both 
credit and debit card markets, with charge cards 
in issue trailing far behind (see . Table&nbsp;4.4 for the 
evolution of card issues). The growth in the num-
ber of credit cards in issue is, in part, a result of 
the increased market competition but also a con-
sequence of the changing attitude of the British 
towards credit. The amount of total consumer 
credit increased by 96.7% from 1995 to 2001 
(&pound;89.1bn to &pound;175.3bn). Credit cards represented 
53.5% of this total credit in 1995, rising to 59.6% 
in 2001. For many, consumer credit is simply 
another financial tool to be taken advantage of, in 
the same way as a current account or mortgage.
</p>
<p>Also, consumers are increasingly happy to play 
credit card providers off against one another, 
switching from card to card in order to take advan-
tage of introductory deals. While APR is clearly a 
key factor in customers&rsquo; preferences for specific 
cards, there are other factors that influence their 
choices. These include, for example, the availabil-
ity of a reward point system, the acceptance rate at 
stores, the size of the credit line, the card design, or 
the affiliation with a charitable organization.
</p>
<p>4.4.3  Capital One Company 
Background
</p>
<p> Business Model
</p>
<p>The business model of Capital One is founded on 
the simple, yet crucial, premise that each cus-
tomer requires a different product and service 
from its credit card provider. The company 
</p>
<p>believes in the assertion that customers, if offered 
what they want and need, as opposed to what 
banks want to offer them, will choose the provider 
that gives them choice and individuality.
</p>
<p>Each customer carries a specific and unique 
credit risk and potential revenue profile, mainly 
based on his or her previous credit history (or lack 
thereof). The better the company can understand 
and assess a customer&rsquo;s specific risk, the better it 
can manage it. Moreover, the better it understands 
the customer, the more it can tailor its products to 
his or her needs. Risk is a crucial factor in the 
credit card business. &laquo;We&rsquo;re in a risk-driven busi-
ness where one bad debtor can easily wipe out the 
benefits from 20 average customers or 4.5 good 
ones&nbsp;&ndash; thus, it&rsquo;s vital to manage them carefully,&raquo; 
explains Ian Cornelius. &laquo;It is one of our competi-
tive advantages to understand and manage these 
different levels of risk.&raquo;
</p>
<p> Information-Based Strategy (IBS)
</p>
<p>Capital One&rsquo;s goal is to use information to acquire 
the types of customers it can most profitably 
serve. In order to understand them, the company 
uses information technology to accumulate and 
manage large amounts of data on its customers. 
Alongside publicly available data on credit risk, 
the company supplements this with data on cus-
tomer demographics and behavior collected 
internally during the application and account 
management process, where every transaction is 
carefully registered. None of this could be 
achieved without the entire company being com-
pletely aligned behind the whole process.
</p>
<p>With the data accumulated, the company exe-
cutes its proprietary &laquo;Test &amp; Learn&raquo; strategy. Test 
&amp; Learn is a scientific, hypothesis-driven approach 
to test any customer related activity in a controlled 
condition on a sample of customers before rolling 
it out on a large scale. Using this scientific process, 
Capital One&rsquo;s Marketing and Analysis teams 
develop ideas, design products, and select target 
customers. Real products are empirically tested 
with genuine customers: the number of tests run 
is impressive&nbsp;&ndash; 36,000&nbsp;in 1999 and 45,000&nbsp;in 2000. 
. Figure&nbsp;4.4 summarizes the principle behind the 
&laquo;Test &amp; Learn&raquo; strategy. For example, mailings 
with different copy and/or letter design are sent 
out to potential customers. Their response rates 
are monitored, as is their behavior as new cus-
tomers, so that Capital One can understand the 
relative value of different offers. All test results are

</p>
<p>then analyzed and integrated into databases that 
can be referenced later to initiate further ideas on 
development and product design. Similarly, by 
analyzing customer behavior, the view of risk can 
be refined, and the credit offer can be improved 
accordingly. Balance-building programs can be 
targeted at the low risk customer, thereby reduc-
ing the average loss rate of the portfolio.
</p>
<p>As a result, the company continues to improve 
its portfolio of products and services, and it now 
offers more than 6000 products, most of them vari-
ations of credit cards. Here are some key products:
</p>
<p> 5 Credit cards with different conditions (APR, 
credit limit, fees) and designs.
</p>
<p> 5 Products directly related to the credit card 
such as card protection plans and payment 
protection insurance (cross-selling).
</p>
<p> 5 Other financial services such as travel 
insurance.
</p>
<p>4.4.4  CRM Practices  
at Capital One&nbsp;(UK)
</p>
<p>Managing its relationships with customers is at 
the heart of Capital One&rsquo;s strategy. CRM is not 
seen as a tactical or functional approach but as a 
key strategic process. This strategic CRM orien-
tation expresses itself; for example, in the way 
the various corporate functions are interlinked. 
It is not only the way in which departments are 
structured but also the way they interact with 
</p>
<p>one another. As Capital One managers usually 
say: &laquo;All departments work in an integrated 
fashion and there are no silos within the com-
pany.&raquo; Internally, the company is grouped in 
four key activities.
 1. Marketing &amp; Analysis (M&amp;A): Responsible 
</p>
<p>for Capital One marketing strategy, product 
development, credit and risk management, 
pricing strategy, monitoring market trends 
and competition.
</p>
<p> 2. Operations: In charge of all front- and 
back-office operations and for all customer 
inter-processes (e.g., cross-selling, customer 
acquisition and retention, etc.).
</p>
<p> 3. Information Technology (IT): In charge of the 
development and maintenance of the systems 
infrastructure.
</p>
<p> 4. Human Resources (HR): Responsible for 
employee recruitment, training and develop-
ment, the internal satisfaction survey and for 
nurturing the company&rsquo;s culture.
</p>
<p> Marketing &amp; Analysis (M&amp;A)
</p>
<p>Capital One&rsquo;s M&amp;A department has, as its main 
functions: segmentation, testing and analyzing 
customer data in order to elaborate the company&rsquo;s 
marketing strategy, and the development of new 
products and services. To segment customers, 
Capital One uses analytical techniques and tests 
to identify groups of customers and to cluster 
them into segments according their risk profile 
and behavior.

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Segmentation Strategy
</p>
<p>Capital One&rsquo;s segmentation strategy focuses on a 
full spectrum approach (i.e., it targets all types of 
risk profiles, offering them different products and 
prices accordingly). The company&rsquo;s database has 
many types of customers, such as &laquo;transactors&raquo;, 
with a low risk profile, and &laquo;revolvers&raquo;. Capital 
One was able to further distinguish two sub- 
segments in the latter group: &laquo;high risk revolv-
ers&raquo;, with a high level of credit line utilization and 
high probability of default, and &laquo;low risk revolv-
ers&raquo;, who use their credit line extensively but pay 
back their balances. In order to identify this prof-
itable low risk &laquo;revolvers&raquo; segment, Capital One 
carried out some tests that revealed that these 
customers could be targeted by making them a 
better interest rate offer. In fact, offering them a 
lower APR to encourage them to transfer their 
balances from other banks to Capital One proves 
to be an attractive offer, since these customers 
intend to repay the balance they have already cre-
ated. Many other tests were conducted to fine- 
tune the solicitation of these customers in terms 
of contact channels, credit offers and mailing 
preferences.
</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s other large customer segment 
is composed of customers for whom the Capital 
One card is very often the first card. This segment 
also includes people who have had problems 
obtaining or handling credit in the past, people 
with limited or non-existent credit records and 
young people. Since this segment carries a rela-
tively higher risk, these customers are usually not 
well served by products offered by the main high 
street banks. Capital One&rsquo;s strategy in this case is 
to offer these customers an initial higher APR 
with an annual fee and a lower credit line. While 
this is clearly higher than other Capital One offers, 
it usually compares very favorably with alterna-
tive credit offers on the market, and represents 
good value to these customers.
</p>
<p>Account Manager, Cavendish Elithorn, 
explains why the offer is an attractive one for this 
segment: &laquo;Given their credit history, the Capital 
One card is still a better deal than other sources of 
credit&nbsp;&ndash; store cards where interest rates are 30%, 
brokers who charge 40&ndash;50%, or door-to-door 
lenders with 100% rates.&raquo; The potential volume of 
this segment is significant, which is why Capital 
One has the potential to grow this customer base 
alongside the low risk segment. The challenges to 
</p>
<p>identify this segment are the same as those of 
&laquo;low risk customers&raquo;: identify the customers, 
their risk assessment and managing attrition. To 
evaluate the customer risk profile on application, 
the company rates them based on their credit 
scoring, information taken from the application 
forms and credit bureau data.
</p>
<p>Retention Strategy
</p>
<p>To attract &laquo;low risk revolvers&raquo; with balances in 
other banks, Capital One may offer them a card 
with an introductory low rate that expires after a 
few months, and no annual fee. However, when 
the introductory rate expires, Capital One may 
witness increasing attrition from these clients, as 
many price-sensitive customers tend to reduce 
their debt or leave Capital One, without notifying 
the company or closing their account. &laquo;This is a 
dangerous development as it&rsquo;s the best custom-
ers&nbsp;&ndash; those that are low risk&nbsp;&ndash; that tend to leave to 
get better credit deals elsewhere,&raquo; explains an 
account manager. &laquo;Consequently, we have active 
strategies to keep these customers, and their bal-
ances.&raquo;
</p>
<p>Many of the account management activities 
seek to keep these customers from being &laquo;dor-
mant&raquo; or becoming permanently inactive. These 
retention activities are designed to help retain 
customers when their introductory rate expires or 
when other accounts risk &laquo;dormancy&raquo;. &laquo;If a cus-
tomer&rsquo;s account is dormant for a while, there is an 
increasing risk of losing that customer,&raquo; explains 
Ian Cornelius. &laquo;That&rsquo;s why we have a number of 
activities in place to guard against this&nbsp;&ndash; by mak-
ing a range of offers to reactivate their account.&raquo;
</p>
<p>Capital One&rsquo;s retention strategy with this type 
of low risk segment is basically to grow the low 
credit line they received at the beginning of their 
relationship. Furthermore, they may also receive 
increased benefits, different card designs and 
other incentives to stay with Capital One. The key 
strategy with these customers is to treat them as 
well as any other customer segment. Just because 
Capital One was the best available offer on the 
market when they joined, it does not mean it will 
always be the case. Consequently, Capital One 
works hard to retain these customers.
</p>
<p>At various points in time in the customer life-
cycle, Capital One analyses its customer database 
in order to fine-tune its offers and retain custom-
ers. The behavioral and performance data allows 
</p>

</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>the company to make proactive rate or credit limit 
offers, whenever appropriate. IBS testing is also 
used to help identify low- and high-risk customer 
profiles. By making different offers to customers, 
the company learns more about customer behav-
ior and therefore improves its targeting and 
 retention.
</p>
<p> Operations
</p>
<p>In order to offer a wide variety of cards and ser-
vices, Capital One aligns its Operations depart-
ment with customer requirements. This strategy 
has proven to give Capital One a competitive 
advantage over other banks in the market. Rather 
than taking the &laquo;assembly line&raquo; approach, the 
company attempts to handle its customers in a 
personalized and flexible way.
</p>
<p>The Operations department handles front-
end customer relationships. There are over 1000 
people working in Capital One&rsquo;s call-center, han-
dling more than 10,000 incoming calls per day. 
Most call center type operations are aligned man-
agerially and operationally in order to achieve 
specific targets that often compete with one 
another: (1) low cost efficiency, (2) high quality 
customer service, (3) flexibility and (4) associate 
satisfaction. In fact, these four measures are the 
cornerstones of a model known as the &laquo;Big Yellow 
Square&raquo; (BYS). Each quarter, the management 
team rate themselves on these four &laquo;corners&raquo; to 
take a qualitative assessment of how &laquo;big&raquo; and 
&laquo;square&raquo; the BYS is at any time. This is a simple 
model, easy to buy into emotionally. The BYS 
indicates that Capital One&rsquo;s view on operating a 
call center differs from most other organizations, 
particularly in the way it weights &laquo;associate satis-
faction&raquo;, which is equally important as &laquo;service 
quality&raquo; and &laquo;cost efficiency&raquo;.
</p>
<p>As mentioned, &laquo;Flexibility&raquo; is one of the BYS 
corners. Because the company tests so many 
products in the marketplace on a regular basis, 
flexibility in the approach and attitude of the 
Operations staff is a key part of the business&rsquo; suc-
cess. Flexibility is also present in the way that 
Capital One deals with operational overloads. 
Many associates, even those who normally do not 
work with the Operations department, are trained 
in one or more disciplines. Also, when volumes 
exceed expectations in a particular area, manag-
ers take the decision to ask associates to tempo-
rarily move jobs to cope with the peaks. Eventually, 
this action is more likely to be taken when there is 
</p>
<p>an unexpected surge in high value customer con-
tacts, such as applications for new products.
</p>
<p>Another important aspect of Capital One&rsquo;s 
strategy is the way it uses customer profitability 
analysis. Profitability is calculated on an individ-
ual basis to improve the product offer to each cus-
tomer. However, the company does not normally 
differentiate customer service levels according to 
a customer&rsquo;s profitability. As Mitch Beres explains:
</p>
<p> &raquo; We would not be comfortable matching up 
high-value customers with high-level ser-
</p>
<p>vice&nbsp;&ndash; every customer has a choice of whether 
</p>
<p>to use us or go elsewhere, and our quality of 
</p>
<p>service can be a reason for them to stay. We 
</p>
<p>aim to offer high- quality service to all our cus-
</p>
<p>tomers, regardless of their profitability.
</p>
<p>However, Phil Marsland reflects on the subject 
of differentiating customer service: &laquo;It is a real 
question to me whether the lower risk customers 
should cross-subsidize those with higher risk, or 
whether everyone should get the deal they 
deserve.&raquo; Although Capital One does not cur-
rently follow this line of thinking, Marsland&rsquo;s 
comment indicates that Capital One&rsquo;s manage-
ment is constantly contemplating new ways of 
managing its business, and may even consider 
changing this current strategy.
</p>
<p>Another element that differentiates Capital 
One&rsquo;s Operations department from others is its IT 
infrastructure. IT is used to route calls and pro-
vide associates with the necessary information to 
best handle specific calls. The systems are updated 
directly by call-center associates. Therefore, as 
soon as each call is completed, associates enter 
information about the interaction in an encoded 
form into the system, which will then be available 
for the next contact with the customer. In some 
ways, this ensures a modern version of so-called 
&laquo;old fashioned&raquo; personal service. More specifi-
cally, the Operations department is divided in 
four main areas:
 1. Operations processing
 2. Customer relations
 3. Sales
 4. Collections
 5. Co-operation between M&amp;A and operations
</p>
<p>Operations Processing
</p>
<p>Operations processing handles all back-office 
operations. Some examples of its key functions 
are: keying in credit card applications, scanning 
</p>
<p> Chapter 4 &middot; Implementing the&nbsp;CRM Strategy</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>all incoming correspondence into a document 
management system, managing vendors such as 
card embossers and statement printers and han-
dling payments from customers.
</p>
<p> Customer Relations
</p>
<p>Customer relations handle incoming calls. While 
it is primarily devoted to providing particular ser-
vice requirements and receiving customer com-
plaints, it also attempts to cross-sell when 
appropriate. 400 customer service associates 
receive about 8000&ndash;10,000 calls a day. These asso-
ciates use the sales system (called SALSA&nbsp;&ndash; also 
used in the Sales department) when attempting to 
cross-sell. This allows them to identify suitable 
products to the customer who is calling and to 
avoid offering the same product twice.
</p>
<p>Customer service associates, as well as sales 
associates, work to an incentive scheme that 
encourages sales and quality service. This incentive 
scheme is characterized by the following criteria:
</p>
<p> 5 Average handling time of the call: Measured 
by the number of calls routed per day and the 
average call length in seconds.
</p>
<p> 5 Sales points per contact: A sale is encour-
aged by awarding points per product sold in 
order to reflect product profitability.
</p>
<p> 5 Quality: This is measured by using a system 
that records ten random calls a month, per 
associate, to which managers listen and give 
feedback.
</p>
<p>Associates receive a review of their performance 
weekly that shows how they rank against overall 
department targets and against their own past per-
formance. The call listening program, introduced 
2&nbsp;years ago by senior management, is very rigorous. 
As one customer relation manager explains: &laquo;This 
feedback from senior management has served not 
only as an extra quality screen, but also as a visible 
signal to our front-line associates that they are 
</p>
<p>important&raquo;. Competition between individual asso-
ciates and call-center teams is also encouraged. On 
the call-center walls, colorful charts track the per-
formance of different teams. Awards are given to 
the best performing teams or individuals, and their 
pictures are displayed on internal notice boards or 
appear in in- house publications.
</p>
<p>Sales
</p>
<p>The Sales department is divided into the following 
units:
</p>
<p> 5 Inbound: Customers call to activate their 
cards or to respond to a marketing offer.
</p>
<p> 5 Outbound: Capital One associates call the 
customers to sell them a product or to provide 
a proactive service (e.g., customers who 
received a card but did not take out the 
payment protection insurance).
</p>
<p> 5 Retention: Associates try to retain customers 
who intend to close their accounts.
</p>
<p> 5 New Business: Sales are attempted with new 
customers.
</p>
<p>Within all units, teams of 12&ndash;14 associates plus a 
supervisor and a manager are formed. While 
some specialization is encouraged, there is also 
cross-staffing and rotation to familiarize sales 
people with other tasks and teams, and to allow 
for flexibility in meeting peak demand.
</p>
<p>Offering new products to customers is one of 
the key tasks of the Sales department. Given the 
variety of new products on offer every month, 
computer-based training modules are developed 
to familiarize sales personnel with the new 
offers. When cross selling, Capital One&rsquo;s cross-
selling system determines the likelihood of cus-
tomers to buy certain products based on the 
projected NPV of a product to a customer, and 
suggests different products to different custom-
ers, or even no selling attempt at all (see 
. Table&nbsp;4.5 for the model).

</p>
<p> 1. Customer 4324 1223 7874 3335 calls in.
 2. System checks whether any sale is permis-
</p>
<p>sible in this channel (e.g. have we tried a CSM 
approach recently).
</p>
<p> 3. Product priority is sourced from the NPV 
table.
</p>
<p> 4. System checks whether approaches are allow-
able on these products. E.g. excludes product 
if customer already holds it or where the 
product has been attempted recently.
</p>
<p> 5. The list of products we are &laquo;happy to offer&raquo; is 
shown to the associate, with the primary 
product at the top of the list.
</p>
<p>The SALSA sales system enables targeting cross-
sell offers to specific customers likely to be inter-
ested in particular products. To avoid inundating 
the customer with offers, SALSA prevents Capital 
One associates from offering the same product 
twice within a short period of time. Associates are 
not encouraged to sell more than one product 
during a single call, even if SALSA suggests more 
than one product offer. As one sales associate 
explains, 
</p>
<p> &raquo; the target time for a call is challenging&nbsp;&ndash; this 
means you really need your sales pitch honed 
</p>
<p>and ready! 
</p>
<p>This minimizes the chances of wasting the 
time of both customers and associates.
</p>
<p>The SALSA system also uses accumulated data 
on customers to suggest how to react to specific 
customer requests. For example, if a customer 
asks for a credit line increase, a reduced APR or a 
cash advance, data on past behavior and risk 
assessment are used to decide whether to grant 
the request or not.
</p>
<p>Collections
</p>
<p>The Collections department deals with customers 
who have fallen behind with their payments or 
with accounts affected by fraud. The department 
is split into three main areas: payment assistance, 
recoveries and fraud.
</p>
<p>In payment assistance, Capital One associates 
work with customers who are behind with their 
payments to try and help them recover their 
account. For example, if the customer cannot pay 
his bill because she is unemployed, payment assis-
tance may put her in contact with a recruiting 
agency. If the customer is ill, payments may be 
</p>
<p>temporarily suspended. In other circumstances, 
customers who are behind with their payments 
may be offered revised terms, enabling them to 
make smaller, and regular payments. The overrid-
ing goal is to keep customers until they can pay 
and help them not to default. Elithorn explains:
</p>
<p> &raquo; We believe we are better than most working 
with all customers to come to satisfactory 
</p>
<p>solutions. For example, other card issuers 
</p>
<p>might ask customers what they intend to 
</p>
<p>do, in order to get out of debt, or give them 
</p>
<p>few workable options. We might say that for 
</p>
<p>a specific customer, based on our data, the 
</p>
<p>best solution would be to lower its interest 
</p>
<p>rate. We are still a long way away from indi-
</p>
<p>vidual solutions, but closer to it than most 
</p>
<p>others in this field.
</p>
<p>In recoveries, Capital One looks after those 
customers whose debt has been charged off and 
whose accounts are no longer open. The objective 
is to work with the customer to recover as much 
of the debt as possible.
</p>
<p>Finally, the fraud team has two fundamental 
tasks: to help customers who have been victims of 
fraud and to prevent fraud itself. In the case of 
fraudulent activity, the team closes down the old 
account, writes off any fraudulent charges and 
transfers genuine transactions into a new account. 
Customers affected by fraud usually need a higher 
level of support, and the fraud team is trained to 
treat each case with sensitivity. A wide range of 
systems is in place to help prevent fraud, including 
real time transaction models and account behav-
ior pattern systems. Very often, the fraud customer 
service team calls customers to let them know that 
they might have been victims of fraud, even before 
the customer realizes it. This is yet another strong 
selling point for Capital One from the customer 
relationship management perspective.
</p>
<p>Co-operation Between M&amp;A 
</p>
<p>and&nbsp;Operations
</p>
<p>Given the large number of tests carried out and 
new products developed within Capital One 
each year, there clearly has to be a great deal of 
co- operation between these two major depart-
ments. For example, when introducing a new 
product, M&amp;A and Operations work very closely 
together. While M&amp;A designs the product, devel-
ops marketing material and follows up customer 
</p>
<p> Chapter 4 &middot; Implementing the&nbsp;CRM Strategy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>69 4
</p>
<p>responses, Operations collect regular feedback 
from customers and make improvement sugges-
tions. The information from Operations is also 
used to improve the NPV models that serve as 
decision-making mechanisms.
</p>
<p>Much of the information on customers that is 
used to craft strategy is obtained from front-end 
associates, who are, of course, closest to the cus-
tomer. There is a partnership between Operations 
and M&amp;A to review the risk perspective of pres-
ent as well as future strategies. Of course, such a 
tight link between Operations and M&amp;A would 
not function without the enablement through 
IT.&nbsp;Furthermore, numerous permanent or ad hoc 
cross-functional teams, composed of members 
from Operations and M&amp;A, exist to define, for 
example, the credit policies for new and existing 
products.
</p>
<p> Information Technology (IT)
</p>
<p>The IT department sits at Capital One&rsquo;s head table 
and reports directly to the board in its own right&nbsp;&ndash; 
it is highly valued as the enabler of business strat-
egy. The IT division performs a broad function, 
ranging from pure business issues and decisions 
on how the company should deploy its resources 
and finances, through applications and software 
engineering, to detailed technical issues of hard-
ware, operating systems and networking. After 
Operations, IT is the company&rsquo;s second-largest 
division.
</p>
<p>Against common practice in the financial 
industry, Capital One chose to in-source the 
majority of its IT capability, relying on the speed, 
management acumen and expertise of its in-
house provision. Much of the IT intellectual prop-
erty of the business is implemented internally, 
which proves that IT has become a core compe-
tence. This department offers a full-service capa-
bility to the business (Operations and M&amp;A), 
covering the spectrum of products and processes 
through their genesis and complete life cycle. It 
houses the data, performs guardianship of the 
information, excels in data warehousing, and 
assures that the information can be readily 
accessed. All the terabytes of customer behavior 
data are kept indefinitely in- house for online or 
near-online access. Through query tools, batch 
updates and transactional data, IT provides the 
tools that enable IBS to work successfully. The IT 
department contributes to CRM activities in the 
following domains:
</p>
<p> 1. Prospect pool and solicitation management
 2. Account acquisition and management
 3. Account servicing and call- center technologies
</p>
<p>Prospect Pool and&nbsp;Solicitation 
</p>
<p>Manage&nbsp;ment
</p>
<p>Capital One differentiates itself from the competi-
tion because of its internal prospect pool manage-
ment and solicitation process. Rather than 
outsourcing the data on a prospect&rsquo;s behavior and 
lifestyle, Capital One runs an in-house database 
with this information, which targets and selects 
customer audiences and matches products 
according to the prospects&rsquo; profiles. The informa-
tion gathered over the years on Capital One cus-
tomers has proved to be very useful in this 
perspective to tailor products to individuals.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, Capital One has been using 
direct mail campaigns to target new customers. 
This approach has proved to be very beneficial 
since it allows the company to predict gross and 
net response rates to various offers, according to 
the product, customer type and creative process 
chosen. This allows an accurate prediction of its 
marketing effectiveness. Once the campaign 
results are received, data are introduced back into 
the Prospect and Solicitation Management sys-
tem, to provide further data that will improve 
future acquisition programs.
</p>
<p>Account Acquisition and&nbsp;Management
</p>
<p>When a prospect becomes a customer, Capital 
One creates an account on the account manage-
ment system, where all interactions with custom-
ers, from account detail changes to transactions 
and payments, are recorded. This information 
will create the customer profile, which allows the 
company to differentiate offers according to cus-
tomer preferences. In fact, front-end customer 
acquisition processes rely upon sophisticated sets 
of credit models and automated decision algo-
rithms to process the high volume of applications 
via the various channels (telephone, Internet, 
mail). Hardcopy applications are scanned and 
retained on optical disk. This information is sub-
sequently communicated to credit bureau and 
external fraud prevention agencies that provide 
Capital One with up-to-date information about 
applicants. All the raw data are recycled to MIS 
on a daily basis. This consolidates the core of the 
IBS account management programs through 
which Capital One can develop reward schemes,

</p>

</p>
<p>change fees and products or make special offers 
to customers. In order to protect existing 
accounts against potential fraudulent card activi-
ties, expert real time neural network solutions 
are deployed to trigger the alarm at the earliest 
possible instant.
</p>
<p>Account Servicing and&nbsp;Call-Center 
</p>
<p>Technologies
</p>
<p>The call-center is supported by automated call 
dialers, power dialers, voice response units (VRU) 
and local systems integrated with voice solu-
tions. Many of the special systems for customer 
contact (cross-sales, balance transfer, retention 
and  correspondence activities) are specifically 
designed to support the IBS approach. The sys-
tem also stores information on customers&rsquo; tele-
phone numbers, which allows it to identify the 
origin of the call and route it to the most suitable 
associate. The sophisticated form of Computer 
Telephony Integration (CTI) ensures efficient cus-
tomer handling and provides high quality service. 
When customers call in, they can choose to talk 
to an associate or to use the VRU system. The 
VRU, which currently handles about 7500 calls 
every day, is used mainly for tasks such as balance 
enquiries.
</p>
<p>In addition to the development of solutions to 
the Operations and M&amp;A, IT also develops and 
maintains solutions in other departments of the 
company, such as the Finance or the HR depart-
ments. IT also develops the Internet system that 
allows customers to apply online, get real time 
information and manage their accounts. It also 
maintains the Intranet system, which provides 
accurate and accessible information to the com-
pany and functionality to all associates.
</p>
<p> Human Resources (HR)
</p>
<p>The HR function is critical to Capital One&rsquo;s CRM 
strategy. Finding and keeping top quality associ-
ates is vital to the company&rsquo;s success. HR is 
responsible for two main activities: managing 
associate selection and developing the company 
culture.
</p>
<p>Associate Selection
</p>
<p>Capital One considers the hiring process crucial 
and wants the selection process to be as science- 
driven as the overall customer strategy.
</p>
<p>Hiring and&nbsp;Training All associates are hired and 
evaluated based on the same criteria, which the 
company believes helps to prevent the formation 
of cliques. During the recruitment interviews, 
they test analytical and conceptual skills. The 
company also performs &laquo;behavior interviews&raquo; in 
order to access candidates&rsquo; competency by asking 
them to provide examples of situations where 
they supported change, managed several tasks or 
made difficult decisions. According to one 
recruiter: 
</p>
<p> &raquo; We do not hire for specific experience, but 
for competencies. We try to find the best fit 
</p>
<p>between a person and a role, and then train 
</p>
<p>them. For example, we have a systems testing 
</p>
<p>manager who used to test racing car engines 
</p>
<p>before joining us&nbsp;&ndash; he had no direct experi-
</p>
<p>ence, but certainly possessed all the compe-
</p>
<p>tencies we were looking for.
</p>
<p>Specific training, including some cultural 
induction, is offered for new &laquo;hires&raquo;. Managers at 
all levels are offered a range of performance and 
skill enhancement classes that are carried out by 
either in-house trainers or external organizations. 
There is also a learning center with books, vid-
eos and simulations, which are grouped around 
the core competencies that the company seeks 
to build. Career development is another impor-
tant aspect. Capital One has a highly structured 
people management process which include 360&deg; 
appraisals twice a year, personal Development 
Action Plans (DAP) to help employees pre-
pare for their next job and a weekly one-to-one 
10-min meeting between each associate and their 
manager to discuss key issues. In fact, the com-
pany won a Training Magazine award in 2001&nbsp;in 
the US and was featured as the &laquo;3rd Best Place to 
Work in the UK&raquo; in 2001 by The Sunday Times 
newspaper.
</p>
<p>Evaluation All associates are evaluated every 
6&nbsp; months. Half of the evaluation is based 
on targeted achievements and the other half 
based on Capital One&rsquo;s defined core compe-
tencies. Several categories are used to evaluate 
the competencies of call- centerassociates and 
team supervisors. Among the key elements are: 
communication, support of others, integrative 
decision-making, responsiveness to feedback 
</p>
<p> Chapter 4 &middot; Implementing the&nbsp;CRM Strategy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>71 4
</p>
<p>and coaching, taking ownership and job spe-
cific knowledge. Evaluation is taken very seri-
ously, and if metrics turn negative, managers 
spend time attempting to understand what went 
wrong. Says Mitch Beres: 
</p>
<p> &raquo; We see ourselves as coaches, rather than con-
trollers or discipliners, nurturing talent and 
</p>
<p>providing freedom. Even if our associates get 
</p>
<p>it wrong, good coaching should help them 
</p>
<p>improve&nbsp;&ndash; and we avoid getting the atrophy 
</p>
<p>that often exists in other organizations.
</p>
<p>Compensation Incentives are an important part 
of the compensation package for all Capital One 
associates. For example, front-line associates can 
achieve a bonus of up to 14%, based on their results 
and competencies. Senior managers are awarded 
share options as well as cash bonuses. On several 
occasions, since the company floated in 1994, 
options have been awarded to junior associates on a 
 one- off basis to share the feeling of ownership 
throughout the company. Also, a subsidized share 
purchase scheme allows all associates to purchase 
stock at a substantial discount on the market price. 
Take up is currently running at about 20%, and 
ownership behavior is very visible. According to one 
operations manager: 
</p>
<p> &raquo; People really watch the stock price&nbsp;&ndash; there 
is a refreshing clarity on the fact that what 
</p>
<p>we do affects the share price, and, since we 
</p>
<p>have share options, it makes a real difference 
</p>
<p>to us.
</p>
<p>Company Culture
</p>
<p>As Capital One searched for suitable premises to 
house its operations center in Nottingham, its main 
goal was to bring most activities in-house and 
under one roof, as well as creating a springboard for 
new products and businesses and a center for 
recruitment. Combining all operations in one main 
location would also have the advantage that new 
employees could be more easily integrated.
</p>
<p>Premises A place with the potential to meet 
these goals was found in a huge, 1950s&rsquo; building 
that matched not only Capital One&rsquo;s accommoda-
tion needs but also its culture of openness. They 
kept the two huge floor areas of 10,000&nbsp;m2 and a 
</p>
<p>smaller second floor of 2800&nbsp;m2. Call-center and 
professional areas are not differentiated, allowing 
flexibility in use and reinforcing the company&rsquo;s 
open business culture. The open-plan spaces, in 
which most associates work, are arranged in team 
configurations, while a few glass-fronted offices 
and meeting rooms are separated from the main 
areas. The building also has a convenience shop 
with refreshments, &laquo;relaxation rooms&raquo;, training 
rooms, a library and locker rooms with showers. 
Also, a large staff restaurant, with relaxed design 
elements, provides the feel of a trendy restaurant 
or bar.
</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the huge floors of the 
Capital One building is busy and professional, yet 
relaxed and colorful. The associates&rsquo; cubicles are 
personally decorated with photographs and nam-
etags, cuddly toys sit on almost every computer, 
inflatable palm trees stand in the corridor and 
remote-control air balloons fly through the room. 
On the computers, &laquo;Golden Nugget&raquo; stickers sig-
nify each sale of a priority product made by that 
associate. There are flipcharts showing how the 
different teams rank against one another. On the 
&laquo;Wall of Greatness&raquo;, associates who have received 
special company awards are shown alongside 
great people from American history, like Henry 
Ford, Thomas Edison and Muhammad Ali. As 
Scott Woolveridge, operations processing man-
ager, sees it: 
</p>
<p> &raquo; What you see reflected in our decoration is 
that we try to avoid being a manufacturing 
</p>
<p>shop. Our raw material is our people&nbsp;&ndash; so let 
</p>
<p>them be themselves and have an environ-
</p>
<p>ment to suit! If people are having fun, they 
</p>
<p>do a better job&nbsp;&ndash; that&rsquo;s why we give them all 
</p>
<p>these cuddly toys and stress balls. We want to 
</p>
<p>make people feel they belong to something. 
</p>
<p>And they do.
</p>
<p>Culture of&nbsp; Involvement Developing this strong 
culture of employee involvement was a conscious 
decision and part of the business plan. &laquo;If you do 
not treat the people who deal with customers as 
well as you want them to treat those customers 
then you are in trouble,&raquo; continues Woolveridge. 
&laquo;People on the front-line need to be empowered&nbsp;&ndash; 
they are the company as far as customers are con-
cerned. We try to take care of individual needs, so 
</p>
<p>4.4 &middot; Case Study: CRM at Capital One (United Kingdom)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>it is a natural step for this to be translated into 
customer treatment.&raquo;
</p>
<p>In line with its focus on associates, Capital 
One aims to create a culture of involvement and 
buy-in for all objectives. &laquo;We spend a lot of time 
explaining our objectives and ensuring that they 
are meaningful for everyone&nbsp;&ndash; where we are going 
and why&nbsp;&ndash; which is what creates a sense of excite-
ment, of ownership, of understanding why we are 
making certain trade-offs,&raquo; explains Paul Hawker, 
Collections Manager. Trips, simulations and 
training programs are some of the other tools that 
Capital One uses with its managers to ensure that 
objectives are aligned, and to create a common 
language and methodology. Managers estimate 
that they spend about 10% of their time on cre-
ative activities. They comment that it greatly helps 
them in decision-making, as they tend to &laquo;assume 
positive intent on the other side of any discussion 
and know that we are all trying to do the right 
thing.&raquo;
</p>
<p>The company conducts an associate survey 
twice a year, containing more than 100 questions 
to &laquo;help the company remold itself for the 
future&raquo; as one manager puts it. The survey com-
pletion rate is well over 90% and the data 
obtained are carefully analyzed by managers. 
While some questions evaluate overall work sat-
isfaction,  others request more specific detail 
such as quality of management communications 
and stress levels. Using regression analysis, 
Capital One identifies the key drivers of 
employee satisfaction and devises action plans 
to improve weaknesses and exploit the opportu-
nities identified.
</p>
<p>Capital One is considered as one of the UK&rsquo;s 
top employers in 2001, and employee satisfaction 
is extremely high: 97% of staff regard the com-
pany as a friendly place; 96% report that people 
are willing to give that bit extra to get the job 
done; and 66% (20% above the market average) 
believe that they are getting a fair share of com-
pany profits. Associate turnover is extremely 
low&nbsp;&ndash; the attrition rate at Capital One&rsquo;s call-center 
is around two thirds of the average figure of 35% 
at a standard call-center. In Capital One&rsquo;s non- 
call- center functions, turnover is even lower, and 
</p>
<p>there has been virtually no senior management 
turnover.
</p>
<p>Continuous Improvement Improvement sug-
gestions from front-line associates are highly 
encouraged. An example of an improvement 
suggestion made by call-center associates is the 
&laquo;APR indicator&raquo;. Call-center staff noticed that 
customers often wanted to discuss their APR, so 
IT and M&amp;A built in a quick access function that 
enabled them to view a customer&rsquo;s effective 
yearly APR without needing lengthy calcula-
tions. There are high levels of motivation and co-
operation for these initiatives. Those employees 
who contribute with particularly valuable ideas 
are given awards and highlighted on posters 
around the building. There is also a high degree 
of co-operation among the various departments 
in the improvement process. As one operations 
manager explains: 
</p>
<p> &raquo; Our business is all about IBS, change and 
innovation&nbsp;&ndash; that is true for every depart-

<p>ment involved, and it is very liberating that 
</p>
<p>there is no &lsquo;who&rsquo;s in charge&rsquo; debate. There is 
</p>
<p>an overall acceptance that we will change, 
</p>
<p>and that we will launch new products&nbsp;&ndash; some 
</p>
<p>will succeed, others will fail. We don&rsquo;t have

<p>4.4.5  Future Challenges
</p>
<p> Building a&nbsp;Deeper Understanding 
of&nbsp;Customer Needs
</p>
<p>While acknowledging the success of their 
approach, Capital One&rsquo;s Operations management 
is concerned with taking their understanding of 
customers and their behavior further. Today, 
Capital One knows which product a given cus-
tomer holds, which financial transactions they 
have made and what interactions with the com-
pany have taken place. However, the company 
still knows relatively little about the customer as 
an individual, which would enable a deeper 
</p>

<p/>

</p>
<p>understanding of their behavior and needs. 
Mitch Beres envisions the following: 
</p>
<p> &raquo; If we could identify why customers call, 
we could segment them according to their 
</p>
<p>needs&nbsp;&ndash; for example, if customer X calls 
</p>
<p>mainly to check his balance, then he could 
</p>
<p>immediately hear the message &lsquo;Mr. X, your 
</p>
<p>balance is&hellip; if you have more questions, 
</p>
<p>please press one.
</p>
<p>Increasingly, the company realizes that profit-
ability is not necessarily driven by product owner-
ship, but by customer characteristics (e.g., if they 
are working or studying, married or single, with 
or without children) and by product usage. 
Consequently, Capital One needs to ensure that it 
is able to address real customer needs at an indi-
vidual level.
</p>
<p> Managing Costs
</p>
<p>In terms of cost structure (e.g., cost-per-customer 
account), Capital One&rsquo;s costs are currently higher 
than those of most of its competitors. The company 
views its heavy investment in IT and people as justi-
fied, but also seeks to keep costs within limits. David 
Farlow, Director of Operations Strategy, comments: 
</p>
<p> &raquo; We don&rsquo;t need to be more costly than our com-
petitors. In fact, as IBS helps us to know our 
</p>
<p>customers and their needs better, we should 
</p>
<p>be well positioned to decide where to spend 
</p>
<p>our resources. However, we are not yet at the 
</p>
<p>part of the curve where increased spending on 
</p>
<p>IBS does not add incremental value.
</p>
<p>There is general agreement that associates are 
an expensive resource, and that they should be 
allocated to the highest value activities while 
lower value activities might be treated as a com-
modity, be outsourced, or at the limit, not ser-
viced. It is debatable to what extent VRUs and the 
Internet can decrease operational costs.
</p>
<p> Coordinating Channels
</p>
<p>Capital One clearly sees a challenge in coordi-
nating its customer interaction through all its 
different channels, which are currently coordi-
nated, yet not fully aligned. &laquo;As every contact 
</p>
<p>with the customer is precious, our next step 
will be to integrate our systems further so as to 
view customers through the same lens and align 
customer communications fully,&raquo; explains Mark 
Sanders, Sales Manager. Sanders also believes 
that the company has to work to avoid giving 
conflicting messages to customers. 
</p>
<p> &raquo; There is a clear degradation of responses 
when customers receive too many mailings, 
</p>
<p>and we have to avoid an uncoordinated situ-
</p>
<p>ation where Account Management contacts 
</p>
<p>a customer to raise their credit line and then 
</p>
<p>Sales contacts offer them a new product.
</p>
<p>The fact that additional communication chan-
nels, such as websites and e-mail now exist, and 
others might be established in the future, creates 
future challenges. As Sanders continues: 
</p>
<p> &raquo; Whenever we add a new channel, we witness 
an increase in demand also in the older chan-
</p>
<p>nels because of the need for explanation. For 
</p>
<p>example, customers telephone to make sure 
</p>
<p>their Internet payment was processed okay.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, when information comes from 
new sources or when it is more frequently pub-
lished, enquiries increase. For example, there are 
more customer enquiries now that balances are 
produced continuously on the Internet than when 
the traditional paper version was mailed once a 
month. Of course, this can be viewed either as a 
cost or an opportunity.
</p>
<p> ? Questions on Case Study: CRM at 
Capital&nbsp;One
</p>
<p> 1. If it is to become more than a concept, 
</p>
<p>CRM needs to be translated into specific 
</p>
<p>activities and processes. Based on the 
</p>
<p>case, what are key CRM activities and 
</p>
<p>processes of Capital One?
</p>
<p> 2. It is often claimed that CRM can create 
</p>
<p>competitive advantage. Does CRM create 
</p>
<p>competitive advantage for Capital One? If 
</p>
<p>so, how?
</p>
<p> 3. Reflecting on the CRM strategy and CRM 
</p>
<p>implementation of Capital One, which 
</p>
<p>areas for improvement do you see?

</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>The implementation of a CRM strategy is a 
</p>
<p>process of developing and executing a series 
</p>
<p>of small projects aimed at the business needs 
</p>
<p>and value proposition of customers. These 
</p>
<p>projects can be categorized as operational 
</p>
<p>projects, analytical projects, and application 
</p>
<p>projects. Operational projects build the infra-
</p>
<p>structure that enables companies to meet 
</p>
<p>the technical and functional requirements of 
</p>
<p>CRM.&nbsp;These include automation of functions, 
</p>
<p>setting up a customer database, information 
</p>
<p>delivery, and changing the process of data 
</p>
<p>collection. Analytical projects, by contrast, are 
</p>
<p>implemented to help a company understand 
</p>
<p>its customers using data analysis tools. This 
</p>
<p>is also called data analytics, and it combines 
</p>
<p>data-driven marketing and technology to 
</p>
<p>better understand customers. Data analytics 
</p>
<p>projects include customer data transforma-
</p>
<p>tion and customer knowledge discovery. 
</p>
<p>Customer data transformation consists of 
</p>
<p>pooling data from a number of sources to a 
</p>
<p>data warehouse and enhancing the data with 
</p>
<p>externally available information. Customer 
</p>
<p>knowledge discovery is the stage when the 
</p>
<p>data are analyzed using statistical tools and 
</p>
<p>the future is predicted based on analytical 
</p>
<p>results in order to enhance marketing deci-
</p>
<p>sion making. Building a complete customer 
</p>
<p>database incorporating all the relevant 
</p>
<p>customer information from different depart-
</p>
<p>ments and external sources is crucial for a suc-
</p>
<p>cessful analytical CRM project. This database 
</p>
<p>is the basis for the customer demographic 
</p>
<p>analysis, customer behavior modeling, and 
</p>
<p>customer value assessment. The application 
</p>
<p>projects deploy operational and analytical 
</p>
<p>outputs to increase revenue and profits by 
</p>
<p>improving marketing decisions and customer 
</p>
<p>relationships.
</p>
<p>Once the elements of the CRM strategy 
</p>
<p>and its implementation steps are identified, it 
</p>
<p>is important to calculate the ROI of CRM to see 
</p>
<p>whether the investment is worthwhile. In calcu-
</p>
<p>lating the ROI, care should be taken to identify 
</p>
<p>the costs and benefits from CRM initiatives as 
</p>
<p>well as the time period for assessing ROI.&nbsp;Three 
</p>
<p>main categories of CRM costs are IT costs, peo-
</p>
<p>ple costs, and process costs. The investments in 
</p>
<p>IT infrastructure, database development, and 
</p>
<p>software are the main components of IT costs, 
</p>
<p>and this may be usually one-fifth to one-third of 
</p>
<p>total costs. The costs involved in recruitment of 
</p>
<p>CRM talent and in redeployment and training of 
</p>
<p>both the existing and new employees consti-
</p>
<p>tute the people costs. Process costs include 
</p>
<p>investments in redesigning and reengineer-
</p>
<p>ing of existing work practices. It is difficult to 
</p>
<p>compute concrete CRM profits because (1) the 
</p>
<p>implementation takes 2&ndash;5&nbsp;years to complete, 
</p>
<p>during which the competitive environment 
</p>
<p>might have been changed, (2) some CRM costs 
</p>
<p>are necessary but do not generate revenue, and 
</p>
<p>(3) the change or performance improvement 
</p>
<p>cannot always be attributed to CRM investment. 
</p>
<p>However indirect benefits of CRM in terms of 
</p>
<p>lower customer acquisition costs, lower cost to 
</p>
<p>serve, higher customer satisfaction and reten-
</p>
<p>tion, and higher average customer value should 
</p>
<p>be considered in arriving at the benefits of CRM.
</p>
<p>Anecdotes of failed CRM projects are 
</p>
<p>plenty. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze 
</p>
<p>the reasons for failure and learn for future 
</p>
<p>initiatives. We provide 6 reasons frequently 
</p>
<p>mentioned both in practice and the aca-
</p>
<p>demic literature: (1) Assumption that CRM 
</p>
<p>is a software tool that manages customer 
</p>
<p>relationships for you, (2) implementing CRM 
</p>
<p>before having a CRM strategy, (3) poor match 
</p>
<p>between CRM system and organizational 
</p>
<p>processes, (4) resistance from employees, (5) 
</p>
<p>poor data quality, and (6) low &laquo;actionability&raquo; 
</p>
<p>of the information.
</p>
<p>The Capital One case study illustrates how 
</p>
<p>the company successfully implemented a 
</p>
<p>CRM strategy. Its business model was founded 
</p>
<p>on the crucial premise that each customer 
</p>
<p>requires a different product and service from 
</p>
<p>a credit card provider. Following this business 
</p>
<p>model, Capital One adopted an information-
</p>
<p>based strategy (IBS), which centers around 
</p>
<p>the idea of collecting customer information 
</p>
<p>and leveraging it to develop ideas, design 
</p>
<p>products, and select target customers. CRM 
</p>
<p>is viewed as a key strategic process in Capital 
</p>
<p>One, and different departments work in an 
</p>
<p>integrated fashion toward understanding 
</p>
<p>and satisfying customers and their needs. 
</p>
<p>For example, there is a partnership between

</p>
<p>Marketing and Analysis (M&amp;A) and Operations 
</p>
<p>to review the risk perspective of present 
</p>
<p>as well as future strategies. This strategic 
</p>
<p>approach to CRM has helped Capital One to 
</p>
<p>be seen as creating industry-best practices in 
</p>
<p>developing valuable customer relationships 
</p>
<p>and managing risk based on an intimate 
</p>
<p>understanding of the customer.
</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. In 1995, the British retailer Tesco 
</p>
<p>launched its &laquo;Clubcard&raquo; which was to 
</p>
<p>become one of the most important retail 
</p>
<p>innovations in the twentieth century 
</p>
<p>and built the foundation for Tesco&rsquo;s rise 
</p>
<p>to become one of the biggest retailers 
</p>
<p>in the world. However, 20&nbsp;years later, 
</p>
<p>the loyalty program has mutated into 
</p>
<p>giant with an estimated cost of &pound;500 
</p>
<p>million a year. Meanwhile, discounters 
</p>
<p>with the promise of &laquo;shopping made 
</p>
<p>simple&raquo; like Aldi and Lidl are booming in 
</p>
<p>the UK.&nbsp;Some analysts have already sug-
</p>
<p>gested abandoning the complex point-
</p>
<p>collection and redemption system. The 
</p>
<p>example shows that every implementa-
</p>
<p>tion of CRM has its time. The &laquo;Clubcard&raquo; 
</p>
<p>can be considered a success, but maybe 
</p>
<p>the twenty-first century requires a new 
</p>
<p>approach to managing retail relation-
</p>
<p>ships (Ruddick, 2014).
</p>
<p> 2. Tesco&rsquo;s up-market competitor Waitrose 
</p>
<p>on the other hand has radically simpli-
</p>
<p>fied its loyalty scheme offering direct 
</p>
<p>benefits like a cup of coffee or a news-
</p>
<p>paper instead of abstract bonus points. 
</p>
<p>The managing director of Waitrose, 
</p>
<p>Mark Price, even claims that points have 
</p>
<p>become &laquo;meaningless&raquo; to consumers. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the retailer has significantly 
</p>
<p>extended its portfolio by partnering with 
</p>
<p>dry-cleaning services or offering a click-
</p>
<p>and-collect service for purchases made 
</p>
<p>at partner retailers. Clearly, this aims 
</p>
<p>at creating a different kind of value for 
</p>
<p>customers&nbsp;&ndash; convenience and simplic-
</p>
<p>ity as opposed to price promotions and 
</p>
<p>complexity. This underscores the asser-
</p>
<p>tion of this chapter that managing cus-
</p>
<p>tomer relationships effectively requires 
</p>
<p>more than running a (complex) loyalty 
</p>
<p>scheme&nbsp;&ndash; it is rather about continuous 
</p>
<p>efforts to create value for the customers 
</p>
<p>(Medland, 2016).

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>Customer value management rests on the 
</p>
<p>idea of allocating resources differently to dif-
</p>
<p>ferent customers. The basis of this differential 
</p>
<p>resource allocation is the economic value of 
</p>
<p>the customer to the firm. Thus, before one can 
</p>
<p>start to manage customers, one must have a 
</p>
<p>thorough understanding of how to compute 
</p>
<p>the value contribution each customer makes 
</p>
<p>to a firm. Various economic concepts and 
</p>
<p>procedures have been developed that help 
</p>
<p>us to achieve this. Some are based on simple 
</p>
<p>notions, whereas others require the application 
</p>
<p>of mathematical techniques. But as a precursor 
</p>
<p>to understanding and applying these concepts, 
</p>
<p>it is necessary to define measures or metrics of 
</p>
<p>marketing activities and their outcomes. This 
</p>
<p>chapter reviews traditional marketing metrics 
</p>
<p>and introduces various primary customer-
</p>
<p>based metrics for acquisition and customer 
</p>
<p>activity measurement, before it explains some 
</p>
<p>popular customer-based metrics. The following 
</p>
<p>chapter will then introduce surrogate metrics 
</p>
<p>of customer value used in the industry.
</p>
<p>It is important at this stage to note the dif-
</p>
<p>ference between traditional marketing metrics 
</p>
<p>and customer-based metrics. Market share and 
</p>
<p>sales growth are popular traditional marketing 
</p>
<p>metrics normally computed for the geographi-
</p>
<p>cal area covered by a particular market. These 
</p>
<p>metrics were developed when individual cus-
</p>
<p>tomer data were hard or impossible to obtain 
</p>
<p>and therefore do not provide customer-level 
</p>
<p>insight into the market. However, over the 
</p>
<p>years, the increased availability of customer-
</p>
<p>level data has resulted in the development of 
</p>
<p>a new set of metrics that reflect the need to 
</p>
<p>evaluate managerial performance based on 
</p>
<p>the value each individual buyer brings to the 
</p>
<p>customer base of the firm. In order to arrive 
</p>
<p>at some measure of customer value, various 
</p>
<p>activities and their costs and returns need to 
</p>
<p>be recorded and assessed. We denote such 
</p>
<p>metrics primary customer based metrics which 
</p>
<p>can be further subdivided into customer acqui-
</p>
<p>sition metrics and customer activity metrics. 
</p>
<p>Acquisition rate and acquisition cost are two 
</p>
<p>primary metrics measuring the customer-level 
</p>
<p>success of marketing efforts aimed at acquiring 
</p>
<p>new customers. Specific metrics have also been 
</p>
<p>developed to track customer activities from 
</p>
<p>the point of their acquisition until they cease to 
</p>
<p>be customers. The customer activity measures 
</p>
<p>comprise average inter-purchase time, reten-
</p>
<p>tion rate, survival rate, probability of a customer 
</p>
<p>being active&mdash;P(Active)&mdash;and customer lifetime 
</p>
<p>duration. A third block of customer metrics 
</p>
<p>are popular customer-based metrics: Size of 
</p>
<p>wallet and share of wallet are popular metrics 
</p>
<p>firms frequently apply to evaluate a customer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>worth. In FMCG categories the share of category 
</p>
<p>requirement is a commonly used popular cus-
</p>
<p>tomer-based metric to track consumer loyalty.
</p>
<p>Thus, the various marketing metrics which 
</p>
<p>will be discussed in the course of this chapter 
</p>
<p>can be classified as follows (. Table&nbsp;5.1):

<p>5.1  Traditional Marketing Metrics
</p>
<p>Traditional marketing metrics have been used by 
marketing professionals for years and are helpful 
in measuring performance of brands, products, 
and firms in a given geographical region. These 
metrics were developed when individual cus-
tomer data were hard or impossible to obtain. 
Traditional marketing metrics provide informa-
tion about how products or brands perform in a 
market neglecting the individual customer-level. 
Historically, managerial rewards and incentives 
have been based on how well a manager is able to 
deliver on these metrics.
</p>
<p>5.1.1  Market Share
</p>
<p>Market Share (MS) is one of the most common 
metrics for measuring marketing performance. It 
is defined as the share of a firm&rsquo;s sales relative to 
the sales of all firms&mdash;across all customers in the 
given market. MS is an aggregate measure across 
customers. It can be calculated either on a mone-
tary or a volumetric basis.

available from internal records.
</p>
<p> 5 Denominator: Category sales are available 
from market research reports or from 
competitive intelligence.
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>MS is one of the most common measures of mar-
keting performance because it conveys an impor-
tant piece of information and is readily computed. 
It is a typical measure of a product-focused mar-
keting approach. However, it does not provide any 
information about how the sales are distributed 
across customers&mdash;it only gives an aggregate 
notion of category performance. For example, a 
</p>
<p>given MS can be caused by selling large amounts to 
a small percentage of the customer base or by mak-
ing small sales to a large proportion of the market.
</p>
<p>5.1.2  Sales Growth
</p>
<p>Sales growth of a brand, product, or a firm is a 
simple measure that compares the increase or 
decrease in sales volume or sales value in a given 
period to sales volume or value in the previous 
period. Hence, it is measured in percent. It indi-
cates the degree of improvement in the sales per-
formance between two or more time periods and 
acts as a flag for the management. A negative sales 
growth or sales growth lower than the rest of the 
market is normally a cause for concern.

<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>Sales growth is a quick indicator of the current 
health of a firm. If compared with the sales growth 
of the other players in the market, it also provides a 
relative measure of performance. However, it does 
not tell us which customers have grown and which 
ones have not. This information is necessary if we 
are to take customer-level marketing initiatives.
</p>
<p>5.2  Customer Acquisition Metrics
</p>
<p>One group of primary customer based metrics is 
customer acquisition metrics. The second are cus-
tomer activity metrics which are discussed in 
7 Sect. 5.3. Customer acquisition metrics have 
been receiving increased attention recently. 
Managers have become more sensitive toward

</p>

</p>
<p>balancing customer acquisition and customer 
retention activities. In order to evaluate customer 
acquisition activities, we use two simple con-
cepts&mdash;acquisition rate and acquisition cost.
</p>
<p>5.2.1  Acquisition Rate
</p>
<p>When firms attempt to acquire customers, they 
are typically targeting a specific group of pros-
pects. For example, a European credit card issuer 
might target the student market in Italy. In order 
to describe the success of the acquisition cam-
paign, a key performance indicator is the acquisi-
tion rate, i.e., the proportion of prospects 
converted to customers. It is calculated by divid-
ing the fraction of prospects acquired by the total 
number of prospects targeted.

</p>
<p>ggeted
 
</p>
<p>(5.3)
</p>
<p>For example, the target market of the credit card 
issuer might have been two million students in 
Italy. Acquisition was measured in terms of new 
credit cards issued. The bank issued a total of 
60,000 new credit cards. Thus, the acquisition rate 
was 100 * (60,000/2,000,000)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3%.
</p>
<p>The acquisition rate denotes an average proba-
bility of acquiring a customer from a population. 
Thus, the acquisition rate is always calculated for a 
group of customers (e.g., a segment), not for an 
individual customer. The equivalent measure for an 
individual is the acquisition probability. An acquisi-
tion rate for an individual customer does not exist.
</p>
<p> Defining What Acquisition Is
</p>
<p>Firms have different definitions for the term acqui-
sition. In the credit card example, an acquisition 
was recorded when a new credit card was issued to 
the prospect. However, it is possible that the pros-
pect signed up for the card only because she was 
interested in the promotional incentive and that 
she will never use the card. As a solution, the bank 
could define two different levels of acquisition&mdash;
for issuing the credit card and issuing a statement 
(which depends on credit card activity). For exam-
ple, although 60,000 credit cards have been issued 
to new customers, only 55,000 of them have 
received a statement, indicating activity on the 
</p>
<p>card account. Thus, the level 1 acquisition rate is 
3% and the level 2 acquisition rate is 2.75%.
</p>
<p>In noncontractual contexts, acquisition is 
typically defined as the first purchase or purchas-
ing in the first predefined period. For example, an 
outdoor direct-mail merchant received 110 first- 
time orders from a campaign based on a new 
mailing list of 5,000 prospects. Thus, the firm&rsquo;s 
acquisition rate is 2.2%.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that acquisition rates 
are typically computed on a campaign-by- 
campaign basis. Since acquisition rates can vary 
tremendously within the same firm, an average 
(firm-wide) acquisition rate is mostly of limited 
value.
</p>
<p> Where Does the&nbsp;Information Come 
from?
</p>
<p> 5 Numerator: Number of prospects acquired is 
determined from internal records.
</p>
<p> 5 Denominator: Number of prospects targeted 
can be available from internal records or has 
to be estimated from market research data 
(e.g., for television campaigns).
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>Acquisition rate gives a first indication of the suc-
cess of a marketing campaign by setting the num-
ber of new customers in relation to the number of 
targeted customers. However, it cannot be 
regarded in isolation. For example, it does not 
account for the costs of acquiring the customers. 
Other important factors that have an impact on 
the acquisition rate are the marketing strategy and 
the selection of target customers.
</p>
<p>5.2.2  Acquisition Cost
</p>
<p>The second key metric in customer acquisition is 
the acquisition cost (AC). The acquisition rate 
measures responsiveness to a campaign, but it 
does not say anything about the cost efficiency of 
a campaign. AC is defined as the acquisition cam-
paign spending divided by the number of acquired 
prospects. AC is measured in monetary terms.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>83 5
</p>
<p>For example, the cost of the acquisition cam-
paign of the Italian credit card issuer was $3 
million. Thus, the average cost of acquiring 
a single new customer for this campaign was 
$3,000,000/60,000&nbsp;=&nbsp;$50. Depending on the exact 
definition of what constitutes acquisition, the cost 
can be calculated for different acquisition levels.
</p>
<p> Delineating Acquisition Spending
</p>
<p>It is not difficult to identify acquisition spending in 
an organization that (1) acquires prospects in dis-
tinct campaigns and (2) is able to pinpoint its acqui-
sition efforts quite precisely to the prospect group. 
In this situation AC can be calculated with the high-
est accuracy. Any company targeting prospects 
through direct mail would fall into this category&mdash;it 
knows the precise target group and the acquisition 
spending directed toward that group. As soon as 
firms rely on broadcasted communication (e.g., 
advertising through television, social media, or 
print media) measurement of AC becomes less pre-
cise. For example, prospects can be persuaded by 
advertising that was originally not targeted at them 
but toward existing customers. Clearly, AC will 
seem lower if those customers enter the AC 
 calculation&mdash;making the numbers look more 
attractive than they really are. Also, firms might not 
necessarily differentiate between acquisition adver-
tising and retention advertising. Calculating the 
precise AC in such a case can become quite difficult.
</p>
<p> Where Does the&nbsp;Information Come 
from?
</p>
<p> 5 Both the numerator and denominator are 
available from internal records.
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>AC is a very important metric that firms should 
strive to continuously monitor as it indicates how 
effective a customer acquisition investment is.
</p>
<p>5.3  Customer Activity Metrics
</p>
<p>Once a prospect has been converted into a cus-
tomer, the main phase of the customer-firm 
relationship begins. The concept of measuring 
the activity status of this relationship deals with 
a very fundamental issue&mdash;whether a customer 
is a customer. On first sight, this might appear to 
be obvious. If a customer buys, then the customer 
is, in fact a customer&mdash;otherwise, they are not. 
</p>
<p>However, digging a little bit deeper, it seems that 
we are uncovering a quite complicated matter. It 
is not at all clear what constitutes a living rela-
tionship. What is more, the meaning of an active 
relationship differs across industries. Clearly, one 
has to look at more than just purchasing acts 
executed by a customer. Customers interact with 
the firm in multiple ways (pre-purchase inquiry, 
post- purchase service, complaints, etc.), all of 
which contribute to the entirety of the customer-
firm relationship. Even in a simple case such as 
grocery shopping where the purchase per se is 
of highest importance to both parties involved, a 
multitude of other nonpurchase interactions adds 
or detracts from the relationship quality (e.g., the 
interaction with service employees, the commu-
nication of the store toward the customer, and the 
shopping experience).
</p>
<p>Thus, it becomes clear that the customer-firm 
interaction comprises many more elements that 
may contribute to the essence of the relationship. 
In most cases, however, the sequence of purchase 
is used to define whether a relationship exists. 
However, even if one uses this simplification, 
there still is the issue of customer dormancy. 
Dormancy occurs when an ongoing relationship 
is disrupted temporarily during a period without 
any observable purchase activity. To state an 
example, this might occur naturally when some-
one loses her job and therefore is forced to scale 
down consumption. Once the person finds a new 
position, they are likely to return to the old con-
sumption pattern. Consequently, the person is 
not starting a new relationship but is continuing 
an existing relationship. (We admit this discus-
sion becomes complex when the period of dor-
mancy has been very long.)
</p>
<p>The challenge from a managerial point of view 
is to establish whether a seemingly dormant rela-
tionship has ended or the customer will return. In 
practice, this is a very tough call to make. 
Dormancy will or will not be considered, depend-
ing on the specific measure used to estimate cus-
tomer activity.
</p>
<p>5.3.1  Objective of&nbsp;Customer Activity 
Measurement
</p>
<p>The reason we want to shed light on customer 
activity measurement is twofold. First, knowing 
the status of a customer&rsquo;s (or a segment&rsquo;s) activity 
</p>
<p>5.3 &middot; Customer Activity Metrics</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>is important for managing marketing interven-
tions. A customer-oriented organization tries to 
align resource allocation with actual customer 
behavior. Instead of mass advertising or mass 
marketing, managerial action can gain tremen-
dous efficiency by adjusting its interventions to 
the actual customer needs or activity status. The 
second reason for measuring customer activity is 
because it is a key input in customer valuation 
models such as net-present value (NPV) models 
like the lifetime value. The marketing function 
has come under increasing pressure to demon-
strate how it adds to shareholder value. This dem-
onstration typically involves the estimation of the 
evolving customer value over time. Thus, measur-
ing customer activity is a critical intermediary 
step in this valuation process.
</p>
<p>This section covers the following types of cus-
tomer activity measures:
 1. Average inter-purchase time (AIT)
 2. Retention rate and defection rate
 3. Survival rate
 4. Lifetime duration
 5. P(Active)
</p>
<p>Each metric has a purpose with its own set of 
strengths and weaknesses. Thus, the task of the 
manager will be to find the most suitable metric 
for a given situation.
</p>
<p>5.3.2  Average Inter-Purchase Time
</p>
<p>Average Inter-Purchase Time (AIT) is the average 
time elapsing between purchases. It is measured 
in terms of specific time periods (days, weeks, 
months, etc.). It is computed by taking the inverse 
of the number of purchase incidences per time 
period.

<p>AIT is an easy-to-calculate indicator which can be 
an important statistic of the customer&rsquo;s activity 
status, especially for those industries where cus-
tomers buy on a frequent basis.
</p>
<p>5.3.3  Retention and&nbsp;Defection Rate
</p>
<p>Retention and defection are like two sides of the 
same coin. One can be inferred from the other, 
and, depending on the context, it is better to use 
one or the other metric. Retention rate in period t 
(Rr
</p>
<p>t
) is defined as the average likelihood that a 
</p>
<p>customer purchases from the focal firm in a 
period (t), given that this customer has also pur-
chased in the period before (t&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1). The defection 
rate is defined as the average likelihood that a cus-
tomer defects from the focal firm in a period (t), 
given that the customer was purchasing up to 
period (t&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1).

<p>The resulting retention rate refers to the average 
retention rate of a cohort or segment of custom-
ers. Theoretically, the retention rate differs for 
each individual customer but is approximated by 
the average retention rate of a (homogeneous) 
customer group or segment. Most of the time, 
no distinction is made between the (individual 
level) retention rate and the average retention 
rate.

<p>Average retention rate and average defection 
rate are directly related:

</p>
<p>Although we use the case of an average retention 
rate, one has to be aware that retention rates are 
typically not equal across different periods. For 
example, if one deals with a single cohort 
(wherein a cohort refers to a batch of customers 
acquired within a specified period of time), pro-
portionally fewer customers leave over time, thus 
forcing the average retention rate (for this 
cohort) to increase over time. One has to keep 
this in mind when extrapolating retention rates 
for one period to an entire time horizon for a 
cohort of customers.
</p>
<p>Assuming that the retention rate is constant 
over time (i.e., Rr
</p>
<p>t
&nbsp;=&nbsp;Rr for all t) allows a simple 
</p>
<p>calculation of the average lifetime duration.1

</p>
<p>How to assess lifetime duration in a more general 
setting will be discussed in 7 Sect. 5.3.5.
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>If the average customer lifetime duration of a 
</p>
<p>group of customers is 4&nbsp; years, then the average 
</p>
<p>retention rate is 1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;(1/4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.75, or 75% per year. 
</p>
<p>This means that on average, 75% of the customers 
</p>
<p>remain customers in the next period. If we look at 
</p>
<p>the effect for a cohort of customers over time (see 
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp;5.2) we find that from 100 customers who 
are acquired in year 1, about 32 remain at the end 
</p>
<p>of year 4.
</p>
<p>1 The terms lifetime duration, customer lifetime, and 
</p>
<p>customer tenure are often used interchangeably.
</p>
<p>Assuming constant retention rates, the number 
of retained customers in any arbitrary period 
(t&nbsp;+&nbsp;n) can simply be calculated using (5.9):
</p>
<p>#
</p>
<p>#
</p>
<p>of retained customers in period t n
</p>
<p>of acquired customers in
</p>
<p>co
</p>
<p>+( )
=
</p>
<p>hhort at time t Rr( )&acute;
 
</p>
<p>(5.9)
</p>
<p>Where
n&nbsp;=&nbsp;Number of periods elapsed
For the previous example, the number of 
</p>
<p>retained customers at the end of year 4 is 100 &times; 
0.754&nbsp;=&nbsp;31.64. If we plot the entire series of cus-
tomers who defect each period, we see the varia-
tion (or heterogeneity) around the average 
lifetime duration of 4&nbsp;years (see . Fig.&nbsp;5.1).
</p>
<p>Given an average retention rate of 75% (con-
stant over time), many customers leave in the 
early years. However, a small number of custom-
ers continue to stay for a long duration. This pat-
tern results in average lifetime duration of 4&nbsp;years.
</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the concepts of defec-
tion and retention are closely related. Defection 
rate is calculated as follows:
</p>
<p>Avg defection ratein t. % %( ) = - ( )100 Rrt  
(5.10)
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>The average retention rate in the previous exam-
</p>
<p>ple is 75%. Thus, the average defection rate is:
</p>
<p> 100 75 25- =% %.

from?

<p> 5 Internal records and customer tracking (e.g., 
loyalty card programs or contractual infor-
mation).
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>A key assumption of the retention rate concept is 
that once customers leave the relationship, they 
are gone forever. The concept of retention rate 
does not allow for temporary dormancies. 
Managers have to make a judgment whether the 
dormancy phenomenon plays a major or a minor 
role in their business. Using the retention rate is 
fine if it plays a minor role. If dormancy plays a 
major role, other concepts have to be used to 
assess customer activity. These concepts will be 
dealt with in 7 Sect. 5.4 and Summary.

</p>
<p> Is Retention Only about Buying?
</p>
<p>Typically, retention refers to the fact that a cus-
tomer continues to purchase goods or services 
from the company. This is not always the case.
</p>
<p>Take, for example, Google.com. Most of 
Google&rsquo;s services, such as basic email and Google 
calendar, or Google docs, are free. Although most 
of Google&rsquo;s customers do not have any transac-
tions in the traditional sense, one would consider 
site visits as the critical activity, which then would 
be used to measure retention for Google. Thus, in 
the case that the customer-firm relationship is not 
primarily about monetary transactions, it is 
important to define an appropriate basis in order 
to measure retention.
</p>
<p> How Is Retention Different 
from&nbsp;Loyalty?
</p>
<p>Retention is not the same as customer loyalty. 
Although retention is measured on a period-by- 
period basis and indicates whether customers are 
coming back, the loyalty construct has a much 
stronger theoretical meaning. If somebody is loyal 
toward a store or a brand, such as the Apple 
iPhone, for example, this person has a positive 
emotional or psychological disposition toward 
this brand. People might continue to purchase a 
particular brand or might patronize a particular 
store, but this may be purely out of convenience 
</p>
<p>or inertia. In this case, someone might be retained, 
but the person is not loyal (see 7 Chap. 10).
</p>
<p> Projecting Retention Rates
</p>
<p>Very often, we find ourselves in a situation where 
we would like to get an idea about future retention 
rates of a particular cohort of customers. To do so, 
we use information on past retention rates to 
make a prediction of future retention rates. We 
have already discussed that retention rates tend to 
increase over time. As short-term customers drop 
out, the retention rate of the remaining (loyal) 
customers increases necessarily. This increase, 
however, is not linear. Almost always, retention 
rates tend to increase at a decreasing rate.
</p>
<p>There is a simple method which allows us to 
forecast nonlinear retention rates&mdash;a simple expo-
nential form. This approach models the retention 
rate as a function of time.

</p>
<p>available. Clearly, a firm will not be able to retain 
all customers even if they spent unlimited adver-
tising on them. Rc is typically estimated through 
managerial judgment. The parameter r is the coef-
ficient of retention. This parameter determines 
how quickly retention rates converge over time 
to the retention ceiling. It can easily be estimated 
through spreadsheet analysis based on past reten-
tion data.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;5.2 shows actual retention rates for a 
credit card company (white bars). The time hori-
zon is 20 quarters. Equation 5.10 was applied with 
Rc&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.95, which means that managers believe 
that the maximum attainable retention rate is 
95%. The parameter r&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.2 is based on estimates 
that come from previous observations. Applying 
(5.10), the retention rates for periods 11&ndash;20 were 
estimated (grey bars). It can be seen that the 
method to approximate the actual retention rates 
was very close.
</p>
<p>If past estimates of the parameter r are not 
available, one can use another method. The reten-
tion rate Rr
</p>
<p>t
 is observed for a number of past peri-
</p>
<p>ods. Equation 5.10 can be regrouped to form (5.11):

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(5.12)
</p>
<p>For example, the known retention rate in period 9 
is 80%, while the one in period 10 is 82%. Thus, 
</p>
<p>the parameter r for period 9 is (1/9) &times; 
(ln(0.95)&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;ln(0.95&ndash;0.8))&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.205. The parameter r 
for period 10 is (1/10) &times; (ln(0.95)&nbsp; &minus;&nbsp; ln(0.95&ndash;
0.82)) 0.198. One can see that for both periods the 
parameter r is fairly close to the value 0.2.
</p>
<p>5.3.4  Survival Rate
</p>
<p>Another concept closely linked with retention and 
defection is survival. The survival rate (SR) indicates 
the proportion of customers who have survived (or, 
in other words, continued to remain as a customer) 
until a period t from the beginning of observing 
these customers. SR is measured for cohorts of cus-
tomers, wherein a cohort refers to a group of cus-
tomers acquired within a specified period of time.
</p>
<p>Although retention rate and defection rate 
provide information for a given period, the SR 
gives a summary measure of how many customers 
survived between the start of the formation of a 
cohort and any point in time afterward. SR at time 
t is equal to the product of the retention rate at 
time t and the SR during the immediately preced-
ing period (t&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1).

<p>CRM at Work 5.1
</p>
<p> Amazon: Acquisition and 
</p>
<p>Retention
</p>
<p>Amazon.com is one of the lead-
</p>
<p>ers in implementing customer 
</p>
<p>relationship management 
</p>
<p>programs on the Web and oper-
</p>
<p>ates with the vision of being the 
</p>
<p>most customer-centric company 
</p>
<p>offering everyone the possibil-
</p>
<p>ity of discovering anything they 
</p>
<p>might want to buy online. Because 
</p>
<p>of its unique and sophisticated 
</p>
<p>CRM program, the company has 
</p>
<p>constantly been able to drive both 
</p>
<p>customer acquisition and reten-
</p>
<p>tion. In 1999, 5&nbsp;years after the 
</p>
<p>company was founded, Amazon 
</p>
<p>acquired 11 million new custom-
</p>
<p>ers nearly tripling its number of 
</p>
<p>customers from 1998. Amazon 
</p>
<p>has been able to acquire and 
</p>
<p>retain customers at such a high 
</p>
<p>rate by striving to learn about its 
</p>
<p>customers and their needs, then 
</p>
<p>using this information to offer 
</p>
<p>them value-added features. This is 
</p>
<p>done via numerous technological 
</p>
<p>tools enabling the company to 
</p>
<p>learn. But its greatest success in 
</p>
<p>1998 was not adding customers, 
</p>
<p>but keeping those that it already 
</p>
<p>had. Repeat customers during 
</p>
<p>the year accounted for 71% of all 
</p>
<p>sales. Amazon has since grown 
</p>
<p>its membership numbers every 
</p>
<p>year, especially its Prime members, 
</p>
<p>which topped 63 million in 2016, 
</p>
<p>an increase of 43% from the previ-
</p>
<p>ous year. Prime members now 
</p>
<p>exceed the number of non-Prime 
</p>
<p>members with 52, and 70% of 
</p>
<p>wealthy American households 
</p>
<p>subscribe to Prime. Amazon also 
</p>
<p>saw notable increases of customer 
</p>
<p>usage with the launch of Prime 
</p>
<p>Day, which boasts deals similar to 
</p>
<p>Black Friday that are only available 
</p>
<p>to Prime members, providing 
</p>
<p>another incentive for custom-
</p>
<p>ers to sign up for Prime. Prime 
</p>
<p>memberships have been linked 
</p>
<p>to dramatic increases of spending 
</p>
<p>on Amazon, which comes with 
</p>
<p>additional benefits such as music, 
</p>
<p>movie and television streaming, 
</p>
<p>two-day free shipping and easy 
</p>
<p>use mobile purchasing apps.

<p> Where Does the&nbsp;Information Come 
from?
</p>
<p> 5 Similarly to retention rate, information comes 
from internal records and customer tracking 
(e.g., loyalty card programs or contractual 
information).
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>The SR is of great interest, because one can conve-
niently calculate the absolute number of survivors 
in a given period t. One simply multiplies the SR, 
by the cohort size in the beginning.
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>Number of customers starting at the beginning of 
</p>
<p>year 1 is 1,000.
</p>
<p>Computing the number of survivors:
</p>
<p>Number of survivors for period 1&nbsp; =&nbsp; Survival 
</p>
<p>rate for period
1
</p>
<p>* Number of customers at the beginning
</p>
<p>Therefore,
</p>
<p>Number of survivors for period 1&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.55 &times; 
</p>

<p>5.3.5  Lifetime Duration
</p>
<p>It is sometimes unclear how long a customer has 
been associated with a firm in a noncontractual 
setting, since there is no expiration date explicitly 
stated by the customer. In such situations, it is 
important to be able to predict the lifetime duration 
of a customer by observing buying patterns and 
other explanatory factors. Knowing for how long a 
customer remains a customer is a key ingredient in 
the calculation of the customer lifetime value&mdash;a key 
strategic metric. Furthermore, it has implications

</p>
<p>The calculation of average lifetime duration for 
the case that the retention rate remains constant over 
time has already been presented (see 7 Sect. 5.3.3). 
But since the retention rate usually changes over 
time (e.g., through customer self- selection) such a 
calculation would be misleading. We need to weigh 
in the number of survived periods. For one cohort 
of customer the avg. lifetime duration is defines as:

</p>
<p> Limitations
</p>
<p>If information is not complete, i.e., either the time 
of first purchase or the time of last purchase or 
both are unknown, the calculation of lifetime dura-
tion becomes more challenging. The case where 
either the time of first purchase, or the time of last 
purchase or both are unknown is illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;5.3. The information for buyer 1 is complete. 
The data for buyer 2 is left-censored, i.e., the start of 
the relationship is not recorded. Buyer 3&rsquo;s informa-
tion is right-censored. His relationship continued 
</p>
<p>beyond the end of the observation window. Thus, it 
is not known to the firm at t
</p>
<p>1
 how much longer the 
</p>
<p>customer will in fact be a customer. Finally Buyer 
4&rsquo;s relationship started before the observation 
window and ends after the observation window. 
This observation is called left- and right-censored. 
Data that consists of right- censored observations 
require the use of survival analysis techniques (e.g., 
retention rate, P(Alive)).
</p>
<p> Where Does the&nbsp;Information Come 
from?
</p>
<p> 5 Similarly to retention and SR, information 
comes from internal records and customer 
tracking (e.g., loyalty card programs or 
contractual information)
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>The average lifetime duration of a cohort of custom-
ers gives an indication of how fast the company needs 
to replace its customer base. When talking about 
the concept of a customer&rsquo;s lifetime duration, not 
all relationships are equal. We must take the type of 
product, which is subject to exchange into account. 
Here, we are specifying the following three cases:
 1. Contractual
 2. Noncontractual (or always-a- share)
 3. One-off purchases
</p>
<p>Contractual Relationships
</p>
<p>Contractual relationships are those where buyers 
engage in a specific commitment. This commitment 
may foresee duration and/or level of usage. A con-
tractual relationship that defines length and level of 
usage is, for example, an apartment rental lease or a 
magazine subscription. A contractual relationship, 
which defines only length, is, for example, a mobile 
phone contract. Finally, a contractual relationship

</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>which defines neither length nor usage level is a 
credit card. This category has also been labeled 
lost-for-good because a company loses the entire 
customer relationship once a client terminates the 
contract.
</p>
<p>Noncontractual Relationships
</p>
<p>Noncontractual relationships are those where buy-
ers do not commit in any way, either in duration 
or level of usage. Purchasing an item at a depart-
ment store, or with an airline, are examples. Since 
customers may use several suppliers at any given 
time (e.g., go to several different supermarkets), 
this category has been labeled  always-a- share.
</p>
<p>One-Off Purchases
</p>
<p>In case of One-off purchases there is no need to 
talk about a relationship between the exchange 
partners since it involves a once in a lifetime buy, 
such as a yacht or a vacation house.
</p>
<p>5.3.6  P(Active)
</p>
<p>In a noncontractual case, given a particular cus-
tomer, it may be useful to know whether the 
customer is likely to transact in a particular time 
period. In other words we would like to know the 
probability of that customer being active in time t, 
P(Active). A simple approach for computing the 
probability of being active, P(Active), is via the fol-
lowing formula (Schmittlein &amp; Morrison, 1985):
</p>
<p>P Active
n( ) = t
</p>
<p> 
(5.15)
</p>
<p>Where
n&nbsp;=&nbsp;the number of purchases in a given period
τ&nbsp;=&nbsp;the time of the last purchase (expressed as 
</p>
<p>a fraction of the observation period)
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>To compute the P(Active) of each of the two cus-
</p>
<p>tomers in the twelfth month of activity, where 
</p>
<p>customer A bought four times within the first 8 
</p>
<p>out of the observed 12&nbsp; months and customer B 
</p>
<p>bought only two times within the first 8 out of the 
</p>
<p>last 12&nbsp;months (see . Fig.&nbsp;5.4).
</p>
<p>Thus for Customer A: τ
A
</p>
<p>&nbsp;=&nbsp; (8/12)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.6667 and 
n
</p>
<p>A
&nbsp;=&nbsp;4
P(Active)
</p>
<p>A
&nbsp;=&nbsp;(0.6667)4&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.197
</p>
<p>And for Customer B: τ 
B
&nbsp;=&nbsp;(8/12)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.6667 and 
</p>
<p>n
B
&nbsp;=&nbsp;2
</p>
<p>P(Active)
B
&nbsp;=&nbsp;(0.6667)2&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.444
</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe that a customer 
who has bought four times in the first 8&nbsp;months 
but has not bought in the last 4&nbsp; months has a 
lower probability of buying in the 12&nbsp;month over 
a customer who has bought only twice in the same 
window of 8&nbsp;months. This is due to the assump-
tion that customers do not change the frequency 
of buying. For an advanced application of further 
methods of calculating P(Active) see Reinartz and 
Kumar (2000, 2002).
</p>
<p> Where Does the&nbsp;Information Come 
from?
</p>
<p> 5 Information comes from customer tracking, 
e.g., loyalty card programs.
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>The probability of a customer being active in 
time t is a function of the duration since the 
last purchase and applicable in non-contrac-
tual cases. When calculating P(Active) it is 
assumed that customers pertain to their usual 
purchase patterns with respect to the frequency 
of buying.

</p>
<p>5.3.7  Comprehensive Example 
of&nbsp;Customer Activity Measures
</p>
<p>Looking at an actual retention pattern of a direct 
marketing firm, we want to illustrate the concepts 
of retention rate, defection rate, SR, and lifetime 
duration. A cohort of 7500 customers was acquired 
at the outset of the analysis. . Table&nbsp;5.4 shows the 
actual retention pattern for ten periods in column 
2. For example, after period 1, only 32% of the cus-
tomers are retained into the second period. Thus, 
this company has a rather high defection rate. If 
we are at the end of period 10 and want to make an 
assessment of future retention rates, we need to 
make a customer activity forecast.
</p>
<p>Column 3 shows the predicted retention pat-
tern, based on (5.11) (p.&nbsp; 13). The underlying 
retention rate ceiling (Rc) for the example is 0.80, 
and the coefficient of retention (r) is 0.5 (esti-
mated from past company data). Thus, retention 
rates approximate the maximum rate already at 
</p>
<p>period 10. This means that after period 10, the 
company retains approximately 80% of its cus-
tomer base from period to period. The defection 
rate in column 4 is simply calculated as (1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;reten-
tion rate). Finally, the SR, calculated with (5.12), 
indicates the proportion of the original cohort 
that survives until period t. For example, only 
1.2% of the original cohort survives until period 
11. If the SR is multiplied by the original cohort 
size&mdash;in this case, 7,500&mdash;we obtain the number 
of customers surviving up to period t (column 6).
</p>
<p>Another important measure which can be 
derived from the information is that of lifetime 
duration. A simple approach (as illustrated in (5.8), 
p.&nbsp; 11) would be to calculate the mean lifetime 
duration from the average retention rate. The aver-
age retention rate across the 15 periods (column 2 
and 3) is 71.8%, which results in an average life-
time duration of 3.54 periods. Since the retention 
rates change over time, we would have to compute 
an appropriate measure of average retention in

<p>order to compute average lifetime duration. More 
specifically, since many more customers are sub-
ject to a lower retention rate in the early periods as 
compared to higher retention rates in later peri-
ods, using a simple average of retention rates 1&ndash;15 
would be misleading. In the computation of an 
average retention rate, the number of survived 
periods needs to be weighed accordingly (see 
(5.14), p.&nbsp;17). The result of the weighing process is 
shown in column 7. Intuitively, it is the number of 
active customer periods for every period. For 
example, at the end of period 1 we have 2,400 
(2,400 customers &times; 1 period) active periods, at the 
end of period 2 we have 2,357 (1,178 customers &times; 
2 periods) active periods, and so on. If we add all 
active periods 1&ndash;15 and divide by the initial cohort 
size of 7,500, the average lifetime duration is 2.89 
periods (=21,648/7,500). Thus, the company needs 
to replace its customer base every 3 periods, and 
not every 3.5 periods, as indicated before.
</p>
<p>5.4  Popular Customer-Based  
Value Metrics
</p>
<p>Firms have adopted some popular surrogate mea-
sures of customer value which they anticipate to 
be reasonable indicators of the actual customer 
value. These metrics assist firms in prioritizing 
their customers in a manner that helps them 
assign a higher proportion of resources to the cus-
tomers who they expect will generate greater 
profits in the future. We suggest managers attempt 
to correlate these surrogate measures on a selec-
tive basis with more rigorous customer value met-
rics. Only if these correlations yield satisfactory 
results (i.e., correlations are substantial) can and 
should the surrogate measures be used for deci-
sion making.
</p>
<p>5.4.1  Size of&nbsp;Wallet
</p>
<p>Size of wallet is the amount of a buyer&rsquo;s total spend-
ing in a given category&mdash;or, stated differently, the 
category sales of all firms to that customer. The size 
of wallet is measured in monetary terms.

<p>Example
</p>
<p>A consumer might spend an average of $400 
</p>
<p>every month on groceries, across several super-
</p>
<p>markets. Thus, her size of wallet is $400.
</p>
<p> Where Does the&nbsp;Information Come 
from?
</p>
<p>Information about the size of wallet can be gath-
ered in many ways. For existing customers, the 
information can be collected through primary 
market research (e.g., surveys). A typical question 
a firm might ask is, &laquo;On average, how much do 
you spend every month on category A?&raquo; For pros-
pects, it is quite difficult to obtain the size-of- 
wallet information on an individual level. Instead, 
segment-level information is often used.
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>Size of wallet is a critical measure of the customer- 
centric organization. When firms attempt to 
establish and maintain profitable relationships, 
the customer&rsquo;s buying potential (i.e., size of wal-
let) is a critical piece of information. Firms are 
particularly interested in acquiring and retaining 
customers with large wallet sizes. The assumption 
firms make here is that large wallet customers will 
bring in more revenues and profits.
</p>
<p>5.4.2  Share of&nbsp;Category 
Requirement
</p>
<p>Share of Category Requirement (SCR) is defined as 
the proportion of category volume accounted for by 
a brand or focal firm within its base of buyers. This 
metric is often computed as an aggregate level met-
ric, when individual purchase data are unavailable.
</p>
<p>On an aggregate level the SCR is calculated as 
follows:

<p>Example
</p>
<p>In this example, there are three customers in the 
</p>
<p>category. The category consists of three brands&mdash;
</p>
<p>SAMA, SOMO, and SUMU. . Table&nbsp;5.5 shows the 
number of purchases during a 3-month period.
</p>
<p>The category volume in the 3-month period is 
24&nbsp; units. Brand SAMA has a MS of 33% (i.e., 8 
purchases out of a total of 24) and an aSCR of 
42.1% (i.e., 8 purchases out of 19, made by its two 
buyers). This example shows that even though 
SAMA&rsquo;s MS is already substantial, its aSCR is even 
higher. The high aSCR for SAMA indicates that 
once consumers have purchased this brand, they 
tend to prefer it disproportionately more than its 
two competitors.
</p>
<p>The aSCR ratio is sometimes calculated simply 
by using purchase occasions or product units as 
the unit of analysis. The computation discussed 
here is for the aggregated case. aSCR can also be 
calculated for individual customers.
</p>
<p> Individual Share of&nbsp;Category 
Requirement (iSCR)
</p>
<p>At the individual level, when such data are available, 
iSCR is computed by dividing the volume of sales 
(V) of the focal firm to a particular customer by the 
total category volume she buys. The metric thus 
indicates how much of the category requirements 
the focal firm satisfies of an individual  customer.

<p> Where Does the&nbsp;Information Come 
from?
</p>
<p> 5 Numerator: Volumetric sales of the focal firm 
are readily available from internal records.
</p>
<p> 5 Denominator: The total volumetric purchases 
of the focal firm&rsquo;s buyer base are typically 
obtained through market and distribution 
panels, which are quite common for certain 
industries (e.g., fast-moving consumer goods 
[FMCG]). Other industries use mainly 
primary market research (surveys). Since this 
information is costly to gather, it is typically 
collected for a representative sample and then 
extrapolated to the entire buyer base. 
Qualitative managerial judgment is another 
potential low-cost alternative.
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>The aggregate level SCR (aSCR) is a general indica-
tor of loyalty for a specific firm (or brand), whereas 
the individual level SCR (iSCR) is a measure of the 
importance of a particular firm (or brand) for a 
single customer. SCR is one of the most commonly 
accepted measures of customer loyalty, at least for 
FMCG categories. It separates the question, 
&laquo;whether anyone buys the brand&raquo; from the ques-
tion, &laquo;how much they buy.&raquo; An important charac-
teristic of this measure is that it controls for the 
total volume of the segments/individuals category 
requirements. In other words, regardless of the 
total value of purchases per period, in terms of 
percentage of allocated purchases (loyalty), it puts 
all customers on the same metric. However, this 
metric does not necessarily indicate whether a 
high iSCR customer will generate substantial rev-
enues or profits&mdash;this is only achieved by knowing 
something about the size of wallet of this customer.
</p>
<p>5.4.3  Share of&nbsp;Wallet
</p>
<p>Share of Wallet (SW) is defined as the proportion 
of category value accounted for by a focal brand 
or a focal firm within its base of buyers. It can be 
measured at the individual customer level or at 
</p>
<p>an aggregate level (e.g., segment level or entire 
customer base).
</p>
<p> Individual Share of&nbsp;Wallet (iSW)
</p>
<p>Individual Share of Wallet (iSW) is defined as the 
proportion of category value accounted for by a 
focal brand or a focal firm for a buyer from all 
brands she purchases in that category. It indicates 
the degree to which a customer satisfies her needs in 
the category with a focal brand or firm. It is com-
puted by dividing the value of sales (S) of the focal 
firm (j0) to a buyer i in a category by the size of wal-
let of the same customer in a predefined time period.

<p> Aggregate Share of&nbsp;Wallet (aSW) 
(Brand or Firm Level)
</p>
<p>Aggregate share of wallet (aSW) is defined as the 
proportion of category value accounted for by a 
focal brand or a focal firm within its entire base of 
buyers. It indicates the degree to which the cus-
tomers of a focal firm satisfy their needs on aver-
age, in a category with a focal firm.

<p>Example (Continued)
</p>
<p>Publix may calculate its aSW, using (5.20). The 
</p>
<p>aSW is Publix&rsquo;s sales (value) in period t ($750,000) 
</p>
<p>divided by the total grocery expenditures of 
</p>
<p>Publix&rsquo;s customers in the same period 
</p>
<p>($1,250,000); thus, 750,000/1,250,000&nbsp;=&nbsp;60%.
</p>
<p> Where Does the&nbsp;Information Come 
from?
</p>
<p> 5 Numerator: Typically, sales information 
comes from internal records. In case of the 
iSW that information has to be available on 
the individual customer level.
</p>
<p> 5 Denominator: Sales value across all firms 
comes from primary market research 
(surveys), administered to individual 
customers. Since this information is costly to 
gather, it is often collected for a representative 
sample and then extrapolated to the entire 
buyer base. Sometimes, firms can infer the 
size, of wallet for a certain product, especially 
in certain business-to-business (B-to-B) 
contexts. For example, BASF, one of the few 
manufacturers of car paint, supplies its 
product to Mercedes- Benz. Based on its 
knowledge of how much paint it takes to 
paint an average sized car, it can infer 
Mercedes-Benz&rsquo;s size of wallet for car paint 
based on its worldwide production output&mdash;a 
figure easily derived from  secondary sources.
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>Just like SCR, SW is a measure of customer loyalty 
and can be an important metric. The main differ-
ence is the focus on sales volume (SCR) and the 
focus on sales value (SW). The iSW sheds light on 
how important the firm is for an individual cus-
tomer in terms of his expenditures in the category. 
The aSW indicates how important (value wise) a 
specific firm is for its customer base in terms of their 
expenditures in the category. However, SW is unable 
to provide a clear indication of future revenues and 
profits that can be expected from a customer.
</p>
<p> When to&nbsp;Use SCR and&nbsp;When to&nbsp;Use SW
</p>
<p>Information on SW is slightly more difficult to 
obtain than for SCR.&nbsp; SCR is, in most cases, the 
preferred measure. This is particularly true for 
</p>
<p>categories where the variance of customer expen-
ditures is relatively small (groceries, for example). 
If purchases are similar in volume, a customer&rsquo;s 
lifetime value is primarily driven by his frequency 
of purchases. Thus, SCR is a fairly appropriate 
measure of loyalty. However, if the variance of 
consumer expenditures is relatively high (furni-
ture, cars, or other infrequent purchases), then 
SW is a better measure of loyalty than SCR.&nbsp;In the 
former case, the frequency is more easily remem-
bered. In the latter case, the customer more easily 
remembers the expenditures.
</p>
<p> Share of&nbsp;Wallet and&nbsp;Size of&nbsp;Wallet 
Hold Important Pieces of&nbsp;Information
</p>
<p>Even though two buyers might have the same SW, 
firms might find their attractiveness as customers 
to be different as illustrated in . Table&nbsp;5.7.
</p>
<p>Depending on the size of wallet, the absolute 
attractiveness of buyer 1 is eight times higher, 
even though the SW is the same as for buyer 2. 
The example shows it is always important to con-
sider SW and size of wallet simultaneously.
</p>
<p>The matrix presented in . Fig.&nbsp; 5.5 illustrates 
this and shows the recommended strategies for the 
various segments. The firm makes optimal resource 
allocation decisions only by segmenting the cus-
tomers along both dimensions simultaneously.
</p>
<p> Difference of&nbsp;Share of&nbsp;Wallet 
to&nbsp;Market Share
</p>
<p>It is important to recognize the difference between 
market share (MS) and share of wallet (SW). MS 
is calculated across buyers and non-buyers, 
whereas SW is calculated only among actual buy-
ers. The MS of a firm is the SW across all its cus-
tomers in the category divided by the sales across 
all firms in the category in period t.

</p>
<p>0.15, or 15%. The implication here is that 
</p>
<p>although Publix has an overall low MS, it has a 
</p>
<p>high SW for those consumers buying at Publix. 
</p>
<p>This indicates that Publix is a niche player with a 
</p>
<p>very loyal clientele.
</p>
<p>5.4.4  Transition Matrix
</p>
<p>All of the previously discussed metrics describe 
only the current state and make no prediction 
about the future development. A simple idea to 
forecast SCR or SW is to use a transition matrix. A 
transition matrix is a convenient way to 
 characterize a customer&rsquo;s likelihood to buy over 
time or a brand&rsquo;s likelihood to be bought. The 
assumption is that a customer moves over her life-
time through various stages of activity. . Table&nbsp;5.8 
shows such a transition matrix.
</p>
<p>In . Table&nbsp;5.8, the top row indicates the move-
ments for customers who are currently brand A 
</p>
<p>buyers; 70% of them will buy brand A next time, 
20% will buy brand B, and 10% will buy brand 
C.&nbsp;The diagonals (in bold) are customer-retention 
probabilities computed by the company. However, 
we see that consumers can switch back and forth 
from brands. For example, the probability that a 
consumer of brand A will transition to brand B 
and then come back to brand A in the next two 
purchase occasions is 20 * 10%&nbsp;=&nbsp;2%. If, on aver-
age, a customer purchases twice per period, the 
two purchases could be AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, 
CA, CB, or CC.&nbsp;We can compute the probability 
of each of these outcomes. This process can be 
continued for as many purchase occasions as 
desired. Information for the matrix may come 
from routine surveys, with questions such as, 
&laquo;Which hotel did you stay in last time?&raquo; or &laquo;The 
next time you stay in a hotel, what is the probabil-
ity that you will stay at each of the hotels that you 
consider as options?&raquo;

</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>Since customer value management involves 
</p>
<p>allocating resources differently for individual 
</p>
<p>customers based on their economic value, 
</p>
<p>understanding value contribution from each 
</p>
<p>of the customers to the firm is very important. 
</p>
<p>In the absence of individual customer data, 
</p>
<p>companies have relied on traditional marketing 
</p>
<p>metrics such as market share and sales growth. 
</p>
<p>Market share (MS) is defined as the share of a 
</p>
<p>firm&rsquo;s sales relative to the sales of all firms&mdash;
</p>
<p>across all customers in the given market. It only 
</p>
<p>gives an aggregate notion of category per-
</p>
<p>formance, but does not give any information 
</p>
<p>about how the sales are distributed among 
</p>
<p>customers. Sales growth provides a relative 
</p>
<p>measure of performance but fails to indicate 
</p>
<p>which customers contributed more and which 
</p>
<p>contributed less.
</p>
<p>The availability of customer-level data helps 
</p>
<p>firms utilize a new set of metrics which enables 
</p>
<p>the assignment of value to each individual 
</p>
<p>customer. These so-called primary customer-
</p>
<p>based metrics can be subdivided into customer 
</p>
<p>acquisition metrics and customer activity met-
</p>
<p>rics. Customer acquisition metrics measure the 
</p>
<p>customer level success of marketing efforts to 
</p>
<p>acquire new customers. Two important metrics 
</p>
<p>are the acquisition rate and acquisition cost 
</p>
<p>(AC). Acquisition rate is the proportion of pros-
</p>
<p>pects converted to customers, and acquisition 
</p>
<p>cost is the campaign spending per acquired 
</p>
<p>customer. Customer activity metrics, by con-
</p>
<p>trast, serve to track customer activities after

<p> Catalina is Changing Supermarket 
</p>
<p>Shopper Measure&nbsp;ment
</p>
<p>Catalina Inc. is a Florida-based com-
</p>
<p>pany specializing in supermarket 
</p>
<p>shopper tracking and coupon issu-
</p>
<p>ing. The company has about 1,200 
</p>
<p>employees and operates in the 
</p>
<p>United States, as well as in major 
</p>
<p>European countries. The company 
</p>
<p>built its business model on issu-
</p>
<p>ing coupons to grocery shoppers 
</p>
<p>online when they check out. The 
</p>
<p>basis for this business model is 
</p>
<p>that traditional print media has 
</p>
<p>long production lead times, and 
</p>
<p>the response to these media is 
</p>
<p>not measurable on the individual 
</p>
<p>customer level. Thus, supermarkets 
</p>
<p>and manufacturers cannot run and 
</p>
<p>track individualized campaigns with 
</p>
<p>traditional media. Catalina&rsquo;s system 
</p>
<p>consists of a printer connected 
</p>
<p>to the cashier&rsquo;s scanner and a 
</p>
<p>database. The information on each 
</p>
<p>shopping basket that checks out 
</p>
<p>via the scanner is then stored in the 
</p>
<p>database. Using the person&rsquo;s credit 
</p>
<p>card number or check number, the 
</p>
<p>database links individual shopping 
</p>
<p>baskets over time. If the person 
</p>
<p>pays cash, the system cannot link 
</p>
<p>the basket. The system then allows 
</p>
<p>both manufacturers and retailers to 
</p>
<p>run individualized campaigns based 
</p>
<p>on the information in the database. 
</p>
<p>For example, Catalina could partner 
</p>
<p>with the retailer to improve its 
</p>
<p>cross-selling. A typical issue for any 
</p>
<p>given retailer is that certain custom-
</p>
<p>ers use the store as their primary 
</p>
<p>shopping location, whereas others 
</p>
<p>use it as their secondary store. To 
</p>
<p>improve the SW with the latter 
</p>
<p>group of customers, Catalina first 
</p>
<p>investigates basket composition 
</p>
<p>of the various buyers. It then finds 
</p>
<p>that certain buyers buy, for example 
</p>
<p>baby or children products (thus, 
</p>
<p>there is apparently a family behind 
</p>
<p>this shopping bask), yet the num-
</p>
<p>ber of calories in that basket does 
</p>
<p>not match that of an average family. 
</p>
<p>One explanation for this might be 
</p>
<p>that this shopper uses this outlet 
</p>
<p>as a secondary store. Given this 
</p>
<p>interpretation, the decision then is 
</p>
<p>to allocate to this customer a gift of 
</p>
<p>say $10, for shopping for 4&nbsp;weeks 
</p>
<p>in a row spending at least $40 per 
</p>
<p>week in the store. The goal is to 
</p>
<p>selectively target those shoppers of 
</p>
<p>whom the store captures only a low 
</p>
<p>SW, and to entice them to change 
</p>
<p>their behavior.
</p>
<p> ? Questions on Minicase 5.1
 1. Explain whether Catalina&rsquo;s approach to 
</p>
<p>storing customer buyer information and 
</p>
<p>using it to target shoppers who visit the 
</p>
<p>store as a secondary location is a good 
</p>
<p>business practice. Do you think this 
</p>
<p>helps the store build customer 
</p>
<p>retention?
</p>
<p> 2. Discuss the role of traditional metrics 
</p>
<p>(such as market share) in this new CRM 
</p>
<p>environment. Should they be discarded?
</p>
<p> 3. Do you think Catalina&rsquo;s legal practice of 
</p>
<p>targeting shoppers based on past buying 
</p>
<p>behaviors is ethically acceptable? Discuss 
</p>
<p>from the perspective of both, the 
</p>
<p>customer and the store owner.

<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. Idea Cellular, a leading mobile phone 
</p>
<p>operator in India, measures the quality of 
</p>
<p>their subscribers against three key metrics&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>how active are the subscribers (as reflected 
</p>
<p>by the Visitor Location Register (VLR) 
</p>
<p>database maintained by the Telecom 
</p>
<p>Regulatory Authority of India), how many 
</p>
<p>users prefer Idea Cellular over competition, 
</p>
<p>and the average revenue per user (ARPU) 
</p>
<p>from its subscriber base (Idea Cellular, 2015).
</p>
<p>the acquisition stage. Some critical customer 
</p>
<p>activity metrics are average inter- purchase time 
</p>
<p>(AIT), retention rate, survival rate (SR), customer 
</p>
<p>lifetime duration, and probability of a customer 
</p>
<p>being active, P(Active). These are important 
</p>
<p>inputs for the calculation of customer value 
</p>
<p>and for aligning resource allocation with cus-
</p>
<p>tomers&rsquo; behavior. AIT is defined as the average 
</p>
<p>time elapsed between purchases. The reten-
</p>
<p>tion rate is the average likelihood a customer 
</p>
<p>purchases from the focal firm in a period (t), 
</p>
<p>given this customer has purchased in the last 
</p>
<p>period (t&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1). The defection rate expresses 
</p>
<p>the average likelihood a customer defects 
</p>
<p>from the focal firm in a period (t), given the 
</p>
<p>customer was purchasing up to period (t&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1). 
</p>
<p>The survival rate (SR) is another preliminary 
</p>
<p>customer metric, and indicates the proportion 
</p>
<p>of customers that have &laquo;survived&raquo; (or, in other 
</p>
<p>words, continued to remain as a customer) until 
</p>
<p>a period t from the beginning of the relation-
</p>
<p>ship with these customers. SR is closely linked 
</p>
<p>with retention rate. SR is a summary measure 
</p>
<p>of how many customers survived between the 
</p>
<p>start of the formation of a cohort and any point 
</p>
<p>in time afterward, while retention rate reflects 
</p>
<p>retention in a given period only. The SR can be 
</p>
<p>measured as the product of the retention rate 
</p>
<p>at time t and the SR during the immediately 
</p>
<p>preceding period (t&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1). Lifetime duration is 
</p>
<p>a key strategic metric in the calculation of the 
</p>
<p>customer lifetime value. The calculation of 
</p>
<p>lifetime duration is different in contractual and 
</p>
<p>noncontractual situations. In a contractual case, 
</p>
<p>this is the time from the start of the relationship 
</p>
<p>until the end of the relationship. However, in a 
</p>
<p>noncontractual situation, firms are interested 
</p>
<p>in the likelihood the customer is active at a 
</p>
<p>given point in time. If the likelihood is below 
</p>
<p>a threshold value, the customer is considered 
</p>
<p>inactive. An estimation of whether a customer 
</p>
<p>is active is given by P(Active). A simple formula 
</p>
<p>for P(Active) is P(Active)&nbsp;=&nbsp;Tn, where n is the 
</p>
<p>number of purchases in a given period and T 
</p>
<p>is the time of the last purchase expressed as a 
</p>
<p>fraction of the observation period.
</p>
<p>Firms use different surrogate measures of 
</p>
<p>customer value to prioritize their customers 
</p>
<p>and to differentially invest in them. Popular 
</p>
<p>customer- based metrics comprise size of 
</p>
<p>wallet, share of category requirement, and 
</p>
<p>share of wallet. Size of wallet is the buyer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>total spending in a category and usually firms 
</p>
<p>are interested in acquiring and retaining 
</p>
<p>customers with large wallet sizes. (Aggregate) 
</p>
<p>Share of category requirement (aSCR) is an 
</p>
<p>aggregate level measure of the proportion 
</p>
<p>of the category volume accounted for by a 
</p>
<p>brand or a focal firm. SCR is one of the most 
</p>
<p>commonly accepted measures of customer 
</p>
<p>loyalty for FMCG categories. On an individual 
</p>
<p>level the iSCR indicates how much of the 
</p>
<p>category requirement of an individual a firm 
</p>
<p>satisfies. Although this is an overall indicator 
</p>
<p>of customer loyalty, it does not necessarily 
</p>
<p>indicate whether a high iSCR customer will 
</p>
<p>generate substantial revenues or profits, for 
</p>
<p>which the knowledge about the customer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>size of wallet is necessary. Share of wallet (SW) 
</p>
<p>is the proportion of category value accounted 
</p>
<p>for by a focal brand or firm within its base of 
</p>
<p>buyers. At an individual level, iSW is defined as 
</p>
<p>the proportion of category value accounted 
</p>
<p>for by a focal brand or firm for a buyer. It indi-
</p>
<p>cates the degree to which a customer satisfies 
</p>
<p>her needs in the category with a focal brand 
</p>
<p>or firm. Firms can use the information about 
</p>
<p>size of wallet and share of wallet together for 
</p>
<p>optimal allocation of resources. To forecast the 
</p>
<p>SCR or SW a transition matrix can be used. The 
</p>
<p>transition matrix provides us with the prob-
</p>
<p>ability a customer will purchase a particular 
</p>
<p>brand if we know which brand she purchased 
</p>
<p>previously.

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we examined some 
</p>
<p>traditional marketing metrics, various 
</p>
<p>primary customer-based metrics, and 
</p>
<p>explained some popular customer-based 
</p>
<p>value metrics used in industry. Some of the 
</p>
<p>primary customer-based metrics introduced 
</p>
<p>earlier form the inputs to derive customer 
</p>
<p>value&nbsp;&ndash; the key metric that drives decision 
</p>
<p>making in the age of data-based marketing.
</p>
<p>This chapter proceeds to conceptualize 
</p>
<p>strategic metrics of customer value and 
</p>
<p>introduces popular customer selection 
</p>
<p>strategies and techniques to evaluate these 
</p>
<p>strategies. Strategic customer-based metrics 
</p>
<p>such as recency, frequency, monetary value 
</p>
<p>(RFM), past customer value, lifetime value 
</p>
<p>metrics, and the customer equity are forward 
</p>
<p>looking measures. RFM value is a frequently 
</p>
<p>used metric to predict, e.g., purchase 
</p>
<p>behavior. The past customer value (PCV) 
</p>
<p>assumes that the results of past transactions 
</p>
<p>are an indicator of the customer&rsquo;s future 
</p>
<p>contributions. Evaluating the long-term 
</p>
<p>economic value of a customer to the firm is 
</p>
<p>the goal of lifetime value metrics, which also 
</p>
<p>form the basis for the calculation of the 
</p>
<p>customer equity.
</p>
<p>In addition to these metrics, some 
</p>
<p>customer selection strategies are explained 
</p>
<p>in 7 Sect. 6.2. These techniques help firms 
identify the right customers in order to 
</p>
<p>optimally allocate the available marketing 
</p>
<p>resources. The chapter introduces three 
</p>
<p>popular customer selection strategies: 
</p>
<p>profiling, binary decision trees, and logistic 
</p>
<p>regression. Finally, 7 Sect. 6.3 discusses 
methods, such as misclassification rates and 
</p>
<p>lift analysis, which companies can use to 
</p>
<p>evaluate alternative selection strategies.
</p>
<p>An overview of the metrics and methods 
</p>
<p>discussed in this chapter is given in 
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp;6.1.
</p>
<p>6.1  Strategic Customer-Based 
Value Metrics
</p>
<p>Strategic customer based value metrics are for-
ward looking and aim to guide company decisions 
with the goal to maximize long-term profitability 
</p>
<p>of the customer base. In particular we will intro-
duce recency, frequency, and monetary value 
(RFM), past customer value, the lifetime value of 
a customer, and customer equity.
</p>
<p>6.1.1  RFM Value
</p>
<p>RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary 
value. This technique utilizes these three metrics 
to evaluate customer behavior and customer value 
and is often used in practice.
 1. Recency: A measure of how long it has been 
</p>
<p>since a customer last placed an order with the 
company.
</p>
<p> 2. Frequency: A measure of how often a 
customer orders from the company in a 
certain defined period.
</p>
<p> 3. Monetary value: The amount that a customer 
spends on an average transaction.
</p>
<p>The general idea of RFM is to classify customers 
based on their RFM measure. The resulting 
groups of customers are associated with purchase 
behavior, e.g., likelihood to respond to a market-
ing campaign. RFM is similar to the transition 
matrix approach in that it also tracks customer

<p>behavior over time in what is called a state-space. 
That is, customers move over time through space 
with certain defined activity states.
</p>
<p> RFM Method
</p>
<p>For the following discussions about RFM coding, 
consider the example of a firm with a customer 
base of 400,000 customers. From this customer 
base, a sample of 40,000 customers is chosen. In 
other words, every tenth customer from the larger 
database of 400,000 customers was picked in order 
to form a test group of 40,000 customers who are 
representative of the whole customer base.
</p>
<p>Also, assume this firm is planning to send a 
marketing mailer campaign of a $150 discount 
coupon to be mailed to its customers.1
</p>
<p>Recency Coding
</p>
<p>Assume this firm sends its $150 mailer campaign 
to the 40,000 customers in the test group, and 
assume that 808 customers (2.02% of 40,000) 
responded. In order to determine if there is any 
correlation between those customers who 
responded to the mailer campaign and their cor-
responding historical recency, the following anal-
ysis is done.
</p>
<p>The test group of 40,000 customers is sorted in 
descending order based on the criterion of most 
recent purchase date. The earliest purchasers are 
</p>
<p>1 All numerical figures mentioned in the discussions 
</p>
<p>below are hypothetical data created for instructional 
</p>
<p>purposes only. However, due care has been exercised 
</p>
<p>to ensure these data are fairly close to real life 
</p>
<p>experiences of many firms.
</p>
<p>listed on the top and the oldest are listed at the 
bottom. The sorted data are further divided into 
five groups of equal size (20% in each group). The 
top-most group is assigned a recency code of 1, 
the next group is assigned a code of 2, and so on, 
until the bottom-most group is assigned a code of 
5. An analysis of the customer response data from 
the mailer campaign and the recency-based 
grouping point out that the mailer campaign 
received the highest response from those custom-
ers grouped in recency code 1, followed by those 
grouped in code 2, and so on. . Figure&nbsp;6.1 depicts 
the distribution of relative frequencies of custom-
ers who responded across the recency groups 
coded 1 through 5. The highest response rate 
(4.5%) for the campaign was from those custom-
ers in the test group who had the highest recency 
quintile (recency code&nbsp;=&nbsp;1). Note the average cus-
tomer response rate computed for all five groups 
would be none other than the actual response rate 
of 2.02% achieved by the campaign, i.e., (4.50%&nbsp;+&nbsp;
2.80%&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.50%&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.05%&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.25%)/5&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.02%.
</p>
<p>At the end of this recency coding exercise we 
would assign recency values of r&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 through 5 for 
groups of customers, depending on the quintile 
that they belong to.
</p>
<p>Frequency Coding
</p>
<p>The frequency coding process is the same as the 
recency coding process just discussed. However, 
to sort the test group of 40,000 customers based 
on the frequency metric, we need to know the 
average number of purchases made by a customer 
per month. Of course, the choice of the appropri-
ate time period depends on the usual frequency of

<p>purchases (e.g., weeks, months, quarters, years, 
etc.). In this case, customers with the highest 
number of purchases per month are grouped at 
the top, while those with lower number of pur-
chases per month were listed below. Here again, 
the sorted list is grouped into five quintiles. Those 
in the top are assigned a code of 1 and those at the 
bottom a code of 5. The response rate of each of 
the frequency-based sorted quintiles is depicted 
in . Fig.&nbsp;6.2.
</p>
<p>An analysis of the customer response data 
from the mailer campaign and the frequency- 
based grouping show that the mailer campaign 
received the highest response rate from those cus-
tomers grouped in frequency code 1, followed by 
those grouped in code 2 (2.22%), and so on.
</p>
<p>At the end of the frequency coding we would 
assign frequency values of f&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 though 5 for groups 
of customers in the five frequency quintiles.
</p>
<p>Monetary Value Coding
</p>
<p>The monetary value coding process is exactly 
the same as the recency and frequency coding 
processes. However, to sort the test group of 
40,000 customers based on the monetary value 
metric, we need to know the average amount 
purchased per month. As with recency and fre-
quency, the customer data are sorted, grouped, 
and coded 1 to 5.
</p>
<p>As can be seen in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.3 the highest 
response rate (2.35%) for the campaign was from 
those customers in the test group who had the

<p>highest monetary value quintile (monetary value 
code&nbsp; =&nbsp; 1). Thus, indicating that the monetary 
value is also an important metric for the analysis 
of customer behavior.
</p>
<p>At the end of this monetary value coding exer-
cise, we would assign a monetary value of m&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 
through 5 for groups of customers, depending on 
the quintile that they fall within.
</p>
<p>After performing the three steps (R, F, and M) 
you will have individual R, F, and M scores for 
each customer. Each customer will be assigned to 
one of the 125 groups such as 111, 233, 432, &hellip;, 
555, based on her respective RFM code. An over-
view of the RFM procedure is given in . Fig.&nbsp;6.4.
</p>
<p> Limitations
</p>
<p>This method independently links customer 
response data with R, F, and M values and then 
groups customers belonging to specific RFM 
codes. However, this method may not produce 
an equal number of customers under each RFM 
cell. This is because the individual metrics R, F, 
and M are likely to be correlated. For example, 
someone spending more (high M) is also likely, 
on average, to buy more frequently (high F). 
However, for practical purposes, it is desirable to 
have exactly the same number of individuals in 
each RFM cell. A sorting technique ensuring 
equal numbers in each RFM cell is described as 
follows.
</p>
<p> RFM Cell Sorting Technique
</p>
<p>An alternative approach to applying RFM sequen-
tially to the initial dataset is the RFM cell sorting. 
This is a more sophisticated sorting technique 
which helps to arrive at an RFM code for each cus-
tomer and ensures the grouping of an equal num-
ber of customers under each RFM code. . Figure&nbsp;6.5 
depicts a schematic diagram of the logic behind 
RFM cell sorting. Consider the list of 40,000 test 
group customers. The list is first sorted for recency 
and grouped into five equal groups of 8000 custom-
ers. Therefore group 1 will have 8000 customers, 
and so will the other groups through group 5. Now, 
take the 8000 customers in each group and sort 
them based on frequency and divide them into five 
equal groups of 1600 each. At the end of this stage, 
you will have RF codes starting from 11 through 55, 
with each group having 1600 customers. In the last 
stage, each of the RF groups is further sorted based 
on monetary value and divided into five equal 
groups of 320 customers each. Again, we will have 
RFM codes starting from 111 through 555, each 
having 320 customers. Considering each RFM code 
as a cell, we will have 125 cells (5 recency divisions * 
5 frequency divisions * 5 monetary value divi-
sions&nbsp;=&nbsp;125 RFM codes).

<p>necessary to determine a cutoff point for the mar-
keting campaign. This cutoff point should be 
based on the profitability of the customer. The 
breakeven value (BE) provides a simple to calcu-
late metric for this purpose. In marketing litera-
ture breakeven refers to the fact that the net profit 
from a marketing promotion equals the cost asso-
ciated with conducting the promotion. The BE is 
defined as
</p>
<p>BE
unit cost price
</p>
<p>unit net profit
=
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(6.1)
</p>
<p>If this ratio for a particular promotion is 1, then 
the promotion only broke even and did not gener-
ate any net profits. This ratio also computes the 
minimum response rates required in order to off-
set the promotional costs involved and thereby 
not incur any losses. Thus, we also refer to the BE 
as the breakeven response rate.
</p>
<p>Example (Continued)
</p>
<p>Consider the example of mailing $150 discount 
</p>
<p>coupons. Suppose the cost to mail each piece is a 
</p>
<p>dollar, and the net profit (after all costs) is $45, then 
</p>
<p>the breakeven value or breakeven response rate 
</p>
<p>required can be computed as BE&nbsp;=&nbsp;$1/$45&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0222, 
</p>
<p>or 2.22%. This value can be computed and then 
</p>
<p>can be compared with the actual response rate of 
</p>
<p>each RFM cell.
</p>
<p>To simplify comparison, the breakeven response 
rate just computed could be used in computing a 
breakeven index (BEI) for every RFM cell. The BEI 
is calculated using the following formula.
</p>
<p>BEI
Actual response rate BE
</p>
<p>BE
=
</p>
<p>-( )&aelig;
&egrave;
&ccedil;
</p>
<p>&ouml;
</p>
<p>&oslash;
&divide;
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(6.2)
</p>
<p>A positive BEI value indicates that some profit 
was made from the transaction. A BEI value of 0 
indicates that the transaction just broke even, and 
a negative BEI value indicates that the transaction 
resulted in a loss.
</p>
<p>Example (Continued)
</p>
<p>Therefore, in the above example, if the actual 
</p>
<p>response rate of a particular RFM cell was 3.5%, 
</p>
<p>then BEI&nbsp;=&nbsp;([3.5%&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2.22%]/2.22%) &times; 100&nbsp;=&nbsp;57.66.
</p>

</p>
<p>the groups of customers the marketing campaign 
should target, and all those RFM cells with corre-
sponding negative BEI values are those customers 
to be avoided for this promotion.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that of the 125 cells, 
only customers within 56 cells have a higher 
chance of offering profitability to the firm, and the 
rest do not! Therefore, it becomes clear that a firm 
can achieve significant savings by only focusing 
on potentially profitable customers and not tar-
geting the rest.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 6.6 plots the RFM cell codes and 
their corresponding BEI values. Customers with 
positive BEI values are to be chosen and the rest 
are to be left unconsidered. Note that customers 
with higher RFM values tend to have higher BEI 
values. However, at the same time, customers 
with a lower recency value but relatively higher F 
and M values also tend to have positive BEI val-
ues and hence should be considered for target 
mailing.
</p>
<p> Order of&nbsp;Importance of&nbsp;R, F, and&nbsp;M
</p>
<p>Most often businesses use the RFM technique in 
the order of recency, frequency, and monetary 
value. However, the order varies for different indus-
try segments. Although the RFM order is normally 
acceptable, a more accurate order of coding would 
depend on the rapidity the customer response rate 
drops. The metric (R, F, or M) for which the cus-
tomer response rates declines more quickly is likely 
to be the best predictor of future customer response 
and, hence, should be coded first. Once the metric 
of highest influence is determined, the same 
method of measurement can be used to determine 
the order of the remaining metrics.
</p>
<p>Referring to . Figs.&nbsp;6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 it should 
be noticed that customer response rate drops 
more rapidly for the recency metric than the other 
two metrics. Similarly, the customer response rate 
for the frequency metric drops more rapidly than 
the monetary value metric. Therefore, the order of 
R, F, and M holds good in this case.

<p>Example (Continued)
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp;6.3 compares the profits made by targeting 
all customers vs. using RFM to target selected cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. It is clear the firm will benefit significantly 
</p>
<p>more by sending the mailers to select customers 
</p>
<p>within selected RFM cells, than by sending it to their 
</p>
<p>entire customer base. The loss of $3640 incurred in 
</p>
<p>conducting the test is offset by the profits generated 
</p>
<p>by sending mailers to the RFM select customers.
</p>
<p> Relative Importance of&nbsp;R, F, and&nbsp;M
</p>
<p>In the simplest case the RFM values are assigned 
for each customer by sequential sorting based on 
the RFM metrics. However, there is an alternative 
method which uses regression techniques to com-
</p>
<p>pute the relative weights of the R, F, and M met-
rics, and these relative weights are used to 
compute the cumulative points of each customer. 
The pre-computed weights for R, F, and M, based 
on a test sample, are used to assign RFM scores to 
each customer (see Appendix II). The higher the 
computed score, the more profitable the customer 
is likely to be in the future. This method, unlike 
the earlier one, is more flexible and can be tailored 
to each business situation.

<p>tomer transactions is as follows:
</p>
<p>Recency = 5 ,  Frequency = 2 ,  Monetary = 3
</p>
<p>The resulting cumulative scores, 249 for John, 112 
for Smith, and 308 for Mags, indicate a potential 
</p>
<p>preference for Mags. In this case, John seems to be 
a good prospect as well, but mailing to Smith 
might be a misdirected marketing effort. This 
example illustrates a simple application of the 
RFM technique. In practice, however, the number 
of customers to be analyzed can run into millions. 
Regression techniques are often employed to 
arrive at the relative weights for RFM.&nbsp; See 
Appendix II for an overview of a regression scor-
ing model.

<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>The RFM technique helps organizations signifi-
cantly, not only in identifying and targeting valu-
able customers who have a very high chance of 
purchasing, but also in avoiding costly communi-
cations and campaigns to customers who have a 
lower probability of purchasing. Instead it helps to 
identify only those customers with high probabil-
ities of purchase and to target the companies&rsquo; 
marketing strategies and communications accord-
ingly. A limitation is that the RFM technique can 
be applied only on historical customer data avail-
able and not on prospects data.
</p>
<p>6.1.2  Past Customer Value
</p>
<p>Past customer value (PCV) is a metric which 
assumes the results of past transactions are an 
indicator of the customer&rsquo;s future contributions. 
The value of a customer is determined based on 
the total contribution (toward profits) provided 
by the customer in the past. This modeling tech-
nique assumes that the past performance of the 
customer indicates the future level of profitability. 
Since products or services are bought at different 
points in time during the customer&rsquo;s lifetime, all 
transactions must be adjusted for the time value

<p>keting efforts. The underlying assumption is that 
the past contribution of a customer is a good pre-
dictor of her future contributions. The customers 
with higher values are normally those deserving 
greater marketing resources. This method, while 
extremely useful, does not incorporate other 
information which could help refine the process 
of selecting profitable customers. For instance, it 
does not consider whether a customer is going to 
be active in the future. It also does not incorporate 
the expected cost of maintaining the customer in 
the future. Concluding, it is still a backward- 
looking metric.
</p>
<p>6.1.3  Lifetime Value Metrics
</p>
<p>Evaluating the long-term economic value of a 
customer to the firm has seen a dramatic rise in 
interest. This is a direct outcome of the shift from 
transactional marketing to relational marketing. 
If a manager wants to evaluate marketing resource 
allocation plans targeted at improving the long- 
term value of customers, corresponding control 
measures must be put in place. Looking at profits 
</p>
<p>on a per-transaction basis is not sufficient. 
Managers want to have an idea how the value of a 
client has evolved over time. The general term 
used to describe the long-term economic value of 
a customer is lifetime value (LTV), also referred 
to as the customer lifetime value (CLV). In very 
simple terms, it is a multi period evaluation of a 
customer&rsquo;s value to the firm in net present value. 
However, the term LTV is not without controver-
sies. Although it is the Holy Grail for some, others 
call it &laquo;an elaborate fiction of presumed preci-
sion&raquo; (Jackson, 1992). In the following section we 
present some of the most common ways to calcu-
late LTV.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the reader should be aware 
that there are many specific formulations.2 It is 
important to present the principle in such a man-
ner that readers can adapt the calculation to their 
own requirements. Conceptually, the principle of 
calculating LTV is represented in . Fig.&nbsp;6.7.
</p>
<p>As one can easily see, there is not a single way 
to arrive at each component. For example, are the 
recurring costs comprised only of direct product

<p>costs or also marketing, sales and service costs? 
Depending on many factors, such as nature of 
product, data availability and statistical capabili-
ties, the inputs for the LTV calculation change. Is 
this problematic? It is not. First and foremost, it is 
important to understand the principle. Based on 
the general principle, one can then start to adjust 
the calculation to the available data. Also, one 
needs to adapt the formulation to the industry 
and company context. For example, having a 
defined finite lifetime duration (as for a contrac-
tual relationship such as cable subscription) 
makes for a different formulation as having a non- 
finite relationship (as for a noncontractual rela-
tionship such as buying from a supermarket).
</p>
<p>After discussing the basic formulations, we 
will highlight key issues that should be considered 
when employing the models. In the following dis-
cussion, we will present different formulations of 
the same principle.
</p>
<p> Basic LTV Model
</p>
<p>In the most simple definition, the lifetime value of 
an individual customer i is the sum of her dis-
counted gross contribution over the respective 
observation horizon T.

LTV
</p>
<p>i
&nbsp; =&nbsp; lifetime value of an individual cus-
</p>
<p>tomer i in net present value at time t&nbsp;=&nbsp;0
The resulting LTV is a measure of a single cus-
</p>
<p>tomer&rsquo;s worth to the firm. The gross contribution 
(GC) may vary, of course, across customers and 
across time. This formulation is primarily used for 
pedagogical and conceptual purposes. It is typi-
cally based on past customer behavior and may 
have limited diagnostic value for future decision 
making.
</p>
<p>Cautionary note: If the time unit is different 
from a yearly basis, the interest rate δ needs to be 
adjusted accordingly. For example, if the yearly 
interest rate is 15%, the quarterly interest rate is 
3.56%.
</p>
<p> LTV with&nbsp;Splitted Revenues and&nbsp;Costs
</p>
<p>On the next level, one can break down the gross 
contribution into its constituting elements.

The cost element in this example is broken 
</p>
<p>down into direct product-related costs and mar-
keting costs. Depending on data availability, it can 
be enhanced by including service-related cost, 
delivery cost, or other relevant cost elements.
</p>
<p> LTV Including Customer Retention 
Probabilities
</p>
<p>So far, an assumption was that all customers 
under investigation remain fully active during the 
period of interest. However, in reality, more and 
more customers stop their relationship with the 
firm over time. The next step is therefore to con-
sider customer retention probabilities. This relates 
to the fact that customers tend to remain in the 
relationship only with a certain probability 
approximated by the average retention rate Rr. 
Also, the AC is now subtracted from the custom-
er&rsquo;s value.

<p>Under the assumption that.

<p>(6.8)
</p>
<p>We call the term
</p>
<p>Rr
</p>
<p>Rr1- +d
</p>
<p>the margin multiplier.
This formulation is easy applicable for quick 
</p>
<p>calculations and, unless the retention rate is very 
high, produces results very close to the more pre-
cise formulation. One only needs to multiply the 
GC with the margin multiplier (Rr/[1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;Rr&nbsp;+&nbsp;δ]) 
and subtract the acquisition cost.
</p>
<p> How Long is Lifetime Duration?
</p>
<p>The word lifetime must, in many circumstances, 
be taken with a grain of salt. Although the term 
makes little sense with one-off purchases (say, for 
example, a house), it also seems strange to talk 
about LTV of a grocery shopper. Clearly, there is 
an actual lifetime value of a grocery shopper. 
However, given the long time span, this actual 
value is not practical. For all practical purposes, 
</p>
<p>the lifetime duration is a longer-term duration 
used managerially (see 7 Sect. 5.4.4). For exam-
ple, in a direct marketing general merchandise 
context, managers do not look beyond a 4-year 
time span. Beyond that, any calculation and pre-
diction may become difficult due to so many 
uncontrollable factors (e.g., the customer moves, 
new competitors enter the market, and so on). It is 
therefore important to make an educated judg-
ment regarding a sensible duration horizon in the 
context of making decisions.
</p>
<p> Incorporating Externalities in&nbsp;the&nbsp;LTV
</p>
<p>The value a customer provides to a firm does not 
only consist of the revenue stream that results 
from her purchases of goods and services. In the 
era of modern telecommunication technology 
and the rapid growth of online social communi-
ties (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), product rating web-
sites, and weblogs, the passing on of personal 
opinions about a product or brand can contribute 
substantially to the lifetime value of a customer. 
Examples are customer referrals that result in 
new customer acquisitions or the posting of neg-
ative product reviews that detract potential cus-
tomers from buying a product. We subsume all 
these activities under the term word-of-mouth 
(WOM).
</p>
<p> Measuring and&nbsp;Incorporating WOM
</p>
<p>A first step at measuring WOM is to look at its 
effects on revenues and expenses. It can be 
expected that WOM has a direct effect on new 
customer acquisitions through reducing (or in 
case of negative WOM increasing) the AC.&nbsp; To 
incorporate the value of WOM in the LTV calcu-
lation we need to determine the savings in AC per 
customer due to a referral (AC savings: ACS) and 
the number of new customer acquisitions (n
</p>
<p>i
) that 
</p>
<p>arise due to the referrals of customer i.

Equation 6.9 accounts for the fact that there 
</p>
<p>are opinion leaders who have a stronger influence 
on their peers and the differences in the size of the 
social network of customers through an individ-
ual level n
</p>
<p>it
. The downside is that this number is 
</p>
<p>difficult to obtain. Surveys and questionnaires 
may be used but are costly, time consuming, and 
often not reliable. Instead network centrality met-
rics such as degree centrality or betweenness can 
help to approximate the number of referrals.3 Still, 
it neglects the differences in GC of the customers 
that were acquired through referrals.
</p>
<p> Alternative Ways to&nbsp;Account 
for&nbsp;Externalities
</p>
<p>The situation becomes even more complex, when 
acknowledging that WOM not only reduces AC 
but also impacts the purchase frequency, purchase 
volume, and cross-buying and thus the LTV of the 
customer that was acquired because of a referral. 
A major problem is to whom to account the addi-
tional value of a customer j if his GC rises due to 
WOM by customer i. To avoid this question, the 
value of a customer&rsquo;s referrals can be separated 
from the LTV, for example by calculating a sepa-
rate customer referral value (CRV) for each cus-
tomer. A joined evaluation of both metrics helps 
the management to select and determine how to 
develop its customers (see . Table&nbsp;6.9). A separate 
calculation of a CRV from the LTV also allows 
acknowledging for the fact that the customers you 
acquire due to referrals have different GC.4
</p>
<p> How to&nbsp;Spur Positive Referrals
</p>
<p>WOM agent campaigns, viral marketing, opinion 
leader programs, or referral reward programs are 
activities that companies can initiate to encourage 
</p>
<p>3 For a discussion of degree centrality and between-
</p>
<p>ness see for example Lee, Catte, and Noseworthy 
</p>
<p>(2010) or Kiss and Bichler (2008).
</p>
<p>4 Further illustrations and a practical application of the 
</p>
<p>concept of CRV can be found in Kumar, Peterson, and 
</p>
<p>Leone (2007).
</p>
<p>its customers to make more referrals. But compa-
nies need to bear in mind that investments in these 
initiatives can only pay off if customers are satisfied 
with the product or service offering encountered.
</p>
<p> Where Does the&nbsp;Information Come 
from?
</p>
<p>The information on GC, sales, direct cost, and 
marketing cost comes from internal company 
records. The key issue is that this information 
must be known on a per-customer basis. This 
knowledge is not necessarily common among 
many firms. An increasing number of firms are 
installing activity-based costing (ABC) schemes. 
ABC methods are used to arrive at appropriate 
allocations of customer and process-specific costs. 
The observation horizon (duration of customer 
relationship) T are derived either from manage-
rial judgment or come from actual purchase data 
(see 7 Sect. 5.4.6). The retention rates can be cal-
culated from internal records and customer track-
ing (see 7 Sect. 5.4.2). The interest rate is a 
function of a firm&rsquo;s cost of capital and can be 
obtained from the financial accounting depart-
ment. Information on externalities such as num-
ber of referrals or WOM can be derived from 
social network analyses or customer surveys.
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>LTV (or CLV) is a forward looking metric that 
allows for long-term decision making. It is a flex-
ible measure that has to be adapted to the specific 
business context of an industry. Each individual 
customer is evaluated on his expected contribu-
tions to the company. Yet, one has to bear in mind 
that all forecasts are subject to uncertainty. Being 
aware of the assumptions (especially for the pre-
diction of the retention rate and GC) is important 
for the correct interpretation of LTV and in

<p>implementing the right actions. LTV is useful in a 
variety of situations as for example, to evaluate the 
effect of a loyalty program (or an investment in 
customer satisfaction) on the bottom line. Other 
applications comprise price discrimination of 
customers with low LTV, better treatment of high 
LTV customers (e.g., Lufthansa Gold Card 
Members) or the decision on how much to pay for 
a click-through from an internet banner adver-
tisement for new customer acquisition.
</p>
<p>6.1.4  Customer Equity
</p>
<p>Building on the definition of LTV, we can aggre-
gate the LTV measure across customers. The 
resulting quantity is the customer equity (CE). 
This metric is an indicator of how much the firm 
is worth at a particular point in time as a result of 
the firm&rsquo;s customer management efforts.

</p>
<p>The CE is the sum of individual lifetime values 
of the customer base in net present value. In this 
case, the CE measure gives the economic value of 
an entire cohort or segment of customers. As CE is 
based on LTV this metric requires the allocation 
of revenues and costs on an individual customer 
level. One can relax this constraint by calculating 
the LTV of an average customer and take the sum 
of these average LTVs. This is further illustrated in 
the comprehensive example in 7 Sect. 6.1.5.
</p>
<p> Customer Equity Share (CES)
</p>
<p>An alternative metric to MS that takes the lifetime 
value of customers into account is the customer 
equity share (CES). The CES for a brand j can be 
calculated using the following formula:

</p>
<p> 5 Basically the same information as for the LTV 
is required.
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>The CE represents the value of the customer base 
to a company. This metric therefore can be seen as 
a link to the shareholder value of a firm. Besides 
the core elements of LTV (retention rate and GC), 
an important influencing factor for the CE is the 
proportion of profitable to unprofitable custom-
ers. In order to increase the CE management 
efforts should focus on increasing the number of 
highly profitable customers while reducing the 
number of unprofitable ones.
</p>
<p>The CES is a relative measure of the value of a 
brand within a firm.
</p>
<p>6.1.5  Comprehensive Example
</p>
<p>The following example illustrates some aspects of 
the previously introduced LTV and customer 
equity models (see . Table&nbsp;6.10). The observation 
horizon for this example is 5&nbsp;years (column 1). A 
company targets a list of 10,000 purchased 
addresses with an acquisition campaign. The 
company acquires 1000 customers through the 
target mailing; thus, the acquisition rate is 10%. 
At the end of the first period only 400 of the 1000 
customers remain. Once acquired, a customer 
generates on average $120&nbsp; in sales (column 2). 
For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, this level of sales is assumed 
to be constant over the lifetime of the customers. 
The margin of the firm is 30% (column 3), result-
ing in a constant gross margin (column 4). 
Marketing and service cost while alive are con-
stant as well (column 5). The retention rate in the 
first period is 40% and then increases over time, 
as the loyal customers remain. The resulting 
number of remaining customers in each period is 
shown in column 8. The profit per customer (col-
umn 9) is computed by subtracting the marketing 
and service cost from the gross margin. This per-
period contribution is discounted to present 
value with a yearly rate of 15% (column 10). 
Finally, the yearly discounted profit is multiplied 
with the number of remaining customers in each 
year. Then these values are summed up to the 
total customer equity of this group or cohort of 
customers (column 11).

<p>6.2  Popular Customer Selection 
Strategies
</p>
<p>Customer selection strategies are applied when 
firms want to target individual customers or 
groups of customers. The reason for targeting 
these customers can be manifold, for example, for 
sending out a promotion or inviting them to a 
special event. Finding the right targets for mar-
keting resource allocation is at the heart of any 
CRM strategy. Smart targeting allows firms to 
spend resources judiciously and allows customers 
to receive messages relevant to them. Inconsiderate 
targeting actions destroy value by over- or under 
spending from the firm&rsquo;s perspective and by pro-
viding undesirable messages (junk mail). One 
step in the successful implementation of CRM is 
the smart deployment of targeting methodologies 
to maximize the benefits to firm and customer.
</p>
<p>In particular we will discuss the techniques of 
profiling, binary classification trees, and logistic 
regression which can all be applied to binary (i.e., 
0/1) outcome variables. To check the performance 
of each of these models, typically, two thirds of the 
available data are used to calculate the model and 
the remaining third is used as a hold-out sample 
for validation. At the end of this chapter we intro-
duce the misclassification rate and lift analysis, 
</p>
<p>which are simple techniques to compare the per-
formance of two or more alternative models.
</p>
<p>This is an example where a company combines 
analytical skills, judicious judgment, knowledge 
about consumer behavior, and careful targeting of 
customers. It also shows that targeting always hap-
pens in a business context and is not a mechanic 
activity.
</p>
<p>6.2.1  Profiling
</p>
<p>An intuitive approach to customer selection is to 
assume that the most profitable customers share 
common characteristics (i.e., profitable customers 
are similar to one-another). Based on this assump-
tion the company should try to target customers 
with similar profiles to the currently most profit-
able ones. Depending on the intended goal (e.g., 
customer acquisition or direct-mail promotion to 
existing customers) &laquo;most profitable&raquo; can have 
different meanings, e.g., the customers who are 
most likely to respond to a direct-mail promotion. 
In the latter case RFM (see 7 Sect. 6.1.1) is widely 
used in practice for profiling. An alternative is to 
use available demographics instead of recency, 
frequency, or monetary value to sort and group 
the customer base. For the identification of

 The Kroger Co
</p>
<p>Kroger, an American grocery chain, 
</p>
<p>has a very successful loyalty 
</p>
<p>program in place, the Kroger Plus 
</p>
<p>Card. The majority of Kroger&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>shoppers make purchases using 
</p>
<p>the loyalty card which makes 
</p>
<p>Kroger&rsquo;s loyalty program rated one 
</p>
<p>of the highest in the United States. 
</p>
<p>Its loyalty program allows the 
</p>
<p>company to better understand 
</p>
<p>their customers&rsquo; shopping 
</p>
<p>behavior. Further, they individually 
</p>
<p>tailor coupons to customers based 
</p>
<p>on their purchase history.
</p>
<p>Kroger utilizes Dunnhumby, a 
</p>
<p>data analytics firm, to track 
</p>
<p>customer spending habits. With 
</p>
<p>majority of their transactions 
</p>
<p>involving the Kroger Plus Card, 
</p>
<p>Kroger uses this valuable tool to 
</p>
<p>collect the data Dunnhumby 
</p>
<p>analyzes. Every swipe a customer 
</p>
<p>makes using the loyalty card 
</p>
<p>provides more insight on that 
</p>
<p>shopper and any shopper that has 
</p>
<p>similar habits. Kroger then logs 
</p>
<p>those purchases into a database, 
</p>
<p>and creates customer profiles 
</p>
<p>based on past customer purchases. 
</p>
<p>After the data is sent to a database, 
</p>
<p>the company is then able to 
</p>
<p>analyze the purchases and engage 
</p>
<p>in target marketing. Kroger&rsquo;s target 
</p>
<p>marketing involves monitoring an 
</p>
<p>individual customer&rsquo;s shopping 
</p>
<p>behavior, analyzing the data, and 
</p>
<p>following up on the findings by 
</p>
<p>offering coupons that cater to the 
</p>
<p>customer&rsquo;s shopping habits. 
</p>
<p>Kroger does not offer coupons that 
</p>
<p>are not inline with past customer 
</p>
<p>purchasing habits because they 
</p>
<p>found that coupon redemption 
</p>
<p>rate is higher when promotions 
</p>
<p>include items customers are 
</p>
<p>interested in. Kroger&rsquo;s tactics to 
</p>
<p>cater coupons based on the 
</p>
<p>individual customer has resulted in 
</p>
<p>increased customer spending. In 
</p>
<p>2013, Kroger reported that their 
</p>
<p>targeted marketing generated $10 
</p>
<p>billion in revenue. In 2015, Kroger 
</p>
<p>earned $1.7 billion in profit on 
</p>
<p>sales of $108.5 billion. Kroger&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>loyalty card is one of the reasons 
</p>
<p>why Kroger has been able to 
</p>
<p>survive in today&rsquo;s competitive 
</p>
<p>market.

</p>
<p> variables that best characterize profitable custom-
ers classification trees or regression models can be 
used. A disadvantage of profiling is that only cus-
tomers are considered for targeting that are simi-
lar to the existing ones. Profitable customer 
segments that do not match the current customer 
base might be missed.
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>Consider the case of a bank which wants to 
</p>
<p>acquire new, profitable customers. Profiling con-
</p>
<p>sists of identifying profitable customers in the 
</p>
<p>bank&rsquo;s current mass-market segment and then to 
</p>
<p>target similar profiles in the prospect pool.
</p>
<p>Since the objective is to acquire prospects 
</p>
<p>likely to be high-value customers, the bank must 
</p>
<p>rely on customer characteristics common to both 
</p>
<p>current customers (the basis for establishing the 
</p>
<p>critical profile) and the prospects (scored on the 
</p>
<p>basis of their profile). The process is shown in the 
</p>
<p>. Fig.&nbsp;6.8.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the response variable for current cus-
tomers is the GC (field A). The company sorted 
customers by GC and chose to profile the top 20% 
of customers. Transaction information (field B) is 
not available for prospects. This is why the bank 
has to rely on information available for both 
existing customers and prospects. One type of 
information is geodemographic data, such as 
socioeconomic status of a region, average age, 
type of housing, and so on. These data are pro-
vided from direct marketing agencies that 
</p>
<p> specialize in the collection of geodemographics. 
They can be purchased and then appended to 
individual records of existing customers. That is, 
depending on name or ZIP code, geodemo-
graphic data are added to existing customer 
records. The model attempts to predict GC as the 
dependent variable with geodemographic infor-
mation as the independent variables. The ratio-
nale behind this process is to find the profile that 
best characterizes high-value clients, which is 
subsequently applied to prospects&rsquo; information. 
Finally, prospects with a high expected GC are 
targeted for the acquisition campaign.
</p>
<p>6.2.2  Binary Classification Trees
</p>
<p>Using classification (or decision) trees is a meth-
odology that can be used for finding the best pre-
dictors of a 0/1 dependent variable. For example, 
a company wants to know the differential demo-
graphic characteristics of loyalty program mem-
bers versus nonmembers. Classification trees are 
especially useful when there is a large set of poten-
tial predictors for a model. In such a case, it may 
be difficult to determine which predictors are the 
most important or what the relationships between 
the predictors and the target (dependent) variable 
are. Classification tree algorithms can be used to 
iteratively search through the data to find out 
which predictor best separates the two categories 
of a binary (or more generally categorical) target 
variable.

 Classification Tree Algorithm
</p>
<p>Assume that Y is a binary outcome variable, i.e., Y 
&isin; {0,1}, explained by a set of explanatory variables 
X
</p>
<p>1
,&hellip;,X
</p>
<p>p
 which are also binary.5 The algorithm 
</p>
<p>proceeds as follows: (1) To find out which of the 
explanatory variables X
</p>
<p>i
 best explains the out-
</p>
<p>come Y, calculate the number of misclassifications 
(i.e., the number of not correctly predicted out-
comes, for example if you want to predict credit 
card ownership and use gender as the predictor 
variable the misclassification rate is the number of 
male persons that do not own a credit card plus 
the number of female persons that do own a credit 
card) for each predictor variable X
</p>
<p>i
. (2) Use the 
</p>
<p>variable X
i
 with the lowest misclassification rate 
</p>
<p>to6 separate the customer base. (3) This process 
can be repeated for each sub segment, until the 
misclassification rate drops below a tolerable 
threshold or all of the predictors have been 
applied to the model.
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>Consider customer data for purchases of hockey 
</p>
<p>equipment from a sporting goods catalog. For 
</p>
<p>simplicity, there are only two predictor variables 
</p>
<p>given, gender and whether a customer has previ-
</p>
<p>ously bought scuba equipment (see . Table&nbsp;6.11). 
There are 8600 customers in total. 1730 bought 
</p>
<p>the hockey equipment, 3000 are female and 5600 
</p>
<p>5 If X
i
 is not binary one can find an optimal (in the 
</p>
<p>sense that it best separates Y on the basis of 
</p>

<p>are male. It is also known that of the 8600 cus-
</p>
<p>tomers 2800 have bought scuba equipment in 
</p>
<p>the past and 5800 have not bought scuba equip-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>Step 1
</p>
<p>To determine the optimum approach how to sep-
arate the customers, we calculate the number of 
misclassifications for both predictor variables 
(gender and scuba equipment; see . Fig.&nbsp; 6.9). 
Using gender as predictor of hockey sales we 
assume that all male persons buy hockey equip-
ment, whereas no female buys. For the predictor 
variable gender we get a misclassification rate of 
(4000&nbsp;+&nbsp;130)/8600&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.48. When using the scuba 
equipment predictor variable (everyone who 
bought scuba is going to buy hockey equipment) 
we obtain (2690&nbsp;+&nbsp;1620)/8600&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.50. Thus, sepa-
rating the customers based on gender is the opti-
mal first step.
</p>
<p>Step 2
</p>
<p>We split the customer base by gender to obtain 
the classification tree as depicted in . Fig.&nbsp;6.10.
</p>
<p>Step 3
</p>
<p>If further predictor variables were available 
besides the scuba indicator, we could continue to 
identify the optimal predictor for separation in 
each subsegment and restart with step 1. For 
example, we could find that it is best to separate 
female customers by marital status and male cus-
tomers by whether they have bought scuba equip-
ment. The resulting tree could look like . Fig.&nbsp;6.11.
</p>
<p>When this process is complete, a tree has 
developed in which segments are nested within 
segments. The profitable segments can then be 
identified for use as target markets.

<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>One problem with the decision tree approach is 
that it is prone to overfitting, whereby segments 
are tailored to very small segments, (based upon 
the dataset that was used to create the tree) and as 
a result, the model developed will not perform 
nearly as well on a separate dataset. A hold out 
sample (typically 1/3 of the data set, not used for 
model calibration) can be used for model valida-
tion (see . Sect. 6.3). If the results show a large 
discrepancy with what was expected, then the 
model will need to be reevaluated. If the results 
</p>
<p>are within the range of what is predicted from the 
model, it is likely that the model is a good fit.
</p>
<p>6.2.3  Logistic Regression
</p>
<p>Linear regression starts with the specification of the 
dependent variable and the independent variable. 
For example the number of people entering a store 
on a Saturday is the dependent variable of interest 
and the amount of money the store spent on adver-
tising on Friday is the independent variable. We

<p>122
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>expect to see a linear relationship between the two 
variables. A regression analysis creates an estimate 
of the coefficient that represents the effect of adver-
tising on store traffic. In this situation we note that 
store traffic (the dependent variable) can take on a 
large range of values. However, in marketing we 
often encounter situations where the dependent 
variable is binary. For example, in a situation where 
we are interested in whether a customer bought a 
product or not, we assign the value 0 to this variable 
when the customer does not buy, and the value 1 
when the customer buys. Regression models that 
allow for such a data structure are linear probability 
models, probit models, and logit models. Logit 
models also referred to as logistic regression are the 
most frequently applied method when the depen-
dent variable is binary and assumes only two dis-
crete values. For example:
5 Whether a customer responded to a market-
</p>
<p>ing campaign or not.
 5 Whether a person bought a car or not.
</p>
<p>These observed values for the dependent variable 
take on only two values and are usually repre-
sented using a 0&ndash;1 dummy variable. The mean of 
a 0&ndash;1 dummy variable is equal to the proportion 
</p>
<p>of observations with a value of 1, and can be inter-
preted as a probability. Furthermore, the pre-
dicted values in a logistic regression fall between 0 
and 1 and are also interpreted as probabilities. For 
example, home ownership as a function of income 
can be modeled whereby ownership is delineated 
by a 1 and non ownership by 0. The predicted 
value based on the model is interpreted as the 
probability that the individual is a home-owner. 
With a positive correlation between increasing 
income and increasing probability of ownership, 
we can expect to see results where the predicted 
probability of ownership is, for example, 0.22 for a 
person with an income of $35,000, and 0.95 for a 
person with a $250,000 income.

<p>The goal is to estimate the logistic regression on a 
sample of customers that were offered a gold card. 
Inputting values of the predictor variables for 
each potential target customer, the logistic model 
will yield a predicted probability for the target 
customer to sign up for the gold card offer. 
Customers with high predicted probabilities may 
be chosen to receive the offer because they seem 
more likely to respond positively.
</p>
<p>Dots represent observations of the dependent 
variable y. In case of linear regression y can take 
any value whereas in case of logistic regression y is 
either 0 or 1. The logistic regression curve reflects 
the predicted probability p of the event y at given 
levels of x.
</p>
<p>Mathematically, linear regression takes the 
form
</p>

</p>
<p>Transformation Process
</p>
<p>In this sort of regression, y can take on any value 
between negative infinity and positive infinity. 
However, as we noted earlier, in many instances 
</p>
<p>we observe only binary activity represented by 0 
or 1. Sample plots of observations with fitted lin-
ear and logistic regression curves are illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;6.12. Hence, if the actually observed depen-
dent variable has to be constrained between 0 and 
1 to indicate the probability of an event occurring, 
a transformation is necessary. This transforma-
tion is the basis of logistic regression. The steps of 
the transformation are given as follows:
</p>
<p> Step 1
</p>
<p>If p represents the probability of an event occur-
</p>
<p>ring, consider the ratio 
p
</p>
<p>p1-
. Since p is a positive 
</p>
<p>quantity less than 1, the range of this expression is 
0 to infinity.
</p>
<p> Step 2

and positive infinity.

A linear relationship of this value with predictor 
variables in the form z&nbsp;=&nbsp;α&nbsp;+&nbsp;βx&nbsp;+&nbsp;ε can be written 
out. The α and β coefficients can be estimated by 
maximum likelihood implemented in standard 
software packages.

<p> Interpretation of&nbsp;Coefficients
</p>
<p>Care has to be taken when interpreting the coef-
ficients. The interpretation of coefficients differs 
from simple linear regression. If the logit 
regression coefficient β&nbsp; =&nbsp; 2.303 then the log 
odds ratio is
</p>
<p>e e
b = =2 303 10. ,
</p>
<p>which says that when the independent variable 
x increases one unit, the odds that the depen-
dent variable equals 1 increases by a factor of 
10, keeping all other variables constant. Usually, 
besides the coefficients, &laquo;odds&raquo; are reported, 
i.e.,

<p>&oslash;
&divide; =
</p>
<p>is called the &laquo;odds&raquo; and represents the chance of 
an event occurring to the chance of the event 
not occurring, where p is the probability of the 
event.
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>Consider the extension of a service contract in a 
</p>
<p>B2B setting. The service company wants to know 
</p>
<p>the probability that a client extends his existing 
</p>
<p>contract. Therefore, it tracks the number of sales 
</p>
<p>calls and whether a client extends his contract 
</p>
<p>(see . Table&nbsp;6.12).
</p>
<p>It expects that the sales calls impact the probabil-
ity of contract extension. Thus, it estimates the 
model:
</p>
<p>Prob contract extension
</p>
<p>e
sales calls

<p>( ) =

<p>1
</p>
<p>1
a b
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> (6.13)
</p>
<p>The resulting estimates are α&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;1.37 and β&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.39. 
The odds and the probability of extension are 
illustrated in . Table&nbsp; 6.13. In this example the 
odds represent the relative likelihood that a cus-
tomer will extend his contract to not extending 
his contract. If no sales calls are made the odds are 
0.253 and in case of a sales call the odds are 0.375. 
The log-odds are e0.39&nbsp; =&nbsp; 1.477 meaning that for

<p>each additional sales call the odds for contract 
extension change by a factor of 1.477. The proba-
bilities of contract extension are 0.202 and 0.273 
for no and for one sales call, respectively. Thus, 
the difference in probabilities for a contract exten-
sion of making one sales call over not making a 
call is 0.07. Note that the difference of an addi-
tional sales call is not constant. For example mak-
ing four instead of three sales calls changes the 
probability for a contract extension by 0.098.
</p>
<p> Evaluation
</p>
<p>Unlike in linear regression where the effect of one 
unit change in the independent variable on the 
dependent variable is assumed to be a constant 
represented by the slope of a straight line, for 
logistic regression the effect of a one-unit increase 
in the predictor variable varies along an s-shaped 
curve (see . Fig.&nbsp; 6.12). This means that at the 
extremes, a one-unit change has very little effect, 
but in the center a one-unit change has a fairly 
large effect. In the case of the income versus home 
ownership example, the difference in the likeli-
hood that an individual owns a home may not 
change much as income increases from $10,000 to 
$30,000 or from $1000,000 to $1,020,000, but may 
increase considerably if income increases from 
$50,000 to $70,000.
</p>
<p>6.3  Techniques to&nbsp;Evaluate 
Alternative Customer 
Selection Strategies
</p>
<p>A critical step to decide which model to use to select 
and target potential customers is to evaluate alter-
native selection strategies. When several alternative 
</p>
<p>models are available for customer selection, we 
need to compare their relative quality of prediction. 
To compare the predictive capabilities of models, 
we typically divide the data into a training (calibra-
tion) dataset (2/3 of the data) and a holdout (test) 
sample (1/3 of the data). The models are estimated 
based on the training dataset. Using these estimates 
predictions are made for the holdout data. We can 
then compare the predictive performance of the 
models. Some models will have more predictive 
power than others, and we will select the model that 
generalizes best from the training to the test data.
</p>
<p>The most common way to assess a model&rsquo;s 
performance is by comparing their respective 
misclassification rates obtained on the test set. An 
alternative method for getting an idea about 
model performance is lift analysis.
</p>
<p>6.3.1  Misclassification Rate
</p>
<p>To obtain the misclassification rate, we estimate 
the different models on two thirds of the available 
data and calculate the misclassification rate on the 
remaining third to check the model performance. 
The misclassification rate is the number of false 
predictions divided by the total number of predic-
tions made.
</p>
<p>A misclassification error rate or confusion 
matrix could look like . Table&nbsp;6.14. The number 
of false predictions is the sum of the off-diagonal 
entries (56&nbsp;+&nbsp;173&nbsp;=&nbsp;229). Thus, the misclassifica-
tion rate in this example is 229/1459&nbsp;=&nbsp;15.7%.

</p>
<p>no model was used (base model). This gives a 
baseline measure of how good the model is. As 
an example, consider 1000 prospects, of which 
100 have purchased. A good predictive model 
helps increase the relative amount of purchasers 
in the selected group: a random-based selection 
of 100 prospects would contain about 10 pur-
chasers, whereas a model-based selection of 100 
prospects could result in 30 purchasers. This is 
what lift charts help to visualize. The models 
with the highest lift are candidates for final 
selection.
</p>
<p>Lifts can be used to compare two or more 
alternative models, track a model&rsquo;s performance 
over time, or to compare a model&rsquo;s performance 
on different samples. To calculate lifts for different 
deciles of data, we need the following information 
about a model with regard to the set of customer 
data.
</p>
<p> 5 Cumulative number of customers: The 
number of total customers up to and includ-
ing that decile.
</p>
<p> 5 Cumulative percentage of customers: The 
percent of total customers up to and includ-
ing that decile.
</p>
<p> 5 Cumulative number of buyers: The number 
of buyers up to and including that decile.
</p>
<p> 5 Actual response rate for each decile: Com-
puted by dividing the number of buyers by 
the number of customers for each decile.
</p>
<p> 5 OR predicted response rate based on the 
model for each decile: Computed by 
dividing the predicted number of buyers by 
the number of customers for each decile.

<p> Lift Performance Illustration
</p>
<p>Initially, the model (such as RFM, or logistic 
regression) which one wants to evaluate needs to 
be run and the customer base should be sorted 
accordingly. On the basis of the sorted customer 
list, customers are distributed into 10 equal-sized 
groups (see . Table&nbsp; 6.15). In a model that per-
forms well,  customers in the first decile exhibit 
the highest response rate and the response rate 
continuously drops as we proceed along the 
deciles. (see . Fig.&nbsp;6.13).
</p>
<p>For the top decile in this case, the lift is 3.09 
(see . Fig.&nbsp;6.14). This indicates that by targeting 
only these customers we would expect to yield 
3.09 times the number of buyers found by ran-
domly mailing the same number of customers. In 
contrast, the last decile (decile 10) attracts only 
0.08 times the number of buyers as one would 
expect in a random sample of the same size. Lifts 
that exceed 1 indicate better than average perfor-
mance of that particular decile, and those that are 
less than 1 indicate a poorer than average perfor-
mance. Also keep in mind that lift is a relative 
index to a baseline measure, in this case the aver-
age response rate for the entire sample.
</p>
<p>The cumulative lifts for the model in 
. Fig.&nbsp;6.15 reveal the proportion of responders we 
can expect to gain from targeting a specific per-
cent of customers using the model. If we choose 
the customers from the top three deciles (i.e., the 
top 30% of the customers), we will obtain 68% of 
the total responders. The larger the distance 
between the model and no model lines, the stron-
ger or more powerful is the model. The slope of 
the cumulative lift curve reflects the lift. In a nut-
shell, lifts can be used to compare two or more 
alternative models, track a model&rsquo;s performance 
over time, or to compare a model&rsquo;s performance 
on different samples.
</p>
<p>Past experience shows that logistic models 
tend to provide the best lift performance when 
used as a tool for customer selection. This is 
seen from the topmost curve in the lift chart in 
. Fig.&nbsp;6.16. The model is better able to identify 
the best customers and group them in the first 
few deciles. The past customer value approach 
provides the next best performance, whereas 
the traditional RFM approach, though by no 
means redundant, exhibits the poorest perfor-
mance.

<p>Differentiating Customer Service 
</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;Customer Value at 
</p>
<p>United Parcel Service (UPS)
</p>
<p>UPS, headquartered in Atlanta, 
</p>
<p>Georgia, is one of the world&rsquo;s larg-
</p>
<p>est package delivery companies. 
</p>
<p>UPS&mdash;sometimes referred to as the 
</p>
<p>&laquo;Big Brown&raquo;&mdash;has grown astronomi-
</p>
<p>cally compared to its modest roots 
</p>
<p>as a bicycle courier service founded 
</p>
<p>in 1907. Today, UPS is a global leader 
</p>
<p>in logistics. Over the years, UPS has 
</p>
<p>acquired more than 40 companies 
</p>
<p>which has enabled them to pen-
</p>
<p>etrate into sectors such as retail 
</p>
<p>shipping, air freight, and business 
</p>
<p>services. Now serving over 220 coun-
</p>
<p>tries worldwide, the acquisitions 
</p>
<p>have also given UPS the opportunity 
</p>
<p>to develop strong relationships with 
</p>
<p>many customers across the world.
</p>
<p>In an effort to achieve their 
</p>
<p>expansion goals, UPS decided to 
</p>
<p>create service levels for managing 
</p>
<p>temperature- sensitive healthcare 
</p>
<p>products. The service levels were 
</p>
<p>an addition to an already existing 
</p>
<p>Temperature True portfolio. The 
</p>
<p>change allowed healthcare compa-
</p>
<p>nies to choose from tiered service 
</p>
<p>levels based on the degree of 
</p>
<p>temperature control needed. The 
</p>
<p>service levels were as follows:
</p>
<p>UPS Temperature True Service 
</p>
<p>Portfolio:
</p>
<p> 5 UPS Temperature True Plus: 
The highest level of service 
</p>
<p>that is ideal for air freight 
</p>
<p>shipments that require very 
</p>
<p>strict temperature ranges 
</p>
<p>in transit. UPS&rsquo;s existing 
</p>
<p>service includes processes 
</p>
<p>for managing shipments 
</p>
<p>with the highest degree of 
</p>
<p>risk mitigation. In addition, 
</p>
<p>this service level includes 
</p>
<p>monitoring throughout the 
</p>
<p>entire shipping process.
</p>
<p> 5 UPS Temperature True 
Standard: An offering ideal 
</p>
<p>for shipments that need 
</p>
<p>lower levels of in-transit 
</p>
<p>monitoring, while still help-
</p>
<p>ing healthcare companies 
</p>
<p>maintain product compli-
</p>
<p>ance and peace of mind.
</p>
<p> 5 UPS Temperature True 
Saver: A standardized 
</p>
<p>ocean freight solution for 
</p>
<p>temperature-sensitive ship-
</p>
<p>ments. This option is ideal 
</p>
<p>for large volume shipments 
</p>
<p>where cost management 
</p>
<p>and regulatory compliance 
</p>
<p>are both paramount.
</p>
<p>The expansions to the UPS Tem-
</p>
<p>perature True global portfolio offers 
</p>
<p>a range of services that provide the 
</p>
<p>healthcare industry with a more 
</p>
<p>improved shipping solution for 
</p>
<p>temperature-sensitive healthcare 
</p>
<p>products. Services such as quality 
</p>
<p>assurance support and 24/7 control 
</p>
<p>tower monitoring can be custom-
</p>
<p>ized based on the company&rsquo;s needs. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the service options 
</p>
<p>include packaging consulting 
</p>
<p>services for temperature- sensitive

<p>products as well as best-in-class

</p>
<p>and intervention services, risk man-
</p>
<p>agement and contingency planning 
</p>
<p>as well as deep regulatory compli-
</p>
<p>ance expertise.
</p>
<p>UPS decided to offer these ser-
</p>
<p>vice levels after receiving feedback 
</p>
<p>from customers in the healthcare 
</p>
<p>industry. The customers vocalized 
</p>
<p>their healthcare product shipment 
</p>
<p>needs, and UPS met those needs 
</p>
<p>by improving services offered by 
</p>
<p>an existing solution and allowing 
</p>
<p>customers to customize based on 
</p>
<p>their needs.

</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>Since customer value management involves 
</p>
<p>allocating resources differently for individual 
</p>
<p>customers based on their economic value, 
</p>
<p>understanding value contribution from each 
</p>
<p>of the customers to the firm is very important. 
</p>
<p>The availability of customer-level data helps 
</p>
<p>firms utilize a new set of metrics beyond 
</p>
<p>traditional and popular marketing metrics 
</p>
<p>introduced in 7 Chap. 5. These strategic cus-
tomer-based metrics enable the assignment 
</p>
<p>of value to each individual customer.
</p>
<p>Popular strategic customer-based value 
</p>
<p>metrics are RFM, past customer value, lifetime 
</p>
<p>value, and customer equity. RFM is a compos-
</p>
<p>ite score of recency, frequency, and monetary 
</p>
<p>value. Two methods used for computing and 
</p>
<p>applying RFM are sorting techniques and 
</p>
<p>calculation of relative weights for R, F, and 
</p>
<p>M.&nbsp;In the sorting technique the RFM values 
</p>
<p>are assigned for each customer by sequential 
</p>
<p>sorting based on the RFM metrics and then 
</p>
<p>used to group customers, belonging to spe-
</p>
<p>cific RFM codes. However, this method might 
</p>
<p>not produce an equal number of customers 
</p>
<p>under each RFM cell. A hierarchical sorting 
</p>
<p>technique ensures equal numbers in each 
</p>
<p>RFM cell. This is done by first sorting the list of 
</p>
<p>customers by recency and dividing them into 
</p>
<p>equal groups. Each of these groups is then 
</p>
<p>sorted based on frequency and divided into 
</p>
<p>groups of equal size. Each of these subgroups 
</p>
<p>is sorted on monetary value and divided into 
</p>
<p>groups of equal size. This way, each RFM cell 
</p>
<p>will have an equal number of customers. An 
</p>
<p>alternate method for RFM metric uses linear 
</p>
<p>regression to arrive at the relative weights 
</p>
<p>of the R, F, and M metrics, and these relative 
</p>
<p>weights are used to compute the RFM score 
</p>
<p>of each customer. The higher the computed 
</p>
<p>RFM score, the more profitable the customer 
</p>
<p>is likely to be in the future. This method has 
</p>
<p>the advantage of being flexible, so that it can 
</p>
<p>be tailored to each business situation. In order 
</p>
<p>to decide which RFM cells to target the break-
</p>
<p>even value (BE) and break even index (BEI) can 
</p>
<p>be calculated for each RFM cell. With respect 
</p>
<p>to a promotion, breakeven refers to the fact 
</p>
<p>that the net profit from a marketing promo-
</p>
<p>tion equals the cost associated with conduct-
</p>
<p>ing the promotion. The BE can be used in 
</p>
<p>computing a BEI, calculated as Breakeven 
</p>
<p>index (BEI)&nbsp;=&nbsp;([Actual response rate&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;BE]/
</p>
<p>BE)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100. A positive BEI indicates some profit 
</p>
<p>was made from the transaction. A BEI value of 
</p>
<p>0 indicates the transaction only broke even, 
</p>
<p>and a negative BEI value indicates the transac-
</p>
<p>tion resulted in a loss.
</p>
<p>Another important customer-based metric 
</p>
<p>is past customer value (PCV), in which the 
</p>
<p>value of a customer is determined based on 
</p>
<p>the total contribution (toward profits) pro-

</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. Companies are becoming more customer 
</p>
<p>focused in today&rsquo;s world because they 
</p>
<p>have discovered how important customer 
</p>
<p>oriented decisions can be when trying to 
</p>
<p>survive in today&rsquo;s competitive market. In 
</p>
<p>China, SAS, a business analytics provider, 
</p>
<p>teamed up with Radica, a marketing firm 
</p>
<p>headquartered in Hong Kong, to develop 
</p>
<p>a CRM analytics software. This software 
</p>
<p>enables companies to pull data from 
</p>
<p>social media platforms, and make deci-
</p>
<p>sions based on the company&rsquo;s findings. 
</p>
<p>Essentially, companies will now be able 
</p>
<p>to mine data from social media sources, 
</p>
<p>and use the findings to develop better 
</p>
<p>customer strategies (Onag, 2015).
</p>
<p> 2. Can data analytics and science be com-
</p>
<p>bined for an even greater good? Laing 
</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Rourke, an engineering company 
</p>
<p>headquartered in the United Kingdom, 
</p>
<p>believed it was possible to merge the 
</p>
<p>two and come up with very useful infor-
</p>
<p>mation. Recently, the company used 
</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet of Things technology 
</p>
<p>to collect data on their field workers. The 
</p>
<p>field workers were asked to wear sensors 
</p>
<p>while on a job. The sensors were used to 
</p>
<p>capture the worker&rsquo;s vitals and the sur-
</p>
<p>rounding environment conditions while 
</p>
<p>the employee was working. The compa-
</p>
<p>ny&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to use the collected 
</p>
<p>data to predict conditions that would 
</p>
<p>lead to health issues before the issue hap-
</p>
<p>pens. Since work conditions are being 
</p>
<p>monitored, the company would be able 
</p>
<p>to reduce employee absenteeism due to 
</p>
<p>health issues related to job conditions 
</p>
<p>(Merritt, 2015).
</p>
<p>vided by the customer in the past after adjust-
</p>
<p>ing for the time value of money. The lifetime 
</p>
<p>value (LTV), in contrast, reflects the long-term 
</p>
<p>economic value of a customer and is calcu-
</p>
<p>lated as the sum of the discounted expected 
</p>
<p>contribution margins over the respective 
</p>
<p>observation horizon. The contribution margin 
</p>
<p>can be computed knowing the values of sales, 
</p>
<p>direct costs, and marketing costs. The sum 
</p>
<p>of the lifetime value of all the customers of a 
</p>
<p>firm represents the customer equity (CE) of a 
</p>
<p>firm. It is an indicator of how much the firm is 
</p>
<p>worth at a particular point in time as a result 
</p>
<p>of the firm&rsquo;s customer management efforts. 
</p>
<p>This metric therefore can be seen as a link to 
</p>
<p>the shareholder value of a firm.
</p>
<p>Firms employ different customer selection 
</p>
<p>strategies to target the right customers. Some 
</p>
<p>of the popular customer selection strategies are 
</p>
<p>profiling, binary classification trees, and logistic 
</p>
<p>regression. Profiling rests on the assumption 
</p>
<p>that profitable customers share common 
</p>
<p>characteristics. Profiling consists of identifying 
</p>
<p>profitable customers in the existing customer 
</p>
<p>base and then to target similar customers from 
</p>
<p>the prospect pool. The construction of binary 
</p>
<p>classification trees relies on a recursive parti-
</p>
<p>tioning algorithm used for finding the predic-
</p>
<p>tors which best separate the two categories of 
</p>
<p>a binary (0/1) dependent variable. To avoid over 
</p>
<p>fitting, this search is performed on two thirds 
</p>
<p>of the available data with one third of the data 
</p>
<p>reserved for testing the eventual model that 
</p>
<p>will be developed. Logistic regression is a statis-
</p>
<p>tical tool to predict the probability of a binary 
</p>
<p>outcome using predictor variables.
</p>
<p>To evaluate alternative selection strate-
</p>
<p>gies, firms can use techniques such as 
</p>
<p>misclassification rates and lift analysis. The 
</p>
<p>misclassification rate is the number of false 
</p>
<p>predictions divided by the total number of 
</p>
<p>predictions made. Lifts indicate how much 
</p>
<p>better a model performs than no model or 
</p>
<p>average performance, and are calculated 
</p>
<p>as (Response rate for each decile) &divide; (Overall 
</p>
<p>response rate)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100. Based on lifts we can 
</p>
<p>perform a decile analysis. Therefore, custom-
</p>
<p>ers are sorted based on the model to be eval-
</p>
<p>uated and grouped into deciles. For a good 
</p>

<p> Appendix II Regression Scoring 
Models
</p>
<p>Scoring models is the process of evaluating poten-
tial customer behavior on the basis of test results. 
Typically, a test is conducted in a limited market 
or in an experimental set up on a small subset of 
customers. This subset of customers is exposed to 
a marketing campaign and a product offering. The 
purpose of this test is to assign to each of the 
remaining customers a value which is extrapo-
lated from the results of this test. These values 
typically reflect the prospective customer&rsquo;s likeli-
hood of purchasing the test marketed product. 
The process of regression scoring can be repre-
sented in the following steps:
 1. Draw a random sample from the overall 
</p>
<p>population of prospective customers.
 2. Obtain data from the sample that profiles 
</p>
<p>individual consumer characteristics. The R, F, 
and M scores are variables which profile 
behavioral characteristics of a customer and 
are typically used in this procedure, along 
with other relevant variables.
</p>
<p> 3. Initiate a marketing campaign directed at the 
random sample, and record the individuals 
who become customers.
</p>
<p> 4. With that information, develop a regression 
scoring model to obtain a series of weighted 
variables that either predict which prospects are 
more likely to become customers or the value of 
profits that each customer is likely to provide, 
based on their individual characteristics.
</p>
<p> 5. By applying these weights to individual 
characteristics of prospective customers, we 
can arrive at a value for each customer which 
indicates how likely it is that the customer 
will purchase a product, or how much profit 
the customer will generate, if exposed to the 
tested marketing campaign.

<p>7.1  The Need for&nbsp;Data Mining
</p>
<p>Today, most companies do not suffer from lack of 
data about their customers, products, transac-
tions, and markets. To the contrary, data deluge is 
a problem in many companies. This is especially 
challenging for information-intensive businesses, 
such as banking, telecommunication, and 
e- commerce, where large amounts of data can 
easily be recorded. The sheer amount of raw data 
is, for many, an obstacle to using it for extracting 
knowledge and for making critical business deci-
sions. By default, educated guessing becomes the 
primary decision-making tool. It does not have to 
be that way.
</p>
<p>Availability of computers and mass storage, 
statistical and data analysis methods, sophisti-
cated reporting platforms, and online touch 
points with customers, now give companies 
access to a powerful asset: information. Data 
have become a company&rsquo;s most important&mdash;and 
in many cases, untapped&mdash;asset. To extract cus-
tomer intelligence and value from that data, com-
panies must implement a standardized data 
</p>
<p>mining procedure. A successful data mining 
infrastructure consists of technology, human 
skills, and tight integration with enterprise oper-
ations to allow transforming new knowledge into 
business action and value. It is important to stan-
dardize the data mining process to assure the 
required quality of results, make it a repeatable 
process, better maintain and keep the knowledge 
inside the company, as well as training new 
employees more quickly.
</p>
<p>7.2  The Business Value of&nbsp;Data 
Mining
</p>
<p>In the context of customer management, data 
mining can help to gain a better understanding 
of customers and their needs. Marketing is still 
frequently associated only with creative and soft 
skills. But by scientifically enhancing targeting, 
we can obtain more impressive cost reductions 
and revenue growth than by working only with 
the creative aspects of marketing. Data mining 
can assist in selecting the right target custom-
</p>
<p>Overview
</p>
<p>The way in which companies interact with 
</p>
<p>their customers has changed dramatically 
</p>
<p>over the past few years. Customers&rsquo; expecta-
</p>
<p>tions have risen, and it is becoming increas-
</p>
<p>ingly difficult to satisfy them. Customers have 
</p>
<p>access to an array of alternative products to 
</p>
<p>choose from and their loyalty is difficult to 
</p>
<p>gain. At the same time, companies need to 
</p>
<p>retain the profitable customers to succeed 
</p>
<p>in a competitive and dynamic marketplace. 
</p>
<p>As a result, companies have found they need

<p>to understand their customers better, and to 
</p>
<p>respond to their wants and needs faster. The 
</p>
<p>time frame in which these responses need to 
</p>
<p>be made has been shrinking. More custom-
</p>
<p>ers, more products, more competitors, and 
</p>
<p>less time to react means understanding the 
</p>
<p>customers is now much harder to do.
</p>
<p>To succeed, companies must be proac-
</p>
<p>tive and anticipate customer desires. Many 
</p>
<p>firms have realized this and are collecting 
</p>
<p>information about their customers and their 
</p>
<p>preferences. Firms collect, store, and process 
</p>
<p>vast amounts of highly detailed information 
</p>
<p>about customers, markets, products, and 
</p>
<p>processes through different programs. Data 
</p>
<p>mining this information gives businesses the 
</p>
<p>ability to make knowledge-driven strategic 
</p>
<p>business decisions to help predict future 
</p>
<p>trends and behaviors and create new oppor-
</p>
<p>tunities. Data mining can assist in selecting 
</p>
<p>the right target customers or in identifying 
</p>
<p>(previously unknown) customer segments 
</p>
<p>with similar behaviors and needs.
</p>
<p>This chapter describes the importance 
</p>
<p>and benefits of data mining and gives a 
</p>
<p>detailed overview of the underlying process. 
</p>
<p>The data mining procedure breaks down into 
</p>
<p>five subsections: defining the business 
</p>
<p>objectives, getting the raw data, identifying 
</p>
<p>relevant variables, gaining customer insight, 
</p>
<p>and acting. The discussion of these steps will 
</p>
<p>help the reader understand the overall 
</p>
<p>process of data mining. The process steps are 
</p>
<p>illustrated with the case study of Credite Est

<p>ers or in identifying (previously unknown) 
customer segments with similar behaviors and 
needs. A good target list developed by using data 
mining techniques is likely to increase purchase 
rates and have a positive impact on  revenue.
</p>
<p>Applications of data mining include the fol-
lowing:
</p>
<p> 5 Reducing churn with the help of predictive 
models (see Summary), which enable early 
identification of those customers likely to 
stop doing business with your company.
</p>
<p> 5 Increasing customer profitability by identify-
ing customers with a high growth potential.
</p>
<p> 5 Reducing marketing costs by more selective 
targeting.
</p>
<p>This chapter introduces a systematic approach to 
data mining projects.
</p>
<p>7.3  The Data Mining Process
</p>
<p>A complete data mining process does not only 
consist of building analytical models using tech-
niques such as logistic regression (see 7 Sect. 
6.2.3). It includes assessing and specifying the 
business objectives, data sourcing, transforma-
tion, creation of analytical variables, selecting rel-
evant variables, training predictive models, 
selecting the best suited model, and acting on the 
basis of the findings. These activities can be 
grouped into five process steps of defining the 
business objectives, getting raw data, indentifying 
</p>
<p>relevant variables, gaining customer insight, and 
acting. . Figure&nbsp; 7.1 presents an overview of the 
data mining process.
</p>
<p>In many instances of current data mining 
projects we find data preparation steps easily take 
from 60% to 70% of the total project time. This is 
not due to the weaknesses of any specific data 
mining methodology. It is due to issues regarding 
unavailability of relevant variables describing cus-
tomer behavior. An example of which is the diffi-
cult access to legacy data source systems managed 
by different departments which do not possess the 
customer centric views required for data mining 
projects. These departments are more likely 
geared towards transaction, product, contract, or 
other type of views more suited to fulfill the needs 
of their current operational systems. The graph 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;7.2 helps to understand the time-
frame of the individual steps of the data mining 
process.
</p>
<p>It is important to automate the time- 
consuming data extraction and manipulation, 
as well as the data quality monitoring and 
enhancement steps. To achieve this goal, it is 
necessary to sequentially and systematically 
code data knowledge into programs that can be 
executed, for instance, in batch mode. This will 
free up time of highly qualified quantitative data 
analysts (data miners) to concentrate on the 
value-generating tasks such as the precise defi-
nition of business objectives, extraction of cus-
tomer insight, and effective actions based on 
gained knowledge.

</p>
<p>7.3.1  Involvement of&nbsp;Resources
</p>
<p>Usually, different functional departments are 
involved in data mining projects. The main 
groups are the business group (e.g., marketing, 
product management), data mining, and IT.&nbsp;The 
business group is primarily involved in defining 
business objectives, and takes the lead when it 
comes to deploying the new insights into corpo-
rate action. The data mining group must under-
stand the business objectives and support the 
business group in refining and sometimes cor-
recting the scope of the project and aligning 
their expectations to fit the limitations posed by 
the available data. The data mining group is most 
active during the variable selection and model-
ing phase. It will share the obtained customer 
insights with the business group, who are 
strongly involved at this point to check the plau-
sibility and soundness of the solution in business 
terms. IT resources are required for the sourcing 
and extraction of the required data used for 
modeling. . Figure&nbsp; 7.3 shows the extent of 
involvement of the three main groups participat-
ing in a data mining project&mdash;business, data 
mining, and IT&mdash;during the different process 
steps.
</p>
<p>7.3.2  Data Manipulation
</p>
<p>As we move through the data mining process, the 
dimensionality of the data used may change dra-
matically. In a simple, two-dimensional data table 
we think of the columns as being the descriptive 
variables and the rows as being single observations, 
each pertaining to a collection of variables about 
the same primary object (e.g., customer identifica-
tion number, transaction identification number).
</p>
<p>Manipulations on columns can take several 
forms:
</p>
<p> 5 Transformation: Transform birth date to age.
 5 Derivation: Create new variables based on 
</p>
<p>existing ones (e.g., compute monthly profits 
from sales and cost information).
</p>
<p> 5 Elimination: A whole variable may be 
excluded from further processing due to a 
variety of possible reasons (e.g., a variable 
that does not help in predicting or a variable 
that is correlated to one or more variables 
already in the model could be eliminated).
</p>
<p>The number of variables used changes drastically 
during the data mining process. . Figure&nbsp;7.4 illus-
trates a typical example of the changes in the 
number of variables used at each step.

</p>
<p>If we also take into consideration that we usually 
work with up to several millions of rows it becomes 
obvious that scalability and good sampling methods 
are essential for any data mining environment.
</p>
<p>There are also several types of row manipula-
tions, the most common ones can be classified into:
</p>
<p> 5 Aggregation: Examples include counts, 
mean, and standard deviation of the number 
of transactions of a specific type over a given 
time period, for a specific customer, product 
type and many more.
</p>
<p> 5 Change detection: This is used to detect 
when and if certain variables change their 
value such as ZIP code of customers domi-
cile, or her credit rating.
</p>
<p> 5 Missing value detection: It is common that 
raw data come with many data fields either 
totally missing or with some missing values. 
The reasons for this may be nonmandatory 
input fields in front-office systems, incom-
</p>
<p>plete data migration from one system to 
another, and so on. There are various ways 
of treating a variable with missing values, 
including eliminating the whole row from 
further processing when a missing value is 
detected, replacing the missing value with 
a constant value, or replacing it with a ran-
domly generated value based on the distribu-
tion of this data field&rsquo;s nonmissing values or 
based on correlations with: other data fields.1
</p>
<p> 5 Outlier detection: In some cases observa-
tions may contain variables with extreme 
values, meaning values far away from the 
bulk of other values for the distinct variable. 
Sometimes these outliers are real; sometimes 
</p>
<p>1 An example would be the expectation maximization 
</p>
<p>algorithm (EM) that takes into account the correlation 
</p>
<p>of the data field for which a nonmissing value is to be 
</p>
<p>generated with other data fields.

</p>
<p>they are the consequence of bad data qual-
ity. Outlier detection is in its simple form 
univariate: we just look at one variable and 
try to find values that stand out. In its more 
sophisticated form we look at many variables 
at the same time and watch out for multivari-
ate outliers (a data point might look like an 
outlier in the univariate case but not in the 
multivariate case). Outliers can be mapped to 
other values or the corresponding rows and 
be excluded from further processing.
</p>
<p>When preparing the data for modeling, it is com-
mon to sample and split the incoming data into 
various streams for different purposes:
</p>
<p> 5 Train set: Used to build the models.
 5 Test set: Used for out-of-sample tests of the 
</p>
<p>model quality and to select the final model 
candidate.
</p>
<p> 5 Scoring data: Used for model-based predic-
tion. Typically, this data set is large as com-
pared to the previous ones.
</p>
<p>The data sets must be carefully examined and 
designed to assure statistical significance of the 
results obtained.
</p>
<p>7.3.3  Define Business Objectives
</p>
<p>Data mining finds application in many situa-
tions. Profitable customer acquisition requires 
</p>
<p> modeling of expected customer potential, in 
order to target the acquisition of those custom-
ers who will be profitable over the lifetime of 
the business relationship (they might be 
unprofitable in the beginning and turn into 
very profitable customers later&mdash;e.g., a medi-
cine student). In a cross-selling or up-selling 
model, we model the customer&rsquo;s affinity with a 
set of products or services translated into her 
purchase likelihood. In churn management, it 
is crucial to correctly model a customer&rsquo;s likeli-
hood to defect based on past behavior. Some 
applications require predicting not only who 
will purchase which product or service, but also 
the expected amount spent on the transactions 
(. Fig.&nbsp;7.5).
</p>
<p>Once it has been identified which customer 
behavior has to be predicted, we need to mathe-
matically define this target variable (dependent 
variable). For example, while up-selling platinum 
credit cards to customers already owning a stan-
dard credit card, we might find several types of 
standard and platinum cards exist. The business 
objective might, in fact, only be to up-sell plati-
num cards of types P2 and P3 to customers not 
owning a card yet, or those already owning stan-
dard cards of type S1, S3, and S4. The target vari-
able has to reflect these conditions when 
calculated. This has a later direct impact on the 
modeling process.
</p>
<p>To prepare the modeling data sets we will look 
for two types of customers in the customer

</p>
<p> database and set the value of the target variable 
accordingly:
</p>
<p> 5 For all customers who (first purchased a 
standard card of type S1, S3 or S4 and then 
purchased a platinum card of type P2 or P3) 
or (purchased a platinum card of type P2 or 
P3 immediately) set target variable&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.
</p>
<p> 5 For all other customers set target variable&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.
 5 Once these restrictions and considerations 
</p>
<p>have been applied to the data, the model will 
be trained to distinguish between custom-
ers with a target variable equal to zero and 
customers with a target variable equal to one 
(for example using logistic regression, see 
7 Sect. 6.2.3) After training, the model will 
be applied to predict if a given customer is 
likely to buy the platinum cards. The business 
group must establish likelihood threshold lev-
els above which they think a prospect should 
be included in the marketing campaign.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of the campaign which should be 
defined during this project phase is the set of busi-
ness or selection rules for a campaign. Rules 
define the customers that should be excluded 
from or included in the target groups: certain 
products or services might not be available for 
specific customer groups. Suppose that in certain 
countries only customers over 18&nbsp;years are eligible 
to purchase a credit card. Credit products in gen-
eral have restrictions with respect to the custom-
er&rsquo;s credit rating. Companies have &laquo;black-lists&raquo; 
containing customers who should not receive any 
new offerings, either due to bad debt indicators 
(they do not have a good credit rating) or persons 
explicitly asking not to be contacted for market-
ing purposes. Some countries have centrally man-
aged lists with all persons not wanting to receive 
unauthorized direct mails or calls. By contrast, 
there might also be customer groups that should 
be included at any price in the campaign&mdash;for 
instance, due to strategic issues such as need to 
gain market share in a specific region or otherwise 
defined group. In those cases, it is not relevant if 
members of that group get high model scores; 
they are included anyway.
</p>
<p>To ensure a successful project, we need to 
define at this point the details of its execution. 
Therefore, we should create a project plan speci-
fying, for instance, the start and delivery dates of 
the data mining process, as well as the responsi-
ble resources for each task. For the final model 
</p>
<p>selection the business group must be available for 
reviewing the data mining results, perform con-
sistency checks with the data mining group, and 
make the final decision about the model selected 
for deployment. Delivery dates for the final 
model or scores also need to be defined, along 
with dates for start and end of the supported 
campaign.
</p>
<p>We need to carefully define the chosen experi-
mental setup for the campaign; this is critical for 
correctly evaluating its success later. It is highly 
recommended to spend a significant amount of 
time getting this right. Usually, we split the target 
group into various cells. In the simplest case there 
will be only two cells:
 1. The control group contains only randomly 
</p>
<p>selected customers: This group will be 
needed to measure the baseline effect (i.e., 
what would have been the normal customer 
behavior without the influence of the 
campaign).
</p>
<p> 2. The other cell will contain only the best 
customers according to the model used: 
This simple setup allows measuring how the 
model-based selection is doing with respect 
to the average customer behavior.
</p>
<p>More refined setups may generate more than two 
cells. As an example, take the control group and 
two target groups to which we communicate dif-
ferent content about the same offering during the 
campaign. This will show the impact of the com-
munication content on the purchase behavior.
</p>
<p>To get the business context into the data min-
ing project, describe the nature of the business 
involving the data mining project, and the cost 
and revenue drivers of the business. This knowl-
edge will affect the final model and target group 
selections. It is helpful to define a cost/revenue 
matrix describing how the business mechanics 
will work in the supported campaign and how it 
will affect the data mining process. As an example, 
consider a call center campaign to sell a mobile 
phone contract. . Table&nbsp;7.1 shows an example of 
the associated cost/revenue matrix.
</p>
<p>Here, we assume the average cost per call is $5. 
Each positive responder (purchaser) will generate 
additional cost including administration work 
required to register him as a new customer and 
the cost of the delivered phone handset of, say, 
$100. Customers who respond positively will gen-
erate average revenue of $1000 a year. Putting all 
</p>
<p>7.3 &middot; The Data Mining Process</p>
<p/>

<p>142
</p>
<p>7
these factors together defines the cost/revenue 
decision matrix, which will subsequently have an 
impact, on the choice of model parameters such 
as the cut-off point for the selected model scores. 
It will also give business users an immediately 
interpretable table.
</p>
<p>Finally, we need to establish the criteria for 
evaluating the success of the campaign. This is a 
key aspect for the success or failure of the whole 
project. Often there is a misunderstanding on both 
sides&mdash;business and modelers&mdash;with respect to 
what is feasible from a business and statistical per-
spective. Clearly defining the expectations helps. If, 
for example, gaining market share is more impor-
tant than obtaining high purchase rates, the mea-
sure of success changes from &laquo;percentage of sold 
cards per contacted customer&raquo; to &laquo;absolute num-
ber of cards sold during the campaign.&raquo; In this 
context, it is crucial to specify how the campaign 
results will be tracked and analyzed. Depending on 
the type of business, how it is structured into cus-
</p>
<p>tomer segments, regions, products, and others, we 
could be interested in measuring purchase rates 
per region, per sales channels, per product type, 
and so on as a function of time. When we consider 
a situation where we have defined various target 
groups for different communication contents or 
product offers in one campaign, it is worth measur-
ing the purchase rates for each group.
</p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to look for a benchmark 
to compare results obtained in the past for the 
same or similar campaign setups using traditional 
targeting methods and not predictive models. We 
have to be careful when comparing the result of 
the old and new methods because there could be 
hidden differences due to different business (mar-
ket) conditions, changes in the products or 
 services, etc. In this chapter, we examine the 
French company Credite Est, a regional bank that 
implemented a data mining process. The follow-
ing example looks at how Credite Est defined its 
business objectives.

<p>Credite Est
</p>
<p>Credite Est (name disguised) is a 
</p>
<p>regional mid-tier bank in France, 
</p>
<p>serving roughly 600,000 custom-
</p>
<p>ers. The company, which has been 
</p>
<p>growing organically since its incep-
</p>
<p>tion in 1965, has a quantitative 
</p>
<p>approach to operations. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>the use of quantitative methods 
</p>
<p>in marketing via data mining is 
</p>
<p>second nature to the company. 
</p>
<p>The following example highlights 
</p>
<p>a specific data mining project of 
</p>
<p>the bank.
</p>
<p>As is typical for financial services 
</p>
<p>operations, the bank has a very 
</p>
<p>diverse set of customers in terms of 
</p>
<p>customer profitability. Besides using 
</p>
<p>a segmentation scheme based on 
</p>
<p>behavioral characteristics (e.g., 
</p>
<p>product ownership), the company 
</p>
<p>has an activity-based-costing sys-
</p>
<p>tem in place that allows individual 
</p>
<p>customer-level contribution mar-
</p>
<p>gins to be identified.
</p>
<p>The project in question had 
</p>
<p>the business goal to acquire new 
</p>
<p>prospects by using the technique 
</p>
<p>of profiling (see 7 Sect. 6.2.1). 
Specifically, the objective was 
</p>
<p>to identify the characteristics of 
</p>
<p>profitable customers in Credite 
</p>
<p>Est&rsquo;s mass-market segment. Once 
</p>
<p>these characteristics are more 
</p>
<p>closely identified, it could then 
</p>
<p>efficiently target similar profiles in 
</p>
<p>the prospect pool. The nature of 
</p>
<p>this project required the bank to 
</p>
<p>go beyond using firm-level data 
</p>
<p>because behavioral (transaction) 
</p>
<p>data are not available for prospects 
</p>

<p>7.3.4  Get Raw Data
</p>
<p>Now that we have gained a clear understanding of 
the business objectives, we need to translate them 
into data requirements (i.e., which data are avail-
able that appropriately and accurately describe the 
problem thereby allowing us to model the targeted 
behavior?) Once the required data has been identi-
fied, it has to be extracted and consolidated in a 
database (often called analytical data mart) so it is 
readily available for subsequent data manipulation 
and data mining steps. Another important step is 
to check the quality of the analytical raw data. This 
includes technical checks as well as ensuring the 
data make sense in the given business context and 
that correct deductions can be obtained.
</p>
<p>During this phase of the project (see 
. Fig.&nbsp; 7.6), database administrators and IT pro-
fessionals with knowledge of the data source sys-
tems will be asked to extract and provide all the 
data fields required for the data mining project. 
This is done in close cooperation with the data 
miners to ensure the extracted data corresponds 
to the initial requirements. Then, we also need to 
involve business resources to ensure and cross-
check data quality.
</p>
<p> Step 1: Looking for&nbsp;Data Sources
</p>
<p>To start the acquisition of raw data, we look into 
data sourcing, a mixed top-down and bottom-up 
process driven by business requirements (top) 
and technical restrictions (bottom). Its main 
objective consists of searching for available data 
sources in your company (or externally) which 
</p>
<p>describe the problem at hand. The availability of a 
data warehouse can sometimes speed up this pro-
cess. Conflicting and bad quality of addresses and 
other demographic information is quite common. 
For example, you might find the same or similar 
information field resides in various source sys-
tems, but with contradictory content (e.g., in one 
database the gender code for a given customer is 
&laquo;male&raquo; and in another database it is &laquo;female&raquo; for 
the same customer). Data warehouse infrastruc-
tures with advanced data cleansing processes can 
help ensure you are working with high-quality 
data. It is also a good idea to ask for small sample 
data extractions from the sources to examine if 
the information represents what you thought it 
would. Make sure that you talk to many people 
from business and data management to under-
stand which data sources are commonly used in 
certain contexts, but also to detect possible new 
sources that may contain valuable information. 
Collect all metadata available to fully understand 
data types, value ranges, and the primary/foreign 
key structures.
</p>
<p>Once there is a better understanding of the 
data sources that need to be loaded, build a (sim-
ple) relational data model onto which the source 
data will be mapped. This model should be kept as 
simple and as close to a business data model as 
possible. Even though this data model might not 
be perfectly suited for data mining and analysis, it 
is important that all involved groups have a clear 
understanding of the data. Later in the process we 
will denormalize (flatten) the model to enable 
easier data analysis and predictive modeling.

</p>

</p>
<p> Step 2: Loading the&nbsp;Data
</p>
<p>After specifying where and how the required data 
will be extracted, we still need to define further 
query restrictions because we might want to 
model only subsets of the full data (e.g., specific 
customer segments, geographical regions, time 
periods, etc.). Then it is time to request data man-
agement (IT) to deliver the specified data needs.2 
IT teams will prepare the necessary data queries, 
which will be executed during predefined time 
windows in batch mode (such as each night at 
midnight or each Sunday after completion of the 
accounting batch process).
</p>
<p>Depending on the data miner&rsquo;s needs they 
might also get direct asynchronous access to the 
data so they can run extractions when necessary. 
The extracted data are then delivered to the data 
mining environment in a predefined format such 
as database tables in native format, or simply flat 
files in ASCII or XML (text) format with fixed or 
variable record lengths. In fact, flat files are still the 
most commonly used format for data mining due 
to their simplicity, enhanced definition of system 
boundaries, and interfaces. Data miners define 
how the data will be imported into the data mining 
environment. Delivery using an ftp protocol is 
common, or data may also be put onto a common 
file server to be accessed directly through the net-
work. If a DB-link is preferred, a direct database 
connection from the data mining system to the 
source systems (or vice versa) will be established. 
After the data have been delivered to a defined 
landing area, they will be further processed and 
used to fill the previously defined data model in 
the data mining environment. The involved steps 
are part of the ETL process (Extract- Transform- 
Load) supported by dedicated software packages. 
Some data mining tools also offer quite advanced 
and comprehensive utilities for ETL.
</p>
<p> Step 3: Checking Data Quality
</p>
<p>It is often underestimated how seriously bad data 
quality may affect business decisions. According to 
Olson (2003) the costs of poor data quality are esti-
mated at 15&ndash;25% of operating profit, for example 
</p>
<p>2 Sometimes, obstacles such as lacking authorization of 
</p>
<p>the data mining team for accessing the required data 
</p>
<p>might emerge. Data miners frequently work with data 
</p>
<p>which other business departments do not have 
</p>
<p>access to. There is a high level of secrecy and trust 
</p>
<p>involved.
</p>
<p>through wrong inferences on customer attitudes, 
lost customers through poor services, or delays in 
delivering data to decision makers. We need to 
ensure that once the data for the data mining proj-
ect have been loaded, we assess and understand 
their limitations resulting from their inherent qual-
ity (good or bad) aspects. We have to create an ana-
lytical database that all involved parties (business, 
data mining, IT) feel comfortable with, as it is the 
basis for subsequent analyses. Only then can the 
generated customer insights be trusted and applied 
in practice with maximum confidence regarding 
their effect on the organization.
</p>
<p>Data quality crucially depends on the intended 
use and the data itself. Relevant aspects of data 
quality are:
</p>
<p> 5 Accuracy (consistency and validity)
 5 Relevance
 5 Completeness
 5 Reliability
</p>
<p>I.e., when checking data quality, we focus not 
only on technical aspects of the data (primary 
keys, duplicate records, missing values, etc.) but 
also on quality issues related to the business 
context (a customer should not be 200&nbsp;years old 
or have a future birth date, customers should 
not be purchasing nonexisting or expired prod-
ucts, etc.).
</p>
<p>A preliminary data quality assessment is car-
ried out to ensure an acceptable level of quality of 
the delivered data and to ensure the data mining 
team has a clear understanding of how to interpret 
the data in business terms. All parties&mdash;business, 
data mining, and IT&mdash;are involved in this impor-
tant task. Thus, the data available for the mining 
project must be analyzed to answer to the follow-
ing questions: (1) Does the data correspond to the 
original sourcing requirements? (2) Is the quality 
sufficient? and (3) Do we understand the data?
</p>
<p>Several iterations of data extractions may be 
necessary to satisfy the data requirements. The data 
miner represents the link between business and IT 
demands. Miscommunication between business 
and IT can lead to incorrect data extractions.
</p>
<p>As already mentioned, data should have suffi-
cient quality for achieving the project&rsquo;s objectives. 
A data field does not always have a clearly defined 
meaning (although available metadata might 
 initially give you that impression). Sometimes the 
information it carries is different from its official 
description. This is a consequence of the accumu-

<p>CRM at Work 7.2
Gathering Raw Data at Credite Est
</p>
<p>The response variable for current 
</p>
<p>customers is customer contribution 
</p>
<p>margin. The company sorted cus-
</p>
<p>tomers by operating contribution 
</p>
<p>and chose to profile the top 20% 
</p>
<p>of them. Transaction information is 
</p>
<p>not available for prospects. This is 
</p>
<p>why the bank has to rely on infor-
</p>
<p>mation available for both existing 
</p>
<p>customers and prospects. One type 
</p>
<p>of information is geodemographic 
</p>
<p>data, such as socioeconomic status 
</p>
<p>of a region, average age, type of 
</p>
<p>housing, and so on. They can be 
</p>
<p>purchased from direct marketing 
</p>
<p>agencies and then appended to 
</p>
<p>individual records of existing cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. That is, depending on ZIP 
</p>
<p>code, geodemographic informa-
</p>
<p>tion is added to existing customer 
</p>
<p>records. The model attempts to 
</p>
<p>predict customer operating margin 
</p>
<p>as the dependent variable with 
</p>
<p>geodemographic information as 
</p>
<p>the independent variables. The 
</p>
<p>rationale behind this process is to 
</p>
<p>find the profile that best character-
</p>
<p>izes high-value clients, which is 
</p>
<p>subsequently applied to prospects&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>information. Credite Est appended 
</p>
<p>a total of 65 variables to existing 
</p>
<p>customer records. They were pro-
</p>
<p>cured from the French list manager 
</p>
<p>CIFEA, as well as from Claritas.
</p>
<p>lation of undocumented system changes over 
many years. Another common issue is missing 
data, which means that in some cases (i.e., for 
some records) a data field is not filled. We might 
also find wrong or contradictory information in a 
data field.
</p>
<p>Finally, data miners must demonstrate they 
understand the data. To this end, it is useful to 
have them carry out some basic data interpreta-
tion and aggregation exercises where two things 
can be shown: (1) the data quality and (2) the abil-
ity to correctly interpret the data. As simple data 
interpretation examples, consider correctly 
counting the number of customers per region, 
customer segment, product ownership, total 
transaction volume per time periods, etc. Choose 
to include aggregations familiar to the business 
group and that can be easily cross-checked. We 
see an example of getting and combining data in 
7 CRM at Work 7.2 a further study of Credite Est.
</p>
<p>Since the objective is to acquire prospects 
likely to be high-value customers, Credite Est 
must rely on customer characteristics common to 
both customers (the basis for establishing the 
critical profile) and the prospects (scored on the 
basis of their profile). For a more detailed descrip-
tion of the profiling process see 7 Sect. 6.2.1.
</p>
<p>7.3.5  Identify Relevant Predictive 
Variables
</p>
<p>The raw data, now available for analysis, is not yet 
in a format suited to powerful predictive model-
ing. This is due to data formatting aspects, since 
the sourced data are still in a relational format, and 
do not yet represent a customer-centric view. 
During this step (see . Fig.&nbsp;7.7), we will (1) create 
</p>
<p>a flattened view of the extracted raw data aggregat-
ing all facts about the customer behavior over time 
in a single observation (also called record or row). 
Also, it is a good practice to include a priori busi-
ness knowledge by (2) creating new analytical 
variables which might have predictive power. This 
part will require imagination and participation 
from the business group. As a result, we might end 
up with thousands of variables describing each 
customer. Further analysis is likely to reveal that 
most variables do not possess predictive power at 
all. Therefore, we will (3) identify and select only 
those few variables with sufficient explanatory 
power for the modeled target behavior.
</p>
<p> Step 1: Create Analytical Customer 
View: Flattening the&nbsp;Data
</p>
<p>In the context of CRM, very often the individual 
customer is the central object analyzed by means of 
data mining. All data available for an individual cus-
tomer must be gathered and consolidated because 
the individual customer constitutes an observational 
unit for data analysis and predictive modeling. The 
historical behavior of customers is obtained from 
the corresponding data queries in a time series&ndash;ori-
ented relational transaction database.
</p>
<p>Usually, we choose a simple, flat data model as 
the basis for predictive modeling. In this repre-
sentation all data pertaining to an individual cus-
tomer are contained in one observation (row, 
record). Individual columns (variables, fields) 
represent the conditions at specific points in time 
or a summary over a whole period. Creating such 
a customer view requires denormalizing the orig-
inal relational data structures (flattening). This 
task will involve data miners to define the details 
of the flattening process and use IT resources to 
obtain the targeted form of data.
</p>
<p>7.3 &middot; The Data Mining Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>146
</p>
<p>7
</p>
<p>The business objectives for the data mining 
project determine which features of the customer&rsquo;s 
record need to be aggregated from the analytical 
raw data and how. The detail levels for calculating 
grouped sums (e.g., sum of monthly cash with-
drawals from a bank account) and counts (e.g., 
number of address changes within a certain year) 
need to be defined. This includes specification of 
the temporal granularity of the time series in the 
flattened data table. Descriptive statistics such as 
sums, mean, median, and standard deviation will 
be employed to capture features of the related time 
series. As an example, consider raw data describ-
ing 1&nbsp;year of customer transactions and create four 
new variables containing the average transaction 
volume per quarter. Different kinds of global 
transformations, combinations, or arithmetical 
operations can also be applied to selected variables 
such as currency exchange calculations, scaling 
factors, logarithmic transforms, and so on. Many 
new variables will be created through these types 
of operations, leading to very wide data tables. 
Later, we will use the newly created variables in 
addition to the raw data variables as predictors 
during the predictive modeling step.
</p>
<p>Another key variable to be created during this 
step is the target or dependent variable. Its correct 
definition is extremely important for predictive 
modeling. In the example of modeling customer 
defection, a target value of zero is assigned if the 
customer was still maintaining a business rela-
tionship and a target value of one if the customer 
already terminated the business relationship. The 
definition of the target variable is not always as 
</p>
<p>straightforward as it might seem. In the previous 
examples, we could also think about a customer 
who is inactive since a defined time period as a 
lost customer. There might be a multitude of busi-
ness rules specifying the conditions under which 
the target variable is either one or zero. Once 
we&rsquo;ve found a satisfactory definition of the target 
variable, its values should be generated for all cus-
tomers and added to the existing data tables.
</p>
<p> Step 2: Create Analytical Variables
</p>
<p>The basic set of variables resulting from the previous 
flattening might not be enough to fully explore the 
data potential for predictive  modeling. We might 
want to introduce additional variables derived from 
the original ones. For example, consider a variable 
resulting from the product of customer age and sal-
ary. This is often referred to as an interaction term. 
Transforming variables is another operation that 
might lead to new and more predictive variables. We 
could transform customer birth date into age, or use 
the number of days between two customer transac-
tions instead of the absolute dates of each transac-
tion. Variable binning (or categorization) is also 
often encountered. Here we take highly skewed vari-
ables (such as salary) and map the distribution to a 
few discrete classes such as low, medium, and high 
salary, each defined by its boundary values. More 
refined methods help to increase normality of vari-
able distributions, which in turn help the predictive 
model training process. Many data mining tools 
provide support for increasing normality of the ana-
lytical variables. Finally, missing value management 
is key for enhancing the quality of the data set.

</p>
<p>Numerous methods are available, including deleting 
each row with at least one missing value (the least 
preferred strategy), replacing a missing field with a 
constant value, randomly generating a value based 
on the variable&rsquo;s distribution, and randomly generat-
ing a value based on the variable&rsquo;s correlation with 
the other variables (such as the expectation maximi-
zation algorithm).
</p>
<p> Step 3: Select Predictive Variables
</p>
<p>At this point, we have a wealth of variables describ-
ing customer behavior; probably too many to enter 
the subsequent modeling phase of the data mining 
project. We now need to reduce the dimensionality 
(i.e., exclude variables) to get a more parsimonious 
model. Presenting all predictor variables to a neu-
ral network, for instance, might make the model-
ing phase extremely time consuming and 
sometimes results in overfitting, i.e., the model 
gives good results on the training data (in sample) 
but fails to be generally applicable to previously 
unseen data (out of sample). Exclusion of variables 
is usually possible without deteriorating the pre-
dictive power of the obtained models since many 
variables have no predictive power at all. To this 
end we inspect the descriptive statistics of all uni-
variate distributions associated to all available vari-
ables. We can immediately exclude those variables, 
which take on only one value (i.e., the variable is a 
constant), since they will certainly not have any 
predictive power. We might also exclude variables 
with mostly missing values. A threshold missing 
value count level should be defined above which 
the field would be excluded from further analysis.
</p>
<p>Variables directly or indirectly identifying an 
individual customer represent another type of 
</p>
<p>candidate for exclusion. Examples are primary 
keys such as the customer ID number or name and 
address fields. Later, when deploying predictive 
models (i.e., when scoring customers), identifiers 
will usually be required. Otherwise you would not 
know whom to address with an offering. In some 
cases, collinear predictive variables can have a 
negative impact on the convergence and perfor-
mance of the estimation process of certain types of 
models such as logistic regression. These collin-
earities must be identified and the respective vari-
ables excluded before proceeding. Finally, we also 
exclude variables showing little correlation with 
the target variable. To identify them we may carry 
out pair-wise chi-square tests, linear correlation 
analyses, or pair-wise simple linear regressions. 
Other frequently used techniques to support the 
variable selection process are histograms, scatter 
plots, box plots, and frequency tables.
</p>
<p>Also notice that excluding variables from fur-
ther processing does not automatically imply that 
the respective columns are deleted from the data 
sets. It could only mean flagging the respective 
columns to be temporarily ignored for further 
analysis. The exclusion should be easily reversible 
to readily test other variable scenario selections.
</p>
<p>Before concluding the variable selection step, 
we should carefully check if all variables have 
been mapped to the appropriate data types. Some 
data fields might represent the data in an inappro-
priate format (e.g., ZIP codes stored as numerical 
integer variables should rather be categorical (or 
nominal) for the purpose of data mining, unless 
you have a ZIP code-based distance measure 
associated for your analysis). The following exam-
ple examines this issue.
</p>

Identifying Relevant Variables at 
</p>
<p>Credite Est
</p>
<p>Upon creating a single data file 
</p>
<p>including all appended informa-
</p>
<p>tion, the next step is to start with 
</p>
<p>exploratory analyses. A key concern 
</p>
<p>with appended data is the amount 
</p>
<p>of potentially missing informa-
</p>
<p>tion. All appended variables had 
</p>
<p>almost 50% missing data. The next 
</p>
<p>step was to assess whether the 
</p>
<p>missing data could be meaning-
</p>
<p>fully replaced. These operations 
</p>
<p>improved the overall rate of missing 
</p>
<p>values from 42% to 21%. The next 
</p>
<p>step was to investigate univariate 
</p>
<p>statistics (means, standard devia-
</p>
<p>tions, frequencies, outliers) for all 
</p>
<p>variables to ensure the included 
</p>
<p>variables have sufficient integrity. 
</p>
<p>This step brought a reduction in 
</p>
<p>variables from 65 to 54. The next 
</p>
<p>step was to calculate all bivariate 
</p>
<p>correlations (or mean analyses in 
</p>
<p>case of categorical variables) of the 
</p>
<p>existing independent variables with 
</p>
<p>the dependent variable&mdash;customer 
</p>
<p>value. This was an iterative process 
</p>
<p>where independent variables were 
</p>
<p>subjected to transformations and 
</p>
<p>where new variables were created. 
</p>
<p>For example, there were three 
</p>
<p>variables which indicated whether 
</p>
<p>a household has children in age 
</p>
<p>brackets 0&ndash;4, 5&ndash;11, and 12&ndash;18. 
</p>
<p>From that, a new variable was cre-
</p>
<p>ated that was a simple dummy indi-
</p>
<p>cator: children versus no children. 
</p>
<p>In the end, this data evaluation 
</p>
<p>process resulted in a total of 17 vari-
</p>
<p>ables that had a reasonable correla-
</p>
<p>tion with the dependent variable. 
</p>
<p>These were retained for the next 
</p>
<p>step, the response model.

</p>
<p>7.3.6  Gain Customer Insight
</p>
<p>Once we have obtained a credible, good-quality 
set of descriptive data (i.e., we have prepared the 
data samples), the next step is to extract the 
knowledge about customer behavior and/or other 
properties needed for carrying out the planned 
campaign through predictive modeling (see 
. Fig.&nbsp;7.8).
</p>
<p>Frequently, we distinguish between different 
types of predictive models obtained through 
different modeling paradigms: supervised and 
unsupervised modeling. In the case where we 
want to predict the likelihood of a customer pur-
chasing a certain product, we would build a pre-
dictive model on a predefined test set containing 
customers who already purchased the product 
and customers who did not. In this case, we are 
applying the supervised learning paradigm, 
because for each customer in the modeling data 
set we know the correct answer to the question, 
i.e., did the customer purchase or not?
</p>
<p>Building a model means finding the right rela-
tionships between the variables describing the 
customers to predict their respective group mem-
bership likelihood: purchaser or non-purchaser. 
This is usually also referred to as scoring (e.g., 
between 0 and 1). Since we know the purchase 
behavior for each customer in the train set, we can 
also measure the model&rsquo;s prediction quality, i.e., 
its misclassification rate (see 7 Sect. 6.3.1). A dif-
ferent situation arises in the context, for instance, 
of a customer segmentation problem. Suppose 
you want to identify groups of customers having a 
similar general behavior, not only with respect to 
purchase behavior. In the beginning you don&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>know which groups will be identified. It is a pro-
cess purely driven by the data and relationships 
between variables. Here, we would apply unsu-
pervised modeling where group membership is 
not known beforehand. We&rsquo;re looking for new 
and unexpected patterns. Typical examples of sta-
tistical models in this context are self-organizing 
neural networks (Kohonen networks) and clus-
tering algorithms.3
</p>
<p>The output of this project phase can either 
consist in the predictive model itself, which is 
later applied in an online production environ-
ment (i.e., to predict next product recommenda-
tions for customers calling a call center), or 
directly in the customer score values (e.g., to 
select all customers with a score value above 90% 
purchase likelihood and send them a direct mail).
</p>
<p> Step 1: Preparing Data Samples
</p>
<p>Before we start building (or training) the models, 
it is necessary to analyze if sufficient data are 
available to obtain statistically significant results. 
</p>
<p>3 Kohonen networks belong to the family of neural 
</p>
<p>network techniques. These are powerful data 
</p>
<p>modeling tools able to capture and represent 
</p>
<p>complex input/output relationships for example in 
</p>
<p>target marketing, financial forecasting, or process 
</p>
<p>control. In particular, the objective of a Kohonen 
</p>
<p>network is to generate, out of complex input patterns 
</p>
<p>of arbitrary dimension, a simplified (discrete) map 
</p>

</p>
<p>There are cases where there is only very little data 
available such as when modeling purchase behav-
ior for a recently introduced product, with only 
very few customers having bought the product 
until now. If we have enough data available we 
split the data into two samples: the train set to fit 
the models and the test set to check the model&rsquo;s 
performance on observations that have not been 
used to build it. This will give an objective assess-
ment of the model&rsquo;s generalization capability&mdash;a 
critical requirement before launching a product 
or campaign.
</p>
<p> Step 2: Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>There are two steps of predictive modeling:
 5 The rules (or linear/nonlinear analytical 
</p>
<p>models) are built based on a training set.
 5 These rules are then applied to a new dataset 
</p>
<p>for generating the answers needed for the 
campaign.
</p>
<p>Based on the training set, we develop predictive 
models that should minimize the prediction error. 
In the course of this process a set of optimal model 
parameters are obtained. Usually, several alterna-
tive models are trained together, applying differ-
ent statistical methodologies such as neural 
networks, linear or logistic regression, survival 
analysis, principal component analysis, factor 
analysis, decision trees, or clustering.
</p>
<p> Step 3: Select Model
</p>
<p>When all alternative models have been trained, 
we start comparing their relative quality of pre-
diction by comparing their respective misclassifi-
cation rates (see 7 Sect. 6.3.1) obtained on the test 
set or by performing a lift analysis (see 7 Sect. 
</p>
<p>6.3.2). Some models will have more predictive 
power than others, and we will select the model 
we think generalizes best from the train to the test 
data.
</p>
<p>We will also include the economic implica-
tions of a model by applying the previously 
defined cost/revenue matrix. Predictive models, 
for instance, deliver a score value, or likelihood, 
for each customer to show the modeled target 
behavior (e.g., purchase of a credit card). 
Nevertheless, determining the threshold level 
score to use for a given campaign is a business 
decision. It could be that you want to set it to the 
break-even point (see 7 Sect. 6.1.1), or you may 
have a fixed budget for the campaign you want to 
fully use. This might lead to lowering the thresh-
old until the point where your costs equal the 
budget. We continue to look at this issue in the 
following example.
</p>
<p>7.3.7  Act
</p>
<p>The final objective of a data mining project should 
be to act on its results (see . Fig.&nbsp;7.9). Sometimes 
we also refer to this as deployment of the results. 
This is crucial to the success of the whole project. 
The planning phase of the project must have 
addressed the issue of implementing the project&rsquo;s 
results into the respective business processes. The 
project plan must foresee involvement and avail-
ability of IT resources required to feed data min-
ing results back into the process supporting IT 
systems (databases, Web sites, call centers, etc.). 
In practice, deployment can have numerous 
applications: score-based selection of customers 
to be addressed through a direct mailing cam-

</p>
<p>The methodology chosen by the 
</p>
<p>modelers was logistic regression. 
</p>
<p>Since the goal was to either target 
</p>
<p>or not target a certain individual 
</p>
<p>in the prospect pool, classifying 
</p>
<p>the dependent variable as 0/1 was 
</p>
<p>appropriate. In the previous step, 
</p>
<p>only those variables were retained 
</p>
<p>with a minimum level of bivariate 
</p>
<p>correlation. However, now the issue 
</p>
<p>of multicollinearity came into play. 
</p>
<p>Multicollinearity occurs when two 
</p>
<p>variables convey essentially the 
</p>
<p>same information, making one of 
</p>
<p>them redundant. Thus, an important 
</p>
<p>step was to make a theory-based 
</p>
<p>elimination of those highly collinear 
</p>
<p>variables. The final model was cho-
</p>
<p>sen on grounds of predictive ability 
</p>
<p>while containing a low number of 
</p>
<p>missing values. It contained five pre-
</p>
<p>dictors of customer value: bourgeois 
</p>
<p>cluster, technology cluster, children 
</p>
<p>index, house value index, and 
</p>
<p>managerial job position. The ability 
</p>
<p>of the model to correctly classify 
</p>
<p>was 75.5% in the estimation sample 
</p>
<p>and 69.8% in the holdout sample, 
</p>
<p>i.e., roughly 20% points higher than 
</p>
<p>based on chance alone. This result 
</p>
<p>was deemed successful, and thus it 
</p>
<p>was decided to utilize this model for 
</p>
<p>a prospecting campaign.

paign, score-based next-product recommenda-
tion on an e-commerce Web site, optimization of 
marketing spending according to the model- 
based customer lifetime value prediction, choice 
of the appropriate communication channel for 
each customer, and so on.
</p>
<p>In particular, acting can be subdivided into 
delivering results to operational systems, 
archiving the results, and learning.
</p>
<p> Step 1: Deliver Results to&nbsp;Operational 
Systems
</p>
<p>The final goal of prognostic modeling within the 
context of CRM is to select a subset of customers 
for a campaign to determine which customers are 
more likely to be responsive than others. To iden-
tify this subset, we apply the selected model to the 
entire customer base (unless restrictions have 
been previously defined limiting the total uni-
verse of modeled and targeted customers, such as 
geographical regions, a subset of customer seg-
ments, etc.). The obtained score value for each 
customer and the defined threshold value will 
determine whether the corresponding customer 
qualifies to participate in the campaign. We can 
either deploy the customer scores or, alternately, 
the scoring model itself, which implies that it is 
applied on demand&mdash;for example, when a cus-
tomer calls the call center or visits the company&rsquo;s 
Web site.
</p>
<p>Before scoring customers we need to prepare 
the score data set containing the most recent 
information available for each customer with the 
</p>
<p>variables required by the model. This implies that 
the score set variables go through exactly the 
same variable transformation, derivation, and 
selection process as did the train and test data sets 
used for building the model. Data recency is an 
important requirement because otherwise we are 
scoring customers based on old information, 
which may, in turn, lead to wrong conclusions.
</p>
<p>Imagine we are scoring customers for a direct 
mail campaign to sell a credit card to all those cus-
tomers not yet owning one. If the scoring data are 
not reasonably current, we might be scoring cus-
tomers although they have recently purchased a 
credit card and potentially (if the model works 
well) include them in your target group. As a 
result, we end up offering these customers a prod-
uct they have just purchased, giving a rather poor 
image of how much our company knows about its 
customers.
</p>
<p>Finally, when delivering the results to the 
operational systems, make sure to also provide 
the necessary customer identifiers required by 
those systems to unambiguously link the models 
score information to the correct customer.
</p>
<p> Step 2: Archive Results
</p>
<p>The data mining group is responsible for archiving 
all information related to each data mining proj-
ect it executes. This is an important and often 
neglected or poorly followed piece of advice. 
Companies that do not archive their models can-
not expect to learn from past experience as fast as 
those who do.

</p>
<p>Each data mining project will produce a huge 
amount of information:
</p>
<p> 5 Raw data used
 5 Transformations for each variable
 5 Formulas for creating derived variables
 5 Train, test, and score data sets
 5 Target variable calculation
 5 Models and their parameterizations
 5 Score threshold levels
 5 Final customer target selections
</p>
<p>Knowing this information and having it readily 
available helps in understanding anomalies in 
model performance, and in learning what worked 
well and what did not (and why). It is also useful to 
preserve the details of the model when scoring has 
been done. The same model might be used to score 
different data sets obtained at different times.
</p>
<p> Step 3: Learn
</p>
<p>Learning from a data mining project is an integral 
part of the process. This is also sometimes referred 
to as closing the loop. It means learning from the 
actions you have executed to improve perfor-
mance the next time. To learn from the data min-
ing project, we must first obtain the facts 
describing its performance and business impact. 
In the ideal case, we would provide return on 
investment figures for the data mining project at 
hand.
</p>
<p>Usually these facts are obtained by monitor-
ing the campaign performance while it is run-
ning and from the final campaign performance 
analysis after the campaign has ended. Campaign 
monitoring is an important capability the data 
mining group must provide, since it avoids blind 
</p>
<p>piloting of the campaign until its end, without 
any intermediate performance feedback. In rap-
idly changing environments, it is also required 
for detecting when a model should be retrained. 
Usually, monitoring provides some key perfor-
mance indicators, such as the response and/or 
purchase rates by region, customer segment, 
product, and so on. These parameters will give 
early indication of undesired irregularities in 
model performance and enable early interven-
tion. The final campaign performance analysis 
will produce similar performance indicators as 
the monitoring function. The main difference is 
that it is more complete and has a determined 
final time horizon of influence. This is required to 
ensure a correct measurement of the cause and 
effect of a campaign. It would, for instance, be 
unrealistic to positively attribute advertising to a 
customer&rsquo;s behavior when the customer pur-
chases a product 1&nbsp;year after seeing the advertise-
ment of a direct mail campaign.
</p>
<p>Sample learnings from campaign evaluation 
could be:
</p>
<p> 5 Revealing that purchase rates depend on the 
choice of the communication channel.
</p>
<p> 5 Discovering that a direct mail with a colorful 
and detailed product brochure sells less than 
one with a black and white one-page flyer.
</p>
<p>Thus, the learning step requires data miners to 
generate the facts about campaign performance, 
and business resources to put them in context for 
correct interpretation. Our study of Credite Est 
concludes with the following example, showing 
how the company acted on the information it 
gleaned in the data mining process.

<p>The final model was rolled out in 
</p>
<p>a sequential fashion to the target 
</p>
<p>prospect audience. The goal was to 
</p>
<p>iteratively refine the model in future 
</p>
<p>rounds. As a first step, Credite Est 
</p>
<p>purchased addresses from list bro-
</p>
<p>kers that had nonmissing values for 
</p>
<p>at least three out of five variables 
</p>
<p>in the final model. The prospects 
</p>
<p>were scored with the model and 
</p>
<p>then ranked by likelihood of being 
</p>
<p>a high-value customer. From the 
</p>
<p>resulting pool of 10,000 prospects, 
</p>
<p>half were targeted with a money-
</p>
<p>market product, and halfwith a 
</p>
<p>lending product. The objective 
</p>
<p>was to assess the receptivity of 
</p>
<p>the two samples for the respective 
</p>
<p>products. In addition, a baseline 
</p>
<p>scenario was conducted whereby 
</p>
<p>the same prospecting campaigns 
</p>
<p>were conducted for a random sam-
</p>
<p>ple of households. Although both

<p>target mailings were significantly 
</p>
<p>more successful than the baseline 
</p>
<p>scenario, this was only the first 
</p>
<p>step in a further refinement of the 
</p>
<p>model and the offer. In particular, 
</p>
<p>besides assessing response rate, 
</p>
<p>it was now important to track and 
</p>
<p>document the value of the acquired 
</p>
<p>customers&mdash;the original goal of the

</p>
<p>A comprehensive example of an application of 
data mining is given in the case study, which is 
taking a look at Yapi Kredi, a company that put 
the data mining tools to use to create a cross- 
selling campaign.
</p>
<p> The Challenge
</p>
<p>To continue Yapi Kredi&rsquo;s development as the 
fastest- growing retail bank in Turkey, in terms of 
assets under management and retail profitability, 
it targets to maintain anintimate banking rela-
tionship with the top customer segment to fully 
explore the potential of its 5+ million customer 
base, and to increase the contract per customer 
ratio to five.
</p>
<p>To this end, Yapi Kredi introduced a modern 
retail banking approach to enable serving all 
customers according to their specific needs 
through individual product packages. The capa-
bilities required to achieve these goals were as 
follows:
</p>
<p> 5 Advanced analytical customer segmentation.
 5 Segment-specific offering of product 
</p>
<p>bundles.
 5 Conversion of customers to more profit-
</p>
<p>able segments via targeted campaigns using 
advanced CRM tools such as predictive 
modeling.
</p>
<p> Solution
</p>
<p>To increase the product per customer ratio, to 
attract new money from customers, and to dem-
onstrate the efficacy of the new analytical CRM 
methods, Yapi Kredi decided to carry out a set 
of pilot projects for cross-selling of consumer 
</p>
<p>banking products. A reduced selection of target 
customers with a high propensity to positively 
respond would be included in a multichannel, 
two-step campaign. To illustrate the methodology 
we briefly describe the outcomes of the various 
project phases.
</p>
<p>Define Business Objectives
</p>
<p>Various cross-departmental workshops were held 
to define the business objectives, operational 
aspects of campaign execution, the basics of rele-
vant data availability, and to measure the success 
of the campaign.
</p>
<p>The first step was to find which product would 
be best suited for cross selling from a customer 
and bank perspective. After a deep analysis of 
potential products to be offered during this first 
predictive model based cross-selling campaign, it 
was decided to choose Yapi Kredi&rsquo;s B-type mutual 
funds, characterized by being low risk investment 
instruments based on fixed income securities. 
These funds can be easily purchased via the ATM, 
Web, and telephone channels.
</p>
<p>Cross selling these mutual funds was consid-
ered to have a twofold positive business impact. It 
served the purpose of acquiring new money from 
customers, and even those customers transferring 
their existing investments from other Yapi Kredi 
products into mutual funds (cannibalization 
effect) was still considered beneficial to the bank. 
It was decided to offer this product to both cus-
tomer groups:
</p>
<p> 5 Customers already having invested into 
B-type mutual funds to stimulate an increase 
of the assets.
</p>
<p> 5 Customers not yet owning any B-type fund 
to help increase product ratio and attract new 
money.
</p>
<p>After fixing the product details, it had to be 
defined how the campaign would be carried out. 
The workshops helped define the start and end 
date of the campaign: a total duration of 5&nbsp;weeks 
was considered appropriate. Communication 
channels for offering the product were agreed 
upon. A two-channel approach was deemed fea-
sible since Yapi Kredi had just finished the imple-
mentation of a project integrating the call center 
and the bank&rsquo;s branch network. These were con-
sidered the right channels for the campaign.
</p>
<p>Given the pilot project character of the cam-
paign and the available resources, it had been

</p>
<p>decided to contact 3000 customers based on out- 
bound calls and active marketing during cus-
tomer branch visits. A total of 16 branches in the 
Istanbul area were selected for participation in the 
campaign. Additionally, 1200 target customers 
were to be contacted by the call center.
</p>
<p>It was decided to run a two-step campaign, 
where customers were first contacted with the 
B-type mutual fund offer. Then, positive respond-
ers received a follow-up call if they had not pur-
chased 1&nbsp;week after their initial positive response.
</p>
<p>Response and purchase rates by contact chan-
nel (branch or call centre) were chosen as mea-
sures of the campaign&rsquo;s success.
</p>
<p>Get Raw Data
</p>
<p>A data mart was developed for supporting the activ-
ities of the CRM department. To this end, data were 
extracted from more than 50 source system tables. 
About 20 database tables were produced with 30 
gigabytes of disk space for the initial project phase. 
The data mart included data most urgently needed 
for high-priority business activities (such as the 
pilot campaign) and assured that the data are read-
ily available in a short time frame for subsequent 
data manipulation and data mining steps.
</p>
<p>Identify Relevant Variables
</p>
<p>Various aggregations and transformations were 
required to obtain the right customer-centric data 
format as needed for analysis and predictive mod-
eling. Basic data-quality crosschecks were per-
formed to assure the validity of the data and its 
suitability for further data mining activities.
</p>
<p>Different types of attributes were found to be 
relevant and used to obtain a complete picture of 
customer behavior and preferences. These 
included the following customer attributes:
</p>
<p> 5 Demographics: Age, gender, marital status, 
group memberships, address, profession, and 
other identifying characteristics belong in 
this category.
</p>
<p> 5 Product ownership: This relates to product 
portfolio held by each customer, opening/
closing dates, derived variables related to 
customer&rsquo;s tenure such as maximum tenure of 
owned products, and so on.
</p>
<p> 5 Product usage: Variables are related to a 
customer&rsquo;s frequency of usage such as the 
average number of banking transactions.
</p>
<p> 5 Channel usage: Variables are related to cus-
tomer&rsquo;s automatic payment behavior,average 
</p>
<p>amount of automatic payments, ratios of dif-
ferent channels&rsquo; usage, and so on.
</p>
<p> 5 Assets: Variables are related to savings and 
investment products such as the average 
balance invested in securities, time deposits, 
demand deposits, and so on.
</p>
<p> 5 Liabilities: Variables are related to loan usage 
such as average balance on loans, average bal-
ance on credit cards, and so on.
</p>
<p> 5 Profitability: For the pilot project, a profit-
ability index was created, since profitability 
was not available for all customers at that 
time. The index was used for ranking custom-
ers according to their profitability without 
giving its absolute value.
</p>
<p>Gain Customer Insight
</p>
<p>Based on 6&nbsp;months of historical customer data, five 
different predictive models were developed to esti-
mate a customer&rsquo;s propensity to invest in a B-type 
mutual fund during the following 3-month period. 
The best model was found to be a logistic regres-
sion yielding a lift value of 2.9 for the top customer 
decile. The lift value measures the effect of the pre-
dictive model (see 7 Sect. 6.3.2), and expresses the 
fact that in this case the logistic regression reaches 
2.9 times more responders for the top customer 
decile than a random selection of the same size.
</p>
<p>All customers were then scored using this 
model, and a set of 4200 customers with the high-
est propensity to purchase was selected as the tar-
get group for the pilot campaign.
</p>
<p>Act
</p>
<p>To roll out the campaign through the call center and 
the branches, each channel had to know exactly 
which customer to contact. Each channel needed a 
clear assignment of their respective target customers. 
A subset of 3000 customers was assigned to the 16 
branches holding the responsibility for the respective 
relationships. The remaining 1200 customers were 
assigned to the call center. The target list with the cor-
responding channel assignment was then made 
available to the campaign management system. After 
preparing call scripts and training the staff involved 
in its execution, the campaign could start.
</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the results 
(. Table&nbsp; 7.2). Impressive response rates of 6.5% 
and 12.2%, respectively, were obtained with the 
branch-based and call-center-based part of the 
campaign. The pilot campaign could acquire more 
than &euro;1 million into B-type mutual funds.

</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe that although the 
branches obtained a lower response rate than the 
call center, they still acquired significantly more 
investment into the funds. This reflects the advan-
tages of the more personal branch-based cus-
tomer relationship. As a consequence of this 
successful pilot campaign, a large-scale rollout to 
a larger part of Yapi Kredi&rsquo;s customers looked very 
promising.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>Data mining can assist in selecting the right 
</p>
<p>target customers or in identifying previously 
</p>
<p>unknown customers with similar behavior and 
</p>
<p>needs. A good target list is likely to increase pur-
</p>
<p>chase rates and have a positive impact on rev-
</p>
<p>enue. A complete data mining process comprises 
</p>
<p>assessing and specifying the business objectives, 
</p>
<p>data sourcing, transformation and creation of 
</p>
<p>analytical variables, as well as building analyti-
</p>
<p>cal models using techniques such as logistic 
</p>
<p>regression or neural networks. The number of 
</p>
<p>variables used changes drastically during the 
</p>
<p>data mining process. Types of row manipulation 
</p>
<p>include aggregation, change, missing value, and 
</p>
<p>outlier detection. Profitable customer acquisition 
</p>
<p>requires modeling of expected customer poten-
</p>
<p>tial over the lifetime of the business relationship. 
</p>
<p>In a cross-selling or up-selling model, we try to 
</p>
<p>predict the customer&rsquo;s affinity with a set of prod-
</p>
<p>ucts or services translated into the customer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>purchase likelihood.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of the campaign that should 
</p>
<p>be defined is the set of business or selection 
</p>
<p>rules for a campaign, which specifies the custom-
</p>
<p>ers who should be excluded from or included in 
</p>
<p>the target groups. To measure how the model 
</p>
<p>based selection is performing with respect to 
</p>
<p>the average customer behavior, the target group 
</p>
<p>can be split into various cells like the control 
</p>
<p>group&mdash; containing only randomly selected 
</p>
<p>customers and another cell containing only the 
</p>
<p>best customers according to the implemented 
</p>
<p>model. It is helpful to define a cost/revenue 
</p>
<p>matrix describing how the business mechanics 
</p>
<p>will work in the supported campaign and how it 
</p>
<p>will impact the data mining process.
</p>
<p>Once, the required data have been identi-
</p>
<p>fied, extracted and consolidated, so that the 
</p>
<p>data in a database (often also called analytical 
</p>
<p>data mart) are readily available for subsequent 
</p>
<p>data manipulation and data mining steps. 
</p>
<p>Another important step is to check the qual-
</p>
<p>ity of the analytical raw data. Data warehouse 
</p>
<p>infrastructures with advanced data cleansing 
</p>
<p>processes can help ensure you are working with 
</p>
<p>high-quality data. Missing value management 
</p>
<p>is a key element for enhancing the data quality. 
</p>
<p>A preliminary data quality assessment is car-
</p>
<p>ried out to assure a good level of quality of the 
</p>
<p>delivered data, and that the data mining team 
</p>
<p>has a clear understanding of how to interpret 
</p>
<p>the data in business terms.
</p>
<p>It is important to identify and select only 
</p>
<p>those variables with good explanatory power 
</p>
<p>(relevant predictive power) for the modeled 
</p>
<p>target behavior. Different methods are employed 
</p>
<p>for selecting the predictor variables. These 
</p>
<p>methods help us drop collinear variables and 
</p>
<p>those with very low correlation with the target 
</p>
<p>variable. In the context of Customer Manage-
</p>
<p>ment, very often the individual customer is the 
</p>
<p>central object analyzed by means of data mining 
</p>
<p>methods. Usually a very simple, flat data model 
</p>
<p>is chosen as the basis for predictive modeling. 
</p>
<p>In this representation, all data pertaining to an 
</p>
<p>individual customer is contained in one observa-
</p>
<p>tion (row). Individual columns (variables, fields) 
</p>
<p>represent the conditions at specific points in 
</p>
<p>time or a summary over a whole period. Descrip-
</p>
<p>tive statistics such as sums, mean, median, and 
</p>
<p>standard deviation will be employed to capture 
</p>
<p>features of the related time series. Another key 
</p>
<p>variable to be created during this step is the 
</p>
<p>target or dependent variable, needed for predic-
</p>
<p>tive modeling. Once a satisfactory definition of 
</p>
<p>the target variable is achieved, its values will 
</p>
<p>be generated for all customers and added to 
</p>
<p>       . Table&nbsp;7.2 Response rate and amount of funds sold

</p>
<p>the existing data tables. Many data mining tools 
</p>
<p>provide support for increasing normality of the 
</p>
<p>analytical variables.
</p>
<p>The next step is to select the best model 
</p>
<p>to predict the dependent variable. The perfor-
</p>
<p>mance of different competing models is com-
</p>
<p>pared using classification tables and lift analysis 
</p>
<p>(see 7 Sect. 6.3). The final step in the data 
</p>
<p>mining project is acting based on final results. 
</p>
<p>In this step, customers and prospects are scored 
</p>
<p>and ranked to identify the right customers and 
</p>
<p>prospects to target. Archiving and comparing 
</p>
<p>the business results with the objectives initially 
</p>
<p>set for the project are important activities of the 
</p>
<p>data mining process in order to derive learnings 
</p>
<p>for future data mining projects.
</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. The Singapore based Oversea-Chinese 
</p>
<p>Banking Corporation (OCBC) applies Data 
</p>
<p>Mining to improve their marketing effec-
</p>
<p>tiveness. The publicly listed banking and 
</p>
<p>financial services provider analyzed historic 
</p>
<p>data of their clients to determine customer 
</p>
<p>preferences and design marketing activi-
</p>
<p>ties accordingly. More precisely, OCBC has 
</p>
<p>designed an event-based marketing strat-
</p>
<p>egy that focuses on various coordinated, 
</p>
<p>personalized marketing communications 
</p>
<p>across multiple channels and touch points 
</p>
<p>including email, call centers, branches, 
</p>
<p>ATMs, direct mail, text messages and 3G 
</p>
<p>mobile banking. The company launched its 
</p>
<p>enterprise marketing management system 
</p>
<p>in 2005 and has achieved a positive return 
</p>
<p>on investment (ROI) within 18&nbsp;months. 
</p>
<p>With the use of data mining, the banking 
</p>
<p>corporation has increased its conversion 
</p>
<p>rates by 45 percent and cross-sales by 60 
</p>
<p>percent. Furthermore, OCBC was able to 
</p>
<p>improve its overall marketing productivity 
</p>
<p>and is running 12 times more campaigns 
</p>
<p>compared to before (Turner, Schroeck, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Shockley, 2013).
</p>
<p> 2. The Swedish music and video streaming 
</p>
<p>service Spotify is another great example 
</p>
<p>of how to use the potential of data min-
</p>
<p>ing to improve its product offering. 
</p>
<p>Other than most online companies that 
</p>
<p>use the affinity model, which assumes 
</p>
<p>that users who like some of the same 
</p>
<p>music share the same tastes, Spotify ana-
</p>
<p>lyzes audio &laquo;fingerprints&raquo; and crawls the 
</p>
<p>web for information about music, includ-
</p>
<p>ing reviews, blogs and social media post-
</p>
<p>ing. The music service is able to identify 
</p>
<p>&laquo;clusters&raquo; where a user is listening to 
</p>
<p>the same kind of songs at different times 
</p>
<p>every week and identify a commonal-
</p>
<p>ity there. In the next step, Spotify aims 
</p>
<p>to provide &laquo;situational playlisting&raquo;, 
</p>
<p>meaning that the company will use the 
</p>
<p>understanding of music and users to 
</p>
<p>figure out what listener want to hear at 
</p>
<p>a given moment. This will enable Spotify 
</p>
<p>&laquo;to connect the right playlist to the right 
</p>
<p>listener at the right moment&raquo; (Levine, 
</p>
<p>2015).

<p>8.1  Types of&nbsp;Databases
</p>
<p>The types and nature of databases depend on 
the criteria we use to group databases. If we do 
not limit the discussion to marketing or cus-
tomer database, databases used in companies 
can first be categorized using their main busi-
ness functions. By doing so we would have the 
following:
</p>
<p> 5 Databases managing business operations 
(e.g., account payable database, cost account-
ing database, order processing database, 
payroll database).
</p>
<p> 5 Databases supporting decision-making 
activities (e.g., marketing databases, product 
development database, advertisement/
promotion databases).
</p>
<p>Databases can also be categorized according to 
the following criteria:
 1. Information included in the databases
 2. Nature of the underlying marketing activities
 3. Database technology
</p>
<p>8.1.1  Categorization Based on  
the Information Included 
in&nbsp;the Databases
</p>
<p>There are four types of databases:
 1. Customer databases
 2. Prospect databases
 3. Cluster databases
 4. Enhancement databases
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each of these in turn.
</p>
<p>Overview
</p>
<p>Stephen Spielberg&rsquo;s 2002 blockbuster movie 
</p>
<p>Minority Report shows a future in which 
</p>
<p>marketing is instantaneous and remarkably 
</p>
<p>personalized. In one of the most indelible 
</p>
<p>sequences of the movie, Tom Cruise&rsquo;s char-
</p>
<p>acter is walking through a shopping mall 
</p>
<p>where the advertisements address him by 
</p>
<p>name and flaunt products specific to his 
</p>
<p>individual preference (CRM Technology in 
</p>
<p>Minority Report movie, 2002). Though we 
</p>
<p>are decades away from such interactivity 
</p>
<p>in marketing, the premise is the basis for 
</p>
<p>Customer Relationship Management&nbsp;&ndash; being 
</p>
<p>able to accurately predict customer&rsquo;s pur-
</p>
<p>chase behavior and utilize that information to 
</p>
<p>create efficiencies in marketing expenditure. 
</p>
<p>The great leap forward that has made previ-
</p>
<p>ously unimaginable scenarios, such as this, 
</p>
<p>even remotely possible has been the ever-
</p>
<p>expanding capabilities of databases and their 
</p>
<p>extensive analytical power. Today, companies 
</p>
<p>gather information about their customers, 
</p>
<p>store it in databases, analyze the data, make 
</p>
<p>marketing decisions, and implement market-
</p>
<p>ing programs based on the results of the data 
</p>
<p>analysis on scales previously only possible in 
</p>
<p>science fiction.
</p>
<p>In 2011 Watson, the super computer 
</p>
<p>developed by IBM, defeated the two most 
</p>
<p>celebrated Jeopardy! champions in a three-
</p>
<p>day cumulative event. The significance of this 
</p>
<p>feat lies in its relevance to database manage-
</p>
<p>ment. Imagine a person who could retain a 
</p>
<p>virtually infinite amount of data, retain it in 
</p>
<p>perpetuity and recall it instantaneously. As 
</p>
<p>per initial expectations, the applications of 
</p>
<p>Watson in business have started to emerge 
</p>
<p>with the first commercial application insti-
</p>
<p>tuted by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
</p>
<p>Center in New&nbsp;York in the area of lung cancer 
</p>
<p>treatment (Upbin, 2013). Other recent appli-
</p>
<p>cations of Watson include weather monitor-
</p>
<p>ing for The Weather Company/WU (Jancer, 
</p>
<p>2016), and tax preparation services for H&amp;R 
</p>
<p>Block (Moscaritolo, 2017). Future applica-
</p>
<p>tions of Watson are promising in virtually 
</p>
<p>every industry where databases are used. 
</p>
<p>The companies that utilize technologies such 
</p>
<p>as Watson will find a tremendous source of 
</p>
<p>competitive advantage, vis-&agrave;-vis their com-
</p>
<p>petitors that fail to adopt such technologies. 
</p>
<p>With ever expanding databases, efficient 
</p>
<p>data mining and analysis will continue be the 
</p>
<p>catalyst of competitive advantage.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we provide an overview 
</p>
<p>of different types of databases and how they 
</p>
<p>differ in terms of their function, information 
</p>
<p>included, and technology. We also illustrate 
</p>
<p>how companies use different types of data-
</p>
<p>bases and how they benefit from using differ-
</p>
<p>ent databases effectively.

<p> Customer Database
</p>
<p>The customer database is the core of any marketing 
database and an invaluable asset for any firm. 
Marketers typically use customer databases to iden-
tify and profile the most valuable customers and 
communicate with them in ways likely to elicit a 
customer response. Think about this the next time 
you use a loyalty card at a grocery store. Your pur-
chases are stored in a large database and that infor-
mation is used to target coupons that are printed on 
the back of your receipt! In general, the following 
information may be included in customer databases:
</p>
<p> 5 Basic information: Name, address, ZIP code, 
and telephone number.
</p>
<p> 5 Demographic information: Age, gender, 
marital status, education, number of people 
in household, income, and so on.
</p>
<p> 5 Psychographic information: Values, activi-
ties, interests, preferences, etc.
</p>
<p> 5 Transaction history: What transactions have 
the customers conducted? How frequently do 
they purchase? How much did they spend? 
How were they acquired?
</p>
<p> 5 Other relevant information: Inquiries and 
referrals, satisfaction, loyalty.
</p>
<p>In addition to firms collecting data at the point-
of-purchase, some companies buy large amounts 
of data from third party affiliates. Several compa-
nies gather and sell data from public and private 
sources across the United States. These data allow 
the companies (buying them) to market their 
products to specific customer segments to achieve 
higher net marketing contribution. Some compa-
nies selling databases and database solutions are 
</p>
<p>Acxiorn, D&amp;B, and Prizm. The following exam-
ples of customer databases provide an insight into 
how businesses in the real world use data:
</p>
<p> 5 D&amp;B Hoovers: This analytics solution helps 
companies with improving sales and related 
insights. This solution integrates real-time 
business intelligence, sales, and marketing 
investment information to identify prospects. 
Then the solution assists companies in 
targeting the prospects for potential sales by 
integrating them in the CRM platforms. 
Some of the information tracked by this 
solution&rsquo;s global database include prospect 
summary, competitors, industry develop-
ments, business trends, and company 
financials, among others.
</p>
<p>InfoBase&reg; Consumer Enhancement from Axciom: 
This solution contains in-depth demographic and 
behavioral information about consumers in 
Australia. Some of the data being tracked includes 
income, net-worth, and products and services 
being used, among others. The benefits of using 
this solution includes customer analytics, ROI 
maximization, sales lead generation, optimal 
marketing message creation, and maximizing 
customer profitability. Research studies such as 
Kumar, Zhang, and Luo (2014) and Shah, Kumar, 
Kim, and Choi (2017) have incorporated data 
from Acxiom (in addition to the original dataset) 
related to customer demographics, socio-demo-
graphics, and customer online usage habits to add 
more depth to the insights generated. 7 CRM at 
Work 8.1 highlights how adblocking software can 
impact customer marketing campaigns.
</p>
<p>CRM at Work 8.1
No Ads, Please!
</p>
<p>Getting through to customers 
</p>
<p>is a challenge every marketer 
</p>
<p>encounters. The increase in usage 
</p>
<p>of adblock software is adding 
</p>
<p>more concern to marketers in this 
</p>
<p>regard. A recent survey of over 
</p>
<p>4000 internet users in the U.S. by 
</p>
<p>PageFair shows that the practice 
</p>
<p>of adblocking is not showing any 
</p>
<p>signs of slowing down, despite the 
</p>
<p>migration to mobile browsing. The 
</p>
<p>survey found that men in the U.S. 
</p>
<p>are 34% more likely than women 
</p>
<p>to use adblock software on com-
</p>
<p>puters. Further, the suburban and 
</p>
<p>urban internet users are 17% more 
</p>
<p>likely to use adblock software on 
</p>
<p>their desktops than those in the 
</p>
<p>rural areas.
</p>
<p>Why does adblocking happen? 
</p>
<p>The survey found that security con-
</p>
<p>cerns and interruptive content to be 
</p>
<p>the leading causes for this practice. 
</p>
<p>Further, nearly 65% of the users sur-
</p>
<p>veyed said that they came to know 
</p>
<p>about adblocking software through 
</p>
<p>friends/family/colleagues (37%), 
</p>
<p>and the internet/media (28%).
</p>
<p>Companies have recognized 
</p>
<p>this issue, and have come up with 
</p>
<p>&laquo;adblock walls&raquo; that bars adblock 
</p>
<p>users from entering the website 
</p>
<p>unless they disable the adblock 
</p>
<p>software. The survey found that 
</p>
<p>nearly 90% of the adblock users 
</p>
<p>surveyed have encountered such 
</p>
<p>a wall. Of which, 74% of the users 
</p>
<p>said they left the website when 
</p>
<p>they encountered such a wall. This 
</p>
<p>seems to indicate that the content 
</p>
<p>provided by the website using an 
</p>
<p>adblock wall is not unique enough 
</p>
<p>to make the users disable the 
</p>
<p>adblocking software. That is, the 
</p>
<p>users are likely to find that informa-
</p>
<p>tion elsewhere, and thus continue 
</p>
<p>to use the adblock software.

<p>8.1 &middot; Types of&nbsp;Databases</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>160
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>We should note that not only active custom-
ers, but also inactive customers should be included 
in customer databases. Data from active custom-
ers help marketers learn what has been done well 
in the past, and data from inactive customers help 
to identify what needs to be improved. For inac-
tive customers, the following additional informa-
tion would be important to document:
</p>
<p> 5 How long have the customers been inactive?
 5 How long have they been active?
 5 What was their purchasing pattern when they 
</p>
<p>were active?
 5 How much did they spend?
 5 How they were initially acquired?
 5 Why are they inactive?
</p>
<p> Prospect Database
</p>
<p>Prospects are noncustomers with profiles similar 
to those of existing customers. The prospect data-
base should include as much information about 
prospects as the customer database does about 
customers. For obvious reasons, however, the 
prospect database does not contain any transac-
tion history data. Marketers can use a prospect 
database to design marketing campaigns to target 
prospects with the intent of acquiring them as 
new customers. Marketers should carefully ana-
lyze the channels through which the prospects 
prefer to receive information-whether they are 
newspaper/magazine readers, TV viewers, radio 
listeners, or catalog purchasers. By doing this, 
marketers can effectively utilize all advertising 
media to achieve a higher response rate.
</p>
<p>In order to achieve the best response rate, 
marketers also need to segment prospects just as 
they segment customers, so that they can position 
the company&rsquo;s differentiated products to the pros-
pects&rsquo; specific needs. Large-scale promotions to 
all the prospects should be implemented only 
after the prospect list has been tested on an exper-
imental basis and has proved to be promising.
</p>
<p>Examples of some prospect databases used in 
the industry follow:
</p>
<p> 5 InfoBase List: Companies interested in 
marketing their products to new prospective 
customers would find this useful. The 
InfoBase list offers a collection of U.S. 
consumer data available in one source for list 
rentals covering 126 million households and 
190 million individuals.
</p>
<p> 5 Harris Selectory Online: This is a prospect 
database from D&amp;B that helps companies 
find new customers. Such a database allows 
companies to:
</p>
<p> 5 Qualify developing sales leads.
 5 Contact the decision maker best suited to 
hear their sales pitch.
</p>
<p> 5 Research potential opportunities.
</p>
<p> Cluster Database
</p>
<p>Cluster databases include information about rela-
tively small clusters. These clusters could be 
defined based on geographic reference groups 
(such as a ZIP code area), affinity groups (e.g., 
clubs and associations), and lifestyle reference 
groups. People in the same cluster tend to have 
common or similar interests, attitudes, purchas-
ing habits, and preferences. Based on the propor-
tion of existing customers in each of these clusters, 
companies can identify the clusters to which pro-
spective customers belong. Also, depending on 
the membership of prospective customers in spe-
cific clusters, firms can customize their marketing 
communications, thereby increasing the effi-
ciency of marketing efforts. Prizm is a good exam-
ple of cluster databases.
</p>
<p>The Prizm database segments every U.S. 
neighborhood into 62 distinct areas. Companies 
can use these databases to identify their potential 
future customers, locate them, and determine 
how to reach them in the most effective way. 
Every Prizm database is categorized into groups, 
each group having several clusters. Some of the-
groups in the Prizm databases follow:
</p>
<p> 5 S1 (Elite Suburbs): The five clusters in group 
SI are the nation&rsquo;s most affluent Social people.
</p>
<p> 5 UI (Urban uptown): These clusters include high 
concentration of executives and professionals.
</p>
<p> 5 CI (City Society): The three clusters of group 
Cl make the upper crust of America&rsquo;s second 
and satellite cities.
</p>
<p> 5 T1 (Landed Gentry): The clusters in this 
group are made of multi-income families 
having school-age kids and are headed by 
well-educated executives and professionals. 
This is the fourth most affluent group in the 
United States.

<p> Enhancement Database
</p>
<p>An enhancement database is used to transfer addi-
tional information about customers and prospects. 
An overlaying process is used that eliminates dupli-
cations. Enhancements may include demographic 
and psychographic data, transaction history, changes 
in address, changes in income levels, privacy status, 
and new product categories bought recently.
</p>
<p>For instance, InfoBaseR Enhanced-InfoBaseR 
provides a large collection of U.S. customer infor-
mation such as telephone and address data, mail-
</p>
<p>ing lists including hotline files, e-mail data, and so 
on in one single source. The InfoBaseR Enhanced 
provides the ability to append the latest demo-
graphics, socioeconomic and lifestyle data to your 
existing in-house customer database. A consumer 
goods company could use this data to better target 
its advertising and marketing campaigns, expand 
brand reach, improve acquisition and retention 
rates, and increase profitability.

American Express and&nbsp;Database 
</p>
<p>Clustering
</p>
<p>American Express is a good 
</p>
<p>example for database clustering. 
</p>
<p>Take a moment to think about the 
</p>
<p>types of data collected by your 
</p>
<p>credit card company. Your 
</p>
<p>purchase behavior spread across 
</p>
<p>many different products, 
</p>
<p>aggregated into a single database 
</p>
<p>creates a great opportunity for 
</p>
<p>clustering with the use of efficient 
</p>
<p>database slicing techniques.
</p>
<p>For instance, consider the case 
</p>
<p>of Brian&nbsp;&ndash; an avid traveler. He has 
</p>
<p>used his American Express Gold 
</p>
<p>Card to purchase all his airline 
</p>
<p>tickets. All his tickets have been for 
</p>
<p>round trips, and in coach class. 
</p>
<p>Based on his demographic 
</p>
<p>information and other purchase-
</p>
<p>related attributes, American Express 
</p>
<p>has categorized Brian into the &laquo;bud-
</p>
<p>get traveler&raquo; cluster. After a few 
</p>
<p>years, Brian&rsquo;s income increases and 
</p>
<p>he decides to purchase a first class 
</p>
<p>ticket. Soon after this purchase, 
</p>
<p>American Express revisits his 
</p>
<p>customer information and 
</p>
<p>determines that his behavior could 
</p>
<p>be on the verge of change. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, they offer him with an 
</p>
<p>invitation to apply for a Platinum 
</p>
<p>Card. The outcome of this invitation 
</p>
<p>would help American Express 
</p>
<p>determine if his behavior is related 
</p>
<p>to a transition in behavior or merely 
</p>
<p>a one-off purchase. If Brian signs up 
</p>
<p>for the platinum card, American 
</p>
<p>Express determines that he has 
</p>
<p>changed from the &laquo;budget traveler&raquo; 
</p>
<p>cluster to the &laquo;premium traveler&raquo; 
</p>
<p>cluster. Having transitioned to this 
</p>
<p>new cluster, Brian is likely to be 
</p>
<p>provided with several cross-selling 
</p>
<p>offers for other premium services 
</p>
<p>from American Express.
</p>
<p>Accurate database clustering is 
</p>
<p>one-part information assimilation 
</p>
<p>and one-part information 
</p>
<p>adaption. It is important for 
</p>
<p>marketers to understand that 
</p>
<p>customer databases evolve over 
</p>
<p>time, and that customers will 
</p>
<p>move between the various clusters 
</p>
<p>as determined by their purchase 
</p>
<p>behavior. Those who believe that 
</p>
<p>customer cluster exists in static 
</p>
<p>isolation will undoubtedly misuse 
</p>
<p>database clustering. Rather an 
</p>
<p>evolving and moving clustering 
</p>
<p>system allows customers to move 
</p>
<p>freely in and out of clusters as is 
</p>
<p>warranted by their purchase 
</p>
<p>behavior.

County Drain&rsquo;s Enhancement 
</p>
<p>Database
</p>
<p>County Drains is a rapidly 
</p>
<p>expanding drainage services 
</p>
<p>company that has built its business 
</p>
<p>model around the strengths of its 
</p>
<p>customer relationships and looks 
</p>
<p>to strengthen those relationships, 
</p>
<p>providing the bedrock of growth 
</p>
<p>for future growth.
</p>
<p>While County Drains has always 
</p>
<p>prided its self on its exemplary 
</p>
<p>customer service, its customer 
</p>
<p>base was expanding at such a rate 
</p>
<p>that its system of spreadsheets and 
</p>
<p>manual processes were beginning 
</p>
<p>to be squeezed into antiquity. 
</p>
<p>County Drain needed an adaptive 
</p>
<p>database that would allow it to 
</p>
<p>continue its premium customer 
</p>
<p>service even with the tremendous 
</p>
<p>growth the firm was experiencing. 
</p>
<p>The objectives for the database 
</p>
<p>system were:
</p>
<p> 5 Creation of a centralized 
source of data.
</p>
<p> 5 An easy, logical system that 
the staff would quickly 
</p>
<p>adopt.
</p>
<p> 5 Improvement of all data; 
historic, current and new.
</p>
<p>The CRM program chosen for  
</p>
<p>the project was GoldMine Premium 
</p>
<p>Edition, which allowed them to 
</p>
<p>accomplish each of their three 
</p>
<p>stated goals. The system not  
</p>
<p>only allowed County Drain to 
</p>
<p>continue with its premium 
</p>
<p>customer service, it allowed the 
</p>
<p>firm to be more proactive with its 
</p>
<p>customers providing even more 
</p>
<p>relevant services while also 
</p>
<p>increasing their revenues; a  
</p>
<p>win-win for the customer and

<p>8.1 &middot; Types of&nbsp;Databases</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>162
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>8.1.2  Categorization Based 
on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Nature 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Underlying Marketing 
Activities
</p>
<p>There are two types of marketing databases&nbsp;&ndash; pas-
sive and active.
</p>
<p> Passive Marketing Database
</p>
<p>A passive marketing database involves generating 
a customer list and then storing this list in the 
database. Future marketing efforts target the same 
customers in the list. The database is only a mail-
ing list passively storing information about 
acquired customers, and has no active influence 
on the company&rsquo;s strategic marketing decisions. 
Passive databases are often used in smaller com-
panies that lack the resources to actively track 
customers and update databases. Rather, these 
firms periodically purchase third party mailing 
lists from data vendors. . Figure&nbsp;8.1 illustrates a 
layout of a passive database.
</p>
<p>As . Fig.&nbsp; 8.1 shows, the database uses the 
same customer list for different marketing cam-
paigns. Any of the customer databases can be 
used as a passive database wherein a company 
keeps buying a new and updated customer data-
base every time it needs customer information for 
campaigns. The campaign results from a past 
campaign hold no significance in this case.
</p>
<p> Active Marketing Database
</p>
<p>In contrast, marketers can use an active database 
to develop strategic marketing plans. Every indi-
vidual marketing program designed to carry out 
the plan will then be data-driven. After marketing 
programs are executed, the results are used to 
update the database. The updated database can 
then be used to help marketers adjust or redesign 
the strategic marketing plan. . Figure&nbsp; 8.2 illus-
trates a layout of an active database. Active data-
bases allow for customer segmentation and 
clustering due to constant updating. 7 CRM at 
Work 8.4 highlights the use of an active database.

 Best Buy&rsquo;s Athena Database
</p>
<p>Best Buy is constantly updating its 
</p>
<p>in-house customer database called 
</p>
<p>Athena, named after the Greek god-
</p>
<p>dess of Wisdom. As with all well-
</p>
<p>designed databases, the upgrades 
</p>
<p>were focused on making them 
</p>
<p>relevant, so that targeted and cus-
</p>
<p>tomized messages can be sent to 
</p>
<p>its customers, as opposed to mass 
</p>

</p>
<p>8.1.3  Categorization Based on the 
Database Technology
</p>
<p>Databases can also be categorized according to 
their underlying technology. Please note that the 
term database, in this context does not refer only 
to marketing databases.
</p>
<p> Hierarchical Database
</p>
<p>A hierarchical database is useful when search 
queries are standard and routine, but require 
high-speed processing. Hierarchical databases are 
preferred in the banking, airline, and hotel indus-
tries. In hierarchical databases, all information 
pertaining to a customer will be in a master 
record. Hence, cross-referencing from other data 
sources is not needed.
</p>
<p>A hierarchical database is organized in a tree-
like structure, similar to that of a family tree. In fact, 
the different levels of the hierarchy are even referred 
</p>
<p>to as a parent/child relationship. . Figure&nbsp; 8.3 pro-
vides a visualization of this concept for a custom 
millwork business.
</p>
<p>As . Fig.&nbsp;8.3 illustrates, a custom millwork busi-
ness may choose to design and maintain their data-
base according to their product offerings. In this 
case, the millwork business has designed their data-
base with three levels in their hierarchy. The first 
level is about the nature of the millwork&nbsp;&ndash; moldings 
or window work. The second level is about type of 
molding or window work. The last level is about the 
choice of wood and design in their millwork. Here, 
a search query such as &laquo;mahogany hardwood mold-
ings&raquo; or &laquo;French casement windows&raquo; is likely to 
return the customer records pertaining to these 
products with very little processing time. Depending 
on the nature, size and scope of the business, the 
millwork business can choose to add more levels to 
the hierarchy to accurately capture information 
regarding their customers.

<p>was made possible by an accurate 
</p>
<p>tracking of prior purchase behavior/
</p>
<p>browsing history of their customers. 
</p>
<p>The impact of the Athena database 
</p>
<p>was witnessed during the 2015 
</p>
<p>back-to-school season.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, the retailer had 
</p>
<p>sent out a generic message that 
</p>
<p>promoted everything from blankets 
</p>
<p>to stationeries to refrigerators for 
</p>
<p>the entire customer database. 
</p>
<p>Athena, however, helped Best Buy 
</p>
<p>identify students, likely-to-be- 
</p>
<p>students, and the parents of likely-
</p>
<p>to-be-students based on online and 
</p>
<p>offline interactions. These identified 
</p>
<p>customer segments were then 
</p>
<p>sent back-to-school promotion 
</p>
<p>emails with items that had been 
</p>
<p>identified for promotions. In other 
</p>
<p>words, customers that did not fall 
</p>
<p>into any of the three groups did not 
</p>
<p>receive these customized promo-
</p>
<p>tion emails, or were not likely to 
</p>
<p>even know of a back-to-school sale. 
</p>
<p>Similar promotional campaigns 
</p>
<p>were implemented for the back-
</p>
<p>to-college and Labor Day periods 
</p>
<p>for distinctly targeted customer 
</p>
<p>groups. In essence, campaigns were 
</p>
<p>being run in parallel, as opposed to 
</p>
<p>running one single mass campaign.
</p>
<p>Thanks to the well thought-
</p>
<p>out campaigns, the retailer 
</p>
<p>realized a 17% increase in online 
</p>
<p>comparable store sales during the 
</p>
<p>second quarter of 2015. Further, 
</p>
<p>the company did not spend 
</p>
<p>money that they would have on 
</p>
<p>TV or print ads and reinvested it 
</p>
<p>into managing and upgrading 
</p>
<p>Athena. The savings and upgrades 
</p>
<p>have enabled them to use Athena 
</p>
<p>for their future plans that includes 
</p>
<p>redesigning their wedding regis-
</p>
<p>try program.

<p>8.1 &middot; Types of&nbsp;Databases</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>164
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>Databases used in mainframe technology 
typically are hierarchical databases. They are huge 
in size and are still used as databases supporting 
critical applications in some medium- to big-sized 
corporations.
</p>
<p> Inverted Database
</p>
<p>Inverted databases are suited for direct marketing 
applications because they have the speed of a hier-
archical database and also the flexibility to 
respond to unanticipated questions. It is also easy 
to add new elements to an inverted database as 
and when updated information is acquired. Some 
of the commonly used inverted file systems are 
Model 204, Adabas, and Computer Associates&rsquo; 
Datacom/DB.&nbsp; These vary in their processing 
speeds and flexibility in the implementation envi-
ronments.
</p>
<p> Relational Database
</p>
<p>Relational databases are composed of many sim-
ple tables. Users can create queries to extract 
information from these tables and recombine it. 
This capability means that when compared to 
other types of databases, relational databases have 
the greatest flexibility. However, this flexibility 
also means the speed of processing is somewhat 
slower. Databases like Oracle, SQL Server, and 
Microsoft Access are all relational databases. Each 
one of these has different interfaces and capaci-
ties. Its use in organizations today depends on the 
size of the database marketing initiative. Oracle 
and SQL Server are capable of handling medium- 
to large-sized companywide marketing programs 
while Microsoft Access is used for smaller-sized 
database marketing initiatives.
</p>
<p>8.2  The Benefits of&nbsp;Marketing 
Databases
</p>
<p>Companies that efficiently use their marketing 
databases can expect the following benefits.
</p>
<p>8.2.1  The Ability to&nbsp;Carry Out 
Profitable Segmentation
</p>
<p>Customers can be classified into different groups, 
depending on their buying behaviors. Frequent 
buyers need to be treated differently than occa-
</p>
<p>sional buyers. First-time users should be 
approached differently than repeat buyers. 
Marketing databases allow us to analyze custom-
ers and classify them into different groups. 
Different marketing programs can then be exe-
cuted and implemented for different groups or 
segments.
</p>
<p>8.2.2  Retained Customers 
and&nbsp;Repeat Business
</p>
<p>Retaining existing customers has become one of 
the important goals of many companies&rsquo; market-
ing practices. Marketing databases enable market-
ers to determine the critical factors which 
influence the degree of customer satisfaction; and 
to develop effective campaigns accordingly to 
retain as many existing customers as possible at 
the lowest possible cost.
</p>
<p>8.2.3  The Ability to&nbsp;Spot Potentially 
Profitable Customers
</p>
<p>With marketing databases, the company can pro-
file its own customers, and then use lists and 
media surveys to locate potential customers with 
the same profile, and are therefore expected to 
contribute significantly to the company&rsquo;s revenues 
because of their higher response rates and willing-
ness to buy premium products.
</p>
<p>8.3  The Uses of&nbsp;Marketing  
Databases (Jackson &amp; Wang, 
1994)
</p>
<p>8.3.1  Uses that Directly Influence 
the&nbsp;Customer Relationship
</p>
<p> 5 Identify and profile the best customers: By 
tracking customer transaction data, marketers 
can conduct recency, frequency, and mon-
etary value (RFM) analysis or develop 
sophisticated models to identify customers 
who are of greatest value to the company.
</p>
<p> 5 Develop new customers: Armed with the 
profile of the company&rsquo;s best customers, the 
company can find new customers with the 
characteristics of the best customers. 
</p>
<p> Chapter 8 &middot; Using Databases</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>165 8
</p>
<p>Marketers could target not only the new users 
of the product/service but also competitors&rsquo; 
existing customers.
</p>
<p> 5 Deliver customized messages consistent 
with product/service usage: With customer 
transaction history data and customer service 
data, marketers can track customers&rsquo; feedback 
to the specific products and services, and find 
out what pleased or displeased them. Then, 
the company can design specially customized 
marketing messages consistent with the 
product/service to promote their products 
and or services.
</p>
<p> 5 Send follow-up messages to customers for 
post-purchase reinforcement: Cross-sell 
products/services. The company can identify 
customers&rsquo; other needs based on their 
demographic, lifestyle, and behavioral 
characteristics, and then sell them other 
products/services that satisfy their needs.
</p>
<p> 5 Ensure cost-effective communication with 
customers: A marketing database enables 
marketers to classify customers into high 
potential, medium potential, and low potential 
groups. After evaluating the monetary value of 
these customers&rsquo; potential, marketers will be able 
to determine how much the company should 
invest on communicating with these customers.
</p>
<p> 5 Improve promotion result: Marketers: can 
achieve better promotion results by targeting 
the customer groups who are most likely to 
respond (e.g., loyalists, prospects with best 
customer profiles).
</p>
<p> 5 Personalize customer service: Knowing 
when, where, and what the customers 
purchased, the company can communicate 
with the customers to get their feedback, and 
then personalize the customer service 
delivered to them.
</p>
<p> 5 Stealth communication with customers. 
Marketing databases provide the opportunity 
for one-on-one communications with each 
customer without the competitors&rsquo; knowledge.
</p>
<p>8.3.2  Uses that Directly Influence 
Other Business Operations
</p>
<p> 5 Evaluate and refine existing marketing 
practices: By analyzing customer data, 
marketers can assess the effectiveness of all 
the aspects of the existing marketing 
practice, including strategy, planning, 
budgeting, campaign design, implementa-
tion, customer communication, and so on to 
identify shortcomings and suggest improve-
ments.
</p>
<p> 5 Maintain brand equity: Match brands with 
customers who fit the brand profile and 
keep communicating with those customers 
using specially designed brand-building 
messages.
</p>
<p> 5 Increase effectiveness of distribution 
channels: Customers&rsquo; transaction data and 
customer service data can tell how existing 
distribution channels work and how to make 
them more effective.
</p>
<p> 5 Conduct product and market research: In a 
customer-centric company, product, and 
market research must focus on customer 
needs. Marketing databases provide a unique 
resource of information on customer needs.
</p>
<p> 5 Integrating the marketing program: A 
complete and integral marketing database 
can track all marketing efforts toward a 
customer. Marketers will be able to avoid 
duplicate, supplemental, and misdirected 
communications. It also helps marketers 
determine any overlapping between market-
ing programs targeted at different customer 
groups.
</p>
<p> 5 Create a new valuable management 
resource: A marketing database could be used 
to support not only the traditional marketing 
practices, but also a wide range of other 
business functions such as advertising, 
product R&amp;D, distribution, customer service, 
and so on.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>Effective database analysis is important for 
</p>
<p>successful CRM.&nbsp;Databases can be categorized 
</p>
<p>based on their main business function-data-
</p>
<p>bases managing business and databases sup-
</p>
<p>porting decision-making activities. In addition, 
</p>
<p>databases can also be categorized based on 
</p>
<p>the information included in the databases, the 
</p>
<p>nature of the underlying marketing activities, 
</p>
<p>and database technology. Based on the infor-

</p>
<p>mation included in the databases, databases 
</p>
<p>can be classified as customer, prospect, cluster, 
</p>
<p>and enhancement databases.
</p>
<p>Customer databases identify and profile the 
</p>
<p>best customers and communicate with these 
</p>
<p>customers to elicit a response. These data allow 
</p>
<p>the companies to market their products to 
</p>
<p>specific customer segments to achieve higher 
</p>
<p>net marketing contribution. Data from active 
</p>
<p>and inactive customers are important to ensure 
</p>
<p>efficient marketing function. The prospect data-
</p>
<p>base includes information on noncustomers 
</p>
<p>with profiles similar to those of existing cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. It can be used by marketers to design 
</p>
<p>marketing campaigns to target prospects with 
</p>
<p>the intent of acquiring them as new customers. 
</p>
<p>This is done after carefully analyzing the chan-
</p>
<p>nels through which the prospects like to receive 
</p>
<p>information. Cluster databases include informa-
</p>
<p>tion about small clusters based on geographic 
</p>
<p>reference groups, affinity groups, and lifestyle 
</p>
<p>reference groups. An enhancement database is 
</p>
<p>used to transfer additional information on cus-
</p>
<p>tomers and prospects avoiding duplications.
</p>
<p>Based on the nature of the underlying 
</p>
<p>marketing activities, marketing databases are 
</p>
<p>categorized into active and passive. A passive 
</p>
<p>database is a customer mailing list that pas-
</p>
<p>sively stores information about acquired cus-
</p>
<p>tomers for targeting future marketing efforts, 
</p>
<p>and has no active influence on the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>strategic marketing decisions. An active data-
</p>
<p>base is used by marketers to develop strategic 
</p>
<p>marketing plans. After marketing programs 
</p>
<p>are executed, the results are used to update 
</p>
<p>the database. The updated database can be 
</p>
<p>used to help marketers adjust or redesign the 
</p>
<p>strategic marketing plan.
</p>
<p>Databases can also be categorized into 
</p>
<p>hierarchical, inverted, and relational databases. 
</p>
<p>A hierarchical database is useful for routine 
</p>
<p>and standard queries which need high-speed 
</p>
<p>processing. These have all the information 
</p>
<p>pertaining to a customer in a master record and 
</p>
<p>are typically used in mainframe technology. 
</p>
<p>Inverted databases are suited for direct market-
</p>
<p>ing applications on account of their speed, flexi-
</p>
<p>bility, and ease of updating. Relational databases 
</p>
<p>have the greatest flexibility but lower speed of 
</p>
<p>processing. Marketing databases allow market-
</p>
<p>ers to analyze customers and classify them into 
</p>
<p>different groups and, accordingly, implement 
</p>
<p>different marketing programs for each group. 
</p>
<p>These databases also enable marketers to 
</p>
<p>determine the critical factors influencing cus-
</p>
<p>tomer satisfaction and take measures to retain 
</p>
<p>existing customers at lowest cost. They also help 
</p>
<p>marketers in identifying potentially profitable 
</p>
<p>customers using lists and media surveys. Using 
</p>
<p>marketing databases, marketers can identify 
</p>
<p>individual customers of greatest value to the 
</p>
<p>company. Other uses of marketing databases 
</p>
<p>include developing new customers, delivering 
</p>
<p>customized messages consistent with product/
</p>
<p>service usage, and effectively communicating 
</p>
<p>with customers in the form of feedbacks on 
</p>
<p>purchases, promotions, stealth communications, 
</p>
<p>and so on. Maintaining brand equity, increasing 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of distribution channels, as well 
</p>
<p>as conducting product and market research are 
</p>
<p>other uses of marketing databases that directly 
</p>
<p>influence business operations.

<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. The 7 data.gov website operated by the 
U.S. government serves as a repository for 
</p>
<p>thousands of datasets on a wide range of 
</p>
<p>topics such as consumers, manufacturing, 
</p>
<p>and finance, among others. At the time of 
</p>
<p>this writing, the website hosts more than 
</p>
<p>190,000 datasets, all of which are made 
</p>
<p>public and free to use. Similarly, Research 
</p>
<p>Data Australia provides access to publicly 
</p>
<p>available data that are categorized by 
</p>
<p>major subject headings.
</p>
<p> 2. The level of technology available is closely 
</p>
<p>linked with the deployment of customer 
</p>
<p>databases and the ability to obtain 
</p>
<p>customer-level data and insights. A 2015 
</p>
<p>study by Experian found that marketers in 
</p>
<p>Spain, France, Australia, and New Zealand 
</p>
<p>identified technology as one of the leading 
</p>
<p>challenges faced by them in customer man-
</p>
<p>agement. However, Japanese marketers 
</p>
<p>were more confident in their technology 
</p>
<p>(as compared to other countries), but found 
</p>
<p>achieving a unified customer perspective to 
</p>
<p>be a bigger challenge (Experian, 2015).

<p>9.1  CRM Implementation Options
</p>
<p>Companies can opt for any one or a combination 
of three different ways to implement a CRM solu-
tion: developing software in house, buying 
licensed software, or outsourcing creation of soft-
ware.
</p>
<p>9.1.1  Developing Software In-House
</p>
<p>Building and managing a CRM solution in-house 
requires the company to define all its require-
ments, pay for software development, and bear all 
the R&amp;D costs internally. Companies choosing to 
develop software in-house must invest heavily in 
</p>
<p>storage, application software and hardware, all of 
which add considerably to the overhead costs. The 
initial hardware and software expenses constitute 
only a small portion of the total cost, which is 
largely shaped by maintenance demands, espe-
cially those arising from changing requirements 
inside the organization. This can be done with or 
without external consulting help, although it is 
useful to have external help because collecting 
data, managing related systems, and driving value 
from data is not a core competence of most busi-
nesses.
</p>
<p>A good analogy for this route is building a 
professional sports franchise with young or 
unknown players. The young players are able to fit 
into the scheme you develop but will lack the 
experience of more seasoned veterans. Because of 
this, much more oversight, training and manage-
ment will be needed to ensure the success of the 
team that bears upfront costs and long-term costs 
as well. While the upfront cost of this choice may 
not be as much as acquiring seasoned veterans, 
the opportunity costs and long-term costs almost 
certainly are greater.
</p>
<p>In 2015, it was reported by the Wall Street 
Journal by Facebook&rsquo;s chief information officer, 
Timothy Campos, that Facebook&rsquo;s productivity is 
managed through the development of proprietary 
software tools. The company didn&rsquo;t want to fit 
their needs into a budget, or outsource what they 
could do in-house to help increase workforce pro-
ductivity. They also didn&rsquo;t want to be forced to 
tailor external products to their needs. CRM soft-
ware was internally created at Facebook, so, for 
example, when an advertiser contacts Facebook 
with a problem, Facebook immediately knows all 
the information about the company and can deal 
with issues accordingly, and expeditiously 
(Rosenbush, 2015).
</p>
<p> Advantages
</p>
<p>Companies develop a tailor-made solution 
adapted to their needs and structure. They develop 
internal resources and skills that allow them to 
develop the system each time the company 
requirements change. By doing do, they can avoid 
dependence on CRM software vendors and on 
new software releases or developments. Since the 
solution is tailor-made to fit their current business 
practices, firms that choose this route are not 
required to adapt their business practices to any 
particular software. This independence of not 
</p>
<p>Overview
</p>
<p>Expectations are inevitably high when a 
</p>
<p>company decides to implement a CRM 
</p>
<p>system. Why shouldn&rsquo;t they be? CRM has 
</p>
<p>been lauded as the next revolution in 
</p>
<p>customer management, giving firms the 
</p>
<p>ability to manage their customers on an 
</p>
<p>individual level. This level of individualized 
</p>
<p>marketing is said to decrease overall 
</p>
<p>marketing spending while increasing 
</p>
<p>marketing&rsquo;s overall effectiveness. These 
</p>
<p>expectations are, indeed, feasible, but 
</p>
<p>companies are often concerned about the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the CRM system. There 
</p>
<p>have been many cases of failed CRM imple-
</p>
<p>mentation that have had adverse impacts on 
</p>
<p>companies, their managements, and their 
</p>
<p>stakeholders.
</p>
<p>While failed CRM implementations are a 
</p>
<p>reality, a careful examination of options as a 
</p>
<p>precursor to implementation can negate much 
</p>
<p>of the risk inherent in a CRM implementation. 
</p>
<p>Firms have different requirements and different 
</p>
<p>competencies and must ensure that their 
</p>
<p>implementation method satisfies their require-
</p>
<p>ments and highlights their competencies. With 
</p>
<p>patience and careful examination of expecta-
</p>
<p>tions and competencies, management can 
</p>
<p>select a CRM system and associated implemen-
</p>
<p>tation strategy that best suits their needs, 
</p>
<p>leading to an invaluable customer manage-
</p>
<p>ment tool.

</p>
<p>relying too much on software often leads to a 
smoother transition for the majority of employees 
using the system.
</p>
<p> Disadvantages
</p>
<p>This is usually the most expensive option 
because the company has to maintain, operate, 
and improve the system on its own. Usually, it 
is very difficult to attract and retain the 
employees needed to solve data warehousing 
challenges. The typical time commitment is 
1&ndash;2&nbsp; years, which might be long when com-
pared to other out-of-the-box solutions in the 
market.
</p>
<p>9.1.2  Buying Licensed CRM Software
</p>
<p>Companies that choose to buy licensed CRM soft-
ware will also need extensive IT resources. Even 
with a licensed CRM software solution, compa-
nies still need to develop the IT infrastructure and 
integrate the new software with existing applica-
tions. This solution can be sold as a block (it may 
be composed of different modules adapted to 
each. Front-office application) or it can be sold as 
independent modules (e.g., the company just 
buys the sales automation module or the contact 
management module).
</p>
<p>Although the CRM vendor should provide 
knowledge and training for the new system, 
considerable effort still needs to be invested in 
order to develop internal expertise and skills to 
effectively run the new CRM solution. Also, 
each time the CRM vendor releases a new or an 
upgraded version of the software, the company 
needs to go through the process of upgrading 
the systems, buying additional modules, and 
resolving other associated problems. Oracle is 
one of the largest vendors of CRM software, 
offering suites of products, including CX Cloud 
Suite, which aids companies with marketing, 
sales, commerce, social and CPQ (configure, 
price, quote). The software helps improve sales 
productivity and produces real-time customer 
information. One of the Oracle&rsquo;s largest cus-
tomers is DIRECTV, which Eric Walters, proj-
ect manager of sales operations for DIRECTV, 
said &laquo;allows them to spend less time working 
with us and more time with the customers, sell-
ing&nbsp; &ndash; a huge competitive advantage&raquo; (Oracle, 
2009).
</p>
<p> Advantages
</p>
<p>Many of these software packages have a proven 
record of success, and the company can feel reas-
sured that this solution has worked for other com-
panies. Typically, the software packages are 
developed using a set of &laquo;best practices&raquo; and con-
tinually updated as the practices evolve. This 
ensures that the CRM system will function prop-
erly. The IT concept and developments will be 
implemented with the help of the CRM vendor 
and the company will only need to adapt its IT 
structure to integrate the new solution.
</p>
<p> Disadvantages
</p>
<p>This is also an expensive option and may take sev-
eral months to be integrated with the company&rsquo;s 
operations. The initial fees and the licensing costs 
are usually high. Companies are often charged to 
renew the license each year. Maintenance costs 
are required over the life of the software, and each 
time a new version comes out, companies have to 
pay for it. If the company chooses to customize 
the solution to its needs, it will have to pay for 
consulting services, which are generally very 
expensive. In situations when companies change 
to a new CRM software package, they may also 
face resistance from employees in terms of adapt-
ing to the new system/process. Even programs 
that can save employees time and effort can be 
regarded as intrusive and complicated in the short 
run, if the new software package is a significant 
detour from the previously used CRM software. 
In this regard, a careful examination of the com-
pany&rsquo;s human capital would be critical in making 
a decision on the choice of CRM software pack-
age.
</p>
<p>9.1.3  Outsourcing a&nbsp;Managed 
Service
</p>
<p>Companies can outsource the CRM solution from 
a third-party company. The outsourcing company 
provides the hardware, software, and human 
resources in exchange for a monthly fee. 
Implementation takes less time because applica-
tions are already built and operational and the 
outsourcing company has an incentive to get the 
system running so that it can initiate service and 
fees. American Express, for example, outsources 
some of its CRM needs to 7 Saleforce.com, which 
tracks data through various channels including

</p>
<p>mobile, Apple Pay, and credit cards. Through 
Salesforce, American Express is focused on sales, 
accounts, development, servicing, marketing and 
communicating in real-time with customers to 
help solve and remedy problems as soon as they 
occur. It also helps retain customer relationships, 
which American Express is known for cultivating 
effectively (Salesforce, 2016).
</p>
<p> Advantages
</p>
<p>The upfront costs are lower than in the other two 
approaches. Companies do not need to pay for 
software licenses and hardware systems. The firm 
does not need to recruit or develop internal IT 
skills to manage the new CRM solution. The com-
pany can adopt a pay-as-you-go approach, mean-
ing that it can start the process of paying as the 
CRM results are visible, instead of paying upfront 
costs and licensing and maintenance costs. 
Especially pertinent for smaller companies or 
those with limited marketing and IT budgets, this 
approach allows these firms to take advantage of 
CRM programs which would otherwise be 
unavailable due to high costs. This approach is 
often referred to as Software as a Service (Dubey 
&amp; Wagle, 2007) (SaaS) or Software on Demand. 
</p>
<p>An example of this type of software is 7 Salesforce.
com or 7 Pipeline.com, which provides sales force 
automation without expensive licensing or soft-
ware development.
</p>
<p> Disadvantages
</p>
<p>Each time the company needs to adapt the solu-
tion to new requirements it has to contact the 
outsourcing company and pay for the develop-
ments. The firm does not possess the necessary 
skills and knowledge to manage the CRM solu-
tion, and it risks losing the CRM solution invest-
ments if the outsourcing company goes out of 
business. The implementing firm is entirely 
dependent on the outsourcing company, placing 
even greater importance on platform selection. 
This option may not be viable for very large or 
specialized firms who require specific require-
ments in their CRM package.

<p>In the particular case that the company opts to 
buy a CRM solution, integration middleware sup-
pliers and consulting services at the management, 
technical, and information systems levels are often 
employed, even though they are not always required. 
Depending on the type of application, these services 
may be included in the original contract.
</p>
<p>9.2  CRM Software 
and&nbsp;Applications
</p>
<p>In this section we will focus on the option where 
the company chooses to buy licensed CRM soft-
ware or to outsource the CRM solution.
</p>
<p>9.2.1  Stage-Wise Implementation 
Versus an&nbsp;Enterprise Wide CRM 
Solution
</p>
<p>The CRM industry offers different types of solu-
tions based on the company needs and processes. 
CRM software solutions can be looked at in two 
different ways:
 1. CRM software is offered in different, inde-
</p>
<p>pendent modules, which are adapted to a 
specific department&rsquo;s needs (e.g., the com-
pany buys the sales automation software and 
the contact management module from 
different providers).
</p>
<p> 2. The enterprise wide CRM solution is com-
posed of different modules from the same 
provider. These modules may be adapted to 
each department&rsquo;s needs, yet they are imple-
mented as a whole by connecting the different 
modules and the existing databases. Individual 
components may be weaker than best-of-breed 
products; however, the organization knows the 
different components are fully compatible.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the enterprise-wide CRM solutions 
are not customized to specific needs. This could 
lead to further consulting costs in the future. 
Current market conditions and competition have 
resulted in CRM vendors now customizing indi-
vidual modules to company needs.
</p>
<p>Ideally, all CRM software solutions should 
integrate information and databases from mar-
keting, sales, customer service, e-business, call-
center, and other sources. The total CRM solution 
comprises a series of many different hardware 
devices and software components. These compo-
nents may or may not come from different 
 suppliers and may run on different platforms. It is 
the company&rsquo;s decision, based on the precedent 
requirements, to choose between a stage-wise 
implementation of CRM modules or an enter-
prise wide CRM solution.
</p>
<p>9.2.2  Relationships and&nbsp;Flows 
Between CRM Modules
</p>
<p>As stated earlier, CRM modules can be imple-
mented independently in phases or together in a 
global solution. In both cases, the important thing 
is to integrate the modules so that the company 
can have an integrated view of the customer. All 
the information obtained from the customer is 
stored in a data warehouse which will be used to 
perform analysis, modeling, and data mining. 
Consequently the analysis information will be 
used in different ways by each department to 
interface with the customer in the future, via the 
available channels of communication. To illus-
trate this adaptation, . Fig.&nbsp;9.2 a pictorial represen-
tation of an integrated CRM solution at work. 
This represents a generic implementation with 
room for customization as per the requirements 
of each industry.
</p>
<p>A new trend emerging in the CRM industry 
is that of strategic supplier partnerships. These 
consist of a partnership between the company 
that implements CRM and the supplier of the 
software and services. The goal is not only to 
customize the CRM offer to the company&rsquo;s 
needs, but also to ensure that the supplying com-
pany takes part in the implementation processes. 
This is in response to buyers increasingly 
demanding a risk-sharing proposition from the 
supplier. This means that the seller of the tool 
has an interesting delivering the impact that was 
promised at the time of sale.

</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>CRM has a curious duality. On one hand it 
</p>
<p>can provide the capabilities for firms to opti-
</p>
<p>mize their marketing budgets and, increase 
</p>
<p>revenues. However, poor planning in the 
</p>
<p>implementation stage can cause confusion 
</p>
<p>in operations and cost the firm millions, or 
</p>
<p>worse, alienate its customers. This chapter 
</p>
<p>discussed strategies associated with CRM 
</p>
<p>implementations, although there are varying 
</p>
<p>degrees of customization that are possible 
</p>
<p>with each strategy.
</p>
<p>The first strategy is to develop in-house 
</p>
<p>software. This is the most expensive option 
</p>
<p>and should only be undertaken by firms that 
</p>
<p>have a competency in software develop-
</p>
<p>ment. Since the software is being developed 
</p>
<p>in-house, it allows for customizations and per-
</p>
<p>mits the firm to tailor the system to its current 
</p>
<p>business processes and culture.
</p>
<p>The second strategy is to purchase 
</p>
<p>licensed software from a third party vendor. 
</p>
<p>This strategy is often less expensive than 
</p>
<p>developing the in-house software, but can run 
</p>
<p>up exorbitant costs in its associated imple-
</p>
<p>mentation and pushback. Customization is 
</p>
<p>possible in this strategy, but incurs additional 
</p>
<p>costs when upgrading to newer software. The 
</p>
<p>default practices and controls in the system 
</p>
<p>are considered to be &laquo;best practices&raquo; as they 
</p>
<p>are a product of research across a large num-
</p>
<p>ber of firms. While these practices and controls

</p>
<p>are considered to be industry-leading, they 
</p>
<p>may not coincide with the implementing firm&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>culture and could result in considerable hesi-
</p>
<p>tancy from employees to adopt such a system.
</p>
<p>The final option is outsourcing to a 
</p>
<p>managed service. Companies such as 
</p>
<p>7 Salesforce.com have made CRM capabili-
ties available even to small and mid-sized 
</p>
<p>businesses and have taken much of the 
</p>
<p>anxiety out of implementation, since none is 
</p>
<p>involved. This service is provided on a pay-
</p>
<p>for-play system, which equates to lower costs 
</p>
<p>than the other two options. Outsourcing CRM 
</p>
<p>is increasingly becoming popular with com-
</p>
<p>panies of all sizes. However, a prime concern 
</p>
<p>with outsourcing CRM is limited control for 
</p>
<p>the implementing firm from the provider. In 
</p>
<p>addition, little or no customization options 
</p>
<p>from the service provider are likely to create a 
</p>
<p>cause for concern for the implementing firms.
</p>
<p>Within each strategy lies the question of 
</p>
<p>how to implement. There are two options: 
</p>
<p>stage-wise and enterprise-wise implementa-
</p>
<p>tion. Stage wise implementation often takes 
</p>
<p>longer, but allows for firms to take the imple-
</p>
<p>mentation &laquo;one step at a time&raquo; and learn from 
</p>
<p>their mistakes as they progress. This is often 
</p>
<p>considered as a safer approach. An enterprise-
</p>
<p>wide implementation is considerably more 
</p>
<p>risky, but allows the firm to begin taking 
</p>
<p>advantage of all of the system&rsquo;s benefits much 
</p>
<p>sooner since the system rolls out over all busi-
</p>
<p>ness units simultaneously.
</p>
<p>CRM is a valuable resource for any com-
</p>
<p>pany that wishes to gain insight into customer 
</p>
<p>behavior. It can cut costs, increase revenues 
</p>
<p>and make a significant impact on the pro-
</p>
<p>ductivity of a company. While implementing 
</p>
<p>a CRM system can prove to a mine field of 
</p>
<p>danger, with careful consideration of avail-
</p>
<p>able options and conscientious management 
</p>
<p>of the problem, the minefield can be safely 
</p>
<p>negotiated, leading to the successful imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of a CRM system.
</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. Implementing CRM globally has greater 
</p>
<p>challenges and complexities, including 
</p>
<p>language barriers, and colloquial nuances 
</p>
<p>of doing business. In India, for example, 
</p>
<p>a country with 22 official languages and 
</p>
<p>1652 other languages recognized by the 
</p>
<p>Indian Census, culture and language will 
</p>
<p>vary slightly from state to state. This will 
</p>
<p>inevitably require producers of CRM soft-
</p>
<p>ware or services, to understand its global 
</p>
<p>firms, and be able to strategically analyze 
</p>
<p>the data of its foreign-to-them customers 
</p>
<p>(Schaeffer, 2017).
</p>
<p> 2. Some countries have laws that requires 
</p>
<p>software to be translated in the native 
</p>
<p>language where it is used, which means 
</p>
<p>updating the software to fit the laws of 
</p>
<p>the land where it is being used. This pro-
</p>
<p>cess is called country localization. Micro-
</p>
<p>soft Dynamics AX, for example, is required 
</p>
<p>to format financial reporting tools and 
</p>
<p>tax regulations to the country, as well as 
</p>
<p>translate the software language for coun-
</p>
<p>tries such as Saudi Arabia, Australia, Mex-
</p>
<p>ico, Iceland, German, Thailand, Sweden, 
</p>
<p>Spain and many others (Encore Business, 
</p>
<p>2011).
</p>
<p> 3. In some countries, before CRM can be 
</p>
<p>implemented, considerations about 
</p>
<p>how fast the system runs must be 
</p>
<p>answered. CRM systems can have severe 
</p>
<p>performance issues in certain regions 
</p>
<p>of the world, so it&rsquo;s important to know 
</p>
<p>what the expected internet latency is 
</p>
<p>for generating data from each transac-
</p>
<p>tion. South Korea is the current world 
</p>
<p>leader for hosting the fastest internet, 
</p>
<p>followed by Japan and Hong Kong, at 
</p>
<p>speeds that exceed 16 Mbps. In Swe-
</p>
<p>den, Norway, Finland and Denmark, the 
</p>
<p>Scandinavian region boasts the second 
</p>
<p>highest internet speeds, an average of 
</p>
<p>16Mbps. By contrast, the United States&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>average is 14.2 Mbps, but it is the fast-
</p>
<p>est among North, Central and South 
</p>
<p>American countries (Fast Metrics, 2017).

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>To retain customers, many firms focus on 
</p>
<p>increasing customer satisfaction levels. And 
</p>
<p>the degree of customer satisfaction is a key 
</p>
<p>measure. But the extent to which customer 
</p>
<p>satisfaction leads to loyalty and thus profit-
</p>
<p>ability remains an important issue to be exam-
</p>
<p>ined. Traditionally, customer satisfaction has 
</p>
<p>been expected to increase retention or loyalty, 
</p>
<p>thus leading to greater profits, as we intro-
</p>
<p>duced in 7 Chap. 2. Although customer satis-
faction and loyalty are key mediators of profit, 
</p>
<p>they cannot be taken as simple predictors 
</p>
<p>of it. From a business standpoint, it is more 
</p>
<p>important to identify and nurture relation-
</p>
<p>ships specifically with profitable customers.
</p>
<p>This is where loyalty programs come in. 
</p>
<p>Loyalty programs (LP) represent an impor-
</p>
<p>tant CRM tool that can identify, reward, and 
</p>
<p>successfully retain profitable customers. We 
</p>
<p>discuss the objectives and design of various 
</p>
<p>loyalty programs in 7 Sects. 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 
10.4 and 10.5. We also illustrate LP failures to 
</p>
<p>offer insights into what distinguishes a suc-
</p>
<p>cessful program from unsuccessful ones. By 
</p>
<p>reviewing LP characteristics, we also can sys-
</p>
<p>tematically investigate outcomes and deter-
</p>
<p>minants of LP success and provide guidelines 
</p>
<p>for designing optimal programs. The key 
</p>
<p>dimensions of LP design, such as reward and 
</p>
<p>sponsorship, are explained in detail and illus-
</p>
<p>trated using relevant case studies.
</p>
<p>The second part of this chapter then 
</p>
<p>deals with the effectiveness of loyalty pro-
</p>
<p>grams. In the past two decades, many firms 
</p>
<p>have established some type of customer 
</p>
<p>LP.&nbsp;Typically, these programs offer financial 
</p>
<p>and/or relationship rewards to customers. 
</p>
<p>In most cases, the aim is to increase sales 
</p>
<p>revenue by increasing usage/purchase levels 
</p>
<p>or engaging in up- and cross-selling. Loyalty 
</p>
<p>programs also promise stronger relationships 
</p>
<p>with customers. But they are not costless 
</p>
<p>for the provider. Before any firm establishes 
</p>
<p>an LP, it must ask: What is the cost effective-
</p>
<p>ness of this program? What differentiates 
</p>
<p>an effective LP from an ineffective one? 
</p>
<p>What key drivers ensure the effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of loyalty programs? Understanding goals 
</p>
<p>and design characteristics are critical means 
</p>
<p>to develop and implement effective loyalty 
</p>
<p>programs. It is equally, if not more, important 
</p>
<p>to understand and monitor the features that 
</p>
<p>make an LP effective; we suggest four such 
</p>
<p>drivers. Therefore, after we present some 
</p>
<p>empirical evidence about the performance of 
</p>
<p>LPs across various industry segments, we use 
</p>
<p>two case studies to reveal how firms can cre-
</p>
<p>ate competitive advantages through loyalty 
</p>
<p>programs that are geared to attaining profits 
</p>
<p>and value alignment. With this information, 
</p>
<p>we derive a seven-point checklist for the suc-
</p>
<p>cessful design and implementation of loyalty 
</p>
<p>programs.
</p>
<p>10.1  What Is Loyalty? Behavioral 
Versus Attitudinal Loyalty
</p>
<p>Loyal customers generate more repeat business, 
develop a larger tolerance to price increases, and 
are more profitable to the firm. This conventional 
wisdom has long been accepted, but as we have 
shown, it is not always true. A very loyal customer 
may consume an inordinate amount of firm 
resources by demanding services and discounts. 
But marketers want to locate and entice new cus-
tomers who are profitable, while also finding 
appropriate strategies to identify and possibly 
release unprofitable customers.
</p>
<p>In 7 Chap. 1, we noted the concept of customer 
value, defined as the economic value ($-metric) of 
the customer relationship to the firm, expressed 
</p>
<p>as a contribution margin or net profit. As a mar-
keting metric, customer value provides an impor-
tant decision aid, beyond its capability to evaluate 
marketing effectiveness. A firm can both measure 
and optimize its marketing efforts by incorporat-
ing the concept of customer value in the core of its 
decision-making processes.
</p>
<p>Although customer loyalty to a product or 
service, manifested as repeat purchases, may be 
due to natural satisfaction and preference for the 
products&rsquo; features and benefits, loyalty also can be 
induced through marketing plans and programs. 
For example, wireless cellular phone service 
requires a 1&ndash;2-year contractual relationship with 
the customer&nbsp;&ndash; an indirect way of ensuring repet-
itive and profitable transactions for a predictable 
period of time.
</p>

<p/>
</div>

</p>

</p>
<p>Whether contractual or motivated through 
incentives, the success or failure of a LP depends 
ultimately on the profitability of the customer. 
The longevity of the relationship also does not 
automatically translate into tangible profitability. 
Rather, various customer loyalty programs work 
to identify, reward, and retain specifically profit-
able customers.
</p>
<p>Before reviewing the structure of these  various 
loyalty programs, it is important to understand 
the significant difference between behavioral and 
attitudinal loyalty. Broadly speaking, behavioral 
loyalty refers to the observed actions that custom-
ers have demonstrated toward a particular prod-
uct or service. Attitudinal loyalty instead refers to 
a customer&rsquo;s perceptions and attitudes toward a 
particular product or service. Ideally, there should 
be a strong correlation between a customers&rsquo; atti-
tudes and behaviors, though in some instances, 
customer behaviors differ radically from their atti-
tudinal perceptions about the product or service.
</p>
<p>10.2  What Is a&nbsp;Loyalty Program? 
Definition and&nbsp;Key Objectives
</p>
<p>In recent years, many companies have introduced 
loyalty programs (LPs), frequent reward pro-
grams, customer magazines, online communities 
and blogs, or customer clubs (Kreutzer, 2016). An 
LP comprises a marketing process that generates 
rewards for customers, based on their repeat pur-
chases or engagement with the brand. As we use 
it, the term LP subsumes the many different forms 
of reward programs. Therefore, we recognize that 
</p>
<p>consumers who enter an LP likely transact more 
with the focal company and give up some of the 
free choice they possess otherwise. In exchange 
for concentrating their purchases and relational 
interactions with the focal firm, they accumulate 
assets (e.g., points), which they may exchange for 
products and services, usually those associated 
with the focal firm. Because of these characteris-
tics, LPs offer an important CRM tool that mar-
keters use to identify, award, and retain profitable 
customers.
</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that they are new additions 
in the relationship marketer&rsquo;s toolkit. Sainsbury 
(UK) archives show that in the 1970s, its managers 
wrote to customers who had not made their usual 
shopping trips, in an effort to encourage and main-
tain their patronage. Later, the store used a Green 
Stamps initiative, which customers enjoyed, despite 
the demand that they paste the stamps into many 
books before receiving any reward (Passingham, 
1998).
</p>
<p>Overall, the key objectives of introducing LPs 
consist of four categories:
 1. Building true (attitudinal and behavioral) 
</p>
<p>loyalty
 2. Efficiency profits
 3. Effectiveness profits
 4. Value alignment
</p>
<p>Any loyalty program implemented by a firm may 
pursue all or only some of these goals at the same 
time.
</p>
<p>10.2.1  Building True Loyalty
</p>
<p>An LP aims to build greater customer commit-
ment to the product or organization by garnering 
true loyalty, which combines elements of both 
attitudinal and behavioral loyalty. According to 
this logic, customers exhibit behavioral loyalty 
(i.e., purchase a product repeatedly) for several 
reasons, including convenience or price, as well as 
a sense of loyalty. Behavioral loyalty may result 
from attitudinal loyalty, but it can be driven by 
other factors too.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, though many LPs have the goal 
of &laquo;making customers more loyal,&raquo; the outcomes 
of true loyalty&nbsp;&ndash; greater commitment, greater word 
of mouth, and so on&nbsp; &ndash; are difficult to observe. 
Enforcing loyalty by enticing customers with 
rewards and bonuses is unlikely to create true loy-
</p>
<p>A Case in&nbsp;Point
A frequent flyer member of ABC airlines might 
</p>
<p>continue the relationship only because she has 
</p>
<p>accrued many points and wants to redeem her 
</p>
<p>miles. Although her attitudinal preference is to 
</p>
<p>travel with XYZ airlines, because of its superior 
</p>
<p>quality of service and experience, she feels 
</p>
<p>compelled to continue transacting with ABC.&nbsp;In 
</p>
<p>this situation, her relationship with ABC reflects 
</p>
<p>strong behavioral loyalty, while her negative 
</p>
<p>perceptions of it reflect poor attitudinal loyalty. 
</p>
<p>Attitudinal loyalty is extremely important; 
</p>
<p>customers who are not attitudinally loyal likely 
</p>
<p>terminate the relationship at the earliest available 
</p>
<p>opportunity. As we will find, not all loyalty 
</p>
<p>programs are interested in creating attitudinal 
</p>
<p>loyalty with the target customers.
</p>

<p/>

</p>
<p>alty, because true loyalty instead is a function of the 
value provided to customers. It encompasses vari-
ous factors: Degree of involvement in the product 
category, visibility of product usage, or the value 
expressive nature of the product, to name a few. 
None of these aspects can be controlled by the firm.
</p>
<p>Take, for example, a low-involvement cate-
gory&nbsp;&ndash; grocery shopping. Inducing true loyalty for 
grocery shoppers is a tough proposition, because 
their purchases are nearly always driven by tangi-
ble considerations, such as value for money.
</p>
<p>10.2.2  Efficiency Profits
</p>
<p>Efficiency profits result from a change in the cus-
tomer&rsquo;s buying behavior, induced by the LP.&nbsp;This 
change in behavior can be measured in several 
ways:
</p>
<p> 5 Basket size
 5 Purchase frequency acceleration
 5 Price sensitivity
 5 Share of category requirements (SCR) or 
</p>
<p>share of wallet
 5 Retention
 5 Lifetime duration
</p>
<p>The most widely used measure of behavioral loy-
alty is SCR, which describes the extent of purchases 
in a category that are served by the focal brand or 
retailer. Efficiency profits are net of LP cost. An LP 
that attempts to generate efficiency profits works 
on the assumption that customers build up switch-
ing costs when they accumulate loyalty-based 
assets. This accumulation encourages them to 
forgo their free choice, because the expected reward 
makes this reduction appear worthwhile.
</p>
<p>There are two key criticisms of this viewpoint. 
First, for a customer to engage in an LP, the over-
all utility of being in the LP must be higher than 
the utility of not being in the LP.&nbsp;The cost for the 
firm to entice the customer to change behavior 
accordingly may be higher than it would be with-
out the LP.&nbsp; Carlos Criado-Perez, the one-time 
CEO of Safeway (1999&ndash;2004), thus traded off the 
benefits: &laquo;Scrapping Safeway&rsquo;s (UK) ABC loyalty 
card scheme saves it &pound;50 million this year, money 
that will be invested in cutting prices.&raquo;1
</p>
<p>1 Interview with Carlos Criado-Perez, CEO Safeway (UK), 
</p>
<p>on BBC News (May 4, 2000).
</p>
<p>Second, a goal of efficiency profits implies that 
the customer segment most likely to join the LP 
consists of those who are truly loyal anyway, so 
their business is already likely. In this case, the 
question arises about whether LPs actually change 
buying behavior. Perhaps they do not change 
behavior as much as they reinforce existing 
behavior, but at a much higher cost to the firm. 
For example, loyalty cards have been criticized for 
rewarding heavy spending rather than true loy-
alty. The segments most interested in these plans 
tend to be affluent groups who can afford to build 
up points, even if they hold cards from more than 
one store.2
</p>
<p>Yet, despite the difficulty associated with 
achieving efficiency profits, many LPs are intro-
duced with just this goal in mind. However, the 
upcoming LP trend to reward customers for their 
engagement behavior with the brand and not only 
purchase behavior, fosters attitudinal loyalty.
</p>
<p>10.2.3  Effectiveness Profits
</p>
<p>Effectiveness profits refer to the medium- to long- 
term profit consequences realized through the 
development of better knowledge about customer 
preferences. The LP is designed to gather infor-
mation about individuals, their behavior, and 
their preferences and then to derive knowledge 
from this information. This process of learning 
allows the firm to improve its knowledge of cus-
tomer preferences and to offer increasingly better- 
tailored value propositions to various customers. 
The improvement in the value proposition comes 
through effective product and communication 
offerings. Effectiveness profits&nbsp; &ndash; more than any 
other type of LP outcome&nbsp;&ndash; are likely to generate 
sustainable competitive advantages and yield the 
highest profits in the long run.
</p>
<p> Achieving Effectiveness Profits 
in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Grocery Store
</p>
<p>Effectiveness profits require an information-based 
strategy that gathers and analyzes information 
about every transaction. For example, in grocery 
retailing, the system must collect information 
about every item purchased, down to the color of

</p>
<p>ink in a pen, along with the time of day, weather, 
and even the checkout operator&rsquo;s name. Such data 
mining can generate personalized promotions 
and recommendations so that a vegetarian never 
receives a promotion for steaks. The knowledge 
that a customer is a vegetarian might come from 
either surveys or previous buying behavior. If the 
store&rsquo;s computer recognizes that a customer never 
buys meat, it can predict that the customer is a 
vegetarian, and not that she is buying her meat 
elsewhere. Although this assumption could be 
wrong, a store would rather not bother a cus-
tomer with costly promotions for categories from 
which that customer has never bought anything. 
Implementing mobile loyalty programs pushes 
the information gathering process to a new era, 
allowing for real-time two-way communica-
tion. For example, by using new technologies i.e. 
&laquo;geo- fencing&raquo; retailers can identify mobile LP 
 members nearby the store and send personalized 
promotions to drive store traffic and purchases.
</p>
<p>Promotions of new products rely on an ideas 
list, populated by both new launches and existing 
products that the data mining algorithms suggest 
specific customers might desire. For example, if a 
customer buys a lot of California Chardonnay, the 
list might suggest that he is likely to try a white 
Burgundy on special promotion, because it is made 
from the same grape. Staples or Safeway use their 
accumulated customers&rsquo; knowledge by targeting LP 
members with digital coupons and personalized 
deals. The strategy of using an LP to learn about 
customer preferences thus can result in value, as well 
as impressive gains, for both customers and organi-
zations. Customers get more of what they truly 
want; firms avoid costly, mass marketing exercises. 
However, a learning strategy demands a relatively 
high process sophistication for its implementation. 
The collection of massive amounts of data may 
have grown easier, but analyzing, learning about, 
and implementing the conclusions obtained is 
much more difficult. Few companies have mastered 
this strategic capability to a satisfactory extent.
</p>
<p>10.2.4  Value Alignment
</p>
<p>Finally, value alignment aims to match the cost to 
serve a particular customer with the value that the 
person brings to the firm. The underlying concept 
states that for any industry, customers have differ-
ential monetary value to firms, and they also are 
</p>
<p>differentially expensive to serve. For example, if a 
provider of wireless services were to arrange its 
customers from highest to lowest value, it might 
discover that its business users generate higher 
phone bills than casual, occasional users. Likewise, 
if it were to arrange the same customers according 
to the costs of serving them, it would find some 
customers easy to satisfy, whereas others exploit 
the customer service function constantly. If a firm 
pursues value alignment, it simply attempts to 
align the profits it receives from a given customer 
with the cost incurred to serve that customer. 
Clearly, not every customer is treated equally&nbsp;&ndash; a 
notion some managers find discomforting. 
However, this differentiation allows firms to 
ensure that their best customers get their best ser-
vice. The goal of value alignment is particularly 
critical when there is great heterogeneity in cus-
tomers&rsquo; value and costs to serve, such as in the 
airline, hospitality, or financial services industries.
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;10.1 illustrates an example of a firm with 
a highly heterogeneous customer base. It indi-
</p>
<p>cates the profitability of a bank, derived from 
</p>
<p>three very different customer profiles: Tier A rep-
</p>
<p>resents 31% of the customer base, whereas Tier B 
</p>
<p>makes up 42%, and Tier C makes up the remain-
</p>
<p>ing 27% of the customer base. More than one-
</p>
<p>quarter of these customers are unprofitable and 
</p>
<p>must be subsidized by the highly profitable 
</p>
<p>ones&nbsp;&ndash; a condition not uncommon in banks.
</p>
<p>If this bank were to institute an LP, it might pur-
sue the four different LP goals. If it chooses a par-
ticular goal, how can it achieve that outcome most 
effectively? Such an assessment requires a more 
detailed understanding of the impact of the driv-
ers of LP success. That is, to reach the goals of an 
LP, it seems useful to understand some of their 
characteristics, including the suitability of the 
goal, cost structures, challenges involved, and the 
degree of competitive advantage created, as sum-
marized in . Table&nbsp;10.1.

<p>acquire new ones, firms across a multitude of 
industries raced to implement some form of loy-
alty schemes. Thus the growth in LP usage has 
been staggering. In 2012, U.S. loyalty programs 
exceeded 2.65 billion, increasing by 26.7% since 
2010 (Berry, 2013) and the average U.S. house-
hold holds 22 loyalty program cards, actively 
using 10 of those memberships (BCG, 2014).
</p>
<p>Some quantitative examples and the summa-
ries attest to this growth:
</p>
<p> 5 In 2015, &laquo;PAYBACK&raquo;, Germany&rsquo;s largest loy-
alty program and couponing platform, docu-
mented 28 million membership accounts and 
10 million mobile app downloads. Eight out 
of ten Germans know the brand Payback.

<p> 5 By 2002, there were more than 120 million 
airline frequent flyers worldwide, with most 
residing in the United States (74 million), 
Europe (24 million), and Asia (21 million) 
(Webflyer, 2011). From 2002 to 2006 the num-
ber airline frequent flyers increased by 60 mil-
lion users worldwide. The 180 users denote 10 
trillion outstanding miles (Webflyer, 2016).
</p>
<p> 5 &laquo;American Advantage&raquo; is the largest frequent 
flyer program in the world. As of December 
2009, its membership rolls boasted more than 
64 million members (AMR Corporation, 
2009).
</p>
<p> 5 With 56 million members globally, who con-
tribute $6.5 billion in room revenue, IHG&rsquo;s 
(InterContinental Hotels Group) &laquo;Priority 
Club&raquo; Rewards is one of the first, largest, and 
fastest growing guest loyalty program in the 
hotel industry. The program adds 600,000 
members monthly and offers points for stays 
in 4300 hotels in nearly 100 countries world-
wide. Members can redeem points for future 
hotel stays, airline miles on more than 40 
partner airlines, car rentals, gift certificates, or 
hundreds of products available in a rewards 
catalog (IHG, 2010).
</p>
<p> 5 In the highly competitive U.K. retail industry, 
Tesco has managed to double its earnings 
by taking market share from rivals such as 
Sainsbury&rsquo;s. Its success has been credited to 
its popular customer loyalty program, which 
enables shoppers to earn points and redeem 
them on future visits or with airlines (ABC, 
2003). Tesco gained the position as market 
leader&nbsp;- with more than 30 percent market 
share (Ruddick, 2014).
</p>
<p> 5 The French retailer E.&nbsp;Leclerc spends approxi-
mately $23.5 million each year for LP market-
ing and management (Meyer-Waarden, 2007).3
</p>
<p> 5 According to VSS Communications Indus-
try Forecast, U.S. companies devoted $2.18 
billion to loyalty programs in 2008 (Odell, 
2009). Just a few years ago, in 2003, Gartner 
analyst Adam Sarner declared that U.S. com-
panies spent more than $1.2 billion on cus-
tomer loyalty programs (Young &amp; Stepanek, 
2003). This enormous growth reflects the 
great popularity of loyalty programs.
</p>
<p> 5 After changing the loyalty program in 2015 
the Wyndham Hotel Group denotes 7 million 
people joining the reward program, which 
reflects an increase of 17 percent in member-
ship. LP members receive a reward bonus of 
13.6 percent on their spending level (McCart-
ney, 2016).
</p>
<p>5 Amazon developed as the gold standard 
in ecommerce. With its loyalty program 
Amazon Prime the online retailer provides 
valuable benefits to its consumer by deliver-
ing the products fast and free. Besides these 
major benefits, Amazon offers a range of 
benefits such as streaming services of movies 
and music, cloud services, and early access to 
selected deals. In turn these customers drive 
benefits to the company as well. A prime cus-
tomer spends 150 percent more on Amazon 
after becoming prime member (Tuttle, 2013).
</p>
<p>The most well-known examples of loyalty pro-
grams remain frequent flyer programs. American 
Airlines was the first, establishing its &laquo;Advantage&raquo; 
program in 1981. During the 1990s, supermarket 
chains and general merchandise retailers followed 
suit and established loyalty programs, such as the 
&laquo;Carte de Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;&raquo; program offered by the French 
retail chain Carrefour or the &laquo;Club-Card&raquo; at 
Tesco. The latest form of loyalty programs involves 
point collection schemes initiated by third parties 
(e.g., Webmiles, PAYBACK), where users collect 
points across a network of member companies. 
The collection procedure is facilitated by mobile 
LP applications, which provide additional features 
(i.e., payment function, digital coupons) enhanc-
ing the LP&rsquo;s value for the customer.

<p>CRM at Work 10.1
 Frequent-Flyer Programs
</p>
<p>In the airline industry, five main 
</p>
<p>factors drive customers&rsquo; choices of 
</p>
<p>providers: market coverage, price, 
</p>
<p>schedule, frequent flyer programs, 
</p>
<p>and product attributes. For many 
</p>
<p>years, the common belief in the 
</p>
<p>airline industry was that loyal 
</p>
<p>customers were more profitable, 
</p>
<p>so by rewarding customers based 
</p>
<p>on the miles they flew, the airline 
</p>
<p>could increase their loyalty. But 
</p>
<p>there were some serious shortcom-
</p>
<p>ings in this approach. By rewarding 
</p>
<p>all passengers equally, the airline 
</p>
<p>failed to maximize the value for its 
</p>
<p>most profitable customers. Seat 
</p>
<p>class and fare types were ignored 
</p>
<p>in the reward system. When it 
</p>
<p>realized this flaw, the airline 
</p>
<p>industry moved away from basing 
</p>
<p>rewards on miles flown; Airlines, 
</p>
<p>United, Continental, and USAir all 
</p>
<p>multiply the miles flown by a 
</p>
<p>customer by a coefficient derived 
</p>
<p>from the type of seat class the 
</p>
<p>customer paid to receive.
</p>
<p>Passengers willing to pay to 
</p>
<p>upgrade to business or first class 
</p>
<p>thus earn more miles and get 
</p>
<p>rewarded sooner and more often. 
</p>
<p>In contrast, customers who hunt for 
</p>
<p>bargains and purchase deeply 
</p>
<p>discounted tickets far in advance or 
</p>
<p>at the last minute earn far fewer 
</p>
<p>miles than those who pay the full 
</p>
<p>fare. This practice makes sense 
</p>
<p>conceptually: bargain-hunting 
</p>
<p>customers tend to be loyal to 
</p>
<p>finding a bargain than to a reward 
</p>
<p>card program or a specific airline. 
</p>
<p>By increasing the rewards granted 
</p>
<p>to passengers who are willing to 
</p>
<p>pay more per seat than the average 
</p>
<p>passenger, the airlines maximize 
</p>
<p>the benefits for their most 
</p>
<p>profitable customers while minimiz-
</p>
<p>ing rewards for bargain hunters.
</p>
<p>Consider Southwest Airline&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>reward program. It initially was 
</p>
<p>based on the number of flights 
</p>
<p>each passenger took, and eight 
</p>
<p>round-trip flights earned the person 
</p>
<p>a free round-trip flight. In terms of 
</p>
<p>rewards, a flight from Providence, 
</p>
<p>Rhode Island, to Baltimore, 
</p>
<p>Maryland, was worth the same as a 
</p>
<p>flight from Baltimore to Las Vegas, 
</p>
<p>Nevada&nbsp;&ndash; despite the great 
</p>
<p>difference in distance. On a 
</p>
<p>conceptual level, it might make 
</p>
<p>sense, because the cost of 
</p>
<p>operating a plane is largely 
</p>
<p>independent of the distance flown; 
</p>
<p>flight crew, airport desks, and 
</p>
<p>luggage handling costs are all 
</p>
<p>constant. But customers who fly 
</p>
<p>longer distances tend to pay more, 
</p>
<p>because fares reflect distances. This 
</p>
<p>extra revenue gets offset by the 
</p>
<p>cost of the extra fuel used during 
</p>
<p>the flight and the fewer per-day 
</p>
<p>flights for a plane on a longer route.
</p>
<p>But the conceptual argument 
</p>
<p>was not sufficiently convincing. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, Southwest relaunched 
</p>
<p>its frequent flyer program as the 
</p>
<p>&laquo;All-New Rapid Rewards&raquo; in March 
</p>
<p>2011, basing the rewards on 
</p>
<p>dollars spent on flights by 
</p>
<p>customers. Similar to other airline 
</p>
<p>programs, this LP takes different 
</p>
<p>fare types into account. It also 
</p>
<p>allows passengers to earn points 
</p>
<p>with partners in the retailing, 
</p>
<p>lodging, dining, rental car, and 
</p>
<p>banking industries.
</p>
<p>Finally, the new program 
</p>
<p>features a four-tier system that 
</p>
<p>distinguishes Standard, A-List, 
</p>
<p>A-List Preferred, and Companion 
</p>
<p>Status customers. To reach A-List 
</p>
<p>Status, a flyer must take 25 
</p>
<p>qualifying one-way flights or earn 
</p>
<p>35,000 Tier Qualifying Points in a 
</p>
<p>calendar year. These members 
</p>
<p>then enjoy benefits such as priority 
</p>
<p>boarding, 25% earning bonus, and 
</p>
<p>an A-List dedicated phone line for 
</p>
<p>customer service. Companion 
</p>
<p>Status (reached with 100 
</p>
<p>qualifying one-way flights or 
</p>
<p>110,000 Tier Qualifying Points in a 
</p>
<p>calendar year) allows the member 
</p>
<p>to designate a companion and 
</p>
<p>receive a free ticket for that 
</p>
<p>companion on every flight the 
</p>
<p>member takes during the year. 
</p>
<p>With this revision, Southwest 
</p>
<p>attracts the business of high-value 
</p>
<p>customers who tend to fly at least 
</p>
<p>once a week.

</p>
<p>Although LPs have become immensely pop-
ular, it is far from clear whether they actually 
help firms engender greater customer loyalty 
and higher profits, partly because of the consid-
erable cost associated with managing an LP, and 
partly because their management can be so com-
plex.
</p>
<p>10.3.1 Examples of Loyalty Programs
</p>
<p> 5 Frequent buyer programs: The simplest 
initiatives are based on punch-cards that offer 
a free complimentary product. City Bagels, a 
sandwich retail chain, offers customers a tenth 
</p>
<p>sandwich free, after they garner nine stamps 
from previous purchases. The purpose is to 
increase both sandwich consumption and 
customer retention. Stores such as BigY, 
Kroger, and CVS offer discounts on certain 
store merchandise to cardholders, to ensure 
their loyalty and retention.
</p>
<p> 5 Volkswagen Club and Card: The Volkswagen 
Club and Card concept attempts to establish a 
direct relationship with end customers. 
Customers collect points when Volkswagen 
(VW) services their car or if they buy VW 
accessories, as well as from partners, such as 
car rental companies and tour operators. The 
points can be redeemed for dealer services,

</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>price reductions on car purchases, or catalog 
merchandise. The purpose is to establish a 
better communication between VW dealers 
and customers, to bind them more closely to 
the brand.
</p>
<p> 5 Star Alliance Frequent Flyer Program: The 
Star Alliance is a group of 28 airlines across 
all continents that cross-list flights, share 
facilities, and recognize their respective 
frequent flyer programs. Any flight on any 
Star Alliance airline counts toward a 
member&rsquo;s frequent flyer program. With 
more than 1300 airports in 190 countries 
worldwide, the Star Alliance has become 
one of the largest airline network in the 
world.
</p>
<p> 5 Starbucks Rewards Plus: Starbucks revolu-
tionized how customers interact with 
companies by integrating the LP into a 
mobile application, customer can find stores 
nearby, pay for their purchases and collect 
bonus points for their purchases and store 
visits. The transactions made by the mobile 
app account for more than 20 percent 
(PYMNTS, 2016).
</p>
<p> 5 Payback: Germany&rsquo;s largest loyalty program 
and couponing platform, introduced the 
mobile payment app. The app is not only a 
digital loyalty card, but its payment func-
tion generates additional value for Payback 
cardholders by higher transactional 
convenience level. The app has been 
downloaded by 8.5 million members and 
generates 3.5 million transactions per day 
(Fuchs, 2016).
</p>
<p> 5 Neiman Marcus: A luxury retailer based in 
Dallas, Texas, Neiman Marcus offers its 
&laquo;InCircle&raquo; LP to all its customers. Using a 
shopping card, customers accumulate points 
that can be redeemed for exclusive rewards.
</p>
<p>10.4  Problems with&nbsp;Loyalty 
Programs
</p>
<p>Although LPs have become widespread and popu-
lar, the benefits are not always clear. On the one 
side, many companies, such as ANZ Bank, invest 
millions of dollars into this CRM tool, only to find 
that it sucks up great resources without any obvious 
return. On the other side, according to Hlavinka &amp; 
Sullivan (2011) 85 percent of customers that joined 
a loyalty program have not been contacted by the 
company anymore. From consumer perspective, 
the length of time and amount of points needed for 
reward redemption is one of the reasons to aban-
don loyalty programs (Bond Loyalty Report, 2016).
</p>
<p>Examples such as this may mark the begin-
ning of a trend, in which large corporations that 
have spent millions of marketing dollars on LPs 
closely evaluate their costs and tailor reward pro-
grams more accurately to achieve better profit-
ability.
</p>
<p>Most companies need to revisit their business 
model, not only to reflect on the impact of loyalty 
programs on their bottom line, but also to deter-
mine how customer service initiatives add value 
and ensure future revenue streams. For some 
companies, this reassessment leads to the decision 
to eliminate any further investments in loyalty 
programs.
</p>
<p>The LP test run by the U.K. chain ASDA 
Supermarkets (purchased by Walmart in 1999) 
cost &pound;8 million in 1&nbsp;year. The company chose not 
to invest in a full rollout, which would have cost 
&pound;60 million (Direct Marketing, 2011). According 
to a spokesperson for ASDA, &laquo;We decided we 
didn&rsquo;t have to invest in points and plastic to make 
our customers loyal.&raquo; And this assessment seems 
accurate: At the time it tested its pilot LP, ASDA&rsquo;s 
market share was 17.2%. A year later, it had risen 
to 17.6%.
</p>
<p>CRM at Work 10.2
 Example: ANZ Bank
</p>
<p>In May 2003, ANZ Bank (Australia&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>third-largest bank) increased its 
</p>
<p>annual fees by $50 on credit cards 
</p>
<p>linked to its reward programs. This 
</p>
<p>increase was primarily due to the 
</p>
<p>increased point acquisition by 
</p>
<p>frequent flyers and the potential 
</p>
<p>fee reduction for inter-bank credit 
</p>
<p>card transactions (Moneymanager, 
</p>
<p>2011). Specifically, ANZ Bank 
</p>
<p>planned to raise fees on credit card 
</p>
<p>holders who paid their balance 
</p>
<p>monthly (taking advantage of the 
</p>
<p>interest-free period). This was a 
</p>
<p>wake-up call for corporations that 
</p>
<p>had invested their marketing 
</p>
<p>dollars in LPs (Kjellerup, 2003), 
</p>
<p>because the primary reason for the 
</p>
<p>price hikes was to stem losses 
</p>
<p>incurred by the cost of running 
</p>
<p>credit card related reward 
</p>
<p>programs. The costs had risen to 
</p>
<p>the point that the programs no 
</p>
<p>longer were sustainable. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>the bank needed to choose: reduce 
</p>
<p>reward program benefits or 
</p>
<p>increase annual fees to pass some 
</p>
<p>of the costs on to customers.

</p>
<p>Safeway terminated its LP in April 2000, which 
saved the company approximately $85 million in 
annual LP costs.4 This chain&rsquo;s rationale was that 
&laquo;People have lost interest in (loyalty card) points 
and don&rsquo;t think they give value. What they really 
appreciate are straightforward product offers at 
great prices,&raquo; according to the CEO Carlos Criado- 
Perez in May 2000.
</p>
<p>A few years ago, Continental Airlines down-
graded its liberal upgrading policy because it was 
too expensive. The company estimated a $100 
million loss in revenue from upset frequent flyers. 
A class action suit also followed. What initially 
was designed to be a customer LP turned out to be 
a disappointing failure.
</p>
<p>Despite their immense popularity, the aspects 
that distinguish a successful LP from an unsuccess-
ful one remain unclear. Our discussion in the next 
section therefore reviews several LP characteristics 
to investigate the outcomes and determinants of 
LP success systematically, and thus to provide 
guidelines for designing optimal programs.
</p>
<p>10.5  Design Characteristics 
of&nbsp;Loyalty Programs
</p>
<p>The multitudes of LPs attest to the various discre-
tionary choices that arise for designers of such pro-
grams. Furthermore, LPs differ substantially both 
within and across industries. Managers can exer-
cise discretion regarding the composition and the 
choice of dimensions to include in their LP design, 
as well as the corresponding weights assigned to 
each dimension. In this sense, we characterize LPs 
along the following key dimensions, which must 
be defined when designing a program:
</p>
<p> 5 Reward mechanism
 5 Reward structure
</p>
<p> 5 Hard versus soft rewards
 5 Product proposition support (choice of 
rewards)
</p>
<p> 5 Aspirational value of reward
 5 Rate of rewards
 5 Tiering of rewards
 5 Timing of rewards
 5 Rewards based on specific criteria
</p>
<p> 5 Participation requirements
 5 Voluntary or automatic enrollment
</p>
<p>4 Based on 1 British Pound&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.7 USD, as of November 
</p>
<p>25, 2003.
</p>
<p> 5 Open versus closed LP
 5 Automatic or manual point accumulation
</p>
<p> 5 Payment function
 5 Sponsorship (existence of partner network, 
</p>
<p>network externalities)
 5 Single versus multiform LP
 5 Within- versus across-sector LP
 5 Ownership (focal firm versus other firm)
</p>
<p> 5 Cost and revenues of LPs
</p>
<p>10.5.1  Reward Mechanism: 
Transaction- Based Versus 
Engagement-Based
</p>
<p>Reward mechanisms induce consumers to actively 
engage with the brand. Predominantly, reward 
mechanisms are transaction-based awarding con-
sumers for purchases. However, with the increase 
of the digital transformation consumers receive 
rewards based on their engagement-behavior. 
Engagement-based rewarding does not require 
the consumer to finalize a transaction, but award 
the consumer due to his engagement in writing 
reviews, downloading the mobile LP app, com-
municating in social media, or in-store check-ins 
(Taylor, Buvat, Nambiar, Singh, &amp; Radhakrishnan, 
2015). For example, Walgreens introduced &laquo;Balance 
Rewards&raquo;, incentivizing consumers for connecting 
Walgreens mobile app with a digital health tracker. 
For each healthy lifestyle activity loyalty program 
members are awarded points. Lanc&ocirc;me rewards is 
customers not only for their purchases, but also for 
connecting with Lanc&ocirc;me and sharing content.
</p>
<p>10.5.2  Reward Structure
</p>
<p>The principal motivation for consumers to enroll 
in LPs is to accrue benefits from rewards from 
their purchase transactions over time. From a con-
sumer&rsquo;s perspective, the rewards attained through 
an LP membership are the key design benefit.
</p>
<p> Hard Versus Soft Rewards
</p>
<p>Financial or tangible rewards (hard) differ from 
those based on psychological or emotional benefits 
(soft). Hard rewards run the gamut from price 
reductions to promotions and free products to pre-
ferred treatment. For example, a member of KLM&rsquo;s 
&laquo;Flying Dutchman&raquo; frequent flyer program may 
receive a free airline ticket for travel within Europe 
</p>
<p>10.5 &middot; Design Characteristics of&nbsp;Loyalty Programs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>190
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>after collecting 20,000&nbsp;miles&nbsp;&ndash; a hard reward. Soft 
rewards instead are linked to special recognition of 
the buyer, which offers the psychological benefit of 
being treated in a special way or having special sta-
tus. For example, many frequent travelers with 
Silver or Gold status consider their membership in 
the category something special (often called the 
badge effect). Of course, the psychological recogni-
tion of loyalty status often comes with tangible 
benefits, such as preferred customer service (e.g., 
special service phone number).
</p>
<p> Product Proposition Support
</p>
<p>The rewards from a loyalty program may be linked 
to the company&rsquo;s product offering or be entirely 
unrelated. The U.S. bagel franchise Finagle- A-
Bagel operates an LP that allows participants to 
redeem their accumulated bonus points only for 
the firm&rsquo;s own products&nbsp;&ndash; sandwiches and drinks. 
The reward thus directly supports the firm&rsquo;s prod-
uct proposition. Other LPs allow members to 
redeem points for products completely unrelated 
to the focal firm&rsquo;s offering, such as BP&rsquo;s program, 
in which users can redeem points earned from 
gasoline-related purchases for merchandise such 
as first-aid kits, coffee mugs, or Barbie dolls.
</p>
<p> Aspirational Value of&nbsp;Reward
</p>
<p>From time to time, consumers engage in hedonic 
consumption of products that are mainly associ-
ated with pleasure and fun. Research in consumer 
psychology reveals that consumers prefer hedonic 
goods rather than utilitarian ones when receiving 
a gift. Consumers indulge more easily in luxury 
consumption when they get &laquo;something for noth-
ing,&raquo; as in the case of a gift or LP reward. A free 
flight to an exotic destination thus might be worth 
</p>
<p>more to a buyer (at least perceptually) than vouch-
ers for the local supermarket, even if they have the 
same face value. Companies try to differentiate 
their LPs by highlighting the inspirational or 
hedonic value of their rewards. For example, the 
Marriott hotel rewards its loyal customers by 
offering a wide array of cultural events to choose 
from. LP members can be rewarded by receiving 
tickets for the top Broadway shows. Mercedes- 
Benz&rsquo;s LP makes it possible to transform points 
into a flight in a MIG 29 combat aircraft. The 
luxury retailer Neiman Marcus catalogs a list of 
&laquo;wow and cool&raquo; rewards each year&nbsp;&ndash; such as hav-
ing a world-famous photographer visit the cus-
tomer&rsquo;s home to take family pictures.
</p>
<p> Rate of&nbsp;Rewards
</p>
<p>The rate of rewards refers to the ratio of reward value 
to transaction volume (both in monetary terms). In 
other words, it tells you how much a consumer gets 
in return for concentrating his or her purchases. 
Consumers prefer higher reward rates, but reward 
redemptions are a key cost factor for firms that run 
LPs. Rate of rewards is one of the, if not the primary, 
drivers of LP enrollment and active usage.
</p>
<p> Tiering of&nbsp;Rewards
</p>
<p>Rewards follow an asset accumulation response 
function, which describes how assets or rewards get 
accumulated as a function of spending behavior. 
Tiered rewards programs might follow constant, 
hierarchical, offer-related, or cyclical functions. 
With constant rewards, customers receive endur-
ing, stable incentives (See case 1, . Fig.&nbsp;10.2), but 
hierarchical or graded rewards increase with greater 
spending levels (case 2). In the case of offer-related 
assets, customers receive rewards that are exclusive

<p>to a particular special offer, such as PAYBACK&rsquo;s 
10-times points coupons that can be used only dur-
ing a specific time period. Finally, cyclical rewards 
encourage a certain consistency in behavior, such as 
when LP providers use special occasions such as 
Christmas or the customer&rsquo;s birthday to express 
appreciation in the form of a reward.

the same amount of rewards per dollar spent 
regardless of spending level. In case 2 on the right, 
the buyer receives more rewards per dollar spent 
as his or her spending level increases. The pro-
gram in case 2 thus is relatively more attractive for 
high spenders; many airline programs, as well as 
Bloomingdale&rsquo;s, follow this pattern.
</p>
<p> Timing of&nbsp;Rewards
</p>
<p>The timing of reward redemption is an important 
design feature. It is more attractive for the firm to 
create redemption rules that favor long accumula-
tion periods, to ensure customer retention over 
time. This effect is also called lock-in. Customers 
build up assets over time, which function as 
switching costs for them. Customers instead favor 
immediate rewards or short accumulation peri-
ods. Managers must determine how long it takes 
to accumulate assets for a representative reward, 
given a certain buying pattern (e.g., average inter-
purchase time). The timing of rewards should be 
determined by the minimum redemption rules, 
type of reward given, and reward rate. The longer 
it takes to build up a certain reward level, the 
greater the breakage, or the amount of rewards 
never redeemed.
</p>
<p> Rewards Based on&nbsp;Specific Criteria
</p>
<p>Rewards can be designed to fit certain param-
eters, such as the time period, person, catego-
ries/brands, and distribution channels. When 
rewards refer to a specific time period, retailers 
pursue two main goals: generating additional 
revenue and increasing sales during weak sales 
periods. Offering rewards targeted to a specific 
group of card holders, such as customers whose 
last transaction was long ago, can help to activate 
&laquo;sleeping&raquo; customers. Furthermore, some com-
panies tie rewards to specific categories, brands, 
or distribution channels to boost sales in these 
areas.
</p>
<p>10.5.3  Participation Requirements
</p>
<p>Another important characteristic of LPs are the 
requirements for becoming a member and the 
way points get collected.
</p>
<p> Voluntary or Automatic Enrollment
</p>
<p>When designing a loyalty program, companies 
must choose between voluntary and automatic 
enrollment. With automatic enrollment, the 
company deliberately enrolls all of its customers 
in the LP without differentiation. Voluntary 
programs are more common, because they allow 
consumers to self-select if they want to join. 
However, automatic enrollment is an appealing 
option if the company wants to track all con-
sumers&rsquo; transaction data (e.g., banks, credit 
cards).

Nordstorm&rsquo;s Rewards Plus 
</p>
<p>Program
</p>
<p>Nordstrom&rsquo;s Rewards program con-
</p>
<p>sists of four tiers whose levels of 
</p>
<p>rewards to customers vary accord-
</p>
<p>ing to their annual spending level.
</p>
<p>Regardless of spending levels, 
</p>
<p>all members with a Nordstrom&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>credit or debit card receive the 
</p>
<p>benefits of the &laquo;Level 1&raquo; program: 
</p>
<p>earn Nordstrom notes, earn more 
</p>
<p>points for purchases during spe-
</p>
<p>cial bonus point events, get anni-
</p>
<p>versary sale early access, receive 
</p>
<p>personal triple points day(s), be 
</p>
<p>reimbursed for Nordstrom altera-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>The second tier, &laquo;Level 2&raquo; 
</p>
<p>is reserved for members who 
</p>
<p>spend more than $2000 annually. 
</p>
<p>These customers receive the same 
</p>
<p>rewards as Level 1 members, as 
</p>
<p>well as an invitation to a private 
</p>
<p>holiday shopping party.
</p>
<p>The third tier, &laquo;Level 3&raquo; 
</p>
<p>benefits cardholders that spend 
</p>
<p>more than $5000 annually with 
</p>
<p>extraordinary experiences twice 
</p>
<p>per year.
</p>
<p>The pinnacle is the &laquo;Level 4&raquo; 
</p>
<p>cardholder. These customers spend 
</p>
<p>more than $10,000 each year and 
</p>
<p>thus are exclusively offered some 
</p>
<p>of the very best rewards, includ-
</p>
<p>ing exclusive VIP benefits: a spa 
</p>
<p>experience or a dining experience 
</p>
<p>for Level 4 members and a guest. 
</p>
<p>Level 4 members and their guests 
</p>
<p>also have exclusive access to a pri-
</p>
<p>vate fall-fashion shopping event.
</p>
<p>By offering this differentiated 
</p>
<p>rewards program, Nordstrom seeks 
</p>
<p>to distribute the greatest rewards 
</p>
<p>to its best customers. The rebate 
</p>
<p>system effectively pays for itself by 
</p>
<p>generating revenue from customers 
</p>
<p>who carry a balance on their card.
</p>
<p>10.5 &middot; Design Characteristics of&nbsp;Loyalty Programs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>192
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p> Open Versus Closed Loyalty Programs
</p>
<p>Open LPs are accessible to anyone; closed LPs are 
deliberately restricted to a particular group of 
users, usually through the requirement of a mem-
bership fee. Both types of programs offer several 
advantages, as listed in . Table&nbsp;10.2.
</p>
<p> Automatic or Manual Point 
Accumulation
</p>
<p>Most loyalty programs automatically record points, 
once the issued loyalty card is offered at checkout or 
the card number is entered in Internet transactions. 
Some programs such as &laquo;My Coke Rewards&raquo; or 
the German &laquo;Genusspunkte- Programm&raquo; (Nescaf&eacute; 
Dolce Gusto Club) instead require online consum-
ers to enter a code that can be found on products. 
Although consumers generally prefer automatic 
point accumulations, for companies, a manual sys-
tem can be more cost effective.
</p>
<p>10.5.4  Payment Function
</p>
<p>For some LP providers, it has become common 
practice to endow loyalty cards with a payment 
</p>
<p>function. Paying with a loyalty card can facilitate a 
comfortable purchase process for customers, and 
companies benefit as well because it is easier to gen-
erate purchase statistics at the individual customer 
level. In the United States, approximately 60% of all 
consumers own reward-based credit cards. The rel-
evance of combining rewards with credit cards 
offered by retailers is strongly evidenced by Visa 
Claims reward cards, which now make up more 
than half of all credit cards and about 80% of money 
spent on credit (Woolsey &amp; Schulz, 2011).
</p>
<p>Retailers offer two types of loyalty cards that 
include payment functions. If the transactions 
aim to debit the customer&rsquo;s account and credit the 
retailer&rsquo;s account, the card must involve a banking 
partner (open loop). If instead the transactions do 
not actually pay for the purchase but rather grant 
the retailer access to an existing customer account 
(e.g., automatic debit transfer systems), no bank-
ing partner has to participate. The latter form is 
called a closed loop.
</p>
<p>10.5.5  Sponsorship
</p>
<p>The sponsorship function refers to supply-side 
features that describe the LP owner.
</p>
<p> Single- Versus Multi-Firm LP
</p>
<p>Organizations may establish LPs that include only 
transactions with their own customers. For exam-
ple, BP France accepts only transactions by mem-
bers made at BP stations in France. In contrast, 
members of Tesco&rsquo;s &laquo;ClubCard&raquo; accumulate 
points by purchasing from the energy provider 
E.ON or members of Lufthansa&rsquo;s &laquo;Miles and 
More&raquo; program collect and redeem miles from 
purchases at the menswear outfitters Ansons&rsquo;s. 
Such alliances with partners are a major growth 
axis in LP design. The advantage of bringing in 
partners is the increased attraction of LP mem-
bers, who have additional opportunities to accu-
mulate assets. However, the focal company also 
runs the risk that its LP loses meaning if it includes 
too many partners. In this case, customer transac-
tions with the focal vendor and asset accumula-
tion may become completely unrelated.
</p>
<p> Within/Across Sectors
</p>
<p>Another supply-side dimension that is specific to 
multi-firm LP designs is the degree of cross-sector 
partners. That is, do customers accumulate assets 
</p>
<p>       . Table&nbsp;10.2 Open versus closed loyalty

</p>
<p>within the same sector or across different sectors? 
For example, the Star Alliance includes SAS, 
Lufthansa, United Airlines, Varig, and various 
other airlines, so this LP structure covers the same 
sector. However, the LP maintained by AOL and 
American Airlines, with more than 2000 partners, 
spans many industries.
</p>
<p> Ownership
</p>
<p>In multi-firm LPs, the ownership dimension 
reveals who owns the LP in the network. Is it the 
focal firm, a partner firm, or a firm whose sole 
purpose is to manage the LP? An example of the 
latter case is Webmiles, an organization that draws 
together a network of partners across many indus-
tries, with the sole purpose of LP  management.
</p>
<p>10.5.6  Cost and&nbsp;Revenues of&nbsp;LPs
</p>
<p>In an empirical study, Leenheer, Bijmolt, Van 
Heerde, and Smidts (2002) show that the costs 
related to four of the seven loyalty programs they 
analyze are higher than the returns generated. 
Thus, any evaluation of the benefits of LPs must 
consider the various sources of both costs and 
revenues.
</p>
<p>Cost factors include set-up/implementation, 
operating, and variable costs. The implementation 
costs accrue during the phases dedicated to plan-
ning and introducing a loyalty program (e.g., buy-
ing hard- and software, external consultancy, 
personnel training, initial promotions). After the 
LP has been launched, several expenses persist: 
</p>
<p>maintenance of a service center, administration of 
the customer database, and (if applicable) inven-
tory costs for the rewards themselves. Finally, 
variable expenses include discounts, rewards, 
sales costs (packaging, shipping), and communi-
cation, which determine the total cost of a loyalty 
program.
</p>
<p>Compared with the evaluation of costs, the 
calculation of revenues turns out to be far more 
difficult. Two sources of revenues (indirect and 
direct) exist. Assessments of direct revenues (e.g., 
membership fees, sales of special editions) are 
rather straightforward, but indirect revenues, 
which consist of the retention and development of 
existing customer relationships and the acquisi-
tion of new customers, prove very complex and 
difficult to estimate. LPs rewarding customers for 
their engagement behavior and resulting revenues 
are even harder to allocate.
</p>
<p>10.6  Drivers of&nbsp;Loyalty Program 
Effectiveness
</p>
<p>The factors that drive the effectiveness of a loyalty 
program can be structured into three main cate-
gories:
 1. LP design characteristics
 2. Customer characteristics
 3. Firm characteristics
</p>
<p>The configuration and interaction of these drivers 
determine whether an LP achieves its desired 
objective(s).

 Tesco&rsquo;s Green ClubCard Points: 
</p>
<p>Sustainability in&nbsp;Loyalty 
</p>
<p>Programs
</p>
<p>Companies reward their custom-
</p>
<p>ers not only for purchasing but 
</p>
<p>also for not purchasing. What do 
</p>
<p>we mean? Since August 2006, 
</p>
<p>Tesco has granted customers one 
</p>
<p>ClubCard point for every new car-
</p>
<p>rier bag that they do NOT use. This 
</p>
<p>incentive aims to encourage shop-
</p>
<p>pers to reuse their plastic shop-
</p>
<p>ping bags. As a result, more than 
</p>
<p>9.5 million ClubCard customers 
</p>
<p>now reuse their bags. These Green 
</p>
<p>ClubCard points can be spent the 
</p>
<p>same way as any other ClubCard 
</p>
<p>points. Then Tesco began to 
</p>
<p>reward shoppers with points when 
</p>
<p>they recycled their cell phones 
</p>
<p>and printer inkjet cartridges. The 
</p>
<p>launch of recycling machines at 
</p>
<p>Tesco stores, which issued the 
</p>
<p>Green ClubCard points to custom-
</p>
<p>ers who used them, doubled the 
</p>
<p>recycling rates at sites featuring 
</p>
<p>the machines.
</p>
<p>But in March 2009, Tesco stopped 
</p>
<p>issuing Green ClubCard points for 
</p>
<p>recycled plastic and glass items, due 
</p>
<p>to widespread misuse of the system. 
</p>
<p>The grocer realized that customers 
</p>
<p>were cutting up their plastic bottles 
</p>
<p>and inserting the separate pieces in 
</p>
<p>the machines to get more points. Cur-
</p>
<p>rently recycling machines issue points 
</p>
<p>only for aluminum cans. The recycling 
</p>
<p>units, installed at more than 40 stores 
</p>
<p>across England since their launch 
</p>
<p>in 2005, take in more than a million 
</p>
<p>items per week, according to Tesco.
</p>
<p>10.6 &middot; Drivers of&nbsp;Loyalty Program Effectiveness</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>194
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>10.6.1  Loyalty Program Design 
Characteristics
</p>
<p>The LP design characteristics, as we have noted, 
can be classified according to their:
</p>
<p> 5 Reward structure
 5 Participation requirements
 5 Payment function
 5 Sponsorship (existence of partner network, 
</p>
<p>network externalities)
 5 Cost and revenues
</p>
<p>Thus three key questions must be answered to 
determine if a LP is effective:
</p>
<p> 5 From the consumer&rsquo;s perspective, are rewards 
attainable?
</p>
<p> 5 From the consumer&rsquo;s perspective, are rewards 
relevant?
</p>
<p> 5 From the firm&rsquo;s perspective, is the LP design 
aligned with desired goal(s)?
</p>
<p>The first question asks how attractive the payoff is 
to the consumer. If the LP does not provide suffi-
cient value (e.g., timing, rate of rewards), the cus-
tomer cannot justify concentrating purchases, 
and no change in behavior will follow. For exam-
ple, a traveler can redeem miles for a free flight 
after attaining the minimum mileage necessary. 
The level at which the airline sets this minimum 
mileage determines how many less frequent cus-
tomers enroll in the program.
</p>
<p>The second question pertains to whether the 
LP is relevant, regardless of attainability of 
rewards. It thus considers the degree to which an 
accumulation of assets in the program is relevant 
in terms of type of rewards (hard/soft, aspira-
tional). If a consumer cares little for recognition 
and only wants hard rewards, an LP program that 
offers few hard rewards will not be relevant. The 
firm then must decide whether it wants to design 
its program to align with the desired benefits of a 
particular target segment.
</p>
<p>Finally, is the LP&rsquo;s design aligned sufficiently 
with the firm&rsquo;s goals? For example, if an LP offers 
hard rewards and promotions that focus on 
changing short-term behavior, the LP likely will 
have a greater impact on behavioral loyalty and 
less of an influence on attitudinal loyalty. If effec-
tiveness profits are the declared goal, the LP 
instead must be designed to allow the firm to col-
lect as much information as possible about the 
customer.
</p>
<p>10.6.2  Customer Characteristics
</p>
<p>The key customer characteristic relevant to the 
effectiveness of LPs is the skewness of the cus-
tomer value distribution (or value heterogeneity). 
This skewness varies greatly across industries. In 
some industries, the value of individual custom-
ers or accounts is widely similar, whereas in oth-
ers, these values diverge greatly. For example, in 
the gasoline industry, the average driver&rsquo;s monthly 
consumption of gasoline varies only moderately. 
However, in the financial services or telecom 
industries, usage patterns and customer profit-
ability are widely varied.
</p>
<p>How does this skewness determine the effec-
tiveness of LPs? If an LP is designed to achieve 
value alignment, it can succeed best in an envi-
ronment where customers exhibit high value het-
erogeneity. Thus, a value alignment goal is feasible 
in industries such as airlines, hotels, rental cars, 
pharmacies, telecom, and financial services.
</p>
<p>10.6.3  Firm Characteristics
</p>
<p>Factors relevant to LP effectiveness in terms of 
organizational characteristics include the:
</p>
<p> 5 Perishability of a product.
 5 Breadth and depth of the firm offering the 
</p>
<p>product at the store/retail level.
</p>
<p>That is, the success of LPs depends on the charac-
teristics of the product that the firm sells&nbsp; &ndash; and 
particularly whether that product is perishable. 
This point is why LPs are so widespread in the air-
line and hospitality industries. Thus a crucial fea-
ture of hotel LPs is that frequent users can get 
upgrades to &laquo;better&raquo; rooms when those offerings 
are not already taken up by paying customers.
</p>
<p>In terms of the variety of products and brands 
offered at the retail level, an effective LP attains 
more opportunities for efficiency profits with 
greater breadth and depth at the store level, for 
several reasons:
</p>
<p> 5 Buyers are more likely to be able to fulfill 
their needs.
</p>
<p> 5 Buyers encounter more opportunities for 
one-stop shopping (which increases time 
savings).
</p>
<p> 5 Buyers have more opportunities for behav-
ioral loyalty (through more purchase occa-
sions).
</p>
<p> Chapter 10 &middot; Loyalty Programs: Design and&nbsp;Effectiveness</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>195 10
</p>
<p>Thus, LPs generally should be more effective in 
terms of behavioral loyalty when the buying envi-
ronment features greater choice. In addition, 
there should be opportunities for effectiveness 
profits with greater breadth and depth of offerings 
at the store level, because the latitude of purchases 
grants the firm more opportunities for learning 
about customer preferences and cross-selling 
products. . Figure&nbsp;10.3 summarizes how the driv-
ers of LP effectiveness affect its outcomes.
</p>
<p>10.6.4  Achieving a&nbsp;Competitive 
Advantage
</p>
<p>Any firm develops its LP to create competitive 
advantage, or the ability to operate more profitably 
over a sustained period of time. In a 1999 survey 
conducted by McKinsey &amp; Co. with 1200 custom-
ers across 16 product categories, the effect of LPs 
varied depending on the industry category. First, a 
highly frequented category, like grocery stores, is 
more likely to attract members to its LP than less 
frequent purchase categories, such as casual apparel 
stores. Second, a far larger percentage of customers 
admitted to spending more as a result of the LP in 
the grocery stores than in casual apparel stores.
</p>
<p>The evidence we have seen so far indicates that 
LPs that aim to create efficiency profits actually 
provide the smallest basis for competitive advan-
tage. Once every major firm in the market matches 
the first mover, all firms are back to square one, 
except that every firm now has higher costs.
</p>
<p>Companies investing in LPs denote an average 
increase in revenue by 4.4% whereas companies 
having a lower loyalty focus grow by 5.5% in rev-
enue (McKinsey, 2013). Thus, the key challenge 
when pursuing efficiency profits is to keep the 
costs of the LP under control. For the supermar-
ket industry, which operates on razor-thin mar-
gins, this is a huge challenge, and perhaps the 
reason that most grocery LPs include manufac-
turer partners. Without manufacturers&rsquo; funding, 
such as promotions and rebates, a supermarket 
LP could not offer decent or appealing rewards. 
Clearly then, organizations must be ingenious to 
keep LP costs under control. But still, the value of 
participating in an LP must be greater than the 
value of not participating for customers&nbsp;&ndash; other-
wise, there is no reason for customers to be inter-
ested. The emerging trend from single-vendor 
LPs to partnership and mega-coalition LPs may 
contribute to efficiency profits by mutual sharing 
of costs across partners (Breugelmans et&nbsp;al., 2015).

</p>
<p>In contrast, LPs designed to create effective-
ness profits have a good chance of creating com-
petitive advantages. Effectiveness profits probably 
have the greatest appeal to large firms, and the 
continuous developments in IT make information- 
based strategies possible and even easy in some 
cases. Especially mobile platforms and social 
media play an important role for LPs. In 2017, 450 
million mobile payment users are expected gener-
ating US$721 billion (Breugelmans et&nbsp; al., 2015). 
Hence, linking LPs with mobile payment options 
provides the opportunity for two-way communi-
cation and is of one of the major challenges com-
panies face. The seamless connection of LP 
between offline and online channels is a necessity 
to drive LP members overall customer experience. 
However, the implementation seems still chal-
lenging for most companies. The capability of 
learning from customer behavior through con-
tinuous monitoring, analyzing this information 
appropriately, and using newly found insights for 
</p>
<p>designing and deploying LPs remains challenging 
though. Even with widely available, sophisticated 
technology, we still find great differences in firms&rsquo; 
abilities to implement LPs that improve their 
effectiveness profits. The challenge that companies 
face is real-time customer interaction during and 
before purchase (Breugelmans et&nbsp; al., 2015). This 
requires integrated technology platforms with 
new data mining technologies, and higher organi-
zational collaboration that break down organiza-
tional silos (Shiliashki, 2013).
</p>
<p>Finally, the goal of value alignment might 
yield low-to-medium competitive advantages. In 
certain industries (e.g., airline, hotel), value align-
ment is a necessary, standard industry practice. 
Little competitive advantage comes from the pro-
gram itself. However, industries such as financial 
services or telecom services can expect to reap 
competitive advantages if they pursue this goal, 
because execution matters, and firms differ in 
their ability to execute such programs.

 Tesco: From&nbsp;Price Promotions to&nbsp;Marketing 
</p>
<p>Efficiency
</p>
<p>The British supermarket chain Tesco successfully 
</p>
<p>implemented an LP aimed at achieving effectiveness 
</p>
<p>profits. In 1997, Tesco was ranked third among grocery 
</p>
<p>retailers in the United Kingdom, operating on a tradi-
</p>
<p>tional model of promotion- and price-based competi-
</p>
<p>tion. Data about customers&rsquo; purchase behavior were, 
</p>
<p>in principle, available from scanner checkout data, 
</p>
<p>but the data were collected only at the store level, not 
</p>
<p>for individual customers. In February 1995, Tesco had 
</p>
<p>launched the first LP in the British supermarket indus-
</p>
<p>try, initially relying mainly on its incentive aspect. In 
</p>
<p>time Tesco realized that it could capture both market 
</p>
<p>share and share-of-category, though some debate 
</p>
<p>continues about whether these gains came from the 
</p>
<p>expansion of its sales areas, improved service, or its LP.

</p>
<p>Over time, Tesco made more use of its sales data 
</p>
<p>to target benefits and steer customers into new 
</p>
<p>consumption areas. In addition, Tesco established a 
</p>
<p>segmentation scheme to determine which customers 
</p>
<p>it should aim to serve primarily. The LP reflects this 
</p>
<p>segmentation; it offers specific cards to students, fami-
</p>
<p>lies, top customers, and seniors. Within its LP, Tesco 
</p>
<p>also found ways to provide value for special groups, 
</p>
<p>such as families with babies. In Tesco&rsquo;s Baby Club, par-
</p>
<p>ents can meet, obtain information about infant health 
</p>
<p>and food, enroll in courses, and get special rebates on 
</p>
<p>baby-related products. Thus, Tesco tries to align its LP 
</p>
<p>offerings with each member&rsquo;s needs, as opposed to 
</p>
<p>offering general incentives.
</p>
<p>Its knowledge about individual customers&rsquo; and 
</p>
<p>segments&rsquo; preferences comes from its extensive 
</p>
<p>analyses of the data gathered within the LP.&nbsp;In addi-
</p>
<p>tion, Tesco merges customer transaction information 
</p>
<p>gleaned from its website with point-of-sale data 
</p>
<p>(e.g., products, which store, time of the day, basket 
</p>
<p>size). Thus Tesco can customize its product offerings 
</p>
<p>and communications based on specific customer 
</p>
<p>needs, as well as each customer&rsquo;s economic value. 
</p>
<p>Tesco&rsquo;s segmentation is so precise that it sends 
</p>
<p>80 different versions of its promotion mailings to 
</p>
<p>members and publishes four versions of its ClubCard 
</p>
<p>magazine.
</p>
<p>As a result, Tesco&rsquo;s loyalty program now displays 
</p>
<p>few of the incentive scheme characteristics it offered 
</p>
<p>when the idea started. Today, it is all about increasing 
</p>
<p>the efficiency of Tesco&rsquo;s marketing efforts&nbsp;&ndash; which 
</p>
<p>leads to happier consumers and more profitability for 
</p>
<p>the grocer.

<p>10.7  Empirical Evidence on&nbsp;Loyalty 
Program Effectiveness
</p>
<p>More and more empirical evidence in markets 
indicates how successful LPs really are in achiev-
ing their stated goals. But limited empirical evi-
dence details the success or failure of specific 
loyalty programs. It is particularly difficult to get 
unbiased information about the performance of 
firm-specific LPs, because proper metrics rarely 
are in place, and few firms are likely to admit to 
their poor performance. Appendix 1 lists a few 
studies that have examined LP outcomes, each of 
which covers only selected industries. In addition, 
the small number of studies limits our ability to 
make strong empirical generalizations. However, 
we can draw a few conclusions from these pub-
lished studies:
</p>
<p> 5 Published evidence that LPs create attitudinal 
loyalty is rare, though firms might have more 
proprietary information on this point.
</p>
<p> 5 The evidence regarding the relationship 
between loyalty programs and behavioral 
loyalty measures, such as share-of-wallet, is 
mixed. Some studies attest to a positive effect 
of LPs on behavioral loyalty (to varying 
degrees), but other empirical research fails to 
identify such an impact.
</p>
<p> 5 There is very little information on the cost 
efficiency of LPs. Companies may not have 
the knowledge themselves, due to a lack of 
proper accounting or a reluctance to reveal it. 
Individual cases (e.g., Safeway, ASDA) 
suggest the great expense of managing LPs.
</p>
<p> 5 Using LPs as a value alignment tool seems 
viable.
</p>
<p>10.8  Loyalty Programs, Shackle or 
Reward: And&nbsp;to&nbsp;Whom?
</p>
<p>Convincing evidence indicates that loyalty pro-
grams, as they exist today, fall short in terms of 
creating attitudinal loyalty. However, the new LP 
approach to reward customers for their engage-
ment behavior with the brand may be the first step 
towards building up attitudinal loyalty. The name 
LP is a misnomer in that sense. Furthermore, 
programs that focus on incentives, deals, and pro-
motions are often costly for the firm&nbsp; &ndash; unless it 
can offer mainly underutilized, perishable assets, 
</p>
<p>such as unbooked hotel rooms or unrented cars. 
Costly rewards, on top of the razor-thin margins 
in the grocery industry, hardly seem sustain-
able in the medium to long run. Surviving LPs 
thus will be those that save companies money by 
replacing other communication tools, rather than 
just draining their resources. Designed properly, 
an LP can gather data that ultimately improve 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the marketing 
function.
</p>
<p>The LPs that are most likely to provide sus-
tainable competitive advantages are those that 
leverage data obtained from consumers into more 
effective marketing decisions, such that they result 
in true value creation for customers and thus the 
company. Loyalty is likely to follow in these cases 
(Reinartz &amp; Kumar, 2002). Furthermore, firms 
with admirable levels of true customer loyalty, 
such as Harley-Davidson, offer no loyalty pro-
grams. For them, LPs and being loyal do not go 
hand in hand, because true loyalty does not need 
hard incentives; it is based on attitudes.
</p>
<p>10.9  The Seven-Point Checklist 
for&nbsp;Successful LP Design 
and&nbsp;Implementation
</p>
<p>We offer a checklist for developing, designing, 
and implementing a successful LP, with seven key 
points:
</p>
<p> 5 Clearly determine your LP&rsquo;s goals: Is its goal 
compatible with your marketing strategy and 
the positioning of your organization in the 
market?
</p>
<p> 5 Align the design of your LP with the 
characteristics of your market, your 
</p>
<p>customer base, and your firm: Knowing the 
customer base is important, because seg-
ments&rsquo; preferences for LP benefits vary. For 
example, senior citizens may not value the 
long-term accumulation of redeemable points 
as much as immediate price discounts on a 
product.
</p>
<p> 5 Manage the costs of LPs: LPs are expensive, 
so cost management will always be a critical 
component. Consider all the costs involved 
(e.g., opportunity cost of the time of the 
managers involved). Can these costs be 
mitigated by marginal cost rewards or 
contributions from manufacturers?

</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p> 5 Measure the predicted benefits of the LP 
for your organization: Although it is difficult 
to specify these benefits accurately, you 
should attempt to conduct a trade-off analysis 
between the cost and gains of the LP.&nbsp;Also 
consider the time horizon (short versus long 
term).
</p>
<p> 5 Avoid withdrawing an existing LP, which 
can have negative consequences in the 
</p>
<p>form of customer dissatisfaction and 
</p>
<p>defection: Customers do not like it when 
LPs are withdrawn, once they have grown 
accustomed to the benefits. Thus, design 
</p>
<p>faults will not only result in losses but haunt 
you later, in the form of customer dissatis-
faction.
</p>
<p> 5 Design the LP to achieve maximum effec-
tiveness in marketing operations: This goal 
can be achieved by learning customer 
preferences and responding to these prefer-
ences with the offering.
</p>
<p> 5 Ensure that your firm has the necessary 
capabilities to manage its LP effectively: 
These capabilities include data storage, data 
analysis, and empowerment of employees, 
among others.

 Loyalty Program Management at 
</p>
<p>Starwood Hotels
</p>
<p>Starwood is one of the world&rsquo;s larg-
</p>
<p>est hotel and leisure companies. 
</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s services range from 
</p>
<p>exclusive hotels, such as the St. 
</p>
<p>Regis and the Luxury Collection, 
</p>
<p>to five-star Sheraton and Westin 
</p>
<p>hotels, down to the moderately 
</p>
<p>priced Four Points hotel chain. 
</p>
<p>With approximately 1000 proper-
</p>
<p>ties, Starwood functions in most 
</p>
<p>major markets worldwide. The 
</p>
<p>company also operates a customer 
</p>
<p>loyalty program, &laquo;Starwood Pre-
</p>
<p>ferred Guest&raquo; (SPG), which allows 
</p>
<p>customers to accumulate points 
</p>
<p>for staying and spending with 
</p>
<p>Starwood. The program is unique 
</p>
<p>in the industry, in that its points 
</p>
<p>never expire, and Starwood does 
</p>
<p>not impose any so-called black-out 
</p>
<p>dates (i.e., dates when custom-
</p>
<p>ers cannot use their points for 
</p>
<p>redemption).
</p>
<p>Despite these program 
</p>
<p>advantages compared with major 
</p>
<p>competitors, the company is strug-
</p>
<p>gling to exploit the full potential of 
</p>
<p>the program and address several 
</p>
<p>challenges. First, though it col-
</p>
<p>lects information on individual 
</p>
<p>customer behavior (movie watch-
</p>
<p>ing, minibar use, room service 
</p>
<p>use, restaurant use), it is not clear 
</p>
<p>how it can use that information. 
</p>
<p>Some customers like that the 
</p>
<p>company learns about their prefer-
</p>
<p>ences, but many others remain 
</p>
<p>concerned about possible privacy 
</p>
<p>invasions and simply want to be 
</p>
<p>left alone&nbsp;&ndash; or at least have control 
</p>
<p>over the kind of information the 
</p>
<p>company uses. Second, though 
</p>
<p>roughly seven million Starwood 
</p>
<p>customers are members of the 
</p>
<p>loyalty program, another six mil-
</p>
<p>lion customers are not. Thus, the 
</p>
<p>company has very little knowledge 
</p>
<p>about nearly half of its customer 
</p>
<p>base. Third, the company targets 
</p>
<p>existing program members with 
</p>
<p>customized offerings and commu-
</p>
<p>nications, but it yet has to figure 
</p>
<p>out how much customers are will-
</p>
<p>ing to be bothered by such com-
</p>
<p>munications. Although Starwood 
</p>
<p>wants to maximize its cross-selling 
</p>
<p>and up-selling opportunities, it 
</p>
<p>recognizes that some customers 
</p>
<p>will react negatively if they get too 
</p>
<p>many offerings.
</p>
<p> ? Questions on Minicase 10.1
 1. How can a large company such as Star-
</p>
<p>wood exploit customer data while still safe-
</p>
<p>guarding and respecting customer privacy?
</p>
<p> 2. What should Starwood do to attract 
</p>
<p> loyalty program nonusers into the 
</p>
<p> program or find out more about the 
</p>
<p>behavior and preferences of this large 
</p>
<p>group?
</p>
<p> 3. How far should Starwood push its direct 
</p>
<p>offerings to its program members? How

<p>can it discover the boundary?
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>The satisfaction-loyalty-profit chain (SPC) is 
</p>
<p>based on the idea that improving product and 
</p>
<p>service attributes leads to better customer 
</p>
<p>satisfaction, which then produces greater cus-
</p>
<p>tomer loyalty, which means increased profit-
</p>
<p>ability. Although empirical studies concentrate 
</p>
<p>on aggregate, firm-level results, this chain 
</p>
<p>needs to be implemented at a disaggregated 
</p>
<p>or individual level.
</p>
<p>Improving customer satisfaction comes at 
</p>
<p>a cost, and it may not even deliver the antici-

</p>
<p>pated business results. There is an optimum 
</p>
<p>satisfaction level for any firm, beyond which 
</p>
<p>increasing satisfaction does not pay off. To 
</p>
<p>find this level, firms must conduct longitudi-
</p>
<p>nal satisfaction studies and find changes in 
</p>
<p>customer satisfaction over time, linking them 
</p>
<p>to improvements in their offering. By focusing 
</p>
<p>on customer retention, managers can move 
</p>
<p>closer to the ultimate dependent variable: 
</p>
<p>profits. Graphical representations of data 
</p>
<p>reveal that the link between satisfaction and 
</p>
<p>retention is asymmetric (i.e., dissatisfaction 
</p>
<p>has a greater impact on retention than does 
</p>
<p>satisfaction). It is also nonlinear, such that the 
</p>
<p>impact of satisfaction on retention is greater 
</p>
<p>at the extremes, with a flat part in the middle 
</p>
<p>of the curve called the zone of indifference.
</p>
<p>According to a hypothesis proposed 
</p>
<p>by Frederick F.&nbsp;Reichheld (2000), long-term 
</p>
<p>customers spend more per period over time, 
</p>
<p>cost less to serve, have greater propensity to 
</p>
<p>generate word-of- mouth, and pay a premium 
</p>
<p>price compared with that paid by short-term 
</p>
<p>customers. However, Reinartz &amp; Kumar (2002) 
</p>
<p>have tested this hypothesis and demonstrated 
</p>
<p>that across firms, a segment of customers is 
</p>
<p>loyal but not very profitable (because they 
</p>
<p>use up excessive firm resources), and another 
</p>
<p>segment generates very high profits despite 
</p>
<p>its short tenure with the firm. Considering 
</p>
<p>that these short-term customers can be very 
</p>
<p>profitable, loyalty cannot be the only path to 
</p>
<p>profitability. This finding points to the impor-
</p>
<p>tance of remembering the ultimate end of the 
</p>
<p>satisfaction&ndash;profit chain: Customer profits ulti-
</p>
<p>mately are required to demonstrate the value 
</p>
<p>of good marketing decisions.
</p>
<p>The findings also suggest the need to 
</p>
<p>understand different forms of loyalty. Behav-
</p>
<p>ioral loyalty refers to observed actions by 
</p>
<p>customers; attitudinal loyalty entails their per-
</p>
<p>ceptions and attitudes. Customers who are not 
</p>
<p>attitudinally loyal are likely to end the relation-
</p>
<p>ship at the earliest available opportunity, but a 
</p>
<p>loyalty program aims to keep them by offering 
</p>
<p>rewards to customers for their repeat pur-
</p>
<p>chasing. In exchange for concentrating their 
</p>
<p>purchases with the focal firm, customers can 
</p>
<p>accumulate assets (e.g., points) and exchange 
</p>
<p>them for products or services. The success 
</p>
<p>or failure of a loyalty program, whether 
</p>
<p>contractual or incentive- based, depends on 
</p>
<p>the profitability gained from the customers. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, LPs offer an important CRM tool 
</p>
<p>that marketers can use to identify, award, and 
</p>
<p>retain profitable customers.
</p>
<p>The key objectives of introducing LPs 
</p>
<p>include building true (attitudinal and behav-
</p>
<p>ioral) loyalty, efficiency profits, effectiveness 
</p>
<p>profits, and value alignment. True loyalty is 
</p>
<p>a function of the true value provided to the 
</p>
<p>customers. Efficiency profits, which are net 
</p>
<p>of LP cost, are the profits that result from a 
</p>
<p>change in customers&rsquo; buying behavior due 
</p>
<p>to the LP.&nbsp;The most widely used measure of 
</p>
<p>behavioral loyalty is share of category require-
</p>
<p>ments or share of wallet, though LPs might 
</p>
<p>not change behavior as much as they reinforce 
</p>
<p>existing behavior&nbsp;&ndash; at a much higher cost to 
</p>
<p>the firm. Effectiveness profits are the medium- 
</p>
<p>to long-term consequences realized through 
</p>
<p>better learning about customer preferences, 
</p>
<p>which are more likely to generate sustain-
</p>
<p>able competitive advantages and produce 
</p>
<p>higher profits in the long run. Value alignment 
</p>
<p>aims to match the cost to serve a particular 
</p>
<p>customer with the value he or she provides 
</p>
<p>the firm. It becomes particularly critical when 
</p>
<p>there is great heterogeneity in customers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>value and costs to serve. Across these goals, 
</p>
<p>LPs may not be truly effective in helping firms 
</p>
<p>engender greater customer loyalty and higher 
</p>
<p>profits, considering the costs and special chal-
</p>
<p>lenges posed by managing an LP.&nbsp;Most com-
</p>
<p>panies need to revisit their business model, 
</p>
<p>not only to reflect on the impact of LPs on 
</p>
<p>their bottom line but also to determine how 
</p>
<p>customer service initiatives add value to future 
</p>
<p>revenue streams.
</p>
<p>From customers&rsquo; perspective, rewards are 
</p>
<p>the key design benefit of LPs. Hard rewards 
</p>
<p>offer price reductions, promotions, free 
</p>
<p>products, or preferred treatment, whereas 
</p>
<p>soft rewards provide psychological recogni-
</p>
<p>tion. Regardless of their type, rewards can be 
</p>
<p>directly or indirectly linked to the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>product offering. Consumers also prefer 
</p>
<p>hedonic goods over utilitarian goods when 
</p>
<p>receiving a gift, so companies work to dif-
</p>
<p>ferentiate their LPs on the basis of their inspi-
</p>

</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>rational or hedonic value. The rate of rewards 
</p>
<p>(i.e., ratio of reward value to transaction 
</p>
<p>volume) is a key driver of LP enrollment and 
</p>
<p>use; it depends on the chosen asset accumula-
</p>
<p>tion response function. For example, a tiered 
</p>
<p>structure offers different levels of rewards and 
</p>
<p>privileges to customers in differing tiers. The 
</p>
<p>timing of reward redemption instead is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the minimum redemption rules, 
</p>
<p>type of reward, and reward rate.
</p>
<p>Sponsorship refers to supply-side features, 
</p>
<p>such as the introduction of partners&nbsp;&ndash; a grow-
</p>
<p>ing trend in LP designs. If LP members can 
</p>
<p>accumulate assets at organizations associated 
</p>
<p>with the focal firm, the design also must con-
</p>
<p>sider the degree of cross- sector partnerships. 
</p>
<p>Do customers want to accumulate assets 
</p>
<p>within the same sector, or across divergent, 
</p>
<p>different sectors?
</p>
<p>These design factors drive the effective-
</p>
<p>ness of an LP, together with customer and firm 
</p>
<p>characteristics. The configuration and interac-
</p>
<p>tion of these drivers determine whether an LP 
</p>
<p>achieves its desired objective(s). This effective-
</p>
<p>ness thus depends on the attractiveness of 
</p>
<p>the LP from the consumer&rsquo;s perspective, the 
</p>
<p>degree to which asset accumulation is relevant 
</p>
<p>to the consumer, and whether the LP design 
</p>
<p>aligns with the firm&rsquo;s goals. It also reflects the 
</p>
<p>skewness of customer value distribution (value 
</p>
<p>heterogeneity). Finally, on the organizational 
</p>
<p>level, the perishability of the product and the 
</p>
<p>breadth and depth of the firm offering influ-
</p>
<p>ence LP effectiveness. When a firm cannot 
</p>
<p>capitalize on the perishability of its products, 
</p>
<p>the reward expenses come directly from its 
</p>
<p>bottom line, which reduces the economic 
</p>
<p>viability of an LP.&nbsp;Greater breadth and depth of 
</p>
<p>offerings at the store level means the latitude 
</p>
<p>of purchases allows the firm more opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties for learning customer preferences and 
</p>
<p>cross-selling products.
</p>
<p>No published evidence shows that LPs 
</p>
<p>create attitudinal loyalty, though there is evi-
</p>
<p>dence of an impact of LPs on behavioral loy-
</p>
<p>alty. Moreover, we find very little information 
</p>
<p>about the cost efficiency of LPs, though using 
</p>
<p>LPs as a value alignment tool seems viable.
</p>
<p>A firm develops an LP to create a competitive 
</p>
<p>advantage and operate more profitably over a 
</p>
<p>sustained period of time. Thus a key challenge is 
</p>
<p>keeping the costs of managing the LP under 
</p>
<p>control. The LPs designed to create effectiveness 
</p>
<p>profits have the highest chance of creating 
</p>
<p>competitive advantage; the effectiveness profit 
</p>
<p>goal thus has great appeal for most (large) firms. 
</p>
<p>Value alignment instead should yield low to 
</p>
<p>medium competitive advantages. It may be 
</p>
<p>necessary in certain industries such as the airline 
</p>
<p>or hotel industry, where value alignment has 
</p>
<p>become a standard industry practice. However, 
</p>
<p>industries such as financial services or telecom 
</p>
<p>can expect to reap competitive advantage when 
</p>
<p>pursuing this goal since execution matters and 
</p>
<p>firms differ in their ability to execute the 
</p>
<p>programs well.
</p>
<p>Loyalty programs, as they exist today, appear 
</p>
<p>to be falling short in terms of creating attitudinal 
</p>
<p>loyalty. Instead, perhaps LP managers need to 
</p>
<p>emphasize its promise as a method to gather 
</p>
<p>data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of the marketing function.
</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. Loyalty programs, in order to stay attrac-
</p>
<p>tive in the future, need to be joyful, 
</p>
<p>beneficiary and easy-to-use, while offer-
</p>
<p>ing relevant, personalized and instant 
</p>
<p>rewards (CaptainUp, 2016). The next 
</p>
<p>generation of loyalty programs aims at 
</p>
<p>integrating gamification elements into 
</p>
<p>the reward structure. Loyalty programs 
</p>
<p>need to move away from static rewards 
</p>
<p>towards incentives that are smarter and 
</p>
<p>dynamic. Topaz, Ireland&rsquo;s largest fuel 
</p>
<p>provider, introduces gamification to their 
</p>
<p>loyalty program, called &laquo;Play or Park&raquo;. The 
</p>
<p>loyalty game, allows customers to col-
</p>
<p>lect points for their refuel or purchase at 
</p>
<p>Topaz stores. Customers can &laquo;play&raquo; a spe-
</p>
<p>cific amount of points to win a fantastic 
</p>
<p>experience of a lifetime, which changes 
</p>
<p>every month. Or customers can &laquo;park&raquo; 
</p>
<p>their LP points to wait for a better chance 
</p>
<p>next months. Every time playing custom-
</p>
<p>ers are guaranteed getting a free Topaz

<p>ensure customer engagement in reward 
</p>
<p>redemption, sophisticated interaction 
</p>
<p>across LPs is required. Amongst other 
</p>
<p>suppliers, IBM and Loyyal are building a 
</p>
<p>loyalty network in the internet by the use 
</p>
<p>of blockchain providing high transaction 
</p>
<p>standard (Harvard Business Review, 2015). 
</p>
<p>The underlying idea of a blockchain-
</p>
<p>based network is to trade rewards across 
</p>
<p>programs, vendors, and industries and 
</p>
<p>thus, should serve three major features: 
</p>
<p>(1) Providing loyalty network platform, 
</p>
<p>(2) enabling rewards applications (3) 
</p>
<p>transforming the value of rewards into 
</p>
<p>loyalty tokens. A loyalty network platform 
</p>
<p>facilitates the conversion and exchange 
</p>
<p>of loyalty points across industries and 
</p>
<p>LP network participants. The application 
</p>
<p>of reward is based on a digital loyalty 
</p>
<p>reward wallet, which stores value for the 
</p>
<p>collected LP points in the form of loyalty 
</p>
<p>tokens (digital currency), which assure 
</p>
<p>loyalty transaction either in form of issu-
</p>
<p>ance, redemption, or exchange across the 
</p>
<p>network. A blockchain-based network 
</p>
<p>creates value for customer and companies 
</p>
<p>in multiple ways, i.e. increasing customer 
</p>
<p>experience, facilitating multiple reward 
</p>
<p>membership management by a single wal-
</p>
<p>let platform and providing more insights 
</p>
<p>in consumer behavior (Deloitte, 2016).
</p>
<p> ? Exercise Questions
 1. Explain the difference between behav-
</p>
<p>ioral and attitudinal loyalty. Provide an 
</p>
<p>example of each.
</p>
<p> 2. What are the key objectives of loyalty 
</p>
<p>programs? Which of these objectives 
</p>
<p>provide the strongest competitive advan-
</p>
<p>tages?
</p>
<p> 3. You are a consultant to a credit card orga-
</p>
<p>nization that wants to establish a loyalty 
</p>
<p>program. The CEO has just read about 
</p>
<p>how most loyalty programs result in 
</p>
<p>money-losing propositions. How do you 
</p>
<p>alleviate the CEO&rsquo;s concerns?
</p>
<p> 4. Do companies profit by introducing 
</p>
<p>loyalty programs? Is the success of a com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s loyalty program dependent on its 
</p>
<p>industry category?
</p>
<p> 5. How can you measure loyalty? How does 
</p>
<p>loyalty relate to the profitability of a com-
</p>
<p>pany?
</p>
<p> 6. Would low-ticket items (coffee, candy, 
</p>
<p>sodas) benefit from loyalty programs? 
</p>
<p>What kind of incentives might work 
</p>
<p>best?
</p>
<p> 7. Design a loyalty program for your 
</p>
<p>neighborhood gas station. Describe the 
</p>
<p>incentives. Determine the cost structure. 
</p>
<p>Set benchmarks, and evaluate the profit-
</p>
<p>ability of the program across possible 
</p>
<p>scenarios.
</p>
<p> 8. What are the ethical issues that surround 
</p>
<p>loyalty programs? Should the gaming 
</p>
<p>industry be allowed to use loyalty instru-
</p>
<p>ments for example?

 The &laquo;All Adidas&raquo; Global Market-
</p>
<p>ing Campaign
</p>
<p>In March of 2011, Adidas, the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s second largest sporting 
</p>
<p>goods brand, launched its largest 
</p>
<p>marketing campaign ever entitled 
</p>
<p>&laquo;All Adidas&raquo;. The main focus of the 
</p>
<p>campaign was to increase 
</p>
<p>awareness of Adidas&rsquo; entrenchment 
</p>
<p>into diverse fields of interest, such 
</p>
<p>as culture, sports and music.
</p>
<p> Purpose
</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to 
</p>
<p>unite each of Adidas&rsquo; three 
</p>
<p>distinctive sub-brands (Adidas 
</p>
<p>Sport Performance, Adidas 
</p>
<p>Originals and Adidas Sports Style) 
</p>
<p>under the umbrella brand Adidas, 
</p>
<p>in an effort to project a holistic and 
</p>
<p>global Adidas brand. The campaign 
</p>
<p>features the tagline &laquo;Adidas is All 
</p>
<p>In&raquo; which further solidifies their 
</p>
<p>goals of unification of brands.
</p>
<p> Brand Ambassadors
</p>
<p>Adidas has enlisted several well 
</p>
<p>known public figures from the 
</p>
<p>sports, music, and fashion arenas to 
</p>
<p>become ambassadors for the &laquo;All 
</p>
<p>Adidas&raquo; campaign, in an effort to 
</p>
<p>merge cultural, sports and lifestyle 
</p>
<p>sub-brands.
</p>
<p> Channels
</p>
<p>The primary medium being used to 
</p>
<p>deliver &laquo;All Adidas&raquo; campaign 
</p>
<p>messages is television and internet. 
</p>
<p>Adidas enlisted the Sid Lee 
</p>
<p>advertising agency to manage the 
</p>
<p>campaign. The Sid Lee agency 
</p>
<p>created 30- and 60-s commercials 
</p>
<p>to be shown on TV and cinema as 
</p>
<p>well as an extended 2-min version 
</p>
<p>available online.
</p>

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>One important goal of customer value 
</p>
<p>management is to profile the existing 
</p>
<p>customers on the basis of their value and use 
</p>
<p>this information to identify and acquire 
</p>
<p>prospects matching this profile. A marketing 
</p>
<p>campaign can be thought of as a series of 
</p>
<p>activities used to market/promote a new or 
</p>
<p>existing product/service using online and 
</p>
<p>offline marketing channels. Marketing 
</p>
<p>campaigns can be used by firms to:
</p>
<p> 5 Identify prospective customers.
 5 Acquire customers.
 5 Retain and reward existing customers.
</p>
<p>For many prospects, the campaign is the 
</p>
<p>first opportunity for engaging in a dialogue 
</p>
<p>with the firm. A dialogue between the firm 
</p>
<p>and customers can effectively change cus-
</p>
<p>tomers&rsquo; attitudes and behavior towards the 
</p>
<p>firm. Hence it is very important for the firms 
</p>
<p>to develop and plan with a specific end result 
</p>
<p>in mind, and execute these campaigns effec-
</p>
<p>tively and analyze the campaign results care-
</p>
<p>fully. There may be many desired results for a 
</p>
<p>marketing campaign but they all begin with 
</p>
<p>increasing the awareness of a firm, its prod-
</p>
<p>ucts and/or its services. Marketing campaigns 
</p>
<p>may be developed and executed within the 
</p>
<p>company or in conjunction with a third party 
</p>
<p>such as an advertising agency.
</p>
<p>A marketing campaign may be executed 
</p>
<p>through one or more channels of customer 
</p>
<p>interaction: phone, direct mail, the Web, wire-
</p>
<p>less devices, email, direct sales and partner 
</p>
<p>network. The success of a campaign involves 
</p>
<p>reaching out to the right customer with the 
</p>
<p>right offer at the right time and through 
</p>
<p>the right channel. The campaign acts as 
</p>
<p>a rich source of information and once the 
</p>
<p>campaign is completed, both the marketing 
</p>
<p>manager and sales manager should evaluate 
</p>
<p>the effectiveness of the campaign and use 
</p>
<p>what they have learned for future planning. 
</p>
<p>An example of a recent marketing campaign 
</p>
<p>is provided in the following example.

</p>
<p>In this chapter, we explain the different phases of 
Campaign Management processes such as Cam-
paign Planning and development, Campaign execu-
tion, and Analysis and Control. The sub- phases in 
each of these main phases are shown in . Fig.&nbsp;11.1. In 
the discussion about Campaign planning and Devel-
opment phase, we include issues such as identifying 
customers, developing communication strategies 
and media mix, developing an offer, and testing. The 
campaign execution phase involves actual imple-
mentation and subsequent fine tuning of the cam-
paign. The last phase consists of measurement of 
campaign results, profile and response analysis.
</p>
<p>11.1  Campaign Management
</p>
<p>A campaign is a series of interconnected pro-
motional efforts designed to achieve precise 
marketing goals. Managing a campaign encom-
passes planning, developing, executing, and 
finally analyzing the campaign results. A cam-
paign is composed of one or more promotions, 
</p>
<p>each of which is an initiative or a device 
designed to attract the customers&rsquo; interest. It 
can be aimed at prospects or existing customers 
and usually is undertaken within a defined 
timeframe (such as a season, and generally not 
exceeding a calendar year). Marketers could use 
the customer value metric as a means to profit-
ably target campaigns.
</p>
<p>As a general rule, a successful campaign man-
agement process comprises four connected stages:
</p>
<p> 5 Planning: Strategic process by which 
decisions are taken. The purposes and 
objectives of the campaign should be defined 
and rationalized at this stage.
</p>
<p> 5 Development: Tactical process that takes 
care of creating the offer, choosing the 
support and design, choosing the media, and 
selecting the customer names.
</p>
<p> 5 Execution: Operational process of running 
the campaign in the media chosen and 
controlling all related aspects.
</p>
<p> 5 Analysis: Evaluation process of the campaign 
results in light of the original, objectives.

</p>
<p>In practice, these stages do not have well- defined 
boundaries between them and are performed at 
the same time. Very often, planning and develop-
ment go together. In the next few sections, we 
will take a closer look at how each stage is man-
aged.
</p>
<p>11.2  Campaign Planning 
and&nbsp;Development
</p>
<p>At the campaign planning stage, marketers make 
strategic decisions that help define the overall 
objectives of the campaign, the best communica-
tion message, and the best target audience. Once 
these strategic issues are defined, the development 
phase starts.
</p>
<p>11.2.1  Setting Objectives 
and&nbsp;Strategies
</p>
<p>Campaigns have a central role in annual market-
ing plans, so campaign objectives should be in 
line with overall marketing and corporate objec-
tives. These objectives are often from the four fol-
lowing categories: market penetration (increase 
usage or market share); market extension (find 
new user groups or enter new segments); product 
development (new products or services); and 
diversification (new markets and products, new 
strategies).
</p>
<p>The different marketing strategies already in 
place should be examined. Questions asked 
should pertain to the product strategy (What is 
the product mix?), the pricing strategy (Is price 
important for market positioning?), the distribu-
tion strategy (Which channels does the firm 
use?), and the promotion strategy (Is the creative 
strategy consistent with product positioning?).
</p>
<p>When defining the campaign strategy, mar-
keters should be able to answer the following 
additional questions:
 1. Who do you want to target? (i.e., Who are the 
</p>
<p>targeted customer segments?)
 2. Where should you target? (i.e., What are the 
</p>
<p>channels, and points of contact?)
 3. How do you get to them? (i.e., What is the 
</p>
<p>communication strategy and offer?)
 4. When is the best time? (i.e., When should 
</p>
<p>you schedule the campaign?)
</p>
<p> Who Do You&nbsp;Want to&nbsp;Target?
</p>
<p>To answer this question, the company has three 
options: focusing on existing customers (reten-
tion strategy), concentrating on getting new cus-
tomers (acquisition strategy), or targeting existing 
and new customers at the same time (mixed strat-
egy between retention-acquisition).
</p>
<p>When pursuing a customer retention strategy, 
ideally the company should target its most profit-
able customers via LTV (lifetime value) and RFM 
(recency, frequency, and monetary) analysis. 
Here are some approaches to target these seg-
ments:
</p>
<p> 5 Develop loyalty from the existing customers, 
via a strong relationship or superior quality 
or service (e.g., loyalty programs, one-to-one 
relationships).
</p>
<p> 5 Develop tailor-made products adequate for 
the needs of the existing customer profiles.
</p>
<p> 5 Sell additional products to existing customers 
also known as cross-selling (e.g., selling an 
insurance policy to an existing bank cus-
tomer).
</p>
<p> 5 Sell a superior product (with more features or 
additional services) to customers who already 
use similar products, also called up-selling 
(e.g., selling a gold credit card to a regular 
credit-card holder).
</p>
<p> 5 Merchandise different brands from different 
categories to the same customer, also known 
as cross-merchandising (e.g., sell the gold 
credit card with the best interest rate).
</p>
<p>If the company pursues a customer acquisition 
strategy, it has two options: If it wants to sell the 
same product to new customers, it should target 
prospects based on the profile and behavior model 
of existing customers; if it wants to offer different 
products to new customers, it should develop new 
markets.
</p>
<p> Where Should You&nbsp;Target?
</p>
<p>The company either chooses to act in the markets 
it already knows (pursue market penetration or 
extension) or it can choose new markets (market 
diversification or new product development). It 
may choose a multichannel strategy (selling the 
same product in multiple channels like internet, 
store, phone, etc.) or a single-channel strategy 
(selling products in a single channel, like in a 
store).

</p>
<p> How Do You&nbsp;Get to&nbsp;Them?
</p>
<p>Getting your customers&rsquo; and prospects&rsquo; attention 
will be one of the goals of the company&rsquo;s communi-
cation strategy. Choosing the most effective media 
(for retention and acquisition strategies) will allow 
the company to efficiently reach its target seg-
ments. The offer proposition will also have a pre-
dominant role. What kind of incentives- coupons, 
gifts, loyalty schemes, and so on-suit a particular 
customer group? The company should develop the 
offer according to customer preferences, with the 
campaign budget being a constraint.
</p>
<p> When Is the&nbsp;Best Time?
</p>
<p>When preparing a campaign, marketers should be 
aware that some seasons are better to promote 
products and services than others. For example, 
new computer games are released and cam-
paigned during November and December just 
before Christmas season. Retail banks may cam-
paign for credit cards or personal loans in January, 
because people are expected to be short on money 
due to Christmas and New Year expenses. In 
</p>
<p>addition to these examples, the product itself can 
be seasonable or it can have a short life cycle. For 
example, sunscreen lotions are sold during sum-
mer. Similarly, outdoor sports equipment is 
advertised before summer time. . Figure&nbsp; 11.2 
highlights the core market and product decisions 
for customer retention and/or customer acquisi-
tion strategies.
</p>
<p>11.2.2  Identifying Customer 
Segments
</p>
<p>Once the campaign objectives are established, 
the next step involves identifying the customer 
segments the campaign will target. Customer 
segments are homogenous groups of individuals 
that have similar tastes, wants, and needs with 
respect to the company&rsquo;s products or services, 
Lifetime segmentation and profiling should 
guide in targeting the specific customer seg-
ments most likely to respond to the company&rsquo;s 
offer.
</p>
<p>       . Fig.&nbsp;11.2 Customer retention and acquisition strategies

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>212
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>Customer segments can be identified in two 
ways: purchase behavior and profile data. 
Purchase behavior is recorded in the CRM data-
base and will allow the marketer to segment by 
product need and by LTV.&nbsp;Profile data will relate 
the individual customer to his or her response to 
past campaigns, allowing the implementation of 
an ROI-driven marketing campaign, Profile data 
also identify tastes, needs, and preferences of cus-
tomers, and therefore can be used to target new 
customers accurately.
</p>
<p>Obtaining a successful campaign involves a 
careful choice of customer segments. Marketers 
can focus on a strategy-mix of three types of cus-
tomer groups: the existing customers, the pros-
pects, and the defectors. The existing customers are 
an important source of information. They provide 
information about their purchasing behavior, atti-
tudes, and tastes. Their interests, motivations, 
multi-channel usage, and profile can be used to 
target prospect clients who exhibit a similar profile. 
The CRM database should record all the informa-
tion from transactions, surveys, focus groups, 
complaint records, loyalty card data, web traffic 
analysis, and other external sources. Identifying 
profiles of existing customers will help identify 
new customers on the market. Defecting custom-
ers also provide enlightening information. When 
defecting, these clients have a reason to do so. 
Customers can be dissatisfied with the product 
itself, with the quality of the service offered, or with 
the company channel management. Paying atten-
tion to these customers will help the company 
learn from past errors, This information is very 
useful because it allows product improvement and 
development; better targeting, and better service, If 
the company listens to what its customers are say-
ing, then it will be able to better satisfy their needs 
and consequently be profitable in the long run.
</p>
<p> How Are Customer Segments 
Targeted?
</p>
<p>Segmentation, as obvious as it sounds, is in many 
cases not straightforward. The CRM database 
plays a central role in this step of the campaign 
process. Effective use of the information on cus-
tomer behaviors and profiles, channel prefer-
ences, and brand awareness will allow the accurate 
definition of the target segments. Of course, the 
segmentation can only be as good as the quality of 
the underlying data.
</p>
<p>If the campaign is aimed at retaining existing 
clients, the firm&rsquo;s CRM system is central to analyz-
ing the recorded purchase behaviors and profiles 
which will help the marketer adjust the offer to 
meet the unsatisfied needs of customers. Several 
analyses could be performed at this stage (e.g., 
lifetime value segmentation, profiling and RPM).
</p>
<p>11.2.3  Developing the 
Communication Strategy
</p>
<p>Marketing communications (marcom) are tar-
geted interactions between the company and its 
customers and prospects, using one or more 
media, such as direct mail, newspapers and maga-
zines, television, radio, telemarketing, and the 
Internet. A marcom campaign may use a single 
approach (e.g., direct mail) or it can combine sev-
eral approaches (e.g., direct mail with advertising 
in television, radio, and newspapers).
</p>
<p>When defining the communication strategy, 
the company identifies and defines to whom the 
campaign is directed (the target audience), what 
the campaign message is (content), and which are 
the best contact channels or media to deliver the 
content. The marketing team frequently develops 
the marketing communication plan, but a mar-
keting communication agency (such as an adver-
tising agency or a direct marketing agency) may 
help in its preparation. If the company chooses to 
outsource, it hires an agency to execute the mar-
keting communications plan.
</p>
<p>The campaign communication strategy will be 
more effective if planned in an integrated manner. 
Integrated marketing communications (IMC) is a 
process that involves the management and orga-
nization of the marketing communication tools 
(media, messages, promotions, and channels) in a 
way that delivers a dear and consistent message 
about the company and about the product. The 
CRM database system allows the effective use of 
IMC because it stores information about cus-
tomer and prospect preferences and allows the 
firm to focus marketing activities toward specific 
targets.
</p>
<p>Marketing communication activities can vary 
from very small discrete pieces of promotion 
(such as a mailer), to the development of a larger 
campaign, which involves many promotional 
tools (direct mail, press inserts, TV spots), and to

</p>
<p>the coordination of multiple campaigns to achieve 
a global objective (increasing the level of cross- 
selling, customer retention, etc.) It is important to 
build one or more interlinked databases of each 
medium as part of the CRM database.
</p>
<p> Which Communication Strategy?
</p>
<p>Generally, marketers use hybrid combinations of 
strategies when developing the communication 
strategy. Some of these strategic approaches are 
enumerated in . Table&nbsp;11.1.
</p>
<p>       . Table&nbsp;11.1 Communication strategy
</p>
<p>Strategy Description
</p>
<p>Generic strategy No distinction is made between brands. The emphasis is placed upon category need 
</p>
<p>rather than brand awareness (example: Promotions for a product category)
</p>
<p>Pre-emptive strategy A generic claim is made about the superiority of the company&rsquo;s brand (example: 
</p>
<p>promoting a product that is protected by a patent)
</p>
<p>Unique selling 
</p>
<p>proposition (USP)
</p>
<p>It emphasizes the superiority of the brand based on a unique feature or benefit. (e.g. 
</p>
<p>promoting a product with a new feature)
</p>
<p>Brand image 
</p>
<p>strategy
</p>
<p>It relies on the development of mental or psychological associations through the use of 
</p>
<p>signs, symbols and images
</p>
<p>Resonance Strategy It attempts to recall events or feelings by evoking meanings, experiences, thoughts or 
</p>
<p>aspirations that are relevant to target audiences
</p>
<p>Affective or 
</p>
<p>emotional strategy
</p>
<p>It attempts to invoke involvement and emotion, with a powerful message
</p>
<p>Informational 
</p>
<p>strategy
</p>
<p>It is based on the view that an important element of the creative theme is to convey 
</p>
<p>information (example, an educational campaign)
</p>
<p>Push Promotional 
</p>
<p>strategy
</p>
<p>To focus a promotional effort in manufacturers of goods and services to encourage the 
</p>
<p>trade channel members to stock, promote and sell its products
</p>
<p>Pull promotional 
</p>
<p>strategy
</p>
<p>To focus a promotional effort in encouraging end customers and consumers to demand 
</p>
<p>goods and services
</p>
<p>Positioning 
</p>
<p>strategies
</p>
<p>Positioning by attribute, 
</p>
<p>product characteristic, or 
</p>
<p>consumer benefit
</p>
<p>The brand is perceived to be better than others in a 
</p>
<p>particular way. Marketing communications emphasize 
</p>
<p>these features
</p>
<p>Positioning by price/
</p>
<p>quality
</p>
<p>Positioning can be sought in high price/high quality, 
</p>
<p>prestige positions, low price/acceptable quality positions
</p>
<p>Positioning by use or 
</p>
<p>application
</p>
<p>Segmentation and targeting can be carried out based on 
</p>
<p>usage occasion. (Example: fast- food is for people who have 
</p>
<p>little time to eat)
</p>
<p>Positioning by product 
</p>
<p>user
</p>
<p>It focuses on the requirements of target customers and 
</p>
<p>consumers
</p>
<p>Positioning with respect 
</p>
<p>to product category
</p>
<p>Rather than competing with another brand, a brand or 
</p>
<p>product category might be positioned against another 
</p>
<p>product category. The competitive focus is placed on 
</p>
<p>substitutes
</p>
<p>Positioning against a 
</p>
<p>competitor
</p>
<p>Brands are promoted with a full understanding of their relative 
</p>
<p>competitive position in the minds of the target audience
</p>
<p>Cultural positioning Positioning by cultural reference, where the brand is clearly 
</p>
<p>associated with a particular culture, country, religion, 
</p>
<p>ethnic group or sense of heritage or tradition

</p>
<p>Prioritizing the target segments that provide a 
higher potential yield is one objective of the mar-
com strategy. Targeting the customers in an effec-
tive way should maximize the marketing 
communications ROI.&nbsp;Naturally, some media are 
more effective at targeting certain groups of cus-
tomers than others. The challenge is to choose 
those media that are both effective in achieving 
the campaign objective and cost-efficient.
</p>
<p>The choice of media depends in part on 
whether existing customers or prospects are 
 targeted. If customers are nonaddressable, 
broadcast media are used for acquisition. If the 
prospects addresses are known, direct-to-cus-
tomer media may be more effective. In the case 
of retention, the firm may spend more on per-
sonalized contacts (salesperson, telephone) with 
high-value clients. For low-value relationships, 
companies might opt for lower-cost contact 
channels such as the internet or mail. In practice, 
customer acquisition and retention strategies are 
often mixed. If a company is launching a new 
product directed at existing customers and new 
customers, it will use both kinds of media. A 
</p>
<p>brief description of these media is available in 
. Table&nbsp; 11.2. The effect of using media-mix in 
acquisition and retention strategies can be seen 
in the following example.
</p>
<p>Marketing Media Tools Most of the media 
referred in the earlier sections are known as direct 
marketing media tools. . Table&nbsp;11.3 gives a brief 
description of what they are and how they are 
used, together with their advantages and disad-
vantages. It provides a snapshot of different adver-
tising mediums and their principal characteristics.
</p>
<p>11.2.4  Developing the&nbsp;Offer
</p>
<p>Developing the offer consists of offering the cus-
tomer some kind of incentive which will induce 
him to buy or to ask the company for more infor-
mation. This offer may range from a free product 
sample (e.g., getting a free sample of a shampoo in 
the mail) to price-related incentives (e.g., buying 
two CDs for the price of one), or an item provid-
ing information on the firm (e.g., a free promo-
tion video about the firm&rsquo;s new products).

</p>
<p>In his 2008 campaign, president&ndash;
</p>
<p>elect Barack Obama was able to 
</p>
<p>use the power of the internet to 
</p>
<p>amass a database of millions of 
</p>
<p>potential voters and supporters. 
</p>
<p>Throughout the campaign process 
</p>
<p>the Obama team collected over 13 
</p>
<p>million email addresses from 
</p>
<p>individuals who visited his official 
</p>
<p>website (7 www.barackobama.
com). Over 7000 different &laquo;call to 
</p>
<p>action&raquo; email messages were sent 
</p>
<p>out, each including a request for

<p>billion emails, which raised over 
</p>
<p>$500 million in donations.
</p>
<p>Social Media
</p>
<p>Social media has been hailed as a

</p>
<p>Along with verified accounts,

<p>When developing the offer, the company must 
keep in mind the established objectives. Some 
examples of these objectives may be to attract new 
customers or members, obtain repeated business 
from existing customers, reactivate lapsed cus-
tomers, produce sales leads, or acquire new cus-
tomers. The offer planning should develop upon 
the required elements.
</p>
<p> 5 What is the product positioning?
 5 What is the price?
 5 What is the length of commitment?
 5 What are the payment terms?
 5 What are the risk reduction mechanisms?
</p>
<p>At the same time as marketers look at these ele-
ments, they should also be seeking answers to the 
following questions:
</p>
<p> 5 How much can they afford to spend on the 
incentive? For example, what is the allowable 
marketing cost?
</p>
<p> 5 Which promotion type should be used as an 
incentive? (price-incentives, free samples, 
coupons, etc.)
</p>
<p> 5 What should be the promotional  package?&nbsp;(cre-
ative message, design, materials, etc.)
</p>
<p> 5 Which promotional media should be used? 
(television, radio, directs mail, etc.)
</p>
<p> 5 Does it involve one-stage or several stages?
</p>
<p>Answers to these questions will help estimate 
campaign costs and profitability. These answers 
should be recorded in the CRM system. They will 
be used as a model to fine-tune the campaign 
results.

<p>Metropolitan Life Insurance 
</p>
<p>Company (MetLife)
</p>
<p>MetLife Insurance Company is one 
</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s largest insurance 
</p>
<p>providers, with customers in more 
</p>
<p>than 60 countries. In 2008, the firm 
</p>
<p>decided to launch a retention 
</p>
<p>campaign for existing customers in 
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, since the state 
</p>
<p>made up a large portion of its 
</p>
<p>business and rate deregulation was 
</p>
<p>causing increased competition 
</p>
<p>among insurance providers.
</p>
<p>When designing the campaign, 
</p>
<p>MetLife segmented its customers 
</p>
<p>based on their profitability, duration 
</p>
<p>of their relationship with the 
</p>
<p>company, products purchased, and 
</p>
<p>the channel through which they 
</p>
<p>purchased insurance policies. Control 
</p>
<p>groups were also created to measure 
</p>
<p>the program&rsquo;s overall success.
</p>
<p>MetLife subsequently sent out 
</p>
<p>postcards, letters, and custom 
</p>
<p>publications to all existing customers 
</p>
<p>in Massachusetts to remind them of 
</p>
<p>the value and benefits that their 
</p>
<p>insurance policies and products 
</p>
<p>provided. This campaign was 
</p>
<p>conducted over the course of 1&nbsp;year, 
</p>
<p>and resulted in a.87% increase in 
</p>
<p>customer retention. The campaign 
</p>
<p>proved highly successful, as a.25% 
</p>
<p>increase was MetLife&rsquo;s initial goal and 
</p>
<p>would have sufficiently covered the 
</p>
<p>overall campaign costs.

</p>
<p>11.2.5  Campaign Budget
</p>
<p>The campaign budget allocates resources and 
coordinates expenditures across the marketing 
activities associated with the campaign (advertis-
ing fees, testing costs, list rentals, etc.). When cal-
culating the campaign budget, the marketer will 
use a mix of estimates for both directly measurable 
and less easily measured activities (e.g., the long-
term effect of advertising). In reality; the estimates 
for these less measurable activities come from 
similar past experiences, benchmarking, or plain 
guesswork. Although this might look unconven-
tional, it is still better to make an educated guess 
than to neglect these estimates. In general; allocat-
ing the optimum financial resource level to each 
</p>
<p>activity is a difficult task, and that is why arriving at 
a campaign budget should be a balance between 
measurement, financial calculations, competitive 
analysis, and good judgment.
</p>
<p>There are many ways to calculate a budget. 
Some companies think of the campaign budget as 
a percentage of turnover derived from the sales 
forecast of a particular product or service (e.g., 
the general management establishes a sales objec-
tive of $2 million and states that the marketing 
department can only afford $500,000 on market-
ing activities with this product). Other firms may 
look at the previous year&rsquo;s budget and adjust it for 
the campaigns for the current year (e.g., the com-
pany spent $500,000. on last year&rsquo;s marketing 
activities and this year is going to adjust it for the 
price increase of advertisement fees, inflation, 
etc.)
</p>
<p>While there are no right or wrong ways to cal-
culate a budget, we will present seven common 
methods to calculate a budget and present their 
main advantages and disadvantages:
 1. Preset budgeting
 2. Budgeting for an allowable marketing cost

<p>       . Table&nbsp;11.4 Offer options
</p>
<p>Offer option Description
</p>
<p>Price incentives The customer gets a discount off the regular purchase price (a specific dollar amount 
</p>
<p>or a percentage discount)
</p>
<p>Payment options Making it easier for customers to buy from you. These can be company&rsquo;s credit cards, 
</p>
<p>easy pay plans, etc.
</p>
<p>&laquo;You have been 
</p>
<p>specially chosen&raquo;
</p>
<p>Recognition is a motivating factor for customers. If they feel special they are more 
</p>
<p>willing to buy. Offering something special to regular customers or inviting them to be 
</p>
<p>part of a special club are some variations of this offer type
</p>
<p>Premiums A premium is usually a free item or a nominal fee offered as an incentive to purchase a 
</p>
<p>particular product or service (free information, gifts, etc.)
</p>
<p>Samples Offer samples of the product or service you are selling
</p>
<p>Free trial Offer the customers a free-trial period to try the product
</p>
<p>Automatic shipment Keep sending out merchandise to customers until they cancel their order. Many 
</p>
<p>publishing companies do this in order to renew subscriptions
</p>
<p>&laquo;Member gets 
</p>

</p>
<p>One effective way of getting new customers is offering regular customers a gift or a 
</p>
<p>dollar incentive to introduce others the company&rsquo;s product or service
</p>
<p>Early bird offer If the customer buys before the deadline he will pay a special low price
</p>
<p>Contests and 
</p>
<p>sweepstakes
</p>
<p>Customers are given the chance to win a prize if they purchase something
</p>
<p>Multiple discount 
</p>
<p>offers
</p>
<p>Customers who spend a lot of money with the company like to receive special 
</p>
<p>treatment, so companies offer discount on big volume purchases, for example
</p>
<p>Multiple product offer Companies group related products under one price and entice customers to buy the 
</p>
<p>whole package
</p>
<p>Deluxe edition The company offers the regular product at a specific price and then it offers the 
</p>
<p>deluxe edition or the enhanced version of the product at a promotional cost
</p>
<p>Bounce-back When a customer puts an order, the company includes another offer in the package it 
</p>
<p>sends
</p>
<p>Money back guarantee Offering a guarantee or warranty is an oral or written promise by a manufacturer or 
</p>
<p>retailer that they will stand behind a product or service
</p>
<p>Source: De Bonis and Peterson (1997).
</p>
<p> 3. Budgeting with the competitive parity method
 4. Budgeting with the objective and task method
 5. Budgeting with the percentage of sales method
 6. Budgeting with key performance indicators
 7. Budgeting using the lifetime value method
</p>
<p> Preset Budgeting
</p>
<p>Most companies determine a given year&rsquo;s market-
ing expenditure on the basis of what they spent 
the year before, by applying a ratio that adjusts 
media cost inflation, projected sales increase or 
decrease, market conditions, and so on.
</p>
<p>Advantages
</p>
<p>The campaign budget won&rsquo;t be drastically cut over 
the years, so it will follow a more or less steady 
expenditure flow.
</p>
<p>Disadvantages
</p>
<p>Working with a preset budget that doesn&rsquo;t take 
into account last year&rsquo;s sales is the least effective 
way of calculating a budget. Companies treat 
marketing as an expenditure instead of as an 
investment to boost future sales. As a conse-
quence, working with this kind of budget plan-
</p>
<p> Chapter 11 &middot; Campaign Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>221 11
</p>
<p>ning may be hazardous for the firm, rendering its 
business less competitive and slower to change.
</p>
<p>Although this is the least effective way to 
establish a budget, it is, in fact, one of the most 
commonly adopted.
</p>
<p> Budgeting for&nbsp;an&nbsp;Allowable 
Marketing Cost
</p>
<p>Budgeting for an allowable marketing cost (AMC) 
consists of determining the amount that can be 
spent on campaign marketing activities, while 
preserving the required profit margin. Each 
potential expenditure is given priority according 
to its forecast for return on investment, and each 
investment is given equal consideration. Its objec-
tive is to achieve the optimum revenue per cus-
tomer and maximize sale profits. The AMC is 
obtained by subtracting the costs (cost of 
goods&nbsp;+&nbsp;distribution costs) and the required profit 
margin from the total sales value.
</p>
<p>Advantages
</p>
<p>When using the AMC there is no preset limit to 
the campaign budget unless a cash-flow con-
straint is imposed. By using this method the 
 company controls costs.
</p>
<p>Disadvantages
</p>
<p>Many activities are hard to accurately forecast, 
and some activities may not pay back in a given 
year. These intricacies lead to a degree of conser-
vatism that inhibits the aggressive pursuit of an 
AMC marketing policy.
</p>
<p>Example One of the main sources of revenue for 
&laquo;Old Books Limited&raquo; comes from the subscription 
fees of its monthly magazine, Rare Books. In order 
to preserve this source of revenue, it has two choices: 
either put in place a cold mailing to obtain new sub-
scribers or a mailing-to existing subscribers, invit-
ing them to renew their subscription. It calculated 
the allowable marginal cost of each activity and 
discovered that sending four invitations (i.e., four 
direct mailings) to existing customers had a lower 
marginal cost than doing a cold mailing.
</p>
<p> Budgeting with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Competitive 
Parity Method
</p>
<p>Competitive parity tries to equate budget alloca-
tion with those of competitors. Organizations in 
competitive environments may opt for this bud-
get technique.
</p>
<p>Advantages
</p>
<p>In this method, emphasis is on competitor intel-
ligence. By checking out what the competition is 
doing, the company is adapting itself to the mar-
ket conditions.
</p>
<p>Disadvantages
</p>
<p>It is difficult to be precise as to who your competi-
tors are. It is also difficult to estimate the relative 
size of competitors, because a company&rsquo;s nearest 
competitor may be significantly bigger or smaller 
than your company. Next, marketing communi-
cation strategies are certainly different for market 
leaders and for market followers and budgeting 
based on parity may thus not be very wise. This 
method cannot satisfactorily take into account 
sudden changes in the competitive activity or 
objectives. It does not take into account the com-
pany&rsquo;s own objectives.
</p>
<p> Budgeting with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Objective 
and&nbsp;Task Method
</p>
<p>This method focuses on, first, determining the 
marketing objectives, and then deciding on the 
marketing communication tasks needed to 
achieve those objectives. By calculating the costs 
of these tasks, a budget can be set.
</p>
<p>Advantages
</p>
<p>This method focuses on marketing objectives. The 
resources are expended according to the objec-
tives.
</p>
<p>Disadvantages
</p>
<p>Implementing this method is a difficult task 
because it is not always easy to define the objec-
tives and to quantify their implementation costs. 
This method also makes an important presump-
tion: It assumes that the relationship between 
objectives and tasks is well known and under-
stood.
</p>
<p> Budgeting with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Percentage 
of&nbsp;Sales Method
</p>
<p>A fixed percentage of turnover is allocated to 
marketing communications. The marketing 
communication expenditure is directly linked to 
sales level. In order to determine the exact per-
centage to be allocated, the company looks at 
competitor allocations and industry averages. To 
define the turnover, the company can look at his-
toric sales.

</p>
<p>Advantages
</p>
<p>This method incorporates a series of alternatives, 
and it allocates costs to the objectives.
</p>
<p>Disadvantages
</p>
<p>It may be difficult to determine the percentage of 
sales that must be allocated. Competitors may 
have a small advertising budget and concentrate 
their budgets on the sales force, and this would be 
a deceiving benchmark.
</p>
<p> Budgeting with&nbsp;Key Performance 
Indicators
</p>
<p>Determining the campaign budget via some key 
performance indicators is a process that allows the 
company to figure out, in a quick way, how much 
it can afford to spend on a special promotion. 
Sometimes this analysis is called front-end analy-
sis. This analysis is done with simple performance 
</p>
<p>measures such as the cost per sale, the  conversion 
rate, the cost per inquiry, the marketing cost ratio, 
or the return on investment. These performance 
indicators are summarized in . Table&nbsp;11.5.
</p>
<p>E-mail presents itself as an effective way to 
engage customers in a dialogue. As a flexible and 
consumer-preferred communication vehicle, 
e-mail has applications across acquisition, reten-
tion, and customer service. Messages can be tai-
lored to each customer based on her/his stage of 
the buying process. E-mail also allows customers 
to opt-in with their own preferences.
</p>
<p>. Tables 11.6 and 11.7 show the key perfor-
mance indicators from a study performed by 
Forrester research, &laquo;the e-mail marketing dia-
logue,&raquo; which shows that in 1999, e-mail was the 
second most effective technique for driving traf-
fic to a Website (Nail, 2000). Retention e-mail 
generated 10% click-through rates on in-house

<p>lists. But, using e-mail as a customer acquisition 
tool is expensive because rented lists are also 
expensive.
</p>
<p> Budgeting with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lifetime Value 
Method
</p>
<p>Budgeting in the most effective and efficient way 
would imply reducing expenditures to a unit cost 
basis in order to focus on the value of individual 
customers and on the different values per cus-
tomer. Given the data recorded in the CRM data-
base, the company may predict ongoing customer 
value rather than only the individual sales reve-
nue. Knowing the lifetime value of each customer 
will allow the company to compare returns on 
alternative marketing expenditures and to com-
pare return on expenditure from obtaining 
</p>
<p> business from existing customers or from new 
ones. This gives the opportunity to efficiently allo-
cate the budget using the most profitable strate-
gies.
</p>
<p>Advantages
</p>
<p>Using the CRM database information allows the 
company to predict, in a more accurate way, the 
cost of the campaign. At the same time, it effi-
ciently allocates resources between strategies 
because it allows a comparison between the 
returns of alternative marketing campaigns.
</p>
<p>Disadvantages
</p>
<p>It is very difficult to keep track of customer values 
because most companies lack transactional data 
from customers. Forecasting the customer LTV as 
a budgeting measure is still in its infancy. Also, if 
the company doesn&rsquo;t keep track of the perfor-
mance results of past campaigns, it won&rsquo;t be able 
to compare these results with similar campaigns 
and learn from past errors. Sometimes the strat-
egy that produces the highest ROI does not pro-
vide the fastest return and therefore, it can be 
replaced by faster strategies with lower ROI.
</p>
<p>Ideally, budgeting should use LTV forecasts to 
determine the cost of a campaign. In practice, this 
may be hard to implement. So in this case, the 
marketer should proceed with both front-end 
analysis and with the allowable marketing cost 
analysis. Keep in mind that no budget should be 
done without estimation of the return of market-

preset budgeting is still a very common practice 
among companies, but it should ideally be 
replaced by the other methods discussed.
</p>
<p>11.2.6  Testing
</p>
<p>Testing involves conducting a comparison 
between different ways of proceeding with a cam-
paign. In general, it is performed under a simple 
rule: You test individual campaign elements, 
other elements remaining constant, and you mea-
sure the resultant change in the performance of 
the campaign. Testing should concentrate first 
and foremost on the most important variables 
and parameters. More importantly, one should 
aim to test all the key parameters, not just one of 
them.
</p>
<p>Testing is based on a basic principle. Take the 
current set-up of the campaign and use it as the 
control for the test. Then select the element you 
want to test and change it. Next, select a sample of 
your target customers and run a test with the 
changed element. Comparing the performance 
results of the test version with the control will illus-
trate the impact of this variable on the overall cam-
paign objectives.
</p>
<p> What Are the&nbsp;Benefits of&nbsp;Testing?
</p>
<p>Testing has value-added benefits that can improve 
your campaign success and performance. Some of 
the most important ones are listed as follows:
</p>
<p> 5 Testing shows real behavior, because it 
provides a (close to) real environment in 
which behavior is validated.
</p>
<p> 5 Testing augments and validates research.
 5 Testing also stimulates creativity, since it not 
</p>
<p>only provides healthy internal competition but 
also presents a challenge to the creative team 
to find ways to beat the control campaign.
</p>
<p> 5 Tests protect the company&rsquo;s greatest asset (the 
customers): By using only small samples with 
each test you will finally give your customers 
the proven offer.
</p>
<p> 5 Tests minimize financial risk and avoid costly 
errors.
</p>
<p> 5 Tests uncover ways to reduce costs.
</p>
<p>In general, tests help maximize the performance of 
the campaign. They are low cost (when compared 
with the overall campaign costs) and fast in pro-
viding results. They are reliable (as you resort to 
quantitative analyses), simple to execute, and easy 
to prepare (as there are less customers involved). It 
is important that tests be done on an ongoing 
basis, and not be looked at as a one-time task.
</p>
<p> What Should You&nbsp;Test?
</p>
<p>We can test almost everything in a campaign. A key 
variable is the target audience, which is in the form 
of a list of targeted customers and prospects. We can 
also test the offer variables (prices, incentives, prop-
osition), the format (physical shape, the feel and the 
size), the creative element (the appeal, the tone, and 
the message), the media, and/or the timing.

</p>
<p>The company is launching a 
</p>
<p>campaign to promote a cigar case 
</p>
<p>to new customers. The campaign 
</p>
<p>customer objective is to acquire 
</p>
<p>1000 customers. The company 
</p>
<p>can afford $30 per customer 
</p>
<p>(AMC&nbsp;=&nbsp;$30) and the gross margin 
</p>
<p>per sale will be $50. The campaign 
</p>
<p>budget for this program is $30,000 
</p>
<p>($30&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1000).
</p>
<p>The proposed campaign 
</p>
<p>strategy is to run in four types 
</p>
<p>of media: internet, direct mail (a 
</p>
<p>mailing), telemarketing and maga-
</p>
<p>zine advertisement. The company 
</p>
<p>will run a test with some custom-
</p>
<p>ers (test target audience) to assess 
</p>
<p>the most effective media. The firm 
</p>
<p>has acquired customer lists for the 
</p>
<p>different media and will conduct 
</p>
<p>the test using a 5% sample for 
</p>
<p>each, as shown in . Table&nbsp;11.8. 
For testing, the firm decided to 
</p>
<p>send promotion emails to 3000 
</p>
<p>and a mailing to 3000 prospects. 
</p>
<p>Telephone calls will be made to 
</p>
<p>500 prospects from a rental list. It 
</p>
<p>also opted to insert an ad in the 
</p>
<p>magazine Top Management whose 
</p>
<p>readers are mostly top executives. 
</p>
<p>The test campaign is an actual 
</p>
<p>campaign resulting in effective 
</p>
<p>sales, but conducted in a smaller 
</p>
<p>scale with respect to the final 
</p>
<p>campaign.
</p>
<p>The first step is to determine 
</p>
<p>the test budget and its size rela-
</p>
<p>tive to the total campaign budget. 
</p>
<p>Multiplying the cost per medium 
</p>
<p>by the audience size gives the total 
</p>
<p>test budget cost, which is $10,800. 
</p>
<p>This figure represents 36% of the 
</p>
<p>campaign budget (calculations are 
</p>
<p>shown in . Table&nbsp;11.9).

</p>
<p>Break-even target response 
</p>
<p>rates can be obtained which 
</p>
<p>quantify the number of custom-
</p>
<p>ers needed to cover the testing 
</p>
<p>costs. This is calculated as the ratio 
</p>
<p>between test costs ($10,800) and 
</p>
<p>the AMC ($30) for each medium (for 
</p>
<p>example, 40 customers would be 
</p>
<p>needed to respond to the cold mail-
</p>
<p>ing, representing 1.3% of the 3000 
</p>
<p>target audience size, to cover the 
</p>
<p>mailing costs).
</p>
<p>Having run the test, the firm 
</p>
<p>gets actual response rates. These 
</p>
<p>will help estimate the effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of each medium, by comparing the 
</p>
<p>target response rates (needed to 
</p>
<p>break-even on campaign costs) and 
</p>
<p>the actual test response rate (which 
</p>
<p>is an estimate for the campaign 
</p>
<p> roll-out results). . Table&nbsp;11.9 pres-
ents the results.
</p>
<p>Next, with the actual test 
</p>
<p>response rate, the firm can calculate 
</p>
<p>the total gross margin of having 
</p>
<p>run the test, which is obtained by 
</p>
<p>multiplying the actual number of 
</p>
<p>customers that made a purchase by 
</p>
<p>the gross margin per sale ($50). The 
</p>
<p>net profit margin will consist of sub-
</p>
<p>tracting the test costs from the total 
</p>
<p>gross margin. At this stage the firm 
</p>
<p>has all the necessary elements to 
</p>
<p>determine the ROI of each medium. 
</p>
<p>The ROI is the ratio between the 
</p>
<p>net profit margin and the test 
</p>
<p>cost, expressed as a percentage. 
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp;11.10 shows the results.
Given these results, the firm 
</p>
<p>should run the campaign with the 
</p>
<p>media that presented the highest 
</p>
<p>ROI: email to prospective custom-
</p>
<p>ers.
</p>
<p>After the test campaign, there 
</p>
<p>is a remaining budget of $19,200 
</p>
<p>of the original $30,000. This will be 
</p>
<p>used to send emails to the remain-
</p>
<p>ing 57,000 email addresses not 
</p>
<p>used by the test. Total cost for the 
</p>
<p>email campaign will be $17,100, 
</p>
<p>which leaves $2100 for the next 
</p>
<p>best ROI- medium: an ad in Top 
</p>
<p>Management magazine. However, 
</p>
<p>the cheapest ad insertion available 
</p>
<p>in this magazine costs $5000, well 
</p>
<p>over the remaining budget. It is 
</p>
<p>still possible to use the third-best 
</p>
<p>ROI medium: direct mail using a 
</p>
<p>rental list. A total of 5250 promo-
</p>

</p>
<p>When determining the budget, the company 
should consider the importance it wants to give to 
testing, since this has a cost. If the marketing cam-
paign is based on a well-known process (e.g., the 
company uses past designs of campaigns to  promote 
similar products or services), then testing could be 
carried out with one or two tests, in order to make 
minor improvements. If the campaign aims at some-
thing new, like product or market development then 
testing should be more exhaustive. The following 
case provides an example of testing the media.
</p>
<p> Does Testing Predict the&nbsp;Future?
</p>
<p>Testing allows you to do a small-scale measure-
ment of the potential campaign results. It can 
accurately give you the performance results for 
the overall campaign, through the testing of the 
following performance measures:
</p>
<p> 5 Response to the campaign, in percentage: 
Running a test campaign will generate results 
from the customers selected to participate in 
it. The number of responses obtained (e.g., 
customer subjects who responded positively 
to the incentive), divided by the total number 
of customers selected, will give the response 
rate, in percentage. This number will serve as 
an indicator of the success that the particular 
campaign being tested can achieve.
</p>
<p> 5 Campaign profitability: The performance 
results of the test allow you to do an estimate 
</p>
<p>of the revenues of the real campaign. From 
this, you should deduct the total campaign 
costs (expenses of preparing the campaign, 
testing costs plus those of running the 
campaign). This gives you a prediction for the 
profitability of the campaign.
</p>
<p> Testing in&nbsp;Different Media
</p>
<p> 5 Direct Mail: Just about any element in the direct 
mail is testable, ranging from the format and 
the package, the message, the creativity concept, 
the distribution lists to the offer itself. This is 
possible for direct mail because the direct 
marketer controls every aspect of the campaign, 
including the timing and the budget.
</p>
<p> 5 Telemarketing: In one call session, the 
telephone operators can promote a particular 
product or service, can test a different script, 
or can test a promotion. In a single day direct 
marketers can have enough responses to 
obtain a fairly good indication about the 
success of the offer. The time of response to a 
phone call is one of the unquestionable 
advantages of telemarketing.1
</p>
<p>1 However, the federal do-not-call implementation has 
</p>
<p>made it mandatory for telemarketers to scrub their 
</p>
<p>contact lists against the national do-not-call registry 
</p>
<p>31&nbsp;days.

<p> 5 Press and Inserts: When testing in print 
advertisement, the direct marketer can test 
almost everything about the editorial fit: the 
audience composition, the magazine/
newspaper circulation, the ad placement 
cost, the timing of the ad placement, its 
frequency, and the position of the ad or its 
color. Although testing is possible, it is not 
as easy and inexpensive as telemarketing or 
direct mail. The most used tests are split-
run testing, A/B splits, and cross-over 
testing.
</p>
<p> 5 Split-Run Testing: Split-run testing is usually 
used for inserts. It compares the same title 
or message in two different insert formats, 
by alternating them in the print run. 
Basically, you insert a different code or a 
different phone number in each format so as 
to track which version has the best response 
rate.
</p>
<p>Example of a Split-Run Test: A company that 
produces crystal glasses for different types of 
wine is going to test four different ads (B, C, D, 
and E) against a control ad A to find out which ad 
performs better. This test will be performed in 
four different wine magazines with different audi-
ences.
</p>
<p>Analyzing the test results given in . Table&nbsp;11.11, 
ads B, C and E reveal a greater lift than ad A.&nbsp;In this 
particular test, ad C will be chosen to run the cam-
paign because it presents the greatest lift of all the 
ads tested.
</p>
<p> 5 A/B splits: You run two versions of the print 
run (A and B) in alternative copies of the 
same publication. Usually, creative or color 
changes are tested this way. As in split-run 
testing you should devise a mechanism for 
tracking response.
</p>
<p> 5 Cross-Over Testing: You run two versions of 
the same advertisement: one version changes 
the creative message (A), the other changes 
the color (B). Then you insert version A in the 
first issue of magazine 1 and in the second 
issue of magazine 2. You then insert version B 
in the second issue of magazine 1 and in the 
first issue of magazine 2. This enables you to 
compare the response improvement when 
creative elements or color were changed. The 
response change in magazine 1 assesses the 
creative elements change, while response 
change in magazine 2 evaluates the color 
effect.
</p>
<p>Example of a Cross-Over Test: Following the pre-
ceding example, imagine that the company wants 
to cross-over test ad A with ad B in two wine 
magazines.
</p>
<p>In this case it is possible to compare the 
results of each issue of both magazines and com-
pare creative concepts. As . Table&nbsp; 11.12 shows, 
ad A performed better in the first issue of World 
Wine than in the second issue of Food and Wine. 
Ad B performed better in the first issue of Food 
and Wine than in the second issue of World Wine. 
If we compare the creative concepts, we realize

</p>
<p> How Reliable Are the&nbsp;Test 
Predictions?
</p>
<p>Testing is meant to allow the marketer to make 
inferences using established methods of analysis. It 
is beyond the scope of this book to explain in detail 
the statistical models used to analyze test results. 
Some of the statistical techniques that can be used 
for this purpose are hypothesis testing, confidence 
intervals, and analysis of variance. For more on 
these techniques, readers can refer to Marketing 
Research by Aaker, Kumar, and Day (2004).
</p>
<p> What Are the&nbsp;Potential Problems 
in&nbsp;Testing?
</p>
<p>For testing to support profitable campaigns, one 
should be aware of the following potential errors:
</p>
<p> 5 The marketer should avoid performing sev-
eral tests with the same set of customers: If 
you keep using the same group of customers 
for several runs of one campaign test, you 
should expect lower response rates. The same 
thing happens if you use the same fixed group 
for several campaigns in a short period of 
time. You must be aware of the extent to which 
there are diminishing returns. Therefore, you 
should plan the ideal frequency with which a 
customer is approached (i.e., the point where 
the marginal cost of testing exceeds the mar-
ginal revenue generated by the test).
</p>
<p> 5 Testing results have limited time validity: 
Since customer preferences change over peri-
ods of time, conclusions drawn from tests are 
sometimes short-lived. Ongoing tests may 
provide adequate responses which reflect 
these changes.
</p>
<p> 5 Don&rsquo;t test the same things all over again: 
As testing means only changing one or few 
variables, other things equal, change the 
analysis variable so you can see what changes 
in the results.
</p>
<p> 5 Overall marketing objectives should drive 
your testing: More important than optimiz-
ing a particular campaign is to have a 
successful marketing program.
</p>
<p>11.3  Campaign Execution
</p>
<p>The campaign execution stage is the operational 
process by which a campaign is implemented. 
There are two important aspects at this stage: 
implementation and monitoring.
</p>
<p>11.3.1  Implementation 
and&nbsp;Coordination
</p>
<p>A thin line separates the development from the 
implementation stage. This difference arises from 
the fact that implementation summarizes every-
thing that was developed and identifies all that 
has to be done before actually running the cam-
paign. In order to implement the campaign, an 
action plan should be prepared to guide this pro-
cess and all the resources involved. This plan 
should be divided into three sub-plans:
 1. Campaign program
 2. Campaign schedule
 3. Activity schedule
</p>
<p> Campaign Program
</p>
<p>The campaign program is a summary of every-
thing that has to be executed to run the campaign. 
It should lay out the list of tasks to be accom-
plished. These are to be assigned to a list of team 
</p>

</p>
<p>members. It should contain the campaign briefing 
forms designed for members of the team and out-
side suppliers (e.g. advertising agency, merchan-
dise suppliers, etc.). In order to coordinate the 
tasks between all persons involved, each task 
should be defined a deadline for completion. The 
summary of all these deadlines should result in 
the campaign timetable. Once the media and the 
promotion offer are chosen, the marketing team 
should do a description of all materials to be pro-
duced (the format, the color, the creative message) 
and events to take place (if it is a one-stage or a 
two-stage campaign).
</p>
<p> Campaign Schedule
</p>
<p>The campaign schedule lists the events that are 
planned and their respective timing. If this cam-
paign is planned to coincide with other marketing 
activity a clash schedule should be done in order 
to identify potential conflicts of resources, timing 
and customer targets.
</p>
<p>There are two key differences between the 
campaign and the activity schedule. The first one 
is directly related to the campaign components 
and the second one relates with the operational 
activity of the company itself.
</p>
<p> Activity Schedule
</p>
<p>It is very important to organize your company&rsquo;s 
activity during a campaign. Interdependent 
actions should be identified and time should be 
efficiently allocated for the completion of activ-
ities. It is at this stage that the critical path 
method can be applied. The critical path tech-
nique involves placing a time factor in each 
phase of the campaign, figuring what are the 
necessary precedent activities for each one and 
sequencing all the campaign phases (basically it 
works as a backward timetable). One advantage 
of this method is that it identifies potential 
bottlenecks and allows revision of allowed tim-
ings.
</p>
<p>One important feature of activity scheduling 
is that not only does it allow sufficient time for 
completion and approval of the tasks but it also 
keeps the information up-to-date. Even when the 
campaign is running, its status will continue to be 
reported. The example of a Gantt chart2 is shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;11.3.
</p>
<p>2 Gantt chart is a graphical representation of the 
</p>
<p>duration of tasks against the progression of time.
</p>
<p>11.3.2  Monitoring and&nbsp;Fine-Tuning
</p>
<p>Monitoring is an ongoing process. When waiting 
until the end of the campaign one cannot make 
adjustments, such as schedule modifications. 
Nevertheless, the full effect of the campaign can-
not be totally known until all the results have been 
received and analyzed. If the company is running 
an integrated campaign where results can be 
tracked through response, then the first status 
report will show the preliminary results that 
should be compared with the forecast results in 
order to show progress. Acting on the first results 
will allow a timely corrective action and the more 
up-to-date is the report, the more useful the cor-
rections will be.
</p>
<p>One question that should arise is &laquo;How can 
this process be fine-tuned?&raquo; Depending on the 
first measurable effects of a campaign, fine-tuning 
can be done in the following cases:
</p>
<p> 5 The planning may be revised based on 
enquiry or orders performance alone. This 
adjustment is done based on the assumption 
that the conversion rate stays close to the 
forecasted level.
</p>
<p> 5 The media selection may be adjusted. The 
first media results will determine if the adver-
tising space in a specific media is profitable 
and if the media booking or cost should be 
cancelled or renegotiated.
</p>
<p> 5 If the campaign included a first sequence of 
creative and offer testing, then corrective 
action should be undertaken as quickly as 
possible.
</p>
<p>11.3.3  Problems to&nbsp;Take into 
Account
</p>
<p>Campaign management and particularly cam-
paign execution involves the marketing team, 
other departments (sales force, call center, opera-
tions department, etc.), top management and out-
side suppliers. Many things can go wrong during 
the process. If the marketer runs a direct mail to 
customers requiring them to call the company&rsquo;s 
call-center and if the telemarketing team is not 
adequately informed about the campaign features, 
then the most probable outcome is that the cam-
paign will be a failure On the other hand, suppli-
ers should be briefed on the campaign program 
</p>
<p>11.3 &middot; Campaign Execution</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>230
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>(the delivery dates, paper quality, color process, 
package dimensions, the script, etc.) in order to 
avoid rush work or imperfections. Then again, 
briefing every actor involved in this process is 
fundamental to the campaigns&rsquo; success.
</p>
<p>We have identified some causes of campaign 
failures:
</p>
<p> 5 When the marketing planning is undertaken 
at a functional level and does not integrate 
with other functional areas of the company, 
then the campaign will be largely ineffective.
</p>
<p> 5 Separating the responsibilities of operational 
marketing and strategic marketing planning 
will lead to a divergence of short and long 
term objectives. Concern over short-term 
results at the operational level will make the 
company less competitive in the long term.
</p>
<p> 5 If top management doesn&rsquo;t take an active role 
in marketing planning then it will probably 
not be an effective system.
</p>
<p> 5 If the degree of formalization of campaign 
management is not adapted to the diversity of 
operations within the company and its size, 
then campaign execution process won&rsquo;t be 
effective.
</p>
<p>11.4  Analysis and&nbsp;Control
</p>
<p>Analysis and control end the campaign man-
agement cycle. In this phase, marketers should 
be able to draw some conclusions about the 
campaign success and use these results not only 
to improve their customer knowledge but also

</p>
<p>to improve future campaigns. This is an impor-
tant stage because it evaluates campaign results 
in light of the original objectives and deter-
mines the campaign level of success or failure. 
Features that run well should be used as &laquo;best 
practices&raquo; for other campaigns. For features 
that didn&rsquo;t perform well, marketers should 
search the reasons why this has happened. This 
research should be recorded in the CRM data-
base to serve as a learning lesson to future cam-
paigns.
</p>
<p>Campaign analysis can be done in many ways. 
Marketers can use campaign key performance 
indicators (KPI) and compare them with bud-
geted KPI&rsquo;s and campaign objectives. They can 
also perform back end performance analysis to 
determine the purchase behavior of campaign 
respondents. Finally, more elaborated analysis 
can be performed, such as profile and response 
analysis, to link profiles and behavior with the 
campaign.
</p>
<p>11.4.1  Measuring Campaign Results
</p>
<p>Marketers can start measuring campaign results 
while the campaign is still running. As discussed 
in the previous section, as soon the results are 
known and analyzed the sooner action can be 
taken to fine-tune the campaign execution. 
Standard performance measures are the key per-
formance indicators (KPI) discussed in the bud-
get section. Comparing the CPM, CPS, ROI, and 
the CR with the budgeted KIP will give an intui-
tive idea about the campaign results. But market-
ers should look deeper and try to understand 
which target segment is driving the campaign 
success or what medium performed better and 
why. Back- end performance analysis is one of the 
answers to evaluate campaign results. It relates the 
behavior of a group of respondents with sales, 
contribution, and profit achieved in the cam-
paign. It also relates this group of respondents 
with the advertising medium that converted them 
into customers.
</p>
<p>In order to measure back-end performance it 
is necessary to maintain a system in which each 
customer is identified as coming from a specific 
advertising medium. Only then it is possible to 
analyze the behavior of all customers coming 
from the same initial source medium and calcu-
</p>
<p>late average sales, contribution and profits. Back- 
end performance will vary significantly from one 
advertising medium to another. For example, 
results from some direct marketing campaigns 
show that buyers acquired from direct mail buy 
more often than customers acquired through a 
magazine or newspaper insertion. Then it 
becomes vital to track customer performance in 
terms of its original medium source group, so 
that the decision to reinvest in a particular 
medium can be made on the basis of proven per-
formance.
</p>
<p>Back-end performance can be measured in 
many ways. For example, in a direct mailing, the 
measurement of back-end performance is simply 
the statement of profit or loss for the campaign 
promotion. For a loyalty program, this measure-
ment should be done in terms of the allowable 
marketing cost and the break-even. These two 
indicators will then be compared with the cus-
tomer acquisition cost to determine customer 
contribution. Contribution is a formula that 
deducts from the gross margin the campaign 
costs and then divides the resulting value by the 
number of new customers. In the case of loyalty 
campaigns it is more adequate to calculate contri-
bution in terms of the new customer lifetime 
value, because it can forecast future sales and 
profits from the new comers. Another measure to 
take into account is the attrition rate. This mea-
sure is used to determine the rate at which cus-
tomers defect. When evaluating the profitability, 
for example, of a newspaper or magazine cam-
paign to increase subscriptions or renewals, the 
KPI to take into account are the conversion rate, 
the renewal rates and the response rate to promo-
tions.
</p>
<p>In all cases, when running a promotions cam-
paign, marketers should always calculate the 
return on promotion (ROP). ROP is a way of cal-
culating the return on investment of a particular 
promotion:
</p>
<p>ROP
Contribution Cost per order
</p>
<p>Cost per order
=
</p>
<p>&minus;( )


</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
&times;100
</p>
<p>The return is measured by the difference between 
the contribution that results from all the pur-
chases that occur due to the promotion and the 
cost of acquiring the purchase.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>232
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>11.4.2  Response Analysis
</p>
<p>Response analysis calculates the campaign results 
up-to-date, projects its final results, such as 
responses, inquiries and leads, and analyzes these 
results. Response analyzes can be performed with 
customer and market segments, product lines, 
campaigns, offers and promotions, media or 
advertising agencies. To be able to perform this 
type of analysis, responses should be summarized 
by time&mdash;that is, by arrival date. Each response 
should be recorded at the CRM database and 
should have the calendar date it arrived. Results 
can then be analyzed as soon as the first campaign 
responses are known and eventually they can cor-
rect the campaign progression. Response analysis 
uses statistical models such as regression analysis 
models to determine the impact of several vari-
ables of interest (age, gender, level of income, etc.) 
on probability of response.
</p>
<p>11.4.3  Profile Analysis
</p>
<p>Profile analysis is used to define and compare the 
profile of campaign responders with the actual 
profile of the company&rsquo;s customers and prospects. 
This comparison will allow marketers to verify if 
the initial targeted profile actually corresponds 
with the responder&rsquo;s profiles, i.e., if the customer 
segments were well targeted. Profile analyses can 
and should be performed at different stages of the 
campaign. It should be performed at the cam-
paign planning stage, when defining the target 
segments; as part of the designing tests, as cam-
paign results are received and after a campaign is 
completed to verify attrition.
</p>
<p>The profile characteristics are recorded in the 
CRM database and they are used in this type of 
analysis if they can be related to the customer or 
prospect name. These characteristics may be funda-
mental (birth date, gender) or derived (age, score). 
Profile analysis considers the input (generally geo-
graphic, demographic or psychographic) and clus-
ters names into groups with similar tastes and 
preferences. Two other statistical techniques used 
in profiles analysis are automatic interaction detec-
tion (AID) and chi-square automatic interaction 
detection (CHAID). These are not discussed in this 
</p>
<p>text6; for more information on these techniques, 
see Marketing Research by Aaker et&nbsp;al. (2004).
</p>
<p>By predicting the actions of customers or 
prospects by using these analyses, the company is 
refining and improving its marketing strategy.
</p>
<p>11.5  Campaign Feedback
</p>
<p>Everyday practice shows that it is far more valu-
able to have a reliable assessment of the measur-
able effects of marketing campaigns upfront. The 
effective registration of past marketing activities 
and their results, combined with modeling meth-
ods, different media and customer segments, 
enable the marketer to support campaign deci-
sions in advance and to optimize them at the 
implementation stage. Information on successes, 
failures and the circumstances under which the 
campaigns were carried out should be stored. 
Patterns can be found and correlation between 
historical successes and campaign elements can 
be used as learning to ensure future success.
</p>
<p>Companies should compile detailed informa-
tion about the main aspects of campaigns, such as 
concepts, target groups, media used and campaign 
performance, into their CRM database. This way 
models can be designed to describe causal relation-
ships between the variables under the marketer&rsquo;s 
control and criteria for success. The use of this 
stored information supports informed future action 
because it allows the prediction of the market envi-
ronment in which certain campaigns will succeed. 
Recording and analyzing the success and failures of 
past campaigns improves the profitability of future 
campaigns. Deviations between achieved and 
desired results are minimized through the correct 
use of this compiled knowledge.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that three steps should be imple-
mented in order to ensure successful campaigns 
and to enhance knowledge for the company:
 1. Record all relevant data about campaign

 Z4 Launch Campaign at BMW
</p>
<p>BMW, the Munich-based luxury 
</p>
<p>carmaker is a strong believer in 
</p>
<p>CRM practices across dealers and 
</p>
<p>end customers. Traditionally, 
</p>
<p>customers communicated with 
</p>
<p>dealers and dealers with the BMW 
</p>
<p>Group. Today, many end custom-
</p>
<p>ers expect to communicate 
</p>
<p>directly with the BMW Group. The 
</p>
<p>challenge therefore for BMW (and 
</p>
<p>any carmaker) is to establish the 
</p>
<p>relationship between BMW Group 
</p>
<p>and end customers and yet 
</p>
<p>strengthen the traditional 
</p>
<p>relationship between end 
</p>
<p>customers and dealers. BMW 
</p>
<p>Group&rsquo;s CRM approach is 
</p>
<p>therefore very integrated in 
</p>
<p>nature, both in terms of spanning 
</p>
<p>dealers and end customers, as 
</p>
<p>well as in terms of customer 
</p>
<p>service, new customer attraction, 
</p>
<p>and loyalization.
</p>
<p>The launch of the Z4 roadster 
</p>
<p>in 2002/2003 is a prototypical 
</p>
<p>example for BMW Group&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>approach. The objectives were to 
</p>
<p>position the car in the premium 
</p>
<p>segment, to conquer new 
</p>
<p>customers, and to loyalize owners 
</p>
<p>of the previous model Z3. An 
</p>
<p>integrated communications 
</p>
<p>campaign was launched that 
</p>
<p>coordinated TV and print 
</p>
<p>campaigns, direct marketing, 
</p>
<p>preview events, electronic media 
</p>
<p>as well as dealer marketing. The 
</p>
<p>goal of the entire campaign was to 
</p>
<p>select relevant prospects for the 
</p>
<p>actual launch in March 2003. In 
</p>
<p>practice, this meant that the 
</p>
<p>addresses of the most interested 
</p>
<p>set of prospects were known at 
</p>
<p>launch and that these individuals 
</p>
<p>were then invited for closed room 
</p>
<p>and preview events. The selection 
</p>
<p>was made based on prospects&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>reaction to the mailings, emails, 
</p>
<p>Short Message Service (SMS), and 
</p>
<p>Internet offers. The activities 
</p>
<p>started with bulk mail activities, 
</p>
<p>followed by TV and print inserts. 
</p>
<p>These initial teasers set off a 
</p>
<p>second wave where interested 
</p>
<p>parties would call or email a 
</p>
<p>service center that then forwarded 
</p>
<p>information material to these 
</p>
<p>qualified prospects. These address 
</p>
<p>data and email addresses formed a 
</p>
<p>key part of the prospect database. 
</p>
<p>Prospects could then also sign up 
</p>
<p>for preview events where the 
</p>
<p>actual car was shown. Using 
</p>
<p>feedback from these preview 
</p>
<p>events, information on the hottest 
</p>
<p>prospects was then given to the 
</p>
<p>dealers who followed up on the 
</p>
<p>prospects for landing the sales. 
</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the pre-
</p>
<p>launch activities was measured in 
</p>
<p>terms of number and quality of 
</p>
<p>prospects, response rate of 
</p>
<p>activities, and cost per contact. 
</p>
<p>Overall, the campaign was 
</p>
<p>extremely successful in not only 
</p>
<p>achieving the desired premium 
</p>
<p>positioning but also in terms of 
</p>
<p>leading sales in the segment of 
</p>
<p>premium roadsters.
</p>
<p> ? Questions on Minicase 11.1
 1. Explain the likely issues (as discussed in 
</p>
<p>the chapter) that may come up during 
</p>
<p>the Z4 campaign management process.
</p>
<p> 2. Should the campaign stop here? Are there 
</p>
<p>opportunities for BMW to proceed 
</p>
<p>campaigning with the new owners of the 
</p>
<p>Z4? What are some of those opportunities?
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>A campaign is a series of interconnected 
</p>
<p>promotional efforts usually undertaken within 
</p>
<p>a defined timeframe, designed to capture 
</p>
<p>customer&rsquo;s interest, and thereby achieve 
</p>
<p>precise marketing goals. A successful cam-
</p>
<p>paign management process comprises of 
</p>
<p>planning, development, execution and 
</p>
<p>analysis. At the campaign planning stage, 
</p>
<p>marketers make strategic decisions that define 
</p>
<p>the overall objectives of the campaign, the 
</p>
<p>best communication message and the best 
</p>
<p>target audience. The objectives often are 
</p>
<p>market penetration, market extension, product 
</p>
<p>development or diversification. When pursuing 
</p>
<p>a customer retention strategy, ideally the 
</p>
<p>company should target its most profitable 
</p>
<p>customers via LTV (lifetime value) and RFM 
</p>
<p>(recency, frequency, and monetary) analyses. 
</p>
<p>The company can choose to pursue market 
</p>
<p>penetration or extension, market diversifica-
</p>
<p>tion or new product development. 
</p>
<p>Communication strategy involves choosing the 
</p>
<p>most effective message and media (for 
</p>
<p>retention and acquisition strategies) to 
</p>
<p>efficiently reach its target segments.
</p>
<p>Identification of the customer segments 
</p>
<p>(homogenous groups of individuals that have 
</p>
<p>similar tastes, wants and needs regarding the 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s products or services) that the

</p>
<p>campaign will target can be done using 
</p>
<p>lifetime segmentation and profiling, and on the 
</p>
<p>basis of purchase behavior and profile data. 
</p>
<p>The CRM database plays a central role in the 
</p>
<p>segmentation process by providing informa-
</p>
<p>tion on customer behaviors and profiles, 
</p>
<p>channel preferences and brand awareness. 
</p>
<p>Marketing communications (marcom) are 
</p>
<p>targeted interactions between the company 
</p>
<p>and its customers and prospects using one or 
</p>
<p>more media. Integrated marketing communi-
</p>
<p>cations (IMC) involves the management and 
</p>
<p>organization of all the marketing communica-
</p>
<p>tion tools to deliver a clear and consistent 
</p>
<p>message about the company and the product. 
</p>
<p>Targeting the customers that provide a higher 
</p>
<p>potential yield should be done in a way that 
</p>
<p>maximizes the marketing communications 
</p>
<p>ROI.&nbsp;Developing the offer consists of offering 
</p>
<p>the customer some kind of incentive that will 
</p>
<p>induce him/her to buy or to ask the company 
</p>
<p>for more information.
</p>
<p>The campaign budget allocates resources 
</p>
<p>and coordinates expenditures across the 
</p>
<p>marketing activities associated with the 
</p>
<p>campaign. Making a campaign budget should 
</p>
<p>be a balance between measurement, financial 
</p>
<p>calculations, competitive analysis and good 
</p>
<p>judgment. There are several methods to 
</p>
<p>calculate a budget. Pre-set budgeting deter-
</p>
<p>mines a given year&rsquo;s marketing expenditure on 
</p>
<p>the basis of what they spent the year before, by 
</p>
<p>applying a ratio that adjusts media cost 
</p>
<p>inflation, projected sales increase or decrease, 
</p>
<p>market conditions, etc. Budgeting for an 
</p>
<p>allowable marketing cost (AMC) consists of 
</p>
<p>determining the amount that can be spent on 
</p>
<p>campaign marketing activities, while preserv-
</p>
<p>ing the required profit margin. The AMC is 
</p>
<p>obtained by subtracting the costs (cost of 
</p>
<p>goods&nbsp;+&nbsp;distribution costs) and the required 
</p>
<p>profit margin from the total sales value. 
</p>
<p>Competitive parity method tries to equate 
</p>
<p>budget allocation with those of competitors. 
</p>
<p>Budgeting with the objective and task method 
</p>
<p>focuses on determining the marketing 
</p>
<p>objectives and then deciding on the marketing 
</p>
<p>communications tasks that are needed to 
</p>
<p>achieve those objectives. In the percentage of 
</p>
<p>sales method, the company looks at the 
</p>
<p>competitor allocations and on the industry 
</p>
<p>averages, to determine the exact percentage 
</p>
<p>that should be allocated. Front-end analysis 
</p>
<p>allows the company to figure out, in a quick 
</p>
<p>way, how much it can afford to spend on a 
</p>
<p>special promotion.
</p>
<p>Pre-set budgeting should ideally be 
</p>
<p>replaced by LTV forecasts, front-end analysis, 
</p>
<p>allowable marketing cost analysis and 
</p>
<p>estimation of the return of marketing invest-
</p>
<p>ment (ROI rates) because this will allow the 
</p>
<p>company to compare returns on alternative 
</p>
<p>marketing expenditures.
</p>
<p>Tests help maximize the performance of 
</p>
<p>the campaign. Key variables in testing are the 
</p>
<p>target audience, the offer, the format, the 
</p>
<p>creative element, the media and/or the timing. 
</p>
<p>Testing can accurately predict performance 
</p>
<p>measures like response to the campaign in 
</p>
<p>percentage and campaign profitability.
</p>
<p>Campaign implementation plan should be 
</p>
<p>divided into three sub-plans: the campaign 
</p>
<p>program, the campaign schedule and the 
</p>
<p>activity schedule. In the analysis and control 
</p>
<p>stage, marketers should be able to draw 
</p>
<p>conclusions about the campaign success and 
</p>
<p>use these results not only to improve their 
</p>
<p>customer knowledge but also to improve 
</p>
<p>future campaigns. Campaign analysis can be 
</p>
<p>done using campaign key performance 
</p>
<p>indicators (KPI) and comparing them with 
</p>
<p>budgeted KPI&rsquo;s and campaign objectives, by 
</p>
<p>using back end performance analysis, or even 
</p>
<p>profile and response analysis, to link profiles 
</p>
<p>and behavior with the campaign. When 
</p>
<p>running a promotions campaign, marketers 
</p>
<p>should always calculate the return on 
</p>
<p>promotion (ROP). While response analysis 
</p>
<p>calculates the campaign results up-to-date, 
</p>
<p>projects its final results, such as responses, 
</p>
<p>inquiries and leads, and analyzes these results, 
</p>
<p>profile analysis is used to define and compare 
</p>
<p>the profile of campaign responders with the 
</p>
<p>actual profile of the company&rsquo;s customers and 
</p>
<p>prospects. Recording and analyzing the 
</p>
<p>success and failures of past campaigns 
</p>
<p>improves the profitability of future cam-
</p>
<p>paigns.

</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. In 2014, United Overseas Bank (UOB) in 
</p>
<p>Singapore started a marketing campaign 
</p>
<p>to introduce e-statements and paperless 
</p>
<p>online banking to their customers. The 
</p>
<p>bank launched an online game that was 
</p>
<p>available on various platforms (desktop, 
</p>
<p>mobile, and tablet) for a promotion period 
</p>
<p>of two and a half months. The gaming 
</p>
<p>challenge for customers was to toss as 
</p>
<p>many paperbacks as possible within a 
</p>
<p>given timeframe into the bin. The game 
</p>
<p>was accessible via the customers&rsquo; online 
</p>
<p>banking account. This promotion 
</p>
<p>campaign was a huge success. Customers 
</p>
<p>could win rewards in terms of cash credit 
</p>
<p>that was deposited into their bank 
</p>
<p>account. In order to win prizes customers 
</p>
<p>need to achieve a certain scoring level and 
</p>
<p>fulfill other conditions such as being the 
</p>
<p>first fifty registered customers for a specific 
</p>
<p>promotion period. The underlying goal of 
</p>
<p>this gamification campaign was to get 
</p>
<p>consumers used to online management of 
</p>
<p>their banking account and increase the 
</p>
<p>propensity of paperless interaction with 
</p>
<p>UOB.
</p>
<p> 2. In 2015, Turkish Airlines was the first airline 
</p>
<p>that launched a live broadcasted flight 
</p>
<p>from Istanbul to New&nbsp;York in conjunction 
</p>
<p>with the Periscope video streaming app. 
</p>
<p>The live stream shows the processing of 
</p>
<p>the flight and provides exclusive insights 
</p>
<p>into the crews department. While live 
</p>
<p>streaming the flight, the back-up crew 
</p>
<p>answered question on social media 
</p>
<p>channels such as Twitter or Facebook. The 
</p>
<p>firm&rsquo;s intention is to showcase the flight 
</p>
<p>experience with Turkish Airlines by 
</p>
<p>providing consumers with the opportunity 
</p>
<p>of a first-hand up-front evaluation enabled 
</p>
<p>by livestreaming. The aim of this campaign 
</p>
<p>was to increase consumer awareness of 
</p>
<p>the firm and its services and acquire new 
</p>
<p>customers as well as increase the 
</p>
<p>consumers&rsquo; experience level with the 
</p>
<p>brand. The results showed that Turkish 
</p>
<p>Airlines had about 5.000 new followers 
</p>
<p>and received 293.000 likes on Twitter. The 
</p>
<p>broadcasting campaign was successful in 
</p>
<p>increasing the interaction level on each 
</p>
<p>digital platform and positioned Turkish 
</p>
<p>Airline as a highly professional and 
</p>
<p>innovative company (Shortyawards, 2017).
</p>
<p> ? Exercise Questions
 1. Explain the three key steps in the 
</p>
<p>management of campaigns.
</p>
<p> 2. Imagine you are the manager of a chain 
</p>

<p>campaign to attract new clients and 
</p>
<p>your available budget is $30.000. 
</p>
<p>Describe how you would go about 
</p>
<p>implementing this campaign.
</p>
<p> 3. Explain the ideas around the concept of 
</p>
<p>campaign testing? Do you think that 
</p>
<p>testing in general will become more 
</p>
<p>important in the future? Why or why not?

</p>
<p>indicators for the evaluation of campaign 
</p>
<p>success.
</p>
<p> 5. Explain the advantages and

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>Marketing channels move goods and services 
</p>
<p>from firms to consumers and other businesses. 
</p>
<p>From a customer management point of view, 
</p>
<p>firms also use channels to interact with 
</p>
<p>customers. These different channels vary not 
</p>
<p>only in their cost structures but also in their 
</p>
<p>ability to attract, bind, and serve customers. 
</p>
<p>Each customer has distinct preferences for 
</p>
<p>distribution or contact channels. To meet the 
</p>
<p>needs of various customers, businesses must 
</p>
<p>provide the right blend of direct (websites, 
</p>
<p>e-commerce, stores, call centers, and enter-
</p>
<p>prise sales representatives) and indirect 
</p>
<p>(distributors, retailers, solution providers, and 
</p>
<p>online resellers) channels. In other words, 
</p>
<p>companies should adopt a multichannel 
</p>
<p>strategy.
</p>
<p>From the consumer&rsquo;s perspective, multi-
</p>
<p>channel offers and communication imply 
</p>
<p>greater choice and more convenient access to 
</p>
<p>products and services. From the retailer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>perspective, a multichannel system poses new 
</p>
<p>implementation challenges, from delivering 
</p>
<p>consistent experiences across all channels to 
</p>
<p>fully exploiting the strengths of each channel.
</p>
<p>Multichannel marketing also poses 
</p>
<p>challenges for customer relationship manage-
</p>
<p>ment (CRM). Because focal firms interact with 
</p>
<p>the end user through channel intermediaries, 
</p>
<p>such as retailers, it is difficult for the firm to 
</p>
<p>build and nurture an effective customer 
</p>
<p>relationship program directed at the end 
</p>
<p>customer that will lead to a good working 
</p>
<p>relationship and ultimately create loyalty. Loyal 
</p>
<p>customers have greater value to the firm; they 
</p>
<p>contribute to the firm&rsquo;s profits for a long time, 
</p>
<p>whereas non-loyal customers merely generate 
</p>
<p>short-term profits. The firm thus needs to 
</p>
<p>ensure that its CRM messages and offerings 
</p>
<p>reach its target consumers without dilution or 
</p>
<p>digression. But such reach is especially difficult 
</p>
<p>when the channel intermediaries have 
</p>
<p>conflicting CRM programs in place, which often 
</p>
<p>means that the focal firm only has indirect 
</p>
<p>control over CRM implementation. Also, 
</p>
<p>multichannel marketing establishes the 
</p>
<p>challenge of eliciting customer information 
</p>
<p>from multiple channels for central processing.
</p>
<p>This chapter deals with the challenges of 
</p>
<p>channel management in the context of CRM 
</p>
<p>implementation. We point out current 
</p>
<p>multichannel issues that firms are nowadays 
</p>
<p>facing and provide insights into the manage-
</p>
<p>ment of the respective challenges.
</p>
<p>Thus we start by presenting the role of 
</p>
<p>channels in creating and maintaining customer 
</p>
<p>relationships. We discuss emerging trends with 
</p>
<p>regard to traditional and electronic channels 
</p>
<p>and shed light on related chances and 
</p>
<p>challenges for the implementation and 
</p>
<p>maintenance of CRM.&nbsp;We leave the main part of 
</p>
<p>this chapter for capturing attributes of 
</p>
<p>multichannel design, including worthwhile

<p>12.1  CRM and&nbsp;Marketing Channels
</p>
<p>The effectiveness of CRM depends to a considerable 
extent on firms&rsquo; channel strategies. Because market-
ing interactions with customers occur primarily 
through channels, conventionally, customer relation-
ships are created and sustained through marketing 
channels. Thus, marketing channels are the primary 
vehicle of relationship building. In the following sec-
tion we explain the basic channel terminology we use 
throughout this chapter, and then outline the role of 
channels with regard to CRM and multichannel 
trends that firms currently face (. Fig.&nbsp;12.2).
</p>
<p>12.1.1  What Are Channels?
</p>
<p>A channel is basically a &laquo;format&raquo; for accessing a 
customer base. Each format (or route) combines a 
package of different service outputs, i.e., functions 
that reduce the end user&rsquo;s search, waiting time, 
storage, and other costs (Coughlan, Anderson, 
Stern, &amp; El-Ansary, 2006). An Internet channel 
thus is a spatially convenient way to purchase from 
a connected home at any time. However, the time 
required to receive the product is greater than it 
would be if the purchase occurred in a store chan-
nel, which itself offers minimal spatial convenience 
but also minimizes waiting time, in that the prod-
uct may be taken home immediately. The term 
&laquo;channel&raquo; then can be used mainly in two ways.
</p>
<p>First, a channel refers to the flow of the organi-
zation&rsquo;s offerings (e.g., physical goods, informa-
tion) to ultimate end users (e.g., end customers), as 
well as of sales proceeds from the customer back to 
the focal firm. Marketing or distribution channels 
</p>
<p>then indicate all entities (e.g., distributors, whole-
salers, retailers, broker, agents) that perform func-
tions for the marketing firm, such as stocking 
inventory, conducting sales transactions, conduct-
ing payments, providing point-of-purchase infor-
mation, or offering upfront liquidity to the 
manufacturers.
</p>
<p>Second, a channel refers to the mode of com-
munication between a firm and its customers. 
These communication or contact channels convey 
information to customers to raise their awareness 
about the firm&rsquo;s products and services and per-
suade them to make purchases. Furthermore, a 
distribution channel often encompasses several 
organizations in a single term, whereas a contact 
channel typically includes only two parties.
</p>
<p>For example, the distribution channel of the 
sportswear manufacturer Adidas includes two 
distinct types of channels: wholesalers and retail-
ers. By the implementation and the specific cater-
ing of these two intermediaries, the group can 
respond better to the needs of multiple types of 
customers and become more responsive to mar-
ket developments. The contact channels between 
Adidas and its end customers refer to the modes 
of communication, such as Internet, direct mail, 
and SMS or wireless text messaging. Of course, 
different skill sets are required to manage distinc-
tive channels effectively (. Fig.&nbsp;12.3).
</p>
<p>Although distribution channels and contact 
channels are not always cleanly separated 
(remember that information exchange is a core 
task of distribution channels), we differentiate the 
terms here because the management of contact 
channels is a very important aspect of CRM.&nbsp; In 
addition, the term &laquo;channel management&raquo; often

</p>
<p>refers only to contact channels, even if this may 
not be technically precise (. Fig.&nbsp;12.4).
</p>
<p>Conventionally, in a given geographical mar-
ket, firms set up a single distribution channel that 
performs all channel functions except advertising. 
For example, the German car manufacturer BMW 
uses its network of licensed dealers to sell cars to 
the market while also engaging in direct-to-con-
sumer communication (beyond dealer communi-
cations) through mass and direct advertising.
</p>
<p>Before the advent of the Internet, a direct sales 
channel between the marketing firm and the cus-
tomer was often too costly and/or arduous to 
implement. Direct interaction was limited mainly 
to trade fairs and test marketing; third-party 
agencies usually performed the various channel 
functions. Thus, the customer interacted with the 
marketing firm indirectly through the channels, 
which mediated their communication. Only in 
the case of B2B marketing did manufacturers 
</p>
<p>typically get to know the end users and interact 
directly with them.
</p>
<p>12.1.2  The Role of&nbsp;Channels 
in&nbsp;Customer Relationships
</p>
<p>Because channels are basically gatekeepers 
between the manufacturer and the end user, any 
channel must be managed and coordinated care-
fully to guarantee the effective reach and the 
attractiveness of the manufacturer&rsquo;s products 
(Coughlan et&nbsp;al., 2006). Various channel settings 
in any market likely include a diverse grouping of 
involved intermediaries and channel types. 
However, customer relationships can be created 
and maintained through various channel sys-
tems&mdash;as long as those channels are deployed and 
managed appropriately. This chapter notes the 
role of various channel types in the process of

<p>managing customer relationships and reveals the 
advantages and disadvantages of these different 
channel settings for CRM.
</p>
<p>12.1.3  Managing Customer 
Relationships Through 
Indirect Channels
</p>
<p>Indirect customer relationship management 
requires the use of an intermediary to manage the 
end-customer relationship indirectly. E.g., selling 
own products through supermarkets, the con-
sumer goods manufacturer Henkel uses indirect 
channels intensively and is therefore confronted 
with the task of managing customer relationships 
indirectly. Because different skill sets are required 
to manage different channels and customer seg-
ments, firms benefit from distribution efforts that 
pass through specialized intermediaries. 
Furthermore, setting up a new direct channel 
demands profound investments, which can be 
avoided by the use of intermediaries&rsquo; existing 
channel structures.
</p>
<p>In this setting, the CRM process also involves 
(indirect) gathering and processing of customer 
and sales or transaction information, whether by 
the channel member or the focal firm. Accordingly, 
the goals and interests of all involved channel 
members must be coordinated. The indirect cus-
tomer contact scenario means the focal firm lacks 
control over the intermediary&rsquo;s CRM activities. 
Thus, the focus of customer relationship manage-
ment in an indirect channel structure is typically 
on (1) building a good working relationship with 
the channel member and (2) providing incentives 
</p>
<p>for building strong relationships with end cus-
tomers.
</p>
<p>For example, incentives might encourage the 
channel member to gather and process sales and 
customer information and share this information 
with the marketing firm. Large consumer, nondu-
rable marketing firms, such as Henkel or Procter 
&amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), traditionally had significant 
power over their distribution channels and could 
thus control the channels&rsquo; activities to such an 
extent that the channels conformed absolutely to 
their customer relationship agenda. However, the 
arrival of private-label products on supermarket 
shelves and the increasing power of retail giants 
has meant that P&amp;G&rsquo;s ability to control retail CRM 
activities has greatly decreased (. Fig.&nbsp;12.5).
</p>
<p>The decision to deploy an indirect channel 
also involves the concrete choice of which channel 
type to use, such as selling the products through 
an intermediary&rsquo;s store or using an indirect web 
portal like Amazon.
</p>
<p> CRM and&nbsp;Indirect (Traditional)  
Offline Channels
</p>
<p>The indirect management of customer relation-
ships typically entails traditional, offline channels 
(i.e., stores, sales forces, catalogs). This tactic can 
enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty if its 
challenges are addressed effectively, and achieving 
loyalty creates an important asset for firms. Loyal 
customers are willing to pay higher prices than 
non-loyal customers, and they are more likely to 
recommend a firm, its products, and its services 
to other consumers (Wallace, Giese, &amp; Johnson, 
2004; Zeithaml, Berry, &amp; Parasuraman, 1996), 
resulting in greater customer value. However, as

</p>

</p>
<p>noted previously, these traditional indirect chan-
nel structures leave the relationship with the end 
customer solely in the hands of the intermediary, 
which creates several challenges for the focal firm.
</p>
<p>Dilution of&nbsp;CRM Strategies
</p>
<p>Traditional intermediary structures make contin-
uous, direct interactions with the end customer 
very difficult&mdash;if not impossible&mdash;such that it is 
no trivial task to build and nurture an effective 
customer relationship program. Firms must 
ensure that their CRM messages and offerings 
reach their target consumers, without dilution or 
digression. European retailers such as Carrefour, 
Dia, and Sainsbury&rsquo;s all sell high-quality, private-
label brands that compete directly with the estab-
lished brands of renowned manufacturers though. 
In a clear conflict of interest, private-label promo-
tions often diametrically oppose the customer 
relationship programs of the national brands car-
ried in the store.
</p>
<p>Indirect Control of&nbsp;CRM Through 
</p>
<p>Channels
</p>
<p>The primary methods of CRM implementation 
include direct control and monitoring at the 
channel level by manipulating the upstream rela-
tionship with the channel partners, through 
incentives for them, to manage the downstream 
relationship in a way that aligns with the firm&rsquo;s 
overall CRM.
</p>
<p>Eliciting Customer Information from&nbsp;All 
</p>
<p>Channels for&nbsp;Central Processing
</p>
<p>The lack of precise information about individual 
customers complicates the implementation of 
CRM.&nbsp; Distribution channel partners often pro-
vide only an approximation of customer prefer-
ences, such that customers remain largely 
anonymous to the firm, and the firm&rsquo;s offers rep-
resent merely estimations of customers&rsquo; tastes and 
preferences. Effective CRM therefore needs cus-
tomer information from different contact chan-
nels that gets centrally processed to provide 
critical input to the planning and execution of the 
physical distribution of goods. Because retailers 
compete with one another, it is difficult for firms 
to convince them to share critical sales informa-
tion for central processing. Therefore, sophisti-
cated information systems appear to be the key to 
the implementation of any CRM program.
</p>
<p>Thus distribution through indirect offline 
channels may reduce basic channel investments, 
but it also requires enormous intrachannel coor-
dination efforts to secure adequate customer rela-
tionship management.
</p>
<p> CRM and&nbsp;Indirect Online Channels
</p>
<p>Deploying an indirect online channel, e.g. distrib-
uting through Amazon, is a low-cost alternative 
that offers great coverage and can exploit existing 
channel structures. Online shopping also has 
been widely adopted due to the channel&rsquo;s continu-
ous availability and convenience for consumers 
(Sultan &amp; Rohm, 2004). Yet such channels also 
entail certain challenges, because their focus is 
often on price comparisons among suppliers 
instead of product quality. Through a customer 
self-selection process, indirect websites often 
attract non-loyal customers, searching for the 
cheapest offer. These customers are willing to 
switch supplier if the product/service of interest is 
offered at a lower price. Thus, indirect online 
channels are an efficient means to create product 
awareness and increase coverage but not to access 
customers with high potential customer value&mdash;
namely, loyal customers with promising long-
term profit potential.
</p>
<p>12.1.4  Managing Customer 
Relationships Through Direct 
Channels
</p>
<p>Traditionally, a direct channel between the firm 
and the consumer took the form of a communica-
tion or contact channel. Firms communicated 
product information directly to consumers 
through television and print, to persuade the con-
sumer to find the most readily accessible sales or 
distribution channel. Point-of-purchase advertis-
ing and promotions at the intermediary&rsquo;s outlet 
(e.g., retail store) further persuaded the consumer 
to purchase. However, consumer information 
moved indirectly to the firm through sales data.
</p>
<p>The advent of new, direct, electronic channels 
and the increasing trend toward opening dedi-
cated shops make two-way direct communication 
increasingly possible, such that firms can collect 
customer data through direct channels, too. In 
2006 the international cosmetics brand Nivea 
opened its first company-owned store in Hamburg, 
</p>

</p>
<p>Germany, to get direct access to customer data and 
benefit from direct interactions with its end cus-
tomers.
</p>
<p>Although the implementation of a direct 
channel requires channel-specific investments 
and the development of channel-specific skills, 
the direct contact with the customer enables the 
firm to establish and maintain valuable customer 
relationships, based on first-hand knowledge. The 
direct customer contact also reduces the need for 
excessive intrachannel coordination efforts and 
grants the firm comprehensive control over its 
planned CRM activities.
</p>
<p>Combining all mentioned aspects, we derive 
the key advantages and disadvantages of manag-
ing customer relationships through direct chan-
nels in . Fig.&nbsp;12.6.
</p>
<p>Finally, the decision to deploy a direct channel 
involves a second step: which specific channel 
type to use, such as a firm-specific store or web-
site, as we discuss next.
</p>
<p> CRM and&nbsp;Direct Offline Channels
</p>
<p>To implement directly operated offline channels 
(e.g., sales force, dedicated shops), a firm incurs 
extremely high costs due to channel implementa-
tion and maintenance (e.g., employee training, 
technical endowments, implementation of infor-
mation systems). Nevertheless, traditional direct 
channels allow for personal and individual con-
tact and thus typically create more loyalty than 
other channels because of their ability to create 
social and economic bonds with the customer.
</p>
<p>The focus in these channels is typically on 
enhancing brand images or service quality per-
ceptions, not price, which further explains their 
ability to attract loyal customers. However, based 
on this argumentation, loyal customers could be 
</p>
<p>attracted by less costly mass media channels too, 
such as mail, if those channels provide brand-
related instead of simply price information 
(Bolton, Lemon, &amp; Verhoef, 2004; Verhoef &amp; 
Donkers, 2005). Because of the very high costs for 
many traditional channels, it is appealing for 
firms to switch to electronic channels and/or to 
develop customer self-service strategies to reduce 
their costs (Payne &amp; Frow, 2004).
</p>
<p>Through self-service offers for example, cus-
tomers might place their order for products, col-
lect the necessary pre- and/or post-sales 
information, and solve problems by themselves. 
Self-service is becoming more and more wide-
spread in various contexts; one quite prominent 
example appears in movie theaters that host point-
of-sale ticket kiosks. With these ticketing system 
kiosks, customers select a movie, choose their 
seating, process the payment, receive a printed 
ticket and a receipt, and, if applicable, have points 
credited to their loyalty program cards, without 
any assistance from a salesperson or service rep. 
Another familiar example has changed the face of 
retail banking, where less expensive self-service 
channels such as ATMs have helped reduce aver-
age transaction costs by nearly 15% since 1990 
(Myers, Pickersgill, &amp; Van Metre, 2004).
</p>
<p> CRM and&nbsp;Direct Online Channels
</p>
<p>The implementation of direct online channels, 
such as a manufacturer&rsquo;s website, has become 
quite common. These channels offer a low cost 
alternative and can achieve great coverage, which 
makes them a key route to value chain efficiencies 
(Sultan &amp; Rohm, 2004). Customers have adopted 
online channels nearly universally, due to their 
continuous availability and convenience (Sultan 
&amp; Rohm, 2004), so they have become great

</p>
<p>sources of precise customer information for firms. 
Detailed customer information, easily available 
through electronic channels, arms the marketer 
with a constantly updated ability to forecast the 
shopping behaviors and needs of individual cus-
tomers.
</p>
<p>However, questions persist about whether 
impersonal, online, relatively anonymous channels 
can really develop customer retention or loyalty. 
On the one hand, customer retention and loyalty 
should result whenever a channel avoids a price 
focus and supports social and economic bonds, cri-
teria that seem difficult to meet online. It is always 
easy for customers to compare prices across online 
sites, so firms must promise low prices to be able 
to compete. Thus, online channels inherently tend 
to induce a price focus, which leads to reduced 
customer loyalty (Ansari, Mela, &amp; Neslin, 2008; 
Sinha, 2000). On the other hand, unlike the offline 
environment, it is quite easy to create personalized 
marketing messages through the Internet, which 
can nurture social bonds with customers. Once a 
customer has learned how to find information on 
a firm&rsquo;s website, switching to a competitor also cre-
ates switching costs (Ansari et&nbsp; al., 2008; Chen &amp; 
Hitt, 2002; Reichheld &amp; Schefter, 2000). Moreover, 
the channel&rsquo;s convenience and flexibility often 
increases customer satisfaction that can encour-
age customer loyalty (Boehm, 2008; Srinivasan, 
Anderson, &amp; Ponnavolu, 2002). Thus it appears 
</p>
<p>perhaps more difficult but nevertheless possible 
to achieve loyalty through electronic channels&mdash;if 
they are used adequately.
</p>
<p>A current trend in electronic channels makes 
it even easier to collect data and personalize CRM 
efforts. The advent of Web 2.0, including its two-
way communication between the firm and the 
customer, proved to be an important and success-
ful tool for creating customer assets over time. 
Recent technological advances allow consumers 
to use the Internet interactively, which means 
firms can use the Internet not only to send infor-
mation to their customers but also to receive 
direct feedback from them. This possibility cre-
ates a more complex, fruitful dialogue with the 
customer base, including easy access to customer 
feedback and demand, and companies then can 
use this data to refine and improve their CRM 
strategies (Payne &amp; Frow, 2004).
</p>
<p>Generally speaking then, there exists no single 
best channel type; each channel choice entails cer-
tain advantages and disadvantages. A firm does 
not necessarily need to choose just one channel 
but can also combine different channels in a mul-
tichannel system, to benefit from various advan-
tages. Firms mostly combine online and offline 
channels in their multichannel system, though 
there are some differences with regard to the use 
of direct and indirect channels, as depicted in 
. Fig.&nbsp;12.7.

</p>
<p>To build and maintain their brands, firms like 
Apple choose to sell their products mainly 
through direct channels: their own stores, own 
websites, and by phone. This method creates 
exclusivity and builds customer relationships 
through the creation of brand equity. In contrast, 
firms such as Avis or Nivea try to achieve maxi-
mum coverage and brand awareness and thus 
implement far more channels, both indirect and 
direct (see . Fig.&nbsp;12.7), which obviously demands 
greater coordination effort.
</p>
<p>Overall, the choice of a distribution or mar-
keting channel (indirect/direct, online/offline, 
etc.) always involves a trade-off for the firm 
between certain advantages and disadvantages, 
such as the level of control, available CRM activi-
ties, costs, or market coverage. Using the preced-
ing analyses, . Table&nbsp; 12.1 summarizes the key 
issues (advantages/disadvantages) that character-
ize typical multichannel systems, from the firm&rsquo;s 
perspective.
</p>
<p>12.1.5  Multichannel Trends 
and&nbsp;CRM
</p>
<p>As illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp; 12.8, four major trends 
with regard to multichannel systems demand fur-
ther detailed discussion.
</p>
<p> Trend 1: The&nbsp;Proliferation of&nbsp;Direct 
Channels
</p>
<p>The ubiquitous presence of the Internet, and espe-
cially of new electronic channels in business and 
daily life has had a tremendous impact on firms&rsquo; 
channel options. Whether through a website, a 
mobile device, or sophisticated voice response 
systems, consumers take advantage of this great 
variety to seek information and transact directly 
with the firm. Computers, travel, books, music&mdash;
the list of products that customers are familiar 
with and even prefer to purchase electronically is 
getting longer. Firms thus have direct access to 
end customers and also can recognize, in every 
interaction, whether the customer has bought 
from them before. When the interaction occurs 
through a technology-enabled channel, the firm 
can record and store all relevant information 
about this customer, without having to negotiate 
with, provide incentives to, or train a third-party 
channel member, such as a retailer.
</p>
<p> Trend 2: Multichannel as&nbsp;the&nbsp;Norm
</p>
<p>Recent times have witnessed a virtual explosion in 
the number of media channels that seek consum-
ers&rsquo; attention; multichannel strategies become 
more and more attractive, because they can be 
adapted individually to fit customers, the firm&rsquo;s 
products, and its overall CRM strategy perfectly. 
Firms adopt more and more channels due to two 
effects:
</p>
<p>First, firms are actually pushed (push effect) 
toward a multichannel strategy by customers and 
competitors. Consumers continuously expand 
their experiences beyond traditional channels and 
thus are willing to use any given channel if it 
meets their service output demands. The growing 
number of channels also increases the possible 
combinations of service outputs. When he or she 
feels comfortable with these routes, the consumer 
expects all companies to be present in the pre-
ferred channels. The resulting push effect demands 
that firms comply with their customers&rsquo; prefer-
ences, to keep up with their competitors 
(Rosenbloom, 2007).
</p>
<p>Second, a continuous pull effect arises because 
a multichannel system provides potential 
improvements in terms of customer loyalty, sales 
growth, and efficiency. Channels differ in their 
attributes and thus the portfolio of service outputs 
(i.e., functions that reduce the end user&rsquo;s search, 
waiting time, storage, or other costs) they provide 
(Wallace et&nbsp; al., 2004). For example, . Fig.&nbsp; 12.9 
describes differences in the service outputs pro-
vided by a store, a catalog, and the Internet. Stores 
typically provide a good assortment to choose 
from and high levels of in-store (e.g., product 
demonstrations) and after-sales (e.g., product 
installation) service; the Internet instead offers 
great search convenience as it is possible to 
research and easily compare information across 
several suppliers quickly from home.
</p>
<p>A complementary set of service outputs 
offered through various channels is more likely to 
meet the demands of consumers than is a single 
channel, so a multichannel system should achieve 
greater customer satisfaction and increase loyalty 
(Blattberg, Kim, &amp; Neslin, 2008).
</p>
<p> Trend 3: Multichannel Shoppers
</p>
<p>In response to the continuing increases in existing 
media and distribution channels and the imple-
mentation of multichannel systems, modern cus-

</p>
<p>tomers tend to change their habit, i.e., to use one 
specific channel for purchase, as they derive dif-
fering benefits from different channels. Depending 
on the desired product and the time available for 
the purchase, a consumer will choose the most 
convenient distribution channel. Thus many cus-
tomers buy music online, because haptics do not 
provide any additional benefit for purchasing. The 
same consumers may prefer to purchase a sweat-
shirt in a store though, to be able to touch the 
material and try on the item before buying it.
</p>
<p>Customers who buy in more than one channel 
within a specific period of time are multichannel 
shoppers, and they are very attractive to selling 
firms, because they typically shop more frequently 
and spend more money&mdash;20% to 30% more on 
average&mdash;than single-channel shoppers (Kumar 
&amp; Venkatesan, 2005; Myers et&nbsp;al., 2004; Thomas &amp; 
Sullivan, 2005; Venkatesan, Kumar, &amp; Ravishanker, 
2007). The drivers of multichannel shopping and 
managing these types of shoppers are critical fac-
tors for firm success, as discussed in more detail 
in 7 Sect. 12.3.2.
</p>
<p> Trend 4: Research Shoppers
</p>
<p>With the proliferation of direct channels, multi-
channel systems become more and more attrac-
tive for consumers, who can easily pick the most 
convenient channel for purchase or to find infor-
mation. In an emerging phenomenon, half of all 
consumers research the product in one channel 
(e.g., Internet), but purchase it in another channel 
(e.g., store). Such &laquo;research shopping&raquo; constitutes 
a massive challenge for the firm, namely, not los-
ing the customer in the course of his or her shop-
ping process (Nunes &amp; Cespedes, 2003).
</p>
<p>Each channel seeks to attract different con-
sumers and obtains only limited attention from 
the firm&rsquo;s overall customer base. The emergence of 
new channels leads consumers to change their 
channel habits though, to derive the new and dif-
fering benefits across the different stages of their 
buying processes. For example, one consumer 
might search the Web for the best price quotes to 
be better informed about prices and negotiate a 
better deal. But for various reasons (e.g., uncer-
tainty about the security and privacy of web trans-
actions, perceived risk regarding the quality of 
web-based offers), the same consumer might plan 
eventually to purchase from a local retailer. In the 
vacation industry for example, 30% of consumers 
use one channel for search and a different channel 
</p>
<p>for purchase (Verhoef et&nbsp;al., 2007). In this context, 
a firm must provide sufficient information on the 
web but also ensure it hosts a corresponding out-
let close by, to secure the deal.
</p>
<p>The emergence of more and more direct chan-
nels (trend 1), implemented by firms to achieve a 
multichannel system (trend 2), combined with 
the customers&rsquo; willingness to use these offers 
(trend 3 and 4), thus open a vast new range of 
opportunities for CRM activities.
</p>
<p> Opportunities Due&nbsp;to&nbsp;Multichannel 
Trends
</p>
<p>Widening Coverage of&nbsp;the&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>Consumer Population
</p>
<p>The most immediate impact of distribution chan-
nel and contact channel proliferation is the 
increase in coverage of the population of potential 
consumers by firms&rsquo; extensive channel networks. 
If people have more choice among different com-
munication and transaction channels, they will 
choose those channels that best fit their prefer-
ences and habits. Potential customers who previ-
ously did not buy because they lacked access to 
the firm&rsquo;s products through traditional channels 
now may consider buying. Thus the firm&rsquo;s poten-
tial customer base grows and for example includes 
busy executives who are hard pressed for time, 
who once would travel only to the nearest outlet 
to shop but now can use the Internet or mobile 
offers to obtain products from anywhere.
</p>
<p>Improved Availability of&nbsp;Customer 
</p>
<p>Information for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Firm
</p>
<p>Multiple channels open the floodgates to multiple 
sources of consumer and demand information. 
Companies now have essentially unlimited access to 
multiple sources of the same information, which 
allows them to verify and cross-validate the reliabil-
ity of longitudinal information. More important, 
they increasingly can turn to direct channels to 
reach customers. Through direct channels, firms 
acquire unfiltered information about individual 
customers&rsquo; preferences and needs, independent of 
any mediating dealer. The need to exchange cus-
tomer information across channels also makes cen-
tral customer databases imperative at the firm level, 
which means the firm gains additional leverage 
effects from interacting directly with end customers.
</p>
<p>Smart firms will leverage this information to 
produce detailed customer databases across chan-
</p>

<p/>

</p>
<p>nels and multiple shopping instances. Such data-
bases improve forecasting ability and understanding 
of the behavior and needs of individual customers. 
Moreover, customer identification in each channel 
makes it possible to customize marketing mixes 
(including products and services) for each cus-
tomer and opens up opportunities to sell comple-
mentary products&mdash;opportunities that competing 
firms may fail to recognize or be unable to offer.
</p>
<p>Less Dependence on&nbsp;Channel Partners
</p>
<p>Channel proliferation also increases the firm&rsquo;s 
power vis-&agrave;-vis its channel partners. Channel 
exclusivity no longer exists, and channel partners 
grow more dependent on the firm to ensure the 
cross-channel coordination of customer informa-
tion, marketing communications, and physical 
distribution. Different channels owned by differ-
ent agencies may compete for sales volume and 
margins, but they still must be coordinated to 
address customers who keep switching between 
them. Therefore firms&rsquo; CRM strategies cannot be 
overly channel-specific; rather, they should ensure 
uniform customer satisfaction across shopping 
instances and channels. That is, channel coordi-
nation is an essential ingredient of a multichannel 
strategy.
</p>
<p>Along with these opportunities, new chal-
lenges arise. Recent technological developments 
may promise a more effective CRM strategy, but 
they also add to the complexity of the task, as 
explained in the following.
</p>
<p> Challenges Due&nbsp;to&nbsp;Multichannel 
Trends
</p>
<p>Media Planning Is Increasingly Difficult
</p>
<p>As noted previously, the proliferation of channels 
changes customer behavior, including how cus-
tomers obtain information. The great expansion 
of channels creates strong competition for cus-
tomers&rsquo; attention, and a communication strategy 
that relies on fewer channels becomes a rather 
limiting choice. Companies face the challenge of 
integrating inbound and outbound approaches 
for communicating with customers, all of which is 
even more difficult in the face of shrinking bud-
gets, and an explosion of new technologies which 
enable new ways of customer interaction.
</p>
<p>In their media planning, firms must realize 
that different contact channels are proficient for 
different channel functions. Selecting a channel 
</p>
<p>that is appropriate for performing a particular 
marketing function entails recognizing not only 
the customer&rsquo;s contact channel preference and the 
amount of exposure to the customer, but also to 
the ability of the channel to deliver the service 
output that supports the particular marketing 
purpose. For example, though product demon-
strations at the International Consumer 
Electronics Show contribute significantly to prod-
uct awareness and understanding, actual transac-
tions may rather be achieved through the Internet 
or retail outlets.
</p>
<p>Channel Conflict and&nbsp;Differentiation
</p>
<p>Companies can not only communicate through 
e-mail, the web, wireless, mobile devices, sales 
forces, customer contact centers, and enterprise 
portals but also transact business with more con-
sumers through these various routes. Consumers 
in turn have started deriving different benefits 
from channels, which then adds to the complex-
ity and difficulty of effective CRM.&nbsp; Conflicts of 
interest may arise among different members of a 
distribution channel, which invariably attenuates 
the marketing efforts of the focal firm. 
Interchannel competition for share of wallet 
from the same customer increases the challenge 
of ensuring a seamless interchange of informa-
tion across channels, without harming channel 
members&rsquo; interests. The firm walks a tightrope, 
between meeting the conflicting interests of dif-
ferent channel partners and fulfilling its own 
objective to address the customer&rsquo;s needs, all 
while maintaining equity.
</p>
<p>But channel competition might not become as 
fierce as these dire predictions suggest. As chan-
nels grow more specialized, the implementation 
of CRM has become less vulnerable to channel 
conflict. For example, the Internet seems profi-
cient in prospecting for and attracting new cus-
tomers, rather than transacting. People may learn 
about the firm&rsquo;s offers through the Internet and 
make purchase decisions based on this informa-
tion, and many consumers still prefer to visit a 
local departmental store or showroom for the 
final transaction. By actively managing a portfolio 
of specialized channels (e.g., website for prospect-
ing, showroom for harvesting), the firm can nur-
ture its relationship with the customer while also 
rendering issues such as channel conflict less con-
tentious than what they would have been without 
channel specification (. Fig.&nbsp;12.10).

</p>
<p>12.2  CRM and&nbsp;Multichannel Design
</p>
<p>As already discussed, multichannel distribution 
and marketing is the norm today, rather than the 
exception, in virtually all industries. Moreover, 
one of the most challenging and important tasks a 
firm must undertake is the process of identifying, 
implementing (design decisions), and managing 
optimal channel systems (management decisions).
</p>
<p>Even when it is aware of the various advantages 
and disadvantages of different channel types, a 
firm still must make concrete decisions about 
which channel system to implement and which 
channels to combine, considering its own individ-
ual situation. In the following section, we discuss 
key decisions for the firm with regard to the design 
of a multichannel strategy (design attributes) and 
</p>
<p>the conditions in which different channel designs 
represent an efficient route to market (. Fig.&nbsp;12.11).
</p>
<p>12.2.1  Attributes of&nbsp;Multichannel 
Designs
</p>
<p>Three critical questions arise for a firm when 
deciding on channels to be implemented in its 
multichannel distribution or marketing system 
(. Fig.&nbsp;12.12):
</p>
<p> 5 How broad the offered variety of routes 
should be.
</p>
<p> 5 Which types of channels to implement and 
combine.
</p>
<p> 5 How intensively to use each route (i.e., store 
density).
</p>
<p>Opportunities Challenges
</p>
<p>1. Widening coverage of the consumer
</p>
<p>     population
</p>
<p>2. Improved customer information
</p>
<p>    for the firm
</p>
<p>3. Lower dependency on specific
</p>
<p>    channel partners
</p>
<p>1. Media planning becoming increasingly
</p>

<p>Great discrepancy exists between the firm&rsquo;s and 
customers&rsquo; idea of the optimal number of channels 
and channel intensity, i.e. the number of stores in 
which a product should be available.
</p>
<p>Using several different routes to market and/
or pursuing a strategy of intensive distribution 
means that a firm achieves high market coverage 
but also runs the risk of escalating intrabrand 
competition. Competition for potential end users 
causes pressure on the product price, which leads 
to diminished margins. Trying to compensate for 
the loss of profit, intermediaries tend to reduce 
their service output or even refuse to offer the 
product or service, which might damage the 
brand image and reduce the firm&rsquo;s market share. 
Therefore, a firm might prefer to use a limited 
variety of routes to the market and minimal inten-
sity to avoid unhealthy intrabrand competition. 
</p>
<p>But still the firm needs to challenge its competi-
tors, so it must obtain long-term customer satis-
faction.
</p>
<p>In contrast, customers prefer a broader variety 
of routes and intensive distribution, demanding 
wider availability (i.e., greater coverage), greater 
purchase convenience, and a wider range of ser-
vice outputs at the point of purchase (Jindal, 
Reinartz, Krafft, &amp; Hoyer, 2007). For the firm to 
challenge its competitors, it needs to meet these 
demands for service outputs to ensure long-term 
customer satisfaction and customer loyalty 
(. Fig.&nbsp;12.13).
</p>
<p>Another important issue pertains to the types 
of channels firms implement in their multichannel 
systems. As discussed in the previous section, 
each channel entails different levels of service out-
puts, so integrating different types of channels

<p>into a channel system, provides customers with 
access to a complementary mix of offerings. 
Because multiple channels meet more of their ser-
vice output needs, customers express more satis-
faction in multichannel settings, as well as more 
retailer loyalty (Wallace et&nbsp;al., 2004).
</p>
<p>12.2.2  Designing Optimal 
Multichannel Offers
</p>
<p>Now that we know which parameters must be modi-
fied to adapt a multichannel system, we need to 
develop a strategy that guides a manager when deter-
mining his or her own perfect channel strategy. In 
which conditions should specific types and number 
of channels, with which intensity, be implemented?
</p>
<p>Two main inputs determine the appropriate 
design of a multichannel system:
 1. The channel system should fit the firm&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>overall business strategy and environment.
 2. The combination of channels should maxi-
</p>
<p>mize synergies and minimize cannibalization.
</p>
<p> Fit Multichannel Systems 
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Business Strategy 
and&nbsp;Environmental Conditions
</p>
<p>Multichannel systems are most successful, in 
terms of their contribution to a firm&rsquo;s perfor-
mance, if their structure aligns perfectly with the 
firm&rsquo;s business strategy and its surrounding envi-
ronmental conditions (Kabadayi, Eyuboglu, &amp; 
Thomas, 2007). In this case, environmental condi-
tions refer to the:
</p>
<p> 5 Level of available resources (needed for 
innovation and differentiation).
</p>
<p> 5 Complexity of an environment (i.e., number 
and diversity of competitors and buyers).
</p>
<p> 5 Dynamism in the environment (i.e., fre-
quency of environmental changes).
</p>
<p>A business strategy instead refers to the manner in 
which firms compete in a specific industry or 
market. A firm can develop a competitive advan-
tage through:
</p>
<p> 5 A differentiation strategy.
 5 A cost-leadership strategy (Kabadayi et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2007).
</p>
<p>Overall then, there is no single best distribution 
or communication strategy that a firm can apply 
</p>
<p>successfully, which seems quite intuitive. The 
multichannel system Apple has adopted (focus on 
direct channels) thus would not fit Henkel (focus 
on indirect channels), because while Apple oper-
ates in a technologically turbulent environment, 
thriving due to its prompt responses to environ-
mental changes and ability to differentiate itself 
from competitors, Henkel works in a rather stable 
environment and aims to achieve greater market 
coverage. Thus, their multichannel systems fit 
both their business strategies and their environ-
mental conditions.
</p>
<p>If the environment is dynamic and complex, 
the firm needs to be extremely flexible and react 
quickly to unexpected environmental changes. 
This ability to react properly to environmental 
changes demands a greater number of more spe-
cialized channels (Anderson, 1985; Kabadayi 
et&nbsp;al., 2007; Moriarty &amp; Moran, 1990). In this case, 
firms that pursue a differentiation strategy and 
have sufficient resources available should distrib-
ute through a large number of mostly direct chan-
nels&mdash;as exemplified by Apple, the second-biggest 
company in the world by market value (Satariano, 
2010). With its sales of consumer electronics, 
computer software, and personal computers, 
Apple functions in a competitive (complex) and 
technologically turbulent (dynamic) environ-
ment. Its multichannel system incorporates a 
mixture of many direct and selected indirect 
channel types, which guarantees distribution 
through specialized dealers, and is in line with the 
firm&rsquo;s differentiation strategy.
</p>
<p>In contrast, a firm that can predict customer 
demands and raw material requirements accu-
rately in stable and less complex environments 
can pursue a cost-leadership strategy, i.e. keep its 
costs at a minimum using a limited number of 
mostly indirect channels (Kabadayi et&nbsp;al., 2007). 
One successful example is Sara Lee, a global con-
sumer goods company that operates in more than 
40 countries. Focusing on distribution through a 
limited variety of indirect channels (mostly retail 
stores) in a stable environment, it is possible to 
keep costs at a minimum while achieving great 
market coverage.
</p>
<p>. Figures&nbsp;12.14 and 12.15 depict two extreme 
environmental and strategic conditions, though 
in truth, there is a continuum of conditions, in 
between which lies the ideal distribution strategy, 
though finding it may be a challenge. Firms need 
to decide whether to implement more or fewer

<p>253 12
</p>
<p>indirect or direct channels, but also which chan-
nel types to implement. The combination of vari-
ous channel types requires care, as there exist 
both more and less harmonious sets of channels, 
as we discuss in the next section.
</p>
<p> Maximize Positive and&nbsp;Minimize 
Negative Cross-Channel Effects
</p>
<p>Decisions about implemented channel combina-
tions have huge impacts on the firm&rsquo;s performance. 
The use of multiple channels creates cross-effects 
among them, which can be either positive or nega-
tive, that is, synergetic or cannibalistic. Imagine, 
for example, that a telecommunication network 
provider observes that it acquires most customers 
through brick-and-mortar stores, but few custom-
ers sign contracts on its website. Should the pro-
vider reduce its online activities or shut down the 
online channel and focus on stores to maximize 
profits? This question cannot be answered by just 
looking at the number of customers acquired 
through each channel, because many potential 
customers likely search and inform themselves 
about different offers online before purchasing in a 
</p>
<p>store (Bakos, 1997; Morton, Zettelmeyer, &amp; Silva-
Risso, 2001; Verhoef et&nbsp; al., 2007)&mdash;that is, the 
research shopper phenomenon we discussed pre-
viously. Those shoppers prefer suppliers that offer 
a channel bundle that eases their search and pur-
chase process, because the set of channels is orga-
nized in such a way that they complete each other 
in terms of product and service provision. This 
scenario helps the customer identify a good deal 
while also creating &laquo;smart shopper feelings&raquo; from 
the psychological perspective, which reduces per-
ceived purchase uncertainty. These complemen-
tary channel bundles thus result in not only higher 
online acquisitions but also an increase in offline 
sales and loyalty, which represent positive cross-
channel effects (Bucklin, Ramaswamy, &amp; 
Majumdar, 1996; Wallace et&nbsp;al., 2004).
</p>
<p>In contrast, channels within a bundle that are 
concrete substitutes from a functional perspective 
(i.e., search and purchase functions are similar in 
both channels) may steal sales volume from each 
other, because customers find no additional value 
offered through the second channel and thus use 
one or the other. This negative cross-channel

</p>
<p>effect implies channel cannibalization: Increased 
returns in one channel lead to decreased returns 
in a very similar channel offered by the firm, 
because no additional benefit is being provided to 
customers.
</p>
<p>A firm that deploys a dedicated store channel 
thus may experience limited benefit from opening 
franchise stores, because searching and purchas-
ing in both channels is similar, from a customer&rsquo;s 
perspective. The firm might enjoy a basic increase 
in sales volume due to the greater market cover-
age by the franchise stores, but existing customers 
will be indifferent between purchasing in either 
store. Shifting sales volume from the dedicated 
store channel to the franchise store channel also 
leads to an increase in sales volume in the fran-
chise store but a decrease of sales volume, or can-
nibalization, in its own stores.
</p>
<p>This discussion highlights the dimensions to 
be considered when choosing a multichannel sys-
tem (i.e., appropriate types and number of chan-
nels). In summary, the two main prerequisites of a 
successful multichannel strategy implementation 
are:
</p>
<p> 5 Fit between the channel system and the firm&rsquo;s 
business strategy and environment.
</p>
<p> 5 A combination of complementary channels 
that achieves positive cross-channel effects.
</p>
<p>Having successfully composed a multichannel 
system, a new challenge now arises for the firm: 
managing the multichannel system, the various 
specific customer types and the integration of dif-
ferent channel offers and functions.
</p>
<p>12.3  CRM and&nbsp;Multichannel 
Management
</p>
<p>Existing multichannel systems must be managed 
properly to exploit all opportunities and handle 
the respective challenges. Having implemented a 
multichannel system, a firm needs to determine 
its degree of channel integration, i.e. the coordi-
nation of channel functions, which requires great 
effort but also offers the potential to increase the 
firm&rsquo;s attractiveness to customers (. Fig.&nbsp;12.16).
</p>
<p>As mentioned in the context of channel trends, 
the offer of multiple channels also attracts certain 
kinds of customers: multichannel and research 
shoppers. Both types have great potential for the 
firm&mdash;if it manages its multichannel system prop-
erly.
</p>
<p>12.3.1  Managing Multichannel 
Systems: Integration Versus 
Separation
</p>
<p>In a multichannel environment, it becomes chal-
lenging for the firm to achieve customer loyalty, 
because the possibility of comparing prices and 
offers across retailers through various channels 
decreases the customer&rsquo;s search costs but increases 
competition and price wars.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the customer&rsquo;s switching 
costs decrease, his or her motivation to switch 
increases, which implies decreasing customer loy-
alty. Of course, this threat does not mean that 
firms can just refrain from offering multiple chan-

</p>
<p>nels, but it does suggest that they should manage 
multichannel systems carefully (. Fig.&nbsp;12.17).
</p>
<p>A firm can handle this situation in two ways:
 1. Integrate channel functions to enhance 
</p>
<p>customer loyalty and long-term profits.
 2. Separate channel functions and differentiate 
</p>
<p>prices to increase short-term profits.
</p>
<p> Integrate Channel Functions 
to&nbsp;Enhance Customer Loyalty 
and&nbsp;Long-Term Profits
</p>
<p>Trying to improve CRM to enhance the custom-
er&rsquo;s retailer loyalty and bind that customer means 
a firm needs to make its overall multichannel offer 
valuable to the customer, instead of focusing on 
selected channels of its own portfolio. One possi-
ble means to achieve this overall appraisal of a 
complete channel system is the integration of 
functions across channels to enhance loyalty. For 
</p>
<p>example, H&amp;M, the Swedish fashion retailer, 
allows customers to return their online purchases 
in any stores. Besides, customers can try on 
clothes in the store and purchase those items later 
online, for the same price.
</p>
<p>Combining the service outputs of comple-
mentary channels thus increases customer value 
for the firm, because customer satisfaction 
increases, and with it, loyalty (Wallace et&nbsp; al., 
2004). The firm also gains access to more cus-
tomer data through a wider set of channels, which 
makes it easier to derive further lessons from the 
recorded customer behavior. Of course, the inte-
gration of channel functions requires extensive 
coordination efforts, which increase with the 
number of integrated channels included in the 
multichannel system. In addition, the supplier 
must unify prices across channels to allow for 
channel integration (. Fig.&nbsp;12.18).

</p>
<p> Separate Channel Functions 
and&nbsp;Differentiate Prices to&nbsp;Increase 
Short-Term Profits
</p>
<p>The opposite of channel integration is a channel 
mix, which involves various independent chan-
nels combined in a multichannel offer which is 
less expensive with regard to channel implemen-
tation and maintenance tactic. Each channel pro-
vides a certain package of services, attracting 
different types of customers in different situations 
instead of making existing customers more valu-
able for the firm. This strategy harms long-term 
customer loyalty, and as the channels cannot be 
combined, a self-selection process arises. Different 
customers use different channels. Therefore, the 
firm can charge different prices across its channels 
to skim the market most efficiently. If managed 
successfully, between-channel price differentia-
tion can increase short-term profits; Avis, the car 
rental agency, successfully charges different prices 
online and in branch offices for the same car.
</p>
<p>To ensure cross-channel price differentiation 
does not confuse or irritate customers, but rather 
increase the firm&rsquo;s profits, certain fundamental 
success factors need to be considered:
</p>
<p> 5 Price differentiation will succeed if online 
competition is low: The Internet is an easy 
and transparent means to compare prices. In 
this channel, the motivation to compare 
prices is high, and switching costs are quite 
low, so the likelihood of customers switching 
to competitors is great.
</p>
<p> 5 Price differentiation is profitable if the 
number of offered channels is low: The 
greater the number of channels implemented 
by a firm, the more complex and costly is 
their coordination (price differentiation) in a 
multichannel system.
</p>
<p> 5 Price differentiation is especially successful 
for one-time products: If a product can be 
resold, the selling firm faces competition not 
only from other retailers but also from its 
own customers. If it is possible to resell a 
product to other consumers for a cheaper 
price, a price differentiation strategy will fail.
</p>
<p>Overall, nondurable products and services are 
less appropriate for resale and less subject to 
online price comparisons, so price differentiation 
is a more promising means for increasing short-
term profits in a channel system with a limited 
number of channel types (Wolk &amp; Ebling, 2010) 
(. Fig.&nbsp;12.19).
</p>
<p>12.3.2  Managing Multichannel 
Shoppers
</p>
<p>Offering multiple channels for purchase and 
information attracts shoppers who are willing to 
use various channel types and choose different 
channels for transactions in various situations. 
These so-called multichannel shoppers tend to be 
more profitable than single-channel shoppers. 
</p>
<p>Advantages of Channel Separation Disadvantages of Channel
</p>
<p>Separation
</p>
<p>1. Lower channel coordination effort

<p>    (only for limited number of channel

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>257 12
</p>
<p>The potential explanations for this phenomenon 
all may apply to a certain extent, as the following 
sections detail.
</p>
<p> Multichannel Shoppers Are More 
Loyal than Single-Channel Shoppers
</p>
<p>Using various channels for transactions means 
that customers can achieve their service output 
demands more easily than if they only used a sin-
gle channel. In contrast with single-channel shop-
pers, multichannel shoppers choose the most 
appropriate and convenient channel for each 
transaction, using different channels for different 
transactions if it provides them with additional 
value. Single-channel shoppers instead repeatedly 
use the same channel for each step in the purchase 
process and ignore other channels. As a conse-
quence, they evaluate the firm&rsquo;s multichannel sys-
tem solely on the basis of this one channel, and if 
it does not meet their demands, they become dis-
satisfied and even may switch suppliers. Because 
multichannel shoppers consider all existing chan-
nels potential sites for their transactions, they take 
them all into account in their evaluations. If one 
channel does not meet the customer&rsquo;s service out-
put demands, she will just switch to a more 
appealing channel, instead of immediately switch-
ing suppliers.
</p>
<p>Imagine a multichannel shopper plans to 
order a product from a suppliers&rsquo; call center, but 
the telephone fee exceeds the level she is willing to 
pay. She then might be willing to switch to the 
same supplier&rsquo;s website to purchase the product. 
With their greater satisfaction with the firm&rsquo;s 
overall offer, multichannel customers tend to be 
quite loyal, with greater value than single-channel 
shoppers.
</p>
<p> Multichannel Shoppers Spend More 
Money Because They See 
Advertisements More Frequently 
than Single-Channel Shoppers
</p>
<p>Customers who consider each type of channel for 
their purchases actually receive advertising com-
munications in all types of channels as well. Thus, 
compared with single-channel shoppers, they 
confront the latest offers more frequently and are 
more likely to purchase a product, which makes 
them more prone to spend more money. Consider 
a single-channel shopper who only purchases in 
</p>
<p>physical stores. He may see advertisements in the 
stores but not the banner ads on the firm&rsquo;s web-
site. Multichannel shoppers check the website 
from time to time though, as well as the store to 
see the latest offers and may be more likely to pur-
chase.
</p>
<p> Multichannel Shoppers Purchase 
More Frequently than Single-Channel 
Shoppers Because Shopping Is 
Possible in&nbsp;Every Situation
</p>
<p>With their willingness to purchase in various 
types of channels, multichannel shoppers have 
access to offers, regardless of when or where they 
are, such that they may decide to purchase a prod-
uct spontaneously. These customers can purchase 
online late at night, use their mobile device to 
purchase while traveling by train, or just stop by a 
store when being downtown during the day.
</p>
<p>In contrast, single-channel shoppers wait until 
they have access to their channel of choice. If they 
prefer the store channel, their shopping is neces-
sarily less spontaneous, such that they make more 
deliberate purchase decisions. If they lack access 
to the product of interest at the moment they need 
it, they likely postpone their purchase intent or do 
not purchase, especially if an untimely purchase 
fails to provide value anymore.
</p>
<p> Only Customers Who Typically Shop 
Frequently and&nbsp;Spend Much Money 
Actually Use Multiple Channels 
for&nbsp;Purchase (Customer Self-
Selection)
</p>
<p>Another possible but contrary explanation for the 
profitability of multichannel customers reflects 
the idea of customer self-selection. In this case, it 
is not the multichannel offer that makes some 
customers more profitable, but rather, more prof-
itable heavy users of a product decide to purchase 
from various channels (Neslin et&nbsp;al., 2006).
</p>
<p>Regardless of which explanation is true&mdash;
whether multichannel offers make customers 
more valuable for a firm or if they just attract 
more valuable customers&mdash;it is obviously impor-
tant for firms to identify multichannel shoppers to 
increase their profits. The next section outlines 
key factors that drive multichannel shopping, 
which a firm must be aware of to manage its CRM 
efforts profitably.
</p>
<p>12.3 &middot; CRM and&nbsp;Multichannel Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>258
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p> Drivers of&nbsp;Multichannel Shopping
</p>
<p>Several factors determine the likelihood that a 
customer is a multichannel shopper (Venkatesan 
et&nbsp;al., 2007) (. Fig.&nbsp;12.20):
</p>
<p> 5 Customers who exhibit a higher degree of 
cross-buying typically use more channels to 
place their orders. Cross-buying refers to the 
number of different product categories that 
a customer has bought from the firm. We 
can reasonably expect customers who 
exhibit a high degree of cross-buying to be 
more familiar with the firm; this familiarity 
should reduce the perceived purchase risk 
and lead to a greater degree of multichannel 
shopping.
</p>
<p> 5 Customers who actively initiate contact with a 
firm also should have a higher degree of 
familiarity with the firm and its channels and 
exhibit a greater degree of multichannel 
shopping than customers whom the firm 
proactively contacts.
</p>
<p> 5 In addition, a higher level of web-based 
contacts plays a role in motivating customers 
to transact through multiple channels, 
because awareness of a supplier&rsquo;s website 
implies the customer&rsquo;s willingness to employ 
new technologies.
</p>
<p> 5 Customer tenure is positively associated with 
multichannel buying, due to the high level of 
familiarity with the firm and the firm&rsquo;s 
channels. Customers who have been transact-
ing with a firm for longer tend to use multiple 
channels more.
</p>
<p> 5 Also, customers who buy more frequently 
tend to migrate toward multichannel shop-
ping, because they want to improve the 
efficiency of their transactions by using the 
ideal channel for each transaction.
</p>
<p> 5 Finally, the number of channels that a firm 
uses to contact the customer is positively 
correlated with multichannel buying. In other 
words, firm-induced exposure to multiple 
channels leads customers to try multiple 
channel options.
</p>
<p>The key drivers of multichannel shopping thus 
consistently reflect the notions of familiarity and 
awareness. If a firm wants to enhance multichannel 
shopping by its customers, it should increase their 
awareness of all existing channels and their fea-
tures, as well as increase their familiarity with the 
firm and its channels to minimize their percep-
tions of the risk of using those channels for trans-
actions. Accordingly, a firm should actively employ

</p>
<p>12.3.3  Managing Research 
Shoppers
</p>
<p>Research shoppers benefit the firm by being loyal 
and enjoying their perception of themselves as 
smart, information-based shoppers. If the pre-
purchase information they gather applies to multi-
ple firms and is not supplier-specific though, a 
company faces a serious risk. It might invest in 
attracting the customer but then lose him or her 
during the purchasing process, especially if the cus-
tomer uses one firm&rsquo;s channel for search but 
another supplier&rsquo;s channel for purchase. Managing 
research shoppers thus requires profound knowl-
edge about the factors that explain research shop-
ping, to be able to attract and bind them to the firm.
</p>
<p>Prior literature suggests three factors that acti-
vate research-shopping: attribute-based decision-
making, lack of channel lock-in, and cross-channel 
synergy (Verhoef et&nbsp;al., 2007) (. Fig.&nbsp;12.21).
</p>
<p>As we have established, channels differ in their 
attributes and thus the service outputs they pro-
vide (Wallace et&nbsp;al., 2004) (e.g., an online channel 
offers great spatial convenience, whereas the store 
channel is typically famous for its high level of 
customer service). If a customer perceives some 
channels as especially convenient for search but 
other channels as preferable for transactions 
(attribute-based decision-making), the basic 
mechanism for research shopping is set. The 
Internet often appears as a convenient search 
channel, especially in terms of price and product 
comparisons, even across suppliers. However, 
</p>
<p>some customers still perceive the Internet as a 
risky channel for purchase and prefer to visit the 
store for the actual transaction. Research even 
shows that 43% of the existing research shoppers 
search for information online before making their 
final purchase at a brick-and-mortar retail store. 
In contrast, only 16% search for information in 
retail stores and then purchase from the Internet 
(. Fig.&nbsp;12.22).
</p>
<p>A second factor that enhances research shop-
ping is the lack of channel lock-in. If a channel has 
a high lock-in, searching in one channel increases 
the likelihood of purchasing in that channel. If it 
is easy to switch to another channel for purchase, 
then the channel lock-in is low, which encourages 
research shopping. For example, the channel 
lock-in of a website clearly is lower than that of a 
store, because switching to a different website is 
far easier than walking out of a store to purchase 
somewhere else.
</p>
<p>The third factor that enhances research shop-
ping is the existence of cross-channel synergy. If 
searching in one channel increases the economic 
benefit of purchasing in another, consumers tend 
to pursue research shopping. A consumer thus 
might gather price information online, which 
helps her negotiate a better price in the store later; 
such cross-channel synergies lead to research 
shopping (Verhoef et&nbsp;al., 2007). This phenomenon 
also appears in . Fig.&nbsp;12.22. This effect is rare in 
some channel combinations though; only 11% of 
customers search for information in a catalog and 
then purchase online, and only 6% search on the 
Internet and then purchase from a catalog. This 
channel combination obviously provides less 
additional benefit than the store&ndash;Internet combi-
nation.

enhance research shopping and reduce customer

</p>
<p>loss during the purchasing process. To encourage 
research shopping, a firm might reduce its chan-
nels&rsquo; functions to key attributes, emphasizing 
their search or purchase advantages compared 
with other channels. For example, a firm can 
offer an information-only website that is tightly 
integrated with the store (Bendoly, Blocher, 
Bretthauer, Krishnan, &amp; Venkataramanan, 2005). 
However, this approach can be risky in very 
competitive environments if competitors com-
bine all attributes into one channel (Neslin et&nbsp;al., 
2006).
</p>
<p>Moreover, to bind the customer to the store 
and prevent losing him or her during the purchas-
ing process, the firm needs to generate customer 
loyalty through customer satisfaction. Satisfaction 
with one channel reinforces satisfaction with 
other channels of the same supplier (Teerling &amp; 
</p>
<p>Huizingh, 2005). The more satisfied a customer is 
with a firm&rsquo;s channels, the greater that customer&rsquo;s 
loyalty and the lower the likelihood of losing the 
customer during the purchasing process. Greater 
loyalty also translates into greater sales volume, 
because loyal customers are willing to pay higher 
prices than non-loyal customers and also recom-
mend a firm, its products, and its services to other 
consumers (Wallace et&nbsp;al., 2004).
</p>
<p>The management of a multichannel sys-
tem thus confronts a firm with new challenges. 
Although these challenges, such as the coordina-
tion of various channel types, new customer types, 
and varying customer behaviors, requires addi-
tional management effort, their proper manage-
ment provides the chance for the firm to achieve 
greater profitability through enhanced customer 
satisfaction and loyalty.

</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>In the course of this chapter, we have 
</p>
<p>outlined the role of channels in creating and 
</p>
<p>maintaining customer relationships. We also 
</p>
<p>have discussed the role of channels as 
</p>
<p>gatekeepers for communication and interac-
</p>
<p>tion with the customer, which offers the 
</p>
<p>possibility of working on the relationship to 
</p>
<p>increase loyalty and customer value to the 
</p>
<p>firm. The channel further functions as a route 
</p>
<p>to market for products and services. With 
</p>
<p>regard to CRM, choosing the right channel is 
</p>
<p>a fundamental means for creating customer 
</p>
<p>loyalty, which increases the value of custom-
</p>
<p>ers to a firm and thus long-term profitability.
</p>
<p>Channel types can be divided basically, into 
</p>
<p>indirect and direct ones. Both types offer 
</p>
<p>various advantages and disadvantages for the 
</p>
<p>firm with respect to implementation and 
</p>
<p>maintenance costs, the need to develop 
</p>
<p>channel-specific skills, the guarantee of service 
</p>
<p>and information quality, and the level of 
</p>
<p>control over the intended CRM activities. These 
</p>
<p>factors should be evaluated carefully when 
</p>
<p>choosing channels for a firm&rsquo;s distribution 
</p>
<p>system.
</p>
<p>In this context, we also have presented 
</p>
<p>current channel trends, such as the prolifera-
</p>
<p>tion of direct channels and the emergence of 
</p>
<p>multichannel distribution as a new norm, 
</p>
<p>which have prompted customer-level trends, 
</p>
<p>including the arrival of multichannel shoppers 
</p>
<p>and research shoppers.
</p>
<p>Multichannel systems cannot work 
</p>
<p>efficiently if each decision about every channel 
</p>
<p>type implemented in the channel system 
</p>
<p>occurs independently. All channels imple-
</p>
<p>mented in a multichannel system must fit 
</p>
<p>together, align with the firm&rsquo;s business 
</p>
<p>strategy, and reflect the environmental 
</p>
<p>conditions.
</p>
<p>Having decided on the channel design, 
</p>
<p>including the types and numbers of channels 
</p>
<p>to be implemented in the multichannel 
</p>
<p>system, there is still one major challenge left 
</p>
<p>for the firm: the management of the channel 
</p>
<p>system to maximize profits. Should channel 
</p>
<p>functions and prices be integrated or sepa-
</p>
<p>rated? Determining the right level of multi-
</p>
<p>channel integration requires the firm to 
</p>
<p>evaluate whether it rather wants to work on its 
</p>
<p>customer relationships, which means greater 
</p>
<p>First, the company must 
</p>
<p>create a single view of the 
</p>
<p>customer. This task might sound 
</p>
<p>easy for a company that does not 
</p>
<p>sell through intermediaries, but it 
</p>
<p>is challenging in practice. The 
</p>
<p>operational and IT systems 
</p>
<p>behind each channel have very 
</p>
<p>specific characteristics, so it is not 
</p>
<p>straightforward to create a 
</p>
<p>meta-database that integrates the 
</p>
<p>entire multitude of customer 
</p>
<p>contacts in a standardized, 
</p>
<p>scalable fashion. Second, if it finds 
</p>
<p>a way to integrate information 
</p>
<p>seamlessly across several 
</p>
<p>channels, Otto needs to discover 
</p>
<p>how to leverage that information 
</p>
<p>to make better, more tailored 
</p>
<p>marketing decisions. For example, 
</p>
<p>a customer might receive a 
</p>
<p>catalog by mail and buy an item 
</p>
<p>of interest through the Internet 
</p>
<p>channel. In this case, did the 
</p>
<p>catalog really create the purchase 
</p>
<p>impulse, or would the customer 
</p>
<p>have bought even without the 
</p>
<p>catalog, via the Internet? Stated 
</p>
<p>differently, customers may not 
</p>
<p>appear to react to catalogs, but 
</p>
<p>the catalog still may have an 
</p>
<p>important trigger function. 
</p>
<p>Teasing out these channel interac-
</p>
<p>tions is important for Otto in its 
</p>
<p>quest to economize on its 
</p>
<p>acquisition cost while maximizing 
</p>
<p>its acquisition results. The reality 
</p>
<p>in a multichannel environment, 
</p>
<p>such as the one in use at Otto, is 
</p>
<p>an ongoing struggle to under-
</p>
<p>stand the interactions of contact 
</p>
<p>channels and contact channel 
</p>
<p>allocations to customers to 
</p>
<p>maximize customers&rsquo; lifetime 
</p>
<p>value.
</p>
<p> ? Questions on Minicase 12.1
 1. Can you think of experiments that would 
</p>
<p>allow Otto to make inferences about 
</p>
<p>whether one channel functions as a lead 
</p>
<p>in to another channel?
</p>
<p> 2. Would you expect customers who access 
</p>
<p>the company through different channels 
</p>
<p>to have differential values for the 
</p>
<p>company? Why?

</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. One relatively new form of cross-channel 
</p>
<p>management is a mobile click-and-collect 
</p>
<p>shop. It connects a retailer&rsquo;s online 
</p>
<p>channel with its offline channel. More 
</p>
<p>specifically, customers can order products 
</p>
<p>from the online or mobile shop and then 
</p>
<p>collect the ordered items at a physical 
</p>
<p>store. Accordingly, a click-and-collect shop 
</p>
<p>integrates the strengths of the online and 
</p>
<p>offline world: Customers can buy 
</p>
<p>anywhere at any time and benefit from a 
</p>
<p>good shopping experience inside the 
</p>
<p>physical stores (Beck &amp; Rygl, 2015). 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, online customers have 
</p>
<p>mixed feelings about click-and-collect 
</p>
<p>shops. Although online shoppers 
</p>
<p>worldwide are interested in click-and-
</p>
<p>collect, only few actually want to follow 
</p>
<p>through on it. According to a Deloitte 
</p>
<p>survey, in the U.K., 26% of shoppers would 
</p>
<p>like to use click-and-collect, but only 8% 
</p>
<p>currently do. In the U.S., 25% would like to 
</p>
<p>use it, but only 15% do. These differences 
</p>
<p>likely result from customers&rsquo; concerns that 
</p>
<p>retailers are not able to fulfill their 
</p>
<p>cross-channel order on click-and-collect. 
</p>
<p>For example, 32% of U.K. shoppers have 
</p>
<p>experienced long lines at pickup points. To 
</p>
<p>optimize the click-and-collect process, 
</p>
<p>retailers need to create dedicated store 
</p>
<p>sections for pickups and train their 
</p>
<p>employees on the floor to help customers. 
</p>
<p>Retailers should try to satisfy click-and-
</p>
<p>collect shoppers because they usually 
</p>
<p>spend more than regular shoppers do. By 
</p>
<p>browsing in store while waiting for their 
</p>
<p>order, click-and-collect shoppers offer 
</p>
<p>retailers opportunities for cross-selling 
</p>
<p>(Meola, 2016). A prominent company that 
</p>
<p>offers click-and-collect is Marks &amp; Spencer, 
</p>
<p>one of the U.K.&rsquo;s leading retailers.
</p>
<p> 2. In Tesco Homeplus launched its first virtual 
</p>
<p>store channel in South Korea in 2011. This 
</p>
<p>special channel is set up in public spaces, 
</p>
<p>such as subways and bus stops that exhibit 
</p>
<p>high foot traffic. Virtual displays of over 
</p>
<p>500 of the most popular products with QR 
</p>
<p>codes are printed on the walls of the 
</p>
<p>subway and bus stations. The displays&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>design resembles the actual aisles and 
</p>
<p>shelves of a regular Tesco store, making 
</p>
<p>the shopping experience very 
</p>
<p>user-friendly.
</p>
<p>This is how the virtual stores work: (1) 
</p>
<p>Interested customers download the Tesco 
</p>
<p>Homeplus app into their smartphones. (2) 
</p>
<p>They then use their smartphones to scan 
</p>
<p>the QR codes of the products they want to 
</p>
<p>purchase. (3) The scanned products are 
</p>
<p>stored in the customers&rsquo; online shopping 
</p>
<p>basket, who pay online once their order is 
</p>
<p>completed. (4) Customers schedule a time 
</p>
<p>for home delivery. Same-day delivery is 
</p>
<p>the norm, so that customers can get their 
</p>
<p>products by the time they get back home 
</p>
<p>from work.
</p>
<p>The virtual store channel has been a 
</p>
<p>huge success and resulted in over 900,000 
</p>
<p>app downloads in less than one year. This 
</p>
<p>makes the Tesco Homeplus app the most 
</p>
<p>popular shopping app in South Korea. 
</p>
<p>Since the introduction of the virtual stores, 
</p>
<p>sales in the online channel increased by 
</p>
<p>130% and the number of registered app 
</p>
<p>users increased by 76%. With this special 
</p>
<p>channel, Tesco Homeplus satisfies the very 
</p>
<p>specific needs of a large customer 
</p>
<p>segment&mdash;commuters who want to use 
</p>
<p>investments today and greater profits in the 
</p>
<p>long run, or if it prefers to reduce current costs 
</p>
<p>to attain short-term profits, at the expense of 
</p>
<p>building strong, long-term customer relation-
</p>
<p>ships.
</p>
<p>Finally, we have discussed how a firm 
</p>
<p>should manage multichannel shoppers and 
</p>
<p>research shoppers to maximize its profits. We 
</p>
<p>presented customer, channel, and environmen-
</p>
<p>tal conditions that activate these emerging 
</p>
<p>shopper types, which should help firms 
</p>
<p>identify these customers and thereby manage 
</p>
<p>them appropriately, so that the firm can profit 
</p>
<p>from their indisputable benefit potential.

</p>
<p>their little time efficiently&mdash;and thus 
</p>
<p>successfully complements its multichannel 
</p>
<p>strategy. Today, Tesco Homeplus offers 22 
</p>
<p>virtual stores in South Korea and is the 
</p>
<p>country&rsquo;s No. 1 online retailer (Petit de 
</p>
<p>Meurville, Pham, &amp; Trine, 2015).
</p>
<p> ? Exercise Questions
 1. Discuss, with regard to a firm&rsquo;s CRM 
</p>
<p>strategy, whether the proliferation of 
</p>
<p>direct channels is just a current trend or if 
</p>
<p>online channels will someday replace 
</p>
<p>traditional channels completely.
</p>
<p> 2. Obi, a German DIY supplier, initially sold 
</p>
<p>through franchise stores, but it just opened 
</p>
<p>an online shop in November 2010. The 
</p>
<p>implementation of this additional channel 
</p>
<p>resulted in an unhealthy conflict between 
</p>
<p>Obi and its franchisees, leading to a battle in 
</p>
<p>court. The focal issue was the cannibalization 
</p>
<p>by the website of sales in the franchise stores, 
</p>
<p>especially due to the low prices charged 
</p>
<p>online. Discuss Obi&rsquo;s multichannel design 
</p>
<p>and management. What went wrong?
</p>
<p> 3. Manufacturers such as Henkel or Procter &amp; 
</p>
<p>Gamble are very detached from end 
</p>
<p>customers. Given the increasing power of 
</p>
<p>retailers, how might they reestablish closer 
</p>
<p>contact with these ultimate customers?

<p>The IBM example in the preceding box shows that 
the sales force is an important and significant 
investment for most sellers, because it is entrusted 
with the seller&rsquo;s most important asset: customers. 
The sales force is in the unique position of being 
very close to the customer and thus having the 
</p>
<p>ability to establish long-lasting and strong rela-
tionships. Nearly half a company&rsquo;s growth can be 
ascribed to the competence, organization, and 
quality of its sales force (Karl&ouml;f &amp; L&ouml;vingsson, 
2005). Thus, sales force management (SFM) con-
stitutes one of the most important strategic issues 
in a B2B CRM context. Due to the decreasing 
marketing efficiency and effectiveness, as we 
noted at the start of this book, the task of the sales 
force is to effectively and efficiently manage rela-
tionships with the organization&rsquo;s buyers, to win 
over and maintain satisfied customers while keep-
ing costs down. The most important question in 
this context is thus how the sales force can manage 
buyer&ndash;seller relationships, both effectively and 
efficiently.
</p>
<p>To answer this question, we first discuss the 
construct of sales force automation (SFA) as an 
important subtopic of SFM within the B2B CRM 
</p>
<p>Overview
</p>
<p>Business marketers serve the largest market of 
</p>
<p>all: The dollar transaction volume in the 
</p>
<p>business-to- business (B2B) market is signifi-
</p>
<p>cantly greater than that in business-to-con-
</p>
<p>sumer (B2C) markets. Moreover, a B2B 
</p>
<p>customer&rsquo;s level of purchasing activity can be 
</p>
<p>extremely high (Hutt &amp; Speh, 2013). For 
</p>
<p>example, the purchasing department at IBM 
</p>
<p>spends more than $40 billion annually on B2B 
</p>
<p>products and services (Ferguson, 2006). Some of 
</p>
<p>the most valuable and powerful brands in the 
</p>
<p>world operate mainly in B2B markets, including, 
</p>
<p>for example, Cisco, DuPont, FedEx, Hewlett-
</p>
<p>Packard, IBM, and Intel (Hutt &amp; Speh, 2013).
</p>
<p>Unlike the B2C context, a customer in a 
</p>
<p>B2B environment is an organization (com-
</p>
<p>pany or institution), which means that there 
</p>
<p>are fewer customers. For example, Intel sells 
</p>
<p>its processors to a few large manufacturers, 
</p>
<p>such as, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, which 
</p>
<p>then sell to millions of computer buyers 
</p>
<p>(Hutt &amp; Speh, 2013). This implies that 
</p>
<p>business customers make much larger 
</p>
<p>purchases than households, and the organi-
</p>
<p>zational buying process is far more complex. 
</p>
<p>Finally, compared with B2C relationships, 
</p>
<p>relationships between buyers and sellers 
</p>
<p>tend to be closer (Buttle, 2009). In general, 
</p>
<p>relationships can be classified as transac-
</p>
<p>tional (distant) or collaborative (close). 
</p>
<p>Transactional relationships involve the timely 
</p>
<p>exchange of basic products for highly 
</p>
<p>competitive prices; collaborative relation-
</p>
<p>ships describe strong ties built over time, 
</p>
<p>with the intent of achieving mutual benefit 
</p>
<p>(Anderson &amp; Narus, 1991). In a B2B context 
</p>
<p>and in reference to the customer relationship 
</p>
<p>management (CRM) definition we introduced 
</p>
<p>at the beginning of this book, B2B CRM is the 
</p>
<p>strategic process of strengthening relation-
</p>
<p>ships with business customers, especially 
</p>
<p>important clients, beyond transactional 
</p>
<p>relationships to better manage the value of 
</p>
<p>these buyer&ndash;seller relationships. A report by 
</p>
<p>Stanford University and Accenture highlights 
</p>
<p>that companies can increase their market 
</p>
<p>capitalization by 8% or more and earn 
</p>
<p>premiums of 17&ndash;26% for their valuation, just 
</p>
<p>by introducing collaborative relationships 
</p>
<p>into their supply chains (Spekman &amp; 
</p>
<p>Carraway, 2006); to build such collaborative 
</p>
<p>relationships, a seller needs a deep under-
</p>
<p>standing of the buyer&rsquo;s internal business and 
</p>
<p>environment, and the communication 
</p>
<p>between partners should be linked to all 
</p>
<p>levels of management, to guarantee exten-
</p>
<p>sive information exchange.

 IBM: Identifying Customer-Contact Roles
</p>
<p>A number of IBM employees have contact with the

<p>customer organization when a particular customer is 
</p>
<p>served. For ensuring a consistent strategy execution, 
</p>
<p>IBM identifies customer-contact roles for each 
</p>
<p>customer (e.g., relationship owner, project owner, 
</p>
<p>and problem resolution owner), specifies the desired 
</p>
<p>measureable actions for each role, and finally 
</p>
<p>monitors the account&rsquo;s satisfaction with each role.

<p>domain. As a transactional tool, SFA describes 
any information technology applied to a sales 
situation that is intended to facilitate a repeti-
tive, administrative task and to make it more 
efficient, especially from the internal perspective 
of the seller. By completing tasks more effi-
ciently, salespeople can focus on more value-
adding activities for customers and thus increase 
customer satisfaction, leading to greater cus-
tomer retention. The effectiveness dimension 
describes SFA as a tool to build long-lasting rela-
tionships with customers. Because a company 
often needs to build this kind of relationship 
only with its most valuable, important clients, so 
called key accounts, we also acknowledge the 
main elements of key account management 
(KAM) in this chapter. With KAM, the firm allo-
cates the proper activities (from the buyer&rsquo;s, 
respectively external perspective) to the most 
promising customers (from the seller&rsquo;s perspec-
tive). Finally, we discuss the shift from goods to 
services, including the emergence of hybrid offer-
ings, as potential tactics for organizations to lock 
</p>
<p>in customers effectively. Hybrid offerings mainly 
focus on buyers&rsquo; demands and needs, which 
implies an external perspective. These three sub-
topics of SFM help companies build stronger 
buyer&ndash;seller relationships and  better manage the 
value of their relationships, from both internal 
and external perspectives. . Figure&nbsp;13.1 outlines 
the conceptual organization of this chapter 
accordingly.
</p>
<p>13.1  CRM and&nbsp;Sales Force 
Automation
</p>
<p>In the past two decades, SFA tools have been used 
increasingly to facilitate customer relationship 
management processes. Due to advanced tele-
communication devices, SFA has become more 
and more important, and the trend seems likely to 
continue in the future. We therefore begin by 
describing SFA and illustrating its benefits, as well 
as the most important conditions and prerequi-
sites facilitating them.

</p>
<p>13.1.1  What Is SFA?
</p>
<p>The term SFA refers to any information technol-
ogy applied to a sales situation with the goal of 
supporting the sales function. The variety of hard- 
and software capabilities in SFA technologies 
mean they can vary in terms of their complexity 
and the degree to which they should be integrated 
into the company&rsquo;s organizational infrastructure 
(Speier &amp; Venkatesh, 2002). Relevant technologies 
include, for example, electronic data interchange, 
databases, Internet, spreadsheets, sales forecasting 
tools, inventory management systems, contact 
management programs, e-mail programs, graphics 
and presentation software, laptops, cellular phones, 
and fax machines (Hunter &amp; Perreault, 2007).
</p>
<p>SFA tools are designed specifically to support the 
seller&rsquo;s organization in its efforts to meet its CRM 
objectives. A primary topic then is its impact on 
sales productivity. For example, SFA software 
capabilities can capture, store, analyze, and dis-
tribute customer-related data to salespeople to 
make them more efficient. By efficiently complet-
ing sales routine tasks, salespeople reallocate their 
time to more personal contacts with their cus-
tomers, which leads to more effective buyer&ndash;seller 
relationships (Hunter &amp; Perreault, 2007). It thus 
becomes evident that the two main dimensions of 
SFA&rsquo;s benefits are its efficiency and effectiveness 
(. Fig.&nbsp;13.2).
</p>
<p>13.1.2  SFA Benefits
</p>
<p>Salespeople, sales managers, and senior manage-
ment can derive a lot of benefits from implement-
ing SFA.&nbsp;With SFA tools, salespeople gain timely 
access to customer, product inventory, and market 
intelligence information and thus can respond to 
customer questions more quickly and with better 
information. The sales force appears more 
informed, knowledgeable, competent, and respon-
sive than its competing forces; it also enjoys a bet-
ter customer understanding. Customers perceive 
that their needs are better catered to and met, 
leading to improved customer relations through 
increasing customer satisfaction. Better process 
accuracy achieved through shorter order cycles, 
for example, might increase customer satisfaction 
and sales productivity, which in turn raises the 
benefits attained by sales managers (Rogers, Stone, 
&amp; Foss, 2008). The same pattern holds for 
improved resource allocation. By using SFA tools, 
the sales force can perform administrative tasks 
more efficiently and thus spend more time with 
the customer, engaging in value-adding activities 
that increase customer satisfaction and improve 
customer relations. Finally, SFA efficiency and 
effectiveness, including increased sales productiv-
ity and improved customer relations, lead to 
greater sales revenue for senior management and 
the firm as a whole. . Figure&nbsp; 13.3 summarizes 
how these different beneficial characteristics are 
linked and how they contribute to increased sales 
revenues.
</p>
<p>At this point, we also should mention that SFA 
can increase sales revenue only in certain condi-
tions, as we discuss in the next section.

</p>
<p>force actually adopts and uses the SFA technology. 
A failure in adopting or using these tools repre-
sents the biggest barrier to a firm&rsquo;s pursuit of the 
full range of SFA benefits. Important drivers that 
enhance SFA adoption include the commitment 
of both top management and immediate supervi-
sors to the technology. Both variables influence 
SFA adoption individually, whereas the salespeo-
ple&rsquo;s perceptions of the alignment between the 
two commitment variables (called management 
commitment alignment) influences SFA adoption 
even more. Therefore, any resources expended to 
reach such alignment condition are easily justifi-
able (Cascio, Mariadoss, &amp; Mouri, 2010). The 
likelihood of adoption also is positively influ-
enced by personal innovativeness (the extent to 
which a person is quick to adopt innovative ideas 
compared with others in the system), the per-
ceived usefulness of the new system (the extent to 
which a person believes use of the system will 
enhance his or her job performance), overall atti-
tude toward the new system, and compatibility 
with the existing system (the extent to which the 
new system fits with the adopter&rsquo;s existing values, 
experiences, and needs) (Jones, Sundaram, &amp; 
Chin, 2002). Moreover, the perceived usefulness 
of the new system and its compatibility with the 
</p>
<p>existing system are influenced by the salesperson&rsquo;s 
own individual characteristics. Individual percep-
tions of SFA technology tend to be more positive 
among younger employees, male employees, and 
employees who have strong computer self- 
efficacy, as well as those with more computer 
playfulness tendencies. Organizational character-
istics such as management support, perceived 
voluntariness of the use, and early involvement 
and participation of the user population also can 
have positive influences on individual perceptions 
of SFA technology (Speier &amp; Venkatesh, 2002).
</p>
<p>The adoption of SFA technology thus is 
strongly associated with its usage. The extent of 
SFA technology usage depends on personal inno-
vativeness, attitude toward the new system, and 
usage-facilitating conditions i.e. the extent to 
which a person believes she or he has been pro-
vided with sufficient resources and external sup-
port to use the system (Jones et&nbsp; al., 2002). 
Furthermore, the extent of use of SFA technology 
relates positively to a salesperson&rsquo;s degree of mar-
ket information processing (Park, Kim, Dubinsky, 
&amp; Lee, 2010).
</p>
<p>To guarantee the adoption and usage of SFA 
technology, the seller&rsquo;s organization should ensure

<p>of top management and supervisors and hire 
young salespeople who demonstrate, during the 
interview process, personal innovativeness, a high 
degree of computer playfulness, and computer 
self-efficacy. Furthermore, the firm should inform 
salespeople about the system&rsquo;s features and bene-
fits, provide continuous support and training, 
involve salespeople before purchasing and imple-
menting the SFA tools, and provide the sales force 
with all necessary market information. 
. Table&nbsp;13.1 summarizes these measures to ensure 
that the seller receives the full benefits of SFA.&nbsp;One 
important prerequisite for SFA adoption and 
usage certainly is that new SFA tools are integrally 
embedded into the legacy system or the legacy 
system can easily be replaced with new SFA tools.
</p>
<p>As it has been pointed out in this chapter, a seller 
can improve customer relations by implementing 
SFA.&nbsp;But we also must recognize that increased cus-
tomer satisfaction and improved customer relations 
are most critical for the most valuable customers of 
the seller&rsquo;s organization, which leads us to the topic 
of CRM and key account management.
</p>
<p>13.2  CRM and&nbsp;Key Account 
Management
</p>
<p>KAM is one of the most significant trends in B2B 
marketing practice in recent years. Pressures 
exerted on suppliers by increasing globalization, 
</p>
<p>customer power, procurement sophistication, 
complex offerings, and the need to find innovative 
ways to handle a company&rsquo;s most important cus-
tomers produced the concept of KAM, with its 
unique characteristics and steps for successful 
implementation.
</p>
<p>13.2.1  What Is KAM?
</p>
<p>A lot of different terms, such as key account sell-
ing, national account management, national 
account selling, strategic account management, 
and global account management, can be sub-
sumed under the term KAM.&nbsp;Today, key account 
management is the most widely used term in 
research publications (Homburg, Workman, &amp; 
Jensen, 2002). KAM refers to the performance of 
additional activities and/or dedication of special 
personnel to a company&rsquo;s most important cus-
tomers (Workman, Homburg, &amp; Jensen, 2003). 
Instead of being transaction-oriented, these addi-
tional activities are relationship-oriented and aim 
to create long-term customer relationships. 
Additional activities and special personnel offer 
critical benefits and opportunities for profit 
enhancement for the seller, along with the benefit 
enhancements for the buyer (McDonald, Millman, 
&amp; Rogers, 1997). Thus, for CRM in a B2B context, 
KAM is a highly relevant topic that cannot be 
ignored.

<p>13.2.2  Implementation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;KAM 
Program
</p>
<p>To implement a KAM program successfully, a 
company should follow three key steps:
 1. Selection of key accounts
 2. Design elements of the KAM program
 3. Advancement of the KAM program 
</p>
<p>(. Fig.&nbsp;13.4)
</p>
<p> Step 1: Selection of&nbsp;Key Accounts
</p>
<p>The essential step of selecting key accounts is cen-
tral to the definition of KAM (Workman et&nbsp; al., 
2003). Before carrying out the selection process, a 
company must select different criteria for distin-
guishing normal from more important customers 
(. Fig.&nbsp;13.5).
</p>
<p>Selection criteria
</p>
<p>In general, both quantitative (financial) and qual-
itative (strategic) criteria serve to decide which 
customer is a key account, and which are just 
regular accounts.
</p>
<p>The quantitative criteria might include:
 5 Sales volume
 5 Market share
 5 Revenues/contribution/profit
</p>
<p>Because financial data are quite easy to measure 
and can address fixed costs, most companies use 
certain financial &laquo;rules&raquo; as prime criteria for 
deciding on the key account status of their cus-
tomers (Winkelmann, 2013):
</p>
<p> 5 Key accounts must generate 50&ndash;60% of the 
sales volume.
</p>
<p> 5 The Pareto rule identifies key accounts as 
those 20% of customers that account for 80% 
of sales volume.
</p>
<p> 5 Key accounts are the top 10 customers.
</p>
<p>Yet there are also qualitative criteria to define key 
accounts; for example:
</p>
<p> 5 Image
 5 Reference potential
 5 Technology potential and know-how
 5 Interorganizational and cultural fit

</p>

</p>
<p>A positive image of the buyer might allow the 
seller to realize positive spillover effects onto its 
own image and brands. With a high reference 
potential, the key account can function as a mar-
ket multiplier for the seller by positively influenc-
ing other important buyers. Furthermore, a high 
technology potential and know-how in the buyer&rsquo;s 
organization can offer the seller additional knowl-
edge and thus might be useful for encouraging the 
development of the seller&rsquo;s organization. In these 
qualitative criteria, the focus thus is on long-term 
and interorganizational relationships, as well as on 
strategic aspects. . Table&nbsp; 13.2 summarizes the 
various (dis)advantages of different types of selec-
tion criteria.
</p>
<p>Because the buying process in B2B relation-
ships is rather complex, and the buyer&ndash;seller rela-
tionships seem closer, B2B marketers cannot only 
focus on quantitative facts but also need to con-
sider qualitative aspects associated with long- 
</p>
<p>term, interorganizational relationships when 
selecting their key accounts. A mix of quantitative 
and qualitative criteria allows companies to com-
bine the advantages and minimize the disadvan-
tages of these different measures.
</p>
<p>Selection process
</p>
<p>After having chosen the criteria, the company is 
ready to begin the selection process. A very prag-
matic approach first arranges a list of all selection 
criteria that are relevant for the company, which 
then need to be prioritized and weighted, from 
the seller&rsquo;s point of view. Next, the seller evaluates 
these different criteria for every potential key 
account. After the evaluation is multiplied by the 
corresponding weighting of the criterion, the 
seller can calculate the sum of all points. The 
higher the final score of a buyer, the more attrac-
tive that customer is in terms of key account  status 
(Capon, 2001) (. Table&nbsp;13.3).

</p>
<p> Step 2: Design Elements of the KAM 
Program
</p>
<p>In this section, we discuss the types of decisions 
the seller should take into account when design-
ing its key account program, namely, what is 
done, who does it, with whom it is done, and how 
formalized it is. That is, the elements that must be 
designed for a KAM program are activities, actors, 
resources, and formalization (. Fig.&nbsp;13.6).
</p>
<p>Activities refer to interorganizational (exter-
nal) elements, whereas actors, resources, and 
formalization describe intraorganizational (inter-
nal) elements of a KAM program. . Figure&nbsp;13.7 
depicts their relationships (the following illus-
trations refer to Homburg, Workman, &amp; Jensen, 
2000; Homburg et&nbsp; al., 2002; Workman et&nbsp; al., 
2003).
</p>
<p>Activities
</p>
<p>Regarding the marketing mix, suppliers can 
offer special activities for their key accounts, 
such as special pricing, product customization, 
joint coordination of the workflow, informa-
tion sharing, or taking over business processes 
outsourced by the customer. The intensity and 
proactiveness of these activities distinguish 
them from those offered to an average cus-
tomer. Intensity designates the extent to which 
additional activities get performed for the most 
important customers, while proactiveness refers 
to the extent to which the supplier initiates the 
activities. Proactive activities make the seller 
more flexible in designing activities that match 
its own interests and capabilities. Moreover, 
an intensive, proactive KAM shows the buyer 
that the supplier is willing to invest in the rela-
tionship, which should deepen trust in the key 
account and strengthen the buyer&ndash;seller rela-
tionship.
</p>
<p>Actors
</p>
<p>Special actors represent the personal coordina-
tion mode of KAM, which entails top manage-
ment involvement, the use of teams, and key 
account managers. Top management involvement 
is the extent to which a company&rsquo;s top manage-
ment actively participates in KAM.&nbsp;With senior- 
level involvement in KAM, the firm displays its 
commitment to key accounts, leading to greater 
involvement and a further strengthening of the 
buyer&ndash;seller relationship. However, key account 
managers remain the main point of contact for 
the key account. These managers need specific 
skills, including integrity, extensive product/ser-
vice knowledge, communication skills, selling 
and negotiating skills, and a deep understanding 
of the buying company&rsquo;s business and environ-
ment (McDonald et&nbsp;al., 1997). Thus, key account 
managers have to be trained exhaustively in order 
to fulfill these requirements. The use of teams can 
ensure a broader set of available skills. Dedicated 
teams that can coordinate the activities for key 
accounts preferably should be composed of mem-
bers from various functions and backgrounds, to

<p>guarantee access to different types of resources 
that can meet the buyer&rsquo;s needs. For example, the 
key account manager at SAP knows all the con-
tacts linked to each key account, so when new 
requests arise, the manager can compose a spe-
cial, task-related team and adjust existing struc-
tures to address the specific requirements (Belz, 
M&uuml;llner, &amp; Zupancic, 2004).
</p>
<p>Resources
</p>
<p>Successful KAM requires the coordination of 
activities within the organization. The esprit de 
corps of the selling center and access to (non)
marketing and (non)sales resources represent 
important assets for building strong, long-lasting 
buyer&ndash;seller relationships. Esprit de corps refers

</p>
<p>center feel linked to common goals and to other 
members. Access to (non)marketing and (non)
sales resources is the extent to which a key account 
manager obtains necessary contributions to KAM 
from (non)marketing and (non)sales groups. 
Only KAM coordinators with access to such nec-
essary resources can fulfill their organizations&rsquo; 
commitments and thus succeed in building strong 
relationships with buyers.
</p>
<p>Formalization
</p>
<p>Formalization refers to the extent to which key 
account handling has been formalized through 
rules and standard procedures established in the 
seller&rsquo;s organization. A high degree of formaliza-
tion leads to bureaucracy and a lack of flexibility in 
responding to the different needs of heterogeneous 
key accounts, which is rather unfavorable for 
establishing effective buyer&ndash;seller relationships.
</p>
<p>In all then, a proactive and intensive KAM, 
involving top management, cross-functional 
teams, and key account managers with special 
skills, as well as access to (non)marketing and 
(non)sales resources, plus a low degree of formal-
</p>
<p>ization can advance efforts to establish effective 
buyer&ndash;seller relationships.
</p>
<p> Step 3: Advancement of&nbsp;the&nbsp;KAM 
Program
</p>
<p>After having designed the key elements of a KAM 
program, the firm needs to advance its program 
by optimizing and continuously improving it 
(. Fig.&nbsp; 13.8). The following illustrations refer to 
Davies and Ryals (2009).
</p>
<p>Optimizing
</p>
<p>In the optimizing phase, the firm makes signifi-
cant financial investments to integrate the KAM 
program throughout the entire organization. All 
members gain an education in and become 
engaged with KAM, so the whole culture of the 
organization adopts a strong KAM orientation. 
Internal performance measurements fade away, 
replaced by benchmarking against competitors 
and reliance on customer feedback. The adaption 
of internal processes, policies, and IT systems is 
another primary element in this phase.
</p>
<p>Improvement
</p>
<p>During the continuous improvement phase, the 
company becomes increasingly focused and tar-
geted, with fewer and fewer key accounts. To reduce 
the use or waste of expensive resources, top man-
agement becomes less involved. The focus on cost 
management thus is a main element of this phase.
</p>
<p>KAM is never fully implemented but always 
can be described as an ongoing, continuous, very 
long-term commitment to improving among the 
best practice KAM companies.

<p>The example of Hilti&rsquo;s best practices in the preced-
ing box shows that additional services represent 
one method of offering the right activities for the 
right customers. Therefore, especially in B2B 
markets, the shift from goods to services is a com-
pelling possibility for establishing mutually bene-
ficial, long-term buyer&ndash;seller relationships.
</p>
<p>13.3  CRM and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Shift from&nbsp;Goods 
to&nbsp;Services
</p>
<p>Nowadays, many firms combine products with 
services to create innovative offerings, widely 
known as hybrid offerings, hybrid solutions, 
solution selling, or customer solutions. In so 
</p>
<p>doing, they hope to defend their positions in 
increasingly competitive product markets and 
increase revenues and cash flows. For example, 
Xerox sells not just the printers that initially 
made its name but also offers a consulting service 
to help customers publish their documents. 
These hybrid offerings can attract new customer 
segments and increase demand among existing 
customers by providing additional, superior 
value (Shankar, Berry, &amp; Dotzel, 2009), which 
increases customer loyalty and retention. We 
therefore describe a typology of services for 
hybrid offerings and illustrate the advantages and 
disadvantages of the shift from goods to services. 
In turn, we offer a set of rules for a successful 
shift.

 Oracle: Best Practice
</p>
<p>Oracle offers an integrated array 
</p>
<p>of applications, databases, servers, 
</p>
<p>storage, and cloud technologies to 
</p>
<p>empower modern business, with 
</p>
<p>more than 420,000 customers and 
</p>
<p>deployments in more than 145 
</p>
<p>countries. Companies of all sizes 
</p>
<p>rely on Oracle&rsquo;s complete, modern, 
</p>
<p>and secure portfolio of enterprise 
</p>
<p>and industry applications to con-
</p>
<p>nect the entire organization and 
</p>
<p>provide data-driven intelligence. 
</p>
<p>Oracle offers maximum person-
</p>
<p>alization and choice, including 
</p>
<p>applications for customer experi-
</p>
<p>ence, enterprise performance 
</p>
<p>management, enterprise resource 
</p>
<p>planning, human capital manage-
</p>
<p>ment, supply chain management, 
</p>
<p>and more.
</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2016, 
</p>
<p>Oracle launched Oracle Partner-
</p>
<p>Network (OPN) Cloud program to 
</p>
<p>support their partners acceler-
</p>
<p>ate innovation, lead business

<p>transformation and fully realize the 
</p>
<p>competitive advantages gained 
</p>
<p>through Oracle Cloud. The new 
</p>
<p>Cloud program, with tiered desig-
</p>
<p>nations, recognizes those partners 
</p>
<p>that engage with Oracle and invest 
</p>
<p>in Oracle Cloud, by offering them 
</p>
<p>incremental and progressive ben-
</p>
<p>efits to complement and build on 
</p>
<p>the existing OPN program levels. 
</p>
<p>Oracle shares assets with its part-

</p>
<p>13.3.1  What Are Hybrid Offerings?
</p>
<p>Hybrid offerings can be defined as a combination 
of &laquo;one or more goods and one or more services, 
creating more customer benefits than if the good 
and service were available separately&raquo; (Shankar, 
Berry, &amp; Dotzel, 2007). There are several types of 
services a seller can combine with physical goods 
to form hybrid offerings; the resultant classifica-
tion contains two dimensions. The first dimen-
sion refers to whether the service is directed at the 
supplier&rsquo;s good or the customer&rsquo;s process. The 
second pertains to whether the supplier&rsquo;s service 
value proposition is input-based, which implies it 
is grounded in the promise to perform a deed, or 
output-based, which means it promises to achieve 
certain performance. In combining these two 
dimensions, we can derive four categories 
(. Table&nbsp; 13.4) that fundamentally differ in the 
resources and capabilities needed to develop the 
hybrid offerings (Ulaga &amp; Reinartz, 2011).
</p>
<p> 5 Product Lifecycle Services (PLS): These 
input-based services are oriented toward the 
supplier&rsquo;s good. They facilitate the customer&rsquo;s 
access to the supplier&rsquo;s good and ensure its 
proper functioning throughout its lifecycle. 
For example, the installation of a high-voltage 
circuit breaker is a PLS.&nbsp;In this category, 
sellers cost-efficiently meet buyers&rsquo; basic 
expectations, using standardized services.
</p>
<p> 5 Asset Efficiency Services (AES): These 
services are also oriented toward the supplier&rsquo;s 
good, but they are output-based. AES are 
offered to achieve productivity gains from 
assets invested by customers, such as welding 
robot software customization. In moving from 
PLS to AES, firms commit to performance 
related to asset productivity, and shift from 
</p>
<p>cost- based to value-based pricing for their 
hybrid offerings.
</p>
<p> 5 Process Support Services (PSS): These services 
that are oriented toward the customer&rsquo;s 
processes are input-based. They help customers 
improve their own business processes, tailored 
to their specific contexts and needs. For 
example, a lot of industrial gases (e.g., hydrogen, 
oxygen) are regarded as pure commodities, but 
by understanding the application of the gases in 
the buyers&rsquo; processes (e.g., food conservation in 
a meat processing plant), the manufacturer can 
differentiate itself in the market.
</p>
<p> 5 Process Delegation Services (PDS): Finally, 
PDS are oriented toward the customer&rsquo;s 
processes and are output-based. These services 
perform processes on behalf of the customers, 
such as tire fleet management for a trucking 
company. The goods and services are integrated 
and individually customized. To guarantee this 
customization, there must be a high degree of 
interactivity in communication and exchange 
of information between the buyer and the seller. 
These characteristics reflect the high degree of 
complexity of these services.
</p>
<p>The promise for services is great, especially for 
PDS (widely regarded as &lsquo;solutions&rsquo;). BASF 
Coatings, a best practice example in the field of 
PDS, offers solutions for automotive manufactur-
ers and supports them in the painting process; 
thus it generates a transaction volume of &euro;2.3 bil-
lion annually (Ahlert &amp; Kawohl, 2008). However, 
approximately half of all solution sellers manage 
to realize only modest benefits and one-fourth 
actually lose money (Stanley &amp; Wojcik, 2005). The 
shift from goods to services is not a simple or 
innate process; it may pose certain challenges.

<p>13.3.2  Advantages and 
Disadvantages of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Shift 
to&nbsp;Hybrid Offerings
</p>
<p>In the B2B CRM context, the main benefit of 
extending products to hybrid offerings for a seller is 
increased buyer loyalty. Because hybrid offerings are 
more intangible to the customer, they are more dif-
ficult to evaluate, which decreases market transpar-
ency but increases the buyer&rsquo;s perceived purchase 
risk. Furthermore, greater interactivity in terms 
of communication and information exchanges 
between the buyer and seller that is required in 
service selling (compared to product selling), espe-
cially in PDS, should produce strong, collaborative 
relationships featuring higher degrees of trust and 
cooperation. Because the seller has developed an 
individually customized and integrated solution to 
solve the buyer&rsquo;s special problem, the seller becomes 
more important for the buyer, and the buyer 
becomes dependent or locked in to the relationship. 
As long as the buyer&rsquo;s needs and requirements are 
fulfilled, long-term and loyal relationships can be 
established via selling hybrid offerings, leading to 
an increase in customer lifetime value. Furthermore, 
the seller might leverage its resources and knowledge 
from product manufacturing to service manu-
facturing and thus realize synergies that offer cost 
savings and competitive differentiation advan-
tages in increasingly competitive product markets. 
These advantages refer to those illustrated in Fang, 
Palmatier, and Steenkamp (2008).
</p>
<p>But in the course of this shift, firms must con-
sider the prevalent potential for capability risk (the 
</p>
<p>mentioned disadvantages refer to those illustrated 
in Fang et&nbsp;al., 2008; Sawhney, Balasubramanian, &amp; 
Krishnan, 2004). The greater complexity of hybrid 
offerings (compared with pure product offer-
ings) may cause a seller to lose its strategic focus. 
The seller has to acquire a lot of organization&rsquo;s 
resources, capabilities, and competencies from 
different domains to develop suitable hybrid offer-
ings and meet a buyer&rsquo;s needs and requirements. In 
this confusing realm, a seller often fails to develop 
effective hybrid offerings, because it cannot opti-
mally allocate required resources across the differ-
ent domains or because its existing capabilities and 
organizational culture do not fit with the required 
offerings, leading to organizational conflict. This 
conflict usually harms employees&rsquo; motivation, 
effort, and productivity, which can decrease the 
ability to create value for the buyer. Because the 
margins of services also tend to be lower than 
those for products, sellers also face a financial risk 
in transitioning to services. Their intense efforts 
to gather resources and capabilities, as well as the 
high level of complexity make it difficult to increase 
these margins. Moreover, market risk is a key con-
cern; it describes the possibility that the buyer does 
not adopt the service, whether because it does not 
want to or is not able to do so. For example, if the 
interactivity in communication and exchange of 
information between the buyer and the seller fails, 
the developed hybrid offering may be ineffective 
and thus not valuable for the buyer, because it does 
not meet its requirements and needs. . Figure&nbsp;13.9 
summarizes these advantages and disadvantages 
of shifting an offer from goods to services.

</p>
<p>Managers should be well prepared to over-
come the possible disadvantages and keep in 
mind certain aspects that will help them build 
long-term relationships and realize the advan-
tages of increased customer loyalty and lifetime 
value, instead of the disadvantages. We thus 
offer some rules for a successful shift from 
goods to services, with reference to possible risk 
types.
</p>
<p>13.3.3  Rules for&nbsp;Successful Shifts
</p>
<p>In line with our discussion of the disadvantages of 
the shift from goods to services, the rules for suc-
cessful shifts aim to reduce or eliminate capability, 
financial, and market risks (. Fig.&nbsp;13.10).
</p>
<p>To reduce or eliminate capability risk, espe-
cially the loss of strategic focus and organizational 
conflicts, the seller has several options (Sawhney 
et&nbsp;al., 2004; Ulaga &amp; Reinartz, 2011):
</p>
<p> 5 Mandate a centralized administration of 
services, such as putting different services in 
one location or a separate organization.
</p>
<p> 5 Design services that build on existing product 
platforms.
</p>
<p> 5 Ensure access to resources, such as data about 
the installed base product usage and process, 
product development and manufacturing 
assets, sales forces and distribution networks, 
and a field service organization that build the 
required capabilities.
</p>
<p> 5 Leverage the partner organization&rsquo;s capabili-
ties by acquiring or partnering with a 
service- cultured company that has key 
resources, capabilities, and competencies.
</p>
<p>To reduce or eliminate the financial risk, the seller 
could, for example, (Sawhney et&nbsp;al., 2004; Shankar 
et&nbsp;al., 2009):
</p>
<p> 5 Identify the most profitable product/service 
and combine it with the most commonly 
bought product/service.
</p>
<p> 5 Use the Internet to link goods and services 
and thereby lower the total unit costs of the 
offering.
</p>
<p> 5 Find opportunities to balance the timing and 
magnitude of cash flows from products and 
services.
</p>
<p> 5 Perform robust, early, and frequent economic 
value analyses.
</p>
<p>Finally, to reduce or eliminate market risk, the 
seller should (Sawhney et&nbsp;al., 2004):
</p>
<p> 5 Create a service-savvy sales force.
 5 Offer trial periods, prototypes, and iterations.
 5 Blueprint according to customer specifica-
</p>
<p>tions.
 5 Focus on existing customers and processes 
</p>
<p>and meet their needs and requirements 
through effective hybrid offerings.
</p>
<p>In summary, we note three different types of 
risks&mdash;capability, financial, and market&mdash;that 
limit the advantages of hybrid offerings (i.e., 
increased customer loyalty and lifetime value), so 
the seller must reduce or eliminate these risks. For 
PDS in particular, few firms venture into this area, 
because of the very sophisticated capabilities 
required to achieve its benefits without suffering 
from its risks (Ulaga &amp; Reinartz, 2011). The fol-
lowing box offers a good conceptualization of 
solutions (or PDS) and their effectiveness.

</p>
<p>PDS: Effective Solutions
Tuli, Kohli, and Bharadwaj (2007) 
</p>
<p>define solutions as a set of buyer&ndash;
</p>
<p>seller relationship processes that 
</p>
<p>address buyers&rsquo; business needs. The 
</p>
<p>processes include:
</p>
<p> 5 Customer requirement defini-
tion
</p>
<p> 5 Customization and integration 
of industrial goods and/or 
</p>
<p>services
</p>
<p> 5 Their development
 5 Post-deployment customer 
</p>
<p>support.
</p>
<p>For the seller, the most impor-
</p>
<p>tant factor is guaranteeing that 
</p>
<p>a buyer adopts the solution and 
</p>
<p>to meet the buyer&rsquo;s needs and 
</p>
<p>requirements through the design 
</p>
<p>of effective solutions. Thus the 
</p>
<p>seller has to know which factors will 
</p>
<p>ensure the success or effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of a solution. Because of the need 
</p>
<p>for interactivity in communica-
</p>
<p>tion and information exchanges 
</p>
<p>between the buyer and the seller, 
</p>
<p>solution effectiveness depends on 
</p>
<p>specific supplier- and customer-
</p>
<p>related variables.
</p>
<p> Supplier Variables
</p>
<p> 5 Contingent hierarchy: Must be 
multiple and flexible, instead 
</p>
<p>of stable, to develop successful 
</p>
<p>solutions, because it ensures a 
</p>
<p>greater power balance across 
</p>
<p>the supplier&rsquo;s firm units/divi-
</p>
<p>sions.
</p>
<p> 5 Documentation emphasis: 
The degree to which supplier 
</p>
<p>employees are required to 
</p>
<p>document the purpose of the 
</p>
<p>solution, individual roles, work 
</p>
<p>performed, and outcomes; it 
</p>
<p>helps manage the complexity 
</p>
<p>of the solution&rsquo;s development 
</p>
<p>and guarantees that the post-
</p>
<p>deployment support team has 
</p>
<p>access to critical knowledge.
</p>
<p> 5 Incentive externality: Describes 
the extent to which employee 
</p>
<p>incentives are complementary 
</p>
<p>across units and divisions; 
</p>
<p>greater complementarity leads 
</p>
<p>to more effective development 
</p>
<p>and better postdeployment, as 
</p>
<p>well as more shared informa-
</p>
<p>tion across units.
</p>
<p> 5 Customer interactor stabil-
ity: The duration for which 
</p>
<p>salespeople and support staff, 
</p>
<p>or customer interactors, are 
</p>
<p>assigned to the customer; the 
</p>
<p>greater the stability, the stron-
</p>
<p>ger the relationship with the 
</p>
<p>customer and the better their 
</p>
<p>understanding of customers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>requirements.
</p>
<p> 5 Process articulation: The degree 
to which a supplier firm clearly 
</p>
<p>gives information about the 
</p>
<p>solution development process 
</p>
<p>to employees, such as rules for 
</p>
<p>specifying reporting structures, 
</p>
<p>sharing customer information, 
</p>
<p>and clarifying responsibilities; 
</p>
<p>offers a framework for interac-
</p>
<p>tion across units, functions, 
</p>
<p>and customers that can help 
</p>
<p>guarantee the correct definition 
</p>
<p>of customers&rsquo; requirements and 
</p>
<p>articulation of needs.
</p>
<p> Customer Variables
</p>
<p> 5 Customer adaptiveness: Refers 
to the extent to which the 
</p>
<p>customer is able and willing 
</p>
<p>to adapt internal routines and 
</p>
<p>processes to accommodate 
</p>
<p>the supplier&rsquo;s products and/
</p>
<p>or services; high customer 
</p>
<p>adaptiveness makes it easier to 
</p>
<p>customize and integrate a solu-
</p>
<p>tion, so the supplier firm can 
</p>
<p>work more effectively.
</p>
<p> 5 Political counseling: The degree 
to which a supplier receives 
</p>
<p>information and guidance 
</p>
<p>about the political landscape 
</p>
<p>facing the customer organiza-
</p>
<p>tion; through political counsel-
</p>
<p>ing, the supplier firm gains a 
</p>
<p>better understanding of the 
</p>
<p>varying priorities of different 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in the customer 
</p>
<p>firm, leading to a better 
</p>
<p>definition of the customer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>requirements, increased 
</p>
<p>customization and integration 
</p>
<p>of goods and/or services, and 
</p>
<p>more effective postdeploy-
</p>
<p>ment support.
</p>
<p> 5 Operational counseling: The 
degree to which a supplier 
</p>
<p>receives information about the 
</p>
<p>customer&rsquo;s operations, includ-
</p>
<p>ing details about the technical 
</p>
<p>system, business process, and 
</p>
<p>policies; the supplier firm can 
</p>
<p>define the customer&rsquo;s require-
</p>
<p>ments more completely and 
</p>
<p>accurately and can better cus-
</p>
<p>tomize and integrate a solution 
</p>
<p>with such information.
</p>
<p>Managers should be aware of 
</p>
<p>any changes and developments, 
</p>
<p>especially in the customer variables 
</p>
<p>involved in adopting particular 
</p>
<p>activities and practices.

<p>Summary
Over the course of this chapter, we have discussed 
</p>
<p>several CRM-related issues in the B2B context. We 
</p>
<p>first introduced SFA as a tool for efficiently and 
</p>
<p>effectively managing buyer&ndash;seller relationships by 
</p>
<p>increasing sales productivity and improving 
</p>
<p>customer relations, which should lead to increased 
</p>
<p>sales revenue. We also pointed out the conditions&mdash;
</p>
<p>namely, SFA adoption and usage by the sales 
</p>
<p>force&mdash;and measures that sales managers and 
</p>
<p>senior management can take to guarantee and 
</p>
<p>support the pursuit of the relevant benefits. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we noted the promise of KAM as a 
</p>
<p>means to allocate the right activities to the right 
</p>
<p>customers. The selection of key accounts, design 
</p>
<p>elements of the KAM program, and advancement of 
</p>
<p>the KAM program constitute three key steps for 
</p>
<p>successfully implementing a KAM program and real-
</p>
<p>izing its goal of creating long-term relationships 
</p>
<p>with the seller&rsquo;s most important and valuable 
</p>
<p>buyers. Finally, acknowledging its actual relevance 
</p>
<p>in B2B markets, we have illustrated the widespread 
</p>
<p> Chapter 13 &middot; CRM Issues in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Business-To-Business Context</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>shift from goods to services, respectively the shift to 
</p>
<p>hybrid offerings as a method to provide the right 
</p>
<p>activities to customers. In addition to defining 
</p>
<p>hybrid offerings and creating a typology of services 
</p>
<p>in hybrid offerings, we outlined the advantages and 
</p>
<p>disadvantages of this shift, as well as some rules for 
</p>
<p>avoiding the risks and realizing the advantages, 
</p>
<p>which in turn should lead to stronger buyer&ndash;seller 
</p>
<p>relationships. With this chapter, we therefore have 
</p>
<p>illustrated that with SFA, KAM, and hybrid offerings, 
</p>
<p>a seller can build strong, lasting, valuable buyer&ndash;
</p>
<p>seller relationships and better manage the value of 
</p>
<p>these relationships, which means it can achieve its 
</p>
<p>ultimate goals within a B2B CRM context.
</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. The global SFA solution of Infosys, a 
</p>
<p>global leader in technology services and 
</p>
<p>consulting, boosted sales force efficiency 
</p>
<p>and effectiveness in 116 countries for a 
</p>
<p>large logistics client that operated at a 
</p>
<p>country-level without global processes 
</p>
<p>or an IT road map. The challenges of 
</p>
<p>disconnected customer-facing processes 
</p>
<p>and information residing in disparate 
</p>
<p>systems arose due to rapid growth and 
</p>
<p>restructuring. However, to facilitate 
</p>
<p>effective selling, the sales and marketing 
</p>
<p>team needed visibility into opportunities 
</p>
<p>and potential customers in the global, 
</p>
<p>regional and country segments. That is, the 
</p>
<p>sales force required a SFA and marketing 
</p>
<p>system that would not only enable 
</p>
<p>to implement a new global sales and 
</p>
<p>marketing process and provide regional 
</p>
<p>language flavors but that would also be 
</p>
<p>rapidly available to users in all the countries 
</p>
<p>to realize time-to-market benefits. Infosys 
</p>
<p>helped the client consolidate its global 
</p>
<p>sales and marketing processes, and 
</p>
<p>developed an IT road map to provide 
</p>
<p>the best-in-class SFA for the global sales 
</p>
<p>application. Infosys&rsquo; single-instance 
</p>
<p>multi-lingual sales and marketing solution 
</p>
<p>supported the global processes and was 
</p>
<p>flexible to support local requirements. This 
</p>
<p>solution, currently available to over 8,500 
</p>
<p>users in 116 countries, has boosted sales 
</p>
<p>force efficiency and effectiveness through 
</p>
<p>improvements in pipeline management, 
</p>
<p>global cross- and up-selling, and insightful 
</p>
<p>analytics (Infosys, 2017).
</p>
<p> 2. DMG MORI Used Machines, the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>largest dealer in used CNC (Computerized 
</p>
<p>Numerical Control) machine tools from 
</p>
<p>Germany, delivers tailored solutions for 
</p>
<p>used machines. These solutions include, 
</p>
<p>for example, the complete refurbishment 
</p>
<p>of old machines, buying back old 
</p>
<p>machines, or simply exchanging an old 
</p>
<p>machine for a new, more powerful used 
</p>
<p>machine (DMG MORI, 2017).
</p>
<p> 3. To offer additional services, a company 
</p>
<p>requires comprehensive key account 
</p>
<p>management. The German market leader 
</p>
<p>in enterprise application software, SAP, 
</p>
<p>introduced SAP RealSpend, a tool for 
</p>
<p>the sales team to manage their budgets 
</p>
<p>actively. The app pulls data from core 
</p>
<p>financial reporting systems and thus 
</p>
<p>enables line managers to conduct ad hoc 
</p>
<p>spend analysis and other &laquo;on-the-fly&raquo; 
</p>
<p>calculations that allow live business 
</p>
<p>processing. Usually, line managers outside 
</p>
<p>the corporate finance function do not have 
</p>
<p>detailed insights into budget and spending. 
</p>
<p>Spreadsheets containing weeks-old data 
</p>
<p>and predefined reporting dimensions 
</p>
<p>from central controlling impede real-time 
</p>
<p>decision making amid changing business 
</p>
<p>conditions. SAP RealSpend integrates 
</p>
<p>actual, committed, approved and pending 
</p>
<p>spends into a holistic view on individual 
</p>
<p>dimensions (SAP, 2016).
</p>
<p> ? Exercise Questions
 1. Describe the benefits of SFA and their 
</p>
<p>linkages.
</p>
<p> 2. How can sales managers and senior 
</p>
<p>management support SFA adoption and 
</p>
<p>usage by employees?
</p>
<p> 3. What are the key steps to successfully 
</p>
<p>implementing a KAM program?
</p>
<p> 4. Explain the advantages and 
</p>
<p>disadvantages of the different criteria for 
</p>
<p>selecting key accounts.

<p>14.1  Customer Privacy Concerns
</p>
<p>14.1.1  Customer Privacy
</p>
<p>Definitions of privacy vary broadly depending on 
the setting and environmental factors. Especially in 
the context of CRM, the concept of customer pri-
vacy often has been merged with data protection, 
such that privacy represents a form of personal 
</p>
<p>information management (Roznowski, 2003). 
Customer privacy then can be defined as &laquo;the 
power of the individual to personally control (vis-
&agrave;-vis other individuals, groups, organizations, etc.) 
information about one&rsquo;s self,&raquo; which includes the 
collection, storage, usage, and release of personal 
information (Stone, Gueutal, Gardner, &amp; McClure, 
1983). If a company&rsquo;s CRM is to foster relationships 
with current customers and acquire new custom-
</p>
<p>Overview
</p>
<p>Companies increasingly collect and use data 
</p>
<p>about their current and potential customers to 
</p>
<p>improve their customer relationship manage-
</p>
<p>ment (CRM), sales, and service effectiveness. By 
</p>
<p>obtaining information on customers&rsquo; transac-
</p>
<p>tions and behaviors, as well as their socio-
</p>
<p>demographic profiles, companies can better 
</p>
<p>understand their customers&rsquo; preferences and 
</p>
<p>desires. Thus they build up customer intel-
</p>
<p>ligence to enable them to refine their strategic 
</p>
<p>marketing decision making and enhance 
</p>
<p>customer relationships, especially with their 
</p>
<p>most valuable customers. The value of such 
</p>
<p>customer information to companies is clear 
</p>
<p>from Facebook&rsquo;s market capitalization of over 
</p>
<p>$300 billion, largely because the online social 
</p>
<p>network site hosts customer profiles of more 
</p>
<p>than 1 billion active users (Statista, 2016). 
</p>
<p>However, companies are also finding a growing 
</p>
<p>reluctance among customers, who prefer not 
</p>
<p>to disclose their personal information or allow 
</p>
<p>tracking of their behaviors out of their 
</p>
<p>concerns for privacy (Wirtz &amp; Lwin, 2009). For 
</p>
<p>example, in 2011 Google aborted its online 
</p>
<p>mapping project Street View in Germany, 
</p>
<p>following massive protests from communities 
</p>
<p>and a media outrage. More than 240,000 
</p>
<p>households in 20 cities demanded pixelating 
</p>
<p>their addresses, German politicians called for 
</p>
<p>strict adherence to data protection regulations. 
</p>
<p>A more recent case is the transfer of user 
</p>
<p>telephone and contact data from the instant 
</p>
<p>messaging service WhatsApp to its parent 
</p>
<p>company Facebook. As soon as word of this 
</p>
<p>practice got out, downloads of WhatsApp rival 
</p>
<p>Threema skyrocketed in Europe. This is largely 
</p>
<p>attributed to the Swiss company&rsquo;s positioning 
</p>
<p>as a secure and data conscious alternative to 
</p>
<p>WhatsApp.
</p>
<p>Although especially pronounced in Europe, 
</p>
<p>privacy concerns and its consequences are 
</p>
<p>pervasive (Martin &amp; Murphy, 2016). In a 2015 
</p>
<p>study by data intelligence specialist GBG, up to 
</p>
<p>71% of consumers revealed to give incorrect 
</p>
<p>information when asked for private details by 
</p>
<p>companies (GBG, 2015). More than two out of 
</p>
<p>three state as a reason that they believed costs 
</p>
<p>of data disclosure outweigh the benefits. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, growing governmental regula-
</p>
<p>tions related to the gathering and use of 
</p>
<p>personal information are raising new obstacles 
</p>
<p>for companies. Accordingly, this chapter 
</p>
<p>outlines customer privacy concerns and their 
</p>
<p>respective implications for successful customer 
</p>
<p>relationship management.
</p>
<p>First, the chapter begins by presenting 
</p>
<p>trends and drivers related to customer privacy 
</p>
<p>concerns. Second, we discuss governmental 
</p>
<p>regulations in a cross-country comparison to 
</p>
<p>reflect the different prepositions that compa-
</p>
<p>nies face in different markets. Third, the 
</p>
<p>underlying psychological processes and 
</p>
<p>respective customer responses are identified 
</p>
<p>and summarized in a comprehensive concep-
</p>
<p>tual framework that indicates implications for 
</p>
<p>responsible privacy handling policies. We also 
</p>
<p>shed light on the privacy paradox, namely, the 
</p>
<p>relationship between consumers&rsquo; intention to 
</p>
<p>disclose personal information and their actual 
</p>
<p>personal information disclosure behaviors 
</p>
<p>(Norberg, Horne, &amp; Horne, 2007). Our overall 
</p>
<p>framework depicts the context of customer 
</p>
<p>privacy concerns and the respective conse-
</p>
<p>quences and implications for companies, as we 
</p>
<p>show in . Fig.&nbsp;14.1.

</p>
<p>ers, the firm must ensure a constant flow of up-to-
date information about customers&rsquo; buying habits 
and individual needs. However, if customers feel 
they are losing control over their personal informa-
tion, they will begin to feel concern about their 
privacy, which can lead to reluctance to disclose 
any further personal information. Control also 
plays a crucial role in the context of advertising 
effectiveness: The less control customers perceive 
to have over their private data, the lower is their 
acceptance of personalized ads such as online dis-
play banners (Tucker, 2014). These scenarios create 
serious obstacles for the efficiency of a company&rsquo;s 
CRM practices. Thus, it is crucial for companies to 
know how they can positively influence customers&rsquo; 
perceptions of the handling of their personal infor-
mation to reduce privacy concerns. For this pur-
pose, companies must pay attention to the factors 
that drive customers&rsquo; privacy concerns.
</p>
<p>14.1.2  Drivers of&nbsp;Customer Privacy 
Concerns
</p>
<p>Customer privacy is one of the most important 
management practice issues. When customers 
become concerned about their privacy, CRM pro-
cesses are especially affected, because they rely on a 
mutual exchange of information between the cus-
tomer and the company. In the past 15&nbsp;years, cus-
tomers have paid increasing attention to privacy 
issues as their perceived ability to control access to 
their personal information has eroded. Goldfarb 
and Tucker (2012) find that privacy concerns have 
been increasing for both younger and older con-
sumers, with this increase being more pronounced 
for the latter group. This development in custom-
ers&rsquo; privacy concerns can be attributed to different 
internal, company-related factors, as well as several 
external conditions we present in . Fig.&nbsp;14.2.

</p>
<p> Internal Drivers of&nbsp;Customer Privacy 
Concerns
</p>
<p>Customer privacy concerns arise from different 
sources, such as the way companies collect per-
sonal information (Collection), whether a customer 
can control the uses made of this information 
(Control), and the clear understanding of the com-
pany&rsquo;s conditions and practices with respect to 
privacy (Awareness). These primary dimensions 
determine the extent of customers&rsquo; privacy con-
cerns. Furthermore, customers&rsquo; privacy concerns 
can be fostered if they fear that information is not 
accurate (Errors) or is accessible (Improper Access) 
to unauthorized entities. Personal information 
used for reasons not authorized by the customer 
also can increase privacy concerns (Unauthorized 
Secondary Use) (Malhotra, Kim, &amp; Agarwal, 2004).
</p>
<p>Collection
</p>
<p>Collection can be defined as &laquo;the degree to which 
a person is concerned about the amount of indi-
vidual specific data possessed by others relative to 
the value of benefits received.&raquo; Thus, collection 
comprises customer concerns about the amount 
of and the way in which personal information is 
collected.
</p>
<p>Control
</p>
<p>Control refers to a person&rsquo;s degree of &laquo;control 
over personal information as manifested by the 
existence of voice (i.e., approval, modification) or 
</p>
<p>exit (i.e., opt-out)&raquo; (Malhotra et&nbsp; al., 2004). 
Customers&rsquo; control over their personal data is 
exercised through approval, modification, or the 
right to opt-out or opt-in.
</p>
<p>Awareness
</p>
<p>Awareness indicates an &laquo;understanding of estab-
lished conditions and actual practices&raquo; with 
respect to a company&rsquo;s information collection. 
Thus, awareness refers to the extent of transpar-
ency with which companies communicate the 
collection and usage of customer data.
</p>
<p>Errors
</p>
<p>Errors denote concerns that &laquo;protections against 
both deliberate and accidental errors in the data 
are not adequate&raquo; (Harris, Van Hoye, &amp; Lievens, 
2003).
</p>
<p>Improper Access
</p>
<p>Improper access relates to &laquo;concerns that data are 
readily available to parties not authorized to use 
it&raquo; (Harris et&nbsp;al., 2003).
</p>
<p>Unauthorized Secondary Use
</p>
<p>Unauthorized secondary use refers to &laquo;concerns 
that information collected by the organization for 
one purpose will be used by the same organiza-
tion for a different, unauthorized purposes (inter-
nal use) or given to another party for other 
purposes (external use)&raquo; (Harris et&nbsp;al., 2003).
</p>
<p>CRM at Work 14.1
In practical applications, companies 
</p>
<p>can gain insights into their customers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>privacy perception of data handling 
</p>
<p>and CRM practices through a 
</p>
<p>customer survey. For instance, in the 
</p>
<p>context of internet privacy Xu, Dinev, 
</p>
<p>Smith, and Hart (2011) developed 
</p>
<p>and tested a questionnaire to assess 
</p>
<p>perceived privacy concerns, risks, 
</p>
<p>control, and the credibility of the 
</p>
<p>privacy policy implemented by a 
</p>
<p>company. All the items we present 
</p>
<p>here can be measured on seven-point 
</p>
<p>scales anchored by &laquo;strongly 
</p>
<p>disagree&raquo; and &laquo;strongly agree.&raquo;
</p>
<p>Privacy Concerns
</p>
<p> 1. I am concerned that the 
</p>
<p>information I submit to this 
</p>
<p>company could be misused.
</p>
<p> 2. I am concerned that others can 
</p>
<p>find private information about 
</p>
<p>me from this company.
</p>
<p> 3. I am concerned about 
</p>
<p>providing personal informa-
</p>
<p>tion to this company, because 
</p>
<p>of what others might do 
</p>
<p>with&nbsp;it.
</p>
<p> 4. I am concerned about providing 
</p>
<p>personal information to this 
</p>
<p>company, because it could be 
</p>
<p>used in a way I did not foresee.
</p>
<p>Privacy Risks
</p>
<p> 1. In general, it would be risky to 
</p>
<p>give personal information to 
</p>
<p>this company.
</p>
<p> 2. There would be high potential 
</p>
<p>for privacy loss associated with 
</p>
<p>giving personal information to 
</p>
<p>this company.
</p>
<p> 3. Personal information could be 
</p>
<p>inappropriately used by this 
</p>
<p>company.
</p>
<p> 4. Providing this company with 
</p>
<p>my personal information would 
</p>
<p>involve many unexpected 
</p>
<p>problems.
</p>
<p>Privacy Control
</p>
<p> 1. I believe I have control over 
</p>
<p>who can get access to my 
</p>
<p>personal information collected 
</p>
<p>by this company.
</p>
<p> 2. I think I have control 
</p>
<p>over&nbsp;what&nbsp;personal informa-
</p>
<p>tion&nbsp;is released by this company.
</p>
<p> 3. I believe I have control 
</p>
<p>over&nbsp;how personal informa-
</p>
<p>tion&nbsp;is used by this company.
</p>
<p> 4. I believe I can control my 
</p>
<p>personal information provided 
</p>
<p>to this company.

</p>
<p> External Drivers of&nbsp;Customer Privacy 
Concerns
</p>
<p>Several key external drivers&mdash;namely, the Internet, 
technological advances, public media coverage, 
and governmental regulations&mdash;further foster 
customers&rsquo; privacy concerns. These drivers influ-
ence one another and ultimately increase custom-
ers&rsquo; concerns about their privacy.
</p>
<p>Internet
</p>
<p>In 2000, Bill Gates, the founder and chairman of 
Microsoft Corp., recognized that &laquo;In an era where 
the internet is increasingly central to our lives at 
work, at home and at school, it is more important 
than ever that our industry gives customers the 
assurance that their information will remain 
secure, respected and private&raquo; (Microsoft, 2000).
</p>
<p>Customer privacy has always been a signifi-
cant issue in marketing, but it has gained even 
more importance with the advent of the Internet. 
Correspondingly, research has found that cus-
tomers have grown even more alert to informa-
tion privacy issues online, compared with those 
associated with traditional media (Hoffman, 
Novak, &amp; Peralta, 1999).
</p>
<p>The online environment also offers new and 
different conditions for companies with respect to 
their data collection and data processing efforts 
(Rust, Kannan, &amp; Peng, 2002).
</p>
<p> 5 Customer data collection is rendered 
relatively cheap and easy to execute.
</p>
<p> 5 By means of cost-efficient data-mining 
processes, companies gain the opportunity to 
develop customer profiles, behavioral profiles, 
and insights for targeting and discriminating 
among their customers.
</p>
<p> 5 The network environment in which the data 
is collected and coded facilitates the combi-
nation of seemingly disparate customer data 
to create complex profiles of customers.
</p>
<p>As a result, customer data can be used efficiently 
and successfully to build and foster customer 
</p>
<p>relationships. Consider a recent example. The 
U.S.-based hotel group Denihan Hospitality 
brought together transactional and customer 
data, combining it with customer feedback com-
ments and reviews on rating websites to person-
alize their service. Staff across different hotel 
chains were equipped with smartphones which 
helped them anticipate the individual desires of 
a particular guest regarding meal choices, con-
cierge services, sightseeing trips or whether she 
is likely to call room service for refreshments 
in the middle of the night. However, especially 
in privacy conscious societies such extensive 
usage and re- combination of information may 
offset customers, despite its obvious benefits. 
Therefore, firms need to be particularly sensitive 
when using online data that has been attained 
somewhat covertly (Aguirre, Mahr, Grewel, 
Ruyter, &amp; Wetzels, 2015).  Customer privacy 
concerns are the top reason non-users still avoid 
the Internet.
</p>
<p>In an online setting, there are different ways to 
gather customer information:
</p>
<p> 5 Customers voluntarily enter personal 
information, such as their name, address, and 
credit card number, into databases.
</p>
<p> 5 Information on customers&rsquo; online behavior is 
collected using cookies and click-stream 
technology, which largely require more or less 
explicit consent (&laquo;opt-in&raquo; or &laquo;soft opt-in&raquo;) by 
now, depending on legislation.
</p>
<p>When browsing the web or making purchases 
online, customers must provide certain personal 
information to be able to gain access to content 
offerings or complete a purchase transaction. 
Thus, they face a trade-off between the advantages 
they receive from providing personal information 
(e.g., name, address, and credit card number) and 
their fear of the threats associated with sharing 
such sensitive information. It has even been 
argued that it is nearly impossible for customers 
to transact on the Internet without revealing 
</p>
<p>Effectiveness of&nbsp;Privacy Policy
</p>
<p> 1. I feel confident that this 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s privacy statements 
</p>
<p>reflect their commitments to 
</p>
<p>protect my personal information.
</p>
<p> 2. With their privacy statements, I 
</p>
<p>believe that my personal 
</p>
<p>information will be kept private 
</p>
<p>and confidential by this 
</p>
<p>company.
</p>
<p> 3. I believe that this company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>privacy statements are an 
</p>
<p>effective way to demonstrate 
</p>
<p>their commitments to privacy.

</p>
<p>information about themselves that they might be 
unwilling to share (Rust et&nbsp; al., 2002). Massive 
databases continue to record customers&rsquo; demo-
graphics and past purchase activities.
</p>
<p>But what raises customer privacy concerns 
even more is the usage of covertly obtained data, 
like tracking behavior across different websites or 
devices (Aguirre et&nbsp;al., 2015). The application of 
behavioral advertising&mdash;personalized advertis-
ing messages that are based on customers&rsquo; prior 
browsing behavior and online purchasing pat-
terns&mdash;serves as an example. Aguirre et&nbsp; al., 
(2015) show that personalization are beneficial in 
terms of click-throughs only when customers 
know which information the company collects. 
According to Bleier and Eisenbeiss (2015), the 
effectiveness of personalized advertising is con-
fined by the degree of trust when faced with pri-
vacy concerns. A customer survey by the Pew 
Research Center reveals that 86% of American 
Internet users take measures to prevent compa-
nies from tracking them online (Rainie, 2016). 
64% believe the government should do more to 
regulate advertisers. Yet, the rise of online social 
media websites, such as Instagram, Twitter, or 
Facebook, and mobile communication applica-
tions like WhatsApp and Snapchat, means that 
customers voluntarily share personal informa-
tion, giving advertisers detailed insights into 
their lives, which the companies then can use for 
customer segmentation and targeting (Kluth, 
2008). Furthermore, concerns about privacy can 
arise in relation to potential breaches of confi-
dential customer data. In July of 2015, the online 
adultery site Ashley Madison got hacked and 
blackmailed, with hackers revealing private data 
(credit card numbers, account details, contact 
information, transaction logs) of more than 37 
million users in 40 countries publicly on the 
internet (Bisson, 2015). Later that year, the 
password- cracking group CynoSure Prime 
announced to have successfully deciphered 11.2 
million Ashley Madison user passwords. In the 
aftermath of these hacks, website traffic dropped 
by more than 80%.
</p>
<p>In summary, the Internet often represents a 
threat to privacy and has the potential to under-
mine a company&rsquo;s marketing performance in the 
long or even in the short run. Thus, privacy con-
cerns raised by the Internet require a lot more 
attention by companies and their respective CRM 
departments.
</p>
<p>Technology
</p>
<p>Different technological innovations have made it 
easier for companies to gather, process, and use 
customer data to gain a competitive advantage, 
but they also have fostered customers&rsquo; privacy 
concerns. The main innovations driving this 
development are as follows:
</p>
<p> 5 Mobile and smart phones
 5 Location-based services
 5 Near-field communication (NFC) and radio 
</p>
<p>frequency identification technology (RFID)
</p>
<p>Mobile and smart phones have become steady 
companions in our daily lives. 95% of the global 
population have access to a mobile network, over 
84% with broadband (3G or higher) internet con-
nectivity (ICT, 2016). As a result, people have 
become comfortable using smartphones to engage 
in a variety of activities such as online shopping, 
news consumption, information sharing via social 
media, or mobile gaming. Many applications use 
GPS tracking to offer location-specific services.
</p>
<p>For example, the mobile dating app Happn 
shows the user interesting people that they cross 
paths with. When another Happn user comes 
within 250 meters, his or her profile pops up. 
Nintendo&rsquo;s Pokemon Go, the most rapidly dif-
fused mobile app of all time, uses augmented real-
ity to create its unique, locally adapted gaming 
experience. Beyond creating location-specific 
customer value, such technological innovations 
also provide companies with the opportunity to 
get in touch with customers and offer targeted 
advertising based on their location, such that the 
distinction between public and private space 
seems to be eroding. Customers can no longer 
depend on the intuitive sense that &laquo;If I can see 
you, you can see me too&raquo; but instead feel they are 
losing control over their personal information. 
Many applications require access to a large catalog 
of private information, amongst others the user&rsquo;s 
calendar, contact list, and GPS tracking data. 
7 Pleaserobme.com collected posts from Twitter 
that showed that the posters were somewhere 
other than home; this initiative attempted to draw 
attention to customers&rsquo; &laquo;oversharing&raquo; of personal 
information. Furthermore, the initiators wanted 
to inform people about potential risk associated 
with the use location-based services, such as 
criminals misusing customer information to rob 
empty houses (The Economist, 2010). They 
received notable attention for this effort. Although

</p>
<p>people pay increasing attention to data privacy 
(Goldfarb &amp; Tucker, 2012), these concerns do not 
seem to hinder the mass adoption of smartphones 
and intrusive mobile applications.
</p>
<p>Another technical innovation, NFC, is 
increasingly being applied in retail environments 
and thus fueling customers&rsquo; privacy concerns. 
NFC is not limited to enable smartphone pay-
ment, as already implemented on a growing scale, 
but to enhance the con-sumers&rsquo; shopping experi-
ence as well. For example, at the French super-
market chain &laquo;Casino&raquo;, consumers can use their 
smartphone to find out more about an item or add 
it to their shopping basket (Techworld, 2013). 
Stores can thereby track shopping routes and cre-
ate customer profiles to use during the subsequent 
shopping trip. This also makes way for personal-
ized couponing and advertising. Technologically 
different from NFC, but similar in its potential 
applications, is RFID.&nbsp;This item-tagging technol-
ogy is reliable and relatively inexpensive, does not 
require a power supply, and can be attached to 
nearly any item. When exposed to a radio signal, 
RFID tags send back information, mostly a long 
number that identifies the object to which they 
are attached. In a clothing store, customer choices 
for try-on can be tracked, creating a profile of 
their preferred brands, styles, colors. This infor-
mation can then be used to make recommenda-
tions and foster cross- and upselling (Nayak, 
Padhye, Wang, Chatterjee, &amp; Gupta, 2015).
</p>
<p>But this technology implies a risk of jeopar-
dizing customer privacy and reducing or elimi-
nating purchasing anonymity.
</p>
<p>Consider some examples of RFID-related 
threats (Garfinkel, Juels, &amp; Pappu, 2005):
</p>
<p> 5 Action threat: By embedding hidden RFID 
tags into or on objects and documents, 
companies are able to infer individual 
behavior, without the knowledge or consent 
of the individual engaging in the behavior. 
For example, in 2003 Walmart equipped 
cosmetic shelves in one of its stores in Broken 
Arrow, Oklahoma, with RFID technology to 
track Max Factor Lipfinity lipsticks being 
removed from shelves. Then Proctor &amp; 
Gamble researchers used video monitoring to 
observe customers&rsquo; behaviors after they 
picked up the lipstick. This major violation of 
customer privacy rights without prior 
consent became publicly known as the 
Broken Arrow Affair (Hildner, 2006).
</p>
<p> 5 Association threat: A customer&rsquo;s identity can 
be associated with the item&rsquo;s electronic serial 
number and, with rich data stored in back- 
end systems (e.g., from a loyalty program), 
lead to the creation of comprehensive 
customer profiles that reveal the customers&rsquo; 
brand or item preferences in a specific 
product category. In contrast to the use of 
loyalty cards, this type of association can be 
clandestine and even involuntary. Even if 
item-level information remains generic, 
identifying items people wear or carry could 
associate them with particular events or 
ideas, such as political rallies.
</p>
<p> 5 Location threat: If people carry unique tags 
attached to the items they purchase, they can 
be located even after they leave the retail 
store. This possibility also evokes the danger 
of unauthorized third-party disclosures.
</p>
<p>Technological innovations continue to provide 
companies with opportunities to gain customer 
information more easily and at a lower cost and 
thus better serve their customers and improve 
their customer relationships. Smart fitting rooms 
are among the latest trends among clothing retail-
ers. RFID tags identify the items that are brought 
in and transmit their information to interactive 
mirrors. Here, consumers are shown additional 
information about the garment at hand, they can 
request different colors or sizes via touchscreen 
from shopping assistants, or directly log on to 
their account and add the item to a virtual shop-
ping basket (Davies, 2015). The mirror can also 
provide 360-degree views of outfits, give advice 
about fit and style, and suggest complements and 
accessories. Nordstrom&rsquo;s, Ralph Lauren, and 
Bloomingdale&rsquo;s have all tested the technology. 
However, even such helpful uses of RFID technol-
ogy can be perceived as intrusive into customers&rsquo; 
privacy though and increase concerns about the 
collection and usage of the obtained information.
</p>
<p>Public Media
</p>
<p>Public media also play a key role in shaping per-
ceptions of privacy issues. During the past decade, 
increasing attention in both electronic and print 
media has focused on privacy issues and actively 
shaped customers&rsquo; concerns. Greater media cov-
erage of privacy issues ultimately can increase 
information privacy concerns. In addition, private 
consumer groups, such as the Electronic Privacy

</p>
<p>Information Center (EPIC), report privacy 
breaches to popular media, heightening custom-
ers&rsquo; attitudes and concerns about privacy issues. A 
study of mass media coverage of customer privacy 
issues between 1990 and 2001 across newspapers, 
consumer magazines, and trade publications 
revealed that the number of total articles across all 
three formats increased by 70%, from 2278 articles 
in 1990 to 3876&nbsp;in 2000 (Roznowski, 2003). Other 
recent research shows that actual media coverage 
of privacy issues, especially through the increased 
diffusion of social networks, has grown even 
more. This growth also reflects new conceptual-
izations of journalism, exemplified by non- 
professional authors publishing news on blogs 
that blur the distinction between independent 
journalism and other information sources (Peltier, 
Milne, &amp; Phelps, 2009). In 2013, after the revela-
tions about the NSA&rsquo;s PRISM program by Edward 
Snowden, up to 240,000 news documents about 
the affair were published each day on the Internet 
(Preibusch, 2015). Massive media coverage even 
continued the following 30&nbsp; days, with the daily 
volume of new websites being 18 times higher 
than before the affair.
</p>
<p>Even companies acknowledge the importance 
of media coverage; Facebook reacted to reports of 
a customer privacy breach of its social network 
site only after the problem was prominently cov-
ered by The Wall Street Journal (The Economist, 
2011). Public media in all its forms thus shapes 
customers&rsquo; perceptions of information privacy, 
and newer platforms such as Twitter and social 
networks can help spread negative news immedi-
ately and worldwide, with dramatic potential 
impacts on companies&rsquo; bottom lines.
</p>
<p>Government Regulation
</p>
<p>Government regulation, or the lack thereof, has a 
powerful impact on customer privacy concerns. A 
perceived lack of business policy or governmental 
regulation results in greater privacy concerns 
(Wirtz, Lwin, &amp; Williams, 2007), and different 
regulatory approaches to customer privacy, as 
well as the extent to which governments (mis)use 
personal information, highlight cross-national 
differences in privacy concerns. Access to per-
sonal information can help governments serve 
their citizenry better, collect taxes, and enforce 
laws and regulations. But governments must take 
a very different position toward personal infor-
mation than either businesses or individuals. 
</p>
<p>Governments have the power to take and use 
information without permission; Great Britain 
maintains a closed-circuit television surveillance 
system in public and private sectors with around 5 
million cameras, over 400,000&nbsp;in public and inde-
pendent schools, and extensive government and 
commercial databases (The Telegraph, 2013). Its 
police-run DNA database is the largest per capita 
worldwide. However, with the passing of the 
Protection of Freedoms Act in 2012, the collec-
tion and usage of biometric data was regulated in 
accordance with rising privacy concerns.
</p>
<p>The USA Patriot Act, which introduced legis-
lative changes after the September, 11, 2001, 
attacks in an attempt to prevent terrorism, serves 
as another example. The surveillance and investi-
gative powers of law enforcement agencies were 
significantly increased, and agencies such as the 
Department of Defense received permission to 
search telephone, e-mail communications, and 
the medical, financial, and other records of U.S. 
citizens without their consent, which in turn 
stoked significant privacy concerns (EPIC, 2011).
</p>
<p>Privacy International, a human rights group 
established in 1990 to provide information about 
surveillance and privacy invasions by govern-
ments and corporations, recently published a 
comprehensive report on the surveillance indus-
try along with case studies of government surveil-
lance of its citizens (Privacy International, 2016). 
It revealed that the U.S. intelligence budget in 
2013 totals to approx. $52.6 billion, double that of 
2001. Most of it goes to private companies. 
. Figure&nbsp;14.3 shows the global distribution of sur-
veillance companies, with the majority based in 
the United States.
</p>
<p>With respect to the constitutional protection of 
privacy, significant differences become apparent 
even among European countries. Germany tradi-
tionally obtains very strict protection and safe-
guards when it comes to privacy protection, 
whereas the United Kingdom or the USA give 
companies and government institutions more free-
dom in collecting and processing private data, inter 
alia to counteract terrorism. For example, Privacy 
International (2015, p.&nbsp;1) states that UK legislation 
&laquo;does not ensure that interception and access to 
communications data is carried out in accordance 
with applicable international human rights stan-
dards to respect and protect the right to privacy&raquo;.
</p>
<p>Yet these ratings do not always fully represent 
customers&rsquo; concerns about privacy protection in 
</p>

</p>
<p>their home countries. Rather, privacy concerns 
raised by customers (or the media) in a country 
can demand legislative actions by the govern-
ment, leading to improved privacy protections 
(Roznowski, 2003). Germany, with its very con-
cerned customers and high position in the privacy 
ranking, serves as a good example.
</p>
<p>14.2  Regulations to&nbsp;Protect 
Customer Privacy
</p>
<p>The difference between European and U.S. regula-
tion of customer privacy is well-established: In gen-
eral, information privacy is protected more under 
European law than U.S. law (despite differences 
among EU members). Specifically, customer pri-
vacy regulations generally reflect two perspectives: 
industry self-regulation or government- imposed 
regulation. These two approaches summarize the 
difference between the protection frameworks 
established by the EU and the United States, as 
well as the extent to which the respective govern-
ment controls privacy protection. Whereas the EU 
</p>
<p>has adopted a data protection directive that sets 
strict privacy standards, U.S. privacy protections 
tend to be left to self- regulation within industries. 
These approaches represent the differences in their 
cultural and societal values and thus their differ-
ent perceptions of customer privacy. For example, 
from a German viewpoint, the protection of per-
sonal dignity (e.g., image, name, reputation) is 
threatened primarily by the media, whereas in the 
U.S. mindset, protection of liberty within one&rsquo;s 
home is threatened primarily by the government. 
These differences have their roots in the countries&rsquo; 
histories. The German privacy law and protection 
of personality and position within society have 
emerged as reactions to fascism and the strictly 
hierarchical society structures of the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries. In contrast, the United 
States has embraced the principal of a &laquo;limited gov-
ernment,&raquo; which idealizes minimal governmental 
intervention in personal liberty and the economy, 
ever since the introduction of the Bill of Rights in 
1789 (Whitman, 2004). We therefore present both 
types of protection frameworks using the United 
States and Germany as representative examples.

</p>
<p>14.2.1  United States: Customer 
Privacy Protection Based 
on&nbsp;Industry Self-regulation
</p>
<p> 5 U.S.&nbsp;Constitution: The U.S.&nbsp;Constitution does 
not explicitly provide citizens a right to 
privacy, though a limited constitutional right 
of privacy has been established, according to 
several provisions in the Bill of Rights.
</p>
<p> 5 Robinson list: The U.S. government has 
established a Do-Not-Call registry for people 
to register to avoid receiving telemarketing 
calls. Registration is free, and telephone 
numbers placed on the registry will remain 
there permanently, according to the Do-Not- 
Call Improvement Act of 2007 (FTC, 2015). 
Similar approaches also exist for Germany, 
such as the Robinson list of the German 
Direct Marketing Association, though they 
are not government regulated.
</p>
<p> 5 FTC: The main agency protecting U.S. 
customer privacy also handles violations of 
the Federal Privacy Act of 1974. The Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC) also has outlined 
the Fair Information Practices Principles, a 
series of reports, guidelines, and model codes 
that represent widely accepted principles 
concerning fair information practices (FTC, 
2000).
</p>
<p> Notice and&nbsp;Awareness
</p>
<p>Customers should receive notice of an entity&rsquo;s 
information practices before being requested to 
provide any personal information. Without 
notice, a customer cannot make an informed 
decision about whether and to what extent to dis-
close personal information. Moreover, three other 
principles&mdash;choice and consent, access and par-
ticipation, and enforcement and redress&mdash;are 
meaningful only when a customer has notice of 
an entity&rsquo;s policies and his or her rights thereto.
</p>
<p> Choice and&nbsp;Consent
</p>
<p>Choice means giving customers options as to how 
any personal information collected from them 
will be used. Specifically, choice relates to second-
ary uses of information, or those beyond the uses 
necessary to complete the contemplated transac-
tion. Such secondary uses can be internal, such as 
placing the customer on the company&rsquo;s mailing 
</p>
<p>list to market additional products or promotions, 
or external, which implies the transfer of the 
information to third parties.
</p>
<p> Access
</p>
<p>Customers have the right to view their personal 
data and to contest that data&rsquo;s accuracy and com-
pleteness. The access process must be timely and 
relatively inexpensive, and incorrect information 
should be easy to contest, verify, or amend.
</p>
<p> Integrity and&nbsp;Security
</p>
<p>To ensure data integrity, collectors must take rea-
sonable steps, such as using only reputable sources 
of data and cross-referencing data against multi-
ple sources, providing customer access to data, 
and destroying untimely data or converting it to 
anonymous forms. Security involves both mana-
gerial and technical measures to protect against 
loss and the unauthorized access, destruction, 
use, or disclosure of the data.
</p>
<p> Enforcement and&nbsp;Redress
</p>
<p>Without an enforcement and redress mechanism, 
even a fair information practice code is merely 
suggestive; it cannot ensure compliance with core 
fair information principles. Alternative enforce-
ment approaches include industry self-regulation, 
legislation that creates private remedies for cus-
tomers, and/or regulatory schemes enforceable 
through civil and criminal sanctions. . Appendix 
1 gives an overview of recent FTC settlements 
related to violations of the fair information prac-
tice principles.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the FTC has published a report 
to protect customer privacy in the online environ-
ment. Titled &laquo;Protecting Consumer Privacy in an 
Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for 
Businesses and Policymakers,&raquo; this report 
includes the FTC&rsquo;s recommendation for the &laquo;Do 
Not Track&raquo; mechanism that customers can use to 
opt out of the collection of information about 
their Internet activity for the development of tar-
geted advertisements, recognizing: &laquo;Industry 
must do better. For every business, privacy should 
be a basic consideration&mdash;similar to keeping track 
of costs and revenues, or strategic planning&raquo; 
(FTC, 2010). Although the FTC has been success-
fully enforcing its privacy guidelines in many 
court cases, it seems not yet to have managed to

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>296
</p>

</p>
<p>set a legal precedent to simplify legal enforce-
ment. But, analysts predict that settlements, like 
the one reached with Facebook in 2011 as a reac-
tion to a series of privacy violations by the net-
work, could be decisive for inducing change in 
U.S. privacy practices and strengthening the 
FTC&rsquo;s position (Gartner, 2011). Thus, the overall 
extent to which U.S. customers&rsquo; privacy is pro-
tected, in comparison with EU consumers, 
remains very limited. A lack of governmental leg-
islation and associated privacy concerns push 
customers to attempt to regain control over their 
privacy, such as by fabricating false personal 
information or even refusing to purchase (Wirtz 
et&nbsp; al., 2007). This development could be fueled 
further by media publicity; the U.S. government 
already is dedicating more attention to the topic 
of customer privacy and is likely to increase gov-
ernmental regulation. The failure of the Safe 
Harbor treaty between the United States and the 
EU and the fast agreement on the successive 
EU-US Privacy Shield bear witness to this devel-
opment. Safe Harbor used to allow U.S. firms to 
save private data of EU citizens signed up for the 
treaty. However, the European Court of Justice 
declared Safe Harbor void in 2015, as an indirect 
consequence of Edward Snowden&rsquo;s revelations 
about mass surveillance by the American National 
Security Agency (NSA). In July of 2016, the EU 
Commission and the USA agreed up-on the 
EU-US Privacy Shield as its successor. However, 
criticism of the novel agreement re-mains wide-
spread. Whether additional privacy protection 
laws and treaties will reduce cus-tomer privacy 
concerns ultimately depends to a large degree on 
their enforcement.
</p>
<p>14.2.2  Germany: Customer Privacy 
Protection Based on 
Governmental Legislation
</p>
<p> The German Constitution
</p>
<p>Article ten of the Basic Law (as the German 
Constitution is known) states: &laquo;(1) Privacy let-
ters, posts, and telecommunication shall be invi-
olable. (2) Restrictions may only be ordered 
pursuant to a statute. Where a restriction serves 
to protect the free democratic basic order or the 
existence or security of the Federation, the statute 
</p>
<p>may stipulate that the person affected shall not be 
informed of such restriction and that recourse to 
the courts shall be replaced by a review of the 
case by bodies and auxiliary bodies appointed by 
Parliament.&raquo;
</p>
<p> Data Protection Law
</p>
<p>Germany has one of the strictest data protection 
laws in the EU.&nbsp;The general purpose of this act is 
to protect individual rights to avoid impaired pri-
vacy. The act covers the collection, processing, 
and use of personal data by public federal author-
ities and state administrations and by private bod-
ies that rely on data processing systems or 
non-automated filing systems for commercial or 
professional use. Most federal statutes with any 
impact on personal information or privacy con-
tain references to the Federal Data Protection Act, 
if they do not carry special sections on the han-
dling of personal data themselves.
</p>
<p> The German Teleservices Data 
Privacy&nbsp;Act
</p>
<p>This Act protects customer privacy online and 
requires explicit user consent before the usage logs 
of a session may be stored beyond its duration, 
usage profiles of different services combined, or 
user profiles constructed in a non- pseudonymous 
manner. Websites may not decline service if cus-
tomers decline to grant approval but instead must 
abandon these methods or use other legitimate 
methods in these situations.
</p>
<p> Section 7 of&nbsp;the&nbsp;German Unfair 
Competition Act
</p>
<p>Direct marketing issues are addressed by Section 
7 of the German Unfair Competition Act. 
According to its general clause, it is unfair to 
annoy market players (customers) inappropri-
ately. By default, this rule applies to unwanted 
advertisements, unsolicited commercial phone 
calls, marketing methods that use automated call-
ing machines, fax machines or e-mail (spam) 
received without prior consent, and any direct 
marketing that cannot be linked to the senders&rsquo; 
identity.
</p>
<p>Direct marketing via e-mail is not prohibited 
as spam if:
</p>
<p> 5 The organization has received the e-mail 
address in the context of selling goods or 
services to the customer.

</p>
<p> 5 The organization uses the e-mail contact for 
marketing very similar products and services.
</p>
<p> 5 The customer has not opposed the use of 
e-mail for further direct marketing.
</p>
<p> 5 At the time of the collection and each usage, 
the company clearly sets out the right to 
opt-out from direct marketing via e-mail 
(Section 7, Paragraph 3, Items 1&ndash;4 Unfair 
Competition Act).
</p>
<p> 5 There is no cold calling, which is a violation 
of the Unfair Competition Law.
</p>
<p>As a member of the EU, Germany also has incor-
porated Article 8 of the European Convention of 
Human Rights, which protects &laquo;the right to 
respect for private and family life,&raquo; and the new 
Charter of Fundamental Rights, which contains 
articles on both &laquo;Respect for Private and Family 
Life&raquo; and &laquo;Protection of Personal Data,&raquo; into its 
own law (Whitman, 2004). Even despite these 
comprehensive data protection laws, information 
privacy remains a vital topic of discussion both 
for customers and the German government.
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp; 14.1 contains an overview of impor-
tant customer privacy regulation aspects for com-
panies to consider when doing business in the 
United States or Germany.
</p>
<p>14.2.3  The General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR)
</p>
<p>In 2016, the European Union adopted its new 
data protection framework&nbsp; &ndash; the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR). It will replace the 
current Directive 95/46/EC from 1995, which is 
still the basis of data protection in the EU today. 
The GDPR is set out to strengthen data protec-
tion for individuals and provide a common set of 
rules for all member countries by 2018. Unlike the 
Directive, it will be directly applicable and does not 
need to be implemented by national legislation.
</p>
<p>Among others, the regulation introduces the 
following major changes:
</p>
<p> Rule Harmonization and 
One-Stop&nbsp;Shop
</p>
<p>By making the regulation take effect in all EU mem-
ber countries at once and without national adap-
tations, a single set of rules applies across states. 
Supervisory Authorities (SA) will be established 
in each country to function as the central point of 
contact for monitoring compliance, investigating 
complaints, and imposing sanctions. If companies 
keep multiple establishments in more than one 
country, there will be only one responsible SA,

</p>
<p> Expanded Territorial Reach
</p>
<p>Data processing and monitoring activities of enti-
ties outside the EU fall under the GDPR, if they 
pertain to EU data subjects. This primarily refers 
to companies offering goods or services to EU 
consumers. But it also extends to profiling 
through website tracking and other monitoring 
behavior in case users access the website within 
the EU (Allen &amp; Overy, 2016).
</p>
<p> Data Protection Officers
</p>
<p>Public authorities and private companies have to, 
under certain circumstances, appoint a Data 
Protection Officer (DPO). The DPO is similar to a 
Compliance Officer, whose presence is already 
required in larger companies today. However, the 
DPO&rsquo;s skill set stretches beyond that of a 
Compliance Officer as he not only needs to be 
 knowledgeable about data protection legislation, 
but proficient in technical aspects of data security 
as well (e.g., privacy by design, IT infrastructure, 
reaction to cyber-attacks). Contrary to the cur-
rent Directive, DPOs may be assigned to multiple 
entities (Allen &amp; Overy, 2016).
</p>
<p> Profiling
</p>
<p>Profiling consumers will be subject to appeal 
(EU-GDPR, Article 22). Profiling is de-fined as 
&laquo;any form of automated processing of personal 
data evaluating the personal as-pects relating to a 
natural person&raquo; (EU-GDPR, Recital 71). Examples 
given by the Recital are automatic refusal of an 
online credit application or e-recruiting practices 
without any human intervention. Even if such 
profiling is lawful, consumers may object this 
practice (EU-GDPR, Article 21), making it very 
difficult to be resumed by public or private enti-
ties. In case data processing, including profiling, is 
used for direct marketing purposes, the objection 
is final and prohibits all subsequent activities 
under any circumstances.
</p>
<p> Privacy by Design and&nbsp;by Default
</p>
<p>Data protection measures must be included in the 
business processes of new products and services, 
taking into account potential threats to consumer 
privacy already in the early stage of product 
</p>
<p>development (EU-GDPR, Article 25). Examples 
for such measures in-clude pseudonymization, 
data minimization, and IT security.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, privacy protection must be 
implemented by default, setting high standards 
for data collection and processing, unless explicit 
consent allows otherwise.
</p>
<p> Consent
</p>
<p>Consent needs to be explicit for sensitive data 
(opt-in). If a consumer wants to withdraw her 
consent, she must be able to do so just as easily as 
she was able to give consent in the first place 
(Allen &amp; Overy, 2016). The obligation to prove 
that consent was given rests with the data control-
ler, i.e., the entity which decides how and why 
personal data is processed. Also, consent must be 
given freely. For example, it is generally question-
able whether this is the case, if &laquo;the performance 
of a contract is made conditional on the consent 
to processing data that is not necessary to per-
form that contract&raquo; (Allen &amp; Overy, 2016). 
Especially many mobile applications may there-
fore have to change their data collection policies 
when offering services to EU consumers.
</p>
<p> Right to&nbsp;Erasure
</p>
<p>Individuals may require the data controller to 
erase personal data. The request must be answered 
within one month and realized without inappro-
priate delay. Further, the data controller has to 
inform third parties that processed the data (e.g., 
by making them public) of the request and ask 
them to delete any links and copies (EU-GDPR, 
Article 17). The right to erasure was formulated 
after Google Spain was required to remove links 
that related to initially lawfully obtained data, 
which had become inaccurate over time (Court of 
Justice of the European Union, 2014). Specifically, 
a Spanish national resident demanded a link to 
two regional newspapers to be erased, which con-
tained articles about the individual&rsquo;s historical 
debts. The court ruled that individuals have the 
right to request the removal of data where it is 
inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive.
</p>
<p> Fines
</p>
<p>Infringements of the GDPR may yield to drasti-
cally increased penalties of up to &euro;20 million or 
4% of the annual worldwide turnover (EU-GDPR, 
2016). The magnitude of the fine depends, inter 
alia, on the nature, gravity, and the duration of the

<p/>

</p>
<p>infringement (Allen &amp; Overy, 2016). Article 83 of 
the GDPR provides two different categories of 
infringements and corresponding maximum pen-
alties.
</p>
<p>14.3  Customer Privacy Protective 
Responses
</p>
<p>The Symantec (2015) found that 57% of 
Europeans are worried their data is not safe and 
59% of respondents have experienced a data pro-
tection issue in the past. Increasing privacy con-
cerns among customers have led to the 
development of negative attitudes toward CRM 
practices. The more customers fear that their pri-
vacy is endangered, the higher the level of risk 
they will perceive. Meanwhile, an increase in cus-
tomers&rsquo; privacy concerns reduces trust in the 
company. A high level of risk and a low level of 
trust in the company together increase custom-
ers&rsquo; intentions to protect their privacy while 
reducing their willingness to provide any per-
sonal information. Furthermore, customers who 
perceive threats to their privacy respond with 
defensive actions that may enable them to regain 
control over their personal information, such as 
refusing to purchase.
</p>
<p>Many of these responses increase costs for 
marketers and ultimately reduce the effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of CRM initiatives. Furthermore, this defensive 
demeanor represents a substantial threat to the 
development of new forms of information-led 
marketing. Thus, companies must realize the dif-
ferent ramifications of customer privacy con-
cerns. Our proposed taxonomy of privacy 
protective responses, in . Fig.&nbsp;14.4, identifies six 
behavioral responses, classified into three catego-
ries: (1) information provision, (2) private action, 
and (3) public action (Son &amp; Kim, 2008).
</p>
<p>14.3.1  Information Provision
</p>
<p>If customers are concerned about their informa-
tion privacy, they sometimes provide falsified per-
sonal data (Misrepresentation), which threatens 
the data quality that is so crucial to ensuring effi-
cient CRM (Wirtz et&nbsp; al., 2007). Furthermore, 
some customers just refuse to give out personal 
information (Refusal). 7 Anonymizer.com, a pro-
tective online service, blocks attempts to identify 
ISP domains, browser settings, surfing histories, 
and e-mail addresses, thus providing customers 
with a means to hinder companies from collect-
ing online information. Because CRM relies on 
customer-provided information as a vital source 
of data, which then enables accurate relationship- 
fostering efforts and better targeting of prospec-
tive customers, such responses constitute major 
threats to CRM practices.

</p>
<p>14.3.2  Private Action
</p>
<p>In addition to information disclosure, concerned 
customers might take private actions such as boy-
cotts of particular retailers, service providers, or 
products. For example, online information pri-
vacy concerns might lead to information boycotts, 
such that customers remove their personal infor-
mation from company databases or online com-
munities (Removal).
</p>
<p>Online customers also might choose to opt- 
out and explicitly restrict a website from transfer-
ring their data to any third party not directly 
involved in processing the transaction for which 
the data were collected.
</p>
<p>If they perceive a threat to their information 
privacy, customers often voice negative comments 
to their friends and relatives (Negative Word-of- 
Mouth). Because a customer&rsquo;s in-group includes 
like-minded people, companies that are subject to 
such negative word of mouth lose the chance to 
recruit new potential customers and bear the 
potential damage to their reputations.
</p>
<p>14.3.3  Public Action
</p>
<p>Taking public action is another type of customer 
response to information privacy concerns: The 
customer either directly complains to the com-
pany (Complaining Directly to Companies) or 
indirectly notifies a third-party organization 
(Complaining Indirectly via Third Party). When 
customers turn to the company to complain about 
its handling of their data, the company has the 
opportunity to respond adequately and even solve 
the issue, which means it gains a chance to retain 
customers. If companies do not deal with the 
complaints adequately though, customers often 
turn to third-party organizations, such as EPIC 
and the FTC.&nbsp; In this case, the audience for the 
complaint is much larger. Unlike private actions, 
such public actions aim not only to obtain a per-
sonal benefit but also to help the general public, 
because the accused company can no longer vio-
late customers&rsquo; privacy.
</p>
<p>Although customers&rsquo; privacy protective 
responses pose a serious constraint on compa-
nies&rsquo; CRM practices, intentions to respond to 
privacy concerns do not always directly translate 
</p>
<p>into actual behavior&mdash;especially when it comes to 
information disclosure. Many studies have shown 
that customers often contradict themselves by 
stating that they would not give out information 
to a company but then actually do so (KPMG, 
2010), the so-called privacy paradox.
</p>
<p>14.4  Privacy Paradox
</p>
<p>&laquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange that 88 percent of the people claim 
that they are worried about who has access to 
their data? 86 percent claim that they are getting 
increasingly more security-conscious about their 
data. 85 percent expect that governments should 
impose penalties on companies that misuse data. 
And in the US some 83 percent of consumers say 
they would stop doing business with a company 
entirely if they heard or read that the company 
misused customer information. At the same time, 
845 million people are active on Facebook, every 
day over 250 million photos are uploaded to the 
platform. In many countries, over 70 percent of 
shoppers use loyalty cards. Isn&rsquo;t this a discrep-
ancy?&raquo; (Spiekermann, 2012). This evidence uni-
formly points to the privacy paradox, namely, the 
discrepancy between people&rsquo;s intentions to pro-
tect their own privacy and their actual behaviors 
in the marketplace. This phenomenon also has 
been observed in research that demonstrates that 
people claim they are less willing to provide per-
sonal information to marketers than they actually 
provide when a marketer directly requests such 
information. This gap appears due to the different 
perceptions of risk and trust that arise in response 
to intention measures versus actual disclosure set-
tings (Norberg et&nbsp;al., 2007).
</p>
<p>Companies must pay close attention to this 
discrepancy though, especially with respect to 
their CRM practices. Specifically, CRM managers 
need a deep understanding of the link between 
customers&rsquo; intentions to disclose information and 
their actual behaviors, to avoid alienating custom-
ers and to align their CRM initiatives appropriately 
and fairly. They especially need to take into account 
that even if customers give out their personal 
information, overly intrusive CRM practices can 
agitate public media, which likely means damage 
to the company&rsquo;s image. Furthermore, companies 
should strive to find ways to increase consumers&rsquo; 
willingness to share important information vol-
</p>

<p/>
</div>

<p>301 14
</p>
<p>untarily, such as offering small monetary incen-
tives. Such voluntary sharing of information can 
enhance the data accuracy and effectiveness of 
knowledge management systems designed to help 
organizations interact with customers, as well as 
maximize the benefits of customer relationships.
</p>
<p>14.5  Consequences of&nbsp;Privacy 
Protective Responses
</p>
<p>If customers fear their privacy is being endan-
gered and react with privacy protective responses, 
several consequences are likely for companies. 
Especially in the context of CRM practices, com-
panies should be aware of the following potential 
ramifications (Blattberg, Kim, &amp; Neslin, 2008):
</p>
<p>14.5.1  Loss of&nbsp;Trust and&nbsp;Brand 
Integrity
</p>
<p>If breaches of customer privacy become public, 
customers&rsquo; privacy concerns increase and lead to a 
loss of trust in the company. This negative impres-
sion can harm a company&rsquo;s brand image and ulti-
mately alter customers&rsquo; choices and consumption 
patterns.
</p>
<p>14.5.2  Decreased Sales
</p>
<p>Goldfarb and Tucker (2011) found that in Europe, 
where strict privacy laws have been implemented, 
banner advertising&rsquo;s effectiveness decreased by 
65% in terms of stated purchase intention. This is 
a significant number as the total Internet advertis-
ing revenue is forecasted to increase from $135.42 
billion in 2014 to $239.87 billion in 2019 globally 
(PWC, 2016).
</p>
<p>14.5.3  Decrease in&nbsp;Data Quality
</p>
<p>If customers falsify their personal information or 
refuse to give out any data, data quality becomes 
threatened and decreases the effectiveness of CRM 
practices. Limited access to accurate customer 
data paints a biased picture of the customer and 
thus decreases the precision of predictive models 
and targeting initiatives (Wirtz et&nbsp;al., 2007).
</p>
<p>14.5.4  Increased Costs 
due&nbsp;to&nbsp;Privacy Protection
</p>
<p>Compliance with stricter privacy rules is esti-
mated to increase the total costs of catalog or 
online apparel retailers by 3.5&ndash;11% (Turner, 
2001). This cost applies especially in the United 
States; the EU privacy protection framework is 
already very strict.
</p>
<p>14.5.5  Ethical Dilemma
</p>
<p>Collecting data that consumers do not want to be 
collected places managers in an ethical dilemma. 
Do they ignore customers&rsquo; wishes to protect their 
privacy, and thus increase their chances of eco-
nomic success, but also run the risk of alienating 
their most valuable assets?
</p>
<p>In summary, privacy concerns pose a real 
threat to companies practicing CRM.&nbsp;Negligence 
leads to decreased sales and lower efficiency 
for their predictive modeling. Moreover, com-
pliance and litigation costs can reduce profit-
ability. Thus companies must carefully balance 
the benefits of obtaining additional customer 
information, such as more accurate targeting of 
their offerings and marketing communications, 
against the increasing concerns of customer pri-
vacy, which can lead to disloyalty and customer 
churn.
</p>
<p>14.6  Implications for&nbsp;Companies
</p>
<p>This discussion of customer privacy concerns 
and their implications reveals that customer 
privacy is an important topic for companies, 
to be considered especially in the context of 
CRM.&nbsp;Consequently, CRM mangers and market-
ers constantly look for appropriate ways to react 
to or even prevent customers&rsquo; privacy concerns. 
Using a checklist adapted from Harriet Pearson, 
vice president, security council, and chief privacy 
officer at IBM, we seek to provide insights into 
where companies must consider privacy issues, 
what legal requirements they must take into 
account, and how they can achieve the successful 
implementation of responsible privacy protection 
practices in a CRM context (Pearson, 2007).
</p>
<p>14.6 &middot;  Implications for&nbsp;Companies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>302
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>14.6.1  Align Privacy with&nbsp;Strategy
</p>
<p>Privacy concerns can translate into negative brand 
images and harm a company&rsquo;s valuable assets. It is 
thus especially important for businesses with very 
valuable brands or that compete in information- 
intensive industries (e.g., health care, finance, 
high-tech) to take the lead when it comes to pri-
vacy and data protection.
</p>
<p>14.6.2  Look Beyond Rules to&nbsp;Values
</p>
<p>Trust perceptions of a company and its CRM prac-
tices generally are determined through direct cus-
tomer&ndash;employee contacts. Embedding privacy and 
security values into corporate cultures thus will yield 
greater returns than even the most comprehensive 
set of rules. When values are developed from the 
bottom up, they tend to be lived, not just recited.
</p>
<p>14.6.3  Anticipate Issues
</p>
<p>It should be someone&rsquo;s job to scan for products or 
practices, within the business or across the indus-
try, that raise legitimate privacy concerns, and then 
collaborate with stakeholders to develop reasonable 
solutions. Firms must be prepared to work across 
the industry as well as internally. Furthermore, they 
should think about implementing a third-party 
certification, such as TRUSTe or the Better Business 
Bureau, to obtain recognizable privacy seals and 
thereby signal high privacy standards to customers.
</p>
<p>14.6.4  Create Accountability
</p>
<p>The role of a privacy or security officer is to unite 
and coordinate efforts across functional silos. All 
those involved in setting and implementing infor-
mation policies&mdash;the head of human resources, 
the chief information officer, and the marketing 
vice president, for example&mdash;should participate, 
but there also must be a single person who is 
responsible and accountable for privacy efforts.
</p>
<p>14.6.5  Do Not Conflate Security  
and Privacy
</p>
<p>Getting privacy right in a business context means 
meeting societal or regulatory expectations for 
</p>
<p>what type of information is collected, how much, 
with whom it may be shared, how it will be used 
and protected, and how long it is retained. Resist 
the temptation to focus solely on data security; 
firms must be aware of the different legal require-
ments in different countries in which they operate.
</p>
<p>14.6.6  Treat Privacy as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Social 
Responsibility
</p>
<p>In globally connected, information-rich societies, 
privacy and data protection belong on the corpo-
rate citizenship agenda, right alongside the envi-
ronment, diversity, and other important issues.
</p>
<p>14.6.7  Manage Your Data Supply 
Chain
</p>
<p>Data handling obligations flow with data that 
cross corporate or national boundaries. Business 
ecosystems that include global sources of talent 
and services need standards for data management 
that can rationalize an international patchwork of 
expectations and regulations.
</p>
<p>14.6.8  Rely on&nbsp;Technology When 
Appropriate
</p>
<p>They cannot substitute for leadership, common 
sense, and good policies, but simple tools (e.g., 
automated checklists, encryption, audit logs) can 
do wonders to enable compliance. And emerging 
capabilities, such as face masking in digital sur-
veillance systems or privacy-preserving data min-
ing, can help resolve conflicts between information 
use and privacy.
</p>
<p>14.6.9  Plan for&nbsp;Disaster Recovery
</p>
<p>No information system is fail-safe. In case of a 
data loss or breach, a rehearsed response should 
be in place to address technical, individual, legal, 
and other needs.
</p>
<p>14.6.10  Heed both Boomers 
and&nbsp;Millennials
</p>
<p>The under-25 crowd is not dismissive of privacy, 
but it embraces online, collaborative work and play

 Problem
</p>
<p>Though consumers worry about 
</p>
<p>how their personal data is gath-
</p>
<p>ered and used, they&rsquo;re surprisingly 
</p>
<p>ignorant of what data they reveal 
</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re online, and most 
</p>
<p>companies opt not to enlighten 
</p>
<p>them. This dynamic erodes trust in 
</p>
<p>firms and customers&rsquo; willingness to 
</p>
<p>share information.
</p>
<p> Solution
</p>
<p>Companies need to design products 
</p>
<p>and services with transparency and 
</p>
<p>data pri-vacy in mind. They must 
</p>
<p>provide customers with appropriate 
</p>
<p>value in exchange for data, educate 
</p>
<p>them about how it is collected, and 
</p>
<p>allow them to have control over it.
</p>
<p> Best Practice
</p>
<p>Disney devised electronic wrist-
</p>
<p>bands that give park visitors access 
</p>
<p>to attractions and hotel rooms and 
</p>
<p>allow them to charge food. Disney 
</p>
<p>uses the bands to collect data on 
</p>
<p>customers but clearly spells out 
</p>
<p>its practices and privacy policies. 
</p>
<p>The tradeoffs are transparent to 
</p>
<p>the customers, who find the con-
</p>
<p>venience and other benefits the 
</p>
<p>bands offer worthwhile.

</p>
<p>far more than earlier generations. Privacy thinking 
should span generational norms and expectations. 
One employee may freely post pictures and per-
sonal information online but recoil from having 
an employer or the government collect a biometric 
identifier; another may prefer just the opposite.
</p>
<p>14.7  Future Issues: Data as&nbsp;Currency
</p>
<p>In 2009, Meglena Kuneva (European Consumer 
Commissioner) already stated that &laquo;Personal data 
is the new oil of the Internet and the new cur-
rency of the digital world&raquo; (World Economic 
Forum, 2011, p.&nbsp; 5). A vast variety of different 
types of personal data exist, such as web searches 
and sites visited, purchase histories, likes, tweets, 
real- world location coordinates, or tracked 
health- related data. This personal data creates 
economic and societal value. For example, com-
panies can use personal data of their customers to 
develop customized products and services and 
thus monetize these data (World Economic 
Forum, 2011). Not only companies understand 
the value of personal data, but also consumers 
increasingly recognize their huge value. By now, 
they are less willing to give companies their sensi-
tive data for free and start taking advantage of 
their worth (Datafloq, 2016). The number of con-
sumers stating that their personal data are a use-
</p>
<p>ful tool to negotiate better deals from companies 
increased from 40% in 2012 to 52% in 2015. The 
majority of consumers expects stronger incen-
tives with increasing sensitivity of personal data. 
Consumers are most likely to share their data for 
direct incentives that pad their wallets or pockets, 
such as direct financial rewards, free products or 
services, or discounts (Direct Marketing 
Association, 2015). For example, Google&rsquo;s 
Screenwise Trends panel pays up to $8 to con-
sumers who are willing to share data on their 
browsing behavior with Google and its partners. 
Raptr, another example that refers to an applica-
tion with nearly 26 million users, provides its 
users with free games, hardware or discounts in 
exchange for data on their video gaming habits 
(Datafloq, 2016).
</p>
<p>As both parties&mdash;data providers and data 
users&mdash;might monetarize personal data, provision 
of these data can represent a win-win situation. 
However, despite the increasing amount of data 
generated daily by consumers and the growing sen-
timent to regard this personal data as a currency, 
research on why and when consumers exchange 
personal infor-mation for incentives and how com-
panies determine those incentives is scarce. 
Therefore, in . Fig.&nbsp;14.5 we provide a brief research 
agenda that provides fruitful ideas for future analy-
ses. Distinguishing between a data provider and 
data user perspective, these ideas are interrelated.

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>In the present chapter, we discuss the central 
</p>
<p>role of customer privacy concerns in CRM 
</p>
<p>practices. For this purpose, we firstly introduce 
</p>
<p>and define customer privacy in the context 
</p>
<p>of CRM.&nbsp;Thereafter, we identify drivers of 
</p>
<p>customer privacy concerns, both internal 
</p>
<p>and external. Internal drivers hereby advert 
</p>
<p>to company-related operations which evoke 
</p>
<p>customers&rsquo; fears about the disclosure and 
</p>
<p>handling of their personal information. In this 
</p>
<p>context, the way companies collect personal 
</p>
<p>information (Collection), whether a customer 
</p>
<p>can control the uses made of this informa-
</p>
<p>tion (Control), and the clear understanding of 
</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s conditions and practices with 
</p>
<p>respect to privacy (Awareness) are especially 
</p>
<p>recognizable. In a next step, we identify 
</p>
<p>external drivers which foster customers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>privacy concerns, namely Internet, techno-
</p>
<p>logical advances, public media coverage as 
</p>
<p>well as governmental regulations. We find 
</p>
<p>that the rise of the Web 2.0 and online social 
</p>
<p>networks provides customers with various 
</p>
<p>possibilities to share personal information, 
</p>
<p>thereby opening doors for companies to 
</p>
<p>collect openly available data about custom-
</p>
<p>ers. But in this context especially companies&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>data collection without customers&rsquo; consent 
</p>
<p>fosters privacy concerns thus posing a risk 
</p>
<p>for efficient CRM practices. Additionally, tech-
</p>
<p>nological advances, such as RFID technology 
</p>
<p>and location- based services, as well as the 
</p>
<p>coverage of this topic in public media add to 
</p>
<p>customers&rsquo; increasing fear of losing control 
</p>
<p>over their personal data. Different privacy 
</p>
<p>regulatory frameworks in different countries 
</p>
<p>also affect customers&rsquo; privacy concerns. Thus 
</p>
<p>in the following, we compare the regulatory 
</p>
<p>frameworks of both the EU and the U.S.&nbsp;We 
</p>
<p>find privacy protection in the U.S. to be mainly 
</p>
<p>industry self-regulated. One central role is 
</p>
<p>hereby occupied by the Federal Trade Com-
</p>
<p>mission (FTC) which protects customer privacy 
</p>
<p>in the U.S. and handles violations of the Fed-
</p>
<p>eral Privacy Act. On the other hand, Germany 
</p>
<p>as a member of the EU protects customers&rsquo; pri-
</p>
<p>vacy by means of different governmental laws 
</p>
<p>and regulations. This has implications for com-
</p>
<p>panies such that in Germany it is not allowed 
</p>
<p>to contact customers via telephone (Cold Call-
</p>
<p>ing) or email (Unsolicited Emails) without their 
</p>
<p>prior consent. For multinational companies 
</p>
<p>operating in the U.S. and the EU, it is especially 
</p>
<p>difficult to comply with the requirements of 
</p>
<p>privacy protective frameworks in different 
</p>
<p>markets. CRM managers have to be aware of 
</p>
<p>customers&rsquo; privacy concerns and the respec-
</p>
<p>tive protective responses they might face. In 
</p>
<p>this regard, we identify three categories of cus-
</p>
<p>tomers&rsquo; reactions to privacy concerns, namely 
</p>
<p>the refusal or misrepresentation of informa-
</p>
<p>tion (Information Provision), the removal from 
</p>
<p>the respective company or the spreading of 
</p>
<p>&bull; How should companies compensate
</p>
<p>  their customers for providing data? &bull; How do consumers value their data?
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the monetary value they assign
</p>
<p>  to their personal data? How does it
</p>
<p>  depend on data type or sensitivity?
</p>
<p>&bull; Which factors influence consumers&rsquo;
</p>
<p>  willingness to provide their data?
</p>
<p>&bull; How do consumers perceive the
</p>

<p>&bull; How to convince consumers to

</p>
<p>negative word-of-mouth (Private Action) as 
</p>
<p>well as complaining to either the company 
</p>
<p>itself or a third party (Public Action). Although 
</p>
<p>customers&rsquo; privacy protective responses 
</p>
<p>pose a serious constraint on companies&rsquo; CRM 
</p>
<p>practices, intentions to respond to privacy 
</p>
<p>concerns do not always directly translate into 
</p>
<p>actual behavior&mdash;especially when it comes to 
</p>
<p>information disclosure. We also discuss this 
</p>
<p>phenomenon, the so-called privacy paradox. 
</p>
<p>In a concluding step, we list potential ramifica-
</p>
<p>tions for companies of customers&rsquo; privacy con-
</p>
<p>cerns in the context of CRM and give advice on 
</p>
<p>how responsible privacy protection practices 
</p>
<p>can be implemented in a company. Finally, we 
</p>
<p>propose some avenues for further research 
</p>
<p>in the context of data valuation from the firm 
</p>
<p>and consumer perspective.
</p>
<p> ? International Perspectives: Did You 
Know?
</p>
<p> 1. Although the EU applies a strict privacy 
</p>
<p>regime and often is a thought leader 
</p>
<p>in protecting its citizens&rsquo; personal 
</p>
<p>information, Asian governments are also 
</p>
<p>tightening the thumb screws on company 
</p>
<p>practices: Japan, for instance, has just 
</p>
<p>amended its data privacy law &laquo;APPI&raquo;, 
</p>
<p>which now poses theft or transfer of 
</p>
<p>personal information as a federal crime. 
</p>
<p>Companies or even single employees may 
</p>
<p>be charged with up to one year in prison or 
</p>
<p>a fine of 500,000 yen. South Korea, which 
</p>
<p>already has one of the strictest privacy laws 
</p>
<p>worldwide, also amended their legislation 
</p>
<p>in 2016, increasing fines for data breaches 
</p>
<p>and requiring consent by the information 
</p>
<p>subject to transfer data abroad (Global 
</p>
<p>Legal Group, 2016; Sidley, 2016).
</p>
<p> 2. In a survey among almost 10,000 
</p>
<p>corporate executives from 115 countries 
</p>
<p>it was reported that, on average, 
</p>
<p>each organization faces 10 incidents 
</p>
<p>endangering computer security every day. 
</p>
<p>That is an increase of almost 50% reported 
</p>
<p>two years earlier and a major threat to 
</p>
<p>private customer data. Most incidents are 
</p>
<p>related to global cybercrime by individual 
</p>
<p>professionals or competitors (PWC, 2014). 
</p>
<p>The average cost of a data breach has 
</p>
<p>risen to $3.8 million in 2015 (IBM, 2016).
</p>
<p> 3. The biggest threat to consumer privacy 
</p>
<p>today is the rise of the Internet of Things 
</p>
<p>(IoT). According to Gartner Research, 
</p>
<p>the IoT will consist of 26 billion units by 
</p>
<p>2020, sending and receiving a multiple 
</p>
<p>of the data generated by people today. 
</p>
<p>Security professional Josh Corman has 
</p>
<p>started a movement named &laquo;I Am the 
</p>
<p>Cavalry&raquo;, which serves as a sharing 
</p>
<p>platform for vulnerability research in the 
</p>
<p>areas of medical devices, automobiles, 
</p>
<p>home services and public infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>Researchers and hackers can share their 
</p>
<p>discoveries to make products more secure. 
</p>
<p>Tesla Motors has been operating a program 
</p>
<p>with a similar goal: it has given away 
</p>
<p>rewards for individuals uncovering security 
</p>
<p>issues in their software to make their 
</p>
<p>vehicles safer. As formerly integral products 
</p>
<p>increasingly rely on software components, 
</p>
<p>steps to prevent unauthorized access to 
</p>
<p>the code will become crucial not only for 
</p>
<p>consumer privacy but also product safety 
</p>
<p>(Gartner, 2014).
</p>
<p> ? Exercise Questions
 1. Please explain the role of public media as 
</p>
<p>a driver of customers&rsquo; privacy concerns.
</p>
<p> 2. The U.S. and Germany reflect two 
</p>
<p>different perspectives of customer 
</p>
<p>privacy regulation. Please state and 
</p>
<p>describe both perspectives and explain 
</p>
<p>their historical and cultural origin.
</p>
<p> 3. Imagine you are the manager of a U.S. 
</p>
<p>company selling apparel over the 
</p>
<p>Internet. What are the main privacy 
</p>
<p>regulations to be kept in mind when 
</p>
<p>selling to a German customer?
</p>
<p> 4. Please give examples for customers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>privacy protective responses and explain 
</p>
<p>the potential consequences for companies.
</p>
<p> 5. Please explain the phenomenon of the 
</p>
<p>privacy paradox.
</p>
<p> 6. What is meant by &laquo;data as currency&raquo;? 
</p>
<p>Where does such a development lead in 
</p>
<p>the long-run? What effect does this have 
</p>
<p>on data privacy and transparency of data 
</p>
<p>collection and usage practices?

</p>
<p>Overview
</p>
<p>Managing social media is delicate and often 
</p>
<p>associated with a considerable amount of 
</p>
<p>uncertainty. Unlike some of the more 
</p>
<p>traditional (push) marketing channels, social 
</p>
<p>media can only be controlled by the company 
</p>
<p>to a limited degree. Rather, consumers 
</p>
<p>process messages and experiences with a 
</p>
<p>brand in public, creating and advancing a 
</p>
<p>brand image that may or may not have been 
</p>
<p>intended by the messenger. Consequently, 
</p>
<p>social media platforms have developed into 
</p>
<p>highly visible touchpoints with a brand 
</p>
<p>driven, in large parts, by consumers them-
</p>
<p>selves. The rapid growth paired with the lack 
</p>
<p>of experience with and sound knowledge 
</p>
<p>about the mechanisms of this medium have 
</p>
<p>turned social media into a large gamble for 
</p>
<p>many companies.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there has been 
</p>
<p>substantial research about social media 
</p>
<p>phenomena throughout the past 10&nbsp;years, 
</p>
<p>which can help guide CRM activities and 
</p>
<p>structure the discussion. Company activities 
</p>
<p>on social media may be complex, but not 
</p>
<p>utterly unpredictable. Among the most 
</p>
<p>interesting topics for researchers and 
</p>
<p>practitioners has been the generation of 
</p>
<p>word-of-mouth. Social media provides a 
</p>
<p>means to quickly dissiminate and multiply 
</p>
<p>opinions and experiences. If something goes 
</p>
<p>&laquo;viral&raquo; it can easily reach audiences around 
</p>
<p>the globe that would otherwise take huge 
</p>
<p>advertising budgets to spread. Reaching 
</p>
<p>positive word-of- mouth and avoiding 
</p>
<p>negative word-of-mouth is thus among the 
</p>
<p>key goals of firms&rsquo; social media usage. 
</p>
<p>Quantifying the effects of such activities 
</p>
<p>remains difficult, however. Reaching some 
</p>
<p>users may be more beneficial than reaching 
</p>
<p>others. The measurement of marketing 
</p>
<p>activities thus still puzzles many firms and 
</p>
<p>researchers&nbsp;&ndash; especially so in the dynamic 
</p>
<p>environment of social media. This is why we 
</p>
<p>also lay emphasis on the topic of measuring 
</p>
<p>the effectiveness of marketing activities on 
</p>
<p>social media platforms.
</p>
<p>In summary, this chapter provides a 
</p>
<p>discussion on how CRM is being conducted on 
</p>
<p>social media. This is done by first identifying 
</p>
<p>how word-of-mouth on social media impacts 
</p>
<p>brands. Specifically, we discuss the impact with 
</p>
<p>respect to the intention to purchase and 
</p>
<p>intention to retransmit messages. Once we see 
</p>
<p>how brands can be influenced on social media, 
</p>
<p>we then discuss how to evaluate the ROI of 
</p>
<p>investing in social media channels. Then we 
</p>
<p>look at the specific effect of social media on 
</p>
<p>brand sales with respect to the entertainment 
</p>
<p>industry. Finally, we look at how social media 
</p>
<p>recommendations impact small businesses 
</p>
<p>through the use of social coupons.
</p>
<p>15.1  The Social Media Landscape
</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine a time before social media. 
From a business standpoint, this phenomenon, 
originally conceived as a way to connect with 
friends, has evolved rapidly into a multibillion- 
dollar industry. From a social standpoint, it has 
metamorphosed into a ubiquitous method of 
sharing pertinent news and personal information, 
locally and around the globe. The Digital in 2017 
Global Overview report places the number of global 
active social media users in January 2017 to be over 
2.7 billion. This represents a 37 percent penetration 
globally, and has increased by more than 21 per-
cent since January 2016. Similarly, the penetration 
of globally active mobile users is estimated at 34 
percent, representing nearly 2.5 billion active users 
</p>
<p>worldwide. This has witnessed a growth of over 30 
percent since January 2016 (Kemp, 2017). In light of 
these revealing numbers, it would be safe to say that 
social media has fundamentally altered the market-
ing landscape, and continues to do so.
</p>
<p>Whether on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, 
LinkedIn, or any other social media networking 
site, the landscape of social media has become 
vast and multifaceted, to the degree that the busi-
ness community now considers social media to 
be a necessary tool for generating and gathering 
information, connecting with customers, grow-
ing brand recognition and marketing new prod-
ucts. The Digital in 2017 Global Overview report 
estimated the total value of the global business-
to- consumer (B2C) e-commerce in 2016 to be in 
excess of $1.9 trillion, and the average revenue per 
</p>
<p> Chapter 15 &middot; CRM in&nbsp;Social Media</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>313 15
</p>
<p>user in the global B2C e-commerce in the same 
period to be over $1100 (Kemp, 2017). This indi-
cates the critical role played by social media in 
driving business around the world.
</p>
<p>Social media allows consumers to create user 
generated content (UGC) which enables them 
to connect with businesses and other consumers. 
Consumers are no longer passive recipients of mar-
keting messages, but are actively engaging with firms 
they buy from, as well as other consumers sharing 
their own insights from their personal experiences 
(Chu &amp; Kim, 2011). As of June 2017, Facebook, for 
example, had 1.23 billion users logging on daily&nbsp;&ndash; a 
9 percent increase from the previous year. This is an 
inarguably large number. Consider, for a moment, 
the population of the world of approximately 7.5 
billion people. Now consider that only 16 percent 
of the world&rsquo;s populations has access to internet, of 
which 14 percent is using Facebook.
</p>
<p>So what does this mean in the context of busi-
ness? It means five new profiles&nbsp; &ndash; of a business&rsquo; 
potential customers&nbsp; &ndash; are created on Facebook 
every second. It means 300 million photos&nbsp; &ndash; of 
potential services or products provided by firms&nbsp;&ndash; 
are uploaded daily. It means the &laquo;like&raquo; and &laquo;share&raquo; 
buttons&nbsp;&ndash; of potential products and services&nbsp;&ndash; are 
viewed across nearly 10 million websites daily. And 
it means 42 percent of those marketing for busi-
nesses assert Facebook is crucial to their business 
survival. Consider how when working across social 
media sites, the impact each social media site may 
have on a business. When all of the log- ins, photo 
uploads, content sharing and advertising activity 
is combined and measured from the nearly one 
hundred domestic and international social media 
networks and their billions of daily users, it is easy 
to understand the importance of social media, its 
influence on the modern world, and why its activ-
ity is important to a business&rsquo; success and failure.
</p>
<p>Consumers engage in a range of online activi-
ties, including product discovery and recommen-
dation, organizing and participating in discussions, 
and information sharing. To make sense of all these 
social media activities, it would be helpful to group 
them into five broad buckets&nbsp;&ndash; Online Interaction, 
Collaboration, Multimedia, Entertainment, and 
Reviews. Online Interaction includes social media 
avenues such as blogs, micro-blogs and social 
networking websites (e.g., LinkedIn, WordPress, 
MySpace and Twitter). For purposes of col-
laboration, typical avenues include Wikis, social 
bookmarking, and social news (e.g., Digg and 
</p>
<p>Wikipedia). Multimedia functions are typically 
used in activities such as photo/video sharing, 
live-casting, and producing online experiences on 
networks (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Skype and 
YouTube). Entertainment avenues produce vir-
tual worlds and online gaming, such as World of 
War Craft and Second Life. And finally, reviews 
on social media sites typically include consumer 
forums that contain question and answer sections, 
product and firm overviews, and the ability to 
rate and recommend experiences to other users. 
Of course, the ones listed here are only the popu-
lar functions of social media portals. Many niche 
social media applications and portals exist that are 
popular among the respective user communities.
</p>
<p>Across the social media landscape examples, 
users experience a perceived utility of what the 
scope of social media networks offer them. The 
longer users engage on social media, they develop 
a need to share mentality, which generates usage 
across a variety of social media platforms in var-
ied and unique mechanisms, therefore continuing 
the cycle of embedding social media usage into 
the cultural fabric. There is ample managerial 
evidence that consumer activities on social media 
influence purchase decisions of other consum-
ers. For example, a recent study by ODM group 
found that 74 percent of consumers rely on social 
networks to guide purchase decisions (Beese, 
2011), 43 percent of social media users purchase 
a product after sharing it on Pinterest, Facebook 
or Twitter (Vision Critical, 2013) and 58 percent 
of IT decision-makers use social media to learn 
from trustworthy peers (Maddox, 2013).
</p>
<p>When businesses tap into the social media 
landscape, they can immediately access a cus-
tomer base, who is willing to dialogue about 
products and services, and may already be doing 
so. Through the social media landscape, firms can 
begin to measure, build and track product and 
brand performance, sell, highlight and market 
products to specific audiences, as well as directly 
and poignantly plug in to interactions with cus-
tomers. But how do these elements come together?
</p>
<p>15.2  How Do Word of&nbsp;Mouth on 
Social Media Impact Brands?
</p>
<p>Industry studies report that on average, 3.8 billion 
daily conversations take place that involve a brand 
(Keller &amp; Fay, 2012), and marketing  managers 
</p>

</p>
<p> continue to invest in multiple ways to influence and 
understand consumer word-of-mouth patterns 
(Berger &amp; Schwartz, 2011). To better understand 
the consequences of online WOM on brands, a 
recent study investigated which types of WOM 
conversations are more or less likely to stimulate 
consumers&rsquo; intention to buy the brand or retransmit 
the received WOM conversation to others (Baker, 
Donthu, &amp; Kumar, 2016). The study was focused 
at the individual WOM conversation level, within 
each WOM conversation, where valence of the 
brand sentiment, the channel of the conversation&rsquo;s 
occurrence, and the strength of the social relations 
between those in the conversation was captured.
</p>
<p>At the aggregate-level, WOM analysis tends to 
assume that consumer impact of WOM is equal 
across WOM.&nbsp;Therefore, researchers have called for 
disaggregated analysis to test for different outcomes. 
This study complemented other research (e.g. 
Berger &amp; Iyengar, 2013) in demonstrating the asyn-
chronicity of offline communication channels and 
why people are more likely to talk about interesting 
brands online than offline. The study also explains 
why the richness of an offline conversation may 
increase a recipient&rsquo;s clarity of the WOM message, 
which may increase their willingness to retransmit. 
When we consider how a WOM episode from one 
consumer can subsequently influence other con-
sumers&rsquo; behavior through retransmission activities, 
it becomes even less clear whether negative word-
of-mouth (NWOM) or positive word-of-mouth 
(PWOM) truly has asymmetric influence.
</p>
<p>For example, when a person experiences a 
positive or negative interaction&nbsp;&ndash; with a service, 
or product&nbsp; &ndash; it is common to share the experi-
ence with others in personal and professional 
networks. On social media, it is not only easier 
for customers to share, but it is also expected for 
daily users to endorse, denounce, and review their 
experiences with brands and firms. The influence 
of WOM, its purchases and retransmissions, can 
have a direct correlation to a firm&rsquo;s return on 
investment (ROI). This cycles forward to predict 
brand sales and future purchases, which then 
loops back around to again influence WOM.
</p>
<p>15.2.1  Influence of&nbsp;WOM 
Conversations on&nbsp;Brands
</p>
<p>The influence of WOM can have a tremendous 
effect on a brand&rsquo;s cache. To analyze this influence, 
</p>
<p>Baker et&nbsp;al., (2016) analyzed nearly 186,775 con-
versations pertaining to over 800 brands during 
July 2006 and March 2010 through the TalkTrack 
proprietary database.
</p>
<p>WOM conversations about brands begin with 
indirect variables. A WOM giver will transmit 
information to a WOM receiver through certain 
properties pertaining to the conversation and 
the brand. The degree of strength of the social tie 
between the giver and receiver will determine how 
information is received. A strong social tie would 
typically be a spouse or partner, family member 
or friend. A weak social tie would typically be a 
co-worker, acquaintance or stranger. WOM can 
flow through both strong and weak social ties, but 
in different ways with different degrees of impact. 
In a WOM instance, whereas the properties of a 
conversation include the WOM channel, social 
tie strength and WOM valence, the properties of 
the brand include brand equity, the level at which 
people would tend to find the brand interesting 
or uninteresting to talk about with others, among 
others.
</p>
<p>Exchanging conversation content through 
WOM, includes neutral WOM conversations, 
which typically contain strictly informational con-
tent about a brand. Mixed WOM includes brand 
sentiment with both positive and negative ele-
ments. The WOM valence is the primary influence 
on purchase and retransmission intentions, derived 
from the conversation flow from givers and receiv-
ers and how emphatic, neutral or mixed the review 
is. Most brand conversations are positive, and lead 
to either PWOM or NWOM.&nbsp; Through offline 
channels, strong social ties demonstrate the high-
est percentages of social tie valence in outputs of 
positive, mixed, neutral and negative WOM trans-
missions. In online channels, strong social ties also 
output the highest percentage of WOM valence, 
but the effect is overwhelmingly smaller. Offline 
channels and face-to-face exchanges of WOM will 
have a greater impact than online WOM exchanges 
through both strong and weak social ties.
</p>
<p>In this study, the positive WOM exchanges 
were found to have a greater absolute effect on 
retransmission intentions. The ratio of PWOM 
to NWOM is approximately 7.16 to 1, meaning 
PWOM about a brand is more likely to be retrans-
mitted than NWOM.&nbsp;Positive experiences, there-
fore, are more likely to be shared across online and 
offline channels. This information contradicts what 
many managers believe about positive and negative 
</p>
<p> Chapter 15 &middot; CRM in&nbsp;Social Media</p>
<p/>

<p>315 15
</p>
<p>WOM.&nbsp;However, NWOM will have a greater effect 
on purchase intensions than PWOM.&nbsp;That means 
NWOM may prevent a  customer from purchasing, 
while PWOM will be more frequently discussed, 
rapidly transmitted at a greater rate, and this may 
lead to future purchases. The benefits of WOM 
on brands is that with strong social elements, and 
those that stimulate emotional responses, tend to 
be shielded somewhat from the adverse impact 
that NWOM may have on purchase intentions. 
Brands with high brand equity disproportionately 
benefit from WOM because of greater resulting 
purchase intentions. The more interesting brands 
disproportionately benefit from WOM by avoid-
ing the propagation of NWOM.
</p>
<p>15.2.2  Implications for&nbsp;Marketers
</p>
<p>Because WOM conversation properties tend 
to have different relationships with purchase 
and retransmission intentions, brand manag-
ers should carefully consider the types of WOM 
are most relevant depending on the immediate 
WOM objectives, or driving immediate pur-
chases, or influencing the spread of additional 
WOM.&nbsp; Marketers might want to find ways to 
mitigate the occurrence of mixed WOM con-
versations if the goal is to immediately influ-
ence purchases. Marketers might also want to 
encourage mixed WOM if the primary goal is 
to stimulate more WOM conversation trans-
missions. Marketing managers concerned with 
designing WOM marketing campaigns should 
know that WOM marketing is commonly dis-
cussed and frequently practiced in the context of 
eWOM (e.g., social media sharing, posting con-
sumer-generated content). Stimulating consumer 
engagement is recognized as an important metric 
of such campaigns. For example, on the annual 
Word of Mouth Marketing Association&rsquo;s awards is 
the Engagement Award. It is beneficial for mar-
keters to carefully consider how to implement 
WOM marketing that is designed to translate 
online sharing that will travel offline and promote 
engaging conversations. This is the best platform 
where the influence on intentions to purchase 
and retransmit is the most pronounced. WOM 
therefore can impact the customer&rsquo;s desired usage 
of a product or service, and possibly increase the 
usage of a product or service by other customers 
simply through sharing their experiences. Now 
</p>
<p>that we know WOM can spread and influence 
users of social media, let us examine how it can be 
used in a marketing campaign.
</p>
<p>15.3  Measuring the&nbsp;Return 
of&nbsp;Investment of&nbsp;Social Media
</p>
<p>With so many people worldwide participating 
in online social networks, influencing consumer 
preferences and purchase decisions through 
these networks and generating positive WOM is 
increasingly important for every marketer. Many 
enterprises are investing in social channels to 
create their brand through viral content, social 
media contests, and other engagement efforts. 
Their traditional campaigns are changing, too. 
Companies like Geico, Dell and eBay are adapting 
the traditional one-way advertising message and 
using it as a stepping stone to begin a dialogue 
with customers. Effectively building campaigns 
with social media strategies can develop oppor-
tunities for businesses to reap a healthy return on 
investment (ROI). So how can companies do this?
</p>
<p>A recent study found that by identifying social 
media users who are both influential and using 
them in marketing campaigns, companies can 
improve their ROI on social media campaigns 
(Kumar, Bhaskaran, Mirchandani, &amp; Shah, 2013). 
Specifically, this study answered four key questions:
</p>
<p> 5 How can an individual&rsquo;s influence be cap-
tured in monetary terms in a social network?
</p>
<p> 5 Is it possible to quantify the intangible ben-
efits to the brand generated through the halo 
effect of influencers in the social media?
</p>
<p> 5 What is the impact of an influential individ-
ual on social media on the company&rsquo;s bottom 
line, in monetary terms (i.e., profit), and in 
subsequent sales generated?
</p>
<p> 5 Can the intangible effect and monetary 
impact of a customer&rsquo;s influence be predicted 
ahead of time so that the firm can use these 
influencers to generate a profitable buzz in 
the future?
</p>
<p>15.3.1  Measuring the&nbsp;Influence 
of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Social Media User
</p>
<p>To answer these questions, the study developed 
two key metrics. First, the customer influence 
effect (CIE) metric, defined as the net influence 
</p>
<p>15.3 &middot; Measuring the&nbsp;Return of&nbsp;Investment of&nbsp;Social Media</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>316
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>wielded by a user (in a social network) in terms 
of his or her ability to spread positive or negative 
WOM through his or her direct and indirect con-
nections, was developed to measure the influence 
of an individual in a social network. The CIE is 
determined by taking into consideration three 
essential components regarding a WOM instance. 
They are: (a) whether there is a connection 
between two users, (b) if there is, was the receiver 
aware of the WOM message being spread? (c) If 
yes, did the receiver spread the message to other 
users? In other words, CIE refers to the net spread 
of an instance of WOM attributable to an indi-
vidual user in a (social) network. The CIE is also 
dependent on data pertaining to the user, the type 
of network in which the communication occurs, 
the contents of the message, and how much the 
message appeals to the user for it to spread.
</p>
<p>Second, to link the influence of an individual 
to the monetary value contributed, the customer 
influencer value (CIV) metric was developed. The 
CIV metric is defined as the monetary gain/loss 
realized by the firm that is attributable to a cus-
tomer&rsquo;s influence effect. To compute the CIV, the 
store-level sales were integrated with the corre-
sponding social network, message and influencer 
social graph through tracking tags and dynami-
cally generated coupon codes. The monetary 
value attributed to an individual whose influence 
resulted in sales for a set of customers is used to 
compute the CIV.&nbsp; Subsequently, the drivers of 
influential behavior in a social network (i.e., net-
work and WOM characteristics, and purchase 
characteristics) were identified.
</p>
<p>15.3.2  What Drives the&nbsp;Influencers?
</p>
<p>Businesses can use the drivers of influential 
social media behavior to locate all the influencers 
throughout the desired social media platforms so 
that the brand, product, or service can be com-
municated to have the maximum reach. The study 
found some of the drivers of influence to be:
</p>
<p> 5 Activeness compatibility, or the number 
of times the influencer and their network 
friends &laquo;see and share&raquo; a message.
</p>
<p> 5 Host clout, or the number of user connections 
and number of users &laquo;following&raquo; an influencer.
</p>
<p> 5 Talkativeness of receiver, or how often 
the influencer&rsquo;s message is retweeted and 
&laquo;hashtagged&raquo;.
</p>
<p> 5 Generosity, or the like-mindedness and simi-
larities shared by the influencer with their 
network friends.
</p>
<p>Identification of such drivers enables companies 
to move beyond simply &laquo;listening&raquo; to conversa-
tions on social media platforms, to actively engag-
ing in the identification of brand ambassadors.
</p>
<p>15.3.3  Creating a&nbsp;Successful Social 
Media Campaign
</p>
<p>When implemented correctly, social media strat-
egies can drive profit from positive WOM.&nbsp; This 
can be achieved by a clear &lsquo;call-to-action&rsquo; that 
encourages users to engage in a behavior such as 
clicking the &lsquo;Like&rsquo; button, or sharing (re-tweeting) 
the posts. Kumar and Mirchandani (2012) suggest 
that a seven-step framework will help identify and 
recruit influencers (individuals who are influen-
tial on social media) so that businesses can pro-
mote social media WOM about their product or 
service (see . Fig.&nbsp;15.1).
</p>
<p> Step 1: Monitor the&nbsp;Conversations
</p>
<p>Businesses must monitor and capture relevant 
social media conversational exchanges by cus-
tomers and analyze them with respect to the con-
text to glean information on customer behavior, 
customer influence and brand awareness. They 
should also make sure that they do not violate any 
rules and regulations in the process of monitor-
ing, capturing and analyzing conversations.
</p>
<p> Step 2: Identify Influential Individuals 
Who Can Spread Messages
</p>
<p>After monitoring and recognizing the conversa-
tions, businesses should identity the &laquo;right&raquo; indi-
viduals who engage in these conversations. This 
can be achieved by identifying the specific factors 
that make the individual the right candidate to 
spread the message.
</p>
<p> Step 3: Identify the&nbsp;Factors Shared by 
Influential Individuals
</p>
<p>After identifying the &laquo;right&raquo; individuals (we refer 
to them as &laquo;influencers&raquo;), businesses should deter-
mine the common factors among them to create 
&laquo;influencer&raquo; profiles. Such forms of user profiles 
allow businesses to identify all the influencers, 
and design ways to encourage them to talk about 
</p>
<p> Chapter 15 &middot; CRM in&nbsp;Social Media</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>317 15
</p>
<p>the products/services. &laquo;Influencers&raquo; are seen to 
exhibit heavy social engagement in three aspects&nbsp;&ndash; 
(a) Message spread (the number of times a mes-
sage is forwarded by the receivers), (b) Influence 
(the number of times the message is forwarded to 
their friends), and (c) Social Impact (the number 
of comments/replies received for each message).
</p>
<p> Step 4: Locate the&nbsp;Relevant Potential 
Influencers
</p>
<p>Businesses can use the drivers to locate all the 
influencers throughout the desired social media 
platforms so that the brand/product/service can 
be communicated to have the maximum reach. 
Identifying these drivers call for a careful analysis 
of each type and instance of the WOM and how it 
spreads that can be used to locate all the influencers.
</p>
<p> Step 5: Recruit the&nbsp;Influencers 
for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Campaign
</p>
<p>Businesses must enlist the influencers in the 
social media campaign(s) to spread positive 
WOM.&nbsp; Recruitment of such influencers is pos-
sible by providing users ways to interact online 
and spread positive WOM that can be tracked and 
measured (e.g., survey and online games).
</p>
<p> Step 6: Incentivize those Influencers 
to&nbsp;Spread Positive WOM
</p>
<p>The next step is to engage the influencers to spread 
positive WOM and this can be done by incentiv-
izing the influencers. The incentivized diffusion of 
positive WOM can help businesses retain custom-
ers, attract prospects, and further identify poten-
</p>
<p>tial brand ambassadors. Businesses can choose 
to offer tangible, intangible or a combination of 
them for the incentives.
</p>
<p> Step 7: Reap the&nbsp;Rewards 
from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Social Media Campaigns
</p>
<p>Following the above prescribed steps will enable 
businesses to measure effectiveness of their social 
media campaigns with more accuracy than before. 
Associating conversations and positive WOM to 
brand recognition and product sales will result in 
businesses seeing a quantifiable increase in finan-
cial performance, increased customer engage-
ment and stronger brand awareness.
</p>
<p>15.3.4  Social Media Performance 
at Hokey Pokey
</p>
<p>When each of the following aspects are utilized 
at the firm and customer level&nbsp; &ndash; social media 
ROI, brand and customer-level metrics, customer 
influence effect (CIE) and customer influencer 
value (CIV)&nbsp;&ndash; they factor into the business impact. 
When an Indian ice cream business Hokey Pokey 
launched a social media campaign to connect 
with customers and grow its presence on social 
media, it was somewhat unprecedented in India.
</p>
<p>Over a period of 6 months, the social media 
environment was examined in the city where 
Hokey Pokey had the most outlets and potential 
for generating and influencing purchase deci-
sions. Kumar et&nbsp; al., (2013) monitored 825,091 
conversations involving 1736 individuals across

</p>
<p>various social networking sites on Hokey Pokey, 
and identified influential individuals in the local 
market who could spread Hokey Pokey&rsquo;s messages 
based on three parameters: Number of times an 
individual&rsquo;s messages were forwarded by recipi-
ents; number of connections that those messages 
jumped; and the number of comments and replies 
the users received for each message.
</p>
<p>Based on these characteristics and the ease of 
data collection, the study zeroed in on Facebook 
and Twitter as suitable platforms for this study. To 
help increase WOM, the study implemented strat-
egies to engage customers, &laquo;Creations on the Wall&raquo; 
and &laquo;Share Your Brownies.&raquo; These two stages of 
the campaign encouraged the influencer recruited 
for the campaign to make custom ice- cream cre-
ation at any of the Hokey Pokey parlors, identify 
themselves with their creations and spread WOM 
via social media. Influencers could name their 
creations, pose with their creations, and custom-
ers coming into the parlor could browse the wall 
and purchase these creations or order from the 
regular menu. The &laquo;Share Your Brownies&raquo; section 
of the campaign was aimed at generating a viral 
spread of ice cream creations by allowing custom-
ers an opportunity to be personal with Hokey 
Pokey products. When customers tweeted their 
creations, they were incentivized with prizes, such 
as T-shirts. Each creation was shared with all the 
Hokey Pokey locations. When customers made 
purchases of the special creations, the influenc-
ers were given &laquo;Brownie Points,&raquo; which were also 
redeemable for prizes.
</p>
<p>The campaign implementation at Hokey 
Pokey was effective at both the company and the 
customer level. At the company level, the main 
impact was in the area of social media account-
ability. While most companies are still grap-
pling with social media accountability, the use 
of the CIE and CIV metrics gave Hokey Pokey 
an important competitive edge. Further, Hokey 
Pokey also had limited marketing resources to 
promote the business, yet they were determined 
to acquire and retain profitable customers and get 
the highest return possible on their investment. 
Hokey Pokey came up with a strategy to capitalize 
on social marketing, which allowed the company 
a platform to create a buzz about the store.
</p>
<p>At the customer level, being able to calculate 
the value of an individual&rsquo;s influence in a network 
and measure the monetary value of customer 
influences made it possible for Hokey Pokey to 
</p>
<p>greatly enhance the efficacy of their social media 
campaign. In evaluating the performance of the 
framework, we benchmarked Hokey Pokey&rsquo;s reve-
nue (based on ice cream sales) generated through 
Facebook and Twitter against the previous 16 
months&rsquo; performance metrics, including sales 
growth rate, ROI, number of positive and negative 
conversations, and number of repeat visits.
</p>
<p>Over a period of about 15&nbsp; months, Hokey 
Pokey&rsquo;s incremental revenue continued to climb, 
while campaign costs were kept low. Specifically, 
the study found that out of the total revenue gen-
erated from the &laquo;Share Your Brownies&raquo; campaign, 
about 23% was attributable to conversations 
on Twitter and about 80% was attributable to 
Facebook, with a 3% and 8% overlap between the 
two social networks. Profits with the campaign 
far exceeded what the store expected to earn if it 
had chosen not to participate in the social media 
campaign. As a result of the campaign on social 
media, Hokey Pokey realized increases of 40 per-
cent in sales revenue growth rate, as well as an 
83 percent increase in social media ROI and a 49 
percent increase in brand awareness. In addition, 
the company saw a greater number of PWOM 
instances each week, an increase of sales related to 
custom creations, and increases of repeat custom-
ers making more than two purchases a week.
</p>
<p>15.3.5  Implications for&nbsp;Developing 
Social Media Campaigns
</p>
<p>The implementation at Hokey Pokey describes the 
application of these metrics in the case of an offline 
retailer (localized setting and small business). The 
same strategy can be extended to online retailers 
also. Several social media networks like Facebook, 
Twitter and Google&nbsp;+&nbsp;to name a few have imple-
mented seamless sign-in so that online retailers 
can allow their customers to sign-in using social 
media accounts, which makes tracking conversa-
tions easier. However, despite the vast amount of 
individual and relationship data available through 
these media, organizations have been unable to 
directly and efficiently measure the effectiveness of 
their social media strategy using tangible metrics.
</p>
<p>Social media has both tangible and intangible 
values. The Hokey Pokey implementation clearly 
reveals a methodology to simultaneously measure 
the spread of influence and the impact of social 
media conversations. It also provided a way to 
</p>
<p> Chapter 15 &middot; CRM in&nbsp;Social Media</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>319 15
</p>
<p>convert abstract social media measures into mon-
etary gains that can be easily understood by busi-
nesses. For the first time, social media marketers 
have a tool that can be readily implemented as 
social platforms evolve towards openness. The 
CIE and CIV measures presented arms chief mar-
keting officers (CMOs) with new metrics that can 
be used to communicate concrete business and 
monetary gains to the board room compared to 
former intangible measures like engagements and 
hits. It is therefore clear that the value gains posted 
by Hokey Pokey were impressive. Given that one 
brand benefitted significantly from a social media 
marketing campaign, can social media help mul-
tiple brands?
</p>
<p>15.4  Impact of&nbsp;Social Media on 
Brand Sales in Entertainment
</p>
<p>When examining brands and marketing trends, 
the music industry is both economically impor-
tant and culturally relevant. The industry is com-
prised of music artists (brands) offering their 
music (products) to listeners (consumers). Social 
media interactions have a significant influence on 
a consumer&rsquo;s listening and purchasing habits. On 
Twitter, seven of the top ten accounts on Twitter 
are musicians. Consider the music industry in the 
United States from the standpoint of the promi-
nence and ubiquity of its entertainers. Across new 
and established entertainers, many (if not most) 
of these entertainers have social media networks 
as a tool to connect with fans and followers, and 
potential consumers of their brand and products. 
In the music industry, social media activities such 
as sampling, following and commenting may 
influence brand sales.
</p>
<p>Recently, the phenomenon of how consum-
ers engage with brands on social media and 
how it influences their purchase process was 
studied by Saboo, Kumar, and Ramani (2016). 
Specifically, the study aimed to investigate the 
inter- relationship between social media behaviors 
and their impact on music sales.
</p>
<p>Drawing on two theoretical foundations&nbsp;&ndash; the 
social identity theory (SIT) and the brand attach-
ment theory&nbsp;&ndash; this study provided arguments for 
the consumer-brand interaction. The SIT suggests 
the self-concept comprised a personal identity 
that relates to the idiosyncratic personality attri-
butes that are not share by others. A social iden-
</p>
<p>tity is derived from knowledge of memberships 
to different social groups or organizations. Social 
identity relates to the identification with a group 
and predicates on the desire for self-definition, 
identification with an individual is argued to be 
predicated on the desire to appease, emulate or 
vicariously gain the qualities of others. A person 
may identify with a group because their iden-
tity is similar to their own. SIT has been used in 
marketing to explain brand communities, such as 
Harley Owners Groups, where members engage 
in collective behaviors to showcase their favorite 
brands.
</p>
<p>Human brands, similarly, make consumers 
feel appreciated, empowered, and autonomous, 
and beget strong emotional attachments with 
their consumers. The consumer-brand emotional 
attachment creates an environment where groups 
collect and evolve and create a social identifica-
tion for the individual. Human brands are the 
loci for group-level identification, and can been 
seen interacting on social media, official websites, 
forums and other sites. On Facebook alone, a typ-
ical Katy Perry post generates over 400,000 likes, 
6000 comments and 3000 re-shares, reaching 
millions of users. These two theories formed the 
theoretical backdrop to understand the relation-
ship between social media interaction and human 
brands.
</p>
<p>Using the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, data 
was analyzed over a 73-week period contain-
ing 36 music artists. Social media metrics were 
obtained from the artists to see how their social 
media campaigns allowed them to meet a thresh-
old of popularity on the Billboard charts, which 
included radio and streaming activity, as well as 
weekly sales. The data on the social media activi-
ties that were collected included: (a) the number 
of times music is played from a brand&rsquo;s (artist&rsquo;s) 
social media web page (referred to as SPLAYS), (b) 
the number of people who publicly Like, Follow, 
or Subscribe to the brand on a social media web-
site in a given period (referred to as SFANS), and 
(c) the number of online comments posted on the 
social media web page of an artist in a given period 
(referred to as SWOM). For the three social media 
activities, the study advanced hypotheses that 
were empirically tested.
</p>
<p>The modeling framework for relationships 
between social media attributes and brand sales 
is comprised of plays, fans and WOM.&nbsp; Plays is 
defined as the number of views or visits to an 
</p>
<p>15.4 &middot; Impact of&nbsp;Social Media on&nbsp;Brand Sales in&nbsp;Entertainment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>320
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>artist&rsquo;s media page. Fans is the number of people 
who &laquo;Like,&raquo; &laquo;Follow,&raquo; or &laquo;Subscribe,&raquo; to an artist. 
And WOM is the number of comments posted on 
an artist&rsquo;s social media page. The control variables 
would be the number of days since the last track 
or album was released by the artist, as well as the 
total number of albums released the artist since 
the start of their career. The effect of these social 
media attributes can categorically raise an artist&rsquo;s 
brand awareness and sales. A social sampling of 
Plays, combined with followers (Fans), and com-
ments (WOM) reinforce one another, such that 
the increase in one of the social media activi-
ties positively influence the other. An increase 
in brand sales, which typically accompanies an 
increase in awareness, has a positive influence 
on all three activities. An increase in the number 
of albums by the artist increases the odds of new 
consumers becoming aware of the artist or ener-
gizes existing fans thereby, increasing the likeli-
hood of following or commenting on the artist&rsquo;s 
social media websites. So the value of sampling 
decreases at a decreasing rate by reducing the con-
sumer&rsquo;s willingness to pay for the original, which 
then reduces overall sales. A social following has 
a positive effect on brand sales, and the attractive-
ness of a brand increases as the number of con-
sumers following a brand also increases. Finally, 
the value of social WOM increases at a decreasing 
rate when the positive relationship between social 
WOM and brand sales diminish at higher levels, 
thus becoming negative.
</p>
<p>Based on the analyses, the findings suggest 
that (a) the sampling of music reduces the appeal 
of the original, and reduces the overall sales, espe-
cially for digital goods such as music, (b) social 
following has a positive effect on brand sales, and 
(c) it is important to encourage participation on 
social media websites rather than focusing only 
on the number of followers.
</p>
<p>The implications of this study for the industry 
is pertinent. For instance, this study demonstrated 
that artists should carefully evaluate the benefits 
of sampling (concert attendance, merchandise 
sales, radio playtime, and so on) against lost 
sales. Further, brand managers should focus their 
energies on engaging their existing followers and 
striking the right level of consumer engagement. 
Brands need to keep refreshing their portfolios by 
introducing new offerings while effectively man-
aging their social media activity. Additionally, 
</p>
<p>while product sampling literature highlights that 
sampling can produce measurable long-term 
effects on sales, this study showed that such effects 
are not universal. Now that we know social media 
is a powerful way to promote a brand and engage 
with customers, let us examine a common social 
media marketing method that may not be as ben-
eficial to a firm.
</p>
<p>15.5  Social Coupons
</p>
<p>Coupons, discounts and sale windows have long 
been a part of the American culture, which prides 
itself on participating in cost-leadership purchas-
ing models. In a digital and social media format, 
sale scavenging and couponing isn&rsquo;t much dif-
ferent. Consumers bargain hunt for the best deal 
on websites featuring discounted gift certificates 
that are usable at local or national retail outlets. 
Groupon, Living Social, and Snapdeal are all 
online leaders in social couponing. These websites 
are popular because they provide savings oppor-
tunities ranging from 50 to 90 percent, while pro-
vide a price-reduction incentive to try products 
and services they might normally be hesitant to 
purchase. Consumers pay for the coupon before 
redeeming the product or service, and businesses 
offering the coupon pay the service provider 
(Groupon, for example) nearly 50 percent of 
the revenue generated from the redeemed cou-
pons. This provides the business an opportunity 
to acquire and retain customers and potentially 
increase profit.
</p>
<p>Despite the popularity, social coupon offers 
have resulted in financial losses for several busi-
nesses offering them and/or angering existing 
customers. Given all the attention that social 
coupons are receiving (and too much attention, 
in some cases), several questions arise. Are social 
coupons helping or hurting the small and medium 
businesses? Are social coupons profitable for the 
businesses offering them? Can a tool that enables 
businesses to acquire and retain more customers 
also nurture profits? Or, is there something funda-
mentally wrong with the current business model 
of social coupons and if so, how can they be fixed?
</p>
<p>To answer these questions, it is important to 
consider customer acquisition and retention (the 
two key outcomes of a social coupon campaign) 
from a customer management viewpoint. When 
</p>
<p> Chapter 15 &middot; CRM in&nbsp;Social Media</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>321 15
</p>
<p>making decisions about allocating resources for 
marketing efforts, it is common for businesses to 
target customers who are inexpensive (easier) to 
acquire and inexpensive (easier) to retain. Such 
decision making have been shown to overempha-
size the short-term gain of acquiring and retain-
ing low value customers, over targeting customers 
who are going to be most profitable in the long 
run (Thomas, Reinartz, &amp; Kumar, 2004). In addi-
tion, by focusing on either short-term acquisition 
or retention, businesses fail to look at the bigger 
picture of balancing acquisition and retention 
together.
</p>
<p>Since businesses are presented with the option 
of launching social coupons as an easy and fast 
way to acquire and retain customers, they are 
often quick to seize the opportunity and launch 
a social coupon. And making such easy-way-out 
decisions makes businesses shortsighted in terms 
of customer acquisition, retention and profit-
ability. Therefore, it is important to ascertain the 
viability of social coupons as a strategy to aid 
businesses on customer acquisition, customer 
retention and increased profitability.
</p>
<p>Research has shown that social coupons in 
their current form are not ideally suited to ensure 
customer acquisition and yield profits for the 
businesses (Kumar &amp; Rajan, 2012a). Specifically, 
this research answered the following questions:
</p>
<p> 5 Are social coupons profitable for businesses?
 5 What factors lead to a more (or less) profit-
</p>
<p>able social coupon launch?
 5 How can businesses strategically manage the 
</p>
<p>factors to maximize social coupon profit-
ability?
</p>
<p>The evidence suggests that to prevent social cou-
pons from cannibalizing regular profits, busi-
nesses can and should make adjustments to the 
nature of the deal to influence the profitability of 
social coupons.
</p>
<p>15.5.1  What Happens When Social 
Coupons Are Launched?
</p>
<p>Kumar and Rajan (2012a) analyzed the social 
coupon launches of an ethnic restaurant, a car 
wash service, and a beauty salon and tracked their 
subsequent performance for the next 12&nbsp;months 
to ascertain the effectiveness of social coupons 
</p>
<p>in customer acquisition, customer retention and 
generating incremental profits. The study deter-
mined whether the social coupon campaign 
resulted in growing profits, what factors worked 
for/against the businesses in acquiring and retain-
ing customers, and the changes required to the 
social coupon format to ensure profitability. Each 
of the three businesses operated within a five-mile 
radius and relied heavily on social coupons to 
attract new customers. Based on a one-year per-
formance of the respective campaigns, the study 
forecast the future performance of social coupons 
to help gauge the long-term business effects of the 
campaigns (see . Fig.&nbsp;15.2).
</p>
<p>With respect to the retention rates of new cus-
tomers for each of the businesses, all three busi-
nesses had a retention rate of 70%. However, there 
were minor variations in the way the businesses 
retained the new customers. In effect, the study 
found that:
</p>
<p> 5 The ethnic restaurant will not have any new 
customers to retain in Month 19 (assuming 
the coupon was launched in Month 1), and 
therefore have to, if at all possible, recover the 
shortfall in profits by Month 18.
</p>
<p> 5 The car wash business will have 140 new 
customers that availed the coupon visit them 
every month.
</p>
<p> 5 The beauty salon will have 31 new custom-
ers that availed the coupon visit them every 
month.
</p>
<p>Based on the retention rates of the new custom-
ers and the business generated by them, the study 
then computed the time each business would take 
to recover the shortfall in profits incurred during 
the coupon launch. The results indicated that:
</p>
<p> 5 The restaurant will be able to recover only 
$1164 or 12% of the shortfall in profits.
</p>
<p> 5 The car wash business will be able to recover 
the shortfall in profits between Month 15 and 
Month 16. Consequently, any revenue and 
profit generated after Month 16 is pure profit 
for the business and can be directly attributed 
to the acquisition of new customers.
</p>
<p> 5 The beauty salon will be able to recover the 
shortfall in profits between Months 98 and 
99. Therefore, from Month 99 onward the 
business can start to see incremental revenue 
generation from the launch of the social 
coupon.

</p>
<p>These results highlight the inadequacy of social 
coupons in serving the short- and long- term objec-
tives of the businesses. First, the significant losses 
after the coupon launch created a huge financial 
burden on the businesses. This was a major setback 
to the financial health of the businesses. Second, 
despite their best marketing efforts, the businesses 
were not able to retain any of the new customers 
that visited them. As a result, their progress of 
recovering the profit shortfall was greatly reduced 
or, in the case of the ethnic restaurant, even cut 
short. Finally, the dismal results of the campaigns 
discouraged the businesses from considering any 
further coupon launches until they recovered the 
shortfall in profits.
</p>
<p>While the social coupon model may seem 
attractive to businesses, often small business prof-
its will decrease from participating in this model 
alone. What actually happens to the business is 
that by providing deep discounts to the consum-
ers and experiencing higher redemption rates 
than it might through traditional coupons or free 
standing inserts (FSI), the business will pay a high 
amount to the social coupon service provider 
for carrying the coupon on its website, while not 
necessarily retaining any new customers. Those 
purchasing the coupons, therefore, may only be 
driven back to the service or product at the same 
rate or lower as the one purchased on the coupon.
</p>
<p>15.5.2  How to&nbsp;Ensure Profitability 
in&nbsp;Social Coupon Campaigns?
</p>
<p>On its own, social couponing may be a beneficial 
option for the consumer, as well as the social cou-
pon provider, who benefits from the profits of the 
small businesses. But businesses participating in 
social couponing must use a greater scope of cre-
ativity if using social coupons to increase profits. 
Kumar and Rajan (2012b) present some general 
guidelines that can help businesses in identifying 
and avoiding the pitfalls of social coupon launches 
and ensure a profitable launch.
</p>
<p> Customer Acquisition Does Not 
Always Lead to&nbsp;Profits
</p>
<p>Businesses typically opt for social coupon 
launches to add new customers to their clientele. 
The three businesses we studied were no excep-
tion. Such a philosophy does not always lead to 
profits. Our analyses have revealed that for every 
new customer visiting the business due to the cou-
pon launch, the business incurs additional short-
fall in profits. This surprising result is because 
even though new customers account toward an 
increase in the customer base, the loss incurred 
by the business in &laquo;acquiring&raquo; them (through 
offering deep discounts and a share in revenue to

</p>
<p>the coupon service provider) far outweighs the 
benefits of having them.
</p>
<p>However, businesses have the opportunity to 
mitigate this negative effect. One way to achieve 
this would be to up-sell and/or cross-sell other 
products/services during a customer visit. If busi-
nesses manage to increase the revenue contributed 
by a new customer by charging them full prices 
on the other items, then they could potentially 
reduce the shortfall in profits or even prevent 
it. But, not all businesses can up-sell/cross-sell 
their offerings. In fact, despite extra marketing 
efforts the three businesses we worked with were 
not able to successfully up-sell/cross- sell that 
could make the customer visit profitable. This is 
because the customer buying the coupon does so 
for a specific purpose and redeems it only for that 
product. However, there may be other businesses 
that could possibly cross-sell some of their other 
services to the customer and make the customer&rsquo;s 
visit a profitable one. For instance, a business 
providing roofing services can cross-sell its gut-
ter installation and cleaning services. Similarly, a 
massage studio can cross-sell some of its health 
and wellness products to all its customers. In this 
regard, the decision to launch a social coupon is 
likely to be viewed as part of a broader business 
strategy than as a specific marketing tactic.
</p>
<p> Deep Discounts Could Become 
Dearer to&nbsp;Businesses
</p>
<p>The attraction of social coupons is largely in the 
deep discounts they provide to consumers. While 
the low price could be viewed as an incentive for 
customers to try out the product/service offer-
ings, eventually the new customers will expect to 
pay the same low price as they continue to trans-
act with the business. As a result, any increase in 
the price is likely to be viewed by the new custom-
ers as a reason to take their business elsewhere. 
After all, no one would be willing to pay a higher 
price for the same product/service. In effect, with 
several businesses across many industries taking 
to social coupons the high level of discounts tends 
to make consumers deal-prone and buy items 
only through social coupons. The deal-seeking 
behavior conditions consumers to buy items only 
when they are on deals, reduces their switching 
costs and possibly disengages them from the busi-
ness&nbsp; &ndash; all having significant negative effects on 
customer loyalty. Further, the high redemption 
rates of social coupons (compared to traditional 
</p>
<p>coupons) in combination with the deep discounts 
can hurt the financial performance of businesses. 
Therefore, it is important for businesses to under-
stand that aiming to acquire customers by provid-
ing huge discounts is not likely to be a sustainable 
proposition.
</p>
<p>To prevent or reduce the losses from a coupon 
launch, it is imperative that businesses revisit the 
existing setup of social coupons and change the 
discount structure. One way to do this is to launch 
a coupon that would be valid only on lean busi-
ness days. Most service oriented businesses would 
encounter Fridays and the weekends as their 
busiest part of their work week and Tuesdays and 
Wednesdays as their lean days. Instead of offer-
ing coupons that can be redeemed at any day of 
the week, businesses should consider launching 
coupons that are valid on only their lean busi-
ness days. This would not only keep the customer 
acquisition efforts going, but also ensure that 
the businesses do not incur losses during their 
busiest time of the week. For instance, the eth-
nic restaurant that we corresponded with is now 
offering dinner buffets at a 30% discount (down 
from a 50% discount) only on Tuesdays and 
Wednesdays, as these 2 days are their lean days. 
The initial results due to this change in coupon 
offerings have been promising for the restaurant.
</p>
<p> Social Coupons Can Cannibalize 
Revenue from&nbsp;Existing Customers
</p>
<p>Given that the primary motive of launching a 
social coupon is to attract new customers, busi-
nesses would not want their existing customers 
to avail the coupon. The reality, however, is far 
from this expectation. When existing customers 
also avail the social coupon, it presents a possi-
bility of businesses cannibalizing their regular 
profits. By launching social coupons, businesses 
run the risk of inviting their existing customers to 
pay discounted prices for the same products/ser-
vices they have been paying full prices. This not 
only cuts into the profitability of the businesses 
but also could encourage deal-seeking behavior 
among their existing customers.
</p>
<p>For instance, a family-owned toy retail chain 
in Kansas City recently launched a social coupon 
that attracted nearly 3000 customers. After the 
launch of the coupon, the retailer observed that 
out of the 2000 coupons that were redeemed, 
many shoppers bought only the minimum worth 
of merchandise to redeem the offer, contrary to 
</p>
<p>15.5 &middot; Social Coupons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>324
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>the store&rsquo;s expectation that shoppers would pick 
up an extra toy car or doll once they walked into 
the store. After giving the share of revenue to 
the online coupon company, the retailer found 
that it lost money on about 75% of its coupon-
related sales. Additionally, the retailer observed 
that roughly 90% of the coupons were redeemed 
by existing store customers (Ovide, 2011). While 
this is just one example, it does make a case for 
revisiting the structure of social coupons.
</p>
<p>One way to circumvent the problem of exist-
ing customers redeeming the coupons is to tar-
get the social coupon only at prospects, and not 
at existing customers. When existing customers 
do not receive the social coupon, the subsequent 
savings in profit shortfall are significant. That way, 
businesses can ensure that the social coupons are 
used for the intended purpose&nbsp; &ndash; acquiring new 
customers and consequently retaining them. 
Some businesses have already recognized this 
facet and are offering social coupons only to new 
customers. When businesses keep track of new 
customers visiting them and focus such offers 
only at prospects, the chances of them acquir-
ing new customers and improving profitably are 
greatly increased. However, the three businesses 
tracked in the study had not realized the negative 
impact of existing customers redeeming the cou-
pons and therefore, and focused solely on efforts 
to popularize the coupon launch. They reasoned 
that with more customers signing up for the cou-
pon, they would only profit from the increased 
customer visits. This is where the network effects 
of group buying had actually proved harmful for 
the businesses rather than helping them.
</p>
<p>By changing the nature of the coupon deals, 
businesses can better control the number of new 
customers visiting them, the effect on profit mar-
gins of the discounted purchases, and the num-
ber of existing customers taking advantage of the 
offer.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we have examined the social 
</p>
<p>media landscape and how social media can 
</p>
<p>and does influence, and in some ways, drive 
</p>
<p>the business world. This occurs not only for 
</p>
<p>customers, who are buying products and 
</p>
<p>services from firms, then sharing, liking and 
</p>
<p>discussing them on global social media 
</p>
<p>networks. Social media also behooves busi-
</p>
<p>nesses, in that it allows firms to grow and 
</p>
<p>manage their brand, directly interact with 
</p>
<p>customers, as well as market new products 
</p>
<p>and services to a targeted customer base. 
</p>
<p>The influence of WOM, which is the essence 
</p>
<p>of social media, has become paramount for 
</p>
<p>businesses. It can both help and hurt sales 
</p>
<p>and have an impact on a company&rsquo;s brand. 
</p>
<p>Social media offers a variety of benefits for 
</p>
<p>companies and can translate into a healthy 
</p>
<p>ROI when used strategically. The chapter also 
</p>
<p>discusses the evolution of social coupons for 
</p>
<p>small businesses and the pitfalls that some 
</p>
<p>businesses enter into when using the dis-
</p>
<p>counted product and service method on its 
</p>
<p>own, without any cross- selling, or up-selling 
</p>
<p>tactics in addition to the coupon. Social 
</p>
<p>media is an inescapable aspect of operating 
</p>
<p>a business in the present and future, but it 
</p>
<p>must be recognized that there is a right way 
</p>
<p>to engage on social media to grow a com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s brand, build a wider, loyal customer 
</p>
<p>base and increase future sales.

<p> ? International Perspectives: 
Did You Know?
</p>
<p> 1. The vast amount of information that users 
</p>
<p>publish on social media can be translated 
</p>
<p>into valuable insights if leveraged well. 
</p>
<p>When British multinational banking 
</p>
<p>and financial service provider Barclays 
</p>
<p>launched its banking app PingIt that 
</p>
<p>allows users to transfer money, it used 
</p>
<p>sentiment metrics to analyze the valence 
</p>
<p>and content of users&rsquo; comments posted 
</p>
<p>on social media. The diagnosis found 
</p>
<p>a common pattern&nbsp;&ndash; many users were 
</p>
<p>complaining about the inability to 
</p>
<p>transfer money to people under the age 
</p>
<p>of 18. On this insight, Barclays CRM-team 
</p>
<p>could quickly react upon and improve 
</p>
<p>the app. Thus, by sensibly leveraging 
</p>
<p>information from social media, Barclays 
</p>
<p>management unearthed valuable 
</p>
<p>opportunities for improving their service 
</p>
<p>(Harpham, 2016).

<p>CRM activities to new heights is Dutch 
</p>
<p>Airline KLM.&nbsp;Following the eruption of 
</p>
<p>Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull in 2010 
</p>
<p>that brought about the largest air-traffic 
</p>
<p>shut-down since WW2 affecting more 
</p>
<p>than 10 million travelers, KLM turned 
</p>
<p>to social media to handle the flood of 
</p>
<p>customer requests. Since then, KLM has 
</p>
<p>drastically increased the size of its social 
</p>
<p>media team to handle customer inquiries 
</p>
<p>on Facebook and Twitter. Today, KLM 
</p>
<p>is one of the most active companies 
</p>
<p>on social media, responding to more 
</p>
<p>than 97% of questions with an average 
</p>
<p>response time of less than 90&nbsp;min 
</p>
<p>(Socialbakers, 2016). A key philosophy of 
</p>
<p>KLM&rsquo;s social CRM strategy is the one-stop 
</p>
<p>shop: Instead of responding with generic 
</p>
<p>answers and links to its main homepage, 
</p>
<p>the social media team posts messages 
</p>
<p>tailored to the specific request of the 
</p>
<p>customer. In this way, customers can 
</p>
<p>directly receive information e.g. on the 
</p>
<p>conditions of their specific ticket, lost 
</p>
<p>items and are even able to complete 
</p>
<p>the entire booking process for a flight or 
</p>
<p>upgrade simply by posting a message on 
</p>
<p>KLM&rsquo;s social media sites. This allows KLM 
</p>
<p>to delight their customers with a superior 
</p>
<p>service experience and ensures that it 
</p>
<p>does not lose customers in the depth of 
</p>
<p>the internet (KLM, 2017).
</p>
<p> ? Exercise Questions
 1. If you were a business owner, would you 
</p>
<p>choose to participate in a social coupon 
</p>
<p>discount? Why or Why not? How would 
</p>
<p>you ensure your coupon offer did not 
</p>
<p>result in financial hardship, or profit loss?
</p>
<p> 2. Why might a company like Hokey Pokey 
</p>
<p>choose to market their products across 
</p>
<p>social media networks, rather than 
</p>
<p>traditional channels of advertising? Do 
</p>
<p>you agree or disagree?
</p>
<p> 3. How important is it for a business to 
</p>
<p>have a social media network account on 
</p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or another 
</p>
<p>popular site? Would there ever be a time 
</p>
<p>a business shouldn&rsquo;t utilize social media 
</p>
<p>to market, manage their brand or attempt 
</p>
<p>engage with customers?

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>Delta Airlines had long been operating a cus-
</p>
<p>tomer loyalty program that computed the accu-
</p>
<p>mulated frequent-flier reward points solely on 
</p>
<p>the basis of the total number of miles flown by 
</p>
<p>a customer (Kumar &amp; Ramani, 2003). The loyalty 
</p>
<p>program did not differentiate between those 
</p>
<p>customers who pay economy class fares and 
</p>
<p>those who pay business class fares, to fly the 
</p>
<p>same distance. From a profitability viewpoint, 
</p>
<p>this program was misaligned. Delta Airlines&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>loyalty program was clearly not based on the 
</p>
<p>customer&rsquo;s value to the firm. No wonder, then, 
</p>
<p>this program was recently replaced with one 
</p>
<p>that differentiated between customers paying 
</p>
<p>for different fare classes. Now, a customer flying 
</p>
<p>business class gets 50% more points than does 
</p>
<p>a customer traveling economy class. This new 
</p>
<p>approach recognizes customers who are more 
</p>
<p>profitable to the firm need to be rewarded more.
</p>
<p>General Motors revised the redemption 
</p>
<p>scheme on its 10-year-old GM card in 2002. The 
</p>
<p>maximum amount of earnings a customer can 
</p>
<p>redeem toward the purchase or lease of a new GM 
</p>
<p>car, truck, or SUV now depends on the year, make, 
</p>
<p>and model chosen. This move is similar to the one 
</p>
<p>adopted by Delta, in that a customer who spends 
</p>
<p>on a premium product is rewarded more than a 
</p>
<p>customer who purchases a low-end product.
</p>
<p>There seems to be two complementary 
</p>
<p>reasons why firms are becoming unabash-
</p>
<p>edly profit- oriented in their approach toward 
</p>
<p>customer rewards programs. First, firms are in a 
</p>
<p>better position, thanks to technology, to record 
</p>
<p>customer actions and ascertain their individual 
</p>
<p>profitability levels. Thus, firms no longer use 
</p>
<p>surrogate measures like unit volume of busi-
</p>
<p>ness, share of wallet, and duration of associa-
</p>
<p>tion to reward their customers. Let us examine 
</p>
<p>the share of wallet measure some firms use to 
</p>
<p>decide on customer- level investments. Share of 
</p>
<p>wallet (SOW) is defined as the ratio of the total 
</p>
<p>customer spending with the firm to the total 
</p>
<p>category spending (the firm plus its competi-
</p>
<p>tors) for that customer. It is clear that achieving a 
</p>
<p>large SOW a low-spending client may not be as 
</p>
<p>good as achieving a low SW of a high- spending 
</p>
<p>client. Thus, firms do not need to continue using 
</p>
<p>surrogate measures because the drawbacks 
</p>
<p>inherent in these measures can now be over-
</p>
<p>come by concentrating directly on individual 
</p>
<p>customer profitability. Second, customers realize 
</p>
<p>they can no longer expect a firm to believe they 
</p>
<p>are special if they are not genuine high-value 
</p>
<p>buyers. Differential treatment of customers is 
</p>
<p>therefore being accepted as a way of life by both 
</p>
<p>firms and customers. However, differential treat-
</p>
<p>ment can work for a firm in the long run, only if it 
</p>
<p>has an eye on the future. The challenge for a firm 
</p>
<p>today is to develop an optimal blend of differen-
</p>
<p>tial levels of treatments such that over every cus-
</p>
<p>tomer&rsquo;s lifetime, the profits earned by the firm 
</p>
<p>are maximized. Not every firm understands how 
</p>
<p>to develop a strategy which balances customer 
</p>
<p>relations and profitability.
</p>
<p>The level of sophistication of the adoption of 
</p>
<p>the customer value metric approach into a firm&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>marketing program could vary. A firm operating 
</p>
<p>a loyalty program can start using the customer 
</p>
<p>value metric to examine whether the customers 
</p>
<p>being rewarded are indeed the profitable ones. It 
</p>
<p>should take corrective action if it finds that such 
</p>
<p>is not the case. At the next level, a firm can begin 
</p>
<p>to observe when its customers are beginning to 
</p>
<p>turn unprofitable. The firm can decide to let go of 
</p>
<p>these customers without wasting further efforts 
</p>
<p>on them. Moving up another level, a firm could 
</p>
<p>determine the factors likely to affect how long a 
</p>
<p>customer is likely to stay profitable. This enables 
</p>
<p>the firm to control and manage the variables 
</p>
<p>necessary to increase a customer&rsquo;s profitability. 
</p>
<p>At the next level, a firm can plan investments in 
</p>
<p>marketing initiatives on the basis of an analysis 
</p>
<p>of expected profits from its customers during a 
</p>
<p>given planning period. A firm can achieve the 
</p>
<p>next level of sophistication by understanding the 
</p>
<p>impact of changing the frequency of its market-
</p>
<p>ing communication elements on the profitability 
</p>
<p>of each customer. In this manner it can allocate 
</p>
<p>its resources optimally across marketing initia-
</p>
<p>tives, by cutting down on wasteful efforts and 
</p>
<p>increasing the frequency of effective efforts, 
</p>
<p>one customer at a time. At the next level, a firm 
</p>
<p>can predict the timing of purchase of each of 
</p>
<p>the products in its portfolio and tailor the com-
</p>
<p>munication message around the product likely to 
</p>
<p>be next purchased by a customer. Mathematical 
</p>
<p>models necessary to carry these levels of analy-
</p>
<p>ses and predictions have been developed in the 
</p>
<p>CRM literature (Venkatesan &amp; Kumar, 2004).

</p>
<p>16.1  Measuring Customer 
 Profitability
</p>
<p>Successful marketing initiatives are contingent 
upon the firm having a good understanding of 
how their actions affect customers. This becomes 
difficult for firms since their customer base is 
dynamic and involves interplay of several market-
ing variables such as tenure of the customers with 
the firm, profitability of the customers, purchase 
behavior over time, adoption of multiple channels 
to purchase, and demographic factors governing 
purchase behavior, among others. With so many 
inputs making up individual customer profiles 
how can firms expect to offer effective marking 
initiatives to attract the largest number of desir-
able customers?
</p>
<p>Management has access to a tool, which takes 
into account all of these inputs and allows seg-
mentation based on future profitability. The met-
ric is known as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). 
By using CLV as the primary planning tool for 
marketing initiatives, firms can ensure that they 
only target those customers who have the most 
future value to the company. From this they can 
optimize scarce marketing resources and ensure 
the future profitability of the firm.
</p>
<p>Customer Lifetime Value is defined as follows:
 5 The sum of cumulated future cash flows&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>discounted using the weighted average cost 
of capital (WACC)&nbsp;&ndash; of a customer over their 
entire lifetime with the company (Kumar, 
2007, 2008).
</p>
<p>In other words, CLV is a multi-period evaluation 
of a customer&rsquo;s value to the firm, and it assists 
managers to allocate resources optimally and 
develop customer-level marketing strategies.
</p>
<p>16.1.1  Computing CLV
</p>
<p>To compute CLV, it is essential to consider the 
setting in which the customer&rsquo;s purchases are 
being made i.e., contractual and non-contrac-
tual. A contractual setting is one where the 
customers are bounded by a contract such as 
a cable TV subscription. On the contrary, in a 
non-contractual setting such as grocery store 
purchases the customers are not bounded by a 
contract. The business implication of these two 
</p>
<p>situations is that in a contractual setting, the 
firm gets stream revenue or fixed monthly rev-
enue through the subscription. But, in a non-
contractual setting, the stream revenue would 
be absent. Therefore, these differences will have 
to be included while computing CLV.&nbsp; To cover 
both the situations, CLV can be expressed in the 
following form:
</p>

</p>
<p> 5 Base GC&nbsp;=&nbsp;predicted base monthly gross con-
tribution margin
</p>
<p>As is evident from (Eq.&nbsp; 16.1), this formula can 
be applied in both the contractual and non- 
contractual settings. The baseline CLV repre-
sents the net present value of the future stream 
revenue from the customer. The augmented CLV 
represents the net present value of future cash 
flows from a customer based on the products/
services purchased. In the case of a contractual 
business setting, the CLV would be the sum of 
the baseline CLV and the augmented CLV, since 
the customers will be contributing revenue to the 
firm by way of their monthly subscription. In the 
case of a non- contractual setting, the CLV would 
only be the augmented CLV, since the customer

</p>
<p>is not contractually obligated to contribute any 
monthly revenue to the firm. Now, let us look an 
example that can help us compute CLV in each 
setting.
</p>
<p>Consider the case of Amy, a customer of a 
mobile phone company. The monthly subscrip-
tion or the base GC provided by Amy is $40. At 
the end of May, the company wants to know the 
value Amy is likely to provide to the company 
in the next 4&nbsp; months (June, July, August, and 
 September). . Table&nbsp; 16.1 provides Amy&rsquo;s prob-
ability of buying additional services or p Buy
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>( )  
(such as downloads, ringtones, text messaging, 
etc.) for the next 4&nbsp;months, her monthly purchase 
amount, the percentage of margin for each pur-
chase, and the marketing cost incurred by the 
company in contacting Amy.
</p>
<p>Assuming an annual discount rate (r) of 12% 
(or 1% monthly rate), we can now compute the 
CLV of Amy for the next 4&nbsp;months. First, let us 
compute the CLV of Amy at the end of July using 
(Eq.&nbsp;16.1).

</p>
<p>Therefore, CLV
Amy, June
</p>
<p>&nbsp;=&nbsp;$36.9.
Similarly, we can compute the value Amy 
</p>
<p>would give to the company at the end of each 
subsequent month as follows&mdash;July: $33.2, 
August: $32.8, and September: $29.6. A summa-
tion of all the 4&nbsp;months&rsquo; CLV would yield a value 
of $132.5. In other words, over the next 4&nbsp;months 
</p>
<p>Amy would provide $132.5&nbsp;in value to the com-
pany through her subscription and additional 
purchases.
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp; 16.1 can also be used to explain the 
case of non-contractual purchases. Assume that 
. Table&nbsp; 16.1 indicates Amy&rsquo;s monthly cappuc-
cino purchases from her nearby caf&eacute;. However, 
this case will not have the monthly subscription 
or baseline CLV.&nbsp;Now, let us compute Amy&rsquo;s CLV 
at the end of July using (Eq.&nbsp;16.1).

</p>
<p>.( )
</p>
<p>Therefore, CLV
Amy, June
</p>
<p>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;$2.7.
In other words, Amy will be costing the caf&eacute; 
</p>
<p>$2.7&nbsp; in June by receiving marketing communi-
cation from the caf&eacute; and by being a part of their 
customer base. Similarly, we can compute the 
value Amy would give to the caf&eacute; at the end of 
each subsequent month as follows&mdash;July: &minus;$6.0, 
August: &minus;$6.0, and September: &minus;$9.0. A summa-
tion of all the 4&nbsp;months&rsquo; CLV would yield a value 
of &minus;$23.7. That is, over the next 4&nbsp;months Amy 
would cost the caf&eacute; $23.7&nbsp;in value by being its cus-
tomer. In other words, the amount spent by the 
caf&eacute; on marketing to Amy will be more than the 
revenue contributed by her to the caf&eacute;.
</p>
<p>Now that we have learnt the concept of CLV 
and how to calculate it, we need to clearly under-
stand the factors that drive a profitable rela-
tionship with the customer and how they affect 
CLV.&nbsp; The identification of drivers benefit the 
firm in (a) providing a better understanding of a 
profitable customer relationship, and (b) helping 
managers take proactive measures to maximize a 
customer&rsquo;s lifetime value.
</p>
<p>16.1.2  Drivers of&nbsp;CLV
</p>
<p>In order to successfully implement a market-
ing initiative based on CLV, management must 
understand the drivers of CLV and know how to 
measure those drivers. The drivers can be broadly 
classified into the following categories:
</p>
<p> 5 Exchange characteristics: Broadly, exchange 
characteristics are those variables which 
affect the customer firm-relationship.

<p> 5 Customer characteristics: These charac-
teristics refer to the demographic variables 
such as location of the customer, age, income 
levels, among others. In a B2B setting, these 
characteristics include variables such as 
industry, annual revenue and location of the 
business. In a B2C setting, these character-
istics include variables such as age, gender, 
spatial income and physical location of the 
customers.
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp; 16.2 provides an explanation of the 
exchange characteristics and its impact on B2B 
and B2C companies by recent studies.
</p>
<p>A clear understanding of the drivers listed 
above is essential for building and managing 
</p>
<p>profitable customer loyalty. Even as CLV is widely 
gaining acceptance as a metric to acquire, grow, 
and retain the right customers, managers often 
face the challenge of achieving convergence 
between marketing actions (e.g., contacts across 
various channels) and CRM.&nbsp;Once the computa-
tion of CLV is completed, firms can look forward 
to maximizing it so as to reap the full benefits of 
the metric. The rest of this chapter discusses the 
various strategies that firms can use to maximize 
customer lifetime value.
</p>
<p>The following sections in this chapter discuss 
several strategies based on empirical studies that 
demonstrate the importance of the Customer 
Value Metric in evaluating and monitoring a 
firm&rsquo;s profitability.

</p>
<p>16.2  The Lifetime-Profitability 
Relationship in a 
Noncontractual Setting
</p>
<p>16.2.1  Background and&nbsp;Objective
</p>
<p>A basic tenet of relationship marketing is that 
firms benefit more from maintaining long-term 
customer relationships as compared to short-
term customer relationships (Reinartz &amp; Kumar, 
2000). Convincing conceptual evidence for this 
argument has been advanced by a number of 
authors (Sheth &amp; Parvatiyar, 1995). Also, it has 
been shown that the relationship-marketing pay-
off to the firm comes only when relationships 
endure (Bendapudi &amp; Berry, 1997). In a widely 
quoted HBR article, Reichheld and Sasser state, 
&laquo;Customer defections have a surprisingly pow-
erful impact on the bottom line. As a customer&rsquo;s 
relationship with the company lengthens, profits 
rise (Reichheld &amp; Sasser, 1990).&raquo;
</p>
<p>While anecdotal evidence on the lifetime- 
profitability relationship seems to be plentiful, 
Reichheld and Teal&rsquo;s (1996) study seems to be 
the only well-documented empirical evidence to 
substantiate the hypothesized positive lifetime- 
</p>
<p>profitability relationship (Reichheld &amp; Teal, 
1996). Contrary to the anecdotal evidence that 
long-life customers are most profitable to the 
firm, Dowling and Uncles caution, &laquo;In short, the 
contention that loyal customers are always more 
profitable is a gross oversimplification (Dowling 
&amp; Uncles, 1997).&raquo;
</p>
<p>In particular, this study questions the existing 
contentions that the costs of serving loyal cus-
tomers are presumably lower, that loyal custom-
ers presumably pay higher prices, and that loyal 
customers presumably spend more with the firm 
than nonloyal customers. Obviously, the study 
shows concern with the widespread assumption 
of a clear-cut positive lifetime-profitability rela-
tionship and underlines the importance of a dif-
ferentiated analysis. Consequently, there seems to 
be a need for more rigorous empirical evidence on 
the lifetime-profitability relationship.
</p>
<p>Lifetime analyses have typically been con-
ducted in contractual settings (Bolton, 1998; Li, 
1995). Examples for this type of relationships are 
magazine subscriptions, cable service subscrip-
tions, and cellular phone services. In contractual 
settings, expected revenues can be forecasted 
fairly accurately and, given a constant usage of

</p>
<p>the service, one would expect increasing cumula-
tive profits over the customer&rsquo;s lifetime. However, 
in noncontractual settings, the firm must ensure 
the relationship stays alive because the customer 
typically splits his category expenses with several 
firms (Dwyer, 1997). Examples of noncontractual 
settings are department-store purchases or mail- 
order purchases in the catalog and direct market-
ing industry.
</p>
<p>Catalog marketing involves selling through 
catalogs mailed to a select list of customers. 
Consumers can buy almost anything from a cata-
log. More than 20 billion consumer catalogs are 
mailed out annually, and the average household 
receives nearly 200 catalogs a year (Valentino- 
Devries, 2011). In 2008, U.S. sales revenue 
attributable to direct marketing was estimated 
to surpass $2.158 trillion (Direct Marketing 
Association, 2007). In 2009, direct marketing 
accounted for 8.3% of total US gross domestic 
product. Also in 2009, there were 1.4 million 
direct marketing employees in the US.&nbsp;Their col-
lective sales efforts directly supported 8.4 million 
other jobs, accounting for a total of 9.9 million US 
jobs (Direct Marketing Association, 2009).
</p>
<p>In a noncontractual setting such as the cata-
log industry, specifically, a customer who starts 
to purchase in a given time period may then buy 
repeatedly at some irregular time intervals. If the 
time intervals are relatively longer, is it wise for 
the firm to assume this customer is likely to pur-
chase again in the near future, and, if so, to expect 
him to spend a certain amount of dollars? This is 
a necessary element for estimating customer life-
time value. Although duration seems like a simple 
concept, it can be complicated. The customer 
portfolios of many companies are composed of a 
small number of active customers&mdash;people who 
have regular and frequent interactions with the 
provider&mdash;and a large number of inactive cus-
tomers. Drawing the line is not easy, as inactive 
customers can become active customers in the 
future.
</p>
<p>In many cases, the actual duration of the rela-
tionship is not especially revealing due to normal 
fluctuations in customer activity over time. For 
example, direct mail publishers may learn more 
from the seasonal and life-stage variations in 
customer buying patterns than from the specific 
number of years the customer has been in the 
database. What appears on the surface to be dor-
mancy actually may be a naturally occurring pat-
</p>
<p>tern which will trigger purchasing when the next 
cycle comes around. Different customer segments 
may exhibit different patterns of attrition, switch-
ing, and reactivation (Wyner, 1999). The firm 
dealing with limited/finite resources must decide 
when it is appropriate to make contact (through 
mailing of catalogs or other means) with the cus-
tomer or stop contacting the customers. Given 
the cost implications, is it worthwhile to chase the 
dollars from some customers with longer lifetime 
duration?
</p>
<p>The research takes place in the context of the 
catalog and direct marketing industry. Given 
the contradictory statements and sparse empiri-
cal evidence available in the literature the main 
objective of this study is a rigorous and differenti-
ated empirical analysis of the lifetime-profitability 
relationship in a noncontractual context. In order 
to achieve this objective, we test for the following:
</p>
<p> 5 The strength of the lifetime duration- 
profitability relationship.
</p>
<p> 5 Whether profits increase over time (lifetime 
profitability pattern).
</p>
<p> 5 Whether the costs of serving long-life cus-
tomers are actually less.
</p>
<p> 5 Whether long-life customers pay higher 
prices.
</p>
<p>Once we understand what happens in the mar-
ketplace, then we can address why it happens 
that way. As data become available across dif-
ferent situations, empirical generalizations can 
be advanced. This is important, especially in the 
noncontractual setting, as the level of uncertainty 
for a firm is very high. An additional objective is 
to derive marketing implications from the find-
ings. That is, if distinct lifetime and profitability 
segments can be delineated, what implications 
can be derived for a customer management strat-
egy (i.e., tailored communication, early warning 
indicators, and so on)?
</p>
<p>16.2.2  Conceptual Model
</p>
<p>Individual customer lifetime profits are modeled 
as a function of a customer&rsquo;s lifetime duration. 
Revenue flows over the course of a customer&rsquo;s 
lifetime, and firm cost is associated with the 
marketing exchange. We want to investigate the 
consequences of customer retention namely, prof-
itability.

</p>
<p> Customer Lifetime and&nbsp;Firm 
Profitability
</p>
<p>We offer the following four propositions and 
subsequently test each one of the propositions in 
anon-contractual scenario.
</p>
<p>Proposition 1: The&nbsp;Nature 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lifetime- Profitability 
Relationship&nbsp;Is Positive
</p>
<p>Ongoing relationships in consumer markets have 
received substantial attention in recent years 
(Berry, 1995). The building of strong customer 
relationships has been suggested as a means 
for gaining competitive advantage (Reinartz &amp; 
Kumar, 2002). The underlying assumption of 
much of the existing research is that long-term 
relationships are desirable because they are more 
profitable for the firm, as compared to short-term 
relationships. Following this line of reasoning, 
we would expect a substantial positive asso-
ciation between the duration of a customer-firm 
relationship and the firm profits derived thereof. 
(At this point, we are concerned with the sign 
and strength of the relationship&mdash;a one-shot, ex 
post assessment. In addition, in P
</p>
<p>2
 we examine 
</p>
<p>the dynamics of the relationship over time) This 
is true for a contractual case; where there is no 
repeated cost to entice customers into buying. 
. Figure&nbsp; 16.1 summarizes this situation. In line 
with the argument, one would expect the majority 
of relationship outcomes to fall along the diago-
nal, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.1. In other words, one 
</p>
<p>would expect a substantial positive correlation 
between the two variables. Thus, an assessment of 
the numbers of customers falling into each quad-
rant, along with a simple measure of association 
between lifetime profits and lifetime duration, 
would readily yield some insight into the nature 
of the lifetime- profitability relationship.
</p>
<p>A factor that complicates the firm&rsquo;s objec-
tive of establishing long-term relationships with 
its customers is that of intrinsic ability to retain 
customers. Not all customers want to engage in 
a long-term relationship with the firm for many 
possible reasons. For example, in the long- 
distance telephone service market, many 10-10- 
xxx companies have emerged. There is no need 
to sign any contract with the service providers. 
Here, customers use a particular 10-10-xxx com-
pany, depending on the quality of service, unit 
price, and the speed of connection. As discussed 
before, to retain customers, it is important to sat-
isfy the customers. The satisfaction of customers 
may come at a significant cost to the company. 
In a noncontractual case like catalog shopping, a 
household might have to be sent many catalogs 
over a period of time before they decide to buy 
again. Thus, when the costs of satisfying custom-
ers exceed the profit margin offered by the cus-
tomer, the expected positive lifetime profitability 
relationship need not hold good. Also, some 
customers may be buying less from a catalog 
company due to competitive offerings, need for 
limited spending, or other reasons over a period

</p>
<p>of time. This forces companies in a noncontrac-
tual scenario to look at the spending levels of each 
of their customers.
</p>
<p>Firms should partition their customer base 
into behaviorally and attitudinally homog-
enous groups that spend at different levels (see 
. Fig.&nbsp; 16.2) and then estimate the profitability 
characteristics for each group. This grouping is 
considered appropriate by many managers in 
the direct marketing industry as they focus on 
the revenue generated by each customer over a 
period of time. Thus, the two dimensions&mdash;life-
time duration and revenues&mdash;may help managers 
to make better decisions. Irrespective of the seg-
mentation scheme, conventional wisdom argues 
for a positive relationship between profitability 
and time. Although the available evidence sug-
gests a positive lifetime-profitability relationship, 
it need not be true if the cost of serving the cus-
tomer is greater than the profit margin generated 
by the customer. In fact, there could be many cus-
tomers who may be receiving catalogs on a regu-
lar basis because they bought at least one item in 
the recent past, even though it may be of lower 
dollar value.
</p>
<p>Proposition 2: Profits Increase Over Time
</p>
<p>Although a measure of correlation is important 
and insightful; it presents only a static picture 
of the lifetime-profitability relationship. While 
related to proposition 1, the analysis of the 
dynamic aspects of the lifetime profitability rela-
tionship yields further important insights. The 
</p>
<p>important difference is that we analyze profits 
dynamically across time, whereas in proposition 
1 we analyze profits in a single lifetime measure 
across subjects. Recall that we mentioned finding 
evidence for increasing profits per time unit over 
the length of the customer&rsquo;s tenure. These argu-
ments elm be true for a contractual setting but 
need not hold good for a noncontractual scenario. 
In the case of catalog shopping or direct mail 
offerings, the customer may end up buying once a 
year and spending a small amount. If this pattern 
prevails, then the cost of serving this customer 
can easily exceed the profit margin brought in by 
the customer. Therefore, profits may not increase 
over time.
</p>
<p>Using the same long distance telephone ser-
vice example discussed under Proposition 1, there 
are several instances where the overhead costs of 
serving long-life customers are higher as com-
pared to the percentage of profit margin offered by 
the customer. It is necessary for a firm offering the 
10-10-xxx service to send monthly bills to all the 
customers who have started to use their service. 
Even if a customer does not use the service in a 
given month, that customer receives a bill. Here, 
the cost of serving the customer clearly exceeds 
the profit margin from the customer, and this loss 
becomes significant for the firm over a period of 
time and across many such customers. This type 
of phenomenon occurs in the credit card industry 
also. Thus, it is not obvious that profit for the firm 
increases overtime. Therefore, it is worthwhile to 
test this relationship.

</p>
<p>Proposition 3: The&nbsp;Costs of&nbsp;Serving 
Longer-Life Customers Are Lower
</p>
<p>Another commonly held contention is that long- 
life customers are less costly to serve than short- 
life customers. This is possibly true for contractual 
setting. But, for the broad retail sector, we would 
hardly expect lower transaction costs for longer- 
life versus shorter-life customers. For example, 
there is little reason to believe that transaction 
costs for a piece of garment in the second pur-
chase encounter with a firm is different from, say, 
the tenth purchase encounter.
</p>
<p>Other costs incurred over the course of a 
relationship are the costs of the promotional mix 
directed at each customer. In a noncontractual 
scenario such as the direct marketing context, 
promotional costs are typically the largest non-
product cost factor in a customer-firm relation-
ship. Following the commonly held contention, 
we would expect the cost of promotional expen-
ditures per dollar sales revenue is lower for lon-
ger-life customers. The reason would be that the 
promotional mix has a greater efficiency in rela-
tion to the longer- life customer. This is possibly 
due to cumulative effects or a more favorable atti-
tude toward the firm&rsquo;s communication. Thus, we 
propose that the cost of promoting to a customer) 
in relation to her revenues) is lower for long-life 
customers, yet, to our knowledge, there is no 
empirical evidence in the literature to substantiate 
this claim. Therefore, it will be interesting to test 
whether the costs associated with promotional 
expenditures directed at longer-and shorter-life 
customers actually differ.
</p>
<p>Proposition 4: Longer-Life Customers 
Pay Higher Prices
</p>
<p>Previous research (Reichheld &amp; Teal, 1996) has 
argued that in most industries, existing customers 
pay effectively higher prices than new ones, even 
after accounting for possible introductory offers. 
This would imply that the average price paid by 
customers and the customer lifetime duration 
could be positively related.
</p>
<p>However, company managers told us that 
their informal experience suggests a higher value 
consciousness (i.e., lower average prices paid) for 
long-term customers. That is, if a customer buys 
more product units for a given dollar amount, the 
customer exhibits a higher degree of value con-
sciousness (i.e., wants more &laquo;bang for the buck&raquo;). 
</p>
<p>If this observation were true, it would contradict 
the existing evidence. A possible reason for higher 
value consciousness of long-term customers 
might be that customers learn over time to trust 
lower-priced items or brands rather than estab-
lished name brand products.
</p>
<p>Thus, there seems to exist some reasonable 
evidence for both possibilities. Therefore, instead 
of proposing a directional effect, we suggest to test 
this proposition empirically.
</p>
<p>16.2.3  Research Methodology
</p>
<p> Data
</p>
<p>Data from an established U.S. catalog retailer were 
used for the empirical estimation in this study. 
The items sold by the firm cover a broad spectrum 
of general merchandise. The firm&rsquo;s products are 
offered and can be purchased all year round. The 
data for this study cover a 3-year window and are 
recorded on a daily basis. Two key characteristics 
of this data set are that the customers are tracked 
from their very first purchase with the firm, and 
these households have not previously been cus-
tomers of the company. Consequently, the obser-
vations are not left-censored.
</p>
<p> A Model for&nbsp;Measuring Customer 
Lifetime for&nbsp;Noncontractual 
Relationships
</p>
<p>A critical component in our model is customer 
lifetime duration. The modeling process of a 
customer&rsquo;s lifetime is contingent on a valid mea-
surement framework that adequately describes 
the process of birth, purchase activity, and defec-
tion. Toward that end, we empirically implement 
and extend a procedure previously suggested 
(Schmittlein &amp; Peterson, 1994). Once the lifetime 
duration is computed for each customer, we can 
develop testable propositions dealing with life-
time duration based on conventional wisdom and 
past literature.
</p>
<p>We are using the negative binomial distribu-
tion (NBD)/Pareto model, which has been pro-
posed and validated in a previous study. The key 
result of the NBD/Pareto model is an answer to 
the question: &laquo;Which individual customers are 
most likely to represent active or inactive cus-
tomers?&raquo; This is a nontrivial question because 
the purchase activity is a random process and the

</p>
<p>defection is not directly observed. Based on the 
customer-specific probability of being alive, the 
model can be used to determine which customers 
should be deleted from active status. The outcome 
of the NBD/Pareto model, the probability that a 
customer with a particular observed transaction 
history is still alive at time T since trial, is of key 
interest to our modeling effort.
</p>
<p>Given that the outcome of the NBD/Pareto 
model is a continuous probability estimate, the 
continuous P(Alive) estimate is transformed into 
a dichotomous alive/dead measure. Knowing a 
person&rsquo;s time of birth (when the person became a 
customer) and given a specified probability level 
(threshold), we can approximate when a customer 
is deemed to have left the relationship. The time 
from birth, t
</p>
<p>0
, until the date associated with the 
</p>
<p>cut-off threshold, t
cut-off
</p>
<p>, constitutes the lifetime of 
the customer. . Figure&nbsp;16.3 illustrates the proce-
dure. This procedure allows us to calculate a finite 
lifetime for each customer, which then can be 
used for the profitability analysis.
</p>
<p>This discussion has been based on the assump-
tions that the time t
</p>
<p>0
 when the customer came 
</p>
<p>on file or when she executed the first purchase is 
known. Given the widespread existence of cus-
tomers&rsquo; databases in organizations, this assump-
tion is not difficult to meet.
</p>
<p>Establishment of&nbsp;Cut-off Threshold
</p>
<p>The choice of cut-off of the P(Alive) threshold c 
determines the length of the lifetime estimate for 
each customer. The cut-off threshold that pro-
duces the highest percentage of correct classifica-
tions is obviously the choice most consistent with 
the data. In this study, the threshold of 0.5 pro-
duces the highest percentage of correct classifica-
tions. As a result, for the purpose of the lifetime 
analysis, we use 0.5 as the cut-off threshold.
</p>
<p>Lifetime Estimation
</p>
<p>Based on the model and the implementation of 
the validation process, the final step in the analysis 
is the calculation of a finite lifetime estimate for 
each customer. The average lifetime across Cohort 
1 is 28.7&nbsp;months, and the average lifetime across 
Cohort 2 is 27.9&nbsp;months (. Table&nbsp;16.3). A cohort 
is a group of customers who started their relation-
ship at the same point in time (e.g., a particular 
month or quarter). Cohort 2 consists of customers 
who started the relationship with the firm 1&nbsp;month 
after Cohort 1. The consistency between the two 
cohorts is very high. In both cohorts, about 60% 
of the sample has a lifetime less than the observa-
tion window. Thus, the available observation win-
dow is obviously adequate for describing lifetime 
purchases of the given sample.

<p>and 0.0125&nbsp;=&nbsp;monthly discount rate (based

</p>
<p>The discount rate is set to 15%, which equals 
U.S. prime rate in 1999 plus 7%. Gross contribu-
tion GC
</p>
<p>ti
 is calculated from the monthly revenue, 
</p>
<p>which is the total household purchase amount 
for every month of the observation period. The 
monthly gross contribution is calculated on aver-
age as 30% profit margin of the monthly revenues. 
This is a rather conservative figure and reflects 
the firm&rsquo;s managerial judgment. Due to the wide 
assortment the firm offers, the calculation of an 
average profit seems reasonable. Furthermore, 
estimates of individual-item direct cost are not 
available within the firm. The cost component C
</p>
<p>ti
 
</p>
<p>constitutes the total cost of mailing catalogs and 
solicitations per month and per customer. These 
costs include catalog production cost, letter shop, 
and mailing costs. Individual customer mailing 
costs in the observation window vary between 
$2.5 and $111.1 for Cohort 1 (mean&nbsp;=&nbsp;$53.3) and 
$3.3 and $108.5 for Cohort 2 (mean&nbsp; =&nbsp; $57.6). 
Acquisition costs are not included since the 
company does not track them on a per-customer 
basis. Now that lifetime duration and profitability 
have been computed, we can proceed to test the 
propositions offered in this study.
</p>
<p> Test of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Propositions
</p>
<p>The analysis of the test of propositions does not 
include the acquisition costs for each customer, 
as the data are not available. If acquisitions costs 
were available they can be easily integrated into 
the proposed framework. If acquisition costs are 
somewhat similar across all customers, the find-
ings of the study hold good. For example, the 
acquisition costs for catalog companies to acquire 
a customer on the Web are $11, compared to $82 
for Internet-only retailers. If acquisition costs are 
so low for catalog companies, then the variation 
in acquisition costs across customers should not 
affect the results of this study (see: Quick, 2000).
</p>
<p>Proposition 1: The&nbsp;Nature of&nbsp;the 
Lifetime- Profitability Relationship  
Is Positive
</p>
<p>As . Fig.&nbsp;16.2 shows, using Profit as the dependent 
variable, one can segment the customer base with a 
median split of the independent variables Lifetime 
Duration and Lifetime Revenues. Thus, we will 
employ a median split and create a shorter and a lon-
ger lifetime halt and higher and lower revenue half.
</p>
<p>Obviously, we would expect the longer a custom-
er&rsquo;s tenure with the firm and the higher the revenues 
of a customer, ceteris paribus, the more profitable 
that customer would be in line with the relationship 
marketing literature, we would expect the custom-
ers falling into segment 1 to generate the highest 
profits. Likewise, customers in Segment 4 would 
be expected to yield the lowest profits. However, in 
addition to providing empirical evidence for these 
expectations, this segmentation scheme lets us test 
the importance of the off-diagonal segments to 
the firm. An analysis of the off-diagonal quadrants 
could provide an answer to an important question. 
Could we possibly encounter a situation where cus-
tomers with shorter tenure right actually be more 
profitable than long-term customers, a claim which 
runs counter to the theoretical expectations of a rela-
tionship perspective? Furthermore, which group of

</p>
<p>customers is of more interest to the firm, the one 
that buys heavily for a short period (Segment 3) or 
the one with small spending but with long-term 
commitment (Segment 2)? This is a particularly 
important question in combination with the size of 
the segments. That is, for example, if the total num-
ber of customers in Segment 1 were comparably 
small, it is imperative for the firm to pay very close 
attention to the characteristics of their second-most 
profitable segment. Naturally, the answer to this 
question is driven by whether revenues and contri-
bution margin are similar or dissimilar.
</p>
<p>Proposition 2: Profits Increase Over Time
</p>
<p>To test the proposition of increasing profits over 
time, we will (a) examine the profitability evolu-
tion visually and (b) analyze the sign of the slope 
coefficient. If profits were to increase over a cus-
tomer&rsquo;s tenure, we would expect a positive slope 
parameter for the same variable. In addition to 
the linear effect, a dummy variable is included for 
the first purchase period to reflect the large first 
month purchase amount. The exact specification 
of the regression is as follows:
</p>
<p>Profit a b Dummy b error
ts s s s s
</p>
<p>t= + &acute; + &acute; +1 2
</p>
<p>where t&nbsp;=&nbsp;month
 5 b
</p>
<p>1s
&nbsp;=&nbsp;regression coefficient
</p>
<p> 5 s&nbsp;=&nbsp;segment
 5 Dummy&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 if first purchase month, else 0
</p>
<p>The profit figures are derived for those custom-
ers who either have purchase activity in a given 
month and/or incur cost due to mailings in a 
given month. The dummy variable was included 
to achieve a better fit of the estimation because 
purchases in month 1 were considerably higher 
for all groups. This higher purchase could be the 
reflection of the novelty of the situation such as 
the new vendor, new goods, or new deals. As a 
result, the estimation better reflects the actual 
profit pattern beyond month 1.
</p>
<p>Proposition 3: The&nbsp;Costs of&nbsp;Serving 
Long-Life Customers Are Lower
</p>
<p>To test this proposition, we will compute the ratio 
of promotional costs in a given period over the 
revenues in the same period. Promotional costs are 
the total cost of producing and mailing promotions 
and catalogs, starting with the birth of the cus-
tomer. This varies for each customer, depending on 
</p>
<p>the purchase transaction history. Within each seg-
ment, the mean promotional costs are computed 
across all households, and then the costs are com-
pared across segments to see if the costs of serving 
longer-life customers are actually lower.
</p>
<p>Proposition 4: Longer-Life Customers 
Pay Higher Prices
</p>
<p>We test in our study whether longer-life custom-
ers do pay higher prices, as compared to shorter- 
life customers. Therefore, we will compare the 
average price paid across products and purchase 
occasions for each of the four segments. Next, we 
discuss the findings from the test of propositions.
</p>
<p>16.2.4  Empirical Findings
</p>
<p> What Is the&nbsp;Nature of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lifetime- 
Profitability Relationship?
</p>
<p>To test the strength of the lifetime-profitability 
relationship, the bivariate Pearson correlation 
between lifetime duration (in months) and life-
time profit ($) is calculated. The correlation coeffi-
cient r is 0.175 for Cohort 1 and 0.219 for Cohort 2, 
which means that only a moderate linear associa-
tion between lifetime duration and lifetime profits 
exists. Although a significant positive association 
(at α&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.05) in line with theoretical expectations 
clearly exists&mdash;overall, it seems weak. Clearly, life-
time duration alone does not explain very well 
overall lifetime profitability. Furthermore, when 
segmenting the customers in Cohort 1 using a 
median split, we find that 2530 out of 4202 house-
holds fall in the diagonal of . Fig.&nbsp; 16.2 (1322&nbsp; in 
the upper right quadrant; 1208&nbsp; in the lower left 
quadrant). That means a very substantive 39.9% of 
the customers fall into the off- diagonal quadrants.
</p>
<p>Thus, the large percentage in the off-diagonal 
quadrants signals a sizable segment (18.7%) that 
generates high profits even though the customer 
tenure is short, and another segment (21.2%) that 
generates low profits even though they exhibit 
long lifetime. Although our findings moderately 
support the theoretical predictions from the rela-
tionship marketing perspective, additional analy-
ses seem warranted to explain the apparently 
counterintuitive results. Specifically, we are inter-
ested in how much each segment con-tributes to 
overall profits. The goal is to optimally uncover 
the underlying relationship of lifetime with profit-
ability. . Table&nbsp;16.4 summarizes these results.

</p>
<p>Several results in . Table&nbsp;16.4 are remarkable. 
The first finding is that the average net present 
lifetime profit per customer is highest for Segment 
1 ($289.83). That is, customers who have long 
lifetimes and generate high revenues represent 
the most valuable customers to the firm. Of key 
interest however is the comparison of Segments 2 
and 3. Clearly, it can be found for this setting that 
customers in Segment 3 are, on average, far more 
profitable ($257.96) than customers in Segment 2 
($50.85). The mean profit for segment 3 is signifi-
cantly (a&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.01) different from the mean profit of 
segment 2. In terms of total segment profitability, 
the short-lived Segment 3 generates 29.2% of the 
total cohort profits. Thus, while long-term cus-
tomers in Segment 1 are obviously important to 
the Firm, short-term customers in Segment 3 are 
also important because they generate more than a 
quarter of the total cohort profits.
</p>
<p>Thus, this is a case where both long-term cus-
tomers (Segment 1) and short-term customers 
(Segment 3) constitute the core of the firm&rsquo;s busi-
ness. Likewise, we find the relationship between 
lifetime and profits can be far from positive and 
monotonic. Consequently, an implication for 
managers is that a firm strategy focusing on rela-
tional buyers only as opposed to transactional 
buyers would clearly be disadvantageous.
</p>
<p>Another very interesting outcome of the analy-
sis is that in terms of relative profit (i.e., profit per 
month), customers in Segment 3 are the most 
attractive of all (. Table&nbsp;16.4, . Fig.&nbsp;16.4). Segment 
3 customers purchase with high-intensity, thus gen-
erating higher profits in a relatively shorter period 
of time. Thus, in terms of sustaining cash flow, they 
play a vital role for the firm. The mean relative profit 
for each segment is significantly different from the 
other segment at least at α&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.05 (using the multiple 
comparison test). The profits per month for longer-
life segments are shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.5, which cap-
ture the implications discussed so far.
</p>
<p>One needs to speculate on the reasons for 
this interesting pattern of results. Obviously, 
Segment 1 customers are the most desirable set 
for the firm-representing the loyalty effect at its 
best. These customers&rsquo; desires are likely to be 
matched well by the firm&rsquo;s offerings overtime, 
and they are more likely to be habitual mail-order 
buyers. For Segment 3 customers (high revenue 
but short lifetime), we still suspect a good match 
between offerings and desires, but we assume that 
their relationship duration is complicated by sev-
eral moderating factors. For example, consumer 
 factors such as an intrinsic transactional buying 
behavior, the execution of a limited set of planned 
purchases, are less of a typical mail-order buyer,

<p>or a higher susceptibility to competitor&rsquo;s offers. 
We suspect that it has less to do with product 
or service dissatisfaction since they spend at a 
high level. Dissatisfaction might rather occur for 
Segment 4, whose customers spend the lowest 
amount. Although we highlight the speculative 
nature of these inferences, it seems worthwhile to 
search for the underlying consumer motivations.
</p>
<p> Do Profits Increase Over Time?
</p>
<p>To test the proposition of increasing profits over 
time, we first examine the profitability evolution 
visually. . Figures&nbsp;16.4 and 16.5 show the lifetime 
</p>
<p>profitability plots for the four segments. A visual 
inspection of the charts reveals three of the four 
segments actually exhibit decreasing profits over 
time. Only for Segment 2 (long life, low revenue) 
we find a slightly positive trend in the profitability 
evolution.
</p>
<p>For a more formal test, we compare the sign 
and significance of the time coefficient from the 
regression analysis of profits as a function of time. 
The results are presented in . Table&nbsp;16.5. With the 
exception of Segment 2, we generally find that the 
coefficient for the linear effect has a negative sign, 
thus highlighting the negative profit trend over

for time are significant at α&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.01.
</p>
<p>It is not uncommon that proponents of rela-
tionship marketing mention that profits due to 
loyal customer are higher in each subsequent 
period. This is typically the case for contractual 
settings where a firm derives most or all of the 
business of a customer&mdash;for example, for life 
insurances or health club memberships. However, 
for noncontractual settings this might be differ-
ent. For some products and services this is clearly 
not the case (e.g., there is no reason to believe 
people bring more and more clothes to their dry 
cleaner over time).
</p>
<p>The theoretical claim is that loyal customers 
enter a virtual cycle where satisfaction with trans-
actions in previous periods feed not only into 
loyalty in future periods but also a reinforcement 
and growth in firm profits. The counter forces to 
this virtual cycle are, for example, variety seeking 
across firms, customers getting tired of interact-
ing with the same firm, firms&rsquo; competitive actions, 
and the fact that no contracts exist. This nega-
tive relationship is also possible if the customer 
contact costs through mailing catalogs are high 
compared to the potential revenue from the sales 
realized from each customer.
</p>
<p>If costs exceed revenue, then over time, this gap 
can increase to a point where the negative relation-
ship is prevalent. Obviously, these counter forces 
are strong enough to block the theoretically exist-
ing virtuous cycle, there by leading to decreasing 
profits overtime. Even for Segment I, the long-life, 
high-revenue group, the theoretical expectation 
does not hold. Thus, our finding questions the 
general claim that loyalty is always desirable to 
achieve, because we do not find support for the 
underlying argument (i.e., that profits of long-life 
customers increase over time). However, loyalty 
might lead to increased profit over time if there 
is a forced ongoing relationship, an inertia-driven 
relationship, or if cost of maintenance decreases 
over time at a faster rate than revenue falls off.
</p>
<p> Are the&nbsp;Costs of&nbsp;Serving Long-Life 
Customers Lower?
</p>
<p>The objective was to test whether the cost associ-
ated with promotional expenditures directed at 
longer-and shorter-life customers differ. To test 
this argument, we compute the ratio of promo-
tional costs in a given period over the revenues in 
the same period for each segment. The segment 
</p>
<p>mean represents the dollar amount promotional 
cost necessary to sustain a dollar amount of reve-
nue. Results are shown in . Table&nbsp;16.4 for Cohort 
I and Cohort 2.
</p>
<p>The notion that customers with long tenure 
are associated with lower promotional costs is 
clearly rejected. The ratio of mailing cost per dol-
lar sales in the longer-life segment (Segment 1) is 
statistically not different from the mailing cost per 
dollar sales in the shorter-life segment (Segment 
3). This means, in terms of cost efficiency, that 
Segments 1 and 3 are the most attractive to the 
firm, although they have very different lifetime 
properties. Our findings show that the ratio of 
mailing cost and revenues&mdash;which is one measure 
of efficiency&mdash;need not necessarily be lower for 
long-life customers.
</p>
<p> Do Long-Life Customers Pay Higher 
Prices?
</p>
<p>We wanted to empirically test whether longer-life 
customers pay, on average, higher or lower prices 
for their chosen products as compared to custom-
ers in the short-life segments. We compute for 
each transaction the ratio of dollar spending over 
number of items purchased and average this figure 
across purchase occasions and customers within 
segments. Results are shown in . Table&nbsp; 16.4 for 
Cohort I and Cohort 2. The average price per item 
for segment 3 is significantly (α&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.05) different 
from (and greater than) that of segment I.
</p>
<p>The highest average price paid for a single 
product item is encountered in Segment 3, the 
short-life segment. Segment 3 spends, on average, 
8.04% (Cohort I) and 10.6% (Cohort 2) more on 
a single product as compared to Segment I.&nbsp;As a 
result, our observation of the higher value con-
sciousness of Segment I customers goes counter 
to the argument that long-life customers are less 
price-sensitive. It is, in fact, the highly profitable 
short-term customer who seems to be less sensi-
tive to the product&rsquo;s price. One possible expla-
nation for the behavior of Segment 3 customers 
could be that these are heavy users of the catalog 
but not all that brand focused. Thus, they might 
shop heavily from more retailers and switch more 
easily for smaller benefits, since for these custom-
ers even a small benefit may have a large value. 
Therefore, the higher spending (average prices 
paid) by Segment 3 customers may be due to some 
other benefit sought by them. Thus, our empirical 
evidence showed four things:

</p>
<p> 5 A strong linear positive association between 
lifetime and profits does not necessarily exist.
</p>
<p> 5 A static and a dynamic lifetime-profit analysis 
can exhibit a much-differentiated picture: 
Profitability can occur for the firm from high 
and low lifetime customers. We discovered 
that, for our case at least, profits do not increase 
with increasing customer tenure, thereby add-
ing new empirical evidence to the domain.
</p>
<p> 5 The cost of serving long-life customers is not 
lower.
</p>
<p> 5 Long-life customers do not pay higher prices.
</p>
<p>16.2.5  Implications
</p>
<p>In this study, we showed a context where manag-
ers cannot simply equate a long-life customer with 
increased lifetime spending, with decreasing costs 
of serving, and with lower price sensitivity. When 
a firm examines its customer database, it should 
not be too surprised to find a significant set of 
customers who transact with the firm for a short 
while, but in that duration contribute handsomely 
to the firm&rsquo;s profits. A firm focused purely on 
rewarding and retaining customers on the basis of 
how long they have been with the firm may thus 
miss out on the opportunity to maximize returns 
from the higher-value, but shorter- lifetime cus-
tomers. Similarly, rewarding customers simply 
because they keep coming to your firm for most 
of their needs and do not conduct much busi-
ness with your competitors might also not be the 
shrewdest strategy to adopt in terms of profits.
</p>
<p>16.3  Model for&nbsp;Incorporating 
Customers&rsquo; Projected 
Profitability into Lifetime 
Duration Computation
</p>
<p>16.3.1  Background and&nbsp;Objectives
</p>
<p>No firm would want to waste its resources by chas-
ing customers who are not likely to be transacting 
profitably in the future (Reinartz &amp; Kumar, 2003). 
Deciding when to let go of an unprofitable cus-
tomer is critical. From a managerial standpoint, it 
would be extremely desirable to know, at any given 
time, whether it will be profitable to mail a catalog 
or send a salesperson to a given customer. If it is 
profitable, then the manager decides to mail the 
</p>
<p>catalog or initiate a personal contract, otherwise 
not. Based on this decision metric, it is possible 
to compute lifetime durations for each customer. 
Once profitable lifetime  duration is obtained for 
each customer, managers are interested in know-
ing the factors that drive the profitable lifetime 
duration. In response to this phenomenon, we 
conducted a study which presents an integrated 
metric for measuring profitable customer lifetime 
duration and assessing antecedent factors. The 
key research tasks were as follows:
</p>
<p> 5 Empirically measure lifetime duration for 
noncontractual customer-firm relationships, 
incorporating projected profits.
</p>
<p> 5 Understand the structure of profitable rela-
tionships and test the factors which impact a 
customer&rsquo;s profitable lifetime duration.
</p>
<p> 5 Develop managerial implications for build-
ing and managing profitable relationship 
exchanges.
</p>
<p>The research took place in the context of the 
direct marketing industry. Specifically, our 
research was conducted for one of the leading 
general merchandise direct marketers (business- 
to- consumer, or B-to-C, setting) in the United 
States. Furthermore, we validated the results with 
a customer sample from a high-technology firm 
(business-to-business, B-to-B, setting) selling 
computer hardware and software.
</p>
<p>16.3.2  A Dynamic Model of the 
Antecedents of&nbsp;Profitable 
Lifetime Duration
</p>
<p>In this section, we offer a metric to identify, for 
each customer, the time periods beyond which 
they may not be profitable. Toward that end we 
want to suggest a procedure for estimating the 
lifetime of customers and implementing this pro-
cedure empirically.
</p>
<p>Since the model describes and analyzes how 
and why duration times differ systematically 
across customers, it is a customer-level analysis. 
Since our approach exploits longitudinal informa-
tion obtained within customers, we refer to it as 
a dynamic model. . Figure&nbsp; 16.6 details the con-
ceptual framework that centers on the, focal con-
struct of profitable lifetime duration of customers. 
Profitable lifetime duration is conceptualized to be 
a function of the characteristics of the relationship.
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>347 16
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;16.6 not only illustrates how the cur-
rent study differs from the previous one, but also 
shows how the current study incorporates the 
findings of the previous study in the proposed 
framework&mdash;through the incorporation of rev-
enues and cost in measuring lifetime duration. In 
a nutshell, our research in the last section focuses 
on the consequences of lifetime duration, while 
the study in this section focuses on the anteced-
ents of profitable lifetime duration. Once man-
agers understand the important consequences 
of both longer and shorter lifetime duration 
(described in the first study), this study tells them 
how to incorporate those findings when deciding 
to stop chasing a customer.
</p>
<p>The first step involves determining the con-
tribution margin expected from each customer 
in future periods based on the average of the 
contribution margins in the past. The second 
step is to determine for each future period, the 
probability that the customer will be alive and 
will transact with the firm. The third step is to 
combine these two components. The fourth 
step is to discount the expected contribution 
margin in each future period to its net present 
value (NPV) using the cost of capital applica-
</p>
<p>ble to the firm. If, in a given month, the cost 
of additional marketing efforts turns out to be 
greater than the NPV, we determine that the 
profitable lifetime duration of the customer has 
ended.
</p>
<p>Although it is useful to know the profitable 
lifetime duration of each customer to determine 
when to withdraw marketing efforts directed at 
that customer, it is also important to understand 
the antecedents of profitable lifetime duration. 
This provides a manager with knowledge about 
the controllable and environmental variables that 
explain systematic differences in profitable cus-
tomer lifetime durations. With this information, 
a manager is able to focus on appropriate market-
ing initiatives likely to improve profitability dur-
ing the tenure of every customer. By analyzing 
and modeling variables for which data are readily 
available, a firm can determine which factors are 
significant in affecting customers&rsquo; profitable life-
time durations.
</p>
<p>The focus of our inquiry is on variables which 
determine the nature of the customer&mdash;firm 
exchange. Typically, we would need to choose 
predictor variables of two types to incorporate 
into the model:

expected to contribute significantly.

<p> Exchange Characteristics
</p>
<p>The model provides intuitive explanations for the 
expected effects of some of these variables. For 
instance, it is likely that the profitable lifetime 
duration of a customer is higher for a customer 
who has spent more than the others and thus has 
a higher value for the variable Amount purchased. 
Similarly; we can expect a customer who has a ten-
dency to buy across the product line of a firm and 
therefore exhibits a high Degree of cross- buying, 
should exhibit sustained profitability compared 
to other customers. Customers who demonstrate 
a moderate but stable time interval between suc-
cessive purchases (Interpurchase time) are likely to 
be profitable for a longer duration than customers 
who have long interpurchase intervals or those 
who burn out after a rapid series of purchases. 
Surprisingly, Number of product returns can relate 
positively to profitable lifetime duration, because 
heavier buyers are also likely to return more mer-
chandise, and a positive experience during the 
return procedure is likely to boost the buyer-seller 
relationship.
</p>
<p> Customer Heterogeneity
</p>
<p>Demographic variables that capture observed 
customer heterogeneity have been used consis-
tently high response modeling. The main moti-
vation to include these variables is for statistical 
control purposes, as well as for potential segmen-
tation purposes.
</p>
<p> Spatial Location of&nbsp;Consumer
</p>
<p>We would expect a higher proportion of long 
lifetime customers to live in low-density areas as 
opposed to high-density areas (i.e., cities).
</p>
<p> Income
</p>
<p>In general, customers with higher incomes are 
less susceptible to higher price sensitivity (Kumar 
&amp; Karande, 2000) and are expected to continue 
buying from the firm for the added convenience.
</p>
<p>16.3.3  Research Methodology
</p>
<p>The data we use for this research are the same 
data we used for the study in the last section. The 
use of the same data set is critical because we are 
trying to evaluate if our previous findings can be 
implemented successfully to determine which 
customers to let go and when to let go. In addition 
to the data from the two cohorts used in the last 
study, data from an additional cohort were also 
used. Thus, we can validate the results across three 
different sets of customers. Although the data are 
partiality the same for both studies, the studies 
have entirely different objectives.
</p>
<p> Database
</p>
<p>The data are provided by the same U.S. general 
merchandise catalog retailer, of which the char-
acteristics have been described in the last section. 
The data for this study also cover a 3-year window 
and are recorded on a daily basis, the database 
for the three cohorts consist of a total number of 
observations of 11,992 households. The sample of 
households belongs to three different cohorts, the 
structure of which is depicted in . Fig.&nbsp;16.7.
</p>
<p>The customer-firm interaction of Cohort 
1 households is tracked for a 36-month time 
period, the behavior of Cohort 2 households for 
a 35-month time period, and the behavior of 
Cohort 3 households for a 34-month time period. 
The households are sampled randomly from all 
households that started in January, February, and 
March 1995, respectively. The number of pur-
chases ranges from 1 to 46 across the sample with 
a median number of five purchases, the median 
interpurchase time is 117&nbsp; days, and the median 
transaction amount is $91 for each purchase.

<p>16.3.4  Determining Profitable 
Customer Lifetime Duration
</p>
<p> Calculate Net Present Value (NPV) 
of&nbsp;Expected Contribution Margin 
(ECMiJ)
</p>
<p>Given the nature of our data (and the data struc-
ture in the direct marketing industry in general), 
managers can easily determine past purchase and 
spending activity for each customer. Likewise, an 
estimate of the P(Alive) status, using the NBD/
Pareto model, can be obtained for both past and 
future periods. This allows us to establish the fol-
lowing decision rule: If the sum of the expected 
discounted future contribution margin were 
smaller than a currently planned marketing inter-
vention, we would establish the death event for the 
customer (A managerial consequence would be to 
stop mailing to that customer, even though this is 
not our primary concern.) More formally, we com-
pute the estimated future contribution margin:

, is the estimated expected contribution 
</p>
<p>margin for a given month t, AMCM
it
 is the average 
</p>
<p>contribution margin in month t based on all prior 
purchases since birth (updated dynamically), r is 
the discount rate (15% on a yearly basis), i is the 
customer, t is the month for which NPV is esti-
mated, n is the number of months beyond t, and 
P(Alive)
</p>
<p>in
 is the probability that customer i is alive 
</p>
<p>in month n.
For example, the NPV of expected contribution 
</p>
<p>margin for customer i in month 18 is calculated as 
follows: For each month and for each customer, 
we observe the total purchases in dollars. Then, we 
multiply the purchase amount by 0.3 to reflect the 
</p>
<p>gross margin. In other words, the Cost of goods sold 
is accounted for, and what we have is gross mar-
gin. Next, we subtract the Cost of actual marketing 
efforts (in this case, the cost of catalogs plus the 
mailing costs) to obtain the monthly contribution 
margin. If a decision is made at the end of month 
18, then we take the average (AMCM
</p>
<p>i
) of months 
</p>
<p>1&ndash;18 by summing up all the 18 contribution mar-
gins and dividing the sum by 18.Ifwe are at the 
end of time period 36, then we take the average 
(AMCM) of the previous 36&nbsp;months&rsquo; contribution 
margins by summing up all the 36 contribution 
margins and dividing the sum by 36. Thus, the 
AMCM estimate is updated monthly&mdash;in other 
words, dynamically modeled and used as a baseline 
for future purchases (i.e., purchases between t and 
N). The past purchase level at time t is projected 
into the future and multiplied monthly with the 
predicted P(Alive) estimate. It thus endogenously 
contains the information about the mailing pro-
cess as well. The future time horizon is limited to 
18&nbsp;months because the associated P(Alive) estimate 
becomes only marginally different from zero after 
18&nbsp; months. For example, according to the NBD/
Pareto model, if a customer hasn&rsquo;t bought in a long 
time, his probability of being alive is small. Since the 
predicted P(Alive) for the next 18&nbsp;months will be 
even smaller, the net present value of the expected 
future contribution margin stream will be very low. 
Thus, having to decide whether to invest in this 
person (i.e., marketing intervention), chances are 
that this person would not be deemed as a lucrative 
future customer&mdash;given the cost of mailing.

</p>
<p>the firm would decide to terminate the relation-
ship. Using this decision rule, we establish for 
every customer at what point he is subjected to 
the proposed termination policy. The decision 
rule incorporates the cost of mailings and an

</p>
<p>Calculation of&nbsp;Finite Lifetime Estimate
</p>
<p>Based on the decision of relationship termination, 
the average lifetime across Cohort is 29.3&nbsp;months, 
across Cohort 2 is 28.6&nbsp;months, and across Cohort 
3 is 27.8&nbsp;months (. Table&nbsp;16.6). The consistency 
between the three cohorts is very high. In all 
the cohorts, little more than 60% of the samples 
have a lifetime less than the observation window. 
Households clearly show variability in lifetime 
duration. This is evidenced through several fac-
tors, such as the wide range between lowest and 
highest lifetime estimate, the standard deviation 
of the lifetime estimate, and the relatively small 
value of s in the NBD/Pareto model.
</p>
<p>Thus, we expect considerable scope for explor-
ing the factors that affect lifetime duration. Note 
that the lifetime duration estimates that incorpo-
rate projected profits are different from the one 
that doesn&rsquo;t incorporate profits.
</p>
<p>16.3.5  Analysis
</p>
<p>In the proportional hazard model, the hazard rate 
h
</p>
<p>i
(t) for individual i is assumed to take this form:
</p>
<p>h t h t e
i
</p>
<p>x
it( ) = ( )0
b
</p>
<p> 
(16.4)
</p>
<p>where h
o
(t) is the baseline hazard rate and (X
</p>
<p>it
β) 
</p>
<p>is the impact of the independent variables. We 
can estimate the hazard model with the semi- 
parametric partial likelihood method (Helsen &amp; 
Schmittlein, 1993).
</p>
<p> Variable Operationalization
</p>
<p>The criterion variable is the house hold specific 
estimate of profitable lifetime duration. The time 
varying variable Purchase amounts
</p>
<p>it
 enters the 
</p>
<p>model as the monthly spending level ($). The 
time varying variable Cross buying
</p>
<p>it
 is operation-
</p>
<p>alized as the number of different departments 
shopped in, in a given 6-month period. There are 
a total of 90 different merchandise departments. 
The Focus- of- buying variable is operationalized 
as a dummy variable. The percentages of cus-
tomers coded as 1 (buying consistently in one 
department) are 0.04, 0.05, and 0.04 across the 
three cohorts. The time varying variable Average 
interpurchase time
</p>
<p>it
 is measured in number of 
</p>
<p>days between purchases. AIT
it
</p>
<p>2  is the square of 
the AIT
</p>
<p>it
 variable. The Return
</p>
<p>it
 variable is the 
</p>
<p>ratio of returned goods ($ value) to purchased 
goods ($ value). The Loyalty instrument variable 
is operationalized as a dummy variable, indicat-
ing ownership of the corporate charge card. The 
proportion of customers holding a charge card is 
0.39, 0.52, and 0.59 across the three cohorts. The 
effect of Mailings
</p>
<p>it
 will be operationalized as a 
</p>
<p>lagged finite exponential decay of past marketing 
efforts, similar to procedures in advertising-sales 
relationship literature.
</p>
<p>Since the merchandise changes on a con-
tinuous basis, the use of a finite decay period 
seems more realistic than an infinite period. 
The variable is measured in terms of the num-
ber of efforts/mall pieces sent to the customer. 
The dummy variable Product category
</p>
<p>i
 describes 
</p>
<p>whether a buyer predominantly shops in hard 
goods or in soft goods. The proportion of cus-
tomers buying predominantly hard goods is 0.50,

<p>0.49, and 0.45 across the three cohorts. The vari-
able Population density enters the model as the 
absolute population number in a given two-digit 
ZIP code into the model. These numbers were 
derived from the 2000&nbsp;U.S. census. The variable 
Income comes from the firm&rsquo;s database and is 
coded on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 is a yearly 
income of lesser than $10.000 and 7 is a yearly 
income of more than $150,000. The mean rating 
is 5.19, 4.88, and 5.01 across the three cohorts. 
Finally, the Age variable is measured as the age 
of the individual in years, calculated from the 
date of birth information from the database. The 
mean rating is 34.4, 34.8, and 35.2&nbsp; years across 
the three cohorts. A summary of all variables is 
given in . Table&nbsp;16.7.

<p>16.3.6  Results
</p>
<p>The results of the profitable lifetime duration model 
for the three cohorts are reported in . Table&nbsp;16.8. 
The table contains the final model parameters, 
including an interaction term (Returns X Purchase 
amount).
</p>
<p> Effects of&nbsp;Exchange Variables
</p>
<p>Purchase Amount
</p>
<p>We hypothesized the level of spending for mer-
chandise (β1) is positively related to profitable life-
time-duration. We find support for this hypothesis 
across all three cohorts and across all three mod-
els (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01). Thus, H
</p>
<p>i
 is supported. Due to the 
</p>
<p>strong association between these two measures, 
it is important to take information on amount of 
purchases into account when managing profitable 
lifetime duration.
</p>
<p>To better understand the relative impact of 
this variable on the hazard of relationship termi-
nation we analyze the risk ratio. From a manage-
rial standpoint, the risk ratio helps in gauging 
the impact of the drivers of profitable lifetime 
duration. The risk ratio can be interpreted as the 
percent change in the hazard for each one-unit 
increase in the independent variable&mdash;controlling 
for all other independent variables. The risk ratio 
is calculated as ((exp(&minus;β) -1)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100). When the 
above insight is applied to the purchase amount 
variable, we observe that a change of only $10&nbsp;in 
the monthly spending results in a decrease in the 
hazard of termination of between 31% and 35%, 
depending on cohort.
</p>
<p>Cross Buying
</p>
<p>The degree of buying across departments (β
2
) was 
</p>
<p>argued to be positively related to profitable life-
time duration because a broader scope of inter-
action constitutes a stronger relationship. This 
contention is supported for all models and for 
all cohorts in our model (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01). Apparently, a 
long customer life is sustained by a higher degree 
of purchasing across departments. Given a certain 
income, people heed longer time to fill their needs 
if they purchase across the board rather than in a 
focused manner. When calculating the risk ratio 
for this variable, we find that purchases in an addi-
tional department are associated with a decreasing 
hazard of between 59.6% and 72.8%, depending 
on cohort. Thus, it seems to be extremely desir-
</p>
<p>able for the firm to induce customers to engage in 
cross-departmental shopping. Hence, H
</p>
<p>2
 is sup-
</p>
<p>ported. This is an important finding because the 
effect of cross-buying on lifetime duration has not 
yet been documented.
</p>
<p>Focus of&nbsp;Buying
</p>
<p>We did not advance a directional hypothesis with 
respect to focus of buying (β
</p>
<p>3
) because of con-
</p>
<p>flicting arguments. The empirical test resulted in 
a negative relationship between focused buying 
behavior and lifetime duration. Thus, the result 
is in line with the results of the cross-buying con-
struct&mdash;broader buying is generally associated 
positively with an increase in lifetime duration.
</p>
<p>Average Interpurchase Time
</p>
<p>AIT (β
4
) was hypothesized to be related to prof-
</p>
<p>itable customer lifetime duration in an inverse 
U-shaped fashion. That is, the longest profitable 
lifetime should be associated with intermediate 
interpurchase times. We tested for this rela-
tionship by introducing a nonlinear term AIT2 
(β
</p>
<p>5
). We do find support for our hypothesis 
</p>
<p>with both terms being significant at (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01) 
and having the hypothesized sign (β
</p>
<p>4
 positive 
</p>
<p>and β
5
 negative). That is, lifetime tends to be 
</p>
<p>shorter when interpurchase times are either 
very short or very long and lifetime is longest 
with an intermediate value of AIT. Hence, H
</p>
<p>3
 
</p>
<p>is supported. Together, the impact of the core 
exchange variables on profitable lifetime dura-
tion is substantial. Between 65.2% and 69.7% 
of the variance is explained by this group of 
variables. This once again demonstrates that 
the exchange variables dominate even in a non-
contractual situation.
</p>
<p>Returns
</p>
<p>Regarding the proportion of returned goods (γ
1
), 
</p>
<p>our reasoning assumed a negative association 
of returns and profitable lifetime. That is, the 
higher the proportion of returned goods, the 
lower the associated profitable lifetime duration. 
Our original results (not shown in . Table&nbsp;16.7) 
showed the effect was significant at (p&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; 0.01), 
but had a positive sign for all three cohorts. Thus, 
the hypothesis that higher returns were a sign of 
greater dissatisfaction and therefore would lead 
to shorter lifetimes was not supported (H
</p>
<p>4
). A 
</p>
<p>possible explanation for this outcome could be 
that customers who returned merchandise had

<p>a positive encounter with the firm&rsquo;s service rep-
resentatives, which then might affect their future 
purchase behavior (Hirschman, 1970). It is inter-
esting to mention that managers told us (upon 
further inquiry) of their experience, that heavy 
buyers tend to return proportionately more. A 
possible reason for this might be that these buy-
ers are accustomed to the procedures of returning 
merchandise and are able to do it efficiently. Thus, 
it might be that these customers see the return 
process as part of the mail-order buying process. 
If this effect dominates, then one would expect a 
positive relationship. Likewise, this would prob-
ably mean that as customers spent more with the 
firm, the effect should become stronger.
</p>
<p>To pursue this line of thought, we added 
 post- hoc, an interaction between amount of 
purchases and the proportion of returns to the 
model. The final results including the interac-
tion are included in . Table&nbsp;16.7. The interaction 
turns out to be significant for all three cohorts 
(p&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; 0.01). Thus, we find evidence for the con-
jecture that the degree of returns depends on the 
degree of spending. Thus, the positive impact on 
lifetime duration is greatest when the level of dol-
lar purchases and the level of returns are high. 
. Figure&nbsp; 16.8 depicts this situation graphically. 
Evidence (Clark, Kaminski, &amp; Rink, 1992) has 
been shown of the impact of positively discon-
firming complainants&rsquo; expectations to achieve 
(restore) satisfaction. Moreover, the impact of 
this response seems to be maintained over time. 
Therefore, we believe, proportionally higher 
returns might be an indication of this positive 
</p>
<p>disconfirmation. If, for example, the firm has a 
no-hassle return policy and the customers have 
come to accept the technical return procedures, 
greater satisfaction with the exchange can result 
and therefore greater profitable lifetime dura-
tion. Clearly, it would be desirable to have stated 
satisfaction measures at hand to add additional 
validity to our results. Similar empirical sup-
port for our finding comes from another study 
(Kesler, 1985) in which Omaha Steaks, a mail- 
order supplier of high-quality meat, found higher 
profitability for those customers for which it had 
quickly resolved complaints.
</p>
<p>Loyalty Instrument
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the loyalty instrument (γ
2
) is sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly related to profitable lifetime duration 
(p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01). According to our hypothesis, the use 
of the charge card as a loyalty instrument should 
lead to a higher lifetime. Thus, in our sample, 
issuing a charge card appears to be successful as 
a loyalty instrument because it does seem to be 
associated with longer customer lifetime. Thus, 
this is supported. Remember, the findings in lit-
erature thus far are not very favorable in terms 
of loyalty instrument efficiency. However, in this 
case, it seems at least successful with respect to 
profitable lifetime duration. Nevertheless, we 
cannot make a statement about the cost effec-
tiveness of the program. In terms of magnitude 
of effect, the risk ratio analysis indicates adopt-
ing the loyalty instrument is associated with 
a 45&ndash;52% decrease in hazard of relationship 
termination&mdash; substantive amount.

<p>Mailings
</p>
<p>The mailing variable (γ
3
) was introduced as an 
</p>
<p>important control variable specified as a lagged 
effect. Recall that mailings and sales are typically 
not independent in a direct marketing context. 
The hypothesized effect on lifetime duration 
was positive. We find a positive significant effect 
(p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01) for all three cohorts&mdash;thus, our deci-
sion to control for the variable is correct. Hence, 
H
</p>
<p>6
 is supported in that the mailing effort is sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly related to profitable customer lifetime 
duration.
</p>
<p>Product Category
</p>
<p>A concern in our modeling effort was that the 
choice of product category (γ
</p>
<p>4
) could have a 
</p>
<p>systematic effect on a customer&rsquo;s lifetime. For 
example, it could be that durable goods (i.e., 
hard goods) have a potentially long lifetime and 
thus there is little need for replacement, leading 
to a potentially shorter customer lifetime. This 
concern, however, is not substantiated since the 
parameter γ
</p>
<p>4
 for the dummy variable is not sig-
</p>
<p>nificant (p&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0.1) for any cohort.
</p>
<p> Effects of&nbsp;Observed Heterogeneity
</p>
<p>Spatial Location of&nbsp;Customer
</p>
<p>It was argued that the spatial location is linked 
to a customer&rsquo;s tenure with a direct marketer 
(δ1) such that the population density is inversely 
associated with customer lifetime duration. Our 
results confirm this hypothesis (H
</p>
<p>7
) for two out 
</p>
<p>of the three cohorts (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), thus underlining 
the need (1) to account for observed heterogene-
ity in duration modeling, and (2) to demonstrate 
support for the transaction cost minimization 
argument.
</p>
<p>Income and&nbsp;Age
</p>
<p>In terms of the two demographic variables repre-
senting income (δ,) and age (δ,), we find that while 
age does not seem to be related to profitable life-
time duration (p&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0.05), income does (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01). 
Our model indicates higher income is associated 
with longer lifetime. Thus H
</p>
<p>8
, is supported.
</p>
<p>Overall, the information on observed cus-
tomer heterogeneity adds explanatory power 
to the duration model, above and beyond the 
exchange variables. The results are validated in a 
</p>
<p>B-to-B setting. The summary of results is available 
in . Table&nbsp;16.9.
</p>
<p>16.3.7  Technical Appendix: 
Estimation of&nbsp;P(Alive)
</p>
<p>The likelihood of a customer being alive can be 
computed either through the method-of-moments 
or through maximum-likelihood approaches. Due 
to the computational constraints imposed by the 
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), method-
 of moment estimates have been the method of 
choice. It has also been shown for the NBD model 
that the method-of-moments approach and MLE 
yield approximately the same results (Schmittlein, 
Morrison, &amp; Colombo, 1987). Thus, there seems 
to be support in favor of the more manageable 
method-of moments routine.
</p>
<p>Using the likelihood as given in AI, we estimate 
the four parameters of the NBD/Pareto model 
(r,&nbsp;α, s, β) with a Fortran routine. The likelihood is:

&nbsp;=&nbsp;x
</p>
<p>i
 purchases in (0, T
</p>
<p>i
) with 
</p>
<p>the last transaction time at t
i
. The resulting MLE 
</p>
<p>parameters are r&nbsp; =&nbsp; 3.01, α&nbsp; =&nbsp; 9.65, s&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.82 and 
β&nbsp; =&nbsp; 11.91 (estimation horizon 30&nbsp; months). The 
parameters are quite consistent with the estimates 
derived by Reinartz and Kumar, who used esti-
mates of r&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.24, α&nbsp;=&nbsp;14.95, s&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.93 and β&nbsp;=&nbsp;13.85 
(Reinartz &amp; Kumar, 2000). In particular, the 
critical parameters r/α&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.312 and s/β&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.069 are 
similar to Reinartz and Kumar (r/α&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.481 and 
s/β&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.069), resulting in little bias in the P(Alive) 
estimates (see . Table&nbsp;16.10).Since the results are 
robust and the computational resources required 
for MLE are substantially larger, the method-of-
moment estimation is preferred.
</p>
<p>The model parameters can be explained as 
follows. The variation across customers in their 
long-run purchase rate is reflected in the esti-
mate of r only and is independent of α. In other 
words, the larger the value of the shape param-
eter r, the more homogeneous is the population 
of customers in terms of purchase rate. Thus, r 
can be viewed as an overall inverse measure of

holds. In other words, the larger the value of the

on the parameter s only. Overall, the model esti-

<p>mates seem reasonable and show a high degree 
of face validity and internal consistency. Having 
calculated the distribution parameters, the 
characteristic of interest is the probability that 
a customer with a particular observed trans-
action history is still alive at time T since trial.

<p>It is important to mention that this method-
ology requires cohorts of customers. Only the 
cohort analysis yields insight into the dynamic 
pattern of defection over time, whereas a simple 
cross-section of customers would not give such 
insight (because customers are at different stages 
in their lifecycle).
</p>
<p>16.4  Model for&nbsp;Identifying the&nbsp;True 
Value of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Lost Customer
</p>
<p>16.4.1  Conceptual Background
</p>
<p>The authors of this study, John B.&nbsp;Hogan, Katherine 
N.&nbsp;Lemon, and Barak Libai, argue the traditional 
customer profitability models evaluate customers 
in isolation from one another and that the effects of 
social interactions are not accounted for (Hogan, 
Lemon, &amp; Libai, 2003). Customers are involved in 
social interactions and they may advocate posi-
tive or negative word of mouth about the products 
and the firm. This, in turn, could influence future 
prospects to become customers and existing cus-
tomers to cease transactions. The exclusion of these 
indirect social effects could lead to misallocation of 
scarce marketing resources during the critical early 
stages of a new product market.
</p>
<p>The value of a lost customer depends on 
whether the customer defects to a competing firm 
or disadopts the product category. Customer defec-
tion refers to a situation where a customer leaves 
one firm and starts transacting with a competing 
firm. As a consequence, the firm loses direct sales 
from that customer. In contrast,  disadoption occurs 
when a customer stops purchasing from that prod-
uct category altogether. This affects the long-term 
profitability in two ways one is the loss of direct 
sales and the other is in terms of indirect effects of 
word of mouth, imitation, and other social effects.

<p>16.4.2  Modeling the&nbsp;Effects of 
Disadoption on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Value 
of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Lost Customer
</p>
<p>I α is the proportion of disadopters in a firm&rsquo;s lost 
customers, then the value of an average lost cus-
tomer (VLC) is calculated in (Eq.&nbsp;16.8):
</p>
<p>VLC VLC VLCdisadopters defectors= + -( )1 a
 
</p>
<p> (16.8)
</p>
<p>The value of α may vary across firms and mar-
kets. The sales effect of slower customer acquisi-
tions caused by the social effects and reduced 
level of word of mouth is then estimated using 
the Bass new product growth model. The profit 
impact of a lost customer is estimated by calculat-
ing the difference in the expected profitability of 
the firm before and after the customer has disa-
dopted. In other words, profit impact of a lost cus-
tomer&nbsp;=&nbsp;sales estimate from new product growth 
model without disadoption&mdash;the sales estimate 
when the customer disadopts after certain time. 
This takes into account both the direct and indi-
rect effects of disadoption.
</p>
<p>16.4.3  The Key Determinants 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Value of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Customer
</p>
<p>To study the phenomenon of the lost customer, 
a Monte Carlo simulation was used in which 
the key parameters such as external influence 
(p), internal influence (q), discount rate (r), and 
disadoption time (t
</p>
<p>1
) were variable based. The 
</p>
<p>results indicated: (1) the time when customer 
disadopts has the largest impact on the value of 
the lost customer, (2) the external influence, p 
</p>
<p>has a negative impact, (3) the internal influence, 
q has a positive impact on penetration because 
higher q signifies stronger word of mouth, and 
(4) discount rate has positive impact on the 
value of lost customer. The study shows that the 
earlier a customer disadopts the more money the 
company loses. This is because at the early stages 
of a product life cycle, there are only a few adopt-
ers to influence the future adoption through 
word of mouth. Hence, a single disadoption can 
have larger impact. The effects of various vari-
ables on the value of a lost customer are given in 
. Table&nbsp;16.11.
</p>
<p>It is also important to note the value of a lost 
customer is affected by stages in the product 
life cycle, the firm&rsquo;s market share, and the rate 
at which competitors&rsquo; customers disadopt. This 
has important managerial implications in terms 
of spending on customer retention, allocation of 
retention, and acquisition spending over time, 
extended return on investment analysis, and 
managing competitive environment.

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>A study of the lifetime-profitability relation-
</p>
<p>ship in a noncontractual setting highlights 
</p>
<p>a concern with the widespread assumption 
</p>
<p>of a clear-cut positive lifetime-profitability 
</p>
<p>relationship and underlines the importance 
</p>
<p>of a differentiated analysis. In the conceptual 
</p>
<p>model, individual customer lifetime profits are 
</p>
<p>modeled as a function of a customer&rsquo;s lifetime 
</p>
<p>duration, revenue flows over the course of a 
</p>
<p>customer&rsquo;s lifetime, and firm cost is associated 
</p>
<p>with the marketing exchange. In a noncon-
</p>
<p>tractual scenario such as the direct marketing 
</p>
<p>context, promotional costs are typically the 
</p>
<p>largest nonproduct cost factor in a customer 
</p>
<p>firm relationship. A possible reason for higher 
</p>
<p>value consciousness of long-term customers 
</p>
<p>might be that customers learn over time to 
</p>
<p>trust lower-priced items or brands as much as 
</p>
<p>established-name brand products.

</p>
<p>The empirical evidence showed that (1) a 
</p>
<p>strong linear positive association between life-
</p>
<p>time and profits does not necessarily exist, (2) 
</p>
<p>profits do not necessarily increase with increas-
</p>
<p>ing customer tenure, (3), the cost of serving 
</p>
<p>long-life customers is not lower, and (4) long-life 
</p>
<p>customers do not pay higher prices, However, 
</p>
<p>these factors may have differential impacts in 
</p>
<p>different industries.
</p>
<p>The objectives of the second study were 
</p>
<p>(1) to empirically measure lifetime duration for 
</p>
<p>noncontractual customer-firm relationships, (2) 
</p>
<p>to incorporate projected profits to the structure 
</p>
<p>of profitable relationships and to identify the 
</p>
<p>antecedents of customer&rsquo;s profitable lifetime 
</p>
<p>duration, and (3) to develop managerial implica-
</p>
<p>tions for building and managing profitable rela-
</p>
<p>tionship exchanges. The model first estimated 
</p>
<p>the probability of a customer being alive and 
</p>
<p>then integrated this with the individual lifetime 
</p>
<p>duration. The main drivers of customer&rsquo;s profit-
</p>
<p>able lifetime duration are classified as exchange 
</p>
<p>characteristics and customer heterogeneity. 
</p>
<p>The customer&rsquo;s spending level, cross-buying, 
</p>
<p>focus of buying, average interpurchase time, 
</p>
<p>amount of returns, customer&rsquo;s ownership of 
</p>
<p>loyalty instrument, and the mailing efforts of the 
</p>
<p>company are identified as important exchange 
</p>
<p>characteristics. Spatial location of consumer and 
</p>
<p>his age and income are the important customer 
</p>
<p>heterogeneity factors influencing the profitable 
</p>
<p>lifetime duration.
</p>
<p>In the third study, a model is developed for 
</p>
<p>determining the effects of disadoption on the 
</p>
<p>value of a lost customer. This takes into account 
</p>
<p>not only the direct effects of lost sales but also 
</p>
<p>the indirect effects of social effects such as word 
</p>
<p>of mouth. The key determinants of the value of a 
</p>
<p>lost customer are identified as disadoption time, 
</p>
<p>external and internal influence, and the discount 
</p>
<p>rate. The disadoption time is found to have the 
</p>
<p>maximum negative impact on the value-that is, 
</p>
<p>the earlier a customer disadopts, the higher the 
</p>
<p>value of the lost customer.
</p>
<p>Customer equity is the aggregation of the 
</p>
<p>expected lifetime values of a firm&rsquo;s entire base of 
</p>
<p>existing customers and the expected future value 
</p>
<p>of newly acquired customers. The NPV objective 
</p>
<p>function required to maximize the customer 
</p>
<p>equity of a firm is related to the cash flow from 
</p>
<p>each customer, the expected interpurchase time, 
</p>
<p>and the cost and frequency of the marketing/
</p>
<p>communication strategies employed. The objec-
</p>
<p>tive function is based on a probability model 
</p>
<p>which predicts the interpurchase time of each 
</p>
<p>customer, a panel data model which predicts the 
</p>
<p>cash flows from each customer, and an optimiza-
</p>
<p>tion algorithm which maximizes the profits. By 
</p>
<p>applying an optimization model, a manager can 
</p>
<p>know the extent to which he should use various 
</p>
<p>contact channels. Cross analysis of duration of 
</p>
<p>relationship and customer value obtained on the 
</p>
<p>basis of the NPV maximization objective func-
</p>
<p>tion indicates not all short-duration customers 
</p>
<p>deliver lower profits, and not all long-duration 
</p>
<p>customers deliver higher profits. Identifying and 
</p>
<p>targeting responsive and profitable customers 
</p>
<p>and deemphasizing efforts on some customers 
</p>
<p>who were not profitable-irrespective of whether 
</p>
<p>they are classified as long-duration or short-
</p>
<p>duration customers-would be a better approach. 
</p>
<p>Customer value-based approach demonstrated 
</p>
<p>its superiority to the duration of association 
</p>
<p>approach in terms of profitable segmentation of 
</p>
<p>customers.
</p>
<p>Purchase sequence model captures the dif-
</p>
<p>ferences in the durations between purchases 
</p>
<p>for different product categories. An individual 
</p>
<p>customer-level profit function is developed 
</p>
<p>to predict customer value. The success of the 
</p>
<p>experiment based on the model demonstrated.
</p>
<p>By higher revenue, lower cost of commu-
</p>
<p>nication, lower number of attempts before a 
</p>
<p>purchase is made, higher profits, and higher 
</p>
<p>ROI for the test group, when compared to the 
</p>
<p>control group, indicates the scope to which the 
</p>
<p>customer value approach offers in improving 
</p>
<p>the quality of marketing decisions.
</p>
<p>The acquisition-process is an integral com-
</p>
<p>ponent of the research model. By linking acqui-
</p>
<p>sition and the retention process, it is possible 
</p>
<p>to see a complete and unbiased picture of the 
</p>
<p>drivers behind customers election/acquisition, 
</p>
<p>relationship duration, and customer profit-
</p>
<p>ability. Also, making the necessary trade-off 
</p>
<p>between offensive processes and defensive 
</p>
<p>processes requires a full specification of the key 
</p>
<p>dimensions of the customer- firm relationship. A 
</p>
<p>more complete model specification addresses 
</p>
<p>the key managerial question of whether the

<p>know how to maximize profitability through

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>The ability to know exactly who is going to buy 
</p>
<p>what product and when, and the resources and 
</p>
<p>communication strategy needed to make it 
</p>
<p>happen, will no doubt be on the top of the wish 
</p>
<p>list for CEOs. This ability will help the firm invest 
</p>
<p>on the most profitable customer&rsquo;s at the most 
</p>
<p>appropriate time, and in the most effective way. 
</p>
<p>This will not only avoid overspending or under 
</p>
<p>spending on customers but also increase the 
</p>
<p>revenue and profit from them. However, many 
</p>
<p>companies continue to spend resources on large 
</p>
<p>number of unprofitable customers. They could 
</p>
<p>either be investing on customers who are easy 
</p>
<p>to acquire but are not necessarily profitable or 
</p>
<p>trying to increase the retention rate of all their 
</p>
<p>customers, thereby leading to wastage of limited 
</p>
<p>resources. Allocating resources optimally on an 
</p>
<p>individual customer was not a feasible process 
</p>
<p>before the introduction of the customer value 
</p>
<p>framework. By utilizing the customer value 
</p>
<p>framework, researchers have now devised mod-
</p>
<p>els to allow customer-level actions.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we describe the model for arriv-
</p>
<p>ing at the optimal resource allocation. This model 
</p>
<p>will help a manager know the extent to which 
</p>
<p>he should use various contact channels to com-
</p>
<p>municate to a customer. A model to predict the 
</p>
<p>purchase sequence is described next. The model 
</p>
<p>addresses questions like: (1) What is the sequence 
</p>
<p>in which a customer is likely to buy multiple 
</p>
<p>products or product categories? and (2) When is 
</p>
<p>the customer expected to buy each product? The 
</p>
<p>third model addresses issues related to allocating 
</p>
<p>resources between acquisition and retention with 
</p>
<p>the objective of maximizing a customer&rsquo;s long- 
</p>
<p>term profitability. It tries to answer questions like: 
</p>
<p>(1) What should be the total budget for acquisition 
</p>
<p>and retention? (2) How much should be spent on 
</p>
<p>customer acquisition and customer retention? and 
</p>
<p>(3) How should these expenditures be allocated 
</p>
<p>between contact channels?
</p>
<p>Customer attrition has become a critical con-
</p>
<p>cern for many industries, such as telecommunica-
</p>
<p>tion, retail banking, and insurance. With increased 
</p>
<p>competition, a customer has many more choices 
</p>
<p>of products and services from a number of firms. 
</p>
<p>Coupled with increased choices for consumers, 
</p>
<p>firms are constantly trying to acquire high-value 
</p>
<p>customers from their competitors. As a result, 
</p>
<p>firms find it difficult to retain customers as they 
</p>
<p>easily move from one firm to the other (that is, 
</p>
<p>defect). This chapter discusses a CLV-based strat-
</p>
<p>egy to manage customer churn. By answering 
</p>
<p>some important questions faced by managers in 
</p>
<p>retaining customers, the strategy discussed here 
</p>
<p>is also implemented in a telecommunications firm 
</p>
<p>that has borne impressive results for the company 
</p>
<p>in retaining customers.
</p>
<p>While a firm&rsquo;s aggregate-level brand value 
</p>
<p>perception continues to influence its bottom line 
</p>
<p>performance, it does not provide the firm with 
</p>
<p>a clear set of guidelines as to how to structure 
</p>
<p>their marketing and brand investment strategies. 
</p>
<p>To design and execute effective brand man-
</p>
<p>agement strategies, firms need to understand 
</p>
<p>exactly how each of their actions will affect the 
</p>
<p>customer&rsquo;s individual brand value. In this chapter, 
</p>
<p>we forward a framework that firms can use to 
</p>
<p>effectively link Customer Brand Value (CBV) to the 
</p>
<p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) metric. The strate-
</p>
<p>gies developed using this link help firms better 
</p>
<p>understand and redesign their brand strategies 
</p>
<p>to suit the needs of the individual customer.
</p>
<p>Many firms are using metrics such as Cus-
</p>
<p>tomer Lifetime Value to identify their &laquo;best&raquo; 
</p>
<p>customers and then allocating resources to 
</p>
<p>target these customers with the highest CLV for 
</p>
<p>referral campaigns. However, such programs 
</p>
<p>tend to alienate low and medium-CLV custom-
</p>
<p>ers because of the lower-level service provided 
</p>
<p>and the differentiated treatment. Therefore, it is 
</p>
<p>important for managers to determine the value 
</p>
<p>of a customer&rsquo;s ability to spread word-of-mouth 
</p>
<p>and make referrals. This chapter introduces and 
</p>
<p>discusses the Customer Referral Value (CRV) 
</p>
<p>metric for profitably managing customer refer-
</p>
<p>ral behavior. By accounting for the attitudinal 
</p>
<p>behavior of customers&nbsp;and measuring the indi-
</p>
<p>rect  contribution (referrals or word-of-mouth) 
</p>
<p>made by customers toward the firm&rsquo;s profit, this 
</p>
<p>chapter shows that the CRV metric is the most 
</p>
<p>appropriate metric for designing profitable refer-
</p>
<p>ral strategies.

<p>17.1  Optimal Resource Allocation 
Across Marketing and  
Communication Strategies
</p>
<p>Customer equity is the aggregation of the expected 
lifetime values of a firm&rsquo;s entire base of existing 
customers and the expected future value of newly 
acquired customers (Hogan et&nbsp; al., 2002). A firm 
needs to make trade-offs that reserve strategic 
resources for the areas in which the expenditures 
will generate the greatest impact on customer 
equity (Rust, Zeithaml, &amp; Lemon, 2000). The 
interpurchase time for a customer is influenced by 
marketing initiatives taken by a firm. A mathemat-
ical model for interpurchase time as discussed ear-
lier in this book includes the frequency and nature 
of marketing and communication efforts. A model 
to predict the cash flows from each customer can 
be simultaneously developed. The net present 
value (NPV) objective function required to maxi-
mize the customer equity of a firm is related to the 
cash flow from each customer, the expected inter-
purchase time, and the cost and frequency of the 
marketing/communication strategies employed. A 
manager can determine the frequency of each of 
the available marketing and communication strat-
egies such that the NPV objective function is 
maximized. An optimization technique can be 
utilized to accurately arrive at the differential allo-
cation of strategic resources to individual custom-
ers across a variety of integrated marketing 
strategies (Venkatesan &amp; Kumar, 2004). The objec-
tive function is thus based on three elements:
</p>
<p> 5 A probability-based model that predicts the 
interpurchase time of each customer, as a 
function of marketing communication inputs 
and the customers&rsquo; past purchase behavior 
observed over time.
</p>
<p> 5 A panel data model that predicts the cash flows 
from each individual customer, also as a 
function of marketing communication inputs 
and the customers&rsquo; past purchase behavior 
observed over time.
</p>
<p> 5 An optimization algorithm that maximizes the 
profits from each individual customer by 
examining the impact of various levels of 
marketing communication inputs.
</p>
<p>By applying an optimization model, a manager can 
know the extent to which he should use various 
contact channels. For example, for individual cus-
tomers, should there be a decrease in face-to-face 
meetings and an increase in the frequency of direct 
mailers, or vice versa? Or, for segments of custom-
ers, how can total profitability over these segments 
be maximized? To illustrate the application of the 
optimal resource allocation procedure, it is useful 
to look at the results of a real-world situation.
</p>
<p>First, it was necessary to establish that the 
model would do a good job of predicting whether 
a particular customer would buy in the next 
12&nbsp; months. Based on an analysis of a sample of 
324 customers, out of 246 customers the model 
predicted would buy a product, 225 of them actu-
ally bought. Similarly, out of the 78 customers the 
model predicted would not buy the product, 66 of 
them did not buy. This suggests the model had a 
total accuracy, or hit rate, of 90% (see . Table&nbsp;17.1).
</p>
<p>Hit Rate = + &divide; =225 66 324 90%
</p>
<p>Given this reassurance, we needed to examine if 
the customer value approach could eventually 
lead to an improvement in profits relative to the 
duration of association approach currently being 
employed by the firm to select customers and 
</p>
<p>       . Table&nbsp;17.1 Effect of firm and market variables on the value of a lost customer

</p>
<p>prioritize its marketing action (Duration of asso-
ciation (one of the traditional measures of loy-
alty) indicates how long a customer has been 
transacting with the firm).
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp;17.2 shows the results of duration of 
association approach in terms of the classification 
of customers and their average profits.
</p>
<p>The firm studied would break its customer base 
into two groups&mdash;short-duration customers and 
long-duration customers. Short-duration custom-
ers were those customers who had been transacting 
with the firm for less than a predetermined cut-off 
value of years. Consequently, the long-duration 
customers were the customers who had been trans-
acting with the firm for longer than the cut-off 
value. From . Table&nbsp;17.2 it seemed as if they were 
doing the right thing, because the average profits 
from the short-duration group were much lower 
than the average profits from the long-duration 
group.
</p>
<p>However, across analysis of duration of rela-
tionship and customer value, obtained on the 
basis of the NPV maximization objective func-
tion, indicates not all short-duration customers 
deliver lower profits, and not all long-duration 
customers deliver higher profits. A superior 
approach could be thus adopted by identifying 
and targeting responsive and profitable custom-
ers and by deemphasizing efforts on some cus-
tomers who were not profitable, irrespective of 
whether they are classified as long-duration or 
short- duration customers. Some of the profitable 
</p>
<p>customers had escaped the firm&rsquo;s attention when 
only the duration of association approach was 
being followed. Also, the firm was allocating dis-
proportionately higher resources to some long-
duration customers in the mistaken belief that 
the duration of their association with the firm 
was indicative of their profitability (see 
. Table&nbsp;17.3).
</p>
<p>The observations in Cell III indicate more than 
50% of the customers that the firm was chasing in 
the long-duration segment were actually low- 
value customers. The observations in Cell II indi-
cate the firm was ignoring a sizable set of 
customers by classifying them as short-duration 
customers, when indeed they were contributing 
significantly to profits. Thus, the customer value- 
based approach demonstrated its superiority to 
the duration of association approaching terms of 
profitable segmentation of customers. By using 
the optimal resource allocation model, we can 
improve profitability in each of the cells as shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;17.1.
</p>
<p>The analysis recommends changing the fre-
quency of face-to-face meetings, direct mail, and 
telesales in each cell to an optimal level, thereby 
enhancing the effectiveness of the marketing/
communication initiatives. By changing over to 
the optimal frequencies, recommended by the 
model for face-to-face meetings and direct mail 
telesales, in each of the four cells, a 10% decrease 
in overall costs and a 6% increase in overall profits 
were observed.

<p>In the case of a multiproduct firm, it is important 
to understand which product in the portfolio is 
likely to be needed next by a customer. An ideal 
contact strategy is one where the firm is able to 
deliver a sales message relevant to the product 
likely to be purchased in the near future by a cus-
tomer. The next level is therefore the development 
of a purchase sequence model.
</p>
<p>A purchase sequence model (Kumar, Venkatesan, 
&amp; Reinartz, 2004) addresses three questions:
</p>
<p> 5 What is the sequence in which a customer is 
likely to buy multiple products or product 
categories?
</p>
<p> 5 When is the customer expected to buy each 
product?
</p>
<p> 5 What is the expected revenue from that 
customer?
</p>
<p>This model captures the differences in the dura-
tions between purchases for different product cat-
egories. The interdependence in purchase 
propensities across products is modeled by incor-
porating cross-product category variables. An 
individual customer level profit function is devel-
oped to predict customer value. To demonstrate 
such a model delivers superior results in the field, 
an experiment was set up in the sales department 
of a high technology B2B vendor, which markets 
multiple categories of products.
</p>
<p>The model was developed for the hardware 
products of the firm. The model is able to prioritize

chase different hardware products for each of its

Empirical evidence from this experiment suggests 
profits predicted on the basis of a purchase 
sequence model are accurate and that using the 
model results in a greater return on marketing 
investments. . Table&nbsp;17.4 is an illustration of the 
improvement for the hardware category, over the 
previous year, in profits generated by the test group 
of salespersons who adopted strategies based on 
the outcome of the purchase sequence model ver-
sus the control group of salespersons not provided 
the predictions given by the model.
</p>
<p>As . Table&nbsp; 17.4 shows, there is a significant 
decrease in the cost of communication resulting 
in a saving of $750 on last year&rsquo;s base of $3625. In 
comparison, the control group saw an increase in 
</p>
<p>its cost of communication by $75 on an already 
high last-year base of $4580. The test group was 
able to reduce the average number of attempts 
before purchase by four, whereas for the test group 
this number increased by one, compared to the 
respective figures for last year. Similarly, for the 
test group, profits were higher and so was ROI.
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp;17.5 provides the difference in perfor-
mance between the test group and the control

</p>
<p>We see again during the experiment period, 
the test group revenue is higher, cost of com-
munication is lower, number of attempts before 
a purchase is made is lower, profits are higher, 
and ROI is higher, when compared to the control 
group. The success of the experiment indicates the 
scope that the customer value approach offers in 
improving the quality of marketing decisions.

<p>17.3  The Link Between Acquisition, 
Retention, and&nbsp;Profitability: 
Balancing Acquisition and 
Retention Resources to 
 Maximize Customer 
 Profitability
</p>
<p>Measuring, managing, and maximizing customer 
profitability is not an easy task. From a marketing 
resource allocation perspective, it requires a man-
ager to (1) set a budget, (2) balance how much to 
spend on customer acquisition and customer 
retention, and (3) determine how the expendi-
tures are allocated between contact channels. The 
objective is, of course, to maximize a customer&rsquo;s 
long-term profitability. For example, a manager of 
a paper company distributes sales force efforts 
and directs marketing efforts among its set of 350 
business customers. The manager also has to con-
stantly juggle how many new prospects should be 
targeted at a given point in time vis-&agrave;-vis the por-
tion of time and effort to be directed to existing 
</p>
<p>customers. In this section, we summarize the 
findings of a study that examines these questions 
(Reinartz, Thomas, &amp; Kumar, 2005).
</p>
<p>In contrast to most other studies, the acquisi-
tion process is an integral component of the 
research model. The conceptual link between the 
acquisition and the retention process is important 
for two reasons. First, only by linking the two, one 
can see a complete and unbiased picture of the 
drivers behind customer selection/acquisition, 
relationship duration, and customer profitability 
(See . Fig.&nbsp;17.2) (Heckman, 1979).
</p>
<p>Prior research has specifically shown that a 
failure to link acquisition and retention can lead to 
biased results and incorrect inferences (Thomas, 
2001). This is due to the selection bias resulting 
from the omission of information on no acquired 
prospects. Second, offensive processes and defen-
sive processes compete for the same resources. 
Making the necessary trade-off requires a full 
specification of the key dimensions of the cus-
tomer-firm relationship. Thus, a more complete

</p>
<p>model specification allows us to address a key 
managerial question: &laquo;Does the maximization of 
the respective objective functions (a.k.a, acquisi-
tion likelihood, lifetime duration, and customer 
value) lead to convergent or divergent resource 
allocation recommendations? &raquo;.
</p>
<p>It is important to note this model applies mainly 
to situations where managers mostly rely on direct 
customer communication, such as via sales force, 
direct mail, or Internet. This is the case for most 
B-to-B environments, as well as for many direct 
marketing contexts.
</p>
<p>The interest of this study lies mainly in the 
impact of (1) amount of spending and (2) contact 
channel type on three dependent variables: acquisi-
tion rate, retention rate, and customer profitability.
</p>
<p>As firms increase their acquisition budget, the 
associated acquisition rate and customer profit-
ability will be less and less responsive (concavity). 
Even if, for all practical purposes, there were no 
limits on acquisition expenditure, firms are able 
to capture only a certain share of the potential 
targets. We can expect that acquisition expendi-
tures will have diminishing marginal associations 
with the likelihood of customer acquisition. Also, 
acquisition expenditures will have diminishing 
marginal associations with customer profitabil-
ity. Similarly we can see that increasing retention 
expenditures will cease to be profitable beyond 
a certain level. Thus, we can expect retention 
expenditures will have diminishing marginal 
associations with relationship duration and with 
customer profitability.
</p>
<p>We would also like to see if the nature of the 
contact channel affects acquisition and relation-
ship duration. We can expect highly interper-
sonal contact channels have a greater association 
with the likelihood of customer acquisition than 
less interpersonal contact channels. Also, highly 
interpersonal contact channels have a greater 
association with relationship duration than less 
interpersonal contact channels.
</p>
<p>At the most simple level, different contact chan-
nels may be seen as having independent effects on 
the respective dependent variables, acquisition, 
duration, and customer profitability. However a 
potential interaction effect between channels is 
likely to exist. For example, one could argue that 
contacting a prospect via telesales and via direct 
mail at the same time may have a stronger effect 
than the sum of the separate effects administered 
at different points in time. This is due to the mutual 
</p>
<p>reinforcement of the message delivered through 
the different contact channels at the same time.
</p>
<p>The empirical context for this research is the 
same B-to-B firm as in the previous two examples. 
The following substantive conclusions emerge 
from this empirical context:
</p>
<p> 5 The amount of investment in a customer as 
well as how it is invested has an impact on 
acquisition, retention, and customer profit-
ability.
</p>
<p> 5 Investments into customer acquisition and 
retention have diminishing marginal returns.
</p>
<p> 5 How much is invested in a customer-firm 
relationship has a larger impact on long-term 
customer profitability than how the expen-
ditures are invested across communication 
channels. Thus, optimizing the amount of 
relationship investment is of prime impor-
tance.
</p>
<p> 5 The relative effectiveness of highly person-
alized communication channels is much 
greater than the less personalized commu-
nication channels. However, the relative cost 
also needs to be taken into account when 
deciding the communication strategy as it 
affects the overall profitability.
</p>
<p> 5 Under spending in acquisition and retention 
is more detrimental and results in smaller 
ROIs than overspending.
</p>
<p> 5 When trading off between allocating expen-
ditures to acquisition versus retention, a sub-
optimal allocation of retention  expenditures 
will have a larger detrimental impact on long-
term customer profitability than suboptimal 
acquisition expenditures.
</p>
<p> 5 The customer communication strategy that 
maximizes long-term customer profitability 
maximizes neither the acquisition rate nor 
the relationship duration. Instead, developing 
a communication strategy to manage long-
term customer profitability generally requires 
a long-term and holistic perspective of the 
relationship. This perspective tends to give 
more emphasis to more interpersonal and 
interactive communications than a limited 
focus on acquisition.
</p>
<p>Although the results are specific to the empirical 
context, the model can be applied to any envi-
ronment where acquisition and retention efforts 
can be separated. Managers can use the proposed 
integrated framework not only to better under-

</p>
<p>stand the drivers of profitability, but also to know 
how to maximize profitability through optimal 
allocation of resources.
</p>
<p>17.4  Preventing Customer Churn
</p>
<p>Customer retention is a crucial function for any 
organization. When customers churn and end the 
relationship, it impacts the firm in several ways. 
First, the firm incurs a loss of revenue from the 
customers who have defected. Second, the firm 
loses the opportunity to recover the acquisition 
cost incurred on the defected customers, thereby 
increasing the pressure to break even. Third, the 
firm loses the opportunity to up-sell/cross-sell to 
customers who have defected, and this loss can be 
treated as a loss of potential revenue. Fourth, there 
are some &laquo;lost&raquo; social effects such as influencing 
other customers on product/service adoption and 
a potential negative word-of-mouth. Finally, firms 
must also invest additional resources to replace 
those lost customers with new customers, thereby 
draining the firm&rsquo;s resources already impacted by 
the loss of customers.
</p>
<p>Given these potential problems of losing cus-
tomers, it is essential for companies to adopt appro-
priate analytical tools to prevent customer churn. 
Analytical models (such as Dynamic Churn mod-
els) are used to predict future customer behavior 
</p>
<p>and help firms decide which customer/distributor 
is likely to quit and at what time. These models 
empower the managers to execute timely, customer- 
specific marketing interventions that result in an 
increase in ROI.&nbsp; Some of the strategic questions 
faced by managers in implementing this strategy 
are:
</p>
<p> 5 Should we intervene?
 5 Which customers should we intervene with?
 5 When do we intervene?
 5 Through which channel do we intervene?
 5 What do we offer them?
</p>
<p>These critical questions can be answered by build-
ing propensity-to-quit models and integrating 
them with the CLV based models. To decide on 
the intervention necessity, it is essential on the 
part of the managers to study customer quitting 
tendencies. For instance, consider Customer 
A, Customer B, and Customer C.&nbsp; The predicted 
propensity- to-quit of the three customers over 
time (July 2009&ndash;July 2010) is illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;17.3.
</p>
<p>As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;17.3, Customer A does not 
intend to quit and is denoted by a straight line. 
Though Customer B does not exhibit a quitting 
tendency initially, he shows an increase in pro-
pensity to quit from January 2010. Customer C, 
represented by a steep curve, shows a strong ten-
dency to quit from early on. Clearly, this indicates

</p>
<p>that Customers B and C are likely to quit in the 
near future and they are the customers to be inter-
vened with.
</p>
<p>Once the need to intervene and the customers 
to be intervened with have been decided, firms 
have to identify when the intervention has to 
be made. The answer to this question lies with a 
proactive intervention strategy. That is, the cus-
tomers who show a strong tendency to quit (in 
this case Customers B and C) should be targeted 
with intervention offers by the firm. . Figure&nbsp;17.4 
shows the time periods in which Customers B and 
C should be intervened with.
</p>
<p>In . Fig.&nbsp;17.4, points I

</p>
<p>2
 denote the inter-
</p>
<p>vention points when customers B and C should 
be intervened and this is followed by a decrease 
in propensity to quit on the part of the customers. 
Here, Customer B is being intervened with in May 
2010 and Customer C in October 2009. The reason 
for the time lag between the customer intervention 
stems from their respective propensities to quit. 
So, while Customer C is intervened with early on, 
Customer B can be intervened with at a later stage.
</p>
<p>The decision on the channel of intervention and 
the type of offer through which the intervention is 
to be made is based on individual customer char-
acteristics. The amount of resources to be spent on 
each customer is directly linked to the Customer 
</p>
<p>Lifetime Value. If it costs the company $100 per 
customer to intervene with, it is not prudent to 
promote to a customer whose CLV is only $50. The 
company should intervene with an offer that costs 
less than $50. Thus, proactive intervention strate-
gies help companies to pre-empt customer attrition 
and thereby increase ROI.
</p>
<p>This strategy to prevent customer attrition was 
tested in a recent study for a telecommunications 
firm (Kumar &amp; George). The firm first computed 
the propensity to quit for all its customers using 
3&nbsp; years of transaction and marketing commu-
nication data. Then, they created two groups of 
matched customer pairs who were similar in 
terms of their propensity to quit and the exchange 
characteristics such as their revenue contribution 
to the firm and duration. In other words, the cus-
tomers in both groups had the same probability 
of quitting.
</p>
<p>The average revenue per customer in both 
groups was $600 per year. The test group had 2601 
customers and the control group had 2602 cus-
tomers. There was no intervention for the control 
group and this group was used to see the impact 
of intervention on the test group. For all custom-
ers in the test group, however, the firm predicted 
propensity to quit and identified those customers 
who are likely to quit.

</p>
<p>Based on the CLV of each customer, the firm 
designed customer-specific intervention strate-
gies for all vulnerable customers. The total cost of 
intervention for the firm was $40,000 for the test 
group. The intervention saved 643 customers for 
the firm. By multiplying the number of custom-
ers by the average revenue contribution per cus-
tomer, the total revenue gain was $385,800 for the 
group that was intervened. Thus, even after taking 
into account the cost of intervention, the firm had 
a net revenue gain of $345,800 by preventing attri-
tion and the return on investment was close to 
860% (i.e., the revenue contribution was 8.6 times 
the investment).
</p>
<p>From the above study, it is clear that churn 
models help firms to identify the customers who 
are likely to quit, the intervention strategy based 
on CLV helps to effectively intervene to retain 
valuable customers. In this regard, targeting prof-
itable prospects is an important planning phase for 
firms. Accurate customer profiling analysis helps 
firms implement a solid marketing strategy. Firms 
should target prospects precisely by choosing seg-
ments that match the firm&rsquo;s customer base and 
channels that match the customer&rsquo;s preferences. 
Additionally, firms should apply the knowledge 
gained about the new customers across the entire 
organization, cultivating customers, synchroniz-
ing departments and approaching customers on 
the one-to-one basis and providing solutions to 
their needs and wants.
</p>
<p>17.5  Customer Brand Value
</p>
<p>In our everyday lives, we come across different 
brands that we use. We perceive some brands 
as very high and some brands as very low. Why 
does this happen? Ideally, brands are developed 
to perform three important roles&mdash;(a) to draw 
new customers to the firm, (b) to remind existing 
customers about the products/services it offers, 
and (c) to forge an emotional attachment with its 
consumers (Rust, Lemon, &amp; Narayandas, 2004). 
When brands start to perform poorly on one or 
more of these roles, it starts to lose its sheen and 
falters.
</p>
<p>When a brand starts to face such hiccups, the 
brand manager or the marketing manager, and in 
some cases the entire corporate board faces some 
dilemma. Some of these questions include: (a) 
What do we invest on&mdash;building brands or build-
</p>
<p>ing the customer base? (b) How do we manage the 
brand? (c) What can we do to renew our relation-
ship with our customers? The single answer to all 
these questions is to strengthen the brand and 
nurture profitable customer relationships simul-
taneously. How can we achieve this?
</p>
<p>We can strengthen a brand by ascertaining 
and increasing the value a customer provides to 
the brand. This is value is referred to as CBV.&nbsp;And, 
we have already seen in the previous section that 
CLV can help firms in managing customer rela-
tionships profitably. Therefore, by establishing a 
link between CBV and CLV, we can strengthen the 
brand and build profitable relationships simul-
taneously. This section provides an approach to 
determine CBV and also designs an approach that 
will link CLV and CBV in order to ensure simul-
taneous growth in brand equity and customer 
equity.
</p>
<p>17.5.1  What Is Customer Brand 
Value?
</p>
<p>The concept of CBV refers to the differential effect 
of an individual&rsquo;s brand preference on his/her 
response to the marketing of a brand. It comprises 
of eight constructs (Kumar, Luo, &amp; Rao, 2008). 
They are:
</p>
<p> 5 Brand knowledge: Made up of a customer&rsquo;s 
awareness of the brand (brand awareness) 
and a customer&rsquo;s image of the brand (brand 
image).
</p>
<p> 5 Brand attitude: Made up of a customer&rsquo;s 
trust in the brand (brand trust) and a 
customer&rsquo;s emotional response towards the 
brand (brand affect).
</p>
<p> 5 Brand behavior intention: Made up of a 
customer&rsquo;s intention to purchase a brand 
(purchase intention).
</p>
<p> 5 Brand behavior: Made up of a customer&rsquo;s 
repeat-buying behavior (brand loyalty), rela-
tionship with other customers of the brand 
(brand advocacy), and willingness to pay 
a price premium over other brands (brand 
price premium behavior).
</p>
<p>Based on these eight constructs, it has been found 
that customers with greater brand value are more 
likely to engage in activities that result in an increase 
of customer lifetime value when compared to cus-
tomers with low brand value. Intuitively, we can 
</p>
<p>17.5 &middot; Customer Brand Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>374
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>understand that an individual customer&rsquo;s brand 
knowledge, brand attitude and brand behavior 
intentions affect his/her brand purchase behavior. 
When this brand purchase behavior of a customer 
is linked to their lifetime value, a firm can expect 
to maximize profitability. This brings us to the next 
question, how do we link CBV and CLV?
</p>
<p>17.5.2  Linking Customer Brand 
Value to&nbsp;Customer Lifetime 
Value
</p>
<p>The link between CBV and CLV is established 
using customer-level data and advanced modeling 
techniques. The customer-level data is important 
to compute CLV and CBV.&nbsp;We have already seen 
that data for computing CLV can be secured from 
the customer transaction database within the 
company. To compute CBV, firms can get infor-
mation regarding the various components of CBV 
from survey data. A survey that contains ques-
tions pertaining to the eight constructs can yield 
the firm information that is necessary for comput-
ing CBV.&nbsp; Once this information is available, the 
next step is to estimate how these components 
affect each other by using sophisticated estimation 
techniques. The components of CBV are obtained 
using a ten-point scale from a sample of custom-
ers. For the same customers, CLV is computed at 
that time. Conceptually, the CLV score is modeled 
as a function of these eight constructs.
</p>
<p>17.5.3  What Are the&nbsp;Managerial 
Benefits of&nbsp;Linking Customer 
Brand Value to&nbsp;Customer 
Lifetime Value?
</p>
<p>There are three key implications of linking CBV 
to CLV.&nbsp;They are:
</p>
<p> Monitor the&nbsp;Overall Performance 
of&nbsp;Customer Brand Value
</p>
<p>This linkage can help firms to monitor the overall 
performance of CBV.&nbsp;Firms can sample a group of 
existing and potential customers. Then, they can 
measure their individual brand values. Finally, 
they can identify the weak components in the indi-
vidual brand values and come up with different 
strategies to improve or positively influence them.
</p>
<p> Manage Brand at the&nbsp;Segment Level
</p>
<p>In order to manage the brand at a segment level, 
firms can segment customers based on CBV and 
CLV.&nbsp; This would yield a matrix with four cells, 
very similar to the &laquo;Managing loyalty and prof-
itability simultaneously&raquo; strategy of CLV (refer 
7 Chap. 15). Here, we can segment high CLV-
high CBV customers as &laquo;True Loyalists&raquo;; high 
CLV- low CBV customers as &laquo;Acquaintances&raquo;; low 
CLV-high CBV as &laquo;Poor Patrons&raquo;; and low CLV- 
low CBV customers as &laquo;Strangers&raquo;.
</p>
<p>The marketing strategy for &laquo;True Loyalists&raquo; is 
to keep building positive brand knowledge and 
attitude with this segment of customers. For the 
&laquo;Acquaintances&raquo; segment, firms should think 
of other ways to increase their CLV with lim-
ited brand investment. With regard to the &laquo;Poor 
Patrons&raquo; segment, firms should moderately invest 
to improve the brand values in this segment. 
They can encourage cross-buy and add-on sell-
ing to increase the customers&rsquo; CLV values. Finally 
for the &laquo;Strangers&raquo; segment, firms should invest 
moderately on the strangers who have the poten-
tial to increase their CLV values.
</p>
<p> Manage Brand at the&nbsp;Individual Level
</p>
<p>Firms can also manage brands at the individual 
customer level. We saw in the &laquo;Managing loyalty 
and profitability simultaneously&raquo; strategy of CLV 
that &laquo;True friends&raquo; are the most valuable asset of 
a company. Therefore, firms can manage brand at 
the individual level to make sure that the brand 
message appeals to this segment of customers. 
Firms should select a sample of True Friends and 
constantly monitor their individual knowledge 
structure, positive brand attitude, purchase inten-
tion, and brand behavior. Once the individual 
decision process is understood, personalized mar-
keting action can be performed to send the right 
message at the right time so that the individual&rsquo;s 
CLV and CBV can be simultaneously maximized.
</p>
<p>Until now, we have seen how a customer can 
provide value to a firm through his/her pur-
chases and to a brand through his/her preferences 
towards the brand. These two sources of value 
originate directly from the customers. However, a 
customer can also provide indirect value to a firm 
through his/her referrals or positive word-of- 
mouth. The next section discusses the Customer 
Referral Value metric, its measurement and strat-
egies to maximize it.

</p>
<p>17.6  Customer Referral Value
</p>
<p>Many firms now use viral marketing programs to 
harness the power of word-of-mouth and refer-
rals to acquire new customers. Typically, satisfied 
customers provide referrals and positive WOM to 
their friends or associates. Some of these referred 
customers will have the potential to be profitable 
customers of the firm. Consequently, a customer&rsquo;s 
CLV for a firm will not only be the profits they 
contribute but also the profits resulting from 
those they influence. This indirect value that a 
customer brings in through referrals is measured 
by the CRV metric.
</p>
<p>We have seen that the CLV metric is a supe-
rior customer value metric over all the con-
ventional metrics. However, the treatment this 
metric gives to customer satisfaction is not so 
complete. While it is true that the customer sat-
isfaction information is captured by accounting 
for customer buying behavior, it does not involve 
a direct measurement. It is clear that customers 
can not only contribute value to the firm through 
their own transactions (direct profits), but they 
also have an impact on the transactions of other 
customers through word-of-mouth and referrals 
(indirect profits) by helping the firm to acquire 
new customers at lower costs. Therefore, we need 
a metric such as CRV to determine the value of 
a customer&rsquo;s ability to spread word-of-mouth and 
make referrals.
</p>
<p>17.6.1  What Is Customer  
Referral Value?
</p>
<p>Customer Referral Value is defined as a custom-
er&rsquo;s expected future referral value with the firm. 
This metric enables managers to measure and 
manage each customer based on his ability to 
generate indirect profit to the firm. This indirect 
impact on the firm&rsquo;s profit comes through savings 
in acquisition costs and through the addition of 
new customers by way of customer referral.
</p>
<p>Calculating customer referral value (CRV) 
is more complex than calculating the lifetime 
value. Consider a customer, Jane, for whom we 
will compute the referral value. First, we need to 
compute the average number of successful refer-
rals she will make after we offer her an incentive 
to do so through a marketing campaign. As we 
</p>
<p>do for her CLV, we look at Jane&rsquo;s past behavior, 
but we need to look at a period longer than a 
month to get enough variance in the number 
of referrals for proper statistical modeling and 
predictive accuracy. The time period varies from 
industry to industry.
</p>
<p>Then, we need to estimate the time frame for 
which our marketing campaign has an impact in 
generating referrals. In other words, we need to 
determine the time until which Jane&rsquo;s referrals are 
actually prompted by our referral incentive. In 
research studies, it has been found that this time 
period is about 1&nbsp;year. That is, referrals made by 
customers after a referral-incentive marketing 
campaign can be attributed to that campaign for 
about a year. Therefore in computing CRV, we 
count only those referrals that are made within a 
year.
</p>
<p>Then, we need to determine how many of 
those referrals would have become custom-
ers of the firm anyway, even if Jane had not 
recommended the firm. The reason for deter-
mining this is simple. If a new customer, let&rsquo;s 
call him John, would not have joined without 
Jane&rsquo;s referral (referred to as a type-one refer-
ral), then Jane&rsquo;s referral value should include the 
value of John&rsquo;s business. However, if John would 
have become a customer without Jane&rsquo;s referral 
(referred to as a type-two referral), then, Jane&rsquo;s 
CRV should include only the savings in acquisi-
tion costs for John, since no direct marketing 
effort was needed to get him. Obtaining this 
information can be done through surveys by 
asking a simple question such as: &laquo;How likely 
is it that you would have purchased our prod-
uct/service without a referral in the next 12 
months?&raquo;.
</p>
<p>After collecting this information, we can com-
pute Jane&rsquo;s referral value as the present value of 
her type-one referrals plus the present value of her 
type-two referrals. Therefore, if we assume that if 
John would not have become a customer had Jane 
not referred him, then, Jane&rsquo;s type-one referral of 
John is essentially the same as his lifetime customer 
value&mdash;the present value of the difference between 
John&rsquo;s contribution to margin and the cost of mar-
keting to him, projected over 1&nbsp;year. Consequently, 
the value of type-two customers is the present value 
of the savings in acquisition costs. As with all cost-
revenue analyses, if the cost involved in acquiring 
type-two referrals exceeds the cost of alternative

</p>
<p>Having seen the concept and measurement of CRV, 
let us actually compute the CRV of a customer 
from a hypothetical financial services company.
</p>
<p>17.6.2  How Can Compute Customer 
Referral Value Be&nbsp;Computed?
</p>
<p>In order to value customers and see how they 
truly impact the bottom line of the company, let 
us consider a typical customer&mdash;Tom, from a 
financial services company. Using this customer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>referral behavior data from the company, we will 
compute his referral value (CRV). The data we 
need to compute the referral value is provided in 
. Table&nbsp;17.6.
</p>
<p>There are four steps involved in the  computation 
of CRV.&nbsp;They are:
</p>
<p> Step 1: Purchase
</p>
<p>In the first step, we determine whether customers 
would have made purchases anyway. As is evident 
from . Table&nbsp;17.6, Tom refers four customers per 
period (6&nbsp;months) and of those four customers, 
two would have joined anyway. So, n
</p>
<p>1
 in this case 
</p>
<p>is two and n
2
 in this case is four. For the purpose 
</p>
<p>of illustration, we consider here only the value of 
those customers who were directly referred by 
Tom and made a purchase. This approach can also 
be extended to include the value brought in by 
customers who were indirectly referred by Tom, 
wherever applicable.
</p>
<p> Step 2: Future Value
</p>
<p>In the second step, we predict the future value of 
each referred customer. The future value of each 
referred customer is based on that customer&rsquo;s 
gross margin per period ($98), marketing cost per 
period ($18), acquisition cost savings ($5), cost of 
referral ($40), and discount rate (15% annually).
</p>
<p> Step 3: Number of&nbsp;Referrals
</p>
<p>In the third step, we predict the number of refer-
rals generated. The number of referrals predicted 
for Tom is four per period. Because we are mea-
suring CRV for 1&nbsp;year, Tom will generate a total of 
eight referrals.

<p>377 17
</p>
<p> Step 4: Timing of&nbsp;Customer Referrals
</p>
<p>In the final step, we predict the timing of cus-
tomer referrals. Since, Tom refers four customers 
per period, in terms of timing this means that 
four customers are referred in the first half of the 
year and four customers are referred in the second 
half of the year.
</p>
<p>Applying these steps for the data we have for 
Tom, we get the following:

<p>Therefore, the total CRV for Tom for 1&nbsp; year is 
the sum of CRV
</p>
<p>1
 and CRV
</p>
<p>2
, which is around 
</p>
<p>$318. As the results show, the impact grows as 
time progresses. The main reason for this is the 
</p>
<p>growth of the customer base due to referrals in 
each period. In period 1, there were only four 
new customers, whereas in period 2 there were 
six customers in the value of the CRV (four new 
customers and two customers from period 1 who 
bought only because of the referral).
</p>
<p>As mentioned already, because this is a con-
servative estimate of the value of customer refer-
rals (that is, only the direct referrals are used in 
the CRV), it does not provide a true picture in 
terms of the number of new customers whohave 
been acquired by the firm and the total value all 
these new customers are worth to the firm. If we 
want to see how many new customers came on 
board over these two periods that stem from the 
original customer and the value of these new cus-
tomers, we need to look at both the direct and the 
indirect referrals (For more information on direct 
and indirect referrals see Kumar &amp; Bhaskaran, 
2010). If each of the customers who were referred 
during a specific period also made some referrals 
in subsequent periods, we would see an exponen-
tial growth in the total number of new custom-
ers who were acquired in the two periods and the 
total CRV for those customers. Given that CRV 
also considers the net present value brought in 
by a customer, one might wonder how CRV is 
linked with CLV.&nbsp;The following section provides 
the  linkage.
</p>
<p>17.6.3  How Can Customer Referral 
Value Be&nbsp;Linked to&nbsp;Customer 
Lifetime Value?
</p>
<p>Once the CRV of customers has been computed, 
it is essential for managers to understand the rela-
tionship it shares with CLV.&nbsp;Now that we have a 
measurement for both CLV and CRV, we know the 
value provided by the actual purchases made by the 
customer (CLV) and the influence that customer 
has on other potential customers (CRV). With this 
information, managers can begin to make deci-
sions about how to treat and market to customers 
based on the various combinations of whether the 
customer is low or high on CLV or CRV.
</p>
<p>As noted previously, many firms are using CLV 
as a method for selecting customers for word-of- 
mouth and referral campaigns. If the customers 
who rated highly on CLV were the same custom-
ers who rated highly on CRV, managers would 
not need to use both metrics when managing 
</p>
<p>17.6 &middot; Customer Referral Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>378
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>customers. However, because only transactional 
and demographic data (not attitudinal data) has 
played an important role in predicting CLV, cus-
tomers who score highly on CLV are probably not 
the same as those who are successful at referring 
new customers. In fact, a recent marketing study 
found that customers who score high on CRV are 
not the most valuable customers, as determined 
by CLV.&nbsp;This study used the transaction and refer-
ral behavior data from a telecommunications firm 
to investigate the link between CLV and CRV.&nbsp;The 
findings of the study are provided in . Table&nbsp;17.7 
(Kumar, Petersen, &amp; Leone, 2007).
</p>
<p>As is evident from . Table&nbsp;17.7, the top 30% 
of the customers ranked on the basis of CLV 
(deciles 1, 2 and 3) have no overlap with the top 
30% of customers based on CRV (deciles 5, 6, and 
7). This finding provides managers important 
insights on customer management. If managers 
ignored the concept of CRV and focused only on 
CLV, then they would miss out on the positive 
WOM and the cascading business it would gener-
ate. Consequently, if they focused only on CRV 
and ignored high CLV customers, they would be 
alienating the most valuable customers for want 
of positive WOM.&nbsp;Any of these two scenarios can 
cause much harm to customer growth and, in 
some cases may even generate negative WOM.
</p>
<p>17.6.4  What Are the&nbsp;Managerial 
Benefits of&nbsp;Linking Customer 
Referral Value and&nbsp;Customer 
Lifetime Value?
</p>
<p>To show the impact of measuring and managing 
these two metrics simultaneously, a field study 
was conducted with the telecommunications firm 
to see the benefits of measuring and managing 
CLV and CRV simultaneously.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of the field study, a test group 
and a control group of 9900 customers each were 
considered.CLV and CRV were measured for each 
of the groups. Based on these two values, the cus-
tomers in both groups were divided into four cells 
of a 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2 matrix. The cells were segmented on the 
following basis&mdash;high CLV/high CRV, high CLV/
low CRV, low CLV/high CRV, and low CLV/low 
CRV.&nbsp;The cutoff points for the four segments were 
determined based on the median value for both 
the CLV and CRV measures. . Figure&nbsp;17.5 sum-
marizes these results.
</p>
<p>Of the sample of 9900 customers, the &laquo;Misers&raquo; 
and &laquo;Champions&raquo; segments had 2079 customers 
each, and the &laquo;Affluents&raquo; and &laquo;Advocates&raquo; seg-
ments had 2871 customers each. These findings 
also validate the findings presented in . Fig.&nbsp;17.5 
that high CLV and high CRV customers are dis-
tinct sets of customers. The results of this mea-
surement of CLV and CRV show that there are 
distinct sets of customers found in the four dif-
ferent cells based on the large differences in the 
values for CLV and CRV across the cells. Further, 
it has to be noted that there exists a significant dif-
ference between the customers who are high on 
the CLV measure and those who are high on the 
CRV measure. Now, let us consider each of the 
cells separately.
</p>
<p>The &laquo;Affluents&raquo;, or the high CLV/low CRV 
customers, purchase a lot of products and services 
for themselves, but they do not refer many new 
customers to buy products and services. On the 
contrary, the &laquo;Misers&raquo;, or the low CLV/low CRV 
customers, do not purchase much or refer many 
new customers. Their low purchase behavior may 
be due to frequent brand switching, small SOW 
or they might be waiting to find out from others 
whether the product is worth purchasing.
</p>
<p>The &laquo;Advocates&raquo;, or the low CLV/high 
CRV customers, do not exhibit a high purchase 
behavior for themselves. However, they are

<p>actively involved in talking about the product 
to other customers and encouraging them to 
buy products. Finally, and true to their name, 
&laquo;Champions&raquo;, or the high CLV/high CRV cus-
tomers, are more likely to buy more products/
services from the company and talk more about 
them to other customers.
</p>
<p>Given the vast differences between the four 
cells, the customers in each of the cells should 
be evaluated differently with respect to their 
total value to the company and then approached 
with different types of marketing offers to get the 
</p>
<p>greatest overall value from them. To understand 
the true value of treating customers differently, 
the telecommunications firm initiated three dif-
ferent campaigns over the course of 1&nbsp;year in an 
effort to migrate customers from low CLV/CRV 
cells to high CLV/CRV cells. These campaigns 
were administered to the sample customers from 
the test group. The control sample did not receive 
any of these targeted marketing communications.

<p>goal in mind. The campaign for the &laquo;Misers&raquo; was 
designed to help the company identify opportu-
nities of building a relationship with them. This 
campaign not only offered incentives for them 
to buy more products for their own use, which 
would increase their CLV, but also offered them 
incentives to refer new customers, which would 
increase their CRV.&nbsp;The goal of this campaign was 
to migrate them toward one of the other three 
cells (&laquo;Affluents&raquo;, &laquo;Advocates&raquo;, or &laquo;Champions&raquo;), 
depending on whether the campaign increased 
their CLV, their CRV, or both.
</p>
<p>The campaign for the &laquo;Affluents&raquo; was launched 
to encourage referral behavior using referral incen-
tives, while retaining their CLV at the highest level. 
And when their referral value increases, it will 
cause them to migrate toward the &laquo;Champions&raquo; 
cell. Additionally, this will also increase the aver-
age CLV of the &laquo;Champions&raquo; cell over time, as 
the &laquo;Affluents&raquo; bring their high CLV with them. 
Similarly, the campaign for the &laquo;Advocates&raquo; was 
designed to encourage these customers to spend 
more while at the same time keeping their CRV at 
the highest level. The company could potentially 
gain a higher direct profit from these customers by 
migrating them to the &laquo;Champions&raquo; cell.
</p>
<p>So, what was the result of all these campaigns? 
The study tracked the three segments individually 
and monitored their performance. At the end of 
1&nbsp; year, the company realized impressive results 
from these campaigns. . Table&nbsp;17.9 presents the 
results of the campaigns.
</p>
<p>From . Table&nbsp; 17.9 it is clear that the goal to 
migrate customers was achieved. After admin-
istering the campaign, the number of customers 
in the &laquo;Misers&raquo; segment decreased from 21% to 
9%. Of the 12% who migrated to other segments, 
4% of the customers went to the &laquo;Affluents&raquo;, 
&laquo;Champions&raquo; and &laquo;Advocates&raquo; segments each. 
The gains from this migration were also sub-
stantial. The average CLV of the &laquo;Affluents&raquo;, 
&laquo;Champions&raquo; and &laquo;Advocates&raquo; increased by 
185%, 138% and 422% respectively. Additionally, 
the &laquo;Champions&raquo; segment also witnessed a 328% 
increase in its average CRV.&nbsp; In actual numbers, 
of the original sample of customers from the 
&laquo;Misers&raquo; cell (2079 customers), 396 of them 
moved toward &laquo;Champions&raquo; and produced 
increases of CLV of $71,280 and CRV of $83,160. 
While these numbers may seem small, this would 
</p>
<p>produce huge numbers when projected to the 
entire customer base of the company.
</p>
<p>With respect to the &laquo;Affluents&raquo; segment, 
nearly 4% of the customers migrated to the 
&laquo;Champions&raquo; segment. In value terms, this 
resulted in a 388% increase in referral value gains. 
This means that not only is the telecommunica-
tions firm increasing its revenue from all its cus-
tomers, but that the customer base is growing, 
too. This allows the firm to greatly expand its cus-
tomer base and find new revenue sources outside 
of just trying to cross-sell and up-sell to its cur-
rent customers.
</p>
<p>With respect to the &laquo;Advocates&raquo; segment, 
nearly 5% of the customers migrated to the 
&laquo;Champions&raquo; segment. This resulted in an increase 
of 61% in its average CLV.&nbsp;In this case, the telecom-
munications firm has been able to take customers 
who it would have initially ignored if they were 
looking only at CLV because of their low CLV and 
moved them toward the most desirable cell in the 
2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2 matrix (those with high CLV and CRV).
</p>
<p>It is therefore clear from these findings that the 
strategy was successful in not only migrating cus-
tomers toward better cells, but also in moving these 
customers to cells that have significantly higher 
CLV, CRV, or both. Now, one might wonder how 
much it cost the company to run these campaigns, 
and whether the gains were worthwhile or not. The 
cost of the three campaigns, which included direct 
mail, email, and selected telephone calls for the 
7821 customers (customers from the three cells: 
&laquo;Affluents&raquo;, &laquo;Misers&raquo;, and &laquo;Advocates&raquo;) in the 
sample, was approximately $31,500. On a per cus-
tomer basis, this would be nearly $4 per customer. 
The overall profit obtained through increases in 
each customer&rsquo;s CLV or CRV from each of the 
three campaigns was $486,090. Therefore, the over-
all ROI of the campaign was around 15.5.
</p>
<p>As evident in . Table&nbsp; 17.9, the ROI from 
running these three customized campaigns has 
generated significant gains in profit. It is also 
important to note that a considerable amount of 
customization is required to realize such gains. 
Therefore, while this study cannot be directly 
applied in another industry, with similar custom-
izations similar gains can be achieved. Now that 
we have learned about CRV and its link to CLV, 
let us see the managerial implications of adopting 
this approach.

<p>17.6 &middot; Customer Referral Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>382
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>17.6.5  What Should the&nbsp;Focus Be&nbsp;on: 
Customer Referral Value or 
Customer Lifetime Value?
</p>
<p>Companies like Bank of America and Vonage 
have introduced a value-oriented referral incen-
tive program that rewards both the referral and 
the referring customer. Bank of America rewards 
both the referral and the referring customer $25 
whenever a referral opens a personal checking 
account. Similarly, when a business owner opens 
a business checking account both the referral and 
the referring customer get $50.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, Vonage leverages the social 
media buzz to reward the referring customer. For 
every referral that signs up for Vonage service, the 
referring customer gets 1&nbsp; month of free service. 
Similarly, DIRECTV provides $100 to both the 
referral and the referring customer. This reward 
is offered in the form of $10 monthly bill credits 
for 10 consecutive months. These incentives seem 
to be in proportion to the typical value brought in 
by each member in the respective referral groups.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is clear that customers who score 
highly on the CLV measure are not the same cus-
tomers who score highly on the CRV measure. 
Further, firms should measure both CLV and 
CRV to implement marketing campaigns that 
focus on customers based on both dimensions. A 
marketing campaign that focuses on both metrics 
will allow firms to both increase the profitability 
of each customer and, cash in on the power of 
positive WOM.
</p>
<p>Now the question is how managers can know 
which campaign to choose&mdash;a campaign for CLV 
or a campaign for CRV? In other words, is there a 
trade-off when maximizing one versus the other? 
With information about the objective of the cam-
paign, the stage of the product in its life cycle, the 
potential number of prospects in the pool, and 
</p>
<p>the nature of competition in the market, manag-
ers can decide on the nature of the campaign that 
will drive revenue and profit.
</p>
<p>A CLV campaign would be most appropriate 
in a situation where the goal is to get users to buy 
more in a specific category or buy across more cat-
egories. Typically, such campaigns happen in com-
petitive markets where it is tough to acquire new 
customers or in niche markets where the prospect 
pool is very limited. On the other hand, a CRV 
campaign would be most appropriate in a situa-
tion where the aim is to acquire more customers/
prospects through their current customers. This 
is because, the current customers may already be 
spending the majority of their budget with the 
company, and programs to increase cross-selling 
or up-selling would not yield much success. Of 
course, the caveat in selecting the choice of cus-
tomers for CRV campaigns is to be cognizant of 
the fact that high-CLV customers are not the cus-
tomers who refer the most. The study explained 
here shows the importance of measuring the value 
of a customer&rsquo;s own transactions and the value of 
their impact on the transactions of other custom-
ers, and not one or the other in isolation.
</p>
<p>It is therefore important to encourage custom-
ers to build social networks and provide referral 
incentives for them to talk to other customers. 
Strong social networks can also be a source of long-
term competitive advantage for both the custom-
ers and the firm. This is because, it becomes harder 
for the competitors to lure away customers who 
are tightly locked in to their social network, while 
at the same time consumers in a strong network 
enjoy ease of information sharing about products 
and services and the use of common products and 
services. Therefore, a firm should view its custom-
ers as skilled resources and work with them to 
build strong social networks through which both 
the firm and the customer can benefit.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>Customer equity is the aggregation of the 
</p>
<p>expected lifetime values of a firm&rsquo;s entire base 
</p>
<p>of existing customers and the expected future 
</p>
<p>value of newly acquired customers. The NPV 
</p>
<p>objective function required to maximize the 
</p>
<p>customer equity of a firm is related to the cash 
</p>
<p>flow from each customer, the expected interpur-
</p>
<p>chase time, and the cost and frequency of the 
</p>
<p>marketing/communication strategies employed. 
</p>
<p>The objective function is based on a probability 
</p>
<p>model which predicts the interpurchase time 
</p>
<p>of each customer, a panel data model which 
</p>
<p>predicts the cash flows from each customer, and 
</p>
<p>an optimization algorithm which maximizes 
</p>
<p>the profits. By applying an optimization model,

<p>profits. Identifying and targeting responsive and 
</p>
<p>profitable customers and deemphasizing efforts 
</p>
<p>on some customers who were not profitable-
</p>
<p>irrespective of whether they are classified as 
</p>
<p>long-duration or short-duration customers-
</p>
<p>would be a better approach. Customer value-
</p>
<p>based approach demonstrated its superiority to 
</p>
<p>the duration of association approach in terms of 
</p>
<p>profitable segmentation of customers.
</p>
<p>Purchase sequence model captures the 
</p>
<p>differences in the durations between purchases 
</p>
<p>for  different product categories. An individual 
</p>
<p>customer-level profit function is developed to 
</p>
<p>predict customer value. The success of the 
</p>
<p>experiment based on the model demonstrated 
</p>
<p>by higher revenue, lower cost of communica-
</p>
<p>tion, lower number of attempts before a 
</p>
<p>purchase is made, higher profits, and higher ROI 
</p>
<p>for the test group, when compared to the 
</p>
<p>control group, indicates the scope to which the 
</p>
<p>customer value approach offers in improving 
</p>
<p>the quality of marketing decisions.
</p>
<p>The acquisition-process is an integral 
</p>
<p>component of the research model. By linking 
</p>
<p>acquisition and the retention process, it is possible 
</p>
<p>to see a complete and unbiased picture of the 
</p>
<p>drivers behind customers election/acquisition, 
</p>
<p>relationship duration, and customer profitability. 
</p>
<p>Also, making the necessary trade-off between 
</p>
<p>offensive processes and defensive processes 
</p>
<p>requires a full specification of the key dimensions 
</p>
<p>of the customer- firm relationship. A more 
</p>
<p>complete model specification addresses the key 
</p>
<p>managerial question of whether the maximization 
</p>
<p>of the respective objective functions as acquisi-
</p>
<p>tion likelihood, lifetime duration, and customer 
</p>
<p>value would lead to convergent or divergent 
</p>
<p>resource allocation recommendations. This model 
</p>
<p>applies mainly to situations where managers rely 
</p>
<p>mostly on direct customer communication. 
</p>
<p>Acquisition expenditures will have diminishing 
</p>
<p>marginal associations with customer profitability. 
</p>
<p>Retention expenditures will have diminishing 
</p>
<p>marginal associations with relationship duration 
</p>
<p>and with customer profitability. Highly interper-
</p>
<p>sonal contact channels have a greater association 
</p>
<p>with the likelihood of customer acquisition and 
</p>
<p>relationship duration than less interpersonal 
</p>
<p>contact channels. Though the results are specific 
</p>
<p>to the empirical context, the model can be 
</p>
<p>applied to any environment where acquisition 
</p>
<p>and retention efforts can be separated. Managers 
</p>
<p>can use the proposed integrated framework not 
</p>
<p>only to better understand the drivers of profitabil-
</p>
<p>ity, but also to know how to maximize profitability 
</p>
<p>through optimal allocation of resources.
</p>
<p>Reaching out to potential customers with 
</p>
<p>targeted offers has never been easier. Discover-
</p>
<p>ing the firm&rsquo;s best target requires extensive 
</p>
<p>customer profiling research. Firms need compre-
</p>
<p>hensive, reliable customer profile information to 
</p>
<p>effectively customize their marketing plans. 
</p>
<p>Targeting specific audience and understanding 
</p>
<p>the demographic characteristics, lifestyle 
</p>
<p>behaviors and purchase preferences that drive 
</p>
<p>customers&rsquo; buying decisions leads to a successful 
</p>
<p>marketing campaign. The strategy described and 
</p>
<p>illustrated here shows the effect of the customer 
</p>
<p>intervention strategy in a telecom firm. Using the 
</p>
<p>strategy, the firm realized a net revenue gain of 
</p>
<p>$345,000 after accounting for the cost of 
</p>
<p>intervention, and the ROI was close to 860%. This 
</p>
<p>clearly shows that the key to retaining customers 
</p>
<p>is to identify those who are likely to quit and 
</p>
<p>reach them with appropriate messages.
</p>
<p>Customer brand value refers to the differential 
</p>
<p>effect of an individual&rsquo;s brand preference on his/
</p>
<p>her response to the marketing of a brand. When 
</p>
<p>companies understand the link between CBV and 
</p>
<p>CLV, they can efficiently allocate their resources to 
</p>
<p>generate maximum value. The CBV is influenced 
</p>
<p>by several factors such as brand knowledge, 
</p>
<p>brand attitude, and brand behavior intentions. By 
</p>
<p>establishing a link between these factors to the 
</p>
<p>final customer behavior outcomes, firms can 
</p>
<p>effectively manage the CBV and CLV simultane-
</p>
<p>ously. Additionally, this linkage enables firms to 
</p>
<p>take appropriate corrective measures to simulta-
</p>
<p>neously build both the customer&rsquo;s brand value 
</p>
<p>and lifetime value.
</p>
<p>Customer referral value refers to a customer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>expected future profits obtained through his 
</p>
<p>referrals. This chapter has shown that it is

<p>Overview
</p>
<p>CRM has become an integral function in cor-
</p>
<p>porate strategies in recent years as marketing 
</p>
<p>strategies are becoming increasingly customer-
</p>
<p>centric. From multinational corporations to 
</p>
<p>small businesses, firms of all industries and sizes 
</p>
<p>are investing more resources into CRM and plac-
</p>
<p>ing a greater emphasis on its role in marketing 
</p>
<p>to their customers. The growth in importance of 
</p>
<p>CRM implementation is exemplified in the case 
</p>
<p>of Zappos, the online shoe retailing phenom-
</p>
<p>enon. Founded in 1999, Zappos has grown to 
</p>
<p>become the internet&rsquo;s largest shoe retailer and 
</p>
<p>was sold to 7 Amazon.com for $1.2 billion in 
</p>
<p>2009 (Hsieh, 2010).
</p>
<p>At Zappos the entire company philosophy 
</p>
<p>starts with customer service and CRM profi-
</p>
<p>ciency. By adopting a customer-centric business 
</p>
<p>model that preaches customer satisfaction, and 
</p>
<p>not monetary profit as the day to day goal has 
</p>
<p>been integral in their massive success over the 
</p>
<p>last decade. All newly hired employees includ-
</p>
<p>ing executives are required to participate in a 
</p>
<p>4-week customer loyalty course in order to have 
</p>
<p>all company members buy into the company 
</p>
<p>concept and mission (Beaudry, 2009). While 
</p>
<p>product and brand loyalty are at an all time low, 
</p>
<p>Zappos has made it its mission to provide cus-
</p>
<p>tomers with the kind of individual attention that 
</p>
<p>is increasingly scarce.
</p>
<p>Zappos customer service is intent on know-
</p>
<p>ing everything about their customers&rsquo; lives. The 
</p>
<p>story of a middle aged woman, Zaz Lamarr, is a 
</p>
<p>great example of the in-depth customer knowl-
</p>
<p>edge that Zappos strives to obtain. Lamarr 
</p>
<p>meant to return some shoes to Zappos, but her 
</p>
<p>mother passed away and, naturally, she just did 
</p>
<p>not have the time. Zappos launched an inquiry 
</p>
<p>to find out what was happening to the shoes, 
</p>
<p>and Lamarr informed them that she had not had 
</p>
<p>the time to return them due to these exigent 
</p>
<p>circumstances. Without hesitation, Zappos 
</p>
<p>arranged to have UPS come pick up the shoes 
</p>
<p>before sending her flowers and their deepest 
</p>
<p>condolences (Marco, 2007). All of these new 
</p>
<p>means of gathering and disseminating data are 
</p>
<p>facilitating relationships, and when building 
</p>
<p>customer loyalty, being able to incorporate 
</p>
<p>mutual benefit as the foundation for the rela-
</p>
<p>tionship can go a long way.
</p>
<p>To understand the future of CRM, let us first 
</p>
<p>take a step back and look at where CRM stands 
</p>
<p>right now by summarizing the three different 
</p>
<p>CRM perspectives that were discussed through-
</p>
<p>out the previous chapters.
</p>
<p>The first perspective, Strategic CRM, has as an 
</p>
<p>objective to mold the interactions between a firm 
</p>
<p>and its customers in order to maximize CLV for the 
</p>
<p>firm. Firms must be aware that customers vary in 
</p>
<p>their value contributed through their purchases, 
</p>
<p>and therefore strive to shape the customer-firm 
</p>
<p>interaction through acquisition and retention strat-
</p>
<p>egies aimed at driving firm profitability. This com-
</p>
<p>plex set of customer-oriented activities forms the 
</p>
<p>foundation for a sustainable and inimitable com-
</p>
<p>petitive advantage leading to a successful strategic 
</p>
<p>CRM.&nbsp;As discussed in the text (7 Chaps. 3 and 4), 
</p>
<p>the four integral inputs in a CRM strategy are:
</p>
<p>1. A customer-management orientation.
</p>
<p>2.  Integration and alignment of organizational 
</p>
<p>processes.
</p>
<p>3.  Capture of information and alignment of 
</p>
<p>technology.
</p>
<p>4. Implementation of CRM strategy.
</p>
<p>The second perspective, Analytical CRM, is designed 
</p>
<p>to help firms migrate from relying entirely on tradi-
</p>
<p>tional marketing metrics to customer-based value 
</p>
<p>metrics. This change has been possible largely 
</p>
<p>due to technological advancements in collecting 
</p>
<p>and mining customer-level data to glean insights 
</p>
<p>regarding customers, markets, products, and pro-
</p>
<p>cesses. This data mining process is essential to 
</p>
<p>providing businesses the ability to make informed, 
</p>
<p>knowledge driven strategic business decisions in 
</p>
<p>order to predict future trends and behaviors.
</p>
<p>The third perspective, Operational CRM, is 
</p>
<p>gaining significant traction among firms due 
</p>
<p>to changes with respect to (1) consumers, (2) 
</p>
<p>marketplaces, (3) technology, and (4) marketing 
</p>
<p>functions.
</p>
<p>1.  With respect to consumers, factors such as 
</p>
<p>increasing customer diversity, time scarcity, 
</p>
<p>value consciousness, intolerance for low service 
</p>
<p>levels, information availability and techno-
</p>
<p>logical aptitude, and decrease in loyalty have 
</p>
<p>contributed to constantly changing customer 
</p>
<p>profiles. These changes in customer profiles 
</p>
<p>have significantly impacted consumer power 
</p>
<p>and choice, and thereby profits for businesses.

<p>18.1  Social CRM
</p>
<p>One of the newest and fastest growing forms of 
CRM is Social CRM.&nbsp;The emergence of the social 
web has been the focal point and the catalyst for 
the growth of Social CRM.&nbsp;With the emergence of 
peer-to-peer networks, conversations no longer 
have boundaries and limitations. These networks 
are increasingly influencing how customers inter-
act with each other and how businesses use the 
social media tools to manage customer relation-
ships. We provide here a review of the popular 
social media channels and their influence in CRM 
activities.
</p>
<p>18.1.1  Popular Social  
Media Channels
</p>
<p> Blogs
</p>
<p>The blogosphere has changed drastically since its 
emergence two decades ago. Blogs started from 
very humble beginnings in the 1990s and quickly 
</p>
<p>rose to popularity. Originally used for people to 
journal their thoughts, the number of blogs sur-
passed one hundred million in 2008 (University 
of Minnesota Libraries Publishing, 2015). At its 
very early stages, blogs had to be updated manu-
ally, and there were not many blogging platforms. 
Eventually, more platforms began to emerge such 
as LiveJournal and Blogger-the latter is credited 
with bringing blogging to the mainstream. By the 
end of the 1990s, there were 23 blogs on the inter-
net and that number rose astronomically to 
50&nbsp; million by 2006. In its earlier years, political 
blogs were more popular. In the early 2000&rsquo;s, blog 
content shifted to deeper analyses of current 
events and pop culture than what traditional 
media was doing at the time. In addition, more 
light-hearted topics were  discussed in blogs such 
as &laquo;how-to&raquo; blogs and blogs about blogging. Blogs 
such as WordPress and TypePad emerged during 
this time period. In the mid-2000s, blogging had 
reached the mainstream. By 2010, the number of 
blogs reached 152 million. By this time, a vast 
number of individuals had at least one blog. 
</p>
<p>2.  The global marketplace has changed sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly over the past few decades due to 
</p>
<p>increased globalization, and the growth in 
</p>
<p>the services economy and advancements in 
</p>
<p>technology. These catalysts have been the 
</p>
<p>root cause for intensified competition for cus-
</p>
<p>tomers, market segmentation, and product/
</p>
<p>service differentiation in the marketplace. 
</p>
<p>As a consequence of these trends, a good 
</p>
<p>product is no longer sufficient to compete 
</p>
<p>and harder to differentiate in a world of high 
</p>
<p>product standards. Due to this, companies are 
</p>
<p>focusing more on enduring commercial rela-
</p>
<p>tionships through behavioral and purchase 
</p>
<p>histories in order to customize products 
</p>
<p>and services. This shift to a customer-centric 
</p>
<p>model has underlined the importance of 
</p>
<p>Customer Relationship Management for com-
</p>
<p>panies in their market positioning.
</p>
<p>3.  The supply and demand of data storage tech-
</p>
<p>nology has changed dramatically, with the 
</p>
<p>former getting cheaper despite increasing in 
</p>
<p>quality, and the latter experiencing an explo-
</p>
<p>sive growth in data that is available for stor-
</p>
<p>age. This is due to the growth in online visits 
</p>
<p>by consumers, which consequently increases 
</p>
<p>the amount of transactions, web log files, and 
</p>
<p>applications. All of the above increases have 
</p>
<p>provided firms with revolutionary opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties to inform themselves regarding customer 
</p>
<p>behavior and attitudes. Having said that, the 
</p>
<p>real value in this opportunity exists in firms&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>ability to manage, analyze, and apply such a 
</p>
<p>mass of insight and information to drive prof-
</p>
<p>its for the companies.
</p>
<p>4.  The nature and methods of marketing com-
</p>
<p>munications are experiencing prominent 
</p>
<p>changes, with direct and interactive media 
</p>
<p>outpacing traditional mass marketing 
</p>
<p>techniques due to their ability to customize 
</p>
<p>and adapt to increasingly segmented and 
</p>
<p>demanding consumers.
</p>
<p>Having reviewed the various CRM perspectives 
</p>
<p>and how businesses have transformed over the 
</p>
<p>years, it is clear that marketing has had a signifi-
</p>
<p>cant role in the transformation. As we look ahead, 
</p>
<p>there are some developments that we expect 
</p>
<p>would bring in the next wave of transformation 
</p>
<p>into the marketing realm. This chapter discusses 
</p>
<p>some of the developments that are already mak-
</p>
<p>ing considerable headway in the business world.

</p>
<p>Companies had even started to join the trend 
(Webdesigner Depot, 2013).
</p>
<p>Companies&rsquo; decision to join the trend was 
spun by consumers becoming more electronically 
vocal about brands and companies&rsquo; desire to 
become more customer oriented. Consumers were 
voicing their sentiment regarding a particular 
brand on blogs which revealed a clear need for 
marketers to listen to the peer-to-peer conversa-
tions and respond accordingly. Furthermore, 
given the importance of blogs in consumer deci-
sion-making (through product and brand reviews) 
it proved to be an important medium that market-
ers could channel favorably to promote their prod-
ucts, services, or brands (Verna, 2010).
</p>
<p>Companies eagerly engaged in this social 
media space until 2014. A study conducted by the 
University of Massachusetts Center of Marketing 
Research, found that corporate use of blogs 
started declining in 2014 citing a 3% decrease 
from 2013. In 2015, the usage decreased even 
more to 21% of Fortune 500 companies using 
blogs which was 10% less than in 2014. The blog 
trend for companies shifted to other social media 
platforms such as Instagram. The study revealed 
that although traditional blogs are still a powerful 
tool for marketing, corporations have started 
shifting their efforts to other social media outlets 
that are steadily on the rise (Barnes, Lescault, &amp; 
Holmes, 2015).
</p>
<p>As a recent development, micro-blogging sites 
such as Twitter are becoming an important chan-
nel of communication for companies to interact 
with customer groups. In 2015, 78% of Fortune 
500 companies had a corporate Twitter account 
(Barnes et&nbsp; al., 2015). Many companies such as 
Ford Motors and CVS Health are using Twitter as 
a communication portal for customer service, and 
the feedback has helped the companies gain a bet-
ter understanding of how their consumers view 
them as a brand and plan accordingly (Melberg, 
2014; Talty, 2011).
</p>
<p> E-Mail
</p>
<p>E-mail has remained one of the most used forms 
of direct marketing. According to the Direct 
Marketing Association, in 2015, for every dollar 
spent on email marketing, an average ROI of $38 
was yielded. In 2013, an average ROI of $24.93 
was reported. This 53% increase in average returns 
is why companies continue to utilize email as a 
source for marketing. Companies reported in 
</p>
<p>2015 their intent to spend more on email market-
ing compared to previous years (DMA, 2015).
</p>
<p>Although email proves to have a rewarding 
ROI, many still projected emails would be 
replaced by social media networks such as 
Snapchat and Slack. Experts at the Direct 
Marketing Association report otherwise. They 
expect email to be around for many years to come 
with social media only enhancing its benefits. 
According to the 2016 Direct Marketing 
Association Response Rate Report, emails offer a 
122% ROI with social media ROI of 28% coming 
in second. Email ROI is expected to increase even 
more in the coming years due to companies such 
as Google and Microsoft investing in ways to 
improve email response rates (Boone, 2017).
</p>
<p>Furthermore, given the economic downturn in 
2008, companies have made a conscious effort to 
engage in more cost effective ways to continue 
running their businesses. The cost-effective nature 
of email marketing has made it increasingly attrac-
tive as marketers strive to communicate with and 
cater to their customers at a low cost. Email has 
proven to be a rewarding solution to cutting cost 
while still improving company revenue.
</p>
<p>A study conducted 2015 by the Direct 
Marketing Association, found that over half of the 
companies represented in its findings reported an 
increase in email open rates (DMA, 2015). With 
the average person checking their email 74 times a 
day, and emails being more effective at customer 
acquisition than Facebook and Twitter, more com-
panies have started to recognize the value emails 
add to a company (Boone, 2017). As a result, more 
companies are engaging in email marketing, and 
consumer emails are being flooded with company 
advertisements. In order to maintain email effec-
tiveness, companies have to start engaging in 
smarter emailing techniques. In order to take 
emails to the next level and optimize email mar-
keting value potential, companies should engage 
in better email marketing. Research conducted on 
a customer&rsquo;s decision to opt-in or opt-out of an 
email marketing program suggests that intensity 
and content play a major role in the decision. It is 
important to note the study was conducted using 
the influence of a company&rsquo;s direct mail marketing 
program on their email marketing program. The 
study found that an increase in one direct mail 
advertisement would on average prolong a cus-
tomer&rsquo;s email opt-in time by 13.6&nbsp;months, and as 
the number increases, the opt-in period increases. 
</p>

<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>For opt-out time periods, each additional direct 
mailer advertisement extends the customer email 
opt-out period, but this positive impact reverses 
once a threshold is reached. The conclusions 
drawn from the research suggests that direct mail 
and email programs intensity and content need to 
be monitored in order to optimize the benefits 
email marketing can provide. In addition to moni-
toring email and direct mail intensity, findings 
suggest advertising content match the customer&rsquo;s 
interest (Kumar, Zhang, &amp; Luo, 2014). Amazon 
understands the benefits in sending emails based 
on their customer&rsquo;s interests. The online retailer 
sends its customers email advertisements related 
to previous purchases, items in their virtual cart, 
or browsing history. Amazon&rsquo;s data mining tech-
niques allows them to better understand their cus-
tomer and cater the marketing to that particular 
customer&rsquo;s interest. Amazon reported a 29% sales 
increase following the deployment of their recom-
mendation tactics (Rejoiner, 2016).
</p>
<p>Due to the growing trend of online shopping, 
and consumers&rsquo; desire for quick, hassle-free shop-
ping, email marketing is a key tool that companies 
can use to remain relevant in today&rsquo;s market. 
Optimizing this powerful tool takes utilizing bet-
ter techniques to acquire and maintain customer 
loyalty.
</p>
<p> Social Networking Platforms
</p>
<p>Years ago, many felt the internet was just a fad, 
and that &laquo;cyber business&raquo; was a joke. Today those 
sentiments have been disproven many times over. 
People are now purchasing items, watching mov-
ies, listening to music, etc., all on the internet. The 
once unfathomed idea has become a reality. To 
rattle tradition even more, people are now social-
izing on the internet. Today, social networking is 
transforming the business world similar to how 
the internet changed things at the start of its 
emergence (Holmes, 2015).
</p>
<p>Social networking platforms have been the 
hottest topic of discussion for marketers in the past 
few years. In 2015, 75% of U.S. adult internet users 
also utilized social media, and for millennials and 
younger that number was even higher (Holmes, 
2015). The number of worldwide social media 
users is expected to grow to 2.5 billion by 2018 
(Pick, 2016). The high usage of social media makes 
it an obvious channel for companies to utilize for 
brand marketing. In 2015, 96% of marketers stated 
they actively use social media for marketing 
</p>
<p>(Stelzner, 2015). Social Media&rsquo;s substantial growth 
over the past years has made social networking 
one of the most lucrative and high potential mar-
keting and CRM tools. The market research firm, 
eMarketer estimated in 2015 that advertising rev-
enues on social networking platforms would accel-
erate worldwide with Facebook being the main 
driver of the growth. In 2017, worldwide social 
network ad revenues are expected to reach $41 bil-
lion, and Facebook is expected to possess $26.98 
billion of those revenues (eMarketer, 2015). So 
how well are businesses utilizing social media plat-
forms to connect with their consumers and 
improve brand performance?
</p>
<p>In a 2014 study by Gigaom Research, social 
media marketing was deemed by companies as 
37% effective at customer retention coming in 
only second to email marketing (Deal, 2014). A 
different survey conducted the same year on sale 
professionals&rsquo; metrics found that salespeople with 
social media skills were six times more likely to 
exceed their sales goal compared to their peers 
that lacked social media skills (Biro, 2015). In 
addition to customer retention and meeting sales 
goals, social media can offer many other benefits 
if used effectively.
</p>
<p>Identifying and targeting micro-segments of 
consumers, starting dialogs with consumers, and 
building brand awareness are all benefits that 
firms can profit from by establishing and manag-
ing their presence on social media platforms. 
Companies such as Papa John&rsquo;s, RedBull, and 
Target have used Facebook as a means of creating 
a new portal into their &laquo;world&raquo;. While Papa John&rsquo;s 
engages in free give-aways for &laquo;liking&raquo;, RedBull 
has essentially transposed their website onto their 
Facebook page, and Target has used their page as 
a platform for promoting their CSR efforts. All the 
three companies have used distinctly unique 
approaches, with the same common goal of rais-
ing and improving brand awareness.
</p>
<p> Podcasts and&nbsp;Internet Radio
</p>
<p>The use of podcasts has been on the rise. In 2016, 
17% of Americans over 12 reported they listened 
to a podcast at least once a month. This is an 8% 
increase from 2008. Even though podcast use has 
been increasing, marketers are still hesitant to 
commit large amounts of money towards this 
advertising channel (Perlberg, 2016).
</p>
<p>Marketers find it hard to justify excessive 
spending in this area because it is hard to quantify 
</p>
<p>18.1 &middot; Social CRM</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>390
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>the number of podcasts listeners, and even more 
difficult to measure the number of listeners that 
actually listen to the advertisements. Since pod-
casts advertisements are expensive, companies 
fear investing too much money in an area that is 
hard to quantify in terms of ROI.&nbsp; Companies 
hesitance in this sector does not equate to the 
rewards this medium has to offer. It just means 
companies want to ensure they are reaping some 
sort of benefit if they are investing money towards 
it (Perlberg, 2016).
</p>
<p>Research from Arbitron/Edison and internet 
radio ad network TargetSpot has uncovered inter-
esting results with regards to the rise of Pandora 
and other online radio stations. On the one hand, 
Pandora provides demographic details on the indi-
vidual listener since users have to fill out an infor-
mation form when registering, which can be very 
useful to marketers in segmenting and customiz-
ing their messages on an individual basis. On the 
other hand, a rise in internet radio listening seems 
to have coincided with a rise in over the air radio 
listening, and subsequently, a rise in ad expendi-
tures through this medium. Until there are clear 
signs of online radio stations replacing the tradi-
tional radio medium, marketers will be hesitant to 
go with the lower volume and unknown option. 
Another difficulty that marketers are encountering 
with podcasts is being able to sift through the hun-
dreds of millions of podcasts and internet radio 
outlets and determine which ones will best help 
them communicate with their target markets.
</p>
<p> Mobile Applications
</p>
<p>Recent research performed by the mobile analyt-
ics firm Flurry has revealed that mobile applica-
tions have gained a greater share of users&rsquo; time 
commitment than the web has. Flurry reported an 
overall mobile application usage growth of 58% in 
2015 (Khalaf, 2016). In 2016, the growth usage 
slowed with reports of only 11% growth. This 
reduction in usage is not due to a decline in users. 
The reduction in growth is due to the massive 
number of applications on the market for con-
sumers to enjoy. There are only so many hours in 
a day, and with the growing number of applica-
tions, consumers do not have any available time to 
add additional applications to their list. Choosing 
an additional application to enjoy means neglect-
ing a former application. Although, usage growth 
has slowed, time spent using mobile applications 
</p>
<p>grew 69% in 2016 (Khalaf, 2016, 2017). Mobile 
applications, though at it is very mature age, is still 
popular in today&rsquo;s world. According to U.S based 
market research firm World Mobile Applications 
Market, the mobile application market was valued 
at nearly $7 billion in 2010. Today, it has been pro-
jected that the mobile application market is pro-
jected to be a $101 billion dollar business by 2020. 
These impressive growth rates and market valua-
tions hold significant marketing opportunities for 
companies such as Apple, Android, Windows 
Mobile, and Blackberry that provide mobile appli-
cations (Perez, 2011; Takahashi, 2016).
</p>
<p>While the increasing number of mobile appli-
cations allows marketers to cater to specific cus-
tomer segments with targeted mobile applications, 
it also poses a challenge for marketers to con-
stantly update the applications, and in some cases 
replace them with more relevant offerings, to 
make the marketing efforts worthwhile. This con-
dition has ensured that companies are not only 
developing applications designed to provide util-
ity to their target market, but also creating niche 
applications for specific customer groups. For 
instance, Yelp has an application that allows con-
sumers to post reviews related to experiences or 
products they have purchased. Google offers an 
application called Google Hangouts which is a 
communication platform that allows consumers 
to engage in video calls and phone conversations 
for free. Uber has an application that allows peo-
ple to summon a ride digitally. Recently, Uber has 
expanded its reach by offering food delivery ser-
vices through UberEATS.
</p>
<p> Viral Videos
</p>
<p>Viral video views are expected to exceed 62% 
worldwide by 2017. There has been an annual 
double digit increase since 2013. The increase in 
number of viewers is partly due to the increase in 
internet speeds (eMarketer, 2017).
</p>
<p>Viral Videos have emerged as a user-driven 
method of communicating. The goal for market-
ers in approaching viral videos is to create some-
thing that they believe will be shared by the viewer 
with the rest of his or her network. Sites such as 
Youtube and Vimeo are a testament to the fast 
growing nature and high potential of this com-
munication outlet.
</p>
<p>Companies have started to shift money from 
TV advertising budgets to digital advertising. 
</p>
<p> Chapter 18 &middot; Future of&nbsp;CRM</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>391 18
</p>
<p>According to SMI, between 2014 and 2015, com-
panies transferred approximately $1 billion adver-
tising dollars from television advertisement to 
digital advertisement budgets (Alba, 2015).
</p>
<p>Many brands are using viral videos as a way 
of strengthening brand awareness and brand 
association. In 2016, Subaru, an automobile 
manufacturing company, created a video as a 
part of their &laquo;Subaru Loves Pets&raquo; campaign. The 
online video featured an adult dog driving its 
puppy around to lull it to sleep. The goal of the ad 
was to convince consumers that Subaru&rsquo;s are not 
just rigged terrain vehicles; they can also provide 
smooth, comfortable rides. Subaru of America&rsquo;s 
President, Thomas Doll, decided to change the 
company&rsquo;s marketing strategy from advertising 
technical aspects of the vehicle to appealing 
more to consumers&rsquo; emotions; hence the emer-
gence of the dog commercials. Doll&rsquo;s change in 
advertising strategy sparked an increase in 
Subaru sales with 2016 reports showing a 45% 
growth over the last 4&nbsp; years. The dog ads are 
attention grabbers, and consumers are able to 
relate to many of the topics that are portrayed 
(Lee, 2016).
</p>
<p> Social Coupons
</p>
<p>Social coupons, or online daily deal sites such as 
Groupon and LivingSocial, sky-rocketed at the 
start of its existence creating a new customer 
acquisition method for businesses and a new 
product/brand research portal for consumers. 
The success of the deal sites was undeniable&nbsp; &ndash; 
Groupon was valued at more than $16 billion at 
the close of its first day of trading which exceeded 
Best Buy and Whole Foods valuation at the time 
(Pepitone, 2011).
</p>
<p>Social Coupon sites such as Groupon thrived 
at the beginning because consumers were more 
conscious of their spending due to the recession, 
and were hungry for deals as a result. Companies, 
aware of consumers&rsquo; desire to save money, uti-
lized social coupon sites to aide in new customer 
acquisition. Consumers, looking for a way to save 
a penny, jumped on the deals. Soon after, compa-
nies started to realize that the customers utilizing 
the coupons provided short-lived business, and 
that the initial goal of the social coupon was not 
being achieved. As a result, companies started to 
shy away from offering deals on social coupon 
sites such as Groupon and LivingSocial. The 
</p>
<p>decline in company offered deals led Groupon to 
transition to a new strategy. Groupon recently 
announced its plans to shift to a new strategy that 
involves marketing local experiences versus 
&laquo;daily deals&raquo; (McArdle, 2016). Groupon&rsquo;s plat-
form is a very promising one in terms of its 
potential and the purpose of its existence, to offer 
coupons to consumers and increased brand 
awareness for businesses. The future of Groupon 
and LivingScial will rely on their ability to offer 
long term benefits for consumers and companies 
simultaneously.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, coupon sites such as 
RetailMeNot has found much success in today&rsquo;s 
world. This site allows consumers to find deals for 
restaurants, apparel, sports equipment, and much 
more. The coupons are offered in a digital format 
in which consumers are given &laquo;promo codes&raquo; to 
insert during checkout on a company&rsquo;s webpage. 
Users are able to search the website for any avail-
able coupons offered by businesses at the time. In 
addition, consumers are able to view the success 
rate of each coupon the expiration date while 
businesses are able to monitor the number of cus-
tomers the coupon generated. Essentially, this 
platform offers benefits for both consumers and 
businesses. Companies are able to acquire new 
customers and generate additional sales on cur-
rent customers who purchase decisions rely on 
available deals, and consumers are able to save 
money on items of interest. A study conducted in 
2014 by Forrester Consulting revealed 63% of 
consumers stated digital coupons gave them the 
motivation to make a purchase (RetailMeNot, 
2017).
</p>
<p>Although coupon clippings are still the most 
common method of couponing, the digital cou-
pon is growing at an exponential rate, with eMar-
keter estimating that there were 121.3 million 
digital coupon users in the US in 2015 and that 
number was expected to increase by 5.2% in 2016 
(eMarketer, 2016). The recent rise success of these 
deal sites can be attributed to the recession, which 
has prompted consumers to find maximum value 
for their dollar. Also, as consumers become sav-
vier and spend more time researching products 
online, they are exposed to these sites and promo-
tional offers. From corner restaurants to big cor-
porations, everyone is finding a way to use the 
social coupon craze to further their customer 
acquisition success rate.

<p>18.1.2  Consumer-to-Consumer 
Interaction: A&nbsp;New  
Marketing Portal
</p>
<p>With Social Media outlets garnering more traffic 
every day, consumer-to-consumer conversations 
concerning products and services are becoming a 
new marketing portal. Rather than engaging in 
direct B2C marketing strategies, firms are begin-
ning to insert themselves into conversations that 
are already happening between consumers. The 
conversations that firms used to have to start are 
already going on, at greater frequency and with 
more valuable information. The conversations on 
social media portals and forums provide consum-
ers the freedom and accessibility to view, discuss, 
and judge products and services. This setup has 
provided consumers the ability to formulate opin-
ions on products on their own terms, and influ-
ence their peers in their buying decisions.
</p>
<p>With the advent and subsequent proliferation 
of social technologies and tools, consumers are 
not only able to access information on the web, 
but also share information using a multitude of 
web technologies amongst their network of fellow 
users on any scale, and any frequency. This has 
enabled consumers to actively engage and partici-
pate in the development and marketing process of 
products and services. Additionally, the ability of 
consumers to access information on their own 
terms, evaluate products independently, and 
influence purchase decisions of other users has 
brought them a new level of autonomy and a sense 
of &laquo;ownership/control&raquo; over the products. In 
other words, we are gradually witnessing a change 
in the way companies used to know and under-
stand the purchasing habits and the elements of 
consumer behavior.
</p>
<p>The rate of diffusion pertaining to product 
-related web content has increased manifold. The 
constantly increasing volume, as well as the vast 
array of channels through which the information 
is processed and shared amongst consumer is 
proving to be difficult for companies to keep track 
of the content. Additionally, the concept of own-
ing customers, let alone products, is dissipating as 
consumer-based communities are taking charge. 
&laquo;The Power is with the Consumer,&raquo; says A.G 
Lafley, former Chief Executive at the Procter and 
Gamble Company. &laquo;Marketers and retailers are 
scrambling to keep up with her&raquo;. Consumers are 
</p>
<p>beginning in a very real sense to own our brands 
and participate in their creation. We need to learn 
to begin to let go. An example of handing over the 
brand to the customer can be found in the case of 
the Coca-Cola &laquo;Share a Coke&raquo; campaign where 
customers were able to customize their soda bot-
tles with their names or other trendy slogans. Due 
to this campaign, in 2014, Coca-Cola reported an 
increase in U.S. soda sales after 11 consecutive 
years of sale decline. Coca-Cola&rsquo;s choice to turn an 
aspect of their brand over to the consumer con-
firms that &laquo;letting go&raquo; of the brand and allowing 
consumers more input can in fact be rewarding for 
the company (D&rsquo;Orazio, 2014; Elliot, 2006).
</p>
<p>In light of the increasing popularity of these 
social media tools and their impact on B2C CRM, 
companies must adapt their CRM strategies as 
well as their philosophies of control over products 
and customers. The first step for companies in re-
assessing Social CRM strategies is to acknowledge 
that it may not be possible to have complete con-
trol on the web-based content related to them. 
Rather, companies must constantly participate in 
the online communities and adapt their offerings 
accordingly. According to Adam Sarner, a research 
director at Gartner, &laquo;This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you 
give them everything like they own it. If you aren&rsquo;t 
prepared that they&rsquo;ll take some of the control, 
then don&rsquo;t have the community. And if you can&rsquo;t 
handle harsh responses, you shouldn&rsquo;t ask ques-
tions in the first place. Don&rsquo;t ever, ever, ever ask if 
your product is good or bad if you aren&rsquo;t prepared 
to hear the answer and take the consequences of 
hearing &laquo;It sucks.&raquo;&raquo; The overall idea behind this 
philosophy is that to engage in Social CRM and be 
effective, companies must accept the changing 
realities of consumers (McKay, 2009).
</p>
<p> Listening as&nbsp;a&nbsp;First Step
</p>
<p>In establishing this new infrastructure for Social 
CRM, companies must establish a starting point. 
Given the high degree of consumer generated 
information, the most logical first step is a simple 
one: Listen. Being able to utilize information col-
lected on customers begins with listening, and 
through that, identifying the best strategies in 
addressing customer demands, concerns, and 
wants. With marketing and customer communi-
cations taking on a whole new perspective, the 
increasingly active role of the consumer is chang-
ing the nature of business altogether. Firms that 
</p>
<p> Chapter 18 &middot; Future of&nbsp;CRM</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>393 18
</p>
<p>do not recognize these market trends and success-
fully implement them into new CRM strategies 
must be prepared to face the consequences 
(Wright, 2006).
</p>
<p>Reports show that 96% of unhappy customers 
will not directly express their feelings to the com-
pany, but will express their negative feelings to at 
least 15 people they come in contact with. 
Customer satisfaction is paramount in today&rsquo;s 
world because of the growing presence of social 
media. News travel faster than they did in the age 
before internet. The fact that 76% of consumer 
purchases are based on internet reviews, reveals 
how much of an impact an unhappy customer can 
have on a brand (Beal, 2017). Consumers spread-
ing negative brand experiences is exacerbated by 
word-of-mouth embellishment, in which each 
time the story is retold the events and details 
become more exaggerated and incriminating for 
the store. As Paula Courtney, CEO of the Verde 
Group, explains, &laquo;As people tell the story the 
negativity is embellished and grows. For example, 
the first time the story is told, it might be about a 
customer service representative who was rude. By 
the time the third or fourth person hears the story, 
the customer service representative becomes ver-
bally abusive. To make a story worth telling, there 
has to be some entertainment value, a shock value. 
Storytelling hurts retailers and entertains con-
sumers&raquo; (Knowledge@Wharton, 2006).
</p>
<p>There are also companies that are engaging in 
proactive Social CRM strategies revolving 
around listening to customers. Radian6, a social 
media monitoring and engagement company, 
has received acclaim for its ability to listen to 
online conversations. Their Listening Stations, 
On-Site Training, lay down valuable frameworks 
for companies to process, analyze, and respond 
to customer conversations. Nielsen Online is 
another example of basing Social CRM strategies 
on listening; their BuzzMetrics have received 
overwhelming positive feedback regarding its 
Brand Monitoring, Brand Connections &amp; 
Customer Relations, and Brand Campaign 
Planning and Management (McKay, 2009). 
Companies such as Dell and WholeFoods are 
even integrating their own listening-interacting 
strategies on Social Media platforms, rather than 
achieving these solutions outside the company 
via consulting or outsourcing. In both of these 
examples, the companies opened Twitter 
accounts and established them as customer com-
</p>
<p>munication portals that provided superior ser-
vice, information, and value to the customer, as 
well as being a great way to integrate them into 
the peer-to-peer conversations and gather data 
on their target audience.
</p>
<p>JetBlue&rsquo;s implementation of a Twitter account 
for Customer Service has created a huge buzz in 
the airline community due to its innovative 
nature. JetBlue&rsquo;s Twitter account is accessible for 
any airport or airline related query, ranging from 
looking for a wheelchair for airport transporta-
tion to being able to reschedule and rebook 
flights. One particular experience involved a 
JetBlue passenger experiencing a weather-
induced flight cancellation. After numerous 
unsuccessful attempts with JetBlue&rsquo;s 800 number 
(largely due to the mass flight cancellations in 
response to inclement weather), the passenger 
decided to tweet his frustrations with JetBlue and 
the overall situation. What he received next came 
as a surprise, as JetBlue&rsquo;s Customer Service 
Twitter account asked if he could Direct Message 
them his confirmation number. After sending the 
number, this passenger received a courteous mes-
sage less than 15&nbsp; min later with a complete 
rebooking and a sincere apology. Due to severe 
weather, the passenger experienced cancellations 
several more times and every time he received 
quick, efficient, and personalized treatment from 
a Twitter based customer service representative. 
Here was the chronology of Twitter DM between 
the customer and JetBlue&rsquo;s Customer Service rep-
resentatives:
 1.  Customer Tweet: Complaint on his own 
</p>
<p>account
Reponse: Direct Message request for 
 Confirmation Number
</p>
<p> 2.  Customer DM to JetBlue thanking them
Response: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. Happy 
 Holidays!&nbsp;^kb&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 3.  Customer flight cancelled again, tweet to 
JetBlue
Response: &ldquo;Man, you have had a rough day! 
We&rsquo;re on it. ^kb&rdquo;
2nd Response: &ldquo;You just got the last seat on 
that flight! Confirmation has been emailed 
(again). Let us know if we can help in any

<p> 5. Additional, voluntary Customer Service:
&ldquo;Are you okay on the return flight? ^co&rdquo;
&ldquo;As a token of our appreciation for your patience 
during last week&rsquo;s snowstorm when we canceled 
your flight, please accept 10,000 TrueBlue points 
which you can apply toward future travel to any 
JetBlue destination.&rdquo; (Murillo, 2011).
</p>
<p>As it turns out, this customer is a well followed 
blogger and shared his story with countless fol-
lowers, who in turn, passed it on through their 
peer-to-peer network. From the JetBlue&rsquo;s response, 
it is easy to note the importance of customer man-
agement, and a key factor that impacted these 
processes: listening to customers.
</p>
<p> Mutual Purpose and&nbsp;Transparency
</p>
<p>A key issue today in the implementation of Social 
CRM is that most companies find it difficult to 
define their purpose for engaging in it, for them-
selves or for the customers. For successful utiliza-
tion of Social Media tools, it is essential to define 
(within certain parameters) the &laquo;mutual purpose&raquo; 
that states the incentives for both the customers 
and the company (Tsai, 2009).
</p>
<p>The entire model of interactive social media 
tools is based around voluntary interaction 
between different parties. In creating accounts on 
Twitter, Facebook, and other social platforms, there 
must be value adding activity for both the company 
and the customer, otherwise it serves no purpose. 
Given the high volume of web pages, applications, 
and users, just &laquo;being on&raquo; social networks will no 
longer be enough. Therefore, identifying this 
&laquo;mutual purpose&raquo; is essentially the activity of 
understanding why the company is actually going 
onto this social network, and how it will positively 
affect them and their customers alike.
</p>
<p>Frank Eliason, a former Comcast customer 
service expert, created a Twitter Customer 
Service Account to better serve Comcast custom-
ers. His Twitter Customer Service account 
encompassed the mindset that is required in suc-
cessful Social CRM implementation. Along with 
a team of 10 representatives, Eliason saw an 
opportunity for Social CRM that could better 
serve their target audience who were already 
</p>
<p>talking about them. People had been voicing 
their displeasure and issues that they had encoun-
tered as customers of Comcast, only they were 
doing so on vast online social platforms that were 
going unnoticed by Comcast. This untapped 
source provided Eliason with the idea of being 
able to directly address customer queries on a 
personal level, while also gathering valuable data 
on their customer groups.
</p>
<p>Eliason chose to focus on Twitter and the mil-
lions of searchable micro blogs in order to proac-
tively engage in customer conversations to help 
solve the issues being tweeted, blogged, and 
shared by millions of customers. By approaching 
customers in a proactive, candid, and positive 
manner (ignoring insults and dead end criticisms) 
Eliason became a personality among his followers 
and within the Twitter community. Soon, the 
media caught on to this innovative way of com-
municating with each individual customer, one 
based off of proactively reaching out to customers 
who were already talking about Comcast.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most intriguing and important 
facet of this strategy was encompassed by Eliason 
himself when he said, &laquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d become 
famous on three words: Can I help?&raquo; This embod-
ies how basic and how essential mutual purpose 
and listening are as a foundation for Social 
CRM.&nbsp;Eliason clearly defined that there was a gap 
in communication between Comcast and its cus-
tomer groups which was negatively impacting 
customer service. Rather than building a broad 
presence on Twitter, Eliason realized that the 
people who were complaining about various 
aspects of Comcast were already identifiable, and 
were in need for answers to their questions and 
concerns. The mutual purpose existed in custom-
ers&rsquo; need for answers, and Comcast&rsquo;s need to reach 
out to a large customer base and learn about them 
(Weier, 2009).
</p>
<p>Given the high volume of information avail-
able to customers, transparency and relevancy are 
becoming key drivers to the successful diffusion 
of information and the retention of customers. 
Customers are becoming less inclined to respond 
to marketing communication, advertisements, or 
any kind of information source that would appear 
to have vested interest as the driving force behind 
it. Users are ignoring these marketing vehicles 
more now because they are willing and able to 
gather information and discern the important 
from the not-so-important on their own.
</p>
<p> Chapter 18 &middot; Future of&nbsp;CRM</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>It is therefore important to stress authenticity, 
transparency, and relevancy in order to stay 
involved in the customer process of obtaining 
information. This trend is ushering in a new wave 
of marketing that is in sync with the consumer 
needs. Rather than performing a corporate pitch, 
companies need to engage in a closer, more mean-
ingful discussion with their customers. It is 
through the latter that companies will be able to 
gain the confidence of their customers, help iden-
tify the value of their customers, and serve their 
needs in a more targeted fashion.
</p>
<p>In this regard, it is important for companies to 
understand that customers now want and feel 
entitled to closely interact and engage with the 
brand, a trend that is growing at an exponential 
rate as the Millennials become the drivers of the 
market. Social media platforms should be used as 
access points for these discussions to take place, 
and then be funneled into a relevant activity for 
marketers. It is about putting a true and honest 
face to the brand, one that is candid and whose 
purpose is not to sell, but rather to inform. 
Numerous companies are engaging in this type of 
behavior, including H&amp;R Block, Ford, Southwest 
Airlines, Dell, Popeyes, DunkinDonuts, and 
Samsung. By participating in various forms of 
social engagement, these companies are putting a 
face to their brands. In the case of automaker 
Hyundai&rsquo;s &laquo;Think Tank&raquo;, that face was often that 
of a top executive. Hyundai launched this com-
munity that holds live chat sessions with some of 
the company&rsquo;s most important executives, includ-
ing the CEO.&nbsp;Having access to key decision mak-
ers within the organization gave customers a 
sense of importance, as well as establishing trans-
parency, truth value, and &laquo;not hiding&raquo; Hyundai&rsquo;s 
image.
</p>
<p>18.1.3  Social CRM Strategies:  
How to&nbsp;Do It?
</p>
<p> Social Strategies: Not Social Tools
</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the easiest mistakes to make 
when establishing a Social CRM strategy is to 
focus on the available tools rather than creating 
an adaptable social platform. Although there are 
some apparent mainstays within the Social 
Media industry (at least for now) such as 
Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, reality suggests 
</p>
<p>that social tools evolve and change constantly. 
Thus, establishing a sustainable Social CRM 
strategy based on existing specific tools is a rec-
ipe for being left behind. In essence, disposable 
applications are exactly that, but social comput-
ing and interaction are constantly flourishing 
and becoming more and more essential. The 
underlying concept and strategy is therefore 
more important than the short-term implemen-
tation (Lager, 2009).
</p>
<p> Implementation: Task-Specific
</p>
<p>Going from &laquo;We&rsquo;re on Facebook&raquo; to &laquo;We&rsquo;re on 
Facebook, in order to achieve _____________, 
which we will accomplish by _______________&raquo;, 
is a jump that many companies are yet to take. 
Questions such as &laquo;What problems are you trying 
to fix? How does this platform address these prob-
lems? How does this fit into your overall CRM 
strategy?&raquo; would evoke only general and vague 
responses from companies. As mentioned earlier, 
it is no longer good enough to just be a website, 
profile, or account on these Social Media plat-
forms. Companies such as Comcast and JetBlue 
are great examples of utilizing a social media tool 
because of a need or for a purpose, rather than 
just because &laquo;they probably should&raquo;.
</p>
<p>The issue that many companies are facing is 
that Social CRM, along with many of the social 
media channels within it, is in the infant stage of 
its life cycle. Further given that there are very 
few recognized and recommended approaches 
to implement Social CRM, companies usually 
take the lead of other companies because 
&laquo;everyone else is going social&raquo;. Although it may 
seem slightly hazardous and undefined, trial 
and error has proven to be a successful method 
for some companies to design and implement 
successful Social CRM strategies. As Justin 
Goldsborough, former social media manager 
for telecommunications provider of Sprint says, 
&laquo;I&rsquo;ve learned more by doing and trying things, 
and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve had more success at Sprint&raquo;. 
As noted by Anthony Lye, former Senior Vice 
President of Oracle CRM, companies can also 
adapt proven and successful Social CRM strate-
gies and technologies used other companies to 
match their existing goals (McKay, 2009). Being 
a fast follower of available strategies currently in 
usage can also be a great way of integrating a 
social CRM strategy into the overall company 
strategy.

</p>
<p>18.1.4  Sentiment Analysis
</p>
<p>One of the most talked about and interesting 
trends within Social CRM is the growth of analyt-
ics and text analysis. With an increasing number 
of consumers taking to consumers now willingly 
talking more than ever on public platforms, the 
World Wide Web is filled with all the information 
and data that companies have always wanted from 
their customers. Consumers want to be heard, 
and that is why social tools such as Twitter, 
Facebook, and other platforms in the blogosphere 
and social networking hold a unique value. 
Twitter, for example, enables companies to sort 
information shared by demography, topic of 
interest, or any other preferred criterion.
</p>
<p>Companies are now beginning to see the value 
of these sites and are constantly listening to what 
consumers have to share about their experiences 
with the products, services and brands. To cor-
rectly discern the meaning of the information 
shared by the consumers, companies are now 
turning towards sentiment analysis that helps 
them uncover the intended meaning behind con-
sumer opinions and reviews. Companies such as 
Best Buy, Viacom, Paramount Pictures, Cisco 
Systems, and Intuit are using sentiment analysis 
to improve CRM strategies and provide more tar-
geted offerings.
</p>
<p>In May of 2009, the ticket-selling agency 
StubHub used an innovative online sentiment 
monitoring technology developed by San 
Francisco based ScoutLabs. They ticket agency 
took this measure following a rain delay in a 
New&nbsp; York Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox game at 
Fenway Park. The rain delay seemingly coincided 
with a rise in negative sentiment, which upon fur-
ther review, arose from the company&rsquo;s inclement 
weather policy for refunds. The negative senti-
ment seemed to be a result of StubHub&rsquo;s refusal to 
provide fans with refunds on the basis that the 
game had already gone underway. However, after 
using ScoutLab&rsquo;s technology and seeing the nega-
tive impact it would have on their brand image, 
StubHub proceeded to offer discounts and credit 
awards to those fans in attendance. Furthermore, 
this entire saga has led to StubHub re-evaluating 
its refund policy in situations with bad weather. 
All of these improvements stemmed from the use 
of ScoutLab&rsquo;s sentiment analysis technology 
(Wright, 2009).
</p>
<p>One of the fastest growing technologies for 
automated sentiment analysis is text analytics. 
This tool collects text data on consumer insights 
not only from web platforms such as the social 
media, but also from news articles or information 
databases. The text analytics provides an objective 
summary of consumer reactions and responses to 
a particular company, product, or service. The 
market for text analytics is expected to more than 
double from $2.65 billion in 2015 to $5.93 billion 
in 2020, according to a MarketsandMarkets report 
(King, 2011; MarketsandMarkets, 2015).
</p>
<p>Other forms of text analytics solutions offered 
by companies such as Attensity, ClearForest, 
Content Analyst, SPSS, Inxight, and Lexalytics are 
being harnessed by different companies, with 
each solution providing a unique competitive 
advantage. For instance, Lexalytics recently 
launched a web-based application for media rela-
tions called MediaVantage which enables a firm to 
implement automated sentiment analysis of blogs, 
social media platforms, and any other user feed-
back over the web in multiple languages.
</p>
<p>Another fast growing technology is &laquo;Big data&raquo; 
and data analytics. The term &laquo;Big data&raquo; is used to 
describe the large amounts of data companies col-
lect on consumers which in turn can be used to 
predict consumer behavior and ultimately allow 
companies to make better business decisions (SAS, 
2017). The amount of data being collected every 
day is remarkable, and growing by the minute. &laquo;Big 
data&raquo; is being collected on a continual basis from 
sources such as loyalty cards, emails, social media, 
just to name a few (Villanova University, 2017). 
One such data source that has experienced much 
growth in the market is wearable technology.
</p>
<p>Wearable technology such as the Apple Watch 
and Samsung&rsquo;s Gear Fit has been a growing trend 
in recent years. The wearable technology market is 
projected to reach $8 billion dollars by 2018 
(Cognizant, 2016). This technology has the capa-
bility of collecting powerful data that will allow 
companies to learn consumer behavior, which 
would include information such as places they go, 
things they do, and their lifestyle. The retrieved 
data can be used in a variety of valuable ways. 
Companies such as Big Cloud Analytics are able to 
demonstrate the value of wearable devices by 
developing several applications for the data. For 
example, the data on health parameters for an 
individual can be monitored and a baseline can be 
</p>
<p> Chapter 18 &middot; Future of&nbsp;CRM</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>397 18
</p>
<p>created with a certain confidence interval. When 
the health parameter exceeds the confidence inter-
val for a few consecutive days, notifications can be 
sent to the wearable technology user to alert them 
to seek medical care. In addition to consumer 
health benefits, wearable technology can provide 
the &laquo;Big data&raquo; companies need to better predict 
future demand by analyzing current consumer 
behavior extracted from wearable technology.
</p>
<p>This rapidly growing market will allow com-
panies to gain deeper insights into consumer 
behavior than anything prior to its existence 
because it offers real time data on customer 
behavior. Once this market is tapped into success-
fully by companies, businesses will be able to offer 
customer service quickly, customer specific loy-
alty rewards, gain immediate feedback from con-
sumers, and the list goes on. Since this data will 
essentially be collected at the moment it happens, 
companies will need to dedicate fulltime staff in 
this area to better benefit from its rewards.
</p>
<p>&laquo;Big data&raquo; and data analytics are powerful tools 
that have changed and are continually changing 
today&rsquo;s market (Villanova University, 2017). The 
term &laquo;Big data&raquo; is fairly new, but the act of gather-
ing data on consumer habits has been around for 
some time now. Companies that are attempting to 
utilize this tool are finding it challenging to quan-
tify the value and returns. Although, companies 
are struggling with adopting the growing trend due 
to the overwhelming amounts of available data, 
2015 studies reported that 75% of companies have 
or plan to invest in this powerful tool by 2017. This 
number is up from 2012 reports that revealed only 
58% of companies had plans to do so (Gaitho, 
2015). These numbers show that companies recog-
nize the benefits, and want to take steps toward 
better marketing practices. As this industry grows, 
the marketing industry will be forever changed. 
The valuable insights gained from &laquo;Big data&raquo; and 
data analytics will allow companies do engage in 
better targeted marketing, improve customer 
retention, and utilize prediction models to better 
understand future customer demand.
</p>
<p>18.1.5  A Final Word on&nbsp;Social CRM
</p>
<p>For the consumers, social media has turned 
the&nbsp; web from a predominantly communication 
medium to a medium that encourages collabora-
</p>
<p>tion, creation and sharing of information on their 
own terms. Enabling consumers to express their 
feelings with regards to a company and their 
product or service is something that companies 
have been trying to facilitate for years. With this 
invaluable insight, companies can now leverage 
the analytical capabilities of social CRM to under-
stand and uncover the various facets of consumer 
decision making.
</p>
<p>From the above discussion it is clear that in 
this new digital age, the expansion and popularity 
of social media is not only increasing the engage-
ment level of consumers, but also reducing the 
communication gap between consumers and 
companies in the B2C, B2B, and C2C markets. 
These social interactions are becoming critical to 
business operations as formal marketing commu-
nication methods are slowly being reconsidered, 
and novel social media approaches are receiving 
constant attention.
</p>
<p>18.2  Global CRM (GCRM)
</p>
<p>Global CRM is defined as &laquo;The strategic applica-
tion of the processes and practices of CRM by 
firms operating in multiple countries, or by 
firms&nbsp; serving customers who span multiple 
 countries&raquo; (Kumar, Sunder, &amp; Ramaseshan, 2011; 
Ramaseshan, Bejou, Jain, Mason, &amp; Pancras, 
2006). This definition suggests that firm and cus-
tomer level differences impact a firm&rsquo;s cross-cul-
tural and cross-national success. At the firm level, 
these differences include integral components 
such as production, operations, product portfolio, 
and firm size. On a customer level, key measures 
such as customer expectations, drivers of satisfac-
tion, loyalty, and profitability all contribute to the 
degree of success a firm has in GCRM implemen-
tation. Additional recent perspectives on CRM 
systems suggest that the consumer-centric view 
could grow among companies as a result of good-
will (Endacott, 2004). This perspective has 
changed, however, with companies now identify-
ing CRM as a vehicle for profitability on a global 
scale.
</p>
<p>The basis of understanding GCRM begins 
with understanding the general trends of global-
ization. As innovative technologies continue to 
spawn, facilitating rapid and constant company-
consumer interaction across oceans and conti-
</p>
<p>18.2 &middot; Global CRM (GCRM)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>398
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>nents, the relationship elements between a 
company and its customers undergo changes. 
This is particularly true with regards to CRM, as 
globalization has stressed the importance of hav-
ing a defined and systematic GCRM strategy in 
order to adapt to dynamic and widespread cus-
tomer bases.
</p>
<p>18.2.1  Informational Technology 
Needs
</p>
<p>Global CRM as a concept is evolving at an acceler-
ated rate due to the introduction of new innova-
tive technologies. Software as a Service (SaaS) has 
particularly impacted GCRM models and has 
become a motor for growth and progress within 
the marketing field. The worldwide cloud services 
market is forecast to reach $204 billion in 2016, a 
16.5% increase from 2015 market of $175 billion, 
according to Gartner, Inc. The industry is poised 
for a strong growth through 2020, when the 
worldwide cloud services market is projected to 
reach $383.4 billion (Gartner, 2016b). Gartner 
also estimates that, over the course of the next 
5&nbsp;years, $1 trillion in IT spending will be affected 
by the cloud. Enterprises will spend $111 billion 
cumulatively on software as a service (SaaS), plat-
form as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a 
service (IaaS), combined and expected to increase 
to $216 billion in 2020 (Gartner, 2016a, 2017).
</p>
<p>Following the growth of GCRM, multina-
tional enterprises are beginning to implement and 
build SaaS models in order to integrate customer 
and company level data across various geographic 
regions. This phenomenon is accelerating the 
growth of smaller service firms such as 
7 Salesforce.com, and will continue to do so as 
SaaS requirements for companies become increas-
ingly diverse and specialized.
</p>
<p>The room for improvement in SaaS implemen-
tation, however, is fairly prominent. The global 
CRM practices are known to report lower costs in 
attracting and retaining customers, increasing 
employee productivity and call center efficiency, as 
well as creating more accurate sales forecasting for 
increased customer sales and satisfaction. As firms 
aim to establish an international presence through 
off-shoring business processes, foreign direct 
investment (FDI), and other expansion methods, 
global CRM practices can be implemented to facil-
itate the above mentioned processes.
</p>
<p>One company using a SaaS solution is the 
ambulance group, First Med. By choosing the 
cloud as there automated model, they were able to 
reduce turnaround time from the output to mail-
ing of statements in their billing system. This SaaS 
solution allows First Med to directly transfer 
information from its billing system to the SaaS 
platform. &laquo;We don&rsquo;t need another software,&raquo; said 
Matt Ellis, the company&rsquo;s accounts receivable 
manager. &laquo;We simply upload straight from our 
system and everything&rsquo;s right there.&raquo; All that is 
required is for the statements to be uploaded onto 
the SaaS platform, at which point First Med 
employees access them on a web interface. 
Additional advantages from the SaaS software 
include, tracking capabilities of the process as well 
as mail production at the SaaS facility (Berard, 
2010).
</p>
<p>18.2.2  Global Diffusion
</p>
<p> Regional and&nbsp;National Heterogeneity
</p>
<p>Although the growth of GCRM is often catego-
rized in the functional, industrial, and regional 
aspects, the regional aspect of GCRM has had the 
most success and holds great promise for the 
future. National and regional heterogeneity have 
become important players in determining the 
outcomes of CRM implementation. The constant 
advances in communications and technology 
have accentuated the blurring of national bound-
aries, thereby accelerating the global diffusion of 
CRM as well as allowing firms to operate within 
and outside of specific geographic regions. Owing 
to variations in worldwide growth trends, the 
type of business clients, and cultural environ-
ments, companies face a series of challenges on 
designing and implementing business and mar-
keting strategies. Global CRM systems and prac-
tices can help managers to understand and align 
with their partners and clients from all regions, 
thereby facilitating the process of making 
informed decisions and adapting appropriately to 
the economic, cultural, and political climates of 
each area of business.
</p>
<p> Applying It as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Firm
</p>
<p>Being able to implement a successful Global CRM 
system and strategy involves starting from the top 
and allowing for a trickledown effect to occur. 
Developing a uniform outlook on GCRM strat-

<p>399 18
</p>
<p>egy is essential to then being able to adapt it and 
implement it on a regional or national level. The 
difficulty in this process exists in being able to 
find a middle ground between the region/country 
-specific needs across the board and the global 
requirements of the strategy without losing sight 
of the customer-centric strategy of CRM practices.
</p>
<p>There is no completely uniform GCRM solu-
tion. Industry, customer type, region and other 
variables must all be accounted for as they change 
by country or region in order to maximize the 
effectiveness of the GCRM practice. An example 
of being successful in this practice is that of U.S 
electronics retailer Best Buy. The firm successfully 
adopted a customer centric model, beginning 
with a $50 million investment to obtain, process, 
and analyze customer-level data before eventually 
using this information to change the hierarchical 
structure of the company. By orienting the sales-
people towards the customer instead of towards 
the product, Best Buy was able to better serve its 
customers across the board and was able to 
streamline and funnel their marketing strategy 
directly to them. This example illustrates a defini-
tive need for firms to prioritize Global, and yet 
adaptable, CRM strategies in order to maintain a 
customer-centric outlook.
</p>
<p>As shown in the example of Best Buy, a GCRM 
program has a certain methodology and different 
requirements that must be fulfilled in order to 
have sustainable and effective implementation. 
Finding the balance between focusing on the local 
or global scale is often mismanaged, leading to 
disastrous results in particular regions or the 
eventual collapse of the global strategy due to 
unmanageable segmentation. Therefore, develop-
ing a CRM strategy at the highest level of manage-
ment, but leaving room for needed adaptability is 
crucial to the delivery of the program and prac-
tice. This ensures that local customers&rsquo; particular 
needs are met and accounted for, while also allevi-
ating the company from risking sever deviation 
from its global standards. Much like with Social 
CRM, engaging in any form of GCRM prior to 
strategizing for the long term. The big picture 
should show local CRM practices integrated into 
a globally managed one.
</p>
<p>Global CRM serves to build and maintain 
relationships with customers that span multiple 
countries and is an integral part of the overall 
global business strategy that aids in the paradigm 
shift from product centricity to customer centric-
</p>
<p>ity. Firms that have implemented GCRM can 
leverage their integrated database to segment 
regional and global market and target the most 
profitable segment(s) as well as individual cus-
tomers with the right product offer at the right 
time regardless of their geographical location, 
thereby fulfilling customer centric strategy. Global 
CRM also enables firms to have more effective 
data analytics and more accurate forecasts about 
global, regional, and individual market trends. 
New products or innovations do not usually dif-
fuse simultaneously (sprinkler strategy) through-
out several countries because of different 
economic, political, or cultural conditions; rather, 
they sequentially spread (waterfall strategy) from 
one country to another (Kalish, Mahajan, &amp; 
Muller, 1995). Thus, GCRM provides a firm with 
learning benefits as it applies the knowledge it 
gains from one country to another.
</p>
<p>18.3  Database CRM
</p>
<p>18.3.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>A database is a collection of information pertain-
ing to customer interactions with the company 
that can be subsequently used for various market-
ing activities. 7 Chapter 8 discussed, in detail, the 
various types, benefits, and uses of databases. 
Many businesses use these lists in order to better 
understand their customers whilst differentiating 
each individual customer based on these statistical 
findings. Using this information that they have on 
current customers, businesses can therefore target 
prospective customers and preemptively build 
profiles and cater to their individual wants and 
needs from the beginning. These CRM databases 
and consulting products provide companies with 
the ability to store and keep track of information 
on customers, their purchasing habits, and all of 
the nuances within their feedbacks and behaviors 
that have an impact on the buyer-seller relation-
ship. For many years, companies handled all of this 
information with a physical storage space contain-
ing the database(s), resulting in high costs and 
restrictions with regards to off-site accessibility to 
the system. As mentioned in the GCRM section, 
global practices are becoming more and more 
common (and necessary), resulting in the need for 
more cost-efficient digital platforms for using, 
accessing and constantly updating the databases.

<p>18.3.2  Cloud Computing
</p>
<p>The development of cloud computing has allowed 
for more accessible and customizable implemen-
tation of CRM practices. It offers large organiza-
tions the luxury of disseminating all applications, 
data, and products within the CRM strategy to the 
members within the organization who should 
require it. As the fastest growing method for data 
storing, cloud computing provides a unique 
advantage for CRM, in that the previous physical 
and organizational restrictions no longer exist. 
Providing businesses the opportunity to install, 
use, and share CRM related applications on a web 
platform allows for remote access and real time 
updating in order to keep up with the dynamic 
and evolving nature of databases.
</p>
<p>The adaptability and customization capabili-
ties of these applications have made for a more 
effective CRM tool for each individual employee. 
Employees are now able to access all of customer 
data and information on a point-and-click inter-
face, which adapts according to each employee&rsquo;s 
specific requirements or preferences. Another 
advantage of housing CRM data with the cloud is 
that there is no longer a need to allocate massive 
amounts of server capacity for hypothetical out-
comes as a preventative measure. Instead, cloud 
computing scales up and down as demand dic-
tates, eliminating the need for housing endless 
preparations for various outcomes. Through this 
automated and customizable platform, companies 
are able to cut out the manpower and additional 
costs that are associated with physical databases 
such as upfront investments in hardware, hous-
ing, and maintenance costs. Through this switch, 
companies are gaining ground in CRM data-pro-
cessing as a more cost-effective and flexible solu-
tion that houses the same security and 
confidentiality, all while maximizing users&rsquo; ability 
to access and share applications at will.
</p>
<p>Many large corporations such as Google, 
IBM, and Amazon have not only integrated 
cloud computing into their business infrastruc-
ture, but have also made it a cornerstone of their 
CRM strategy and its everyday functionality. 
IBM&rsquo;s launch of their Smart Cloud Services has 
paved the way for a new way of company think-
ing. &laquo;Rethink IT.&nbsp; Reinvent business&raquo; is an apt 
slogan for a company that is offering a wide range 
of innovative cloud- based solutions such as 
</p>
<p>SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, Cloud Security, Development, 
and Testing. Many of these services have the goal 
of creating capacities for their customers to pro-
cess business software within data hubs. 
Furthermore, IBM is projecting these cloud 
computing services to account for 5% of com-
pany revenues by 2015, a total of $7 billion 
(Ricadela &amp; Hoffmann, 2011). Google and IBM 
are also utilizing Cloud Computing, for various 
reasons such as improving maintenance times, 
streamlining processes, and improving employ-
ees&rsquo; productivity and performance by re-posi-
tioning their focus to the tasks rather than the 
software issues that need solving in order to 
accomplish that task.
</p>
<p>As one of the world&rsquo;s leading technology orga-
nizations for the past few decades, IBM&rsquo;s switch to 
cloud computing stemmed from issues that many 
organizations today are still facing. IBM was 
experiencing issues on all fronts&mdash;starting with 
having too many platforms hosting their various 
departments, to using applications that became 
incompatible with the introduction of new soft-
ware and systems (some applications upgraded 
while others remained stagnant). To address these 
issues, IBM turned to Siebel (a CRM Solution 
software provider) to create an integrated com-
pany-wide CRM solution platform that would 
provide a single source for customer and market-
place data.
</p>
<p>These cloud computing based CRM applica-
tions can be applied easily and are economical 
without any infrastructure or maintenance obsta-
cles. In today&rsquo;s age, business software must be 
readily adaptable for accessing and processing 
data in relation to market changes and increasing 
profits. Being able to familiarize employees 
quicker with the newest apps grants them the 
ability to focus more on the work itself: helping, 
understanding, and serving customers.
</p>
<p>The implementation of cloud computing has 
been growing at an exponential rate, with IDC 
research forecasting an increase in cloud-related 
expenditures by 2020 (for a total of $500 billion) 
(IDC, 2017). This industry, expected to surpass 
$200 billion by 2016, is growing across company 
boundaries, with midsize companies beginning to 
embrace these strategies in addition to the major 
multinational corporations already profiting from 
the cloud&rsquo;s CRM solutions (Gartner, 2016a; 
Modavi, 2010).

<p>18.3.3  Privacy Issues and&nbsp;Concerns
</p>
<p>The rise of cloud computing and database infor-
mation management has led to questions and con-
cerns from businesses and consumers alike 
regarding the privacy and security of the content. 
The accessibility of these web-based platforms is 
simultaneously the root cause of concern for issues 
such as identity theft and individual privacy. 
Recent years have proven the risks associated with 
online databases. Target experienced a data 
breach, which affected approximately 40 million 
people and costs the company $39 million to 
repair damages. During this breach, hackers were 
able to gain access to customer&rsquo;s personal informa-
tion and credit card information (Garcia, 2015). 
Blue Cross Blue Shield had a similar experience 
that affected roughly 78.8 million of its members 
(Herman, 2016). Costs associated with this breach 
is expected to be in the millions as well. The recent 
system compromises have left users are question-
ing the levels of regulation and privacy that go into 
the processes involved in collecting information 
on consumers and online transactions as they are 
becoming increasingly wary of these methods. 
Banks are issuing credit and debit cards with chip 
technology to lower the risks of future system 
</p>
<p>compromises. In addition, online companies are 
now placing &laquo;cookies&raquo; into users&rsquo; computers, 
enabling them to garner personal information on 
the user without their consent or awareness. The 
practice of placing files called &laquo;cookies&raquo; and Web 
bugs by online companies in the user&rsquo;s computer 
during a visit is quite common. The cookies 
acquire the information while the user is visiting a 
particular site and create a pathway for them to 
continue to systematically retrieve information on 
this user. Information such as purchase history, 
advertisement responses, and other online activity 
can all be gathered in these processes.
</p>
<p>Therefore, while several precautions are 
advised by privacy rights associations, the key to 
reduce the risk due to fraud lies in closely guard-
ing personal information such as Social Security 
number (SSN), financial information, and driver&rsquo;s 
license number among others pieces personally 
identifiable information for any fraudulent trans-
actions, and monitoring credit history regularly. 
At the same time, online marketers and research-
ers will have to reassure customers and partici-
pants that their personal information is secure by 
not only closely guarding the information, but 
also put in place recourses for consumers in the 
event of a data breach.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>Within all of the growing trends in CRM, there 
</p>
<p>is still a great deal of unchartered territory 
</p>
<p>that experts and companies are striving to 
</p>
<p>understand. Within the trends of social CRM, 
</p>
<p>GCRM, and cloud computing, there are intri-
</p>
<p>cacies and channels that have yet to be fully 
</p>
<p>tested and understood.
</p>
<p>Social networking is changing the way 
</p>
<p>people live, and its effect on the consumer 
</p>
<p>world has had a clear impact that is altering 
</p>
<p>the B2C world. However, the same cannot be 
</p>
<p>said for social media&rsquo;s impact on B2B, where the 
</p>
<p>new channels and methods of communication 
</p>
<p>between parties are barely causing a single 
</p>
<p>ripple within the larger network (Lager, 2009). 
</p>
<p>What this stems from is a hesitancy to move 
</p>
<p>away from sound and tested strategies in favor 
</p>
<p>of the unknown. Because B2B transactions tend 
</p>
<p>to have larger implications than individual B2C 
</p>
<p>relationships, the risk is higher for failure. That 
</p>
<p>does not indicate that social media and social 
</p>
<p>CRM cannot penetrate the infrastructure of B2B 
</p>
<p>networks. There are already subtle examples 
</p>
<p>of these tools having their use within B2B 
</p>
<p>transactions. The BlackBerry Pearl, for example, 
</p>
<p>is a social tool that is directly marketed to 
</p>
<p>professionals with the purpose of facilitating 
</p>
<p>communication processes in their business 
</p>
<p>environment. Although this is on an individual 
</p>
<p>scale, and one could treat these individuals as 
</p>
<p>consumers, the reason for which these people 
</p>
<p>are using this product is to gain from the com-
</p>
<p>petitive advantages it provides in the business 
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, CRM is undergoing significant 
</p>
<p>changes. With recent developments in speed, 
</p>
<p>reliability, and spread of information channels 
</p>
<p>such as social media have made the concept of 
</p>
<p>CRM fascinating for academicians and practi-
</p>
<p>tioners. It has grown tremendously from a pre-
</p>
<p>dominantly database concept operating at the

<p> International Perspectives: Did 
You&nbsp;Know?
</p>
<p>1. AirAsia, a Malaysian low cost airline, was one 
</p>
<p>of the first airlines that embraced social media. 
</p>
<p>Today they manage different Facebook pages 
</p>
<p>for different locations worldwide, frequently 
</p>
<p>engage consumers with fun promotions, 
</p>
<p>develop various branding campaigns based 
</p>
<p>on user-generated content, and respond 
</p>
<p>promptly to customer inquiries. Doing so they 
</p>
<p>won several awards for their outstanding social 
</p>
<p>media presence and profit from a huge number 
</p>
<p>of followers and likes on the different social 
</p>
<p>media networks (AirAsia, 2015; Helmrich, 2014; 
</p>
<p>Mutum, Roy, &amp; Kipnis, 2014).
</p>
<p>2. T-Mobile US, collects enormous quantities of 
</p>
<p>data from its customers and uses this data to 
</p>
<p>prevent customer turnover. In fact, by using the 
</p>
<p>customers&rsquo; usage patterns, trends, purchases 
</p>
<p>by location, and profitability the company 
</p>
<p>managed to reduce churn by 50%. T-Mobile 
</p>
<p>also uses big data to identify its most influen-
</p>
<p>tial customers on the different social media 
</p>
<p>networks and offers them discounts to influ-
</p>
<p>ence the telecomm choices of other customers
