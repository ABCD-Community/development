<p>&ldquo;Once again, Mary Kao has createda comprehensive tool for the
training of students and library staff.
Readers with little or no experience
working in libraries will find the clarity
of format and content easily absorbed
and used. This text is a timely new re-
source for library technicians every-
where.&rdquo;

<p>&ldquo;This is a good and useful train-ing tool for technical service
technicians. It covers computers,
technical services, bibliographic utili-
ties and networks, acquisition, cata-
loging and classification, and govern-
ment documents, as well as serials
and preservation. Within each chap-
ter, Dr. Kao details the different func-
tions and proposes how to master
them with consideration of the inter-
national standard rules and regula-
tions. She also presents the library
trends and issues of the future in the
last chapter of the book. I highly rec-
ommend this book to instructors and
library technicians in the Technical
Services Departments of libraries.&rdquo;

<p>&ldquo;Bravo for Mary Kao! She puts thecomputer stuff right up front!
Recognizing that computers are deeply
integrated into the technical services
functions of today&rsquo;s libraries, Dr. Kao
wastes no time in introducing automa-
tion to her readers. Computers are not
a footnote here. Computer applications
and considerations appear in every
chapter, reinforcing the vital role they
play in helping library staff to carry out
traditional technical services duties.
</p>
<p>But do not let me slip by Dr. Kao&rsquo;s
introductory chapter without comment.
Before getting down to details, she
places the position of technician and
the department of technical services
within the context of the library organi-
zation. New students of library tech-
nology will readily understand their
changing and expanding roles in library
</p>
<p>service. They will clearly grasp the rela-
tionship between technical services
and public services, and how automa-
tion has blurred some of the distinc-
tions between traditional library de-
partments. Dr. Kao provides excellent
definitions of library terminology near
the beginning of each chapter, helping
readers to comprehend the settings in
which those terms will be used. Well
organized and thorough in its treat-
ment of all technical services func-
tions, this book will be welcomed by
instructors and students of library
technology.&rdquo;

<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Budgetary constraints and the computerization of library func-
tions and routines have changed the composition of library person-
nel forever. Library technicians are being hired to replace librari-
ans in many library areas, particularly in technical services. The
education and training of library technicians has not kept up with
this trend, which leaves a necessary component of a successfully
operating library lacking.
</p>
<p>Library technology programs have been established to help ful-
fill this need. However, not only are not enough programs in place
in the United States to educate and train library technicians, but
also, in the more than forty-four programs that exist today, faculty
has a difficult time finding suitable textbooks for the appropriate
courses. Most texts in the field of library science have been written
for graduate students in a master&rsquo;s in library science program with
an emphasis on history, theory, and management. In library tech-
nology programs, the faculty must resort to researching a variety
of related or unrelated reference materials and then composing a
course that caters to the needs of library technicians, with an em-
phasis on the practical, technical, and electronic aspects of library
tasks.
</p>
<p>It is with this scenario in mind that I started to assemble books
intended for library technicians. This book is designed as a text for
the introduction to technical services course in the two-year li-
brary technology associate degree or one-year certificate program.
The text also will serve as a general reference for library techni-
cians working in the technical services area or interested individu-
als who would like to learn about what goes on behind the scenes
in the library world.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>I would like to acknowledge the assistance of my friend Joanne
Fontanella. Without her editing skills and encouragement, the task
could not have been done so smoothly. I am very grateful to her
and thank her for her patience.

</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>librarian: The library worker who has a master&rsquo;s degree in library
science (MLS) is called a librarian. The librarian represents the
upper-level portion of the library personnel hierarchy, usually with
a title such as director, assistant director, department head, refer-
ence librarian, cataloger, serial librarian, system librarian, etc.
</p>
<p>library technician: In the middle level of the library personnel hi-
erarchy, the library technician may work in any area of the library,
especially in the technical services area, which includes acquisi-
tions, cataloging, and other responsibilities. Library technicians
usually report to librarians and may work alone or may supervise
library clerks. The recommended educational level for library
technicians is a two-year college associate degree or a certificate
in the field. The library technician is also called the library techni-
cal assistant, library assistant, paraprofessional, library aide, li-
brary associate, library support staff, and library/media technical
assistant.
</p>
<p>public services: Library work that involves direct interaction with
the public, serving the library user directly, is called public ser-
vices. Functions such as circulation, information, reference, and
sometimes interlibrary loan are generally included in the public
services area.
</p>
<p>technical services: Library work that is done behind the scenes and
that does not have much contact with the public is called technical
services. Functions such as acquisitions, cataloging, classification,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>physical processing, mending and repairs, gifts and exchanges,
preservation, organization of government documents, and serials
control are usually tasks handled by the technical services staff.
</p>
<p>LIBRARY ORGANIZATION
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not all libraries are organized in the same
way. Traditionally, however, libraries divide library functions into
two main categories, public services and technical services. The
public services area deals with tasks that are performed directly in
contact with the public and is represented by personnel at the in-
formation desk helping library users or at the reference desk as-
sisting users with in-depth reference questions or research prob-
lems. Because these are the only members of the library staff that
library users actually see and meet, to many users, they are the li-
brarians or the total library staff. In fact, there is the other part of
the library staff, usually more than half in number, who work be-
hind the scenes preparing the library and its collection so that the
library is ready to serve the public. The work done in the offices
and areas behind the scenes is called technical services, and the
people who work there are referred to as technical services staff.
Figure 1.1 illustrates how a library usually is organized.
</p>
<p>LIBRARY TECHNICAL SERVICES
</p>
<p>Most library users are not aware that the collection in a library
must be acquired, organized, and prepared before materials can be
found on the shelves. Not only must this work be done before any-
</p>
<p>Library
</p>
<p>Technical Services Public Services
</p>
<p>FIGURE 1.1. The Library Organization</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>one can use the library and before the public services staff can an-
swer the myriad inquires, but also technical services&rsquo; responsibili-
ties are a continuing process that goes on day after day. Technical
services&rsquo; activities are accomplished with little interaction with the
library users and are performed with the focus on library materials
rather than direct, face-to-face involvement with library users.
</p>
<p>What library functions and responsibilities are included in the
technical services department? Although libraries may have their
own distinct ways of dividing library functions and responsibili-
ties, generally speaking the area of technical services includes all
the activities related to preparing and making materials accessible
to library users. Such works encompass ordering, claiming, and
receipt of materials; cataloging and classification; serials control;
processing materials; binding, repairs, and preservation of materi-
als; gifts and exchanges; government documents; and database
and catalog management (see Figure 1.2). All these functions will
be discussed in detail in the following chapters.
</p>
<p>In automated libraries, the line may be blurred between techni-
cal services and public services because the same databases are
maintained and used by both departments. For example, more and
more libraries consider circulation or access management part of
technical services. In this text, only traditional components are
discussed, where circulation and interlibrary loan functions, be-
yond the scope of this book, remain a part of public services.

<p>LIBRARY PERSONNEL
</p>
<p>Historically, library personnel are divided into two categories:
professional and supportive. Throughout the years, as library work
has become more complicated and required skills have become
more sophisticated, the library personnel hierarchy has modified
the job description for personnel at all levels within these two cate-
gories.
</p>
<p>The only official guidelines for classification of library staff
come from the American Library Association in a document titled
Library Education and Personnel Utilization, published in 1976
by the American Library Association in Chicago. In this state-
ment, categories of library personnel and their qualifications are
defined, requiring that the librarian have a master&rsquo;s degree in li-
brary science, the library associate have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, and
the library technical assistant have two years of college level
study. At this time, the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;two years of
college level study&rdquo; tends to mean an associate degree or a one-
year certificate. Clerks are also included in the supportive cate-
gory, but they are not required to have college training. Figure 1.3
shows the library personnel hierarchy as defined by the American
Library Association.
</p>
<p>LIBRARY TECHNICIANS
</p>
<p>Although no universal title exists for this category of library
staff, in this text a library technician is defined as a library staff
member who does not have a master&rsquo;s degree in library science,
and who performs library functions that require library-specific
skills . About 70 percent of all library workers in the United States
are library technicians, also referred to as library technical assis-
tants, paraprofessionals, library assistants, support staff, para-
librarians, and library aides. Presently, no qualifying education
level exists. However, as more library technicians acquire a col-
lege education, it is only a matter of time before the American Li-
brary Association will decide on a standard, most likely in the
form of a two-year associate degree or a one-year certificate.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Over the years, because of budgetary restraints and the rapid de-
velopment of automation, library technicians have assumed in-
creasingly responsible and complex assignments. Many library
tasks formerly performed by librarians have become the responsi-
bility of library technicians. Recently, the issue has not been so
much a shortage of librarians or the lack of an adequate budget but
rather the concern of the library administration is to better utilize
the knowledge and skills of librarians and library technicians to
provide a more efficient and wider range of library services. This
objective has contributed to more interesting and fulfilling career
possibilities for those who choose to work in the library world.
</p>
<p>With the increase in demands and the expansion of responsibili-
ties, in addition to in-house training, formal education and training
have become more important for library technicians. Learning on
the job is not sufficient because with automation and new systems
being introduced, tasks need to be revised and updated continual.
With specific courses, on the other hand, one not only learns the

<p>subject matter and acquires general knowledge but also develops
the ability to make good decisions and sound judgments in everyday
situations. Community colleges all over the United States, Canada,
and Australia are responding to the problem by establishing library
technology programs for the sole purpose of educating and training
competent library technicians. Currently, in the United States, there
are forty-four such programs offered in twenty-one states, with
some programs offering distance learning courses through the Inter-
net. These programs cannot meet the demand for the vast number of
library technicians needed, leaving many libraries with technicians
who do not have a formal degree or certificate and for whom train-
ing must be acquired in workshops, at seminars, through on-the-job
training, and at conferences. As an increasing knowledge of tech-
nology becomes essential, a higher level of skills and understanding
is necessary. Many professionals in the field have suggested that
some kind of certification for library technicians be established as
an educational standard, so that the claims that library technicians
are professional workers can be justified.
</p>
<p>Library technicians are actively involved in professional library
activities. From the names chosen for the organizations, it is clear
that these are professional groups with high professional interests.
Notice that titles for library technicians are far from uniform. In
Alabama, the Paraprofessional Round Table is part of the Ala-
bama Library Association. In California, the group called Support
Staff is a regular part of the California Library Association. In Col-
orado, the organization is called the Paralibrarian Division. A sur-
vey was done in Fall 1998 showing that Library Technical Assis-
tant is their preferred term. The full report titled &ldquo;A Study of
Library Assistant Positions in Connecticut Libraries&rdquo; is available
on the Connecticut State Library home page at &lt;www.cslib.org&gt;.
In Minnesota, the organization is called Support Staff and Para-
professional Interest Section. According to a nationwide survey
conducted by the Library Journal in 1995, the largest number of
respondents&rsquo; title was listed as library assistant, followed by li-
brary technical assistant. The American Library Association calls
its newly established interest group for library technicians Support
Staff Interests Round Table, yet in its document published by the
Committee on Library Education Task Force for Review of the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>American Library Association, Criteria for Programs to Prepare
Library/Media Technical Assistants, the name library/media tech-
nical assistant is used. The Encyclopedia of Careers and Voca-
tional Guidance (2000) and the Occupational Outlook Handbook
(U.S. Department of Labor, 2000-2001) both use the term library
technician. The ALA Web page &lt;http://www.ala.org/ssirt/&gt; pro-
vides more information on this topic.
</p>
<p>The Council on Library/Media Technicians (COLT) is the na-
tional organization for library technicians. Besides providing in-
formation, it serves as an advocate for the status of library techni-
cians, sponsors conferences and meetings, promotes the education
of library technicians, and is involved in activities of concern to li-
brary technicians. The COLT Web site is located at &lt;http://library.
ucr.edu/COLT/&gt;. There is a Library Support Staff Resource Cen-
ter home page &lt;http://www.library.ucv.edu/COLT/&gt; that offers a
variety of information related to library technicians. Also, many li-
brary technicians are actively involved in discussions on various
issues in a library support staff listserv called LIBSUP-L. To sub-
scribe, e-mail may be sent to &lt;listproc@u.washington.edu&gt;. There
is also a Web site that includes information on listservs in all areas
of library work and instructions on how to subscribe; the URL is
&lt;www.itcompany.com&gt;.
</p>
<p>Two professional journals are published solely for library tech-
nicians. One is a bimonthly publication titled Library Mosiacs.
The other is called Associates: The Electronic Library Support
Staff Journal, which is only available in electronic format. Its ad-
dress is &lt;www.ukans.edu/nassoc/&gt;. To subscribe, send e-mail to
&lt;listproc@ukans.edu&gt;.
</p>
<p>Many issues are of great concern to library technicians and are
under discussion currently, including the certification issue, inade-
quate education and training programs, lack of continuing educa-
tion opportunities for professional growth, low salary, and the ab-
sence of a career ladder for promotion.
</p>
<p>Library technicians have come a long way from the time they
were first recognized and accepted thirty years ago. The March 15,
2000, issue of the Library Journal featured its first annual para-
professional of the year award honoring a worthy candidate, giv-
ing a significant boost to the status of library technicians. Al-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>though obstacles still remain to overcome, the skills, enthusiasm,
and professionalism of these individuals have become an essential
part of the library operation, and their contribution to the library
community is substantial.
</p>
<p>LIBRARY TECHNICIANS IN TECHNICAL SERVICES
</p>
<p>Technical services is one area of the library that extensively utilizes
the skills and experience of library technicians. Acquisitions, for ex-
ample, involves tasks that are usually performed by library techni-
cians and clerks. Library technicians receive requests from selectors,
obtain items and publication information, create order forms, send or-
ders to vendors or publishers, receive materials, check in materials,
and forward invoices to the accounting department for payment.
Also, library technicians supervise clerks and assist in communicat-
ing with the collection development staff, book vendors, and publish-
ers. In the electronic environment in which libraries subscribe to bib-
liographic utilities, copy cataloging is done universally by library
technicians. Although some libraries continue to have librarians
perform original cataloging, library technicians may be assigned to
perform original cataloging, as well. In many libraries, the responsi-
bility of the maintenance of databases is assumed by library tech-
nicians, and the physical processing of materials is done by library
technicians or clerical workers under a library technician&rsquo;s super-
vision. These duties include ownership stamping, attaching spine
labels, inserting security strips, attaching &ldquo;date due&rdquo; slips, and what-
ever may be needed to get the materials ready to be shelved. Other
areas such as book repair, preservation, and gifts and exchanges also
engage the skills and resources of library technicians.

<p>Computers in Technical Services
</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>application program: The computer software that constitutes a
specific program. Each program has a particular purpose, such as a
computer game to be played for leisure, a word processing pro-
gram, spreadsheet operation, database management, computer
graphics, or electronic mail and communications.
</p>
<p>automation: System and working procedures that employ com-
puters rather than people to do required tasks. Some initiation de-
vice or instruction is assigned and the work proceeds automati-
cally to its conclusion.
</p>
<p>integrated system: A library automation system that includes a
circulation module, a cataloging module, an acquisitions module,
and a serials module. All functions share a single database. It is a
more economic and efficient way to operate an automated library,
as compared to a single-function system that addresses only one
function&mdash;acquisitions, for example.
</p>
<p>operating system: Computer software used to coordinate the
computer hardware with the program and to make it work. The
system stores and retrieves data and keeps track of storage space.
</p>
<p>turnkey system: A package for library automation that includes
hardware, software, maintenance of hardware and software, gen-
eral system support, initial installation, staff training, subsequent
software upgrades, general advice, and troubleshooting methods,
all provided by the same vendor.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>COMPUTERS
</p>
<p>Thanks to developments that made computers smaller, cheaper,
and easier to use, the automated library has become common-
place. The emergence of microcomputers and CD-ROM technolo-
gies have greatly enhanced computer applications in all library
functions. Although it is not necessary to understand program-
ming or other technical information to be able to operate library
computer applications, some basic, general knowledge about com-
puters helps to appreciate fully the extensive role of technology.
</p>
<p>In the computer revolution, the Internet has emerged as the most
important entity not only for information transfer but also as a
business tool. This also applies to library system operations, mak-
ing it possible for libraries to have a Web-based online public ac-
cess catalog.
</p>
<p>Types of Computers
</p>
<p>All computers, whatever the size, operate by the same logic.
The difference is that size dictates memory storage capacity and
speed of processing. Depending on size, there are five types of
computers.
</p>
<p>Supercomputers are the largest and the most powerful comput-
ers. They are used by government agencies and large research or-
ganizations that need instant results for the computation and
analyzation of huge amounts of data.
</p>
<p>Mainframe computers are powerful and have the capacity to
process mass information quickly. They are used for number
crunching in large-scale computational problems and for archiv-
ing large amounts of data, which cannot be handled by smaller
computers. Big systems such as the Online Computer Library
Center (OCLC) depend on such computers.
</p>
<p>Minicomputers are multiuser computer systems on a smaller
scale than mainframes. The medium-sized central processing units
(CPUs) in minicomputers can process data from many libraries si-
multaneously and quickly. Many terminals can be connected to the
minicomputer&rsquo;s central processing unit, which eliminates the need
for individual CPUs for each terminal. Most library automation
systems run on minicomputers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Microcomputers are the most commonly found computers in of-
fices and homes. Microcomputers are called desktop computers
because they can be used easily on regular desks, unlike the mini-
computers or mainframe computers that occupy more space and
need special treatment, such as temperature control. The two kinds
of microcomputers that are available on the market now are personal
computers (PCs) and Macintosh. Both are capable of performing
functions as complex as running an automated system for small li-
braries. In recent years, microcomputers have been augmented by
new technologies and developed into what are called workstations.
For example, the cataloger&rsquo;s workstation will consist of the micro-
computer with the database software and files installed, plus all
the online reference tools that are constantly needed for catalog-
ing, such as the Library of Congress Classification Schedules, Li-
brary of Congress Subject Headings, and Anglo-American Cata-
loguing Rules, Second Edition, 1998 Revision.
</p>
<p>Laptops are very small microcomputers that weigh only a few
pounds. They use a rechargeable battery that makes it convenient
for users to carry for business use or pleasure. Storage capacity of
laptops is as large as that of microcomputers.
</p>
<p>Computer Components
</p>
<p>Computers have two parts: the hardware and the software.
Hardware is the machinery, usually referred to as the equipment.
Software refers to the programs that include the operating systems
and the application programs. Both computer hardware and soft-
ware needs change often and need to be updated regularly.
</p>
<p>Hardware
</p>
<p>Following is a description of all the components of hardware
that together make applications work.
</p>
<p>The central processing unit, usually referred to as the CPU, is
the brain of the computer that holds commands and technical pro-
cessing information. The central processing unit contains a hard
disk drive that allows storage of data entered by the user or that
was entered through library activities. Information can also be
copied or saved onto floppy disks. Another storage medium in the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CPU is the CD-ROM, which has the capacity of storing an enor-
mous amount of information on one disc. The stored instructions
in the CPU make it possible for the computer to handle characters,
graphics, and send information to the printer. For important data
storage, a backup is necessary, containing duplicate information to
prevent the loss of data in case of power failure or computer break-
down. The capacity and speed of the computer are governed by the
CPU&rsquo;s internal architecture, called bytes.
</p>
<p>The keyboard has letters and numbers similar to a typewriter
keyboard plus a set of function keys which allows the computer to
perform special functions according to the software being used.
This is where you input the information you want the computer to
process. The keyboard is connected to the CPU by a special cable.
</p>
<p>The monitor is also called a display screen or terminal. It looks
like a television screen and is where the information is displayed.
Monitors tilt so that they can be adjusted to make it more comfort-
able for users. Special cables are used to connect the monitor to the
CPU.
</p>
<p>A printer is the standard hard-copy output device. The printer
must be compatible with the program and configured to the CPU.
</p>
<p>In order to connect with other computers, a computer needs a
modem. A modem connects the telephone, the computer, and
a telecommunications program so that one computer can commu-
nicate with another, and, therefore, one can search databases no
matter where they are located. The modem usually is built in, but
external modems are available that can be connected to the com-
puter system.
</p>
<p>Software
</p>
<p>Software is defined as programs that enable a computer system
to perform specific tasks. Software is written with instructions in
machine language to make the hardware work and to allow the
system to carry out complex tasks.
</p>
<p>Two different kinds of software are needed to operate a com-
puter: an operating system and an application program. The avail-
able operating systems are Windows, Windows NT, DOS, UNIX,
NetWare, and Linux. This is the software that makes it possible to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>keep the operation active, to communicate with the CPU. A good
operating system is user-friendly. The application program con-
tains instructions informing the CPU what to do. Thousands of ap-
plication programs are available. The basic application programs
are word processing, such as WordPerfect or Word; spreadsheet
operations such as Excel; data management such as Access; and
programs with graphic capacities such as PowerPoint or Print
Shop.

<p>LIBRARY AUTOMATION
</p>
<p>Technology has shifted the patron&rsquo;s expectations, changing the
library&rsquo;s role from a collection of materials to an information pro-
vider and mediator.
</p>
<p>Computers are used in libraries to perform clerical duties; to
produce a wide variety of products, such as bibliographic lists and
all sorts of statistical reports, including catalog records; and to
help in many activities, such as circulation. Furthermore, comput-
ers are used to promote the sharing of catalog records worldwide,
saving time and effort for countless libraries.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>An obvious feature of an automated library is an online catalog
in which all of the library&rsquo;s collection is stored in a database and
available on a computer. Library users can not only find materials
in the library by searching the author, title, or subject (similar to
the card catalog search), but also may use many new features as
they are made available in the automated environment. This in-
cludes more searching strategies, such as keyword and Boolean
searching, linking of other databases to offer more materials and
information, and linking the online database to automated circula-
tion, cataloging, and acquisitions systems. Furthermore, the on-
line catalog has the capacity of providing full text indexing. Elec-
tronic books and journals can also display in full text on the online
catalog.
</p>
<p>In general, libraries approach the automation issue in two ways:
using the turnkey system or the single-function system. The turn-
key system is a complete system composed of all library functions
using the same database. Typically, it includes a circulation mod-
ule, a cataloging module, an acquisitions module, and a serials
module. The library purchases from the vendor not only the sys-
tem but a package that includes hardware, installation, staff train-
ing, subsequent software upgrades, troubleshooting help, and sys-
tem consultation. On the other hand, smaller libraries&mdash;most
likely school libraries&mdash;may purchase a single-functon system to
meet their needs. Some examples of single-function systems on
the market now include Super Circulation Control with Carder,
On-Line Catalog with Carder, Periodical Manager, and Item In-
ventory and Tracking.
</p>
<p>A few years ago, only libraries with a substantial budget could
afford to automate their library operations. Recently, thanks to
federal and state technology grants and private donations, such as
those from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, tens of thou-
sands of even the smallest libraries are automated.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUTOMATION AND TECHNICAL SERVICES
</p>
<p>Although all library functions have been affected by the use of
computers, the technical services area has changed most.
</p>
<p>Traditional card preparation has become database management.
Catalogers who previously spent hours doing original cataloging
or searching in bibliographic listings such as The National Union
Catalog published regularly by Library of Congress now find such
cataloging information online in the OCLC, RLIN, and UTLAS
databases. In a majority of cases, cataloging has become a quick
process in which a record is downloaded for local use without
much alteration. If the library is a part of a consortium, its holding
symbol is attached to the record, which is already in the database,
and the cataloging task is done. This development has prompted
the current situation: cataloging costs have been reduced, catalog-
ing staff has switched from librarians to library technicians, and,
because one record is utilized by thousands of libraries, uniformity
has resulted as strict standards are adhered to. All clerical func-
tions are eliminated. The need for knowledgeable manipulation
and maintenance of these databases has significantly increased the
visibility of technical services, as the cataloging done behind
the scenes becomes instantly accessible in the public catalog to
thousands of library users.
</p>
<p>For acquisitions, once the information on titles is keyed in or
downloaded from another database, it is sent electronically to ven-
dors. The same data stays in the database with an additional note
indicating that the material is on order, the date it was ordered, and
any other important details. When the item is received, the status
of the item in the database is indicated by a word change, from &ldquo;on
order&rdquo; to &ldquo;in process,&rdquo; and any other necessary description. The
same file is used over and over with little additional input from
staff. All the files that contain duplicated information in the man-
ual system are eliminated. The same bibliographic record is used
in cataloging. Automation has changed the acquisitions function
from being repetitive and tedious to being a quick, efficient pro-
cess.
</p>
<p>The goal of automation in technical services is to increase pro-
ductivity, to eliminate duplicated effort in organizing materials, to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>increase the efficiency of operation, and, eventually, to enhance li-
brary services. In an automated technical services operation, pro-
ductivity will be increased. With the same number of staff, more
tasks can be accomplished, and they can be done better. The main-
tenance of the catalog is a good example. With the card catalog,
cards need to be printed, alphabetized, and filed in the catalog. For
withdrawn materials, all cards need to be removed from the card
catalog, one by one&mdash;again, a labor-intensive job. Along with the
mechanics of updating and correcting a card system are the con-
stantly changing and modifying of cataloging rules. Automation
solves these problems completely. The information must be input
once, then the computer takes care of the tedious jobs of indexing
and filing, saving staff time to work on more meaningful tasks. In
an automated catalog, human mistakes are exposed instantly, al-
lowing correction measures to be taken quickly, resulting in a
more accurate database and enabling the library to maintain a
more efficient and effective technical services organization.
</p>
<p>Because of the collective use of the integrated automation sys-
tem, libraries are able to share resources. For example, original
cataloging, which used to be the emphasis of a library technical
services operation, has been almost eliminated. Most library mate-
rials are now copy cataloged, meaning that the cataloging needs to
be done only once, usually by the Library of Congress or other
large university or research library. All other libraries can take the
information and attach a local record to it, saving hundreds of li-
braries not only staff time for redundant work but also staff exper-
tise.
</p>
<p>The computer revolution has had an overwhelming impact on
libraries. Automation has become a fact of life in the library tech-
nical services area. Most libraries now use computers for at least
part of the technical services operation, be it accessing national or
regional databases for cataloging, linking directly to vendors for
acquisitions, or using the complete integrated automation system,
all of which facilitate the work in both technical services and the
public services areas.</p>

<p>Chapter 3
</p>
<p>Bibliographic Utilities
and Networks
</p>
<p>Cooperation and resource sharing always have been a library
tradition. That tradition has continued as automation has taken its
prominent place on the scene. The recently introduced terms li-
brary consortia, integrated systems, international networks, shared
databases, Internet, and World Wide Web all reflect the interaction
and cooperative effort that the development of automation has fos-
tered within the library community.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress has played a leadership role in the his-
tory of library automation. Since the 1960s, the Library of Con-
gress has produced and distributed MARC tapes to the library
world. MARC stands for machine readable cataloging, and MARC
tapes contain bibliographic records of all the cataloged titles in the
Library of Congress. Each record contains the complete biblio-
graphic information of the title, cataloged with standard catalog-
ing tools. Today, most bibliographic utilities, commercial vendors,
and library consortia subscribe to and use MARC tapes as the
foundation for their own databases. Information for the same titles
can be copied, and items that are not found on the MARC tapes are
cataloged by sites, using the same standards (called MARC for-
mat) established by the Library of Congress and the library com-
munities. MARC tapes represent a giant step forward in shared
cataloging. Understanding the structure and the importance of the
MARC format is essential for library technicians working in any
area in the library. More will be discussed about the MARC format
in Chapter 5 of this text.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>authority records: In an automated system, in order to be consis-
tent with names and subject terms, an established list is used as a
standard of accepted values. New information to be entered must
be validated against this list; this function is called authority con-
trol. The records on the list of accepted values are called authority
records.
</p>
<p>bibliographic utility: An organization composed of many mem-
ber libraries that provides large online databases of bibliographic
records which member libraries can use for copy cataloging and
other purposes. Participating libraries can use the records and can
also contribute to the database by creating new records.
</p>
<p>MARC format: Machine readable cataloging information done
according to a fixed format. For each element in the bibliographic
record, the MARC format specifies a tag number, two indicators,
and the field and subfields. For example, for author, the tag num-
ber is 100, the first indicator is 1, the second indicator is a blank,
and in the field is the author&rsquo;s last name, comma, and then the au-
thor&rsquo;s first name. The birth date of the author is placed in the
subfield.
</p>
<p>MARC tapes: Machine readable computer tapes with biblio-
graphic information produced by the Library of Congress, com-
posed of all the acquisitions of the Library of Congress. Libraries,
vendors, and library consortia subscribe to the tapes as a base for
performing copy cataloging. The tapes constitute the catalog of
the Library of Congress and therefore are used for identifying its
collection.
</p>
<p>network: Computers connected together to facilitate communica-
tion and resource sharing. Networks make it possible for computer
users to access information that is not stored into the local data-
base. The term is also used to represent a group of libraries orga-
nized together using or forming a bibliographic utility.
</p>
<p>retrospective conversion: When a library becomes automated,
the existing collection that is indexed in the card catalog must be</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>converted into machine readable form (the MARC format) and
stored in a database that will become the online catalog. The titles
are entered into the database one by one. This process of building
the library database is called retrospective conversion or retrocon for
short. It is an expensive and time-consuming process. Some librar-
ies try to do the task in-house, while others outsource the job to
vendors.
</p>
<p>server: The computers that store the needed information for a net-
work are called servers. The server may be the size of a desktop
microcomputer or may be as large as a mainframe computer. The
other end of the server is the client&mdash;the user&rsquo;s computer that asks
the server to provide information.
</p>
<p>World Wide Web: An Internet facility that links documents from
anywhere in the world. The Web document, called a Web page, is
linked to other Web pages so that users can jump from one page to
another whether it is local or from a remote site. The Web provides
a point-and-click interface to access the collection of all online in-
formation, and can be accessed via an Internet browser such as
Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer. The Web is also a multi-
media showcase that allows video, audio, and videoconferencing
over the Net.
</p>
<p>Z39.50: A protocol designed for search and retrieval from infor-
mation systems in a network environment. Use of this protocol in
integrated library systems allows different systems to interchange
information. It enables the local system to connect to and retrieve
data from a remote site by using local menus. For example, with
Z39.50 software installed, a library&rsquo;s catalog can be accessed by
any users anywhere in the world, even though different automation
systems are used.
</p>
<p>BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES AND NETWORKS
</p>
<p>Bibliographic utilities are agencies that are composed of many
libraries with the purpose of sharing a combined online database.
Member libraries can retrieve cataloging information from the da-
tabase and can create new records for the database for the use of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>other libraries. Bibliographic utilities have thrived because of the
assistance they provide in cataloging. Besides offering cataloging
information, bibliographic utilities encourage member libraries to
share resources and sometimes offer cataloging or other services
to members. Bibliographic utilities play a very important role in li-
brary automation processes. Almost every library is influenced by
bibliographic utilities either as a participant or as an indirect asso-
ciate through special arrangement.
</p>
<p>The three most prominent bibliographic utilities are the OCLC,
the RLG, and the UTLAS.
</p>
<p>OCLC (Online Computer Library Center)
</p>
<p>OCLC, the oldest and the largest of bibliographic utilities, is a
nonprofit organization serving over 39,000 libraries in seventy-six
countries. It is by far the busiest bibliographic utility in the world.
OCLC&rsquo;s bibliographic database is built from a combination of the
MARC tapes from the Library of Congress and contributions from
the member libraries. More than 46 million items have been cata-
loged on the OCLC database with a new record being added every
15 seconds. It is estimated that over 90 percent of library acquisi-
tions can be found in the OCLC database. As the necessity of orig-
inal cataloging diminishes, the trend of using library technicians in
the cataloging department increases. The location, verification,
and acceptance of cataloging copy have become the library techni-
cian&rsquo;s area of responsibility.
</p>
<p>Besides being a shared database to facilitate cataloging, OCLC
has much to offer the technical services area. Bibliographic Re-
cord Notification delivers upgraded OCLC-MARC records to the
subscription libraries, including records with table of contents
data. RetroCon is a customized retrospective conversion service
for libraries of all sizes and budgets. TechPro offers off-site cata-
loging and processing services to libraries. PromptCat provides
fast copy cataloging for libraries by working on titles with a direct
connection to vendors who supply materials to the libraries. New
services are added from time to time. More specialized services
provided by OCLC include the AsiaLink, a collection-develop-
ment service that selects and acquires books in Chinese, Japanese,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Korean, and Vietnamese. For more information on OCLC and its
services, visit its Web site at &lt;www.oclc.org/&gt;.
</p>
<p>RLG (Research Libraries Group)
</p>
<p>RLG is a nonprofit membership corporation of universities, ar-
chives, historical societies, national libraries, and other institu-
tions. Its database, called RLIN, contains millions of items suit-
able for research collections. Unlike OCLC, which attempts to
meet the varied needs of many types of libraries, RLG is designed
to meet the needs of large research libraries only. Membership in-
cludes 164 institutions worldwide. Services offered by RLG in-
clude information delivery, record supply, interlibrary loan, cata-
loging, and archival processing, etc. For more information about
the RLG, check its Web site &lt;www.rlg.org/&gt;.
</p>
<p>The Internet
</p>
<p>The Internet is a large network made up of more than 100,000
smaller commercial, academic, and government networks in over
100 countries. It is referred to as a worldwide information high-
way, providing information on every conceivable subject.
</p>
<p>The Internet has become widely used only in the past few years,
but, already being &ldquo;online&rdquo; has become essential to everyday busi-
ness functions. Being online means being electronically connected
to other computers and using the World Wide Web (WWW), a pro-
tocol of Internet operation. The WWW is used for retrieving infor-
mation from local databases or from bibliographic utilities. It can
also be integrated with the Z39.50 server and client and search
multiple databases simultaneously for information for cataloging
or acquisitions.
</p>
<p>Web-based technology has caused a sharp decline in demand
for closed, proprietary software. Ease of use and especially the
convenience of online access to electronic information and data
have influenced library automation vendors to develop more Web-
based point-and-click systems, replacing the old menu-driven sys-
tems.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>NETWORKS AND LIBRARY COOPERATION
</p>
<p>With the proliferation of library automation and with library us-
ers having more sophisticated computer skills, no single library is
well enough equipped to accommodate its own users. Cooperation
among libraries has become more important and has encouraged
the significant growth of consortia, which assist libraries in joint
purchasing, interlibrary loan, database sharing for cataloging, and
the use of the same automation system.
</p>
<p>International and national: The previously described OCLC,
RLG, and UTLAS are networks of international nature and mem-
bership.
</p>
<p>Regional: OCLC has eighteen regional network affiliates that
service different regions in the United States. Examples include
NELINET, serving over 500 libraries in the six New England
states, and AMIGOS, serving the Southern states.
</p>
<p>State and local: The development and the popularity of the
Internet and resource sharing in libraries have resulted in more
consortia being formed within states and locally. Melvyl, a com-
bined catalog in California, serves all University of California
campuses. Ohiolink involves seventy-nine higher education insti-
tutions in Ohio, sharing the same automation system. Then there
are local consortia, such as LION, a network of twenty-two public
and academic libraries throughout southeastern Connecticut shar-
ing the same database, and Greater Cincinnati Library Consor-
tium, a consortium of forty-nine academic, public, school, and
special libraries.
</p>
<p>INTEGRATED AUTOMATION SYSTEMS
</p>
<p>Integrated library systems encompass a variety of library opera-
tions. By sharing the same database, one computer system can
serve several modules for applications in cataloging, acquisition,
serials control, circulation, and the online public access catalog.
One input or update keeps the entire database current for all func-
tions. The system also allows the online public access catalog to
link to the commercially available online reference services such
as abstracting, indexing, and full-text reference databases.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Many commercial vendors design and sell integrated library
systems to libraries. The majority of vendors offer a complete
packaged system&mdash;turnkey system&mdash;which supplies hardware, soft-
ware, installation, training, and continuing support. Once the sys-
tem has been purchased and installed, libraries can start using its
functions immediately. Some vendors include epixtech inc., CARL,
DRA, Geac, Innovative Interfaces, Sirsi Corporation, Winnebago,
and many other smaller ones. Most of these systems have similar
functions and are organized by modules. Libraries may purchase
the circulation module, cataloging module, acquisitions module,
and serials module all together or separately. They are mostly
Web-based systems that harness the power of the Internet using
programming languages such as HTML, XML, and Java, provid-
ing libraries with tools for effortless management of library func-
tions. Systems also use graphical user interfaces (GUI). Accord-
ing to a survey by Library Journal in 2000 and published at
&lt;www.libraryjournal.com/automated-marketplace&gt;, estimated li-
brary systems revenues for 2000 were $440 million. To learn more
and to get up-to-date information about the individual system,
consult the yearly April 1 issue of Library Journal, which reports
on an annual survey titled &ldquo;Automation System Marketplace.&rdquo; In
the future, more libraries will outsource systems support and ser-
vices to an application service provider (ASP) who will maintain
servers and software for different customers at a centralized loca-
tion.
</p>
<p>DATABASES
</p>
<p>In addition to the system software, databases, provided by data-
base companies and vendors, contain information and data, such
as periodical indexes, abstracts, or full text, or they focus on spe-
cial subject fields, such as the Chemical Abstracts Service. Se-
lecting the appropriate databases for the individual library is an
important undertaking and is usually the job of the reference de-
partment.</p>

<p>Chapter 4
</p>
<p>Acquisitions
</p>
<p>The acquisitions unit is an important branch of the technical ser-
vices department. It is the first and the most fundamental process
within the library work flow. Although libraries may be organized
differently, acquisitions is almost always included in the technical
services department, and the tasks involved in acquisitions are per-
formed primarily by library technicians.
</p>
<p>Acquisitions encompasses a variety of tasks. Generally speak-
ing, included are bibliographic searching and verification, order-
ing, claiming, and receipt of materials. Some libraries may add
more tasks to the acquisitions unit, such as collection development
and copy cataloging; some libraries may not even have a separate
unit called acquisitions. In all cases, libraries needs to acquire ma-
terials, and the processes involved in acquiring materials remain
more or less the same. In this chapter, procedures and tasks related
to acquisitions are discussed and explained.
</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>acquisitions: The processes and systems of ordering and receiv-
ing library materials.
</p>
<p>approval plan: An agreement between a library and a vendor that
allows the vendor to ship a range of titles in a particular subject
area designated by the library to the library. Library staff then ex-
amines the shipped titles and decides what to keep and what to
return to the vendor.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>bibliographic information: Information needed to properly iden-
tify an item. Such information includes author, title, publisher,
publication date, and International Standard Book Number (ISBN).
</p>
<p>bibliographic verification: The process of verifying that the bib-
liographic information is complete and correct.
</p>
<p>blanket order: An agreement between a publisher and a library in
which the publisher sends all titles published in a certain subject
area to the library. The library may not return any title.
</p>
<p>collection development: Sometimes this is referred to as collection
management; it involves decision making about the collection. A
policy on the goals and objectives for the collection is first written,
then every task in the department, such as selection of titles, dis-
carding titles, and evaluation of the collection, is done in relation
to that policy.
</p>
<p>ISBN: An International Standard Book Number is a unique ten-
digit number assigned to each book that is published. It looks like
this: 1-56024-344-9. The first digit reflects the country of publica-
tion. The next few digits denote the publisher and a number the
publisher has assigned to each book, and the last digit is a check
digit. The number for each book is unique and is used to identify a
particular title.
</p>
<p>ISSN: Numbers that the publisher has assigned to serials, called
the International Standard Serials Number. Similar to the ISBN,
the ISSN is a unique number used to identify a particular serial title.
</p>
<p>preorder search: Before an item is ordered, it is checked against
some identified reference sources to make sure that the library
does not already own the item, and that the bibliographic informa-
tion is complete and correct.
</p>
<p>standing order: The library places an order of a particular title
with a publisher or a vendor with the understanding that subse-
quent volumes or issues will automatically be sent to the library.
Serials orders are all standing orders. Many reference materials
usually have a standing order as well.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>vendor: A wholesaler from whom the library materials are pur-
chased. It is synonymous with a book dealer, a jobber, or, in the
case of journal subscription, a subscription agent.
</p>
<p>weeding: A term that means removing materials from the collec-
tion that are out of date, inaccurate, in poor physical condition, or
rarely circulated. Weeding is sometimes referred to as collection
appraisal.
</p>
<p>TYPES OF MATERIALS ACQUIRED
</p>
<p>Materials that a library may acquire include but are not limited
to printed books, serials, pamphlets, audiovisual materials, elec-
tronic formats of books and journals, and computer databases.
With all the talk about the &ldquo;virtual library&rdquo; and the &ldquo;virtual collec-
tion,&rdquo; libraries will continue, at least in the foreseeable future, to
acquire sizable collections in print form. At the same time, the
need to acquire more materials in electronic format is increasing.
</p>
<p>Books
</p>
<p>Books are still the largest part of a collection in most libraries
and usually are ordered through vendors or directly through pub-
lishers. Books in Print is the best source for ensuring that a book is
still available. More and more libraries are using online book-
stores such as amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com for quick and
inexpensive service.
</p>
<p>Pamphlets
</p>
<p>The pamphlet file, also called vertical or information file, is an
important segment of the library collection. Materials in the pam-
phlet file include pamphlets, documents, clippings, maps, photo-
copies, newsletters, annual reports, flyers, pictures, posters, and
other information relevant to the library&rsquo;s collection, which may
serve the needs of library users. These publications are usually un-
der 100 pages long and, therefore, too flimsy to be cataloged and
put on the shelf or too ephemeral to warrant full cataloging. Pam-
phlet titles can be acquired at no cost or inexpensively from fed-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>eral, state, and local governments, from chambers of commerce,
from tourist bureaus, from foreign embassies, and many other or-
ganizations.
</p>
<p>Microforms
</p>
<p>Microforms are available directly from the publisher or from a
commercial company specialized in producing microform materi-
als, such as the University Microfilms International Division of Bell
&amp; Howell Information and Learning, where thousands of journal
titles are available both on microfilm and on microfiche. Journals
in CD-ROM format can also be purchased there as the recent trend
in the popularity of libraries buying CD-ROMs instead of micro-
forms continues.
</p>
<p>Audiovisual Materials
</p>
<p>Audiovisual materials are still very popular with library pa-
trons, especially in public libraries. The sources for finding films,
videos, and other types of audiovisual materials are printed or on-
line reference lists and also individual producers&rsquo;catalogs, such as
Directory of Publishers and Vendors, Best Video, Audio Books&rsquo;
Dealers and Publishers, Educational Video Resources, Filmakers
Library, Annenberg/CPB Projects, Creative Educational Video
Multimedia, Audio Books on Compact Disc, Inc., and many others.
A Web site that contains such lists is &lt;http://acqweb.library.
vanderbilt.edu/&gt;.
</p>
<p>Electronic Materials
</p>
<p>Acquisitions staff may be required to handle materials in elec-
tronic formats such as CD-ROM, e-books (electronic books), and
online subscriptions. Both single titles and continuous database
services belong in this category. Libraries must provide computer
equipment that is compatible with such materials; an extreme ex-
ample is the netLibrary in Colorado that provides electronic full-
text access to over 34,000 scholarly, reference, and professional
texts. Purchasing electronic databases involves a licensing agree-
ment that provides libraries with limited access to the databases.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>To keep up with new developments in electronic media, one may
read book review journals such as the Library Journal, which also
reviews other types of media, including electronic materials. The
library may gain access, but not ownership, to electronic informa-
tion from remote sites for free or for a fee. Many libraries choose
consortium-based licensing, which is the most cost-effective way
to provide access to the library users. The Library of Congress pro-
vides many free databases on its Web site &lt;http://lcweb.loc.gov/&gt;.
</p>
<p>Out-of-Print Materials
</p>
<p>For out-of-print materials that the vendor cannot supply, acqui-
sitions staff must contact the publisher first for available copies or
may have to enlist the services of out-of-print dealers who can
search for the needed titles for the library. An example is Alibris, a
company that specializes in finding hard-to-find and out-of-print
books. With an Internet connection, information on millions of
books can be located from its Web site &lt;http://library.alibris.com&gt;.
</p>
<p>COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT
</p>
<p>Collection development, where decisions are made on what is
to be purchased for the library, has a close relationship to acquisi-
tions function but usually is not considered a part of the acquisitions
unit. Many libraries have a separate and independent collection
development department or section; sometimes it is a part of refer-
ence services.
</p>
<p>Besides its own personnel selecting individual items for the li-
brary, some services are offered by publishers and vendors that fa-
cilitate the work of the collection development area. Such special
programs include the approval plan, the blanket-order plan, and
the standing-order plan, all of which are explained in this chapter
under the Acquisitions Procedures section.
</p>
<p>Weeding, or collection appraisal, performed on a regular basis,
is another task that is usually done by the office responsible for
collection development. Out-of-date materials should be discarded
in order not to mislead readers with the wrong information and to
make room for new materials. The Weeder&rsquo;s Digest is a reference</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>that lists titles that may be weeded out safely. Its Web site is
&lt;www.cyberdc.com/librarydynamics&gt;.
</p>
<p>PUBLISHERS, PRODUCERS, AND VENDORS
</p>
<p>Because materials can be ordered directly from publishers and
producers or from a vendor, library technicians working in acqui-
sitions must have some knowledge of available publishers and
vendors in order to choose the best materials and to pay the most
reasonable prices for them.
</p>
<p>With all the talk about the electronic information revolution and
a paperless society, individuals and libraries alike continue to buy
books in quantity, suggesting that library technicians working in
acquisitions need to have adequate knowledge about publishers.
</p>
<p>Vendors are also called jobbers or dealers. These commercial
companies are formed with the intention of selling books and
other materials to libraries and providing several types of services
that relate to acquisitions and processing. Libraries order materials
through vendors rather than publishers because vendors offer more
competitive prices. Vendors also offer customized services, such
as cataloging and processing of the acquired materials, so that
once received, items can be shelved immediately. Other special
services, such as out-of-print searching and foreign-materials or-
dering, are available as well. With the appropriate interfaces, the
library&rsquo;s acquisitions module can be linked to the vendors&rsquo; data-
bases that contain the bibliographic information for verifying indi-
vidual titles and, consequently, allow orders to be placed electroni-
cally and effortlessly.
</p>
<p>The criteria considered for selecting a vendor include the speed
of delivery, competitive pricing and discounting, and the flexibil-
ity and variety of its customer services.
</p>
<p>ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES
</p>
<p>The process of acquiring materials is the same whether ordering
a book, a piece of audiovisual medium, a piece of virtual informa-
tion in a remote database, or a disposable piece that is to be used</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>for only a short time. The request is first collected, the biblio-
graphic information is then verified, and, finally, the material is
placed on order.
</p>
<p>Order Requests
</p>
<p>Collection of order requests is the first step of the acquisitions
procedure. In academic libraries, order requests come primarily
from faculty or from librarians in the collection development unit.
In public libraries, order requests may come from library users and
the collection development unit staff.
</p>
<p>Bibliographic Verification
</p>
<p>The second step in acquiring materials for the library is to do the
preorder search, which is also called bibliographic verification. In
this process, the library technician needs to search the library&rsquo;s
own catalog to make certain that the library does not already own
the material. Standard references also need to be searched so that
the titles to be ordered have the correct information, including au-
thor&rsquo;s name and spelling, title, publisher or producer, edition,
price, and International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or Inter-
national Standard Serial Number (ISSN).
</p>
<p>The standard bibliographies to be checked include Books in
Print, Books Out-of-Print, national bibliographies such as the Na-
tional Union Catalog, publishers&rsquo; catalogs and flyers, and the data-
bases of bibliographic utilities such as OCLC and RLIN. De-
pending on the library&rsquo;s automation status, Books in Print can be
found in print format, on CD-ROM, or as an online subscription
via SilverPlatter, OCLC, and Ovid Online. In addition to the nec-
essary bibliographic information, Books in Print establishes that
the material is indeed still in print. After all the titles are verified, a
purchase request is prepared.
</p>
<p>Ordering
</p>
<p>With the prepared purchase request, an order is placed in one of
two ways: by the direct use of different publishers or by the use of
the service of a vendor. Vendors are used under normal circum-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>stances because they usually give a bigger discount, provide more
personal services, and provide extra services such as cataloging
and processing. Under certain circumstances, direct orders must
be placed with publishers. This happens when materials are avail-
able only through direct order, when a rush order is needed, or when
the library holds membership in an organization, and, therefore,
can acquire materials with special discounts. In communication
with publishers, a library uses its Standard Address Number (SAN)
to avoid confusion. Like the ISBN and the ISSN, a SAN is as-
signed to each library by R. R. Bowker, the designated agency. The
SAN for each library is listed in the American Library Directory.
</p>
<p>Orders can be placed in a variety of ways. Traditionally, the pur-
chase requests are typed on forms. Most vendors and publishers
also accept telephone orders. For automated libraries using the ac-
quisition module, titles may be ordered electronically. The auto-
mated acquisitions system works most efficiently because the bib-
liographic information is entered once, and the same data is used
for ordering, copy cataloging, and record keeping, thus eliminat-
ing the many cumbersome files that normally must be kept in the
acquisitions office.
</p>
<p>Another way to place an order is through the &ldquo;approval plan.&rdquo;
When contracting for an approval plan, the library first is profiled
by the vendor, then the vendor will automatically deliver new titles
matching the library&rsquo;s interests. After the books are received, the
library can make purchase decisions with the books in hand.
Inappropriate materials are returned to the vendor.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;blanket order plan&rdquo; is yet another way of ordering. In this
plan, orders are placed with the publisher for all published titles of
a certain area of interest. Titles may not be returned. In such a plan,
paperwork is kept to a minimum, and the library knows what to ex-
pect and, in addition, receives a large discount.
</p>
<p>For continuous publications, libraries usually participate in a
&ldquo;standing order plan.&rdquo; When a new volume of the same title is pub-
lished, the publisher or the vendor will send the volume to the li-
brary automatically, thus saving staff time by eliminating the or-
dering procedures. The advantage is that the item will be received
soon after publication and with a substantial discount.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Some vendors offer lease services. Public libraries may use this
service to receive multiple copies of best sellers to meet immediate
need. When interest has waned, the surplus of books is returned.
The leasing cost is far less than the cost of buying multiple copies
of books whose popularity is temporary.
</p>
<p>In 1995, OCLC started a PromptSelect service to streamline the
acquisitions process in libraries. PromptSelect provides libraries
with access to the OCLC Online Union Catalog and R. R. Bowker&rsquo;s
Books in Print, allowing acquisitions staff to export the ordering
information from the PromptSelect database to the local ordering
system. The order process is completed effectively by making the
preorder search and order preparation an easy one-step task.
</p>
<p>In 1999, OCLC started another service called AsiaLink. This is
a preselected collection of fiction and nonfiction books written in
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. All books are avail-
able with full cataloging and processing if the library chooses.
Programs such as these work especially well with libraries that do
not have language specialists but have specific users to serve.
</p>
<p>More and more vendors are offering a Web-based book order-
ing service, which has become the most efficient way to acquire
materials. In such a system, a vast bibliographic database is avail-
able from which the library can select and order, and books can be
shipped quickly. Brodart&rsquo;s Book Express Plus has claimed that li-
braries can receive fully cataloged, shelf-ready books two days af-
ter the initial order. Ingram Book Group and Baker &amp; Taylor re-
cently have announced similar services.
</p>
<p>Receiving
</p>
<p>Receiving begins with unpacking the shipment. The received
items are then checked against the packing slips to make sure that
the correct titles have been sent. If any discrepancy is discovered,
problems must be solved by communicating with the vendor. In-
voices are then approved for payment, and items are checked in
and forwarded to the cataloging department for cataloging.
</p>
<p>Bookkeeping
</p>
<p>For purchasing materials, funds usually are assigned in catego-
ries. For example, a certain dollar amount for fiction, a certain dol-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>lar amount for nonfiction, a certain dollar amount for children&rsquo;s
materials. In the case of academic libraries, division of funds by
academic department or by courses being offered would be appro-
priate, with an additional allocation for reference materials. An-
other allocation format might consist of designated amounts for
printed materials, for audiovisual materials, for computer data-
bases, etc. No matter how the funds are provided and used, immac-
ulate bookkeeping is essential.
</p>
<p>Files and Records
</p>
<p>In a library that uses a manual acquisitions system, many files
must be maintained. They include: the order request file, the stand-
ing-order file, the on-order/in-process file, the correspondence
file, the approval plan file, the desiderata file, the claim file, the
packing slip file, the invoice file, and the cancellation file. Also,
bibliographic information of all kinds is kept in the office for refer-
ence purposes. The various files are explained further below.
</p>
<p>Requests for orders from different sources such as faculty or the
collection development librarian are gathered and an order request
file is formed. Titles in this file are verified to avoid duplicate or-
ders and for getting the complete bibliographic information. After
verification, orders are sent to the publisher or the vendor; that is the
on-order file. When titles are received, a new in-process file is
formed so that an accurate record of the status of every item exists.
When the processing is done, and the item is shelved, and the card
catalog or the online catalog is updated with the new item added,
the full cycle of acquisitions if finished.
</p>
<p>Combined or separate files are kept for titles on standing order
to avoid duplicate orders, and titles on blanket order are separated
from items kept on the approval plan. Records of communications
with the vendor are kept in the correspondence file. Claiming is
necessary when the library has not received the material as or-
dered, which demands another file. Libraries usually set a time
limit, such as six months or one year, for the back-ordered materi-
als to arrive. If within the agreed-upon time limit the order is not
filled, a cancellation notice is sent. Cancellation of orders can also
be necessary because of accidentally duplicated orders, because of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>budget problems, or because wrong bibliographic information
was sent to the vendor. This record is called the cancellation file.
Billing records and records of all financial matters are kept in a
billing records file.
</p>
<p>An automated acquisitions system basically has the same struc-
ture as the manual system; it may be a stand-alone acquisitions
system or a part of an integrated library system. Either way, the au-
tomated system uses the same bibliographic record, and changes
of status are recorded, such as the date it was ordered, the date it
was received, the date it was cataloged, as well as any other neces-
sary information. Of course, all paper files are eliminated, and ac-
quisitions work is less repetitious, more efficient, and more inter-
esting when the system is automated.
</p>
<p>GIFTS AND EXCHANGES
</p>
<p>Gift sources may be solicited or unsolicited. Solicited gifts in-
clude items for the professional collection, items for the collec-
tors&rsquo; collection, and personal papers and memorabilia of impor-
tance. Unsolicited gifts come from well-meaning people who
contribute collections of professional interest, publications of or-
ganizations, or personal publications. Gifts should be acknowl-
edged in writing, mentioning the quantity and describing the na-
ture of the titles. The library may not estimate the value of the
gifts; this is the job of a professional appraiser, approved by the In-
ternal Revenue Service. Titles from the donated collections should
be selected by using the same criteria as purchased materials.
</p>
<p>Many libraries have exchange arrangements with other libraries
in which they mutually share materials without charge. These
shared materials may be unwanted or duplicate materials, or they
may be new materials of their own publication.
</p>
<p>The library should have a written policy on gifts and exchanges.
For example, unwanted gifts may be offered to other libraries, may
be sold in a library book sale or to a secondhand book dealer, may
be given free to patrons, or may be thrown away. Those discarding
materials, especially in public libraries, need to be sensitive to the
gift givers and to the library&rsquo;s supporters.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Most of the changes that the acquisitions staff has experienced
have come with the advent of automation in libraries. Automation
has eased the labor-intensive, repetitive work involved in ordering
procedures. Bibliographic utilities, automated vendor services,
and the integrated library automation systems all have helped to
make the tasks of acquisitions less tedious and more enjoyable.
Many libraries have combined the ordering and cataloging func-
tions and renamed the unit the bibliographic division.

</p>
<p>Cataloging and Classification
</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>author number: A letter and number combination assigned to a
particular book representing the author. The letter is determined by
the first letter of the author&rsquo;s last name, and the decimal number that
follows the letter represents the second and latter letters of the au-
thor&rsquo;s last name. Combined with the classification number, it forms
a unique symbol, notation, or call number, indicating the book&rsquo;s
shelf address. The author number assures that the books on the same
subject will be shelved side by side, alphabetically, by authors. Au-
thor number is also called book number or Cutter number.
</p>
<p>bibliographic record: A term used to describe the cataloging in-
formation for an item. Elements on a bibliographic record include
author, title, publisher, date of publication, physical description of
the item, notes, subject headings, and all other pertinent informa-
tion needed to identify the material. The elements with their proper
form are prescribed in a reference tool titled Anglo-American Cata-
loguing Rules, Second Edition, 1998 Revision.
</p>
<p>book number: Same as author number.
</p>
<p>call number: A combination of a classification number and a let-
ter-and-number code representing the author. Each call number is
a unique number through which library users can easily locate
needed material on the shelf.
</p>
<p>catalog: A list or a record of all the materials in a library or in a
consortium of libraries.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>cataloging: The process of organizing library materials and mak-
ing them accessible to library users. Cataloging work includes de-
scriptive cataloging, assigning subject headings, and assigning
classification numbers. Cataloging electronic data and informa-
tion is called metadata.
</p>
<p>cataloging in publication: Abbreviated as CIP, it is the cataloging
information printed on the verso of the title page of a publication.
This information is supplied by the Library of Congress and can be
used for the cataloging convenience of libraries.
</p>
<p>classification number: The number/letters assigned to a work to
indicate its subject. The purpose is to group all like subjects together
on the shelves for easy browsing. There are two universally ac-
cepted classification systems. Most libraries use either the Dewey
Decimal Classification system or the Library of Congress Classifi-
cation system.
</p>
<p>copy cataloging: The cataloger matches the newly acquired mate-
rial with the cataloging information already completed on a data-
base or other sources by some other cataloger. The information is
copied or downloaded onto the local library&rsquo;s database. This is the
most efficient way to perform cataloging.
</p>
<p>Cutter number: Same as author number.
</p>
<p>descriptive cataloging: The first step of the cataloging process
which involves describing the material physically and determining
the access points. The rules listed in the reference tool Anglo-
American Cataloging Rules, Second Edition, 1998 Revision, are
followed to perform this task.
</p>
<p>Dewey Decimal Classification: A system for classifying library
materials by subject. The system puts the entire world of knowl-
edge into ten main classes where a three-digit number is used to
represent each class. For example, 000 is Generalities, 100 is Phi-
losophy and Psychology, and so on. Following the three-digit
number may be a decimal point after which more digits are added
to define the subject specifically.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Dublin Core: New rules devised by the library world to catalog
electronic materials. It defines a core set of metadata elements that
allows authors and information providers to describe their work
and to facilitate interoperability among resource discovery tools.
The required elements include subject, title, author, publisher,
other agent, date, object type, form, identifier, relation, source,
language, and coverage.
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Classification: Same idea as the Dewey
Decimal Classification system, except that, for representing sub-
jects, instead of the three-digit number, letters or a letter-and-num-
ber combination is used. For example, A is for General Works, B-BJ
is for Philosophy, Psychology, and so on.
</p>
<p>notation: A number or number-and-letter combination that is pre-
scribed in the classification scheme. A notation is a call number.
</p>
<p>original cataloging: A way of cataloging during which all the
procedures to catalog an item are done originally, as opposed to
copying the cataloging information already done by someone else.
The tasks include doing descriptive cataloging, assigning subject
headings, assigning classification numbers, and assigning book
numbers, all according to the prescribed rules.
</p>
<p>subject cataloging: The cataloging process that involves assign-
ing subject headings and classification numbers to materials. For
subject headings, the reference tool to use is either the Library of
Congress Subject Headings or the Sears List of Subject Headings,
depending on the choice of the library. For classification, libraries
use either the Dewey Decimal Classification and Relative Index or
the Library of Congress Classification Schedules.
</p>
<p>subject heading: A specified listed term used for library catalogs
to describe the subject matter of materials. Only certain terms are
acceptable and must be chosen from the Library of Congress Sub-
ject Headings or from the Sears Lists of Subject Headings.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>THE CATALOG
</p>
<p>The library catalog is a record of the collection of a particular li-
brary or of the holdings of many libraries combined. Listed in the
catalog are materials of different formats, including books, video
recordings, sound recordings, computer disks, serials, slides, and
other media. The catalog provides a list that is shared by every as-
pect of a library&rsquo;s operation and which can be an important re-
source for other libraries as well. It is important that the catalog is
kept up to date with accurate information on the holdings of the li-
brary.
</p>
<p>Functions of the Catalog
</p>
<p>The library catalog serves the following functions:
</p>
<p>1. To inform the users of the library&rsquo;s collection; in the case of a
combined union catalog, to inform the users of the available
materials of multiple cooperating libraries
</p>
<p>2. To help users choose the desired materials
3. To provide access to the materials by having the location
</p>
<p>symbols listed in the catalog
</p>
<p>Types of Catalogs
</p>
<p>Catalogs come in different types. Historically, five of the most
popular types are:
</p>
<p>1. The card catalog: For over one hundred years and up to the
late 1980s, the card catalog was the catalog type most widely
used. The card catalog uses three-by-five-inch cards on which
bibliographic information about the item is typed or printed.
They are filed alphabetically by author, title, and subject in
cabinets specially designed for this purpose.
</p>
<p>2. The book catalog: The book catalog was the earliest form of
catalog. It is a handwritten list of all the titles the library has.
Later on, computer printouts replaced these handwritten lists.
</p>
<p>3. The COM (Computer Output Microform) catalog: This cata-
log of bibliographic records is produced on microfilm or mi-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>crofiche. A special microfilm/microfiche reader is necessary
to read the information on the microform.
</p>
<p>4. The CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) catalog:
In this form, information is engraved on a CD-ROM. A com-
puter with CD-ROM playing capacity is necessary for this
type of catalog. Many libraries in the late 1980s and early
1990s used the CD-ROM catalog as a substitute for the more
expensive online catalog. The CD-ROM catalog is updated
on a regular basis, usually quarterly or monthly.
</p>
<p>5. The OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog): At present, this
is the most widely used type of catalog. Using the computer
and special software, the library can use the same biblio-
graphic information to place orders as to catalog materials re-
ceived. The same database as the public access catalog is
available. The most current OPAC is World Wide Web based,
referred to as the WebOPAC, which is gradually replacing the
character-based OPAC of the 1990s. The WebOPAC can be
customized with graphics, logos, and colors to make it not
only an efficient tool but also attractive and easy to use.
</p>
<p>ELEMENTS OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD
</p>
<p>Whatever the style of the catalog, on each bibliographic record,
the elements included are the same. Elements are prescribed by a
widely accepted cataloging tool titled Anglo-American Cataloguing
Rules, Second Edition, 1998 Revision. The elements that used to
be presented on catalog cards today can be found on the computer
screen. The online public access catalog contains the same infor-
mation that was typed or printed on the card, but its appearance is
in accordance with the MARC format, devised by the Library of
Congress. Elements included in a bibliographic record comprise
the following: author, title, call number, ISBN, LCCN, physical
description of material, imprint, notes, subject headings, added
author, added title, and other local information deemed necessary
by the cataloger.
</p>
<p>Figures 5.1 and 5.2 are examples of bibliographic elements in
public display format and in MARC format, respectively.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CATALOGING
</p>
<p>Whether or not a needed bibliographic record is available dic-
tates the way cataloging is done. If the record can be found from
other catalogs or from any of the bibliographic utilities, the work
of cataloging is made easy by copying the existing information
and inserting the needed local data; the cataloging is done. This
process is called copy cataloging. On the other hand, if the biblio-
graphic record cannot be found in any source, the cataloger then
has to follow the rules, the processes, and the procedures to cata-
log the item. This process is called original cataloging.
</p>
<p>Copy Cataloging
</p>
<p>Since the majority of library acquisitions have already been cata-
loged at the Library of Congress or at some other library, the local
library needs only to search for the bibliographic record and adopt
the existing cataloging information. Although some libraries adopt the

<p>cataloging information for local use without change, others may
make minor changes or modifications to suit their local needs. Copy
cataloging is a widespread practice in the library world. It saves per-
sonnel, time, and money, resulting in speedier service while main-
taining high quality. Copy cataloging should be performed whenever
possible.
</p>
<p>Information for copy cataloging comes from different sources.
They include the Library of Congress, cataloging in publication,
commercial sources, bibliographic utilities and networks, and
print sources.
</p>
<p>Library of Congress
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress produces and distributes catalogs with
full bibliographic information in print format, in microform, in
CD-ROM format, and on computer tape, all used extensively by li-
braries as a source for copy cataloging. The National Union Cata-
log, published in book form as well as on microfiche and in CD-
ROM format, had been the most widely used source for cataloging
in the past. Since the majority of libraries are automated now, cata-

<p>loging records of the Library of Congress on computer disc for-
mat, called the MARC (machine readable cataloging) tapes, have
become the primary source. Libraries can subscribe to the MARC
tapes and, by matching the items to be cataloged to the existing re-
cords on MARC tapes and adding local coding to them, cataloging
is quickly and easily completed. MARC records have become the
original source for cataloging, directly through the use of MARC
tapes or indirectly through the use of bibliographic utilities and
vendor databases, which originate from the MARC tapes.
</p>
<p>Cataloging in Publication (CIP)
</p>
<p>In most books published in the United States, cataloging infor-
mation can be found on the verso side (the back) of the title page.
Before a book is published, the publisher sends the galley proofs
of the book to the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress
catalogs the item within ten days and sends the cataloging infor-
mation back so that the information can be included on the verso
side of the title page of the book at publication. This process is
called cataloging in publication. It benefits libraries enormously
because the information comes with the item and no further
searching for cataloging information is necessary. Figure 5.3 dis-
plays a sample cataloging-in-publication page.
</p>
<p>Because the cataloging in publication is done before the book is
published, information on the full physical description cannot be
included. The copy cataloger is required to fill in the missing in-
formation. The title may be changed at the last minute; a subtitle
may be added; the date of publication may be revised; or other
changes may occur. When using cataloging in publication as the
cataloging source, the copy cataloger must be careful in adopting
the printed information that all necessary changes and additions
are included.
</p>
<p>Commercial Sources
</p>
<p>When books and other nonprint media are supplied by commer-
cial book vendors, catalog cards or computer disks may be pro-
vided too. For small libraries with limited resources and person-
nel, ordering fully processed items may be the best way of solving</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the cataloging problem. Under such circumstances, items are re-
ceived with a full set of cards or with bibliographic information on
tapes that can be downloaded into the library&rsquo;s system. Except for
occasional minor changes, very little cataloging work is necessary.
</p>
<p>Bibliographic Utilities and Networks
</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, bibliographic utilities and networks were dis-
cussed. Cataloging resources on the database of a network have
been based on the Library of Congress MARC tapes plus the con-
tribution of member libraries. Libraries belonging to a network
can match the material to be cataloged to the same title found and
displayed on the screen. At this point, the copy cataloger needs
only to attach the local item to the bibliographic record by adding
the local holding symbol. This is also a convenient and efficient
way of cataloging.
</p>
<p>Print Sources
</p>
<p>For manual, nonautomated libraries, information for copy cata-
loging can be found in print sources such as Booklist. It is used by

</p>
<p>It is important to remember that in performing copy cataloging,
information can be completely adopted only if an exact match is
located. Slight variations such as different edition or different
binding are not considered an exact match, and, in such cases, in-
formation must be altered and modified so that a new entry can be
established.
</p>
<p>Where original cataloging has continued to be the librarian&rsquo;s re-
sponsibility, copy cataloging has fallen to the library technician.
The library technician&rsquo;s skills, knowledge, and familiarity with the
procedures and sources of copy cataloging are essential for accu-
rate copy cataloging. Occasionally, for items such as locally pro-
duced materials for which matches cannot be found in the data-
bases of any local or remote sites, original cataloging must be
performed.
</p>
<p>Original Cataloging
</p>
<p>Although a majority of library materials are cataloged by way
of copy cataloging, there are always some materials, such as local
government publications, materials in specialized subject fields,
publications or productions from private sources, pamphlets, and
other types of materials for which matches cannot be found on
computer databases. Under such circumstances, the cataloger must
perform original cataloging.
</p>
<p>Original cataloging means that the cataloging on an item is done
by extracting the information needed for the bibliographic record
from the material itself, plus using some standard tools to establish
other necessary elements. As Figure 5.4 shows, the task of original
cataloging is divided into two broad areas, descriptive cataloging
and subject cataloging. Subject cataloging is done in two steps,
subject heading and classification number.
</p>
<p>Rules and regulations are formulated and published for each
step. These rules are used universally by the library world to pro-
vide consistency and uniformity. The library technician must be
familiar with appropriate cataloging tools that contain these rules
so that procedures for specific materials can be followed when</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>performing cataloging tasks. These reference tools include the An-
glo-American Cataloguing Rules, Second Edition, 1998 Revision,
Library of Congress Subject Headings, Sears List of Subject Head-
ings, Dewey Decimal Classification Schedules, Library of Congress
Classification and Relative Index, and C. A. Cutter&rsquo;s Three-Figure
Author Table. The steps of the cataloging processes together with
the tools being used are explained here.
</p>
<p>Descriptive Cataloging
</p>
<p>The Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, Second Edition, 1998
Revision, is used when performing the first step in cataloging,
called descriptive cataloging. Generally referred to as AACR2R in
the library world, this volume is a collection of rules adopted by a
majority of libraries in the United States, Great Britain, Canada,
and Australia. Published by the American Library Association,
the AACR2R supplies rules for the physical description of both
books and nonbook materials. It also presents rules for establish-
ing the access points for retrieving materials, called the main en-
tries and the added entries. Furthermore, it spells out exactly how
bibliographic information is to be transferred onto the card or into
the library computer databases. In addition to the print format,
AACR2R is available on CD-ROM produced by the Library of
Congress, titled Cataloger&rsquo;s Desktop. For example, on Figure 5.5,
the shadowed areas are elements governed by the AACR2R rules.

<p>Subject Cataloging
</p>
<p>The second step in original cataloging is called subject catalog-
ing. Subject cataloging is divided into two steps: subject heading
and classification number.
</p>
<p>Subject heading. In searching for information or doing research,
most library users attempt to find materials in a particular field by
checking under the appropriate subject. Thus, the task of assigning
subject headings to materials takes on great importance. The pur-
pose of assigning subject headings is to list all the materials on a
given subject under a uniform term or phrase, so that, in one
search, library users can identify all the materials on a certain topic
and also can find them side by side on the shelves. A subject head-
ing may be a term, name of a person, group, place, or a phrase. To
ensure uniformity, terms to be used for subject headings are listed
in two reference sources. When assigning subject headings, the
cataloger uses a reference source that lists legitimate terms. Library
of Congress Subject Headings, designed and constantly updated
by the Library of Congress, is the choice of a majority of libraries.

<p>Classification number. After the descriptive cataloging is done,
subject headings are assigned. The next step is to assign the classi-
fication number. A classification number places all similar and re-
lated subject materials together on the shelves so that library users
can more conveniently locate what they want. The classification
number, combined with the author number, forms a unique nota-
tion, which becomes the location symbol for the material. With
this unique notation&mdash;called a call number&mdash;labeled on the spine,
the library staff can easily shelve the material in its proper place
after each use.

braries. Two have been universally adopted and are widely used.

<p>Classification system is preferred by academic libraries and spe-
cial libraries.
</p>
<p>Dewey Decimal Classification system. This system divides the
entire world of knowledge into ten main classes. The ten classes
are divided further into ten divisions, and each division divided
into ten sections. All classification numbers are three-digit num-
bers, such as 100, 140, 589, etc. The first digit indicates the main
class, the second digit indicates the division, and the third digit in-
dicates the section. Following the three-digit number is a decimal
point after which additional digits may be included that more spe-
cifically define the subject. For example, the Dewey Decimal
Classification number for a book may be 025.431. Zero, as the first
digit, indicates the book is in Generalities class; 2, as the second
digit, represents the topic of library and information science; and
5, as the third digit, further indicates that the book is about the op-
erations of libraries, archives, and information centers. The 431
after the decimal point describes the subject even more specifi-
cally by indicating that this book is about a classification system
called the Dewey Decimal Classification system. The Dewey Dec-
imal Classification and Relative Index, a four-volume set, is pub-
lished and continually updated by the Forest Press, a division of
OCLC. In addition to the print version, the Dewey Decimal Classi-
fication, and Relative Index is also produced on CD-ROM, called
Dewey for Windows, available from OCLC Forest Press.
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Classification system. The Library of Con-
gress classification system divides knowledge into twenty-one
broad categories, using a letter to represent each subject field. The
letters I, O, W, X, and Y are excluded. Each subject letter may be
combined with one or two more letters followed by a numeric
value that may have a decimal point and more digits. For example,
consider the Library of Congress Classification number HF5549.5. H,
in this case, represents social science; HF means the book is about
commerce; by adding 5549 it is clear that the book is about person-
nel management. Adding .5 to the number specifies employment
management. Each of the twenty-one subjects is developed sepa-
rately and therefore has its own separate booklet outlining the de-
tails. The Library of Congress Classification schedules are pub-
lished and maintained by the Library of Congress. Every schedule</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>has its own publication schedule; updated schedules are published
from time to time. In addition to the print format, the Library of
Congress has produced Classification Plus, which is a full-text,
Windows-based CD-ROM that contains the Library of Congress
Classification Schedules and Library of Congress Subject Head-
ings. Classification Plus is available as an annual subscription
with quarterly issues.
</p>
<p>The book number. Whether the Dewey Decimal or the Library
of Congress Classification schedule is used, the book number, also
called the author number or the Cutter number, must be added and
attached to the classification number to make the symbol com-
plete, resulting in a unique notation representing the particular
item. There are different ways of assigning the book number. For
libraries using the Dewey Decimal Classification system, one way
to figure out the book number is to use a reference tool titled C. A.
Cutter Three-Figure Author Table or a different version of it with
the same content, titled Cutter-Sanborn Three-Figure Author Ta-
ble, or a more simplified version of it called Cutter&rsquo;s Two-Figure
Author Table. For libraries using the Library of Congress Classifi-
cation system, a simple Cutter Numbers Devised by LC is used.
Basically, these reference tools all work the same way by taking
the first letter of the author&rsquo;s last name and adding a series of num-
bers to it. The numbers are so devised that materials about the
same subject will be arranged alphabetically on the shelves by au-
thor, again, for easy browsing by library users. For example, the
author number for Samuel Baker is .B177. Note that there is a dec-
imal point before the author number. Therefore, the book with this
author number should be shelved as B first and then as .177, digit
by digit, not as the whole number 177.
</p>
<p>Some school and public libraries do not use the Cutter&rsquo;s refer-
ence for assigning author numbers. They simply use the first three
letters of the author&rsquo;s last name or the first six letters of the au-
thor&rsquo;s last name, depending on the size of the collection. The ulti-
mate goal is the same, that of arranging the materials by subject
first, under the same subject, and by the author&rsquo;s last name.
</p>
<p>In some cases, more information is added and reflected in the
call number. They are called work marks and include prefixes such
as REF (for reference book), FIC (for fiction), etc., added to the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>top of the call number, or publication date (such as 2000), volume
number, and copy number added to the bottom of the call number.
This works the same for both the Dewey Decimal system and the
Library of Congress system. A complete call number may look
like this: REF 650.14 .L112 2000 V.1 C.1.
</p>
<p>On the bibliographic record that is displayed in Figure 5.7, the
shaded area shows the classification number and the author num-
ber, which together form the call number.
</p>
<p>For cataloging electronic information, a set of new rules, called
the Dublin Core, is applied. Dublin Core defines a set of metadata
elements that would allow authors and information providers to de-
scribe their work. The goal is to simplify the cataloging processes
for such ephemeral electronic resources that do not warrant full cat-
aloging. The required elements include subject, title, author, pub-
lisher, other agent, date, object type, form, identifier, relation, source,
language, and coverage. For more information on the Dublin Core,
visit its Web site at &lt;http://dublincore.org/&gt;.

<p>This section gives a general introduction on how original cata-
loging is done and how the result appears. The intention is to give

original cataloging. The information provided here is not suffi-

</p>
<p>THE MARC RECORD
</p>
<p>Whether copy cataloging or original cataloging, knowledge and
understanding of the MARC format is essential for catalogers. A
MARC record is a machine readable cataloging record. Where
catalog card information can be typed onto the card, with automa-
tion, information to the computer database must be sent in a way
that the computer can interpret the information. The Library of
Congress has devised this format, and libraries all over the world
have adopted it. Essentially, each area on the card is put under a
three-digit number called a tag, which the computer interprets as
the code for the element. For example, 100 represents author,
while 245 represents title. An example of a MARC record is
shown in Figure 5.8.
</p>
<p>All MARC records start with tags. Then there are spaces for two
possible indicators, each with a numeric value of 0 to 9. Some in-
dicators are left blank, since they are undefined by the Library of
Congress. Following the indicators is the description, called a
</p>
<p>FIGURE 5.8. A MARC Record</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>field. Within each field, there may be several subfields, separated
by delimiters. For example, in Figure 5.8, 050 is called the tag, 00
are the two indicators, and Z693.5.U6K36 1995, in this case the
call number, is called the field. Within the field, | is the delimiter
(in some systems, $ or another symbol is used for the delimiter),
and |b indicates that what follows is in subfield b, in this case, K36
1995, the author number and the date.
</p>
<p>The copy cataloging staff must know how to read MARC for-
mat for easy editing and modifying. The original cataloger must
have a thorough detailed understanding of it to ensure that each el-
ement of the material is cataloged in the MARC format with the
correct tag, indicators, field, and subfields. For a complete expla-
nation of the MARC record and a complete listing of all MARC
tags, indicators, fields, and subfields, consult the Web site of the
Library of Congress at &lt;www.loc.gov/marc/&gt;.
</p>
<p>CATALOGING AND PROCESSING ROUTINES
</p>
<p>After materials are received by the acquisitions department and
are properly checked in, they are sent to the cataloging depart-
ment. In some libraries, the two departments are grouped into one,
called technical processing or some other name meaning the same
thing. Materials are then cataloged as described in this chapter and
finally physically prepared so that they can be shelved. The cata-
loging and processing routines are summarized here:
</p>
<p>1. Materials are received and properly checked in.
2. Search database or other sources for copy cataloging infor-
</p>
<p>mation.
3. If information is found, do copy cataloging.
4. If information is not found, do original cataloging.
5. Enter all necessary information onto the database according
</p>
<p>to MARC format.
6. For nonautomated libraries, card sets for the card catalog are
</p>
<p>prepared.
7. Prepare the materials physically, including placing spine la-
</p>
<p>bels on materials, attaching bar-code labels, attaching secu-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>rity strips, adding plastic jackets, stamping ownership stamp
in designated places, attaching date-due slips, etc.
</p>
<p>8. File catalog cards and shelf-list cards, if used.
</p>
<p>Cataloging, especially if the library is a part of the network,
must be done according to the discussed rules and format in this
chapter so that other libraries can use the records. Every library
has its own requirements for processing materials. So that all ma-
terials are processed uniformly, library technicians should be fa-
miliar with such processing routines of their own libraries and fol-
low the procedures rigidly.
</p>
<p>In the technical services area, the tasks of cataloging and classi-
fication are the most important library functions. Although they
can be time-consuming and labor-intensive duties, copy catalog-
ing has made it more cost effective and efficient for the cataloging
staff. Care and precision continue to be essential ingredients in the
process, especially as library customers become more adept at us-
ing automated devices. Because a small error spontaneously af-
fects an entire network system, refined skills and a broad knowl-
edge are expected from those in the technical services areas,
especially in cataloging and classification.

<p>Government Publications
</p>
<p>Title 44 of the U.S. Code is the law that guides the nation&rsquo;s poli-
cies on publishing, printing, distributing, and managing govern-
ment publications. According to Title 44, government publication
is defined as &ldquo;Information matter which is published as an individ-
ual document at government expense, or as required by law&rdquo; (U.S.
Code Annotated, 1927). The document may be published by the
government itself or by an outside publisher or printer at govern-
ment expense. The document may be in book form, a serial, audio-
visual material, or in electronic format, such as CD-ROM, or online.
The term government publication usually refers to a publication
from the federal government; however, publications from individ-
ual states, local governments, foreign governments, and interna-
tional organizations also are considered government documents.
</p>
<p>Some government documents are for the government&rsquo;s admin-
istrative or operational use. A large majority of government docu-
ments, however, provide authoritative and up-to-date information
for individual citizens. Government documents exist in all subject
fields and in all areas of knowledge. Sometimes a government
publication is the only source of information on a certain topic; on
other occasions, it may be the major source of information. In any
case, it constitutes a very important segment of a library&rsquo;s collec-
tion and is a necessary element in the library technician&rsquo;s area of
responsibility.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>fice of the U. S. government. In this program, depending on the
conditions, certain public, academic, or other types of libraries are
chosen to receive government publications at no charge. In return,
the libraries must provide to the general public comprehensive and
no-fee access to federal government information in all forms.
These libraries are called federal depository libraries. There are
currently about 1,400 federal depository libraries.
</p>
<p>government document: Also called government publication, the
item may be on any subject and in any format, but it is published
either by the government or at government&rsquo;s expense.

<p>Government Printing Office: A branch of the U.S. government
that is given the responsibility to produce documents created by
federal branches and offices and to disseminate the produced in-
formation through its Sales and the Federal Depository Library
Programs. It is the largest printing house in the world. It is com-
monly known as the GPO.
</p>
<p>Superintendent of Documents Classification system: A classi-
fication system devised for the purpose of classifying government
documents. The system groups publications of the same agency
together, rather than grouping according to the same subject, as
other classification systems usually do. It uses a letter-and num-
ber-combination to signify the agency, the subdivision of the
agency, the type of publication, the date of publication, and other
relevant information about the document. It is called the SuDoc
system for short.

<p>THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE
</p>
<p>Established in 1861, the Government Printing Office has be-
come the largest printing house in the world. At the GPO, one of
the world&rsquo;s largest volumes of informational literature is dissemi-
nated, distributing more than 65 million government publications
every year in print, microform, and electronic formats. It services
offices in both legislative houses, in the executive branch, and in
the judicial branch. Although the GPO does not produce every
document created by federal branches and offices, it prints con-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>gressional documents and materials that are urgent in nature.
Other materials are printed by commercial printers that have a
contractual arrangement with the government. When documents
are printed by commercial printers, they retain the GPO imprint
and are considered government publications.
</p>
<p>U.S. Code Title 44 establishes that the Public Printer, a person
nominated by the President of the United States with the consent
of the Senate, shall be in charge of the Government Printing Of-
fice. The Public Printer is responsible to the Joint Committee on
Printing, consisting of five senators and five members of the
House of Representatives. The U.S. Code states that the Public
Printer shall appoint a person, titled Superintendent of Documents,
to be in charge of receiving and selling government documents. The
responsibilities of the Superintendent of Documents include pre-
paring comprehensive catalogs and indexes for all documents and
distributing documents to agencies, libraries, and individuals through
Sales and Federal Depository Library Programs.
</p>
<p>After the passing of the Government Printing Office Electronic
Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993, the GPO pro-
gressed into the electronic age. The Superintendent of Documents
was put in charge of maintaining an electronic directory of federal
electronic information, providing a system of online access to the
Congressional Record, Federal Register, and other appropriate
publications, and operating an electronic storage facility for fed-
eral electronic information. Since then, documents have been pub-
lished and GPO databases have been established for easy access.
The electronic storage system makes it possible for the public to
access and retrieve older documents, and the system assists in the
sale and distribution of newly published materials. This service
that enables the public to have free access to electronic materials is
called GPO Access. GPO Access is located online at &lt;http://www.
access.gpo.gov.&gt; This act also requires that the Superintendent of
Documents maintain an electronic directory of federal electronic
information, the GPO Locator Service. The GPO Locator Service
describes the information it contains, gives referrals to federal de-
pository libraries that hold such information, lists the federal agen-
cies that house the data, and gives information about the GPO
Sales Program.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Two avenues for achieving the main purpose of the GPO, which
is to disseminate information, are with the Sales and with the Fed-
eral Library Depository Program.
</p>
<p>Sales
</p>
<p>Government publications constitute a very important part of a
library&rsquo;s collection. They are inexpensive or often free and encom-
pass special topics about which information is difficult to find in
any other type of publication.
</p>
<p>The Government Printing Office operates twenty-four book-
stores across the country and has a major distribution center
in Pueblo, Colorado. Its address is Consumer Information Center,
Pueblo, Colorado, 81009. Books, posters, pamphlets, maps, CD-
ROMs, and computer disks are available in the Sales Program. In
addition to direct sales to bookstore customers, certain documents
can be acquired through commercial bookstores, government doc-
uments dealers, and jobbers. Mail, fax, telephone, and online or-
dering are also accepted by the Superintendent of Documents,
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 20402. The ad-
dresses, hours, and maps of all bookstores can be found on the
GPO Web site at &lt;http://www.gpo.gov/&gt;.
</p>
<p>The Government Printing Office publishes catalogs and indexes
to facilitate the selection and acquisition of documents. The Con-
sumer Information Catalog, which lists topics of interest to the
general public, is published four times a year and is distributed by
the Consumer Information Center in Pueblo, Colorado. Many of
the listed titles can be acquired with minimal or no charge. More
information on the list and its contents is available online at
&lt;www.pueblo.gsa.gov&gt;.
</p>
<p>A most important catalog published by the Government Print-
ing Office is titled Monthly Catalog of United States Government
Publications. This catalog covers new titles published by the gov-
ernment on a monthly basis, with a semiannual and annual cumu-
lative index. Titles listed are properly cataloged in MARC format,
and contain the bibliographic information along with the Super-
intendent of Documents Classification numbers and subject head-
ings. It serves not only as a selection tool but also as a cataloging</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and reference tool. In addition to the main list, there is information
on how to order publications; a list of government bookstores
around the country; and information on the Federal Depository Li-
brary Program, with a complete list of regional depository libraries.
</p>
<p>The Periodical Supplement is a separate part of the Monthly
Catalog of United States Government Publications and gives
complete bibliographic information for serials, including lists for
classification changes, title changes, ceased publications, and pe-
riodicals that are now available online.
</p>
<p>In addition to the print version, the Monthly Catalog of United
States Government Publications is available in CD-ROM format
and online. The online version is accessible at &lt;http://www.access.
gpo.gov/su_docs/dpos400.html&gt;, is updated daily, and contains
the bibliographic records published in the Monthly Catalog of
United States Government Publications since 1994.
</p>
<p>Federal Depository Library Program
</p>
<p>The Federal Depository Library Program was established by
the Depository Library Act of 1962. There are about 1,400 librar-
ies in the United States designated as depository libraries includ-
ing public, academic, or other types of libraries. This program&rsquo;s
main purpose is to assign designated libraries to receive govern-
ment publications at no charge, and, in return, the libraries must
provide to the general public comprehensive and no-fee access to
federal government information in all formats. This has been a
successful and valuable relationship for the federal government,
the participating libraries, and the general public.
</p>
<p>The depository libraries are designated by law or nominated by
senators and representatives for their states. There are two types of
depository libraries: the regional depository libraries and the se-
lective depository libraries. U.S. Code Title 44 stipulates that no
more than two libraries in each state may be designated as regional
depositories, which shall receive all government publications au-
thorized for distribution and shall keep such materials perma-
nently. The regional depository library may be a state library, an
academic library, or a public library. On the other hand, the selec-
tive depository libraries receive only selected categories of gov-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ernment publications that meet their own needs. The librarians in
charge of the government documents usually make the selection
from the lists sent to them by the Government Printing Office. The
materials in the selective depository library&rsquo;s collection may be
discarded after five years. Following are conditions for a particular
library to be named a depository library:
</p>
<p>1. Every senator may name two libraries in his or her state;
2. Every House of Representatives member may name two li-
</p>
<p>braries in his or her district;
3. A Special Act of Congress may designate a particular library
</p>
<p>as a depository;
4. All land-grant colleges, service academies, libraries of the
</p>
<p>government&rsquo;s executive departments are eligible to be named
a depository library;
</p>
<p>5. The American Antiquarian Society in Massachusetts;
6. The highest appellate court of any state may request that its
</p>
<p>library be designated as a depository library; and
7. Any accredited law school may request that its library be des-
</p>
<p>ignated as a depository library.
</p>
<p>In the networked environment, with the proliferation of elec-
tronic documents published by government agencies, a shift to-
ward a decentralized mode of access to government information is
anticipated. Depository libraries not only will have to keep abreast
with the technology by providing appropriate equipment for dis-
seminating information, but also will have to keep up with the pri-
mary producers of information in the depository program.
</p>
<p>SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
</p>
<p>As described in Chapter 5, cataloging of materials is done in
three distinct steps: descriptive cataloging, subject headings, and
classification. The cataloging of government documents is done
the same way. For descriptive cataloging, the same rules as for
nongovernment titles are followed, as contained in the Anglo-
American Cataloguing Rules, Second Edition, 1998 Revision. If a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>title is available only via the Internet, a computer file record is cre-
ated. If it is available both in print and electronically, the existing
record is enhanced by adding a 530 note and a linked URL in the
856 field of the MARC record. Also, as is the case for non-
government publications, the Library of Congress Subject Head-
ings is used for assigning subject headings to government docu-
ments. The classification system, however, is different. Whereas,
for general nongovernment materials, libraries choose to use ei-
ther the Dewey Decimal Classification system or the Library of
Congress Classification system, as explained in Chapter 5, for
government documents, a system called the Superintendent of
Documents Classification system, or SuDoc classification, is used.
</p>
<p>In the SuDoc classification system, documents are grouped to-
gether by issuing agency, not by subject, as is the case in the
Dewey Decimal and the Library of Congress Classification sys-
tems. The SuDoc notation consists first of an alphabetical designa-
tion representing the issuing government department or agency,
followed by a space. After the space, a number represents the sub-
ordinate division of the agency. This number is followed by a pe-
riod, then a number that signifies the type of publication of the
document. A colon follows, and, finally, a book number, which
may be the volume or issue number of a serial or the date of publi-
cation. A few examples of the alpha element for agencies are:
</p>
<p>A for Department of Agriculture
C for Department of Commerce
GP for Government Printing Office
J for Department of Justice
SBA for Small Business Administration
T for Department of Treasury
TD for Department of Transportation
X, Y for Congress
</p>
<p>After the agency letter(s) comes a number for the subordinate
bureau of the parent agency. Number 1 is used for the parent
agency, and numbers 2 through 99 are used for subordinate bu-
reaus, administrative offices, etc. For example, A 1 represents the
Agriculture Department, while A 13 represents the Forest Service,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>which is a branch of the Agriculture Department. Sometimes a
secondary subagency is also indicated after the period, such as
A 13.40. While A 13 is the Forest Service, A 13.40 is a subagency
of the Forest Service, the Southern Forest Experiment Station.
</p>
<p>After the subordinate agency designation, there is a period. Af-
ter the period, the next number represents the type of publication,
such as:
</p>
<p>1 for annual report
2 for general publication
3 for bulletins
5 for laws
6 for rules, regulations, and instructions
8 for handbooks, manuals, and guides
9 for bibliographies, list of publications
</p>
<p>10 for directories
</p>
<p>This sequence: the agency letter, the subordinate office number,
and the type of publication ends with a colon and constitutes the
class stem. After that will appear the book number which may be
in the form of letters or numbers referring to a volume number, is-
sue number, date, document number, or, for easy and swift identi-
fication, a unique letter-and-number combination designation.
</p>
<p>In summary, the elements of a SuDoc classification number
may include the following:
</p>
<p>1. Agency
2. Subordinate bureaus and offices
3. A period
4. Type of publication
5. A slash
6. A colon
7. Individual book number
8. Last three digits of the year for annual publications
</p>
<p>Exceptions to the rules include:
</p>
<p>1. X is used for Congressional Records.
2. Y 1 is used for House and Senate publications.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3. Y 3 is used for boards, commissions, and committees estab-
lished by Congress.
</p>
<p>4. Y 4 is used for hearings and committee prints.
</p>
<p>Following are some examples of SuDoc classification numbers.
</p>
<p>The SuDoc classification number for Monthly Catalog of
United States Government Publications is GP 3.8/8:998/12.
</p>
<p>GP denotes Government Printing Office.
3 denotes Library Division, which is a subdivision of the
</p>
<p>Government Printing Office.
8 denotes the type of publication as handbooks, manual, and
</p>
<p>guides.
/8 denotes that eight issues are published per year.
998 denotes the year of publication, in this case the year of
</p>
<p>1998.
/12 denotes the month of the publication, in this case the
</p>
<p>month of December.
</p>
<p>Y 4.W36:105-25 is another example of a SuDoc classifica-
tion number for a book titled The Future of Social Security
for This Generation and the Next.
</p>
<p>Y 4 is the designated notation for all hearings conducted by
the House of Representatives.
</p>
<p>W36 denotes the Committee on Ways and Means of the
House of Representatives.
</p>
<p>105-25 indicates the congressional session.
</p>
<p>The SuDoc classification number system is the call-number
scheme used in all depository libraries for their federal document
collection. Because the classification system is based on the cur-
rent organizational status of the government author, changes occur
as the organizational structure changes. As a result, publications of
some issuing agencies may be located at several different places
on the shelves.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>To accommodate the growing amount of electronic informa-
tion, the U.S. Government has created the Government Informa-
tion Locator Service, a decentralized standard for creating metadata.
It is still in the developmental stage and has not been completely
implemented. The Dublin Core metadata standard is suggested as
an alternative approach to cataloging online publications. The
American Library Association, the Government Printing Office,
the Library of Congress, and some other concerned parties to-
gether will decide the future of the cataloging and classification
system that should be applied to the online government publica-
tions.
</p>
<p>It is essential for the library technician to understand what the let-
ters and numbers in a SuDoc notation mean, but the responsibility for
actually assigning the SuDoc classification numbers for government
documents lies with the catalogers in the Library of Congress and the
Government Printing Office, as stipulated by U. S. Code, Title 44. Li-
brary technicians will be required to record the SuDoc designation
from a reference source such as the Monthly Catalog of United States
Government Publications or from some other computer databases. In
the rare case that an original SuDoc notation needs to be assigned, the
reference source The GPO Classification Manual is used for instruc-
tions. A detailed explanation of the Superintendent of Documents
Classification system is available at &lt;http://www.access.gpo.gov/
su_docs/dpos/explain.html&gt;.
</p>
<p>MAINTENANCE OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS
</p>
<p>Depository libraries that have a large government document col-
lection usually shelve them in a separate government document
area for in-house use only, sometimes taking over an entire floor of
the library building. When checking in an individual title, the
SuDoc number is copied, usually on the upper left-hand corner of
the cover, after which the material is shelved in the designated area
of the library according to its SuDoc numbers. Libraries that are
not depository libraries most likely will acquire some government
documents as well. In such cases, there usually is not a separate
government document section, and the documents are treated as</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>regular print materials and cataloged under the Dewey Decimal
Classification system or the Library of Congress Classification
system. They are processed in the same way as other titles and in-
tegrated into the regular collection, and may be checked out in the
same manner as any other materials in the collection. Further-
more, to provide public access to government documents pub-
lished only in electronic format, proper and adequate computer
equipment needs to be acquired and maintained by the library. For
more information and discussion about government publications,
the issues involved, etc., library technicians may want to join a
listserv organized by government documents librarians, called
GOVDOC-L.

<p>Chapter 7
</p>
<p>Serials
</p>
<p>A serial can be defined as a publication that is issued in succes-
sive parts, with the intention of continuous publication for an in-
definite period of time. It may be published regularly, such as
weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, etc. It may also be published
irregularly, without a definite publishing date. The term serial
connotes a large range of materials. Serials may include daily
newspapers, popular magazines such as Time, Newsweek, Good
Housekeeping; professional journals such as Library Journal, In-
formation Technology, American Historical Review; proceedings
of learned societies and conferences such as Proceedings of the
Annual Conference: Quality in Off-Campus Credit Programs; or
many reference materials that are usually considered books, but,
technically speaking, because they are published continuously, are
serials; The World Almanac and Books of Facts and The Annual of
Bookmaking are good examples. Depending on the nature of the
serial titles, they are commonly referred to as magazines (for pop-
ular reading), journals (publications devoted to a certain subject
with in-depth coverage), or simply as periodicals, indicating that
they are published periodically.
</p>
<p>Besides serving as popular reading materials for recreational
purposes, serials in professional subject areas contain the most up-
to-date information on current research and discoveries in fields
which are of substantial value to scholars, researchers, and stu-
dents, and, therefore, are considered an important part of the li-
brary collection. Libraries usually have a large collection of serial
titles and expend not only a large portion of their budget subscrib-
ing to serials but also considerable staff time in controlling and
managing the serials area.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>There are some unique problems in serials control. Library
technicians working in this area must be familiar with the prob-
lems and must learn to deal with them. One problem is the change
of a title and the numbering sequence. Sometimes the publisher
will change the title of a serial completely or perhaps some of the
words in the title. The serial may then carry continuous volume
numbers or may start with new volume numbers. Sometimes a se-
rial will become two different journals; sometimes two titles will
merge to be one; sometimes one title will be absorbed by another.
All of these changes can be very confusing for the library user un-
less exact information regarding the changes is recorded in the cat-
alog. Another problem is lost issues. Normally, the serial titles are
in complete sequence, yet very often issues will be missing, lost,
or damaged and removed so that a gap appears. To get replace-
ments for the needed issues is difficult and costly. Occasionally, the
publication of a title is delayed, and sometimes the title ceases to
be published altogether. Impeccable records are required on every
title of the library&rsquo;s holding, from the first issue up to the moment;
when the last issue arrived; when the next issue is scheduled to
come; of all the changes that have happened to the title. Further-
more, claiming must be done for the missing issues; replacements
must be ordered for the lost issues, and issues need to be prepared
and sent to the bindery for binding; back issues need to be kept in
order before they are sent to the bindery. Library technicians
working with serials need to be knowledgeable about local poli-
cies and processing procedures and need to read the literature in
the field to keep up with changes. Although the overall manage-
ment of serials is not necessarily a problem, careful and systematic
monitoring can become a labor-intensive, time-consuming, dy-
namic, and challenging job.
</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>binding: In order to better organize the back issues of serials, and
for the purpose of preservation, libraries regularly (once or twice a
year) send back issues to commercial binderies so that they can be
consolidated into one item. For example, one bound issue most</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>likely will contain one serial&rsquo;s monthly publications for a whole
year.
</p>
<p>claiming: The process of informing the serials vendor or the pub-
lisher that a particular issue was not received and that a replace-
ment copy should be sent to the library.
</p>
<p>e-journal: Journals that are published electronically. The e-journal
began with CD-ROM production; now they are mostly online and
can be accessed through the World Wide Web, with or without
paying a fee.
</p>
<p>journal: A continuous publication consisting of articles in a spe-
cific subject field; also referred to as a professional journal. Li-
brary Journal and American Historical Review are examples. See
also the definition of serial.
</p>
<p>routing: When a new issue is received, it is forwarded to individu-
als who have expressed an interest in reading every issue of this ti-
tle. When the first person is finished, the issue is routed to the sec-
ond person on the list, etc.
</p>
<p>serial: A title that is published consecutively in parts, and is in-
tended to be published continuously for an indefinite period of
time. It may have a regular publishing schedule such as weekly,
monthly, annually, or it may be published irregularly, at a time
deemed necessary and appropriate by the publisher. Serials are
commonly referred to as magazines, journals, or periodicals.
</p>
<p>serials control: Library tasks involved in managing serials titles
and keeping them in good order and accessible to library users. In-
cluded are functions such as check-in, claiming, binding, replace-
ment of back issues, and shelf maintenance.
</p>
<p>USBE: An acronym for the United States Book Exchange, Inc. It
is a clearinghouse for back issues of serials and old books. Li-
braries join as members and pay an annual fee, sending their sur-
plus and duplicate issues to the USBE. When a back issue is
needed, libraries pay a minimum fee to buy it from the USBE&rsquo;s
huge inventory.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ORDERING
</p>
<p>Bibliographic Verification
</p>
<p>Similar to the acquisition of books or other types of library ma-
terials, when a serial title is to be acquired, complete bibliographic
information must be in order. The necessary information includes
the exact title of the serial, the frequency of publication, the price,
the International Standard Serials Number (ISSN), and other perti-
nent information such as whether and where it is indexed. De-
pending on the individual library, the reference tools used to verify
bibliographic information for serial titles vary. Two commonly
used titles include Ulrich&rsquo;s International Periodicals Directory
and The Gale Directory of Publications and Broadcast Media.
More resources are found online, such as MediaFinder and
PubList.com. Besides being used as verifying tools by the serials
staff, they are good reference resources in general. Library techni-
cians working with serials must also become familiar with the
sources that are used locally.
</p>
<p>Ulrich&rsquo;s International Periodicals Directory is published by
R. R. Bowker in New York. It is a list of foreign and domestic se-
rial titles arranged by subject fields. For each title, bibliographic
and order information are included. It is kept current with an Up-
date three times a year. Besides the print format, it is available in
CD-ROM format and online.
</p>
<p>The Gale Directory of Publications and Broadcast Media is an
annual publication that provides information on newspapers, peri-
odicals, and broadcasting stations in the United States.
</p>
<p>MediaFinder is an online source for subscription to and infor-
mation regarding print media and catalogs. It is organized by type
of materials, in which magazines, newsletters, newspapers, and
periodicals are all searchable categories. The Web site is
&lt;http://www.mediafinder.com/&gt;.
</p>
<p>PubList.com is a comprehensive directory of information about
serial publications and newspapers around the world. Its Web site
is &lt;http://www.publist.com/&gt;.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Periodical vendors usually supply catalogs listing the serial ti-
tles that they handle. Such catalogs are also used as verifying
tools.
</p>
<p>Vendors
</p>
<p>If all their serial titles were ordered individually directly from
their publishers, imagine the volume of work it would be to pro-
cess the hundreds or thousands of individual invoices, renewing
each title regularly, and generally dealing with countless publish-
ers as different concerns arose. To facilitate the ordering, billing,
and invoicing procedures, and to simplify the redundant tasks,
most libraries use jobbers, also called dealers or subscription
agencies, to order their entire list of serials or the majority of the ti-
tles. Some publishers, such as The Reader&rsquo;s Digest and Ms. maga-
zine, for instance, will not allow a dealer to be the middleperson,
and, consequently, libraries must subscribe to these titles directly
from publishers.
</p>
<p>Even though a serials vendor does not give a discount and does
charge a service fee, it is still cost effective to employ this service.
The vendor keeps the library&rsquo;s subscription list in order and sends
an invoice once a year to the library. Besides keeping the subscrip-
tion list, renewing the titles automatically for the library, and
claiming missing issues, the vendor also tracks the problem titles,
title changes, suspension, and cessation, all of which is of great as-
sistance in time and effort to the serials staff in managing serial ti-
tles.
</p>
<p>Some of the more prominent serials vendors are EBSCO (&lt;http://
www.ebsco.com/&gt;), Blackwell&rsquo;s Online Bookshop (&lt;http://www.
blackwell.co.uk&gt;), and Turner/Faxon (&lt;http://www.faxon.com/&gt;).
Library technicians should be familiar with the vendor that is used
locally, its services, and the procedures for conducting a close com-
munication with its representative.
</p>
<p>CATALOGING
</p>
<p>The cataloging of serials follows the same principles as the cat-
aloging of books, namely, using the Anglo-American Cataloguing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Rules, Second Edition, 1998 Revision, for descriptive cataloging,
using the Library of Congress Subject Headings or Sears List of
Subject Headings for assigning subject headings, and using the
Dewey Decimal Classification or the Library of Congress Classifi-
cation system to assign call numbers. However, the practice of a
majority of libraries, especially small- or medium-sized libraries,
is to eliminate call numbers for serial titles. Most libraries arrange
serials on the shelves alphabetically by title.
</p>
<p>Chapter 12 of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, Second
Edition, 1998 Revision, makes provisions for cataloging serials.
The main difference from book cataloging is that the publication
date, the starting date, or the first-known date is recorded with a
dash and a space followed by the future closing date. If the serial
has ceased publication, the closing date blank is filled in. The nec-
essary bibliographic information also includes the publication fre-
quency, the library&rsquo;s holding information, and, if there has been a
title change, the previous title or the continued title.
</p>
<p>Also in Chapter 12, what constitutes a title change is explained.
If any word in the title other than an article, preposition, or con-
junction is changed, added, or deleted, it is considered a title
change. If the order of the first five words in the title is modified, a
title change has occurred. Any title change requires that a new re-
cord be created.
</p>
<p>On the MARC record, certain tags and fields are designated to
explain serial characteristics. For instance, the tag 310 is used to
indicate frequency, tag 780 is used for recording the preceding en-
try, and tag 785 is used for recording the succeeding entry. For a
complete explanation of MARC tags and fields for serials, check
MARC formats for bibliographic data on the Web site of the Li-
brary of Congress &lt;http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/&gt;.
</p>
<p>When using a bibliographic utility to perform copy cataloging,
local holding information must be added. Figure 7.1 displays the
bibliographic information of a serial title in MARC format, as re-
quired by a serials cataloger. When shown in the public display
mode, the same record will display information as shown in Figure
7.2.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>SERIALS CONTROL
</p>
<p>Record keeping is most important for serials. The work is com-
plete for books or videos, for example, once they are received, cat-
aloged, and processed. Not so for serials; once a serial title is or-
dered, a record is established, and, from then on, the record needs
to be updated as long as the subscription is active. There are steps

<p>involved in keeping the serials records current. Every successive is-
sue must be checked in, cataloged, and processed. When an issue
is not received, claiming must be done. When an issue is missing, a
replacement must be located. Then there are concerns such as
shelf maintenance and back-issue problems that need to be ad-
dressed.
</p>
<p>Check-In
</p>
<p>Each library has its own established routines for the check-in of
serials, which include daily newspapers, weekly magazines, monthly
journals, and other continuous publications that are published at
regular or irregular intervals. Check-in is the first step of serial
control. When a title is received, it is marked either on a check-in
card or on a computer. Different check-in cards are used for the
manual system, which include the weekly card, the monthly card,
and the daily card. The serial title, frequency of publication, bind-
ery information, and any other needed bibliographic information
about the title is recorded on the card. When each issue arrives, the
proper box on the card is checked or dated. Figure 7.3 shows a
weekly check-in card bought from a library supply company.
</p>
<p>There are many advantages to using the automated serial con-
trol system. Once the bibliographic information is entered into the
serial catalog, the record can easily be manipulated for updating
and other purposes, and an entry for the public catalog is also es-
tablished at the same time. Furthermore, with the strike of a key,
other functions in serials control can be performed simultaneously.
The bibliographic records of all serial titles have been entered be-
fore the first issue arrives. When an issue is received, the library
technician will pull up the bibliographic record of the particular ti-
tle and attach the volume number, issue number, and the publica-
tion date of the new issue. See Figure 7.4 for a serial check-in card
display on the computer screen.
</p>
<p>Processing routines done at check-in include stamping the prop-
erty stamp, adding the security strip, attaching the bar-code label,
and any other tasks that are deemed necessary by the library, usu-
ally outlined in the serial check-in manual. For instance, some aca-
demic libraries copy the table of contents of certain journals and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>send them to interested faculty; some libraries produce a routing
slip for particular titles and route the titles to interested staff mem-
bers, etc.
</p>
<p>Claiming
</p>
<p>Claiming is an important process in serial management. When an
issue is not received at the regular time, the claim should be made
immediately; publishers usually do not print many extra issues, and
the longer the time gap, the slimmer the chance of getting a replace-
ment issue from the publisher. Claims can be made directly to the
publisher or through a vendor, according to the agreement between
the library and the vendor. Claims can be made on the claim form
supplied by the vendor, in letter form, by telephone call, electroni-
cally via e-mail, or, if the library has an integrated system and it is
connected to the vendor&rsquo;s database, through the serials control
claim function. When claiming an issue, it is important to check the
shelves first to make sure that the issue is actually missing. It is also
</p>
<p>FIGURE 7.3. Sample of a Check-In Card for Weekly Series</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>important to supply the vendor or the publisher with the specific
item information for the issue such as volume number, date of issue,
etc. Figure 7.5 shows a claim screen.
</p>
<p>Binding
</p>
<p>For preservation and safekeeping of back issues, serials are sent
to binderies on a specific schedule so that titles can be bound annu-
ally/semiannyally or at some other frequency, depending on the li-
brary policy and the publication frequency. The library serials staff
needs to prepare the following information, usually on a printed
form, for the bindery: the exact title to appear on the spine; the ex-
act position of the title; the color of the binding; the color of ink
and the typeface, and other important information such as volume
number and year. A library also needs to decide the frequency of
</p>
<p>FIGURE 7.4. Serial Check-In Screen</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the bindings and maintain that schedule. Figure 7.6 shows a sam-
ple serial binding screen.
</p>
<p>Not all libraries send back issues of serials to the binderies.
Binding back issues is a time-consuming, expensive endeavor, and
the bound issues occupy a huge amount of shelf space, which is at
a premium in many libraries. It is standard policy for smaller li-
</p>
<p>FIGURE 7.5. Sample Claim Screen</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>braries to buy back issues of serials in microfilm or microfiche for-
mat and discard the paper issues once the microform is received.
Although some back issues can be found on CD-ROM and some
online, it is hard to predict whether these media will be replacing
the microform and the traditional bound form.
</p>
<p>Replacing Back Issues
</p>
<p>Occasionally a missing issue cannot be located, or an issue is
found mutilated. In such cases, replacements must be ordered. As
</p>
<p>FIGURE 7.6. Sample Serial Binding Screen</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a rule, publishers do not print many extra issues, and therefore
most often the publisher is not a good source for getting back is-
sues. Some organizations and agents specialize in this kind of ser-
vice. The United States Book Exchange, or USBE, is one such or-
ganization, as previously mentioned. It is a clearinghouse for all
kinds of serials publications. Libraries join as members and send
their unwanted surplus and duplicates to the USBE. When a li-
brary finds a need for a specific issue, an order is sent for seven
dollars per issue, with the expectation that the serial is available
from the USBE&rsquo;s inventory of 13,000 titles. For more information
on the USBE and the titles that are available, check its Web site
&lt;www.usbe.org/&gt;. Other commercial sources are also available.
An Internet listserv called Backserv is a discussion group for serial
staffs interested in back issues, duplicates, exchanges lists, and re-
lated topics. Library technicians working in the serials department
can access this listserv and find more up-to-date information about
back issues of serials.
</p>
<p>Shelf Maintenance
</p>
<p>Except for large universities and special libraries that keep their
serial titles classified, libraries keep serials alphabetically by title
on the shelves. Depending on the local policy of the individual li-
brary, only the most current issues may be on the display shelves,
while back issues are housed in storage. Perhaps only more recent
back issues remain on display shelves together with the most cur-
rent ones. Shelf arrangement and maintenance should be conve-
nient, current, and in clear order.
</p>
<p>A serials holdings list, which includes titles and holding infor-
mation, either in printed form or online, is essential for library us-
ers and is the responsibility of serials staff.
</p>
<p>Libraries have special local policies and rules that dictate the
length of time certain titles are to be kept. For example, some titles
are kept for the most recent five years, while other titles may be
kept for two or three years only. If the library purchases microfilm
or microfiche for back issues, paper issues are discarded at certain
intervals or as the microfom is received. The serials staff&rsquo;s duties
encompass all responsibilities involved with keeping pertinent ma-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>terials and discarding out-of-date materials according to the li-
brary&rsquo;s policies.
</p>
<p>E-JOURNALS
</p>
<p>In library serials management, more and more literature is being
published about the management of e-journals. As many libraries
have acquired e-journals&mdash;and many more libraries will acquire
them in the near future&mdash;the management of e-journals has be-
come an important consideration.
</p>
<p>E-journal is the short form of electronic journal. These are the
journals or serial titles that can be accessed from computer data-
bases. Some are merely an online version of the print publication,
and the library may purchase the print version or the print version
together with the electronic version. Other titles are published
electronically only, thus the traditional serials control model can-
not be applied. E-journals started out in CD-ROM format and
later, with the emergence of the World Wide Web, progressed to
the online form, accessible through search engines designed for
that purpose. The number of titles has increased dramatically; in
1999, there were about 5,000 e-journals on the Web, most of them
scholarly publications.
</p>
<p>E-journals have completely changed the scene in serials con-
trol. The role of the vendor has changed. The traditional vendor
has become an aggregator. In the role of aggregator, vendors not
only accept orders for electronic journals from libraries, they also
provide proprietary search engines in order to assist the users, who
can then retrieve the needed articles from the Web, wherever the
article may reside. For example, OCLC offers an Electronic Col-
lections Online service, which enables the user, with one search of
the Web, to find information from a large collection of profes-
sional journals. Libraries subscribe to the journals directly from
the publisher or a vendor but can gain total access remotely at
OCLC. Another service is EBSCO online database, through which
over 1,200 electronic journals are made available for subscribers.
</p>
<p>Even though it is predicted that print journals will not disappear,
at least not in the foreseeable future, it is nevertheless recognized</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>that the number of electronic journals will steadily increase: the
e-journal provides timeliness, ease of access, and a convenient for-
mat integration into a multimedia presentation.
</p>
<p>The explosion of electronic serials has created an exciting
development for library technicians responsible for serials control.
Different ordering, cataloging, and processing procedures will
have to be instituted to cope with the changes brought about by
electronic journals. In the meantime, library technicians will be
participating in all aspects of serials control, from knowledge of
local policies and procedures in their own libraries to the big pic-
ture, which involves and coordinates computer and technology ad-
vances of the library world.

<p>Preservation
</p>
<p>A staggering volume of new information is continually being
added to libraries. At the same time, old books crumble, old movie
films become brittle, videotapes become fragile, computer disks
deteriorate and data is wiped out, and new technology requires the
abandonment of outdated hardware. Millions of books are deterio-
rating every day and, in fact, may be lost forever along with a large
part of our civilization. Although acquisition of new materials is
one goal every library strives to reach, preserving what is there
should also be an important mission&mdash;one that is often forgotten.
</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>book repair: Repairing damaged books in-house according to
specific procedures and using appropriate supplies.
</p>
<p>conservation: The act of physical and chemical treatment of li-
brary materials in order to retard their further deterioration; in
other words, the technical activities of repairing and restoring
damaged library materials.
</p>
<p>deacidification: The process of treating books printed on acidic
paper in order to make the books last for a longer period of time.
Books are immersed in an alkaline solvent to remove the acid and
to make the paper alkaline (or buffered).
</p>
<p>digital library: A collection of digitized materials stored in com-
puter databases. The originals may be books, articles, films, sound
recordings, or any other medium. The images of the originals are
scanned and converted to electronic data, and, together with a so-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>phisticated indexing system, the materials become accessible to
millions worldwide.
</p>
<p>disaster preparedness: A plan that deals with prevention and
damage reduction when disasters happen. The plan should include
immediate response activities, recovery or salvage procedures,
and treatment of damaged materials. It should also include infor-
mation on where to go for further directions and assistance.
</p>
<p>mass deacidification: A large number of books are usually put
through the process of deacidification together; therefore, the pro-
cess is referred to as mass deacidification.
</p>
<p>micrographic technology: Technology used to reformat materi-
als from paper-based originals to long-lasting microfilms. A state-
of-the-art camera used for this purpose delivers high resolution,
and the sophisticated optics and computer controlled exposures
ensure a high-quality product. It is the preferred method for per-
forming preservation microfilming.
</p>
<p>preservation: The maintenance of books and other library materi-
als to keep them as much as possible in their original condition.
This is done by instituting preventive measures to slow deteriora-
tion as well as applying appropriate treatments to the materials
themselves.
</p>
<p>preservation microfilming: Materials are filmed to produce high
quality 35mm microfilms, using micrographic technology. If stored
in optimal condition, microfilm can last for about 500 years and
therefore is considered the best reformatting medium for the pres-
ervation of library materials.
</p>
<p>PRESERVATION AND CONSERVATION
</p>
<p>What is targeted for preservation in a library? Because of the
high cost of preservation and the potential destruction of priceless
writings and irreplaceable resources, determining what is to be
preserved involves important decisions.
</p>
<p>The first factor to be considered is use. Policies and procedures
should be in place to identify, during circulation and shelving,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>damaged or deteriorated materials. Because frequently used mate-
rials are obviously those that are necessary and popular with the li-
brary&rsquo;s users, they become the first target for preservation.
</p>
<p>The value of the material is another factor in determining
whether material should undergo conservation treatment. Because
conservation treatment is more expensive than replacement, every
effort should be made to preserve important contents through re-
placement first, even in a different format. A library should exam-
ine its own mission in relation to its preservation policy. For exam-
ple, a research library is expected to preserve all of its material for
historical and research purposes. It is also essential for a research
library to preserve original copies for scholars and to show authen-
ticity of a document. On the other hand, in a small- or medium-
sized public library or a community college library, the main mis-
sion is to circulate current materials to its users, and under such
circumstances, even though there are always some valuable mate-
rials that must be conserved, most worn-out or out-of-date materi-
als can be discarded. In addition, the differences between a li-
brary&rsquo;s support for local needs or its role within a consortium
versus its regional or national responsibilities should be recog-
nized and considered in the preservation decision. Works that any
library will keep permanently include local authors&rsquo; works, local
imprints, manuscripts, and archives.
</p>
<p>THE PROBLEM OF DETERIORATION
</p>
<p>The deterioration of a library&rsquo;s collection remains a problem as
many elements contribute to the deterioration process.
</p>
<p>Environmental Factors
</p>
<p>What contributes to shortening the lives of library materials?
What natural conditions put library materials in danger of physical
deterioration? Natural enemies include heat, fire, moisture, light,
pollutants, pests, insects, rodents, mold or mildew, and water.
Steps that can be taken include temperature and humidity control;
disaster preparedness; and protection against fire, water, dust, and
dirt.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Harvard University, for example, has moved fragile materials
out of the library and put them into a storage facility that provides
an optimal preservation environment for its collection.
</p>
<p>Chemical Factors
</p>
<p>A large number of books printed from the beginning of the nine-
teenth century to the present are printed on acidic paper, which has
a tendency to become brittle within fifty years. Recently, more
books are printed on alkaline paper, which will reduce the pace of
deterioration.
</p>
<p>Air pollution is another factor that damages library materials.
Particulate material can dirty and abrade paper, and common gas-
eous pollutants combine with atmospheric moisture to produce
acids that corrupt paper.
</p>
<p>Physical Factors
</p>
<p>The human enemies of library materials include rough routine
handling, improper shelving methods, food and drink contact that
damages the materials, incorrect repair that shortens the life of the
materials, using a book drop, and photocopying.
</p>
<p>PRESERVATION EXPERTS AND ORGANIZATIONS
</p>
<p>Library staff and archivists are charged with the responsibility
of preserving materials and, when necessary, conserving them.
Several professional organizations exist that are ready to offer
consultation and assistance.
</p>
<p>The Northeast Document Conservation Center in Andover, Mas-
sachusetts, was established as a nonprofit organization for the sole
purpose of conserving paper and related materials. The Center of-
fers the following:
</p>
<p>1. Conservation services: Treatment of books and pages, resto-
ration of original bindings, replacement of bindings too dam-
aged to repair</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. Microfilming services: Microfilming of manuscripts, scrap-
books, brittle newspaper, and fragile books, including archi-
val storage or master negatives
</p>
<p>3. Photographic copying services: Duplicating historical pho-
tographs or preserving through microfilm, microfiche, or
contact prints
</p>
<p>4. Field services: Provide on-site review of collections, provide
condition surveys, offer workshops on preservation and con-
servation, and offer emergency service through its disaster
assistance program
</p>
<p>Useful technical leaflets on all aspects of preservation works are
also published by the Northeast Document Conservation Center
and made available to libraries. One of its publications, the third
edition of Preservation of Library and Archival Materials: A Man-
ual can be accessed from its Web site at &lt;http://www.nedcc.org&gt;.
</p>
<p>Preservation Resources is a division of the Online Computer Li-
brary Center (OCLC). It provides a full range of services to meet
the preservation needs of libraries and other institutions. Services
include consultation, workshops, microfilming, film duplication,
polysulfiding treatment, digital scanning or microfilming, and in-
dexing. For more information on Preservation Resources, check
its Web site at &lt;www.oclc.org/oclc/presres/about.htm&gt;.
</p>
<p>The American Library Association and state libraries, state mu-
seums, and state historical societies usually have in-house conser-
vators or offer referral services that will guide libraries to find spe-
cialists who can be of assistance.
</p>
<p>PREVENTIVE MEASURES
</p>
<p>Environment Factors Control
</p>
<p>Although experts disagree on the optimal temperature for book
storage, it is safe to keep the temperature in library storage lower
than 70 F. The suggested humidity range is 35 to 55 percent. Be-
cause fluctuation causes damage, the temperature and humidity
should be kept constant. A minimal level of light, an air-condition-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ing system, and an air-filtering system to prevent air pollution are
environmental conditions that contribute to preservation.
</p>
<p>Good Housekeeping Practices
</p>
<p>Cleanliness and barring food from the library help eliminate
problems such as cockroaches, rodents, and other pests. Library
staff should be aware and monitor the collection periodically for
mildew and mold, and apply proper treatment if it is discovered. A
security system deters vandalism and theft.
</p>
<p>Proper Physical Treatment
</p>
<p>Proper treatment of books is easily accomplished and inexpen-
sive yet too often overlooked. Many practices should become a
habit of the library staff who handle the materials daily. The public
must be educated about the hazards of mishandling library materi-
als. Shelving books tightly causes damage to the spine upon re-
moval from the shelf. Pulling a book from the shelf by using one
finger to tilt the top of the book causes spine damage. Books that
are kept straight or completely flat with a good bookend survive
longer. An edge copying feature for library photocopying ma-
chines protects the spines of books. Air space at the back of book
shelves, regular dusting, and attention to cleanliness with no food
or drink allowed are simple but effective measures.
</p>
<p>TREATMENTS FOR DAMAGED MATERIALS
</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, the needs of the community, and the
local policy of a library, decisions must be made regarding whether
the damaged material is worth keeping, and, if so, what treatment
should be applied.
</p>
<p>1. Discard. If the content of the damaged material is no longer
needed or is readily available under some other titles, discarding
allows more space and eliminates redundancy.
</p>
<p>2. Book repair. Improper repair may cause more damage to
books in the long run. Library technicians must learn the proper
methods of repairing library materials. For example, for mending</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>tears and damaged spines, proper treatment with Japanese paper
and starch paste are required.
</p>
<p>Supplies used for repair are available through commercial suppli-
ers such as Archival Products &lt;www.archival.com/&gt;, University
Products &lt;www.universityproducts.com&gt;, Brodart &lt;www.brodart.
com/&gt;, and Gaylord Bros. &lt;gaylord.com&gt;. Some useful booklets are
also available from these companies. For example, Brodart&rsquo;s Sim-
plified Book Repair, Gaylord&rsquo;s An Introduction to Book Repair and
Simple Techniques for the Maintenance and Repair of Books pres-
ent step-by-step instructions with illustrations for book repairers to
follow. A Simple Book Repair Manual contains information on book
repair and is available from the Web site of the Dartmouth College Li-
brary at &lt;www.dartmouth.edu/~preserve/tofc.html&gt;.
</p>
<p>3. Binding. For worn-out copies or books with loose spines, or
to extend the lives of new paperbacks, books are bound either in-
house or sent to a commercial bindery.
</p>
<p>4. Replacement. If the worn-out or damaged material is com-
mercially available, the most cost-effective means is to buy a re-
placement copy.
</p>
<p>5. Photocopying. A single missing page, a mutilated page, or an
entire book can be photocopied on alkaline paper and bound into
book form.
</p>
<p>6. Preservation microfilming. The intellectual content, if not the
format of a brittle book, will be preserved if the item is micro-
filmed by taking a photographic image of the original and greatly
reducing its size. Unlike regular microfilming, preservation mi-
crofilming is done only on silver-halide microfilm, allowing the
film to remain readable virtually forever if the film is kept under
optimal storage conditions. Preservation microfilming is consid-
ered the preferred method for reformatting unstable originals,
such as brittle books, photographs, papers, and objects. It is inex-
pensive, easy to reproduce, and has a proven and verifiable stan-
dard for longevity. Materials are sent to preservation organiza-
tions, such as Northeast Document Conservation Center or OCLC&rsquo;s
Preservation Resources, for microfilming, or their technicians will
come to film the materials on site. The technology used for preser-
vation microfilming is called micrographic technology.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7. Optical disk reproduction. Optical disk technology was con-
sidered an attractive medium for storage of information, primarily
because of the disk&rsquo;s enormous storage capacity. It is an efficient
medium as far as accessibility is concerned, however, data re-
corded on magnetic tape are prone to corruption and sometimes are
totally erased. Furthermore, this technology is so new that its dura-
bility has not been proven.
</p>
<p>Digital information becomes unreadable when hardware is up-
dated or changed, and when operating procedures and software
programs become obsolete. For preservation purposes, every time
hardware is changed, all information needs to be copied and saved
in the new format. With extensive amounts of information and data
on the World Wide Web now, copying can become an unmanage-
able task. More on digitalization will be discussed in this chapter
under the Digital Projects section.
</p>
<p>8. Mass deacidification. Deacidification is a chemical treatment
to stabilize acidic paper to prevent embrittlement and, ultimately,
to prolong the life of a book. This is a preventive measure for
which books are treated before they become brittle. The method
impregnates books with magnesium oxide, which both neutralizes
the acid in the paper and leaves an alkaline buffer behind, thus re-
tarding the deterioration process. The deacidification process ex-
tends the durability of books for three to five times their original
lives. When a large number of books are treated together, the pro-
cess is called mass deacidification.
</p>
<p>DIGITAL PROJECTS
</p>
<p>Digital imaging and scanning technologies have been available
for over twenty years. During that time, many digital library con-
version projects have occurred. The process of converting digital
images begins with the scanning of pages using sensitive scanning
equipment, then the conversion of the information from pages to
electronic data takes place, and, finally, storing the data in the
computer completes the process. Yale University has launched
Project Open Book, which has digitized 10,000 volumes on mi-
crofilm. The Library of Congress has a National Digital Library</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>program where selected collections have been put into digital for-
mat accessible to readers worldwide. Digital images include those
taken from original documents, books, microform images, and pic-
torial materials. They are available on the American Memory Web
site at &lt;http://memory.loc.gov/&gt;.
</p>
<p>Digital materials have many limitations. One is that the technol-
ogies are not standardized. The hardware and software must be
compatible for one system to be able to communicate with an-
other. Digital imaging technology is expensive and labor inten-
sive. Besides the original costs, funding must be reserved for sys-
tem upgrades, the addition of storage capacity, and data migration,
which is transferring data from one storage medium to another
when the technology advances. If migration is not possible when
technological obsolescence happens, the data becomes inaccessi-
ble and therefore lost. Whether emulation, which enables different
systems to communicate with each other, can be relied on for pres-
ervation is still unproven and cannot be used with confidence.
Even if technology remains the same, digital materials are not ex-
pected to have a life span of over ten years. For materials published
online only, such as e-journal articles, ironically, the preservation
technique suggested by the experts is printing the material on acid-
free paper. For more information on digital preservation, see the
Council on Library and Information Resources&rsquo; Web site at
&lt;www.clir.org/&gt;. The last problem to consider is with the vast
amount of information available on Internet Web sites. Absolutely
no guarantee exists that the Web site that is there today will be
there tomorrow. The problem of preservation of such materials
and of optical media such as DVD and CD-ROM, which cannot be
easily reformatated for preservation, is extremely complex.
</p>
<p>For materials that will be preserved in their original format, a
digital reproduction can be made to broaden accessibility, result-
ing in lessened use of the originals, which will protect the originals
from being damaged and prolong their lives. Not a substitute or a
replacement, but rather a surrogate, digital reproduction contrib-
utes to the preservation program, allowing for universal copying,
distribution, and access.</p>

<p>DISASTER PREPAREDNESS
</p>
<p>Disasters may happen at any time. Thousands of libraries have
been damaged or destroyed by natural or man-made disasters. Di-
sasters include flood, earthquake, fire, or leaky pipes. Some disas-
ters may be avoided with proper planning and appropriate building
maintenance. Even for unpreventable disasters, such as earth-
quakes or floods, libraries should have a disaster plan in place that
articulates the library staff&rsquo;s responsibilities and what emergency
steps must be followed.
</p>
<p>A good disaster plan includes the following information:
</p>
<p>Prevention and protection strategies
A list of telephone numbers for library administrators and
emergency services
A list of emergency supplies kept in the library
A list of commercial companies to order supplies
A library floor plan indicating all water and electrical con-
nections and locations of fire alarms and fire extinguishers
Procedures and priorities to follow in the event disaster
strikes
A list of people and organizations that can provide assis-
tance and services
</p>
<p>Several disaster plans planning guides are available on the
World Wide Web. OCLC Preservation Resources &lt;www.oclc.org/

ford.edu&gt; are good examples. These are useful resources that can
be adapted when formulating a disaster plan for any library. The
ALCTS section of the American Library Association Web site has
also created a Disaster Preparedness Clearinghouse at &lt;www.ala.

<p>Water Damage
</p>
<p>Water damage may result because of a flood, a pipe leak, or
plumbing problem. For water-damaged books and other materials,
according to the leaflet published by the Northeast Document</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Conservation Center Drying Wet Books and Records (Technical
Leaflet Handout 10 Emergency Management), five drying methods
can be used. Following is a brief explanation of these methods. For
more information, consult the leaflet and other reference materials.
</p>
<p>1. Air drying: Air drying is best used for treating a few damp or
slightly wet books and documents. The drying room must
have temperature and humidity as low as possible. Fans
should be used to keep the air moving. Single leaves of re-
cords can be laid out on tables, floors, and other flat surfaces,
protected by paper towels or clean, unprinted newsprint.
Coated paper must be separated. Interleave every few pages
of books with paper towels or unprinted newsprint. Books
should be completely dry before being returned to the shelves,
and dried records should be put in clean folders and boxes.
</p>
<p>2. Dehumidification: For damp or moderately wet books, this is
the method that is most easily applied. Books and records are
left in place, and large, powerful, commercial dehumidifiers
are brought in. Together with controlled temperature and hu-
midity, the dehumidifiers can dry the collection without the
labor-intensive work of moving the collection or handling
each individual volume.
</p>
<p>3. Freezer drying: Materials are placed in a freezer as soon as
possible after becoming wet. The very low temperature (be-
low -10 F) will reduce distortion of the material and facilitate
the drying process.
</p>
<p>4. Vacuum thermal drying: Used for a collection that is water
damaged extensively. Materials are put in a vacuum thermal
drying chamber and dried as vacuuming and heating occur at
the same time. Large amounts of materials can be dried at the
same time, making it cost effective, but the result is less satis-
fying than other methods.
</p>
<p>5. Vacuum freeze drying: Used for large numbers of very wet
books, records, and coated papers. Although the cost is high,
it yields the most satisfactory results. Wet books and records
are frozen first, then put in a very sophisticated vacuum
chamber to be vacuum-dried while still frozen. This method
causes the least distortion of wet materials.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>All methods of drying may be used successfully to different de-
grees of preservation, but that does not mean that materials can be
restored to their original condition. In fact, once wet, books cannot
be returned to original condition.
</p>
<p>Fire Damage
</p>
<p>A fire detection device and an automatic water sprinkler protec-
tion system are necessary parts of library building safety and
maintenance. Regular inspections of the electric systems is also a
must. A fire evacuation plan, which shows a clear and orderly
evacuation route for both users and staff, is essential.
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION
</p>
<p>Preservation is an important yet often neglected component of
technical services. Preservation awareness must be made a conspic-
uous element of everyday library operations and integrated into all
library activities. Library technicians working in the preservation
area should learn the skills of book repair and other specific tech-
niques used for in-house conservation. For detailed instructions,
several titles listed in the Suggested Readings section of this book
are good resources. Some Web sites also provide useful informa-
tion. A collection of information on conservation, covering a wide
spectrum of topics of interest, can be found at &lt;http://palimp-
sest.stanford.edu/&gt;, titled Conservation OnLine (CoOL), which is a
project of the Preservation Department at Stanford University. The
Library of Congress has a FAQ (frequently asked questions) sec-
tion on its Web site &lt;http://www.loc.gov/faq/&gt; dedicated to pre-
serving library materials. Finally, Yale University Libraries Web
site &lt;www.library.yale.edu/preservation/progserv.htm&gt; is a source
of information on preservation as well.

<p>Chapter 9
</p>
<p>Trends and Issues
</p>
<p>TRENDS
</p>
<p>For the past hundred years, libraries have evolved from being
repositories of printed materials to providing all kinds of services
involving materials of all types, including audiovisual materials,
optical disks, such as DVD, CD-ROM, and online materials. The
methods used for the management, organization, and distribution
of information in libraries have changed also, and technical ser-
vices departments have been the centers and the catalysts for those
changes. Trends that are apparent can be summarized as follows.
</p>
<p>1. Jobs performed in the technical services department have
changed. Automation in the acquisitions and cataloging depart-
ments has streamlined operations, changing the nature of the jobs,
making them more mechanical, refined, and precise and involving
less decision making and judgment calls.
</p>
<p>2. It is important for library staff to have computer skills as they
are involved in working with a variety of systems on a daily basis
and may be called upon to design and implement the online sys-
tems they use. Even job titles have included descriptive terms such
as technology, metadata, system, etc.
</p>
<p>3. The blurring of roles between librarians and library techni-
cians has occurred. Automation and the use of bibliographic utili-
ties have made it possible for most libraries to copy catalog, shift-
ing the cataloging responsibilities from librarians doing original
cataloging to library technicians doing copy cataloging.
</p>
<p>4. Overlapping activities have occurred among library depart-
ments. Because the same database is used for all functions includ-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ing acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation, one department is
usually assigned the task for maintaining the database, thus blurring
the distinctions between library technical services and public ser-
vices. Circulation, traditionally a public services function, is no
longer only stamping or scanning books being borrowed by the
public. It involves storage, maintenance, and retrieval of biblio-
graphic data and increasingly is considered part of technical ser-
vices. In the meantime, the acquisitions unit is broadening into
collection development, and management has merged with the
public services department, while the ordering function of the ac-
quisitions department has been assumed by the cataloging staff.
</p>
<p>5. More and more electronic resources will be collected by librar-
ies. Cataloging rules will be modified to suit the electronic environ-
ment, or different rules, such as the Dublin Core, will be adopted
universally for cataloging electronic materials. Library collections
will include e-books, e-journals, and Internet resources.
</p>
<p>6. The standard cataloger&rsquo;s workstation will be a PC equipped
with all the necessary tools for easy access, such as the cataloging
rules and bibliographic utilities. Internet resource links will be
added to library&rsquo;s home page. Most tasks will be done on the Web.
</p>
<p>7. Many libraries outsource at least part of the technical services
operation, such as cataloging and processing or special projects
such as foreign languages cataloging, to commercial companies or
network services providers for more efficient and less costly ser-
vices. Some libraries outsource all of technical services or even
the whole library operation.
</p>
<p>8. Networks and consortia, with shared cataloging, will provide
Web access, and more libraries will join as members, thereby
eliminating costly repetitive cataloging. Libraries will continue to
be involved in other types of joint projects, such as cooperative
storage and preservation activities, to cut cost and at the same time
offer the best possible services to users.
</p>
<p>ISSUES
</p>
<p>With the advancement of technology and the emergence of
the Web, the operation of libraries has changed tremendously in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the past decade. Issues have evolved that will need to be addressed
by the library field, including the following.
</p>
<p>1. Dissatisfaction of library technicians is growing because of
low pay and inferior status as their work becomes increasingly
more demanding and professionally oriented. For library techni-
cians, there is no established career ladder and no educational re-
quirement; there is not even a uniform title. Yet library technicians
are required to do the work of librarians in the technical services
department.
</p>
<p>2. There is a lack of educational programs to train future library
technicians and to provide continuing educational opportunities
for current library technicians. Because technology changes con-
stantly, continuous training and enhancement of skills in the inte-
grated system and in the use of computers, in a Windows or NT en-
vironment, are critical. Keeping up with changes in technology and
information sources is the most challenging aspect of working in
the technical services department.
</p>
<p>3. No universal consensus has been reached on cataloging elec-
tronic materials. Should a library catalog only those items physi-
cally located in the library or all the items that library users have
access to? Should rules in Dublin Core be followed?
</p>
<p>4. In an online environment, accuracy and quality control be-
come more important than ever. A small mistake may cause bib-
liographic records to be incorrect, inaccurate, misfiled, lost, or in-
accessible.
</p>
<p>5. Preservation of electronic data is an increasingly troubling is-
sue. E-journals and Web sites may or may not be retained by their
originators. Hardware upgrades often render data saved in older
formats unreadable, and the long-term stability of the electronic
medium has not been tested.
</p>
<p>In the contemporary library environment, especially in the tech-
nical services area, library technicians have become an increas-
ingly important component. With automation and networking,
much in the traditional library operation has changed; however,
the role of technical services remains the same as it always has
been&mdash;that of developing, organizing, preserving, and distributing
library materials for library users.</p>
