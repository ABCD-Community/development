<p>Graduate Texts in Physics
</p>
<p>Graduate Texts in Physics publishes core learning/teaching material for graduate- and
advanced-level undergraduate courses on topics of current and emerging fields within
physics, both pure and applied. These textbooks serve students at the MS- or PhD-level and
their instructors as comprehensive sources of principles, definitions, derivations, experi-
ments and applications (as relevant) for their mastery and teaching, respectively. Interna-
tional in scope and relevance, the textbooks correspond to course syllabi sufficiently to serve
as required reading. Their didactic style, comprehensiveness and coverage of fundamental
material also make them suitable as introductions or references for scientists entering, or
requiring timely knowledge of, a research field.

<p>Foreword
</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is undergoing a revolution. Not that its substance is changing,
</p>
<p>but major developments are placing it in the focus of renewed attention, both
</p>
<p>within the physics community and among the scientifically interested public. First,
</p>
<p>wonderfully clever table-top experiments involving the manipulation of single
</p>
<p>photons, atomic particles and molecules are revealing in an ever-more convincing
</p>
<p>manner theoretically predicted facts about the counterintuitive and sometimes
</p>
<p>&ldquo;spooky&rdquo; behavior of quantum systems and have led to a renewed interest in the
</p>
<p>formulation of a strictly physics-based (non-philosophical) foundation of quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. Second, the prospect of building quantum computers with enormously
</p>
<p>increased capacity of information-processing is developing great interest and high
</p>
<p>hopes in the engineering and computer science communities. Third, condensed
</p>
<p>matter physics and nanotechnology are narrowing down the gap between classical
</p>
<p>and quantum domains in the practical realm. These developments demand more
</p>
<p>and better training in quantum mechanics at the universities, with emphasis on a
</p>
<p>clear and solid understanding of the subject. Cookbook-style learning of quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics, in which equations and methods for their solution are memorized rather
</p>
<p>than understood, may help the students to solve some standard problems and pass
</p>
<p>multiple-choice tests, but it will not enable them to break new ground in real
</p>
<p>life as physicists. On the other hand, some &ldquo;Mickey Mouse courses&rdquo; on quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics for engineers, biologists and computer analysts may give an idea of what
</p>
<p>this discipline is about, but too often the student ends up with an incorrect picture or,
</p>
<p>at best, a bunch of uncritical, blind beliefs in linear algebra wizardry. The present
</p>
<p>book represents a fresh start toward helping achieve a deep understanding of the
</p>
<p>subject. It presents the material with utmost rigor and will require ironclad, old-
</p>
<p>fashioned discipline from the students in their study.
</p>
<p>Too frequently, in today&rsquo;s universities, we hear the demand that the courses
</p>
<p>offered be &ldquo;entertaining,&rdquo; in response to which some departmental brochures declare
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;physics is fun&rdquo;! Studying physics requires many hours of hard work, deep
</p>
<p>concentration, long discussions with buddies, periodic consultation with faculty,
</p>
<p>and tough self-discipline. But it can, and should, become a passion: the passion
</p>
<p>to achieve a deep understanding of how Nature works. This understanding usually
</p>
<p>vii</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>viii Foreword
</p>
<p>comes in discrete steps, and students will experience such a step-wise mode of
</p>
<p>progress as they work their way diligently through the present book. The satisfaction
</p>
<p>of having successfully mastered each step will then indeed feel very rewarding!
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;amount of information per unit surface&rdquo; of text is very high in this book &ndash;
</p>
<p>its pages cover all the important aspects of present-day quantum mechanics, from
</p>
<p>the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator to teleportation. Starting from a few basic
</p>
<p>principles and concentrating on the fundamental behavior of quantum systems
</p>
<p>(particles) with only a few degrees of freedom (low-dimension Hilbert space) allows
</p>
<p>the author to plunge right into the core of quantum mechanics. It also makes it
</p>
<p>possible to introduce first the Heisenberg matrix approach &ndash; in my opinion, a
</p>
<p>pedagogically rewarding method that helps sharpen the mental and mathematical
</p>
<p>tools needed in this discipline right at the beginning. For instance, solving the
</p>
<p>quantization of the harmonic oscillator without the recourse of a differential
</p>
<p>equation is illuminating and teaches dexterity in handling the vector and matrix
</p>
<p>representation of states and operators, respectively.
</p>
<p>Daniel Bes is a child of the Copenhagen school. Honed in one of the cradles of
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics by Åge Bohr, son of the great master, and by Ben Mottelson,
</p>
<p>he developed an unusually acute understanding of the subject, which after years of
</p>
<p>maturing he now has projected into a book &ndash; now in its third edition. The emphasis
</p>
<p>given throughout the text to the fundamental role and meaning of the measurement
</p>
<p>process will help the student overcome the initial reaction to the counterintuitive
</p>
<p>aspects of quantum mechanics and better comprehend the physical meaning and
</p>
<p>properties of Schrödinger&rsquo;s wave function. The human brain is an eminently
</p>
<p>classical system (albeit the most complex one in the Universe as we know it), whose
</p>
<p>phylo- and ontogenetic evolution are driven by classical interactions between organ-
</p>
<p>ism and the environment, and which processes pragmatic information, definable
</p>
<p>only in the classical domain. It is therefore only natural that when this classical brain
</p>
<p>looks into the microscopic domain, using human-designed instruments which must
</p>
<p>translate quantum happenings into classical, microscopically observable effects,
</p>
<p>strange things with unfamiliar behavior may appear in our mental images! And it is
</p>
<p>only natural that, thus, the observer&rsquo;s way of thinking and instruments should not be
</p>
<p>left completely outside the fundamental framework of quantum physics! Bes&rsquo; book
</p>
<p>helps to recognize, understand and accept quantum &ldquo;paradoxes&rdquo; not as such but as
</p>
<p>the facts of &ldquo;Nature under human observation.&rdquo; Once this acceptance has settled in
</p>
<p>the mind, the student will have developed a true intuition or, as the author likes to
</p>
<p>call it, a &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; for quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>Chapter 2 contains the real foundation on which quantum mechanics is built;
</p>
<p>it thus deserves, in my opinion, repeated readings &ndash; not just at the beginning
</p>
<p>but after each subsequent chapter. With the exception of the discussion of two
</p>
<p>additional principles, the rest of the book describes the mathematical formulations
</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics (both the Heisenberg matrix mechanics, most suitable for
</p>
<p>the treatment of low-dimension state vectors, and Schrödinger&rsquo;s wave mechanics
</p>
<p>for continuous variables) as well as many up-to-date applications. The examples
</p>
<p>cover a wide variety of topics, from the simple harmonic oscillator mentioned
</p>
<p>above to subjects in condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, electrodynamics and</p>

</p>
<p>quantum computing. It is interesting to note, regarding the latter, that the concept of
</p>
<p>qubit appears in a most natural way in the middle of the book, almost in passing,
</p>
<p>well before the essence of quantum computing is discussed towards the end. Of
</p>
<p>particular help are the carefully thought-out problems at the end of each chapter, as
</p>
<p>well as the occasional listings of &ldquo;common misconceptions.&rdquo; A most welcome touch
</p>
<p>is the inclusion of a final chapter on the history of theoretical quantum mechanics &ndash;
</p>
<p>indeed, it is regrettable that so little attention is given to it in university physics
</p>
<p>curricula: much additional understanding can be gained from learning how ideas
</p>
<p>have matured (or failed) during the historical development of a given discipline!
</p>
<p>Let me conclude with a personal note. I have known Daniel Bes for almost
</p>
<p>70 years. As a matter of fact, I had known of him even before we met in person:
</p>
<p>our fathers were &ldquo;commuter&ndash;train acquaintances&rdquo; in Buenos Aires, and both served
</p>
<p>on the PTA of the primary school that Daniel and I attended (in different grades).
</p>
<p>Daniel and I were physics students at the University of Buenos Aires (again,
</p>
<p>at different levels), then on the physics faculty, and years later, visiting staff
</p>
<p>members of Los Alamos National Laboratory. We always were friends, but we never
</p>
<p>worked together &ndash; Daniel was a theoretician almost from the beginning, whereas
</p>
<p>I started as a cosmic-ray and elementary-particle experimentalist (see Fig. 2.7).
</p>
<p>Interestingly, reading the first edition of this book has motivated me a few years
</p>
<p>ago to expand my current interest in foundations of information theory and work
</p>
<p>towards developing yet another interpretation of quantum mechanics (which I call
</p>
<p>&ldquo;information-based&rdquo;)!
</p>
<p>It gives me a particular pleasure that after so many decades and despite residing
</p>
<p>at opposite ends of the American continent, we have become professionally
</p>
<p>&ldquo;entangled&rdquo; through this wonderful textbook!

<p>Preface to the Third Edition
</p>
<p>The preparation of another edition of a text on quantum mechanics is always a
</p>
<p>challenge. On the one hand, one may decide to cover some previously omitted
</p>
<p>topics, after gauging again their relevance. On the other hand, the fast evolution
</p>
<p>of the subject implies the need to incorporate not only new experimental facts
</p>
<p>and theoretical developments but also new concepts in the description of nature.
</p>
<p>Therefore, self-imposed constraints about the overall length of the book become
</p>
<p>strained. This is a good motivation for a revision. As a consequence, few items have
</p>
<p>been omitted and many more included, even some which are usually not discussed
</p>
<p>in introductory texts (like the breakdown of symmetries).
</p>
<p>The book consists of two main parts. The first one displays the following
</p>
<p>organization:
</p>
<p>� As in the previous editions, the basic principles of quantum mechanics are
introduced within the framework of Hilbert spaces. Their empirical consequences
</p>
<p>(both thought and real experiments) and theoretical implications (uncertainty
</p>
<p>relations, no-cloning theorem) are discussed.
</p>
<p>� The Heisenberg matrix realization of the basic principles allows us to solve the
two-state system, the harmonic oscillator and a combination of the two, the
</p>
<p>Jaynes&ndash;Cummings model. The Schrödinger realization covers conventional sub-
</p>
<p>jects, including both bound and scattering examples. The contrast between these
</p>
<p>two realizations underscores the appearance of the most important quantum
</p>
<p>observable, the spin.
</p>
<p>� The description of many-body systems requires the distinction between fermions
and bosons and the indistinguishability among each of the two types of particles.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of these two features, there appears another formulation of
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics, the so-called second quantization.
</p>
<p>Most of the many-body examples that are presented &ndash; in fact, most of the
</p>
<p>many-body systems existing in nature &ndash; are treated within the framework of
</p>
<p>independent degrees of freedom. This is true both for fermion cases (atoms,
</p>
<p>nuclei, molecules, metals, band structures in crystals, etc.) and for boson systems
</p>
<p>xi</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xii Preface to the Third Edition
</p>
<p>(Bose&ndash;Einstein condensates). One explicit exception is outlined (fractional Hall
</p>
<p>effect).
</p>
<p>� Perturbation theory makes it possible to improve over-simplified approximations.
Hartree&ndash;Fock procedures allow us to optimize these zero-order descriptions.
</p>
<p>The Born&ndash;Oppenheimer approximation is an essential tool in the treatment of
</p>
<p>molecules.
</p>
<p>� The time principle. Time evolutions are calculated both exactly (spin systems)
and perturbatively. The main motivation for the creation of quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>was to explain the stability of electron orbits in atomic hydrogen. Therefore,
</p>
<p>a brief introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics is presented so that this
</p>
<p>formalism can then be used to verify the extent to which this explanation has
</p>
<p>been accomplished by the formalism.
</p>
<p>� Symmetry properties under transformations (translations, rotations, parity,
exchange, etc.) are essential tools to obtain solutions to problems displaying
</p>
<p>such symmetries. However, the descriptions of many relevant systems involve
</p>
<p>the breaking of some symmetries, as exemplified by the BCS theory of
</p>
<p>superconductivity. The restoration of such symmetries is made through the
</p>
<p>introduction of collective variables.
</p>
<p>� Our everyday life has been altered in an essential way through technologies based
on quantum properties, the most conspicuous cases being the transistor and the
</p>
<p>laser. Quantum dots, scanning tunneling microscope, magnetic resonance imag-
</p>
<p>ing and Josephson junctions are also described in the corresponding chapters.
</p>
<p>� Eigenstates of the position operators are normalized through the introduction of
the Dirac delta function. They lead to the notion of propagators and to the path-
</p>
<p>integral formulation of quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>The second part of the text is based on the concept of entanglement, which is
</p>
<p>the superposition principle applied to two or more systems. The following items are
</p>
<p>included:
</p>
<p>� Even more counterintuitive consequences of quantum mechanics appear in exper-
iments involving the entanglement of two particles. Technological improvements
</p>
<p>have allowed the experimental verifications of such consequences.
</p>
<p>� The EPR paper (1935) pointed at inconsistencies between experiments involving
two entangled particles separated by superluminal distances, the locality princi-
</p>
<p>ple and the predictions of quantum mechanics. These inconsistencies lead to the
</p>
<p>introduction of additional hidden mechanisms. In 1964, J. Bell proved that any
</p>
<p>local mechanism implied correlations that were violated by quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>Experiments verified the quantum predictions. Nature is non-local.
</p>
<p>� Quantum information theory concerns the possible use of quantum superposi-
tions inherent to quantum bits (qubits), which carry much more information than
</p>
<p>classical bits. This program has succeeded in problems concerning cryptography
</p>
<p>and teleportation. However, it is presently stalling on problems of quantum
</p>
<p>computation, due to the inherent fragility of superposed states, which are
</p>
<p>destroyed through interactions with the environment (decoherence).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Preface to the Third Edition xiii
</p>
<p>� Decoherence also allows us to explain the coexistence of microsystems described
by quantum mechanics and macrosystems obeying Newton&rsquo;s laws. In fact,
</p>
<p>macrosystems emerge from the quantum substrate as a consequence of inter-
</p>
<p>actions with the environment. A new interpretation of quantum measurements
</p>
<p>appears within a consistent scheme.
</p>
<p>Finally, a brief history of quantum mechanics is presented. Quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>emerges as an animated subject under permanent, albeit discontinuous, evolution.

<p>Excerpts from the Preface to the First Edition
</p>
<p>This text follows the tradition of starting an exposition of quantum mechanics with
</p>
<p>the presentation of the basic principles. This approach is logically pleasing and it is
</p>
<p>easy for students to comprehend. Paul Dirac, Richard Feynman and, more recently,
</p>
<p>Julian Schwinger have all written texts which are epitomes of this approach.
</p>
<p>This approach also pays dividends through the natural appearance of the most
</p>
<p>quantum of all operators: the spin. In addition to its intrinsic conceptual value, spin
</p>
<p>allows us to simplify discussions on fundamental quantum phenomena like interfer-
</p>
<p>ence and entanglement, on time dependence (as in nuclear magnetic resonance) and
</p>
<p>on applications of quantum mechanics in the field of quantum information.
</p>
<p>Any presentation of material from many different branches of physics requires
</p>
<p>the assistance of experts in the respective fields. I am most indebted to my colleagues
</p>
<p>and friends Ben Bayman, Horacio Ceva, Osvaldo Civitarese, Roberto Liotta, Juan
</p>
<p>Pablo Paz, Alberto Pignotti, Juan Roederer, Marcos Saraceno, Norberto Scoccola
</p>
<p>and Guillermo Zemba for corrections and/or suggestions. However, none of the
</p>
<p>remaining mistakes can be attributed to them.
</p>
<p>My training as a physicist owes very much to Åge Bohr and Ben Mottelson of
</p>
<p>Niels Bohr Institutet and NORDITA (Copenhagen). During the 1950s Niels Bohr,
</p>
<p>in his long-standing tradition of receiving visitors from all over the world, used
</p>
<p>his institute as an open place where physicists from East and West could work
</p>
<p>together and understand each other. From 1956 to 1959, I was there as a young
</p>
<p>representative of the South. My wife and I met Margrethe and Niels Bohr at their
</p>
<p>home in Carlsberg. I remember gathering there with other visitors listening to Bohr&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>profound and humorous conversation. He was a kind of father figure, complete with
</p>
<p>a pipe that would go out innumerable times while he was talking. Years later I
</p>
<p>became a frequent visitor to the Danish institute, but after 1962 Bohr was no longer
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>My wife Gladys carried the greatest burden while I was writing this book. It
</p>
<p>must have been difficult to be married to a man who was mentally absent for the
</p>
<p>better part of almost 2 years. I owe her much more than a mere acknowledgment,
</p>
<p>because she never gave up in her attempts to change this situation (as she never did
</p>
<p>on many other occasions in our life together). My three sons, David, Martin and

</p>
<p>many hours sitting in front of the monitor. He does not care about Schrödinger&rsquo;s

<p>Chapter 1
</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>The construction of classical physics started at the beginning of the seventeenth
</p>
<p>century. By the end of the nineteenth century, the building appeared to have been
</p>
<p>completed: the mechanics of Galileo Galilei and of Isaac Newton, the electromag-
</p>
<p>netism of Michael Faraday and James Maxwell, and the thermodynamics of Ludwig
</p>
<p>Boltzmann and Hermann Helmholtz were by then well established, from both the
</p>
<p>theoretical and the experimental points of view. The edifice was truly completed
</p>
<p>when Albert Einstein developed the special and the general theories of relativity, in
</p>
<p>the early twentieth century.
</p>
<p>Classical physics deals with the trajectory of particles (falling bodies, motion
</p>
<p>of planets around the sun) or with the propagation of waves (light waves, sound
</p>
<p>waves). The construction of this edifice required intuition to be abandoned in favor
</p>
<p>of a formalism, i.e., a precise treatment that predicts the evolution of the world
</p>
<p>through mathematical equations. Classical physics has a deterministic character.
</p>
<p>The existence of a physical reality, independent of the observer, is an implicitly
</p>
<p>accepted dogma.
</p>
<p>Cracks in this conception appeared around the beginning of the last century. Light
</p>
<p>waves not only appeared to be absorbed and emitted in lumps (black-body radiation)
</p>
<p>[2], but turned out to behave completely like particles (photoelectric and Compton
</p>
<p>effects [3, 4]). Experiments with electrons displayed diffraction patterns that had
</p>
<p>up to then been seen as characteristic of waves [5]. However, the most disturbing
</p>
<p>discovery was that an atom consists of a positively charged, small, heavy nucleus,
</p>
<p>surrounded by negatively charged light electrons [6]. According to classical physics,
</p>
<p>matter should collapse in a fraction of a second. Nor was it understood why atoms
</p>
<p>emitted light of certain wavelengths only, similar to an organ pipe that produces
</p>
<p>sounds at certain well-defined frequencies [7].
</p>
<p>In 1913 Niels Bohr was able to explain both the stability of the hydrogen atom
</p>
<p>and the existence of discrete energy levels by means of a partial rejection of classical
</p>
<p>mechanics and electromagnetism [8]. However, this model was largely a patch.
</p>
<p>Bohr himself assumed the role of leader in the quest for an adequate formalism.
</p>
<p>In 1925 Werner Heisenberg alone [9] and, subsequently, in collaboration with
</p>
<p>Max Born and Pascual Jordan [10] developed a quantum mechanical formalism

<p>2 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>in which the classical variables of position and momentum were represented by
</p>
<p>(non-commuting) matrices. Also in 1925, Dirac introduced the idea that physical
</p>
<p>quantities are represented by operators (of which Heisenberg&rsquo;s matrices are just one
</p>
<p>representation) and physical states by vectors in abstract Hilbert spaces [11]. In 1926
</p>
<p>Erwin Schrödinger produced the differential formalism of quantum mechanics, an
</p>
<p>alternative approach based on the differential equations that bear his name [12].
</p>
<p>Since the presentation of the Heisenberg and Schrödinger formulations1 is at least
</p>
<p>twice as difficult as the introduction of a single one, a relatively large number of un-
</p>
<p>dergraduate quantum mechanics textbooks confine themselves to a discussion of the
</p>
<p>Schrödinger realization. The present author contends that such a presentation of
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is conceptually misleading, since it leads to the impression that
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is another branch of classical wave physics. It is not. Let me
</p>
<p>quote Schwinger&rsquo;s opinion [14].
</p>
<p>I have never thought that this simple wave approach [de Broglie waves and the Schrödinger
</p>
<p>equation] was acceptable as a general basis for the whole subject.
</p>
<p>This approach of presenting both Heisenberg and Schrödinger formulations
</p>
<p>also pays dividends through the natural appearance of the most quantum of all
</p>
<p>operators: the spin. In addition to its intrinsic conceptual value, spin allows us
</p>
<p>to simplify discussions on fundamental quantum phenomena like interference and
</p>
<p>entanglement, on time dependence (as in nuclear magnetic resonance), and on
</p>
<p>applications of quantum mechanics in the field of quantum information.
</p>
<p>The uncertainty of a presentation may be reduced by increasing the amount of
</p>
<p>detail, and vice versa. Bohr used to say that accuracy and clarity were complemen-
</p>
<p>tary concepts (Sect. 15.5.1). Thus, a short and clear statement can never be precise.
</p>
<p>We may go further and state that the product of the indeterminacy inherent in any
</p>
<p>message (&#129;&nbsp;) times the amount of details (&#129;�) is always larger or equal than a
</p>
<p>constant k (&#129;&nbsp; � &#129;� &gt; k). The quality of textbooks should be measured by how
close this product is to k, rather than by their (isolated) clarity or completeness. It
</p>
<p>is up to the reader to judge how closely we have been able to approach the value k.
</p>
<p>If we have achieved our aim, a more rigorous and sufficiently simple presentation
</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics will be available to undergraduate and first-year graduate
</p>
<p>students.
</p>
<p>This book should be accessible to students who are reasonably proficient in linear
</p>
<p>algebra, calculus, classical mechanics and electromagnetism. Previous exposure to
</p>
<p>other mathematical and/or physics courses constitutes an advantage, but it is by no
</p>
<p>means a sine qua non.
</p>
<p>1There also exist other formulations of quantum mechanics. All of them yield the same result for
</p>
<p>the same problem, but one of them may be easier to apply or may provide a better insight in a
</p>
<p>given situation. The list of quantum formalisms includes the path-integral (Feynman), phase space
</p>
<p>(Wigner), density matrix, second quantization, variational, pilot wave (Bohm) and the Hamilton&ndash;
</p>
<p>Jacobi formulations [13]. In the present text the second quantization formalism is presented in
</p>
<p>Sect. 7.8&#142;, the density matrix in Sect. 14.4 and the path integral in Sect. 11.3&#142; .</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Introduction 3
</p>
<p>The reader will be confronted in Chap. 2 with a condensed presentation of
</p>
<p>Hilbert spaces and Hermitian and unitary operators. This early presentation implies
</p>
<p>the risk that the reader might receive the (erroneous) impression that the book is
</p>
<p>mathematically oriented, and/or that he or she will be taught mathematics instead
</p>
<p>of physics. However, Sects. 2.7* and 2.8* include practically all the mathematical
</p>
<p>tools that are used in the text (outside of elementary linear algebra and calculus,
</p>
<p>both being prerequisites). Consistent with this &ldquo;physics&rdquo; approach, the results
</p>
<p>are generally starkly presented, with few detailed derivations. It is the author&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>contention that these derivations do not significantly contribute to filling the gap
</p>
<p>between merely recognizing quantum mechanical expressions and learning how
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;do&rdquo; and &ldquo;feel&rdquo; quantum mechanics. This last process is greatly facilitated by
</p>
<p>solving the problems at the end of each chapter (with answers provided at the end of
</p>
<p>the book). The instructor should act as an &ldquo;answerer&rdquo; and &ldquo;motivator&rdquo; of students&rsquo;
</p>
<p>questions and not merely as a &ldquo;problem solver on the blackboard,&rdquo; to facilitate the
</p>
<p>filling of the aforementioned gap.
</p>
<p>Sections labeled by a dagger display a somewhat more advanced degree of
</p>
<p>difficulty. The student may leave them for a second reading, unless he or she
</p>
<p>is specially interested on the subject. An asterisk indicates the mathematical
</p>
<p>background of material that has been previously presented.
</p>
<p>Although the text has been conceived as a whole unit, it also allows for different
</p>
<p>shorter readings:
</p>
<p>&bull; If the aim is to operate with the formalism within some particular branch of
</p>
<p>microphysics (solid state, molecular, atomic, nuclear, etc.), one can progress
</p>
<p>straightforwardly from Chap. 2 to Chap. 9, probably leaving Chaps. 10 and 11
</p>
<p>for a second reading.
</p>
<p>&bull; Readers more interested in recent advances on quantum theory and on applica-
</p>
<p>tions to quantum information may skip Chaps. 7, 8, 10, and 11, to get to Chaps.
</p>
<p>12&ndash;14 (concerning entanglement and its consequences).
</p>
<p>&bull; A reading with more emphasis on conceptual aspects of quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>should proceed through Chaps. 2&ndash;7, 9, 11, 12 and 14.
</p>
<p>A brief history of quantum mechanics is presented to acquaint the newcomer with
</p>
<p>the development of one of the most spectacular adventures of the human mind to
</p>
<p>date (Chap. 15). It also intends to convey the feeling that, far from being finished,
</p>
<p>this enterprise is continuously being updated.</p>

</p>
<p>The Principles of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>This introduction describes the mathematical tools used in the formulation of quan-
</p>
<p>tum mechanics and the connections between the physical world and mathematical
</p>
<p>formalism. Such links constitute the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.1
</p>
<p>They are valid for every specific realization of these principles. Subsequently, their
</p>
<p>most immediate consequences are presented. Frequent shortcomings existing in
</p>
<p>many introductions can thus be avoided.2
</p>
<p>2.1 Classical Physics
</p>
<p>If our vision of a moving object is interrupted by a large billboard and is resumed
</p>
<p>after the reappearance of the object, we naturally assume that it has traveled all the
</p>
<p>way behind the billboard (Fig. 2.1). This is implied in the notion of physical reality,
</p>
<p>one of the postulates in the famous EPR paradox written by Einstein in collaboration
</p>
<p>with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen [16]: &ldquo;If, without in any way disturbing a
</p>
<p>system, we can predict with certainty the value of a physical quantity, then there is
</p>
<p>an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>This classical framework relies on the acceptance of some preconceptions, most
</p>
<p>notably the existence of the continuous functions of time called trajectories x.t/ [or
</p>
<p>x.t/ and p.t/, where p is the momentum of the particle]. A trajectory describes the
</p>
<p>1Presentations of quantum mechanics resting upon few basic principles start with [15], which
</p>
<p>remains a cornerstone on the subject.
2In many presentations it is assumed that the solution of any wave equation for a free particle is the
</p>
<p>plane wave exp[i.kx�!t/]. Subsequently, the operators corresponding to momentum and energy
are manipulated to obtain an equation yielding the plane wave as the solution. This procedure
</p>
<p>is not very satisfactory because (a) plane waves display some difficulties as wave functions, not
</p>
<p>being square integrable; (b) quantum mechanics appears to be based on arguments that are only
</p>
<p>valid within a differential formulation; (c) it leads to the misconception that the position wave
</p>
<p>function is the only way to describe quantum states.

<p>6 2 The Principles of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.1 The trajectory of the car behind the billboard as an element of physical reality
</p>
<p>motion of a point particle, an abstract concept that does not exist in nature. The
</p>
<p>concept of trajectory provides an important link between the physical world and its
</p>
<p>mathematical description. For instance, it allows us to formulate Newton&rsquo;s second
</p>
<p>law,
</p>
<p>F.x/ D M d
2 x
</p>
<p>d t2
: (2.1)
</p>
<p>This equation of motion predicts the evolution of the system in a continuous and
</p>
<p>deterministic way. Since this is a second order equation, the state of a system is
</p>
<p>specified if the position and the momentum of each particle are known at any one
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s theory of electromagnetism is also part of classical physics. It is
</p>
<p>characterized in terms of fields, which must be specified at every point in space and
</p>
<p>time. Unlike particles, fields can be made as small as desired. Electromagnetism is
</p>
<p>also a deterministic theory.
</p>
<p>Essential assumptions in classical physics about both particles and fields are:
</p>
<p>&bull; The possibility of non-disturbing measurements
</p>
<p>&bull; There is no limit to the accuracy of the values assigned to physical properties
</p>
<p>In fact, there is no distinction between physical properties and the numerical
</p>
<p>values they assume. Schwinger characterizes classical physics as &ldquo;the idealiza-
</p>
<p>tion of non-disturbing measurements and the corresponding foundations of the
</p>
<p>mathematical representation, the consequent identification of physical properties
</p>
<p>with numbers, because nothing stands in the way of the continual assignment of
</p>
<p>numerical values to these physical properties&rdquo; [14], p. 11.
</p>
<p>Such &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; assumptions are no longer valid in quantum mechanics. There-
</p>
<p>fore, other links have to be created between the physical world and mathematical
</p>
<p>formalism.
</p>
<p>2.2 Mathematical Framework of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>According to classical electromagnetism, an inhomogeneous magnetic field B
</p>
<p>directed along an axis (for instance, the z-axis) should bend the trajectory of particles
</p>
<p>perpendicular to this axis. The amount of bending of these tiny magnets will be
</p>
<p>proportional to the projection�z of their magnetic moment�. Therefore, if the beam
</p>
<p>is unpolarized (all values .�j�j � �z � j�j/ are present), particles are classically
expected to impact over a continuous region of a screen. However, it was shown in
</p>
<p>1921 by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach that silver atoms distribute themselves over</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Mathematical Framework of Quantum Mechanics 7
</p>
<p>each of two lines. Since the magnetic moment is proportional to an intrinsic angular
</p>
<p>momentum called spin (�/ S), it is apparent that only two projections of the spin
are allowed by nature [17] (for more details see Sect. 5.2.1).
</p>
<p>Note, however, that the fact that a physical quantity may have only two values
</p>
<p>does not require by itself to abandon classical physics. For instance, your PC is
</p>
<p>made up from bits, i.e. classical systems that may be in one of two states.3 As befits
</p>
<p>classical systems, their state is not altered upon measurement (thus contributing to
</p>
<p>the stability of classical computers).
</p>
<p>A different description is provided by vectors on a plane. While the sum of the
</p>
<p>two states of a bit does not make sense, the addition of two vectors on a plane
</p>
<p>is always another vector. Any vector &permil; may be written as a linear combination
</p>
<p>(Fig. 2.2, top)
</p>
<p>&permil; D cxϕx C cyϕy ; (2.2)
</p>
<p>where cx ; cy are amplitudes and ϕx,ϕy are two perpendicular vectors of module one.
This last property is expressed as hϕi jϕj i D ıij , which is a particular case of the
scalar product
</p>
<p>h&permil;j&permil;0i D c�x c0x C c�y c0y : (2.3)
In quantum mechanics we allow complex values of the amplitudes. Thus, the
</p>
<p>definition of normalized vectors becomes
</p>
<p>h&permil;j&permil;i D jcxj2 C jcy j2 D 1 : (2.4)
</p>
<p>Another crucial property of the chosen vector space is that the same vector &permil; may
</p>
<p>be expressed as a combination of other sets of perpendicular vectors χx , χy along
rotated axes (Fig. 2.2, bottom)
</p>
<p>&permil; D bxχx C byχy ;
</p>
<p>1 D jbxj2 C jby j2 : (2.5)
</p>
<p>This two-dimensional space may be easily generalized to spaces with any number
</p>
<p>of dimensions, called Hilbert spaces. Here we outline some properties that are
</p>
<p>specially relevant from the point of view of quantum mechanics. This overview
</p>
<p>is expanded in Sect. 2.7*.
</p>
<p>&bull; As in (2.2), any vector &permil; may be expressed as a linear combination of
</p>
<p>orthonormal basis states ϕi :
</p>
<p>&permil; D

<p>2.3 Basic Principles of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>In this section we present the quantum mechanical relation between the physical
</p>
<p>world and the mathematical tools that have been outlined in the previous section.
</p>
<p>It is formulated through the following quantum principles:
</p>
<p>4The symbols jai and haj have been called by Dirac ket and bra, respectively [15].</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 2 The Principles of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Principle 1. The state of the system5 is completely described by a vector &permil; &ndash; the
</p>
<p>state vector or state function &ndash; belonging to a Hilbert space.
</p>
<p>The state vector&permil; constitutes an unprecedented way of describing nature. It is an
</p>
<p>abstract entity that carries information about the results of possible measurements.
</p>
<p>It replaces the classical concepts of position and momentum in the description of
</p>
<p>physical systems.
</p>
<p>The state vector may be multiplied by an arbitrary complex constant and
</p>
<p>still represent the same physical state. Even if we enforce the requirement of
</p>
<p>normalization, an arbitrary overall phase is left, which has no physical significance.
</p>
<p>This is not the case for the relative phase of the terms in the sum ca&permil;a C cb&permil;b ,
which encodes important physical information.
</p>
<p>The fact that the sum of two state vectors is another state vector belonging to
</p>
<p>the same Hilbert space, i.e. describing another state of the system, is usually called
</p>
<p>the superposition principle. The sum ca&permil;a C cb&permil;b must not be interpreted in the
sense that we have a conglomerate of systems in which some of them are in the
</p>
<p>state &permil;a and some in the state &permil;b , but rather that the system is simultaneously in
</p>
<p>both component states. This statement is also valid when the system is reduced to a
</p>
<p>single particle.
</p>
<p>The weirdness of quantum mechanics can be traced back to this superposition. It
</p>
<p>is fundamentally different from any property of classical particles, which are never
</p>
<p>found as a linear combination of states associated with different trajectories: a tossed
</p>
<p>coin may fall as a head or a tail, but not as a superposition of both.
</p>
<p>By establishing that the state vector completely describes the state of the system,
</p>
<p>Principle 1 assumes that there is no way of obtaining information about the system,
</p>
<p>unless this information is already present in the state vector.
</p>
<p>The state vector may only concern some degree(s) of freedom of the physical
</p>
<p>system, such as position and momentum of a particle and the spin.
</p>
<p>The relation between the physical world and states &permil; is more subtle than the
</p>
<p>classical relation with position and momentum x;p. It relies on principles 2 and 3.
</p>
<p>Principle 2. To every physical quantity there corresponds a single linear operator.
</p>
<p>In particular, the operators Ox and Op, corresponding to the coordinate and momen-
tum of a particle, fulfil the commutation relation
</p>
<p>Œ Ox; Op&#141; D i&bdquo; ; (2.15)
</p>
<p>The commutator is defined in (2.8) and &bdquo; is Planck&rsquo;s constant h divided by 2�
(Table A.1).6 The constant &bdquo; provides an estimate of the domain in which quantum
</p>
<p>5This notion of the state of a system is close to the one appearing in classical thermodynamics. It
</p>
<p>is applied there to many-body systems in which the path of the constituents cannot be traced in
</p>
<p>practice (for instance, molecules in a gas). However, in quantum mechanics the concept of state is
</p>
<p>applied even in the case of a single particle.
6This commutation relation is related to the classical Poisson bracket (Sect. 2.6.3). It has been
</p>
<p>derived from relativistic invariance [18], using the fact that spatial translations [generated by Op,
see (4.10)] do not commute with Lorentz transformations even in the limit c ! 1.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.3 Basic Principles of Quantum Mechanics 11
</p>
<p>mechanics becomes relevant. It has the dimensions of classical action (energy �
time). Classical physics should be applicable to systems in which the action is much
</p>
<p>larger than &bdquo;.
This is also fundamentally different from classical physics, for which physical
</p>
<p>properties are identified with (commuting) numbers (Sect. 2.1).
</p>
<p>Since any classical physical quantity may be expressed as a function of coordi-
</p>
<p>nate and momentum (Q D Q.x; p/), the replacement x ! Ox and p ! Op in the
classical expression Q.x; p/ yields the operator OQ D Q. Ox; Op/. The requirement of
hermiticity is usually sufficient to account for the non-commutativity of operators
</p>
<p>[for instance, xp $ 1
2
. Ox Op C Op Ox/]. Thus, a one-to-one correspondence between
</p>
<p>physical quantities or observables Q and operators OQ is established. However,
there are also purely quantum operators, such as the spin operators, that cannot
</p>
<p>be obtained through such substitution.
</p>
<p>The operator corresponding to the classical Hamilton function H.p; x/ is called
</p>
<p>the Hamiltonian. For a conservative system
</p>
<p>OH D 1
2M
Op2 C V. Ox/ ; (2.16)
</p>
<p>where M is the mass of the particle and V is the potential.
</p>
<p>Principle 3. The eigenvalues qi of an operator OQ constitute the possible results
of the measurements of the physical quantity Q. The probability7 of obtaining the
</p>
<p>eigenvalue qi is the modulus squared jci j2 of the amplitude of the eigenvector ϕi in
the state vector &permil; representing the state of the system.
</p>
<p>Since the results of measurements are real numbers, the operators representing
</p>
<p>physical observables are restricted to be Hermitian (2.12) and (2.53). In particular,
</p>
<p>the possible values of the energy Ei are obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation
</p>
<p>OH ϕi D Ei ϕi : (2.17)
</p>
<p>As in the case of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics may be applied to
</p>
<p>very different systems, from single-particle and many-body systems to fields. Thus,
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics constitutes a framework in which to develop physical theories,
</p>
<p>rather than a physical theory by itself. A number of simple, typical, well-known
</p>
<p>problems of a particle moving in a one-dimensional space are discussed in Chaps. 3
</p>
<p>and 4.
</p>
<p>It is almost as useful to state what the principles do not mean, as to say what they
</p>
<p>do mean. In the following we list some common misconceptions regarding quantum
</p>
<p>states [19]:
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;The state vector is similar to other fields present in the physical world.&rdquo; It is
</p>
<p>fundamentally different from the electric or magnetic fields in electromagnetic
</p>
<p>7Notions of probability theory are given in Sect. 2.8*.</p>
<p/>

<p>12 2 The Principles of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>waves, which carry momentum, energy, etc., and in which any externally caused
</p>
<p>change propagates at a finite, medium-dependent speed. The state vector does
</p>
<p>not interact with particles.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Energy eigenstates are the only allowed ones.&rdquo; This misconception probably
</p>
<p>arises from the generalized emphasis on the solution of the eigenvalue equation
</p>
<p>(2.17) and from its similarity to the correct statement &ldquo;Energy eigenvalues are
</p>
<p>the only allowed energies.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;A state vector describes an ensemble of classical systems.&rdquo; In the standard
</p>
<p>Copenhagen interpretation, the state vector describes a single system.8 In none
</p>
<p>of the acceptable statistical interpretations is the ensemble classical.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;A state vector describes a single system averaged over some amount of time.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The state vector describes a single system at a single instant.
</p>
<p>The above three principles are sufficient for the treatment of static situations
</p>
<p>involving a single particle. Two more principles, concerning many-body systems
</p>
<p>and the time-evolution of states, are presented in Chaps. 7 and 9, respectively.
</p>
<p>2.4 Measurement Process
</p>
<p>2.4.1 The Concept of Measurement
</p>
<p>In this section we specify some basic concepts involved in the process of measure-
</p>
<p>ment.9
</p>
<p>Two or more systems are in interaction if the presence of one leads to changes
</p>
<p>in the other, and vice versa. Different initial conditions generally lead to different
</p>
<p>changes, although this may not always be the case.
</p>
<p>A measurement is a process in which a system is put in interaction with a piece
</p>
<p>of apparatus. The apparatus determines the physical quantity or observable to be
</p>
<p>measured (length, weight, etc.).
</p>
<p>There are two important steps in a measurement. The first is the preparation of the
</p>
<p>system to be measured, i.e. the determination of the initial state. Bohr&rsquo;s definition
</p>
<p>of the word &ldquo;phenomenon&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;an observation obtained under specified
</p>
<p>circumstances, including an account of the whole experimental arrangement&rdquo;
</p>
<p>[21], p. 64. This should be contrasted with the EPR definition of physical reality
</p>
<p>(Sect. 2.1).
</p>
<p>The second important step, also crucial in the case of quantum systems, is a
</p>
<p>(macroscopic) change in the apparatus that should be perceptible by a cognitive
</p>
<p>system. In many cases this change is produced by a detector at one end of the
</p>

<p>Fig. 2.3 The change in the state vector due to the measurement
</p>
<p>apparatus. The magnitude of the physical quantity has a value if the change can
</p>
<p>be represented in numerical form.
</p>
<p>For some systems the interaction with the apparatus does not produce a change
</p>
<p>in the system or produces a change which is completely determined. This is the case
</p>
<p>of classical systems (see Sect. 2.1). Our deeply ingrained notion of classical reality
</p>
<p>has emerged as a consequence of the fact that many independent observers may
</p>
<p>carry out measurements on the same system without disturbing it (and agree upon
</p>
<p>the results). On the contrary, this can only be exceptionally achieved in quantum
</p>
<p>measurements, where a change of the system is generally associated with a change
</p>
<p>of the apparatus (see Sect. 2.4.2).
</p>
<p>2.4.2 Quantum Measurements
</p>
<p>The most fundamental difference between a classical and a quantum system is
</p>
<p>that the latter cannot be measured without being irrevocably altered, no matter
</p>
<p>how refined the measuring instruments are. This is a consequence of the principles
</p>
<p>presented in Sect. 2.3.
</p>
<p>Assume that the measurement of the physical quantity Q, performed on a system
</p>
<p>in the state &permil; expanded as in (2.6), yields the result qj . If the same measurement
</p>
<p>is repeated immediately afterwards, the same value qj should be obtained with
</p>
<p>certainty. Thus, the measurement has changed the previous value of the coefficients
</p>
<p>ci ! ci D ıij . In other words, as a result of the measurement, the system &ldquo;jumps&rdquo;
to an eigenstate of the physical quantity that is being measured (the reduction of the
</p>
<p>state vector). The only exceptions occur when the initial state is already represented
</p>
<p>by one of the eigenvectors.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14 2 The Principles of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Given an initial state vector &permil;, we do not know in general to which eigenstate
</p>
<p>the system will jump. Only the probabilities, represented by jci j2, are determined
(Fig. 2.3). This identification of the probabilities is consistent with the following
</p>
<p>facts:
</p>
<p>&bull; Their value is always positive.
</p>
<p>&bull; Their sum is 1 (if the state &permil; is normalized).
</p>
<p>&bull; The orthogonality requirement (2.7) ensures that the probability of obtaining
</p>
<p>any eigenvalue qj &curren; qi vanishes, if the system is initially represented by an
eigenstate ϕi (see Table 2.1).
</p>
<p>The fact that, given a state vector &permil;, we can only predict the probability
</p>
<p>jci j2 of obtaining eigenvalues qi constitutes an indeterminacy inherent to quantum
mechanics. Our knowledge about the system cannot be improved, for instance,
</p>
<p>through a second measurement, since the state &permil; has been transformed into ϕi . The
coefficients ci are also called probability amplitudes. The concept of probability
</p>
<p>implies that we must consider a large number of measurements performed on
</p>
<p>identical systems, all of them prepared in the same initial state &permil;.
</p>
<p>If in the expansion (2.6) there is a subset of basis states ϕk with the same
eigenvalue qk D q, the probability of obtaining this eigenvalue is
</p>
<p>P
</p>
<p>k jckj2. The
system is projected after the measurement into the (normalized) state

</p>
<p>without further discussion. This has been, historically, the path followed by most
</p>
<p>physicists. However, we present one more discussion of the measurement problem
</p>
<p>in Chap. 14.
</p>
<p>The diagonal matrix element is also called the expectation value or mean value of
</p>
<p>the operator OQ. It is given by the sum of the eigenvalues weighted by the probability
of obtaining them

</p>
<p>We have postulated the existence of links between the physical world and math-
</p>
<p>ematics that are different from those characterizing classical physics. In quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics, physical quantities are related to (non-commuting) operators; the state
</p>
<p>vectors are constructed through operations with these mathematical entities; the
</p>
<p>feedback to the physical world is made by measurements that yield, as possible
</p>
<p>results, the eigenvalues of the corresponding operators. An example of this two-way
</p>
<p>connection between formalism and the physical world is the following: assume that
</p>
<p>the system is constructed in a certain physical state, to which the state vector &permil; is
</p>
<p>assigned. This assignment is tested by means of various probes, i.e. measurements
</p>
<p>of observables Q, for which we may know the eigenvector ϕi and, therefore, the
probability jhi j&permil;ij2 of obtaining the eigenvalues qi .
</p>
<p>This two-way relation between physical world and formalism is not an easy
</p>
<p>relation [22]:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most difficult part of learning quantum mechanics is to get a good feeling for
</p>
<p>how the abstract formalism can be applied to actual phenomena in the laboratory. Such
</p>
<p>applications almost invariably involve formulating oversimplified abstract models of the real
</p>
<p>phenomena, to which the quantum formalism can effectively be applied. The best physicists
</p>
<p>have an extraordinary intuition for what features of the actual phenomena are essential and
</p>
<p>must be represented in the abstract model, and what features are inessential and can be
</p>
<p>ignored. &rdquo;
</p>
<p>2.5 Some Experimental Consequences of the Basic Principles
</p>
<p>2.5.1 Thought Experiments
</p>
<p>This section displays some consequences of quantum principles in the form of
</p>
<p>thought experiments. Alternatively, one may obtain the quantum principles as a
</p>
<p>generalization of the results of such thought experiments (see [23]).
</p>
<p>Let us consider a Hilbert space consisting of only two independent states ϕ˙.
We also assume that these states are eigenstates of an operator OS corresponding
to the eigenvalues ˙1, respectively. Thus the eigenvalue equation OSϕ˙ D ˙ϕ˙
is satisfied. The scalar products hϕCjϕCi D hϕ�jϕ�i D 1 and hϕCjϕ�i D 0 are
verified. There are many examples of physical observables that may be represented
</p>
<p>by such operator. For instance, the z-component of the spin10 is frequently used in
</p>
<p>these notes (Sects. 2.2, 3.2, 5.2, 9.2, etc.).
</p>
<p>10Another example is given by the polarization states of the photon (see Sect. 9.8.2&#142;). Most of the
</p>
<p>two-state experiments are realized by means of such optical devices.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16 2 The Principles of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>We start by constructing a filter, i.e. an apparatus such that the exiting particles
</p>
<p>are in a definite eigenstate. In the first part of the apparatus, a beam of particles is
</p>
<p>split into the two separate ϕ˙ beams, as in the experiment of Stern and Gerlach
(Sect. 5.2.1). In the second part, each beam is pushed towards the original direction.
</p>
<p>Each separate beam may be masked off at the half-way point. Such an apparatus is
</p>
<p>sketched in Fig. 2.4a with the ϕ� beam masked off. It will be called a ϕ-filter. It is
enclosed within a box drawn with continuous lines.
</p>
<p>Any experiment requires first the preparation of the system in some definite initial
</p>
<p>state. Particles leave the oven in unknown linear combinations &permil; of ϕ˙ states
</p>
<p>&permil; D hϕCj&permil;iϕC C hϕ�j&permil;iϕ� : (2.22)
</p>
<p>They are collimated and move along the y-axis. In the following cases, we prepare
</p>
<p>the particles in the filtered state ϕC, by preventing particles in the state ϕ� from
leaving the first filter (Fig. 2.4b). In the last stage of the experimental set-up we
</p>
<p>insert another filter as part of the detector, to measure the degree of filtration. The
</p>
<p>detector includes also a photographic plate which records the arriving particles and
</p>
<p>is observed by an experimentalist (Fig. 2.4c).
</p>
<p>In the first experiment, we place the detector immediately after the first filter
</p>
<p>(Fig. 2.4d). If the ϕ� channel is also blocked in the detector, every particle goes
through; if the channel ϕC is blocked, nothing passes. The amplitudes for these
processes are hϕCjϕCi D 1 and hϕ�jϕCi D 0, respectively. The corresponding
probabilities, jhϕCjϕCij2 and jhϕ�jϕCij2, also are 1 and 0.
</p>
<p>We now consider another set of basis states χ˙, also satisfying the orthonormality
conditions hχCjχCi D hχ�jχ�i D 1, hχCjχ�i D 0 (Fig. 2.2, bottom). It is easy to
verify that an operator OR, satisfying the eigenvalue equation OR χ˙ D ˙χ˙, does not
commute with OS . Let us perform the necessary modifications of the detector filter
so that it can block the particles in either of the states χ˙. If OR corresponds the spin
component in the x-direction, the required modification of the detector amounts to
</p>
<p>a rotation of its filter by an angle �=2 around the y-axis. Dashed boxes represent
</p>
<p>filters such that particles exit in the χ˙ states (χ-type filters) (Fig. 2.4e).
A particle exiting the first filter in the state ϕC reorients itself, by chance, within
</p>
<p>the second filter. This process is expressed within the formalism by expanding the
</p>
<p>states ϕ˙ in terms of the new basis set
</p>
<p>ϕ˙ D hχCjϕ˙iχC C hχ�jϕ˙iχ� : (2.23)
</p>
<p>According to Principle 3, a particle emerging from the first filter in the state ϕC will
either emerge from the detector filter in the state χC with probability jhχCjϕCij2
or in the state χ� with probability jhχ�jϕCij2. If the χ� channel of the second
filter is blocked, the particle is either projected into the state χC or is absorbed
with probability 1 � jhϕCjχCij2 = jhϕCjχ�ij2. This result sounds classical: it is
the quantum version of the classical Malus law. However, the projection process is
</p>
<p>probabilistic. Any information about the previous orientation ϕC is lost.</p>

<p>Sect. 2.3. (a) Schematic representation of a filter; (b) preparation of the state of a particle; (c)
</p>
<p>detector (filter, photoplate, observer); (d)&ndash;(g) experiments (see text). The vertical bars denote fixed
</p>
<p>path blockings, while the diagonal bars indicate paths that can be either opened or closed. For each
</p>
<p>experiment we perform a measurement in which the upper channel of the detector is open and the
</p>
<p>down channel blocked, and another measurement with opposite features
</p>
<p>We now perform two other experiments which yield results that are spectacularly
</p>
<p>different from classical expectations. Let us restore the detector filter to the ϕ-type
and introduce a filter of the χ-type between the first filter and the detector (Fig. 2.4f).
Thus, particles prepared in the ϕC state exit the second filter in the χC state. In the
spin example, particles leave the first filter with the spin pointing in the direction
</p>
<p>of the positive z-axis, and the second filter pointing along the positive x-axis. The
</p>
<p>detector measures the number of particles exiting in one of the ϕ˙ states (spin</p>

<p>pointing up or down in the z-direction). We use now the inverse expansion11 of
</p>
<p>(2.23), namely
</p>
<p>χ˙ D hϕCjχ˙iϕC C hϕ�jχ˙iϕ� : (2.24)
</p>
<p>Thus, the total amplitudes for particles emerging in one of the states ϕ˙ are
12:
</p>
<p>hϕCjχCihχCjϕCi; (2.25)
hϕ�jχCihχCjϕCi : (2.26)
</p>
<p>Both components ϕ˙ may emerge from the detector filter, in spite of the fact
that the fraction of the beam in the ϕ� state was annihilated inside the first filter.
There is no way in classical physics to explain the reconstruction of the beam
</p>
<p>ϕ�. This example illustrates the quantum rule concerning the impossibility of
determining two observables associated with operators which do not commute: a
</p>
<p>precise determination of R destroys the previous information concerning S .
</p>
<p>The result of this experiment is also consistent with Principle 1 in Sect. 2.3,
</p>
<p>since the state vector χC contains all possible information about the system: its past
history is not relevant for what happens to it next. The information is lost because
</p>
<p>of the blocking mask that has been put inside the second filter.
</p>
<p>If we repeat the last experiment, but remove the mask from the second filter
</p>
<p>(Fig. 2.4g), the total amplitude is given by the sum of the amplitudes associated
</p>
<p>with the two possible intermediate states
</p>
<p>hϕCjχCihχCjϕCi C hϕCjχ�ihχ�jϕCi D hϕCjϕCi D 1; (2.27)
hϕ�jχCihχCjϕCi C hϕ�jχ�ihχ�jϕCi D hϕ�jϕCi D 0 ; (2.28)
</p>
<p>where the closure property has been applied (2.59). All the particles get through in
</p>
<p>the first case; none in the second case. In going from amplitude (2.26) to (2.28) we
</p>
<p>get fewer particles, despite the fact that more channels are opened.
</p>
<p>It is important that none of the intermediate beams suffers an additional
</p>
<p>disturbance (for example, the influence of an electric field), which may change the
</p>
<p>relative phases of the two channels.
</p>
<p>The result of this last experiment is equivalent to an interference pattern.
</p>
<p>Classically, such patterns are associated with waves. However, unlike the case of
</p>
<p>waves, the particles are always detected as lumps of the same size on a screen placed
</p>
<p>in front of the exit side of the detector filter. No fractions of a lump are ever detected,
</p>
<p>as befits the behavior of indivisible particles. Therefore, these experiments display
</p>
<p>wave&ndash;particle duality, which is thus accounted for by Principles 1&ndash;3.
</p>
<p>11The amplitudes in (2.23) and (2.24) are related by hϕCjχ˙i D hχ˙1jϕCi� and hϕ�jχ˙i D
hχ˙1jϕ�i�, according to Table 2.1.

</p>
<p>in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality,
</p>
<p>it contains the only14 mystery.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>2.5.2 Real Two-Slit Experiments
</p>
<p>Thought experiments played a crucial role in the clarification of controversial
</p>
<p>aspects of quantum mechanics. The discussions between Bohr and Einstein are
</p>
<p>paradigmatic in this respect (Sect. 15.5.2). However, since the end of the twentieth
</p>
<p>century, real experiments have replaced thought ones. Not only have earlier views
</p>
<p>been confirmed, but also more counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics have
</p>
<p>been brought into focus.
</p>
<p>Since Thomas Young established the wave nature of light in 1801 (using candles
</p>
<p>as sources of light), two-slit interference experiments have become crucial to decide
</p>
<p>between wave and particle behavior (Fig. 2.5).
</p>
<p>The usual experimental set-up consists of a source emitting particles and three
</p>
<p>screens placed on their path. The first screen displays a hole used to collimate the
</p>
<p>beam. The second one is pierced by two narrow slits placed within the aperture of the
</p>
<p>beam. The third screen is paved by detectors recording the impact of the particles.
</p>
<p>The slits in the intermediate screen define two distinct paths for the particles.
</p>
<p>Each particle crosses this screen in a linear superposition of two states

</p>
<p>the final spot for any one particle (only the fringes where no particle will impinge

</p>
<p>a pattern of equidistant fringes with a high density of impacts can be seen at the
</p>
<p>detection screen.
</p>
<p>In a relatively recent version (1988), neutrons of de Broglie wavelength 2 nm
</p>
<p>(4.34) impinge on two slits 22
m and 23
m wide, respectively, separated by a
</p>
<p>distance of 104
m. The main results of this experiment are [24]:
</p>
<p>&bull; A diffraction pattern indicating the existence of a wave interference phenomenon
</p>
<p>(Fig. 2.6). The observation plane was located at a distance of 5 m from the
</p>
<p>slits to insure a resolution of �100
m. The solid line represents first-principle
predictions from quantum mechanics, including all features of the experimental
</p>
<p>apparatus.
</p>
<p>&bull; The state (2.29) describes a superposition of amplitudes rather than a sum of
</p>
<p>probabilities, leading to interference terms in the probability j&permil;j2.
&bull; The discreetness of the detection events exhibits the corpuscular nature of the
</p>
<p>neutrons.
</p>
<p>&bull; Neutrons were collected one by one at the observation plane, at a maximum rate
</p>
<p>of one neutron every 2 s. Therefore, while one neutron was being registered, the
</p>
<p>next one to arrive was usually still inside the uranium parent nucleus. The particle
</p>
<p>nature of neutrons is thus also confirmed. Moreover, constraints on the validity
</p>
<p>of quantum physics to statistical ensembles are ruled out.
</p>
<p>Similar interference patterns have been obtained with atoms, molecules and clusters,
</p>
<p>including fullerenes, a composite molecule of 64 carbon atoms [25].</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.6 Commutation Relations and the Uncertainty Principle 21
</p>
<p>The superposition giving rise to interference phenomena requires that there is no
</p>
<p>way to know, even in principle, which path the particle took, a or a0. Interference is
destroyed if this information exists, even if it is dispersed in the environment.
</p>
<p>2.6 Other Consequences of the Basic Principles
</p>
<p>It is shown in Sect. 2.6.1 that the commutation relation between two Hermitian
</p>
<p>operators Or; Os determines the precision with which the values of the corresponding
physical quantities may be simultaneously determined. Thus, Heisenberg uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty relations between momenta and coordinates become extended to any pair of
</p>
<p>observables and appear as a consequence of their commutation relations.
</p>
<p>We also present the no-cloning theorem (Sect. 2.6.2) and point out the relation
</p>
<p>between quantum commutators and Poisson brackets (Sect. 2.6.3).
</p>
<p>2.6.1 Commutation Relations and the Uncertainty Principle
</p>
<p>One assumes two Hermitian operators, OR; OS , and defines a third (non-Hermitian)
operator OQ, such that
</p>
<p>OQ � OR C i� OS; (2.30)
</p>
<p>where � is a real constant. The minimization with respect to � of the positively
</p>
<p>defined norm [see (2.52)]
</p>
<p>0 � h OQ&permil;j OQ&permil;i D h&permil;jQCQj&permil;i
D h&permil;jR2j&permil;i C i�h&permil;jŒR; S&#141;j&permil;i C �2h&permil;jS2j&permil;i (2.31)
</p>
<p>yields the value
</p>
<p>�min D �
i

h&permil;jŒR; S&#141;j&permil;i�=h&permil;jS2j&permil;i: (2.32)
</p>
<p>In the second line we have used the definition (2.11) of the Hermitian conjugate. In
</p>
<p>the last line, the relation Œ OR; OS&#141;C D �Œ OR; OS&#141; stems from the Hermitian character of
the operators [see (2.51)]. Substitution of the value �min in (2.31) yields

</p>
<p>Operators corresponding to observables can always be written in the form (2.35).
</p>
<p>If we prepare a large number of quantum systems in the same state &permil; and then
</p>
<p>perform some measurements of the observable r in some of the systems, and of
</p>
<p>s in the others, then the standard deviation &#129;r of the r-results times the standard
</p>
<p>deviation &#129;s of the s-results should satisfy the inequality (2.36). These are intrinsic
</p>
<p>limitations to the accuracy with which the values of two observables can be
</p>
<p>determined.
</p>
<p>In the case of coordinate and momentum operators, the relation (2.15) yields the
</p>
<p>Heisenberg uncertainty relation
</p>
<p>&#129;x&#129;p � &bdquo;
2
: (2.37)
</p>
<p>We emphasize the fact that this relation stems directly from basic principles and, in
</p>
<p>particular, from the commutation relation (2.15). It constitutes an intrinsic limitation
</p>
<p>upon our knowledge. This limitation cannot be overcome, for instance, by any
</p>
<p>improvement of the experiment.
</p>
<p>If the state of the system is an eigenstate of the operator Or , then a measurement of
the observable r yields the corresponding eigenvalue. The value of the observable s
</p>
<p>associated with a non-commutating operator Os is undetermined. This is the case of
a plane wave describing a particle in free space (Sect. 4.3) for which the momentum
</p>
<p>may be determined with complete precision, while the particle is spread over all
</p>
<p>space.
</p>
<p>Another consequence of the relation (2.36) is that the state vector &permil; may be
</p>
<p>simultaneously an eigenstate of Or and Os only if these two operators commute, since
in this case the product of their uncertainties vanishes. Moreover, if the operators
</p>
<p>commute and the eigenvalues of Os are all different within a subset of states, then
the matrix elements of Or are also diagonal within the same subset of states (see
Sect. 2.7.1*).
</p>
<p>Heisenberg conceived the uncertainty relations to solve the wave-particle para-
</p>
<p>dox. Pure particle behavior requires localization of the particle, while clear wave
</p>
<p>behavior appears only when the particle has a definite momentum. Heisenberg&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>interpretation of this was that each of these extreme classical descriptions is
</p>
<p>satisfied only when the other is completely untenable. Neither picture is valid for</p>

<p>intermediate situations. However, quantum mechanics has to be compatible with
</p>
<p>the description of the motion of elementary particles (not only with the description
</p>
<p>of the motion of macroscopic bodies) in terms of trajectories. Heisenberg&rsquo;s answer
</p>
<p>is that one may construct states &permil; that include a certain amount of localization
</p>
<p>p0.t/ and x0.t/ in both momentum and coordinate. Thus the motion of a particle
</p>
<p>has some resemblance to classical motion along trajectories. However, there should
</p>
<p>be a certain spread in the momentum and in the coordinate, such that the amplitudes
</p>
<p>hpj&permil;i and hxj&permil;i, in momentum eigenstates and in position eigenstates, allow
uncertainty relations to hold [26].
</p>
<p>For an illuminating example, Fig. 2.7 displays the capture of a pion by a carbon
</p>
<p>nucleus [27]. One can determine the mass, energy and charge of the particles,
</p>
<p>by measuring the length, the grain density and the scattering direction of their
</p>
<p>tracks. Let us assume a pion kinetic energy of 10 MeV. Using the pion mass
</p>
<p>(139 MeV/c2), one obtains a momentum of p�=53 MeV/c. The uncertainty in the
</p>
<p>direction perpendicular to the track may be estimated from the width of the track to
</p>
<p>be �1
m, which yields &#129;p? � 10�7 MeV/c. The ratio &#129;p?=p� � 10�9 is too
small to produce a visible alteration of the apparent trajectory
</p>
<p>2.6.2 No-Cloning Theorem
</p>
<p>Let us assume that there are many systems prepared in the state
</p>
<p>&permil; D aCϕC C a�ϕ� ; (2.38)
</p>
<p>and that the two amplitudes a˙ are unknown to us. By measuring two (non-
commuting) observables such as
</p>
<p>OQ D jϕCihϕCj � jϕ�ihϕ�j ; OR D jϕCihϕ�j C jϕ�ihϕCj ; (2.39)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24 2 The Principles of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>we obtain the averages
</p>
<p>h&permil;jQj&permil;i D jaCj2 � ja�j2 ; h&permil;jRj&permil;i D a�Ca� C a��aC ; (2.40)
</p>
<p>from which we can deduce the value of the amplitudes a˙, including the relative
phase.
</p>
<p>The situation is different if there is a single copy, since the probability amplitudes
</p>
<p>are lost after the first measurement. A possible way out would be to produce many
</p>
<p>copies of the initially single system, but this is prevented by the no-cloning theorem,
</p>
<p>which also reflects the fragility of quantum states. The theorem says that the state
</p>
<p>of a particle cannot be copied onto another particle, while the original particle
</p>
<p>remains in the same state [28]. This is also completely different from what happens
</p>
<p>in classical mechanics, where we can specify as much as required the state of the
</p>
<p>system by performing additional measurements without disturbing it.
</p>
<p>Suppose the state of two particles is given by
</p>
<p>ϕ.1/ χ.2/ (2.41)
</p>
<p>and that some unitary evolution effects the copying process
</p>
<p>ϕ.1/ϕ.2/ D U ϕ.1/ χ.2/ : (2.42)
</p>
<p>Suppose now that this copying procedure also works for another state
</p>
<p>φ.1/ φ.2/ D U φ.1/ χ.2/ : (2.43)
</p>
<p>The scalar product between (2.42) and (2.43) yields
</p>
<p>hϕjφi2 D hχ ϕjUCU jφ χi D hϕjφi : (2.44)
</p>
<p>Since this equation has two solutions, 0 and 1, either ϕ D φ or they are mutually
orthogonal. Therefore, a general quantum cloning device is impossible.
</p>
<p>Even if one allows non-unitary cloning devices, the cloning of non-orthogonal
</p>
<p>pure states remains impossible unless one is willing to tolerate a finite loss of fidelity
</p>
<p>in the cloned states.
</p>
<p>On the positive side, the impossibility of determining the components of a vector
</p>
<p>state prevents non-relativistic quantum mechanics to clash with relativity theory
</p>
<p>(Sects. 12.1 and 13.3).

<p>Dirac has pointed out that &ldquo;classical mechanics provides a valid description of
</p>
<p>dynamical systems under certain conditions. We should thus expect that important
</p>
<p>concepts in classical mechanics correspond to important concepts in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics&rdquo; [15]. In fact, the quantum mechanical commutator can be obtained
</p>
<p>from the classical Poisson bracket through the replacement of the coordinate and
</p>
<p>momentum by the corresponding quantum operators and multiplication by i&bdquo;
</p>
<p>i&bdquo;fu; vgPB ! ŒOu; Ov&#141; : (2.48)
</p>
<p>The commutativity of the classical multiplication rule is obtained in the limiting

However, the Poisson brackets (2.47) can only be defined with reference to a
</p>
<p>definite set of coordinates and momenta (although they are invariant under a change
</p>
<p>of this set). The quantum commutation relation is not limited by this condition
</p>
<p>and, therefore, has a more fundamental character. A particularly relevant example
</p>
<p>is the case of the spin components, which do not have classical counterparts (see

<p>The norm of a vector is defined as the square root of the scalar product of a vector
</p>
<p>with itself. A vector is said to be normalized if its norm equals 1. Two vectors are
</p>
<p>orthogonal if their scalar product vanishes. A vector &permil; is linearly independent of a
</p>
<p>subset of vectors &permil;a; &permil;b; : : : ; &permil;d if it cannot be expressed as a linear combination
</p>
<p>of them16 (&permil; &curren; ca&permil;a C cb&permil;b C 	 	 	 C cd&permil;d ).
These last two concepts allow us to define sets of basis vectors ϕi satisfying the
</p>
<p>requirement of orthonormalization. Moreover, these sets may be complete, in the
</p>
<p>sense that any vector &permil; may be expressed as a linear combination of them17 [see
</p>
<p>(2.6)]. The scalar product hi j&permil;i is the projection of &permil; onto ϕi . The scalar product
between two vectors &permil;a; &permil;b and the square of the norm of the vector &permil; are also
</p>
<p>given in terms of the amplitudes ci in Table 2.1.
</p>
<p>The number of states in a basis set is the dimension � of the associated Hilbert
</p>
<p>space. It has the value 3 in normal space. In this book, we use Hilbert spaces with
</p>
<p>dimensions ranging from two to infinity.
</p>
<p>15Definition of these fundamental operations is deferred to each realization of Hilbert spaces [(3.2),
</p>
<p>(3.4) and (4.1), (4.2)]. In the present chapter we use only the fact that they exist and that hajbi D
hbjai�.
16Although the term &ldquo;linear combination&rdquo; usually refers only to finite sums, we extend its meaning
</p>
<p>to also include an infinity of terms.
17The most familiar case of the expansion of a function in terms of an orthonormal basis set is
</p>
<p>the Fourier expansion in terms of the exponentials expŒikx&#141;, which constitute the complete set of
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions corresponding to the free particle case (see Sect. 4.3).</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 2.8 The final orientation
</p>
<p>of the axes depends on the
</p>
<p>order of the rotations. R� here
</p>
<p>represents a rotation of �=2
</p>
<p>around the �-axis
</p>
<p>In ordinary space, vectors are defined by virtue of their transformation properties
</p>
<p>under rotation operations OR�.�/ (� denoting the axis of rotation, and � the angle).
These operations are generally non-commutative, as the reader may easily verify by
</p>
<p>performing two successive rotations of � D �=2, first around the x-axis and then
around the y-axis, and subsequently comparing the result with the one obtained by
</p>
<p>reversing the order of these rotations (Fig. 2.8). Mathematically, this is expressed
</p>
<p>through the non-vanishing of the operator (2.8).
</p>
<p>In ordinary space, a dilation OD is an operation yielding the same vector
multiplied by a (real) constant. This operation has been generalized in terms of
</p>
<p>eigenvectors and eigenvalues in (2.9). In general, linear combinations of such
</p>
<p>eigenvectors do not satisfy the eigenvalue equation.
</p>
<p>2.7.1* Some Properties of Hermitian Operators
</p>
<p>The Hermitian conjugate operator OQC is defined through the (2.11). Similarly, we
may write
</p>
<p>h&permil;bjQj&permil;ai D h OQ&permil;aj&permil;bi� D h OQC&permil;bj&permil;ai : (2.49)
</p>
<p>The following properties are easy to demonstrate
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>OQC c OR
�C
D OQC C c� ORC; (2.50)
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>OQ OR
�C
D ORC OQC: (2.51)
</p>
<p>According to (2.11), the norm of the state OQ&permil; is obtained by
</p>
<p>h OQ&permil;j OQ&permil;i1=2 D h&permil;jQCQj&permil;i1=2 : (2.52)
</p>
<p>The norm is a real, positive number.
</p>
<p>An operator is said to be Hermitian if it is equal to its own Hermitian conjugate
</p>
<p>operator
</p>
<p>OQC D OQ: (2.53)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28 2 The Principles of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Assume now that the state ϕi is an eigenstate of the Hermitian operator
OQ
</p>
<p>corresponding to the eigenvalue qi . In this case
</p>
<p>hi jQjii D qi hi jii ; hi jQjii� D q�i hi jii
hi jQjii D hi jQjii� ! qi D q�i : (2.54)
</p>
<p>Therefore, the eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real numbers.
</p>
<p>Consider now the non-diagonal terms
</p>
<p>hj jQjii D qi hj jii ; hi jQjj i� D q�j hi jj i� D q�j hj jii ; (2.55)
</p>
<p>then
</p>
<p>0 D .qi � qj / hj jii; (2.56)
</p>
<p>i.e. two eigenstates, belonging to different eigenvalues, are orthogonal. They may
</p>
<p>also be orthonormal, upon multiplication by an appropriate normalization constant,
</p>
<p>which is determined up to a phase.
</p>
<p>The eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator constitute a complete set of states for a
</p>
<p>given system. This means that any state function &permil;, describing any state of the same
</p>
<p>system, may be expressed as a linear combination of basis states ϕi [see (2.6)].
We define the projection operator (a theoretical filter) jiihi j through the equation
</p>
<p>jiihi jϕj � hi jj iϕi D ıijϕi ; (2.57)
</p>
<p>which implies that
X
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>jiihi j&permil; D &permil; (2.58)
</p>
<p>for any &permil;. Thus, unity may be expressed as the operator
P
</p>
<p>i jiihi j. From this
property stems the closure property, according to which the matrix elements of
</p>
<p>the product of Hermitian operators may be calculated as the sum over all possible
</p>
<p>intermediate states of products of the matrix elements corresponding to each
</p>
<p>separate operator

<p>2.7.2* Unitary Transformations
</p>
<p>The unitary matrix .Uai / D .hi jai/ in (2.14) transforms the basis set ϕi into the
basis set χa. Such a matrix does not represent a physical observable and it is not
therefore required to be Hermitian.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

<p>Therefore, the inverse transformation U�1 is the transposed conjugate:

</p>
<p>where I is the unit matrix. A matrix satisfying (2.61) is said to be unitary.

<p>Equation (2.61) implies that

which yields the rule for the transformation of operators, namely

<p>Probability theory studies the likelihood Pi that the outcome qi of an event will take

</p>
<p>0 � Pi � 1 : (2.66)
</p>
<p>If Pi D 0, the outcome qi cannot occur; if Pi D 1, it will take place with certainty.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>30 2 The Principles of Quantum Mechanics

<p>If two events are mutually exclusive, the probability that one or the other occur is
</p>
<p>the sum

that the fluctuations become sufficiently small.
</p>
<p>The collection of Pi s is called the (discrete) probability distribution. The

<p>The linear homogeneous equations (3.11) have the trivial solution ci D 0, to be
discarded. The existence of additional, non-trivial solutions requires the determinant
</p>
<p>to vanish:
</p>
<p>det .hi jQjj i � qıij / D 0: (3.13)
</p>
<p>1This equation may be obtained directly by using the expansion (2.6) on both sides of the general

<p>eigenvalue equation OQ&permil; D q&permil;. One obtains Pj cj OQϕj D q

</p>
<p>j cj ϕj . The scalar product with

</p>
<p>This eigenvalue equation is equivalent to a polynomial equation for q. Its � roots are
</p>
<p>the eigenvalues of the operator OQ.
The vanishing of the determinant (3.13) implies that one of the equations (3.11)
</p>
<p>may be expressed as a linear combination of the other � � 1 equations. Therefore,
by disregarding one of these equations (for instance, the one corresponding to
</p>
<p>the last row) and dividing the remaining equations by ca, one obtains a set
</p>
<p>of � � 1 non-homogeneous linear equations2 yielding the value of the ratios
cb=ca; cc=ca; : : : ; c�=ca, for each eigenvalue q. The normalization equation (3.4)
</p>
<p>determines the value of jcaj2, up to the usual overall arbitrary phase of the state
vector. Note that the relative phases in the linear combination have physical
</p>
<p>significance, although the overall phase is unimportant.
</p>
<p>Diagonalization yields a new set of eigenstates φa. Each of them may be
expressed as a linear combination of the old basis states ϕi .

The modulus squared jhajiij2 is both the probability of measuring the eigenvalue qi ,
associated with the eigenstate ϕi , if the system is in the state φa, and the probability
of measuring the eigenvalue ra, associated with the eigenstate φa, when the state of
the system is ϕi .

</p>
<p>The physical world displays many systems with two states, the spin being the
</p>
<p>most conspicuous one. But in fact, any two states sufficiently isolated from the
</p>
<p>remaining ones may be approximated as a two-state system, for which the no-
</p>
<p>crossing rule holds. Another example is given by an electron and two protons. As
</p>
<p>a reasonable approximation, we may neglect the motion of the protons, since they
</p>
<p>are much heavier than the electron. The two states ϕa;ϕb represent the electron
bound to each of the protons: a hydrogen atom and a separate proton in each case.
</p>
<p>In this case the Hamiltonian OH plays the role of OQ in (3.18) and (3.19). The extra
binding &#129;, arising from the superposition of states ϕa;ϕb , allows for the existence
of a bound state: the stability of the ionized hydrogen molecule thus has a purely
</p>
<p>quantum mechanical origin. This problem is discussed in more detail in Sect. 8.4.1.

<p>Let us consider the case OQ D �x . Equation (3.19) yields the eigenvalues sx D ˙1

<p>It happens that the operators representing the spin components are given by OSi D

</p>
<p>expected for physical reasons: the eigenvalues do indeed have physical significance,
</p>
<p>while the orientation of the coordinate system in an isotropic space does not.
</p>
<p>3.3 Harmonic Oscillator
</p>
<p>Here we present a solution to the harmonic oscillator problem, a solution that stems
</p>
<p>directly from the basic principles listed in Sect. 2.3. The Hamiltonian corresponding
</p>
<p>to the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is
</p>
<p>OH D 1
2M
Op2 C M!
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>2
Ox2; (3.25)
</p>
<p>where ! is the classical frequency (Fig. 3.2).
</p>
<p>The harmonic oscillator potential is probably the most widely used potential in
</p>
<p>physics, because of its ability to represent physical potentials in the vicinity of stable
</p>
<p>equilibrium [e.g. vibrational motion in molecules (8.28)].
</p>
<p>It is always convenient to start by finding the order of magnitude of the quantities
</p>
<p>involved. To do so, we apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (2.37). If the
</p>
<p>substitutions Ox ! &#129;x and Op ! &bdquo;=2&#129;x are made in the harmonic oscillator energy,
so that

<p>3.3.1 Solution of the Eigenvalue Equation
</p>
<p>We intend to solve (2.17). The unknowns are the eigenvalues Ei and the eigen-
</p>
<p>functions ϕi . The fundamental tool entering the present solution is the commutation
relation (2.15).
</p>
<p>We first define the operators aC; a</p>
<p/>

Op: (3.29)
</p>
<p>The operators Ox and Op are Hermitian, since they correspond to physical observables.
Therefore, the operators a; aC are Hermitian conjugates of each other, according to
(2.50). They satisfy the commutation relations
</p>
<p>� OH; aC
�
</p>
<p>D &bdquo;!aC; (3.30)
�
</p>
<p>a; aC
�
</p>
<p>D 1: (3.31)
</p>
<p>We now construct the matrix elements (2.10) for both sides of (3.30), making use of
</p>
<p>two eigenstates ϕi ;ϕj :
</p>
<p>hi jŒ OH; aC&#141;jj i D .Ei � Ej /hi jaCjj i D &bdquo;!hi jaCjj i: (3.32)
</p>
<p>We conclude that the matrix element hi jaCjj i vanishes, unless the difference
Ei � Ej between the energies of the two eigenstates is the constant &bdquo;!. This
fact implies that we may sequentially order the eigenstates connected by aC, the
difference between two consecutive energies being &bdquo;!. Another consequence is that
we may assign an integer number n to each eigenstate.
</p>
<p>Since a; aC are Hermitian conjugate operators, we may also write
</p>
<p>hnC 1jaCjni D hnjajnC 1i�: (3.33)
</p>
<p>Finally, we expand the expectation value of (3.31):
</p>
<p>1 D hnjŒa; aC&#141;jni
D hnjajnC 1ihnC 1jaCjni � hnjaCjn� 1ihn� 1jajni
D jhnC 1jaCjnij2 � jhnjaCjn� 1ij2: (3.34)
</p>
<p>This is a finite difference equation in yn D jhnC 1jaCjnij2, of the type 1 D yn �
yn�1. Its solutions are
</p>
<p>jhnC 1jaCjnij2 D nC c; hnC 1jaCjni D
p
nC 1; (3.35)
</p>
<p>where c is a constant. Since the left-hand side is positive definite, the quantum
</p>
<p>number n must have a lower limit, which we may choose to be n D 0. It corresponds
to the ground state ϕ0. In such a case, the matrix element h0jaCj � 1i should
disappear, which fixes the value of the constant c D 1. Therefore, according to
(3.33), h�1jaj0i D 0, which is equivalent to

<p>i.e. the ground state is annihilated by the operator a, which is called the annihilation

</p>
<p>The whole set of orthogonal eigenstates may be constructed by repeatedly

<p>3.3.2 Some Properties of the Solution
</p>
<p>In the following we use this exact, analytical solution of the harmonic oscillator

</p>
<p>of the spatial dependence of the harmonic oscillator problem is deferred to Sect. 4.2.
</p>
<p>&bull; The classical equilibrium position xDpD 0 is not compatible with the uncer-
tainty principle, because it implies a simultaneous determination of coordinate
</p>
<p>and momentum. The replacement of &#129;x in (3.26) with (3.27) yields the

<p>3However, the reader is warned against concluding that most quantum problems are analytically
</p>
<p>solvable, a conclusion that may be reinforced throughout these notes by the repeated utilization of
</p>
<p>exactly soluble examples. Most quantum problems require insight into physics to approximate the
</p>
<p>solution and/or sizeable computing facilities.

<p>As a consequence of this relation, it is possible to know simultaneously the eigen-

the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian are also eigenstates of the parity operator Ŏ .
The eigenvalues of the operator Ŏ are determined by the fact that the operator Ŏ 2</p>

<p>corresponding to the operator Ŏ , namely � D ˙1. The eigenfunctions are either
invariant under the parity transformation (� D 1, even functions) or change sign

OH0 are given by the product states ϕa &brvbar;n and ϕb &brvbar;n [see (3.15) and (3.37)].

<p>The Schrödinger Realization
</p>
<p>of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>The realization of the basic principles of quantum mechanics by means of position
</p>
<p>wave functions is presented in Sect. 4.1. This is where the time-independent
</p>
<p>Schrödinger equation is obtained, and where the spatial dimension in quantum
</p>
<p>problems appears explicitly.
</p>
<p>The harmonic oscillator problem is solved again in Sect. 4.2. The reader will thus
</p>
<p>be able to contrast two realizations of quantum mechanics by comparing the results
</p>
<p>obtained here with those presented in Sect. 3.3.
</p>
<p>Solutions to the Schrödinger equation in the absence of forces are discussed in
</p>
<p>Sect. 4.3. Such solutions present normalization problems which are solved by taking
</p>
<p>into consideration the limiting case of particles moving either in a large, infinitely
</p>
<p>deep square well potential, or along a circumference with a large radius (Sect. 4.4.1).
</p>
<p>These solutions are applied to some situations that are interesting both conceptually
</p>
<p>and in practical applications: the step potential (Sect. 4.5.1) and the square barrier
</p>
<p>(Sect. 4.5.2), which are schematic versions of scattering experiments. The free-
</p>
<p>particle solutions are also applied to the bound-state problem of the finite square
</p>
<p>well (Sect. 4.4.2), to the periodic potential (Sect. 4.6&#142;) and to a practical application,
</p>
<p>the tunneling microscope (Sect. 4.5.3).
</p>
<p>4.1 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation
</p>
<p>In the formulation of quantum mechanics presented in this chapter, the state vector
</p>
<p>is a complex function of the coordinate, &permil; D &permil;.x/. This type of state vector is
usually known as a wave function. The sum of two wave functions is another wave

<p>4.2 The Harmonic Oscillator Revisited 51
</p>
<p>Here we may continue the list of misconceptions that prevail in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics [19]:
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;The probability current j.x/ is related to the speed of that part of the particle
</p>
<p>which is located at the position x.&rdquo; This statement gives the false impression
</p>
<p>that, although the particle as a whole has neither a definite position nor a definite
</p>
<p>momentum, it is made up of parts that do. In fact, particles are not made up of
</p>
<p>parts.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;For any energy eigenstate, the probability density must have the same symmetry
</p>
<p>as the Hamiltonian.&rdquo; This statement is correct in the case of inversion symmetry,
</p>
<p>for even states of a parity-invariant Hamiltonian (see Sect. 4.2). It is not correct
</p>
<p>for odd states. It is also generally false for a central potential, since only l D 0
states have probability densities with a spherical shape (Fig. 5.2).
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;A quantum state &permil;.x/ is completely specified by its associated probability
</p>
<p>density j&permil;.x/j2.&rdquo; The probability densities, being real numbers, cannot give
information about all the properties of the state, such as, for example, those
</p>
<p>related to momentum.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;The wave function is dimensionless.&rdquo; It has the dimensions Œlength&#141;�dN=2 , where

<p>&bull; &ldquo;The wave function &permil;.x/ is a function of regular three-dimensional space.&rdquo; This

<p>Not only does one get rid of unnecessarily cumbersome constants, but the solution

<p>may apply just as well to cases other than the one being considered. Therefore, in

<p>4.2.2 Spatial Features of the Solutions
</p>
<p>The following features arise from the spatial dimension associated with the
</p>
<p>Schrödinger formulation:
</p>
<p>&bull; Probability density. There are nodes in the probability density (except for the
</p>
<p>n D 0 state). The existence of such nodes is incompatible with the classical
notion of a trajectory x.t/, according to which the particle bounces from one
</p>
<p>side of the potential to the other, while going through every intermediate point.
</p>
<p>The fact is that the particle can never be found at the nodes. The quantum picture
</p>
<p>reminds us of the stationary wave patterns obtained, for instance, inside an organ
</p>
<p>pipe. The role that is played in the case of sound by the ends of the pipe is played
</p>
<p>in the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator by the boundary conditions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Comparison between the classical and quantum mechanical probability densi-
</p>
<p>ties. The classical probability for finding a particle is inversely proportional to its
</p>
<p>speed [v D
�
</p>
<p>2E=M � !2x2
�1=2
</p>
<p>for the harmonic oscillator]. Therefore, we may
</p>
<p>define a classical probability density Pclas D !=&nbsp;v. The probability of finding
the particle in any place, within the classically allowed interval �xn � x � xn,
is 1. Here, xn D xc.2n C 1/1=2 for a particle with energy &bdquo;!.n C 1=2/. The
classical probability density displays a minimum around the origin and diverges
</p>
<p>as the particle approaches the end points of the allowed interval. The quantum
</p>
<p>mechanical density distribution for the ground state has exactly the opposite
</p>
<p>features. However, as n increases, the quantum mechanical density distribution
</p>
<p>tends towards the classical limit (Fig. 4.2). In fact, the quantum probability
</p>
<p>Pn.x0; &#129;x/ satisfies the limiting relation</p>

<p>contradicting the uncertainty principle. Let us suppose that a particle in its ground</p>

p
2xc, i.e. within the region
</p>
<p>following the classically allowed one. In this interval, the probability density
</p>
<p>decreases from N 20 =e at x D xc to N 20 =e3 (i.e. by a factor e�2). If we measure
the particle within this interval, and we take it to be a reasonable measure of the

</p>
<p>which is consistent with an uncertainty in the kinetic energy larger than

&bdquo;!. Since the potential energy in the same interval increases
</p>
<p>from &bdquo;!=2 to &bdquo;!, we cannot make any statement about a possible imaginary
value for the momentum, which would rule out the possibility that the particle
</p>
<p>penetrates into the classically forbidden region.

<p>4.4 One-Dimensional Bound Problems 57
</p>
<p>Let us consider now the case E � V0, which makes no sense from the classical
point of view. However, the solution of the harmonic oscillator problem (third item
</p>
<p>in Sect. 4.2.2) has warned us not to reject this situation out of hand in the quantum
</p>
<p>case. In fact, the general solution is the linear combination5

</p>
<p>2M.V0 � E/
&bdquo; : (4.38)
</p>
<p>This general solution diverges at infinity: j&permil;j ! 1 as x ! ˙1. Rather than a
total rejection, this feature implies that the solution (4.38) can only be used if at
</p>
<p>least one of the extremes cannot be reached. For instance, if V0 &gt; E for x &gt; a, one
</p>
<p>imposes BC D 0.

</p>
<p>4.4.1 Infinite Square Well Potential. Electron Gas
</p>
<p>The potential in this case is V.x/ D 0 if jxj � a=2 and V.x/ D 1 for jxj � a=2
(Fig. 4.4).
</p>
<p>The two infinite discontinuities should be canceled in the Schrödinger equation
</p>
<p>by similar discontinuities in the second derivative at the same points. This is
</p>
<p>accomplished by requiring the wave function to be a continuous function and
</p>
<p>requiring the first derivative to have a finite discontinuity at the boundaries of the
</p>
<p>potential. Since the wave function vanishes outside the classically allowed interval,
</p>
<p>the continuity of the wave function requires &permil;.˙a=2/ D 0.
According to (3.48), we may demand that the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>carry a definite parity. This is accomplished by using the solutions (4.37) with AC D
A� for the even parity states, and AC D �A� for the odd ones. The eigenfunctions
are written as

The reader is recommended to check that the quantum features associated with
</p>
<p>the solution of the harmonic oscillator problem (Sect. 4.2.2) are reproduced in the
</p>
<p>case of the infinite square well. The exception is the one related to the tunnel effect,
</p>
<p>which is prevented here by the infinite discontinuity in the potential.
</p>
<p>By increasing the size of the box, the infinite potential well may be used to
</p>
<p>model the potential binding the electrons in a metal. In the electron gas model in
</p>
<p>one dimension, the (non-interacting) electrons are confined to a (large) segment a,
</p>
<p>which is much larger than the size of a given experimental set-up.
</p>
<p>However, the standing waves (4.39) are not convenient for discussing charge
</p>
<p>and energy transport by electrons. In fact, the probability current associated with
</p>
<p>them vanishes. In the theory of metals, it is more convenient to use running waves
</p>
<p>exp.˙ikx/ (4.32). We may use an alternative boundary condition by imagining that
the end point at x D a=2 is joined to the opposite point at x D �a=2. In this way
the segment transforms into a circumference with the same length a. An electron
</p>
<p>arriving at the end of the well is not reflected back in, but leaves the metal and
</p>
<p>simultaneously re-enters at the opposite end. The representation of a free particle
</p>
<p>becomes more adequate as the radius a=2&nbsp; gets larger. This procedure results in the
</p>
<p>boundary condition &permil;.x/ D &permil;.x C a/, or

<p>The total number of states is the same as for the standing waves (4.40), since
</p>
<p>the presence of half-integer and integer numbers in that case is compensated for
</p>

discretized, the gap
</p>
<p>&#129;k D 2&nbsp;=a (4.44)
between two consecutive eigenvalues becomes smaller than any prescribed interval,
</p>
<p>if the radius of the circumference is taken to be sufficiently large.
</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, sums over intermediate states often appear. In the
</p>
<p>case of wave functions of the type (4.43), this procedure may be simplified by
</p>
<p>transforming the sums into integrals, using the length element in the integrals

<p>4.4.2 Finite Square Well Potential
</p>
<p>The potential reads V.x/ D �V0 &lt; 0 if jxj &lt; a=2 and V.x/ D 0 for other values
of x. Here we consider only bound states, with a negative energy (0 � �E � �V0).
</p>
<p>As in the harmonic oscillator case, the potential is invariant under the parity
</p>
<p>transformation x ! �x. Thus we expect the eigenfunctions to be either even or
odd with respect to this transformation. Therefore, the solution (4.37) applies in the

<p>The spectrum of normalizable (bound) states is always discrete. Conversely,

<p>This is the case for positive values of the energy (see Sect. 4.5.2).
</p>
<p>4.5 One-Dimensional Unbound Problems
</p>
<p>In this section we study problems related to the scattering of a particle by means of
</p>
<p>a potential. We assume that the particle impinges from the left and may be reflected
</p>
<p>and/or transmitted. There is no incoming wave from the right. Therefore the state
</p>
<p>vector must satisfy the following boundary conditions:
</p>
<p>&bull; It includes the term AC exp.ikx/ for x ! �1;
&bull; It does not include the term A� exp.�ikx/ for x !1.
</p>
<p>4.5.1 One-Step Potential
</p>
<p>The one-step potential is written as V.x/ D 0 for x &lt; 0 and V.x/ D V0 &gt; 0 for
x &gt; 0 (Fig. 4.6). It represents an electron moving along a conducting wire that is
</p>
<p>interrupted by a short gap. The electron feels a change in the potential as it crosses
</p>
<p>the gap.
</p>
<p>Ea &lt; V0
</p>
<p>Classically, the particle rebounds at x D 0 and cannot penetrate the region x � 0.
Quantum mechanically this is no longer the case. For x � 0 the solution is given as
the superposition of an incoming and a reflected wave (4.37), with V0 D 0. Equation</p>

</p>
<p>There is a tunneling effect for x � 0, since the particle can penetrate into

</p>
<p>The classical solution describes an incident particle which is totally transmitted, but

<p>refraction. At least a partial reflection of the beam takes place.

<p>4.5.2 Square Barrier
</p>
<p>The potential is given by V.x/ D 0 .jxj &gt; a=2/ and V.x/ D V0 .jxj &lt; a=2/
(Fig. 4.7). We only consider explicitly the case E � V0. Classically, the particle can
only be reflected at x D �a=2.
</p>
<p>For x � �a=2 and for x � a=2, the solution to the Schrödinger equation
again takes the form (4.37), with the same value of k for both regions (V0 D 0).
However, there is only a transmitted wave, C exp.ikx/, for x � a=2. Within the
intermediate region �a=2 � x � a=2, the solution is as in (4.38). We cannot now
reject either of the two components on account of their bad behavior at infinity.
</p>
<p>We thus have five amplitudes. The continuity conditions at the two boundaries
</p>
<p>provide us with four equations: the four remaining amplitudes may be expressed
</p>
<p>in terms of the amplitude of the incident wave AC. We may also obtain here the
currents associated with the incident beam jI, the reflected beam jR, the transmitted
</p>
<p>beam jT and the beam within the barrier jB, and the reflection and transmission

<p>coefficients R; T :</p>

<p>4.5.3 Scanning Tunneling Microscope
</p>
<p>The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) was developed in the 1980s by Gerd
</p>
<p>Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer [33]. A conducting probe ending in a very sharp tip is
</p>
<p>held close to a metal sample. In a metal, electrons move freely according to the
</p>
<p>electron gas model [Sects. (4.4.1) and (7.4.1)], filling all levels up to the Fermi
</p>
<p>energy �F. The potential rises at the surface of the metal forming a barrier, and
</p>
<p>electrons tunnel through the barrier between tip and surface sample (Fig. 4.8). The
</p>
<p>tunneling current6 is proportional to the transmission coefficient T (4.62). Thus, it
</p>
<p>exponentially increases as the distance tip&ndash;surface decreases. The tip is mounted on
</p>
<p>a piezoelectric tube, which allows very small movements by applying voltage at its
</p>
<p>electrodes. The tip slowly scans the surface.
</p>
<p>6A small voltage difference Vts between tip and sample must be introduced, to ensure the existence
</p>
<p>of empty electron states in the sample, that should be occupied by tunneled electrons.</p>

<p>An effective value of � can be estimated by replacing the difference V0 � E
in (4.38) by an average of sample and tip work functions W (the smallest energy

<p>needed to remove an electron from a metal, about 4 eV). Thus �� 2 Å�1 and,
consequently, the device is sensitive to changes in distance at the subangstrom scale

</p>
<p>The tip is moved over the surface of the sample, which requires high precision
</p>
<p>movement coupled to electrical control. This is achieved by means of piezoelectric
</p>
<p>elements.
</p>
<p>The STM is used in both industrial and basic research to obtain atomic-scale
</p>
<p>images of metal surfaces and of other materials, from the atomic to the micron
</p>
<p>scale. It is also possible to achieve tiny tunnel currents if, for instance, biological
</p>
<p>materials are spread as thin films over conductive substrates.
</p>
<p>Large electric fields applied to the tip can lift atoms one by one and deposit them
</p>
<p>at chosen locations. The contents of all books from the British Library could thus fit
</p>
<p>on top of one stamp. One can also make small &ldquo;quantum corrals,&rdquo; a few angstrom
</p>
<p>wide.7
</p>
<p>7However, it is still difficult to find quantum features in these small systems because of decoherence

<p>68 4 The Schrödinger Realization of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>4.6&#142; Band Structure of Crystals
</p>
<p>A crystal consists of an array of N positive ions displaying a periodic structure
</p>
<p>in space and electrons moving in the electric field generated by the ions. Figure 4.9
</p>
<p>sketches the potentialV.xCd/ D V.x/ that an electron feels in the one-dimensional
case. In this section we study the main features of the single-particle eigenstates in
</p>
<p>such a potential.
</p>
<p>Classically, an electron moving in the potential of Fig. 4.9 may be bound to a
</p>
<p>single ion so that it is unable to transfer to another ion. Quantum mechanically, this
</p>
<p>may be ensured only if the distance d between the ions is very large. In such a case,
</p>
<p>the N states in which the electron is bound to one atom of the array constitute an
</p>
<p>orthogonal set of states which is N times degenerate. However, as the distance d is
</p>
<p>reduced to realistic values, we expect the degeneracy to be broken and the energy
</p>
<p>eigenvalues to be distributed within a band. In the following, we show how this
</p>
<p>picture is represented mathematically.
</p>
<p>The Bloch theorem states that the wave function of a particle moving in a periodic
</p>
<p>potential has the form
</p>
<p>ϕk.x/ D exp.ikx/uk.x/; (4.63)
where k is real and uk.x C d/ D uk.x/ is a periodic function [34].
</p>
<p>Since the most relevant property of the potential is its periodicity and not its
</p>
<p>detailed shape, we replace the realistic potential with a periodic array of square well
</p>
<p>potentials (Fig. 4.9). We have learned by now how to solve square well problems.
</p>
<p>Here V.x/ D �V0 .0 � x � b/ and V.x/ D �V1 (b � x � d ). Moreover,
V.x C d/ D V.x/. We denote the energy by �E , with E &gt; 0. We assume that the
electron is bound to the crystal for negative energy values.

<p>Motion in Angular Subspace
</p>
<p>This chapter deals with the angular degrees of freedom and, therefore, the crucial
</p>
<p>role is played by the spherical symmetry. The quantum angular momenta are
</p>
<p>treated from both matrix and differential equation points of view. The difference
</p>
<p>in the corresponding results reveals the existence of the most important quantum
</p>
<p>observable: the spin. Addition of angular momenta, quantum rotations and the
</p>
<p>Wigner&ndash;Eckart theorem are also discussed.

<p>74 5 Motion in Angular Subspace
</p>
<p>5.1 Eigenvalues and Eigenstates
</p>
<p>5.1.1 Matrix Treatment
</p>
<p>In the following, we take the commutation relations (5.4) as the definition of
</p>
<p>quantum angular momentum. Therefore, this definition also takes care of the
</p>
<p>quantum version of orbital angular momentum (5.2). However, as we shall see,
</p>
<p>definition (5.4) also includes other types of angular momenta of a purely quantum
</p>
<p>mechanical origin. From here on we let OJi denote operator components that satisfy
the relations
</p>
<p>Œ OJi ; OJj &#141; D i&bdquo;�ijk OJk ; (5.6)
where �ijk is the Levi&ndash;Civita tensor,
</p>
<p>1 whatever their origin may be. We use the
</p>
<p>notation OLi for angular momentum operators associated with orbital motion (5.2).
The commutation relations ensure that one can precisely determine the modulus
</p>
<p>squared simultaneously with one projection of the angular momentum, but not two
</p>
<p>projections at the same time. Consequently, one may construct eigenfunctions that
</p>
<p>are common to the operators OJ 2 and OJz. The choice of the z-component is arbitrary,
since the space is isotropic and, consequently, there are no preferred directions.
</p>
<p>The procedure for solving this problem closely follows the matrix treatment of
</p>
<p>the harmonic oscillator (Sect. 3.3.1). It is given in detail in Sect. 5.4*. The following
</p>
<p>results are obtained:
</p>
<p>&bull; The two-dimensional angular subspace displays two more symmetries and thus
</p>
<p>provides two additional quantum numbers. The eigenvalue equations for the
</p>
<p>operators OJ
2
</p>
<p>and OJz can be written as
</p>
<p>OJ 2ϕjm D &bdquo;2j.j C 1/ϕjm; OJzϕjm D &bdquo;mϕjm; (5.7)
</p>
<p>where the possible values of the quantum numbers j;m are

</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>2
; : : : ; (5.8)
</p>
<p>with m increasing in units of 1.
</p>
<p>&bull; Since the maximum value of m is j , and j 2 &lt; j.jC1/, the maximum projection
of the angular momentum is always smaller than the modulus (except for j D 0).
Thus, the angular momentum vector can never be completely aligned with the z-
</p>
<p>axis. This fact is consistent with the lack of commutativity in (5.6): a complete
</p>
<p>alignment would imply the vanishing of the components OJx ; OJy and thus the
simultaneous determination of the corresponding physical quantities and of Jz
(see Problem 3).

</p>
<p>Figure 5.1 represents the possible orientations of the angular momentum
</p>
<p>vector for the case j D 5=2. It looks as if the angular momentum precesses
around the z-axis. However, this picture is incorrect, since it implies that the
</p>
<p>end point of the angular momentum vector goes through a circular trajectory,
</p>
<p>something that does not make sense from the point of view of quantum
</p>
<p>uncertainty relations.

<p>The detailed treatment of the orbital angular momentum operator is given in

<p>Sect. 5.5*. The results of such an approach are as follows:

<p>&bull; The simultaneous eigenfunctions of the operators OL2; OLz are called spherical

</p>
<p>&bull; The rotational Hamiltonian of a molecule is proportional to the operator OL2.
The corresponding energy eigenvalues therefore follow the rule l.l C 1/ (see
Sect. 8.4.2).
</p>
<p>By taking the commutation relations as the definition of the angular momentum
</p>
<p>operators, we have obtained operators that are not derived from the classical orbital
</p>
<p>angular momentum (see Sects. 5.1.1 and 5.1.2). This statement is supported by the
</p>
<p>fact that the quantum numbers j;m associated with these quantum mechanical
</p>
<p>angular momenta may take either integer or half-integer values, in contrast with
</p>
<p>those labeling the orbital angular momentum, which can only take integer values.
</p>
<p>Otherwise we obtain the same matrix elements for the projections OJi (5.9) as for
the orbital angular momentum projections OLi . On the other hand, the probability
densities associated with the orbital angular momentum display interesting and
</p>
<p>useful features that are lacking in the more general derivation (Fig. 5.2).

<p>According to classical electromagnetism, an electric current i produces a magnetic

</p>
<p>where �B � jej&bdquo;=2M is called the Bohr magneton (Table A.1) and gl D 1 is the
orbital gyromagnetic ratio.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the presence of a magnetic field displaces the energy of a particle
</p>
<p>by an amount proportional to the component of the angular momentum along the
</p>
<p>magnetic field (Zeeman effect). Classically, this change is a continuous function of
</p>
<p>the orientation of the angular momentum but, according to quantum mechanics, the

<p>We may ignore the nuclear contributions to the magnetic moment on the grounds

<p>that the nuclear magneton is about 2,000 times smaller than the Bohr magneton.
</p>
<p>(It includes the proton mass in the denominator, instead of the electron mass.)
</p>
<p>Moreover, 46 of the 47 electrons form a spherically symmetric electron cloud with

<p>no net angular momentum (see Sect. 7.3). Therefore, the total spin of the Ag atom

<p>systems (Chap. 13). Consistently with this relevance, modern techniques for spin
</p>
<p>detection and manipulation have greatly improved since Stern and Gerlach&rsquo;s times.
</p>
<p>It is now possible to deal with individual spins, rising the hopes for spintronics &ndash;
</p>
<p>exploiting the spin degree of freedom in electronic circuits, playing a similar role as
</p>
<p>the charge degree of freedom (Sect. 7.4.5&#142;).
</p>
<p>5.2.2 Spin Formalism
</p>
<p>Three years after the publication of the Stern&ndash;Gerlach experiment, George
</p>
<p>Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit proposed another quantum number to specify
</p>
<p>the state of electrons (and of many other fundamental particles) [35]. It labels the</p>

</p>
<p>two projections of the spin, by then a new physical entity representing an intrinsic
</p>
<p>angular momentum.
</p>
<p>Since the spin is a pure quantum observable, only the matrix treatment formalism
</p>
<p>is possible. If s D 1=2, then the basis set of states is given by the two-component
vectors (3.15) [36]

<p>The eigenstates of the operator OSx have been obtained by means of a unitary
transformation of the eigenvectors of OSz (3.21). This is a particular case of the more
general transformation aligning the spin s D 1=2 operator with a direction of space
labeled by the angles ˇ; �. The operator OSˇ� may be written as the scalar product of
the spin vector OS times a unit vector along the chosen direction (see Problem 5 in

<p>5.3.1 Addition of Angular Momenta
</p>
<p>Consider two angular momentum vector operators, OJ 1 and OJ 2. They are indepen-
</p>
<p>dent vectors, i.e. Œ OJ 1; OJ 2&#141; D 0. Therefore, the product states are simultaneous
eigenstates of the operators OJ 21 ; OJz1; OJ 22 and OJz2 :

</p>
<p>These .2j1C 1/.2j2C 1/ eigenstates constitute a complete basis for states carrying
the quantum numbers j1; m1; j2; m2. However, it may not be the most useful one.
</p>
<p>We may prefer a basis labeled by the quantum numbers associated with the total
</p>
<p>angular momentum OJ (see Fig. 5.5):

<p>Fig. 5.5 Coupling of two vectors with j1 D 5=2 and j2 D 1=2 (dotted lines) may yield a vector

; m2 D 12 and m1 D 52 ; m2 D � 12 , respectively
</p>
<p>Since the components OJx ; OJy ; OJz also satisfy the commutation relations (5.4) and
(5.6), there must exist another basis set made up from eigenstates of the operators
OJ 2 and OJz. Since the commutation relations
</p>

<p>5.6* Coupling with Spin s D 1=2
</p>
<p>The use of (5.31) is exemplified in the case where the second angular momentum
</p>
<p>is the spin j2 D s D 1=2 (Fig. 5.5). Here the summation consists of two terms,
corresponding to the two values of the spin projection ms D ˙1=2. According to
(5.33), there are also two values for the total angular momentum j D j1 ˙ 1=2.
However, if j1 D 0, only the value j D 1=2 is allowed:

<p>A particular application of this example is the coupling of orbital motion with the

harmonics Yl1ml1 (5.62). However, (5.67) is valid whatever the nature of the angular
</p>
<p>momentum j1 may be.
</p>
<p>If j D j1 C 12 and jmj D j , there is a single term in (5.67). For the particular
case j1 D 0, this is a physical consequence of the fact that a spherical object should
be uncoupled from the total angular momentum (Fig. 5.2).

<p>Three-Dimensional Hamiltonian Problems
</p>
<p>In the present chapter, we broaden the quantum mechanical treatment of the
</p>
<p>problem of a single particle moving in three-dimensional space to incorporate the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian. We only treat central potentials V.r/ D V.r/. In particular, we study
the Coulomb and the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, including
</p>
<p>Rydberg atoms. We also present the spin&ndash;orbit interaction and elements of scattering
</p>
<p>theory.
</p>
<p>6.1 Central Potentials
</p>
<p>The solution to a given problem can be simplified by exploiting the associated
</p>
<p>symmetries. We have already shown that this is the case by applying invariance
</p>
<p>under the inversion operation (see the bound problems of Sects. 4.2 and 4.4). Since
</p>
<p>problems involving a central potential V.r/ are spherically symmetric, we shall
</p>
<p>make use of this symmetry. For this purpose, we write the kinetic energy Laplacian
</p>
<p>in spherical coordinates (5.10). The total Hamiltonian reads

</p>
<p>where the operator OL2 is the square of the orbital angular momentum (5.11). Since
the Hamiltonian (6.1) commutes with operators OL2 and OLz, there is a basis set of
eigenfunctions for the three operators. The eigenvalue equation (4.11) is solved
</p>
<p>by factorizing the wave function into radial and angular terms, the latter being
</p>
<p>represented by the spherical harmonics (5.62):

<p>In such a case, the operator OL2 in the kinetic energy can be replaced by its eigenvalue

<p>where the new quantum number nr distinguishes between states with the same value

</p>
<p>eigenvalues Enr l are also independent of it. In consequence, the eigenenergies of
</p>
<p>a central potential are necessarily degenerate, with degeneracy equal to 2l C 1
(5.13). This result is to be expected since the quantum number ml depends on
</p>
<p>the orientation of the coordinate axis. That is to say, the central potential has
</p>
<p>spherical symmetry and the resulting energies (which are physical quantities) should
</p>
<p>not depend on the orientation of the coordinate axis (which is an artifact of the
</p>
<p>calculation).
</p>
<p>Systems for which the number of quantum numbers equals the number of degrees
</p>
<p>of freedom are called integrable. Do not get a wrong impression out of the present
</p>
<p>chapter: they are the exceptions.
</p>
<p>6.1.1 Coulomb and Harmonic Oscillator Potentials
</p>
<p>In this section, we discuss the solutions to the eigenvalue equation for two central
</p>
<p>potentials: the Coulomb potential�Ze2=4��0r and the three-dimensional harmonic
oscillator potential M!2r2=2.
</p>
<p>It is always useful to begin by estimating the orders of magnitude of the quantities
</p>
<p>involved. For the linear harmonic oscillator, this has already been done in (3.28).
</p>
<p>These orders of magnitude remain valid for the three-dimensional case, since
</p>
<p>the harmonic Hamiltonian is separable into three Cartesian coordinates, and the
</p>
<p>estimate (3.28) holds for each coordinate. For the Coulomb potential, we may again
</p>
<p>use the Heisenberg uncertainty relations

<p>The solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the Coulomb2 and the harmonic
</p>
<p>oscillator potentials are shown in Table 6.1. The corresponding details are outlined
</p>
<p>in Sect. 6.4*. The following comments stem from the comparison between the
</p>
<p>solutions for these two potentials:
</p>
<p>&bull; In both cases, the radial factor Rnr l .r/ may be expressed as a product of an
</p>
<p>exponential decay, a power of u, ul , and a polynomial of degree nr (Coulomb) or
</p>
<p>2nr (harmonic oscillator).
</p>
<p>&bull; The radial factor ul decreases the radial density jRnr l j2r2 for small values of u
and increases it for large values. It is a manifestation of centrifugal effects due to
</p>
<p>rotation of the particle.
</p>
<p>&bull; Both potentials display a higher degree of degeneracy than is required by
</p>
<p>spherical invariance.
</p>
<p>&bull; All degenerate states in the harmonic oscillator potential have the same value of
</p>
<p>.�1/l D .�1/N , where N is the principal quantum number (Table 6.1) and thus
have the same parity. This is not true for the Coulomb potential, where states
</p>
<p>with even and odd values of l may be degenerate [see the last equation of (5.12)].
</p>
<p>&bull; The energies of the Coulomb potential are represented in Fig. 6.1, while those of
</p>
<p>the harmonic potential have the same pattern as in Fig. 3.2. The eigenvalues of
</p>
<p>the former display an accumulation point at E1 D 0. They are equidistant in the
harmonic oscillator case.
</p>
<p>2Solutions for the Coulomb potential applying matrix algebra can be found in [39].</p>

<p>96 6 Three-Dimensional Hamiltonian Problems
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.1 Coulomb potential and its eigenvalues. The dimensionless variable u D r=a0 has been
used
</p>
<p>We have verified the commonly made statement that the Schrödinger equation
</p>
<p>is exactly soluble for the two central potentials treated in this section. In fact the
</p>
<p>two Schrödinger equations are related by a simple change of independent variable
</p>
<p>r ! r2, if the energy and the strength of the potential are swapped and the orbital
angular momentum is rescaled (Problem 8) [40]. Thus, the Schrödinger equations
</p>
<p>corresponding to the Coulomb and three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential
</p>
<p>constitute only one soluble quantum mechanical central problem, not two.
</p>
<p>The harmonic oscillator potential is also separable in Cartesian coordinates. As
</p>
<p>an exercise, derive the degeneracies using the Cartesian solution and check the
</p>
<p>results against those appearing in the last column of Table 6.1.
</p>
<p>While the Coulomb potential is an essential tool for the systematic description
</p>
<p>of atomic spectra, the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator plays a similar role
</p>
<p>for the nuclear spectra. This similitude is remarkable in view of the very different
</p>
<p>constituents and interactions that are present in both systems (Sect. 7.3).
</p>
<p>6.1.2 Rydberg Atoms
</p>
<p>The set of degenerate single particle levels constitutes a shell (Sect. 7.3). Since all
</p>
<p>the magnetic substates are filled up in a closed shell, this system displays spherical
</p>
<p>symmetry. Alkali atoms have one electron outside closed shells. Their spectrum
</p>
<p>shows to a large extent the characteristic features of single-particle motion, the effect
</p>
<p>of the closed shell electrons being almost totally limited to screen the nuclear charge.
</p>
<p>Rydberg atoms are alkali atoms excited to states with large quantum number n D
O.50/, carrying an orbital angular momentum l D n � 1 with projection ml D l .</p>

<p>resembles a tire. In fact, it is the closest that one can get to the circular orbits of
</p>
<p>the old Bohr atomic model (see Problem 14). The azimuthal angle � is completely
</p>
<p>unspecified, as required by Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainty principle. See also Problem 14
</p>
<p>and Problem 14 in Chap. 9.
</p>
<p>The coupling with other degenerate states (such as ϕn;n�2;n�2) can become
sufficiently small by making use of an electric field along the direction of the
</p>
<p>angular momentum (Stark effect), which destroys this degeneracy (see Problem 12,
</p>
<p>Chap. 8).
</p>
<p>Rydberg atoms with 40 &lt; n &lt; 60 are presently used to verify quantum
</p>
<p>mechanical properties that were discussed by means of thought experiments during
</p>
<p>most of the last century (Sect. 12.3.3). They are also candidates to play the role of

<p>the spin. In the second set, the moduli of the orbital angular momentum and the spin
</p>
<p>remain as good quantum numbers, to be accompanied by jm, associated with the
</p>
<p>modulus and z-projection of the total angular momentum OJ D OLC OS .
The Coulomb interaction is the strongest force acting inside an atom, and yields
</p>
<p>adequate results for many purposes. However, the experimental spectrum displays
</p>
<p>small shifts in energy associated with values of j . Another (weaker) force that is
</p>
<p>present in the atom is provided by the interaction between the magnetic moment of
</p>
<p>the spin and the magnetic field produced by the orbital motion of the electron3:
</p>
<p>OVso D vso OS � OL; (6.12)
</p>
<p>where we have approximated the radial factor by a constant vso.
</p>
<p>Suppose we sit on the electron. We see the charged nucleus orbiting around us.
</p>
<p>The current associated with this moving charged nucleus produces a magnetic field
</p>
<p>at the location of the electron. The OS � OL term can be interpreted as the interaction
</p>
<p>between the spin magnetic moment of the electron and this magnetic field.
</p>
<p>There are additional terms, the hyperfine interactions, arising from the interaction
</p>
<p>between the nuclear and the electron spins. Although they are even smaller, they
</p>
<p>produce a splitting of the ground state of the hydrogen atom with astrophysical
</p>
<p>importance [which the interaction (6.12) does not].
</p>
<p>The radial term Rnr l has been dropped in the present section, since the spin&ndash;orbit
</p>
<p>interaction (6.12) does not affect the radial part of the wave function.
</p>
<p>The spin&ndash;orbit interaction satisfies the commutation relations
</p>
<p>Œ OVso; OL2&#141; D Œ OVso; OS2&#141; D Œ OVso; OJ 2&#141; D Œ OVso; OJz&#141; D 0; (6.13)
</p>
<p>while Œ OVso; OLz&#141; &curren; 0, Œ OVso; OSz&#141; &curren; 0. Bearing in mind this property, different
procedures &ndash; already developed in these notes &ndash; may be applied to incorporate the
</p>
<p>interaction (6.12).
</p>
<p>1. The interaction is not diagonal within the set of eigenstates of the projections
</p>
<p>of the angular momenta (6.10). Since OVso commutes with OJz, the spin&ndash;orbit
interaction conserves the total projection m D ml C ms and thus gives rise to
matrices of order 2 which may be diagonalized according to Sect. 3.2.
</p>
<p>3Criteria which are frequently used to construct interactions involving pure quantum variables are
</p>
<p>(1) simplicity and (2) invariance under transformations, such as rotations, parity and time-reversal
</p>
<p>operations. The interaction (6.12) satisfies all these criteria. Moreover, it may also be obtained in
</p>
<p>the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation.</p>

</p>
<p>the projectile is collimated, accelerated and collimated again. It collides with the target in the form
</p>
<p>of a plane wave. It is subsequently scattered as a spherical wave, within a solid angle that makes
</p>
<p>an angle � with the direction of incidence</p>

<p>j&permil;.r/j2 must be proportional to 1=r2 to conserve probability (see Problem 11). The

</p>
<p>Expression (6.16) constitutes a generalization of the boundary conditions discussed
</p>
<p>at the beginning of Sect. 4.5 to the three-dimensional case.
</p>
<p>6.3.2 Expansion in Partial Waves
</p>
<p>As in the case of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the free particle problem
</p>
<p>admits solutions in both Cartesian and polar coordinates. The solutions to the

</p>
<p>where jl and nl are Bessel and Neumann functions, respectively (see Sect. 6.5*).
</p>
<p>The eigenstates (6.17) constitute a complete set. Our immediate task is to construct
</p>
<p>the most general linear combination which asymptotically yields (6.16). We first

</p>
<p>�.�/ D a2; � D 4�a2: (6.25)
</p>
<p>The scattering is spherically symmetric and the total cross section is four times
</p>
<p>the area seen by classical particles in a head-on collision. This quantum result also
</p>
<p>appears in optics and is characteristic of long-wavelength scattering. The fact that �
</p>
<p>is the total surface area of the sphere is interpreted by saying that the waves &ldquo;feel&rdquo;
</p>
<p>all this area.
</p>
<p>Some features of scattering theory deserve to be stressed:
</p>
<p>&bull; The classical distance of closest approach to the z-axis of a particle with orbital
</p>
<p>angular momentum &bdquo;l and energy E is l=k. Therefore, a classical particle is not
scattered if l &gt; ka. A similar feature appears in quantum mechanics, since the
</p>
<p>first and largest maximum of jl .kr/ lies approximately at r D l=k. Thus, for
l &gt; ka, the maximum occurs where the potential vanishes: the largest value of l
</p>
<p>to be included is of order ka.
</p>
<p>&bull; The calculation of the probability current (4.18) with wave function (6.16)
</p>
<p>should yield interference terms in the whole space. They would be nonphys-
</p>
<p>ical consequences of assuming an infinite plane wave for the incident beam.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>102 6 Three-Dimensional Hamiltonian Problems
</p>
<p>In practice, the beam is collimated and, as a consequence, the incident plane
</p>
<p>wave and the scattered wave are well separated, except in the forward direction
</p>
<p>(Fig. 6.2). On the other hand, in most experimental arrangements, the opening of
</p>
<p>the collimator is sufficiently large to ensure that there are no measurable effects
</p>
<p>of the uncertainty principle due to collimation (see Problem 12 of Chap. 2).
</p>
<p>&bull; Interference in the forward direction between the incident plane wave and the
</p>
<p>scattered wave gives rise to the important relation

<p>(6.26) (optical theorem) is very general and is not restricted to scattering theory.
</p>
<p>&bull; The previous description of a scattering experiment is made in the center of mass
</p>
<p>coordinate system. We must therefore use the projectile&ndash;target reduced mass and
</p>
<p>the energy for the relative motion to determine the value of k. Moreover, there
</p>
<p>is a geometrical transformation between the scattering angles � and �lab because
</p>
<p>the two systems of reference move relative to each other with the velocity of the
</p>
<p>center of mass.
</p>
<p>6.4* Solutions to the Coulomb and Oscillator Potentials
</p>
<p>The hydrogen atom constitutes a two-body problem which can be transformed to
</p>
<p>a one-body form by changing to the center of mass frame. As a consequence,
</p>
<p>the reduced mass for relative motion should be used [as will be done in (8.22)].
</p>
<p>However, for the sake of simplicity, we ignore the motion of the nucleus here, since
</p>
<p>it is much heavier than the electron.
</p>
<p>It is always helpful to work with dimensionless variables, as in (4.22). In the case
</p>
<p>of the hydrogen atom, the natural length is the Bohr radius (Table A.1). Thus, one

</p>
<p>Many-Body Problems
</p>
<p>So far, we have discussed only one-particle problems. We now turn our attention to
</p>
<p>cases in which more than one particle is present.
</p>
<p>In the first place, we stress the fact that if OH D OH.1/C OH.2/, where OH.1/ and
OH.2/ refer to different degrees of freedom (in particular, to different particles), and
</p>
<p>if OH.1/ϕa.1/ D Eaϕa.1/ and OH.2/ϕb.2/ D Ebϕb.2/, then

</p>
<p>In the second place, we note that the distinction between identical particles is
</p>
<p>prevented in quantum physics by Heisenberg indeterminacy (unless they are wide
</p>
<p>apart). The quantum treatment of identical particles requires a new principle &ndash; the
</p>
<p>Pauli Principle &ndash; which is presented in Sect. 7.1. Particles can be either fermions or
</p>
<p>bosons.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we deal with many-body problems that are amenable to an
</p>
<p>independent-particle description. Central potentials in atomic and nuclear physics,
</p>
<p>electron gas and periodic potentials in solid state physics are fermion problems to
</p>
<p>be treated with methods developed in Chap. 6 and Sects. 4.4 and 4.6&#142;. Problems
</p>
<p>involving phonons in lattices and condensation of bosons are dealt with by means
</p>
<p>of generalizations of the harmonic oscillator solution (Sect. 3.3.1). An exception
</p>
<p>is represented by the fractional Hall effect. Rather than presenting an overview of
</p>
<p>these many-body fields, we restrict ourselves to illustrate the quantum formalism
</p>
<p>with relevant applications. However, even this restricted framework allows us to
</p>
<p>introduce some of the most spectacular discoveries of the recent decades, which
</p>
<p>are based on quantum mechanics and are (or may become) cornerstones of present
</p>
<p>and future technologies: transistors, quantum dots, Bose&ndash;Einstein condensation and
</p>
<p>quantum Hall effects.

<p>110 7 Many-Body Problems
</p>
<p>7.1 The Pauli Principle
</p>
<p>Let us now consider the case of two identical particles, 1 and 2. Two particles are
</p>
<p>identical if their interchange, in any physical operator, leaves the operator invariant:
</p>
<p>Œ OP12; OQ.1; 2/&#141; D 0; (7.2)
</p>
<p>where OP12 is the operator corresponding to the interchange process 1 $ 2.
As a consequence, the eigenstates of OQ may be simultaneous eigenstates of OP12
(Sect. 2.6.1). The operator OP 212 must have the single eigenvalue 1, since the system
is left invariant by interchanging the particles twice. Thus the two eigenvalues
</p>
<p>of the operator OP12 are ˙1. The eigenstates are said to be symmetric (C1) or
antisymmetric (�1) under the interchange of particles 1$ 2.
</p>
<p>Consider two orthogonal single-particle states ϕp;ϕq which may be, in particular,
eigenstates of a Hamiltonian. We construct the four two-body states by distributing
</p>
<p>the two particles in the two single-particle states. The symmetric combinations are
</p>
<p>&permil;.C/pp D ϕp.1/ϕp.2/; (7.3)

</p>
<p>: (7.6)
</p>
<p>The states (7.5) and (7.6) are called entangled states, meaning that they are not
</p>
<p>simply written as a component of the tensor product of the state vectors of particle
</p>
<p>1 and particle 2 (see Chap. 12).
</p>
<p>The average distance between two entangled identical particles is

<p>(7.7)
</p>
<p>where the subscripts .˙/ denote symmetric and antisymmetric states. The first
three terms correspond to the average &ldquo;classical&rdquo; distance which is obtained if state
</p>
<p>functions of the type ϕp.1/ϕq.2/ are used. According to (7.7), this classical distance
may be decreased for entangled particles in symmetric states and increased if they
</p>
<p>are in antisymmetric states. Therefore, the symmetry induces correlations between
</p>
<p>identical particles, even in the absence of residual interacting forces.
</p>
<p>We now generalize the construction of symmetric and antisymmetric states to �
</p>
<p>identical particles. Let OPb denote the operator that performs one of the �Š possible</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.1 The Pauli Principle 111
</p>
<p>permutations. It can be shown that this operator may be written as a product of two-
</p>
<p>body permutations OPij . Although this decomposition is not unique, the parity of the
number �b of such permutations is. We construct the operators

<p>.�1/�b OPb : (7.8)
</p>
<p>Acting with the operator OS on a state of � identical particles produces a symmetric
state, while acting with OA produces an antisymmetric state.
</p>
<p>A new quantum principle has to be added to those listed in Chap. 2:
</p>
<p>Principle 4. There are only two kinds of particles in nature1: bosons described by
</p>
<p>symmetric state vectors and fermions described by antisymmetric state vectors.
</p>
<p>As long as the Hamiltonian is totally symmetric in the particle variables, its
</p>
<p>eigenstates may be labeled with their properties under the interchange of two
</p>
<p>particles (symmetry or antisymmetry). According to Principle 4, many otherwise
</p>
<p>possible states are eliminated. For instance, the only two-body fermion state that
</p>
<p>can be found in nature is (7.6).
</p>
<p>All known particles with half-integer values of spin are fermions (electrons,
</p>
<p>muons, protons, neutrons, neutrinos, etc.). All known particles with integer spin
</p>
<p>are bosons2 (photons, mesons, etc.).
</p>
<p>Moreover, every composite object has a total angular momentum, which can
</p>
<p>be viewed as the composite particle spin, and which is obtained according to the
</p>
<p>addition rules of Sect. 5.3.1. If this spin has a half-integer value, the object behaves
</p>
<p>like a fermion, whereas a composite system with an integer value of the spin acts as
</p>
<p>a boson. For instance, He3 is a fermion (two protons and one neutron), while He4 is
</p>
<p>a boson (an &rsquo;-particle, with two protons and two neutrons), in spite of the fact that
</p>
<p>both isotopes have the same chemical properties.
</p>
<p>Let us distribute � identical bosons into a set of single-particle states ϕp and
denote by np the number of times that the single-particle state p is repeated. The np
are called occupation numbers. To construct the symmetrized �-body state vector,
</p>
<p>we start from the product
</p>
<p>&permil;pq���r .1; 2; : : : ; �/
</p>
<p>D ϕp.1/ϕp.2/ 	 	 	ϕp.np/ϕq.np C 1/ϕq.np C 2/ 	 	 	ϕq.np C nq/ 	 	 	ϕr .�/
</p>
<p>D ϕ.np/p ϕ.nq/q 	 	 	ϕ.nr /r ; (7.9)
</p>
<p>1For the last 20 years it has been understood that, although this postulate holds true in our three-
</p>
<p>dimensional world, there is a whole range of intermediate possibilities &ndash; anyons &ndash; between bosons
</p>
<p>and fermions, in two dimensions. In some cases there are surface layers a few atoms thick in which
</p>
<p>the concept of anyons is realized, as in the fractional quantum Hall effect (Sect. 7.6.2&#142;).
2Pauli produced a demonstration of this relation between spin and statistics which involved many
</p>
<p>complications of quantum field theory. Feynman&rsquo;s challenge that an elementary proof of the spin-
</p>
<p>statistics theorem be provided has not yet been answered.</p>

operator OS . The final state is
</p>
<p>&permil;np;nq ;:::;nr .1; 2; : : : ; �/ D N OS&permil;pq���r .1; 2; : : : ; �/; (7.10)
</p>
<p>where N is a normalization constant. The occupation numbers label the states.
</p>
<p>There are no restrictions on the number of bosons in a given single-boson state.
</p>
<p>For instance, in the two-particle case, the possible symmetric state vectors are (7.3),
</p>
<p>(7.4) and (7.5).
</p>
<p>We may also characterize the state by using the occupation numbers in the case
</p>
<p>of fermions. The procedure for constructing the antisymmetric state is the same, but
</p>
<p>for the application of the operator OA instead of OS. However, the results are different,
in the sense that occupation numbers must be 0 or 1. Otherwise the state vector
</p>
<p>would not change its sign under the exchange of two particles occupying the same
</p>
<p>state. The antisymmetrization principle requires that fermions should obey Pauli&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>exclusion principle [42]: &ldquo;If there is an electron in the atom for which these [four]
</p>
<p>quantum numbers have definite values, then the state is occupied, full, and no more
</p>
<p>electrons are allowed in.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>A widely used representation of the states (7.9) and (7.11), in terms of creation
</p>
<p>and annihilation operators, is given in Sect. 7.8&#142;.
</p>
<p>The possibility of placing many bosons in a single (symmetric) state gives rise
</p>
<p>to phase transitions, with important theoretical and conceptual implications that are
</p>
<p>illustrated for the case of the Bose&ndash;Einstein condensation (Sect. 7.5&#142;). Even more

<p>spectacular consequences appear in the fermion case.3 Some of them will be treated

<p>later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>3To reconcile the successes of the (fermion) quark model with the requirement that the total wave
</p>
<p>function be antisymmetric, it is necessary to hypothesize that each quark comes into three different
</p>
<p>species, which are labeled by the colors red, green and blue. Baryon wave functions may thus be

<p>7.2 Two-Electron Problems 113
</p>
<p>7.2 Two-Electron Problems
</p>
<p>Let us consider the case of the He atom. For the moment, we disregard the
</p>
<p>interaction between the two electrons. The lowest available single-particle states
</p>
<p>for the two electrons are the ϕ100 12ms
, ϕ200 12ms
</p>
<p>and ϕ21ml 12ms
states, where we use the
</p>
<p>same representation as in (6.10).
</p>
<p>This problem involves four angular momenta: the two orbital and the two spin
</p>
<p>angular momenta. The two orbital angular momenta and the two spins may be
</p>
<p>coupled first4 ( OL D OL1 C OL2 and OS D OS 1 C OS 2). Subsequently, the addition of
the total orbital and total spin angular momenta yields the total angular momentum
OJ D OLC OS .
</p>
<p>The spin part of the state vector may carry spin 1 or 0. We obtain the
</p>
<p>corresponding states &brvbar;sms by using the coupling given in (5.67), with j1 D j2 D 1=2.
The (three) two-spin states with spin 1 are symmetric, while the state with spin 0 is
</p>
<p>antisymmetric. Thus,

<p>(7.12)
</p>
<p>We now consider different occupation numbers for the two electrons:
</p>
<p>1. The two electrons occupy the lowest orbit ϕ100 12ms
. In this case, the spatial part
</p>
<p>is the same for both electrons and, thus, the state vector is necessarily spatially
</p>
<p>symmetric. Therefore the symmetric spin state with spin 1 is excluded by the
</p>
<p>exclusion principle. Only the (entangled) state with zero spin can exist.
</p>
<p>2. One electron occupies the lowest level ϕ100 12ms
and the other, the next level
</p>
<p>ϕ200 12ms
. In this case, the difference in the radial wave functions allows us to
</p>
<p>construct both a symmetric and an antisymmetric state for the spatial part of the
</p>
<p>wave function [(7.5) and (7.6), respectively]. Both spatial states carry l D 0.
Two total states are now allowed by the Pauli principle: the combination of the
</p>
<p>symmetric spatial part with the antisymmetric spin state and vice versa. The (so
</p>
<p>far neglected) interaction between the electrons breaks the degeneracy between
</p>
<p>these two allowed total states: according to (7.7), two electrons in a spatially
</p>
<p>antisymmetric state are further apart than in a symmetric state. They thus feel less
</p>
<p>4There is an alternative coupling scheme in which the orbital and spin angular momenta are first
</p>
<p>coupled to yield the angular momentum of each particle: OJ i D OLi C OS i (i D 1; 2), as in (6.11).
Subsequently, the two angular momenta are coupled together: OJ D OJ 1 C OJ 2. The two coupling
schemes give rise to two different sets of basis states.</p>

</p>
<p>3. One electron occupies the lowest level ϕ100 12ms
and the other, the level ϕ21ml 12ms
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>It is left for the reader to treat this case as an exercise. He or she may follow
</p>
<p>the same procedure as in the previous example, bearing in mind that the orbital
</p>
<p>angular momentum no longer vanishes.

<p>7.3 Periodic Tables
</p>
<p>7.3.1 The Atomic Case
</p>
<p>The attraction exerted by the nuclear center, proportional to Ze2, allows us to
</p>
<p>implement a central-field description for atomic systems displaying more than
</p>
<p>one electron. However, the Hamiltonian also includes the Coulomb repulsion
</p>
<p>between electrons. This interaction is weaker (since it is only proportional to e2),
</p>
<p>but an electron experiences Z � 1 such repulsions. We can nonetheless take them
into account to a good approximation by modifying the central field because:
</p>
<p>&bull; Electrons from occupied levels cannot be scattered to other occupied levels (Pauli
</p>
<p>principle) and when scattered to empty levels have to overcome the gap between
</p>
<p>the energy of the occupied level and the energy of the last filled state, thus
</p>
<p>reducing the effectiveness of the residual interaction.
</p>
<p>&bull; The electric fields created by electrons lying outside a radius r 0 tend to cancel for
radius r &lt; r 0, due to the well-known compensation between the field intensity
(/ 1=r2) and the solid angle (/ r2).
Although the optimum choice of the single-particle central potential constitutes
</p>
<p>a more difficult problem (see Sect. 8.6.1&#142; on the Hartree&ndash;Fock approximation), it is

</p>
<p>presented in Fig. 7.1, where the nomenclature of Table 5.2 is used. The set of energy
</p>
<p>levels which are close to each other is called a shell. In a closed shell, all magnetic
</p>
<p>substates are occupied.
</p>
<p>The ground state of a given atom is determined by successively filling the
</p>
<p>different single-particle states until the Z electrons are exhausted. A closed shell
</p>
<p>carries zero orbital and zero spin angular momenta (see Problem 7). A closed shell
</p>
<p>displays neither loose electrons nor holes, and thus constitutes a quite stable system.
</p>
<p>This fact explains the properties of noble gases in the Mendeleev chart, for which
</p>
<p>Z D 2, 10, 18, 36, 54 and 86 (Fig. 7.1). The angular momenta (including the
magnetic momenta), the degree of stability, the nature of chemical bonds and, in
</p>
<p>fact, all the chemical properties are determined by the outer electrons lying in the
</p>
<p>last, unfilled shell, a spectacular consequence of the Pauli principle.
</p>
<p>The electron configuration of an atom with many electrons is specified by the
</p>
<p>occupation of the single-particle states of the unfilled shell. For instance, the lowest
</p>
<p>configuration in the Mg atom, with Z D 12, is5 .3s/2. Configurations .3s/.3p/ and
.3p/2 lie close in energy.
</p>
<p>In the atomic case the total single-particle angular momentum j is not usually
</p>
<p>specified (as it was not in Sect. 7.2), because the strength of the spin&ndash;orbit coupling
</p>
<p>is small relative to the electron repulsions. However, for heavier elements and inner
</p>
<p>shells, the quantum numbers .l; j / become relevant once again.
</p>
<p>5The first number is the Coulomb principal quantum number; the orbital angular momentum
</p>
<p>follows the notation of Table 5.2; the exponent (2) denotes the number of particles with the previous
</p>
<p>two quantum numbers.</p>

<p>7.3.2 The Nuclear Case
</p>
<p>Let us now consider the nuclear table. A nucleus has A nucleons, of which N
</p>
<p>are neutrons and Z are protons. Nuclei with the same A are called isobars; with
</p>
<p>the same N , isotones and with the same Z, isotopes. In spite of the fact that there
</p>
<p>is no ab initio attraction from a nuclear center and the internuclear force is as
</p>
<p>complicated as it can be, the Pauli principle is still effective: the starting point for
</p>
<p>the description of most nuclear properties is a shell model. For systems with short-
</p>
<p>range interactions, a realistic central potential follows the probability density, which
</p>
<p>in the nuclear case has a Woods&ndash;Saxon shape, w.r/ (Fig. 7.3). A strong spin&ndash;orbit
</p>
<p>interaction must be included on the surface, with an opposite sign to the atomic case.

<p>It should be stressed that, unlike the hydrogen case, the description of heavier
</p>
<p>atoms/nuclei in terms of a central field is, at best, a semi-quantitative approximation:
</p>
<p>one-body terms can never completely replace two-body interactions. The approxi-
</p>
<p>mation is more reliable for systems that have one more particle (or hole) than a
</p>
<p>closed shell. In fact, the single-particle spectrum can be determined by transferring
</p>
<p>one nucleon to the double closed shells, as in (d,p) reactions. For instance, the
</p>
<p>spectroscopic factor (the ratio between experimental and predicted cross sections)
</p>
<p>should be S D 1 if the single-particle states are pure, without admixtures of core
excitations.
</p>
<p>Recently, single-particle levels above the double closed shell nucleus Z D 50,
N D 82 (mean lifetime of 40 s) have been measured [43]. Since it is not possible
to make a target with such a short-lived nucleus, a beam of Sn132 has been runned
</p>
<p>upon a deuterium target. The Sn133 levels are disentangled through properties of the
</p>
<p>scattered protons (intensities, energies, angular distributions). The results are given
</p>
<p>in Table 7.1 and agree, within expectations, with predictions from Fig. 7.2.

</p>
<p>In the simplest possible model of a metal, electrons move independently of each
</p>
<p>other. The electrostatic attraction of the crystalline lattice prevents them from
</p>
<p>escaping when they approach the surface. The electron gas results of Sect. 4.4.1
</p>
<p>may be easily generalized to the three-dimensional case. The wave states are given
</p>
<p>as the product of three one-dimensional solutions (4.43)

</p>
<p>the Fermi momentum, and its energy �F � &bdquo;2k2F=2M , the Fermi energy. At zero
energy, the levels with jkj � kF are occupied pairwise and those above are empty.
Since we are interested in the large-volume limit, the levels are very close together

</p>
<p>We now explore some thermal properties of an electron gas. If the electrons
</p>
<p>would obey classical mechanics, each of them should gain an energy of the order of
</p>
<p>kBT in going from absolute zero to the temperature T . The total thermal energy per

</p>
<p>7.4.2&#142; Band Structure of Crystals
</p>
<p>Although the electron gas model explains many properties of solids, it fails to
</p>
<p>account for electrical conductivity, which can vary by a factor of 1030 between good
</p>
<p>insulators and good conductors.
</p>
<p>A qualitative understanding of conductors and insulators may be obtained from
</p>
<p>a simple generalization of the band model described in Sect. 4.6&#142;. As a consequence
</p>
<p>of the motion of single electrons in a periodic array of ions, the possible individual
</p>
<p>energies are grouped into allowed bands. Each band contains 2N levels, where N
</p>
<p>is the number of ions, and the factor 2 is due to spin.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.4 Motion of Electrons in Solids 121
</p>
<p>According to the Pauli principle, we obtain the ground state by successively
</p>
<p>filling the individual single-particle states of the allowed bands. The last filled band
</p>
<p>is called the valence band. If we place the solid within an electric field, the electrons
</p>
<p>belonging to a valence band cannot be accelerated by a small electric field, since
</p>
<p>they would tend to occupy other states of the same band, which are already occupied.
</p>
<p>Much like the case of closed shells in atoms and nuclei, electrons in a valence band
</p>
<p>constitute an inert system which do not contribute to thermal or electrical properties.
</p>
<p>A solid consisting only of filled bands is an insulator. The insulation gets better
</p>
<p>as the distance &#129;E between the upper valence band and the next (empty) band
</p>
<p>increases.
</p>
<p>By contrast, electrons in partially filled bands can easily absorb energy from an
</p>
<p>applied electric field. Such a band is called a conduction band.
</p>
<p>The previous considerations are valid for T D 0. In solids which are insulators
at T D 0, the thermal motion increases the energy of the electrons by an amount
kBT . As the temperature increases, some electrons belonging to the valence band
</p>
<p>may jump to the conduction band. This system is a semiconductor. The conductivity
</p>
<p>varies as exp.�&#129;E=kBT /.
The existence of conductors, semiconductors and insulators is a consequence
</p>
<p>of the Pauli principle. Another consequence arises from the fact that the electrons
</p>
<p>which jump to the conduction band leave empty states called holes in the valence
</p>
<p>band. Other electrons of the same valence band may occupy these holes, leaving
</p>
<p>other holes behind them. Thus there is a current, due to the electrons of the valence
</p>
<p>band, which is produced by the holes. The holes carry a positive charge, because
</p>
<p>they represent the absence of an electron.
</p>
<p>7.4.3&#142; Transistors
</p>
<p>Semiconductors have become key parts of electronic circuits and optical applica-
</p>
<p>tions in modern electronic industry, due to the fact that their electrical conductivity
</p>
<p>can be greatly altered by means of external stimuli (voltage, photon flux, etc.) and
</p>
<p>by the introduction of selected impurities (doping).
</p>
<p>There are different kinds of transistors, each one having different applications.
</p>
<p>Here we outline one of them, the metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor
</p>
<p>(MOSFET).
</p>
<p>We denote by n a semiconductor with electrons at the conduction band and by p,
</p>
<p>one with holes at the valence band (Sect. 7.4.2&#142;). As most transistors, the MOSFET
</p>
<p>consists of a sandwich made up by three semiconductors, the middle one being of
</p>
<p>different type than the other two (Fig. 7.4). On top there is an insulator followed by
</p>
<p>a metallic layer. If the control voltage applied between the metal and the bottom of
</p>
<p>the transistor vanishes, there is no electron output current flowing from left to right.
</p>
<p>However, if the bottom is at a negative potential, the positive free charges (holes)
</p>
<p>get attracted to it, and the output current flows on top, below the insulator layer. The
</p>
<p>output power can be much greater than at the control circuit.</p>

</p>
<p>Weak voltage signals, arising from an antenna, can replace the control voltage
</p>
<p>and get amplified by a transistor. This is the role of transistors at your TV set. The
</p>
<p>MOSFET can also be used as a classical bit of your PC, the control voltage allowing
</p>
<p>(or not) the current to flow. They also play the role of switches.
</p>
<p>Because of their flexibility, reliability and low cost, transistors are the building
</p>
<p>blocks of modern electronic circuits. They are used either as isolated units or as parts
</p>
<p>of integrated circuits (chips). Transistors were invented by John Bardeen, Walter
</p>
<p>Brattain and William Shockley at the Bell Labs in 1947.
</p>
<p>7.4.4&#142; Phonons in Lattice Structures
</p>
<p>Up to now we have treated the ions as fixed in space at positions Ri , giving rise to
</p>
<p>the crystal lattice structure. This is a consequence of the much larger ion mass MI
relative to the electron mass M . Subsequently we allow for a small fluctuation ui in
</p>
<p>the coordinate ri D Ri C ui of the i ion (Born&ndash;Oppenheimer approximation). For
the sake of simplicity, we make the following approximations:
</p>
<p>� A linear, spinless chain of N ions separated by the distance d .
� Only terms up to quadratic order in ui are kept in the ion&ndash;ion potential. Linear
</p>
<p>terms in the fluctuations vanish due to the equilibrium condition and the constant,
</p>
<p>equilibrium term will be dropped.
</p>
<p>� Only interactions between nearest neighbors are considered.

</p>
<p>This method of uncoupling constitutes a particular application of the random-
</p>
<p>phase approximation, a standard procedure in many-body physics (Sect. 8.6.2&#142;).
</p>
<p>7.4.5&#142; Quantum Dots
</p>
<p>Quantum dots, also called artificial atoms, are small regions (from 1 to about
</p>
<p>100 nm; 1 nm = 10�9 m) of one semiconductor material buried in another
semiconductor material with a larger energy gap &#129;E (Sect. 7.4.2&#142;). They are made
</p>
<p>up by roughly 106 atoms. In addition, quantum dots contain a controlled number of
</p>
<p>electrons that display atomic-like spectra with very sharp discrete lines (like natural
</p>
<p>atoms do). However, unlike natural atoms, their energies can be strongly influenced
</p>
<p>by the size of the dot and other interactions with the surroundings.
</p>
<p>Electrons in a layer of GaAs are sandwiched between two layers of insulating
</p>
<p>AlGaAs, acting as tunnel barriers. One of these barriers is connected to the source
</p>
<p>lead, the other to the drain lead. The entire structure may also be linked to an
</p>
<p>insulated metal electrode which fixes the bias potential Vg.
</p>
<p>The forces acting on the electrons inside the dot are difficult to estimate.
</p>
<p>However, it is possible to apply the concept of a central confining potential as in
</p>
<p>Sect. 7.3. When an electron enters or leaves the quantum dot there is a noticeable
</p>
<p>change in the capacitance of the dot, which can be measured. In Fig. 7.5 the
</p>
<p>capacitance is plotted against the voltage Vg. Each maxima denotes the loading
</p>
<p>of an additional electron to the dot. The first two electrons fill the lowest, spin
</p>
<p>degenerate states. The next shell displays four equally spaced maxima, which is
</p>
<p>consistent with a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions [Problem 13 of
</p>
<p>Chap. 6 and (7.45)]. Indeed, many properties of quantum dots can be accounted for
</p>
<p>by means of a parabolic confinement in the xy plane and assuming an oblate shape
</p>
<p>for the dot.</p>

</p>
<p>levels of a quantum dot are

<p>drain
</p>
<p>source
</p>
<p>Being finite-size systems, quantum dots can display shell effects similar to
</p>
<p>those discussed in Sect. 7.3. One can obtain the energy spectrum by measuring the
</p>
<p>tunneling current. The Fermi level in the source rises proportionally to a voltage Vsd
relatively to the drain and to the energy levels of the dot. Additional current flows
</p>
<p>each time that the Fermi energy of the source rises above a level of the dot. Thus
</p>
<p>energy levels are measured by the voltages at which there are peaks in the curve
</p>
<p>representing d I=dVsd against Vsd, where I is the tunneling current (Fig. 7.6).
</p>
<p>Energy levels vary also in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the
</p>
<p>GaAs layer. Very strong fields may produce Landau levels (Sect. 7.6.1&#142;).
</p>
<p>Quantum dots also display spin filtering capabilities for generating or detecting
</p>
<p>spin-polarized currents [45]. In one of such devices the spin state is mapped into a
</p>
<p>charge state as follows: the splitting between the energy levels is made so large that
</p>
<p>only the ground state can be occupied. Moreover, Coulomb repulsion ensures that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.5 Bose&ndash;Einstein Condensation 127
</p>
<p>at most one electron is allowed. A magnetic field lifts the degeneracy between the
</p>
<p>spin-up and spin-down states by an amount larger than the thermal energy. Initially
</p>
<p>the Fermi level �F of an adjacent reservoir lies below the spin-up state and the dot is
</p>
<p>empty. The voltage is then adjusted so �F lies in between the two spin states. Thus an
</p>
<p>electron with spin up remains in the dot, while an electron with spin down leaves the
</p>
<p>dot. Subsequently, the charged state is measured. Once emptied, the dot can receive
</p>
<p>another electron with spin up from the reservoir.
</p>
<p>This device constitutes a modern version of the Stern&ndash;Gerlach apparatus. It joins
</p>
<p>several advances in the electrical control of spins, including electrically controlled
</p>
<p>coupling between spins in quantum dots, quasi-one-dimensional quantum-dot
</p>
<p>arrays, etc. Since such devices could be self-contained in a chip (without the need of
</p>
<p>lasers and other optical elements) they could interface naturally with conventional
</p>
<p>electronic circuits. Thus they may be essential elements in future instrumentation
</p>
<p>for quantum information.
</p>
<p>Another application is based on the emission frequency sensitivity to the size and
</p>
<p>composition of the dot. As a consequence, quantum dots have shown advantages
</p>
<p>over traditional organic dyes in modern biological analysis. They also allow for the
</p>
<p>use of blue lasers in modern DVD players.
</p>
<p>7.5&#142; Bose&ndash;Einstein Condensation
</p>
<p>In 1924, Einstein realized the validity of the fact that as T increases (and remains
</p>
<p>below a critical value Tc), the ground state of a system of bosons (particles at
</p>
<p>rest) remains multiply occupied (see Sect. 7.7&#142;) [46]. Any other single orbital,
</p>
<p>including the orbital of the second lowest energy, will be occupied by a relatively
</p>
<p>negligible number of particles. This effect is called Bose&ndash;Einstein condensation.9
</p>
<p>Its experimental realization was made possible by the development of techniques
</p>
<p>for cooling, trapping and manipulating atoms.10
</p>
<p>In Einstein&rsquo;s original prediction, all bosons were supposed to be slowed down to
</p>
<p>zero momentum, which implies a macroscopic space, according to the uncertainty
</p>
<p>principle. However, any experimental set-up requires some confinement. The
</p>
<p>confining potential in the available magnetic traps for alkali atoms can be safely
</p>
<p>approximated by the quadratic form

10Einstein himself suggested H2 and He
</p>
<p>4 as possible candidates for B&ndash;E condensation. Only in
</p>
<p>1938 the He4 superfluid transition at 2.4 K was interpreted as a transition to the B&ndash;E condensate.
</p>
<p>However, this interpretation was marred by the presence of large residual interactions.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>128 7 Many-Body Problems
</p>
<p>Neglecting the interaction between atoms implies that the Hamiltonian eigenvalues
</p>
<p>have the form (6.31), since we are considering a system composed of a large number
</p>
<p>� of non-interacting bosons. The many-body ground state ϕ.r1; : : : ; r�/ is obtained

</p>
<p>The density distribution then becomes �.r/ D � jϕ0.r/j2. While its value grows
with �, the size of the cloud is independent of � and is fixed by the harmonic
</p>
<p>oscillator length xc (3.28). It is typically of the order of xc � 1 
m in today&rsquo;s
experiments.
</p>
<p>At finite temperatures, particles are thermally distributed among the available
</p>
<p>states. A rough estimate may be obtained by assuming kBT � &bdquo;!. In this limit we
may use a classical Boltzmann distribution

</p>
<p>Therefore, the Bose&ndash;Einstein condensation in harmonic traps appears as a sharp
</p>
<p>peak in the central region of the density distribution. Figure 7.7 displays the density
</p>
<p>for 5,000 non-interacting bosons in a spherical trap at temperature T D 0:9Tc,
where Tc is the critical temperature (see below). The central peak is the condensate,
</p>
<p>superimposed on the broader thermal distribution. The momentum distribution of
</p>
<p>the condensate is also Gaussian, having a width &bdquo;=xc (3.46). The momentum
distribution of the thermal particles is broader, of the order of .kBT /
</p>
<p>1=2. In fact
</p>
<p>these two momentum distributions are also represented by the curves in Fig. 7.7,
</p>
<p>provided the correct units are substituted.
</p>
<p>In 1995, rubidium atoms confined within a magnetic trap were cooled to the
</p>
<p>submicrokelvin regime by laser methods and then by evaporation [48]. The trap was
</p>
<p>suddenly turned off, allowing the atoms to fly away. By taking pictures of the cloud
</p>
<p>after various time delays, a two-dimensional momentum distribution of the atoms
</p>
<p>was constructed. As the temperature was lowered, the familiar Gaussian hump of the
</p>
<p>Maxwell&ndash;Boltzmann distribution was pierced by a rapidly rising sharp peak caused
</p>
<p>by atoms in the ground state of the trap, that is by the condensate.
</p>
<p>By allowing the trap to have cylindrical symmetry, the average momentum
</p>
<p>along the short axis was double that along the other [see the harmonic oscillator
</p>
<p>predictions (3.46)]. In contrast, the momentum distribution is always isotropic for a
</p>
<p>classical gas, unless it is flowing.</p>

The first demonstration of the Bose&ndash;Einstein condensation involved 2,000 atoms.
</p>
<p>Today millions are being condensed.
</p>
<p>Bose&ndash;Einstein condensation is unique because it is the only pure quantum
</p>
<p>mechanical phase transition: it takes place without any interaction between the
</p>
<p>particles. This field is presently full of activity: collective motion, condensation and
</p>
<p>damping times of the condensate, its interaction with light, collision properties, and

<p>effects of the residual interactions are just some of the themes that are currently
</p>
<p>under very intense theoretical and experimental study.

<p>7.6&#142; Quantum Hall Effects
</p>
<p>A planar sample of conductive material is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to
</p>
<p>its surface. An electric current I is made to pass from one end to the other by means
</p>
<p>of a potential VL. The longitudinal resistivity is the ratio RL D VL=I . Because of
the Lorentz force, more electrons accumulate on one side of the sample than on the
</p>
<p>other, thereby producing a measurable voltage VH &ndash; the Hall voltage &ndash; across the
</p>
<p>sample. The ratio RH D VH=I is called the Hall resistivity. It increases linearly with
the magnetic field.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>130 7 Many-Body Problems
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.8 The integer quantum Hall effect appears as plateaus in the Hall resistivity of a sample
</p>
<p>which coincide with the disappearance of the sample&rsquo;s electrical resistivity, as the magnetic field
</p>
<p>strength is varied [51]. (Reproduced with permission from Springer-Verlag)
</p>
<p>However, in 1980 Klaus von Klitzing found that, for samples cooled to within 1 K
</p>
<p>and placed in strong magnetic fields, the Hall resistivity exhibits a series of plateaus,
</p>
<p>i.e. intervals in which the Hall resistivity appears not to vary at all with the magnetic
</p>
<p>field [49]. Figure 7.8 displays a diagram of the measured inverse Hall resistance
</p>
<p>h=e2RH as a function of the density of electrons n times the characteristic area of
</p>
<p>the problem (7.48). The longitudinal resistance is sketched as well. Where the Hall
</p>
<p>resistivity is constant, the longitudinal resistivity practically vanishes. Moreover,
</p>
<p>the resistivity is RH D h=e2n, with an amazing accuracy of order 10�6. Here h is
Planck&rsquo;s constant, e is the electron charge and n is an integer (Fig. 7.8). This is even
</p>
<p>true for samples with different geometries and with different processing histories,
</p>
<p>as well as for a variety of materials. It is the integer quantum Hall effect.
</p>
<p>In 1982 Daniel Tsui, Horst Störmer and Arthur Gossard discovered other plateaus
</p>
<p>at which n has specific fractional values (1/3, 2/5 and 3/7) [50]. This is the fractional
</p>
<p>quantum Hall effect.

<p>The term proportional to OLz arises from the cross product of the square of the
effective momentum, and the term proportional to OSz arises from (5.22). Since the
change in energy produced by increasing n by one unit is exactly compensated
</p>
<p>by decreasing the orbital angular momentum by one unit of &bdquo;, there are sets of
degenerate states called Landau levels. In particular, the lowest Landau level is made
</p>
<p>up of radial nodeless states and values of ml D �n. It has zero energy, since the
spin term (sz D �&bdquo;=2) compensates exactly for the zero point energy &bdquo;! of the
harmonic oscillator.

</p>
<p>the constant of proportionality between the number of electrons per unit area and
</p>
<p>the strength of the magnetic field depends only on Planck&rsquo;s constant and the charge
</p>
<p>of the electron.
</p>
<p>However, there are impurities and, consequently, the single energy of a Landau
</p>
<p>level is spread out into a band. The states of the band belong to two classes: states
</p>
<p>near the bottom or the top of the band are localized states.13 Near the center of each
</p>
<p>energy band are extended states, each one spreading out over a large space. They
</p>
<p>are the only ones that may carry current.
</p>
<p>At very low temperatures, only states below the Fermi energy are occupied.
</p>
<p>Assume that the Fermi level is at the subband of localized states near the top of some
</p>
<p>Landau band. Now gradually increase the strength of the magnetic field, adjusting
</p>
<p>the current so that the Hall voltage remains constant. Since the number of states per
</p>
<p>unit area is proportional to the applied magnetic field [see (7.48)], the number of
</p>
<p>levels in each Landau state increases proportionately.
</p>
<p>Many of the newly available states will be below the Fermi level, so electrons
</p>
<p>from higher energy localized states will drop to fill them. As a result, the Fermi level
</p>
<p>descends to a lower position. However, as long as it remains in the subband of high-
</p>
<p>energy localized states, all the extended states remain fully occupied. The amount
</p>
<p>of current flowing therefore remains constant and so does the Hall resistivity.
</p>
<p>As the Fermi level descends through the subband of extended states, some of
</p>
<p>them are vacated. The amount of current flowing decreases, while the Hall resistivity
</p>
<p>increases.
</p>
<p>Eventually, the extended states will be emptied and the Fermi level will enter
</p>
<p>the subband of low-energy localized states. If there is at least one full Landau
</p>
<p>band below the Fermi level, the extended states in that band will be able to carry
</p>
<p>a constant current. However, because the extended states in one band have been
</p>
<p>completely emptied, the number of subbands of extended states has been reduced
</p>
<p>by one, and the Hall resistance is larger than it was on the previous plateau. The
</p>
<p>current is proportional to the number of occupied subbands of extended states, and
</p>
<p>on each plateau an integral number of these subbands is filled.
</p>
<p>The second striking feature of the quantized Hall effect is that current flows
</p>
<p>without resistance in the plateau region. Recall that, to dissipate power, an electron
</p>
<p>must make a transition to a state of lower energy, the excess energy being distributed
</p>
<p>within the lattice as vibrations or heat.
</p>
<p>First we examine the regime between two plateaus. The Fermi energy varies
</p>
<p>slightly from point to point: the voltage measured at opposite sides of the sample
</p>
<p>gauges the difference between the Fermi energies at the two points. Thus, an
</p>
<p>electron can find itself in an extended state that is below the local Fermi energy
</p>
<p>in one region of space, but which extends into a region where its energy is above
</p>
<p>the local Fermi energy. The electron would thus be able to drop into a lower level,
</p>
<p>dissipating some energy into the lattice. This sample exhibits electrical resistance.
</p>
<p>13Low (high) energy localized states arise around impurity atoms which have an excess (dearth) of
</p>
<p>positive charge.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.6 Quantum Hall Effects 133
</p>
<p>If the Fermi energy is within the region of energy corresponding to localized
</p>
<p>states, there may also be empty states of lower energy. These states, however, are
</p>
<p>far apart in space, at distances much larger than the localization distance. Electrons
</p>
<p>cannot drop to lower states, and thus they cannot dissipate energy.
</p>
<p>Within this model, localized states also act as a reservoir of electrons, so that, for
</p>
<p>finite ranges of magnetic field strengths, the extended states in each Landau band
</p>
<p>are either completely empty or completely filled. Without the reservoir, the width of
</p>
<p>the regions displaying an integer quantum Hall effect would be vanishingly small.
</p>
<p>Therefore, a relatively simple model of independent electrons, moving under the
</p>
<p>influence of electric and magnetic fields, can account for the main properties of
</p>
<p>the integer quantum Hall effect. This model has some features in common with the
</p>
<p>band structure of metals that explains the existence of conductors and insulators
</p>
<p>(Sect. 7.4.2&#142;).
</p>
<p>The quantized Hall effect enables us to calibrate instruments with extreme
</p>
<p>accuracy as well as to measure fundamental physical constants more precisely than
</p>
<p>ever before.
</p>
<p>7.6.2&#142; Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
</p>
<p>The fractional quantum Hall effect is seen only when a Landau level is partially
</p>
<p>filled. For instance, a plateau is seen when the lowest Landau level is approximately
</p>
<p>one-third full. In this case the Hall resistivity is equal to one-third of the square of
</p>
<p>the electron charge divided by Planck&rsquo;s constant.
</p>
<p>The independent particle model previously used to explain the integer quantum
</p>
<p>Hall effect does not show any special stability when a fraction of the states is filled.
</p>
<p>To explain the fractional quantum Hall effect, we must consider the interaction
</p>
<p>between electrons (like everything associated with open shells).
</p>
<p>It is helpful to write the total wave function of particles moving in a Landau level
</p>

</p>
<p>It is natural to seek a similar formalism which may apply to fermions. A system
</p>
<p>of such particles can be described as a many-particle state vector that changes its
</p>
<p>sign with the interchange of any two particles. Since the required linear combination

<p>of products of one-particle states [Slater determinant (7.11)] can be uniquely
</p>
<p>specified by listing the singly occupied states, the formalism we seek must limit
</p>
<p>the eigenvalues of Onp to 0 and 1.

the exclusion principle. Within this limitation, the eigenstates and energies (7.57) are
</p>
<p>also valid for the case of fermions. Note that an interchange of two fermion creation

<p>operators changes the sign of the eigenststate [as happens for the Slater determinant

<p>Approximate Solutions to Quantum Problems
</p>
<p>The previous chapters may have left the (erroneous) impression that there is
</p>
<p>always an exact (and elegant) mathematical solution for every problem in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. In most cases there is not. One must resort to makeshift approxima-
</p>
<p>tions, numerical solutions or combinations of both. In this chapter we discuss
</p>
<p>approximate methods that are frequently applied: perturbation theory, variational
</p>
<p>procedure, approximate matrix diagonalization, Hartree&ndash;Fock and random phase
</p>
<p>approximations. They are illustrated by means of applications to two-electron
</p>
<p>atoms, molecules, periodic potentials, etc.
</p>
<p>8.1 Perturbation Theory
</p>
<p>The procedure is similar to the one used in celestial mechanics, where the trajectory
</p>
<p>of a comet is first calculated by taking into account only the attraction of the sun.
</p>
<p>The (smaller) effect of planets is included in successive orders of approximation.
</p>
<p>We divide the Hamiltonian OH , which we do not know how to solve exactly, into
two terms. The first term, OH0, is the Hamiltonian of a problem whose solution we
know and which is reasonably close to the original problem; the second term, OV , is
called the perturbation. Thus
</p>
<p>OH D OH0 C � OV ; (8.1)
</p>
<p>OH0ϕ.0/n D E.0/n ϕ.0/n : (8.2)
The perturbation term has been multiplied by a constant � that is supposed to be
</p>
<p>a number less than 1. The constant � is helpful for keeping track of the order
</p>
<p>of magnitude of the different terms of the expansion that underlies the theory.
</p>
<p>Otherwise it has no physical meaning. It is replaced by 1 in the final expressions.
</p>
<p>We solve the eigenvalue equation

<p>that jc.1/p j2 � 1, i.e. the matrix element of the perturbation between two states

<p>This perturbation theory is called the Raleigh&ndash;Schrödinger perturbation theory. Its

<p>taken into account through the replacement in the denominator of the second-

<p>order term (8.10). However, the advantage of reducing the number of terms may
</p>
<p>be compensated by a decrease in the convergence of the perturbation expansion,
</p>
<p>associated with the nature of the partial summations. Moreover, different powers of
</p>
<p>� may be present in many terms of the Brillouin&ndash;Wigner series.
</p>
<p>There is an elegant and useful formulation of perturbation theory conceived
</p>
<p>by Feynman. This uses diagrams carrying both a precise mathematical meaning
</p>
<p>and a description of the processes involved [59]. The &ldquo;finest hour&rdquo; of perturbation
</p>
<p>theory is represented by the calculation of the gyromagnetic electron value to nine

<p>significant figures, using quantum electrodynamics (see Sect. 5.2.2).

<p>The ground state energy of the He atom is calculated using perturbation theory

<p>144 8 Approximate Solutions to Quantum Problems
</p>
<p>8.2 Variational Procedure
</p>
<p>This approximation may be considered as the inverse of the perturbation procedure:
</p>
<p>instead of working with a fixed set of unperturbed states, one guesses a trial state
</p>
<p>&permil;, which may be expanded in terms of the basis set of eigenstates ϕE of the
Hamiltonian (&permil; D

</p>
<p>where E0 is the ground state energy. The state &permil; may depend on some parameter,
</p>
<p>and the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is minimized with respect to this
</p>
<p>parameter. One thus obtains an upper limit for the ground state energy of the system.
</p>
<p>The fact that the energy is an extremum guarantees that if the trial wave function
</p>
<p>is wrong by something of the order of ı, the variational estimate of the energy is off
</p>
<p>by something of the order ı2. So one can be rewarded with a good energy estimate,
</p>
<p>even though the initial wave function may be only a fair guess.

<p>8.3 Ground State of the He Atom
</p>
<p>This three-body problem may be reduced to a two-body problem by again con-
</p>
<p>sidering a very massive nucleus. However, even the remaining problem is difficult
</p>
<p>to solve because of the presence of the Coulomb repulsion V between the two
</p>
<p>electrons. The total Hamiltonian is OH0 C V , where

</p>
<p>Here r12 D jr1 � r2j is the distance between the electrons.
We know how to solve the problem of two electrons moving independently of
</p>
<p>each other in the Coulomb potential of the He nucleus. Because the ground state
</p>
<p>energy of a hydrogen-like atom is proportional to Z2 and there are two electrons,
</p>
<p>the unperturbed energy is 8EH, where EH is the energy of the electron in the H atom.
</p>
<p>The antisymmetrized two-electron state vector of the ground state in the He atom
</p>
<p>is discussed in Sect. 7.2. Using this state, the first-order correction to the energy is

</p>
<p>Therefore, the total energy becomes 5:50EH, which constitutes an improved
</p>
<p>approximation to the experimental result 5:81EH compared with the unperturbed
</p>
<p>value 8EH.
</p>
<p>As mentioned in Sect. 8.2, one may improve the predictions for the ground state
</p>
<p>by a variational calculation. In this case we may write the expectation value of the
</p>
<p>kinetic energy, of the potential energy and the Coulomb repulsion as functions of
</p>
<p>the parameter Z� entering the wave function. The value Z D 2 is kept in the
Hamiltonian:

<p>hϕg:s:jH jϕg:s:iZ� D �2.Z�/2EH C 4ZZ�EH �
5
</p>
<p>4
Z�EH: (8.15)
</p>
<p>Minimization with respect to Z� yields the effective value Z� D 1:69 for He
(instead of 2), which is an indication that the electrons mutually screen the nuclear
</p>
<p>attraction. The final result is hϕg:s:jH jϕg:s:iZD1:69 D 5:69EH, and this is in even
better agreement with the experimental value than the first-order perturbation result.
</p>
<p>To apply the variational procedure to excited states, one must ensure their
</p>
<p>orthogonality with lower energy states, for the resulting value of the minimization
</p>
<p>parameter.
</p>
<p>8.4 Molecules
</p>
<p>Molecules are made up of nuclei and electrons. The theoretical description of this
</p>
<p>many-body system is facilitated by the very different masses of the two constituents,
</p>
<p>which allows us to decouple their respective motions. The procedure is called the
</p>
<p>Born&ndash;Oppenheimer approximation. In principle, it is possible to begin by solving
</p>
<p>the problem of motion of electrons subject to the (static) field of the nuclei and to the
</p>
<p>field of other electrons. In this first step, the nuclear coordinates Ri are treated as
</p>
<p>parameters. Minimization of the energy W.Ri / with respect to these parameters
</p>
<p>yields their equilibrium values. A subsequent step consists in allowing small
</p>
<p>departures of the nuclei from their equilibrium position and using the associated
</p>
<p>increase in the energy W as the restoring force for the oscillatory motion. Finally,
</p>
<p>the molecules may also perform collective rotations without changing the relative
</p>
<p>positions of the electrons and the nuclei.
</p>
<p>8.4.1 Intrinsic Motion: Covalent Binding
</p>
<p>We illustrate the procedure for the case of the molecular hydrogen ion H2
C.

</p>
<p>that the protons are at rest simplifies the Hamiltonian to</p>

</p>
<p>Note that such wave functions are orthogonal only for very large values of R. In
</p>
<p>fact, their overlap is h1j2i D 1 for R D 0.
The requirement of antisymmetry between the two protons must be taken into

<p>account. As in Sect. 7.2, the spin of the two protons may be coupled to 1 (symmetric
</p>
<p>spin states) or to 0 (antisymmetric spin states). The corresponding spatial wave

<p>Since the matrix element in the third line of (8.19) is positive, we conclude that the
</p>
<p>energy corresponding to the spatially symmetric wave function lies lowest. In fact,
</p>
<p>the two curves are plotted in Fig. 8.2. Only the energy corresponding to ϕC displays
a minimum. This may be interpreted as being due to the build-up of the electron

<p>8.4.3 Characteristic Energies

<p>The diatomic molecule is the simplest illustration of a general feature: the breaking

<p>of the spherical symmetry produced by the shape of the intrinsic system generates
</p>
<p>rotational degrees of freedom; if the amount of this breaking is measured by
</p>
<p>a minimization parameter (the distance R0), there appear vibrational degrees of
</p>
<p>freedom around this value.

<p>The intrinsic motion of electrons and the vibrational and rotational motion of

</p>
<p>Since the ratio between the electron and the proton masses M=Mp � 1=2;000
(see Table A.1), the transitions between vibrational states occupy an intermediate
</p>
<p>energy range compared to those corresponding to intrinsic electron transitions or
</p>
<p>to transitions between rotational states. Therefore, the molecular spectrum displays
</p>
<p>vibrational states on top of each intrinsic excitation and rotational states on top of
</p>
<p>each vibrational state (see Fig. 8.4). The electromagnetic radiation associated with
</p>
<p>transitions between intrinsic, vibrational and rotational states appears, successively,
</p>
<p>in the visible, infrared and radiofrequency regions of the optical spectrum.
</p>
<p>As the energies of the rotational and vibrational excitations increase, the
</p>
<p>approximations become less reliable:
</p>

<p>8.5 Approximate Matrix Diagonalizations
</p>
<p>If the conditions for applying perturbation theory are not satisfied, we may resort to
</p>
<p>a diagonalization procedure. This is obviously necessary if there are degenerate or
</p>
<p>close-lying states. This is the case if two or more particles are added to a closed shell,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.5 Approximate Matrix Diagonalizations 151
</p>
<p>whether it be atomic or nuclear. The size of the matrix to be diagonalized may be
</p>
<p>reduced due to physical considerations, for example, when we use the symmetries
</p>
<p>of the Hamiltonian. If we are only interested in the ground state and neighboring
</p>
<p>states, we may also simplify the problem by taking into account only those states
</p>
<p>which are close in energy to the ground state.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to include those contributions to the matrix elements of the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian to be diagonalized that arise from states not included in the diagonal-
</p>
<p>ization. One may use either the technique of folded diagrams (a generalization of
</p>
<p>Raleigh&ndash;Schrödinger perturbation theory) [61] or the Bloch&ndash;Horowitz procedure
</p>
<p>(an extension of the Brillouin&ndash;Wigner expansion) [62].
</p>
<p>An alternative procedure consists in simplifying the expressions for the matrix
</p>
<p>elements. This includes eliminating many of them (see Problem 12). In such cases,
</p>
<p>good insight is required to avoid distorting the physical problem.
</p>
<p>8.5.1&#142; Approximate Treatment of Periodic Potentials
</p>
<p>This example illustrates the interplay between exact diagonalization and perturba-
</p>
<p>tion theory that can be applied in more complicated situations. We treat the same
</p>
<p>problem as in Sect. 4.6&#142;, but in the limit of a small periodic potential V.x/.
</p>
<p>We choose the free-particle HamiltonianH0 D 12M Op2 as zero-order Hamiltonian.
The unperturbed energies are given in Fig. 8.5a, as a function of the wave number
</p>
<p>k. If V.x/ D V.x C d/, a Fourier transform of the potential yields

<p>Although the RPA modes constitute simple boson excitations, they have a

<p>Chapter 9
</p>
<p>Time Dependence in Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Up to now we have only considered static situations (except for the reduction of the
</p>
<p>state vector when a measurement takes place). We now discuss the time dependence
</p>
<p>of the state vector, which requires a new principle. The resultant time-dependent
</p>
<p>Schrödinger equation is solved exactly for simple (spin) cases and in perturbation
</p>
<p>theory. The notion of transition probability yields physical meaning to non-diagonal
</p>
<p>matrix elements and allows us to present the energy&ndash;time uncertainty relation,
</p>
<p>together with the concept of mean lifetime (Sect. 9.5).
</p>
<p>In Chap. 1 we stressed the fact that the main reason for the development of
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics was the instability of the hydrogen atom under classical
</p>
<p>mechanics and electromagnetism. Thus, an exposition of quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>cannot be deemed complete without showing that this original crisis has been
</p>
<p>solved. This task requires an introduction to quantum electrodynamics (QED). The
</p>
<p>concepts of induced and spontaneous emission, laser optics and selection rules
</p>
<p>appear along the exposition.
</p>
<p>9.1 The Time Principle
</p>
<p>In the first place we stress the fact that in quantum mechanics, time is taken to be
</p>
<p>a parameter, not an observable. Although there is an evolution operator, there is no
</p>
<p>such thing as a time operator.1
</p>
<p>1As Jun John Sakurai points out: &ldquo;Ironically, in the historical development of wave mechanics
</p>
<p>both L. de Broglie and E. Schrödinger were guided by a kind of covariant analogy between energy
</p>
<p>and time on the one hand and momentum and position (spatial coordinate) on the other. Yet
</p>
<p>when we now look at quantum mechanics in its finished form, there is no trace of a symmetrical
</p>
<p>treatment between time and space. The relativistic quantum theory of fields does treat the time and
</p>
<p>space coordinates on the same footing, but it does so at the expense of demoting position from the
</p>
<p>status of being an observable to that of being just a parameter.&rdquo; [63], Chap. 2. Nevertheless, and

</p>
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an essential part of processes involving
</p>
<p>the alignment of spins. It has applications in many branches of physics, such
</p>
<p>as measuring magnetic moments of particles, including elementary particles, and
</p>
<p>determining properties of condensed matter. It is also an important tool in quantum
</p>
<p>computing.
</p>
<p>In medicine, NMR is called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is the result
</p>
<p>of three contributing quantum technologies:
</p>
<p>&bull; The patient is placed in a large magnetic field that is produced without heating,
</p>
<p>by means of superconducting coils (Sect. 10.1).
</p>
<p>&bull; The evolution of spins of the hydrogen atoms in our body is affected by both
</p>
<p>static and modulated fields, as described above.
</p>
<p>&bull; The signals picked by detection coils are transformed into images by computers
</p>
<p>employing hardwares based on transistor technologies (Sect. 7.4.3&#142;).
</p>
<p>An enormous amount of information is obtained from the medium. For instance, the
</p>
<p>brain activity can be directly observed through changes in the magnetic environment
</p>
<p>produced by the flux of blood.
</p>
<p>9.3 Sudden Change in the Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>We consider a time-dependent Hamiltonian OH such that OH D OH0 for t &lt; 0 and
OH D OK0 for t &gt; 0, where OH0 and OK0 are time-independent Hamiltonians. We
</p>
<p>know how to solve the problem for these two Hamiltonians:

</p>
<p>together with boundary conditions, such as the value of the amplitudes ci at t D 0.
The formulation of the time-dependent problem in terms of the coupled amplitudes
</p>
<p>ci .t/ is attributed to Dirac.
</p>
<p>The set of coupled equations (9.28) is not easier to solve than (9.5). Therefore,
</p>
<p>one must resort to a perturbation treatment. As in Sect. 8.1, we multiply the
</p>
<p>perturbation OV .t/ by the unphysical parameter � (0 � � � 1) and expand the
amplitudes

<p>condition is enforced through the assignment c
.0/
</p>
<p>k D ıki , which accounts for terms
independent of � in (9.28).
</p>

</p>
<p>The result (9.34) is common to many first-order transition processes. Therefore,
</p>
<p>we discuss it in some detail:
</p>
<p>&bull; If the final states ϕk belong to a continuous set, the transition probability is
proportional to the function f .!/ D .4=!2/ sin2 .!t=2/ plotted in Fig. 9.2.
The largest peak at ! D 0 has a height proportional to t2, while the next
highest, at ! � 3&nbsp;=t , is smaller by a factor of 4=9&nbsp;2 � 1=20. Therefore,
practically all transitions take place for frequencies lying within the central peak,
</p>
<p>which is characteristic of the phenomena of resonance. The secondary peaks are
</p>
<p>associated with diffraction processes.
</p>
<p>&bull; The total probability is obtained by integrating over the frequencies. Assuming
</p>
<p>that the matrix element is not changed within the frequency interval of the main
</p>
<p>peak, and approximating the surface of the latter by the area of an isosceles
</p>
<p>triangle of height t2 and half-base 2&nbsp;=t , we conclude that the total probability

<p>increases linearly with time and that the probability per unit interval of time is

</p>
<p>&bull; The energy of an initially excited atomic state may be obtained from the
</p>
<p>frequency of the photon resulting from de-excitation of this state (Sect. 9.8.4&#142;).
</p>
<p>Therefore, the spread shown in Fig. 9.2 changes the notion of the eigenvalue in
</p>
<p>the case of an unstable state. Instead of a sharp energy, the existence of the spread
</p>
<p>is associated with an indeterminacy in the energy on the order of
</p>
<p>&#129;E � &bdquo;2&nbsp;
t
: (9.35)
</p>
<p>This inequality is a manifestation of the uncertainty as applied to energy and
</p>
<p>time. There is a similar uncertainty if the energy of the excited states is obtained
</p>
<p>via a process of absorption of electromagnetic radiation.
</p>
<p>This time&ndash;energy relation was anticipated in the caption of Fig. 9.1.
</p>
<p>&bull; It would be wrong to conclude from (9.35) that energy is not conserved at the
</p>
<p>microscopic quantum scale, since such conservation principle does not hold for
</p>
<p>a time-dependent Hamiltonian. What enters in (9.35) is the difference between
</p>
<p>eigenvalues of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>&bull; Non-diagonal matrix elements hkjV jii acquire physical meaning, since they can
be measured through transition rates.
</p>

<p>9.7&#142; Time-Reversal Symmetry

<p>The quantum mechanical version of the time-reversal operation is characterized, in

<p>the case of one particle, by the transformation O� of the position, momentum and
spin operators
</p>
<p>Ox0i D O� Oxi O��1 D Oxi ;

</p>
<p>Thus, the time-reversal operation should more appropriately be called motion-
</p>
<p>reversal. A Hamiltonian such as OP 2=2M C V.x/ is invariant under this transfor-
mation.
</p>
<p>Since a unitary transformation preserves relations between operators, the time-

<p>reversal transformation cannot be unitary. For instance,
</p>
<p>Œ Oxi ; Opi &#141; D �Œ Ox0i ; Op0i &#141;: (9.46)
</p>
<p>It is possible, however, to write O� as a product of a unitary transformation OU� times
an operation OK defined as the complex conjugation of all c-numbers. This is called
an antiunitary transformation. Therefore,

<p>central potential is not spherically symmetric, the 2J C 1 degeneracy disappears,
but the levels still display the twofold Kramers degeneracy (m;�m), due to the
time-reversal symmetry.
</p>
<p>The universal validity of the time-reversal invariance is still not a closed subject.

<p>In Chap. 1, we stated that the most relevant manifestation of the crisis in physics that
</p>
<p>took place at the beginning of the twentieth century was the (classical) instability
</p>
<p>of the motion of an electron circling around the nucleus. To show that quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics does indeed solve this problem, we must use that beautiful extension of
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics called quantum electrodynamics. In the following we present a
</p>
<p>very brief introduction to QED.</p>

</p>
<p>We first consider the electromagnetic field in the absence of charges (light
</p>
<p>waves). A quadratic expression for the energy is obtained in terms of canonical
</p>
<p>variables. Subsequently, the theory is quantized by replacing such variables with
</p>
<p>operators satisfying the relation (2.15) (or an equivalent). In the next step, we
</p>
<p>consider the interaction between particles and the electromagnetic field. Finally, we
</p>
<p>solve the ensuing time-dependent problem applying perturbation theory.
</p>
<p>9.8.1&#142; Classical Description of the Radiation Field
</p>
<p>In the absence of charges, the classical electromagnetic vector potential A.r; t/
</p>
<p>satisfies the equation

<p>@2A
</p>
<p>@t2
: (9.48)
</p>
<p>The vector A may be written as the sum of a transverse and a longitudinal
</p>
<p>component. The latter can be included within the particle Hamiltonian, since it is
</p>
<p>responsible for the Coulomb interaction and does not cause the radiation field. The
</p>
<p>transverse component At.r ; t/ satisfies the equation
</p>
<p>divAt D 0: (9.49)

</p>
<p>the creation and annihilation operators aC� ; a�, satisfying the commutation relations

<p>This Hamiltonian implies that:
</p>
<p>&bull; The radiation field is made up of an infinite number of oscillators. The state of
</p>
<p>the radiation field is described by all the occupation numbers n�.
</p>
<p>&bull; The oscillators are of the simple, boson, harmonic type introduced in (3.29) and
</p>
<p>used in Sects. 7.4.4&#142; and 7.8&#142;, if the quantum radiation field is in a stationary state
</p>
<p>without residual interactions.
</p>
<p>&bull; In agreement with Einstein&rsquo;s 1905 hypothesis, each oscillator has an energy
</p>
<p>which is a multiple of &bdquo;!�. The energy of the field is the sum of the energies
of each oscillator.
</p>
<p>&bull; Since the radiation field is a function defined at all points of space and time, the
</p>
<p>number of canonical variables needed for its description is necessarily infinite.

<p>However, by enclosing the field within the volume L3, we have succeeded in

<p>requires only two basis states, as in the case of spin. The analogous to the

<p>6These expressions have been derived using a similar procedure to the one used to obtain (7.21).

<p>A factor of 2, which was included in (7.21) due to spin, is not needed in (9.60). It reappears in

<p>The various ensuing processes may be classified according to the associated power

<p>of the fine structure constant ˛. The smallness of ˛ (Table A.1) ensures the
</p>
<p>convergence of perturbation theory. The linear, lowest order processes require
</p>
<p>only the perturbation term OV . This causes transitions in the unperturbed system,
particle C radiation, by changing the state of the particle and simultaneously
increasing or decreasing the number of field quanta by one unit (emission or
</p>
<p>absorption processes, respectively).
</p>
<p>We apply the perturbation theory developed in Sects. 9.4 and 9.5. Since the

<p>radiation field has a continuous spectrum, a transition probability per unit time

</p>
<p>Fundamental consequences can be extracted from (9.67) and (9.68):
</p>
<p>&bull; The probability of absorbing a photon is proportional to the intensity of the
</p>
<p>radiation field present before the transition. This intensity is represented by Nn�.
This is to be expected. However, the probability of emission consists of two
</p>
<p>terms: the first one also depends on the intensity of the radiation field (induced
</p>
<p>emission); the second term, independent of the field intensity, allows the atom to
</p>
<p>decay from an excited state in vacuo (spontaneous emission).

<p>&bull; The mean lifetime of the excited state ϕ210 in the hydrogen atom (&bdquo;! D 10:2 eV)
may be obtained8 from (9.68) and (9.40). The result yields � D 0:34 � 10�9 s.
Does this represent a short or a long time? In fact it is a long time, since this
</p>
<p>mean lifetime has to be compared with the period of the emitted radiation T D
2&nbsp;=! D 0:41� 10�15 s. The mean lifetime is associated with a spread in energy
of 1:23 � 10�5 eV, which is much smaller than the excitation energy. We can
see now how effectively the great crisis of early twentieth century physics was
</p>
<p>resolved.
</p>
<p>&bull; The ratio . Nn� C 1/= Nn� is needed to preserve the correct thermal equilibrium of
the radiation with a gas: in a gas at temperature T , the number of atoms in the

</p>
<p>which yields

<p>Nn� D 1= Œexp.&bdquo;!ab=kBT / � 1&#141; : (9.70)
From this deduction of Planck&rsquo;s law, Einstein showed the need for spontaneous
</p>
<p>and induced emission in quantum theory [64].
</p>
<p>9.8.5&#142; Selection Rules
</p>
<p>We now focus our attention on the particle matrix elements. The transition probabil-
</p>
<p>ities are also proportional to the squared modulus of the matrix elements jhbjrjaij2.
Therefore, transition rates give information about the value of non-diagonal matrix
</p>
<p>elements. (Since Chap. 2, we know that diagonal matrix elements represent averages
</p>
<p>obtained in measurements of the eigenvalues of physical observables.)
</p>
<p>Let lb; &nbsp;b (la; &nbsp;a) be the orbital angular momentum and parity quantum numbers
</p>
<p>of the final (initial) state. Conservation of angular momentum requires the orbital
</p>
<p>angular momentum of the final state to equal the vector sum of the initial angular
</p>
<p>momentum and that of the radiation (see Sect. 5.3.1). The latter manifests itself
</p>
<p>through the operator Or in (9.68), which can be expressed as a sum of terms
proportional to the spherical harmonics Y1ml . Therefore, the matrix elements must
</p>
<p>satisfy the selection rule la C 1 � lb � jla � 1j (5.33), or &#129;l D 0;˙1.
</p>
<p>8An order of magnitude of � may be obtained by equating the rate of radiation of an oscillating

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.8 Quantum Electrodynamics for Newcomers 179
</p>
<p>Since the operator r is odd under the parity operation (5.12), the non-vanishing of
</p>
<p>this matrix element also requires the initial and final states to carry a different parity,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;a&nbsp;b D �1. The combination of the conservation rules associated with orbital
angular momentum and parity is condensed in the selection rule
</p>
<p>&#129;l D ˙1; (9.71)
</p>
<p>which defines allowed transitions (see, for instance, Fig. 8.4).
</p>
<p>Forbidden (i.e. non-allowed) transitions may also occur, but are much weaker
</p>
<p>than the allowed ones. Their relative intensity may be estimated on the basis of the
</p>
<p>expectation value of the neglected terms in (9.65).

<p>180 9 Time Dependence in Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.4 Schematic representation of the levels of a ruby laser
</p>
<p>Figure 9.4 schematizes the three relevant levels of Cr. At room temperature the
</p>
<p>population of state 2 is much smaller than that of state 1, since E2 � E1 � kT
(see Sect. 7.7&#142;). A population inversion is achieved by means of auxiliary radiation
</p>
<p>(pumping radiation) exciting many atoms into higher energy states 3 (actually into
</p>
<p>two excited bands), from which they spontaneously decay into the state 2 (or
</p>
<p>back to 1) within 10�7 s. Since the spontaneous lifetime of state 2 is rather large
(10�3 s), a considerable fraction of the population of state 1 is transferred to state 2
(� 1=2/.
</p>
<p>Some of the photons spontaneously emitted in the decay of state 2 are reflected
</p>
<p>back and forth between a completely reflecting and a partially reflecting surface of
</p>
<p>the crystal. Thus a standing electromagnetic wave is built. Its intensity increases
</p>
<p>very rapidly through induced emission of further photons, simultaneously with the
</p>
<p>depopulation of state 2. A pulse of laser light crosses over the partially reflecting
</p>
<p>surface. The main characteristics of this emitted light are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Extreme monochromaticity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Large power per unit area of cross section (more than 109 times the one obtained
</p>
<p>from conventional light sources).
</p>
<p>&bull; Extreme coherence. The phase of the light emitted from one atom is related to
</p>
<p>that from each other atom. As a consequence, the phase difference between the
</p>
<p>laser light beam will stay constant at two different points (the points may be
</p>
<p>separated as much as 100 km). On the contrary, light spontaneously emitted is
</p>
<p>incoherent.
</p>
<p>Laser light is playing an ever increasing role in many scientific and technological
</p>
<p>applications: precise determinations of length and time, CD players and readers,
</p>
<p>non-linear optics, hot fusion, etc. In communications, laser light allows to trans-
</p>
<p>port 1012 information units per second through a single optical fiber across the
</p>
<p>oceans.</p>

</p>
<p>Broken Symmetries
</p>
<p>We have discussed several problems in which the symmetry of the Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>constitutes an essential tool in the construction of the (factorized) eigenstates. In
</p>
<p>these cases, the ground state ϕ0 is annihilated by the generators of the transformation
associated with that symmetry. For instance, in the case of the hydrogen atom,
</p>
<p>Œ OH; OLi &#141; D 0 and OLiϕ0 D 0. We say that the states carry the same symmetry as
the Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>In the present chapter, we study situations in which this is not the case. In
</p>
<p>fact, the description with broken symmetries permeates an important fraction of
</p>
<p>today physics: ferromagnetism; superconductivity and superfluidity (condensed
</p>
<p>matter physics, nuclei, neutron stars); Hartree&ndash;Fock description (atomic and nuclear
</p>
<p>physics); molecules; quadrupole deformed nuclei; theory of electro-weak interac-
</p>
<p>tions and quantum chromodynamics (field theory, cosmology); etc.
</p>
<p>The chapter is divided into two main sections. In the first one, we present the
</p>
<p>treatment of superconducting and superfluid systems by Bardeen, in collaboration
</p>
<p>with Leon N. Cooper and John R. Schrieffer. The BCS theory [66] constitutes
</p>
<p>a relevant illustration of a description based on the approximation of broken
</p>
<p>symmetries. Superconducting systems are macroscopic manifestations of quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics, and thus bear relevance in the diffuse limit between classical and
</p>
<p>quantum descriptions of nature. In addition, they display an increasing number of
</p>
<p>technical applications ranging from the transmission of electric currents without
</p>
<p>losses to the most accurate determination of the ratio e=&bdquo;.
In the second section of the chapter, we delve deeper into the concept of
</p>
<p>broken symmetry by means of a very simple mechanical example. Corrections to
</p>
<p>this approximation demand the appearance of additional degrees of freedom, the
</p>
<p>collective variables, which become compensated by the existence of constraints.
</p>
<p>Little attention, if any, is paid in quantum textbooks to the problem of quantization
</p>
<p>with constraints, an area where great progress has been made over the last 35 years
</p>
<p>[67]. This subject is not only of paramount importance in gauge field theories
</p>
<p>[68], but it also has applications in quantum mechanics, as in the description of
</p>
<p>many-body systems from moving frames of reference [69]. Moreover, the problem
</p>
<p>is conceptually significant in terms of properties of Hilbert spaces. Although we

<p>184 10 Broken Symmetries
</p>
<p>are here restricted to present just an outline of the BRST procedure, we hope that
</p>
<p>the reader may get some feeling of this elegant method developed by C. Becchi,
</p>
<p>A. Rouet, R. Stora and I.V. Tyutin [67] (Sects. 10.2.2&ndash;10.2.4&#142;).
</p>
<p>Quantization with constraints and superconductivity are two subjects which are
</p>
<p>seldom explained together. However, although the formalism describing supercon-
</p>
<p>ductivity has more complexity than the one employed in Sect. 10.2, the underlying
</p>
<p>mechanism of broken symmetry is similar in both cases. Moreover, the collective
</p>
<p>sector that appears as a consequence of the BRST formalism provides a phase to
</p>
<p>the BCS solution which becomes relevant in processes involving the transference of
</p>
<p>pairs of particles (e.g. Josephson junctions).
</p>
<p>10.1 The BCS Theory of Superconductivity
</p>
<p>In many cases for which the exact eigenstates with the correct symmetry are difficult
</p>
<p>to obtain, it is a good approximation to use solutions involving a breakdown of
</p>
<p>symmetries. In this section we present superconductivity as an illustration of a
</p>
<p>broken symmetry. The formalism applies as well to nuclear superfluidity.
</p>
<p>Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discovered in 1911 that, below a certain temperature,
</p>
<p>most metals conduct electricity without any resistance [70]. It took almost 50
</p>
<p>years until Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer developed an adequate microscopic
</p>
<p>description for the quantum state of electrons in a metal, subject to attractive
</p>
<p>interactions. They were able to explain the behavior of all superconducting materials
</p>
<p>known at the time when the theory was developed [66]. Those materials are known
</p>
<p>today as low critical temperature superconductors. The magnetic response of the
</p>
<p>superconductors as well as the formal discussion of a possible microscopic theory
</p>
<p>for the superconductivity found in copper oxide superconductors (high critical
</p>
<p>temperature superconductors) is not the subject of this introduction.
</p>
<p>10.1.1&#142; The Conjugate Variable to the Number of Particles
</p>
<p>We consider now the case of the gauge symmetry,1 associated with the number
</p>
<p>of particles N . For all systems treated so far, the number of particles has been a
</p>
<p>conserved quantity and its conjugate variable has been ignored. In fact, it has been
</p>
<p>completely undetermined, as in (10.38). Thus, we start by looking for the conjugate
</p>
<p>variable � to the number of particles. This variable does exist, as can be verified for
</p>
<p>the boson case within the harmonic description.
</p>
<p>According to (3.42), the number of bosons ON D aCa is given by OH&bdquo;! �

<p>10.1 The Monopole Pairing Operator and the Hamiltonian 187
</p>
<p>called a contact interaction because the leap only takes place if they are at the same
</p>
<p>place. Consistently, a delta force also displays fairly constant matrix elements for
</p>
<p>the jump of pairs of particles.4 The expression (10.10) has the advantage over a
</p>
<p>delta interaction that it has a simpler expression, due to the fact that it is written in
</p>
<p>a separable form. Nevertheless, in spite of its simplifications, this Hamiltonian is
</p>
<p>still difficult to solve (but for special cases as those described in Problems 1 and 2).
</p>
<p>Therefore, we resort to approximations. However, see Ref. [132].
</p>
<p>Note that the Hamiltonian (10.10) is a scalar under gauge transformations (10.6).
</p>
<p>There are also normal electrons (not bound in pairs), moving around the metal in
</p>
<p>an ordinary way. We disregard this complication here.
</p>
<p>10.1.3&#142; The BCS Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>We have mentioned that a pair of fermions acts like a boson. In a system with
</p>
<p>N &gt;&gt;1 bosons, the creation of all of them in a single state is favored over
</p>
<p>their distribution in different states, since the amplitude for creating a new pair is
</p>
<p>proportional to
p
N C 1 (3.35). The essential feature of the superconducting phase
</p>
<p>is the presence of many bosons (i.e. pairs of bound electrons) in a single quantum
</p>
<p>state. This is called a condensate.
</p>
<p>The mean-field approximation is a straightforward extension of the Hartree&ndash;
</p>
<p>Fock treatment (Sect. 8.6.1&#142;). It is also obtained by using a representation in which
</p>
<p>large matrix elements of some operator become expectation values, ignoring their
</p>
<p>quantum fluctuations. In the superconducting case this operator is PC, which bears
some relation with the persistance of currents. Thus,

</p>
<p>where the (real) modulus is given in units of the interaction strength. Thus, we
</p>
<p>require that &#129;=g &gt;&gt; 1.
</p>
<p>The phase angle � of the condensate represents the orientation of the system in
</p>
<p>gauge space. Since it is conjugate to the number of bosons in the condensate, it is
</p>
<p>completely undefined [as in (10.38)] for systems with a definite number of pairs of
</p>
<p>particles. The choice of a particular value of � in (10.11) implies that:
</p>
<p>&bull; The original symmetry of the Hamiltonian is broken in the state ϕ0.
&bull; The number of pairs of particles becomes ill defined. This is consistent with the
</p>
<p>fact that the expectation value of an operator creating two particles is different
</p>
<p>from zero.
</p>
<p>4There are also cases of superconductivity for which other components of the interaction have to
</p>
<p>be introduced.</p>

<p>This expectation number is larger for states within the gap (j�p � �j &lt;&lt; &#129;) and
decreases for distant states (j�p � �j &gt;&gt; &#129;). Replacement of (10.23) in (10.19)
yields the ratio &#129;=g. It is a large number (as required), since all contributions to the

<p>sum (10.11) have the same sign.
</p>
<p>As an illustration, let us consider the case of 19 pairs of particles allowed to move
</p>
<p>in 38 single-particle equidistant levels. The distance between consecutive levels will
</p>
<p>be the unit of energy. For g D 0:456, (10.19) and (10.20) yield the parameters

particle excitation energies j�p � �j in Fig. 10.1c. The occupation probabilities V 2p
are represented in Fig. 10.1a and the amplitudes UpVp in Fig. 10.1b.
</p>
<p>The particles constituting a pair are not very close in real space, in spite of the
</p>
<p>fact that a contact interaction has been used: the mean value of this distance is

<p>somewhat larger than the average distance between different pairs of particles. This
</p>
<p>is due to the fact that, in the condensate, there are many pairs of particles occupying

<p>The ground state (10.21) displays an even number of particles. In fact, although the

<p>it preserves the parity in the number of particles. Systems with an even number of

a gap in the vicinity of the ground state.
</p>
<p>In a normal conductor, resistance originates from the heat produced by collisions
</p>
<p>of the moving electrons with the ionic lattice. In a superconductor, the current is due
</p>
<p>to pairs of electrons moving together, each pair with a non-vanishing center of mass
</p>
<p>momentum. These pairs form a highly collective quantum condensate: breaking a
</p>
<p>pair requires a change of energy of all other pairs, which is of order of the gap (� 2.7
meV for Nb). Thus, resistance is suppressed.
</p>
<p>However, since there is no restoring force in the � angular direction, we should
</p>
<p>expect the existence of a zero frequency boson, which appears to be precluded by
</p>
<p>the existence of a gap. Nevertheless, we have seen in Sect. 8.6.2&#142; that low energy
</p>
<p>bosons may appear as RPA excitations of the ground state in fermion systems. In
</p>
<p>the following, we search for this type of excitations in the superconducting case.

2&nbsp;) (5.60) in
</p>
<p>the description of a superconductor is emphasized.
</p>
<p>The product states (10.32) constitute an approximation, since there appear more
</p>
<p>degrees of freedom than the original ones. One consequence is that overcomplete-
</p>
<p>ness and Pauli violations are included in (10.32). However, a legitimation of these
</p>
<p>states is presented in Sect. 10.2.
</p>
<p>States with the same number n� of finite frequency bosons can be grouped
</p>
<p>into &ldquo;rotational&rdquo; bands made up from systems with different numbers of pairs
</p>
<p>of particles. In particular, the set of ground states of even systems constitutes a
</p>
<p>rotational band. The associated rotational energies can be obtained as in (10.65).
</p>
<p>Since ϕ0 is a valid description of the ground state in the intrinsic system, any
operator must be transformed to this system before operating within states (10.32).

<p>The presence of the collective sector in (10.32) ensures the conservation of the

<p>A potential difference V may exist between the two sides of the insulating

<p>196 10 Broken Symmetries
</p>
<p>circular symmetry. The fact that one takes place in gauge space, and the other in real
</p>
<p>space, is immaterial. On the other hand, this toy model is much simpler to handle,
</p>
<p>because any other degree of freedom is gone, but the rotation along the angular

</p>
<p>where &bdquo;m is the eigenvalue of the angular momentum OL and the conjugate angle �
is completely undetermined .0 � � � 2&nbsp;/. In particular, the ground state satisfies
the relation OLϕ0 D 0.
</p>
<p>However, other descriptions are also possible. For instance, from a rotating frame
</p>
<p>of reference. In this case, states ϕ.�/ carry less symmetry than the circular symmetry
associated both with the Hamiltonian and with the eigenstates (10.38). We say that
</p>
<p>there has been a breakdown of symmetry.
</p>
<p>Moreover, this description requires the inclusion of the angle � specifying the
</p>
<p>orientation of the moving frame relative to the laboratory. Hence, we have an
</p>
<p>overcomplete set of degrees of freedom, namely the two angles � and �.
</p>
<p>We call intrinsic, the coordinates of a system that are referred to a rotating frame
</p>
<p>of reference. The motion of the moving frame relative to the laboratory is described
</p>
<p>by means of collective coordinates. Therefore, in this problem:

<p>to select only one of these equivalent trajectories.

<p>operators. Except in simple cases, this separation is by no means a trivial

<p>operation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Since the problem displays circular symmetry, there is no restoring force in the
</p>
<p>intrinsic angular direction. Therefore, we expect a zero energy state created by an
</p>
<p>operator proportional to the generator OL. Consequently, &ldquo;infrared divergences&rdquo;
may prevent the applicability of perturbation theory.

</p>
<p>powerful symmetry.

</p>
<p>The collective coordinate �, which was introduced in Sect. 10.2.1 as an artifact
</p>
<p>associated with the existence of the moving frame, has been raised to the status
</p>
<p>of a real degree of freedom.
</p>
<p>Since this problem has only one real degree of freedom, and since this role is
</p>
<p>taken by the collective angle, all others are unphysical. There must therefore be a
</p>
<p>trade-off: the intrinsic coordinate � has to be transferred to the unphysical subspace.
</p>
<p>In the BRST procedure, this unphysical subspace is also integrated with auxiliary
</p>
<p>fields [67]. All effects of the unphysical degrees of freedom on any physical
</p>
<p>observable must cancel out. Moreover, the degree of freedom . O�; OL/ acquires a finite
frequency through its mixture with the other spurious fields, and perturbation theory
</p>
<p>becomes feasible.
</p>
<p>Quite generally, the total zero-order state may be factorized into three terms:
</p>
<p>&bull; A collective term carrying a representation of the degrees of freedom correspond-
</p>
<p>ing to the symmetry that is being restored: 1p
2&nbsp;
</p>
<p>exp.im�/ for two dimensional
</p>
<p>rotations (10.44);
q
</p>
<p>2IC1

</p>
<p>DIMK for three dimensional rotations (5.43);
1p
V
</p>
<p>exp.ip	
r=&bdquo;/ for translations (7.17); etc..
</p>
<p>&bull; A term representing the physical intrinsic degrees of freedom. For instance, had
</p>
<p>a radial potential 1
2
M!2.r � r0/2 been added to the Hamiltonian, a harmonic
</p>
<p>oscillator would describe the (real) motion along the radial direction.
</p>
<p>&bull; An unphysical term including the degrees of freedom associated with the broken
</p>
<p>symmetries in the intrinsic system, plus the auxiliary fields that have been
</p>
<p>introduced.
</p>
<p>The reader may believe these conclusions and proceed to Sect. 10.3 if he or she
</p>
<p>does not wish to get involved with the somewhat abstract BRST manipulations.
</p>
<p>Note that the BRST procedure can be applied in particular to the BCS solution
</p>
<p>(Sect. 10.1), which displays all the necessary features:
</p>
<p>1. There is an initial circular symmetry (in gauge space).
</p>
<p>2. This symmetry is destroyed in the chosen, arbitrary frame (� D 0).
3. There is a large parameter measuring the deformation in gauge space (&#129;=g). It
</p>
<p>plays the same role as r0 in the toy model. Eventually, a perturbation expansion
</p>
<p>in inverse powers of this parameter becomes possible.
</p>
<p>4. There is a zero frequency boson associated with the generator of rotations in
</p>
<p>gauge space ( ON&nbsp;).
Thus, (10.32) becomes completely justified.</p>

<p>10.2 Quantization with Constraints 199
</p>
<p>10.2.3&#142; A Presentation of the BRST Symmetry
</p>
<p>for the Abelian Case
</p>
<p>An elementary presentation of the quantum mechanical BRST method is given in
</p>
<p>the second of references [69]. In the following, we follow this presentation.
</p>
<p>&bull; A new symmetry requires additional degrees of freedom. Thus, the gauge
</p>
<p>symmetry implied the existence of both intrinsic and collective coordinates
</p>
<p>(10.40). The BRST enlarged space is obtained through further inclusion of a new
</p>
<p>boson degree of freedom,9 with an associated constraint,
</p>
<p>Œ O�; OB&#141; D i; OB ϕph D 0; (10.45)
</p>
<p>and of two new fermion variables � and N�, called ghosts, with their conjugate
partners &nbsp; and N&nbsp;
</p>
<p>f�; &nbsp;g D f N�; N&nbsp;g D 1: (10.46)
All other anticommutators vanish. The ghosts carry zero angular momentum.
</p>
<p>&bull; The generator Ő of BRST transformations is a linear function of the two
constraints (10.43) and (10.45)
</p>
<p>Ő D �� Of C N&nbsp; OB: (10.47)
</p>
<p>It is a nilpotent ( Ő 2 D 0) and Hermitian ( Ő C D Ő ) operator, which annihilates
physical states and commutes with physical operators [see (10.43)]
</p>
<p>Ő ϕph D 0; Œ Ő ; OQph&#141; D 0: (10.48)
</p>
<p>&bull; However, there is a set of unphysical states and operators satisfying similar
</p>
<p>properties, namely
</p>
<p>ϕ&brvbar; D Ő ϕunph; OQ&brvbar; D f Ő ; OQunphg: (10.49)
</p>
<p>Therefore, we must act within the composite subspace ϕph + ϕ&brvbar; with the set of
</p>
<p>operators OQph + OQ&brvbar;. States ϕ&brvbar; have zero norm. Fortunately, the enlargement
of space and of the set of operators does not change the values of the matrix
</p>
<p>elements, since
</p>
<p>.hphj C h&brvbar;j/.Qph C Q&brvbar;/.jphi C j&brvbar;i/ D hphjQphjphi: (10.50)
</p>
<p>9The boson term O� may include a constant value that plays the role of the Lagrange multiplier
(10.12) in the previous section. We use &bdquo; D 1 in Sects. 10.2.3 and 10.2.4.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>200 10 Broken Symmetries
</p>
<p>This statement may be verified term by term. For instance,
</p>
<p>h&brvbar;jQ&brvbar;jphi D hunphj˝2Qunphjphi C h&brvbar;jQunph ˝jphi D 0C 0: (10.51)
</p>
<p>&bull; We construct the BRST Hamiltonian by adding to the Hamiltonian OH a OQ&brvbar;
operator
</p>
<p>OHBRST D OH C f O�; Ő g (10.52)
For any choice of the operator O�, OHBRST yields the same physical eigenvalues as
the original OH . The selection of O� is equivalent to the selection of a gauge. One
possible choice is motivated by an analogy with the covariant gauge in Yang&ndash;
</p>
<p>Mills theory

<p>2I
OB2 C � N� Œ O�; OL&#141;; (10.53)
</p>
<p>where I D Mr20 is the moment of inertia and O� is a function of the intrinsic
coordinates which does not commute with OL. It may well be the conjugate angle,
but this is not necessary. Since OHBRST does not commute with OL (unlike OH ), the
microscopic circular symmetry is lost. Microscopic invariance is replaced by a
</p>
<p>macroscopic collective invariance.
</p>
<p>10.2.4&#142; Application of the BRST Formalism to the Abelian
</p>
<p>Toy Model
</p>
<p>The previous subsection displays a quite general presentation of the BRST formal-
</p>
<p>ism as applied to Abelian transformations. We return now to the toy model described
</p>
<p>in Sect. 10.2.1. We may choose the classical, &ldquo;deformed&rdquo; solution x D r0, y D 0 as
the starting point for the motion in the intrinsic system. The radius r0 constitutes the
</p>
<p>large distance of the problem, the order parameter. Thus, the leading contribution
</p>
<p>to the particle angular momentum is OL.0/ D r0 Opy . It is convenient to choose O� as
the conjugate variable to this leading order term: O� D Oy=r0. This choice fixes the
particle to the moving x-axis. Thus, OHBRST (10.53) may be written as
</p>
<p>OHBRST D OHb C OHg C OHc C OHx

<p>Thus, OHb has been written in terms of two uncoupled oscillators, with frequencies

<p>Therefore, the quadratic Hamiltonian of the unphysical sector,
</p>
<p>OH .2/unph D � C1 �1 � � C0 �0 C Naa C Nbb; (10.61)
</p>
<p>is a supersymmetric Hamiltonian with a characteristic energy equal to unit. Some
</p>
<p>interesting features of this Hamiltonian are:
</p>
<p>&bull; The eigenvectors define the subspace
</p>
<p>ϕn1;n0;na;nb D
1p
</p>
<p>n1Š n0Š
.� C1 /

n0 . Na/na . Nb/nb ϕ0; (10.62)
</p>
<p>with n1; n0 D 0; 1; 2; ::: and na; nb D 0; 1.
&bull; The vacuum state is annihilated by the operators �1, �0, a, b and thus, by the
</p>
<p>quadratic term in the BRST generator (10.47)
</p>
<p>Ő .2/ D �i.� C1 C � C0 /a � .�1 C �0/ Nb: (10.63)
</p>
<p>Therefore, this vacuum is a physical state, according to (10.43). In fact, it is the
</p>
<p>only one among the whole set of states (10.62). Moreover, the system displays
</p>
<p>the BRST symmetry (Œ Ő ; OHBRST&#141; D 0 I Ő ϕ0 D 0).
&bull; The cancelation of unphysical effects would not be possible if all states (10.62)
</p>
<p>were ordinary states in Hilbert space. However, the unusual relations (10.58) and
</p>
<p>(10.60) are well defined and may be used without problems.
</p>
<p>&bull; As a consequence of the circular symmetry, the Hamiltonian OH does not display
a restoring force in the y-direction. However, this symmetry is lost for OHBRST in
the intrinsic frame and, as a consequence, all unphysical degrees of freedom have
</p>
<p>acquired a finite frequency [see (10.61)]. Perturbation theory becomes feasible.
</p>
<p>&bull; The coupling term OHc in (10.54) can be obtained from the second equation
(10.56)
</p>
<p>OHc D

</p>
<p>.� C0 C �0/ (10.64)
</p>
<p>Since this term is small ŒO .1=r0/&#141;, it can be treated in perturbation theory. The

</p>
<p>; (10.65)
</p>
<p>where (10.56) and (10.58) have been used. Second-order perturbation theory
</p>
<p>yields a positive contribution to the energy of the ground state due to the unusual
</p>
<p>metric (10.58). It agrees with the exact result in the present case. The associated
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions are given by (10.44). The spectrum displays a physical collective
</p>
<p>rotation given by (10.44) and (10.65).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.3 Generalizations 203
</p>
<p>&bull; The presence of OHx allows for radial motion (or motion along the x-axis in the
intrinsic frame). The spectrum also displays physical, intrinsic, finite-frequency
</p>
<p>modes.
</p>
<p>&bull; There are unphysical excitations described by the excited states of (10.62).
</p>
<p>&bull; The BRST treatment is something of an overkill for the Abelian model. In fact,
</p>
<p>the ghosts are uncoupled from the start. Their role is much more significative
</p>
<p>for non-Abelian transformations. &ldquo;Nevertheless, through the Abelian calculation,
</p>
<p>we have been able to discuss properties of the BRST procedure that continue to
</p>
<p>be present in the non-Abelian case, such as the BRST symmetry, the existence
</p>
<p>of the zero-norm subspace, the construction of the unphysical subspace, and
</p>
<p>the feasibility of the perturbation expansion&rdquo; [69]. Moreover, statements in
</p>
<p>Sect. 10.2.2 have been substantiated.
</p>
<p>10.3 Generalizations
</p>
<p>Symmetry breaking is common in physics.
</p>
<p>The treatment of the two examples presented in this chapter has in common
</p>
<p>the fact that, although the generators of the transformations commute with the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian ([ OL; OH&#141; D Œ ON ; OH&#141; D 0), the ground states are represented by states
which are not annihilated by the generators. As a consequence, the states OLϕ0 and
ONϕ0 have the same energy as the ground state configuration ϕ0. There are many
</p>
<p>degenerate ground states. We speak of a hidden symmetry.
</p>
<p>In finite systems one of these configurations may tunnel through to other
</p>
<p>configurations, so the true ground state becomes a superposition of degenerate
</p>
<p>states. One consequence is that the lost symmetry is retrieved at the collective level
</p>
<p>in the form of rotational bands, as indicated after (10.32).
</p>
<p>For instance, in many nuclear species it is convenient to extend the spherical
</p>
<p>shell-model (Sect. 7.3.2) by including a quadrupole term in the single-particle
</p>
<p>potential V2 / r2Y20.�/ [38]. In this case, the large number measuring the defor-
mation is the expectation value of the quadrupole operator h0j
</p>
<p>P
</p>
<p>h r
2
hY20.�h/j0i. As
</p>
<p>a consequence, ϕ0 is not longer an eigenstate of the angular momentum OI with
null eigenvalue. The associated degeneracy manifests itself in the form of low-lying
</p>
<p>rotational bands,11 with characteristic energies .&bdquo;2=2I/I.I C 1/ and eigenstates
DIMK ϕ� (Sect. 5.3.2
</p>
<p>&#142;).
</p>
<p>One also finds zero-energy bosons in infinite deformed systems, which are
</p>
<p>related to the one found in subsection 10.1.5&#142;. They are called Goldstone bosons.
</p>
<p>Moreover, they may materialize as very light particles, like the pion. However, the
</p>
<p>procedure based on collective variables is not applied to those cases, since it may
</p>
<p>take an infinite amount of time to get across all configurations.
</p>
<p>11Similar effects appear in the case of the (non-spherical) diatomic molecule (Sect. 8.4.2).</p>

</p>
<p>A second generalization concerns the generation of energy, a consequence
</p>
<p>similar to the increase of the single-particle energy j�p ��j by an amount of O.&#129;/.
Most of the mass of hadrons, such as the proton, arises not from the masses of their
</p>
<p>constituent quarks, but from the quarks&rsquo; kinetic energy and the energy stored in
</p>
<p>the gluon field, through processes involving the breakdown of &ldquo;gauge symmetries&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>For instance, in the Nambu&ndash;Jona Lasinio model of nucleons, quarks are subject to
</p>
<p>contact forces, and their condensate becomes responsible for the generation of the
</p>
<p>nucleon mass M : the solution of an equation similar to (10.19) yields the nucleon

<p>In the first place, we enlarge the Hilbert space1 by broadening the normalization

<p>procedure through the introduction of the Dirac delta function.2 Subsequently, the
</p>
<p>notion of propagator as a probability amplitude is introduced. This concept allows
</p>
<p>us to present the formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of path integrals. This
</p>
<p>formalism, due to Feynman [72], provides a most powerful link between classical

<p>and quantum mechanics. It is widely applied in field theory, statistical mechanics,

</p>
<p>&bull; All the paths contribute equally in magnitude, but the phase of their contribution
</p>
<p>is different. The phase is given by the classical action (in units of &bdquo;).
&bull; Expression (11.24) has been derived from laws of quantum mechanics to which
</p>
<p>the reader has become familiar by now. One of them is the superposition
</p>
<p>principle, used in summing the contributions of alternative paths. The other is

<p>the composition property of the transition amplitude, which allows us to divide

<p>approach was to adopt (11.24) as an hypothesis and, subsequently, derive the
</p>
<p>time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
</p>
<p>&bull; The path integral relates certain quantum probability amplitudes to the classical
</p>
<p>action. Therefore, it provides a deep link between classical and quantum physics
</p>
<p>which is explained in [72] as follows: the classical approximation corresponds to
</p>
<p>the case of large S in relation to &bdquo;. A small change in the path induces a change</p>

</p>
<p>&bull; Path integrals whose exponents are quadratic in x and Px may be calculated

<p>subsequently, to replace x; Px by y D x � xcl; Py D Px � Pxcl in the Lagrangian.
Exact quantum expressions for the quadratic fluctuations around the classical

<p>terms in the potential may be calculated by means of perturbation expansions.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Since its inception in Richard Feynman&rsquo;s 1942 doctoral thesis, the path integral

<p>&bull; Feynman&rsquo;s path integral is not a too convenient tool for solving problems in non-

</p>
<p>Entanglement and Experimental Tests
</p>
<p>of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Equations (7.3)&ndash;(7.6) display two possible features appearing in the description of
</p>
<p>bipartite systems: in the first two equations, each subsystem possesses its own quan-
</p>
<p>tum state ϕp , which constitutes a complete description of the physical state of the
subsystem (a familiar situation from classical physics). This feature of separability
</p>
<p>does not hold for the last two equations. Schrödinger was the first to emphasize the
</p>
<p>non-classical features of &ldquo;entangled&rdquo; states and coined this term in [76].
</p>
<p>Alain Aspect describes the difference between classical and quantum correlations
</p>
<p>in bipartite systems as follows: &ldquo;If we have a pair of identical twins we do not
</p>
<p>know what their blood type is before testing them, but if we determine the type
</p>
<p>of one, we know for sure that the other is the same type. We explain this by the
</p>
<p>fact that they were born with, and still carry along, the same specific chromosomes
</p>
<p>that determine their blood type. Two entangled photons are not two distinct systems
</p>
<p>carrying identical copies of the same parameter. A pair of entangled photons must
</p>
<p>instead be considered as a single, inseparable system, described by a global wave
</p>
<p>function that cannot be factorized into single photon states.&rdquo; [77].
</p>
<p>The concept of entanglement is a direct consequence of the superposition
</p>
<p>principle applied to composite systems. It has become a fundamental tool in the
</p>
<p>solution of many quantum problems during the second half of the last century:
</p>
<p>&bull; In the discussions on the validity of quantum mechanics [Sect. 12.3, including
</p>
<p>the clarification of the EPR paradox (Sect. 12.3.2)].
</p>
<p>&bull; In the field of quantum information (Chap. 13).
</p>
<p>&bull; In the description of the emergence of the classical world from the quantum
</p>
<p>substrate and, as a consequence, in a consistent quantum explanation of the
</p>
<p>collapse postulate (Sect. 14.3&#142;).
</p>
<p>We also discuss in the present chapter some recent experiments confirming the
</p>
<p>validity of quantum mechanics (Sect. 12.3), all of which make use of the concept of
</p>
<p>entanglement.
</p>
<p>Entanglement constitutes the central tool in the forthcoming chapters. In all
</p>
<p>presentations we make use of two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Therefore the
</p>
<p>considerations on these spaces given in Sects. 3.2 and 5.2.2 are assumed here. In

</p>
<p>is better for computational purposes, although photons are preferred in the case of
</p>
<p>communication.
</p>
<p>The quantum formalism to be used from here on is rather different from the
</p>
<p>one that we have employed so far. For instance, the matrix density formulation of
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics (Sect. 14.4) is a convenient tool to deal with entangled states,
</p>
<p>and to depart from the considerations of isolated microsystems.
</p>
<p>12.1 Entanglement
</p>
<p>Let us perform some thought experiments with the same filters used in Sect. 2.5.1:
</p>
<p>two particles, 1 and 2, are emitted simultaneously from the same source, in opposite
</p>
<p>directions (Fig. 12.1). Each particle enters a filter aligned with the laboratory
</p>
<p>z-axis and may be detected by an observer provided with another filter. The same
</p>
<p>orientation ˇ, relative to the laboratory frame, holds for both observers&rsquo; filters. The
</p>
<p>down channel is blocked in all four filters. Thus cos2.ˇ=2/ represents the probability
</p>
<p>that a particle is detected, and sin2.ˇ=2/ the probability that it gets absorbed (5.25).

</p>
<p>then:
</p>
<p>&bull; A measurement of particle 1 destroys the entangled state. Particle 2 assumes the
</p>
<p>same state as the one into which particle 1 was projected by the measurement.
</p>
<p>&bull; The correlation is 100%, regardless of the filter orientation ˇ.
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.1 Thought experiments illustrating the properties of entangled states. Both particles are
</p>
<p>filtered by the source filters into the state ϕ0 through a first filter (full line box) and are detected by
filters oriented at an angle ˇ (dashed box). Trajectories inside the filters have not been drawn</p>

<p>:
</p>
<p>A measurement of particle 1 would project particle 2 into the same state as
</p>
<p>particle 1.
</p>
<p>&bull; The comparison with the (non-entangled) product state ϕ0.1/ϕ0.2/ is illuminat-
ing: here the probability that the two particles get through is cos4.ˇ=2/, while
</p>
<p>the probability that both are absorbed is sin4.ˇ=2/. Therefore the probability that
</p>
<p>both observers find the same result is 1 � .1=2/ sin2 ˇ. If ˇ D &nbsp;=2, this last
probability has the value 1/2, the same classical value as for two independent
</p>
<p>players tossing coins.
</p>
<p>&bull; The correlation implicit in (12.2) takes place regardless of the distance between
</p>
<p>the two particles: particle 2 (non-locally) becomes represented by a definite state
</p>
<p>as the result of the measurement of particle 1. Entanglement implies that nature
</p>
<p>is non-local, since the outcome of the local measurement on the second particle
</p>
<p>is determined by quantum correlations encoded in the total, entangled state of the
</p>
<p>bipartite system.
</p>
<p>&bull; Note that the outcome of the measurement on the first particle is completely
</p>
<p>random. This randomness implies that any useful information between the
</p>
<p>two partners has to be transmitted by conventional means. Therefore, although
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is a non-relativistic theory, its probabilistic structure prevents
</p>
<p>any contradiction with relativity theory.
</p>
<p>Entanglement constitutes a profound, non-classical correlation between two (or
</p>
<p>more) quantum entities. The constituent parts of entangled systems do not have their
</p>
<p>own individual quantum states. Only the total system is in a well-defined state. This
</p>
<p>is fundamentally unlike anything in classical physics.

<p>&bull; Since Bell states are orthonormal, any two-qubit state may be expressed as a

<p>linear combination of these states.
</p>
<p>&bull; The Bell states are eigenstates of the product operators OSz.1/ OSz.2/ and
OSx.1/ OSx.2/ (see Problem 1). These product operators are included among the
</p>
<p>interactions in the controlling Hamiltonian (13.14), used to manipulate qubits.
</p>
<p>&bull; Successive introduction of these product interactions separates any two-qubit
</p>
<p>system into the four Bell channels, in a similar way as the interaction with the
</p>
<p>magnetic field splits the two channels associated with a single qubit (Sects. 2.5.1
</p>
<p>and 5.2.1).
</p>
<p>&bull; The two spins in a product operator must be simultaneously measured, since
</p>
<p>detection of a single spin destroys the entanglement. On the contrary, unitary

<p>operations can be applied to any one spin or to both of them.

<p>12.3 Experimental Tests of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Thought experiments played a crucial role in the clarification of controversial
</p>
<p>aspects of quantum mechanics. The discussions between Bohr and Einstein are
</p>
<p>paradigmatic in this respect (Sect. 15.5.2). However, since the end of the twentieth</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.3 Experimental Tests of Quantum Mechanics 223
</p>
<p>century, real experiments have replaced thought ones. Not only have earlier views
</p>
<p>been confirmed, but also more counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics have
</p>
<p>been brought into focus. In this presentation we restrict ourselves to the discussion
</p>
<p>of three types of experiments, in spite of other fascinating results that have been or
</p>
<p>are being obtained:
</p>
<p>&bull; Two-slit experiments which, according to Feynman constitute &ldquo;a phenomenon
</p>
<p>which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>([23], p. 1&ndash;1).
</p>
<p>&bull; Experiments that can decide between local realism or quantum mechanics as the
</p>
<p>proper tool for describing the physical world.
</p>
<p>&bull; Experiments with single quantum systems, which bear on the statistical frame-
</p>
<p>work of quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>Entanglement plays a central role in all these experiments. Present sources of
</p>
<p>entangled photons are based on the process of parametric down conversion: if a
</p>
<p>non-linear optical crystal is pumped by a laser beam, a photon may decay into
</p>
<p>two entangled photons (with a small probability, 10�12 � 10�10). The energy and
momentum of the two photons add up to their value in the original one. The two
</p>
<p>photons may have the same or different polarizations.
</p>
<p>12.3.1 Two-Slit Experiments Revisited
</p>
<p>Two-slit experiments performed with a single qubit are described in Sect. 2.5.2.
</p>
<p>The superposition (2.29) giving rise to interference phenomena requires that
</p>
<p>there is no way to know, even in principle, which path the particle took, a or a0.
Interference is destroyed if this information exists, even if it is dispersed in the
</p>
<p>environment.
</p>
<p>Two-slit experiments with two entangled particles have been used to verify even
</p>
<p>more spectacular and non-intuitive consequences of quantum mechanics.1
</p>
<p>Consider two photons, A and B , emitted in opposite directions. Photon A is
</p>
<p>monitored by detector A after going through a double slit with holes at a and a0.
Photon B gets across a lens and can be observed by detector B placed at different
</p>
<p>distances behind the lens (Fig. 12.2). Whenever photon A is found in a beam at a
</p>

<p>detected after the double slit and at the focal plane of the lens, respectively. Detector B may also
</p>
<p>be displaced towards the image plane
</p>
<p>&bull; If photon B is detected at the focal plane of the lens, information about its
</p>
<p>distance from the propagation axis before the lens is lost, and thus information
</p>
<p>about through which slit A proceeds is lost as well. The momentum of both
</p>
<p>photons is well defined and an interference pattern appears behind the two slit
</p>
<p>plane (wave feature). Photons are collected one by one, and the observed count
</p>
<p>rate implies that the average spatial distance between photons is at least of the
</p>
<p>order of 100,000 km.
</p>
<p>&bull; One can find through which slit A proceeds through, by detecting B at the image
</p>
<p>plane (particle feature), since there is a one-to-one relationship between positions
</p>
<p>on this plane and the double slit. No interference pattern appears in this case.
</p>
<p>&bull; Interference pattern and path information are mutually exclusive results. There-
</p>
<p>fore, Bohr&rsquo;s complementarity (Sect. 15.5.1) appears as a consequence that it is
</p>
<p>not possible to position detector B simultaneously at the focal and at the image
</p>
<p>plane. Intermediate situations are also possible, the visibility of the interference
</p>
<p>pattern being reduced by placing detector B between the focal and the image
</p>
<p>plane: the experiment displays a continuous complementarity.
</p>
<p>&bull; After detection of A, one can arbitrarily delay detection ofB , either at the focal or
</p>
<p>at the image plane. Thus the possibility of detecting or not detecting a diffraction
</p>
<p>pattern is decided after the detection of the diffracted photon. According to
</p>
<p>this result, it has been claimed that the future can modify the past, in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. However, this interpretation is incorrect, since the prediction of the
</p>
<p>outcome requires a total specification of the experimental setup, including the
</p>
<p>position of all detectors (see Bohr&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;phenomenon,&rdquo; Sect. 2.4.1).
</p>
<p>&bull; Registration of A behind the double slit results in a Fraunhofer double slit pattern
</p>
<p>for B at the focal point, although B never proceeded through a double slit. This
</p>
<p>result has been interpreted as a consequence of the fact that the state incident on
</p>
<p>the double slit is a wave packet with appropriate momentum distribution such that
</p>
<p>the probability density has a peak at both slits. By virtue of the strong momentum
</p>

</p>
<p>If each particle is detected by a Stern&ndash;Gerlach detector (Fig. 2.4c) and if the two
</p>
<p>detectors are oriented along the same direction, particle 2 will be detected in the
</p>
<p>same spin state as particle 1, independently of their mutual distance. Einstein,
</p>
<p>Podolsky and Rosen [16] admitted the validity of this quantum prediction, but
</p>
<p>concluded about the incompleteness of quantum mechanics using the following
</p>
<p>argument2:
</p>
<p>&bull; The state of particles exists independently of observation (the notion of physical
</p>
<p>reality stated in Sect. 2.1).
</p>
<p>&bull; A measurement of particle 1 cannot affect the state of particle 2 if they are at
</p>
<p>sufficient macroscopic distance (notion of locality).
</p>
<p>Thus, particle 2 must have carried information about its spin state before detection
</p>
<p>of particle 1. Therefore, there must be an underlying mechanism &ndash; usually called
</p>
<p>hidden variable &ndash; completing quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>In 1964 John Bell realized that local realism, as understood by EPR, was incom-
</p>
<p>patible with quantum mechanics [81]. He devised a thought experiment in which
</p>
<p>the two fundamental world views would yield different results. Thus physical facts,
</p>
<p>and not philosophical considerations, could decide between these points of view.
</p>
<p>A double Stern&ndash;Gerlach apparatus is improved by allowing each of the two
</p>
<p>detectors to rotate around the beam axis (y-axis). They may be oriented along one
</p>
<p>of the three directions (Fig. 12.3): along the z-axis (orientation a); making an angle
</p>
<p>of 2&nbsp;=3 with it (orientation b); an angle of 4&nbsp;=3 (orientation c). In the following,
</p>
<p>the notation .˛1; ˛2/ labels the position of the detectors 1 and 2, respectively. For
</p>
<p>instance, .a; c/ means that detector 1 points along the z-axis, and detector 2 is
</p>
<p>oriented at an angle 4&nbsp;=3 relative to this axis. It is assumed that the orientations
</p>
<p>of the two detectors are totally uncorrelated. Moreover, no connections between
</p>
<p>source and detectors or between detectors are allowed.
</p>
<p>In the first place, we analyze the problem from the point of view of local realism.3
</p>
<p>The instructions carried by each particle are of the form xaxbxc , meaning that if the
</p>
<p>2The present argument is the spin version of the EPR original one. The adaptation is due to David
</p>
<p>Bohm [80].

<p>position, the three axes a; b; c lie on the same plane perpendicular to the trajectories
</p>
<p>detector is at the j th position .j D a; b; c/, the result of the measurement is xj
(xj D 0; 1).
</p>
<p>There are eight possible sets of instructions, namely: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100,
</p>
<p>101, 110, 111. It is unimportant which set is valid during a given run. It is important,
</p>
<p>however, that the two particles carry the same set, because it is an experimental fact
</p>
<p>that the same result is obtained for both particles if the two detectors display the
</p>
<p>same orientation (Bohm-EPR experiment).
</p>
<p>Let us exclude for the moment the instruction sets 000 and 111. For any of the
</p>
<p>remaining six sets, the same results are obtained for both particles in five cases, and
</p>
<p>opposite results in four cases. For instance, if the instruction set is 011, the pairs
</p>
<p>(aa),(bb),(bc),(cb),(cc) yield the same result, while opposite results are obtained
</p>
<p>from (ab),(ac),(ba),(ca).
</p>
<p>It is obvious that the two excluded sets of instructions can only increase the
</p>
<p>possibility that the two counters yield the same result. Therefore, the probability of
</p>
<p>obtaining the same result must always be � 5=9 (Bell inequality).
Let us now perform a quantum analysis of the experiment. According to (5.25),
</p>
<p>the expression of state ϕ
.a/
0 D ϕ0 in the basis corresponding to the orientations b; c is

</p>
<p>Since only the relative angle between the two detectors matters, we can assume
</p>
<p>without loss of generality that particle 1 has been detected in the state ϕ0 with the
apparatus in the orientationa. The probabilities of the different outcomes for particle
</p>
<p>2 are given in Table 12.1. The sum of probabilities for each orientation divided
</p>
<p>by the number of orientations yields the same probability for obtaining equal or
</p>
<p>opposite results, at odds with the prediction of local realism. An identical argument
</p>
<p>applies if particle 1 was to be detected in the state ϕ
.a/
1 .
</p>
<p>At the time of Bell&rsquo;s publication it was not possible to perform an experimental
</p>
<p>test. In the first successful attempt, spin 1/2 particles were replaced by two photons
</p>
<p>emitted in a radiative J D 0 ! J D 0 cascade using Ca atoms as sources (1981).
As expected for entangled photons, the same polarization state was verified for both
</p>
<p>of them. A Bell inequality somewhat different from the one explained above was</p>

<p>used. The experiment contradicted the prediction of local realism and confirmed the
</p>
<p>existence of the quantum correlation [83].
</p>
<p>The localization aspect was treated by increasing the distance between the two
</p>
<p>detectors as far as 13 m, so no signal from one to the other counter could be
</p>
<p>transmitted at subluminal velocities before detection.
</p>
<p>However, two loopholes remained open.4 One of them consisted of the possibility
</p>
<p>that the apparatus settings could be known by the detectors and/or by the source
</p>
<p>before registration of the photons. This loophole was closed by introducing the
</p>
<p>parametric down conversion (Sect. 12.3), by increasing distances to 355 m and by
</p>
<p>changing the measurement settings according to a random-number generator in a
</p>
<p>time scale much shorter than the photon time of flight (1/13). The importance of the
</p>
<p>last feature stresses the relevance of this experiment [84].
</p>
<p>Another logical loophole consisted of the possibility that the detected photons
</p>
<p>were not faithful representatives of all photons emitted, most of which were lost.
</p>
<p>This possibility was ruled out by observing nearly all entangled pairs of ions in a
</p>
<p>cavity [87].
</p>
<p>Today it is possible to violate Bell inequalities by many standard deviations
</p>
<p>in short times. Moreover, in case of Schrödinger cat states with three and four
</p>
<p>photons (see Sect. 14.2), situations exist in which predictions of quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>and local realism are exactly the opposite. Experiments have again confirmed the
</p>
<p>quantum prediction.
</p>
<p>12.3.3 Single Quantum Systems
</p>
<p>Starting in the 1970s, it became possible to manipulate and observe single quantum
</p>
<p>objects, such as a photon or an ion. Improvements in the knowledge of certain
</p>
<p>quantities, such as the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron (Sect. 5.2.2) were obtained
</p>
<p>through the trapping of an electron on a macroscopic time scale with electric and
</p>
<p>magnetic fields. It has also been possible to verify the indistinguishability between
</p>
<p>two electrons or two atoms of the same element, a key fact in quantum physics.
</p>
<p>Moreover, many thought and counterintuitive experiments became experimentally
</p>
<p>feasible.
</p>
<p>A common feature of the ion and photon trap experiments is that the Jaynes&ndash;
</p>
<p>Cummings model can be applied if the bipartite interacting system (field plus atom)
</p>
<p>substitutes the quantum oscillator and the two-state system of Sect. 3.4. In this

</p>
<p>In one kind of experiment, an ion is confined to a region around equilibrium,
</p>
<p>the oscillations being reduced to zero-point fluctuations. Laser beams are used to
</p>
<p>manipulate the ion, to cool down its motion and to &ldquo;see&rdquo; it. The internal evolution
</p>
<p>can also be monitored, since the ion scatters laser light resonant with the distance
</p>
<p>between two levels. The light becomes invisible, however, if the ion &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; into
</p>
<p>a non-resonant third level. The scattered light suddenly reappears if the ion returns
</p>
<p>to one of the two levels resonating with the laser light. Figure 12.4 represents laser-
</p>
<p>induced fluorescence of a barium ion on the ϕ6p ! ϕ6s transition versus time.

<p>with just one electron or atom or (small) molecule. In thought-experiments we
</p>
<p>sometimes assume that we do; this invariably entails ridiculous consequences...&rdquo;
</p>
<p>(quoted in [37]).
</p>
<p>If many ions are present, the trap confining potential competes with the Coulomb
</p>
<p>repulsion and a quasi-crystalline order is observed.

<p>12.3.4 A Quantum, Man-Made Mechanical Object
</p>
<p>During 2010, quantum effects in the motion of a human-made object were experi-
</p>
<p>mentally observed for the first time [88]. A mechanical resonator &ndash; an oscillator &ndash;</p>

</p>
<p>displayed an isolated frequency such that &bdquo;! D 2:6 � 10�5 eV. It was cooled
at 0.1 K using conventional cryogenic refrigeration, and thus &bdquo;!=kBT � 3.
Quantum measurements of the resonator were made using a superconducting qubit
</p>
<p>as a measurement device. The coupled system can be described by the Jaynes&ndash;
</p>
<p>Cummings model (Sect. 3.4). The system has proved to be much more stable than
</p>
<p>the resonator plus a classical measuring device. The following features appeared
</p>
<p>experimentally:
</p>
<p>&bull; The mechanical resonator was cooled to its ground state. The estimated number
</p>
<p>of phonons was h0jnj0i D 0:07.
&bull; An individual quantum excitation (phonon) could be created in the resonator and
</p>
<p>the exchange of this excitation between the resonator and the entangled qubit was
</p>
<p>observed.
</p>
<p>&bull; A superposition state was generated in the resonator, with a qubit response in
</p>
<p>good agreement with theory.
</p>
<p>Therefore, quantum mechanics applies as well to a mechanical object large enough
</p>
<p>to be seen with the naked eye.
</p>
<p>However, one may not conclude that present experimental successes have proved
</p>
<p>the validity of quantum mechanics. It is worthwhile to remember that experiments
</p>
<p>can only prove that a theory is not correct, if their results contradict predictions of
</p>
<p>the theory. In the future, we expect more and even more subtle tests on the validity
</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics.</p>

</p>
<p>Quantum Information
</p>
<p>13.1 Conceptual Framework
</p>
<p>Assume for a moment that the Hilbert space is restricted to the pure basis states.1
</p>
<p>For a single qubit, the only available states would thus be the two states (12.1). For
</p>
<p>n qubits, there are 2n orthogonal product vectors ϕ
.n/
i in a space of 2
</p>
<p>n dimensions.
</p>
<p>Classical computation operates in this space. Linear combinations of vectors are
</p>
<p>not allowed. Therefore, the only operations that can be performed are permutations
</p>
<p>between the basis states (unless the size of the space is changed).
</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics allows for superpositions &permil;.n/ of the basis vectors ϕ
.n/
i
</p>
<p>with complex amplitudes ci (2.6). Quantum operations are only limited by the
</p>
<p>requirement of unitarity, i.e. the norm of the state should be preserved. Therefore,
</p>
<p>classical states and classical operations constitute sets of vanishingly small size
</p>
<p>relative to those sets encompassing quantum states and quantum operations. Thus,
</p>
<p>quantum information offers a wealth of new possibilities: all kinds of interference
</p>
<p>effects may take place in the much larger space, much faster calculations can
</p>
<p>be performed if all components of the state vector work in parallel, and so on.
</p>
<p>Quite typically, the time for solving a problem may increase either exponentially
</p>
<p>or polynomially with its complexity. By taking advantage of interference and
</p>
<p>entanglement, a problem with an exponential increase in a classical computer may
</p>
<p>be transformed into a problem with polynomial increase in the quantum case.
</p>
<p>However, this promising picture is limited by the fact that it is very difficult to
</p>
<p>extract anything from the state vector &permil;.n/, despite the immense amount of informa-
</p>
<p>tion that it carries. In fact, the only way is to perform a measurement, which relates
</p>
<p>&permil;.n/ to a single probability jci j2. Therefore, the strategy consists in producing trans-
formations that lead to a state .&permil;0/.n/, in which very few amplitudes c0i do not vanish.

<p>A quantum process starts with the preparation of the system in some initial state

</p>
<p>state ϕ
.n/
f (see Sects. 2.4 and 2.5). Measurements are a class of transformations
</p>
<p>that provide classical information but change the state irreversibly. Between any
</p>
<p>two measurement operations, quantum transformations are unitary operations that
</p>
<p>change the state of the system in a deterministic and reversible way. A quantum
</p>
<p>algorithm is a unitary operation that may be represented by successive unitary
</p>
<p>operations (9.7) &ndash; quantum gates (Sect. 13.5*).
</p>
<p>A collection of n qubits is called a quantum register of size n. We assume that
</p>
<p>information is stored in the register in binary form. An n-register can store the
</p>
<p>numbers J D 0; 1; : : : ; .2n�1/. A quantum register of size 1 can store the numbers
0 and 1; of size 2, the numbers 0,1,2 and 3; etc.
</p>
<p>We do not attempt to give a complete description of the recent developments
</p>
<p>on quantum information. Rather, we use the respectable knowledge of quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics which readers should now have to illustrate these new uses with
</p>
<p>pertinent examples: quantum cryptography (Sect. 13.2); teleportation (Sect. 13.3)
</p>
<p>and quantum computation (Sect. 13.4&#142;).
</p>
<p>A presentation of the most common gates used in quantum information processes
</p>
<p>is made in Sect. 13.5*.
</p>
<p>13.2 Quantum Cryptography
</p>
<p>Traditional strategies for keeping secrets in the distribution of cryptographic keys
</p>
<p>depend on human factors, so their safety is difficult to assess. As a consequence,
</p>
<p>they have been replaced to a large extent by cryptosystems. A cryptographic key
</p>
<p>is transmitted through a succession of numbers 0 and 1. Their present safety is
</p>
<p>due to the fact that, with classical computers, no fast algorithms can work out the
</p>
<p>decomposition of a large number in prime factors. However, this statement may
</p>
<p>no longer be true with the advent of quantum computation (see Sect. 13.4&#142;). Hence
</p>
<p>the continuing interest in exploring safer systems for transmission of cryptographic
</p>
<p>keys. In this section, we show that the quantum key distributions are impossible to
</p>
<p>break, and that this impossibility arises from fundamental quantum laws.
</p>
<p>A well-known protocol is called BB84 [89]: every actor involved is provided with
</p>
<p>a filter of the type discussed in Sect. 2.5.1. The encoder (usually named Alice) can
</p>
<p>send particles that are in an eigenstate of either OSz or OSx. We label the corresponding
states by ϕ0, ϕ1, &brvbar;0, &brvbar;1. The decoder (frequently called Bob) may orient his
detection equipment along either the z- or the x-direction. For instance, if Alice has
</p>
<p>sent three qubits that are polarized according to "z, "x and #x, and if Bob aligns
his apparatus in the z-direction for the first qubit and the x-direction for the last two,
</p>
<p>he will detect intensities 1, 1 and 0 with certainty. These are the good qubits, i.e.
</p>
<p>those sent and measured with both pieces of apparatus along the same orientation.
</p>
<p>If Alice sends a qubit in the ϕ0 state while Bob orients his equipment towards the
x-direction, he may detect the intensities 1 or 0 with equal probability. Bad qubits
</p>
<p>are those in which the sender and receiver apparatus have different orientations.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.3 Teleportation 235
</p>
<p>For each qubit sent, Alice records the eigenvalue as well as the orientation of
</p>
<p>her filter. Bob selects his orientations at random and informs Alice of them. With
</p>
<p>this knowledge, Alice can tell Bob which ones are good qubits, the ones which are
</p>
<p>kept in order to codify the message. Both messages from Bob and Alice can even be
</p>
<p>made over an open phone, since they carry no information useful for a third party.
</p>
<p>Let us assume that there is an eavesdropper, usually called Eve. Eve cannot
</p>
<p>be prevented from eavesdropping, but if she does, Alice and Bob will know:
</p>
<p>let us assume that Alice has sent a qubit in the ϕ1 state, that Eve&rsquo;s apparatus
is in orientation x, and Bob&rsquo;s in orientation z. Eve&rsquo;s measurement increases the
</p>
<p>probability that Bob will detect the particle from 0 to 1=4 [D jhϕ1j&brvbar;0ih&brvbar;0jϕ0ij2, see
(3.21)]. Bob chooses a random subset of the good qubits that he has retained, and
</p>
<p>communicates them to Alice, also publicly. Alice may find discrepancies between
</p>
<p>her notes and Bob&rsquo;s message. If she does not, all good qubits constitute a perfect
</p>
<p>secret between Alice and Bob.
</p>
<p>Quantum cryptography applies the rule that quantum states are perturbed by the
</p>
<p>act of measurement, unless the observer knows in advance what observables can be
</p>
<p>measured without being perturbed (Sect. 2.4). Eve cannot succeed without knowing
</p>
<p>the basis common to both Alice and Bob.
</p>
<p>Commercial equipment for bank transfers by means of quantum cryptography is
</p>
<p>available, within city boundaries.
</p>
<p>13.3 Teleportation
</p>
<p>Alice and Bob are at a macroscopic distance from each other. Alice&rsquo;s particle is
</p>
<p>initially in the &permil;c state
</p>
<p>&permil;c D c0ϕ0 C c1ϕ1 : (13.1)
The objective is to put Bob&rsquo;s particle in the same state, but without transporting
</p>
<p>the particle or sending any classical information about it.
</p>
<p>Alice and Bob start by each taking one of the two qubits which have been
</p>
<p>prepared, for instance in the Bell state ϕB0 (12.5). Alice now has two qubits, one
in the state &permil;c and the other in the Bell state (see Fig. 13.1). The three-qubit state
</p>
<p>can be written as
</p>
<p>&permil;.3/ D &permil;cϕB0

<p>Fig. 13.1 Scheme illustrating the process of teleportation. Dashed lines represent entangled qubits
</p>
<p>in the state ϕB0 , while the dotted line indicates that classical information is transmitted
</p>
<p>where the qubit taken by Bob from the Bell state has been explicitly separated and
</p>
<p>the two qubits in Alice&rsquo;s posesion have been expressed in terms of Bell states.
</p>
<p>Alice now filters her two qubits into a well-defined Bell state (Problem 10).
</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Bob&rsquo;s qubit is also projected into a well-defined state, but Bob
</p>
<p>ignores the relation between this state and the initial state &permil;c . Bob needs to know
</p>
<p>in which Bell state the system has collapsed to reconstruct the original qubit. This
</p>
<p>information must be provided by Alice by conventional means, i.e. at a speed less
</p>
<p>than or equal to the velocity of light.
</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that instead of going through the previous procedure, Alice
</p>
<p>constructs the state &permil;c by filtering the spin, and sends the information about the
</p>
<p>alignment axis to Bob, who can thus filter the particle in the same direction. Are
</p>
<p>there still advantages in teleportation? The answer is affirmative, for the following
</p>
<p>reasons:
</p>
<p>&bull; The teleported state &permil;c might not be known by Alice. If she attempts to measure
</p>
<p>it, the state of the qubit could be changed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Bob receives complete information about Alice&rsquo;s qubit at the expense of that
</p>
<p>qubit: in quantum teleportation the original qubit is destroyed. This is a manifes-
</p>
<p>tation of the no-cloning theorem (Sect. 2.6.2).
</p>
<p>&bull; The qubit &permil;c is determined by the amplitudes c0; c1, for which the transmission
</p>
<p>time increases with the required precision. Now the results of the quantum
</p>
<p>experiments are discrete numbers. In quantum teleportation, discrete information
</p>
<p>about the Bell state is transformed into continuous information about the state of
</p>
<p>the qubit.
</p>
<p>Quantum teleportation was discovered in 1993 [90]. It was observed for the first
</p>
<p>time in 1997 with entangled photons [91].</p>

<p>13.4 Quantum Computation 237
</p>
<p>13.4&#142; Quantum Computation
</p>
<p>We describe the factorization procedure as one of the few &ldquo;best typical&rdquo; examples of
</p>
<p>the still unharnessed power of quantum computers.2 Note that the security of widely
</p>
<p>used encryption codes rests on the present practical impossibility of breaking a large
</p>
<p>number N in its prime factors, using classical computers.
</p>
<p>13.4.1&#142; Factorization
</p>
<p>Factorization of a number in its prime components makes use of the following
</p>
<p>property: Let a be coprime with N (no common factors) and define the function
</p>
<p>faN .J / � aJ ;modN: (13.3)
</p>
<p>This function has at least two important properties:
</p>
<p>&bull; It is periodic. For instance, if a D 2, N D 15, the successive values of the
function f are 1; 2; 4; 8; 1; 2 and so on. Thus, the period P D 4.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provided that P is even, the greatest common divisors of the pairs
</p>
<p>.aP=2 C 1;modN/ and .aP=2 � 1;modN/ are factors of N . In the present
example, they are 5 and 3, respectively.
</p>
<p>The level of complexity in the calculation of the period using a classical computer is
</p>
<p>as large as any other factorization algorithm. By contrast, there exists the following
</p>
<p>quantum algorithm due to Schor [93]:
</p>
<p>1. The operation makes use of a control register (left) and a target register (right).

</p>
<p>; (13.12)
</p>
<p>where L D log2 N is essentially the number of bits required to represent N . The
number �q of universal quantum gates needed to implement Schor&rsquo;s algorithm has
</p>
<p>been estimated to be
</p>
<p>�q.N / D L2 .log2 L/ .log2 log2 L/ : (13.13)
</p>
<p>Thus, the factorization is transformed from a problem in which time increases
</p>
<p>exponentially, to a problem in which it increases only polynomially. It has been
</p>
<p>estimated that the factorization time of a 400-digit number can be reduced from the
</p>
<p>age of the universe to a few years [77].
</p>
<p>A variety of two-level quantum systems has been considered. Modern exper-
</p>
<p>imental techniques allow us to orient their spins (or equivalent observables)
</p>
<p>and to implement the gates. However, the situation becomes drastically more
</p>
<p>complicated when operating a large scale computer, combining many gates. The
</p>
<p>greatest problems lie in alteration of states due to decoherence, i.e. the unavoidable
</p>
<p>coupling with a surrounding medium (Sect. 14.2&#142;). Up to now, the successes of
</p>
<p>quantum computation have been limited to the decomposition of small numbers into
</p>
<p>their prime factors [94]. The number of operational qubits can still be expressed
</p>
<p>with one digit, while many thousand qubits would be neeeded for the envisaged
</p>
<p>applications.
</p>
<p>It is true that we cannot ignore the example of the path traveled &ldquo;from the
</p>
<p>Pascal machine to the Pentium processor.&rdquo; There exist new strategies for partially
</p>
<p>controlling the effects of decoherence. For instance, by redundancy. The fact that
</p>
<p>this problem is linked to defence and financial activities has undoubtedly contributed
</p>
<p>to intense endeavors on the subject. But we should bear in mind that the interest in
</p>
<p>quantum computing is not limited to those applications: the physics involved in
</p>
<p>experiments with entangled particles is helping us to obtain a better understanding
</p>
<p>of the most fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>13.5* Quantum Gates
</p>
<p>A quantum gate is a device that performs a unitary transformation on selected qubits
</p>
<p>at a certain time. A quantum network is a device consisting of quantum gates that
</p>
<p>are synchronized in time.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>240 13 Quantum Information
</p>
<p>It can be proved that any unitary operation in a system of qubits may be
</p>
<p>reproduced by a sequence of one- and two-qubit operations, which constitutes a
</p>
<p>practical advantage from the engineering point of view. Manipulations of a single
</p>
<p>qubit may be performed by controlling a magnetic field at its site (Sect. 9.2).
</p>
<p>Simultaneous manipulations of two qubits require an interaction between them.
</p>
<p>Therefore we use a controlling Hamiltonian

<p>b ; (13.14)
</p>
<p>where summation over space indices a; b D x; y; z is understood (see Problem 9 in
Chap. 6 and Problem 7 in Chap. 9). This Hamiltonian satisfies the requirements for
</p>
<p>controlling a quantum computer. In fact, it even exceeds them. The Hadamard gate,
</p>
<p>all the phase gates and the controlled-NOT gate constitute a universal set of gates,
</p>
<p>although this set is not unique. Any transformation between the n-states of a register
</p>
<p>may be constructed from them.
</p>
<p>Interactions with the measurement device and with the environment should also
</p>
<p>be taken into account.
</p>
<p>13.5.1* One-Qubit Systems

<p>Interpretations of Measurements.
</p>
<p>Decoherence. Density Matrix
</p>
<p>The problem of getting the interpretation proved to be rather
</p>
<p>more difficult than just working out the equations [95].
</p>
<p>Problems associated with the interpretation of the measurement processes are
</p>
<p>revisited in the present chapter. A brief survey of the orthodox line of thought is
</p>
<p>outlined in Sect. 14.1. Huge amounts of ink and paper have been devoted to the
</p>
<p>presentation of improved interpretations, without any of them having generated
</p>
<p>a general consensus.1 However, a novel explanation of the coexistence between
</p>
<p>quantum and classical descriptions, based on the notion of decoherence, has
</p>
<p>been developed since the 1980s. The emergence of classicality from the quantum
</p>
<p>substrate interacting with the environment, outlined in Sect. 14.2&#142;, appears to be
</p>
<p>a consistent approach. Its application to the measurement process is described in
</p>
<p>Sect. 14.3&#142;.
</p>
<p>In the present chapter, use is made of the density matrix, another formulation of
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics. It is appropriate for treating two entangled systems of which
</p>
<p>we have access to only one of them. The associated formalism is presented in
</p>
<p>Sect. 14.4.
</p>
<p>14.1 Orthodox Interpretations
</p>
<p>So far, predictions of quantum mechanics for isolated microsystems have never
</p>
<p>failed. However, the macroworld cannot be altogether forgotten even in the extreme
</p>
<p>Copenhagen interpretation, since it plays at least an essential role in the measure-
</p>
<p>ment process connecting quantum and classical systems.
</p>
<p>If the quantum state of a system is denoted by &permil;.t0/ at t D t0, the system evolves
swiftly and deterministically to the state &permil;.t1/ at t D t1, in accordance with the
time-dependent Schrödinger equation. However, if a measurement takes place, it
</p>
<p>changes suddenly and impredictably.
</p>
<p>1A critical discussion on alternative interpretations can be found, for instance, in [97].

<p>246 14 Interpretations of Measurements. Decoherence. Density Matrix
</p>
<p>None of the difficulties with the collapse principle has been so caricatured as the
</p>
<p>one due to Schrödinger [96]. He imagined an unstable nucleus inside a box. Its decay
</p>
<p>product, an ˛-particle, may free some poison that would also kill a cat staying inside
</p>
<p>the box.2 Let S0, S1 represent the two states of the system (not-decayed-atom and
</p>
<p>decayed-atom) and C0, C1 those of the cat (alive and dead). The quantum evolution
</p>
<p>implies
</p>
<p>S0 C ! S0 C0;
S1 C ! S1 C1; (14.1)
</p>
<p>where C is an initial, ready state for the cat. If the atom is in a quantum superposition,
</p>
<p>the linear evolution requires3
</p>
<p>.c0S0 C c1S1/ C ! c0S0C0 C c1S1C1: (14.2)
</p>
<p>The collapse principle that we have been applying so far tells us that the cat will
</p>
<p>be either dead or alive after the measurement. Note that the composite systemC cat
is in an entangled state at the beginning of the measurement. Thus neither the atom
</p>
<p>nor the cat are in a definite state. But a superposition of an alive and a dead cat has
</p>
<p>never been seen!4
</p>
<p>Two orthodox interpretations are outlined in the following sections:
</p>
<p>14.1.1 The Standard Interpretation
</p>
<p>The standard interpretation is not much more than an enunciation of the basic
</p>
<p>Principle 3. Therefore, its main contents are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Every measurement performed on a quantum system induces a breakdown
</p>
<p>of the continuous evolution associated with the Schrödinger evolution, as a
</p>
<p>consequence of the collapse of the state &permil; into an eigenstate ϕn of the measured
observable Q.
</p>
<p>&bull; The probability of a particular outcome qn is given by jh&permil;jϕnij2.
&bull; It is the observer who chooses the observable to be measured.
</p>
<p>According to Zeilinger, &ldquo;If we accept that the quantum state is no more than a
</p>
<p>representation of the information we have, then the spontaneous change of the state
</p>
<p>upon observation, the so-called collapse or reduction of the wave packet, is just a
</p>
<p>2The link between the nuclear microsystem and the meter (the animal cat) goes through a chain of
</p>
<p>amplifying stages with intermediate systems (detector, poison, etc.) also getting correlated. In the
</p>
<p>text, we use the word &ldquo;cat&rdquo; to represent all of these items plus the animal.
3A similar operation may be accomplished by the controlled-NOT gate (13.21).

</p>
<p>very natural consequence of the fact that, upon observation, our information changes
</p>
<p>and therefore we have to change our representation of the information, that is, the
</p>
<p>quantum state.&rdquo; [78].
</p>
<p>14.1.2 The Copenhagen Interpretation
</p>
<p>Although the standard interpretation has often been confused with the Copenhagen
</p>
<p>interpretation, this last one includes the classical world in the process of measure-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>Intermediate classical apparatuses are necessary to convey to our classical minds
</p>
<p>the results of measurements on the quantum level. When particles are detected, the
</p>
<p>atoms of the detector become ionized, producing first a few electrons, and then
</p>
<p>a cascade of electrons. The state vector should take these macroscopic effects
</p>
<p>into account. Because of the linearity of the Schrödinger evolution, there is no
</p>
<p>mechanism to stop the evolution and yield a single result for the measurement.
</p>
<p>Ultimately the evolution may involve the observer&rsquo;s brain, since the disappear-
</p>
<p>ance of macroscopic superpositions is attributed to the existence of the observer.
</p>
<p>Some extreme advocates of this interpretation have even argued that this mechanism
</p>
<p>may be linked to the property of consciousness in the human brain. Thus, it has been
</p>
<p>argued that quantum mechanics has an anthropocentric foundation, a concept which
</p>
<p>had disappeared from science after the Middle Ages.
</p>
<p>However, the frontier between the quantum and the classical domains remained
</p>
<p>an ill-defined concept. This division was never accepted by Bell and other thinkers.
</p>
<p>In fact, there exist mesoscopic and even macroscopic quantum systems that
</p>
<p>are described with a global quantum wave function [Bose&ndash;Einstein condensates
</p>
<p>(Sect. 7.5&#142;), superconductors (Sect. 10.1), neutron stars, etc.].
</p>
<p>14.2&#142; The Emergence of Classicality from the Quantum
</p>
<p>Substrate. Decoherence
</p>
<p>In this section we present a derivation of Newtonian mechanics as a limiting case
</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics.5 Zurek was the first to emphasize the relevance of the
</p>
<p>interaction of systems with the environment [99], which in this case is represented
</p>
<p>by the initial state ε and the two states ε0 and ε1 that are obtained through the linear
evolution
</p>
<p>ϕ0 ε! ϕ0 ε0;
ϕ1 ε ! ϕ1 ε1: (14.3)

<p>The system&ndash;environment interaction frequently manifests through a scattering

.jϕ0ihϕ0j C jϕ1ihϕ1j/ : (14.5)
</p>
<p>In deriving the last line we have assumed that the environment states are almost
</p>
<p>orthogonal to each other. This assumption is based on the complexity of the
</p>
<p>environment: if, for instance, we consider a beam of light quanta impinging over
</p>
<p>the system, the overlap between states before and after the collision may not be very
</p>
<p>much smaller than one for each individual photon, but the overlap of N photons
</p>
<p>may be close to vanishing in the limit of large N . If this is the case, the density
</p>
<p>matrix becomes similar to the one associated with an uncorrelated admixture of two
</p>
<p>separate states and thus, it is not able to display interference phenomena. Moreover,
</p>
<p>the larger the system, the more likely that the environment states become mutually
</p>
<p>orthogonal.
</p>
<p>Therefore, classical macroscopic systems emerge as a consequence of being
</p>
<p>monitored by the rest of the universe. The environment acts as a device yielding
</p>
<p>information about which path in the two slit experiment (Fig. 2.5), which destroys
</p>
<p>the interference pattern.
</p>
<p>Equation (14.5) does not imply that the system is in a mixture of states ϕ0 and ϕ1.
Since these two states are simultaneously present in (14.4), the composite systemC
environment displays superposition and associated interferences. However, (14.5)
</p>
<p>says that such quantum manifestations will not appear as long as experiments are
</p>
<p>performed only on the system S. Thus, there has been a leakage of coherence from
</p>
<p>the system to the composite entity. Since we are not able to control this entity, the
</p>
<p>decoherence has been completed to all practical purposes.

<p>s and much less. In particular, the
</p>
<p>estimated decoherence times for neural superpositions (10�19&ndash;10�20) s is much
smaller than typical times for cognitive processes (10�2&ndash;1) s [98].
</p>
<p>In contrast with the states ϕ˙ of the system, the states ϕ0 and ϕ1 do not become
entangled with the environment, according to (14.3). We thus conclude that there
</p>
<p>are states less prone to decoherence than others. They are called pointer states and
</p>
<p>make up the pointer subspace of the Hilbert space of the system. They play two
</p>
<p>essential roles:
</p>
<p>&bull; Sets of pointer states are made up from states most immune to decoherence.
</p>
<p>The composite pointer state C environment remains in a product state at
all subsequent times. The selection of these states is determined through the
</p>
<p>structure of the system&ndash;environment Hamiltonian using methods developed in
</p>
<p>[99].
</p>
<p>&bull; Pointer states are also the states for which information is redundantly stored in
</p>
<p>a large number of fragments of the environment, in such a way that multiple
</p>
<p>observers can retrieve this information without disturbing the state of the system
</p>
<p>(as, for instance, through visual registration of photons that have been scattered
</p>
<p>from the system).
</p>
<p>Since these are characteristic features of classical systems, classical reality has
</p>
<p>emerged from the quantum substrate.
</p>
<p>Decoherence therefore explains why we do not see quantum superpositions
</p>
<p>in our everyday world: macroscopic objects are more difficult to keep isolated
</p>
<p>than microscopic objects. It also explains why spin up and down states are more
</p>
<p>easily preserved than their linear combinations through their interaction with the
</p>
<p>environment. This promising result is presently the subject of many studies.

<p>14.2 The Emergence of Classicality from the Quantum Substrate. Decoherence 251
</p>
<p>irreversible.9 The ϕ0 and ϕ1 are the pointer states of the simplified model and there
is decoherence.
</p>
<p>14.2.2&#142; An Experiment with Decoherence
</p>
<p>Since 1996, many experiments have demonstrated the dynamics of decoherence, by
</p>
<p>showing how superposition states become unobservable due to decoherence. In the
</p>
<p>following, we present one of such experiments.
</p>
<p>As mentioned in Sect. 2.5.2, two-slit experiments were carried out even with
</p>
<p>relatively large objects such as fullerenes. The &ldquo;matter&rdquo; category of these objects
</p>
<p>appears evident from the fact that a molecule C70 has more than 10
3 particle
</p>
<p>components (electrons and nucleons). It is also possible to assign to them a
</p>
<p>temperature, and thermal radiation has also been observed.
</p>
<p>A variation of the two-slit experiment consists of an application of the Talbot&ndash;
</p>
<p>Lau effect: if a wave impinges perpendicularly on a grating composed of parallel
</p>
<p>slits, as a consequence of interference the pattern of the grating will be reproduced
</p>
<p>at multiples of the distance L�Dd 2=�. Here d is the spacing between adjacent slits
and �, the wavelength.
</p>
<p>Experiments clearly display the oscillatory fluctuations in the density of the
</p>
<p>C70 molecule along an axis perpendicular both to the incident direction and to the
</p>
<p>grating, at the distance L�. The confirmation of the existence of interference effects
</p>
<p>due to the Talbot&ndash;Lau effect was obtained by varying the velocity of the particles
</p>
<p>and thus the wavelength according to the de Broglie prescription.
</p>
<p>Decoherence is produced by collisions between C70 molecules and molecules
</p>
<p>in the background gas. The amount of decoherence can be tuned by changing the
</p>
<p>density of the gas. Let us define the visibility factor as the ratio
</p>
<p>V D Imax � Imin
Imax C Imin
</p>
<p>; (14.13)
</p>
<p>where Imax and Imin are the maximum and minimum amplitudes in the interference
</p>
<p>pattern, respectively. The visibility decays exponentially with the increase in the
</p>
<p>density, as shown in Fig. 14.1.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus these experiments provide impressive direct evidence for how the interac-
</p>
<p>tion with the environment gradually delocalizes the quantum coherence required for
</p>
<p>the interference effects to be observed... So we can smoothly navigate and explore
</p>
<p>the quantum-classical boundary, and we find our observations to be in excellent
</p>
<p>agreement with theoretical predictions.&rdquo; (M. Schlosshauer [98], p. 265).
</p>
<p>Decoherence is currently the subject of a great deal of research. Many questions
</p>
<p>have been clarified to a large extent in recent years. These include the rate of
</p>
<p>9This is due to the fact that (14.11) is a sum of periodic terms. However, for macroscopic
</p>
<p>environments of realistic size, Zurek has pointed out that �r can exceed the life of the universe.</p>

</p>
<p>14.3&#142; Quantum Measurements
</p>
<p>A quantum measurement is an experiment coupling a microscopic system to a
</p>
<p>macroscopic meter. This last piece of the experiment is coupled to the environment.
</p>
<p>Decoherence ensures the classical description of the meter.
</p>
<p>The von Neumann scheme for measurements assumes that all states are quantum
</p>
<p>mechanical, including the much smaller set of classical states. This is a different
</p>
<p>starting point than the one upon which the Copenhagen interpretation is based.
</p>
<p>Even though the possible superpositions in Hilbert space are potentially expanded
</p>
<p>with the Schrödinger equation, we have seen in Sect. 14.2&#142; that the process of
</p>
<p>decoherence, i.e. the interaction between systems and environment, leads to the
</p>
<p>elimination of quantum superposition effects within the observed system, and to
</p>
<p>the selection of a small subset of classical, pointer states [100].
</p>
<p>In the following, we sketch how this may be applied for the measurement
</p>
<p>of a two-state system (Fig. 14.2). Consider, for instance Schrödinger&rsquo;s thought
</p>
<p>experiment. At the quantum end (left side of the figure) the microsystem is

<p>Fig. 14.2 Sketch of the measurement of a qubit. &ldquo;Rest&rdquo; is called &ldquo;environment&rdquo; in the text.
</p>
<p>Initially, there is a superposition of the two nuclear states. One of the two alternatives for the
</p>
<p>Schrödinger cat occurs at the classical end. (Reproduced from J. Roederer [20], with permission
</p>
<p>from Springer-Verlag)
</p>
<p>We consider a quantum apparatus Z (cat et al.) with a Hilbert space spanned by
</p>
<p>the two states χ1; χ0. One can assume that the initial state of the binary microsystem-
apparatus is
</p>
<p>&permil;S;Z.0/ D .c0ϕ0 C c1ϕ1/ χ1: (14.15)
The entanglement of the composite system may be produced by means of the
</p>
<p>interaction represented by a controlled-NOT gate [see (13.22)]. It is represented
</p>
<p>by the two arrows linking the qubit with the apparatus. Thus,
</p>
<p>&permil;
S;Z
t D c0ϕ0χ1 C c1ϕ1χ0: (14.16)
</p>
<p>If the detector is in the state χ1, the microsystem is guaranteed to be found in the
state ϕ0, and vice versa. However, there is an ambiguity in a correlated state of
the form (14.16), since we may rotate both the system and the apparatus without
</p>
<p>changing &permil;
S;Z
t (see p. 221). The ambiguity may be superseded by introducing
</p>
<p>another system, the environment E , which is also represented by two quantum states
</p>
<p>ε1; ε0. From now on we apply the decoherence process to the composite system C
apparatus

<p>254 14 Interpretations of Measurements Decoherence Density Matrix
</p>
<p>Since we cannot control the environment, we are limited to evaluate expectation
</p>
<p>values of observables belonging to the (S;Z) subsystems. In the state (14.17), any
</p>
<p>such expectation value is

</p>
<p>The third term in this equation is responsible for introducing interference. Inter-
</p>
<p>action with the environment has the effect of modulating this interference term,
</p>
<p>whose magnitude is reduced by a factor determined by the absolute value of the
</p>
<p>overlap hε0jε1i. When this overlap is sufficiently small, quantum interference effects
become dynamically suppressed. The two (curved) arrows inside the box represent
</p>
<p>the correlation between the state of the system and the cat after decoherence has
</p>
<p>taken place.
</p>
<p>The classical end appears at the extreme right of the figure, the word &ldquo;Cbit&rdquo;
</p>
<p>labels the cat, either dead or alive (and the observer looking at it).
</p>
<p>As pointed out by M. Schlosshauer [98], p. 50, there are three issues in the
</p>
<p>measurement problem:
</p>
<p>1. The problem of non-observability of interference. Through the interaction with
</p>
<p>the environment, decoherence explains why patterns of interference between
</p>
<p>macroscopic objects dissapear and only one of the possible outcomes is observed.
</p>
<p>An observer would only see the Schrödinger cat either dead or alive, because the
</p>
<p>duration of the weird state (14.2) will be incredibly short in a system with so
</p>
<p>many components. &ldquo;Decoherence produces an effect that looks and smells like a
</p>
<p>collapse.&rdquo; [125].
</p>
<p>2. The problem of the preferred basis. The preferred states of the system&ndash;apparatus
</p>
<p>are those that become least entangled with the environment in the course of the
</p>
<p>evolution and are thus most immune to decoherence. If the interaction between
</p>
<p>the (microscopic) system and the environment is neglected, the different pointer
</p>
<p>positions of the apparatus are the robust preferred states &ldquo;superallowed&rdquo; by the
</p>
<p>environment.
</p>
<p>3. The question about why a particular outcome appears to the observer, rather than
</p>
<p>another possible one, is outside the domain of decoherence. It belongs to the
</p>
<p>philosophical aspects of the relation between quantum mechanics and reality.
</p>
<p>14.4 The Density Matrix
</p>
<p>The density matrix operator corresponding to a state &permil; is defined as the projector
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.4 The Density Matrix 255
</p>
<p>In particular, O�i D jiihi j is used in (2.57). The expectation value of an operator OQ
in the state ϕi is given by

</p>
<p>i 0
hi 0jiihi jQji 0i D hi jQjii: (14.20)
</p>
<p>If our system is in a state &permil;, the descriptions in terms of &permil; and in terms of the
</p>
<p>density matrix (14.19) are completely equivalent.
</p>
<p>14.4.1 Mixed Density Matrix
</p>
<p>In a mixed state we do not know in which state ϕi the system is. Therefore, only
probabilities �i can be ascribed to each state
</p>

</p>
<p>O� D

</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>�i jiihi j : (14.22)
</p>
<p>Thus, the present formalism is especially useful when we have less than complete
</p>
<p>information on the system. For instance, the silver atoms leaving the furnace in a
</p>
<p>Stern&ndash;Gerlach experiment are randomly oriented in space (as in Fig. 2.4). In this
</p>
<p>case, �C D �� D 1=2, the probabilities of the spin being up or down being the
same. We say that the system is in a mixed state and the density matrix is given by

</p>
<p>If �i 0 D ıi 0i , we say that the system is in a pure state, like all those that we have
studied so far in the present text. In this case the density matrix reduces to the
</p>
<p>projection jiihi j.
Some consequences of the definition (14.22) are:

</p>
<p>A Brief History of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>15.1 Social Context in Central Europe During the 1920s
</p>
<p>To continue the building analogy of Chap. 1, the theoretical foundations of physics
</p>
<p>were shaken at the beginning of the twentieth century. These tremors preceded those
</p>
<p>of the society as a whole. The historian Eric Hobsbawm has written [103]:
</p>
<p>The decades from the outbreak of the First World War to the aftermath of the second, were
</p>
<p>an Age of Catastrophe for this society [: : :] shaken by two world wars, followed by two
</p>
<p>waves of global rebellion and revolution [: : :]. The huge colonial empires, built up before
</p>
<p>and during the Age of the Empire, were shaken, and crumbled to dust. A world economic
</p>
<p>crisis of unprecedented depth brought even the strongest capitalistic economies to their
</p>
<p>knees and seemed to reverse the creation of a single universal world economy, which had
</p>
<p>been so remarkable an achievement of nineteenth-century liberal capitalism. Even the USA,
</p>
<p>safe from war and revolution, seemed close to collapse. While the economy tottered, the
</p>
<p>institutions of liberal democracy virtually disappeared between 1917 and 1942 from all but
</p>
<p>a fringe of Europe and parts of North America and Australasia, as Fascism and its satellite
</p>
<p>authoritarian movements and regimes advanced.
</p>
<p>Since quantum mechanics was developed for the most part in Northern and Central
</p>
<p>Europe (see Table 15.1), we will devote most of our attention here to the conditions
</p>
<p>prevailing at that time in Germany and Denmark.
</p>
<p>Hobsbawm&rsquo;s description applies particularly well to the case of Germany:
</p>
<p>while the Anglo-Saxon world and the wartime neutrals more or less succeeded in
</p>
<p>stabilizing their economies between 1922 and 1926, Germany was overwhelmed in
</p>
<p>1923 with economic, political and spiritual crises. Hunger riots erupted everywhere,
</p>
<p>as the value of the mark plunged to 10�12 of its pre-1913 value. Additional
difficulties arose from a repressed military putsch in North Germany, a separatist
</p>
<p>movement in the Rhineland, problems with France on the Rhur, and radical leftist
</p>
<p>tendencies in Saxony and Thuringia. In the East, Soviet Russia did not fare better.
</p>
<p>A cultural movement against dogmatic rationalism gained ground in German
</p>
<p>society after the war. A widely read book opposed causality to life, and assimilated
</p>
<p>physics into causality [104]. Moreover, a profound division along political, scientific
</p>
<p>and geographic lines started to grow in the German physics community. Right wing

</p>
<p>physicists were in general chauvinistic, ultraconservative, provincial, anti-Weimar
</p>
<p>and anti-Semitic. They were interested in the results of experiments and dissociated
</p>
<p>themselves from quantum and relativity theory. On the opposite side, the Berlin
</p>
<p>physicists were labeled as liberal and theoretical. Note, however, that the German
</p>
<p>physicists of that time, with the possible exception of Einstein and Born, could
</p>
<p>only be labeled as liberal or progressive in comparison with Johannes Stark and
</p>
<p>Philipp Lenard. The adjective &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; (appearing also in the name of Bohr&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>Institute in Copenhagen) would be translated today as &ldquo;fundamental.&rdquo; Although the
</p>
<p>main theoretical center was in Berlin, strong theoretical schools also flourished in
</p>
<p>Göttingen and Munich. The start of Nazi persecutions in the 1930s and the exclusion
</p>
<p>of Jews from the first group had consequences on the world distribution of physicists
</p>
<p>devoted to the most fundamental aspects of physics.
</p>
<p>After the First World War (1918) German physicists had been excluded from
</p>
<p>international collaborations, and the lack of foreign currency made it almost
</p>
<p>impossible to purchase foreign journals and equipment. However, a new national
</p>
<p>organization, the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft, created in 1920
</p>
<p>under the direction of Max von Laue and Max Planck, was instrumental in the
</p>
<p>provision of funds for scientific research. Atomic theorists in Berlin, Göttingen
</p>
<p>and Munich received sufficient funds to support the work of physicists like
</p>
<p>Heisenberg and Born. The foreign boycott was not observed by Scandinavia and the
</p>
<p>Netherlands: Bohr kept friendly relations with his German colleagues (see p. 267).
</p>
<p>Denmark had been on the decline at least since 1864, when it was defeated by
</p>
<p>Prussia and Austria with the resultant loss of about one-third of its territory. The
</p>
<p>years after the war represented a period of unprecedented turmoil in Denmark as
</p>
<p>well. For the first time in 400 years, this country teetered on the brink of revolution,
</p>
<p>although of a kind that was different from those experienced in neighboring coun-
</p>
<p>tries, disputes over the shift of the border with Germany, social struggles between
</p>
<p>town and country and fights for extensive reforms in employment conditions. All
</p>
<p>these difficulties added to the loss of wartime markets, and to trade deficits and
</p>
<p>inflation. In spite of such hardships, Bohr&rsquo;s new institute was inaugurated in 1921.
</p>
<p>The scientific and the social crisis during the first part of the twentieth century
</p>
<p>were both very profound. However, the first one was over by the end of the 1920s.
</p>
<p>The second one continued in crescendo until the aftermath of the Second World War
</p>
<p>(1945).
</p>
<p>15.2 Pre-history of Quantum Physics (1860 � t � 1900)
</p>
<p>Gustav Kirchhoff is at the origin of both radiation and matter branches of quantum
</p>
<p>physics.1 In 1860 he showed that the emissive power of a black-body E.�/
</p>
<p>depends only on the frequency � and on the temperature T and challenged both
</p>
<p>the experimentalists and theoreticians to find such dependence [108]. This search

</p>
<p>proved to be full of difficulties. Only in 1893 Wilhelm Wien demonstrated his
</p>
<p>displacement law and in 1896 he proposed the exponential dependence for the
</p>
<p>function f .�=T / in (15.1) [109]. In 1900 Planck modified this dependence with
</p>
<p>an extremely successful guess (15.2), that still holds today

</p>
<p>with Robert Bunsen [110]. The Balmer formula fitting the frequencies of the discrete

</p>
<p>understanding Balmer&rsquo;s formula for 28 years.
</p>
<p>15.3 Old Quantum Theory (1900 � t � 1925)
</p>
<p>15.3.1 Radiation
</p>
<p>Planck justified his law by means of an unorthodox way of counting partitions plus
</p>
<p>the quantum hypothesis: the (fictitious) oscillators of a black-body have energy [2]
</p>
<p>� D h� : (15.4)
</p>
<p>In 1905 Einstein showed that the expression for the increase of entropy with
</p>
<p>volume of a gas composed of non-interacting molecules becomes identical to the
</p>
<p>same quantity for monochromatic radiation obeying Wien exponential law (15.1),
</p>
<p>if in such expression the number of molecules n is replaced by E=h�, where E is
</p>
<p>the total energy. Thus, from purely thermodynamic arguments, Einstein concluded
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;... it seems reasonable to investigate whether the laws governing the emission
</p>
<p>and transformation of light are also constructed as if light consisted of ... energy
</p>
<p>quanta&rdquo; [3]. This proposal constituted a revolution, in view of the so far wholly
</p>
<p>accepted Maxwell&rsquo;s wave theory of light. Moreover, Einstein endowed Planck&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>oscillators with physical reality.
</p>
<p>On the basis of (15.4), Einstein interpreted the photoelectric effect as the total
</p>
<p>transfer of the photon2 energy to the electron, whose energy E is given by
</p>
<p>2The term &ldquo;photon&rdquo; was only coined during the 1920s.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>E D h� �W ; (15.5)
</p>
<p>where W is the work function of the metal. This relation was only confirmed
</p>
<p>experimentally in 1914 by Robert Millikan [111], although even then Millikan
</p>
<p>did not conclude in favor of Einstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;bold, not to say reckless hypothesis.&rdquo; In
</p>
<p>fact, from 1905 to 1923 Einstein was the only physicist seriously considering the
</p>
<p>existence of light quanta.
</p>
<p>From 1906 to 1911, quantum theory was Einstein&rsquo;s main concern (even more
</p>
<p>than the theory of relativity). He contributed to the specific heat of solids and to
</p>
<p>energy fluctuations of black-body radiation. In 1909, he foretold: &ldquo;It is my opinion
</p>
<p>that the next phase of theoretical physics will bring us a theory of light which can
</p>
<p>be interpreted as a kind of fusion of the wave and the emission theory.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Between 1916 and 1917 Einstein made fundamental contributions to the theory
</p>
<p>of radiation [64]. Combining classical thermodynamics and electromagnetism
</p>
<p>with Bohr&rsquo;s first two quantum postulates (Sect. 15.3.2), and assuming thermal
</p>
<p>equilibrium between atoms and radiation field, he derived:
</p>
<p>&bull; The concepts of spontaneous and induced emission and absorption, from which
</p>
<p>he could obtain Planck radiation law (15.2) (see Sect. 9.8.4&#142;).
</p>
<p>&bull; The momentum of the light particle h�=c which, together with the energy (1905),
</p>
<p>completes the properties of a quantum particle.
</p>
<p>&bull; The need of a probabilistic description, inherent to the concept of spontaneous
</p>
<p>emission
</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s 1917 paper carried the seeds of many developments in physics. However,
</p>
<p>he did not work by himself two rather immediate consequences:
</p>
<p>1. The scattering of an atom and a light particle. Such experiments made by
</p>
<p>Arthur Compton verified both the energy and the momentum conservation in
</p>
<p>these processes and thus confirmed the validity of the light quantum hypothe-
</p>
<p>sis3(1923, [4]).
</p>
<p>2. Satyendra Bose&rsquo;s derivation of Planck&rsquo;s law using symmetric states was trans-
</p>
<p>lated and submitted for publication by Einstein in 1924 [55]. The same year
</p>
<p>Einstein applied Bose&rsquo;s ideas to an ideal gas of particles [46] (see Sect. 7.5&#142; on
</p>
<p>Bose&ndash;Einstein condensation).
</p>
<p>However, a last storm over the light quanta was on the way (Sect. 15.5.2).
</p>
<p>3However, explanations based on classical electromagnetic fields and quantized processes of
</p>
<p>emission and absorption could only be completely ruled out after experimental evidence that there
</p>
<p>is no lower limit on the accumulation time of light energy in the photoelectric effect [112] or on
</p>
<p>the non-existence of correlations of a photon with itself [113].</p>

<p>15.3 Old Quantum Theory (1900 � t � 1925) 263
</p>
<p>15.3.2 Matter
</p>
<p>In 1911, the work of Rutherford&rsquo;s young colleagues Hans Geiger and Ernest
</p>
<p>Mardsen showed conclusively that a hydrogen atom consists of one electron outside
</p>
<p>the positively charged nucleus, where almost all the mass is concentrated [6]. At
</p>
<p>that time, electrons were supposed to be just particles. (Electron wave behavior was
</p>
<p>experimentally verified in [5].)
</p>
<p>Like Einstein in 1905, Bohr was aware that the postulates of his 1913 model [8]
</p>
<p>were in conflict with classical physics:
</p>
<p>&bull; An atom displays stationary states of energy En that do not radiate.
</p>
<p>&bull; Transitions between stationary states are accompanied by monochromatic radia-
</p>
<p>tion of frequency � satisfying the Balmer series
</p>
<p>h� D En �Em : (15.6)
</p>
<p>This assumption implied a renunciation of causality because of the absence of
</p>
<p>any directive for the transition.
</p>
<p>&bull; For large values of n, the quantum frequency � should agree with the classical
</p>
<p>frequency of light irradiated by the rotating electron. This correspondence
</p>
<p>principle constituted the main link between classical and quantum theory. (See
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.2 as an illustration of the survival of the correspondence principle in
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics.)
</p>
<p>The derivation of the Rydberg constant as a function of the mass and the charge
</p>
<p>of an electron and of Planck&rsquo;s constant, and the correct helium ion/hydrogen ratio
</p>
<p>to five significant figures, commanded the attention of the physics community.
</p>
<p>By means of his precise determination of X-ray energies, Henry Moseley gave
</p>
<p>further support to the Bohr model both through the assignment of a Z value to all
</p>
<p>known elements and the prediction of the still missing elements [114]. James Frank
</p>
<p>and Heinrich Hertz further confirmed the model by using the impact of electrons on
</p>
<p>atoms to excite their atomic spectrum [115]. The Bohr model appeared to work, in
</p>
<p>spite of its assumptions. To joke about the situation with the old quantum theory,
</p>
<p>Bohr used to tell the story of a visitor to his country home who noticed a horseshoe
</p>
<p>hanging over the entrance door. Puzzled, he asked Bohr if he really believed that
</p>
<p>this brought luck. The answer was: &ldquo;Of course not, but I am told it works even if
</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t believe in it.&rdquo; [107].
</p>
<p>Bohr developed his model during a post-doctoral stay at Rutherford&rsquo;s laboratory
</p>
<p>(Manchester, UK). He was appointed professor of physics at the University of
</p>
<p>Copenhagen in 1916 and the Universitetets Institut for Teoretisk Fysik (today, Niels
</p>
<p>Bohr Institutet) was inaugurated in 1921. Unlike Einstein and Dirac, Bohr seldom
</p>
<p>worked alone. His first collaborator was Hendrik Kramers (Netherlands), followed
</p>
<p>by Oscar Klein (Sweden). During the 1920s, there were 63 visitors to the Institute
</p>
<p>who stayed more than one month, including 10 Nobel Laureates. The flow of foreign</p>

<p>264 15 A Brief History of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>visitors lasted throughout Bohr&rsquo;s life: he became both an inspiration and a father
</p>
<p>figure.
</p>
<p>Arnold Sommerfeld established an important school in Munich. In 1914, it was
</p>
<p>found that every line predicted by the Balmer formula is a narrowly split set of lines.
</p>
<p>By taking into account the influence of relativity theory, Sommerfeld showed that
</p>
<p>the orbits of the electrons are approximate ellipses displaying a parhelion precession
</p>
<p>[116]. Sommerfeld&rsquo;s work was also one of the first attempts to unite the quantum
</p>
<p>and relativity theories, a synthesis still not completely achieved.
</p>
<p>In Göttingen, Born did not turn his attention to atomic theory until around 1921.
</p>
<p>Heisenberg and Jordan were his assistants.
</p>
<p>In 1924 Pauli had published 15 papers on topics ranging from relativity to the old
</p>
<p>quantum theory, the first one before entering the University of Munich. In 1922, he
</p>
<p>went for a year to Copenhagen. Later he held a position at Hamburg. He made the
</p>
<p>assumption of two-valuedness for electrons and stated the exclusion principle [42]
</p>
<p>(Sect. 7.1) so important for understanding the properties of atoms, metals, nuclei,
</p>
<p>baryons, etc.
</p>
<p>The crucial experimental results of Stern and Gerlach were known in 1921
</p>
<p>[17]. A proposal concerning spin was made4 by two Dutch students from the
</p>
<p>University of Leiden, Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit, who also suggested the existence
</p>
<p>of ms D ˙1=2 as a fourth quantum number [35] (Sect. 5.2.2). They explained
the anomalous Zeeman effect by including the factor of two appearing in (5.22),
</p>
<p>which was accounted for in [117]. After receiving objections from Henrik Lorentz,
</p>
<p>Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit considered withdrawing their paper, but it was too late.
</p>
<p>(Their advisor, Paul Ehrenfest, also argued that the authors were young enough to
</p>
<p>be able to afford some stupidity.) The two-component spin formalism (5.20) was
</p>
<p>introduced by Pauli in 1927 [36].
</p>
<p>Dirac, and independently Enrico Fermi, developed quantum statistics for anti-
</p>
<p>symmetric wave functions [56, 57].
</p>
<p>However, until 1925, there were almost as many setbacks as successes in the
</p>
<p>application of the model. For instance, the spectrum of He proved to be intractable,
</p>
<p>in spite of heroic efforts by Kramers, Heisenberg and others. The final blow was the
</p>
<p>negative result of the BKS proposal (Sect 15.5.2).
</p>
<p>4The combination of the Pauli principle and of spinning electrons prompted Ralph Kronig to
</p>
<p>propose the idea of half-integer spin. However, he was dissuaded from publishing it by Pauli and
</p>
<p>others, on the grounds that models for electrons carrying an intrinsic angular momentum &bdquo;=2
either required the periphery of the electron to rotate with a velocity much larger than the velocity
</p>
<p>of light c, or the electron radius to be much larger than the classical value.</p>

</p>
<p>15.4 Quantum Mechanics (1925 � t � 1928)
</p>
<p>Periodically, Bohr used to gather his former assistants together at the Institute in
</p>
<p>Copenhagen (Fig. 15.1). In 1925, the ongoing crisis in quantum mechanics was
</p>
<p>examined by Bohr, Kramers, Heisenberg and Pauli. A few months later, back at
</p>
<p>Göttingen, Heisenberg found a way out of the impasse [9]. He succeeded in formu-
</p>
<p>lating the theory in terms of observable quantities, doing away with the concepts of
</p>
<p>orbits and trajectories (see Sect. 2.1). Heisenberg found a correspondence between
</p>
<p>the coordinate x.t/ and the double array xnm (n;m labeling quantum states). xnm.t/
</p>
<p>was interpreted as a sort of transition coordinate, and hence an allowed observable.
</p>
<p>To represent x2.t/, he made the crucial assumption that .x2/nm D
P
</p>
<p>p xnpxpm.
</p>
<p>Heisenberg solved the simple but non-trivial problem of the harmonic oscillator by
</p>
<p>showing that the Hamiltonian is given by Hmn D Enınm, where the En reproduce
the correct eigenvalues (Sect. 3.3).
</p>
<p>Born and Jordan realized that the arrays (xnm) were matrices and arrived at the
</p>
<p>fundamental commutation relation (2.15) in its matrix form (3.45) [118]. Born,
</p>
<p>Heisenberg and Jordan wrote a comprehensive text on quantum mechanics, which
</p>
<p>included unitary transformations, perturbation theory, the treatment of degenerate
</p>
<p>systems and commutation relations for the angular momentum operators [10].
</p>
<p>Many of these results were also obtained by Dirac [11], who introduced the
</p>
<p>idea that physical quantities are represented by operators (of which Heisenberg&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>matrices are just one representation), the description of physical states by vectors
</p>
<p>in abstract Hilbert spaces, and the connection between the commutator of two
</p>
<p>operators with the classical Poisson bracket.
</p>
<p>In 1926, Pauli and Dirac independently reproduced the results for the hydrogen
</p>
<p>atom of old quantum theory using the new matrix mechanics [39].

<p>266 15 A Brief History of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Zurich-based Schrödinger did not belong to the Copenhagen&ndash;Göttingen&ndash;Munich
</p>
<p>tradition. In 1925 he came across de Broglie&rsquo;s suggestion [32] that the wave&ndash;
</p>
<p>corpuscle duality should also be extended to material particles, satisfying the
</p>
<p>momentum&ndash;frequency relation (4.34). This relation is reproduced if the momentum
</p>
<p>and the energy are replaced by the differential operators (4.4) and (9.5) and if
</p>
<p>such operators act on the plane wave solutions (4.32) and (9.10). Upon making
</p>
<p>the same substitution in a general Hamiltonian, Schrödinger derived the time-
</p>
<p>independent and the time-dependent equations that bear his name [12]. Quantization
</p>
<p>was obtained through the requirement that the wave function should be single-
</p>
<p>valued (as in (5.32)). Schrödinger presented his derivation as a step towards a
</p>
<p>continuous theory, the integers (quantum numbers) originating in the same way as
</p>
<p>the number of nodes in a classical vibrating string. Schrödinger&rsquo;s formulation gained
</p>
<p>rapid acceptance, both because of the answers that it produced and because it was
</p>
<p>built from mathematical tools that were familiar to the theoretical physicists of the
</p>
<p>time. Schrödinger hoped that quantum mechanics would become another branch
</p>
<p>of classical physics: waves would be the only reality, particles being produced by
</p>
<p>means of wave packets. This expectation turned out to be wrong.
</p>
<p>In 1926, Schrödinger also proved that the matrix and the differential formulation
</p>
<p>are equivalent. Since physicists understood how to transcribe the language of
</p>
<p>wave mechanics into matrix mechanics, both of them were referred to as quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics.
</p>
<p>The probability interpretation of j&permil;.x; t/j2 is usually considered part of the
Copenhagen interpretation. However, Born was the first to write it explicitly [31].
</p>
<p>In his paper on collision theory, he also stated that jci j2 (2.6) was the probability
of finding the system in the state i . He emphasized that quantum mechanics does
</p>
<p>not answer the question: what is the state after a collision? Rather it tells us how
</p>
<p>probable a given effect of the collision is. Determinism in the atomic world was
</p>
<p>thereby explicitly abandoned.
</p>
<p>In 1926 Heisenberg was able to account for the He problem using the
</p>
<p>Schrödinger equation plus the Pauli principle plus spin (Sect. 8.3) [119].
</p>
<p>The relativistic generalization of the Schrödinger time-dependent, two-
</p>
<p>component spin formalism encountered some difficulties. In 1928, Dirac produced
</p>
<p>an equation, linear in both the coordinates and time derivatives, with the properties
</p>
<p>that:
</p>
<p>&bull; It is Lorentz invariant
</p>
<p>&bull; It satisfies a continuity equation (4.17) with positive density � (which previous
</p>
<p>attempts at relativistic generalization had failed to do)
</p>
<p>&bull; It encompasses spin from the start
</p>
<p>&bull; It reproduces the results of the Sommerfeld model for the H atom, which were
</p>

</p>
<p>The price that Dirac had to pay for this most beautiful product of twentieth century
</p>
<p>mathematical physics was that it turned out to be a four-component rather than a
</p>
<p>two-component theory. Its interpretation including the additional two components
</p>
<p>is beyond the scope of this exposition.</p>

<p>A few comments are in order:
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantum mechanics and its traditional interpretation were developed over only a
</p>
<p>few years (1925&ndash;1928). The rate of publication in this period was such that many
</p>
<p>physicists complained about the impossibility of keeping up to date. Moreover,
</p>
<p>communication delays certainly hampered the ability of non-European physicists
</p>
<p>to contribute.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantum mechanics was developed under a very unfavorable social context (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 15.1).
</p>
<p>&bull; Unlike previous scientific cornerstones, quantum mechanics was the result of the
</p>
<p>coherent effort of a group of people, mostly in Northern and Central Europe.
</p>
<p>Table 15.1 shows the number of papers written in each country during the period
</p>
<p>of major activity in the creation of quantum mechanics. It reflects both the
</p>
<p>predominance of Germany and the number of visitors, especially in the case
</p>
<p>of Denmark. It also reminds us that the scientific center of gravity was only
</p>
<p>transferred to the other side of the Atlantic after the Second World War (1939&ndash;
</p>
<p>1945).
</p>
<p>&bull; The Bohr Festspiele took place at Göttingen in 1922. After Bohr&rsquo;s speech, the
</p>
<p>20 year old Heisenberg stood up and raised objections to Bohr&rsquo;s calculations.
</p>
<p>During a walk in the mountains that same afternoon, Bohr invited Heisenberg
</p>
<p>to become his assistant in Copenhagen. This anecdote points out the extreme
</p>
<p>youth (and self-confidence) of most of the contributors to quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>In 1925 Dirac was 23 years old, Heisenberg was 24, Jordan 22, and Pauli 25.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;elders&rdquo; were Bohr (40), Born (43), and Schrödinger (38). Feynman (24)
</p>
<p>produced the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics being a graduate
</p>
<p>student at Priceton (Sect. 11.3&#142;).
</p>
<p>15.5 Philosophical Aspects
</p>
<p>15.5.1 Complementarity Principle
</p>
<p>Neither the Heisenberg nor the Schrödinger formulations improved the contem-
</p>
<p>porary understanding of wave-particle duality. In 1927, Heisenberg answered the
</p>
<p>question: can quantum mechanics represent the fact that an electron finds itself</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>268 15 A Brief History of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>approximately in a given place and that it moves approximately with a given
</p>
<p>velocity and can we make these approximations so close that they do not cause
</p>
<p>mathematical difficulties? [26]. The answer was given in terms of the uncertainty
</p>
<p>relations (2.37) and (9.35) (see the last paragraph of Sect. 2.6.1). Heisenberg&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>paper was the beginning of the discussion of the measurement problem in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics (Chap. 14), about which so many volumes have been written.
</p>
<p>As most theoretical physicists would have done, Heisenberg derived his uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty principle from the (matrix) formalism (Sect. 2.6.1). Bohr had the opposite
</p>
<p>attitude. While being duly impressed by the existence of at least two formulations
</p>
<p>predicting correct quantum results, he insisted on first understanding the conceptual
</p>
<p>implications, rather than the formalisms. His main tools consisted of words, which
</p>
<p>he struggled continually to define precisely. Bohr pointed out that theories &ndash; even
</p>
<p>quantum theories &ndash; were checked by readings from classical instruments. Therefore,
</p>
<p>all the evidence has to be expressed within classical language, in which the mutually
</p>
<p>exclusive terms &ldquo;particle&rdquo; and &ldquo;wave&rdquo; are well defined. Either picture may be
</p>
<p>applied in experimental situations, but the other is then inapplicable. The idea of
</p>
<p>complementarity is that a full understanding of this microscopic world comes only
</p>
<p>from the possibility of applying both pictures; neither is complete in itself. Both
</p>
<p>must be present, but when one is applied, the other is excluded.
</p>
<p>The complementary principle is not an independent principle of quantum physics
</p>
<p>but a series of conceptual statements interpreting the mathematical formalism.
</p>
<p>Bohr&rsquo;s ideas were stated at the Como Conference, September 1927. Bohr continued
</p>
<p>to reformulate the presentation of complementarity throughout the rest of his
</p>
<p>life [21].
</p>
<p>15.5.2 Discussions Between Bohr and Einstein
</p>
<p>Many histories of science display a sequence of continuous successes, thus ignoring
</p>
<p>the many frustrations accompanying creative processes. The discussions between
</p>
<p>Bohr and Einstein about problems of principle illustrate the difficulties inherent to
</p>
<p>changes in the description of the physical world, even in the case of our greatest
</p>
<p>forefathers.
</p>
<p>The first meeting between Bohr and Einstein took place in 1920, on the occasion
</p>
<p>of Bohr&rsquo;s visit to Berlin. Verification of general relativity through the bending of
</p>
<p>light had taken place shortly before. Thus Einstein was on the zenith, while Bohr
</p>
<p>was only a rising star. Although they interchanged affectionate compliments, the
</p>
<p>subject of their Berlin conversations remains unclear. Like many other physicists,
</p>
<p>at that time Bohr did not believe in light quanta, and this disbelief continued even
</p>
<p>after Compton&rsquo;s experiment (1923). In 1924 there appeared a paper signed by
</p>
<p>Bohr, Kramers and the American physicist John Slater with the following contents
</p>
<p>[121]:
</p>
<p>&bull; Since the simultaneous validity of the (continuous) wave theory of light, and
</p>
<p>the description of matter processes involving (discrete) energy transitions is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.5 Philosophical Aspects 269
</p>
<p>incompatible with conservation of energy in individual events, this principle is
</p>
<p>given up, as well as the conservation of momentum. They hold only statistically.
</p>
<p>&bull; Statistical independence of the processes of emission and absorption in distant
</p>
<p>atoms is also assumed.
</p>
<p>&bull; The mediation of virtual fields produced by virtual oscillators is proposed.
</p>
<p>However the paper describes neither formal mechanisms governing the behavior
</p>
<p>of these entities, nor their interaction with real fields. In fact, (15.6) is the only
</p>
<p>mathematical expression included in the paper.
</p>
<p>Born, Klein and Schrödinger reacted positively. Einstein and Pauli were against.
</p>
<p>However, two experiments on Compton scattering ended the BKS speculation dur-
</p>
<p>ing the following year. They concerned the time-interval between the electron recoil
</p>
<p>and the scattered photon, and momentum conservation in individual processes. The
</p>
<p>BKS proposal marked the end of old quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s initial appraisal of Heisenberg&rsquo;s and Schrödinger quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>appears to have been positive. However, the approval was withdrawn after Born&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>probabilistic interpretation. Einstein never accepted limitations to our knowledge
</p>
<p>arising from first principles of the theory.
</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics was discussed at the V Solvay Conference (1927) in
</p>
<p>Brussels, attended by all founders. Einstein expressed his concern over the extent
</p>
<p>to which the causal account in space and time had been abandoned in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. The discussions centered on whether a fuller description of phenomena
</p>
<p>could be obtained through the detailed balance of energy and momentum in
</p>
<p>individual processes. For instance, in the case of a beam of particles passing through
</p>
<p>a slit in a diaphragm, Einstein would suggest that the indetermination principle
</p>
<p>could be invalidated by measuring the momentum of the recoiling slit. During the
</p>
<p>evenings Bohr would explain how the inherent uncertainty in the location of the slit
</p>
<p>due to its recoil restored Heisenberg&rsquo;s principle. Bohr systematically emphasized
</p>
<p>the need to fully specify the measuring apparatus in any experiment. It was on this
</p>
<p>occasion that Einstein asked whether God had recourse to playing dice, to which
</p>
<p>Bohr replied by calling for great caution in ascribing attributes to Providence in
</p>
<p>everyday language.
</p>
<p>At the next Solvay meeting in 1930 (Fig. 15.2), Einstein claimed that a control of
</p>
<p>energy and time could be achieved using relativity theory. He proposed the device
</p>
<p>represented in Fig. 15.3, consisting of a box with a hole on a wall and a clock inside,
</p>
<p>such that a single photon might be released at a known moment. Moreover, it would
</p>
<p>be possible to measure the energy of the photon with any prescribed accuracy by
</p>
<p>weighing the box before and after the event, and make use of the relativity equation
</p>
<p>E D mc2. Bewilderment among quantum physicists lasted until the next day, when
Bohr came up with an answer based on general relativity: since the rate of the
</p>
<p>clock depends on its position in a gravitational field, the lack of precision in the
</p>
<p>box displacement generates an uncertainty &#129;t in the determination of time, while
</p>
<p>the indeterminacy in the energy &#129;E is obtained through the position&ndash;momentum
</p>
<p>relation (2.37). The product&#129;t&#129;E satisfies the Heisenberg time&ndash;energy uncertainty
</p>
<p>relation.</p>

</p>
<p>In 1935 Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen presented a profound argument pointing
</p>
<p>to the incompleteness of quantum mechanics [16]. They considered a system
</p>
<p>consisting of two entangled and spatially separated particles, which required the
</p>
<p>existence of a hidden mechanism to reproduce the quantum results (Sect. 12.3.2).
</p>
<p>An adaptation of their argument to the case of spin entanglement was produced by
</p>
<p>David Bohm [80].
</p>
<p>Bohr&rsquo;s reply was based on his concept of &ldquo;phenomenon&rdquo;: the two (mutually
</p>
<p>exclusive) experimental setups were not specified in the EPR definition of reality
</p>
<p>[122].</p>

<p>15.6 Recent Quantum Mechanics 271
</p>
<p>Probably the best description of Einstein&rsquo;s and Bohr&rsquo;s respective positions is
</p>
<p>stated in Bohr&rsquo;s presentation on the occasion of Einstein&rsquo;s 70th birthday [124] and
</p>
<p>in Einstein&rsquo;s answer in the same volume [123].
</p>
<p>15.6 Recent Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Rather than dwell on philosophical interpretations of equations, most physicists
</p>
<p>proceeded to carry out many exciting applications of quantum mechanics [125]:
</p>
<p>This approach proved stunningly successful. Quantum mechanics was instrumental in
</p>
<p>predicting antimatter, understanding radioactivity (leading to nuclear power), accounting
</p>
<p>for the behavior of materials such as semiconductors, explaining superconductivity, and
</p>
<p>describing interactions such as those between light and matter (leading to the invention of
</p>
<p>the laser) and of radio waves and nuclei (leading to magnetic resonance imaging). Many
</p>
<p>successes of quantum mechanics involve its extension, quantum field theory, which forms
</p>
<p>the foundations of elementary particle physics : : : .
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the controversy over the EPR experiment did not die down.
</p>
<p>Einstein believed that, although quantum predictions were correct, indeterminacies
</p>
<p>appeared because some parameters characterizing the systems were unmeasurable.
</p>
<p>Therefore, an ensemble of identically prepared systems, all of them represented
</p>
<p>by the same quantum state &permil;, would not represent a collection of identical
</p>
<p>systems. Quantum mechanics would only appear probabilistic because we cannot
</p>
<p>measure the values of the &ldquo;hidden variables.&rdquo; A more fundamental theory restoring
</p>
<p>determinism should bear to quantum mechanics a relation similar to the one existing
</p>
<p>between classical and statistical mechanics.
</p>
<p>There were also attempts to prove that no hidden variable theory could reproduce
</p>
<p>the statistical properties of quantum theory. In particular, von Neumann&rsquo;s classic
</p>
<p>book [101] contains a mathematical proof that quantum theory is incompatible with
</p>
<p>the existence of &ldquo;dispersion free ensembles&rdquo; (such that hjQ2ji D hjQji2, for any
observable Q). This precision would entail the existence of hidden variables.
</p>
<p>In 1964, Bell wrote two seminal papers. In the first one, he showed that there
</p>
<p>was a questionable assumption in von Neumann&rsquo;s proof. In fact, he explicitly
</p>
<p>constructed a deterministic non-local model, generating results whose averages
</p>
<p>were identical to the predictions of quantum theory [126]. The second paper was
</p>
<p>not about quantum mechanics, but develops the consequences of both the existence
</p>
<p>of hidden variables and of Einstein&rsquo;s locality [81]. He found that such systems5
</p>
<p>would induce correlations that could be measured. He also showed that quantum
</p>
<p>predictions violated such restrictions. Thus quantum theory and Einstein&rsquo;s locality
</p>
<p>could not both be right. From there on, the emphasis was shifted from hidden
</p>
<p>variables to locality. Non-locality became an important feature of this world.
</p>
<p>5One such systems is presented in Sect. 12.3.2.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>272 15 A Brief History of Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>Note that hidden variables are not ruled out, provided they are non-local.
</p>
<p>However, they have become a less attractive concept, since they were initially
</p>
<p>invoked to preserve locality.
</p>
<p>The quantum-classical boundary persisted for decades as an ill-defined con-
</p>
<p>cept, although it was essential for the Copenhagen interpretation of measure-
</p>
<p>ments. Moreover, quantum effects were observed beyond the microscopic domain
</p>
<p>[fullerenes (Sect. 2.5.2), Bose&ndash;Einstein condensation (Sect. 7.5&#142;), superconductivity
</p>
<p>(Sect. 10.1)].
</p>
<p>The notion of isolated systems, which originated in classical physics, was
</p>
<p>adopted in quantum mechanics without further scrutiny. Only recently was it
</p>
<p>realized that the openness of quantum systems (i.e. their interaction with the
</p>
<p>environment) is essential to explain how a quantum system becomes effectively
</p>
<p>classical. In Sect. 14.2&#142; it is described how the coupling to the environment
</p>
<p>defines the observable physical properties of the system. Quantum coherences
</p>
<p>are delocalized into the entangled system&ndash;environment system, which effectively
</p>
<p>removes them from our observation. This process is very fast and irreversible in
</p>
<p>practice. Thus, classical systems appear to emerge from the quantum substrate [98].
</p>
<p>Ironically, the locality of classical systems had been responsible for the idealization
</p>
<p>of the isolated-system concept.
</p>
<p>The first paper on what was later called &ldquo;decoherence&rdquo; was written in 1970 by
</p>
<p>H. Dieter Zeh [127], who observed that realistic macroscopic quantum systems are
</p>
<p>typically found in states that are correlated with the environment, inhibiting the
</p>
<p>description of the dynamics of the system itself by means of the quantum formalism.
</p>
<p>In 1981, Zurek developed the concept of environment-induced superselection
</p>
<p>[128]. He also showed how environment-induced superselection determines the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;pointer&rdquo; preferred states, and how it explains the fact that position is observed to be
</p>
<p>the usually preferred quantity in the everyday world. In 1984, Zurek derived a quite
</p>
<p>general expression from which typical decoherence timescales could be evaluated
</p>
<p>[129].
</p>
<p>Erich Joos and Zeh presented in 1985 a detailed model for decoherence induced
</p>
<p>by the scattering of environmental particles, including numerical timescales for
</p>
<p>objects of various sizes and immersed in different environments [130].
</p>
<p>Will quantum computing eventually become an accomplished instrument? As
</p>
<p>objects become larger and larger, they become more sensitive to external perturba-
</p>
<p>tions, which can destroy quantum superpositions. Nobody knows whether there is
</p>
<p>a hypothetical limit beyond which decoherence would be inevitable, or whether we
</p>
<p>always can, at least in principle, take sufficient precautions to protect the system
</p>
<p>against perturbations, no matter how large they are. Laboratory incident light is
</p>
<p>not even needed to produce decoherence. Thermal radiation, cosmic background
</p>
<p>radiation, gravity waves, etc., may be sufficient.</p>
