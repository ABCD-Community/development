<p>Evaluation form DOCBIBLAS Workshop,  
Moi University / Nairobi, October 2010 
</p>
<p> 
Dear participant, 
  
At the end of the DOCBIBLAS Workshop, and in view of its &lsquo;pilot&rsquo; character as a 
workshop for advanced ABCD-management, we need your feedback, probably even 
more than usual. 
Please answer the following series of questions without refraining from giving your 
opinion frankly. This  &lsquo;survey&rsquo; is anonymous but will serve us and VLIR/UOS, the 
organizers of the workshop, quite a lot and certainly upcoming workshops on the ABCD-
software will gain from it. 
Thank you, 
Egbert de Smet 
DOCBIBLAS Promoter for VLIR/UOS
