<p>Incorporating the new cataloguing rules of RDA into ABCD and
training the ABCD librarians in the use of RDA.
</p>
<p>Project Summary (Max. 5 lines)
Most large academic libraries are shifting from the MARC standard to the new RDA-standard (based on MARC but with added
features). The VLIR/UOS supported ABCD Integrated Library System needs urgently to incorporate this new standard to allow
the VLIR/UOS ABCD partner libraries to remain in touch with international reality. This project aims at developing the neces -
sary technical elements (worksheets, indexing, print-formats) and to organize a workshop in Latin-America and one in East-
Africa to give training on the new standard and demonstrating its use in ABCD.

<p>DETAILED INFORMATION
</p>
<p>1. Description of the project context (max. 3 pages)
</p>
<p>1.1. Background of the project
</p>
<p>Original idea and steps undertaken to elaborate the idea.
In 2013 a new international standard for cataloging rules was brought into practice by the main libraries, e.g. Library of
Congress and British National Library : RDA (Resource Description and Access).
This new standard incorporates elements of the &lsquo;FRBR&rsquo; model (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records), which
is a modernisation on the MARC-model which introduces more flexible retrieval based on a hierarchical model where intel -
lectual works have &lsquo;expressions&rsquo; (e.g. Formats and languages)  and &lsquo;manifestations&rsquo; (e.g. Edtions). In other words : modern
catalogues should be capable of showing all records related to a certain &lsquo;work&rsquo; regardless of their expression and manifest -
ations.
Since the ABCD-system, like all modern more advanced library systems, uses a protocol &lsquo;Z39.50&rdquo; for &lsquo;copy cataloging&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;shared cataloging&rsquo;), which means the complex bibliographic records in MARC-format can be freely copied from the cata-
logs of the main international libraries (e.g. LC), the incoming records nowadays are based on the RDA-rules and therefore
contain extra information. This extra information at this moment is not correctly dealt with in the catalogs : 
- the worksheets (with listings of fields) do not contain the new fields
- the indexing mechanism (FST) does not take into account the new possibilities of end-user retrieval based on the &lsquo;work&rsquo;-
level of a bibliographic record
- the display formats do not display the new information or give links to the alternative display formats (e.g. all works from
the same author).
This problem was discussed with participants of the ITP Lib@Web 2014 and VLIR/UOS December 2014 workshop parti-
cipants lead by Piet De Keyser and the need for an update of the ABCD system became very much articulated.
So, with the current ABCD-system, the cataloging is foregoing the new cataloging rules and the ABCD-based library systems
do not offer any longer internationally accepted bibliographic records.
The alternative solution of &lsquo;downgrading&rsquo; RDA to AACR2, while mostly possible from a technical point of view and practiced
in some cases (eg. The Flemish common or central catalog for public libraries), is not recommended to be sustained, as in-
formation is lost and new exciting features are omitted.
For this reason the project proposes to update the ABCD-system to incorporate the RDA-rules and FRBR-principles and pro -
mote its use by training the librarians in the VLIR/UOS network to use the new standard.
</p>
<p>The benefits for the VLIR/UOS partners are obvious : having at their disposal a library system which serves the newest in -
ternational cataloging standards, having trained librarians to use it.
For VLIR/UOS there is one additional benefit : as the initiative-taking initial funding body of the ABCD-system development,
this project will allow the ABCD system to keep its high esteem also academically as a modern, updated and fully capable
library system.
</p>
<p>History of the collaboration / antecedents
Antecedents &ndash; please indicate whether this project proposal is a continuation of an existing project, actions already under-
taken, or a project in finalisation phase. Describe that project in 10 lines. 
</p>
<p>The ABCD system was developed with VLIR/UOS support in the 'DOCBIBLAS' project during 2008-2012. The ABCD system
was approved by the VLIR/UOS ITS Experts group as an effort to streamline the support for library automation, avoiding ex-
pensive licenses and commercial provider dependencies. It is based on proven technology (ISIS databases, supported by
several UN branches, in the Virtual Health Library) along with specific Southern requirments : high self-reliance degree for
librarians, full Open Source and community support, academic bibliographic standards. The system was presented by an in-
ternational VLIR/UOS workshop in March 2009. Today about 12 VLIR/IUC partner institutions use the software in East-
Africa and Latin-America and in Cuba the whole ICT-network library-component is ABCD-based.
The ABCD system is an important training component also in the ITP 'Lib@Web' (Univ. Antwerpen) since 2012 and many
library-project missions for IUC-projects give training on ABCD. In 2015 UNESCO supports the development of a UNICODE
version of ABCD (Amharic version for Ethiopia) to promote its use in localized environments.

</p>
<p>General and national presentation of the sector / development problem treated in the project, as well as the
political lines (development problem related to the sector analysis)
In order to maintain internationally accepted academic catalogues in their libraries, the new RDA standard needs to be em-
braced and made understood/practiced.
</p>
<p>Analysis of the capacity constraints the partners are confronted with (academic problem)
Individual libraries lack the expertise to update their ILS (ABCD) to the new standard. Both the understanding of the new
rules and standard as the way how to incorporate this into their library system is insufficient.

Consistent with the Logical Framework Matrix (LFM) and the Indicative Operational Plan (IOP)
</p>
<p>Description of the project. (max 15 lines)
The project will :
1. develop the new RDA-standard technically into the ABCD system : the new RDA-fields, which come on top of the existing
MARC-fields, need to be defined and implemented into the MARC-standard and AACR-rules, creating a new model-data -
base with adapted RDA 'Field Definition Table'; these new fields need to be incorporated also in the indexing mechanism of
the ISIS-database tecnology (the Field Selection Table) and the Print Format Tables, allowing e.g. retrieval of 'related' biblio-
graphic entities (publications by same author, on same topic, other manifestations of same work etc.). All this needs to be
documented in the existing ABCD-documentation.
2. train the ABCD-librarians into the use of the new standard, by explaining its FRBR-philosophy and AACR cataloging rules
and showing how and where ABCD allows to take these fully into account. This training will be given in 2 separate work -
shops of one week, one in East-Africa and one in Latin-America.
</p>
<p>Describe the developmental relevance of the project.
Development work always needs to make sure the tools provided for development narrow the gap with the developments
in the Western world, not widen them. So also the library systems need to keep in touch with important innovations in the
cataloguing and bibliographical profession in the West. Better, updated catalogues facilitate better and more up-to-date re -
search and education in Higher Education.
</p>
<p>3. Assumptions, preconditions, sustainability (max. 1 page)
</p>
<p>Describe in detail the preconditions and external factors that can influence the realisation of the specific ob-
jectives and the results (feasibility).
Given the on-going development of the ABCD system as a community-driven FOSS, but observing the fact that its use in
university and academic libraries is mostly promoted by the VLIR/UOS support, the assumption is that ABCD remains being
further developed but with sufficient input also from academic environments.
</p>
<p>Describe the opportunities and challenges for the sustainability of benefits (capacity retention, continuation of
research activities, etc.) after VLIR-UOS funding (sustainability).
The ABCD system can only survive if it keeps in touch with international information science developments and standards.
As long as this is indeed the case, the ABCD libraries will need to maintain their systems and have their library staff trained
on these new skills and standards. VLIR/UOS always has focused on 'capacity building' and thus through many (but mostly

Regular 'regional' training events on ABCD will for sure raise the 'networking' in between ABCD-using university libraries.
Such libraries will also become better prepared to give services to their surrounding libraries (in public-, school- and re -
search libraries).
