</p>
<p>and external programme approval and review; 
 
&bull; Guiding and promoting curriculum development, especially in new departments 
</p>
<p>and new universities, and in other institutions of higher education; 
 
&bull; Evolving over time to take account of changes and innovations that reflect 
</p>
<p>subject development and new expectations; 
 
&bull; Providing an authoritative and widely recognized statement of expectations of 
</p>
<p>what is expected of a graduate in a specific (or designated) subject area in a 
form readily accessible to students, employers and others with a stake in higher 
education; 
</p>
<p> 
&bull; Providing a clear and transparent reference point for External Examiners; 
 
&bull; Assisting international comparison and competitiveness of higher education

</p>
<p> 
1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p> 
1.1  Subject Benchmark Statement &ndash; Scope and Purposes 
</p>
<p> 
&bull; Benchmarking of academic standard is an essential and integral 
</p>
<p>component of quality assurance in the university system. Subject 
benchmarking statement provides guidelines for the development of 
curricula, maintaining the highest standards of degree programmes 
and internal and external review of different study programmes 
offered within a particular subject field in a particular department of 
study. 
 
</p>
<p>&bull; They also represent general expectations about the standards for the 
award of the degree at a given level and indicate the attributes and 
capabilities of graduates possessing such qualifications. 
 
</p>
<p>&bull; Subject benchmark statement provides academic staff and institution 
with a framework for developing and specifying the intended learning 
outcomes of the programme and provide external reviewers a source 
of reference among others, for making judgment about the 
appropriateness of academic standards within the institution in pursuit 
of internal quality assurance. 
 
</p>
<p>&bull; It also provides professional and statutory bodies, potential 
employers, with academic standards and other performance standards 
expected of a graduate. 
 
</p>
<p>&bull; One of the most important aspects of benchmark statement is that it 
provides information to the general public at large about the standards 
of the higher education award.   
 
</p>
<p>&bull; Benchmark statement reflects the academic, social and economic 
aspects and implications of the subject in a given period of time. 
 
</p>
<p>&bull; Benchmark statement provides potential employers in public as well 
as private sector with academic and other performance standards of a 
quality graduate. 
 
</p>
<p>&bull; They will also  provide prospective students with a clear 
understanding of the academic and other performance levels they are 
going to achieve after the completion of a degree programme. </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p/>
<p>Subject Benchmark Statement &ndash; Library and Information Science  2&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&bull; This subject benchmark statement refers to the subject Library and 
Information Science (LIS) taught in the Social Science study stream 
of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the Bachelors degree level. 
 
</p>
<p>&bull; The subject benchmark statement for Library and Information 
Science has been undertaken as an activity of the Quality 
Assurance (QA) project of CVCD/UGC by a subject bench 
marking team. 
</p>
<p> 
1.2  Level of Teaching 
</p>
<p> 
At present, Library and Information Science is taught as a subject for the 
BA degree programme only in the University of Kelaniya. Library and 
Information Science is taught at two levels in this University,. i.e. a 3 year 
general degree programme which offer LIS as a subject and a 4 year 
special degree programme. The university offers postgraduate and 
diploma level courses as well. 
 
As an external degree program, B.A. (General) Degree course with LIS as 
a subject is also offered at the University of Kelaniya. 
 
Furthermore, Post-Graduate Degrees and Foundation level courses may 
be offered in some other universities as well as in the National Institute of 
Library and Information Sciences.  
</p>
<p> 
1.3  Nature and Extent of the Subject 
</p>
<p> 
1. Librarianship is that branch of knowledge which is dealing with the 
</p>
<p>recognition, collection, organization, preservation, evaluation and 
utilization of information objects in print, electronic or any other 
physical documentary form. Information science investigates the 
properties and behavior of information, the forces governing the flow 
of information, and the means of processing information for optimum 
use and accessibility and usability. These two are closely related 
disciplinary fields which together encompass the principles and 
practice of knowledge representation, organization and 
communication in society, articulated by the generation, 
dissemination, exploitation and evaluation of information. 
</p>
<p> 
2. With the Government&rsquo;s stated objective of making Sri Lanka the 
</p>
<p>knowledge hub of South Asia, the discipline of Library and 
Information Science assumes greater significance and relevanc, as it 
embodies the role of facilitating the flow of recorded information 
across the society.  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>Subject Benchmark Statement &ndash; Library and Information Science  3&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As the social institution primarility responsible for assimilating the 
domain of knowledge recorded as information objects in print, 
electronic and other physical means, the library system in the country 
could play a highly significant contribution in social, economic and 
cultural development. However, this objective has not fully realized 
yet due to the underdeveloped nature of libraries in the country, for 
which one of the major reasons being the inadequacy of properly 
trained man power. As such, LIS education at all applicable levels 
assumes greater significance.   
</p>
<p> 
3. Degree programmes in the subject field of Library and Information 
</p>
<p>Science are designed to provide a fundamental education to prepare 
students for professional posts in library, information, knowledge, or 
archives management and cognate fields. The broad aim of these 
programmes is to equip students with a range of knowledge, 
understanding and skills at a level that will enable them to take 
advantage of career opportunities in a variety of jobs broadly 
concerned with the management of information. It is also aimed at 
giving them an exposure to the historical and theoretical context of 
the subjects covered. 
</p>
<p> 
4. LIS education embodies a combination of theory and practice. From a 
</p>
<p>theoretical perspective it deals with the generation and organization 
of knowlege including the aspects of classification, cataloguing and 
indexing, the broader concept of management and its branches as 
appplied to librarianship etc. From a practical perspective, it deals 
with the operations carried out in developing and maintaining library 
information services and products. Acquisition and provision of 
access to individual information objects, representation and recovery 
of their semantic content  and properties through the means of 
classification, cataloguing, indexing,  abstracting and structural 
tagging and digitization are some of such operations. It also includes 
the facilitation of physical and logical order of such objects 
complemented by curatorial functions embodied in librarianship, 
archives administration and records management, including selection, 
acquisition, disposal, storage, display, presertvation and conservation. 
</p>
<p> 
 
5. Apart from the organization and  provision of information objects, the 
</p>
<p>modern information service includes the promotion of information 
literacy, practice of librarianship within an ethical and legal 
framework and  compliance to standards and codes of practice of the 
relevant professional bodies. 
</p>
<p> 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>Subject Benchmark Statement &ndash; Library and Information Science  4&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>6. The benchmark statement in Library and Information Science must 
also take into account the scope and prospects of employability of its 
graduates.  In order to enhance the career prospects of LIS graduates 
it is essential to provide them with sufficient practical exposure. This 
could be achieved through a mix of practical components embedded 
in the curricula supplemented by mandatory in-service training at 
recognised libraries and information centres etc. As intermediaries 
handling the flow of information across the society, LIS professionals 
are required to possess multi-lingual skills with the desirable fluency 
in Sinhala/Tamil and English languages. Therefore, course work 
should incorporate learning and evaluating strategies to make sure 
that the learners are provided with sufficient opportunities to enhance 
their linguistic and presentation skills. Similarly, LIS graduates 
should be harnessed with the skills to understand the formation of 
knowledge, disciplines and subjects including traditional/indigenous 
knowledge. 
</p>
<p> 
7. With the rapid developments taking place in information and 
</p>
<p>communication technologies, the nature and functions of LIS 
profession are also in a stage of transition thereby making it essential 
for them to develop competencies in ICT. As such, LIS courses 
should contain sufficient ICT components with emphasis on 
information management. 
</p>
<p> 
8. LIS graduates are expected to choose their career paths in different 
</p>
<p>types of operating environments such as academic, special and public 
library service or specialized information management / brokerage 
situations etc. Therefore, it is required to provide a flexible course 
structure to ensure the delivery of knowledge and skills at an 
optimum level of resource utilization enabling graduates to offer their 
services with strong self confidence. This could be achieved through 
the provision of mandatory and optional course unit system embodied 
with sufficient in-service training. 
</p>
<p>

&nbsp;
</p>
<p>5. TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES 
 
A diversity of teaching, learning and assessment strategies must be employed to 
realize the main objectives of the programme of study. 
 
The students graduating from the course of study should be competent in a range of 
knowledge and skills relevant to the major areas of Library and Information 
Science. 
  
The teaching learning methodology should be designed to encourage the 
progressive acquisition of subject knowledge and skills through conventional means 
as well as  through independent and self directed study. 
 
 
A balanced selection of the following teaching and learning methods can be used: 
</p>
<p>&bull; Courses designed to impart both theoretical and practical knowledge  
</p>
<p>&bull; Conventional teaching methods and the use of audio-visuals and multimedia  
</p>
<p>&bull; Seminars, workshops, tutorials  
</p>
<p>&bull; Assignments / individual and group projects / problem based learning  
</p>
<p>&bull; Practical work, library visits and field trips, library training and professional 
placement, and internship  
</p>
<p>&bull; Directed reading within the specialist literature  
</p>
<p>&bull; Role play  
</p>
<p>&bull; Virtual and mobile learning platforms  
</p>
<p>&bull; Research work, dissertation and publications 
 
Lectures convey subject knowledge, provide core themes and explanation of 
difficult concepts and make way for students to work independently. Lectures 
should encourage and enable students to develop skills in listening and 
comprehension, selective note taking, to appreciate how information is structured 
and presented. 
 
Practical work including library training should form a substantial part of the 
programme since LIS is mostly a practical and professional subject. Practical work 
should be designed to provide opportunities for acquisition of subject specific 
technical and transferable skills as well as generic skills needed to succeed in 
career, re-enforcing what is taught in the curriculum. The overall objective should 
be to develop competencies required in their chosen field with relevant hands-on 
experience. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>Subject Benchmark Statement &ndash; Library and Information Science  10&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Seminars, workshops, tutorials and oral presentations provide opportunities for 
interactive learning and allow students to explore the current development of the 
subject in depth. They also provide opportunities for development of interpersonal 
skills such as retrieval of information, problem solving, communication and team 
working. 
 
A significant proportion of student study time should be set for independent study, 
assignments and self directed study, individually or within groups. This will give 
them training in locating, selecting, evaluating, synthesizing, comprehending, using 
and presenting information available in all forms and formats.  
 
In-service training / internship / professional placement play a vital role for students 
in Library and Information Science and enable them to acquire a variety of skills 
needed for their personal and career development. 
 
 
6. ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES 
</p>
<p> 
A variety of assessment technique may be employed to test subject knowledge and 
skills acquisition. They also provide valuable information to the general public and 
employers about the performances and quality of the graduates. 
  
Assessment method should be designed to test the learning outcomes of the 
subject/courses and may include some or all of the following modes; 
&bull; Close book examination 
&bull; Practical examination 
&bull; Compilation of bibliographies, indexes, abstracts, databases etc 
&bull; Project reports 
&bull; Field work reports 
&bull; Work experience reports/ internship reports/ professional placement reports 
&bull; House tests (mid- term quick tests) 
&bull; Viva&ndash;voce examination 
A combination of continuous assessment and end course assessment may be 
employed. 
 
 
7. MAINTAINING STANDARDS 
 
It is anticipated that programme designers monitor the progress of the programme 
and student performance, to achieve the goals set for standards of achievements, by 
taking following measures. 
&bull; Involvement of external examiners/ peer reviewers 
&bull; Periodic subject review 
&bull; Interaction between departmental resource persons and professional bodies and
