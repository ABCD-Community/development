<p>Preface by Scott Chacon
Welcome to the second edition of Pro Git. The first edition was published over four years ago now.
Since then a lot has changed and yet many important things have not. While most of the core
commands and concepts are still valid today as the Git core team is pretty fantastic at keeping
things backward compatible, there have been some significant additions and changes in the
community surrounding Git. The second edition of this book is meant to address those changes and
update the book so it can be more helpful to the new user.
<p>When I wrote the first edition, Git was still a relatively difficult to use and barely adopted tool for
the harder core hacker. It was starting to gain steam in certain communities, but had not reached
anywhere near the ubiquity it has today. Since then, nearly every open source community has
adopted it. Git has made incredible progress on Windows, in the explosion of graphical user
interfaces to it for all platforms, in IDE support and in business use. The Pro Git of four years ago
knows about none of that. One of the main aims of this new edition is to touch on all of those new
frontiers in the Git community.
<p>The Open Source community using Git has also exploded. When I originally sat down to write the
book nearly five years ago (it took me a while to get the first version out), I had just started working
at a very little known company developing a Git hosting website called GitHub. At the time of
publishing there were maybe a few thousand people using the site and just four of us working on it.
As I write this introduction, GitHub is announcing our 10 millionth hosted project, with nearly 5
million registered developer accounts and over 230 employees. Love it or hate it, GitHub has
heavily changed large swaths of the Open Source community in a way that was barely conceivable
when I sat down to write the first edition.
<p>I wrote a small section in the original version of Pro Git about GitHub as an example of hosted Git
which I was never very comfortable with. I didn&rsquo;t much like that I was writing what I felt was
essentially a community resource and also talking about my company in it. While I still don&rsquo;t love
that conflict of interests, the importance of GitHub in the Git community is unavoidable. Instead of
an example of Git hosting, I have decided to turn that part of the book into more deeply describing
what GitHub is and how to effectively use it. If you are going to learn how to use Git then knowing
how to use GitHub will help you take part in a huge community, which is valuable no matter which
Git host you decide to use for your own code.
<p>The other large change in the time since the last publishing has been the development and rise of
the HTTP protocol for Git network transactions. Most of the examples in the book have been
changed to HTTP from SSH because it&rsquo;s so much simpler.
<p>It&rsquo;s been amazing to watch Git grow over the past few years from a relatively obscure version
control system to basically dominating commercial and open source version control. I&rsquo;m happy that
Pro Git has done so well and has also been able to be one of the few technical books on the market
that is both quite successful and fully open source.
<p>I hope you enjoy this updated edition of Pro Git.

<p>Preface by Ben Straub
The first edition of this book is what got me hooked on Git. This was my introduction to a style of
making software that felt more natural than anything I had seen before. I had been a developer for
several years by then, but this was the right turn that sent me down a much more interesting path
than the one I was on.
<p>Now, years later, I&rsquo;m a contributor to a major Git implementation, I&rsquo;ve worked for the largest Git
hosting company, and I&rsquo;ve traveled the world teaching people about Git. When Scott asked if I&rsquo;d be
interested in working on the second edition, I didn&rsquo;t even have to think.
<p>It&rsquo;s been a great pleasure and privilege to work on this book. I hope it helps you as much as it did
me.

<p>Introduction
You&rsquo;re about to spend several hours of your life reading about Git. Let&rsquo;s take a minute to explain
what we have in store for you. Here is a quick summary of the ten chapters and three appendices of
this book.
<p>In Chapter 1, we&rsquo;re going to cover Version Control Systems (VCSs) and Git basics&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;no technical
stuff, just what Git is, why it came about in a land full of VCSs, what sets it apart, and why so many
people are using it. Then, we&rsquo;ll explain how to download Git and set it up for the first time if you
don&rsquo;t already have it on your system.
<p>In Chapter 2, we will go over basic Git usage&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;how to use Git in the 80% of cases you&rsquo;ll encounter
most often. After reading this chapter, you should be able to clone a repository, see what has
happened in the history of the project, modify files, and contribute changes. If the book
spontaneously combusts at this point, you should already be pretty useful wielding Git in the time it
takes you to go pick up another copy.
<p>Chapter 3 is about the branching model in Git, often described as Git&rsquo;s killer feature. Here you&rsquo;ll
learn what truly sets Git apart from the pack. When you&rsquo;re done, you may feel the need to spend a
quiet moment pondering how you lived before Git branching was part of your life.
<p>Chapter 4 will cover Git on the server. This chapter is for those of you who want to set up Git inside
your organization or on your own personal server for collaboration. We will also explore various
hosted options if you prefer to let someone else handle that for you.
<p>Chapter 5 will go over in full detail various distributed workflows and how to accomplish them
with Git. When you are done with this chapter, you should be able to work expertly with multiple
remote repositories, use Git over email and deftly juggle numerous remote branches and
contributed patches.
<p>Chapter 6 covers the GitHub hosting service and tooling in depth. We cover signing up for and
managing an account, creating and using Git repositories, common workflows to contribute to
projects and to accept contributions to yours, GitHub&rsquo;s programmatic interface and lots of little tips
to make your life easier in general.
<p>Chapter 7 is about advanced Git commands. Here you will learn about topics like mastering the
scary reset command, using binary search to identify bugs, editing history, revision selection in
detail, and a lot more. This chapter will round out your knowledge of Git so that you are truly a
master.
<p>Chapter 8 is about configuring your custom Git environment. This includes setting up hook scripts
to enforce or encourage customized policies and using environment configuration settings so you
can work the way you want to. We will also cover building your own set of scripts to enforce a
custom committing policy.
<p>Chapter 9 deals with Git and other VCSs. This includes using Git in a Subversion (SVN) world and
converting projects from other VCSs to Git. A lot of organizations still use SVN and are not about to
change, but by this point you&rsquo;ll have learned the incredible power of Git&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and this chapter shows
you how to cope if you still have to use a SVN server. We also cover how to import projects from
<p>7</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>several different systems in case you do convince everyone to make the plunge.
<p>Chapter 10 delves into the murky yet beautiful depths of Git internals. Now that you know all
about Git and can wield it with power and grace, you can move on to discuss how Git stores its
objects, what the object model is, details of packfiles, server protocols, and more. Throughout the
book, we will refer to sections of this chapter in case you feel like diving deep at that point; but if
you are like us and want to dive into the technical details, you may want to read Chapter 10 first.
We leave that up to you.
<p>In Appendix A, we look at a number of examples of using Git in various specific environments. We
cover a number of different GUIs and IDE programming environments that you may want to use
Git in and what is available for you. If you&rsquo;re interested in an overview of using Git in your shell,
your IDE, or your text editor, take a look here.
<p>In Appendix B, we explore scripting and extending Git through tools like libgit2 and JGit. If you&rsquo;re
interested in writing complex and fast custom tools and need low-level Git access, this is where you
can see what that landscape looks like.
<p>Finally, in Appendix C, we go through all the major Git commands one at a time and review where
in the book we covered them and what we did with them. If you want to know where in the book
we used any specific Git command you can look that up here.
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started.
<p>8</p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Getting Started
This chapter will be about getting started with Git. We will begin by explaining some background
on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to
get it set up to start working with. At the end of this chapter you should understand why Git is
around, why you should use it and you should be all set up to do so.
<p>About Version Control
What is &ldquo;version control&rdquo;, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records
changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the
examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled,
though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
<p>If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which
you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It
allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a
previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing
a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if
you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little
overhead.
<p>Local Version Control Systems
<p>Many people&rsquo;s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a
time-stamped directory, if they&rsquo;re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but
it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you&rsquo;re in and accidentally write
to the wrong file or copy over files you don&rsquo;t mean to.
<p>To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that
kept all the changes to files under revision control.
<p>9</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 1. Local version control.
<p>One of the most popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still distributed with many
computers today. RCS works by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a special
format on disk; it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all
the patches.
<p>Centralized Version Control Systems
<p>The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on
other systems. To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were
developed. These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains
all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For
many years, this has been the standard for version control.
<p>10</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">

</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 2. Centralized version control.
<p>This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone knows to a
certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators have fine-grained control
over who can do what, and it&rsquo;s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases
on every client.
<p>However, this setup also has some serious downsides. The most obvious is the single point of failure
that the centralized server represents. If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour
nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they&rsquo;re working on. If the hard
disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven&rsquo;t been kept, you lose
absolutely everything&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people
happen to have on their local machines. Local VCS systems suffer from this same
problem&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing
everything.
<p>Distributed Version Control Systems
<p>This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial,
Bazaar or Darcs), clients don&rsquo;t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully
mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were
collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to
restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.
<p>11</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 3. Distributed version control.
<p>Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they
can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways
simultaneously within the same project. This allows you to set up several types of workflows that
aren&rsquo;t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.

<p>A Short History of Git
As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy.
<p>The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope. For most of the lifetime of
the Linux kernel maintenance (1991&ndash;2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches
and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called
BitKeeper.
<p>In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the
commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool&rsquo;s free-of-charge status
was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds,
the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while
using BitKeeper. Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:
<p>&bull; Speed
<p>&bull; Simple design
<p>&bull; Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
<p>&bull; Fully distributed
<p>&bull; Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)
<p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial
qualities. It&rsquo;s amazingly fast, it&rsquo;s very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible
branching system for non-linear development (See Git Branching).
<p>What is Git?
So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what
Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier
for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such
as CVS, Subversion or Perforce&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool.
Even though Git&rsquo;s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about
information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid
becoming confused while using it.
<p>Snapshots, Not Differences
<p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way
Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based
changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the
information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time (this is
commonly described as delta-based version control).
<p>13</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 4. Storing data as changes to a base version of each file.
<p>Git doesn&rsquo;t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of
snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your
project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a
reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn&rsquo;t store the file again,
just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a
stream of snapshots.
<p>Figure 5. Storing data as snapshots of the project over time.
<p>This is an important distinction between Git and nearly all other VCSs. It makes Git reconsider
almost every aspect of version control that most other systems copied from the previous
generation. This makes Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on
top of it, rather than simply a VCS. We&rsquo;ll explore some of the benefits you gain by thinking of your
data this way when we cover Git branching in Git Branching.
<p>Nearly Every Operation Is Local
<p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;generally no information is
needed from another computer on your network. If you&rsquo;re used to a CVCS where most operations
have that network latency overhead, this aspect of Git will make you think that the gods of speed
have blessed Git with unworldly powers. Because you have the entire history of the project right
there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.
<p>14</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>For example, to browse the history of the project, Git doesn&rsquo;t need to go out to the server to get the
history and display it for you&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it simply reads it directly from your local database. This means you
see the project history almost instantly. If you want to see the changes introduced between the
current version of a file and the file a month ago, Git can look up the file a month ago and do a local
difference calculation, instead of having to either ask a remote server to do it or pull an older
version of the file from the remote server to do it locally.
<p>This also means that there is very little you can&rsquo;t do if you&rsquo;re offline or off VPN. If you get on an
airplane or a train and want to do a little work, you can commit happily (to your local copy,
remember?) until you get to a network connection to upload. If you go home and can&rsquo;t get your VPN
client working properly, you can still work. In many other systems, doing so is either impossible or
painful. In Perforce, for example, you can&rsquo;t do much when you aren&rsquo;t connected to the server; in
Subversion and CVS, you can edit files, but you can&rsquo;t commit changes to your database (because
your database is offline). This may not seem like a huge deal, but you may be surprised what a big
difference it can make.
<p>Git Has Integrity
<p>Everything in Git is checksummed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This
means it&rsquo;s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.
This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You can&rsquo;t lose
information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.
<p>The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a SHA-1 hash. This is a 40-character
string composed of hexadecimal characters (0&ndash;9 and a&ndash;f) and calculated based on the contents of a
file or directory structure in Git. A SHA-1 hash looks something like this:
<p>24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373
<p>You will see these hash values all over the place in Git because it uses them so much. In fact, Git
stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash value of its contents.
<p>Git Generally Only Adds Data
<p>When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to get the
system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you
can lose or mess up changes you haven&rsquo;t committed yet, but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it
is very difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository.
<p>This makes using Git a joy because we know we can experiment without the danger of severely
screwing things up. For a more in-depth look at how Git stores its data and how you can recover
data that seems lost, see Undoing Things.
<p>The Three States
<p>Pay attention now&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;here is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your
learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified,
staged, and committed:
<p>15</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>&bull; Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
<p>&bull; Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next
commit snapshot.
<p>&bull; Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.
<p>This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the working tree, the staging area, and the
Git directory.
<p>Figure 6. Working tree, staging area, and Git directory.
<p>The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the
compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
<p>The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about
what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the &ldquo;index&rdquo;, but the phrase
&ldquo;staging area&rdquo; works just as well.
<p>The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the
most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another
computer.
<p>The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
<p>1. You modify files in your working tree.
<p>2. You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds
only those changes to the staging area.
<p>3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot
permanently to your Git directory.
<p>If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it&rsquo;s considered committed. If it has been
<p>16</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it was checked
out but has not been staged, it is modified. In Git Basics, you&rsquo;ll learn more about these states and
how you can either take advantage of them or skip the staged part entirely.
<p>The Command Line
There are a lot of different ways to use Git. There are the original command-line tools, and there
are many graphical user interfaces of varying capabilities. For this book, we will be using Git on the
command line. For one, the command line is the only place you can run all Git commands&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;most
of the GUIs implement only a partial subset of Git functionality for simplicity. If you know how to
run the command-line version, you can probably also figure out how to run the GUI version, while
the opposite is not necessarily true. Also, while your choice of graphical client is a matter of
personal taste, all users will have the command-line tools installed and available.
<p>So we will expect you to know how to open Terminal in macOS or Command Prompt or PowerShell
in Windows. If you don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking about here, you may need to stop and research
that quickly so that you can follow the rest of the examples and descriptions in this book.
<p>Installing Git
Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer. Even if it&rsquo;s already
installed, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to update to the latest version. You can either install it as a
package or via another installer, or download the source code and compile it yourself.
<p>
<p>This book was written using Git version 2.8.0. Though most of the commands we
use should work even in ancient versions of Git, some of them might not or might
act slightly differently if you&rsquo;re using an older version. Since Git is quite excellent
at preserving backwards compatibility, any version after 2.8 should work just fine.
<p>Installing on Linux
<p>If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so
through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If you&rsquo;re on Fedora (or
any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:
<p>$ sudo dnf install git-all
<p>If you&rsquo;re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try apt:
<p>$ sudo apt install git-all
<p>For more options, there are instructions for installing on several different Unix distributions on the
Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/linux.

</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Installing on macOS
<p>There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command
Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the
Terminal the very first time.
<p>$ git --version
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.
<p>If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git
installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/
download/mac.
<p>Figure 7. Git macOS Installer.
<p>You can also install it as part of the GitHub for macOS install. Their GUI Git tool has an option to
install command line tools as well. You can download that tool from the GitHub for macOS website,
at https://desktop.github.com.
<p>Installing on Windows
<p>There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for
download on the Git website. Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will
start automatically. Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git

<p>itself; for more information on it, go to https://gitforwindows.org.
<p>To get an automated installation you can use the Git Chocolatey package. Note that the Chocolatey
package is community maintained.
<p>Another easy way to get Git installed is by installing GitHub Desktop. The installer includes a
command line version of Git as well as the GUI. It also works well with PowerShell, and sets up
solid credential caching and sane CRLF settings. We&rsquo;ll learn more about those things a little later,
but suffice it to say they&rsquo;re things you want. You can download this from the GitHub Desktop
website.
<p>Installing from Source
<p>Some people may instead find it useful to install Git from source, because you&rsquo;ll get the most recent
version. The binary installers tend to be a bit behind, though as Git has matured in recent years,
this has made less of a difference.
<p>If you do want to install Git from source, you need to have the following libraries that Git depends
on: autotools, curl, zlib, openssl, expat, and libiconv. For example, if you&rsquo;re on a system that has dnf
(such as Fedora) or apt-get (such as a Debian-based system), you can use one of these commands to
install the minimal dependencies for compiling and installing the Git binaries:
<p>$ sudo dnf install dh-autoreconf curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
&nbsp; openssl-devel perl-devel zlib-devel
$ sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev \
&nbsp; gettext libz-dev libssl-dev
<p>In order to be able to add the documentation in various formats (doc, html, info), these additional
dependencies are required:
<p>$ sudo dnf install asciidoc xmlto docbook2X
$ sudo apt-get install asciidoc xmlto docbook2x
<p>
Users of RHEL and RHEL-derivatives like CentOS and Scientific Linux will have to
enable the EPEL repository to download the docbook2X package.
<p>If you&rsquo;re using a Debian-based distribution (Debian/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-derivatives), you also need the
install-info package:
<p>$ sudo apt-get install install-info
<p>If you&rsquo;re using a RPM-based distribution (Fedora/RHEL/RHEL-derivatives), you also need the getopt
package (which is already installed on a Debian-based distro):
<p>$ sudo dnf install getopt
<p>19</p>

<br>
<p>Additionally, if you&rsquo;re using Fedora/RHEL/RHEL-derivatives, you need to do this
<p>$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/db2x_docbook2texi /usr/bin/docbook2x-texi
<p>due to binary name differences.
<p>When you have all the necessary dependencies, you can go ahead and grab the latest tagged release
tarball from several places. You can get it via the kernel.org site, at https://www.kernel.org/pub/
software/scm/git, or the mirror on the GitHub website, at https://github.com/git/git/releases. It&rsquo;s
generally a little clearer what the latest version is on the GitHub page, but the kernel.org page also
has release signatures if you want to verify your download.
<p>Then, compile and install:
<p>$ tar -zxf git-2.8.0.tar.gz
$ cd git-2.8.0
$ make configure
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make all doc info
$ sudo make install install-doc install-html install-info
<p>After this is done, you can also get Git via Git itself for updates:
<p>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
<p>First-Time Git Setup
Now that you have Git on your system, you&rsquo;ll want to do a few things to customize your Git
environment. You should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they&rsquo;ll stick
around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the
commands again.
<p>Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control
all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different places:
<p>1. /etc/gitconfig file: Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their
repositories. If you pass the option --system to git config, it reads and writes from this file
specifically. (Because this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or
superuser privilege to make changes to it.)
<p>2. ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config file: Values specific personally to you, the user. You can
make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the --global option, and this affects
all of the repositories you work with on your system.
<p>3. config file in the Git directory (that is, .git/config) of whatever repository you&rsquo;re currently
using: Specific to that single repository. You can force Git to read from and write to this file with
the --local option, but that is in fact the default. (Unsurprisingly, you need to be located
<p>20</p>

<br>
<p>somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.)
<p>Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in
/etc/gitconfig.
<p>On Windows systems, Git looks for the .gitconfig file in the $HOME directory (C:\Users\$USER for
most people). It also still looks for /etc/gitconfig, although it&rsquo;s relative to the MSys root, which is
wherever you decide to install Git on your Windows system when you run the installer. If you are
using version 2.x or later of Git for Windows, there is also a system-level config file at C:\Documents
and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Git\config on Windows XP, and in
C:\ProgramData\Git\config on Windows Vista and newer. This config file can only be changed by git
config -f &lt;file&gt; as an admin.
<p>You can view all of your settings and where they are coming from using:
<p>$ git config --list --show-origin
<p>Your Identity
<p>The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This
is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it&rsquo;s immutably baked into the
commits you start creating:
<p>$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
<p>Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always
use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a
different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the
--global option when you&rsquo;re in that project.
<p>Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.
<p>Your Editor
<p>Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git
needs you to type in a message. If not configured, Git uses your system&rsquo;s default editor.
<p>If you want to use a different text editor, such as Emacs, you can do the following:
<p>$ git config --global core.editor emacs
<p>On a Windows system, if you want to use a different text editor, you must specify the full path to its
executable file. This can be different depending on how your editor is packaged.
<p>In the case of Notepad++, a popular programming editor, you are likely to want to use the 32-bit
version, since at the time of writing the 64-bit version doesn&rsquo;t support all plug-ins. If you are on a
<p>21</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>32-bit Windows system, or you have a 64-bit editor on a 64-bit system, you&rsquo;ll type something like
this:
<p>$ git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe'
-multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
<p>
<p>Vim, Emacs and Notepad++ are popular text editors often used by developers on
Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS or a Windows system. If you are using
another editor, or a 32-bit version, please find specific instructions for how to set
up your favorite editor with Git in git config core.editor commands.
<p>
You may find, if you don&rsquo;t setup your editor like this, you get into a really
confusing state when Git attempts to launch it. An example on a Windows system
may include a prematurely terminated Git operation during a Git initiated edit.
<p>Checking Your Settings
<p>If you want to check your configuration settings, you can use the git config --list command to list
all the settings Git can find at that point:
<p>$ git config --list
user.name=John Doe
user.email=johndoe@example.com
color.status=auto
color.branch=auto
color.interactive=auto
color.diff=auto
...
<p>You may see keys more than once, because Git reads the same key from different files
(/etc/gitconfig and ~/.gitconfig, for example). In this case, Git uses the last value for each unique
key it sees.
<p>You can also check what Git thinks a specific key&rsquo;s value is by typing git config &lt;key&gt;:
<p>$ git config user.name
John Doe
<p>22</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>
<p>Since Git might read the same configuration variable value from more than one
file, it&rsquo;s possible that you have an unexpected value for one of these values and
you don&rsquo;t know why. In cases like that, you can query Git as to the origin for that
value, and it will tell you which configuration file had the final say in setting that
value:
<p>$ git config --show-origin rerere.autoUpdate
file:/home/johndoe/.gitconfig false
<p>Getting Help
If you ever need help while using Git, there are three equivalent ways to get the comprehensive
manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:
<p>$ git help &lt;verb&gt;
$ git &lt;verb&gt; --help
$ man git-&lt;verb&gt;
<p>For example, you can get the manpage help for the git config command by running
<p>$ git help config
<p>These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline. If the manpages
and this book aren&rsquo;t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the #git or #github channel
on the Freenode IRC server, which can be found at https://freenode.net. These channels are
regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often
willing to help.
<p>In addition, if you don&rsquo;t need the full-blown manpage help, but just need a quick refresher on the
available options for a Git command, you can ask for the more concise &ldquo;help&rdquo; output with the -h
option, as in:

<p>Summary
You should have a basic understanding of what Git is and how it&rsquo;s different from any centralized
version control systems you may have been using previously. You should also now have a working
version of Git on your system that&rsquo;s set up with your personal identity. It&rsquo;s now time to learn some
Git basics.

<p>Git Basics
If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it. This chapter covers every basic
command you need to do the vast majority of the things you&rsquo;ll eventually spend your time doing
with Git. By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin
and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. We&rsquo;ll also show you how to set up Git to
ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the
history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote
repositories.
<p>Getting a Git Repository
You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:
<p>1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git
repository, or
<p>2. You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.
<p>In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.
<p>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory
<p>If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start
controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project&rsquo;s directory. If you&rsquo;ve never done this, it
looks a little different depending on which system you&rsquo;re running:
<p>for Linux:
<p>$ cd /home/user/my_project
<p>for macOS:
<p>$ cd /Users/user/my_project
<p>for Windows:
<p>$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project
<p>and type:
<p>$ git init
<p>This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a
Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. (See Git Internals for
<p>25</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>more information about exactly what files are contained in the .git directory you just created.)
<p>If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should
probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few
git add commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a git commit:
<p>$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'Initial project version'
<p>We&rsquo;ll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point, you have a Git repository
with tracked files and an initial commit.
<p>Cloning an Existing Repository
<p>If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;for example, a project you&rsquo;d like to
contribute to&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the command you need is git clone. If you&rsquo;re familiar with other VCS systems such
as Subversion, you&rsquo;ll notice that the command is "clone" and not "checkout". This is an important
distinction&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that
the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default
when you run git clone. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of
the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may
lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;see Getting Git
on a Server for more details).
<p>You clone a repository with git clone &lt;url&gt;. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable
library called libgit2, you can do so like this:
<p>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
<p>That creates a directory named libgit2, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data
for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new
libgit2 directory that was just created, you&rsquo;ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or
used.
<p>If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than libgit2, you can
specify the new directory name as an additional argument:
<p>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit
<p>That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called mylibgit.
<p>Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the
https:// protocol, but you may also see git:// or user@server:path/to/repo.git, which uses the SSH
transfer protocol. Getting Git on a Server will introduce all of the available options the server can
set up to access your Git repository and the pros and cons of each.

<br>
<p>Recording Changes to the Repository
At this point, you should have a bona fide Git repository on your local machine, and a checkout or
working copy of all of its files in front of you. Typically, you&rsquo;ll want to start making changes and
committing snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state
you want to record.
<p>Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or
untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified,
or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.
<p>Untracked files are everything else&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;any files in your working directory that were not in your last
snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be
tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven&rsquo;t edited anything.
<p>As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you&rsquo;ve changed them since your last commit.
As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes,
and the cycle repeats.
<p>Figure 8. The lifecycle of the status of your files.
<p>Checking the Status of Your Files
<p>The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the git status command. If you
run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:
<p>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
<p>This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are
modified. Git also doesn&rsquo;t see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the
command tells you which branch you&rsquo;re on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same
<p>27</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>branch on the server. For now, that branch is always master, which is the default; you won&rsquo;t worry
about it here. Git Branching will go over branches and references in detail.
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you add a new file to your project, a simple README file. If the file didn&rsquo;t exist before, and
you run git status, you see your untracked file like so:
<p>$ echo 'My Project' &gt; README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Untracked files:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
<p>&nbsp; README
<p>nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
<p>You can see that your new README file is untracked, because it&rsquo;s under the &ldquo;Untracked files&rdquo; heading
in your status output. Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn&rsquo;t have in the previous
snapshot (commit); Git won&rsquo;t start including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it
to do so. It does this so you don&rsquo;t accidentally begin including generated binary files or other files
that you did not mean to include. You do want to start including README, so let&rsquo;s start tracking the
file.
<p>Tracking New Files
<p>In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command git add. To begin tracking the README
file, you can run this:
<p>$ git add README
<p>If you run your status command again, you can see that your README file is now tracked and staged
to be committed:
<p>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; new file: README
<p>You can tell that it&rsquo;s staged because it&rsquo;s under the &ldquo;Changes to be committed&rdquo; heading. If you
commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran git add is what will be in the
subsequent historical snapshot. You may recall that when you ran git init earlier, you then ran git
add &lt;files&gt;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that was to begin tracking files in your directory. The git add command takes a path
<p>28</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>name for either a file or a directory; if it&rsquo;s a directory, the command adds all the files in that
directory recursively.
<p>Staging Modified Files
<p>Let&rsquo;s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called
CONTRIBUTING.md and then run your git status command again, you get something that looks like
this:
<p>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; new file: README
<p>Changes not staged for commit:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
&nbsp; (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
<p>&nbsp; modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
<p>The CONTRIBUTING.md file appears under a section named &ldquo;Changes not staged for commit&rdquo;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;which
means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To
stage it, you run the git add command. git add is a multipurpose command&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you use it to begin
tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as
resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as &ldquo;add precisely this content to the next commit&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;add this file to the project&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s run git add now to stage the CONTRIBUTING.md file, and
then run git status again:
<p>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; new file: README
&nbsp; modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
<p>Both files are staged and will go into your next commit. At this point, suppose you remember one
little change that you want to make in CONTRIBUTING.md before you commit it. You open it again and
make that change, and you&rsquo;re ready to commit. However, let&rsquo;s run git status one more time:
<p>29</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ vim CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; new file: README
&nbsp; modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
<p>Changes not staged for commit:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
&nbsp; (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
<p>&nbsp; modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
<p>What the heck? Now CONTRIBUTING.md is listed as both staged and unstaged. How is that possible? It
turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the git add command. If you commit
now, the version of CONTRIBUTING.md as it was when you last ran the git add command is how it will
go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working directory when you run
git commit. If you modify a file after you run git add, you have to run git add again to stage the
latest version of the file:
<p>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; new file: README
&nbsp; modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
<p>Short Status
<p>While the git status output is pretty comprehensive, it&rsquo;s also quite wordy. Git also has a short
status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way. If you run git status -s or git
status --short you get a far more simplified output from the command:
<p>$ git status -s
&nbsp;M README
MM Rakefile
A lib/git.rb
M lib/simplegit.rb
?? LICENSE.txt
<p>30</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>New files that aren&rsquo;t tracked have a ?? next to them, new files that have been added to the staging
area have an A, modified files have an M and so on. There are two columns to the output&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the left-
hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status
of the working tree. So for example in that output, the README file is modified in the working
directory but not yet staged, while the lib/simplegit.rb file is modified and staged. The Rakefile
was modified, staged and then modified again, so there are changes to it that are both staged and
unstaged.
<p>Ignoring Files
<p>Often, you&rsquo;ll have a class of files that you don&rsquo;t want Git to automatically add or even show you as
being untracked. These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files
produced by your build system. In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them
named .gitignore. Here is an example .gitignore file:
<p>$ cat .gitignore
*.[oa]
*~
<p>The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in &ldquo;.o&rdquo; or &ldquo;.a&rdquo;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;object and archive files that may be
the product of building your code. The second line tells Git to ignore all files whose names end with
a tilde (~), which is used by many text editors such as Emacs to mark temporary files. You may also
include a log, tmp, or pid directory; automatically generated documentation; and so on. Setting up a
.gitignore file for your new repository before you get going is generally a good idea so you don&rsquo;t
accidentally commit files that you really don&rsquo;t want in your Git repository.
<p>The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:
<p>&bull; Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
<p>&bull; Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working
tree.
<p>&bull; You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.
<p>&bull; You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
<p>&bull; You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).
<p>Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An asterisk (*) matches zero or
more characters; [abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question
mark (?) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen ([0-
9]) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use two asterisks to
match nested directories; a/**/z would match a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z, and so on.
<p>Here is another example .gitignore file:
<p>31</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p># ignore all .a files
*.a
<p># but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a
<p># only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO
<p># ignore all files in any directory named build
build/
<p># ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt
<p># ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf
<p>
GitHub maintains a fairly comprehensive list of good .gitignore file examples for
dozens of projects and languages at https://github.com/github/gitignore if you want
a starting point for your project.
<p>
<p>In the simple case, a repository might have a single .gitignore file in its root
directory, which applies recursively to the entire repository. However, it is also
possible to have additional .gitignore files in subdirectories. The rules in these
nested .gitignore files apply only to the files under the directory where they are
located. (The Linux kernel source repository has 206 .gitignore files.)
<p>It is beyond the scope of this book to get into the details of multiple .gitignore
files; see man gitignore for the details.
<p>Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes
<p>If the git status command is too vague for you&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you want to know exactly what you changed, not
just which files were changed&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can use the git diff command. We&rsquo;ll cover git diff in more
detail later, but you&rsquo;ll probably use it most often to answer these two questions: What have you
changed but not yet staged? And what have you staged that you are about to commit? Although git
status answers those questions very generally by listing the file names, git diff shows you the
exact lines added and removed&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the patch, as it were.
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you edit and stage the README file again and then edit the CONTRIBUTING.md file without
staging it. If you run your git status command, you once again see something like this:

<p>Git Diff in an External Tool
<p>We will continue to use the git diff command in various ways throughout the rest
of the book. There is another way to look at these diffs if you prefer a graphical or
external diff viewing program instead. If you run git difftool instead of git diff,
you can view any of these diffs in software like emerge, vimdiff and many more
(including commercial products). Run git difftool --tool-help to see what is
available on your system.
<p>Committing Your Changes
<p>Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. Remember
that anything that is still unstaged&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;any files you have created or modified that you haven&rsquo;t run
git add on since you edited them&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;won&rsquo;t go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on
your disk. In this case, let&rsquo;s say that the last time you ran git status, you saw that everything was
staged, so you&rsquo;re ready to commit your changes. The simplest way to commit is to type git commit:
<p>$ git commit
<p>Doing so launches your editor of choice.
<p>
This is set by your shell&rsquo;s EDITOR environment variable&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;usually vim or emacs,
although you can configure it with whatever you want using the git config
--global core.editor command as you saw in Getting Started.
<p>The editor displays the following text (this example is a Vim screen):
<p>35</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p># Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.

# Changes to be committed:
# new file: README
# modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
#

".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG" 9L, 283C
<p>You can see that the default commit message contains the latest output of the git status command
commented out and one empty line on top. You can remove these comments and type your commit
message, or you can leave them there to help you remember what you&rsquo;re committing.
<p>
For an even more explicit reminder of what you&rsquo;ve modified, you can pass the -v
option to git commit. Doing so also puts the diff of your change in the editor so you
can see exactly what changes you&rsquo;re committing.
<p>When you exit the editor, Git creates your commit with that commit message (with the comments
and diff stripped out).
<p>Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the commit command by specifying it
after a -m flag, like this:
<p>$ git commit -m "Story 182: fix benchmarks for speed"
[master 463dc4f] Story 182: fix benchmarks for speed
&nbsp;2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
&nbsp;create mode 100644 README
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve created your first commit! You can see that the commit has given you some output
about itself: which branch you committed to (master), what SHA-1 checksum the commit has
(463dc4f), how many files were changed, and statistics about lines added and removed in the
commit.
<p>Remember that the commit records the snapshot you set up in your staging area. Anything you
didn&rsquo;t stage is still sitting there modified; you can do another commit to add it to your history. Every
time you perform a commit, you&rsquo;re recording a snapshot of your project that you can revert to or
compare to later.
<p>Skipping the Staging Area
<p>Although it can be amazingly useful for crafting commits exactly how you want them, the staging
area is sometimes a bit more complex than you need in your workflow. If you want to skip the
<p>36</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>staging area, Git provides a simple shortcut. Adding the -a option to the git commit command makes
Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip
the git add part:
<p>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
&nbsp; (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
<p>&nbsp; modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
<p>no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git commit -a -m 'Add new benchmarks'
[master 83e38c7] Add new benchmarks
&nbsp;1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
<p>Notice how you don&rsquo;t have to run git add on the CONTRIBUTING.md file in this case before you commit.
That&rsquo;s because the -a flag includes all changed files. This is convenient, but be careful; sometimes
this flag will cause you to include unwanted changes.
<p>Removing Files
<p>To remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files (more accurately, remove it
from your staging area) and then commit. The git rm command does that, and also removes the file
from your working directory so you don&rsquo;t see it as an untracked file the next time around.
<p>If you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under the &ldquo;Changes not
staged for commit&rdquo; (that is, unstaged) area of your git status output:
<p>$ rm PROJECTS.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
&nbsp; (use "git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
&nbsp; (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
<p>&nbsp; deleted: PROJECTS.md
<p>no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
<p>Then, if you run git rm, it stages the file&rsquo;s removal:
<p>37</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git rm PROJECTS.md
rm 'PROJECTS.md'
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; deleted: PROJECTS.md
<p>The next time you commit, the file will be gone and no longer tracked. If you modified the file or
had already added it to the staging area, you must force the removal with the -f option. This is a
safety feature to prevent accidental removal of data that hasn&rsquo;t yet been recorded in a snapshot and
that can&rsquo;t be recovered from Git.
<p>Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from
your staging area. In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have
Git track it anymore. This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your .gitignore
file and accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of .a compiled files. To do this, use the
--cached option:
<p>$ git rm --cached README
<p>You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the git rm command. That means you can do
things such as:
<p>$ git rm log/\*.log
<p>Note the backslash (\) in front of the *. This is necessary because Git does its own filename
expansion in addition to your shell&rsquo;s filename expansion. This command removes all files that have
the .log extension in the log/ directory. Or, you can do something like this:
<p>$ git rm \*~
<p>This command removes all files whose names end with a ~.
<p>Moving Files
<p>Unlike many other VCS systems, Git doesn&rsquo;t explicitly track file movement. If you rename a file in
Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you renamed the file. However, Git is pretty smart about
figuring that out after the fact&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we&rsquo;ll deal with detecting file movement a bit later.
<p>Thus it&rsquo;s a bit confusing that Git has a mv command. If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run
something like:
<p>38</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git mv file_from file_to
<p>and it works fine. In fact, if you run something like this and look at the status, you&rsquo;ll see that Git
considers it a renamed file:
<p>$ git mv README.md README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; renamed: README.md -&gt; README
<p>However, this is equivalent to running something like this:
<p>$ mv README.md README
$ git rm README.md
$ git add README
<p>Git figures out that it&rsquo;s a rename implicitly, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you rename a file that way or with
the mv command. The only real difference is that git mv is one command instead of three&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s a
convenience function. More importantly, you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and address
the add/rm later, before you commit.
<p>Viewing the Commit History
After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit
history, you&rsquo;ll probably want to look back to see what has happened. The most basic and powerful
tool to do this is the git log command.
<p>These examples use a very simple project called &ldquo;simplegit&rdquo;. To get the project, run
<p>$ git clone https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
<p>When you run git log in this project, you should get output that looks something like this:
<p>39</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">

<p>&nbsp; Initial commit
<p>By default, with no arguments, git log lists the commits made in that repository in reverse
chronological order; that is, the most recent commits show up first. As you can see, this command
lists each commit with its SHA-1 checksum, the author&rsquo;s name and email, the date written, and the
commit message.
<p>A huge number and variety of options to the git log command are available to show you exactly
what you&rsquo;re looking for. Here, we&rsquo;ll show you some of the most popular.
<p>One of the more helpful options is -p or --patch, which shows the difference (the patch output)
introduced in each commit. You can also limit the number of log entries displayed, such as using -2
to show only the last two entries.

<p>This option displays the same information but with a diff directly following each entry. This is very
helpful for code review or to quickly browse what happened during a series of commits that a
collaborator has added. You can also use a series of summarizing options with git log. For
example, if you want to see some abbreviated stats for each commit, you can use the --stat option:

<p>As you can see, the --stat option prints below each commit entry a list of modified files, how many
files were changed, and how many lines in those files were added and removed. It also puts a
summary of the information at the end.
<p>Another really useful option is --pretty. This option changes the log output to formats other than
the default. A few prebuilt options are available for you to use. The oneline option prints each
commit on a single line, which is useful if you&rsquo;re looking at a lot of commits. In addition, the short,
full, and fuller options show the output in roughly the same format but with less or more
information, respectively:
<p>$ git log --pretty=oneline

<p>The most interesting option is format, which allows you to specify your own log output format. This
is especially useful when you&rsquo;re generating output for machine parsing&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;because you specify the
format explicitly, you know it won&rsquo;t change with updates to Git:

<p>%s Subject
<p>You may be wondering what the difference is between author and committer. The author is the
person who originally wrote the work, whereas the committer is the person who last applied the
work. So, if you send in a patch to a project and one of the core members applies the patch, both of
you get credit&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you as the author, and the core member as the committer. We&rsquo;ll cover this
distinction a bit more in Distributed Git.
<p>The oneline and format options are particularly useful with another log option called --graph. This
option adds a nice little ASCII graph showing your branch and merge history:

<div class="page">

<p>This type of output will become more interesting as we go through branching and merging in the
next chapter.
<p>Those are only some simple output-formatting options to git log&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;there are many more. Common
options to git log lists the options we&rsquo;ve covered so far, as well as some other common formatting
options that may be useful, along with how they change the output of the log command.
<p>Table 2. Common options to git log
<p>Option Description
<p>-p Show the patch introduced with each commit.
<p>--stat Show statistics for files modified in each commit.
<p>--shortstat Display only the changed/insertions/deletions line from the --stat command.
<p>--name-only Show the list of files modified after the commit information.
<p>--name-status Show the list of files affected with added/modified/deleted information as well.
<p>--abbrev-commit Show only the first few characters of the SHA-1 checksum instead of all 40.
<p>--relative-date Display the date in a relative format (for example, &ldquo;2 weeks ago&rdquo;) instead of
using the full date format.
<p>--graph Display an ASCII graph of the branch and merge history beside the log output.
<p>--pretty Show commits in an alternate format. Options include oneline, short, full,
fuller, and format (where you specify your own format).
<p>--oneline Shorthand for --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit used together.
<p>Limiting Log Output
<p>In addition to output-formatting options, git log takes a number of useful limiting options; that is,
options that let you show only a subset of commits. You&rsquo;ve seen one such option already&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the -2
option, which displays only the last two commits. In fact, you can do -&lt;n&gt;, where n is any integer to
show the last n commits. In reality, you&rsquo;re unlikely to use that often, because Git by default pipes all
output through a pager so you see only one page of log output at a time.
<p>However, the time-limiting options such as --since and --until are very useful. For example, this
command gets the list of commits made in the last two weeks:
<p>44</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git log --since=2.weeks
<p>This command works with lots of formats&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can specify a specific date like "2008-01-15", or a
relative date such as "2 years 1 day 3 minutes ago".
<p>You can also filter the list to commits that match some search criteria. The --author option allows
you to filter on a specific author, and the --grep option lets you search for keywords in the commit
messages.
<p>
<p>You can specify more than one instance of both the --author and --grep search
criteria, which will limit the commit output to commits that match any of the
--author patterns and any of the --grep patterns; however, adding the --all-match
option further limits the output to just those commits that match all --grep
patterns.
<p>Another really helpful filter is the -S option (colloquially referred to as Git&rsquo;s &ldquo;pickaxe&rdquo; option),
which takes a string and shows only those commits that changed the number of occurrences of that
string. For instance, if you wanted to find the last commit that added or removed a reference to a
specific function, you could call:
<p>$ git log -S function_name
<p>The last really useful option to pass to git log as a filter is a path. If you specify a directory or file
name, you can limit the log output to commits that introduced a change to those files. This is always
the last option and is generally preceded by double dashes (--) to separate the paths from the
options.
<p>In Options to limit the output of git log we&rsquo;ll list these and a few other common options for your
reference.
<p>Table 3. Options to limit the output of git log
<p>Option Description
<p>-&lt;n&gt; Show only the last n commits
<p>--since, --after Limit the commits to those made after the specified date.
<p>--until, --before Limit the commits to those made before the specified date.
<p>--author Only show commits in which the author entry matches the
specified string.
<p>--committer Only show commits in which the committer entry matches the
specified string.
<p>--grep Only show commits with a commit message containing the string
<p>-S Only show commits adding or removing code matching the string
<p>For example, if you want to see which commits modifying test files in the Git source code history
<p>45</p>

can run something like this:

branch
<p>Of the nearly 40,000 commits in the Git source code history, this command shows the 6 that match
those criteria.
<p>
<p>Preventing the display of merge commits
<p>Depending on the workflow used in your repository, it&rsquo;s possible that a sizable
percentage of the commits in your log history are just merge commits, which
typically aren&rsquo;t very informative. To prevent the display of merge commits
cluttering up your log history, simply add the log option --no-merges.
<p>Undoing Things
At any stage, you may want to undo something. Here, we&rsquo;ll review a few basic tools for undoing
changes that you&rsquo;ve made. Be careful, because you can&rsquo;t always undo some of these undos. This is
one of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong.
<p>One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some
files, or you mess up your commit message. If you want to redo that commit, make the additional
changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the --amend option:
<p>$ git commit --amend
<p>This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit. If you&rsquo;ve made no changes since
your last commit (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit),
then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you&rsquo;ll change is your commit message.
<p>The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already contains the message of your previous
commit. You can edit the message the same as always, but it overwrites your previous commit.
<p>As an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted
to add to this commit, you can do something like this:
<p>46</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git add forgotten_file
$ git commit --amend
<p>You end up with a single commit&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the second commit replaces the results of the first.
<p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that when you&rsquo;re amending your last commit, you&rsquo;re
not so much fixing it as replacing it entirely with a new, improved commit that
pushes the old commit out of the way and puts the new commit in its place.
Effectively, it&rsquo;s as if the previous commit never happened, and it won&rsquo;t show up in
your repository history.
<p>The obvious value to amending commits is to make minor improvements to your
last commit, without cluttering your repository history with commit messages of
the form, &ldquo;Oops, forgot to add a file&rdquo; or &ldquo;Darn, fixing a typo in last commit&rdquo;.
<p>Unstaging a Staged File
<p>The next two sections demonstrate how to work with your staging area and working directory
changes. The nice part is that the command you use to determine the state of those two areas also
reminds you how to undo changes to them. For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve changed two files and
want to commit them as two separate changes, but you accidentally type git add * and stage them
both. How can you unstage one of the two? The git status command reminds you:
<p>$ git add *
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; renamed: README.md -&gt; README
&nbsp; modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
<p>Right below the &ldquo;Changes to be committed&rdquo; text, it says use git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;... to unstage. So,
let&rsquo;s use that advice to unstage the CONTRIBUTING.md file:
<p>47</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md
Unstaged changes after reset:
M CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; renamed: README.md -&gt; README
<p>Changes not staged for commit:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
&nbsp; (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
<p>&nbsp; modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
<p>The command is a bit strange, but it works. The CONTRIBUTING.md file is modified but once again
unstaged.
<p>
It&rsquo;s true that git reset can be a dangerous command, especially if you provide the
--hard flag. However, in the scenario described above, the file in your working
directory is not touched, so it&rsquo;s relatively safe.
<p>For now this magic invocation is all you need to know about the git reset command. We&rsquo;ll go into
much more detail about what reset does and how to master it to do really interesting things in
Reset Demystified.
<p>Unmodifying a Modified File
<p>What if you realize that you don&rsquo;t want to keep your changes to the CONTRIBUTING.md file? How can
you easily unmodify it&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;revert it back to what it looked like when you last committed (or initially
cloned, or however you got it into your working directory)? Luckily, git status tells you how to do
that, too. In the last example output, the unstaged area looks like this:
<p>Changes not staged for commit:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
&nbsp; (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
<p>&nbsp; modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
<p>It tells you pretty explicitly how to discard the changes you&rsquo;ve made. Let&rsquo;s do what it says:
<p>48</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git checkout -- CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; renamed: README.md -&gt; README
<p>You can see that the changes have been reverted.
<p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that git checkout -- &lt;file&gt; is a dangerous command.
Any local changes you made to that file are gone&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Git just replaced that file with
the most recently-committed version. Don&rsquo;t ever use this command unless you
absolutely know that you don&rsquo;t want those unsaved local changes.
<p>If you would like to keep the changes you&rsquo;ve made to that file but still need to get it out of the way
for now, we&rsquo;ll go over stashing and branching in Git Branching; these are generally better ways to
go.
<p>Remember, anything that is committed in Git can almost always be recovered. Even commits that
were on branches that were deleted or commits that were overwritten with an --amend commit can
be recovered (see Data Recovery for data recovery). However, anything you lose that was never
committed is likely never to be seen again.
<p>Working with Remotes
To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote
repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or
network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or
read/write for you. Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and
pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work. Managing remote
repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove remotes that are no longer
valid, manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more. In this
section, we&rsquo;ll cover some of these remote-management skills.
<p>
<p>Remote repositories can be on your local machine.
<p>It is entirely possible that you can be working with a &ldquo;remote&rdquo; repository that is, in
fact, on the same host you are. The word &ldquo;remote&rdquo; does not necessarily imply that
the repository is somewhere else on the network or Internet, only that it is
elsewhere. Working with such a remote repository would still involve all the
standard pushing, pulling and fetching operations as with any other remote.
<p>Showing Your Remotes
<p>To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the git remote command. It lists the
shortnames of each remote handle you&rsquo;ve specified. If you&rsquo;ve cloned your repository, you should at
<p>49</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>least see origin&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from:
<p>$ git clone https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
Cloning into 'ticgit'...
remote: Reusing existing pack: 1857, done.
remote: Total 1857 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (1857/1857), 374.35 KiB | 268.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (772/772), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
$ cd ticgit
$ git remote
origin
<p>You can also specify -v, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used
when reading and writing to that remote:
<p>$ git remote -v
origin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
<p>If you have more than one remote, the command lists them all. For example, a repository with
multiple remotes for working with several collaborators might look something like this.
<p>$ cd grit
$ git remote -v
bakkdoor https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (fetch)
bakkdoor https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (push)
cho45 https://github.com/cho45/grit (fetch)
cho45 https://github.com/cho45/grit (push)
defunkt https://github.com/defunkt/grit (fetch)
defunkt https://github.com/defunkt/grit (push)
koke git://github.com/koke/grit.git (fetch)
koke git://github.com/koke/grit.git (push)
origin git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (push)
<p>This means we can pull contributions from any of these users pretty easily. We may additionally
have permission to push to one or more of these, though we can&rsquo;t tell that here.
<p>Notice that these remotes use a variety of protocols; we&rsquo;ll cover more about this in Getting Git on a
Server.
<p>Adding Remote Repositories
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the git clone command implicitly adds
the origin remote for you. Here&rsquo;s how to add a new remote explicitly. To add a new remote Git
repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run git remote add &lt;shortname&gt; &lt;url&gt;:
<p>50</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git remote
origin
$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
$ git remote -v
origin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)
pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)
<p>Now you can use the string pb on the command line in lieu of the whole URL. For example, if you
want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don&rsquo;t yet have in your repository, you
can run git fetch pb:
<p>$ git fetch pb
remote: Counting objects: 43, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (36/36), done.
remote: Total 43 (delta 10), reused 31 (delta 5)
Unpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.
From https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
&nbsp;* [new branch] master -&gt; pb/master
&nbsp;* [new branch] ticgit -&gt; pb/ticgit
<p>Paul&rsquo;s master branch is now accessible locally as pb/master&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can merge it into one of your
branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it. (We&rsquo;ll go over
what branches are and how to use them in much more detail in Git Branching.)
<p>Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes
<p>As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:
<p>$ git fetch &lt;remote&gt;
<p>The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project
that you don&rsquo;t have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that
remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.
<p>If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name
&ldquo;origin&rdquo;. So, git fetch origin fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you
cloned (or last fetched from) it. It&rsquo;s important to note that the git fetch command only downloads
the data to your local repository&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it doesn&rsquo;t automatically merge it with any of your work or
modify what you&rsquo;re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when
you&rsquo;re ready.
<p>If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch (see the next section and Git Branching for
more information), you can use the git pull command to automatically fetch and then merge that
remote branch into your current branch. This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for
<p>51</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>you; and by default, the git clone command automatically sets up your local master branch to track
the remote master branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from.
Running git pull generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and
automatically tries to merge it into the code you&rsquo;re currently working on.
<p>Pushing to Your Remotes
<p>When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The
command for this is simple: git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;. If you want to push your master branch to
your origin server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically),
then you can run this to push any commits you&rsquo;ve done back up to the server:
<p>$ git push origin master
<p>This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if
nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push
upstream and then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected. You&rsquo;ll have to fetch their
work first and incorporate it into yours before you&rsquo;ll be allowed to push. See Git Branching for
more detailed information on how to push to remote servers.
<p>Inspecting a Remote
<p>If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the git remote show
&lt;remote&gt; command. If you run this command with a particular shortname, such as origin, you get
something like this:
<p>$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
&nbsp; Fetch URL: https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
&nbsp; Push URL: https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
&nbsp; HEAD branch: master
&nbsp; Remote branches:
&nbsp; master tracked
&nbsp; dev-branch tracked
&nbsp; Local branch configured for 'git pull':
&nbsp; master merges with remote master
&nbsp; Local ref configured for 'git push':
&nbsp; master pushes to master (up to date)
<p>It lists the URL for the remote repository as well as the tracking branch information. The command
helpfully tells you that if you&rsquo;re on the master branch and you run git pull, it will automatically
merge in the master branch on the remote after it fetches all the remote references. It also lists all
the remote references it has pulled down.
<p>That is a simple example you&rsquo;re likely to encounter. When you&rsquo;re using Git more heavily, however,
you may see much more information from git remote show:
<p>52</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
&nbsp; URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
&nbsp; Fetch URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
&nbsp; Push URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
&nbsp; HEAD branch: master
&nbsp; Remote branches:
&nbsp; master tracked
&nbsp; dev-branch tracked
&nbsp; markdown-strip tracked
&nbsp; issue-43 new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
&nbsp; issue-45 new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
&nbsp; refs/remotes/origin/issue-11 stale (use 'git remote prune' to remove)
&nbsp; Local branches configured for 'git pull':
&nbsp; dev-branch merges with remote dev-branch
&nbsp; master merges with remote master
&nbsp; Local refs configured for 'git push':
&nbsp; dev-branch pushes to dev-branch (up to
date)
&nbsp; markdown-strip pushes to markdown-strip (up to
date)
&nbsp; master pushes to master (up to
date)
<p>This command shows which branch is automatically pushed to when you run git push while on
certain branches. It also shows you which remote branches on the server you don&rsquo;t yet have, which
remote branches you have that have been removed from the server, and multiple local branches
that are able to merge automatically with their remote-tracking branch when you run git pull.
<p>Renaming and Removing Remotes
<p>You can run git remote rename to change a remote&rsquo;s shortname. For instance, if you want to rename
pb to paul, you can do so with git remote rename:
<p>$ git remote rename pb paul
$ git remote
origin
paul
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that this changes all your remote-tracking branch names, too. What used to
be referenced at pb/master is now at paul/master.
<p>If you want to remove a remote for some reason&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you&rsquo;ve moved the server or are no longer using
a particular mirror, or perhaps a contributor isn&rsquo;t contributing anymore&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can either use git
remote remove or git remote rm:
<p>53</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git remote remove paul
$ git remote
origin
<p>Once you delete the reference to a remote this way, all remote-tracking branches and configuration
settings associated with that remote are also deleted.
<p>Tagging
Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository&rsquo;s history as being important.
Typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on). In this section,
you&rsquo;ll learn how to list existing tags, how to create and delete tags, and what the different types of
tags are.
<p>Listing Your Tags
<p>Listing the existing tags in Git is straightforward. Just type git tag (with optional -l or --list):
<p>$ git tag
v1.0
v2.0
<p>This command lists the tags in alphabetical order; the order in which they are displayed has no real
importance.
<p>You can also search for tags that match a particular pattern. The Git source repo, for instance,
contains more than 500 tags. If you&rsquo;re interested only in looking at the 1.8.5 series, you can run this:
<p>$ git tag -l "v1.8.5*"
v1.8.5
v1.8.5-rc0
v1.8.5-rc1
v1.8.5-rc2
v1.8.5-rc3
v1.8.5.1
v1.8.5.2
v1.8.5.3
v1.8.5.4
v1.8.5.5
<p>54</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>
<p>Listing tag wildcards requires -l or --list option
<p>If you want just the entire list of tags, running the command git tag implicitly
assumes you want a listing and provides one; the use of -l or --list in this case is
optional.
<p>If, however, you&rsquo;re supplying a wildcard pattern to match tag names, the use of -l
or --list is mandatory.
<p>Creating Tags
<p>Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated.
<p>A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn&rsquo;t change&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s just a pointer to a specific
commit.
<p>Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They&rsquo;re checksummed;
contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified
with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). It&rsquo;s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you
can have all this information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don&rsquo;t want to
keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.
<p>Annotated Tags
<p>Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify -a when you run the tag
command:
<p>$ git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
$ git tag
v0.1
v1.3
v1.4
<p>The -m specifies a tagging message, which is stored with the tag. If you don&rsquo;t specify a message for
an annotated tag, Git launches your editor so you can type it in.
<p>You can see the tag data along with the commit that was tagged by using the git show command:
<p>55</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git show v1.4
tag v1.4

<p>&nbsp; Change version number
<p>That shows the tagger information, the date the commit was tagged, and the annotation message
before showing the commit information.
<p>Lightweight Tags
<p>Another way to tag commits is with a lightweight tag. This is basically the commit checksum stored
in a file&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;no other information is kept. To create a lightweight tag, don&rsquo;t supply any of the -a, -s, or
-m options, just provide a tag name:
<p>$ git tag v1.4-lw
$ git tag
v0.1
v1.3
v1.4
v1.4-lw
v1.5
<p>This time, if you run git show on the tag, you don&rsquo;t see the extra tag information. The command just
shows the commit:
<p>$ git show v1.4-lw
commit ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949
Author: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gee-mail.com&gt;
Date: Mon Mar 17 21:52:11 2008 -0700
<p>&nbsp; Change version number
<p>Tagging Later
<p>You can also tag commits after you&rsquo;ve moved past them. Suppose your commit history looks like
this:
<p>56</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git log --pretty=oneline

can add it after the fact. To tag that commit, you specify the commit checksum (or part of it) at the

<p>Sharing Tags
<p>By default, the git push command doesn&rsquo;t transfer tags to remote servers. You will have to explicitly
push tags to a shared server after you have created them. This process is just like sharing remote
branches&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can run git push origin &lt;tagname&gt;.
<p>57</p>
<br>

<p>If you have a lot of tags that you want to push up at once, you can also use the --tags option to the
git push command. This will transfer all of your tags to the remote server that are not already
there.

<p>Now, when someone else clones or pulls from your repository, they will get all your tags as well.
<p>
<p>git push pushes both types of tags
<p>Pushing tags using git push &lt;remote&gt; --tags does not distinguish between
lightweight and annotated tags; there is no simple option that allows you to select
just one type for pushing.
<p>Deleting Tags
<p>To delete a tag on your local repository, you can use git tag -d &lt;tagname&gt;. For example, we could
remove our lightweight tag above as follows:
<p>$ git tag -d v1.4-lw
Deleted tag 'v1.4-lw' (was e7d5add)
<p>Note that this does not remove the tag from any remote servers. There are two common variations
for deleting a tag from a remote server.
<p>The first variation is git push &lt;remote&gt; :refs/tags/&lt;tagname&gt;:
<p>$ git push origin :refs/tags/v1.4-lw
To /git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
&nbsp;- [deleted] v1.4-lw
<p>58</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>The way to interpret the above is to read it as the null value before the colon is being pushed to the
remote tag name, effectively deleting it.
<p>The second (and more intuitive) way to delete a remote tag is with:
<p>$ git push origin --delete &lt;tagname&gt;
<p>Checking out Tags
<p>If you want to view the versions of files a tag is pointing to, you can do a git checkout of that tag,
although this puts your repository in &ldquo;detached HEAD&rdquo; state, which has some ill side effects:
<p>$ git checkout v2.0.0
Note: checking out 'v2.0.0'.
<p>You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
<p>If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:
<p>&nbsp; git checkout -b &lt;new-branch&gt;
<p>HEAD is now at 99ada87... Merge pull request #89 from schacon/appendix-final
<p>$ git checkout 2.0-beta-0.1
Previous HEAD position was 99ada87... Merge pull request #89 from schacon/appendix-
final
HEAD is now at df3f601... Add atlas.json and cover image
<p>In &ldquo;detached HEAD&rdquo; state, if you make changes and then create a commit, the tag will stay the same,
but your new commit won&rsquo;t belong to any branch and will be unreachable, except by the exact
commit hash. Thus, if you need to make changes&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;say you&rsquo;re fixing a bug on an older version, for
instance&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you will generally want to create a branch:
<p>$ git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0
Switched to a new branch 'version2'
<p>If you do this and make a commit, your version2 branch will be slightly different than your v2.0.0
tag since it will move forward with your new changes, so do be careful.
<p>Git Aliases
Before we finish this chapter on basic Git, there&rsquo;s just one little tip that can make your Git
experience simpler, easier, and more familiar: aliases. We won&rsquo;t refer to them or assume you&rsquo;ve
<p>59</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>used them later in the book, but you should probably know how to use them.
<p>Git doesn&rsquo;t automatically infer your command if you type it in partially. If you don&rsquo;t want to type
the entire text of each of the Git commands, you can easily set up an alias for each command using
git config. Here are a couple of examples you may want to set up:
<p>$ git config --global alias.co checkout
$ git config --global alias.br branch
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.st status
<p>This means that, for example, instead of typing git commit, you just need to type git ci. As you go
on using Git, you&rsquo;ll probably use other commands frequently as well; don&rsquo;t hesitate to create new
aliases.
<p>This technique can also be very useful in creating commands that you think should exist. For
example, to correct the usability problem you encountered with unstaging a file, you can add your
own unstage alias to Git:
<p>$ git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'
<p>This makes the following two commands equivalent:
<p>$ git unstage fileA
$ git reset HEAD -- fileA
<p>This seems a bit clearer. It&rsquo;s also common to add a last command, like this:
<p>$ git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'
<p>This way, you can see the last commit easily:
<p>$ git last
commit 66938dae3329c7aebe598c2246a8e6af90d04646

<p>&nbsp; Test for current head
<p>&nbsp; Signed-off-by: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@example.com&gt;
<p>As you can tell, Git simply replaces the new command with whatever you alias it for. However,
maybe you want to run an external command, rather than a Git subcommand. In that case, you
start the command with a ! character. This is useful if you write your own tools that work with a
Git repository. We can demonstrate by aliasing git visual to run gitk:
<p>60</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git config --global alias.visual '!gitk'
<p>Summary
At this point, you can do all the basic local Git operations&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;creating or cloning a repository, making
changes, staging and committing those changes, and viewing the history of all the changes the
repository has been through. Next, we&rsquo;ll cover Git&rsquo;s killer feature: its branching model.
<p>61</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Git Branching
Nearly every VCS has some form of branching support. Branching means you diverge from the
main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. In many
VCS tools, this is a somewhat expensive process, often requiring you to create a new copy of your
source code directory, which can take a long time for large projects.
<p>Some people refer to Git&rsquo;s branching model as its &ldquo;killer feature,&rdquo; and it certainly sets Git apart in
the VCS community. Why is it so special? The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making
branching operations nearly instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches
generally just as fast. Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages workflows that branch and merge
often, even multiple times in a day. Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a powerful
and unique tool and can entirely change the way that you develop.
<p>Branches in a Nutshell
To really understand the way Git does branching, we need to take a step back and examine how Git
stores its data.
<p>As you may remember from Getting Started, Git doesn&rsquo;t store data as a series of changesets or
differences, but instead as a series of snapshots.
<p>When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the
content you staged. This object also contains the author&rsquo;s name and email address, the message that
you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent
or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple
parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.
<p>To visualize this, let&rsquo;s assume that you have a directory containing three files, and you stage them
all and commit. Staging the files computes a checksum for each one (the SHA-1 hash we mentioned
in Getting Started), stores that version of the file in the Git repository (Git refers to them as blobs),
and adds that checksum to the staging area:
<p>$ git add README test.rb LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
<p>When you create the commit by running git commit, Git checksums each subdirectory (in this case,
just the root project directory) and stores them as a tree object in the Git repository. Git then creates
a commit object that has the metadata and a pointer to the root project tree so it can re-create that
snapshot when needed.
<p>Your Git repository now contains five objects: three blobs (each representing the contents of one of
the three files), one tree that lists the contents of the directory and specifies which file names are
stored as which blobs, and one commit with the pointer to that root tree and all the commit
metadata.
<p>62</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 9. A commit and its tree
<p>If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a pointer to the commit that
came immediately before it.
<p>Figure 10. Commits and their parents
<p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch
name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you&rsquo;re given a master branch that points to the
last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward
automatically.
<p>
The &ldquo;master&rdquo; branch in Git is not a special branch. It is exactly like any other
branch. The only reason nearly every repository has one is that the git init
command creates it by default and most people don&rsquo;t bother to change it.
<p>63</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 11. A branch and its commit history
<p>Creating a New Branch
<p>What happens when you create a new branch? Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to
move around. Let&rsquo;s say you want to create a new branch called testing. You do this with the git
branch command:
<p>$ git branch testing
<p>This creates a new pointer to the same commit you&rsquo;re currently on.
<p>Figure 12. Two branches pointing into the same series of commits
<p>How does Git know what branch you&rsquo;re currently on? It keeps a special pointer called HEAD. Note
that this is a lot different than the concept of HEAD in other VCSs you may be used to, such as
Subversion or CVS. In Git, this is a pointer to the local branch you&rsquo;re currently on. In this case,
you&rsquo;re still on master. The git branch command only created a new branch&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it didn&rsquo;t switch to that
<p>64</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>branch.
<p>Figure 13. HEAD pointing to a branch
<p>You can easily see this by running a simple git log command that shows you where the branch
pointers are pointing. This option is called --decorate.
<p>$ git log --oneline --decorate
f30ab (HEAD -&gt; master, testing) Add feature #32 - ability to add new formats to the
central interface
34ac2 Fix bug #1328 - stack overflow under certain conditions
98ca9 Initial commit
<p>You can see the master and testing branches that are right there next to the f30ab commit.
<p>Switching Branches
<p>To switch to an existing branch, you run the git checkout command. Let&rsquo;s switch to the new testing
branch:
<p>$ git checkout testing
<p>This moves HEAD to point to the testing branch.
<p>65</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 14. HEAD points to the current branch
<p>What is the significance of that? Well, let&rsquo;s do another commit:
<p>$ vim test.rb
$ git commit -a -m 'made a change'
<p>Figure 15. The HEAD branch moves forward when a commit is made
<p>This is interesting, because now your testing branch has moved forward, but your master branch
still points to the commit you were on when you ran git checkout to switch branches. Let&rsquo;s switch
back to the master branch:
<p>$ git checkout master
<p>66</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>
<p>git log doesn&rsquo;t show all the branches all the time
<p>If you were to run git log right now, you might wonder where the "testing"
branch you just created went, as it would not appear in the output.
<p>The branch hasn&rsquo;t disappeared; Git just doesn&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re interested in that
branch and it is trying to show you what it thinks you&rsquo;re interested in. In other
words, by default, git log will only show commit history below the branch you&rsquo;ve
checked out.
<p>To show commit history for the desired branch you have to explicitly specify it: git
log testing. To show all of the branches, add --all to your git log command.
<p>Figure 16. HEAD moves when you checkout
<p>That command did two things. It moved the HEAD pointer back to point to the master branch, and it
reverted the files in your working directory back to the snapshot that master points to. This also
means the changes you make from this point forward will diverge from an older version of the
project. It essentially rewinds the work you&rsquo;ve done in your testing branch so you can go in a
different direction.
<p>
<p>Switching branches changes files in your working directory
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that when you switch branches in Git, files in your working
directory will change. If you switch to an older branch, your working directory
will be reverted to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch. If Git
cannot do it cleanly, it will not let you switch at all.
<p>Let&rsquo;s make a few changes and commit again:
<p>$ vim test.rb
$ git commit -a -m 'made other changes'
<p>Now your project history has diverged (see Divergent history). You created and switched to a
branch, did some work on it, and then switched back to your main branch and did other work. Both
of those changes are isolated in separate branches: you can switch back and forth between the
<p>67</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>branches and merge them together when you&rsquo;re ready. And you did all that with simple branch,
checkout, and commit commands.
<p>Figure 17. Divergent history
<p>You can also see this easily with the git log command. If you run git log --oneline --decorate
--graph --all it will print out the history of your commits, showing where your branch pointers are
and how your history has diverged.
<p>$ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
* c2b9e (HEAD, master) Made other changes
| * 87ab2 (testing) Made a change
|/
* f30ab Add feature #32 - ability to add new formats to the central interface
* 34ac2 Fix bug #1328 - stack overflow under certain conditions
* 98ca9 initial commit of my project
<p>Because a branch in Git is actually a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of
the commit it points to, branches are cheap to create and destroy. Creating a new branch is as quick
and simple as writing 41 bytes to a file (40 characters and a newline).
<p>This is in sharp contrast to the way most older VCS tools branch, which involves copying all of the
project&rsquo;s files into a second directory. This can take several seconds or even minutes, depending on
the size of the project, whereas in Git the process is always instantaneous. Also, because we&rsquo;re
recording the parents when we commit, finding a proper merge base for merging is automatically
done for us and is generally very easy to do. These features help encourage developers to create
and use branches often.
<p>Let&rsquo;s see why you should do so.
<p>68</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>
<p>Creating a new branch and switching to it at the same time
<p>It&rsquo;s typical to create a new branch and want to switch to that new branch at the
same time&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this can be done in one operation with git checkout -b
&lt;newbranchname&gt;.
<p>Basic Branching and Merging
Let&rsquo;s go through a simple example of branching and merging with a workflow that you might use in
the real world. You&rsquo;ll follow these steps:
<p>1. Do some work on a website.
<p>2. Create a branch for a new user story you&rsquo;re working on.
<p>3. Do some work in that branch.
<p>At this stage, you&rsquo;ll receive a call that another issue is critical and you need a hotfix. You&rsquo;ll do the
following:
<p>1. Switch to your production branch.
<p>2. Create a branch to add the hotfix.
<p>3. After it&rsquo;s tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.
<p>4. Switch back to your original user story and continue working.
<p>Basic Branching
<p>First, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re working on your project and have a couple of commits already on the master
branch.
<p>Figure 18. A simple commit history
<p>You&rsquo;ve decided that you&rsquo;re going to work on issue #53 in whatever issue-tracking system your
company uses. To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git
checkout command with the -b switch:
<p>$ git checkout -b iss53
Switched to a new branch "iss53"
<p>69</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>This is shorthand for:
<p>$ git branch iss53
$ git checkout iss53
<p>Figure 19. Creating a new branch pointer
<p>You work on your website and do some commits. Doing so moves the iss53 branch forward,
because you have it checked out (that is, your HEAD is pointing to it):
<p>$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'Create new footer [issue 53]'
<p>Figure 20. The iss53 branch has moved forward with your work
<p>Now you get the call that there is an issue with the website, and you need to fix it immediately. With
Git, you don&rsquo;t have to deploy your fix along with the iss53 changes you&rsquo;ve made, and you don&rsquo;t
have to put a lot of effort into reverting those changes before you can work on applying your fix to
what is in production. All you have to do is switch back to your master branch.
<p>70</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>However, before you do that, note that if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted
changes that conflict with the branch you&rsquo;re checking out, Git won&rsquo;t let you switch branches. It&rsquo;s
best to have a clean working state when you switch branches. There are ways to get around this
(namely, stashing and commit amending) that we&rsquo;ll cover later on, in Stashing and Cleaning. For
now, let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;ve committed all your changes, so you can switch back to your master branch:
<p>$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
<p>At this point, your project working directory is exactly the way it was before you started working
on issue #53, and you can concentrate on your hotfix. This is an important point to remember:
when you switch branches, Git resets your working directory to look like it did the last time you
committed on that branch. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your
working copy is what the branch looked like on your last commit to it.
<p>Next, you have a hotfix to make. Let&rsquo;s create a hotfix branch on which to work until it&rsquo;s completed:
<p>$ git checkout -b hotfix
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix'
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'Fix broken email address'
[hotfix 1fb7853] Fix broken email address
&nbsp;1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
<p>Figure 21. Hotfix branch based on master
<p>You can run your tests, make sure the hotfix is what you want, and finally merge the hotfix branch
back into your master branch to deploy to production. You do this with the git merge command:
<p>71</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git checkout master
$ git merge hotfix
Updating f42c576..3a0874c
Fast-forward
&nbsp;index.html | 2 ++
&nbsp;1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the phrase &ldquo;fast-forward&rdquo; in that merge. Because the commit C4 pointed to by the
branch hotfix you merged in was directly ahead of the commit C2 you&rsquo;re on, Git simply moves the
pointer forward. To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with a commit
that can be reached by following the first commit&rsquo;s history, Git simplifies things by moving the
pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this is called a &ldquo;fast-
forward.&rdquo;
<p>Your change is now in the snapshot of the commit pointed to by the master branch, and you can
deploy the fix.
<p>Figure 22. master is fast-forwarded to hotfix
<p>After your super-important fix is deployed, you&rsquo;re ready to switch back to the work you were doing
before you were interrupted. However, first you&rsquo;ll delete the hotfix branch, because you no longer
need it&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the master branch points at the same place. You can delete it with the -d option to git
branch:
<p>$ git branch -d hotfix
Deleted branch hotfix (3a0874c).
<p>Now you can switch back to your work-in-progress branch on issue #53 and continue working on it.
<p>72</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git checkout iss53
Switched to branch "iss53"
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'Finish the new footer [issue 53]'
[iss53 ad82d7a] Finish the new footer [issue 53]
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
<p>Figure 23. Work continues on iss53
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting here that the work you did in your hotfix branch is not contained in the files in
your iss53 branch. If you need to pull it in, you can merge your master branch into your iss53
branch by running git merge master, or you can wait to integrate those changes until you decide to
pull the iss53 branch back into master later.
<p>Basic Merging
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;ve decided that your issue #53 work is complete and ready to be merged into your
master branch. In order to do that, you&rsquo;ll merge your iss53 branch into master, much like you
merged your hotfix branch earlier. All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to merge
into and then run the git merge command:
<p>$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge iss53
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
index.html | 1 +
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
<p>This looks a bit different than the hotfix merge you did earlier. In this case, your development
history has diverged from some older point. Because the commit on the branch you&rsquo;re on isn&rsquo;t a
direct ancestor of the branch you&rsquo;re merging in, Git has to do some work. In this case, Git does a
simple three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common
<p>73</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>ancestor of the two.
<p>Figure 24. Three snapshots used in a typical merge
<p>Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this
three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it. This is referred to as a
merge commit, and is special in that it has more than one parent.
<p>Figure 25. A merge commit
<p>Now that your work is merged in, you have no further need for the iss53 branch. You can close the
issue in your issue-tracking system, and delete the branch:
<p>$ git branch -d iss53
<p>Basic Merge Conflicts
<p>Occasionally, this process doesn&rsquo;t go smoothly. If you changed the same part of the same file
differently in the two branches you&rsquo;re merging, Git won&rsquo;t be able to merge them cleanly. If your fix
for issue #53 modified the same part of a file as the hotfix branch, you&rsquo;ll get a merge conflict that
<p>74</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>looks something like this:
<p>$ git merge iss53
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
<p>Git hasn&rsquo;t automatically created a new merge commit. It has paused the process while you resolve
the conflict. If you want to see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict, you can
run git status:
<p>$ git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
&nbsp; (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
<p>Unmerged paths:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to mark resolution)
<p>&nbsp; both modified: index.html
<p>no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
<p>Anything that has merge conflicts and hasn&rsquo;t been resolved is listed as unmerged. Git adds standard
conflict-resolution markers to the files that have conflicts, so you can open them manually and
resolve those conflicts. Your file contains a section that looks something like this:
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:index.html
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;contact : email.support@github.com&lt;/div&gt;
=======
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;
&nbsp;please contact us at support@github.com
&lt;/div&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iss53:index.html
<p>This means the version in HEAD (your master branch, because that was what you had checked out
when you ran your merge command) is the top part of that block (everything above the =======),
while the version in your iss53 branch looks like everything in the bottom part. In order to resolve
the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself. For
instance, you might resolve this conflict by replacing the entire block with this:
<p>&lt;div id="footer"&gt;
please contact us at email.support@github.com
&lt;/div&gt;
<p>This resolution has a little of each section, and the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines have been
<p>75</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>completely removed. After you&rsquo;ve resolved each of these sections in each conflicted file, run git add
on each file to mark it as resolved. Staging the file marks it as resolved in Git.
<p>If you want to use a graphical tool to resolve these issues, you can run git mergetool, which fires up
an appropriate visual merge tool and walks you through the conflicts:
<p>$ git mergetool
<p>This message is displayed because 'merge.tool' is not configured.
See 'git mergetool --tool-help' or 'git help config' for more details.
'git mergetool' will now attempt to use one of the following tools:
opendiff kdiff3 tkdiff xxdiff meld tortoisemerge gvimdiff diffuse diffmerge ecmerge
p4merge araxis bc3 codecompare vimdiff emerge
Merging:
index.html
<p>Normal merge conflict for 'index.html':
&nbsp; {local}: modified file
&nbsp; {remote}: modified file
Hit return to start merge resolution tool (opendiff):
<p>If you want to use a merge tool other than the default (Git chose opendiff in this case because the
command was run on a Mac), you can see all the supported tools listed at the top after &ldquo;one of the
following tools.&rdquo; Just type the name of the tool you&rsquo;d rather use.
<p>
If you need more advanced tools for resolving tricky merge conflicts, we cover
more on merging in Advanced Merging.
<p>After you exit the merge tool, Git asks you if the merge was successful. If you tell the script that it
was, it stages the file to mark it as resolved for you. You can run git status again to verify that all
conflicts have been resolved:
<p>$ git status
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
&nbsp; (use "git commit" to conclude merge)
<p>Changes to be committed:
<p>&nbsp; modified: index.html
<p>If you&rsquo;re happy with that, and you verify that everything that had conflicts has been staged, you can
type git commit to finalize the merge commit. The commit message by default looks something like
this:
<p>76</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Merge branch 'iss53'
<p>Conflicts:
&nbsp; index.html
#
# It looks like you may be committing a merge.
# If this is not correct, please remove the file
# .git/MERGE_HEAD
# and try again.
<p># Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
#
# Changes to be committed:
# modified: index.html
#
<p>If you think it would be helpful to others looking at this merge in the future, you can modify this
commit message with details about how you resolved the merge and explain why you did the
changes you made if these are not obvious.
<p>Branch Management
Now that you&rsquo;ve created, merged, and deleted some branches, let&rsquo;s look at some branch-
management tools that will come in handy when you begin using branches all the time.
<p>The git branch command does more than just create and delete branches. If you run it with no
arguments, you get a simple listing of your current branches:
<p>$ git branch
&nbsp; iss53
* master
&nbsp; testing
<p>Notice the * character that prefixes the master branch: it indicates the branch that you currently
have checked out (i.e., the branch that HEAD points to). This means that if you commit at this point,
the master branch will be moved forward with your new work. To see the last commit on each
branch, you can run git branch -v:
<p>$ git branch -v
&nbsp; iss53 93b412c Fix javascript issue
* master 7a98805 Merge branch 'iss53'
&nbsp; testing 782fd34 Add scott to the author list in the readme
<p>77</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>The useful --merged and --no-merged options can filter this list to branches that you have or have not
yet merged into the branch you&rsquo;re currently on. To see which branches are already merged into the
branch you&rsquo;re on, you can run git branch --merged:
<p>$ git branch --merged
&nbsp; iss53
* master
<p>Because you already merged in iss53 earlier, you see it in your list. Branches on this list without the
* in front of them are generally fine to delete with git branch -d; you&rsquo;ve already incorporated their
work into another branch, so you&rsquo;re not going to lose anything.
<p>To see all the branches that contain work you haven&rsquo;t yet merged in, you can run git branch --no
-merged:
<p>$ git branch --no-merged
&nbsp; testing
<p>This shows your other branch. Because it contains work that isn&rsquo;t merged in yet, trying to delete it
with git branch -d will fail:
<p>$ git branch -d testing
error: The branch 'testing' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D testing'.
<p>If you really do want to delete the branch and lose that work, you can force it with -D, as the helpful
message points out.
<p>
<p>The options described above, --merged and --no-merged will, if not given a commit
or branch name as an argument, show you what is, respectively, merged or not
merged into your current branch.
<p>You can always provide an additional argument to ask about the merge state with
respect to some other branch without checking that other branch out first, as in,
what is not merged into the master branch?
<p>$ git checkout testing
$ git branch --no-merged master
&nbsp; topicA
&nbsp; featureB
<p>Branching Workflows
Now that you have the basics of branching and merging down, what can or should you do with
<p>78</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>them? In this section, we&rsquo;ll cover some common workflows that this lightweight branching makes
possible, so you can decide if you would like to incorporate them into your own development cycle.
<p>Long-Running Branches
<p>Because Git uses a simple three-way merge, merging from one branch into another multiple times
over a long period is generally easy to do. This means you can have several branches that are
always open and that you use for different stages of your development cycle; you can merge
regularly from some of them into others.
<p>Many Git developers have a workflow that embraces this approach, such as having only code that is
entirely stable in their master branch&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;possibly only code that has been or will be released. They
have another parallel branch named develop or next that they work from or use to test stability&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it
isn&rsquo;t necessarily always stable, but whenever it gets to a stable state, it can be merged into master.
It&rsquo;s used to pull in topic branches (short-lived branches, like your earlier iss53 branch) when
they&rsquo;re ready, to make sure they pass all the tests and don&rsquo;t introduce bugs.
<p>In reality, we&rsquo;re talking about pointers moving up the line of commits you&rsquo;re making. The stable
branches are farther down the line in your commit history, and the bleeding-edge branches are
farther up the history.
<p>Figure 26. A linear view of progressive-stability branching
<p>It&rsquo;s generally easier to think about them as work silos, where sets of commits graduate to a more
stable silo when they&rsquo;re fully tested.
<p>Figure 27. A &ldquo;silo&rdquo; view of progressive-stability branching
<p>You can keep doing this for several levels of stability. Some larger projects also have a proposed or pu
(proposed updates) branch that has integrated branches that may not be ready to go into the next or
master branch. The idea is that your branches are at various levels of stability; when they reach a
<p>79</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>more stable level, they&rsquo;re merged into the branch above them. Again, having multiple long-running
branches isn&rsquo;t necessary, but it&rsquo;s often helpful, especially when you&rsquo;re dealing with very large or
complex projects.
<p>Topic Branches
<p>Topic branches, however, are useful in projects of any size. A topic branch is a short-lived branch
that you create and use for a single particular feature or related work. This is something you&rsquo;ve
likely never done with a VCS before because it&rsquo;s generally too expensive to create and merge
branches. But in Git it&rsquo;s common to create, work on, merge, and delete branches several times a day.
<p>You saw this in the last section with the iss53 and hotfix branches you created. You did a few
commits on them and deleted them directly after merging them into your main branch. This
technique allows you to context-switch quickly and completely&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;because your work is separated
into silos where all the changes in that branch have to do with that topic, it&rsquo;s easier to see what has
happened during code review and such. You can keep the changes there for minutes, days, or
months, and merge them in when they&rsquo;re ready, regardless of the order in which they were created
or worked on.
<p>Consider an example of doing some work (on master), branching off for an issue (iss91), working on
it for a bit, branching off the second branch to try another way of handling the same thing (
iss91v2), going back to your master branch and working there for a while, and then branching off
there to do some work that you&rsquo;re not sure is a good idea (dumbidea branch). Your commit history
will look something like this:
<p>80</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 28. Multiple topic branches
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s say you decide you like the second solution to your issue best (iss91v2); and you showed
the dumbidea branch to your coworkers, and it turns out to be genius. You can throw away the
original iss91 branch (losing commits C5 and C6) and merge in the other two. Your history then
looks like this:
<p>81</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 29. History after merging dumbidea and iss91v2
<p>We will go into more detail about the various possible workflows for your Git project in Distributed
Git, so before you decide which branching scheme your next project will use, be sure to read that
chapter.
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember when you&rsquo;re doing all this that these branches are completely local.
When you&rsquo;re branching and merging, everything is being done only in your Git repository&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;there
is no communication with the server.
<p>Remote Branches
Remote references are references (pointers) in your remote repositories, including branches, tags,
and so on. You can get a full list of remote references explicitly with git ls-remote &lt;remote&gt;, or git
remote show &lt;remote&gt; for remote branches as well as more information. Nevertheless, a more
common way is to take advantage of remote-tracking branches.
<p>82</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Remote-tracking branches are references to the state of remote branches. They&rsquo;re local references
that you can&rsquo;t move; Git moves them for you whenever you do any network communication, to
make sure they accurately represent the state of the remote repository. Think of them as
bookmarks, to remind you where the branches in your remote repositories were the last time you
connected to them.
<p>Remote-tracking branch names take the form &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;. For instance, if you wanted to see
what the master branch on your origin remote looked like as of the last time you communicated
with it, you would check the origin/master branch. If you were working on an issue with a partner
and they pushed up an iss53 branch, you might have your own local iss53 branch, but the branch
on the server would be represented by the remote-tracking branch origin/iss53.
<p>This may be a bit confusing, so let&rsquo;s look at an example. Let&rsquo;s say you have a Git server on your
network at git.ourcompany.com. If you clone from this, Git&rsquo;s clone command automatically names it
origin for you, pulls down all its data, creates a pointer to where its master branch is, and names it
origin/master locally. Git also gives you your own local master branch starting at the same place as
origin&rsquo;s master branch, so you have something to work from.
<p>
<p>&ldquo;origin&rdquo; is not special
<p>Just like the branch name &ldquo;master&rdquo; does not have any special meaning in Git,
neither does &ldquo;origin&rdquo;. While &ldquo;master&rdquo; is the default name for a starting branch
when you run git init which is the only reason it&rsquo;s widely used, &ldquo;origin&rdquo; is the
default name for a remote when you run git clone. If you run git clone -o booyah
instead, then you will have booyah/master as your default remote branch.
<p>83</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 30. Server and local repositories after cloning
<p>If you do some work on your local master branch, and, in the meantime, someone else pushes to
git.ourcompany.com and updates its master branch, then your histories move forward differently.
Also, as long as you stay out of contact with your origin server, your origin/master pointer doesn&rsquo;t
move.
<p>84</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 31. Local and remote work can diverge
<p>To synchronize your work with a given remote, you run a git fetch &lt;remote&gt; command (in our
case, git fetch origin). This command looks up which server &ldquo;origin&rdquo; is (in this case, it&rsquo;s
git.ourcompany.com), fetches any data from it that you don&rsquo;t yet have, and updates your local
database, moving your origin/master pointer to its new, more up-to-date position.
<p>85</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 32. git fetch updates your remote-tracking branches
<p>To demonstrate having multiple remote servers and what remote branches for those remote
projects look like, let&rsquo;s assume you have another internal Git server that is used only for
development by one of your sprint teams. This server is at git.team1.ourcompany.com. You can add it
as a new remote reference to the project you&rsquo;re currently working on by running the git remote
add command as we covered in Git Basics. Name this remote teamone, which will be your shortname
for that whole URL.
<p>86</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 33. Adding another server as a remote
<p>Now, you can run git fetch teamone to fetch everything the remote teamone server has that you
don&rsquo;t have yet. Because that server has a subset of the data your origin server has right now, Git
fetches no data but sets a remote-tracking branch called teamone/master to point to the commit that
teamone has as its master branch.
<p>87</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 34. Remote-tracking branch for teamone/master
<p>Pushing
<p>When you want to share a branch with the world, you need to push it up to a remote to which you
have write access. Your local branches aren&rsquo;t automatically synchronized to the remotes you write
to&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you have to explicitly push the branches you want to share. That way, you can use private
branches for work you don&rsquo;t want to share, and push up only the topic branches you want to
collaborate on.
<p>If you have a branch named serverfix that you want to work on with others, you can push it up the
same way you pushed your first branch. Run git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;:
<p>$ git push origin serverfix

&nbsp;* [new branch] serverfix -&gt; serverfix
<p>This is a bit of a shortcut. Git automatically expands the serverfix branchname out to
refs/heads/serverfix:refs/heads/serverfix, which means, &ldquo;Take my serverfix local branch and
push it to update the remote&rsquo;s serverfix branch.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll go over the refs/heads/ part in detail in Git
<p>88</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>Internals, but you can generally leave it off. You can also do git push origin serverfix:serverfix,
which does the same thing&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it says, &ldquo;Take my serverfix and make it the remote&rsquo;s serverfix.&rdquo; You
can use this format to push a local branch into a remote branch that is named differently. If you
didn&rsquo;t want it to be called serverfix on the remote, you could instead run git push origin
serverfix:awesomebranch to push your local serverfix branch to the awesomebranch branch on the
remote project.
<p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t type your password every time
<p>If you&rsquo;re using an HTTPS URL to push over, the Git server will ask you for your
username and password for authentication. By default it will prompt you on the
terminal for this information so the server can tell if you&rsquo;re allowed to push.
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to type it every single time you push, you can set up a &ldquo;credential
cache&rdquo;. The simplest is just to keep it in memory for a few minutes, which you can
easily set up by running git config --global credential.helper cache.
<p>For more information on the various credential caching options available, see
Credential Storage.
<p>The next time one of your collaborators fetches from the server, they will get a reference to where
the server&rsquo;s version of serverfix is under the remote branch origin/serverfix:
<p>$ git fetch origin
remote: Counting objects: 7, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

&nbsp;* [new branch] serverfix -&gt; origin/serverfix
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that when you do a fetch that brings down new remote-tracking branches,
you don&rsquo;t automatically have local, editable copies of them. In other words, in this case, you don&rsquo;t
have a new serverfix branch&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you have only an origin/serverfix pointer that you can&rsquo;t modify.
<p>To merge this work into your current working branch, you can run git merge origin/serverfix. If
you want your own serverfix branch that you can work on, you can base it off your remote-
tracking branch:
<p>$ git checkout -b serverfix origin/serverfix
Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.

<p>This gives you a local branch that you can work on that starts where origin/serverfix is.
<p>Tracking Branches
<p>Checking out a local branch from a remote-tracking branch automatically creates what is called a
<p>89</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>&ldquo;tracking branch&rdquo; (and the branch it tracks is called an &ldquo;upstream branch&rdquo;). Tracking branches are
local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch. If you&rsquo;re on a tracking branch
and type git pull, Git automatically knows which server to fetch from and which branch to merge
in.
<p>When you clone a repository, it generally automatically creates a master branch that tracks
origin/master. However, you can set up other tracking branches if you wish&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;ones that track
branches on other remotes, or don&rsquo;t track the master branch. The simple case is the example you
just saw, running git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;. This is a common enough operation
that Git provides the --track shorthand:
<p>$ git checkout --track origin/serverfix
Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'serverfix'
<p>In fact, this is so common that there&rsquo;s even a shortcut for that shortcut. If the branch name you&rsquo;re
trying to checkout (a) doesn&rsquo;t exist and (b) exactly matches a name on only one remote, Git will
create a tracking branch for you:
<p>$ git checkout serverfix
Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'serverfix'
<p>To set up a local branch with a different name than the remote branch, you can easily use the first
version with a different local branch name:
<p>$ git checkout -b sf origin/serverfix
Branch sf set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'sf'
<p>Now, your local branch sf will automatically pull from origin/serverfix.
<p>If you already have a local branch and want to set it to a remote branch you just pulled down, or
want to change the upstream branch you&rsquo;re tracking, you can use the -u or --set-upstream-to
option to git branch to explicitly set it at any time.
<p>$ git branch -u origin/serverfix
Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.
<p>
<p>Upstream shorthand
<p>When you have a tracking branch set up, you can reference its upstream branch
with the @{upstream} or @{u} shorthand. So if you&rsquo;re on the master branch and it&rsquo;s
tracking origin/master, you can say something like git merge @{u} instead of git
merge origin/master if you wish.
<p>90</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>If you want to see what tracking branches you have set up, you can use the -vv option to git branch.
This will list out your local branches with more information including what each branch is tracking
and if your local branch is ahead, behind or both.
<p>$ git branch -vv
&nbsp; iss53 7e424c3 [origin/iss53: ahead 2] Add forgotten brackets
&nbsp; master 1ae2a45 [origin/master] Deploy index fix
* serverfix f8674d9 [teamone/server-fix-good: ahead 3, behind 1] This should do it
&nbsp; testing 5ea463a Try something new
<p>So here we can see that our iss53 branch is tracking origin/iss53 and is &ldquo;ahead&rdquo; by two, meaning
that we have two commits locally that are not pushed to the server. We can also see that our master
branch is tracking origin/master and is up to date. Next we can see that our serverfix branch is
tracking the server-fix-good branch on our teamone server and is ahead by three and behind by one,
meaning that there is one commit on the server we haven&rsquo;t merged in yet and three commits
locally that we haven&rsquo;t pushed. Finally we can see that our testing branch is not tracking any
remote branch.
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that these numbers are only since the last time you fetched from each server.
This command does not reach out to the servers, it&rsquo;s telling you about what it has cached from these
servers locally. If you want totally up to date ahead and behind numbers, you&rsquo;ll need to fetch from
all your remotes right before running this. You could do that like this:
<p>$ git fetch --all; git branch -vv
<p>Pulling
<p>While the git fetch command will fetch all the changes on the server that you don&rsquo;t have yet, it will
not modify your working directory at all. It will simply get the data for you and let you merge it
yourself. However, there is a command called git pull which is essentially a git fetch immediately
followed by a git merge in most cases. If you have a tracking branch set up as demonstrated in the
last section, either by explicitly setting it or by having it created for you by the clone or checkout
commands, git pull will look up what server and branch your current branch is tracking, fetch
from that server and then try to merge in that remote branch.
<p>Generally it&rsquo;s better to simply use the fetch and merge commands explicitly as the magic of git pull
can often be confusing.
<p>Deleting Remote Branches
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re done with a remote branch&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;say you and your collaborators are finished with a
feature and have merged it into your remote&rsquo;s master branch (or whatever branch your stable
codeline is in). You can delete a remote branch using the --delete option to git push. If you want to
delete your serverfix branch from the server, you run the following:
<p>91</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git push origin --delete serverfix
To https://github.com/schacon/simplegit
&nbsp;- [deleted] serverfix
<p>Basically all this does is remove the pointer from the server. The Git server will generally keep the
data there for a while until a garbage collection runs, so if it was accidentally deleted, it&rsquo;s often easy
to recover.
<p>Rebasing
In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: the merge and
the rebase. In this section you&rsquo;ll learn what rebasing is, how to do it, why it&rsquo;s a pretty amazing tool,
and in what cases you won&rsquo;t want to use it.
<p>The Basic Rebase
<p>If you go back to an earlier example from Basic Merging, you can see that you diverged your work
and made commits on two different branches.
<p>Figure 35. Simple divergent history
<p>The easiest way to integrate the branches, as we&rsquo;ve already covered, is the merge command. It
performs a three-way merge between the two latest branch snapshots (C3 and C4) and the most
recent common ancestor of the two (C2), creating a new snapshot (and commit).
<p>92</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 36. Merging to integrate diverged work history
<p>However, there is another way: you can take the patch of the change that was introduced in C4 and
reapply it on top of C3. In Git, this is called rebasing. With the rebase command, you can take all the
changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on a different branch.
<p>For this example, you would check out the experiment branch, and then rebase it onto the master
branch as follows:
<p>$ git checkout experiment
$ git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: added staged command
<p>This operation works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you&rsquo;re on and
the one you&rsquo;re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you&rsquo;re on,
saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch
you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn.
<p>Figure 37. Rebasing the change introduced in C4 onto C3
<p>At this point, you can go back to the master branch and do a fast-forward merge.
<p>$ git checkout master
$ git merge experiment
<p>93</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 38. Fast-forwarding the master branch
<p>Now, the snapshot pointed to by C4' is exactly the same as the one that was pointed to by C5 in the
merge example. There is no difference in the end product of the integration, but rebasing makes for
a cleaner history. If you examine the log of a rebased branch, it looks like a linear history: it
appears that all the work happened in series, even when it originally happened in parallel.
<p>Often, you&rsquo;ll do this to make sure your commits apply cleanly on a remote branch&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;perhaps in a
project to which you&rsquo;re trying to contribute but that you don&rsquo;t maintain. In this case, you&rsquo;d do your
work in a branch and then rebase your work onto origin/master when you were ready to submit
your patches to the main project. That way, the maintainer doesn&rsquo;t have to do any integration
work&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;just a fast-forward or a clean apply.
<p>Note that the snapshot pointed to by the final commit you end up with, whether it&rsquo;s the last of the
rebased commits for a rebase or the final merge commit after a merge, is the same snapshot&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s
only the history that is different. Rebasing replays changes from one line of work onto another in
the order they were introduced, whereas merging takes the endpoints and merges them together.
<p>More Interesting Rebases
<p>You can also have your rebase replay on something other than the rebase target branch. Take a
history like A history with a topic branch off another topic branch, for example. You branched a
topic branch (server) to add some server-side functionality to your project, and made a commit.
Then, you branched off that to make the client-side changes (client) and committed a few times.
Finally, you went back to your server branch and did a few more commits.
<p>94</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 39. A history with a topic branch off another topic branch
<p>Suppose you decide that you want to merge your client-side changes into your mainline for a
release, but you want to hold off on the server-side changes until it&rsquo;s tested further. You can take
the changes on client that aren&rsquo;t on server (C8 and C9) and replay them on your master branch by
using the --onto option of git rebase:
<p>$ git rebase --onto master server client
<p>This basically says, &ldquo;Take the client branch, figure out the patches since it diverged from the server
branch, and replay these patches in the client branch as if it was based directly off the master
branch instead.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a bit complex, but the result is pretty cool.
<p>Figure 40. Rebasing a topic branch off another topic branch
<p>Now you can fast-forward your master branch (see Fast-forwarding your master branch to include
the client branch changes):
<p>95</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git checkout master
$ git merge client
<p>Figure 41. Fast-forwarding your master branch to include the client branch changes
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you decide to pull in your server branch as well. You can rebase the server branch onto
the master branch without having to check it out first by running git rebase &lt;basebranch&gt;
&lt;topicbranch&gt;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;which checks out the topic branch (in this case, server) for you and replays it onto
the base branch (master):
<p>$ git rebase master server
<p>This replays your server work on top of your master work, as shown in Rebasing your server branch
on top of your master branch.
<p>Figure 42. Rebasing your server branch on top of your master branch
<p>Then, you can fast-forward the base branch (master):
<p>$ git checkout master
$ git merge server
<p>You can remove the client and server branches because all the work is integrated and you don&rsquo;t
need them anymore, leaving your history for this entire process looking like Final commit history:
<p>$ git branch -d client
$ git branch -d server
<p>96</p>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 43. Final commit history
<p>The Perils of Rebasing
<p>Ahh, but the bliss of rebasing isn&rsquo;t without its drawbacks, which can be summed up in a single line:
<p>Do not rebase commits that exist outside your repository and that people may have based
work on.
<p>If you follow that guideline, you&rsquo;ll be fine. If you don&rsquo;t, people will hate you, and you&rsquo;ll be scorned
by friends and family.
<p>When you rebase stuff, you&rsquo;re abandoning existing commits and creating new ones that are similar
but different. If you push commits somewhere and others pull them down and base work on them,
and then you rewrite those commits with git rebase and push them up again, your collaborators
will have to re-merge their work and things will get messy when you try to pull their work back
into yours.
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of how rebasing work that you&rsquo;ve made public can cause problems.
Suppose you clone from a central server and then do some work off that. Your commit history looks
like this:
<p>Figure 44. Clone a repository, and base some work on it
<p>Now, someone else does more work that includes a merge, and pushes that work to the central
server. You fetch it and merge the new remote branch into your work, making your history look
something like this:
<p>97</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 45. Fetch more commits, and merge them into your work
<p>Next, the person who pushed the merged work decides to go back and rebase their work instead;
they do a git push --force to overwrite the history on the server. You then fetch from that server,
bringing down the new commits.
<p>Figure 46. Someone pushes rebased commits, abandoning commits you&rsquo;ve based your work on
<p>98</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re both in a pickle. If you do a git pull, you&rsquo;ll create a merge commit which includes both
lines of history, and your repository will look like this:
<p>Figure 47. You merge in the same work again into a new merge commit
<p>If you run a git log when your history looks like this, you&rsquo;ll see two commits that have the same
author, date, and message, which will be confusing. Furthermore, if you push this history back up
to the server, you&rsquo;ll reintroduce all those rebased commits to the central server, which can further
confuse people. It&rsquo;s pretty safe to assume that the other developer doesn&rsquo;t want C4 and C6 to be in
the history; that&rsquo;s why they rebased in the first place.
<p>Rebase When You Rebase
<p>If you do find yourself in a situation like this, Git has some further magic that might help you out. If
someone on your team force pushes changes that overwrite work that you&rsquo;ve based work on, your
challenge is to figure out what is yours and what they&rsquo;ve rewritten.
<p>It turns out that in addition to the commit SHA-1 checksum, Git also calculates a checksum that is
based just on the patch introduced with the commit. This is called a &ldquo;patch-id&rdquo;.
<p>If you pull down work that was rewritten and rebase it on top of the new commits from your
partner, Git can often successfully figure out what is uniquely yours and apply them back on top of
the new branch.
<p>For instance, in the previous scenario, if instead of doing a merge when we&rsquo;re at Someone pushes
rebased commits, abandoning commits you&rsquo;ve based your work on we run git rebase
teamone/master, Git will:
<p>&bull; Determine what work is unique to our branch (C2, C3, C4, C6, C7)
<p>&bull; Determine which are not merge commits (C2, C3, C4)
<p>&bull; Determine which have not been rewritten into the target branch (just C2 and C3, since C4 is the
same patch as C4')
<p>99</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>&bull; Apply those commits to the top of teamone/master
<p>So instead of the result we see in You merge in the same work again into a new merge commit, we
would end up with something more like Rebase on top of force-pushed rebase work..
<p>Figure 48. Rebase on top of force-pushed rebase work.
<p>This only works if C4 and C4' that your partner made are almost exactly the same patch. Otherwise
the rebase won&rsquo;t be able to tell that it&rsquo;s a duplicate and will add another C4-like patch (which will
probably fail to apply cleanly, since the changes would already be at least somewhat there).
<p>You can also simplify this by running a git pull --rebase instead of a normal git pull. Or you
could do it manually with a git fetch followed by a git rebase teamone/master in this case.
<p>If you are using git pull and want to make --rebase the default, you can set the pull.rebase config
value with something like git config --global pull.rebase true.
<p>If you only ever rebase commits that have never left your own computer, you&rsquo;ll be just fine. If you
rebase commits that have been pushed, but that no one else has based commits from, you&rsquo;ll also be
fine. If you rebase commits that have already been pushed publicly, and people may have based
work on those commits, then you may be in for some frustrating trouble, and the scorn of your
teammates.
<p>If you or a partner does find it necessary at some point, make sure everyone knows to run git pull
--rebase to try to make the pain after it happens a little bit simpler.
<p>Rebase vs. Merge
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve seen rebasing and merging in action, you may be wondering which one is better.
Before we can answer this, let&rsquo;s step back a bit and talk about what history means.
<p>One point of view on this is that your repository&rsquo;s commit history is a record of what actually
happened. It&rsquo;s a historical document, valuable in its own right, and shouldn&rsquo;t be tampered with.
<p>100</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>From this angle, changing the commit history is almost blasphemous; you&rsquo;re lying about what
actually transpired. So what if there was a messy series of merge commits? That&rsquo;s how it happened,
and the repository should preserve that for posterity.
<p>The opposing point of view is that the commit history is the story of how your project was made.
You wouldn&rsquo;t publish the first draft of a book, and the manual for how to maintain your software
deserves careful editing. This is the camp that uses tools like rebase and filter-branch to tell the
story in the way that&rsquo;s best for future readers.
<p>Now, to the question of whether merging or rebasing is better: hopefully you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s not that
simple. Git is a powerful tool, and allows you to do many things to and with your history, but every
team and every project is different. Now that you know how both of these things work, it&rsquo;s up to
you to decide which one is best for your particular situation.
<p>In general the way to get the best of both worlds is to rebase local changes you&rsquo;ve made but haven&rsquo;t
shared yet before you push them in order to clean up your story, but never rebase anything you&rsquo;ve
pushed somewhere.
<p>Summary
We&rsquo;ve covered basic branching and merging in Git. You should feel comfortable creating and
switching to new branches, switching between branches and merging local branches together. You
should also be able to share your branches by pushing them to a shared server, working with
others on shared branches and rebasing your branches before they are shared. Next, we&rsquo;ll cover
what you&rsquo;ll need to run your own Git repository-hosting server.
<p>101</p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Git on the Server
At this point, you should be able to do most of the day-to-day tasks for which you&rsquo;ll be using Git.
However, in order to do any collaboration in Git, you&rsquo;ll need to have a remote Git repository.
Although you can technically push changes to and pull changes from individuals' repositories,
doing so is discouraged because you can fairly easily confuse what they&rsquo;re working on if you&rsquo;re not
careful. Furthermore, you want your collaborators to be able to access the repository even if your
computer is offline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;having a more reliable common repository is often useful. Therefore, the
preferred method for collaborating with someone is to set up an intermediate repository that you
both have access to, and push to and pull from that.
<p>Running a Git server is fairly straightforward. First, you choose which protocols you want your
server to support. The first section of this chapter will cover the available protocols and the pros
and cons of each. The next sections will explain some typical setups using those protocols and how
to get your server running with them. Last, we&rsquo;ll go over a few hosted options, if you don&rsquo;t mind
hosting your code on someone else&rsquo;s server and don&rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of setting up
and maintaining your own server.
<p>If you have no interest in running your own server, you can skip to the last section of the chapter to
see some options for setting up a hosted account and then move on to the next chapter, where we
discuss the various ins and outs of working in a distributed source control environment.
<p>A remote repository is generally a bare repository&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a Git repository that has no working directory.
Because the repository is only used as a collaboration point, there is no reason to have a snapshot
checked out on disk; it&rsquo;s just the Git data. In the simplest terms, a bare repository is the contents of
your project&rsquo;s .git directory and nothing else.
<p>The Protocols
Git can use four distinct protocols to transfer data: Local, HTTP, Secure Shell (SSH) and Git. Here
we&rsquo;ll discuss what they are and in what basic circumstances you would want (or not want) to use
them.
<p>Local Protocol
<p>The most basic is the Local protocol, in which the remote repository is in another directory on the
same host. This is often used if everyone on your team has access to a shared filesystem such as an
NFS mount, or in the less likely case that everyone logs in to the same computer. The latter wouldn&rsquo;t
be ideal, because all your code repository instances would reside on the same computer, making a
catastrophic loss much more likely.
<p>If you have a shared mounted filesystem, then you can clone, push to, and pull from a local file-
based repository. To clone a repository like this, or to add one as a remote to an existing project, use
the path to the repository as the URL. For example, to clone a local repository, you can run
something like this:
<p>$ git clone /srv/git/project.git
<p>102</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Or you can do this:
<p>$ git clone file:///srv/git/project.git
<p>Git operates slightly differently if you explicitly specify file:// at the beginning of the URL. If you
just specify the path, Git tries to use hardlinks or directly copy the files it needs. If you specify
file://, Git fires up the processes that it normally uses to transfer data over a network, which is
generally much less efficient. The main reason to specify the file:// prefix is if you want a clean
copy of the repository with extraneous references or objects left out&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;generally after an import
from another VCS or something similar (see Git Internals for maintenance tasks). We&rsquo;ll use the
normal path here because doing so is almost always faster.
<p>To add a local repository to an existing Git project, you can run something like this:
<p>$ git remote add local_proj /srv/git/project.git
<p>Then, you can push to and pull from that remote via your new remote name local_proj as though
you were doing so over a network.
<p>The Pros
<p>The pros of file-based repositories are that they&rsquo;re simple and they use existing file permissions and
network access. If you already have a shared filesystem to which your whole team has access,
setting up a repository is very easy. You stick the bare repository copy somewhere everyone has
shared access to and set the read/write permissions as you would for any other shared directory.
We&rsquo;ll discuss how to export a bare repository copy for this purpose in Getting Git on a Server.
<p>This is also a nice option for quickly grabbing work from someone else&rsquo;s working repository. If you
and a co-worker are working on the same project and they want you to check something out,
running a command like git pull /home/john/project is often easier than them pushing to a remote
server and you subsequently fetching from it.
<p>The Cons
<p>The cons of this method are that shared access is generally more difficult to set up and reach from
multiple locations than basic network access. If you want to push from your laptop when you&rsquo;re at
home, you have to mount the remote disk, which can be difficult and slow compared to network-
based access.
<p>It&rsquo;s important to mention that this isn&rsquo;t necessarily the fastest option if you&rsquo;re using a shared mount
of some kind. A local repository is fast only if you have fast access to the data. A repository on NFS
is often slower than the repository over SSH on the same server, allowing Git to run off local disks
on each system.
<p>Finally, this protocol does not protect the repository against accidental damage. Every user has full
shell access to the &ldquo;remote&rdquo; directory, and there is nothing preventing them from changing or
removing internal Git files and corrupting the repository.

<br>
<p>The HTTP Protocols
<p>Git can communicate over HTTP using two different modes. Prior to Git 1.6.6, there was only one
way it could do this which was very simple and generally read-only. In version 1.6.6, a new, smarter
protocol was introduced that involved Git being able to intelligently negotiate data transfer in a
manner similar to how it does over SSH. In the last few years, this new HTTP protocol has become
very popular since it&rsquo;s simpler for the user and smarter about how it communicates. The newer
version is often referred to as the Smart HTTP protocol and the older way as Dumb HTTP. We&rsquo;ll
cover the newer Smart HTTP protocol first.
<p>Smart HTTP
<p>Smart HTTP operates very similarly to the SSH or Git protocols but runs over standard HTTPS ports
and can use various HTTP authentication mechanisms, meaning it&rsquo;s often easier on the user than
something like SSH, since you can use things like username/password authentication rather than
having to set up SSH keys.
<p>It has probably become the most popular way to use Git now, since it can be set up to both serve
anonymously like the git:// protocol, and can also be pushed over with authentication and
encryption like the SSH protocol. Instead of having to set up different URLs for these things, you can
now use a single URL for both. If you try to push and the repository requires authentication (which
it normally should), the server can prompt for a username and password. The same goes for read
access.
<p>In fact, for services like GitHub, the URL you use to view the repository online (for example,
https://github.com/schacon/simplegit) is the same URL you can use to clone and, if you have access,
push over.
<p>Dumb HTTP
<p>If the server does not respond with a Git HTTP smart service, the Git client will try to fall back to the
simpler Dumb HTTP protocol. The Dumb protocol expects the bare Git repository to be served like
normal files from the web server. The beauty of Dumb HTTP is the simplicity of setting it up.
Basically, all you have to do is put a bare Git repository under your HTTP document root and set up
a specific post-update hook, and you&rsquo;re done (See Git Hooks). At that point, anyone who can access
the web server under which you put the repository can also clone your repository. To allow read
access to your repository over HTTP, do something like this:
<p>$ cd /var/www/htdocs/
$ git clone --bare /path/to/git_project gitproject.git
$ cd gitproject.git
$ mv hooks/post-update.sample hooks/post-update
$ chmod a+x hooks/post-update
<p>That&rsquo;s all. The post-update hook that comes with Git by default runs the appropriate command (git
update-server-info) to make HTTP fetching and cloning work properly. This command is run when
you push to this repository (over SSH perhaps); then, other people can clone via something like
<p>104</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://github.com/schacon/simplegit">https://github.com/schacon/simplegit</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git clone https://example.com/gitproject.git
<p>In this particular case, we&rsquo;re using the /var/www/htdocs path that is common for Apache setups, but
you can use any static web server&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;just put the bare repository in its path. The Git data is served as
basic static files (see the Git Internals chapter for details about exactly how it&rsquo;s served).
<p>Generally you would either choose to run a read/write Smart HTTP server or simply have the files
accessible as read-only in the Dumb manner. It&rsquo;s rare to run a mix of the two services.
<p>The Pros
<p>We&rsquo;ll concentrate on the pros of the Smart version of the HTTP protocol.
<p>The simplicity of having a single URL for all types of access and having the server prompt only
when authentication is needed makes things very easy for the end user. Being able to authenticate
with a username and password is also a big advantage over SSH, since users don&rsquo;t have to generate
SSH keys locally and upload their public key to the server before being able to interact with it. For
less sophisticated users, or users on systems where SSH is less common, this is a major advantage in
usability. It is also a very fast and efficient protocol, similar to the SSH one.
<p>You can also serve your repositories read-only over HTTPS, which means you can encrypt the
content transfer; or you can go so far as to make the clients use specific signed SSL certificates.
<p>Another nice thing is that HTTP and HTTPS are such commonly used protocols that corporate
firewalls are often set up to allow traffic through their ports.
<p>The Cons
<p>Git over HTTPS can be a little more tricky to set up compared to SSH on some servers. Other than
that, there is very little advantage that other protocols have over Smart HTTP for serving Git
content.
<p>If you&rsquo;re using HTTP for authenticated pushing, providing your credentials is sometimes more
complicated than using keys over SSH. There are, however, several credential caching tools you can
use, including Keychain access on macOS and Credential Manager on Windows, to make this pretty
painless. Read Credential Storage to see how to set up secure HTTP password caching on your
system.
<p>The SSH Protocol
<p>A common transport protocol for Git when self-hosting is over SSH. This is because SSH access to
servers is already set up in most places&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and if it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s easy to do. SSH is also an authenticated
network protocol and, because it&rsquo;s ubiquitous, it&rsquo;s generally easy to set up and use.
<p>To clone a Git repository over SSH, you can specify an ssh:// URL like this:
<p>$ git clone ssh://[user@]server/project.git
<p>105</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Or you can use the shorter scp-like syntax for the SSH protocol:
<p>$ git clone [user@]server:project.git
<p>In both cases above, if you don&rsquo;t specify the optional username, Git assumes the user you&rsquo;re
currently logged in as.
<p>The Pros
<p>The pros of using SSH are many. First, SSH is relatively easy to set up&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;SSH daemons are
commonplace, many network admins have experience with them, and many OS distributions are
set up with them or have tools to manage them. Next, access over SSH is secure&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;all data transfer
is encrypted and authenticated. Last, like the HTTPS, Git and Local protocols, SSH is efficient,
making the data as compact as possible before transferring it.
<p>The Cons
<p>The negative aspect of SSH is that it doesn&rsquo;t support anonymous access to your Git repository. If
you&rsquo;re using SSH, people must have SSH access to your machine, even in a read-only capacity,
which doesn&rsquo;t make SSH conducive to open source projects for which people might simply want to
clone your repository to examine it. If you&rsquo;re using it only within your corporate network, SSH may
be the only protocol you need to deal with. If you want to allow anonymous read-only access to
your projects and also want to use SSH, you&rsquo;ll have to set up SSH for you to push over but
something else for others to fetch from.
<p>The Git Protocol
<p>Finally, we have the Git protocol. This is a special daemon that comes packaged with Git; it listens
on a dedicated port (9418) that provides a service similar to the SSH protocol, but with absolutely
no authentication. In order for a repository to be served over the Git protocol, you must create a
git-daemon-export-ok file&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the daemon won&rsquo;t serve a repository without that file in it&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but, other
than that, there is no security. Either the Git repository is available for everyone to clone, or it isn&rsquo;t.
This means that there is generally no pushing over this protocol. You can enable push access but,
given the lack of authentication, anyone on the internet who finds your project&rsquo;s URL could push to
that project. Suffice it to say that this is rare.
<p>The Pros
<p>The Git protocol is often the fastest network transfer protocol available. If you&rsquo;re serving a lot of
traffic for a public project or serving a very large project that doesn&rsquo;t require user authentication
for read access, it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;ll want to set up a Git daemon to serve your project. It uses the
same data-transfer mechanism as the SSH protocol but without the encryption and authentication
overhead.
<p>The Cons
<p>The downside of the Git protocol is the lack of authentication. It&rsquo;s generally undesirable for the Git
protocol to be the only access to your project. Generally, you&rsquo;ll pair it with SSH or HTTPS access for
<p>106</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>the few developers who have push (write) access and have everyone else use git:// for read-only
access. It&rsquo;s also probably the most difficult protocol to set up. It must run its own daemon, which
requires xinetd or systemd configuration or the like, which isn&rsquo;t always a walk in the park. It also
requires firewall access to port 9418, which isn&rsquo;t a standard port that corporate firewalls always
allow. Behind big corporate firewalls, this obscure port is commonly blocked.
<p>Getting Git on a Server
Now we&rsquo;ll cover setting up a Git service running these protocols on your own server.
<p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;ll be demonstrating the commands and steps needed to do basic,
simplified installations on a Linux-based server, though it&rsquo;s also possible to run
these services on macOS or Windows servers. Actually setting up a production
server within your infrastructure will certainly entail differences in security
measures or operating system tools, but hopefully this will give you the general
idea of what&rsquo;s involved.
<p>In order to initially set up any Git server, you have to export an existing repository into a new bare
repository&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a repository that doesn&rsquo;t contain a working directory. This is generally
straightforward to do. In order to clone your repository to create a new bare repository, you run the
clone command with the --bare option. By convention, bare repository directory names end with
the suffix .git, like so:
<p>$ git clone --bare my_project my_project.git
Cloning into bare repository 'my_project.git'...
done.
<p>You should now have a copy of the Git directory data in your my_project.git directory.
<p>This is roughly equivalent to something like
<p>$ cp -Rf my_project/.git my_project.git
<p>There are a couple of minor differences in the configuration file but, for your purpose, this is close
to the same thing. It takes the Git repository by itself, without a working directory, and creates a
directory specifically for it alone.
<p>Putting the Bare Repository on a Server
<p>Now that you have a bare copy of your repository, all you need to do is put it on a server and set up
your protocols. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve set up a server called git.example.com to which you have SSH
access, and you want to store all your Git repositories under the /srv/git directory. Assuming that
/srv/git exists on that server, you can set up your new repository by copying your bare repository
over:
<p>107</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ scp -r my_project.git user@git.example.com:/srv/git
<p>At this point, other users who have SSH-based read access to the /srv/git directory on that server
can clone your repository by running
<p>$ git clone user@git.example.com:/srv/git/my_project.git
<p>If a user SSHs into a server and has write access to the /srv/git/my_project.git directory, they will
also automatically have push access.
<p>Git will automatically add group write permissions to a repository properly if you run the git init
command with the --shared option. Note that by running this command, you will not destroy any
commits, refs, etc. in the process.
<p>$ ssh user@git.example.com
$ cd /srv/git/my_project.git
$ git init --bare --shared
<p>You see how easy it is to take a Git repository, create a bare version, and place it on a server to
which you and your collaborators have SSH access. Now you&rsquo;re ready to collaborate on the same
project.
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that this is literally all you need to do to run a useful Git server to which
several people have access&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;just add SSH-able accounts on a server, and stick a bare repository
somewhere that all those users have read and write access to. You&rsquo;re ready to go&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;nothing else
needed.
<p>In the next few sections, you&rsquo;ll see how to expand to more sophisticated setups. This discussion will
include not having to create user accounts for each user, adding public read access to repositories,
setting up web UIs and more. However, keep in mind that to collaborate with a couple of people on
a private project, all you need is an SSH server and a bare repository.
<p>Small Setups
<p>If you&rsquo;re a small outfit or are just trying out Git in your organization and have only a few
developers, things can be simple for you. One of the most complicated aspects of setting up a Git
server is user management. If you want some repositories to be read-only for certain users and
read/write for others, access and permissions can be a bit more difficult to arrange.
<p>SSH Access
<p>If you have a server to which all your developers already have SSH access, it&rsquo;s generally easiest to
set up your first repository there, because you have to do almost no work (as we covered in the last
section). If you want more complex access control type permissions on your repositories, you can
handle them with the normal filesystem permissions of your server&rsquo;s operating system.
<p>108</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>If you want to place your repositories on a server that doesn&rsquo;t have accounts for everyone on your
team for whom you want to grant write access, then you must set up SSH access for them. We
assume that if you have a server with which to do this, you already have an SSH server installed,
and that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re accessing the server.
<p>There are a few ways you can give access to everyone on your team. The first is to set up accounts
for everybody, which is straightforward but can be cumbersome. You may not want to run adduser
(or the possible alternative useradd) and have to set temporary passwords for every new user.
<p>A second method is to create a single git user account on the machine, ask every user who is to
have write access to send you an SSH public key, and add that key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file
of that new git account. At that point, everyone will be able to access that machine via the git
account. This doesn&rsquo;t affect the commit data in any way&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the SSH user you connect as doesn&rsquo;t
affect the commits you&rsquo;ve recorded.
<p>Another way to do it is to have your SSH server authenticate from an LDAP server or some other
centralized authentication source that you may already have set up. As long as each user can get
shell access on the machine, any SSH authentication mechanism you can think of should work.
<p>Generating Your SSH Public Key
Many Git servers authenticate using SSH public keys. In order to provide a public key, each user in
your system must generate one if they don&rsquo;t already have one. This process is similar across all
operating systems. First, you should check to make sure you don&rsquo;t already have a key. By default, a
user&rsquo;s SSH keys are stored in that user&rsquo;s ~/.ssh directory. You can easily check to see if you have a
key already by going to that directory and listing the contents:
<p>$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
authorized_keys2 id_dsa known_hosts
config id_dsa.pub
<p>You&rsquo;re looking for a pair of files named something like id_dsa or id_rsa and a matching file with a
.pub extension. The .pub file is your public key, and the other file is the corresponding private key. If
you don&rsquo;t have these files (or you don&rsquo;t even have a .ssh directory), you can create them by running
a program called ssh-keygen, which is provided with the SSH package on Linux/macOS systems and
comes with Git for Windows:
<p>109</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ ssh-keygen -o
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/schacon/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
d0:82:24:8e:d7:f1:bb:9b:33:53:96:93:49:da:9b:e3 schacon@mylaptop.local
<p>First it confirms where you want to save the key (.ssh/id_rsa), and then it asks twice for a
passphrase, which you can leave empty if you don&rsquo;t want to type a password when you use the key.
However, if you do use a password, make sure to add the -o option; it saves the private key in a
format that is more resistant to brute-force password cracking than is the default format. You can
also use the ssh-agent tool to prevent having to enter the password each time.
<p>Now, each user that does this has to send their public key to you or whoever is administrating the
Git server (assuming you&rsquo;re using an SSH server setup that requires public keys). All they have to
do is copy the contents of the .pub file and email it. The public keys look something like this:
<p>$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAklOUpkDHrfHY17SbrmTIpNLTGK9Tjom/BWDSU

<p>For a more in-depth tutorial on creating an SSH key on multiple operating systems, see the GitHub
guide on SSH keys at https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys.
<p>Setting Up the Server
Let&rsquo;s walk through setting up SSH access on the server side. In this example, you&rsquo;ll use the
authorized_keys method for authenticating your users. We also assume you&rsquo;re running a standard
Linux distribution like Ubuntu.
<p>
A good deal of what is described here can be automated by using the ssh-copy-id
command, rather than manually copying and installing public keys.
<p>First, you create a git user account and a .ssh directory for that user.
<p>110</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ sudo adduser git
$ su git
$ cd
$ mkdir .ssh &amp;&amp; chmod 700 .ssh
$ touch .ssh/authorized_keys &amp;&amp; chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
<p>Next, you need to add some developer SSH public keys to the authorized_keys file for the git user.
Let&rsquo;s assume you have some trusted public keys and have saved them to temporary files. Again, the
public keys look something like this:
<p>$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCB007n/ww+ouN4gSLKssMxXnBOvf9LGt4L
ojG6rs6hPB09j9R/T17/x4lhJA0F3FR1rP6kYBRsWj2aThGw6HXLm9/5zytK6Ztg3RPKK+4k

dAv8JggJICUvax2T9va5 gsg-keypair
<p>You just append them to the git user&rsquo;s authorized_keys file in its .ssh directory:
<p>$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.josie.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.jessica.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
<p>Now, you can set up an empty repository for them by running git init with the --bare option,
which initializes the repository without a working directory:
<p>$ cd /srv/git
$ mkdir project.git
$ cd project.git
$ git init --bare
Initialized empty Git repository in /srv/git/project.git/
<p>Then, John, Josie, or Jessica can push the first version of their project into that repository by adding
it as a remote and pushing up a branch. Note that someone must shell onto the machine and create
a bare repository every time you want to add a project. Let&rsquo;s use gitserver as the hostname of the
server on which you&rsquo;ve set up your git user and repository. If you&rsquo;re running it internally, and you
set up DNS for gitserver to point to that server, then you can use the commands pretty much as is
(assuming that myproject is an existing project with files in it):
<p>111</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p># on John's computer
$ cd myproject
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git remote add origin git@gitserver:/srv/git/project.git
$ git push origin master
<p>At this point, the others can clone it down and push changes back up just as easily:
<p>$ git clone git@gitserver:/srv/git/project.git
$ cd project
$ vim README
$ git commit -am 'Fix for README file'
$ git push origin master
<p>With this method, you can quickly get a read/write Git server up and running for a handful of
developers.
<p>You should note that currently all these users can also log into the server and get a shell as the git
user. If you want to restrict that, you will have to change the shell to something else in the
/etc/passwd file.
<p>You can easily restrict the git user account to only Git-related activities with a limited shell tool
called git-shell that comes with Git. If you set this as the git user account&rsquo;s login shell, then that
account can&rsquo;t have normal shell access to your server. To use this, specify git-shell instead of bash
or csh for that account&rsquo;s login shell. To do so, you must first add the full pathname of the git-shell
command to /etc/shells if it&rsquo;s not already there:
<p>$ cat /etc/shells # see if git-shell is already in there. If not...
$ which git-shell # make sure git-shell is installed on your system.
$ sudo -e /etc/shells # and add the path to git-shell from last command
<p>Now you can edit the shell for a user using chsh &lt;username&gt; -s &lt;shell&gt;:
<p>$ sudo chsh git -s $(which git-shell)
<p>Now, the git user can still use the SSH connection to push and pull Git repositories but can&rsquo;t shell
onto the machine. If you try, you&rsquo;ll see a login rejection like this:
<p>$ ssh git@gitserver
fatal: Interactive git shell is not enabled.
hint: ~/git-shell-commands should exist and have read and execute access.
Connection to gitserver closed.
<p>112</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>At this point, users are still able to use SSH port forwarding to access any host the git server is able
to reach. If you want to prevent that, you can edit the authorized_keys file and prepend the
following options to each key you&rsquo;d like to restrict:
<p>no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty
<p>The result should look like this:
<p>$ cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa
AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCB007n/ww+ouN4gSLKssMxXnBOvf9LGt4LojG6rs6h

AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDEwENNMomTboYI+LJieaAY16qiXiH3wuvENhBG...
<p>Now Git network commands will still work just fine but the users won&rsquo;t be able to get a shell. As the
output states, you can also set up a directory in the git user&rsquo;s home directory that customizes the
git-shell command a bit. For instance, you can restrict the Git commands that the server will
accept or you can customize the message that users see if they try to SSH in like that. Run git help
shell for more information on customizing the shell.
<p>Git Daemon
Next we&rsquo;ll set up a daemon serving repositories using the &ldquo;Git&rdquo; protocol. This is a common choice
for fast, unauthenticated access to your Git data. Remember that since this is not an authenticated
service, anything you serve over this protocol is public within its network.
<p>If you&rsquo;re running this on a server outside your firewall, it should be used only for projects that are
publicly visible to the world. If the server you&rsquo;re running it on is inside your firewall, you might use
it for projects that a large number of people or computers (continuous integration or build servers)
have read-only access to, when you don&rsquo;t want to have to add an SSH key for each.
<p>In any case, the Git protocol is relatively easy to set up. Basically, you need to run this command in
a daemonized manner:
<p>$ git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/srv/git/ /srv/git/
<p>The --reuseaddr option allows the server to restart without waiting for old connections to time out,
while the --base-path option allows people to clone projects without specifying the entire path, and
the path at the end tells the Git daemon where to look for repositories to export. If you&rsquo;re running a
firewall, you&rsquo;ll also need to punch a hole in it at port 9418 on the box you&rsquo;re setting this up on.
<p>113</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>You can daemonize this process a number of ways, depending on the operating system you&rsquo;re
running.
<p>Since systemd is the most common init system among modern Linux distributions, you can use it for
that purpose. Simply place a file in /etc/systemd/system/git-daemon.service with these contents:
<p>[Unit]
Description=Start Git Daemon
<p>[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/srv/git/ /srv/git/
<p>Restart=always
RestartSec=500ms
<p>StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=git-daemon
<p>User=git
Group=git
<p>[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
<p>You might have noticed that Git daemon is started here with git as both group and user. Modify it
to fit your needs and make sure the provided user exists on the system. Also, check that the Git
binary is indeed located at /usr/bin/git and change the path if necessary.
<p>Finally, you&rsquo;ll run systemctl enable git-daemon to automatically start the service on boot, and can
start and stop the service with, respectively, systemctl start git-daemon and systemctl stop git-
daemon.
<p>On other systems, you may want to use xinetd, a script in your sysvinit system, or something
else&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;as long as you get that command daemonized and watched somehow.
<p>Next, you have to tell Git which repositories to allow unauthenticated Git server-based access to.
You can do this in each repository by creating a file named git-daemon-export-ok.
<p>$ cd /path/to/project.git
$ touch git-daemon-export-ok
<p>The presence of that file tells Git that it&rsquo;s OK to serve this project without authentication.
<p>Smart HTTP
We now have authenticated access through SSH and unauthenticated access through git://, but
there is also a protocol that can do both at the same time. Setting up Smart HTTP is basically just
<p>114</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>enabling a CGI script that is provided with Git called git-http-backend on the server. This CGI will
read the path and headers sent by a git fetch or git push to an HTTP URL and determine if the
client can communicate over HTTP (which is true for any client since version 1.6.6). If the CGI sees
that the client is smart, it will communicate smartly with it; otherwise it will fall back to the dumb
behavior (so it is backward compatible for reads with older clients).
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through a very basic setup. We&rsquo;ll set this up with Apache as the CGI server. If you don&rsquo;t
have Apache setup, you can do so on a Linux box with something like this:
<p>$ sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils
$ a2enmod cgi alias env
<p>This also enables the mod_cgi, mod_alias, and mod_env modules, which are all needed for this to work
properly.
<p>You&rsquo;ll also need to set the Unix user group of the /srv/git directories to www-data so your web server
can read- and write-access the repositories, because the Apache instance running the CGI script will
(by default) be running as that user:
<p>$ chgrp -R www-data /srv/git
<p>Next we need to add some things to the Apache configuration to run the git-http-backend as the
handler for anything coming into the /git path of your web server.
<p>SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /srv/git
SetEnv GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL
ScriptAlias /git/ /usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend/
<p>If you leave out GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL environment variable, then Git will only serve to
unauthenticated clients the repositories with the git-daemon-export-ok file in them, just like the Git
daemon did.
<p>Finally you&rsquo;ll want to tell Apache to allow requests to git-http-backend and make writes be
authenticated somehow, possibly with an Auth block like this:
<p>&lt;Files "git-http-backend"&gt;
&nbsp; AuthType Basic
&nbsp; AuthName "Git Access"
&nbsp; AuthUserFile /srv/git/.htpasswd
&nbsp; Require expr !(%{QUERY_STRING} -strmatch '*service=git-receive-pack*' ||
%{REQUEST_URI} =~ m#/git-receive-pack$#)
&nbsp; Require valid-user
&lt;/Files&gt;
<p>That will require you to create a .htpasswd file containing the passwords of all the valid users. Here
is an example of adding a &ldquo;schacon&rdquo; user to the file:
<p>115</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ htpasswd -c /srv/git/.htpasswd schacon
<p>There are tons of ways to have Apache authenticate users, you&rsquo;ll have to choose and implement one
of them. This is just the simplest example we could come up with. You&rsquo;ll also almost certainly want
to set this up over SSL so all this data is encrypted.
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to go too far down the rabbit hole of Apache configuration specifics, since you could
well be using a different server or have different authentication needs. The idea is that Git comes
with a CGI called git-http-backend that when invoked will do all the negotiation to send and receive
data over HTTP. It does not implement any authentication itself, but that can easily be controlled at
the layer of the web server that invokes it. You can do this with nearly any CGI-capable web server,
so go with the one that you know best.
<p>
For more information on configuring authentication in Apache, check out the
Apache docs here: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/auth.html
<p>GitWeb
Now that you have basic read/write and read-only access to your project, you may want to set up a
simple web-based visualizer. Git comes with a CGI script called GitWeb that is sometimes used for
this.

<p>If you want to check out what GitWeb would look like for your project, Git comes with a command
to fire up a temporary instance if you have a lightweight web server on your system like lighttpd or
webrick. On Linux machines, lighttpd is often installed, so you may be able to get it to run by typing
git instaweb in your project directory. If you&rsquo;re running a Mac, Leopard comes preinstalled with
Ruby, so webrick may be your best bet. To start instaweb with a non-lighttpd handler, you can run it
with the --httpd option.
<p>$ git instaweb --httpd=webrick
[2009-02-21 10:02:21] INFO WEBrick 1.3.1
[2009-02-21 10:02:21] INFO ruby 1.8.6 (2008-03-03) [universal-darwin9.0]
<p>That starts up an HTTPD server on port 1234 and then automatically starts a web browser that
opens on that page. It&rsquo;s pretty easy on your part. When you&rsquo;re done and want to shut down the
server, you can run the same command with the --stop option:
<p>$ git instaweb --httpd=webrick --stop
<p>If you want to run the web interface on a server all the time for your team or for an open source
project you&rsquo;re hosting, you&rsquo;ll need to set up the CGI script to be served by your normal web server.
Some Linux distributions have a gitweb package that you may be able to install via apt or dnf, so
you may want to try that first. We&rsquo;ll walk through installing GitWeb manually very quickly. First,
you need to get the Git source code, which GitWeb comes with, and generate the custom CGI script:
<p>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
$ cd git/
$ make GITWEB_PROJECTROOT="/srv/git" prefix=/usr gitweb
&nbsp; SUBDIR gitweb
&nbsp; SUBDIR ../
make[2]: `GIT-VERSION-FILE' is up to date.
&nbsp; GEN gitweb.cgi
&nbsp; GEN static/gitweb.js
$ sudo cp -Rf gitweb /var/www/
<p>Notice that you have to tell the command where to find your Git repositories with the
GITWEB_PROJECTROOT variable. Now, you need to make Apache use CGI for that script, for which you
can add a VirtualHost:
<p>117</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
&nbsp; ServerName gitserver
&nbsp; DocumentRoot /var/www/gitweb
&nbsp; &lt;Directory /var/www/gitweb&gt;
&nbsp; Options +ExecCGI +FollowSymLinks +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
&nbsp; AllowOverride All
&nbsp; order allow,deny
&nbsp; Allow from all
&nbsp; AddHandler cgi-script cgi
&nbsp; DirectoryIndex gitweb.cgi
&nbsp; &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
<p>Again, GitWeb can be served with any CGI or Perl capable web server; if you prefer to use
something else, it shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to set up. At this point, you should be able to visit
http://gitserver/ to view your repositories online.
<p>GitLab
GitWeb is pretty simplistic though. If you&rsquo;re looking for a more modern, fully featured Git server,
there are some several open source solutions out there that you can install instead. As GitLab is one
of the more popular ones, we&rsquo;ll cover installing and using it as an example. This is a bit more
complex than the GitWeb option and likely requires more maintenance, but it is a much more fully
featured option.
<p>Installation
<p>GitLab is a database-backed web application, so its installation is a bit more involved than some
other Git servers. Fortunately, this process is very well-documented and supported.
<p>There are a few methods you can pursue to install GitLab. To get something up and running
quickly, you can download a virtual machine image or a one-click installer from
https://bitnami.com/stack/gitlab, and tweak the configuration to match your particular
environment. One nice touch Bitnami has included is the login screen (accessed by typing alt+&rarr;); it
tells you the IP address and default username and password for the installed GitLab.
<p>118</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 50. The Bitnami GitLab virtual machine login screen.
<p>For anything else, follow the guidance in the GitLab Community Edition readme, which can be
found at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master. There you&rsquo;ll find assistance for installing
GitLab using Chef recipes, a virtual machine on Digital Ocean, and RPM and DEB packages (which,
as of this writing, are in beta). There&rsquo;s also &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; guidance on getting GitLab running with
non-standard operating systems and databases, a fully-manual installation script, and many other
topics.
<p>Administration
<p>GitLab&rsquo;s administration interface is accessed over the web. Simply point your browser to the
hostname or IP address where GitLab is installed, and log in as an admin user. The default
username is admin@local.host, and the default password is 5iveL!fe (which you will be prompted to
change as soon as you enter it). Once logged in, click the &ldquo;Admin area&rdquo; icon in the menu at the top
right.
<p>Figure 51. The &ldquo;Admin area&rdquo; item in the GitLab menu.
<p>Users
<p>Users in GitLab are accounts that correspond to people. User accounts don&rsquo;t have a lot of
complexity; mainly it&rsquo;s a collection of personal information attached to login data. Each user
account comes with a namespace, which is a logical grouping of projects that belong to that user. If

<br>
<p>the user jane had a project named project, that project&rsquo;s url would be http://server/jane/project.
<p>Figure 52. The GitLab user administration screen.
<p>Removing a user can be done in two ways. &ldquo;Blocking&rdquo; a user prevents them from logging into the
GitLab instance, but all of the data under that user&rsquo;s namespace will be preserved, and commits
signed with that user&rsquo;s email address will still link back to their profile.
<p>&ldquo;Destroying&rdquo; a user, on the other hand, completely removes them from the database and filesystem.
All projects and data in their namespace is removed, and any groups they own will also be
removed. This is obviously a much more permanent and destructive action, and its uses are rare.
<p>Groups
<p>A GitLab group is an assemblage of projects, along with data about how users can access those
projects. Each group has a project namespace (the same way that users do), so if the group training
has a project materials, its url would be http://server/training/materials.
<p>120</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 53. The GitLab group administration screen.
<p>Each group is associated with a number of users, each of which has a level of permissions for the
group&rsquo;s projects and the group itself. These range from &ldquo;Guest&rdquo; (issues and chat only) to &ldquo;Owner&rdquo;
(full control of the group, its members, and its projects). The types of permissions are too numerous
to list here, but GitLab has a helpful link on the administration screen.
<p>Projects
<p>A GitLab project roughly corresponds to a single Git repository. Every project belongs to a single
namespace, either a user or a group. If the project belongs to a user, the owner of the project has
direct control over who has access to the project; if the project belongs to a group, the group&rsquo;s user-
level permissions will also take effect.
<p>Every project also has a visibility level, which controls who has read access to that project&rsquo;s pages
and repository. If a project is Private, the project&rsquo;s owner must explicitly grant access to specific
users. An Internal project is visible to any logged-in user, and a Public project is visible to anyone.
Note that this controls both git fetch access as well as access to the web UI for that project.
<p>Hooks
<p>GitLab includes support for hooks, both at a project or system level. For either of these, the GitLab
server will perform an HTTP POST with some descriptive JSON whenever relevant events occur.
This is a great way to connect your Git repositories and GitLab instance to the rest of your
development automation, such as CI servers, chat rooms, or deployment tools.
<p>Basic Usage
<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do with GitLab is create a new project. This is accomplished by
clicking the &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon on the toolbar. You&rsquo;ll be asked for the project&rsquo;s name, which namespace it
should belong to, and what its visibility level should be. Most of what you specify here isn&rsquo;t
permanent, and can be re-adjusted later through the settings interface. Click &ldquo;Create Project&rdquo;, and
<p>121</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>you&rsquo;re done.
<p>Once the project exists, you&rsquo;ll probably want to connect it with a local Git repository. Each project is
accessible over HTTPS or SSH, either of which can be used to configure a Git remote. The URLs are
visible at the top of the project&rsquo;s home page. For an existing local repository, this command will
create a remote named gitlab to the hosted location:
<p>$ git remote add gitlab https://server/namespace/project.git
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a local copy of the repository, you can simply do this:
<p>$ git clone https://server/namespace/project.git
<p>The web UI provides access to several useful views of the repository itself. Each project&rsquo;s home page
shows recent activity, and links along the top will lead you to views of the project&rsquo;s files and commit
log.
<p>Working Together
<p>The simplest way of working together on a GitLab project is by giving another user direct push
access to the Git repository. You can add a user to a project by going to the &ldquo;Members&rdquo; section of
that project&rsquo;s settings, and associating the new user with an access level (the different access levels
are discussed a bit in Groups). By giving a user an access level of &ldquo;Developer&rdquo; or above, that user
can push commits and branches directly to the repository with impunity.
<p>Another, more decoupled way of collaboration is by using merge requests. This feature enables any
user that can see a project to contribute to it in a controlled way. Users with direct access can
simply create a branch, push commits to it, and open a merge request from their branch back into
master or any other branch. Users who don&rsquo;t have push permissions for a repository can &ldquo;fork&rdquo; it
(create their own copy), push commits to that copy, and open a merge request from their fork back
to the main project. This model allows the owner to be in full control of what goes into the
repository and when, while allowing contributions from untrusted users.
<p>Merge requests and issues are the main units of long-lived discussion in GitLab. Each merge
request allows a line-by-line discussion of the proposed change (which supports a lightweight kind
of code review), as well as a general overall discussion thread. Both can be assigned to users, or
organized into milestones.
<p>This section is focused mainly on the Git-related features of GitLab, but as a mature project, it
provides many other features to help your team work together, such as project wikis and system
maintenance tools. One benefit to GitLab is that, once the server is set up and running, you&rsquo;ll rarely
need to tweak a configuration file or access the server via SSH; most administration and general
usage can be accomplished through the in-browser interface.
<p>Third Party Hosted Options
If you don&rsquo;t want to go through all of the work involved in setting up your own Git server, you have
<p>122</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>several options for hosting your Git projects on an external dedicated hosting site. Doing so offers a
number of advantages: a hosting site is generally quick to set up and easy to start projects on, and
no server maintenance or monitoring is involved. Even if you set up and run your own server
internally, you may still want to use a public hosting site for your open source code &ndash; it&rsquo;s generally
easier for the open source community to find and help you with.
<p>These days, you have a huge number of hosting options to choose from, each with different
advantages and disadvantages. To see an up-to-date list, check out the GitHosting page on the main
Git wiki at https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting
<p>We&rsquo;ll cover using GitHub in detail in GitHub, as it is the largest Git host out there and you may need
to interact with projects hosted on it in any case, but there are dozens more to choose from should
you not want to set up your own Git server.
<p>Summary
You have several options to get a remote Git repository up and running so that you can collaborate
with others or share your work.
<p>Running your own server gives you a lot of control and allows you to run the server within your
own firewall, but such a server generally requires a fair amount of your time to set up and
maintain. If you place your data on a hosted server, it&rsquo;s easy to set up and maintain; however, you
have to be able to keep your code on someone else&rsquo;s servers, and some organizations don&rsquo;t allow
that.
<p>It should be fairly straightforward to determine which solution or combination of solutions is
appropriate for you and your organization.

<p>Distributed Git
Now that you have a remote Git repository set up as a focal point for all the developers to share
their code, and you&rsquo;re familiar with basic Git commands in a local workflow, you&rsquo;ll look at how to
utilize some of the distributed workflows that Git affords you.
<p>In this chapter, you&rsquo;ll see how to work with Git in a distributed environment as a contributor and
an integrator. That is, you&rsquo;ll learn how to contribute code successfully to a project and make it as
easy on you and the project maintainer as possible, and also how to maintain a project successfully
with a number of developers contributing.
<p>Distributed Workflows
In contrast with Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs), the distributed nature of Git allows
you to be far more flexible in how developers collaborate on projects. In centralized systems, every
developer is a node working more or less equally with a central hub. In Git, however, every
developer is potentially both a node and a hub; that is, every developer can both contribute code to
other repositories and maintain a public repository on which others can base their work and which
they can contribute to. This presents a vast range of workflow possibilities for your project and/or
your team, so we&rsquo;ll cover a few common paradigms that take advantage of this flexibility. We&rsquo;ll go
over the strengths and possible weaknesses of each design; you can choose a single one to use, or
you can mix and match features from each.
<p>Centralized Workflow
<p>In centralized systems, there is generally a single collaboration model&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the centralized workflow.
One central hub, or repository, can accept code, and everyone synchronizes their work with it. A
number of developers are nodes&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;consumers of that hub&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and synchronize with that centralized
location.
<p>Figure 54. Centralized workflow.
<p>This means that if two developers clone from the hub and both make changes, the first developer to
push their changes back up can do so with no problems. The second developer must merge in the
<p>124</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>first one&rsquo;s work before pushing changes up, so as not to overwrite the first developer&rsquo;s changes.
This concept is as true in Git as it is in Subversion (or any CVCS), and this model works perfectly
well in Git.
<p>If you are already comfortable with a centralized workflow in your company or team, you can
easily continue using that workflow with Git. Simply set up a single repository, and give everyone
on your team push access; Git won&rsquo;t let users overwrite each other.
<p>Say John and Jessica both start working at the same time. John finishes his change and pushes it to
the server. Then Jessica tries to push her changes, but the server rejects them. She is told that she&rsquo;s
trying to push non-fast-forward changes and that she won&rsquo;t be able to do so until she fetches and
merges. This workflow is attractive to a lot of people because it&rsquo;s a paradigm that many are familiar
and comfortable with.
<p>This is also not limited to small teams. With Git&rsquo;s branching model, it&rsquo;s possible for hundreds of
developers to successfully work on a single project through dozens of branches simultaneously.
<p>Integration-Manager Workflow
<p>Because Git allows you to have multiple remote repositories, it&rsquo;s possible to have a workflow where
each developer has write access to their own public repository and read access to everyone else&rsquo;s.
This scenario often includes a canonical repository that represents the &ldquo;official&rdquo; project. To
contribute to that project, you create your own public clone of the project and push your changes to
it. Then, you can send a request to the maintainer of the main project to pull in your changes. The
maintainer can then add your repository as a remote, test your changes locally, merge them into
their branch, and push back to their repository. The process works as follows (see Integration-
manager workflow.):
<p>1. The project maintainer pushes to their public repository.
<p>2. A contributor clones that repository and makes changes.
<p>3. The contributor pushes to their own public copy.
<p>4. The contributor sends the maintainer an email asking them to pull changes.
<p>5. The maintainer adds the contributor&rsquo;s repository as a remote and merges locally.
<p>6. The maintainer pushes merged changes to the main repository.
<p>Figure 55. Integration-manager workflow.
<p>125</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>This is a very common workflow with hub-based tools like GitHub or GitLab, where it&rsquo;s easy to fork
a project and push your changes into your fork for everyone to see. One of the main advantages of
this approach is that you can continue to work, and the maintainer of the main repository can pull
in your changes at any time. Contributors don&rsquo;t have to wait for the project to incorporate their
changes&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;each party can work at their own pace.
<p>Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow
<p>This is a variant of a multiple-repository workflow. It&rsquo;s generally used by huge projects with
hundreds of collaborators; one famous example is the Linux kernel. Various integration managers
are in charge of certain parts of the repository; they&rsquo;re called lieutenants. All the lieutenants have
one integration manager known as the benevolent dictator. The benevolent dictator pushes from
their directory to a reference repository from which all the collaborators need to pull. The process
works like this (see Benevolent dictator workflow.):
<p>1. Regular developers work on their topic branch and rebase their work on top of master. The
master branch is that of the reference repository to which the dictator pushes.
<p>2. Lieutenants merge the developers' topic branches into their master branch.
<p>3. The dictator merges the lieutenants' master branches into the dictator&rsquo;s master branch.
<p>4. Finally, the dictator pushes that master branch to the reference repository so the other
developers can rebase on it.
<p>Figure 56. Benevolent dictator workflow.
<p>This kind of workflow isn&rsquo;t common, but can be useful in very big projects, or in highly hierarchical
environments. It allows the project leader (the dictator) to delegate much of the work and collect
large subsets of code at multiple points before integrating them.
<p>Workflows Summary
<p>These are some commonly used workflows that are possible with a distributed system like Git, but
<p>126</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>you can see that many variations are possible to suit your particular real-world workflow. Now that
you can (hopefully) determine which workflow combination may work for you, we&rsquo;ll cover some
more specific examples of how to accomplish the main roles that make up the different flows. In
the next section, you&rsquo;ll learn about a few common patterns for contributing to a project.
<p>Contributing to a Project
The main difficulty with describing how to contribute to a project are the numerous variations on
how to do that. Because Git is very flexible, people can and do work together in many ways, and it&rsquo;s
problematic to describe how you should contribute&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;every project is a bit different. Some of the
variables involved are active contributor count, chosen workflow, your commit access, and possibly
the external contribution method.
<p>The first variable is active contributor count&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;how many users are actively contributing code to
this project, and how often? In many instances, you&rsquo;ll have two or three developers with a few
commits a day, or possibly less for somewhat dormant projects. For larger companies or projects,
the number of developers could be in the thousands, with hundreds or thousands of commits
coming in each day. This is important because with more and more developers, you run into more
issues with making sure your code applies cleanly or can be easily merged. Changes you submit
may be rendered obsolete or severely broken by work that is merged in while you were working or
while your changes were waiting to be approved or applied. How can you keep your code
consistently up to date and your commits valid?
<p>The next variable is the workflow in use for the project. Is it centralized, with each developer
having equal write access to the main codeline? Does the project have a maintainer or integration
manager who checks all the patches? Are all the patches peer-reviewed and approved? Are you
involved in that process? Is a lieutenant system in place, and do you have to submit your work to
them first?
<p>The next variable is your commit access. The workflow required in order to contribute to a project
is much different if you have write access to the project than if you don&rsquo;t. If you don&rsquo;t have write
access, how does the project prefer to accept contributed work? Does it even have a policy? How
much work are you contributing at a time? How often do you contribute?
<p>All these questions can affect how you contribute effectively to a project and what workflows are
preferred or available to you. We&rsquo;ll cover aspects of each of these in a series of use cases, moving
from simple to more complex; you should be able to construct the specific workflows you need in
practice from these examples.
<p>Commit Guidelines
<p>Before we start looking at the specific use cases, here&rsquo;s a quick note about commit messages.
Having a good guideline for creating commits and sticking to it makes working with Git and
collaborating with others a lot easier. The Git project provides a document that lays out a number
of good tips for creating commits from which to submit patches&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can read it in the Git source
code in the Documentation/SubmittingPatches file.
<p>First, your submissions should not contain any whitespace errors. Git provides an easy way to
check for this&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;before you commit, run git diff --check, which identifies possible whitespace
<p>127</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>errors and lists them for you.
<p>Figure 57. Output of git diff --check.
<p>If you run that command before committing, you can tell if you&rsquo;re about to commit whitespace
issues that may annoy other developers.
<p>Next, try to make each commit a logically separate changeset. If you can, try to make your changes
digestible&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;don&rsquo;t code for a whole weekend on five different issues and then submit them all as
one massive commit on Monday. Even if you don&rsquo;t commit during the weekend, use the staging area
on Monday to split your work into at least one commit per issue, with a useful message per commit.
If some of the changes modify the same file, try to use git add --patch to partially stage files
(covered in detail in Interactive Staging). The project snapshot at the tip of the branch is identical
whether you do one commit or five, as long as all the changes are added at some point, so try to
make things easier on your fellow developers when they have to review your changes.
<p>This approach also makes it easier to pull out or revert one of the changesets if you need to later.
Rewriting History describes a number of useful Git tricks for rewriting history and interactively
staging files&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;use these tools to help craft a clean and understandable history before sending the
work to someone else.
<p>The last thing to keep in mind is the commit message. Getting in the habit of creating quality
commit messages makes using and collaborating with Git a lot easier. As a general rule, your
messages should start with a single line that&rsquo;s no more than about 50 characters and that describes
the changeset concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation. The Git
project requires that the more detailed explanation include your motivation for the change and
contrast its implementation with previous behavior&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this is a good guideline to follow. Write your
commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." Here is a template
originally written by Tim Pope:
<p>128</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html</a>

</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
<p>More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.
<p>Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.
<p>Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
<p>- Bullet points are okay, too
<p>- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
&nbsp; single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
<p>- Use a hanging indent
<p>If all your commit messages follow this model, things will be much easier for you and the
developers with whom you collaborate. The Git project has well-formatted commit messages&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;try
running git log --no-merges there to see what a nicely-formatted project-commit history looks like.
<p>
<p>Do as we say, not as we do.
<p>For the sake of brevity, many of the examples in this book don&rsquo;t have nicely-
formatted commit messages like this; instead, we simply use the -m option to git
commit.
<p>In short, do as we say, not as we do.
<p>Private Small Team
<p>The simplest setup you&rsquo;re likely to encounter is a private project with one or two other developers.
&ldquo;Private,&rdquo; in this context, means closed-source&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;not accessible to the outside world. You and the
other developers all have push access to the repository.
<p>In this environment, you can follow a workflow similar to what you might do when using
Subversion or another centralized system. You still get the advantages of things like offline
committing and vastly simpler branching and merging, but the workflow can be very similar; the
main difference is that merges happen client-side rather than on the server at commit time. Let&rsquo;s
see what it might look like when two developers start to work together with a shared repository.
The first developer, John, clones the repository, makes a change, and commits locally. (The protocol
messages have been replaced with ... in these examples to shorten them somewhat.)
<p>129</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p># John's Machine
$ git clone john@githost:simplegit.git
Cloning into 'simplegit'...
...
$ cd simplegit/
$ vim lib/simplegit.rb
$ git commit -am 'Remove invalid default value'
[master 738ee87] Remove invalid default value
&nbsp;1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
<p>The second developer, Jessica, does the same thing&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;clones the repository and commits a change:
<p># Jessica's Machine
$ git clone jessica@githost:simplegit.git
Cloning into 'simplegit'...
...
$ cd simplegit/
$ vim TODO
$ git commit -am 'Add reset task'
[master fbff5bc] Add reset task
&nbsp;1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
<p>Now, Jessica pushes her work to the server, which works just fine:
<p># Jessica's Machine
$ git push origin master
...
To jessica@githost:simplegit.git
&nbsp; 1edee6b..fbff5bc master -&gt; master
<p>The last line of the output above shows a useful return message from the push operation. The basic
format is &lt;oldref&gt;..&lt;newref&gt; fromref -&gt; toref, where oldref means the old reference, newref
means the new reference, fromref is the name of the local reference being pushed, and toref is the
name of the remote reference being updated. You&rsquo;ll see similar output like this below in the
discussions, so having a basic idea of the meaning will help in understanding the various states of
the repositories. More details are available in the documentation for git-push.
<p>Continuing with this example, shortly afterwards, John makes some changes, commits them to his
local repository, and tries to push them to the same server:
<p># John's Machine
$ git push origin master
To john@githost:simplegit.git
&nbsp;! [rejected] master -&gt; master (non-fast forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'john@githost:simplegit.git'
<p>130</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push">https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>In this case, John&rsquo;s push fails because of Jessica&rsquo;s earlier push of her changes. This is especially
important to understand if you&rsquo;re used to Subversion, because you&rsquo;ll notice that the two developers
didn&rsquo;t edit the same file. Although Subversion automatically does such a merge on the server if
different files are edited, with Git, you must first merge the commits locally. In other words, John
must first fetch Jessica&rsquo;s upstream changes and merge them into his local repository before he will
be allowed to push.
<p>As a first step, John fetches Jessica&rsquo;s work (this only fetches Jessica&rsquo;s upstream work, it does not yet
merge it into John&rsquo;s work):
<p>$ git fetch origin
...
From john@githost:simplegit
&nbsp;+ 049d078...fbff5bc master -&gt; origin/master
<p>At this point, John&rsquo;s local repository looks something like this:
<p>Figure 58. John&rsquo;s divergent history.
<p>Now John can merge Jessica&rsquo;s work that he fetched into his own local work:
<p>$ git merge origin/master
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
&nbsp;TODO | 1 +
&nbsp;1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
<p>As long as that local merge goes smoothly, John&rsquo;s updated history will now look like this:
<p>131</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 59. John&rsquo;s repository after merging origin/master.
<p>At this point, John might want to test this new code to make sure none of Jessica&rsquo;s work affects any
of his and, as long as everything seems fine, he can finally push the new merged work up to the
server:
<p>$ git push origin master
...
To john@githost:simplegit.git
&nbsp; fbff5bc..72bbc59 master -&gt; master
<p>In the end, John&rsquo;s commit history will look like this:
<p>Figure 60. John&rsquo;s history after pushing to the origin server.
<p>In the meantime, Jessica has created a new topic branch called issue54, and made three commits to
that branch. She hasn&rsquo;t fetched John&rsquo;s changes yet, so her commit history looks like this:
<p>132</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 61. Jessica&rsquo;s topic branch.
<p>Suddenly, Jessica learns that John has pushed some new work to the server and she wants to take a
look at it, so she can fetch all new content from the server that she does not yet have with:
<p># Jessica's Machine
$ git fetch origin
...
From jessica@githost:simplegit
&nbsp; fbff5bc..72bbc59 master -&gt; origin/master
<p>That pulls down the work John has pushed up in the meantime. Jessica&rsquo;s history now looks like this:
<p>Figure 62. Jessica&rsquo;s history after fetching John&rsquo;s changes.
<p>Jessica thinks her topic branch is ready, but she wants to know what part of John&rsquo;s fetched work she
has to merge into her work so that she can push. She runs git log to find out:
<p>$ git log --no-merges issue54..origin/master
commit 738ee872852dfaa9d6634e0dea7a324040193016
Author: John Smith &lt;jsmith@example.com&gt;
Date: Fri May 29 16:01:27 2009 -0700
<p>&nbsp; Remove invalid default value
<p>The issue54..origin/master syntax is a log filter that asks Git to display only those commits that are
on the latter branch (in this case origin/master) that are not on the first branch (in this case
issue54). We&rsquo;ll go over this syntax in detail in Commit Ranges.
<p>From the above output, we can see that there is a single commit that John has made that Jessica has
<p>133</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>not merged into her local work. If she merges origin/master, that is the single commit that will
modify her local work.
<p>Now, Jessica can merge her topic work into her master branch, merge John&rsquo;s work (origin/master)
into her master branch, and then push back to the server again.
<p>First (having committed all of the work on her issue54 topic branch), Jessica switches back to her
master branch in preparation for integrating all this work:
<p>$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
<p>Jessica can merge either origin/master or issue54 first&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;they&rsquo;re both upstream, so the order doesn&rsquo;t
matter. The end snapshot should be identical no matter which order she chooses; only the history
will be different. She chooses to merge the issue54 branch first:
<p>$ git merge issue54
Updating fbff5bc..4af4298
Fast forward
&nbsp;README | 1 +
&nbsp;lib/simplegit.rb | 6 +++++-
&nbsp;2 files changed, 6 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
<p>No problems occur; as you can see it was a simple fast-forward merge. Jessica now completes the
local merging process by merging John&rsquo;s earlier fetched work that is sitting in the origin/master
branch:
<p>$ git merge origin/master
Auto-merging lib/simplegit.rb
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
&nbsp;lib/simplegit.rb | 2 +-
&nbsp;1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
<p>Everything merges cleanly, and Jessica&rsquo;s history now looks like this:
<p>Figure 63. Jessica&rsquo;s history after merging John&rsquo;s changes.
<p>134</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Now origin/master is reachable from Jessica&rsquo;s master branch, so she should be able to successfully
push (assuming John hasn&rsquo;t pushed even more changes in the meantime):
<p>$ git push origin master
...
To jessica@githost:simplegit.git
&nbsp; 72bbc59..8059c15 master -&gt; master
<p>Each developer has committed a few times and merged each other&rsquo;s work successfully.
<p>Figure 64. Jessica&rsquo;s history after pushing all changes back to the server.
<p>That is one of the simplest workflows. You work for a while (generally in a topic branch), and
merge that work into your master branch when it&rsquo;s ready to be integrated. When you want to share
that work, you fetch and merge your master from origin/master if it has changed, and finally push
to the master branch on the server. The general sequence is something like this:
<p>135</p>

<p>Private Managed Team
<p>In this next scenario, you&rsquo;ll look at contributor roles in a larger private group. You&rsquo;ll learn how to
work in an environment where small groups collaborate on features, after which those team-based
contributions are integrated by another party.
<p>136</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that John and Jessica are working together on one feature (call this &ldquo;featureA&rdquo;), while
Jessica and a third developer, Josie, are working on a second (say, &ldquo;featureB&rdquo;). In this case, the
company is using a type of integration-manager workflow where the work of the individual groups
is integrated only by certain engineers, and the master branch of the main repo can be updated only
by those engineers. In this scenario, all work is done in team-based branches and pulled together by
the integrators later.
<p>Let&rsquo;s follow Jessica&rsquo;s workflow as she works on her two features, collaborating in parallel with two
different developers in this environment. Assuming she already has her repository cloned, she
decides to work on featureA first. She creates a new branch for the feature and does some work on
it there:
<p># Jessica's Machine
$ git checkout -b featureA
Switched to a new branch 'featureA'
$ vim lib/simplegit.rb
$ git commit -am 'Add limit to log function'
[featureA 3300904] Add limit to log function
&nbsp;1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
<p>At this point, she needs to share her work with John, so she pushes her featureA branch commits up
to the server. Jessica doesn&rsquo;t have push access to the master branch&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;only the integrators do&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;so
she has to push to another branch in order to collaborate with John:
<p>$ git push -u origin featureA
...
To jessica@githost:simplegit.git
&nbsp;* [new branch] featureA -&gt; featureA
<p>Jessica emails John to tell him that she&rsquo;s pushed some work into a branch named featureA and he
can look at it now. While she waits for feedback from John, Jessica decides to start working on
featureB with Josie. To begin, she starts a new feature branch, basing it off the server&rsquo;s master
branch:
<p># Jessica's Machine
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout -b featureB origin/master
Switched to a new branch 'featureB'
<p>Now, Jessica makes a couple of commits on the featureB branch:
<p>137</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ vim lib/simplegit.rb
$ git commit -am 'Make ls-tree function recursive'
[featureB e5b0fdc] Make ls-tree function recursive

$ vim lib/simplegit.rb
$ git commit -am 'Add ls-files'
[featureB 8512791] Add ls-files
&nbsp;1 files changed, 5 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
<p>Jessica&rsquo;s repository now looks like this:
<p>Figure 66. Jessica&rsquo;s initial commit history.
<p>She&rsquo;s ready to push her work, but gets an email from Josie that a branch with some initial
&ldquo;featureB&rdquo; work on it was already pushed to the server as the featureBee branch. Jessica needs to
merge those changes with her own before she can push her work to the server. Jessica first fetches
Josie&rsquo;s changes with git fetch:
<p>$ git fetch origin
...
From jessica@githost:simplegit
&nbsp;* [new branch] featureBee -&gt; origin/featureBee
<p>Assuming Jessica is still on her checked-out featureB branch, she can now merge Josie&rsquo;s work into
that branch with git merge:
<p>$ git merge origin/featureBee
Auto-merging lib/simplegit.rb
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
&nbsp;lib/simplegit.rb | 4 ++++
&nbsp;1 files changed, 4 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
<p>138</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>At this point, Jessica wants to push all of this merged &ldquo;featureB&rdquo; work back to the server, but she
doesn&rsquo;t want to simply push her own featureB branch. Rather, since Josie has already started an
upstream featureBee branch, Jessica wants to push to that branch, which she does with:
<p>$ git push -u origin featureB:featureBee
...
To jessica@githost:simplegit.git
&nbsp; fba9af8..cd685d1 featureB -&gt; featureBee
<p>This is called a refspec. See The Refspec for a more detailed discussion of Git refspecs and different
things you can do with them. Also notice the -u flag; this is short for --set-upstream, which
configures the branches for easier pushing and pulling later.
<p>Suddenly, Jessica gets email from John, who tells her he&rsquo;s pushed some changes to the featureA
branch on which they are collaborating, and he asks Jessica to take a look at them. Again, Jessica
runs a simple git fetch to fetch all new content from the server, including (of course) John&rsquo;s latest
work:
<p>$ git fetch origin
...
From jessica@githost:simplegit
&nbsp; 3300904..aad881d featureA -&gt; origin/featureA
<p>Jessica can display the log of John&rsquo;s new work by comparing the content of the newly-fetched
featureA branch with her local copy of the same branch:
<p>$ git log featureA..origin/featureA
commit aad881d154acdaeb2b6b18ea0e827ed8a6d671e6
Author: John Smith &lt;jsmith@example.com&gt;
Date: Fri May 29 19:57:33 2009 -0700
<p>&nbsp; Increase log output to 30 from 25
<p>If Jessica likes what she sees, she can merge John&rsquo;s new work into her local featureA branch with:
<p>$ git checkout featureA
Switched to branch 'featureA'
$ git merge origin/featureA

1 files changed, 9 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
<p>Finally, Jessica might want to make a couple minor changes to all that merged content, so she is free
to make those changes, commit them to her local featureA branch, and push the end result back to
the server:

<p>Jessica&rsquo;s commit history now looks something like this:
<p>Figure 67. Jessica&rsquo;s history after committing on a feature branch.
<p>At some point, Jessica, Josie, and John inform the integrators that the featureA and featureBee
branches on the server are ready for integration into the mainline. After the integrators merge
these branches into the mainline, a fetch will bring down the new merge commit, making the
history look like this:

<p>Figure 68. Jessica&rsquo;s history after merging both her topic branches.
<p>Many groups switch to Git because of this ability to have multiple teams working in parallel,
merging the different lines of work late in the process. The ability of smaller subgroups of a team to
collaborate via remote branches without necessarily having to involve or impede the entire team is
a huge benefit of Git. The sequence for the workflow you saw here is something like this:
<p>141</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 69. Basic sequence of this managed-team workflow.
<p>Forked Public Project
<p>Contributing to public projects is a bit different. Because you don&rsquo;t have the permissions to directly
update branches on the project, you have to get the work to the maintainers some other way. This
first example describes contributing via forking on Git hosts that support easy forking. Many
hosting sites support this (including GitHub, BitBucket, repo.or.cz, and others), and many project
maintainers expect this style of contribution. The next section deals with projects that prefer to
accept contributed patches via email.
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll probably want to clone the main repository, create a topic branch for the patch or patch
<p>142</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>series you&rsquo;re planning to contribute, and do your work there. The sequence looks basically like this:
<p>$ git clone &lt;url&gt;
$ cd project
$ git checkout -b featureA
&nbsp; ... work ...
$ git commit
&nbsp; ... work ...
$ git commit
<p>
You may want to use rebase -i to squash your work down to a single commit, or
rearrange the work in the commits to make the patch easier for the maintainer to
review&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;see Rewriting History for more information about interactive rebasing.
<p>When your branch work is finished and you&rsquo;re ready to contribute it back to the maintainers, go to
the original project page and click the &ldquo;Fork&rdquo; button, creating your own writable fork of the project.
You then need to add this repository URL as a new remote of your local repository; in this example,
let&rsquo;s call it myfork:
<p>$ git remote add myfork &lt;url&gt;
<p>You then need to push your new work to this repository. It&rsquo;s easiest to push the topic branch you&rsquo;re
working on to your forked repository, rather than merging that work into your master branch and
pushing that. The reason is that if your work isn&rsquo;t accepted or is cherry-picked, you don&rsquo;t have to
rewind your master branch (the Git cherry-pick operation is covered in more detail in Rebasing and
Cherry-Picking Workflows). If the maintainers merge, rebase, or cherry-pick your work, you&rsquo;ll
eventually get it back via pulling from their repository anyhow.
<p>In any event, you can push your work with:
<p>$ git push -u myfork featureA
<p>Once your work has been pushed to your fork of the repository, you need to notify the maintainers
of the original project that you have work you&rsquo;d like them to merge. This is often called a pull
request, and you typically generate such a request either via the website&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;GitHub has its own &ldquo;Pull
Request&rdquo; mechanism that we&rsquo;ll go over in GitHub&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;or you can run the git request-pull command
and email the subsequent output to the project maintainer manually.
<p>The git request-pull command takes the base branch into which you want your topic branch
pulled and the Git repository URL you want them to pull from, and produces a summary of all the
changes you&rsquo;re asking to be pulled. For instance, if Jessica wants to send John a pull request, and
she&rsquo;s done two commits on the topic branch she just pushed, she can run this:
<p>143</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git request-pull origin/master myfork

<p>This output can be sent to the maintainer&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it tells them where the work was branched from,
summarizes the commits, and identifies from where the new work is to be pulled.
<p>On a project for which you&rsquo;re not the maintainer, it&rsquo;s generally easier to have a branch like master
always track origin/master and to do your work in topic branches that you can easily discard if
they&rsquo;re rejected. Having work themes isolated into topic branches also makes it easier for you to
rebase your work if the tip of the main repository has moved in the meantime and your commits
no longer apply cleanly. For example, if you want to submit a second topic of work to the project,
don&rsquo;t continue working on the topic branch you just pushed up&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;start over from the main
repository&rsquo;s master branch:
<p>$ git checkout -b featureB origin/master
&nbsp; ... work ...
$ git commit
$ git push myfork featureB
$ git request-pull origin/master myfork
&nbsp; ... email generated request pull to maintainer ...
$ git fetch origin
<p>Now, each of your topics is contained within a silo&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;similar to a patch queue&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that you can
rewrite, rebase, and modify without the topics interfering or interdepending on each other, like so:
<p>144</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 70. Initial commit history with featureB work.
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the project maintainer has pulled in a bunch of other patches and tried your first branch,
but it no longer cleanly merges. In this case, you can try to rebase that branch on top of
origin/master, resolve the conflicts for the maintainer, and then resubmit your changes:
<p>$ git checkout featureA
$ git rebase origin/master
$ git push -f myfork featureA
<p>This rewrites your history to now look like Commit history after featureA work..
<p>Figure 71. Commit history after featureA work.
<p>Because you rebased the branch, you have to specify the -f to your push command in order to be
able to replace the featureA branch on the server with a commit that isn&rsquo;t a descendant of it. An
alternative would be to push this new work to a different branch on the server (perhaps called
featureAv2).
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one more possible scenario: the maintainer has looked at work in your second branch
and likes the concept but would like you to change an implementation detail. You&rsquo;ll also take this
opportunity to move the work to be based off the project&rsquo;s current master branch. You start a new
branch based off the current origin/master branch, squash the featureB changes there, resolve any
conflicts, make the implementation change, and then push that as a new branch:
<p>145</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git checkout -b featureBv2 origin/master
$ git merge --squash featureB
&nbsp; ... change implementation ...
$ git commit
$ git push myfork featureBv2
<p>The --squash option takes all the work on the merged branch and squashes it into one changeset
producing the repository state as if a real merge happened, without actually making a merge
commit. This means your future commit will have one parent only and allows you to introduce all
the changes from another branch and then make more changes before recording the new commit.
Also the --no-commit option can be useful to delay the merge commit in case of the default merge
process.
<p>At this point, you can notify the maintainer that you&rsquo;ve made the requested changes, and that they
can find those changes in your featureBv2 branch.
<p>Figure 72. Commit history after featureBv2 work.
<p>Public Project over Email
<p>Many projects have established procedures for accepting patches&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you&rsquo;ll need to check the specific
rules for each project, because they will differ. Since there are several older, larger projects which
accept patches via a developer mailing list, we&rsquo;ll go over an example of that now.
<p>The workflow is similar to the previous use case&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you create topic branches for each patch series
you work on. The difference is how you submit them to the project. Instead of forking the project
and pushing to your own writable version, you generate email versions of each commit series and
email them to the developer mailing list:
<p>$ git checkout -b topicA
&nbsp; ... work ...
$ git commit
&nbsp; ... work ...
$ git commit
<p>Now you have two commits that you want to send to the mailing list. You use git format-patch to
generate the mbox-formatted files that you can email to the list&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it turns each commit into an
<p>146</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>email message with the first line of the commit message as the subject and the rest of the message
plus the patch that the commit introduces as the body. The nice thing about this is that applying a
patch from an email generated with format-patch preserves all the commit information properly.
<p>$ git format-patch -M origin/master
0001-add-limit-to-log-function.patch
0002-increase-log-output-to-30-from-25.patch
<p>The format-patch command prints out the names of the patch files it creates. The -M switch tells Git
to look for renames. The files end up looking like this:
<p>$ cat 0001-add-limit-to-log-function.patch

<p>You can also edit these patch files to add more information for the email list that you don&rsquo;t want to
show up in the commit message. If you add text between the --- line and the beginning of the patch
(the diff --git line), the developers can read it, but that content is ignored by the patching process.
<p>To email this to a mailing list, you can either paste the file into your email program or send it via a
command-line program. Pasting the text often causes formatting issues, especially with &ldquo;smarter&rdquo;
clients that don&rsquo;t preserve newlines and other whitespace appropriately. Luckily, Git provides a tool
to help you send properly formatted patches via IMAP, which may be easier for you. We&rsquo;ll
demonstrate how to send a patch via Gmail, which happens to be the email agent we know best;
<p>147</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>you can read detailed instructions for a number of mail programs at the end of the aforementioned
Documentation/SubmittingPatches file in the Git source code.
<p>First, you need to set up the imap section in your ~/.gitconfig file. You can set each value
separately with a series of git config commands, or you can add them manually, but in the end
your config file should look something like this:
<p>[imap]
&nbsp; folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"
&nbsp; host = imaps://imap.gmail.com
&nbsp; user = user@gmail.com
&nbsp; pass = YX]8g76G_2^sFbd
&nbsp; port = 993
&nbsp; sslverify = false
<p>If your IMAP server doesn&rsquo;t use SSL, the last two lines probably aren&rsquo;t necessary, and the host value
will be imap:// instead of imaps://. When that is set up, you can use git imap-send to place the patch
series in the Drafts folder of the specified IMAP server:
<p>$ cat *.patch |git imap-send
Resolving imap.gmail.com... ok
Connecting to [74.125.142.109]:993... ok
Logging in...
sending 2 messages
100% (2/2) done
<p>At this point, you should be able to go to your Drafts folder, change the To field to the mailing list
you&rsquo;re sending the patch to, possibly CC the maintainer or person responsible for that section, and
send it off.
<p>You can also send the patches through an SMTP server. As before, you can set each value separately
with a series of git config commands, or you can add them manually in the sendemail section in
your ~/.gitconfig file:
<p>[sendemail]
&nbsp; smtpencryption = tls
&nbsp; smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
&nbsp; smtpuser = user@gmail.com
&nbsp; smtpserverport = 587
<p>After this is done, you can use git send-email to send your patches:

<p>Summary
<p>This section has covered a number of common workflows for dealing with several very different
types of Git projects you&rsquo;re likely to encounter, and introduced a couple of new tools to help you
manage this process. Next, you&rsquo;ll see how to work the other side of the coin: maintaining a Git
project. You&rsquo;ll learn how to be a benevolent dictator or integration manager.
<p>Maintaining a Project
In addition to knowing how to contribute effectively to a project, you&rsquo;ll likely need to know how to
maintain one. This can consist of accepting and applying patches generated via format-patch and
emailed to you, or integrating changes in remote branches for repositories you&rsquo;ve added as remotes
to your project. Whether you maintain a canonical repository or want to help by verifying or
approving patches, you need to know how to accept work in a way that is clearest for other
contributors and sustainable by you over the long run.
<p>Working in Topic Branches
<p>When you&rsquo;re thinking of integrating new work, it&rsquo;s generally a good idea to try it out in a topic
branch&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a temporary branch specifically made to try out that new work. This way, it&rsquo;s easy to
tweak a patch individually and leave it if it&rsquo;s not working until you have time to come back to it. If
<p>149</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>you create a simple branch name based on the theme of the work you&rsquo;re going to try, such as
ruby_client or something similarly descriptive, you can easily remember it if you have to abandon
it for a while and come back later. The maintainer of the Git project tends to namespace these
branches as well&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;such as sc/ruby_client, where sc is short for the person who contributed the
work. As you&rsquo;ll remember, you can create the branch based off your master branch like this:
<p>$ git branch sc/ruby_client master
<p>Or, if you want to also switch to it immediately, you can use the checkout -b option:
<p>$ git checkout -b sc/ruby_client master
<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to add the contributed work that you received into this topic branch and
determine if you want to merge it into your longer-term branches.
<p>Applying Patches from Email
<p>If you receive a patch over email that you need to integrate into your project, you need to apply the
patch in your topic branch to evaluate it. There are two ways to apply an emailed patch: with git
apply or with git am.
<p>Applying a Patch with apply
<p>If you received the patch from someone who generated it with git diff or some variation of the
Unix diff command (which is not recommended; see the next section), you can apply it with the git
apply command. Assuming you saved the patch at /tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch, you can apply the
patch like this:
<p>$ git apply /tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch
<p>This modifies the files in your working directory. It&rsquo;s almost identical to running a patch -p1
command to apply the patch, although it&rsquo;s more paranoid and accepts fewer fuzzy matches than
patch. It also handles file adds, deletes, and renames if they&rsquo;re described in the git diff format,
which patch won&rsquo;t do. Finally, git apply is an &ldquo;apply all or abort all&rdquo; model where either everything
is applied or nothing is, whereas patch can partially apply patchfiles, leaving your working
directory in a weird state. git apply is overall much more conservative than patch. It won&rsquo;t create a
commit for you&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;after running it, you must stage and commit the changes introduced manually.
<p>You can also use git apply to see if a patch applies cleanly before you try actually applying it&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you
can run git apply --check with the patch:
<p>$ git apply --check 0001-see-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch
error: patch failed: ticgit.gemspec:1
error: ticgit.gemspec: patch does not apply
<p>150</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>If there is no output, then the patch should apply cleanly. This command also exits with a non-zero
status if the check fails, so you can use it in scripts if you want.
<p>Applying a Patch with am
<p>If the contributor is a Git user and was good enough to use the format-patch command to generate
their patch, then your job is easier because the patch contains author information and a commit
message for you. If you can, encourage your contributors to use format-patch instead of diff to
generate patches for you. You should only have to use git apply for legacy patches and things like
that.
<p>To apply a patch generated by format-patch, you use git am (the command is named am as it is used
to "apply a series of patches from a mailbox"). Technically, git am is built to read an mbox file,
which is a simple, plain-text format for storing one or more email messages in one text file. It looks
something like this:
<p>From 330090432754092d704da8e76ca5c05c198e71a8 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Add limit to log function
<p>Limit log functionality to the first 20
<p>This is the beginning of the output of the git format-patch command that you saw in the previous
section; it also represents a valid mbox email format. If someone has emailed you the patch
properly using git send-email, and you download that into an mbox format, then you can point git
am to that mbox file, and it will start applying all the patches it sees. If you run a mail client that can
save several emails out in mbox format, you can save entire patch series into a file and then use git
am to apply them one at a time.
<p>However, if someone uploaded a patch file generated via git format-patch to a ticketing system or
something similar, you can save the file locally and then pass that file saved on your disk to git am
to apply it:
<p>$ git am 0001-limit-log-function.patch
Applying: Add limit to log function
<p>You can see that it applied cleanly and automatically created the new commit for you. The author
information is taken from the email&rsquo;s From and Date headers, and the message of the commit is
taken from the Subject and body (before the patch) of the email. For example, if this patch was
applied from the mbox example above, the commit generated would look something like this:
<p>151</p>
<br>

<p>&nbsp; Add limit to log function
<p>&nbsp; Limit log functionality to the first 20
<p>The Commit information indicates the person who applied the patch and the time it was applied. The
Author information is the individual who originally created the patch and when it was originally
created.
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible that the patch won&rsquo;t apply cleanly. Perhaps your main branch has diverged too far
from the branch the patch was built from, or the patch depends on another patch you haven&rsquo;t
applied yet. In that case, the git am process will fail and ask you what you want to do:
<p>$ git am 0001-see-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch
Applying: See if this helps the gem
error: patch failed: ticgit.gemspec:1
error: ticgit.gemspec: patch does not apply
Patch failed at 0001.
When you have resolved this problem run "git am --resolved".
If you would prefer to skip this patch, instead run "git am --skip".
To restore the original branch and stop patching run "git am --abort".
<p>This command puts conflict markers in any files it has issues with, much like a conflicted merge or
rebase operation. You solve this issue much the same way&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;edit the file to resolve the conflict,
stage the new file, and then run git am --resolved to continue to the next patch:
<p>$ (fix the file)
$ git add ticgit.gemspec
$ git am --resolved
Applying: See if this helps the gem
<p>If you want Git to try a bit more intelligently to resolve the conflict, you can pass a -3 option to it,
which makes Git attempt a three-way merge. This option isn&rsquo;t on by default because it doesn&rsquo;t work
if the commit the patch says it was based on isn&rsquo;t in your repository. If you do have that commit&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if
the patch was based on a public commit&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;then the -3 option is generally much smarter about
applying a conflicting patch:
<p>152</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git am -3 0001-see-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch
Applying: See if this helps the gem
error: patch failed: ticgit.gemspec:1
error: ticgit.gemspec: patch does not apply
Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
No changes -- Patch already applied.
<p>In this case, without the -3 option the patch would have been considered as a conflict. Since the -3
option was used the patch applied cleanly.
<p>If you&rsquo;re applying a number of patches from an mbox, you can also run the am command in
interactive mode, which stops at each patch it finds and asks if you want to apply it:
<p>$ git am -3 -i mbox
Commit Body is:
--------------------------
See if this helps the gem
--------------------------
Apply? [y]es/[n]o/[e]dit/[v]iew patch/[a]ccept all
<p>This is nice if you have a number of patches saved, because you can view the patch first if you don&rsquo;t
remember what it is, or not apply the patch if you&rsquo;ve already done so.
<p>When all the patches for your topic are applied and committed into your branch, you can choose
whether and how to integrate them into a longer-running branch.
<p>Checking Out Remote Branches
<p>If your contribution came from a Git user who set up their own repository, pushed a number of
changes into it, and then sent you the URL to the repository and the name of the remote branch the
changes are in, you can add them as a remote and do merges locally.
<p>For instance, if Jessica sends you an email saying that she has a great new feature in the ruby-client
branch of her repository, you can test it by adding the remote and checking out that branch locally:
<p>$ git remote add jessica git://github.com/jessica/myproject.git
$ git fetch jessica
$ git checkout -b rubyclient jessica/ruby-client
<p>If she emails you again later with another branch containing another great feature, you could
directly fetch and checkout because you already have the remote setup.
<p>This is most useful if you&rsquo;re working with a person consistently. If someone only has a single patch
to contribute once in a while, then accepting it over email may be less time consuming than
requiring everyone to run their own server and having to continually add and remove remotes to
get a few patches. You&rsquo;re also unlikely to want to have hundreds of remotes, each for someone who
<p>153</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>contributes only a patch or two. However, scripts and hosted services may make this easier&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it
depends largely on how you develop and how your contributors develop.
<p>The other advantage of this approach is that you get the history of the commits as well. Although
you may have legitimate merge issues, you know where in your history their work is based; a
proper three-way merge is the default rather than having to supply a -3 and hope the patch was
generated off a public commit to which you have access.
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t working with a person consistently but still want to pull from them in this way, you
can provide the URL of the remote repository to the git pull command. This does a one-time pull
and doesn&rsquo;t save the URL as a remote reference:
<p>$ git pull https://github.com/onetimeguy/project
From https://github.com/onetimeguy/project
&nbsp;* branch HEAD -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
<p>Determining What Is Introduced
<p>Now you have a topic branch that contains contributed work. At this point, you can determine what
you&rsquo;d like to do with it. This section revisits a couple of commands so you can see how you can use
them to review exactly what you&rsquo;ll be introducing if you merge this into your main branch.
<p>It&rsquo;s often helpful to get a review of all the commits that are in this branch but that aren&rsquo;t in your
master branch. You can exclude commits in the master branch by adding the --not option before the
branch name. This does the same thing as the master..contrib format that we used earlier. For
example, if your contributor sends you two patches and you create a branch called contrib and
applied those patches there, you can run this:
<p>$ git log contrib --not master

<p>commit 7482e0d16d04bea79d0dba8988cc78df655f16a0
Author: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
Date: Mon Oct 22 19:38:36 2008 -0700
<p>&nbsp; Update gemspec to hopefully work better
<p>To see what changes each commit introduces, remember that you can pass the -p option to git log
and it will append the diff introduced to each commit.
<p>To see a full diff of what would happen if you were to merge this topic branch with another branch,
you may have to use a weird trick to get the correct results. You may think to run this:
<p>154</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git diff master
<p>This command gives you a diff, but it may be misleading. If your master branch has moved forward
since you created the topic branch from it, then you&rsquo;ll get seemingly strange results. This happens
because Git directly compares the snapshots of the last commit of the topic branch you&rsquo;re on and
the snapshot of the last commit on the master branch. For example, if you&rsquo;ve added a line in a file on
the master branch, a direct comparison of the snapshots will look like the topic branch is going to
remove that line.
<p>If master is a direct ancestor of your topic branch, this isn&rsquo;t a problem; but if the two histories have
diverged, the diff will look like you&rsquo;re adding all the new stuff in your topic branch and removing
everything unique to the master branch.
<p>What you really want to see are the changes added to the topic branch&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the work you&rsquo;ll introduce
if you merge this branch with master. You do that by having Git compare the last commit on your
topic branch with the first common ancestor it has with the master branch.
<p>Technically, you can do that by explicitly figuring out the common ancestor and then running your
diff on it:
<p>$ git merge-base contrib master
36c7dba2c95e6bbb78dfa822519ecfec6e1ca649
$ git diff 36c7db
<p>or, more concisely:
<p>$ git diff $(git merge-base contrib master)
<p>However, neither of those is particularly convenient, so Git provides another shorthand for doing
the same thing: the triple-dot syntax. In the context of the git diff command, you can put three
periods after another branch to do a diff between the last commit of the branch you&rsquo;re on and its
common ancestor with another branch:
<p>$ git diff master...contrib
<p>This command shows you only the work your current topic branch has introduced since its
common ancestor with master. That is a very useful syntax to remember.
<p>Integrating Contributed Work
<p>When all the work in your topic branch is ready to be integrated into a more mainline branch, the
question is how to do it. Furthermore, what overall workflow do you want to use to maintain your
project? You have a number of choices, so we&rsquo;ll cover a few of them.
<p>155</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Merging Workflows
<p>One basic workflow is to simply merge all that work directly into your master branch. In this
scenario, you have a master branch that contains basically stable code. When you have work in a
topic branch that you think you&rsquo;ve completed, or work that someone else has contributed and
you&rsquo;ve verified, you merge it into your master branch, delete that just-merged topic branch, and
repeat.
<p>For instance, if we have a repository with work in two branches named ruby_client and php_client
that looks like History with several topic branches., and we merge ruby_client followed by
php_client, your history will end up looking like After a topic branch merge..
<p>Figure 73. History with several topic branches.
<p>Figure 74. After a topic branch merge.
<p>That is probably the simplest workflow, but it can possibly be problematic if you&rsquo;re dealing with
larger or more stable projects where you want to be really careful about what you introduce.
<p>If you have a more important project, you might want to use a two-phase merge cycle. In this
scenario, you have two long-running branches, master and develop, in which you determine that
master is updated only when a very stable release is cut and all new code is integrated into the
develop branch. You regularly push both of these branches to the public repository. Each time you
have a new topic branch to merge in (Before a topic branch merge.), you merge it into develop
(After a topic branch merge.); then, when you tag a release, you fast-forward master to wherever the
<p>156</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>now-stable develop branch is (After a project release.).
<p>Figure 75. Before a topic branch merge.
<p>Figure 76. After a topic branch merge.
<p>Figure 77. After a project release.
<p>This way, when people clone your project&rsquo;s repository, they can either check out master to build the
latest stable version and keep up to date on that easily, or they can check out develop, which is the
more cutting-edge content. You can also extend this concept by having an integrate branch where
<p>157</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>all the work is merged together. Then, when the codebase on that branch is stable and passes tests,
you merge it into a develop branch; and when that has proven itself stable for a while, you fast-
forward your master branch.
<p>Large-Merging Workflows
<p>The Git project has four long-running branches: master, next, and pu (proposed updates) for new
work, and maint for maintenance backports. When new work is introduced by contributors, it&rsquo;s
collected into topic branches in the maintainer&rsquo;s repository in a manner similar to what we&rsquo;ve
described (see Managing a complex series of parallel contributed topic branches.). At this point, the
topics are evaluated to determine whether they&rsquo;re safe and ready for consumption or whether they
need more work. If they&rsquo;re safe, they&rsquo;re merged into next, and that branch is pushed up so everyone
can try the topics integrated together.
<p>Figure 78. Managing a complex series of parallel contributed topic branches.
<p>If the topics still need work, they&rsquo;re merged into pu instead. When it&rsquo;s determined that they&rsquo;re
totally stable, the topics are re-merged into master. The next and pu branches are then rebuilt from
the master. This means master almost always moves forward, next is rebased occasionally, and pu is
rebased even more often:
<p>158</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 79. Merging contributed topic branches into long-term integration branches.
<p>When a topic branch has finally been merged into master, it&rsquo;s removed from the repository. The Git
project also has a maint branch that is forked off from the last release to provide backported
patches in case a maintenance release is required. Thus, when you clone the Git repository, you
have four branches that you can check out to evaluate the project in different stages of
development, depending on how cutting edge you want to be or how you want to contribute; and
the maintainer has a structured workflow to help them vet new contributions. The Git project&rsquo;s
workflow is specialized. To clearly understand this you could check out the Git Maintainer&rsquo;s guide.
<p>Rebasing and Cherry-Picking Workflows
<p>Other maintainers prefer to rebase or cherry-pick contributed work on top of their master branch,
rather than merging it in, to keep a mostly linear history. When you have work in a topic branch
and have determined that you want to integrate it, you move to that branch and run the rebase
command to rebuild the changes on top of your current master (or develop, and so on) branch. If
that works well, you can fast-forward your master branch, and you&rsquo;ll end up with a linear project
history.
<p>The other way to move introduced work from one branch to another is to cherry-pick it. A cherry-
pick in Git is like a rebase for a single commit. It takes the patch that was introduced in a commit
and tries to reapply it on the branch you&rsquo;re currently on. This is useful if you have a number of
commits on a topic branch and you want to integrate only one of them, or if you only have one
commit on a topic branch and you&rsquo;d prefer to cherry-pick it rather than run rebase. For example,
suppose you have a project that looks like this:
<p>159</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt">https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 80. Example history before a cherry-pick.
<p>If you want to pull commit e43a6 into your master branch, you can run
<p>$ git cherry-pick e43a6
Finished one cherry-pick.
[master]: created a0a41a9: "More friendly message when locking the index fails."
&nbsp;3 files changed, 17 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
<p>This pulls the same change introduced in e43a6, but you get a new commit SHA-1 value, because the
date applied is different. Now your history looks like this:
<p>Figure 81. History after cherry-picking a commit on a topic branch.
<p>Now you can remove your topic branch and drop the commits you didn&rsquo;t want to pull in.
<p>160</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rerere
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing lots of merging and rebasing, or you&rsquo;re maintaining a long-lived topic branch, Git
has a feature called &ldquo;rerere&rdquo; that can help.
<p>Rerere stands for &ldquo;reuse recorded resolution&rdquo;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s a way of shortcutting manual conflict
resolution. When rerere is enabled, Git will keep a set of pre- and post-images from successful
merges, and if it notices that there&rsquo;s a conflict that looks exactly like one you&rsquo;ve already fixed, it&rsquo;ll
just use the fix from last time, without bothering you with it.
<p>This feature comes in two parts: a configuration setting and a command. The configuration setting
is rerere.enabled, and it&rsquo;s handy enough to put in your global config:
<p>$ git config --global rerere.enabled true
<p>Now, whenever you do a merge that resolves conflicts, the resolution will be recorded in the cache
in case you need it in the future.
<p>If you need to, you can interact with the rerere cache using the git rerere command. When it&rsquo;s
invoked alone, Git checks its database of resolutions and tries to find a match with any current
merge conflicts and resolve them (although this is done automatically if rerere.enabled is set to
true). There are also subcommands to see what will be recorded, to erase specific resolution from
the cache, and to clear the entire cache. We will cover rerere in more detail in Rerere.
<p>Tagging Your Releases
<p>When you&rsquo;ve decided to cut a release, you&rsquo;ll probably want to assign a tag so you can re-create that
release at any point going forward. You can create a new tag as discussed in Git Basics. If you decide
to sign the tag as the maintainer, the tagging may look something like this:
<p>$ git tag -s v1.5 -m 'my signed 1.5 tag'
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;"
1024-bit DSA key, ID F721C45A, created 2009-02-09
<p>If you do sign your tags, you may have the problem of distributing the public PGP key used to sign
your tags. The maintainer of the Git project has solved this issue by including their public key as a
blob in the repository and then adding a tag that points directly to that content. To do this, you can
figure out which key you want by running gpg --list-keys:
<p>$ gpg --list-keys
/Users/schacon/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
---------------------------------
pub 1024D/F721C45A 2009-02-09 [expires: 2010-02-09]
uid Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
sub 2048g/45D02282 2009-02-09 [expires: 2010-02-09]
<p>161</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Then, you can directly import the key into the Git database by exporting it and piping that through
git hash-object, which writes a new blob with those contents into Git and gives you back the SHA-1
of the blob:
<p>$ gpg -a --export F721C45A | git hash-object -w --stdin
659ef797d181633c87ec71ac3f9ba29fe5775b92
<p>Now that you have the contents of your key in Git, you can create a tag that points directly to it by
specifying the new SHA-1 value that the hash-object command gave you:
<p>$ git tag -a maintainer-pgp-pub 659ef797d181633c87ec71ac3f9ba29fe5775b92
<p>If you run git push --tags, the maintainer-pgp-pub tag will be shared with everyone. If anyone
wants to verify a tag, they can directly import your PGP key by pulling the blob directly out of the
database and importing it into GPG:
<p>$ git show maintainer-pgp-pub | gpg --import
<p>They can use that key to verify all your signed tags. Also, if you include instructions in the tag
message, running git show &lt;tag&gt; will let you give the end user more specific instructions about tag
verification.
<p>Generating a Build Number
<p>Because Git doesn&rsquo;t have monotonically increasing numbers like v123 or the equivalent to go with
each commit, if you want to have a human-readable name to go with a commit, you can run git
describe on that commit. In response, Git generates a string consisting of the name of the most
recent tag earlier than that commit, followed by the number of commits since that tag, followed
finally by a partial SHA-1 value of the commit being described (prefixed with the letter "g" meaning
Git):
<p>$ git describe master
v1.6.2-rc1-20-g8c5b85c
<p>This way, you can export a snapshot or build and name it something understandable to people. In
fact, if you build Git from source code cloned from the Git repository, git --version gives you
something that looks like this. If you&rsquo;re describing a commit that you have directly tagged, it gives
you simply the tag name.
<p>By default, the git describe command requires annotated tags (tags created with the -a or -s flag);
if you want to take advantage of lightweight (non-annotated) tags as well, add the --tags option to
the command. You can also use this string as the target of a git checkout or git show command,
although it relies on the abbreviated SHA-1 value at the end, so it may not be valid forever. For
instance, the Linux kernel recently jumped from 8 to 10 characters to ensure SHA-1 object
uniqueness, so older git describe output names were invalidated.

<p>Preparing a Release
<p>Now you want to release a build. One of the things you&rsquo;ll want to do is create an archive of the
latest snapshot of your code for those poor souls who don&rsquo;t use Git. The command to do this is git
archive:
<p>$ git archive master --prefix='project/' | gzip &gt; `git describe master`.tar.gz
$ ls *.tar.gz
v1.6.2-rc1-20-g8c5b85c.tar.gz
<p>If someone opens that tarball, they get the latest snapshot of your project under a project directory.
You can also create a zip archive in much the same way, but by passing the --format=zip option to
git archive:
<p>$ git archive master --prefix='project/' --format=zip &gt; `git describe master`.zip
<p>You now have a nice tarball and a zip archive of your project release that you can upload to your
website or email to people.
<p>The Shortlog
<p>It&rsquo;s time to email your mailing list of people who want to know what&rsquo;s happening in your project. A
nice way of quickly getting a sort of changelog of what has been added to your project since your
last release or email is to use the git shortlog command. It summarizes all the commits in the
range you give it; for example, the following gives you a summary of all the commits since your last
release, if your last release was named v1.0.1:
<p>$ git shortlog --no-merges master --not v1.0.1
Chris Wanstrath (6):
&nbsp; Add support for annotated tags to Grit::Tag
&nbsp; Add packed-refs annotated tag support.
&nbsp; Add Grit::Commit#to_patch
&nbsp; Update version and History.txt
&nbsp; Remove stray `puts`
&nbsp; Make ls_tree ignore nils
<p>Tom Preston-Werner (4):
&nbsp; fix dates in history
&nbsp; dynamic version method
&nbsp; Version bump to 1.0.2
&nbsp; Regenerated gemspec for version 1.0.2
<p>You get a clean summary of all the commits since v1.0.1, grouped by author, that you can email to
your list.

<p>Summary
You should feel fairly comfortable contributing to a project in Git as well as maintaining your own
project or integrating other users' contributions. Congratulations on being an effective Git
developer! In the next chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn about how to use the largest and most popular Git
hosting service, GitHub.
<p>164</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>GitHub
GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for
millions of developers and projects. A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub,
and many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things.
So while it&rsquo;s not a direct part of the Git open source project, there&rsquo;s a good chance that you&rsquo;ll want
or need to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally.
<p>This chapter is about using GitHub effectively. We&rsquo;ll cover signing up for and managing an account,
creating and using Git repositories, common workflows to contribute to projects and to accept
contributions to yours, GitHub&rsquo;s programmatic interface and lots of little tips to make your life
easier in general.
<p>If you are not interested in using GitHub to host your own projects or to collaborate with other
projects that are hosted on GitHub, you can safely skip to Git Tools.
<p>
<p>Interfaces Change
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that like many active websites, the UI elements in these
screenshots are bound to change over time. Hopefully the general idea of what
we&rsquo;re trying to accomplish here will still be there, but if you want more up to date
versions of these screens, the online versions of this book may have newer
screenshots.
<p>Account Setup and Configuration
The first thing you need to do is set up a free user account. Simply visit https://github.com, choose a
user name that isn&rsquo;t already taken, provide an email address and a password, and click the big
green &ldquo;Sign up for GitHub&rdquo; button.
<p>165</p>

<p>Figure 82. The GitHub sign-up form.
<p>The next thing you&rsquo;ll see is the pricing page for upgraded plans, but it&rsquo;s safe to ignore this for now.
GitHub will send you an email to verify the address you provided. Go ahead and do this; it&rsquo;s pretty
important (as we&rsquo;ll see later).
<p>
<p>GitHub provides almost all of its functionality with free accounts, except some
advanced features.
<p>GitHub&rsquo;s paid plans include advanced tools and features as well as increased limits
for free services, but we won&rsquo;t be covering those in this book. To get more
information about available plans and their comparison, visit https://github.com/
pricing.
<p>Clicking the Octocat logo at the top-left of the screen will take you to your dashboard page. You&rsquo;re
now ready to use GitHub.
<p>SSH Access
<p>As of right now, you&rsquo;re fully able to connect with Git repositories using the https:// protocol,
authenticating with the username and password you just set up. However, to simply clone public
projects, you don&rsquo;t even need to sign up - the account we just created comes into play when we fork
projects and push to our forks a bit later.
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to use SSH remotes, you&rsquo;ll need to configure a public key. (If you don&rsquo;t already have

<p>one, see Generating Your SSH Public Key.) Open up your account settings using the link at the top-
right of the window:
<p>Figure 83. The &ldquo;Account settings&rdquo; link.
<p>Then select the &ldquo;SSH keys&rdquo; section along the left-hand side.
<p>Figure 84. The &ldquo;SSH keys&rdquo; link.
<p>From there, click the "Add an SSH key" button, give your key a name, paste the contents of your
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (or whatever you named it) public-key file into the text area, and click &ldquo;Add key&rdquo;.
<p>
Be sure to name your SSH key something you can remember. You can name each
of your keys (e.g. "My Laptop" or "Work Account") so that if you need to revoke a
key later, you can easily tell which one you&rsquo;re looking for.
<p>Your Avatar
<p>Next, if you wish, you can replace the avatar that is generated for you with an image of your
choosing. First go to the &ldquo;Profile&rdquo; tab (above the SSH Keys tab) and click &ldquo;Upload new picture&rdquo;.

<p>We&rsquo;ll choose a copy of the Git logo that is on our hard drive and then we get a chance to crop it.
<p>Figure 86. Crop your avatar
<p>Now anywhere you interact on the site, people will see your avatar next to your username.
<p>If you happen to have uploaded an avatar to the popular Gravatar service (often used for
Wordpress accounts), that avatar will be used by default and you don&rsquo;t need to do this step.

</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Your Email Addresses
<p>The way that GitHub maps your Git commits to your user is by email address. If you use multiple
email addresses in your commits and you want GitHub to link them up properly, you need to add
all the email addresses you have used to the Emails section of the admin section.
<p>Figure 87. Add email addresses
<p>In Add email addresses we can see some of the different states that are possible. The top address is
verified and set as the primary address, meaning that is where you&rsquo;ll get any notifications and
receipts. The second address is verified and so can be set as the primary if you wish to switch them.
The final address is unverified, meaning that you can&rsquo;t make it your primary address. If GitHub
sees any of these in commit messages in any repository on the site, it will be linked to your user
now.
<p>Two Factor Authentication
<p>Finally, for extra security, you should definitely set up Two-factor Authentication or &ldquo;2FA&rdquo;. Two-
factor Authentication is an authentication mechanism that is becoming more and more popular
recently to mitigate the risk of your account being compromised if your password is stolen
somehow. Turning it on will make GitHub ask you for two different methods of authentication, so
that if one of them is compromised, an attacker will not be able to access your account.
<p>You can find the Two-factor Authentication setup under the Security tab of your Account settings.
<p>169</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 88. 2FA in the Security Tab
<p>If you click on the &ldquo;Set up two-factor authentication&rdquo; button, it will take you to a configuration page
where you can choose to use a phone app to generate your secondary code (a &ldquo;time based one-time
password&rdquo;), or you can have GitHub send you a code via SMS each time you need to log in.
<p>After you choose which method you prefer and follow the instructions for setting up 2FA, your
account will then be a little more secure and you will have to provide a code in addition to your
password whenever you log into GitHub.
<p>Contributing to a Project
Now that our account is set up, let&rsquo;s walk through some details that could be useful in helping you
contribute to an existing project.
<p>Forking Projects
<p>If you want to contribute to an existing project to which you don&rsquo;t have push access, you can &ldquo;fork&rdquo;
the project. When you &ldquo;fork&rdquo; a project, GitHub will make a copy of the project that is entirely yours;
it lives in your namespace, and you can push to it.
<p>
<p>Historically, the term &ldquo;fork&rdquo; has been somewhat negative in context, meaning that
someone took an open source project in a different direction, sometimes creating a
competing project and splitting the contributors. In GitHub, a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; is simply the
same project in your own namespace, allowing you to make changes to a project
publicly as a way to contribute in a more open manner.
<p>This way, projects don&rsquo;t have to worry about adding users as collaborators to give them push
access. People can fork a project, push to it, and contribute their changes back to the original
repository by creating what&rsquo;s called a Pull Request, which we&rsquo;ll cover next. This opens up a
discussion thread with code review, and the owner and the contributor can then communicate
<p>170</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>about the change until the owner is happy with it, at which point the owner can merge it in.
<p>To fork a project, visit the project page and click the &ldquo;Fork&rdquo; button at the top-right of the page.
<p>Figure 89. The &ldquo;Fork&rdquo; button.
<p>After a few seconds, you&rsquo;ll be taken to your new project page, with your own writeable copy of the
code.
<p>The GitHub Flow
<p>GitHub is designed around a particular collaboration workflow, centered on Pull Requests. This
flow works whether you&rsquo;re collaborating with a tightly-knit team in a single shared repository, or a
globally-distributed company or network of strangers contributing to a project through dozens of
forks. It is centered on the Topic Branches workflow covered in Git Branching.
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it generally works:
<p>1. Fork the project
<p>2. Create a topic branch from master.
<p>3. Make some commits to improve the project.
<p>4. Push this branch to your GitHub project.
<p>5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
<p>6. Discuss, and optionally continue committing.
<p>7. The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.
<p>8. Sync the updated master back to your fork.
<p>This is basically the Integration Manager workflow covered in Integration-Manager Workflow, but
instead of using email to communicate and review changes, teams use GitHub&rsquo;s web based tools.
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through an example of proposing a change to an open source project hosted on GitHub
using this flow.
<p>Creating a Pull Request
<p>Tony is looking for code to run on his Arduino programmable microcontroller and has found a
great program file on GitHub at https://github.com/schacon/blink.

<p>The only problem is that the blinking rate is too fast. We think it&rsquo;s much nicer to wait 3 seconds
instead of 1 in between each state change. So let&rsquo;s improve the program and submit it back to the
project as a proposed change.
<p>First, we click the Fork button as mentioned earlier to get our own copy of the project. Our user
name here is &ldquo;tonychacon&rdquo; so our copy of this project is at https://github.com/tonychacon/blink and
that&rsquo;s where we can edit it. We will clone it locally, create a topic branch, make the code change and
finally push that change back up to GitHub.

<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>topic branch up and presents us with a big green button to check out our changes and open a Pull
Request to the original project.
<p>You can alternatively go to the &ldquo;Branches&rdquo; page at https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/branches to
locate your branch and open a new Pull Request from there.
<p>Figure 91. Pull Request button
<p>If we click that green button, we&rsquo;ll see a screen that asks us to give our Pull Request a title and
description. It is almost always worthwhile to put some effort into this, since a good description
helps the owner of the original project determine what you were trying to do, whether your
proposed changes are correct, and whether accepting the changes would improve the original
project.
<p>We also see a list of the commits in our topic branch that are &ldquo;ahead&rdquo; of the master branch (in this
case, just the one) and a unified diff of all the changes that will be made should this branch get
merged by the project owner.
<p>174</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 92. Pull Request creation page
<p>When you hit the Create pull request button on this screen, the owner of the project you forked will
get a notification that someone is suggesting a change and will link to a page that has all of this
information on it.
<p>
<p>Though Pull Requests are used commonly for public projects like this when the
contributor has a complete change ready to be made, it&rsquo;s also often used in
internal projects at the beginning of the development cycle. Since you can keep
pushing to the topic branch even after the Pull Request is opened, it&rsquo;s often
opened early and used as a way to iterate on work as a team within a context,
rather than opened at the very end of the process.
<p>Iterating on a Pull Request
<p>At this point, the project owner can look at the suggested change and merge it, reject it or comment
on it. Let&rsquo;s say that he likes the idea, but would prefer a slightly longer time for the light to be off
than on.
<p>175</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Where this conversation may take place over email in the workflows presented in Distributed Git,
on GitHub this happens online. The project owner can review the unified diff and leave a comment
by clicking on any of the lines.
<p>Figure 93. Comment on a specific line of code in a Pull Request
<p>Once the maintainer makes this comment, the person who opened the Pull Request (and indeed,
anyone else watching the repository) will get a notification. We&rsquo;ll go over customizing this later, but
if he had email notifications turned on, Tony would get an email like this:
<p>Figure 94. Comments sent as email notifications
<p>Anyone can also leave general comments on the Pull Request. In Pull Request discussion page we
can see an example of the project owner both commenting on a line of code and then leaving a
general comment in the discussion section. You can see that the code comments are brought into
the conversation as well.
<p>176</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 95. Pull Request discussion page
<p>Now the contributor can see what they need to do in order to get their change accepted. Luckily this
is very straightforward. Where over email you may have to re-roll your series and resubmit it to
the mailing list, with GitHub you simply commit to the topic branch again and push, which will
automatically update the Pull Request. In Pull Request final you can also see that the old code
comment has been collapsed in the updated Pull Request, since it was made on a line that has since
been changed.
<p>Adding commits to an existing Pull Request doesn&rsquo;t trigger a notification, so once Tony has pushed
his corrections he decides to leave a comment to inform the project owner that he made the
requested change.
<p>177</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 96. Pull Request final
<p>An interesting thing to notice is that if you click on the &ldquo;Files Changed&rdquo; tab on this Pull Request,
you&rsquo;ll get the &ldquo;unified&rdquo; diff&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that is, the total aggregate difference that would be introduced to your
main branch if this topic branch was merged in. In git diff terms, it basically automatically shows
you git diff master...&lt;branch&gt; for the branch this Pull Request is based on. See Determining What
Is Introduced for more about this type of diff.
<p>The other thing you&rsquo;ll notice is that GitHub checks to see if the Pull Request merges cleanly and
provides a button to do the merge for you on the server. This button only shows up if you have
write access to the repository and a trivial merge is possible. If you click it GitHub will perform a
&ldquo;non-fast-forward&rdquo; merge, meaning that even if the merge could be a fast-forward, it will still
create a merge commit.
<p>If you would prefer, you can simply pull the branch down and merge it locally. If you merge this
<p>178</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>branch into the master branch and push it to GitHub, the Pull Request will automatically be closed.
<p>This is the basic workflow that most GitHub projects use. Topic branches are created, Pull Requests
are opened on them, a discussion ensues, possibly more work is done on the branch and eventually
the request is either closed or merged.
<p>
<p>Not Only Forks
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that you can also open a Pull Request between two branches
in the same repository. If you&rsquo;re working on a feature with someone and you both
have write access to the project, you can push a topic branch to the repository and
open a Pull Request on it to the master branch of that same project to initiate the
code review and discussion process. No forking necessary.
<p>Advanced Pull Requests
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered the basics of contributing to a project on GitHub, let&rsquo;s cover a few
interesting tips and tricks about Pull Requests so you can be more effective in using them.
<p>Pull Requests as Patches
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that many projects don&rsquo;t really think of Pull Requests as queues of
perfect patches that should apply cleanly in order, as most mailing list-based projects think of patch
series contributions. Most GitHub projects think about Pull Request branches as iterative
conversations around a proposed change, culminating in a unified diff that is applied by merging.
<p>This is an important distinction, because generally the change is suggested before the code is
thought to be perfect, which is far more rare with mailing list based patch series contributions. This
enables an earlier conversation with the maintainers so that arriving at the proper solution is more
of a community effort. When code is proposed with a Pull Request and the maintainers or
community suggest a change, the patch series is generally not re-rolled, but instead the difference is
pushed as a new commit to the branch, moving the conversation forward with the context of the
previous work intact.
<p>For instance, if you go back and look again at Pull Request final, you&rsquo;ll notice that the contributor
did not rebase his commit and send another Pull Request. Instead they added new commits and
pushed them to the existing branch. This way if you go back and look at this Pull Request in the
future, you can easily find all of the context of why decisions were made. Pushing the &ldquo;Merge&rdquo;
button on the site purposefully creates a merge commit that references the Pull Request so that it&rsquo;s
easy to go back and research the original conversation if necessary.
<p>Keeping up with Upstream
<p>If your Pull Request becomes out of date or otherwise doesn&rsquo;t merge cleanly, you will want to fix it
so the maintainer can easily merge it. GitHub will test this for you and let you know at the bottom
of every Pull Request if the merge is trivial or not.
<p>179</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 97. Pull Request does not merge cleanly
<p>If you see something like Pull Request does not merge cleanly, you&rsquo;ll want to fix your branch so that
it turns green and the maintainer doesn&rsquo;t have to do extra work.
<p>You have two main options in order to do this. You can either rebase your branch on top of
whatever the target branch is (normally the master branch of the repository you forked), or you can
merge the target branch into your branch.
<p>Most developers on GitHub will choose to do the latter, for the same reasons we just went over in
the previous section. What matters is the history and the final merge, so rebasing isn&rsquo;t getting you
much other than a slightly cleaner history and in return is far more difficult and error prone.
<p>If you want to merge in the target branch to make your Pull Request mergeable, you would add the
original repository as a new remote, fetch from it, merge the main branch of that repository into
your topic branch, fix any issues and finally push it back up to the same branch you opened the Pull
Request on.
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that in the &ldquo;tonychacon&rdquo; example we were using before, the original author
made a change that would create a conflict in the Pull Request. Let&rsquo;s go through those steps.

</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 98. Pull Request now merges cleanly
<p>One of the great things about Git is that you can do that continuously. If you have a very long-
running project, you can easily merge from the target branch over and over again and only have to
deal with conflicts that have arisen since the last time that you merged, making the process very
manageable.
<p>If you absolutely wish to rebase the branch to clean it up, you can certainly do so, but it is highly
encouraged to not force push over the branch that the Pull Request is already opened on. If other
people have pulled it down and done more work on it, you run into all of the issues outlined in The
Perils of Rebasing. Instead, push the rebased branch to a new branch on GitHub and open a brand
new Pull Request referencing the old one, then close the original.
<p>References
<p>Your next question may be &ldquo;How do I reference the old Pull Request?&rdquo;. It turns out there are many,
many ways to reference other things almost anywhere you can write in GitHub.
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with how to cross-reference another Pull Request or an Issue. All Pull Requests and
Issues are assigned numbers and they are unique within the project. For example, you can&rsquo;t have
Pull Request #3 and Issue #3. If you want to reference any Pull Request or Issue from any other one,
you can simply put #&lt;num&gt; in any comment or description. You can also be more specific if the Issue
or Pull request lives somewhere else; write username#&lt;num&gt; if you&rsquo;re referring to an Issue or Pull
Request in a fork of the repository you&rsquo;re in, or username/repo#&lt;num&gt; to reference something in
another repository.
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example. Say we rebased the branch in the previous example, created a new pull
request for it, and now we want to reference the old pull request from the new one. We also want
to reference an issue in the fork of the repository and an issue in a completely different project. We
can fill out the description just like Cross references in a Pull Request..

<p>When we submit this pull request, we&rsquo;ll see all of that rendered like Cross references rendered in a
Pull Request..
<p>Figure 100. Cross references rendered in a Pull Request.
<p>Notice that the full GitHub URL we put in there was shortened to just the information needed.
<p>Now if Tony goes back and closes out the original Pull Request, we can see that by mentioning it in
the new one, GitHub has automatically created a trackback event in the Pull Request timeline. This
means that anyone who visits this Pull Request and sees that it is closed can easily link back to the
one that superseded it. The link will look something like Link back to the new Pull Request in the
closed Pull Request timeline..

<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 101. Link back to the new Pull Request in the closed Pull Request timeline.
<p>In addition to issue numbers, you can also reference a specific commit by SHA-1. You have to
specify a full 40 character SHA-1, but if GitHub sees that in a comment, it will link directly to the
commit. Again, you can reference commits in forks or other repositories in the same way you did
with issues.
<p>GitHub Flavored Markdown
<p>Linking to other Issues is just the beginning of interesting things you can do with almost any text
box on GitHub. In Issue and Pull Request descriptions, comments, code comments and more, you
can use what is called &ldquo;GitHub Flavored Markdown&rdquo;. Markdown is like writing in plain text but
which is rendered richly.
<p>See An example of GitHub Flavored Markdown as written and as rendered. for an example of how
comments or text can be written and then rendered using Markdown.
<p>Figure 102. An example of GitHub Flavored Markdown as written and as rendered.
<p>The GitHub flavor of Markdown adds more things you can do beyond the basic Markdown syntax.
These can all be really useful when creating useful Pull Request or Issue comments or descriptions.
<p>184</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Task Lists
<p>The first really useful GitHub specific Markdown feature, especially for use in Pull Requests, is the
Task List. A task list is a list of checkboxes of things you want to get done. Putting them into an Issue
or Pull Request normally indicates things that you want to get done before you consider the item
complete.
<p>You can create a task list like this:
<p>- [X] Write the code
- [ ] Write all the tests
- [ ] Document the code
<p>If we include this in the description of our Pull Request or Issue, we&rsquo;ll see it rendered like Task lists
rendered in a Markdown comment.
<p>Figure 103. Task lists rendered in a Markdown comment.
<p>This is often used in Pull Requests to indicate what all you would like to get done on the branch
before the Pull Request will be ready to merge. The really cool part is that you can simply click the
checkboxes to update the comment&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you don&rsquo;t have to edit the Markdown directly to check tasks
off.
<p>What&rsquo;s more, GitHub will look for task lists in your Issues and Pull Requests and show them as
metadata on the pages that list them out. For example, if you have a Pull Request with tasks and
you look at the overview page of all Pull Requests, you can see how far done it is. This helps people
break down Pull Requests into subtasks and helps other people track the progress of the branch.
You can see an example of this in Task list summary in the Pull Request list..
<p>Figure 104. Task list summary in the Pull Request list.
<p>These are incredibly useful when you open a Pull Request early and use it to track your progress
through the implementation of the feature.
<p>185</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Code Snippets
<p>You can also add code snippets to comments. This is especially useful if you want to present
something that you could try to do before actually implementing it as a commit on your branch.
This is also often used to add example code of what is not working or what this Pull Request could
implement.
<p>To add a snippet of code you have to &ldquo;fence&rdquo; it in backticks.
<p>```java
for(int i=0 ; i &lt; 5 ; i++)
{
&nbsp; System.out.println("i is : " + i);
}
```
<p>If you add a language name like we did there with java, GitHub will also try to syntax highlight the
snippet. In the case of the above example, it would end up rendering like Rendered fenced code
example..
<p>Figure 105. Rendered fenced code example.
<p>Quoting
<p>If you&rsquo;re responding to a small part of a long comment, you can selectively quote out of the other
comment by preceding the lines with the &gt; character. In fact, this is so common and so useful that
there is a keyboard shortcut for it. If you highlight text in a comment that you want to directly reply
to and hit the r key, it will quote that text in the comment box for you.
<p>The quotes look something like this:
<p>&gt; Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
&gt; The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
<p>How big are these slings and in particular, these arrows?
<p>Once rendered, the comment will look like Rendered quoting example..
<p>186</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 106. Rendered quoting example.
<p>Emoji
<p>Finally, you can also use emoji in your comments. This is actually used quite extensively in
comments you see on many GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. There is even an emoji helper in
GitHub. If you are typing a comment and you start with a : character, an autocompleter will help
you find what you&rsquo;re looking for.
<p>Figure 107. Emoji autocompleter in action.
<p>Emojis take the form of :&lt;name&gt;: anywhere in the comment. For instance, you could write
something like this:
<p>187</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>I :eyes: that :bug: and I :cold_sweat:.
<p>:trophy: for :microscope: it.
<p>:+1: and :sparkles: on this :ship:, it's :fire::poop:!
<p>:clap::tada::panda_face:
<p>When rendered, it would look something like Heavy emoji commenting..
<p>Figure 108. Heavy emoji commenting.
<p>Not that this is incredibly useful, but it does add an element of fun and emotion to a medium that is
otherwise hard to convey emotion in.
<p>
<p>There are actually quite a number of web services that make use of emoji
characters these days. A great cheat sheet to reference to find emoji that expresses
what you want to say can be found at:
<p>https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/
<p>Images
<p>This isn&rsquo;t technically GitHub Flavored Markdown, but it is incredibly useful. In addition to adding
Markdown image links to comments, which can be difficult to find and embed URLs for, GitHub
allows you to drag and drop images into text areas to embed them.
<p>188</p>

<p>Figure 109. Drag and drop images to upload them and auto-embed them.
<p>If you look at Drag and drop images to upload them and auto-embed them., you can see a small
&ldquo;Parsed as Markdown&rdquo; hint above the text area. Clicking on that will give you a full cheat sheet of
everything you can do with Markdown on GitHub.
<p>Keep your GitHub public repository up-to-date
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve forked a GitHub repository, your repository (your "fork") exists independently from
the original. In particular, when the original repository has new commits, GitHub informs you by a
message like:
<p>This branch is 5 commits behind progit:master.
<p>But your GitHub repository will never be automatically updated by GitHub; this is something that
you must do yourself. Fortunately, this is very easy to do.
<p>One possibility to do this requires no configuration. For example, if you forked from
https://github.com/progit/progit2.git, you can keep your master branch up-to-date like this:
<p>$ git checkout master ①
$ git pull https://github.com/progit/progit2.git ②
$ git push origin master ③
<p>① If you were on another branch, return to master.
<p>189</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>② Fetch changes from https://github.com/progit/progit2.git and merge them into master.
<p>③ Push your master branch to origin.
<p>This works, but it is a little tedious having to spell out the fetch URL every time. You can automate
this work with a bit of configuration:
<p>$ git remote add progit https://github.com/progit/progit2.git ①
$ git branch --set-upstream-to=progit/master master ②
$ git config --local remote.pushDefault origin ③
<p>① Add the source repository and give it a name. Here, I have chosen to call it progit.
<p>② Set your master branch to fetch from the progit remote.
<p>③ Define the default push repository to origin.
<p>Once this is done, the workflow becomes much simpler:
<p>$ git checkout master ①
$ git pull ②
$ git push ③
<p>① If you were on another branch, return to master.
<p>② Fetch changes from progit and merge changes into master.
<p>③ Push your master branch to origin.
<p>This approach can be useful, but it&rsquo;s not without downsides. Git will happily do this work for you
silently, but it won&rsquo;t warn you if you make a commit to master, pull from progit, then push to
origin&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;all of those operations are valid with this setup. So you&rsquo;ll have to take care never to
commit directly to master, since that branch effectively belongs to the upstream repository.
<p>Maintaining a Project
Now that we&rsquo;re comfortable contributing to a project, let&rsquo;s look at the other side: creating,
maintaining and administering your own project.
<p>Creating a New Repository
<p>Let&rsquo;s create a new repository to share our project code with. Start by clicking the &ldquo;New repository&rdquo;
button on the right-hand side of the dashboard, or from the + button in the top toolbar next to your
username as seen in The &ldquo;New repository&rdquo; dropdown..
<p>190</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 110. The &ldquo;Your repositories&rdquo; area.
<p>Figure 111. The &ldquo;New repository&rdquo; dropdown.
<p>This takes you to the &ldquo;new repository&rdquo; form:
<p>191</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 112. The &ldquo;new repository&rdquo; form.
<p>All you really have to do here is provide a project name; the rest of the fields are completely
optional. For now, just click the &ldquo;Create Repository&rdquo; button, and boom &ndash; you have a new repository
on GitHub, named &lt;user&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;.
<p>Since you have no code there yet, GitHub will show you instructions for how to create a brand-new
Git repository, or connect an existing Git project. We won&rsquo;t belabor this here; if you need a
refresher, check out Git Basics.
<p>Now that your project is hosted on GitHub, you can give the URL to anyone you want to share your
project with. Every project on GitHub is accessible over HTTPS as
https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;, and over SSH as git@github.com:&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;.
Git can fetch from and push to both of these URLs, but they are access-controlled based on the
credentials of the user connecting to them.
<p>
<p>It is often preferable to share the HTTPS based URL for a public project, since the
user does not have to have a GitHub account to access it for cloning. Users will
have to have an account and an uploaded SSH key to access your project if you
give them the SSH URL. The HTTPS one is also exactly the same URL they would
paste into a browser to view the project there.
<p>Adding Collaborators
<p>If you&rsquo;re working with other people who you want to give commit access to, you need to add them
as &ldquo;collaborators&rdquo;. If Ben, Jeff, and Louise all sign up for accounts on GitHub, and you want to give
them push access to your repository, you can add them to your project. Doing so will give them
&ldquo;push&rdquo; access, which means they have both read and write access to the project and Git repository.
<p>Click the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; link at the bottom of the right-hand sidebar.
<p>192</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 113. The repository settings link.
<p>Then select &ldquo;Collaborators&rdquo; from the menu on the left-hand side. Then, just type a username into
the box, and click &ldquo;Add collaborator.&rdquo; You can repeat this as many times as you like to grant access
to everyone you like. If you need to revoke access, just click the &ldquo;X&rdquo; on the right-hand side of their
row.
<p>Figure 114. Repository collaborators.
<p>Managing Pull Requests
<p>Now that you have a project with some code in it and maybe even a few collaborators who also
have push access, let&rsquo;s go over what to do when you get a Pull Request yourself.
<p>Pull Requests can either come from a branch in a fork of your repository or they can come from
another branch in the same repository. The only difference is that the ones in a fork are often from
people where you can&rsquo;t push to their branch and they can&rsquo;t push to yours, whereas with internal
Pull Requests generally both parties can access the branch.
<p>193</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>For these examples, let&rsquo;s assume you are &ldquo;tonychacon&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ve created a new Arduino code
project named &ldquo;fade&rdquo;.
<p>Email Notifications
<p>Someone comes along and makes a change to your code and sends you a Pull Request. You should
get an email notifying you about the new Pull Request and it should look something like Email
notification of a new Pull Request..
<p>Figure 115. Email notification of a new Pull Request.
<p>There are a few things to notice about this email. It will give you a small diffstat&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a list of files that
have changed in the Pull Request and by how much. It gives you a link to the Pull Request on
GitHub. It also gives you a few URLs that you can use from the command line.
<p>If you notice the line that says git pull &lt;url&gt; patch-1, this is a simple way to merge in a remote
branch without having to add a remote. We went over this quickly in Checking Out Remote
Branches. If you wish, you can create and switch to a topic branch and then run this command to
merge in the Pull Request changes.
<p>The other interesting URLs are the .diff and .patch URLs, which as you may guess, provide unified
diff and patch versions of the Pull Request. You could technically merge in the Pull Request work
with something like this:
<p>$ curl https://github.com/tonychacon/fade/pull/1.patch | git am
<p>194</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Collaborating on the Pull Request
<p>As we covered in The GitHub Flow, you can now have a conversation with the person who opened
the Pull Request. You can comment on specific lines of code, comment on whole commits or
comment on the entire Pull Request itself, using GitHub Flavored Markdown everywhere.
<p>Every time someone else comments on the Pull Request you will continue to get email notifications
so you know there is activity happening. They will each have a link to the Pull Request where the
activity is happening and you can also directly respond to the email to comment on the Pull Request
thread.
<p>Figure 116. Responses to emails are included in the thread.
<p>Once the code is in a place you like and want to merge it in, you can either pull the code down and
merge it locally, either with the git pull &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt; syntax we saw earlier, or by adding the
fork as a remote and fetching and merging.
<p>If the merge is trivial, you can also just hit the &ldquo;Merge&rdquo; button on the GitHub site. This will do a
&ldquo;non-fast-forward&rdquo; merge, creating a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge was possible. This
means that no matter what, every time you hit the merge button, a merge commit is created. As you
can see in Merge button and instructions for merging a Pull Request manually., GitHub gives you all
of this information if you click the hint link.
<p>195</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 117. Merge button and instructions for merging a Pull Request manually.
<p>If you decide you don&rsquo;t want to merge it, you can also just close the Pull Request and the person
who opened it will be notified.
<p>Pull Request Refs
<p>If you&rsquo;re dealing with a lot of Pull Requests and don&rsquo;t want to add a bunch of remotes or do one
time pulls every time, there is a neat trick that GitHub allows you to do. This is a bit of an advanced
trick and we&rsquo;ll go over the details of this a bit more in The Refspec, but it can be pretty useful.
<p>GitHub actually advertises the Pull Request branches for a repository as sort of pseudo-branches on
the server. By default you don&rsquo;t get them when you clone, but they are there in an obscured way
and you can access them pretty easily.
<p>To demonstrate this, we&rsquo;re going to use a low-level command (often referred to as a &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo;
command, which we&rsquo;ll read about more in Plumbing and Porcelain) called ls-remote. This
command is generally not used in day-to-day Git operations but it&rsquo;s useful to show us what
references are present on the server.
<p>If we run this command against the &ldquo;blink&rdquo; repository we were using earlier, we will get a list of all
the branches and tags and other references in the repository.
<p>196</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git ls-remote https://github.com/schacon/blink
10d539600d86723087810ec636870a504f4fee4d HEAD
10d539600d86723087810ec636870a504f4fee4d refs/heads/master
6a83107c62950be9453aac297bb0193fd743cd6e refs/pull/1/head
afe83c2d1a70674c9505cc1d8b7d380d5e076ed3 refs/pull/1/merge
3c8d735ee16296c242be7a9742ebfbc2665adec1 refs/pull/2/head
15c9f4f80973a2758462ab2066b6ad9fe8dcf03d refs/pull/2/merge
a5a7751a33b7e86c5e9bb07b26001bb17d775d1a refs/pull/4/head
31a45fc257e8433c8d8804e3e848cf61c9d3166c refs/pull/4/merge
<p>Of course, if you&rsquo;re in your repository and you run git ls-remote origin or whatever remote you
want to check, it will show you something similar to this.
<p>If the repository is on GitHub and you have any Pull Requests that have been opened, you&rsquo;ll get
these references that are prefixed with refs/pull/. These are basically branches, but since they&rsquo;re
not under refs/heads/ you don&rsquo;t get them normally when you clone or fetch from the server&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the
process of fetching ignores them normally.
<p>There are two references per Pull Request - the one that ends in /head points to exactly the same
commit as the last commit in the Pull Request branch. So if someone opens a Pull Request in our
repository and their branch is named bug-fix and it points to commit a5a775, then in our repository
we will not have a bug-fix branch (since that&rsquo;s in their fork), but we will have pull/&lt;pr#&gt;/head that
points to a5a775. This means that we can pretty easily pull down every Pull Request branch in one
go without having to add a bunch of remotes.
<p>Now, you could do something like fetching the reference directly.
<p>$ git fetch origin refs/pull/958/head
From https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
&nbsp;* branch refs/pull/958/head -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
<p>This tells Git, &ldquo;Connect to the origin remote, and download the ref named refs/pull/958/head.&rdquo; Git
happily obeys, and downloads everything you need to construct that ref, and puts a pointer to the
commit you want under .git/FETCH_HEAD. You can follow that up with git merge FETCH_HEAD into a
branch you want to test it in, but that merge commit message looks a bit weird. Also, if you&rsquo;re
reviewing a lot of pull requests, this gets tedious.
<p>There&rsquo;s also a way to fetch all of the pull requests, and keep them up to date whenever you connect
to the remote. Open up .git/config in your favorite editor, and look for the origin remote. It should
look a bit like this:
<p>[remote "origin"]
&nbsp; url = https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
&nbsp; fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
<p>That line that begins with fetch = is a &ldquo;refspec.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a way of mapping names on the remote with
names in your local .git directory. This particular one tells Git, "the things on the remote that are
<p>197</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>under refs/heads should go in my local repository under refs/remotes/origin." You can modify this
section to add another refspec:
<p>[remote "origin"]
&nbsp; url = https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git
&nbsp; fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
&nbsp; fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
<p>That last line tells Git, &ldquo;All the refs that look like refs/pull/123/head should be stored locally like
refs/remotes/origin/pr/123.&rdquo; Now, if you save that file, and do a git fetch:
<p>$ git fetch
# &hellip;
&nbsp;* [new ref] refs/pull/1/head -&gt; origin/pr/1
&nbsp;* [new ref] refs/pull/2/head -&gt; origin/pr/2
&nbsp;* [new ref] refs/pull/4/head -&gt; origin/pr/4
# &hellip;
<p>Now all of the remote pull requests are represented locally with refs that act much like tracking
branches; they&rsquo;re read-only, and they update when you do a fetch. This makes it super easy to try
the code from a pull request locally:
<p>$ git checkout pr/2
Checking out files: 100% (3769/3769), done.
Branch pr/2 set up to track remote branch pr/2 from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'pr/2'
<p>The eagle-eyed among you would note the head on the end of the remote portion of the refspec.
There&rsquo;s also a refs/pull/#/merge ref on the GitHub side, which represents the commit that would
result if you push the &ldquo;merge&rdquo; button on the site. This can allow you to test the merge before even
hitting the button.
<p>Pull Requests on Pull Requests
<p>Not only can you open Pull Requests that target the main or master branch, you can actually open a
Pull Request targeting any branch in the network. In fact, you can even target another Pull Request.
<p>If you see a Pull Request that is moving in the right direction and you have an idea for a change that
depends on it or you&rsquo;re not sure is a good idea, or you just don&rsquo;t have push access to the target
branch, you can open a Pull Request directly to it.
<p>When you go to open a Pull Request, there is a box at the top of the page that specifies which
branch you&rsquo;re requesting to pull to and which you&rsquo;re requesting to pull from. If you hit the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo;
button at the right of that box you can change not only the branches but also which fork.
<p>198</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 118. Manually change the Pull Request target fork and branch.
<p>Here you can fairly easily specify to merge your new branch into another Pull Request or another
fork of the project.
<p>Mentions and Notifications
<p>GitHub also has a pretty nice notifications system built in that can come in handy when you have
questions or need feedback from specific individuals or teams.
<p>In any comment you can start typing a @ character and it will begin to autocomplete with the names
and usernames of people who are collaborators or contributors in the project.
<p>Figure 119. Start typing @ to mention someone.
<p>You can also mention a user who is not in that dropdown, but often the autocompleter can make it
faster.
<p>Once you post a comment with a user mention, that user will be notified. This means that this can
be a really effective way of pulling people into conversations rather than making them poll. Very
often in Pull Requests on GitHub people will pull in other people on their teams or in their company
to review an Issue or Pull Request.
<p>199</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>If someone gets mentioned on a Pull Request or Issue, they will be &ldquo;subscribed&rdquo; to it and will
continue getting notifications any time some activity occurs on it. You will also be subscribed to
something if you opened it, if you&rsquo;re watching the repository or if you comment on something. If
you no longer wish to receive notifications, there is an &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; button on the page you can
click to stop receiving updates on it.
<p>Figure 120. Unsubscribe from an Issue or Pull Request.
<p>The Notifications Page
<p>When we mention &ldquo;notifications&rdquo; here with respect to GitHub, we mean a specific way that GitHub
tries to get in touch with you when events happen and there are a few different ways you can
configure them. If you go to the &ldquo;Notification center&rdquo; tab from the settings page, you can see some
of the options you have.
<p>200</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 121. Notification center options.
<p>The two choices are to get notifications over &ldquo;Email&rdquo; and over &ldquo;Web&rdquo; and you can choose either,
neither or both for when you actively participate in things and for activity on repositories you are
watching.
<p>Web Notifications
<p>Web notifications only exist on GitHub and you can only check them on GitHub. If you have this
option selected in your preferences and a notification is triggered for you, you will see a small blue
dot over your notifications icon at the top of your screen as seen in Notification center..
<p>Figure 122. Notification center.
<p>If you click on that, you will see a list of all the items you have been notified about, grouped by
project. You can filter to the notifications of a specific project by clicking on its name in the left
hand sidebar. You can also acknowledge the notification by clicking the checkmark icon next to any
<p>201</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>notification, or acknowledge all of the notifications in a project by clicking the checkmark at the top
of the group. There is also a mute button next to each checkmark that you can click to not receive
any further notifications on that item.
<p>All of these tools are very useful for handling large numbers of notifications. Many GitHub power
users will simply turn off email notifications entirely and manage all of their notifications through
this screen.
<p>Email Notifications
<p>Email notifications are the other way you can handle notifications through GitHub. If you have this
turned on you will get emails for each notification. We saw examples of this in Comments sent as
email notifications and Email notification of a new Pull Request.. The emails will also be threaded
properly, which is nice if you&rsquo;re using a threading email client.
<p>There is also a fair amount of metadata embedded in the headers of the emails that GitHub sends
you, which can be really helpful for setting up custom filters and rules.
<p>For instance, if we look at the actual email headers sent to Tony in the email shown in Email
notification of a new Pull Request., we will see the following among the information sent:
<p>To: tonychacon/fade &lt;fade@noreply.github.com&gt;
Message-ID: &lt;tonychacon/fade/pull/1@github.com&gt;
Subject: [fade] Wait longer to see the dimming effect better (#1)
X-GitHub-Recipient: tonychacon
List-ID: tonychacon/fade &lt;fade.tonychacon.github.com&gt;
List-Archive: https://github.com/tonychacon/fade
List-Post: &lt;mailto:reply+i-4XXX@reply.github.com&gt;
List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:unsub+i-XXX@reply.github.com&gt;,...
X-GitHub-Recipient-Address: tchacon@example.com
<p>There are a couple of interesting things here. If you want to highlight or re-route emails to this
particular project or even Pull Request, the information in Message-ID gives you all the data in
&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;id&gt; format. If this were an issue, for example, the &lt;type&gt; field would have
been &ldquo;issues&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;pull&rdquo;.
<p>The List-Post and List-Unsubscribe fields mean that if you have a mail client that understands
those, you can easily post to the list or &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; from the thread. That would be essentially the
same as clicking the &ldquo;mute&rdquo; button on the web version of the notification or &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; on the
Issue or Pull Request page itself.
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that if you have both email and web notifications enabled and you read the
email version of the notification, the web version will be marked as read as well if you have images
allowed in your mail client.
<p>Special Files
<p>There are a couple of special files that GitHub will notice if they are present in your repository.
<p>202</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>README
<p>The first is the README file, which can be of nearly any format that GitHub recognizes as prose. For
example, it could be README, README.md, README.asciidoc, etc. If GitHub sees a README file in your
source, it will render it on the landing page of the project.
<p>Many teams use this file to hold all the relevant project information for someone who might be new
to the repository or project. This generally includes things like:
<p>&bull; What the project is for
<p>&bull; How to configure and install it
<p>&bull; An example of how to use it or get it running
<p>&bull; The license that the project is offered under
<p>&bull; How to contribute to it
<p>Since GitHub will render this file, you can embed images or links in it for added ease of
understanding.
<p>CONTRIBUTING
<p>The other special file that GitHub recognizes is the CONTRIBUTING file. If you have a file named
CONTRIBUTING with any file extension, GitHub will show Opening a Pull Request when a
CONTRIBUTING file exists. when anyone starts opening a Pull Request.
<p>Figure 123. Opening a Pull Request when a CONTRIBUTING file exists.
<p>The idea here is that you can specify specific things you want or don&rsquo;t want in a Pull Request sent to
your project. This way people may actually read the guidelines before opening the Pull Request.
<p>Project Administration
<p>Generally there are not a lot of administrative things you can do with a single project, but there are
a couple of items that might be of interest.
<p>203</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Changing the Default Branch
<p>If you are using a branch other than &ldquo;master&rdquo; as your default branch that you want people to open
Pull Requests on or see by default, you can change that in your repository&rsquo;s settings page under the
&ldquo;Options&rdquo; tab.
<p>Figure 124. Change the default branch for a project.
<p>Simply change the default branch in the dropdown and that will be the default for all major
operations from then on, including which branch is checked out by default when someone clones
the repository.
<p>Transferring a Project
<p>If you would like to transfer a project to another user or an organization in GitHub, there is a
&ldquo;Transfer ownership&rdquo; option at the bottom of the same &ldquo;Options&rdquo; tab of your repository settings
page that allows you to do this.
<p>Figure 125. Transfer a project to another GitHub user or Organization.
<p>This is helpful if you are abandoning a project and someone wants to take it over, or if your project
is getting bigger and want to move it into an organization.
<p>Not only does this move the repository along with all its watchers and stars to another place, it also
sets up a redirect from your URL to the new place. It will also redirect clones and fetches from Git,
not just web requests.
<p>204</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing an organization
In addition to single-user accounts, GitHub has what are called Organizations. Like personal
accounts, Organizational accounts have a namespace where all their projects exist, but many other
things are different. These accounts represent a group of people with shared ownership of projects,
and there are many tools to manage subgroups of those people. Normally these accounts are used
for Open Source groups (such as &ldquo;perl&rdquo; or &ldquo;rails&rdquo;) or companies (such as &ldquo;google&rdquo; or &ldquo;twitter&rdquo;).
<p>Organization Basics
<p>An organization is pretty easy to create; just click on the &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon at the top-right of any GitHub
page, and select &ldquo;New organization&rdquo; from the menu.
<p>Figure 126. The &ldquo;New organization&rdquo; menu item.
<p>First you&rsquo;ll need to name your organization and provide an email address for a main point of
contact for the group. Then you can invite other users to be co-owners of the account if you want to.
<p>Follow these steps and you&rsquo;ll soon be the owner of a brand-new organization. Like personal
accounts, organizations are free if everything you plan to store there will be open source.
<p>As an owner in an organization, when you fork a repository, you&rsquo;ll have the choice of forking it to
your organization&rsquo;s namespace. When you create new repositories you can create them either
under your personal account or under any of the organizations that you are an owner in. You also
automatically &ldquo;watch&rdquo; any new repository created under these organizations.
<p>Just like in Your Avatar, you can upload an avatar for your organization to personalize it a bit. Also
just like personal accounts, you have a landing page for the organization that lists all of your
repositories and can be viewed by other people.
<p>Now let&rsquo;s cover some of the things that are a bit different with an organizational account.
<p>Teams
<p>Organizations are associated with individual people by way of teams, which are simply a grouping
of individual user accounts and repositories within the organization and what kind of access those
people have in those repositories.
<p>205</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>For example, say your company has three repositories: frontend, backend, and deployscripts. You&rsquo;d
want your HTML/CSS/JavaScript developers to have access to frontend and maybe backend, and your
Operations people to have access to backend and deployscripts. Teams make this easy, without
having to manage the collaborators for every individual repository.
<p>The Organization page shows you a simple dashboard of all the repositories, users and teams that
are under this organization.
<p>Figure 127. The Organization page.
<p>To manage your Teams, you can click on the Teams sidebar on the right hand side of the page in
The Organization page.. This will bring you to a page you can use to add members to the team, add
repositories to the team or manage the settings and access control levels for the team. Each team
can have read only, read/write or administrative access to the repositories. You can change that
level by clicking the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; button in The Team page..
<p>206</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 128. The Team page.
<p>When you invite someone to a team, they will get an email letting them know they&rsquo;ve been invited.
<p>Additionally, team @mentions (such as @acmecorp/frontend) work much the same as they do with
individual users, except that all members of the team are then subscribed to the thread. This is
useful if you want the attention from someone on a team, but you don&rsquo;t know exactly who to ask.
<p>A user can belong to any number of teams, so don&rsquo;t limit yourself to only access-control teams.
Special-interest teams like ux, css, or refactoring are useful for certain kinds of questions, and
others like legal and colorblind for an entirely different kind.
<p>Audit Log
<p>Organizations also give owners access to all the information about what went on under the
organization. You can go to the Audit Log tab and see what events have happened at an
organization level, who did them and where in the world they were done.
<p>207</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 129. The Audit log.
<p>You can also filter down to specific types of events, specific places or specific people.
<p>Scripting GitHub
So now we&rsquo;ve covered all of the major features and workflows of GitHub, but any large group or
project will have customizations they may want to make or external services they may want to
integrate.
<p>Luckily for us, GitHub is really quite hackable in many ways. In this section we&rsquo;ll cover how to use
the GitHub hooks system and its API to make GitHub work how we want it to.
<p>Services and Hooks
<p>The Hooks and Services section of GitHub repository administration is the easiest way to have
<p>208</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>GitHub interact with external systems.
<p>Services
<p>First we&rsquo;ll take a look at Services. Both the Hooks and Services integrations can be found in the
Settings section of your repository, where we previously looked at adding Collaborators and
changing the default branch of your project. Under the &ldquo;Webhooks and Services&rdquo; tab you will see
something like Services and Hooks configuration section..
<p>Figure 130. Services and Hooks configuration section.
<p>There are dozens of services you can choose from, most of them integrations into other commercial
and open source systems. Most of them are for Continuous Integration services, bug and issue
trackers, chat room systems and documentation systems. We&rsquo;ll walk through setting up a very
simple one, the Email hook. If you choose &ldquo;email&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Add Service&rdquo; dropdown, you&rsquo;ll get a
configuration screen like Email service configuration..
<p>Figure 131. Email service configuration.
<p>209</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>In this case, if we hit the &ldquo;Add service&rdquo; button, the email address we specified will get an email
every time someone pushes to the repository. Services can listen for lots of different types of events,
but most only listen for push events and then do something with that data.
<p>If there is a system you are using that you would like to integrate with GitHub, you should check
here to see if there is an existing service integration available. For example, if you&rsquo;re using Jenkins
to run tests on your codebase, you can enable the Jenkins builtin service integration to kick off a
test run every time someone pushes to your repository.
<p>Hooks
<p>If you need something more specific or you want to integrate with a service or site that is not
included in this list, you can instead use the more generic hooks system. GitHub repository hooks
are pretty simple. You specify a URL and GitHub will post an HTTP payload to that URL on any
event you want.
<p>Generally the way this works is you can setup a small web service to listen for a GitHub hook
payload and then do something with the data when it is received.
<p>To enable a hook, you click the &ldquo;Add webhook&rdquo; button in Services and Hooks configuration section..
This will bring you to a page that looks like Web hook configuration..
<p>Figure 132. Web hook configuration.
<p>The configuration for a web hook is pretty simple. In most cases you simply enter a URL and a
secret key and hit &ldquo;Add webhook&rdquo;. There are a few options for which events you want GitHub to
send you a payload for&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the default is to only get a payload for the push event, when someone
pushes new code to any branch of your repository.
<p>210</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see a small example of a web service you may set up to handle a web hook. We&rsquo;ll use the Ruby
web framework Sinatra since it&rsquo;s fairly concise and you should be able to easily see what we&rsquo;re
doing.
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we want to get an email if a specific person pushes to a specific branch of our project
modifying a specific file. We could fairly easily do that with code like this:
<p>require 'sinatra'
require 'json'
require 'mail'
<p>post '/payload' do
&nbsp; push = JSON.parse(request.body.read) # parse the JSON
<p>&nbsp; # gather the data we're looking for
&nbsp; pusher = push["pusher"]["name"]
&nbsp; branch = push["ref"]
<p>&nbsp; # get a list of all the files touched
&nbsp; files = push["commits"].map do |commit|
&nbsp; commit['added'] + commit['modified'] + commit['removed']
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; files = files.flatten.uniq
<p>&nbsp; # check for our criteria
&nbsp; if pusher == 'schacon' &amp;&amp;
&nbsp; branch == 'ref/heads/special-branch' &amp;&amp;
&nbsp; files.include?('special-file.txt')
<p>&nbsp; Mail.deliver do
&nbsp; from 'tchacon@example.com'
&nbsp; to 'tchacon@example.com'
&nbsp; subject 'Scott Changed the File'
&nbsp; body "ALARM"
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; end
end
<p>Here we&rsquo;re taking the JSON payload that GitHub delivers us and looking up who pushed it, what
branch they pushed to and what files were touched in all the commits that were pushed. Then we
check that against our criteria and send an email if it matches.
<p>In order to develop and test something like this, you have a nice developer console in the same
screen where you set the hook up. You can see the last few deliveries that GitHub has tried to make
for that webhook. For each hook you can dig down into when it was delivered, if it was successful
and the body and headers for both the request and the response. This makes it incredibly easy to
test and debug your hooks.
<p>211</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 133. Web hook debugging information.
<p>The other great feature of this is that you can redeliver any of the payloads to test your service
easily.
<p>For more information on how to write webhooks and all the different event types you can listen
for, go to the GitHub Developer documentation at https://developer.github.com/webhooks/
<p>The GitHub API
<p>Services and hooks give you a way to receive push notifications about events that happen on your
repositories, but what if you need more information about these events? What if you need to
automate something like adding collaborators or labeling issues?
<p>This is where the GitHub API comes in handy. GitHub has tons of API endpoints for doing nearly
<p>212</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">https://developer.github.com/webhooks/</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>anything you can do on the website in an automated fashion. In this section we&rsquo;ll learn how to
authenticate and connect to the API, how to comment on an issue and how to change the status of a
Pull Request through the API.
<p>Basic Usage
<p>The most basic thing you can do is a simple GET request on an endpoint that doesn&rsquo;t require
authentication. This could be a user or read-only information on an open source project. For
example, if we want to know more about a user named &ldquo;schacon&rdquo;, we can run something like this:
<p>$ curl https://api.github.com/users/schacon
{
&nbsp; "login": "schacon",
&nbsp; "id": 70,
&nbsp; "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70",
# &hellip;
&nbsp; "name": "Scott Chacon",
&nbsp; "company": "GitHub",
&nbsp; "following": 19,
&nbsp; "created_at": "2008-01-27T17:19:28Z",
&nbsp; "updated_at": "2014-06-10T02:37:23Z"
}
<p>There are tons of endpoints like this to get information about organizations, projects, issues,
commits&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;just about anything you can publicly see on GitHub. You can even use the API to render
arbitrary Markdown or find a .gitignore template.
<p>$ curl https://api.github.com/gitignore/templates/Java
{
&nbsp; "name": "Java",
&nbsp; "source": "*.class
<p># Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/
<p># Package Files #

hs_err_pid*
"
}
<p>213</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Commenting on an Issue
<p>However, if you want to do an action on the website such as comment on an Issue or Pull Request
or if you want to view or interact with private content, you&rsquo;ll need to authenticate.
<p>There are several ways to authenticate. You can use basic authentication with just your username
and password, but generally it&rsquo;s a better idea to use a personal access token. You can generate this
from the &ldquo;Applications&rdquo; tab of your settings page.
<p>Figure 134. Generate your access token from the &ldquo;Applications&rdquo; tab of your settings page.
<p>It will ask you which scopes you want for this token and a description. Make sure to use a good
description so you feel comfortable removing the token when your script or application is no
longer used.
<p>GitHub will only show you the token once, so be sure to copy it. You can now use this to
authenticate in your script instead of using a username and password. This is nice because you can
limit the scope of what you want to do and the token is revocable.
<p>This also has the added advantage of increasing your rate limit. Without authenticating, you will be
limited to 60 requests per hour. If you authenticate you can make up to 5,000 requests per hour.
<p>So let&rsquo;s use it to make a comment on one of our issues. Let&rsquo;s say we want to leave a comment on a
specific issue, Issue #6. To do so we have to do an HTTP POST request to
repos/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/issues/&lt;num&gt;/comments with the token we just generated as an Authorization
header.
<p>214</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
&nbsp; -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" \
&nbsp; --data '{"body":"A new comment, :+1:"}' \
&nbsp; https://api.github.com/repos/schacon/blink/issues/6/comments
{
&nbsp; "id": 58322100,
&nbsp; "html_url": "https://github.com/schacon/blink/issues/6#issuecomment-58322100",
&nbsp; ...
&nbsp; "user": {
&nbsp; "login": "tonychacon",
&nbsp; "id": 7874698,
&nbsp; "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7874698?v=2",
&nbsp; "type": "User",
&nbsp; },
&nbsp; "created_at": "2014-10-08T07:48:19Z",
&nbsp; "updated_at": "2014-10-08T07:48:19Z",
&nbsp; "body": "A new comment, :+1:"
}
<p>Now if you go to that issue, you can see the comment that we just successfully posted as in A
comment posted from the GitHub API..
<p>Figure 135. A comment posted from the GitHub API.
<p>You can use the API to do just about anything you can do on the website&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;creating and setting
milestones, assigning people to Issues and Pull Requests, creating and changing labels, accessing
commit data, creating new commits and branches, opening, closing or merging Pull Requests,
creating and editing teams, commenting on lines of code in a Pull Request, searching the site and on
and on.
<p>Changing the Status of a Pull Request
<p>There is one final example we&rsquo;ll look at since it&rsquo;s really useful if you&rsquo;re working with Pull Requests.
Each commit can have one or more statuses associated with it and there is an API to add and query
that status.
<p>Most of the Continuous Integration and testing services make use of this API to react to pushes by
testing the code that was pushed, and then report back if that commit has passed all the tests. You
could also use this to check if the commit message is properly formatted, if the submitter followed
all your contribution guidelines, if the commit was validly signed&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;any number of things.
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you set up a webhook on your repository that hits a small web service that checks for a
Signed-off-by string in the commit message.
<p>215</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>require 'httparty'
require 'sinatra'
require 'json'
<p>post '/payload' do
&nbsp; push = JSON.parse(request.body.read) # parse the JSON
&nbsp; repo_name = push['repository']['full_name']
<p>&nbsp; # look through each commit message
&nbsp; push["commits"].each do |commit|
<p>&nbsp; # look for a Signed-off-by string
&nbsp; if /Signed-off-by/.match commit['message']
&nbsp; state = 'success'
&nbsp; description = 'Successfully signed off!'
&nbsp; else
&nbsp; state = 'failure'
&nbsp; description = 'No signoff found.'
&nbsp; end
<p>&nbsp; # post status to GitHub
&nbsp; sha = commit["id"]
&nbsp; status_url = "https://api.github.com/repos/#{repo_name}/statuses/#{sha}"
<p>&nbsp; status = {
&nbsp; "state" =&gt; state,
&nbsp; "description" =&gt; description,
&nbsp; "target_url" =&gt; "http://example.com/how-to-signoff",
&nbsp; "context" =&gt; "validate/signoff"
&nbsp; }
&nbsp; HTTParty.post(status_url,
&nbsp; :body =&gt; status.to_json,
&nbsp; :headers =&gt; {
&nbsp; 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'application/json',
&nbsp; 'User-Agent' =&gt; 'tonychacon/signoff',
&nbsp; 'Authorization' =&gt; "token #{ENV['TOKEN']}" }
&nbsp; )
&nbsp; end
end
<p>Hopefully this is fairly simple to follow. In this web hook handler we look through each commit that
was just pushed, we look for the string Signed-off-by in the commit message and finally we POST via
HTTP to the /repos/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/statuses/&lt;commit_sha&gt; API endpoint with the status.
<p>In this case you can send a state (success, failure, error), a description of what happened, a target
URL the user can go to for more information and a &ldquo;context&rdquo; in case there are multiple statuses for
a single commit. For example, a testing service may provide a status and a validation service like
this may also provide a status&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the &ldquo;context&rdquo; field is how they&rsquo;re differentiated.
<p>216</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>If someone opens a new Pull Request on GitHub and this hook is set up, you may see something like
Commit status via the API..
<p>Figure 136. Commit status via the API.
<p>You can now see a little green check mark next to the commit that has a &ldquo;Signed-off-by&rdquo; string in the
message and a red cross through the one where the author forgot to sign off. You can also see that
the Pull Request takes the status of the last commit on the branch and warns you if it is a failure.
This is really useful if you&rsquo;re using this API for test results so you don&rsquo;t accidentally merge
something where the last commit is failing tests.
<p>Octokit
<p>Though we&rsquo;ve been doing nearly everything through curl and simple HTTP requests in these
examples, several open-source libraries exist that make this API available in a more idiomatic way.
At the time of this writing, the supported languages include Go, Objective-C, Ruby, and .NET. Check
out https://github.com/octokit for more information on these, as they handle much of the HTTP for
you.
<p>Hopefully these tools can help you customize and modify GitHub to work better for your specific
workflows. For complete documentation on the entire API as well as guides for common tasks,
check out https://developer.github.com.
<p>Summary
Now you&rsquo;re a GitHub user. You know how to create an account, manage an organization, create and
push to repositories, contribute to other people&rsquo;s projects and accept contributions from others. In
the next chapter, you&rsquo;ll learn more powerful tools and tips for dealing with complex situations,
which will truly make you a Git master.

<p>Git Tools
By now, you&rsquo;ve learned most of the day-to-day commands and workflows that you need to manage
or maintain a Git repository for your source code control. You&rsquo;ve accomplished the basic tasks of
tracking and committing files, and you&rsquo;ve harnessed the power of the staging area and lightweight
topic branching and merging.
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll explore a number of very powerful things that Git can do that you may not necessarily
use on a day-to-day basis but that you may need at some point.
<p>Revision Selection
Git allows you to refer to a single commit, set of commits, or range of commits in a number of ways.
They aren&rsquo;t necessarily obvious but are helpful to know.
<p>Single Revisions
<p>You can obviously refer to any single commit by its full, 40-character SHA-1 hash, but there are
more human-friendly ways to refer to commits as well. This section outlines the various ways you
can refer to any commit.
<p>Short SHA-1
<p>Git is smart enough to figure out what commit you&rsquo;re referring to if you provide the first few
characters of the SHA-1 hash, as long as that partial hash is at least four characters long and
unambiguous; that is, no other object in the object database can have a hash that begins with the
same prefix.
<p>For example, to examine a specific commit where you know you added certain functionality, you
might first run the git log command to locate the commit:

Date: Thu Dec 11 14:58:32 2008 -0800
<p>&nbsp; Add some blame and merge stuff
<p>In this case, say you&rsquo;re interested in the commit whose hash begins with 1c002dd.... You can inspect
that commit with any of the following variations of git show (assuming the shorter versions are
unambiguous):
<p>$ git show 1c002dd4b536e7479fe34593e72e6c6c1819e53b
$ git show 1c002dd4b536e7479f
$ git show 1c002d
<p>Git can figure out a short, unique abbreviation for your SHA-1 values. If you pass --abbrev-commit to
the git log command, the output will use shorter values but keep them unique; it defaults to using
seven characters but makes them longer if necessary to keep the SHA-1 unambiguous:
<p>$ git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline
ca82a6d Change the version number
085bb3b Remove unnecessary test code
a11bef0 Initial commit
<p>Generally, eight to ten characters are more than enough to be unique within a project. For example,
as of February 2019, the Linux kernel (which is a fairly sizable project) has over 875,000 commits
and almost seven million objects in its object database, with no two objects whose SHA-1s are
identical in the first 12 characters.
<p>219</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>
<p>A SHORT NOTE ABOUT SHA-1
<p>A lot of people become concerned at some point that they will, by random
happenstance, have two distinct objects in their repository that hash to the same
SHA-1 value. What then?
<p>If you do happen to commit an object that hashes to the same SHA-1 value as a
previous different object in your repository, Git will see the previous object already
in your Git database, assume it was already written and simply reuse it. If you try
to check out that object again at some point, you&rsquo;ll always get the data of the first
object.
<p>However, you should be aware of how ridiculously unlikely this scenario is. The
SHA-1 digest is 20 bytes or 160 bits. The number of randomly hashed objects
needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single collision is about 280 (the formula
for determining collision probability is p = (n(n-1)/2) * (1/2^160)). 280 is 1.2 x 1024
<p>or 1 million billion billion. That&rsquo;s 1,200 times the number of grains of sand on the
earth.
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example to give you an idea of what it would take to get a SHA-1
collision. If all 6.5 billion humans on Earth were programming, and every second,
each one was producing code that was the equivalent of the entire Linux kernel
history (6.5 million Git objects) and pushing it into one enormous Git repository, it
would take roughly 2 years until that repository contained enough objects to have
a 50% probability of a single SHA-1 object collision. Thus, a SHA-1 collision is less
likely than every member of your programming team being attacked and killed by
wolves in unrelated incidents on the same night.
<p>Branch References
<p>One straightforward way to refer to a particular commit is if it&rsquo;s the commit at the tip of a branch;
in that case, you can simply use the branch name in any Git command that expects a reference to a
commit. For instance, if you want to examine the last commit object on a branch, the following
commands are equivalent, assuming that the topic1 branch points to commit ca82a6d...:
<p>$ git show ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949
$ git show topic1
<p>If you want to see which specific SHA-1 a branch points to, or if you want to see what any of these
examples boils down to in terms of SHA-1s, you can use a Git plumbing tool called rev-parse. You
can see Git Internals for more information about plumbing tools; basically, rev-parse exists for
lower-level operations and isn&rsquo;t designed to be used in day-to-day operations. However, it can be
helpful sometimes when you need to see what&rsquo;s really going on. Here you can run rev-parse on
your branch.
<p>$ git rev-parse topic1
ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949
<p>220</p>

<br>
<p>RefLog Shortnames
<p>One of the things Git does in the background while you&rsquo;re working away is keep a &ldquo;reflog&rdquo;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a log
of where your HEAD and branch references have been for the last few months.
<p>You can see your reflog by using git reflog:
<p>$ git reflog
734713b HEAD@{0}: commit: Fix refs handling, add gc auto, update tests
d921970 HEAD@{1}: merge phedders/rdocs: Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
1c002dd HEAD@{2}: commit: Add some blame and merge stuff
1c36188 HEAD@{3}: rebase -i (squash): updating HEAD
95df984 HEAD@{4}: commit: # This is a combination of two commits.
1c36188 HEAD@{5}: rebase -i (squash): updating HEAD
7e05da5 HEAD@{6}: rebase -i (pick): updating HEAD
<p>Every time your branch tip is updated for any reason, Git stores that information for you in this
temporary history. You can use your reflog data to refer to older commits as well. For example, if
you want to see the fifth prior value of the HEAD of your repository, you can use the @{5} reference
that you see in the reflog output:
<p>$ git show HEAD@{5}
<p>You can also use this syntax to see where a branch was some specific amount of time ago. For
instance, to see where your master branch was yesterday, you can type
<p>$ git show master@{yesterday}
<p>That would show you where tip of your master branch was yesterday. This technique only works for
data that&rsquo;s still in your reflog, so you can&rsquo;t use it to look for commits older than a few months.
<p>To see reflog information formatted like the git log output, you can run git log -g:
<p>221</p>

<p>&nbsp; Merge commit 'phedders/rdocs'
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that reflog information is strictly local&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s a log only of what you&rsquo;ve done in
your repository. The references won&rsquo;t be the same on someone else&rsquo;s copy of the repository; also,
right after you initially clone a repository, you&rsquo;ll have an empty reflog, as no activity has occurred
yet in your repository. Running git show HEAD@{2.months.ago} will show you the matching commit
only if you cloned the project at least two months ago&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if you cloned it any more recently than
that, you&rsquo;ll see only your first local commit.
<p>
<p>Think of the reflog as Git&rsquo;s version of shell history
<p>If you have a UNIX or Linux background, you can think of the reflog as Git&rsquo;s
version of shell history, which emphasizes that what&rsquo;s there is clearly relevant
only for you and your &ldquo;session&rdquo;, and has nothing to do with anyone else who might
be working on the same machine.
<p>Ancestry References
<p>The other main way to specify a commit is via its ancestry. If you place a ^ (caret) at the end of a
reference, Git resolves it to mean the parent of that commit. Suppose you look at the history of your
project:
<p>$ git log --pretty=format:'%h %s' --graph
* 734713b Fix refs handling, add gc auto, update tests
* d921970 Merge commit 'phedders/rdocs'
|\
| * 35cfb2b Some rdoc changes
* | 1c002dd Add some blame and merge stuff
|/
* 1c36188 Ignore *.gem
* 9b29157 Add open3_detach to gemspec file list
<p>Then, you can see the previous commit by specifying HEAD^, which means &ldquo;the parent of HEAD&rdquo;:
<p>222</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git show HEAD^
commit d921970aadf03b3cf0e71becdaab3147ba71cdef

<p>&nbsp; Merge commit 'phedders/rdocs'
<p>
<p>Escaping the caret on Windows
<p>On Windows in cmd.exe, ^ is a special character and needs to be treated differently.
You can either double it or put the commit reference in quotes:
<p>$ git show HEAD^ # will NOT work on Windows
$ git show HEAD^^ # OK
$ git show "HEAD^" # OK
<p>You can also specify a number after the ^ to identify which parent you want; for example, d921970^2
means &ldquo;the second parent of d921970.&rdquo; This syntax is useful only for merge commits, which have
more than one parent&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the first parent of a merge commit is from the branch you were on when
you merged (frequently master), while the second parent of a merge commit is from the branch that
was merged (say, topic):
<p>$ git show d921970^

<p>&nbsp; Some rdoc changes
<p>The other main ancestry specification is the ~ (tilde). This also refers to the first parent, so HEAD~ and
HEAD^ are equivalent. The difference becomes apparent when you specify a number. HEAD~2 means
&ldquo;the first parent of the first parent,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the grandparent&rdquo;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it traverses the first parents the
number of times you specify. For example, in the history listed earlier, HEAD~3 would be
<p>223</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git show HEAD~3

Author: Tom Preston-Werner &lt;tom@mojombo.com&gt;
Date: Fri Nov 7 13:47:59 2008 -0500
<p>&nbsp; Ignore *.gem
<p>You can also combine these syntaxes&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can get the second parent of the previous reference
(assuming it was a merge commit) by using HEAD~3^2, and so on.
<p>Commit Ranges
<p>Now that you can specify individual commits, let&rsquo;s see how to specify ranges of commits. This is
particularly useful for managing your branches&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if you have a lot of branches, you can use range
specifications to answer questions such as, &ldquo;What work is on this branch that I haven&rsquo;t yet merged
into my main branch?&rdquo;
<p>Double Dot
<p>The most common range specification is the double-dot syntax. This basically asks Git to resolve a
range of commits that are reachable from one commit but aren&rsquo;t reachable from another. For
example, say you have a commit history that looks like Example history for range selection..
<p>Figure 137. Example history for range selection.
<p>Say you want to see what is in your experiment branch that hasn&rsquo;t yet been merged into your master
branch. You can ask Git to show you a log of just those commits with master..experiment&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that
means &ldquo;all commits reachable from experiment that aren&rsquo;t reachable from master.&rdquo; For the sake of
brevity and clarity in these examples, the letters of the commit objects from the diagram are used
in place of the actual log output in the order that they would display:
<p>224</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git log master..experiment
D
C
<p>If, on the other hand, you want to see the opposite&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;all commits in master that aren&rsquo;t in
experiment&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can reverse the branch names. experiment..master shows you everything in master
not reachable from experiment:
<p>$ git log experiment..master
F
E
<p>This is useful if you want to keep the experiment branch up to date and preview what you&rsquo;re about
to merge. Another frequent use of this syntax is to see what you&rsquo;re about to push to a remote:
<p>$ git log origin/master..HEAD
<p>This command shows you any commits in your current branch that aren&rsquo;t in the master branch on
your origin remote. If you run a git push and your current branch is tracking origin/master, the
commits listed by git log origin/master..HEAD are the commits that will be transferred to the
server. You can also leave off one side of the syntax to have Git assume HEAD. For example, you can
get the same results as in the previous example by typing git log origin/master..&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Git substitutes
HEAD if one side is missing.
<p>Multiple Points
<p>The double-dot syntax is useful as a shorthand, but perhaps you want to specify more than two
branches to indicate your revision, such as seeing what commits are in any of several branches that
aren&rsquo;t in the branch you&rsquo;re currently on. Git allows you to do this by using either the ^ character or
--not before any reference from which you don&rsquo;t want to see reachable commits. Thus, the
following three commands are equivalent:
<p>$ git log refA..refB
$ git log ^refA refB
$ git log refB --not refA
<p>This is nice because with this syntax you can specify more than two references in your query,
which you cannot do with the double-dot syntax. For instance, if you want to see all commits that
are reachable from refA or refB but not from refC, you can use either of:
<p>$ git log refA refB ^refC
$ git log refA refB --not refC
<p>This makes for a very powerful revision query system that should help you figure out what is in
<p>225</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>your branches.
<p>Triple Dot
<p>The last major range-selection syntax is the triple-dot syntax, which specifies all the commits that
are reachable by either of two references but not by both of them. Look back at the example
commit history in Example history for range selection.. If you want to see what is in master or
experiment but not any common references, you can run:
<p>$ git log master...experiment
F
E
D
C
<p>Again, this gives you normal log output but shows you only the commit information for those four
commits, appearing in the traditional commit date ordering.
<p>A common switch to use with the log command in this case is --left-right, which shows you which
side of the range each commit is in. This helps make the output more useful:
<p>$ git log --left-right master...experiment
&lt; F
&lt; E
&gt; D
&gt; C
<p>With these tools, you can much more easily let Git know what commit or commits you want to
inspect.
<p>Interactive Staging
In this section, you&rsquo;ll look at a few interactive Git commands that can help you craft your commits
to include only certain combinations and parts of files. These tools are helpful if you modify a
number of files extensively, then decide that you want those changes to be partitioned into several
focused commits rather than one big messy commit. This way, you can make sure your commits are
logically separate changesets and can be reviewed easily by the developers working with you.
<p>If you run git add with the -i or --interactive option, Git enters an interactive shell mode,
displaying something like this:
<p>226</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git add -i

&nbsp; 5: [p]atch 6: [d]iff 7: [q]uit 8: [h]elp
What now&gt;
<p>You can see that this command shows you a much different view of your staging area than you&rsquo;re
probably used to&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;basically, the same information you get with git status but a bit more succinct
and informative. It lists the changes you&rsquo;ve staged on the left and unstaged changes on the right.
<p>After this comes a &ldquo;Commands&rdquo; section, which allows you to do a number of things like staging and
unstaging files, staging parts of files, adding untracked files, and displaying diffs of what has been
staged.
<p>Staging and Unstaging Files
<p>If you type u or 2 (for update) at the What now&gt; prompt, you&rsquo;re prompted for which files you want to
stage:
<p>What now&gt; u
&nbsp; staged unstaged path
&nbsp; 1: unchanged +0/-1 TODO
&nbsp; 2: unchanged +1/-1 index.html
&nbsp; 3: unchanged +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb
Update&gt;&gt;
<p>To stage the TODO and index.html files, you can type the numbers:
<p>Update&gt;&gt; 1,2
&nbsp; staged unstaged path
* 1: unchanged +0/-1 TODO
* 2: unchanged +1/-1 index.html
&nbsp; 3: unchanged +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb
Update&gt;&gt;
<p>The * next to each file means the file is selected to be staged. If you press Enter after typing nothing
at the Update&gt;&gt; prompt, Git takes anything selected and stages it for you:
<p>227</p>
<br>

&nbsp; 1: +0/-1 nothing TODO
&nbsp; 2: +1/-1 nothing index.html
&nbsp; 3: unchanged +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb
<p>Now you can see that the TODO and index.html files are staged and the simplegit.rb file is still
unstaged. If you want to unstage the TODO file at this point, you use the r or 3 (for revert) option:
<p>*** Commands ***
&nbsp; 1: [s]tatus 2: [u]pdate 3: [r]evert 4: [a]dd untracked
&nbsp; 5: [p]atch 6: [d]iff 7: [q]uit 8: [h]elp

&nbsp; 2: +1/-1 nothing index.html
&nbsp; 3: unchanged +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb
Revert&gt;&gt; [enter]
reverted one path
<p>Looking at your Git status again, you can see that you&rsquo;ve unstaged the TODO file:
<p>*** Commands ***
&nbsp; 1: [s]tatus 2: [u]pdate 3: [r]evert 4: [a]dd untracked
&nbsp; 5: [p]atch 6: [d]iff 7: [q]uit 8: [h]elp

&nbsp; staged unstaged path
&nbsp; 1: unchanged +0/-1 TODO
&nbsp; 2: +1/-1 nothing index.html
&nbsp; 3: unchanged +5/-1 lib/simplegit.rb
<p>To see the diff of what you&rsquo;ve staged, you can use the d or 6 (for diff) command. It shows you a list
of your staged files, and you can select the ones for which you would like to see the staged diff. This
is much like specifying git diff --cached on the command line:

<p>With these basic commands, you can use the interactive add mode to deal with your staging area a
little more easily.
<p>Staging Patches
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible for Git to stage certain parts of files and not the rest. For example, if you make two
changes to your simplegit.rb file and want to stage one of them and not the other, doing so is very
easy in Git. From the same interactive prompt explained in the previous section, type p or 5 (for
patch). Git will ask you which files you would like to partially stage; then, for each section of the
selected files, it will display hunks of the file diff and ask if you would like to stage them, one by
one:
<p>diff --git a/lib/simplegit.rb b/lib/simplegit.rb

<p>Generally, you&rsquo;ll type y or n if you want to stage each hunk, but staging all of them in certain files or
skipping a hunk decision until later can be helpful too. If you stage one part of the file and leave
another part unstaged, your status output will look like this:

<p>The status of the simplegit.rb file is interesting. It shows you that a couple of lines are staged and a
couple are unstaged. You&rsquo;ve partially staged this file. At this point, you can exit the interactive
adding script and run git commit to commit the partially staged files.
<p>You also don&rsquo;t need to be in interactive add mode to do the partial-file staging&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can start the
same script by using git add -p or git add --patch on the command line.
<p>Furthermore, you can use patch mode for partially resetting files with the git reset --patch
command, for checking out parts of files with the git checkout --patch command and for stashing
parts of files with the git stash save --patch command. We&rsquo;ll go into more details on each of these
as we get to more advanced usages of these commands.
<p>Stashing and Cleaning
Often, when you&rsquo;ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want
to switch branches for a bit to work on something else. The problem is, you don&rsquo;t want to do a
commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later. The answer to this issue is the
git stash command.
<p>Stashing takes the dirty state of your working directory&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that is, your modified tracked files and
staged changes&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time
(even on a different branch).
<p>230</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>
<p>Migrating to git stash push
<p>As of late October 2017, there has been extensive discussion on the Git mailing list,
wherein the command git stash save is being deprecated in favour of the existing
alternative git stash push. The main reason for this is that git stash push
introduces the option of stashing selected pathspecs, something git stash save
does not support.
<p>git stash save is not going away any time soon, so don&rsquo;t worry about it suddenly
disappearing. But you might want to start migrating over to the push alternative
for the new functionality.
<p>Stashing Your Work
<p>To demonstrate stashing, you&rsquo;ll go into your project and start working on a couple of files and
possibly stage one of the changes. If you run git status, you can see your dirty state:
<p>$ git status
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; modified: index.html
<p>Changes not staged for commit:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
&nbsp; (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
<p>&nbsp; modified: lib/simplegit.rb
<p>Now you want to switch branches, but you don&rsquo;t want to commit what you&rsquo;ve been working on yet,
so you&rsquo;ll stash the changes. To push a new stash onto your stack, run git stash or git stash push:
<p>$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state \
&nbsp; "WIP on master: 049d078 Create index file"
HEAD is now at 049d078 Create index file
(To restore them type "git stash apply")
<p>You can now see that your working directory is clean:
<p>$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
<p>At this point, you can switch branches and do work elsewhere; your changes are stored on your
stack. To see which stashes you&rsquo;ve stored, you can use git stash list:
<p>231</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 Create index file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert "Add file_size"
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 Add number to log
<p>In this case, two stashes were saved previously, so you have access to three different stashed works.
You can reapply the one you just stashed by using the command shown in the help output of the
original stash command: git stash apply. If you want to apply one of the older stashes, you can
specify it by naming it, like this: git stash apply stash@{2}. If you don&rsquo;t specify a stash, Git assumes
the most recent stash and tries to apply it:
<p>$ git stash apply

<p>no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
<p>You can see that Git re-modifies the files you reverted when you saved the stash. In this case, you
had a clean working directory when you tried to apply the stash, and you tried to apply it on the
same branch you saved it from. Having a clean working directory and applying it on the same
branch aren&rsquo;t necessary to successfully apply a stash. You can save a stash on one branch, switch to
another branch later, and try to reapply the changes. You can also have modified and uncommitted
files in your working directory when you apply a stash&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Git gives you merge conflicts if anything
no longer applies cleanly.
<p>The changes to your files were reapplied, but the file you staged before wasn&rsquo;t restaged. To do that,
you must run the git stash apply command with a --index option to tell the command to try to
reapply the staged changes. If you had run that instead, you&rsquo;d have gotten back to your original
position:

<p>The apply option only tries to apply the stashed work&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you continue to have it on your stack. To
remove it, you can run git stash drop with the name of the stash to remove:
<p>$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 Create index file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert "Add file_size"
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 Add number to log
$ git stash drop stash@{0}
Dropped stash@{0} (364e91f3f268f0900bc3ee613f9f733e82aaed43)
<p>You can also run git stash pop to apply the stash and then immediately drop it from your stack.
<p>Creative Stashing
<p>There are a few stash variants that may also be helpful. The first option that is quite popular is the
--keep-index option to the git stash command. This tells Git to not only include all staged content in
the stash being created, but simultaneously leave it in the index.
<p>$ git status -s
M index.html
&nbsp;M lib/simplegit.rb
<p>$ git stash --keep-index
Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: 1b65b17 added the index file
HEAD is now at 1b65b17 added the index file
<p>$ git status -s
M index.html
<p>Another common thing you may want to do with stash is to stash the untracked files as well as the
tracked ones. By default, git stash will stash only modified and staged tracked files. If you specify
--include-untracked or -u, Git will include untracked files in the stash being created. However,
including untracked files in the stash will still not include explicitly ignored files; to additionally
include ignored files, use --all (or just -a).

$
<p>Finally, if you specify the --patch flag, Git will not stash everything that is modified but will instead
prompt you interactively which of the changes you would like to stash and which you would like to
keep in your working directory.
<p>$ git stash --patch

<p>Creating a Branch from a Stash
<p>If you stash some work, leave it there for a while, and continue on the branch from which you
stashed the work, you may have a problem reapplying the work. If the apply tries to modify a file
that you&rsquo;ve since modified, you&rsquo;ll get a merge conflict and will have to try to resolve it. If you want
an easier way to test the stashed changes again, you can run git stash branch &lt;new branchname&gt;,
which creates a new branch for you with your selected branch name, checks out the commit you
were on when you stashed your work, reapplies your work there, and then drops the stash if it
applies successfully:

<p>This is a nice shortcut to recover stashed work easily and work on it in a new branch.
<p>Cleaning your Working Directory
<p>Finally, you may not want to stash some work or files in your working directory, but simply get rid
of them; that&rsquo;s what the git clean command is for.
<p>Some common reasons for cleaning your working directory might be to remove cruft that has been
generated by merges or external tools or to remove build artifacts in order to run a clean build.
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to be pretty careful with this command, since it&rsquo;s designed to remove files from your
working directory that are not tracked. If you change your mind, there is often no retrieving the
content of those files. A safer option is to run git stash --all to remove everything but save it in a
stash.
<p>Assuming you do want to remove cruft files or clean your working directory, you can do so with git
clean. To remove all the untracked files in your working directory, you can run git clean -f -d,
which removes any files and also any subdirectories that become empty as a result. The -f means
force or &ldquo;really do this,&rdquo; and is required if the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not
explicitly set to false.
<p>If you ever want to see what it would do, you can run the command with the --dry-run (or -n)
option, which means &ldquo;do a dry run and tell me what you would have removed&rdquo;.
<p>$ git clean -d -n
Would remove test.o
Would remove tmp/
<p>By default, the git clean command will only remove untracked files that are not ignored. Any file
that matches a pattern in your .gitignore or other ignore files will not be removed. If you want to
<p>235</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>remove those files too, such as to remove all .o files generated from a build so you can do a fully
clean build, you can add a -x to the clean command.
<p>$ git status -s
&nbsp;M lib/simplegit.rb
?? build.TMP
?? tmp/
<p>$ git clean -n -d
Would remove build.TMP
Would remove tmp/
<p>$ git clean -n -d -x
Would remove build.TMP
Would remove test.o
Would remove tmp/
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what the git clean command is going to do, always run it with a -n first to double
check before changing the -n to a -f and doing it for real. The other way you can be careful about
the process is to run it with the -i or &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; flag.
<p>This will run the clean command in an interactive mode.
<p>$ git clean -x -i
Would remove the following items:
&nbsp; build.TMP test.o
*** Commands ***
&nbsp; 1: clean 2: filter by pattern 3: select by numbers 4: ask
each 5: quit
&nbsp; 6: help
What now&gt;
<p>This way you can step through each file individually or specify patterns for deletion interactively.
<p>
<p>There is a quirky situation where you might need to be extra forceful in asking Git
to clean your working directory. If you happen to be in a working directory under
which you&rsquo;ve copied or cloned other Git repositories (perhaps as submodules),
even git clean -fd will refuse to delete those directories. In cases like that, you
need to add a second -f option for emphasis.
<p>Signing Your Work
Git is cryptographically secure, but it&rsquo;s not foolproof. If you&rsquo;re taking work from others on the
internet and want to verify that commits are actually from a trusted source, Git has a few ways to
sign and verify work using GPG.
<p>236</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>GPG Introduction
<p>First of all, if you want to sign anything you need to get GPG configured and your personal key
installed.
<p>$ gpg --list-keys
/Users/schacon/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
---------------------------------
pub 2048R/0A46826A 2014-06-04
uid Scott Chacon (Git signing key) &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
sub 2048R/874529A9 2014-06-04
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a key installed, you can generate one with gpg --gen-key.
<p>$ gpg --gen-key
<p>Once you have a private key to sign with, you can configure Git to use it for signing things by setting
the user.signingkey config setting.
<p>$ git config --global user.signingkey 0A46826A
<p>Now Git will use your key by default to sign tags and commits if you want.
<p>Signing Tags
<p>If you have a GPG private key setup, you can now use it to sign new tags. All you have to do is use -s
instead of -a:
<p>$ git tag -s v1.5 -m 'my signed 1.5 tag'
<p>You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Ben Straub &lt;ben@straub.cc&gt;"
2048-bit RSA key, ID 800430EB, created 2014-05-04
<p>If you run git show on that tag, you can see your GPG signature attached to it:

<p>Verifying Tags
<p>To verify a signed tag, you use git tag -v &lt;tag-name&gt;. This command uses GPG to verify the
signature. You need the signer&rsquo;s public key in your keyring for this to work properly:
<p>$ git tag -v v1.4.2.1

<p>Signing Commits
<p>In more recent versions of Git (v1.7.9 and above), you can now also sign individual commits. If
you&rsquo;re interested in signing commits directly instead of just the tags, all you need to do is add a -S to
your git commit command.

<p>Everyone Must Sign
<p>Signing tags and commits is great, but if you decide to use this in your normal workflow, you&rsquo;ll have
to make sure that everyone on your team understands how to do so. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll end up
spending a lot of time helping people figure out how to rewrite their commits with signed versions.
Make sure you understand GPG and the benefits of signing things before adopting this as part of
your standard workflow.
<p>Searching
With just about any size codebase, you&rsquo;ll often need to find where a function is called or defined, or
display the history of a method. Git provides a couple of useful tools for looking through the code
and commits stored in its database quickly and easily. We&rsquo;ll go through a few of them.
<p>240</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Git Grep
<p>Git ships with a command called grep that allows you to easily search through any committed tree,
the working directory, or even the index for a string or regular expression. For the examples that
follow, we&rsquo;ll search through the source code for Git itself.
<p>By default, git grep will look through the files in your working directory. As a first variation, you
can use either of the -n or --line-number options to print out the line numbers where Git has found
matches:
<p>$ git grep -n gmtime_r
compat/gmtime.c:3:#undef gmtime_r
compat/gmtime.c:8: return git_gmtime_r(timep, &amp;result);
compat/gmtime.c:11:struct tm *git_gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result)
compat/gmtime.c:16: ret = gmtime_r(timep, result);
compat/mingw.c:826:struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result)
compat/mingw.h:206:struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result);
date.c:482: if (gmtime_r(&amp;now, &amp;now_tm))
date.c:545: if (gmtime_r(&amp;time, tm)) {
date.c:758: /* gmtime_r() in match_digit() may have clobbered it */
git-compat-util.h:1138:struct tm *git_gmtime_r(const time_t *, struct tm *);
git-compat-util.h:1140:#define gmtime_r git_gmtime_r
<p>In addition to the basic search shown above, git grep supports a plethora of other interesting
options.
<p>For instance, instead of printing all of the matches, you can ask git grep to summarize the output
by showing you only which files contained the search string and how many matches there were in
each file with the -c or --count option:
<p>$ git grep --count gmtime_r
compat/gmtime.c:4
compat/mingw.c:1
compat/mingw.h:1
date.c:3
git-compat-util.h:2
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the context of a search string, you can display the enclosing method or
function for each matching string with either of the -p or --show-function options:
<p>241</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git grep -p gmtime_r *.c
date.c=static int match_multi_number(timestamp_t num, char c, const char *date,
date.c: if (gmtime_r(&amp;now, &amp;now_tm))
date.c=static int match_digit(const char *date, struct tm *tm, int *offset, int
*tm_gmt)
date.c: if (gmtime_r(&amp;time, tm)) {
date.c=int parse_date_basic(const char *date, timestamp_t *timestamp, int *offset)
date.c: /* gmtime_r() in match_digit() may have clobbered it */
<p>As you can see, the gmtime_r routine is called from both the match_multi_number and match_digit
functions in the date.c file (the third match displayed represents just the string appearing in a
comment).
<p>You can also search for complex combinations of strings with the --and flag, which ensures that
multiple matches must occur in the same line of text. For instance, let&rsquo;s look for any lines that
define a constant whose name contains either of the substrings &ldquo;LINK&rdquo; or &ldquo;BUF_MAX&rdquo;, specifically
in an older version of the Git codebase represented by the tag v1.8.0 (we&rsquo;ll throw in the --break and
--heading options which help split up the output into a more readable format):
<p>$ git grep --break --heading \
&nbsp; -n -e '#define' --and \( -e LINK -e BUF_MAX \) v1.8.0
v1.8.0:builtin/index-pack.c
62:#define FLAG_LINK (1u&lt;&lt;20)
<p>v1.8.0:cache.h
73:#define S_IFGITLINK 0160000
74:#define S_ISGITLINK(m) (((m) &amp; S_IFMT) == S_IFGITLINK)
<p>v1.8.0:environment.c
54:#define OBJECT_CREATION_MODE OBJECT_CREATION_USES_HARDLINKS
<p>v1.8.0:strbuf.c
326:#define STRBUF_MAXLINK (2*PATH_MAX)
<p>v1.8.0:symlinks.c
53:#define FL_SYMLINK (1 &lt;&lt; 2)
<p>v1.8.0:zlib.c
30:/* #define ZLIB_BUF_MAX ((uInt)-1) */
31:#define ZLIB_BUF_MAX ((uInt) 1024 * 1024 * 1024) /* 1GB */
<p>The git grep command has a few advantages over normal searching commands like grep and ack.
The first is that it&rsquo;s really fast, the second is that you can search through any tree in Git, not just the
working directory. As we saw in the above example, we looked for terms in an older version of the
Git source code, not the version that was currently checked out.
<p>242</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Git Log Searching
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re looking not for where a term exists, but when it existed or was introduced. The git
log command has a number of powerful tools for finding specific commits by the content of their
messages or even the content of the diff they introduce.
<p>If, for example, we want to find out when the ZLIB_BUF_MAX constant was originally introduced, we
can use the -S option (colloquially referred to as the Git &ldquo;pickaxe&rdquo; option) to tell Git to show us only
those commits that changed the number of occurrences of that string.
<p>$ git log -S ZLIB_BUF_MAX --oneline
e01503b zlib: allow feeding more than 4GB in one go
ef49a7a zlib: zlib can only process 4GB at a time
<p>If we look at the diff of those commits, we can see that in ef49a7a the constant was introduced and
in e01503b it was modified.
<p>If you need to be more specific, you can provide a regular expression to search for with the -G
option.
<p>Line Log Search
<p>Another fairly advanced log search that is insanely useful is the line history search. Simply run git
log with the -L option, and it will show you the history of a function or line of code in your
codebase.
<p>For example, if we wanted to see every change made to the function git_deflate_bound in the zlib.c
file, we could run git log -L :git_deflate_bound:zlib.c. This will try to figure out what the bounds
of that function are and then look through the history and show us every change that was made to
the function as a series of patches back to when the function was first created.

<p>If Git can&rsquo;t figure out how to match a function or method in your programming language, you can
also provide it with a regular expression (or regex). For example, this would have done the same
thing as the example above: git log -L '/unsigned long git_deflate_bound/',/^}/:zlib.c. You
could also give it a range of lines or a single line number and you&rsquo;ll get the same sort of output.
<p>Rewriting History
Many times, when working with Git, you may want to revise your local commit history. One of the
great things about Git is that it allows you to make decisions at the last possible moment. You can
decide what files go into which commits right before you commit with the staging area, you can
decide that you didn&rsquo;t mean to be working on something yet with git stash, and you can rewrite
commits that already happened so they look like they happened in a different way. This can involve
changing the order of the commits, changing messages or modifying files in a commit, squashing
<p>244</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>together or splitting apart commits, or removing commits entirely&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;all before you share your
work with others.
<p>In this section, you&rsquo;ll see how to accomplish these tasks so that you can make your commit history
look the way you want before you share it with others.
<p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t push your work until you&rsquo;re happy with it
<p>One of the cardinal rules of Git is that, since so much work is local within your
clone, you have a great deal of freedom to rewrite your history locally. However,
once you push your work, it is a different story entirely, and you should consider
pushed work as final unless you have good reason to change it. In short, you
should avoid pushing your work until you&rsquo;re happy with it and ready to share it
with the rest of the world.
<p>Changing the Last Commit
<p>Changing your most recent commit is probably the most common rewriting of history that you&rsquo;ll
do. You&rsquo;ll often want to do two basic things to your last commit: simply change the commit message,
or change the actual content of the commit by adding, removing and modifying files.
<p>If you simply want to modify your last commit message, that&rsquo;s easy:
<p>$ git commit --amend
<p>The command above loads the previous commit message into an editor session, where you can
make changes to the message, save those changes and exit. When you save and close the editor, the
editor writes a new commit containing that updated commit message and makes it your new last
commit.
<p>If, on the other hand, you want to change the actual content of your last commit, the process works
basically the same way&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;first make the changes you think you forgot, stage those changes, and the
subsequent git commit --amend replaces that last commit with your new, improved commit.
<p>You need to be careful with this technique because amending changes the SHA-1 of the commit. It&rsquo;s
like a very small rebase&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;don&rsquo;t amend your last commit if you&rsquo;ve already pushed it.
<p>245</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>
<p>An amended commit may (or may not) need an amended commit message
<p>When you amend a commit, you have the opportunity to change both the commit
message and the content of the commit. If you amend the content of the commit
substantially, you should almost certainly update the commit message to reflect
that amended content.
<p>On the other hand, if your amendments are suitably trivial (fixing a silly typo or
adding a file you forgot to stage) such that the earlier commit message is just fine,
you can simply make the changes, stage them, and avoid the unnecessary editor
session entirely with:
<p>$ git commit --amend --no-edit
<p>Changing Multiple Commit Messages
<p>To modify a commit that is farther back in your history, you must move to more complex tools. Git
doesn&rsquo;t have a modify-history tool, but you can use the rebase tool to rebase a series of commits
onto the HEAD they were originally based on instead of moving them to another one. With the
interactive rebase tool, you can then stop after each commit you want to modify and change the
message, add files, or do whatever you wish. You can run rebase interactively by adding the -i
option to git rebase. You must indicate how far back you want to rewrite commits by telling the
command which commit to rebase onto.
<p>For example, if you want to change the last three commit messages, or any of the commit messages
in that group, you supply as an argument to git rebase -i the parent of the last commit you want to
edit, which is HEAD~2^ or HEAD~3. It may be easier to remember the ~3 because you&rsquo;re trying to edit
the last three commits, but keep in mind that you&rsquo;re actually designating four commits ago, the
parent of the last commit you want to edit:
<p>$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
<p>Remember again that this is a rebasing command&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;every commit in the range HEAD~3..HEAD with a
changed message and all of its descendants will be rewritten. Don&rsquo;t include any commit you&rsquo;ve
already pushed to a central server&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;doing so will confuse other developers by providing an
alternate version of the same change.
<p>Running this command gives you a list of commits in your text editor that looks something like this:
<p>246</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>pick f7f3f6d Change my name a bit
pick 310154e Update README formatting and add blame
pick a5f4a0d Add cat-file
<p># Rebase 710f0f8..a5f4a0d onto 710f0f8
#
# Commands:
# p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit
# r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec &lt;command&gt; = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop &lt;commit&gt; = remove commit
# l, label &lt;label&gt; = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset &lt;label&gt; = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C &lt;commit&gt; | -c &lt;commit&gt;] &lt;label&gt; [# &lt;oneline&gt;]
# . create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# . message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# . specified). Use -c &lt;commit&gt; to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that these commits are listed in the opposite order than you normally see
them using the log command. If you run a log, you see something like this:
<p>$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" HEAD~3..HEAD
a5f4a0d Add cat-file
310154e Update README formatting and add blame
f7f3f6d Change my name a bit
<p>Notice the reverse order. The interactive rebase gives you a script that it&rsquo;s going to run. It will start
at the commit you specify on the command line (HEAD~3) and replay the changes introduced in each
of these commits from top to bottom. It lists the oldest at the top, rather than the newest, because
that&rsquo;s the first one it will replay.
<p>You need to edit the script so that it stops at the commit you want to edit. To do so, change the word
&lsquo;pick&rsquo; to the word &lsquo;edit&rsquo; for each of the commits you want the script to stop after. For example, to
modify only the third commit message, you change the file to look like this:
<p>247</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>edit f7f3f6d Change my name a bit
pick 310154e Update README formatting and add blame
pick a5f4a0d Add cat-file
<p>When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds you back to the last commit in that list and drops
you on the command line with the following message:
<p>$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
Stopped at f7f3f6d... changed my name a bit
You can amend the commit now, with
<p>&nbsp; git commit --amend
<p>Once you're satisfied with your changes, run
<p>&nbsp; git rebase --continue
<p>These instructions tell you exactly what to do. Type
<p>$ git commit --amend
<p>Change the commit message, and exit the editor. Then, run
<p>$ git rebase --continue
<p>This command will apply the other two commits automatically, and then you&rsquo;re done. If you change
pick to edit on more lines, you can repeat these steps for each commit you change to edit. Each
time, Git will stop, let you amend the commit, and continue when you&rsquo;re finished.
<p>Reordering Commits
<p>You can also use interactive rebases to reorder or remove commits entirely. If you want to remove
the &ldquo;added cat-file&rdquo; commit and change the order in which the other two commits are introduced,
you can change the rebase script from this
<p>pick f7f3f6d Change my name a bit
pick 310154e Update README formatting and add blame
pick a5f4a0d Add cat-file
<p>to this:
<p>pick 310154e Update README formatting and add blame
pick f7f3f6d Change my name a bit
<p>248</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds your branch to the parent of these commits, applies
310154e and then f7f3f6d, and then stops. You effectively change the order of those commits and
remove the &ldquo;added cat-file&rdquo; commit completely.
<p>Squashing Commits
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to take a series of commits and squash them down into a single commit with the
interactive rebasing tool. The script puts helpful instructions in the rebase message:
<p>#
# Commands:
# p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit
# r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec &lt;command&gt; = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop &lt;commit&gt; = remove commit
# l, label &lt;label&gt; = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset &lt;label&gt; = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C &lt;commit&gt; | -c &lt;commit&gt;] &lt;label&gt; [# &lt;oneline&gt;]
# . create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# . message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# . specified). Use -c &lt;commit&gt; to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
<p>If, instead of &ldquo;pick&rdquo; or &ldquo;edit&rdquo;, you specify &ldquo;squash&rdquo;, Git applies both that change and the change
directly before it and makes you merge the commit messages together. So, if you want to make a
single commit from these three commits, you make the script look like this:
<p>pick f7f3f6d Change my name a bit
squash 310154e Update README formatting and add blame
squash a5f4a0d Add cat-file
<p>When you save and exit the editor, Git applies all three changes and then puts you back into the
editor to merge the three commit messages:
<p>249</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p># This is a combination of 3 commits.
# The first commit's message is:
Change my name a bit
<p># This is the 2nd commit message:
<p>Update README formatting and add blame
<p># This is the 3rd commit message:
<p>Add cat-file
<p>When you save that, you have a single commit that introduces the changes of all three previous
commits.
<p>Splitting a Commit
<p>Splitting a commit undoes a commit and then partially stages and commits as many times as
commits you want to end up with. For example, suppose you want to split the middle commit of
your three commits. Instead of &ldquo;Update README formatting and add blame&rdquo;, you want to split it
into two commits: &ldquo;Update README formatting&rdquo; for the first, and &ldquo;Add blame&rdquo; for the second. You
can do that in the rebase -i script by changing the instruction on the commit you want to split to
&ldquo;edit&rdquo;:
<p>pick f7f3f6d Change my name a bit
edit 310154e Update README formatting and add blame
pick a5f4a0d Add cat-file
<p>Then, when the script drops you to the command line, you reset that commit, take the changes that
have been reset, and create multiple commits out of them. When you save and exit the editor, Git
rewinds to the parent of the first commit in your list, applies the first commit (f7f3f6d), applies the
second (310154e), and drops you to the console. There, you can do a mixed reset of that commit with
git reset HEAD^, which effectively undoes that commit and leaves the modified files unstaged. Now
you can stage and commit files until you have several commits, and run git rebase --continue
when you&rsquo;re done:
<p>$ git reset HEAD^
$ git add README
$ git commit -m 'Update README formatting'
$ git add lib/simplegit.rb
$ git commit -m 'Add blame'
$ git rebase --continue
<p>Git applies the last commit (a5f4a0d) in the script, and your history looks like this:
<p>250</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git log -4 --pretty=format:"%h %s"
1c002dd Add cat-file
9b29157 Add blame
35cfb2b Update README formatting
f3cc40e Change my name a bit
<p>Once again, this changes the SHA-1s of all the commits in your list, so make sure no commit shows
up in that list that you&rsquo;ve already pushed to a shared repository.
<p>The Nuclear Option: filter-branch
<p>There is another history-rewriting option that you can use if you need to rewrite a larger number of
commits in some scriptable way&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;for instance, changing your email address globally or removing
a file from every commit. The command is filter-branch, and it can rewrite huge swaths of your
history, so you probably shouldn&rsquo;t use it unless your project isn&rsquo;t yet public and other people
haven&rsquo;t based work off the commits you&rsquo;re about to rewrite. However, it can be very useful. You&rsquo;ll
learn a few of the common uses so you can get an idea of some of the things it&rsquo;s capable of.
<p>
<p>git filter-branch has many pitfalls, and is no longer the recommended way to
rewrite history. Instead, consider using git-filter-repo, which is a Python script
that does a better job for most applications where you would normally turn to
filter-branch. Its documentation and source code can be found at
https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo.
<p>Removing a File from Every Commit
<p>This occurs fairly commonly. Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless
git add ., and you want to remove it everywhere. Perhaps you accidentally committed a file that
contained a password, and you want to make your project open source. filter-branch is the tool
you probably want to use to scrub your entire history. To remove a file named passwords.txt from
your entire history, you can use the --tree-filter option to filter-branch:
<p>$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
Rewrite 6b9b3cf04e7c5686a9cb838c3f36a8cb6a0fc2bd (21/21)
Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten
<p>The --tree-filter option runs the specified command after each checkout of the project and then
recommits the results. In this case, you remove a file called passwords.txt from every snapshot,
whether it exists or not. If you want to remove all accidentally committed editor backup files, you
can run something like git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f *~' HEAD.
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to watch Git rewriting trees and commits and then move the branch pointer at the
end. It&rsquo;s generally a good idea to do this in a testing branch and then hard-reset your master branch
after you&rsquo;ve determined the outcome is what you really want. To run filter-branch on all your
branches, you can pass --all to the command.

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Making a Subdirectory the New Root
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;ve done an import from another source control system and have subdirectories that
make no sense (trunk, tags, and so on). If you want to make the trunk subdirectory be the new
project root for every commit, filter-branch can help you do that, too:
<p>$ git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter trunk HEAD
Rewrite 856f0bf61e41a27326cdae8f09fe708d679f596f (12/12)
Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten
<p>Now your new project root is what was in the trunk subdirectory each time. Git will also
automatically remove commits that did not affect the subdirectory.
<p>Changing Email Addresses Globally
<p>Another common case is that you forgot to run git config to set your name and email address
before you started working, or perhaps you want to open-source a project at work and change all
your work email addresses to your personal address. In any case, you can change email addresses
in multiple commits in a batch with filter-branch as well. You need to be careful to change only the
email addresses that are yours, so you use --commit-filter:
<p>$ git filter-branch --commit-filter '
&nbsp; if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "schacon@localhost" ];
&nbsp; then
&nbsp; GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Scott Chacon";
&nbsp; GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="schacon@example.com";
&nbsp; git commit-tree "$@";
&nbsp; else
&nbsp; git commit-tree "$@";
&nbsp; fi' HEAD
<p>This goes through and rewrites every commit to have your new address. Because commits contain
the SHA-1 values of their parents, this command changes every commit SHA-1 in your history, not
just those that have the matching email address.
<p>Reset Demystified
Before moving on to more specialized tools, let&rsquo;s talk about the Git reset and checkout commands.
These commands are two of the most confusing parts of Git when you first encounter them. They
do so many things that it seems hopeless to actually understand them and employ them properly.
For this, we recommend a simple metaphor.
<p>The Three Trees
<p>An easier way to think about reset and checkout is through the mental frame of Git being a content
manager of three different trees. By &ldquo;tree&rdquo; here, we really mean &ldquo;collection of files&rdquo;, not specifically
the data structure. (There are a few cases where the index doesn&rsquo;t exactly act like a tree, but for our
<p>252</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>purposes it is easier to think about it this way for now.)
<p>Git as a system manages and manipulates three trees in its normal operation:
<p>Tree Role
<p>HEAD Last commit snapshot, next parent
<p>Index Proposed next commit snapshot
<p>Working Directory Sandbox
<p>The HEAD
<p>HEAD is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit
made on that branch. That means HEAD will be the parent of the next commit that is created. It&rsquo;s
generally simplest to think of HEAD as the snapshot of your last commit on that branch.
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to see what that snapshot looks like. Here is an example of getting the actual
directory listing and SHA-1 checksums for each file in the HEAD snapshot:
<p>$ git cat-file -p HEAD
tree cfda3bf379e4f8dba8717dee55aab78aef7f4daf
author Scott Chacon 1301511835 -0700
committer Scott Chacon 1301511835 -0700
<p>initial commit
<p>$ git ls-tree -r HEAD
100644 blob a906cb2a4a904a152... README
100644 blob 8f94139338f9404f2... Rakefile
040000 tree 99f1a6d12cb4b6f19... lib
<p>The Git cat-file and ls-tree commands are &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; commands that are used for lower level
things and not really used in day-to-day work, but they help us see what&rsquo;s going on here.
<p>The Index
<p>The index is your proposed next commit. We&rsquo;ve also been referring to this concept as Git&rsquo;s &ldquo;Staging
Area&rdquo; as this is what Git looks at when you run git commit.
<p>Git populates this index with a list of all the file contents that were last checked out into your
working directory and what they looked like when they were originally checked out. You then
replace some of those files with new versions of them, and git commit converts that into the tree for
a new commit.
<p>$ git ls-files -s
100644 a906cb2a4a904a152e80877d4088654daad0c859 0 README
100644 8f94139338f9404f26296befa88755fc2598c289 0 Rakefile
100644 47c6340d6459e05787f644c2447d2595f5d3a54b 0 lib/simplegit.rb
<p>253</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Again, here we&rsquo;re using git ls-files, which is more of a behind the scenes command that shows
you what your index currently looks like.
<p>The index is not technically a tree structure&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s actually implemented as a flattened
manifest&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but for our purposes it&rsquo;s close enough.
<p>The Working Directory
<p>Finally, you have your working directory (also commonly referred to as the &ldquo;working tree&rdquo;). The
other two trees store their content in an efficient but inconvenient manner, inside the .git folder.
The working directory unpacks them into actual files, which makes it much easier for you to edit
them. Think of the working directory as a sandbox, where you can try changes out before
committing them to your staging area (index) and then to history.
<p>$ tree
.
├── README
├── Rakefile
└── lib
&nbsp; └── simplegit.rb
<p>1 directory, 3 files
<p>The Workflow
<p>Git&rsquo;s typical workflow is to record snapshots of your project in successively better states, by
manipulating these three trees.
<p>Let&rsquo;s visualize this process: say you go into a new directory with a single file in it. We&rsquo;ll call this v1
of the file, and we&rsquo;ll indicate it in blue. Now we run git init, which will create a Git repository with
<p>254</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>a HEAD reference which points to the unborn master branch.
<p>At this point, only the working directory tree has any content.
<p>Now we want to commit this file, so we use git add to take content in the working directory and
copy it to the index.
<p>255</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Then we run git commit, which takes the contents of the index and saves it as a permanent
snapshot, creates a commit object which points to that snapshot, and updates master to point to that
commit.
<p>256</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>If we run git status, we&rsquo;ll see no changes, because all three trees are the same.
<p>Now we want to make a change to that file and commit it. We&rsquo;ll go through the same process; first,
we change the file in our working directory. Let&rsquo;s call this v2 of the file, and indicate it in red.
<p>257</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>If we run git status right now, we&rsquo;ll see the file in red as &ldquo;Changes not staged for commit&rdquo;, because
that entry differs between the index and the working directory. Next we run git add on it to stage it
into our index.
<p>258</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>At this point, if we run git status, we will see the file in green under &ldquo;Changes to be committed&rdquo;
because the index and HEAD differ&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that is, our proposed next commit is now different from our
last commit. Finally, we run git commit to finalize the commit.
<p>259</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Now git status will give us no output, because all three trees are the same again.
<p>Switching branches or cloning goes through a similar process. When you checkout a branch, it
changes HEAD to point to the new branch ref, populates your index with the snapshot of that
commit, then copies the contents of the index into your working Directory.
<p>The Role of Reset
<p>The reset command makes more sense when viewed in this context.
<p>For the purposes of these examples, let&rsquo;s say that we&rsquo;ve modified file.txt again and committed it a
third time. So now our history looks like this:
<p>260</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now walk through exactly what reset does when you call it. It directly manipulates these three
trees in a simple and predictable way. It does up to three basic operations.
<p>Step 1: Move HEAD
<p>The first thing reset will do is move what HEAD points to. This isn&rsquo;t the same as changing HEAD
itself (which is what checkout does); reset moves the branch that HEAD is pointing to. This means if
HEAD is set to the master branch (i.e. you&rsquo;re currently on the master branch), running git reset
9e5e6a4 will start by making master point to 9e5e6a4.
<p>261</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>No matter what form of reset with a commit you invoke, this is the first thing it will always try to
do. With reset --soft, it will simply stop there.
<p>Now take a second to look at that diagram and realize what happened: it essentially undid the last
git commit command. When you run git commit, Git creates a new commit and moves the branch
that HEAD points to up to it. When you reset back to HEAD~ (the parent of HEAD), you are moving
the branch back to where it was, without changing the index or working directory. You could now
update the index and run git commit again to accomplish what git commit --amend would have done
(see Changing the Last Commit).
<p>Step 2: Updating the Index (--mixed)
<p>Note that if you run git status now you&rsquo;ll see in green the difference between the index and what
the new HEAD is.
<p>The next thing reset will do is to update the index with the contents of whatever snapshot HEAD
now points to.
<p>262</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>If you specify the --mixed option, reset will stop at this point. This is also the default, so if you
specify no option at all (just git reset HEAD~ in this case), this is where the command will stop.
<p>Now take another second to look at that diagram and realize what happened: it still undid your last
commit, but also unstaged everything. You rolled back to before you ran all your git add and git
commit commands.
<p>Step 3: Updating the Working Directory (--hard)
<p>The third thing that reset will do is to make the working directory look like the index. If you use the
--hard option, it will continue to this stage.
<p>263</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about what just happened. You undid your last commit, the git add and git commit
commands, and all the work you did in your working directory.
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that this flag (--hard) is the only way to make the reset command dangerous,
and one of the very few cases where Git will actually destroy data. Any other invocation of reset
can be pretty easily undone, but the --hard option cannot, since it forcibly overwrites files in the
working directory. In this particular case, we still have the v3 version of our file in a commit in our
Git DB, and we could get it back by looking at our reflog, but if we had not committed it, Git still
would have overwritten the file and it would be unrecoverable.
<p>Recap
<p>The reset command overwrites these three trees in a specific order, stopping when you tell it to:
<p>1. Move the branch HEAD points to (stop here if --soft)
<p>2. Make the index look like HEAD (stop here unless --hard)
<p>3. Make the working directory look like the index
<p>264</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Reset With a Path
<p>That covers the behavior of reset in its basic form, but you can also provide it with a path to act
upon. If you specify a path, reset will skip step 1, and limit the remainder of its actions to a specific
file or set of files. This actually sort of makes sense&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;HEAD is just a pointer, and you can&rsquo;t point to
part of one commit and part of another. But the index and working directory can be partially
updated, so reset proceeds with steps 2 and 3.
<p>So, assume we run git reset file.txt. This form (since you did not specify a commit SHA-1 or
branch, and you didn&rsquo;t specify --soft or --hard) is shorthand for git reset --mixed HEAD file.txt,
which will:
<p>1. Move the branch HEAD points to (skipped)
<p>2. Make the index look like HEAD (stop here)
<p>So it essentially just copies file.txt from HEAD to the index.
<p>This has the practical effect of unstaging the file. If we look at the diagram for that command and
think about what git add does, they are exact opposites.
<p>265</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>This is why the output of the git status command suggests that you run this to unstage a file. (See
Unstaging a Staged File for more on this.)
<p>We could just as easily not let Git assume we meant &ldquo;pull the data from HEAD&rdquo; by specifying a
specific commit to pull that file version from. We would just run something like git reset eb43bf
file.txt.
<p>266</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>This effectively does the same thing as if we had reverted the content of the file to v1 in the
working directory, ran git add on it, then reverted it back to v3 again (without actually going
through all those steps). If we run git commit now, it will record a change that reverts that file back
to v1, even though we never actually had it in our working directory again.
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that like git add, the reset command will accept a --patch option to
unstage content on a hunk-by-hunk basis. So you can selectively unstage or revert content.
<p>Squashing
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how to do something interesting with this newfound power&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;squashing commits.
<p>Say you have a series of commits with messages like &ldquo;oops.&rdquo;, &ldquo;WIP&rdquo; and &ldquo;forgot this file&rdquo;. You can
use reset to quickly and easily squash them into a single commit that makes you look really smart.
(Squashing Commits shows another way to do this, but in this example it&rsquo;s simpler to use reset.)
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have a project where the first commit has one file, the second commit added a new
file and changed the first, and the third commit changed the first file again. The second commit was
a work in progress and you want to squash it down.
<p>267</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>You can run git reset --soft HEAD~2 to move the HEAD branch back to an older commit (the most
recent commit you want to keep):
<p>268</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>And then simply run git commit again:
<p>269</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Now you can see that your reachable history, the history you would push, now looks like you had
one commit with file-a.txt v1, then a second that both modified file-a.txt to v3 and added file-
b.txt. The commit with the v2 version of the file is no longer in the history.
<p>Check It Out
<p>Finally, you may wonder what the difference between checkout and reset is. Like reset, checkout
manipulates the three trees, and it is a bit different depending on whether you give the command a
file path or not.
<p>270</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Without Paths
<p>Running git checkout [branch] is pretty similar to running git reset --hard [branch] in that it
updates all three trees for you to look like [branch], but there are two important differences.
<p>First, unlike reset --hard, checkout is working-directory safe; it will check to make sure it&rsquo;s not
blowing away files that have changes to them. Actually, it&rsquo;s a bit smarter than that&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it tries to do a
trivial merge in the working directory, so all of the files you haven&rsquo;t changed will be updated. reset
--hard, on the other hand, will simply replace everything across the board without checking.
<p>The second important difference is how checkout updates HEAD. Whereas reset will move the
branch that HEAD points to, checkout will move HEAD itself to point to another branch.
<p>For instance, say we have master and develop branches which point at different commits, and we&rsquo;re
currently on develop (so HEAD points to it). If we run git reset master, develop itself will now point
to the same commit that master does. If we instead run git checkout master, develop does not move,
HEAD itself does. HEAD will now point to master.
<p>So, in both cases we&rsquo;re moving HEAD to point to commit A, but how we do so is very different. reset
will move the branch HEAD points to, checkout moves HEAD itself.
<p>With Paths
<p>The other way to run checkout is with a file path, which, like reset, does not move HEAD. It is just
like git reset [branch] file in that it updates the index with that file at that commit, but it also
<p>271</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>overwrites the file in the working directory. It would be exactly like git reset --hard [branch] file
(if reset would let you run that)&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s not working-directory safe, and it does not move HEAD.
<p>Also, like git reset and git add, checkout will accept a --patch option to allow you to selectively
revert file contents on a hunk-by-hunk basis.
<p>Summary
<p>Hopefully now you understand and feel more comfortable with the reset command, but are
probably still a little confused about how exactly it differs from checkout and could not possibly
remember all the rules of the different invocations.
<p>Here&rsquo;s a cheat-sheet for which commands affect which trees. The &ldquo;HEAD&rdquo; column reads &ldquo;REF&rdquo; if
that command moves the reference (branch) that HEAD points to, and &ldquo;HEAD&rdquo; if it moves HEAD
itself. Pay especial attention to the WD Safe? column&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if it says NO, take a second to think before
running that command.
<p>HEAD Index Workdir WD Safe?
<p>Commit Level
<p>reset --soft [commit] REF NO NO YES
<p>reset [commit] REF YES NO YES
<p>reset --hard [commit] REF YES YES NO
<p>checkout &lt;commit&gt; HEAD YES YES YES
<p>File Level
<p>reset [commit] &lt;paths&gt; NO YES NO YES
<p>checkout [commit] &lt;paths&gt; NO YES YES NO
<p>Advanced Merging
Merging in Git is typically fairly easy. Since Git makes it easy to merge another branch multiple
times, it means that you can have a very long lived branch but you can keep it up to date as you go,
solving small conflicts often, rather than be surprised by one enormous conflict at the end of the
series.
<p>However, sometimes tricky conflicts do occur. Unlike some other version control systems, Git does
not try to be overly clever about merge conflict resolution. Git&rsquo;s philosophy is to be smart about
determining when a merge resolution is unambiguous, but if there is a conflict, it does not try to be
clever about automatically resolving it. Therefore, if you wait too long to merge two branches that
diverge quickly, you can run into some issues.
<p>In this section, we&rsquo;ll go over what some of those issues might be and what tools Git gives you to help
handle these more tricky situations. We&rsquo;ll also cover some of the different, non-standard types of
merges you can do, as well as see how to back out of merges that you&rsquo;ve done.
<p>272</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Merge Conflicts
<p>While we covered some basics on resolving merge conflicts in Basic Merge Conflicts, for more
complex conflicts, Git provides a few tools to help you figure out what&rsquo;s going on and how to better
deal with the conflict.
<p>First of all, if at all possible, try to make sure your working directory is clean before doing a merge
that may have conflicts. If you have work in progress, either commit it to a temporary branch or
stash it. This makes it so that you can undo anything you try here. If you have unsaved changes in
your working directory when you try a merge, some of these tips may help you preserve that work.
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through a very simple example. We have a super simple Ruby file that prints hello world.
<p>#! /usr/bin/env ruby
<p>def hello
&nbsp; puts 'hello world'
end
<p>hello()
<p>In our repository, we create a new branch named whitespace and proceed to change all the Unix
line endings to DOS line endings, essentially changing every line of the file, but just with
whitespace. Then we change the line &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; to &ldquo;hello mundo&rdquo;.
<p>273</p>

<p>Now we try to merge in our whitespace branch and we&rsquo;ll get conflicts because of the whitespace
changes.
<p>$ git merge whitespace
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
<p>Aborting a Merge
<p>We now have a few options. First, let&rsquo;s cover how to get out of this situation. If you perhaps weren&rsquo;t
expecting conflicts and don&rsquo;t want to quite deal with the situation yet, you can simply back out of
the merge with git merge --abort.
<p>$ git status -sb
## master
UU hello.rb
<p>$ git merge --abort
<p>$ git status -sb
## master
<p>The git merge --abort option tries to revert back to your state before you ran the merge. The only
cases where it may not be able to do this perfectly would be if you had unstashed, uncommitted
changes in your working directory when you ran it, otherwise it should work fine.
<p>275</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>If for some reason you just want to start over, you can also run git reset --hard HEAD, and your
repository will be back to the last committed state. Remember that any uncommitted work will be
lost, so make sure you don&rsquo;t want any of your changes.
<p>Ignoring Whitespace
<p>In this specific case, the conflicts are whitespace related. We know this because the case is simple,
but it&rsquo;s also pretty easy to tell in real cases when looking at the conflict because every line is
removed on one side and added again on the other. By default, Git sees all of these lines as being
changed, so it can&rsquo;t merge the files.
<p>The default merge strategy can take arguments though, and a few of them are about properly
ignoring whitespace changes. If you see that you have a lot of whitespace issues in a merge, you can
simply abort it and do it again, this time with -Xignore-all-space or -Xignore-space-change. The first
option ignores whitespace completely when comparing lines, the second treats sequences of one or
more whitespace characters as equivalent.
<p>$ git merge -Xignore-space-change whitespace
Auto-merging hello.rb
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
&nbsp;hello.rb | 2 +-
&nbsp;1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
<p>Since in this case, the actual file changes were not conflicting, once we ignore the whitespace
changes, everything merges just fine.
<p>This is a lifesaver if you have someone on your team who likes to occasionally reformat everything
from spaces to tabs or vice-versa.
<p>Manual File Re-merging
<p>Though Git handles whitespace pre-processing pretty well, there are other types of changes that
perhaps Git can&rsquo;t handle automatically, but are scriptable fixes. As an example, let&rsquo;s pretend that Git
could not handle the whitespace change and we needed to do it by hand.
<p>What we really need to do is run the file we&rsquo;re trying to merge in through a dos2unix program
before trying the actual file merge. So how would we do that?
<p>First, we get into the merge conflict state. Then we want to get copies of my version of the file, their
version (from the branch we&rsquo;re merging in) and the common version (from where both sides
branched off). Then we want to fix up either their side or our side and re-try the merge again for
just this single file.
<p>Getting the three file versions is actually pretty easy. Git stores all of these versions in the index
under &ldquo;stages&rdquo; which each have numbers associated with them. Stage 1 is the common ancestor,
stage 2 is your version and stage 3 is from the MERGE_HEAD, the version you&rsquo;re merging in (&ldquo;theirs&rdquo;).
<p>You can extract a copy of each of these versions of the conflicted file with the git show command
and a special syntax.
<p>276</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git show :1:hello.rb &gt; hello.common.rb
$ git show :2:hello.rb &gt; hello.ours.rb
$ git show :3:hello.rb &gt; hello.theirs.rb
<p>If you want to get a little more hard core, you can also use the ls-files -u plumbing command to
get the actual SHA-1s of the Git blobs for each of these files.
<p>$ git ls-files -u
100755 ac51efdc3df4f4fd328d1a02ad05331d8e2c9111 1 hello.rb
100755 36c06c8752c78d2aff89571132f3bf7841a7b5c3 2 hello.rb
100755 e85207e04dfdd5eb0a1e9febbc67fd837c44a1cd 3 hello.rb
<p>The :1:hello.rb is just a shorthand for looking up that blob SHA-1.
<p>Now that we have the content of all three stages in our working directory, we can manually fix up
theirs to fix the whitespace issue and re-merge the file with the little-known git merge-file
command which does just that.
<p>$ dos2unix hello.theirs.rb
dos2unix: converting file hello.theirs.rb to Unix format ...
<p>$ git merge-file -p \
&nbsp; hello.ours.rb hello.common.rb hello.theirs.rb &gt; hello.rb

<p>At this point we have nicely merged the file. In fact, this actually works better than the ignore-
space-change option because this actually fixes the whitespace changes before merge instead of
simply ignoring them. In the ignore-space-change merge, we actually ended up with a few lines with
DOS line endings, making things mixed.

one side or the other, you can ask git diff to compare what is in your working directory that

<p>Checking Out Conflicts
<p>Perhaps we&rsquo;re not happy with the resolution at this point for some reason, or maybe manually
editing one or both sides still didn&rsquo;t work well and we need more context.
<p>Let&rsquo;s change up the example a little. For this example, we have two longer lived branches that each
have a few commits in them but create a legitimate content conflict when merged.
<p>$ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
* f1270f7 (HEAD, master) Update README
* 9af9d3b Create README

* b7dcc89 Initial hello world code
<p>We now have three unique commits that live only on the master branch and three others that live
on the mundo branch. If we try to merge the mundo branch in, we get a conflict.
<p>279</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git merge mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
<p>We would like to see what the merge conflict is. If we open up the file, we&rsquo;ll see something like this:
<p>#! /usr/bin/env ruby
<p>def hello
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
&nbsp; puts 'hola world'
=======
&nbsp; puts 'hello mundo'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mundo
end
<p>hello()
<p>Both sides of the merge added content to this file, but some of the commits modified the file in the
same place that caused this conflict.
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore a couple of tools that you now have at your disposal to determine how this conflict
came to be. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not obvious how exactly you should fix this conflict. You need more
context.
<p>One helpful tool is git checkout with the --conflict option. This will re-checkout the file again and
replace the merge conflict markers. This can be useful if you want to reset the markers and try to
resolve them again.
<p>You can pass --conflict either diff3 or merge (which is the default). If you pass it diff3, Git will use
a slightly different version of conflict markers, not only giving you the &ldquo;ours&rdquo; and &ldquo;theirs&rdquo; versions,
but also the &ldquo;base&rdquo; version inline to give you more context.
<p>$ git checkout --conflict=diff3 hello.rb
<p>Once we run that, the file will look like this instead:
<p>280</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>#! /usr/bin/env ruby
<p>def hello
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ours
&nbsp; puts 'hola world'
||||||| base
&nbsp; puts 'hello world'
=======
&nbsp; puts 'hello mundo'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs
end
<p>hello()
<p>If you like this format, you can set it as the default for future merge conflicts by setting the
merge.conflictstyle setting to diff3.
<p>$ git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
<p>The git checkout command can also take --ours and --theirs options, which can be a really fast
way of just choosing either one side or the other without merging things at all.
<p>This can be particularly useful for conflicts of binary files where you can simply choose one side, or
where you only want to merge certain files in from another branch&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can do the merge and
then checkout certain files from one side or the other before committing.
<p>Merge Log
<p>Another useful tool when resolving merge conflicts is git log. This can help you get context on
what may have contributed to the conflicts. Reviewing a little bit of history to remember why two
lines of development were touching the same area of code can be really helpful sometimes.
<p>To get a full list of all of the unique commits that were included in either branch involved in this
merge, we can use the &ldquo;triple dot&rdquo; syntax that we learned in Triple Dot.
<p>$ git log --oneline --left-right HEAD...MERGE_HEAD
&lt; f1270f7 Update README
&lt; 9af9d3b Create README
&lt; 694971d Update phrase to 'hola world'
&gt; e3eb223 Add more tests
&gt; 7cff591 Create initial testing script
&gt; c3ffff1 Change text to 'hello mundo'
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice list of the six total commits involved, as well as which line of development each
commit was on.
<p>We can further simplify this though to give us much more specific context. If we add the --merge
<p>281</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>option to git log, it will only show the commits in either side of the merge that touch a file that&rsquo;s
currently conflicted.
<p>$ git log --oneline --left-right --merge
&lt; 694971d Update phrase to 'hola world'
&gt; c3ffff1 Change text to 'hello mundo'
<p>If you run that with the -p option instead, you get just the diffs to the file that ended up in conflict.
This can be really helpful in quickly giving you the context you need to help understand why
something conflicts and how to more intelligently resolve it.
<p>Combined Diff Format
<p>Since Git stages any merge results that are successful, when you run git diff while in a conflicted
merge state, you only get what is currently still in conflict. This can be helpful to see what you still
have to resolve.
<p>When you run git diff directly after a merge conflict, it will give you information in a rather
unique diff output format.
<p>$ git diff
diff --cc hello.rb

<p>&nbsp; hello()
<p>The format is called &ldquo;Combined Diff&rdquo; and gives you two columns of data next to each line. The first
column shows you if that line is different (added or removed) between the &ldquo;ours&rdquo; branch and the
file in your working directory and the second column does the same between the &ldquo;theirs&rdquo; branch

<p>So in that example you can see that the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines are in the working copy but were
not in either side of the merge. This makes sense because the merge tool stuck them in there for our
context, but we&rsquo;re expected to remove them.

to a git log -p (which by default only shows patches for non-merge commits).

<p>Undoing Merges
<p>Now that you know how to create a merge commit, you&rsquo;ll probably make some by mistake. One of
the great things about working with Git is that it&rsquo;s okay to make mistakes, because it&rsquo;s possible (and
in many cases easy) to fix them.
<p>Merge commits are no different. Let&rsquo;s say you started work on a topic branch, accidentally merged
it into master, and now your commit history looks like this:
<p>284</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 138. Accidental merge commit
<p>There are two ways to approach this problem, depending on what your desired outcome is.
<p>Fix the references
<p>If the unwanted merge commit only exists on your local repository, the easiest and best solution is
to move the branches so that they point where you want them to. In most cases, if you follow the
errant git merge with git reset --hard HEAD~, this will reset the branch pointers so they look like
this:
<p>Figure 139. History after git reset --hard HEAD~
<p>We covered reset back in Reset Demystified, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to figure out what&rsquo;s going
on here. Here&rsquo;s a quick refresher: reset --hard usually goes through three steps:
<p>1. Move the branch HEAD points to. In this case, we want to move master to where it was before
the merge commit (C6).
<p>2. Make the index look like HEAD.
<p>285</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>3. Make the working directory look like the index.
<p>The downside of this approach is that it&rsquo;s rewriting history, which can be problematic with a shared
repository. Check out The Perils of Rebasing for more on what can happen; the short version is that
if other people have the commits you&rsquo;re rewriting, you should probably avoid reset. This approach
also won&rsquo;t work if any other commits have been created since the merge; moving the refs would
effectively lose those changes.
<p>Reverse the commit
<p>If moving the branch pointers around isn&rsquo;t going to work for you, Git gives you the option of
making a new commit which undoes all the changes from an existing one. Git calls this operation a
&ldquo;revert&rdquo;, and in this particular scenario, you&rsquo;d invoke it like this:
<p>$ git revert -m 1 HEAD
[master b1d8379] Revert "Merge branch 'topic'"
<p>The -m 1 flag indicates which parent is the &ldquo;mainline&rdquo; and should be kept. When you invoke a
merge into HEAD (git merge topic), the new commit has two parents: the first one is HEAD (C6), and
the second is the tip of the branch being merged in (C4). In this case, we want to undo all the
changes introduced by merging in parent #2 (C4), while keeping all the content from parent #1 (C6).
<p>The history with the revert commit looks like this:
<p>Figure 140. History after git revert -m 1
<p>The new commit ^M has exactly the same contents as C6, so starting from here it&rsquo;s as if the merge
never happened, except that the now-unmerged commits are still in HEAD's history. Git will get
confused if you try to merge topic into master again:
<p>$ git merge topic
Already up-to-date.
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in topic that isn&rsquo;t already reachable from master. What&rsquo;s worse, if you add work to
topic and merge again, Git will only bring in the changes since the reverted merge:
<p>286</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 141. History with a bad merge
<p>The best way around this is to un-revert the original merge, since now you want to bring in the
changes that were reverted out, then create a new merge commit:
<p>$ git revert ^M
[master 09f0126] Revert "Revert "Merge branch 'topic'""
$ git merge topic
<p>Figure 142. History after re-merging a reverted merge
<p>In this example, M and ^M cancel out. ^^M effectively merges in the changes from C3 and C4, and C8
merges in the changes from C7, so now topic is fully merged.
<p>Other Types of Merges
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve covered the normal merge of two branches, normally handled with what is called the
&ldquo;recursive&rdquo; strategy of merging. There are other ways to merge branches together however. Let&rsquo;s
cover a few of them quickly.
<p>Our or Theirs Preference
<p>First of all, there is another useful thing we can do with the normal &ldquo;recursive&rdquo; mode of merging.
We&rsquo;ve already seen the ignore-all-space and ignore-space-change options which are passed with a
-X but we can also tell Git to favor one side or the other when it sees a conflict.
<p>By default, when Git sees a conflict between two branches being merged, it will add merge conflict
markers into your code and mark the file as conflicted and let you resolve it. If you would prefer
for Git to simply choose a specific side and ignore the other side instead of letting you manually
<p>287</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>resolve the conflict, you can pass the merge command either a -Xours or -Xtheirs.
<p>If Git sees this, it will not add conflict markers. Any differences that are mergeable, it will merge.
Any differences that conflict, it will simply choose the side you specify in whole, including binary
files.
<p>If we go back to the &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; example we were using before, we can see that merging in our
branch causes conflicts.
<p>$ git merge mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Resolved 'hello.rb' using previous resolution.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
<p>However if we run it with -Xours or -Xtheirs it does not.
<p>$ git merge -Xours mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
&nbsp;hello.rb | 2 +-
&nbsp;test.sh | 2 ++
&nbsp;2 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
&nbsp;create mode 100644 test.sh
<p>In that case, instead of getting conflict markers in the file with &ldquo;hello mundo&rdquo; on one side and &ldquo;hola
world&rdquo; on the other, it will simply pick &ldquo;hola world&rdquo;. However, all the other non-conflicting changes
on that branch are merged successfully in.
<p>This option can also be passed to the git merge-file command we saw earlier by running
something like git merge-file --ours for individual file merges.
<p>If you want to do something like this but not have Git even try to merge changes from the other side
in, there is a more draconian option, which is the &ldquo;ours&rdquo; merge strategy. This is different from the
&ldquo;ours&rdquo; recursive merge option.
<p>This will basically do a fake merge. It will record a new merge commit with both branches as
parents, but it will not even look at the branch you&rsquo;re merging in. It will simply record as the result
of the merge the exact code in your current branch.
<p>$ git merge -s ours mundo
Merge made by the 'ours' strategy.
$ git diff HEAD HEAD~
$
<p>You can see that there is no difference between the branch we were on and the result of the merge.
<p>288</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>This can often be useful to basically trick Git into thinking that a branch is already merged when
doing a merge later on. For example, say you branched off a release branch and have done some
work on it that you will want to merge back into your master branch at some point. In the meantime
some bugfix on master needs to be backported into your release branch. You can merge the bugfix
branch into the release branch and also merge -s ours the same branch into your master branch
(even though the fix is already there) so when you later merge the release branch again, there are
no conflicts from the bugfix.
<p>Subtree Merging
<p>The idea of the subtree merge is that you have two projects, and one of the projects maps to a
subdirectory of the other one. When you specify a subtree merge, Git is often smart enough to
figure out that one is a subtree of the other and merge appropriately.
<p>We&rsquo;ll go through an example of adding a separate project into an existing project and then merging
the code of the second into a subdirectory of the first.
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll add the Rack application to our project. We&rsquo;ll add the Rack project as a remote reference
in our own project and then check it out into its own branch:
<p>$ git remote add rack_remote https://github.com/rack/rack
$ git fetch rack_remote --no-tags
warning: no common commits
remote: Counting objects: 3184, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1465/1465), done.

&nbsp;* [new branch] rack-0.9 -&gt; rack_remote/rack-0.9
$ git checkout -b rack_branch rack_remote/master
Branch rack_branch set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/rack_remote/master.
Switched to a new branch "rack_branch"
<p>Now we have the root of the Rack project in our rack_branch branch and our own project in the
master branch. If you check out one and then the other, you can see that they have different project
roots:
<p>$ ls
AUTHORS KNOWN-ISSUES Rakefile contrib lib
COPYING README bin example test
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch "master"
$ ls
README
<p>289</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>This is sort of a strange concept. Not all the branches in your repository actually have to be
branches of the same project. It&rsquo;s not common, because it&rsquo;s rarely helpful, but it&rsquo;s fairly easy to have
branches contain completely different histories.
<p>In this case, we want to pull the Rack project into our master project as a subdirectory. We can do
that in Git with git read-tree. You&rsquo;ll learn more about read-tree and its friends in Git Internals, but
for now know that it reads the root tree of one branch into your current staging area and working
directory. We just switched back to your master branch, and we pull the rack_branch branch into the
rack subdirectory of our master branch of our main project:
<p>$ git read-tree --prefix=rack/ -u rack_branch
<p>When we commit, it looks like we have all the Rack files under that subdirectory &ndash; as though we
copied them in from a tarball. What gets interesting is that we can fairly easily merge changes from
one of the branches to the other. So, if the Rack project updates, we can pull in upstream changes
by switching to that branch and pulling:
<p>$ git checkout rack_branch
$ git pull
<p>Then, we can merge those changes back into our master branch. To pull in the changes and
prepopulate the commit message, use the --squash option, as well as the recursive merge strategy&rsquo;s
-Xsubtree option. (The recursive strategy is the default here, but we include it for clarity.)
<p>$ git checkout master
$ git merge --squash -s recursive -Xsubtree=rack rack_branch
Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested
<p>All the changes from the Rack project are merged in and ready to be committed locally. You can also
do the opposite &ndash; make changes in the rack subdirectory of your master branch and then merge
them into your rack_branch branch later to submit them to the maintainers or push them upstream.
<p>This gives us a way to have a workflow somewhat similar to the submodule workflow without
using submodules (which we will cover in Submodules). We can keep branches with other related
projects in our repository and subtree merge them into our project occasionally. It is nice in some
ways, for example all the code is committed to a single place. However, it has other drawbacks in
that it&rsquo;s a bit more complex and easier to make mistakes in reintegrating changes or accidentally
pushing a branch into an unrelated repository.
<p>Another slightly weird thing is that to get a diff between what you have in your rack subdirectory
and the code in your rack_branch branch &ndash; to see if you need to merge them &ndash; you can&rsquo;t use the
normal diff command. Instead, you must run git diff-tree with the branch you want to compare
to:
<p>290</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git diff-tree -p rack_branch
<p>Or, to compare what is in your rack subdirectory with what the master branch on the server was the
last time you fetched, you can run
<p>$ git diff-tree -p rack_remote/master
<p>Rerere
The git rerere functionality is a bit of a hidden feature. The name stands for &ldquo;reuse recorded
resolution&rdquo; and, as the name implies, it allows you to ask Git to remember how you&rsquo;ve resolved a
hunk conflict so that the next time it sees the same conflict, Git can resolve it for you automatically.
<p>There are a number of scenarios in which this functionality might be really handy. One of the
examples that is mentioned in the documentation is when you want to make sure a long-lived topic
branch will ultimately merge cleanly, but you don&rsquo;t want to have a bunch of intermediate merge
commits cluttering up your commit history. With rerere enabled, you can attempt the occasional
merge, resolve the conflicts, then back out of the merge. If you do this continuously, then the final
merge should be easy because rerere can just do everything for you automatically.
<p>This same tactic can be used if you want to keep a branch rebased so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with
the same rebasing conflicts each time you do it. Or if you want to take a branch that you merged
and fixed a bunch of conflicts and then decide to rebase it instead&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you likely won&rsquo;t have to do all
the same conflicts again.
<p>Another application of rerere is where you merge a bunch of evolving topic branches together into
a testable head occasionally, as the Git project itself often does. If the tests fail, you can rewind the
merges and re-do them without the topic branch that made the tests fail without having to re-
resolve the conflicts again.
<p>To enable rerere functionality, you simply have to run this config setting:
<p>$ git config --global rerere.enabled true
<p>You can also turn it on by creating the .git/rr-cache directory in a specific repository, but the
config setting is clearer and enables that feature globally for you.
<p>Now let&rsquo;s see a simple example, similar to our previous one. Let&rsquo;s say we have a file named hello.rb
that looks like this:
<p>#! /usr/bin/env ruby
<p>def hello
&nbsp; puts 'hello world'
end
<p>291</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>In one branch we change the word &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to &ldquo;hola&rdquo;, then in another branch we change the &ldquo;world&rdquo;
to &ldquo;mundo&rdquo;, just like before.
<p>When we merge the two branches together, we&rsquo;ll get a merge conflict:
<p>$ git merge i18n-world
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Recorded preimage for 'hello.rb'
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
<p>You should notice the new line Recorded preimage for FILE in there. Otherwise it should look
exactly like a normal merge conflict. At this point, rerere can tell us a few things. Normally, you
might run git status at this point to see what all conflicted:
<p>$ git status
# On branch master
# Unmerged paths:
# (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
# (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to mark resolution)
#
# both modified: hello.rb
#
<p>However, git rerere will also tell you what it has recorded the pre-merge state for with git rerere
status:
<p>$ git rerere status
hello.rb
<p>292</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>And git rerere diff will show the current state of the resolution&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;what you started with to
resolve and what you&rsquo;ve resolved it to.
<p>$ git rerere diff

without a ton of merges, or you rebase often, you can turn on rerere to help your life out a bit.
<p>Debugging with Git
In addition to being primarily for version control, Git also provides a couple commands to help you
debug your source code projects. Because Git is designed to handle nearly any type of content, these
tools are pretty generic, but they can often help you hunt for a bug or culprit when things go wrong.
<p>File Annotation
<p>If you track down a bug in your code and want to know when it was introduced and why, file
annotation is often your best tool. It shows you what commit was the last to modify each line of any
file. So if you see that a method in your code is buggy, you can annotate the file with git blame to
determine which commit was responsible for the introduction of that line.
<p>The following example uses git blame to determine which commit and committer was responsible
for lines in the top-level Linux kernel Makefile and, further, uses the -L option to restrict the output
of the annotation to lines 69 through 82 of that file:
<p>$ git blame -L 69,82 Makefile

<p>Notice that the first field is the partial SHA-1 of the commit that last modified that line. The next two
fields are values extracted from that commit&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the author name and the authored date of that
commit&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;so you can easily see who modified that line and when. After that come the line number
and the content of the file. Also note the ^1da177e4c3f4 commit lines, where the ^ prefix designates
lines that were introduced in the repository&rsquo;s initial commit and have remained unchanged ever
since. This is a tad confusing, because now you&rsquo;ve seen at least three different ways that Git uses
<p>297</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>the ^ to modify a commit SHA-1, but that is what it means here.
<p>Another cool thing about Git is that it doesn&rsquo;t track file renames explicitly. It records the snapshots
and then tries to figure out what was renamed implicitly, after the fact. One of the interesting
features of this is that you can ask it to figure out all sorts of code movement as well. If you pass -C
to git blame, Git analyzes the file you&rsquo;re annotating and tries to figure out where snippets of code
within it originally came from if they were copied from elsewhere. For example, say you are
refactoring a file named GITServerHandler.m into multiple files, one of which is GITPackUpload.m. By
blaming GITPackUpload.m with the -C option, you can see where sections of the code originally came
from:
<p>$ git blame -C -L 141,153 GITPackUpload.m

<p>This is really useful. Normally, you get as the original commit the commit where you copied the
code over, because that is the first time you touched those lines in this file. Git tells you the original
commit where you wrote those lines, even if it was in another file.
<p>Binary Search
<p>Annotating a file helps if you know where the issue is to begin with. If you don&rsquo;t know what is
breaking, and there have been dozens or hundreds of commits since the last state where you know
the code worked, you&rsquo;ll likely turn to git bisect for help. The bisect command does a binary search
through your commit history to help you identify as quickly as possible which commit introduced
an issue.
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you just pushed out a release of your code to a production environment, you&rsquo;re getting bug
reports about something that wasn&rsquo;t happening in your development environment, and you can&rsquo;t
imagine why the code is doing that. You go back to your code, and it turns out you can reproduce
the issue, but you can&rsquo;t figure out what is going wrong. You can bisect the code to find out. First you
run git bisect start to get things going, and then you use git bisect bad to tell the system that the
current commit you&rsquo;re on is broken. Then, you must tell bisect when the last known good state was,
using git bisect good &lt;good_commit&gt;:

<p>Git figured out that about 12 commits came between the commit you marked as the last good

you can run your test to see if the issue exists as of this commit. If it does, then it was introduced
sometime before this middle commit; if it doesn&rsquo;t, then the problem was introduced sometime after
the middle commit. It turns out there is no issue here, and you tell Git that by typing git bisect

<p>This is a powerful tool that can help you check hundreds of commits for an introduced bug in
minutes. In fact, if you have a script that will exit 0 if the project is good or non-0 if the project is
bad, you can fully automate git bisect. First, you again tell it the scope of the bisect by providing
the known bad and good commits. You can do this by listing them with the bisect start command
if you want, listing the known bad commit first and the known good commit second:
<p>$ git bisect start HEAD v1.0
$ git bisect run test-error.sh
<p>Doing so automatically runs test-error.sh on each checked-out commit until Git finds the first
broken commit. You can also run something like make or make tests or whatever you have that runs
automated tests for you.
<p>Submodules
It often happens that while working on one project, you need to use another project from within it.
Perhaps it&rsquo;s a library that a third party developed or that you&rsquo;re developing separately and using in
multiple parent projects. A common issue arises in these scenarios: you want to be able to treat the
two projects as separate yet still be able to use one from within the other.
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. Suppose you&rsquo;re developing a website and creating Atom feeds. Instead of
writing your own Atom-generating code, you decide to use a library. You&rsquo;re likely to have to either
include this code from a shared library like a CPAN install or Ruby gem, or copy the source code
into your own project tree. The issue with including the library is that it&rsquo;s difficult to customize the
library in any way and often more difficult to deploy it, because you need to make sure every client
has that library available. The issue with copying the code into your own project is that any custom
changes you make are difficult to merge when upstream changes become available.
<p>Git addresses this issue using submodules. Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a
subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and
keep your commits separate.
<p>Starting with Submodules
<p>We&rsquo;ll walk through developing a simple project that has been split up into a main project and a few
sub-projects.
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by adding an existing Git repository as a submodule of the repository that we&rsquo;re working
on. To add a new submodule you use the git submodule add command with the absolute or relative
URL of the project you would like to start tracking. In this example, we&rsquo;ll add a library called
&ldquo;DbConnector&rdquo;.
<p>300</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector

remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 0), reused 11 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
<p>By default, submodules will add the subproject into a directory named the same as the repository,
in this case &ldquo;DbConnector&rdquo;. You can add a different path at the end of the command if you want it
to go elsewhere.
<p>If you run git status at this point, you&rsquo;ll notice a few things.
<p>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
<p>Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<p>&nbsp; new file: .gitmodules
&nbsp; new file: DbConnector
<p>First you should notice the new .gitmodules file. This is a configuration file that stores the mapping
between the project&rsquo;s URL and the local subdirectory you&rsquo;ve pulled it into:
<p>[submodule "DbConnector"]
&nbsp; path = DbConnector
&nbsp; url = https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
<p>If you have multiple submodules, you&rsquo;ll have multiple entries in this file. It&rsquo;s important to note that
this file is version-controlled with your other files, like your .gitignore file. It&rsquo;s pushed and pulled
with the rest of your project. This is how other people who clone this project know where to get the
submodule projects from.
<p>
<p>Since the URL in the .gitmodules file is what other people will first try to
clone/fetch from, make sure to use a URL that they can access if possible. For
example, if you use a different URL to push to than others would to pull from, use
the one that others have access to. You can overwrite this value locally with git
config submodule.DbConnector.url PRIVATE_URL for your own use. When applicable,
a relative URL can be helpful.
<p>The other listing in the git status output is the project folder entry. If you run git diff on that, you
see something interesting:

<p>Lastly, push these changes:
<p>$ git push origin master
<p>Cloning a Project with Submodules
<p>Here we&rsquo;ll clone a project with a submodule in it. When you clone such a project, by default you get
the directories that contain submodules, but none of the files within them yet:

<p>The DbConnector directory is there, but empty. You must run two commands: git submodule init to
initialize your local configuration file, and git submodule update to fetch all the data from that
project and check out the appropriate commit listed in your superproject:
<p>$ git submodule init
Submodule 'DbConnector' (https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector) registered for path

$ git submodule update

<p>Now your DbConnector subdirectory is at the exact state it was in when you committed earlier.
<p>There is another way to do this which is a little simpler, however. If you pass --recurse-submodules
to the git clone command, it will automatically initialize and update each submodule in the
repository, including nested submodules if any of the submodules in the repository have
submodules themselves.

<p>If you already cloned the project and forgot --recurse-submodules, you can combine the git
submodule init and git submodule update steps by running git submodule update --init. To also
initialize, fetch and checkout any nested submodules, you can use the foolproof git submodule
update --init --recursive.
<p>Working on a Project with Submodules
<p>Now we have a copy of a project with submodules in it and will collaborate with our teammates on
both the main project and the submodule project.
<p>Pulling in Upstream Changes from the Submodule Remote
<p>The simplest model of using submodules in a project would be if you were simply consuming a
subproject and wanted to get updates from it from time to time but were not actually modifying
anything in your checkout. Let&rsquo;s walk through a simple example there.
<p>If you want to check for new work in a submodule, you can go into the directory and run git fetch
and git merge the upstream branch to update the local code.
<p>$ git fetch
From https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
&nbsp; c3f01dc..d0354fc master -&gt; origin/master
$ git merge origin/master
Updating c3f01dc..d0354fc
Fast-forward
&nbsp;scripts/connect.sh | 1 +
&nbsp;src/db.c | 1 +
&nbsp;2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
<p>Now if you go back into the main project and run git diff --submodule you can see that the
submodule was updated and get a list of commits that were added to it. If you don&rsquo;t want to type
<p>304</p>

<p>--submodule every time you run git diff, you can set it as the default format by setting the
diff.submodule config value to &ldquo;log&rdquo;.
<p>$ git config --global diff.submodule log
$ git diff

&nbsp; &gt; more efficient db routine
&nbsp; &gt; better connection routine
<p>If you commit at this point then you will lock the submodule into having the new code when other
people update.
<p>There is an easier way to do this as well, if you prefer to not manually fetch and merge in the
subdirectory. If you run git submodule update --remote, Git will go into your submodules and fetch
and update for you.
<p>$ git submodule update --remote DbConnector

Submodule path 'DbConnector': checked out 'd0354fc054692d3906c85c3af05ddce39a1c0644'
<p>This command will by default assume that you want to update the checkout to the master branch of
the submodule repository. You can, however, set this to something different if you want. For
example, if you want to have the DbConnector submodule track that repository&rsquo;s &ldquo;stable&rdquo; branch,
you can set it in either your .gitmodules file (so everyone else also tracks it), or just in your local
.git/config file. Let&rsquo;s set it in the .gitmodules file:
<p>$ git config -f .gitmodules submodule.DbConnector.branch stable
<p>$ git submodule update --remote
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

Submodule path 'DbConnector': checked out 'c87d55d4c6d4b05ee34fbc8cb6f7bf4585ae6687'
<p>If you leave off the -f .gitmodules it will only make the change for you, but it probably makes more
sense to track that information with the repository so everyone else does as well.
<p>When we run git status at this point, Git will show us that we have &ldquo;new commits&rdquo; on the
submodule.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
<p>Note that to be on the safe side, you should run git submodule update with the --init flag in case the
MainProject commits you just pulled added new submodules, and with the --recursive flag if any
submodules have nested submodules.
<p>If you want to automate this process, you can add the&nbsp;--recurse-submodules flag to the git pull
command (since Git 2.14). This will make Git run git submodule update right after the pull, putting
the submodules in the correct state. Moreover, if you want to make Git always pull with --recurse
-submodules, you can set the configuration option submodule.recurse to true (this works for git pull
since Git 2.15). This option will make Git use the --recurse-submodules flag for all commands that
support it (except clone).
<p>There is a special situation that can happen when pulling superproject updates: it could be that the
upstream repository has changed the URL of the submodule in the .gitmodules file in one of the
commits you pull. This can happen for example if the submodule project changes its hosting
platform. In that case, it is possible for git pull --recurse-submodules, or git submodule update, to
fail if the superproject references a submodule commit that is not found in the submodule remote
locally configured in your repository. In order to remedy this situation, the git submodule sync
command is required:
<p># copy the new URL to your local config
$ git submodule sync --recursive
# update the submodule from the new URL
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
<p>Working on a Submodule
<p>It&rsquo;s quite likely that if you&rsquo;re using submodules, you&rsquo;re doing so because you really want to work on
the code in the submodule at the same time as you&rsquo;re working on the code in the main project (or
across several submodules). Otherwise you would probably instead be using a simpler dependency
management system (such as Maven or Rubygems).
<p>So now let&rsquo;s go through an example of making changes to the submodule at the same time as the
main project and committing and publishing those changes at the same time.
<p>So far, when we&rsquo;ve run the git submodule update command to fetch changes from the submodule
repositories, Git would get the changes and update the files in the subdirectory but will leave the
sub-repository in what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;detached HEAD&rdquo; state. This means that there is no local working
branch (like master, for example) tracking changes. With no working branch tracking changes, that
<p>309</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>means even if you commit changes to the submodule, those changes will quite possibly be lost the
next time you run git submodule update. You have to do some extra steps if you want changes in a
submodule to be tracked.
<p>In order to set up your submodule to be easier to go in and hack on, you need to do two things. You
need to go into each submodule and check out a branch to work on. Then you need to tell Git what
to do if you have made changes and then git submodule update --remote pulls in new work from
upstream. The options are that you can merge them into your local work, or you can try to rebase
your local work on top of the new changes.
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s go into our submodule directory and check out a branch.
<p>$ cd DbConnector/
$ git checkout stable
Switched to branch 'stable'
<p>Let&rsquo;s try updating our submodule with the &ldquo;merge&rdquo; option. To specify it manually, we can just add
the --merge option to our update call. Here we&rsquo;ll see that there was a change on the server for this
submodule and it gets merged in.
<p>$ cd ..
$ git submodule update --remote --merge

<p>Publishing Submodule Changes
<p>Now we have some changes in our submodule directory. Some of these were brought in from
upstream by our updates and others were made locally and aren&rsquo;t available to anyone else yet as
we haven&rsquo;t pushed them yet.
<p>$ git diff
Submodule DbConnector c87d55d..82d2ad3:
&nbsp; &gt; Merge from origin/stable
&nbsp; &gt; Update setup script
&nbsp; &gt; Unicode support
&nbsp; &gt; Remove unnecessary method
&nbsp; &gt; Add new option for conn pooling
<p>If we commit in the main project and push it up without pushing the submodule changes up as
well, other people who try to check out our changes are going to be in trouble since they will have
no way to get the submodule changes that are depended on. Those changes will only exist on our
local copy.
<p>In order to make sure this doesn&rsquo;t happen, you can ask Git to check that all your submodules have
been pushed properly before pushing the main project. The git push command takes the --recurse
-submodules argument which can be set to either &ldquo;check&rdquo; or &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo;. The &ldquo;check&rdquo; option will
make push simply fail if any of the committed submodule changes haven&rsquo;t been pushed.
<p>$ git push --recurse-submodules=check
The following submodule paths contain changes that can
not be found on any remote:
&nbsp; DbConnector
<p>Please try
<p>&nbsp; git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand
<p>or cd to the path and use
<p>&nbsp; git push
<p>to push them to a remote.
<p>As you can see, it also gives us some helpful advice on what we might want to do next. The simple
option is to go into each submodule and manually push to the remotes to make sure they&rsquo;re
externally available and then try this push again. If you want the check behavior to happen for all
pushes, you can make this behavior the default by doing git config push.recurseSubmodules check.
<p>The other option is to use the &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; value, which will try to do this for you.

<p>As you can see there, Git went into the DbConnector module and pushed it before pushing the main
project. If that submodule push fails for some reason, the main project push will also fail. You can
make this behavior the default by doing git config push.recurseSubmodules on-demand.
<p>Merging Submodule Changes
<p>If you change a submodule reference at the same time as someone else, you may run into some
problems. That is, if the submodule histories have diverged and are committed to diverging
branches in a superproject, it may take a bit of work for you to fix.
<p>If one of the commits is a direct ancestor of the other (a fast-forward merge), then Git will simply
choose the latter for the merge, so that works fine.
<p>Git will not attempt even a trivial merge for you, however. If the submodule commits diverge and
need to be merged, you will get something that looks like this:
<p>$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 2, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 2 (delta 1), reused 2 (delta 1)

Fetching submodule DbConnector
warning: Failed to merge submodule DbConnector (merge following commits not found)
Auto-merging DbConnector
CONFLICT (submodule): Merge conflict in DbConnector
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
<p>So basically what has happened here is that Git has figured out that the two branches record points
in the submodule&rsquo;s history that are divergent and need to be merged. It explains it as &ldquo;merge
<p>313</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>following commits not found&rdquo;, which is confusing but we&rsquo;ll explain why that is in a bit.
<p>To solve the problem, you need to figure out what state the submodule should be in. Strangely, Git
doesn&rsquo;t really give you much information to help out here, not even the SHA-1s of the commits of
both sides of the history. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s simple to figure out. If you run git diff you can get the
SHA-1s of the commits recorded in both branches you were trying to merge.
<p>$ git diff
diff --cc DbConnector
index eb41d76,c771610..0000000
--- a/DbConnector
+++ b/DbConnector
<p>So, in this case, eb41d76 is the commit in our submodule that we had and c771610 is the commit that
upstream had. If we go into our submodule directory, it should already be on eb41d76 as the merge
would not have touched it. If for whatever reason it&rsquo;s not, you can simply create and checkout a
branch pointing to it.
<p>What is important is the SHA-1 of the commit from the other side. This is what you&rsquo;ll have to merge
in and resolve. You can either just try the merge with the SHA-1 directly, or you can create a branch
for it and then try to merge that in. We would suggest the latter, even if only to make a nicer merge
commit message.
<p>So, we will go into our submodule directory, create a branch named &ldquo;try-merge&rdquo; based on that
second SHA-1 from git diff, and manually merge.
<p>$ cd DbConnector
<p>$ git rev-parse HEAD

<p>It can be a bit confusing, but it&rsquo;s really not very hard.
<p>Interestingly, there is another case that Git handles. If a merge commit exists in the submodule
directory that contains both commits in its history, Git will suggest it to you as a possible solution. It
sees that at some point in the submodule project, someone merged branches containing these two
commits, so maybe you&rsquo;ll want that one.
<p>This is why the error message from before was &ldquo;merge following commits not found&rdquo;, because it
could not do this. It&rsquo;s confusing because who would expect it to try to do this?

<p>Submodule Tips
<p>There are a few things you can do to make working with submodules a little easier.
<p>Submodule Foreach
<p>There is a foreach submodule command to run some arbitrary command in each submodule. This
can be really helpful if you have a number of submodules in the same project.
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say we want to start a new feature or do a bugfix and we have work going on in
several submodules. We can easily stash all the work in all our submodules.
<p>316</p>
<br>
</div>

<p>Useful Aliases
<p>You may want to set up some aliases for some of these commands as they can be quite long and you
can&rsquo;t set configuration options for most of them to make them defaults. We covered setting up Git
aliases in Git Aliases, but here is an example of what you may want to set up if you plan on working
with submodules in Git a lot.

<p>Issues with Submodules
<p>Using submodules isn&rsquo;t without hiccups, however.
<p>Switching branches
<p>For instance, switching branches with submodules in them can also be tricky with Git versions
older than Git 2.13. If you create a new branch, add a submodule there, and then switch back to a
branch without that submodule, you still have the submodule directory as an untracked directory:
<p>$ git --version
git version 2.12.2
<p>$ git checkout -b add-crypto
Switched to a new branch 'add-crypto'
<p>$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
Cloning into 'CryptoLibrary'...
...
<p>$ git commit -am 'Add crypto library'
[add-crypto 4445836] Add crypto library
&nbsp;2 files changed, 4 insertions(+)
&nbsp;create mode 160000 CryptoLibrary
<p>$ git checkout master
warning: unable to rmdir CryptoLibrary: Directory not empty
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
<p>$ git status

Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
<p>Untracked files:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
<p>&nbsp; CryptoLibrary/
<p>nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
<p>Removing the directory isn&rsquo;t difficult, but it can be a bit confusing to have that in there. If you do
remove it and then switch back to the branch that has that submodule, you will need to run
submodule update --init to repopulate it.
<p>319</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git clean -ffdx
Removing CryptoLibrary/
<p>$ git checkout add-crypto

<p>$ ls CryptoLibrary/
Makefile includes scripts src
<p>Again, not really very difficult, but it can be a little confusing.
<p>Newer Git versions (Git &gt;= 2.13) simplify all this by adding the --recurse-submodules flag to the git
checkout command, which takes care of placing the submodules in the right state for the branch we
are switching to.
<p>$ git --version

<p>$ git status

<p>nothing to commit, working tree clean
<p>Using the --recurse-submodules flag of git checkout can also be useful when you work on several
branches in the superproject, each having your submodule pointing at different commits. Indeed, if
you switch between branches that record the submodule at different commits, upon executing git
<p>320</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>status the submodule will appear as &ldquo;modified&rdquo;, and indicate &ldquo;new commits&rdquo;. That is because the
submodule state is by default not carried over when switching branches.
<p>This can be really confusing, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to always git checkout --recurse-submodules when
your project has submodules. (For older Git versions that do not have the --recurse-submodules flag,
after the checkout you can use git submodule update --init --recursive to put the submodules in
the right state.)
<p>Luckily, you can tell Git (&gt;=2.14) to always use the --recurse-submodules flag by setting the
configuration option submodule.recurse: git config submodule.recurse true. As noted above, this
will also make Git recurse into submodules for every command that has a --recurse-submodules
option (except git clone).
<p>Switching from subdirectories to submodules
<p>The other main caveat that many people run into involves switching from subdirectories to
submodules. If you&rsquo;ve been tracking files in your project and you want to move them out into a
submodule, you must be careful or Git will get angry at you. Assume that you have files in a
subdirectory of your project, and you want to switch it to a submodule. If you delete the
subdirectory and then run submodule add, Git yells at you:
<p>$ rm -Rf CryptoLibrary/
$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
'CryptoLibrary' already exists in the index
<p>You have to unstage the CryptoLibrary directory first. Then you can add the submodule:
<p>$ git rm -r CryptoLibrary
$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
Cloning into 'CryptoLibrary'...
remote: Counting objects: 11, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 0), reused 11 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
<p>Now suppose you did that in a branch. If you try to switch back to a branch where those files are
still in the actual tree rather than a submodule &ndash; you get this error:
<p>$ git checkout master
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
&nbsp; CryptoLibrary/Makefile
&nbsp; CryptoLibrary/includes/crypto.h
&nbsp; ...
Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.
Aborting
<p>321</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>You can force it to switch with checkout -f, but be careful that you don&rsquo;t have unsaved changes in
there as they could be overwritten with that command.
<p>$ git checkout -f master
warning: unable to rmdir CryptoLibrary: Directory not empty
Switched to branch 'master'
<p>Then, when you switch back, you get an empty CryptoLibrary directory for some reason and git
submodule update may not fix it either. You may need to go into your submodule directory and run a
git checkout . to get all your files back. You could run this in a submodule foreach script to run it for
multiple submodules.
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that submodules these days keep all their Git data in the top project&rsquo;s .git
directory, so unlike much older versions of Git, destroying a submodule directory won&rsquo;t lose any
commits or branches that you had.
<p>With these tools, submodules can be a fairly simple and effective method for developing on several
related but still separate projects simultaneously.
<p>Bundling
Though we&rsquo;ve covered the common ways to transfer Git data over a network (HTTP, SSH, etc), there
is actually one more way to do so that is not commonly used but can actually be quite useful.
<p>Git is capable of &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; its data into a single file. This can be useful in various scenarios. Maybe
your network is down and you want to send changes to your co-workers. Perhaps you&rsquo;re working
somewhere offsite and don&rsquo;t have access to the local network for security reasons. Maybe your
wireless/ethernet card just broke. Maybe you don&rsquo;t have access to a shared server for the moment,
you want to email someone updates and you don&rsquo;t want to transfer 40 commits via format-patch.
<p>This is where the git bundle command can be helpful. The bundle command will package up
everything that would normally be pushed over the wire with a git push command into a binary
file that you can email to someone or put on a flash drive, then unbundle into another repository.
<p>Let&rsquo;s see a simple example. Let&rsquo;s say you have a repository with two commits:

or simply don&rsquo;t want to set one up, you can bundle it with git bundle create.
<p>$ git bundle create repo.bundle HEAD master

Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 441 bytes, done.
Total 6 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
<p>Now you have a file named repo.bundle that has all the data needed to re-create the repository&rsquo;s
master branch. With the bundle command you need to list out every reference or specific range of
commits that you want to be included. If you intend for this to be cloned somewhere else, you
should add HEAD as a reference as well as we&rsquo;ve done here.
<p>You can email this repo.bundle file to someone else, or put it on a USB drive and walk it over.
<p>On the other side, say you are sent this repo.bundle file and want to work on the project. You can
clone from the binary file into a directory, much like you would from a URL.
<p>$ git clone repo.bundle repo
Cloning into 'repo'...
...
$ cd repo
$ git log --oneline
9a466c5 Second commit
b1ec324 First commit
<p>If you don&rsquo;t include HEAD in the references, you have to also specify -b master or whatever branch
is included because otherwise it won&rsquo;t know what branch to check out.
<p>Now let&rsquo;s say you do three commits on it and want to send the new commits back via a bundle on a
USB stick or email.
<p>323</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git log --oneline
71b84da Last commit - second repo
c99cf5b Fourth commit - second repo
7011d3d Third commit - second repo
9a466c5 Second commit
b1ec324 First commit
<p>First we need to determine the range of commits we want to include in the bundle. Unlike the
network protocols which figure out the minimum set of data to transfer over the network for us,
we&rsquo;ll have to figure this out manually. Now, you could just do the same thing and bundle the entire
repository, which will work, but it&rsquo;s better to just bundle up the difference - just the three commits
we just made locally.
<p>In order to do that, you&rsquo;ll have to calculate the difference. As we described in Commit Ranges, you
can specify a range of commits in a number of ways. To get the three commits that we have in our
master branch that weren&rsquo;t in the branch we originally cloned, we can use something like
origin/master..master or master ^origin/master. You can test that with the log command.
<p>$ git log --oneline master ^origin/master
71b84da Last commit - second repo
c99cf5b Fourth commit - second repo
7011d3d Third commit - second repo
<p>So now that we have the list of commits we want to include in the bundle, let&rsquo;s bundle them up. We
do that with the git bundle create command, giving it a filename we want our bundle to be and the
range of commits we want to go into it.
<p>$ git bundle create commits.bundle master ^9a466c5
Counting objects: 11, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 775 bytes, done.
Total 9 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
<p>Now we have a commits.bundle file in our directory. If we take that and send it to our partner, she
can then import it into the original repository, even if more work has been done there in the
meantime.
<p>When she gets the bundle, she can inspect it to see what it contains before she imports it into her
repository. The first command is the bundle verify command that will make sure the file is actually
a valid Git bundle and that you have all the necessary ancestors to reconstitute it properly.
<p>324</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git bundle verify ../commits.bundle
The bundle contains 1 ref
71b84daaf49abed142a373b6e5c59a22dc6560dc refs/heads/master
The bundle requires these 1 ref
9a466c572fe88b195efd356c3f2bbeccdb504102 second commit
../commits.bundle is okay
<p>If the bundler had created a bundle of just the last two commits they had done, rather than all
three, the original repository would not be able to import it, since it is missing requisite history. The
verify command would have looked like this instead:
<p>$ git bundle verify ../commits-bad.bundle
error: Repository lacks these prerequisite commits:
error: 7011d3d8fc200abe0ad561c011c3852a4b7bbe95 Third commit - second repo
<p>However, our first bundle is valid, so we can fetch in commits from it. If you want to see what
branches are in the bundle that can be imported, there is also a command to just list the heads:
<p>$ git bundle list-heads ../commits.bundle
71b84daaf49abed142a373b6e5c59a22dc6560dc refs/heads/master
<p>The verify sub-command will tell you the heads as well. The point is to see what can be pulled in, so
you can use the fetch or pull commands to import commits from this bundle. Here we&rsquo;ll fetch the
master branch of the bundle to a branch named other-master in our repository:
<p>$ git fetch ../commits.bundle master:other-master
From ../commits.bundle
&nbsp;* [new branch] master -&gt; other-master
<p>Now we can see that we have the imported commits on the other-master branch as well as any
commits we&rsquo;ve done in the meantime in our own master branch.
<p>$ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
* 8255d41 (HEAD, master) Third commit - first repo
| * 71b84da (other-master) Last commit - second repo
| * c99cf5b Fourth commit - second repo
| * 7011d3d Third commit - second repo
|/
* 9a466c5 Second commit
* b1ec324 First commit
<p>So, git bundle can be really useful for sharing or doing network-type operations when you don&rsquo;t
have the proper network or shared repository to do so.

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Replace
As we&rsquo;ve emphasized before, the objects in Git&rsquo;s object database are unchangeable, but Git does
provide an interesting way to pretend to replace objects in its database with other objects.
<p>The replace command lets you specify an object in Git and say "every time you refer to this object,
pretend it&rsquo;s a different object". This is most commonly useful for replacing one commit in your
history with another one without having to rebuild the entire history with, say, git filter-branch.
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you have a huge code history and want to split your repository into one short
history for new developers and one much longer and larger history for people interested in data
mining. You can graft one history onto the other by "replacing" the earliest commit in the new line
with the latest commit on the older one. This is nice because it means that you don&rsquo;t actually have
to rewrite every commit in the new history, as you would normally have to do to join them together
(because the parentage affects the SHA-1s).
<p>Let&rsquo;s try this out. Let&rsquo;s take an existing repository, split it into two repositories, one recent and one
historical, and then we&rsquo;ll see how we can recombine them without modifying the recent
repositories SHA-1 values via replace.
<p>We&rsquo;ll use a simple repository with five simple commits:
<p>$ git log --oneline
ef989d8 Fifth commit
c6e1e95 Fourth commit
9c68fdc Third commit
945704c Second commit
c1822cf First commit
<p>We want to break this up into two lines of history. One line goes from commit one to commit four -
that will be the historical one. The second line will just be commits four and five - that will be the
recent history.
<p>326</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Well, creating the historical history is easy, we can just put a branch in the history and then push
that branch to the master branch of a new remote repository.
<p>$ git branch history c6e1e95
$ git log --oneline --decorate
ef989d8 (HEAD, master) Fifth commit
c6e1e95 (history) Fourth commit
9c68fdc Third commit
945704c Second commit
c1822cf First commit
<p>327</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Now we can push the new history branch to the master branch of our new repository:
<p>$ git remote add project-history https://github.com/schacon/project-history
$ git push project-history history:master
Counting objects: 12, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.

Unpacking objects: 100% (12/12), done.
To git@github.com:schacon/project-history.git
&nbsp;* [new branch] history -&gt; master
<p>OK, so our history is published. Now the harder part is truncating our recent history down so it&rsquo;s
<p>328</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>smaller. We need an overlap so we can replace a commit in one with an equivalent commit in the
other, so we&rsquo;re going to truncate this to just commits four and five (so commit four overlaps).
<p>$ git log --oneline --decorate
ef989d8 (HEAD, master) Fifth commit
c6e1e95 (history) Fourth commit
9c68fdc Third commit
945704c Second commit
c1822cf First commit
<p>It&rsquo;s useful in this case to create a base commit that has instructions on how to expand the history, so
other developers know what to do if they hit the first commit in the truncated history and need
more. So, what we&rsquo;re going to do is create an initial commit object as our base point with
instructions, then rebase the remaining commits (four and five) on top of it.
<p>To do that, we need to choose a point to split at, which for us is the third commit, which is 9c68fdc in
SHA-speak. So, our base commit will be based off of that tree. We can create our base commit using
the commit-tree command, which just takes a tree and will give us a brand new, parentless commit
object SHA-1 back.
<p>$ echo 'Get history from blah blah blah' | git commit-tree 9c68fdc^{tree}
622e88e9cbfbacfb75b5279245b9fb38dfea10cf
<p>
<p>The commit-tree command is one of a set of commands that are commonly referred
to as plumbing commands. These are commands that are not generally meant to be
used directly, but instead are used by other Git commands to do smaller jobs. On
occasions when we&rsquo;re doing weirder things like this, they allow us to do really low-
level things but are not meant for daily use. You can read more about plumbing
commands in Plumbing and Porcelain
<p>329</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>OK, so now that we have a base commit, we can rebase the rest of our history on top of that with
git rebase --onto. The --onto argument will be the SHA-1 we just got back from commit-tree and
the rebase point will be the third commit (the parent of the first commit we want to keep, 9c68fdc):
<p>$ git rebase --onto 622e88 9c68fdc
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: fourth commit
Applying: fifth commit
<p>330</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>OK, so now we&rsquo;ve re-written our recent history on top of a throw away base commit that now has
instructions in it on how to reconstitute the entire history if we wanted to. We can push that new
history to a new project and now when people clone that repository, they will only see the most
recent two commits and then a base commit with instructions.
<p>Let&rsquo;s now switch roles to someone cloning the project for the first time who wants the entire
history. To get the history data after cloning this truncated repository, one would have to add a
second remote for the historical repository and fetch:
<p>331</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git clone https://github.com/schacon/project
$ cd project
<p>$ git log --oneline master
e146b5f Fifth commit
81a708d Fourth commit
622e88e Get history from blah blah blah
<p>$ git remote add project-history https://github.com/schacon/project-history
$ git fetch project-history
From https://github.com/schacon/project-history
&nbsp;* [new branch] master -&gt; project-history/master
<p>Now the collaborator would have their recent commits in the master branch and the historical
commits in the project-history/master branch.
<p>$ git log --oneline master
e146b5f Fifth commit
81a708d Fourth commit
622e88e Get history from blah blah blah
<p>$ git log --oneline project-history/master
c6e1e95 Fourth commit
9c68fdc Third commit
945704c Second commit
c1822cf First commit
<p>To combine them, you can simply call git replace with the commit you want to replace and then
the commit you want to replace it with. So we want to replace the "fourth" commit in the master
branch with the "fourth" commit in the project-history/master branch:
<p>$ git replace 81a708d c6e1e95
<p>Now, if you look at the history of the master branch, it appears to look like this:
<p>$ git log --oneline master
e146b5f Fifth commit
81a708d Fourth commit
9c68fdc Third commit
945704c Second commit
c1822cf First commit
<p>Cool, right? Without having to change all the SHA-1s upstream, we were able to replace one commit
in our history with an entirely different commit and all the normal tools (bisect, blame, etc) will
work how we would expect them to.
<p>332</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Interestingly, it still shows 81a708d as the SHA-1, even though it&rsquo;s actually using the c6e1e95 commit
data that we replaced it with. Even if you run a command like cat-file, it will show you the
replaced data:
<p>$ git cat-file -p 81a708d
tree 7bc544cf438903b65ca9104a1e30345eee6c083d
parent 9c68fdceee073230f19ebb8b5e7fc71b479c0252
author Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt; 1268712581 -0700
committer Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt; 1268712581 -0700
<p>fourth commit
<p>Remember that the actual parent of 81a708d was our placeholder commit (622e88e), not 9c68fdce as
it states here.
<p>Another interesting thing is that this data is kept in our references:
<p>333</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git for-each-ref
e146b5f14e79d4935160c0e83fb9ebe526b8da0d commit refs/heads/master
c6e1e95051d41771a649f3145423f8809d1a74d4 commit refs/remotes/history/master

refs/replace/81a708dd0e167a3f691541c7a6463343bc457040
<p>This means that it&rsquo;s easy to share our replacement with others, because we can push this to our
server and other people can easily download it. This is not that helpful in the history grafting
scenario we&rsquo;ve gone over here (since everyone would be downloading both histories anyhow, so
why separate them?) but it can be useful in other circumstances.
<p>Credential Storage
If you use the SSH transport for connecting to remotes, it&rsquo;s possible for you to have a key without a
passphrase, which allows you to securely transfer data without typing in your username and
password. However, this isn&rsquo;t possible with the HTTP protocols &ndash; every connection needs a
username and password. This gets even harder for systems with two-factor authentication, where
the token you use for a password is randomly generated and unpronounceable.
<p>Fortunately, Git has a credentials system that can help with this. Git has a few options provided in
the box:
<p>&bull; The default is not to cache at all. Every connection will prompt you for your username and
password.
<p>&bull; The &ldquo;cache&rdquo; mode keeps credentials in memory for a certain period of time. None of the
passwords are ever stored on disk, and they are purged from the cache after 15 minutes.
<p>&bull; The &ldquo;store&rdquo; mode saves the credentials to a plain-text file on disk, and they never expire. This
means that until you change your password for the Git host, you won&rsquo;t ever have to type in your
credentials again. The downside of this approach is that your passwords are stored in cleartext
in a plain file in your home directory.
<p>&bull; If you&rsquo;re using a Mac, Git comes with an &ldquo;osxkeychain&rdquo; mode, which caches credentials in the
secure keychain that&rsquo;s attached to your system account. This method stores the credentials on
disk, and they never expire, but they&rsquo;re encrypted with the same system that stores HTTPS
certificates and Safari auto-fills.
<p>&bull; If you&rsquo;re using Windows, you can install a helper called &ldquo;Git Credential Manager for Windows.&rdquo;
This is similar to the &ldquo;osxkeychain&rdquo; helper described above, but uses the Windows Credential
Store to control sensitive information. It can be found at https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-
Credential-Manager-for-Windows.
<p>You can choose one of these methods by setting a Git configuration value:
<p>$ git config --global credential.helper cache
<p>334</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows">https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows</a>
</div>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows">https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Some of these helpers have options. The &ldquo;store&rdquo; helper can take a --file &lt;path&gt; argument, which
customizes where the plain-text file is saved (the default is ~/.git-credentials). The &ldquo;cache&rdquo; helper
accepts the --timeout &lt;seconds&gt; option, which changes the amount of time its daemon is kept
running (the default is &ldquo;900&rdquo;, or 15 minutes). Here&rsquo;s an example of how you&rsquo;d configure the &ldquo;store&rdquo;
helper with a custom file name:
<p>$ git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.my-credentials'
<p>Git even allows you to configure several helpers. When looking for credentials for a particular host,
Git will query them in order, and stop after the first answer is provided. When saving credentials,
Git will send the username and password to all of the helpers in the list, and they can choose what
to do with them. Here&rsquo;s what a .gitconfig would look like if you had a credentials file on a thumb
drive, but wanted to use the in-memory cache to save some typing if the drive isn&rsquo;t plugged in:
<p>[credential]
&nbsp; helper = store --file /mnt/thumbdrive/.git-credentials
&nbsp; helper = cache --timeout 30000
<p>Under the Hood
<p>How does this all work? Git&rsquo;s root command for the credential-helper system is git credential,
which takes a command as an argument, and then more input through stdin.
<p>This might be easier to understand with an example. Let&rsquo;s say that a credential helper has been
configured, and the helper has stored credentials for mygithost. Here&rsquo;s a session that uses the &ldquo;fill&rdquo;
command, which is invoked when Git is trying to find credentials for a host:
<p>$ git credential fill ①
protocol=https ②
host=mygithost
③
protocol=https ④
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
$ git credential fill ⑤
protocol=https
host=unknownhost
<p>Username for 'https://unknownhost': bob
Password for 'https://bob@unknownhost':
protocol=https
host=unknownhost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
<p>① This is the command line that initiates the interaction.
<p>335</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>② Git-credential is then waiting for input on stdin. We provide it with the things we know: the
protocol and hostname.
<p>③ A blank line indicates that the input is complete, and the credential system should answer with
what it knows.
<p>④ Git-credential then takes over, and writes to stdout with the bits of information it found.
<p>⑤ If credentials are not found, Git asks the user for the username and password, and provides
them back to the invoking stdout (here they&rsquo;re attached to the same console).
<p>The credential system is actually invoking a program that&rsquo;s separate from Git itself; which one and
how depends on the credential.helper configuration value. There are several forms it can take:
<p>Configuration Value Behavior
<p>foo Runs git-credential-foo
<p>foo -a --opt=bcd Runs git-credential-foo -a --opt=bcd
<p>/absolute/path/foo -xyz Runs /absolute/path/foo -xyz
<p>!f() { echo "password=s3cre7"; }; f Code after ! evaluated in shell
<p>So the helpers described above are actually named git-credential-cache, git-credential-store, and
so on, and we can configure them to take command-line arguments. The general form for this is
&ldquo;git-credential-foo [args] &lt;action&gt;.&rdquo; The stdin/stdout protocol is the same as git-credential, but they
use a slightly different set of actions:
<p>&bull; get is a request for a username/password pair.
<p>&bull; store is a request to save a set of credentials in this helper&rsquo;s memory.
<p>&bull; erase purge the credentials for the given properties from this helper&rsquo;s memory.
<p>For the store and erase actions, no response is required (Git ignores it anyway). For the get action,
however, Git is very interested in what the helper has to say. If the helper doesn&rsquo;t know anything
useful, it can simply exit with no output, but if it does know, it should augment the provided
information with the information it has stored. The output is treated like a series of assignment
statements; anything provided will replace what Git already knows.
<p>Here&rsquo;s the same example from above, but skipping git-credential and going straight for git-
credential-store:
<p>336</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git credential-store --file ~/git.store store ①
protocol=https
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
$ git credential-store --file ~/git.store get ②
protocol=https
host=mygithost
<p>username=bob ③
password=s3cre7
<p>① Here we tell git-credential-store to save some credentials: the username &ldquo;bob&rdquo; and the
password &ldquo;s3cre7&rdquo; are to be used when https://mygithost is accessed.
<p>② Now we&rsquo;ll retrieve those credentials. We provide the parts of the connection we already know
(https://mygithost), and an empty line.
<p>③ git-credential-store replies with the username and password we stored above.
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the ~/git.store file looks like:
<p>https://bob:s3cre7@mygithost
<p>It&rsquo;s just a series of lines, each of which contains a credential-decorated URL. The osxkeychain and
wincred helpers use the native format of their backing stores, while cache uses its own in-memory
format (which no other process can read).
<p>A Custom Credential Cache
<p>Given that git-credential-store and friends are separate programs from Git, it&rsquo;s not much of a leap
to realize that any program can be a Git credential helper. The helpers provided by Git cover many
common use cases, but not all. For example, let&rsquo;s say your team has some credentials that are
shared with the entire team, perhaps for deployment. These are stored in a shared directory, but
you don&rsquo;t want to copy them to your own credential store, because they change often. None of the
existing helpers cover this case; let&rsquo;s see what it would take to write our own. There are several key
features this program needs to have:
<p>1. The only action we need to pay attention to is get; store and erase are write operations, so we&rsquo;ll
just exit cleanly when they&rsquo;re received.
<p>2. The file format of the shared-credential file is the same as that used by git-credential-store.
<p>3. The location of that file is fairly standard, but we should allow the user to pass a custom path
just in case.
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;ll write this extension in Ruby, but any language will work so long as Git can
execute the finished product. Here&rsquo;s the full source code of our new credential helper:
<p>337</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
<p>require 'optparse'
<p>path = File.expand_path '~/.git-credentials' ①
OptionParser.new do |opts|
&nbsp; opts.banner = 'USAGE: git-credential-read-only [options] &lt;action&gt;'
&nbsp; opts.on('-f', '--file PATH', 'Specify path for backing store') do |argpath|
&nbsp; path = File.expand_path argpath
&nbsp; end
end.parse!
<p>exit(0) unless ARGV[0].downcase == 'get' ②
exit(0) unless File.exists? path
<p>known = {} ③
while line = STDIN.gets
&nbsp; break if line.strip == ''
&nbsp; k,v = line.strip.split '=', 2
&nbsp; known[k] = v
end
<p>File.readlines(path).each do |fileline| ④
&nbsp; prot,user,pass,host = fileline.scan(/^(.*?):\/\/(.*?):(.*?)@(.*)$/).first
&nbsp; if prot == known['protocol'] and host == known['host'] and user ==
known['username'] then
&nbsp; puts "protocol=#{prot}"
&nbsp; puts "host=#{host}"
&nbsp; puts "username=#{user}"
&nbsp; puts "password=#{pass}"
&nbsp; exit(0)
&nbsp; end
end
<p>① Here we parse the command-line options, allowing the user to specify the input file. The default
is ~/.git-credentials.
<p>② This program only responds if the action is get and the backing-store file exists.
<p>③ This loop reads from stdin until the first blank line is reached. The inputs are stored in the known
hash for later reference.
<p>④ This loop reads the contents of the storage file, looking for matches. If the protocol and host
from known match this line, the program prints the results to stdout and exits.
<p>We&rsquo;ll save our helper as git-credential-read-only, put it somewhere in our PATH and mark it
executable. Here&rsquo;s what an interactive session looks like:
<p>338</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git credential-read-only --file=/mnt/shared/creds get
protocol=https
host=mygithost
<p>protocol=https
host=mygithost
username=bob

<p>Since its name starts with &ldquo;git-&rdquo;, we can use the simple syntax for the configuration value:
<p>$ git config --global credential.helper 'read-only --file /mnt/shared/creds'
<p>As you can see, extending this system is pretty straightforward, and can solve some common
problems for you and your team.
<p>Summary
You&rsquo;ve seen a number of advanced tools that allow you to manipulate your commits and staging
area more precisely. When you notice issues, you should be able to easily figure out what commit
introduced them, when, and by whom. If you want to use subprojects in your project, you&rsquo;ve
learned how to accommodate those needs. At this point, you should be able to do most of the things
in Git that you&rsquo;ll need on the command line day to day and feel comfortable doing so.

<p>Customizing Git
So far, we&rsquo;ve covered the basics of how Git works and how to use it, and we&rsquo;ve introduced a
number of tools that Git provides to help you use it easily and efficiently. In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll see
how you can make Git operate in a more customized fashion, by introducing several important
configuration settings and the hooks system. With these tools, it&rsquo;s easy to get Git to work exactly the
way you, your company, or your group needs it to.
<p>Git Configuration
As you read briefly in Getting Started, you can specify Git configuration settings with the git config
command. One of the first things you did was set up your name and email address:
<p>$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll learn a few of the more interesting options that you can set in this manner to customize
your Git usage.
<p>First, a quick review: Git uses a series of configuration files to determine non-default behavior that
you may want. The first place Git looks for these values is in the system-wide /etc/gitconfig file,
which contains settings that are applied to every user on the system and all of their repositories. If
you pass the option --system to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically.
<p>The next place Git looks is the ~/.gitconfig (or ~/.config/git/config) file, which is specific to each
user. You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the --global option.
<p>Finally, Git looks for configuration values in the configuration file in the Git directory (.git/config)
of whatever repository you&rsquo;re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository,
and represent passing the --local option to git config. (If you don&rsquo;t specify which level you want to
work with, this is the default.)
<p>Each of these &ldquo;levels&rdquo; (system, global, local) overwrites values in the previous level, so values in
.git/config trump those in /etc/gitconfig, for instance.
<p>
Git&rsquo;s configuration files are plain-text, so you can also set these values by manually
editing the file and inserting the correct syntax. It&rsquo;s generally easier to run the git
config command, though.
<p>Basic Client Configuration
<p>The configuration options recognized by Git fall into two categories: client-side and server-side. The
majority of the options are client-side&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;configuring your personal working preferences. Many,
many configuration options are supported, but a large fraction of them are useful only in certain
edge cases; we&rsquo;ll cover just the most common and useful options here. If you want to see a list of all
the options your version of Git recognizes, you can run
<p>340</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ man git-config
<p>This command lists all the available options in quite a bit of detail. You can also find this reference
material at https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config.
<p>core.editor
<p>By default, Git uses whatever you&rsquo;ve set as your default text editor via one of the shell environment
variables VISUAL or EDITOR, or else falls back to the vi editor to create and edit your commit and tag
messages. To change that default to something else, you can use the core.editor setting:
<p>$ git config --global core.editor emacs
<p>Now, no matter what is set as your default shell editor, Git will fire up Emacs to edit messages.
<p>commit.template
<p>If you set this to the path of a file on your system, Git will use that file as the default initial message
when you commit. The value in creating a custom commit template is that you can use it to remind
yourself (or others) of the proper format and style when creating a commit message.
<p>For instance, consider a template file at ~/.gitmessage.txt that looks like this:
<p>Subject line (try to keep under 50 characters)
<p>Multi-line description of commit,
feel free to be detailed.
<p>[Ticket: X]
<p>Note how this commit template reminds the committer to keep the subject line short (for the sake of
git log --oneline output), to add further detail under that, and to refer to an issue or bug tracker
ticket number if one exists.
<p>To tell Git to use it as the default message that appears in your editor when you run git commit, set
the commit.template configuration value:
<p>$ git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage.txt
$ git commit
<p>Then, your editor will open to something like this for your placeholder commit message when you
commit:
<p>341</p>

".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG" 14L, 297C
<p>If your team has a commit-message policy, then putting a template for that policy on your system
and configuring Git to use it by default can help increase the chance of that policy being followed
regularly.
<p>core.pager
<p>This setting determines which pager is used when Git pages output such as log and diff. You can set
it to more or to your favorite pager (by default, it&rsquo;s less), or you can turn it off by setting it to a blank
string:
<p>$ git config --global core.pager ''
<p>If you run that, Git will page the entire output of all commands, no matter how long they are.
<p>user.signingkey
<p>If you&rsquo;re making signed annotated tags (as discussed in Signing Your Work), setting your GPG
signing key as a configuration setting makes things easier. Set your key ID like so:
<p>$ git config --global user.signingkey &lt;gpg-key-id&gt;
<p>Now, you can sign tags without having to specify your key every time with the git tag command:
<p>$ git tag -s &lt;tag-name&gt;
<p>core.excludesfile
<p>You can put patterns in your project&rsquo;s .gitignore file to have Git not see them as untracked files or
<p>342</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>try to stage them when you run git add on them, as discussed in Ignoring Files.
<p>But sometimes you want to ignore certain files for all repositories that you work with. If your
computer is running macOS, you&rsquo;re probably familiar with .DS_Store files. If your preferred editor
is Emacs or Vim, you know about filenames that end with a ~ or .swp.
<p>This setting lets you write a kind of global .gitignore file. If you create a ~/.gitignore_global file
with these contents:
<p>*~
.*.swp
.DS_Store
<p>&hellip;and you run git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global, Git will never again
bother you about those files.
<p>help.autocorrect
<p>If you mistype a command, it shows you something like this:
<p>$ git chekcout master
git: 'chekcout' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
<p>Did you mean this?
&nbsp; checkout
<p>Git helpfully tries to figure out what you meant, but it still refuses to do it. If you set
help.autocorrect to 1, Git will actually run this command for you:
<p>$ git chekcout master
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'chekcout', which does not exist.
Continuing under the assumption that you meant 'checkout'
in 0.1 seconds automatically...
<p>Note that &ldquo;0.1 seconds&rdquo; business. help.autocorrect is actually an integer which represents tenths of
a second. So if you set it to 50, Git will give you 5 seconds to change your mind before executing the
autocorrected command.
<p>Colors in Git
<p>Git fully supports colored terminal output, which greatly aids in visually parsing command output
quickly and easily. A number of options can help you set the coloring to your preference.
<p>color.ui
<p>Git automatically colors most of its output, but there&rsquo;s a master switch if you don&rsquo;t like this
behavior. To turn off all Git&rsquo;s colored terminal output, do this:
<p>343</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git config --global color.ui false
<p>The default setting is auto, which colors output when it&rsquo;s going straight to a terminal, but omits the
color-control codes when the output is redirected to a pipe or a file.
<p>You can also set it to always to ignore the difference between terminals and pipes. You&rsquo;ll rarely want
this; in most scenarios, if you want color codes in your redirected output, you can instead pass a
--color flag to the Git command to force it to use color codes. The default setting is almost always
what you&rsquo;ll want.
<p>color.*
<p>If you want to be more specific about which commands are colored and how, Git provides verb-
specific coloring settings. Each of these can be set to true, false, or always:
<p>color.branch
color.diff
color.interactive
color.status
<p>In addition, each of these has subsettings you can use to set specific colors for parts of the output, if
you want to override each color. For example, to set the meta information in your diff output to
blue foreground, black background, and bold text, you can run
<p>$ git config --global color.diff.meta "blue black bold"
<p>You can set the color to any of the following values: normal, black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,
cyan, or white. If you want an attribute like bold in the previous example, you can choose from bold,
dim, ul (underline), blink, and reverse (swap foreground and background).
<p>External Merge and Diff Tools
<p>Although Git has an internal implementation of diff, which is what we&rsquo;ve been showing in this
book, you can set up an external tool instead. You can also set up a graphical merge-conflict-
resolution tool instead of having to resolve conflicts manually. We&rsquo;ll demonstrate setting up the
Perforce Visual Merge Tool (P4Merge) to do your diffs and merge resolutions, because it&rsquo;s a nice
graphical tool and it&rsquo;s free.
<p>If you want to try this out, P4Merge works on all major platforms, so you should be able to do so.
We&rsquo;ll use path names in the examples that work on macOS and Linux systems; for Windows, you&rsquo;ll
have to change /usr/local/bin to an executable path in your environment.
<p>To begin, download P4Merge from Perforce. Next, you&rsquo;ll set up external wrapper scripts to run your
commands. We&rsquo;ll use the macOS path for the executable; in other systems, it will be where your
p4merge binary is installed. Set up a merge wrapper script named extMerge that calls your binary
with all the arguments provided:
<p>344</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools">https://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ cat /usr/local/bin/extMerge
#!/bin/sh
/Applications/p4merge.app/Contents/MacOS/p4merge $*
<p>The diff wrapper checks to make sure seven arguments are provided and passes two of them to
your merge script. By default, Git passes the following arguments to the diff program:
<p>path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode
<p>Because you only want the old-file and new-file arguments, you use the wrapper script to pass the
ones you need.
<p>$ cat /usr/local/bin/extDiff
#!/bin/sh
[ $# -eq 7 ] &amp;&amp; /usr/local/bin/extMerge "$2" "$5"
<p>You also need to make sure these tools are executable:
<p>$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/extMerge
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/extDiff
<p>Now you can set up your config file to use your custom merge resolution and diff tools. This takes a
number of custom settings: merge.tool to tell Git what strategy to use, mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd to
specify how to run the command, mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.trustExitCode to tell Git if the exit code of that
program indicates a successful merge resolution or not, and diff.external to tell Git what
command to run for diffs. So, you can either run four config commands
<p>$ git config --global merge.tool extMerge
$ git config --global mergetool.extMerge.cmd \
&nbsp; 'extMerge "$BASE" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" "$MERGED"'
$ git config --global mergetool.extMerge.trustExitCode false
$ git config --global diff.external extDiff
<p>or you can edit your ~/.gitconfig file to add these lines:
<p>[merge]
&nbsp; tool = extMerge
[mergetool "extMerge"]
&nbsp; cmd = extMerge "$BASE" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" "$MERGED"
&nbsp; trustExitCode = false
[diff]
&nbsp; external = extDiff
<p>345</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>After all this is set, if you run diff commands such as this:
<p>$ git diff 32d1776b1^ 32d1776b1
<p>Instead of getting the diff output on the command line, Git fires up P4Merge, which looks something
like this:
<p>Figure 143. P4Merge.
<p>If you try to merge two branches and subsequently have merge conflicts, you can run the command
git mergetool; it starts P4Merge to let you resolve the conflicts through that GUI tool.
<p>The nice thing about this wrapper setup is that you can change your diff and merge tools easily. For
example, to change your extDiff and extMerge tools to run the KDiff3 tool instead, all you have to do
is edit your extMerge file:
<p>$ cat /usr/local/bin/extMerge
#!/bin/sh
/Applications/kdiff3.app/Contents/MacOS/kdiff3 $*
<p>Now, Git will use the KDiff3 tool for diff viewing and merge conflict resolution.
<p>Git comes preset to use a number of other merge-resolution tools without your having to set up the
cmd configuration. To see a list of the tools it supports, try this:
<p>346</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git mergetool --tool-help
'git mergetool --tool=&lt;tool&gt;' may be set to one of the following:
&nbsp; emerge
&nbsp; gvimdiff
&nbsp; gvimdiff2
&nbsp; opendiff
&nbsp; p4merge
&nbsp; vimdiff
&nbsp; vimdiff2
<p>The following tools are valid, but not currently available:
&nbsp; araxis
&nbsp; bc3
&nbsp; codecompare
&nbsp; deltawalker
&nbsp; diffmerge
&nbsp; diffuse
&nbsp; ecmerge
&nbsp; kdiff3
&nbsp; meld
&nbsp; tkdiff
&nbsp; tortoisemerge
&nbsp; xxdiff
<p>Some of the tools listed above only work in a windowed
environment. If run in a terminal-only session, they will fail.
<p>If you&rsquo;re not interested in using KDiff3 for diff but rather want to use it just for merge resolution,
and the kdiff3 command is in your path, then you can run
<p>$ git config --global merge.tool kdiff3
<p>If you run this instead of setting up the extMerge and extDiff files, Git will use KDiff3 for merge
resolution and the normal Git diff tool for diffs.
<p>Formatting and Whitespace
<p>Formatting and whitespace issues are some of the more frustrating and subtle problems that many
developers encounter when collaborating, especially cross-platform. It&rsquo;s very easy for patches or
other collaborated work to introduce subtle whitespace changes because editors silently introduce
them, and if your files ever touch a Windows system, their line endings might be replaced. Git has a
few configuration options to help with these issues.
<p>core.autocrlf
<p>If you&rsquo;re programming on Windows and working with people who are not (or vice-versa), you&rsquo;ll
probably run into line-ending issues at some point. This is because Windows uses both a carriage-
return character and a linefeed character for newlines in its files, whereas macOS and Linux
<p>347</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>systems use only the linefeed character. This is a subtle but incredibly annoying fact of cross-
platform work; many editors on Windows silently replace existing LF-style line endings with CRLF,
or insert both line-ending characters when the user hits the enter key.
<p>Git can handle this by auto-converting CRLF line endings into LF when you add a file to the index,
and vice versa when it checks out code onto your filesystem. You can turn on this functionality with
the core.autocrlf setting. If you&rsquo;re on a Windows machine, set it to true&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this converts LF endings
into CRLF when you check out code:
<p>$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
<p>If you&rsquo;re on a Linux or macOS system that uses LF line endings, then you don&rsquo;t want Git to
automatically convert them when you check out files; however, if a file with CRLF endings
accidentally gets introduced, then you may want Git to fix it. You can tell Git to convert CRLF to LF
on commit but not the other way around by setting core.autocrlf to input:
<p>$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
<p>This setup should leave you with CRLF endings in Windows checkouts, but LF endings on macOS
and Linux systems and in the repository.
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Windows programmer doing a Windows-only project, then you can turn off this
functionality, recording the carriage returns in the repository by setting the config value to false:
<p>$ git config --global core.autocrlf false
<p>core.whitespace
<p>Git comes preset to detect and fix some whitespace issues. It can look for six primary whitespace
issues&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;three are enabled by default and can be turned off, and three are disabled by default but
can be activated.
<p>The three that are turned on by default are blank-at-eol, which looks for spaces at the end of a line;
blank-at-eof, which notices blank lines at the end of a file; and space-before-tab, which looks for
spaces before tabs at the beginning of a line.
<p>The three that are disabled by default but can be turned on are indent-with-non-tab, which looks
for lines that begin with spaces instead of tabs (and is controlled by the tabwidth option); tab-in-
indent, which watches for tabs in the indentation portion of a line; and cr-at-eol, which tells Git
that carriage returns at the end of lines are OK.
<p>You can tell Git which of these you want enabled by setting core.whitespace to the values you want
on or off, separated by commas. You can disable an option by prepending a - in front of its name, or
use the default value by leaving it out of the setting string entirely. For example, if you want all but
space-before-tab to be set, you can do this (with trailing-space being a short-hand to cover both
blank-at-eol and blank-at-eof):
<p>348</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git config --global core.whitespace \
&nbsp; trailing-space,-space-before-tab,indent-with-non-tab,tab-in-indent,cr-at-eol
<p>Or you can specify the customizing part only:
<p>$ git config --global core.whitespace \
&nbsp; -space-before-tab,indent-with-non-tab,tab-in-indent,cr-at-eol
<p>Git will detect these issues when you run a git diff command and try to color them so you can
possibly fix them before you commit. It will also use these values to help you when you apply
patches with git apply. When you&rsquo;re applying patches, you can ask Git to warn you if it&rsquo;s applying
patches with the specified whitespace issues:
<p>$ git apply --whitespace=warn &lt;patch&gt;
<p>Or you can have Git try to automatically fix the issue before applying the patch:
<p>$ git apply --whitespace=fix &lt;patch&gt;
<p>These options apply to the git rebase command as well. If you&rsquo;ve committed whitespace issues but
haven&rsquo;t yet pushed upstream, you can run git rebase --whitespace=fix to have Git automatically
fix whitespace issues as it&rsquo;s rewriting the patches.
<p>Server Configuration
<p>Not nearly as many configuration options are available for the server side of Git, but there are a
few interesting ones you may want to take note of.
<p>receive.fsckObjects
<p>Git is capable of making sure every object received during a push still matches its SHA-1 checksum
and points to valid objects. However, it doesn&rsquo;t do this by default; it&rsquo;s a fairly expensive operation,
and might slow down the operation, especially on large repositories or pushes. If you want Git to
check object consistency on every push, you can force it to do so by setting receive.fsckObjects to
true:
<p>$ git config --system receive.fsckObjects true
<p>Now, Git will check the integrity of your repository before each push is accepted to make sure faulty
(or malicious) clients aren&rsquo;t introducing corrupt data.
<p>receive.denyNonFastForwards
<p>If you rebase commits that you&rsquo;ve already pushed and then try to push again, or otherwise try to
push a commit to a remote branch that doesn&rsquo;t contain the commit that the remote branch
<p>349</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>currently points to, you&rsquo;ll be denied. This is generally good policy; but in the case of the rebase, you
may determine that you know what you&rsquo;re doing and can force-update the remote branch with a -f
flag to your push command.
<p>To tell Git to refuse force-pushes, set receive.denyNonFastForwards:
<p>$ git config --system receive.denyNonFastForwards true
<p>The other way you can do this is via server-side receive hooks, which we&rsquo;ll cover in a bit. That
approach lets you do more complex things like deny non-fast-forwards to a certain subset of users.
<p>receive.denyDeletes
<p>One of the workarounds to the denyNonFastForwards policy is for the user to delete the branch and
then push it back up with the new reference. To avoid this, set receive.denyDeletes to true:
<p>$ git config --system receive.denyDeletes true
<p>This denies any deletion of branches or tags&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;no user can do it. To remove remote branches, you
must remove the ref files from the server manually. There are also more interesting ways to do this
on a per-user basis via ACLs, as you&rsquo;ll learn in An Example Git-Enforced Policy.
<p>Git Attributes
Some of these settings can also be specified for a path, so that Git applies those settings only for a
subdirectory or subset of files. These path-specific settings are called Git attributes and are set
either in a .gitattributes file in one of your directories (normally the root of your project) or in the
.git/info/attributes file if you don&rsquo;t want the attributes file committed with your project.
<p>Using attributes, you can do things like specify separate merge strategies for individual files or
directories in your project, tell Git how to diff non-text files, or have Git filter content before you
check it into or out of Git. In this section, you&rsquo;ll learn about some of the attributes you can set on
your paths in your Git project and see a few examples of using this feature in practice.
<p>Binary Files
<p>One cool trick for which you can use Git attributes is telling Git which files are binary (in cases it
otherwise may not be able to figure out) and giving Git special instructions about how to handle
those files. For instance, some text files may be machine generated and not diffable, whereas some
binary files can be diffed. You&rsquo;ll see how to tell Git which is which.
<p>Identifying Binary Files
<p>Some files look like text files but for all intents and purposes are to be treated as binary data. For
instance, Xcode projects on macOS contain a file that ends in .pbxproj, which is basically a JSON
(plain-text JavaScript data format) dataset written out to disk by the IDE, which records your build
settings and so on. Although it&rsquo;s technically a text file (because it&rsquo;s all UTF-8), you don&rsquo;t want to treat
<p>350</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>it as such because it&rsquo;s really a lightweight database &ndash; you can&rsquo;t merge the contents if two people
change it, and diffs generally aren&rsquo;t helpful. The file is meant to be consumed by a machine. In
essence, you want to treat it like a binary file.
<p>To tell Git to treat all pbxproj files as binary data, add the following line to your .gitattributes file:
<p>*.pbxproj binary
<p>Now, Git won&rsquo;t try to convert or fix CRLF issues; nor will it try to compute or print a diff for changes
in this file when you run git show or git diff on your project.
<p>Diffing Binary Files
<p>You can also use the Git attributes functionality to effectively diff binary files. You do this by telling
Git how to convert your binary data to a text format that can be compared via the normal diff.
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll use this technique to solve one of the most annoying problems known to humanity:
version-controlling Microsoft Word documents. Everyone knows that Word is the most horrific
editor around, but oddly, everyone still uses it. If you want to version-control Word documents, you
can stick them in a Git repository and commit every once in a while; but what good does that do? If
you run git diff normally, you only see something like this:
<p>$ git diff
diff --git a/chapter1.docx b/chapter1.docx
index 88839c4..4afcb7c 100644
Binary files a/chapter1.docx and b/chapter1.docx differ
<p>You can&rsquo;t directly compare two versions unless you check them out and scan them manually, right?
It turns out you can do this fairly well using Git attributes. Put the following line in your
.gitattributes file:
<p>*.docx diff=word
<p>This tells Git that any file that matches this pattern (.docx) should use the &ldquo;word&rdquo; filter when you
try to view a diff that contains changes. What is the &ldquo;word&rdquo; filter? You have to set it up. Here you&rsquo;ll
configure Git to use the docx2txt program to convert Word documents into readable text files,
which it will then diff properly.
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to install docx2txt; you can download it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/
docx2txt. Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file to put it somewhere your shell can find it. Next,
you&rsquo;ll write a wrapper script to convert output to the format Git expects. Create a file that&rsquo;s
somewhere in your path called docx2txt, and add these contents:
<p>#!/bin/bash
docx2txt.pl "$1" -
<p>351</p>
<br>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt">https://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt</a>
</div>
<div class="annotation">
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt">https://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to chmod a+x that file. Finally, you can configure Git to use this script:
<p>$ git config diff.word.textconv docx2txt
<p>Now Git knows that if it tries to do a diff between two snapshots, and any of the files end in .docx, it
should run those files through the &ldquo;word&rdquo; filter, which is defined as the docx2txt program. This
effectively makes nice text-based versions of your Word files before attempting to diff them.
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example: Chapter 1 of this book was converted to Word format and committed in a Git
repository. Then a new paragraph was added. Here&rsquo;s what git diff shows:
<p>$ git diff
diff --git a/chapter1.docx b/chapter1.docx
index 0b013ca..ba25db5 100644

&nbsp;This chapter will be about getting started with Git. We will begin at the beginning
by explaining some background on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git
running on your system and finally how to get it setup to start working with. At the
end of this chapter you should understand why Git is around, why you should use it and
you should be all setup to do so.
&nbsp;1.1. About Version Control
&nbsp;What is "version control", and why should you care? Version control is a system that
records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific
versions later. For the examples in this book you will use software source code as the
files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type
of file on a computer.
+Testing: 1, 2, 3.
&nbsp;If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or
layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a
very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert
the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last
modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when,
and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files,
you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.
&nbsp;1.1.1. Local Version Control Systems
&nbsp;Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another
directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they're clever). This approach is very
common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to
forget which directory you're in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over
files you don't mean to.
<p>Git successfully and succinctly tells us that we added the string &ldquo;Testing: 1, 2, 3.&rdquo;, which is correct.
It&rsquo;s not perfect &ndash; formatting changes wouldn&rsquo;t show up here &ndash; but it certainly works.
<p>Another interesting problem you can solve this way involves diffing image files. One way to do this
is to run image files through a filter that extracts their EXIF information &ndash; metadata that is recorded
<p>352</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>with most image formats. If you download and install the exiftool program, you can use it to
convert your images into text about the metadata, so at least the diff will show you a textual
representation of any changes that happened. Put the following line in your .gitattributes file:
<p>*.png diff=exif
<p>Configure Git to use this tool:
<p>$ git config diff.exif.textconv exiftool
<p>If you replace an image in your project and run git diff, you see something like this:
<p>diff --git a/image.png b/image.png
index 88839c4..4afcb7c 100644

<p>Keyword Expansion
<p>SVN- or CVS-style keyword expansion is often requested by developers used to those systems. The
main problem with this in Git is that you can&rsquo;t modify a file with information about the commit
after you&rsquo;ve committed, because Git checksums the file first. However, you can inject text into a file
when it&rsquo;s checked out and remove it again before it&rsquo;s added to a commit. Git attributes offers you
two ways to do this.
<p>First, you can inject the SHA-1 checksum of a blob into an $Id$ field in the file automatically. If you
set this attribute on a file or set of files, then the next time you check out that branch, Git will
replace that field with the SHA-1 of the blob. It&rsquo;s important to notice that it isn&rsquo;t the SHA-1 of the
commit, but of the blob itself. Put the following line in your .gitattributes file:
<p>353</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>*.txt ident
<p>Add an $Id$ reference to a test file:
<p>$ echo '$Id$' &gt; test.txt
<p>The next time you check out this file, Git injects the SHA-1 of the blob:
<p>$ rm test.txt
$ git checkout -- test.txt
$ cat test.txt
$Id: 42812b7653c7b88933f8a9d6cad0ca16714b9bb3 $
<p>However, that result is of limited use. If you&rsquo;ve used keyword substitution in CVS or Subversion,
you can include a datestamp &ndash; the SHA-1 isn&rsquo;t all that helpful, because it&rsquo;s fairly random and you
can&rsquo;t tell if one SHA-1 is older or newer than another just by looking at them.
<p>It turns out that you can write your own filters for doing substitutions in files on commit/checkout.
These are called &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and &ldquo;smudge&rdquo; filters. In the .gitattributes file, you can set a filter for
particular paths and then set up scripts that will process files just before they&rsquo;re checked out
(&ldquo;smudge&rdquo;, see The &ldquo;smudge&rdquo; filter is run on checkout.) and just before they&rsquo;re staged (&ldquo;clean&rdquo;, see
The &ldquo;clean&rdquo; filter is run when files are staged.). These filters can be set to do all sorts of fun things.
<p>Figure 144. The &ldquo;smudge&rdquo; filter is run on checkout.
<p>354</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Figure 145. The &ldquo;clean&rdquo; filter is run when files are staged.
<p>The original commit message for this feature gives a simple example of running all your C source
code through the indent program before committing. You can set it up by setting the filter attribute
in your .gitattributes file to filter *.c files with the &ldquo;indent&rdquo; filter:
<p>*.c filter=indent
<p>Then, tell Git what the &ldquo;indent&rdquo; filter does on smudge and clean:
<p>$ git config --global filter.indent.clean indent
$ git config --global filter.indent.smudge cat
<p>In this case, when you commit files that match *.c, Git will run them through the indent program
before it stages them and then run them through the cat program before it checks them back out
onto disk. The cat program does essentially nothing: it spits out the same data that it comes in. This
combination effectively filters all C source code files through indent before committing.
<p>Another interesting example gets $Date$ keyword expansion, RCS style. To do this properly, you
need a small script that takes a filename, figures out the last commit date for this project, and
inserts the date into the file. Here is a small Ruby script that does that:
<p>#! /usr/bin/env ruby
data = STDIN.read
last_date = `git log --pretty=format:"%ad" -1`
puts data.gsub('$Date$', '$Date: ' + last_date.to_s + '$')
<p>All the script does is get the latest commit date from the git log command, stick that into any $Date$
strings it sees in stdin, and print the results &ndash; it should be simple to do in whatever language you&rsquo;re
most comfortable in. You can name this file expand_date and put it in your path. Now, you need to
<p>355</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>set up a filter in Git (call it dater) and tell it to use your expand_date filter to smudge the files on
checkout. You&rsquo;ll use a Perl expression to clean that up on commit:
<p>$ git config filter.dater.smudge expand_date
$ git config filter.dater.clean 'perl -pe "s/\\\$Date[^\\\$]*\\\$/\\\$Date\\\$/"'
<p>This Perl snippet strips out anything it sees in a $Date$ string, to get back to where you started. Now
that your filter is ready, you can test it by setting up a Git attribute for that file that engages the new
filter and creating a file with your $Date$ keyword:
<p>date*.txt filter=dater
<p>$ echo '# $Date$' &gt; date_test.txt
<p>If you commit those changes and check out the file again, you see the keyword properly substituted:
<p>$ git add date_test.txt .gitattributes
$ git commit -m "Test date expansion in Git"
$ rm date_test.txt
$ git checkout date_test.txt
$ cat date_test.txt
# $Date: Tue Apr 21 07:26:52 2009 -0700$
<p>You can see how powerful this technique can be for customized applications. You have to be
careful, though, because the .gitattributes file is committed and passed around with the project,
but the driver (in this case, dater) isn&rsquo;t, so it won&rsquo;t work everywhere. When you design these filters,
they should be able to fail gracefully and have the project still work properly.
<p>Exporting Your Repository
<p>Git attribute data also allows you to do some interesting things when exporting an archive of your
project.
<p>export-ignore
<p>You can tell Git not to export certain files or directories when generating an archive. If there is a
subdirectory or file that you don&rsquo;t want to include in your archive file but that you do want checked
into your project, you can determine those files via the export-ignore attribute.
<p>For example, say you have some test files in a test/ subdirectory, and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to
include them in the tarball export of your project. You can add the following line to your Git
attributes file:
<p>test/ export-ignore
<p>356</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Now, when you run git archive to create a tarball of your project, that directory won&rsquo;t be included
in the archive.
<p>export-subst
<p>When exporting files for deployment you can apply git log's formatting and keyword-expansion
processing to selected portions of files marked with the export-subst attribute.
<p>For instance, if you want to include a file named LAST_COMMIT in your project, and have metadata
about the last commit automatically injected into it when git archive runs, you can for example set
up your .gitattributes and LAST_COMMIT files like this:
<p>LAST_COMMIT export-subst
<p>$ echo 'Last commit date: $Format:%cd by %aN$' &gt; LAST_COMMIT
$ git add LAST_COMMIT .gitattributes
$ git commit -am 'adding LAST_COMMIT file for archives'
<p>When you run git archive, the contents of the archived file will look like this:
<p>$ git archive HEAD | tar xCf ../deployment-testing -
$ cat ../deployment-testing/LAST_COMMIT
Last commit date: Tue Apr 21 08:38:48 2009 -0700 by Scott Chacon
<p>The substitutions can include for example the commit message and any git notes, and git log can
do simple word wrapping:
<p>$ echo '$Format:Last commit: %h by %aN at %cd%n%+w(76,6,9)%B$' &gt; LAST_COMMIT
$ git commit -am 'export-subst uses git log'\''s custom formatter
<p>git archive uses git log'\''s `pretty=format:` processor
directly, and strips the surrounding `$Format:` and `$`
markup from the output.
'
$ git archive @ | tar xfO - LAST_COMMIT

&nbsp; export-subst uses git log's custom formatter
<p>&nbsp; git archive uses git log's `pretty=format:` processor directly, and
&nbsp; strips the surrounding `$Format:` and `$` markup from the output.
<p>The resulting archive is suitable for deployment work, but like any exported archive it isn&rsquo;t suitable
for further development work.
<p>357</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Merge Strategies
<p>You can also use Git attributes to tell Git to use different merge strategies for specific files in your
project. One very useful option is to tell Git to not try to merge specific files when they have
conflicts, but rather to use your side of the merge over someone else&rsquo;s.
<p>This is helpful if a branch in your project has diverged or is specialized, but you want to be able to
merge changes back in from it, and you want to ignore certain files. Say you have a database
settings file called database.xml that is different in two branches, and you want to merge in your
other branch without messing up the database file. You can set up an attribute like this:
<p>database.xml merge=ours
<p>And then define a dummy ours merge strategy with:
<p>$ git config --global merge.ours.driver true
<p>If you merge in the other branch, instead of having merge conflicts with the database.xml file, you
see something like this:
<p>$ git merge topic
Auto-merging database.xml
Merge made by recursive.
<p>In this case, database.xml stays at whatever version you originally had.
<p>Git Hooks
Like many other Version Control Systems, Git has a way to fire off custom scripts when certain
important actions occur. There are two groups of these hooks: client-side and server-side. Client-
side hooks are triggered by operations such as committing and merging, while server-side hooks
run on network operations such as receiving pushed commits. You can use these hooks for all sorts
of reasons.
<p>Installing a Hook
<p>The hooks are all stored in the hooks subdirectory of the Git directory. In most projects, that&rsquo;s
.git/hooks. When you initialize a new repository with git init, Git populates the hooks directory
with a bunch of example scripts, many of which are useful by themselves; but they also document
the input values of each script. All the examples are written as shell scripts, with some Perl thrown
in, but any properly named executable scripts will work fine &ndash; you can write them in Ruby or
Python or whatever language you are familiar with. If you want to use the bundled hook scripts,
you&rsquo;ll have to rename them; their file names all end with .sample.
<p>To enable a hook script, put a file in the hooks subdirectory of your .git directory that is named
appropriately (without any extension) and is executable. From that point forward, it should be
<p>358</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>called. We&rsquo;ll cover most of the major hook filenames here.
<p>Client-Side Hooks
<p>There are a lot of client-side hooks. This section splits them into committing-workflow hooks, email-
workflow scripts, and everything else.
<p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that client-side hooks are not copied when you clone a
repository. If your intent with these scripts is to enforce a policy, you&rsquo;ll probably
want to do that on the server side; see the example in An Example Git-Enforced
Policy.
<p>Committing-Workflow Hooks
<p>The first four hooks have to do with the committing process.
<p>The pre-commit hook is run first, before you even type in a commit message. It&rsquo;s used to inspect the
snapshot that&rsquo;s about to be committed, to see if you&rsquo;ve forgotten something, to make sure tests run,
or to examine whatever you need to inspect in the code. Exiting non-zero from this hook aborts the
commit, although you can bypass it with git commit --no-verify. You can do things like check for
code style (run lint or something equivalent), check for trailing whitespace (the default hook does
exactly this), or check for appropriate documentation on new methods.
<p>The prepare-commit-msg hook is run before the commit message editor is fired up but after the
default message is created. It lets you edit the default message before the commit author sees it.
This hook takes a few parameters: the path to the file that holds the commit message so far, the type
of commit, and the commit SHA-1 if this is an amended commit. This hook generally isn&rsquo;t useful for
normal commits; rather, it&rsquo;s good for commits where the default message is auto-generated, such as
templated commit messages, merge commits, squashed commits, and amended commits. You may
use it in conjunction with a commit template to programmatically insert information.
<p>The commit-msg hook takes one parameter, which again is the path to a temporary file that contains
the commit message written by the developer. If this script exits non-zero, Git aborts the commit
process, so you can use it to validate your project state or commit message before allowing a
commit to go through. In the last section of this chapter, we&rsquo;ll demonstrate using this hook to check
that your commit message is conformant to a required pattern.
<p>After the entire commit process is completed, the post-commit hook runs. It doesn&rsquo;t take any
parameters, but you can easily get the last commit by running git log -1 HEAD. Generally, this script
is used for notification or something similar.
<p>Email Workflow Hooks
<p>You can set up three client-side hooks for an email-based workflow. They&rsquo;re all invoked by the git
am command, so if you aren&rsquo;t using that command in your workflow, you can safely skip to the next
section. If you&rsquo;re taking patches over email prepared by git format-patch, then some of these may
be helpful to you.
<p>The first hook that is run is applypatch-msg. It takes a single argument: the name of the temporary
<p>359</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>file that contains the proposed commit message. Git aborts the patch if this script exits non-zero.
You can use this to make sure a commit message is properly formatted, or to normalize the message
by having the script edit it in place.
<p>The next hook to run when applying patches via git am is pre-applypatch. Somewhat confusingly, it
is run after the patch is applied but before a commit is made, so you can use it to inspect the
snapshot before making the commit. You can run tests or otherwise inspect the working tree with
this script. If something is missing or the tests don&rsquo;t pass, exiting non-zero aborts the git am script
without committing the patch.
<p>The last hook to run during a git am operation is post-applypatch, which runs after the commit is
made. You can use it to notify a group or the author of the patch you pulled in that you&rsquo;ve done so.
You can&rsquo;t stop the patching process with this script.
<p>Other Client Hooks
<p>The pre-rebase hook runs before you rebase anything and can halt the process by exiting non-zero.
You can use this hook to disallow rebasing any commits that have already been pushed. The
example pre-rebase hook that Git installs does this, although it makes some assumptions that may
not match with your workflow.
<p>The post-rewrite hook is run by commands that replace commits, such as git commit --amend and
git rebase (though not by git filter-branch). Its single argument is which command triggered the
rewrite, and it receives a list of rewrites on stdin. This hook has many of the same uses as the post-
checkout and post-merge hooks.
<p>After you run a successful git checkout, the post-checkout hook runs; you can use it to set up your
working directory properly for your project environment. This may mean moving in large binary
files that you don&rsquo;t want source controlled, auto-generating documentation, or something along
those lines.
<p>The post-merge hook runs after a successful merge command. You can use it to restore data in the
working tree that Git can&rsquo;t track, such as permissions data. This hook can likewise validate the
presence of files external to Git control that you may want copied in when the working tree
changes.
<p>The pre-push hook runs during git push, after the remote refs have been updated but before any
objects have been transferred. It receives the name and location of the remote as parameters, and a
list of to-be-updated refs through stdin. You can use it to validate a set of ref updates before a push
occurs (a non-zero exit code will abort the push).
<p>Git occasionally does garbage collection as part of its normal operation, by invoking git gc --auto.
The pre-auto-gc hook is invoked just before the garbage collection takes place, and can be used to
notify you that this is happening, or to abort the collection if now isn&rsquo;t a good time.
<p>Server-Side Hooks
<p>In addition to the client-side hooks, you can use a couple of important server-side hooks as a system
administrator to enforce nearly any kind of policy for your project. These scripts run before and
after pushes to the server. The pre hooks can exit non-zero at any time to reject the push as well as
<p>360</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>print an error message back to the client; you can set up a push policy that&rsquo;s as complex as you
wish.
<p>pre-receive
<p>The first script to run when handling a push from a client is pre-receive. It takes a list of references
that are being pushed from stdin; if it exits non-zero, none of them are accepted. You can use this
hook to do things like make sure none of the updated references are non-fast-forwards, or to do
access control for all the refs and files they&rsquo;re modifying with the push.
<p>update
<p>The update script is very similar to the pre-receive script, except that it&rsquo;s run once for each branch
the pusher is trying to update. If the pusher is trying to push to multiple branches, pre-receive runs
only once, whereas update runs once per branch they&rsquo;re pushing to. Instead of reading from stdin,
this script takes three arguments: the name of the reference (branch), the SHA-1 that reference
pointed to before the push, and the SHA-1 the user is trying to push. If the update script exits non-
zero, only that reference is rejected; other references can still be updated.
<p>post-receive
<p>The post-receive hook runs after the entire process is completed and can be used to update other
services or notify users. It takes the same stdin data as the pre-receive hook. Examples include
emailing a list, notifying a continuous integration server, or updating a ticket-tracking system &ndash; you
can even parse the commit messages to see if any tickets need to be opened, modified, or closed.
This script can&rsquo;t stop the push process, but the client doesn&rsquo;t disconnect until it has completed, so be
careful if you try to do anything that may take a long time.
<p>An Example Git-Enforced Policy
In this section, you&rsquo;ll use what you&rsquo;ve learned to establish a Git workflow that checks for a custom
commit message format, and allows only certain users to modify certain subdirectories in a project.
You&rsquo;ll build client scripts that help the developer know if their push will be rejected and server
scripts that actually enforce the policies.
<p>The scripts we&rsquo;ll show are written in Ruby; partly because of our intellectual inertia, but also
because Ruby is easy to read, even if you can&rsquo;t necessarily write it. However, any language will
work &ndash; all the sample hook scripts distributed with Git are in either Perl or Bash, so you can also see
plenty of examples of hooks in those languages by looking at the samples.
<p>Server-Side Hook
<p>All the server-side work will go into the update file in your hooks directory. The update hook runs
once per branch being pushed and takes three arguments:
<p>&bull; The name of the reference being pushed to
<p>&bull; The old revision where that branch was
<p>&bull; The new revision being pushed
<p>361</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>You also have access to the user doing the pushing if the push is being run over SSH. If you&rsquo;ve
allowed everyone to connect with a single user (like &ldquo;git&rdquo;) via public-key authentication, you may
have to give that user a shell wrapper that determines which user is connecting based on the public
key, and set an environment variable accordingly. Here we&rsquo;ll assume the connecting user is in the
$USER environment variable, so your update script begins by gathering all the information you
need:
<p>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
<p>$refname = ARGV[0]
$oldrev = ARGV[1]
$newrev = ARGV[2]
$user = ENV['USER']
<p>puts "Enforcing Policies..."
puts "(#{$refname}) (#{$oldrev[0,6]}) (#{$newrev[0,6]})"
<p>Yes, those are global variables. Don&rsquo;t judge &ndash; it&rsquo;s easier to demonstrate this way.
<p>Enforcing a Specific Commit-Message Format
<p>Your first challenge is to enforce that each commit message adheres to a particular format. Just to
have a target, assume that each message has to include a string that looks like &ldquo;ref: 1234&rdquo; because
you want each commit to link to a work item in your ticketing system. You must look at each
commit being pushed up, see if that string is in the commit message, and, if the string is absent
from any of the commits, exit non-zero so the push is rejected.
<p>You can get a list of the SHA-1 values of all the commits that are being pushed by taking the $newrev
and $oldrev values and passing them to a Git plumbing command called git rev-list. This is
basically the git log command, but by default it prints out only the SHA-1 values and no other
information. So, to get a list of all the commit SHA-1s introduced between one commit SHA-1 and
another, you can run something like this:
<p>$ git rev-list 538c33..d14fc7
d14fc7c847ab946ec39590d87783c69b031bdfb7
9f585da4401b0a3999e84113824d15245c13f0be
234071a1be950e2a8d078e6141f5cd20c1e61ad3
dfa04c9ef3d5197182f13fb5b9b1fb7717d2222a
17716ec0f1ff5c77eff40b7fe912f9f6cfd0e475
<p>You can take that output, loop through each of those commit SHA-1s, grab the message for it, and
test that message against a regular expression that looks for a pattern.
<p>You have to figure out how to get the commit message from each of these commits to test. To get the
raw commit data, you can use another plumbing command called git cat-file. We&rsquo;ll go over all
these plumbing commands in detail in Git Internals; but for now, here&rsquo;s what that command gives
you:

<p>Change the version number
<p>A simple way to get the commit message from a commit when you have the SHA-1 value is to go to
the first blank line and take everything after that. You can do so with the sed command on Unix
systems:
<p>$ git cat-file commit ca82a6 | sed '1,/^$/d'
Change the version number
<p>You can use that incantation to grab the commit message from each commit that is trying to be
pushed and exit if you see anything that doesn&rsquo;t match. To exit the script and reject the push, exit
non-zero. The whole method looks like this:
<p>$regex = /\[ref: (\d+)\]/
<p># enforced custom commit message format
def check_message_format
&nbsp; missed_revs = `git rev-list #{$oldrev}..#{$newrev}`.split("\n")
&nbsp; missed_revs.each do |rev|
&nbsp; message = `git cat-file commit #{rev} | sed '1,/^$/d'`
&nbsp; if !$regex.match(message)
&nbsp; puts "[POLICY] Your message is not formatted correctly"
&nbsp; exit 1
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; end
end
check_message_format
<p>Putting that in your update script will reject updates that contain commits that have messages that
don&rsquo;t adhere to your rule.
<p>Enforcing a User-Based ACL System
<p>Suppose you want to add a mechanism that uses an access control list (ACL) that specifies which
users are allowed to push changes to which parts of your projects. Some people have full access,
and others can only push changes to certain subdirectories or specific files. To enforce this, you&rsquo;ll
write those rules to a file named acl that lives in your bare Git repository on the server. You&rsquo;ll have
the update hook look at those rules, see what files are being introduced for all the commits being
pushed, and determine whether the user doing the push has access to update all those files.
<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll do is write your ACL. Here you&rsquo;ll use a format very much like the CVS ACL
<p>363</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>mechanism: it uses a series of lines, where the first field is avail or unavail, the next field is a
comma-delimited list of the users to which the rule applies, and the last field is the path to which
the rule applies (blank meaning open access). All of these fields are delimited by a pipe (|)
character.
<p>In this case, you have a couple of administrators, some documentation writers with access to the
doc directory, and one developer who only has access to the lib and tests directories, and your ACL
file looks like this:
<p>avail|nickh,pjhyett,defunkt,tpw
avail|usinclair,cdickens,ebronte|doc
avail|schacon|lib
avail|schacon|tests
<p>You begin by reading this data into a structure that you can use. In this case, to keep the example
simple, you&rsquo;ll only enforce the avail directives. Here is a method that gives you an associative array
where the key is the user name and the value is an array of paths to which the user has write
access:
<p>def get_acl_access_data(acl_file)
&nbsp; # read in ACL data
&nbsp; acl_file = File.read(acl_file).split("\n").reject { |line| line == '' }
&nbsp; access = {}
&nbsp; acl_file.each do |line|
&nbsp; avail, users, path = line.split('|')
&nbsp; next unless avail == 'avail'
&nbsp; users.split(',').each do |user|
&nbsp; access[user] ||= []
&nbsp; access[user] &lt;&lt; path
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; access
end
<p>On the ACL file you looked at earlier, this get_acl_access_data method returns a data structure that
looks like this:
<p>{"defunkt"=&gt;[nil],
&nbsp;"tpw"=&gt;[nil],
&nbsp;"nickh"=&gt;[nil],
&nbsp;"pjhyett"=&gt;[nil],
&nbsp;"schacon"=&gt;["lib", "tests"],
&nbsp;"cdickens"=&gt;["doc"],
&nbsp;"usinclair"=&gt;["doc"],
&nbsp;"ebronte"=&gt;["doc"]}
<p>Now that you have the permissions sorted out, you need to determine what paths the commits
<p>364</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>being pushed have modified, so you can make sure the user who&rsquo;s pushing has access to all of them.
<p>You can pretty easily see what files have been modified in a single commit with the --name-only
option to the git log command (mentioned briefly in Git Basics):
<p>$ git log -1 --name-only --pretty=format:'' 9f585d
<p>README
lib/test.rb
<p>If you use the ACL structure returned from the get_acl_access_data method and check it against the
listed files in each of the commits, you can determine whether the user has access to push all of
their commits:
<p># only allows certain users to modify certain subdirectories in a project
def check_directory_perms
&nbsp; access = get_acl_access_data('acl')
<p>&nbsp; # see if anyone is trying to push something they can't
&nbsp; new_commits = `git rev-list #{$oldrev}..#{$newrev}`.split("\n")
&nbsp; new_commits.each do |rev|
&nbsp; files_modified = `git log -1 --name-only --pretty=format:'' #{rev}`.split("\n")
&nbsp; files_modified.each do |path|
&nbsp; next if path.size == 0
&nbsp; has_file_access = false
&nbsp; access[$user].each do |access_path|
&nbsp; if !access_path # user has access to everything
&nbsp; || (path.start_with? access_path) # access to this path
&nbsp; has_file_access = true
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; if !has_file_access
&nbsp; puts "[POLICY] You do not have access to push to #{path}"
&nbsp; exit 1
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; end
end
<p>check_directory_perms
<p>You get a list of new commits being pushed to your server with git rev-list. Then, for each of those
commits, you find which files are modified and make sure the user who&rsquo;s pushing has access to all
the paths being modified.
<p>Now your users can&rsquo;t push any commits with badly formed messages or with modified files outside
of their designated paths.
<p>365</p>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Testing It Out
<p>If you run chmod u+x .git/hooks/update, which is the file into which you should have put all this
code, and then try to push a commit with a non-compliant message, you get something like this:
<p>$ git push -f origin master

Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.

Enforcing Policies...
(refs/heads/master) (8338c5) (c5b616)
[POLICY] Your message is not formatted correctly
error: hooks/update exited with error code 1
error: hook declined to update refs/heads/master
To git@gitserver:project.git
&nbsp;! [remote rejected] master -&gt; master (hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@gitserver:project.git'
<p>There are a couple of interesting things here. First, you see this where the hook starts running.
<p>Enforcing Policies...
(refs/heads/master) (fb8c72) (c56860)
<p>Remember that you printed that out at the very beginning of your update script. Anything your
script echoes to stdout will be transferred to the client.
<p>The next thing you&rsquo;ll notice is the error message.
<p>[POLICY] Your message is not formatted correctly
error: hooks/update exited with error code 1
error: hook declined to update refs/heads/master
<p>The first line was printed out by you, the other two were Git telling you that the update script exited
non-zero and that is what is declining your push. Lastly, you have this:
<p>To git@gitserver:project.git
&nbsp;! [remote rejected] master -&gt; master (hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@gitserver:project.git'
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a remote rejected message for each reference that your hook declined, and it tells you
that it was declined specifically because of a hook failure.
<p>Furthermore, if someone tries to edit a file they don&rsquo;t have access to and push a commit containing
it, they will see something similar. For instance, if a documentation author tries to push a commit
<p>366</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>modifying something in the lib directory, they see
<p>[POLICY] You do not have access to push to lib/test.rb
<p>From now on, as long as that update script is there and executable, your repository will never have
a commit message without your pattern in it, and your users will be sandboxed.
<p>Client-Side Hooks
<p>The downside to this approach is the whining that will inevitably result when your users' commit
pushes are rejected. Having their carefully crafted work rejected at the last minute can be
extremely frustrating and confusing; and furthermore, they will have to edit their history to correct
it, which isn&rsquo;t always for the faint of heart.
<p>The answer to this dilemma is to provide some client-side hooks that users can run to notify them
when they&rsquo;re doing something that the server is likely to reject. That way, they can correct any
problems before committing and before those issues become more difficult to fix. Because hooks
aren&rsquo;t transferred with a clone of a project, you must distribute these scripts some other way and
then have your users copy them to their .git/hooks directory and make them executable. You can
distribute these hooks within the project or in a separate project, but Git won&rsquo;t set them up
automatically.
<p>To begin, you should check your commit message just before each commit is recorded, so you know
the server won&rsquo;t reject your changes due to badly formatted commit messages. To do this, you can
add the commit-msg hook. If you have it read the message from the file passed as the first argument
and compare that to the pattern, you can force Git to abort the commit if there is no match:
<p>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
message_file = ARGV[0]
message = File.read(message_file)
<p>$regex = /\[ref: (\d+)\]/
<p>if !$regex.match(message)
&nbsp; puts "[POLICY] Your message is not formatted correctly"
&nbsp; exit 1
end
<p>If that script is in place (in .git/hooks/commit-msg) and executable, and you commit with a message
that isn&rsquo;t properly formatted, you see this:
<p>$ git commit -am 'Test'
[POLICY] Your message is not formatted correctly
<p>No commit was completed in that instance. However, if your message contains the proper pattern,
Git allows you to commit:
<p>367</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git commit -am 'Test [ref: 132]'
[master e05c914] Test [ref: 132]
&nbsp;1 file changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
<p>Next, you want to make sure you aren&rsquo;t modifying files that are outside your ACL scope. If your
project&rsquo;s .git directory contains a copy of the ACL file you used previously, then the following pre-
commit script will enforce those constraints for you:
<p>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
<p>$user = ENV['USER']
<p># [ insert acl_access_data method from above ]
<p># only allows certain users to modify certain subdirectories in a project
def check_directory_perms
&nbsp; access = get_acl_access_data('.git/acl')
<p>&nbsp; files_modified = `git diff-index --cached --name-only HEAD`.split("\n")
&nbsp; files_modified.each do |path|
&nbsp; next if path.size == 0
&nbsp; has_file_access = false
&nbsp; access[$user].each do |access_path|
&nbsp; if !access_path || (path.index(access_path) == 0)
&nbsp; has_file_access = true
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; if !has_file_access
&nbsp; puts "[POLICY] You do not have access to push to #{path}"
&nbsp; exit 1
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; end
end
<p>check_directory_perms
<p>This is roughly the same script as the server-side part, but with two important differences. First, the
ACL file is in a different place, because this script runs from your working directory, not from your
.git directory. You have to change the path to the ACL file from this
<p>access = get_acl_access_data('acl')
<p>to this:
<p>access = get_acl_access_data('.git/acl')
<p>The other important difference is the way you get a listing of the files that have been changed.
<p>368</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Because the server-side method looks at the log of commits, and, at this point, the commit hasn&rsquo;t
been recorded yet, you must get your file listing from the staging area instead. Instead of
<p>files_modified = `git log -1 --name-only --pretty=format:'' #{ref}`
<p>you have to use
<p>files_modified = `git diff-index --cached --name-only HEAD`
<p>But those are the only two differences &ndash; otherwise, the script works the same way. One caveat is
that it expects you to be running locally as the same user you push as to the remote machine. If that
is different, you must set the $user variable manually.
<p>One other thing we can do here is make sure the user doesn&rsquo;t push non-fast-forwarded references.
To get a reference that isn&rsquo;t a fast-forward, you either have to rebase past a commit you&rsquo;ve already
pushed up or try pushing a different local branch up to the same remote branch.
<p>Presumably, the server is already configured with receive.denyDeletes and
receive.denyNonFastForwards to enforce this policy, so the only accidental thing you can try to catch
is rebasing commits that have already been pushed.
<p>Here is an example pre-rebase script that checks for that. It gets a list of all the commits you&rsquo;re
about to rewrite and checks whether they exist in any of your remote references. If it sees one that
is reachable from one of your remote references, it aborts the rebase.
<p>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
<p>base_branch = ARGV[0]
if ARGV[1]
&nbsp; topic_branch = ARGV[1]
else
&nbsp; topic_branch = "HEAD"
end
<p>target_shas = `git rev-list #{base_branch}..#{topic_branch}`.split("\n")
remote_refs = `git branch -r`.split("\n").map { |r| r.strip }
<p>target_shas.each do |sha|
&nbsp; remote_refs.each do |remote_ref|
&nbsp; shas_pushed = `git rev-list ^#{sha}^@ refs/remotes/#{remote_ref}`
&nbsp; if shas_pushed.split("\n").include?(sha)
&nbsp; puts "[POLICY] Commit #{sha} has already been pushed to #{remote_ref}"
&nbsp; exit 1
&nbsp; end
&nbsp; end
end
<p>369</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>This script uses a syntax that wasn&rsquo;t covered in Revision Selection. You get a list of commits that
have already been pushed up by running this:
<p>`git rev-list ^#{sha}^@ refs/remotes/#{remote_ref}`
<p>The SHA^@ syntax resolves to all the parents of that commit. You&rsquo;re looking for any commit that is
reachable from the last commit on the remote and that isn&rsquo;t reachable from any parent of any of
the SHA-1s you&rsquo;re trying to push up &ndash; meaning it&rsquo;s a fast-forward.
<p>The main drawback to this approach is that it can be very slow and is often unnecessary &ndash; if you
don&rsquo;t try to force the push with -f, the server will warn you and not accept the push. However, it&rsquo;s
an interesting exercise and can in theory help you avoid a rebase that you might later have to go
back and fix.
<p>Summary
We&rsquo;ve covered most of the major ways that you can customize your Git client and server to best fit
your workflow and projects. You&rsquo;ve learned about all sorts of configuration settings, file-based
attributes, and event hooks, and you&rsquo;ve built an example policy-enforcing server. You should now
be able to make Git fit nearly any workflow you can dream up.

<p>Git and Other Systems
The world isn&rsquo;t perfect. Usually, you can&rsquo;t immediately switch every project you come in contact
with to Git. Sometimes you&rsquo;re stuck on a project using another VCS, and wish it was Git. We&rsquo;ll spend
the first part of this chapter learning about ways to use Git as a client when the project you&rsquo;re
working on is hosted in a different system.
<p>At some point, you may want to convert your existing project to Git. The second part of this chapter
covers how to migrate your project into Git from several specific systems, as well as a method that
will work if no pre-built import tool exists.
<p>Git as a Client
Git provides such a nice experience for developers that many people have figured out how to use it
on their workstation, even if the rest of their team is using an entirely different VCS. There are a
number of these adapters, called &ldquo;bridges,&rdquo; available. Here we&rsquo;ll cover the ones you&rsquo;re most likely
to run into in the wild.
<p>Git and Subversion
<p>A large fraction of open source development projects and a good number of corporate projects use
Subversion to manage their source code. It&rsquo;s been around for more than a decade, and for most of
that time was the de facto VCS choice for open-source projects. It&rsquo;s also very similar in many ways
to CVS, which was the big boy of the source-control world before that.
<p>One of Git&rsquo;s great features is a bidirectional bridge to Subversion called git svn. This tool allows
you to use Git as a valid client to a Subversion server, so you can use all the local features of Git and
then push to a Subversion server as if you were using Subversion locally. This means you can do
local branching and merging, use the staging area, use rebasing and cherry-picking, and so on,
while your collaborators continue to work in their dark and ancient ways. It&rsquo;s a good way to sneak
Git into the corporate environment and help your fellow developers become more efficient while
you lobby to get the infrastructure changed to support Git fully. The Subversion bridge is the
gateway drug to the DVCS world.
<p>git svn
<p>The base command in Git for all the Subversion bridging commands is git svn. It takes quite a few
commands, so we&rsquo;ll show the most common while going through a few simple workflows.
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that when you&rsquo;re using git svn, you&rsquo;re interacting with Subversion, which is a
system that works very differently from Git. Although you can do local branching and merging, it&rsquo;s
generally best to keep your history as linear as possible by rebasing your work, and avoiding doing
things like simultaneously interacting with a Git remote repository.
<p>Don&rsquo;t rewrite your history and try to push again, and don&rsquo;t push to a parallel Git repository to
collaborate with fellow Git developers at the same time. Subversion can have only a single linear
history, and confusing it is very easy. If you&rsquo;re working with a team, and some are using SVN and
others are using Git, make sure everyone is using the SVN server to collaborate &ndash; doing so will make
<p>371</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>your life easier.
<p>Setting Up
<p>To demonstrate this functionality, you need a typical SVN repository that you have write access to.
If you want to copy these examples, you&rsquo;ll have to make a writeable copy of an SVN test repository.
In order to do that easily, you can use a tool called svnsync that comes with Subversion.
<p>To follow along, you first need to create a new local Subversion repository:
<p>$ mkdir /tmp/test-svn
$ svnadmin create /tmp/test-svn
<p>Then, enable all users to change revprops &ndash; the easy way is to add a pre-revprop-change script that
always exits 0:
<p>$ cat /tmp/test-svn/hooks/pre-revprop-change
#!/bin/sh
exit 0;
$ chmod +x /tmp/test-svn/hooks/pre-revprop-change
<p>You can now sync this project to your local machine by calling svnsync init with the to and from
repositories.
<p>$ svnsync init file:///tmp/test-svn \
&nbsp; http://your-svn-server.example.org/svn/
<p>This sets up the properties to run the sync. You can then clone the code by running
<p>$ svnsync sync file:///tmp/test-svn
Committed revision 1.
Copied properties for revision 1.
Transmitting file data .............................[...]
Committed revision 2.
Copied properties for revision 2.
[&hellip;]
<p>Although this operation may take only a few minutes, if you try to copy the original repository to
another remote repository instead of a local one, the process will take nearly an hour, even though
there are fewer than 100 commits. Subversion has to clone one revision at a time and then push it
back into another repository &ndash; it&rsquo;s ridiculously inefficient, but it&rsquo;s the only easy way to do this.
<p>Getting Started
<p>Now that you have a Subversion repository to which you have write access, you can go through a
typical workflow. You&rsquo;ll start with the git svn clone command, which imports an entire Subversion
<p>372</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>repository into a local Git repository. Remember that if you&rsquo;re importing from a real hosted
Subversion repository, you should replace the file:///tmp/test-svn here with the URL of your
Subversion repository:
<p>$ git svn clone file:///tmp/test-svn -T trunk -b branches -t tags
Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/progit/test-svn/.git/

Checked out HEAD:
&nbsp; file:///tmp/test-svn/trunk r75
<p>This runs the equivalent of two commands &ndash; git svn init followed by git svn fetch &ndash; on the URL
you provide. This can take a while. If, for example, the test project has only about 75 commits and
the codebase isn&rsquo;t that big, Git nevertheless must check out each version, one at a time, and commit
it individually. For a project with hundreds or thousands of commits, this can literally take hours or
even days to finish.
<p>The -T trunk -b branches -t tags part tells Git that this Subversion repository follows the basic
branching and tagging conventions. If you name your trunk, branches, or tags differently, you can
change these options. Because this is so common, you can replace this entire part with -s, which
means standard layout and implies all those options. The following command is equivalent:
<p>$ git svn clone file:///tmp/test-svn -s
<p>At this point, you should have a valid Git repository that has imported your branches and tags:
<p>$ git branch -a
* master
&nbsp; remotes/origin/my-calc-branch
&nbsp; remotes/origin/tags/2.0.2
&nbsp; remotes/origin/tags/release-2.0.1
&nbsp; remotes/origin/tags/release-2.0.2
&nbsp; remotes/origin/tags/release-2.0.2rc1
&nbsp; remotes/origin/trunk
<p>373</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Note how this tool manages Subversion tags as remote refs. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look with the Git
plumbing command show-ref:
<p>$ git show-ref
556a3e1e7ad1fde0a32823fc7e4d046bcfd86dae refs/heads/master
0fb585761df569eaecd8146c71e58d70147460a2 refs/remotes/origin/my-calc-branch

556a3e1e7ad1fde0a32823fc7e4d046bcfd86dae refs/remotes/origin/trunk
<p>Git doesn&rsquo;t do this when it clones from a Git server; here&rsquo;s what a repository with tags looks like
after a fresh clone:
<p>$ git show-ref
c3dcbe8488c6240392e8a5d7553bbffcb0f94ef0 refs/remotes/origin/master
32ef1d1c7cc8c603ab78416262cc421b80a8c2df refs/remotes/origin/branch-1

6dcb09b5b57875f334f61aebed695e2e4193db5e refs/tags/v1.0.0
<p>Git fetches the tags directly into refs/tags, rather than treating them remote branches.
<p>Committing Back to Subversion
<p>Now that you have a working directory, you can do some work on the project and push your
commits back upstream, using Git effectively as an SVN client. If you edit one of the files and
commit it, you have a commit that exists in Git locally that doesn&rsquo;t exist on the Subversion server:
<p>$ git commit -am 'Adding git-svn instructions to the README'
[master 4af61fd] Adding git-svn instructions to the README
&nbsp;1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
<p>Next, you need to push your change upstream. Notice how this changes the way you work with
Subversion &ndash; you can do several commits offline and then push them all at once to the Subversion
server. To push to a Subversion server, you run the git svn dcommit command:
<p>374</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ git svn dcommit

Resetting to the latest refs/remotes/origin/trunk
<p>This takes all the commits you&rsquo;ve made on top of the Subversion server code, does a Subversion
commit for each, and then rewrites your local Git commit to include a unique identifier. This is
important because it means that all the SHA-1 checksums for your commits change. Partly for this
reason, working with Git-based remote versions of your projects concurrently with a Subversion
server isn&rsquo;t a good idea. If you look at the last commit, you can see the new git-svn-id that was
added:
<p>$ git log -1
commit 95e0222ba6399739834380eb10afcd73e0670bc5

<p>&nbsp; git-svn-id: file:///tmp/test-svn/trunk@77 0b684db3-b064-4277-89d1-21af03df0a68
<p>Notice that the SHA-1 checksum that originally started with 4af61fd when you committed now
begins with 95e0222. If you want to push to both a Git server and a Subversion server, you have to
push (dcommit) to the Subversion server first, because that action changes your commit data.
<p>Pulling in New Changes
<p>If you&rsquo;re working with other developers, then at some point one of you will push, and then the
other one will try to push a change that conflicts. That change will be rejected until you merge in
their work. In git svn, it looks like this:

First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
<p>This is important to remember, because the outcome is a project state that didn&rsquo;t exist on either of
your computers when you pushed. If the changes are incompatible but don&rsquo;t conflict, you may get
issues that are difficult to diagnose. This is different than using a Git server &ndash; in Git, you can fully
test the state on your client system before publishing it, whereas in SVN, you can&rsquo;t ever be certain
that the states immediately before commit and after commit are identical.
<p>You should also run this command to pull in changes from the Subversion server, even if you&rsquo;re not
ready to commit yourself. You can run git svn fetch to grab the new data, but git svn rebase does
the fetch and then updates your local commits.

Fast-forwarded master to refs/remotes/origin/trunk.
<p>Running git svn rebase every once in a while makes sure your code is always up to date. You need
to be sure your working directory is clean when you run this, though. If you have local changes,
you must either stash your work or temporarily commit it before running git svn rebase &ndash;
otherwise, the command will stop if it sees that the rebase will result in a merge conflict.
<p>Git Branching Issues
<p>When you&rsquo;ve become comfortable with a Git workflow, you&rsquo;ll likely create topic branches, do work
on them, and then merge them in. If you&rsquo;re pushing to a Subversion server via git svn, you may
want to rebase your work onto a single branch each time instead of merging branches together. The
reason to prefer rebasing is that Subversion has a linear history and doesn&rsquo;t deal with merges like
Git does, so git svn follows only the first parent when converting the snapshots into Subversion
commits.
<p>377</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Suppose your history looks like the following: you created an experiment branch, did two commits,
and then merged them back into master. When you dcommit, you see output like this:
<p>$ git svn dcommit
Committing to file:///tmp/test-svn/trunk ...
&nbsp; M CHANGES.txt

refs/remotes/origin/trunk
Resetting to the latest refs/remotes/origin/trunk
<p>Running dcommit on a branch with merged history works fine, except that when you look at your Git
project history, it hasn&rsquo;t rewritten either of the commits you made on the experiment branch &ndash;
instead, all those changes appear in the SVN version of the single merge commit.
<p>When someone else clones that work, all they see is the merge commit with all the work squashed
into it, as though you ran git merge --squash; they don&rsquo;t see the commit data about where it came
from or when it was committed.
<p>Subversion Branching
<p>Branching in Subversion isn&rsquo;t the same as branching in Git; if you can avoid using it much, that&rsquo;s
probably best. However, you can create and commit to branches in Subversion using git svn.
<p>Creating a New SVN Branch
<p>To create a new branch in Subversion, you run git svn branch [new-branch]:
<p>$ git svn branch opera
Copying file:///tmp/test-svn/trunk at r90 to file:///tmp/test-svn/branches/opera...
Found possible branch point: file:///tmp/test-svn/trunk =&gt; file:///tmp/test-
svn/branches/opera, 90
Found branch parent: (refs/remotes/origin/opera)

Following parent with do_switch
Successfully followed parent
r91 = f1b64a3855d3c8dd84ee0ef10fa89d27f1584302 (refs/remotes/origin/opera)
<p>This does the equivalent of the svn copy trunk branches/opera command in Subversion and
operates on the Subversion server. It&rsquo;s important to note that it doesn&rsquo;t check you out into that
<p>378</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>branch; if you commit at this point, that commit will go to trunk on the server, not opera.
<p>Switching Active Branches
<p>Git figures out what branch your dcommits go to by looking for the tip of any of your Subversion
branches in your history &ndash; you should have only one, and it should be the last one with a git-svn-id
in your current branch history.
<p>If you want to work on more than one branch simultaneously, you can set up local branches to
dcommit to specific Subversion branches by starting them at the imported Subversion commit for
that branch. If you want an opera branch that you can work on separately, you can run
<p>$ git branch opera remotes/origin/opera
<p>Now, if you want to merge your opera branch into trunk (your master branch), you can do so with a
normal git merge. But you need to provide a descriptive commit message (via -m), or the merge will
say &ldquo;Merge branch opera&rdquo; instead of something useful.
<p>Remember that although you&rsquo;re using git merge to do this operation, and the merge likely will be
much easier than it would be in Subversion (because Git will automatically detect the appropriate
merge base for you), this isn&rsquo;t a normal Git merge commit. You have to push this data back to a
Subversion server that can&rsquo;t handle a commit that tracks more than one parent; so, after you push
it up, it will look like a single commit that squashed in all the work of another branch under a
single commit. After you merge one branch into another, you can&rsquo;t easily go back and continue
working on that branch, as you normally can in Git. The dcommit command that you run erases any
information that says what branch was merged in, so subsequent merge-base calculations will be
wrong &ndash; the dcommit makes your git merge result look like you ran git merge --squash.
Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no good way to avoid this situation &ndash; Subversion can&rsquo;t store this information,
so you&rsquo;ll always be crippled by its limitations while you&rsquo;re using it as your server. To avoid issues,
you should delete the local branch (in this case, opera) after you merge it into trunk.
<p>Subversion Commands
<p>The git svn toolset provides a number of commands to help ease the transition to Git by providing
some functionality that&rsquo;s similar to what you had in Subversion. Here are a few commands that
give you what Subversion used to.
<p>SVN Style History
<p>If you&rsquo;re used to Subversion and want to see your history in SVN output style, you can run git svn
log to view your commit history in SVN formatting:

<p>updated the changelog
<p>You should know two important things about git svn log. First, it works offline, unlike the real svn
log command, which asks the Subversion server for the data. Second, it only shows you commits
that have been committed up to the Subversion server. Local Git commits that you haven&rsquo;t
dcommited don&rsquo;t show up; neither do commits that people have made to the Subversion server in
the meantime. It&rsquo;s more like the last known state of the commits on the Subversion server.
<p>SVN Annotation
<p>Much as the git svn log command simulates the svn log command offline, you can get the
equivalent of svn annotate by running git svn blame [FILE]. The output looks like this:
<p>$ git svn blame README.txt

<p>Again, it doesn&rsquo;t show commits that you did locally in Git or that have been pushed to Subversion in
the meantime.
<p>SVN Server Information
<p>You can also get the same sort of information that svn info gives you by running git svn info:

<p>This is like blame and log in that it runs offline and is up to date only as of the last time you
communicated with the Subversion server.
<p>Ignoring What Subversion Ignores
<p>If you clone a Subversion repository that has svn:ignore properties set anywhere, you&rsquo;ll likely want
to set corresponding .gitignore files so you don&rsquo;t accidentally commit files that you shouldn&rsquo;t. git
svn has two commands to help with this issue. The first is git svn create-ignore, which
automatically creates corresponding .gitignore files for you so your next commit can include them.
<p>The second command is git svn show-ignore, which prints to stdout the lines you need to put in a
.gitignore file so you can redirect the output into your project exclude file:
<p>$ git svn show-ignore &gt; .git/info/exclude
<p>That way, you don&rsquo;t litter the project with .gitignore files. This is a good option if you&rsquo;re the only Git
user on a Subversion team, and your teammates don&rsquo;t want .gitignore files in the project.
<p>Git-Svn Summary
<p>The git svn tools are useful if you&rsquo;re stuck with a Subversion server, or are otherwise in a
development environment that necessitates running a Subversion server. You should consider it
crippled Git, however, or you&rsquo;ll hit issues in translation that may confuse you and your
collaborators. To stay out of trouble, try to follow these guidelines:
<p>&bull; Keep a linear Git history that doesn&rsquo;t contain merge commits made by git merge. Rebase any
work you do outside of your mainline branch back onto it; don&rsquo;t merge it in.
<p>&bull; Don&rsquo;t set up and collaborate on a separate Git server. Possibly have one to speed up clones for
new developers, but don&rsquo;t push anything to it that doesn&rsquo;t have a git-svn-id entry. You may
even want to add a pre-receive hook that checks each commit message for a git-svn-id and
rejects pushes that contain commits without it.
<p>If you follow those guidelines, working with a Subversion server can be more bearable. However, if
it&rsquo;s possible to move to a real Git server, doing so can gain your team a lot more.

<p>Git and Mercurial
<p>The DVCS universe is larger than just Git. In fact, there are many other systems in this space, each
with their own angle on how to do distributed version control correctly. Apart from Git, the most
popular is Mercurial, and the two are very similar in many respects.
<p>The good news, if you prefer Git&rsquo;s client-side behavior but are working with a project whose source
code is controlled with Mercurial, is that there&rsquo;s a way to use Git as a client for a Mercurial-hosted
repository. Since the way Git talks to server repositories is through remotes, it should come as no
surprise that this bridge is implemented as a remote helper. The project&rsquo;s name is git-remote-hg,
and it can be found at https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-hg.
<p>git-remote-hg
<p>First, you need to install git-remote-hg. This basically entails dropping its file somewhere in your
path, like so:
<p>$ curl -o ~/bin/git-remote-hg \
&nbsp; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipec/git-remote-hg/master/git-remote-hg
$ chmod +x ~/bin/git-remote-hg
<p>&hellip;assuming ~/bin is in your $PATH. Git-remote-hg has one other dependency: the mercurial library
for Python. If you have Python installed, this is as simple as:
<p>$ pip install mercurial
<p>(If you don&rsquo;t have Python installed, visit https://www.python.org/ and get it first.)
<p>The last thing you&rsquo;ll need is the Mercurial client. Go to https://www.mercurial-scm.org/ and install it
if you haven&rsquo;t already.
<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to rock. All you need is a Mercurial repository you can push to. Fortunately, every
Mercurial repository can act this way, so we&rsquo;ll just use the "hello world" repository everyone uses to
learn Mercurial:
<p>$ hg clone http://selenic.com/repo/hello /tmp/hello
<p>Getting Started
<p>Now that we have a suitable &ldquo;server-side&rdquo; repository, we can go through a typical workflow. As
you&rsquo;ll see, these two systems are similar enough that there isn&rsquo;t much friction.
<p>As always with Git, first we clone:

refs/hg/origin/branches/default, refs/hg/origin/bookmarks/master, master) Create a
makefile
* 65bb417 Create a standard 'hello, world' program
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that working with a Mercurial repository uses the standard git clone command. That&rsquo;s
because git-remote-hg is working at a fairly low level, using a similar mechanism to how Git&rsquo;s
HTTP/S protocol is implemented (remote helpers). Since Git and Mercurial are both designed for
every client to have a full copy of the repository history, this command makes a full clone, including
all the project&rsquo;s history, and does it fairly quickly.
<p>The log command shows two commits, the latest of which is pointed to by a whole slew of refs. It
turns out some of these aren&rsquo;t actually there. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s actually in the .git
directory:
<p>$ tree .git/refs
.git/refs
├── heads
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── master
├── hg
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── origin
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── bookmarks
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── master
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── branches
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── default
├── notes
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── hg
├── remotes
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── origin
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── HEAD
└── tags
<p>9 directories, 5 files
<p>Git-remote-hg is trying to make things more idiomatically Git-esque, but under the hood it&rsquo;s
managing the conceptual mapping between two slightly different systems. The refs/hg directory is
where the actual remote refs are stored. For example, the refs/hg/origin/branches/default is a Git
ref file that contains the SHA-1 starting with &ldquo;ac7955c&rdquo;, which is the commit that master points to. So
the refs/hg directory is kind of like a fake refs/remotes/origin, but it has the added distinction
between bookmarks and branches.
<p>The notes/hg file is the starting point for how git-remote-hg maps Git commit hashes to Mercurial
changeset IDs. Let&rsquo;s explore a bit:
<p>383</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>$ cat notes/hg
d4c10386...
<p>$ git cat-file -p d4c10386...
tree 1781c96...
author remote-hg &lt;&gt; 1408066400 -0800
committer remote-hg &lt;&gt; 1408066400 -0800
<p>Notes for master
<p>$ git ls-tree 1781c96...
100644 blob ac9117f... 65bb417...
100644 blob 485e178... ac7955c...
<p>$ git cat-file -p ac9117f
0a04b987be5ae354b710cefeba0e2d9de7ad41a9
<p>So refs/notes/hg points to a tree, which in the Git object database is a list of other objects with
names. git ls-tree outputs the mode, type, object hash, and filename for items inside a tree. Once
we dig down to one of the tree items, we find that inside it is a blob named &ldquo;ac9117f&rdquo; (the SHA-1
hash of the commit pointed to by master), with contents &ldquo;0a04b98&rdquo; (which is the ID of the Mercurial
changeset at the tip of the default branch).
<p>The good news is that we mostly don&rsquo;t have to worry about all of this. The typical workflow won&rsquo;t
be very different from working with a Git remote.
<p>There&rsquo;s one more thing we should attend to before we continue: ignores. Mercurial and Git use a
very similar mechanism for this, but it&rsquo;s likely you don&rsquo;t want to actually commit a .gitignore file
into a Mercurial repository. Fortunately, Git has a way to ignore files that&rsquo;s local to an on-disk
repository, and the Mercurial format is compatible with Git, so you just have to copy it over:
<p>$ cp .hgignore .git/info/exclude
<p>The .git/info/exclude file acts just like a .gitignore, but isn&rsquo;t included in commits.
<p>Workflow
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume we&rsquo;ve done some work and made some commits on the master branch, and you&rsquo;re
ready to push it to the remote repository. Here&rsquo;s what our repository looks like right now:
<p>$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
* ba04a2a (HEAD, master) Update makefile
* d25d16f Goodbye
* ac7955c (origin/master, origin/branches/default, origin/HEAD,

* 65bb417 Create a standard 'hello, world' program
<p>384</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Our master branch is two commits ahead of origin/master, but those two commits exist only on our
local machine. Let&rsquo;s see if anyone else has been doing important work at the same time:
<p>$ git fetch

<p>Since we used the --all flag, we see the &ldquo;notes&rdquo; refs that are used internally by git-remote-hg, but
we can ignore them. The rest is what we expected; origin/master has advanced by one commit, and
our history has now diverged. Unlike the other systems we work with in this chapter, Mercurial is
capable of handling merges, so we&rsquo;re not going to do anything fancy.

<p>The changeset numbered 2 was made by Mercurial, and the changesets numbered 3 and 4 were
made by git-remote-hg, by pushing commits made with Git.
<p>Branches and Bookmarks
<p>Git has only one kind of branch: a reference that moves when commits are made. In Mercurial, this
kind of a reference is called a &ldquo;bookmark,&rdquo; and it behaves in much the same way as a Git branch.
<p>Mercurial&rsquo;s concept of a &ldquo;branch&rdquo; is more heavyweight. The branch that a changeset is made on is
recorded with the changeset, which means it will always be in the repository history. Here&rsquo;s an
example of a commit that was made on the develop branch:
<p>$ hg log -l 1
changeset: 6:8f65e5e02793
branch: develop
tag: tip
user: Ben Straub &lt;ben@straub.cc&gt;
date: Thu Aug 14 20:06:38 2014 -0700
summary: More documentation
<p>Note the line that begins with &ldquo;branch&rdquo;. Git can&rsquo;t really replicate this (and doesn&rsquo;t need to; both
types of branch can be represented as a Git ref), but git-remote-hg needs to understand the
difference, because Mercurial cares.
<p>Creating Mercurial bookmarks is as easy as creating Git branches. On the Git side:
