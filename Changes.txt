CHANGES applied into ABCD 2.0f since 31/1/2017


- include setting for Unicode : added in htdocs/central/dbadmin/iah_edit_db.php :
echo "<tr><td valign=top>UNICODE</td><td><input type=checkbox name=UNICODE value=\"ON\" ";
				if ($unicode!="")  echo " checked";
				echo "> ON</td>";
- changed <? into <?php on line 84 of htdocs/central/dbadmin/iah_edit_db.php because short_open_tag is now OFF and this caused JavaScripts no longer to work.
